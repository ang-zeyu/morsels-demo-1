Here, let me return the money.\"    And she offered him a dime from her own purse.    \"You can pay next time, Miss Florence. It's all right. Now, I'll tell  you where we are goin'. A friend of mine, Mrs. O'Keefe, has a lodgin'  house, just off the Bowery. I saw her last night, and she says she's  got a good room that she can give you for two dollars a week--I don't  know how much you'd be willing to pay, but----\"    \"I can pay that for a time at least. I have a little money, and I must  find some work to do soon. Is this Mrs. O'Keefe a nice lady?\"    \"She ain't a lady at all,\" answered Dodger, bluntly. \"She keeps an  apple-stand near the corner of Bowery and Grand Street; but she's a  good, respectable woman, and she's good-hearted. She'll be kind to  you, and try to make things pleasant; but if you ain't satisfied----\"    \"It will do for the present. Kindness is what I need, driven as I am  from the home of my childhood. But you, Dodger, where do you live?\"    \"I'm goin' to take a small room in the same house, Miss Florence.\"    \"I shall be glad to have you near me.\"    \"I am proud to hear you say that. I'm a poor boy, and you're a rich  lady, but----\"    \"Not rich, Dodger. I am as poor as yourself.\"    \"You're a reg'lar lady, anyway. You ain't one of my kind, but I'm  going to improve and raise myself. I was readin' the other day of a  rich man that was once a poor boy, and sold papers like me. But  there's one thing in the way--I ain't got no eddication.\"    \"You can read and write, can't you, Dodger?\"    \"Yes; I can read pretty well, but I can't write much.\"    \"I will teach you in the evenings, when we are both at leisure.\"    \"Will you?\" asked the boy, with a glad smile. \"You're very kind--I'd  like a teacher like you.\"    \"Then it's a bargain, Dodger,\" and Florence's face for the first time  lost its sad look, as she saw an opportunity of helping one who had  befriended her. \"But you must promise to study faithfully.\"    \"That I will. If I don't, I'll give you leave to lick me.\"    \"I shan't forget that,\" said Florence, amused. \"I will buy a ruler of  good hard wood, and then you must look out. But, tell me, where have  you lived hitherto?\"    \"I don't like to tell you, Miss Florence. I've lived ever since I was  a kid with a man named Tim Bolton. He keeps a saloon on the Bowery,  near Houston Street. It's a tough place, I tell you. I've got a bed in  one corner--it's tucked away in a closet in the day.\"    \"I suppose it is a drinking saloon?\"    \"Yes, that's what it is.\"    \"And kept open very late?\"    \"Pretty much all night.\"    \"Is this Tim Bolton any relation of yours?\"    \"He says he's my father; but I don't believe it.\"    \"Have you always lived with him?\"    \"Ever since I was a small kid.\"    \"Have you always lived in New York?\"    \"No; I was out in Australia. Tim was out in the country part of the  time, and part of the time he kept a saloon in Melbourne. There was  thieves and burglars used to come into his place. I knew what they  were, though they didn't think I did.\"    \"How terrible for a boy to be subjected to such influences.\"    \"But I've made up my mind I won't live with Tim no longer. I can earn  my own livin' sellin' papers, or smashin' baggage, and keep away from  Tim. I'd have done it before if I'd had a friend like you to care for  me.\"    \"We will stand by each other, Dodger. Heaven knows I need a friend,  and if I can be a friend to you, and help you, I will.\"    \"We'll get out here, Miss Florence. I told Mrs. O'Keefe I'd call at  her stand, and she'll go over and show you your room.\"    They left the car at the corner of Grand Street, and Dodger led the  way to an apple-stand, presided over by a lady of ample proportions,  whose broad, Celtic face seemed to indicate alike shrewd good sense  and a kindly spirit.    \"Mrs. O'Keefe,\" said Dodger, \"this is the young lady I spoke to you  about--Miss Florence Linden.\"    \"It's welcome you are, my dear, and I'm very glad to make your  acquaintance. You look like a rale leddy, and I don't know how you'll  like the room I've got for you.\"    \"I cannot afford to be particular, Mrs. O'Keefe. I have had a--a  reverse of circumstances, and I must be content with an humble home.\"    \"Then I'll go over and show it to you. Here, Kitty, come and mind the  stand,\" she called to a girl about thirteen across the street, \"and  don't let anybody steal the apples. Look out for Jimmy Mahone, he  stole a couple of apples right under my nose this mornin', the young  spalpeen!\"    As they were crossing the street, a boy of fourteen ran up to Dodger.    \"Dodger,\" said he, \"you'd better go right over to Tim Bolton's. He's  in an awful stew--says he'll skin you alive if you don't come to the  s'loon right away.\"          Chapter IX.  The New Home.      \"You can tell Tim Bolton,\" said Dodger, \"that I don't intend to come  back at all.\"    \"You don't mean it, Dodger?\" said Ben Holt, incredulously.    \"Yes, I do. I'm going to set up for myself.\"    \"Oh, Dodger,\" said Florence, \"I'm afraid you will get into trouble for  my sake!\"    \"Don't worry about that, Miss Florence. I'm old enough to take care of  myself, and I've got tired of livin' with Tim.\"    \"But he may beat you!\"    \"He'll have to get hold of me first.\"    They had reached a four-story tenement of shabby brick, which was  evidently well filled up by a miscellaneous crowd of tenants; shop  girls, mechanics, laborers and widows, living by their daily toil.    Florence had never visited this part of the city, and her heart sank  within her as she followed Mrs. O'Keefe through a dirty hallway, up a  rickety staircase, to the second floor.    \"One more flight of stairs, my dear,\" said Mrs. O'Keefe,  encouragingly. \"I've got four rooms upstairs; one of them is for you,  and one for Dodger.\"    Florence did not reply. She began to understand at what cost she had  secured her freedom from a distasteful marriage.    In her Madison Avenue home all the rooms were light, clean and  luxuriously furnished. Here---- But words were inadequate to describe  the contrast.    Mrs. O'Keefe threw open the door of a back room about twelve feet  square, furnished in the plainest manner, uncarpeted, except for a  strip that was laid, like a rug, beside the bedstead.    There was a washstand, with a mirror, twelve by fifteen inches, placed  above it, a pine bureau, a couple of wooden chairs, and a cane-seated  rocking-chair.    \"There, my dear, what do you say to that?\" asked Mrs. O'Keefe,  complacently. \"All nice and comfortable as you would wish to see.\"    \"It is--very nice,\" said Florence, faintly, sacrificing truth to  politeness.    \"And who do you think used to live here?\" asked the apple-woman.    \"I'm sure I don't know.\"    \"The bearded woman in the dime museum,\" answered Mrs. O'Keefe, nodding  her head. \"She lived with me three months, and she furnished the room  herself. When she went away she was hard up, and I bought the  furniture of her cheap. You remember Madam Berger, don't you, Dodger?\"    \"Oh, yes, I seen her often.\"    \"She got twenty-five dollars a week, and she'd ought to have saved  money, but she had a good-for-nothin' husband that drank up all her  hard earnin's.\"    \"I hope she didn't drink herself,\" said Florence, who shuddered at the  idea of succeeding a drunken tenant.    \"Not a drop. She was a good, sober lady, if she did work in a dime  museum. She only left here two weeks ago. It isn't every one I'd be  willin' to take in her place, but I see you're a real leddy, let alone  that Dodger recommends you. I hope you'll like the room, and I'll do  all I can to make things pleasant. You can go into my room any hour,  my dear, and do your little cookin' on my stove. I s'pose you'll do  your own cookin'?\"    \"Well, not just at present,\" faltered Florence. \"I am afraid I don't  know much about cooking.\"    \"You'll find it a deal cheaper, and it's more quiet and gentale than  goin' to the eatin'-houses. I'll help you all I can, and glad to.\"    \"Thank you, Mrs. O'Keefe, you are very kind,\" said Florence,  gratefully. \"Perhaps just at first you wouldn't object to taking me as  a boarder, and letting me take my meals with you. I don't think I  would like to go to the eating-houses alone.\"    \"To be sure, my dear, if you wish it, and I'll be glad of your  company. I'll make the terms satisfactory.\"    \"I have no doubt of that,\" said Florence, feeling very much relieved.    \"If I might be so bold, what kind of work are you going to do?\"    \"I hardly know. It has come upon me so suddenly. I shall have to do  something, for I haven't got much money. What I should like best would  be to write----\"    \"Is it for the papers you mean?\"    \"Oh, no; I mean for some author or lawyer.\"    \"I don't know much about that,\" said Mrs. O'Keefe. \"In fact, I don't  mind tellin' you, my dear, that I can't write myself, but I earn a  good livin' all the same by my apple-stand. I tell you, my dear,\" she  continued in a confidential tone, \"there is a good dale of profit in  sellin' apples. It's better than sewin' or writin'. Of course, a young  leddy like you wouldn't like to go into the business.\"    Florence shook her head, with a smile.    \"No, Mrs. O'Keefe,\" she said. \"I am afraid I haven't a business turn,  and I should hardly like so public an employment.\"    \"Lor', miss, it's nothin' if you get used to it. There's nothin' dull  about my business, unless it rains, and you get used to havin' people  look at you.\"    \"It isn't all that are worth looking at like you, Mrs. O'Keefe,\" said  Dodger, slyly.    \"Oh, go away wid your fun, Dodger,\" said the apple-woman,  good-naturedly. \"I ain't much to look at, I know.\"    \"I think there's a good deal of you to look at, Mrs. O'Keefe. You must  weigh near three hundred.\"    \"I've a good mind to box your ears, Dodger. I only weigh a hundred and  ninety-five. But I can't be bothered wid your jokes. Can you sew, Miss  Florence?\"    \"Yes; but I would rather earn my living some"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1860"],[0,"Westward Ho! Or, The Voyages and Adventures of Sir Amyas Leigh, Knight, of (#7)"],[1," those blood-stained  streets, and shrieking women, and heaps of insulted corpses, which he  had beheld in Paris on the night of St. Bartholomew. At last, a few  months before his father died, he had taken back his pupils to their  home in Germany, from whence he was dismissed, as he wrote, with rich  gifts; and then Mrs. Leigh's heart beat high, at the thought that the  wanderer would return: but, alas! within a month after his father's  death, came a long letter from Frank, describing the Alps, and the  valleys of the Waldenses (with whose Barbes he had had much talk about  the late horrible persecutions), and setting forth how at Padua he had  made the acquaintance of that illustrious scholar and light of the age,  Stephanus Parmenius (commonly called from his native place, Budaeus),  who had visited Geneva with him, and heard the disputations of their  most learned doctors, which both he and Budaeus disliked for their hard  judgments both of God and man, as much as they admired them for their  subtlety, being themselves, as became Italian students, Platonists of  the school of Ficinus and Picus Mirandolensis. So wrote Master Frank,  in a long sententious letter, full of Latin quotations: but the letter  never reached the eyes of him for whose delight it had been penned: and  the widow had to weep over it alone, and to weep more bitterly than ever  at the conclusion, in which, with many excuses, Frank said that he had,  at the special entreaty of the said Budaeus, set out with him down the  Danube stream to Buda, that he might, before finishing his travels,  make experience of that learning for which the Hungarians were famous  throughout Europe. And after that, though he wrote again and again to  the father whom he fancied living, no letter in return reached him from  home for nearly two years; till, fearing some mishap, he hurried back to  England, to find his mother a widow, and his brother Amyas gone to the  South Seas with Captain Drake of Plymouth. And yet, even then, after  years of absence, he was not allowed to remain at home. For Sir Richard,  to whom idleness was a thing horrible and unrighteous, would have him up  and doing again before six months were over, and sent him off to Court  to Lord Hunsdon.    There, being as delicately beautiful as his brother was huge and strong,  he had speedily, by Carew's interest and that of Sidney and his Uncle  Leicester, found entrance into some office in the queen's household; and  he was now basking in the full sunshine of Court favor, and fair ladies'  eyes, and all the chivalries and euphuisms of Gloriana's fairyland, and  the fast friendship of that bright meteor Sidney, who had returned with  honor in 1577, from the delicate mission on behalf of the German and  Belgian Protestants, on which he had been sent to the Court of Vienna,  under color of condoling with the new Emperor Rodolph on his father's  death. Frank found him when he himself came to Court in 1579 as lovely  and loving as ever; and, at the early age of twenty-five, acknowledged  as one of the most remarkable men of Europe, the patron of all men of  letters, the counsellor of warriors and statesmen, and the confidant and  advocate of William of Orange, Languet, Plessis du Mornay, and all the  Protestant leaders on the Continent; and found, moreover, that the son  of the poor Devon squire was as welcome as ever to the friendship of  nature's and fortune's most favored, yet most unspoilt, minion.    Poor Mrs. Leigh, as one who had long since learned to have no self,  and to live not only for her children but in them, submitted without a  murmur, and only said, smiling, to her stern friend--\"You took away my  mastiff-pup, and now you must needs have my fair greyhound also.\"    \"Would you have your fair greyhound, dear lady, grow up a tall and  true Cotswold dog, that can pull down a stag of ten, or one of those  smooth-skinned poppets which the Florence ladies lead about with a ring  of bells round its neck, and a flannel farthingale over its loins?\"    Mrs. Leigh submitted; and was rewarded after a few months by a letter,  sent through Sir Richard, from none other than Gloriana herself, in  which she thanked her for \"the loan of that most delicate and flawless  crystal, the soul of her excellent son,\" with more praises of him than I  have room to insert, and finished by exalting the poor mother above the  famed Cornelia; \"for those sons, whom she called her jewels, she  only showed, yet kept them to herself: but you, madam, having two as  precious, I doubt not, as were ever that Roman dame's, have, beyond her  courage, lent them both to your country and to your queen, who therein  holds herself indebted to you for that which, if God give her grace, she  will repay as becomes both her and you.\" Which epistle the sweet mother  bedewed with holy tears, and laid by in the cedar-box which held her  household gods, by the side of Frank's innumerable diplomas and letters  of recommendation, the Latin whereof she was always spelling over  (although she understood not a word of it), in hopes of finding, here  and there, that precious excellentissimus Noster Franciscus Leighius  Anglus, which was all in all to the mother's heart.    But why did Amyas go to the South Seas? Amyas went to the South Seas for  two causes, each of which has, before now, sent many a lad to far worse  places: first, because of an old schoolmaster; secondly, because of a  young beauty. I will take them in order and explain.    Vindex Brimblecombe, whilom servitor of Exeter College, Oxford (commonly  called Sir Vindex, after the fashion of the times), was, in those days,  master of the grammar-school of Bideford. He was, at root, a godly and  kind-hearted pedant enough; but, like most schoolmasters in the old  flogging days, had his heart pretty well hardened by long, baneful  license to inflict pain at will on those weaker than himself; a power  healthful enough for the victim (for, doubtless, flogging is the best of  all punishments, being not only the shortest, but also a mere bodily and  animal, and not, like most of our new-fangled \"humane\" punishments, a  spiritual and fiendish torture), but for the executioner pretty certain  to eradicate, from all but the noblest spirits, every trace of chivalry  and tenderness for the weak, as well, often, as all self-control and  command of temper. Be that as it may, old Sir Vindex had heart enough  to feel that it was now his duty to take especial care of the fatherless  boy to whom he tried to teach his qui, quae, quod: but the only outcome  of that new sense of responsibility was a rapid increase in the number  of floggings, which rose from about two a week to one per diem, not  without consequences to the pedagogue himself.    For all this while, Amyas had never for a moment lost sight of his  darling desire for a sea-life; and when he could not wander on the quay  and stare at the shipping, or go down to the pebble-ridge at Northam,  and there sit, devouring, with hungry eyes, the great expanse of ocean,  which seemed to woo him outward into boundless space, he used to console  himself, in school-hours, by drawing ships and imaginary charts upon his  slate, instead of minding his \"humanities.\"    Now it befell, upon an afternoon, that he was very busy at a map, or  bird's-eye view of an island, whereon was a great castle, and at the  gate thereof a dragon, terrible to see; while in the foreground came  that which was meant for a gallant ship, with a great flag aloft, but  which, by reason of the forest of lances with which it was crowded,  looked much more like a porcupine carrying a sign-post; and, at the  roots of those lances, many little round o's, whereby was signified  the heads of Amyas and his schoolfellows, who were about to slay that  dragon, and rescue the beautiful princess who dwelt in that enchanted  tower. To behold which marvel of art, all the other boys at the same  desk must needs club their heads together, and with the more security,  because Sir Vindex, as was his custom after dinner, was lying back in  his chair, and slept the sleep of the just.    But when Amyas, by special instigation of the evil spirit who haunts  successful artists, proceeded further to introduce, heedless of  perspective, a rock, on which stood the lively portraiture of Sir  Vindex--nose, spectacles, gown, and all; and in his hand a brandished  rod, while out of his mouth a label shrieked after the runaways,  \"You come back!\" while a similar label replied from the gallant bark,  \"Good-bye, master!\" the shoving and tittering rose to such a pitch that  Cerberus awoke, and demanded sternly what the noise was about. To which,  of course, there was no answer.    \"You, of course, Leigh! Come up, sir, and show me your exercitation.\"    Now of Amyas's exercitation not a word was written; and, moreover,  he was in the very article of putting the last touches to Mr.  Brimblecombe's portrait. Whereon, to the astonishment of all hearers, he  made answer--    \"All in good time, sir!\" and went on drawing.    \"In good time, sir! Insolent, veni et vapula!\"    But Amyas went on drawing.    \"Come hither, sirrah, or I'll flay you alive!\"    \"Wait a bit!\" answered Amyas.    The old gentleman jumped up, ferula in hand, and darted across the  school, and saw himself upon the fatal slate.    \"Proh flagitium! what have we here, villain?\" and clutching at his  victim, he raised the cane. Whereupon, with a serene and cheerful  countenance, up rose the mighty form of Amyas Leigh, a head and  shoulders above his tormentor, and that slate descended on the bald  coxcomb of Sir Vindex Brimblecombe, with so shrewd a blow that slate and  pate cracked at the same instant, and the poor pedagogue dropped to the  floor, and lay for dead.    After which Amyas arose, and walked out of the school, and so quietly  home; and having taken counsel with himself, went to his mother, and  said, \"Please, mother, I've broken"]]]
