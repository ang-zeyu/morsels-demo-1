But at its capitulation, he is undeceived  concerning the Hellenic patriots; they ravage and plunder so fiercely  that he turns from them with repugnance and both he and Alabanda abandon  the cause of liberty which they had championed. To his bride Hyperion  had promised a redeemed Greece--a lament is all that he can bring her.  She dies, Hyperion comes to Germany where his aesthetic Greek soul is  severely jarred by the sordidness, apathy and insensibility of these  \"barbarians.\" Returning to the Isthmus, he becomes a hermit and writes  his letters to Bellarmin, no less \"thatenarm und gedankenvoll\" himself  than his unfortunate countrymen whom he so characterizes.[60]    \"Hyperion,\" though written in prose, is scarcely anything more than a  long drawn out lyric poem, so thoroughly is action subordinated to  reflection, and so beautiful and rhythmic is the dignified flow of its  periods. But having said that the locality is Greece and its hero is  supposed to be a modern Greek, that in its scenic descriptions Hoelderlin  produces some wonderfully natural effects, and that the language shows  the imitation of Greek turns of expression--Homeric epithets and  similes--having said this, we have mentioned practically all the Greek  characteristics of the composition. And there is much in it that is  entirely un-Hellenic. To begin with, the form in which \"Hyperion\" is  cast, that of letters, written not even during the progress of the  events narrated, but after they are all a thing of the past, is not at  all a Greek idea. Moreover Weltschmerz, which constitutes the  \"Grundstimmung\" of all Hoelderlin's writings, and which is most plainly  and persistently expressed in \"Hyperion,\" is not Hellenic. Not that we  should have to look in vain for pessimistic utterances from the  classical poets of Greece--for does not Sophocles make the deliberate  statement: \"Not to be born is the most reasonable, but having seen the  light, the next best thing is to go to the place whence we came as soon  as possible.\"[61] Nevertheless, this sort of sentiment cannot be  regarded as representing the spirit of the ancient Greeks, which was  distinctly optimistic. They were happy in their worship of beauty in art  and in nature, and above all, happy in their creativeness. The question  suggests itself here, whether a poet can ever be a genuine pessimist,  since he has within him the everlasting impulse to create. And to create  is to hope. Hyperion himself says: \"Es lebte nichts, wenn es nicht  hoffte.\"[62] But we have already distinguished between pessimism as a  system of philosophy, and Weltschmerz as a poetic mood.[63] It is  certainly un-Hellenic that Hoelderlin allows Hyperion with his alleged  Greek nature to sink into contemplative inactivity. In the poem \"Der  Lorbeer,\" 1789, he exclaims:        Soll ewiges Trauern mich umwittern,      Ewig mich toeten die bange Sehnsucht?[64]    which gives expression to the fact that in his Weltschmerz there was a  very large admixture of \"Sehnsucht,\" an entirely un-Hellenic feeling.  Nor is there to be found in his entire make-up the slightest trace of  Greek irony, which would have enabled him to overcome much of the  bitterness of his life, and which might indeed have averted its final  catastrophe.    Undeniably Grecian is Hoelderlin's idea that the beautiful is also the  good. Long years he sought for this combined ideal. In Diotima, the muse  of his \"Hyperion,\" whose prototype was Susette Gontard, he has found  it--and now he feels that he is in a new world. To his friend Neuffer,  from whom he has no secrets, he writes: \"Ich konnte wohl sonst glauben,  ich wisse, was schoen und gut sei, aber seit ich's sehe, moecht' ich  lachen ueber all mein Wissen. Lieblichkeit und Hoheit, und Ruh und  Leben, und Geist und Gemuet und Gestalt ist Ein seeliges Eins in diesem  Wesen.\"[65] And six or eight months later: \"Mein Schoenheitsinn ist nun  vor Stoerung sicher. Er orientiert sich ewig an diesem Madonnenkopfe....  Sie ist schoen wie Engel! Ein zartes, geistiges, himmlisch reizendes  Gesicht! Ach ich koennte ein Jahrtausend lang mich und alles vergessen  bei ihr--Majestaet und Zaertlichkeit, und Froehlichkeit und Ernst--und  Leben und Geist, alles ist in und an ihr zu einem goettlichen Ganzen  vereint.\"[66] It would be difficult to conceive of a more complete and  sublime eulogy of any object of affection than the words just quoted,  and yet they do not conceal their author's etherial quality of thought,  his \"Uebersinnlichkeit.\" Even his boyish love-affairs seem to have been  largely of this character, and were in all likelihood due to the  necessity which he felt of bestowing his affection somewhere, rather  than to irresistible forces proceeding from the objects of his regard.    Lack of self-restraint, so often characteristic of the poet of  Weltschmerz, was not Hoelderlin's greatest fault. And yet if his intense  devotion to Susette remained undebased by sensual desires, as we know it  did, this was not solely due to the practice of heroic self-restraint,  but must be attributed in part to the fact that that side of his nature  was entirely subordinate to his higher ideals; and these were always a  stronger passion with Hoelderlin than his love. So that Diotima's  judgment of Hyperion is correct when she says: \"O es ist so ganz  natuerlich, dass Du nimmer lieben willst, weil Deine groessern Wuensche  verschmachten.\"[67] This consideration at once compels a comparison with  Lenau, which must be deferred, however, until the succeeding chapter.  Undoubtedly this year and a half at Frankfurt was the happiest period of  his whole life. It brought him a serenity of mind which he had never  before known. Ardent was the response called forth by his devotion, but  its influence was wholesome--it was soothing to his sensitive nerves.  And because it was altogether more a sublime than an earthly passion, he  indulged himself in it with a conscience void of offence. Doubtless he  correctly describes the influence of his relations with Diotima upon his  life when he writes: \"Ich sage Dir, lieber Neuffer! ich bin auf dem  Wege, ein recht guter Knabe zu werden.... mein Herz ist voll Lust, und  wenn das heilige Schicksal mir mein gluecklich Leben erhaelt, so hoff' ich  kuenftig mehr zu thun als bisher.\"[68] But the happy life was not to  continue long. Rudely the cup was dashed from his lips, and the poet's  pain intensified by one more disappointment--the bitterest of all he had  experienced. It filled him with thoughts of revenge, which he was  powerless to execute. There can be no question that if his love for  Susette had been of a less etherial order, less a thing of the soul, he  would have felt much less bitterly her husband's violent interference.  But returning to the poem \"Hyperion,\" for as such we may regard it, we  find in it the most complete expression of the attitude which the poet,  in his Weltschmerz, assumed toward nature. Nature is his constant  companion, mother, comforter in sorrow, in his brighter moments his  deity. This nature-worship, which speedily develops into a more or less  consistent pantheism, Hoelderlin expresses in Hyperion's second letter,  in the following creed: \"Eines zu sein mit allem, was lebt, in seliger  Selbstvergessenheit wiederzukehren ins All der Natur, das ist der Gipfel  der Gedanken und Freuden, das ist die heilige Bergeshoehe, der Ort der  ewigen Ruhe.\"[69] And so nature is to Hoelderlin always intensely real  and personal. The sea is youthful, full of exuberant joy; the  mountain-tops are hopeful and serene; with shouts of joy the stream  hurls itself like a giant down into the forests. Here and there his  personification of nature becomes even more striking: \"O das Morgenlicht  und ich, wir gingen uns entgegen, wie versoehnte Freunde.\"[70] Still more  intense is this feeling of personal intimacy, when he exclaims: \"O  selige Natur! ich weiss nicht, wie mir geschiehet, wenn ich mein Auge  erhebe von deiner Schoene, aber alle Lust des Himmels ist in den Thraenen,  die ich weine vor dir, der Geliebte vor der Geliebten.\"[71] It is  important for purposes of comparison, to note that notwithstanding his  intense Weltschmerz, in his treatment of nature Hoelderlin does not  select only its gloomy or terrible aspects. Light and shade alternate in  his descriptions, and only here and there is the background entirely  unrelieved. The thunderstorm is to him a dispenser of divine energies  among forest and field, even the seasons of decline and decay are not  left without sunshine: \"auf der stummen entblaetterten Landschaft, wo der  Himmel schoener als je, mit Wolken und Sonnenschein um die herbstlich  schlafenden Baeume spielte.\"[72] One passage in \"Hyperion\" bears so  striking a resemblance, however, to Lenau's characteristic  nature-pictures, that it shall be given in full--although even here,  when the gloom of his sorrow and disappointment was steadily deepening,  he does not fail to derive comfort from the warm sunshine, a thought for  which we should probably look in vain, had Lenau painted the picture:  \"Ich sass mit Alabanda auf einem Huegel der Gegend, in lieblich waermender  Sonn', und um uns spielte der Wind mit abgefallenem Laube. Das Land war  stumm; nur hie und da ertoente im Wald ein stuerzender Baum, vom Landmann  gefaellt, und neben uns murmelte der vergaengliche Regenbach hinab ins  ruhige Meer.\"[73]    In spite of his deep and persistent Weltschmerz, Hoelderlin rarely gives  expression to a longing for death. This forms so prominent a feature in  the thought of other types of Weltschmerz, for instance of Lenau and of  Leopardi, that its absence here cannot fail to be noticed. It is true  that in his dramatic poem \"Der Tod des Empedokles,\" which symbolizes the  closing of his account with the world, Hoelderlin causes his hero to  return voluntarily to nature by plunging into the fiery crater of Mount  Etna. But Empedokles does"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17373"],[0,"The Madonna in Art (#7)"],[1,"Madonna, of the Uffizi, and \"La Zingarella,\" at Naples.  Both show a perfect adaptation of the surroundings to the spirit of  the scene. In the first it is morning, and the gladness of Nature  reflects the Mother's rapturous joy in her awakening babe. A brilliant  light floods the figures in the foreground and melts across the green  slopes into the hazy distance of the sea-bound horizon. In the second  it is twilight, and a calm stillness broods over all, as under the  feathery palms the Mother bends, watchful, over her little one's  slumbers. Such were the revelations of Nature to the country-bred  painter from the little town of Correggio.    Turning now to Venice for our last examples, we find that the love of  natural scenery was remarkably strong in this city of water and sky,  where the very absence of verdure may have created a homesick longing  for the green fields. It was Venetian art which originated that form  of pastoral Madonna known as the Santa Conversazione. This is usually  a long, narrow picture, showing a group of sacred personages, against  a landscape setting, centering about the Madonna and child. The  composition has none of the formality of the enthroned Madonna. An  underlying unity of purpose and action binds all the figures together  in natural and harmonious relations.    The acknowledged leader of this style of composition--the inventor  indeed, according to many--was Palma Vecchio. It is curious that of a  painter whose works are so widely admired, almost nothing is known.  Even the traditions which once lent color to his life have been  shattered by the ruthless hand of the modern investigator. The span of  his life extended from 1480 to 1528. Thus he came at the beginning of  the century made glorious by Titian, and contributed not a little in  his own way to its glory.    It is supposed that he studied under Giovanni Bellini, and at one time  was a friend and colleague of Lorenzo Lotto. A child of the  mountains--for he was born in Serinalta--he never entirely lost the  influence of his early surroundings.    To the last his figures are grave, vigorous, sometimes almost rude,  partaking of the characteristics of the everlasting hills. Perhaps it  was these traits which made the Santa Conversazione a favorite  composition with him. He has an intense love of Nature in her most  luxuriant mood.    [Illustration: PALMA VECCHIO.--SANTA CONVERSAZIONE.]    For a collection of Palma's pictures, we should choose at least four  to represent his treatment of the Santa Conversazione: those at  Naples, Dresden, Munich, and Vienna. The Naples picture is considered  the most successful of Palma's large pictures of this kind, but it is  not easy for the less critical observer to choose a favorite among the  four. One general formula describes them all: a sunny landscape with  hills clad in their greenest garb; a tree in the foreground, beneath  which sits the Virgin, a comely, country-bred matron, who seems to  have drawn her splendid vigor from the clear, bright air. On her lap  she supports a sprightly little boy, who is the centre of attention.    In the simpler compositions the Madonna is at the left, and at the  right kneel or sit two saints. One is a handsome young rustic, unkempt  and roughly clad, sometimes figuring as St. John the Baptist, and  sometimes as St. Roch. With him is contrasted a beautiful young female  saint, usually St. Catherine. Where the composition includes other  figures, the Virgin is in the centre, with the attendant personages  symmetrically grouped on either side. In the Vienna picture the two  additional figures at the left are the aged St. Celestin and a fine  St. Barbara.    Of all schools of painting, the Venetian is the least translatable  into black and white, so rich in colors is the palette which composed  it. This is especially true of Palma, and to understand aright his  Santa Conversazione, we must read into it the harmony of colors which  it expresses, the chords of blue, red, brown, and green, the  shimmering lights and brilliant atmosphere.    [Illustration: FILIPPINO LIPPI.--MADONNA IN A ROSE  GARDEN.]    The subject of the Santa Conversazione should not be left without a  brief reference to other Venetians, who added to the popularity of  this charming style of picture. Berenson mentions seven by Palma's  pupil, Bonifazio Veronese, and one by his friend, Lorenzo Lotto. Cima,  Cariani, Paris Bordone, and last, but not least, the great Titian,[3]  lent their gifts to the subject, so that we have abundant evidence of  the Venetian love of natural scenery.    It remains to consider one more form of the pastoral Madonna, that  which represents the Virgin and child in \"a garden inclosed,\" in  allusion to the symbolism of Solomon's Song (4:12). The subject is  found among the woodcuts of Albert Duerer, but I have never seen it in  any German painting.    [Footnote 3: See particularly Titian's works in the Louvre, of which  the Vierge au Lapin is an especially charming pastoral.]    In Italian art there are two famous pictures of this class: by  Francia, in the Munich Gallery, and by Filippino Lippi (or so  attributed), in the Pitti, at Florence. In both the _motif_ is the  same: in the foreground, a square inclosure surrounded by a  rose-hedge, with a hilly landscape in the distance; the Virgin  kneeling before her child in the centre. Filippino Lippi's is one of  those pictures whose beauty attracts crowds of admirers to the canvas.  Copyists are kept busy, repeating the composition for eager  purchasers, and it has made its way all over the world. The circle of  graceful angels who, with the boy St. John, join the mother in adoring  the Christ-child, is one of the chief attractions of the picture. It  is a pretty conceit that one of these angels showers rose leaves upon  the babe.    The pastoral Madonna is the sort of picture which can never be  outgrown. The charm of nature is as perennial as is the beauty of  motherhood, and the two are always in harmony. Here, then, is a  proper subject for modern Madonna art, a field which has scarcely  been opened by the artists of our own day. Such pastoral Madonnas as  have been painted within recent years are all more or less artificial  in conception. Compared with the idyllic charm of the sixteenth  century pictures, they seem like pretty scenes in a well-mounted  opera. We are looking for better things.          CHAPTER V.    THE MADONNA IN A HOME ENVIRONMENT.      A subject so sacred as the Madonna was long held in too great  reverence to permit of any common or realistic treatment. The pastoral  setting brought the mother and her babe into somewhat closer and more  human relations than had before been deemed possible; but art was slow  to presume any further upon this familiarity. The Madonna as a  domestic subject, represented in the interior of her home, was  hesitatingly adopted, and has been so rarely treated, even down to our  own times, as to form but a small group of pictures in the great body  of art.    [Illustration: SCHONGAUER.--HOLY FAMILY.]    The Northern painters naturally led the way. Peculiarly home-loving  in their tastes, their ideal woman is the _hausfrau_, and it was with  them no lowering of the Madonna's dignity to represent her in this  capacity. A picture in the style of Quentin Massys hangs in the Munich  Gallery, and shows a Flemish bedroom of the fifteenth century. At the  left stands the bed, and on the right burns the fire, with a kettle  hanging over it. The Virgin sits alone with her babe at her breast.    More frequently a domestic scene of this sort includes other figures  belonging to the Holy Family. A typical German example is the picture  by Schongauer in the Belvedere Gallery at Vienna. The Virgin is seated  in homely surroundings, intent upon a bunch of grapes which she holds  in her hands, and which she has taken from a basket standing on the  floor beside her. Long, waving hair falls over her shoulders; a snowy  kerchief is folded primly in the neck of her dress; she is the  impersonation of virgin modesty. Her baby boy stands on her lap,  nestling against his mother; his eyes fixed on the fruit, his eager  little face glowing with pleasure. Beyond are seen the cattle, which  Joseph is feeding. He pauses at the door, a bundle of hay in his arms,  to look in with fond pride at his young wife and her child.    Schongauer's work belongs to the latter part of the fifteenth century,  and there was nothing similar to it in Italy at the same period. It is  true that Madonnas in domestic settings have been attributed to  contemporaneous Italians, but they were probably by some Flemish hand.    [Illustration: RAPHAEL.--MADONNA DELL' IMPANNATA.]    Giulio Romano, a pupil of Raphael, was perhaps the first of the  Italians to give any domestic touch to the subject of the Madonna and  child. His Madonna della Catina of the Dresden Gallery is well known.  It is so called from the basin in which the Christ-child stands while  the little St. John pours in water from a pitcher for the bath.  Another picture by the same artist shows the Madonna seated with her  child in the interior of a bedchamber. This was one of the  \"discoveries\" of the late Senator Giovanni Morelli, the critic, and is  in a private collection in Dresden.    To Giulio Romano also, according to recent criticism, is due the  domestic Madonna known as the \"Impannata,\" and usually attributed to  Raphael. It is probable that both artists had a hand in it, the master  in the arrangement of the composition, the pupil in its execution. A  bed at one side is concealed by a green curtain. In the rear is the  cloth-covered window which gives the picture its name. Elizabeth and  Mary Magdalene have brought home the child, who springs to his  mother's arms, smiling back brightly at his friends. One other Madonna  from Raphael's brush (the Orleans) has an interior setting, but the  domestic environment here is"]]]
