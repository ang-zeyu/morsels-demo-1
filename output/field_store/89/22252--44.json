To understand the extraordinary changes of meaning  both mythological and metaphysical which the word Buddha undergoes in  Mahayanist theology we must keep in mind not the personality of Gotama  but the idea that he is one of several successive Buddhas who for  convenience may be counted as four, seven or twenty-four but who  really form an infinite series extending without limit backwards into  the past and forwards into the future.[73] This belief in a series of  Buddhas produced a plentiful crop of imaginary personalities and also  of speculations as to their connection with one another, with the  phenomena of the world and with the human soul.    In the Pali Canon the Buddhas antecedent to Gotama are introduced much  like ancient kings as part of the legendary history of this world. But  in the Lalita-vistara (Chap. XX) and the Lotus (Chap. VII) we hear of  Buddhas, usually described as Tathagatas, who apparently do not belong  to this world at all, but rule various points of the compass, or  regions described as Buddha-fields (Buddha-kshetra). Their names are  not the same in the different accounts and we remain dazzled by an  endless panorama of an infinity of universes with an infinity of  shining Buddhas, illuminating infinite space.    Somewhat later five of these unearthly Buddhas were formed into a  pentad and described as Jinas[74] or Dhyani Buddhas (Buddhas of  contemplation), namely, Vairocana, Akshobhya, Ratnasambhava, Amitabha  and Amoghasiddhi. In the fully developed form of this doctrine these  five personages are produced by contemplation from the Adi-Buddha or  original Buddha spirit and themselves produce various reflexes,  including Bodhisattvas, human Buddhas and goddesses like Tara. The  date when these beliefs first became part of the accepted Mahayana  creed cannot be fixed but probably the symmetrical arrangement of five  Buddhas is not anterior to the tantric period[75] of Buddhism.    The most important of the five are Vairocana and Amitabha. Akshobhya  is mentioned in both the Lotus and Smaller Sukhavati-vyuha as the  chief Buddha of the eastern quarter, and a work purporting to be a  description of his paradise still extant in Chinese[76] is said to  have been translated in the time of the Eastern Han dynasty. But even  in the Far East he did not find many worshippers. More enduring has  been the glory of Vairocana who is the chief deity of the Shingon sect  in Japan and is represented by the gigantic image in the temple at  Nara. In Java he seems to have been regarded as the principal and  supreme Buddha. The name occurs in the Mahavastu as the designation of  an otherwise unknown Buddha of luminous attributes and in the Lotus we  hear of a distant Buddha-world called Vairocana-rasmi-pratimandita,  embellished by the rays of the sun.[77] Vairocana is clearly a  derivative of Virocana, a recognized title of the sun in Sanskrit, and  is rendered in Chinese by Ta-jih meaning great Sun. How this solar  deity first came to be regarded as a Buddha is not known but the  connection between a Buddha and light has always been recognized. Even  the Pali texts represent Gotama as being luminous on some occasions  and in the Mahayanist scriptures Buddhas are radiant and light-giving  beings, surrounded by halos of prodigious extent and emitting flashes  which illuminate the depths of space. The visions of innumerable  paradises in all quarters containing jewelled stupas and lighted by  refulgent Buddhas which are frequent in these works seem founded on  astronomy vaporized under the influence of the idea that there are  millions of universes all equally transitory and unsubstantial. There  is no reason, so far as I see, to regard Gotama as a mythical solar  hero, but the celestial Buddhas[78] clearly have many solar  attributes. This is natural. Solar deities are so abundant in Vedic  mythology that it is hardly possible to be a benevolent god without  having something of the character of the sun. The stream of foreign  religions which flowed into India from Bactria and Persia about the  time of the Christian era brought new aspects of sun worship such as  Mithra, Helios and Apollo and strengthened the tendency to connect  divinity and light. And this connection was peculiarly appropriate and  obvious in the case of a Buddha, for Buddhas are clearly revealers and  light-givers, conquerors of darkness and dispellers of ignorance.    Amitabha (or the Buddha of measureless light), rising suddenly from an  obscure origin, has like Avalokita and Vishnu become one of the great  gods of Asia. He is also known as Amitayus or measureless life, and is  therefore a god of light and immortality. According to both the Lotus  and the Smaller Sukhavati-vyuha he is the lord of the western quarter  but he is unknown to the Lalita-vistara. It gives the ruler of the  west a lengthy title,[79] which suggests a land of gardens. Now  Paradise, which has biblical authority as a name for the place of  departed spirits, appears to mean in Persian a park or enclosed garden  and the Avesta speaks of four heavens, the good thought Paradise, the  good word Paradise, the good deed Paradise and the Endless Lights.[80]  This last expression bears a remarkable resemblance to the name of  Amitabha and we can understand that he should rule the west, because  it is the home to which the sun and departed spirits go. Amitabha's  Paradise is called Sukhavati or Happy Land. In the Puranas the city of  Varuna (who is suspected of having a non-Indian origin) is said to be  situated in the west and is called Sukha (Linga P. and Vayu P.) or  Mukhya (so Vishnu P. and others). The name Amitabha also occurs in the  Vishnu Purana as the name of a class of gods and it is curious that  they are in one place[81] associated with other deities called the  Mukhyas. The worship of Amitabha, so far as its history can be traced,  goes back to Saraha, the teacher of Nagarjuna. He is said to have been  a Sudra and his name seems un-Indian. This supports the theory that  this worship was foreign and imported into India.[82]    This worship and the doctrine on which it is based are an almost  complete contradiction of Gotama's teaching, for they amount to this,  that religion consists in faith in Amitabha and prayer to him, in  return for which he will receive his followers after death in his  paradise."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16572"],[0,"Indians of the Yosemite Valley and Vicinity (#7)"],[1,"due to old  age), but also in making a well person sick at their pleasure,  even at a distance; but when their sorcery failed to work on  their white enemies and exterminate them, they lost the  confidence of their followers to a large extent.    With the invasion of the white settlers came forced changes in  their old customs and manner of living, and a new variety of  epidemic and other diseases. When a doctor failed to cure these  diseases, and several deaths occurred in quick succession in a  camp, they believed the doctor was under the control of some evil  spirit, and killed him.    After the Indians were given their freedom from the reservations  in 1855, the old ones, subdued and broken-hearted, sickened and  died very fast, and most of the men doctors were killed off in a  few years. There are none known who now attempt to act in that  capacity.    There are still some women doctors who continue to practice the  magic art, but as there are now but very few Indians, there is  not so much sickness, and very few deaths in a year, so that the  doctors very rarely forfeit their lives by many of their patients  dying in quick succession.    Their most common mode of treatment in cases of sickness was to  scarify the painful locality with the sharp edge of a piece of  obsidian, and suck out the blood with the mouth. In cases of  headache, the forehead was operated on; in a case of colic the  abdomen was treated in the same way, as were also all painful  swellings on any part of the body.    The grand object of the doctor was to make the patient and  family firmly believe that his course of treatment was removing  the cause of the sickness. To aid in strengthening this belief,  after diagnosing the case, and before commencing operations, he  would quietly retire for a short time, ostensibly to get under  the influence of the divine healing spirit, but in reality to  fill his mouth with several small articles, such as bits of wood  or stone; he was then ready to commence treatment. After sucking  and spitting pure blood a few times, he began to spit out with  the blood, one after another, the things he had in his mouth, at  the sight of which all the attendants would join in a chorus of  grunts of astonishment, and the doctor would pretend to be very  much nauseated. In most ordinary cases two or three treatments  effected a cure.    The doctors also made use of certain rare medicinal plants in  treating some diseases. The Indian women have great faith in  charms made of the pungent roots of some rare plants from the  high mountain ranges, which they wear on strings around their  necks, or on a string of beads, to protect them from sickness.    In cases of malignant sores or ulcers on any part of the body,  the doctors treated them by applying dirt or earth, and in warm  weather would excavate a place in the ground and put the patient  in it, either in a sitting or recumbent position, as the nature  of the case required, and cover the affected part with earth for  several hours, daily. Sometimes, by this mode of treatment,  wonderful cures were made.    In all cases, if a doctor failed to cure a disease, and the  patient died, he was obliged to refund to the relatives any fee  which he had received for his services.      DISPOSING OF THE DEAD.    In the early days of the settlement of California, it seemed to  be the universal custom of the Indians along the foothills of the  Sierra Nevada range of mountains to burn the bodies of their  dead.    A suitable pile of readily combustible wood was prepared. The  body was taken charge of by persons chosen to perform the last  sacred rites, and firmly bound in skins or blankets, and then  placed upon the funeral pyre, with all the personal effects of  the deceased, together with numerous votive offerings from  friends and relatives. The chief mourners of the occasion seemed  to take but little active part in the ceremonies. When all was  ready, one of the assistants would light the fire, and the  terrible, wailing, mournful cry would commence, and the  professional chanters, with peculiar sidling movements and  frantic gestures, would circle round and round about the burning  pile. Occasionally, on arriving at the northwest corner of the  pile, they would stop, and, pointing to the West, would end a  crying refrain by exclaiming \"_Him-i-la'-ha!_\" When these  became exhausted, others would step in and take their places, and  thus keep up the mournful ceremony until the whole pile was  consumed.    After the pile had cooled, the charred bones and ashes were  gathered up, a few pieces of bone selected, and the remainder  buried. Of the pieces retained, some would be sent to distant  relatives, and the others pounded to a fine powder, then mixed  with pine pitch and plastered on the faces of the nearest female  relatives as a badge of mourning, to be kept there until it  naturally wore off. Every Indian camp used to have some of these  hideous looking old women in it in the \"early days.\"    One principal reason for burning the bodies of the dead was the  belief that there is an evil spirit, waiting and watching for the  animating spirit or soul to leave the body, that he may get it to  take to his own world of darkness and misery. By burning the  perishable body they thought that the immortal soul would be more  quickly released and set free to speed to the happy spirit world  in the _El-o'-win_, or far distant West, while with their loud,  wailing cries the evil spirit was kept away.    The young women take great care of their long, shiny, black hair,  of which they all feel very proud, as adding much to their  personal beauty, and they seldom have it cut before marriage. But  upon the death of a husband the wife has her hair all cut off and  burned with his body, so that he may still have it in his future  spirit home, to love and caress as a memento of his living  earth-wife.    [Illustration: _Photograph by Boysen_.  OLD KALAPINE.  One of the oldest Indians in the Valley. The short hair is a  badge of widowhood.]    These Indians believe that everything on earth, both natural and  artificial, is endowed with an immortal spirit, which is  indestructible, and that whatever personal property or precious  gifts are burned, either with the body or in later years for the  departed friend's benefit, will be received and made use of in  the spirit world. In recent years the Yosemites and other  remnants of tribes closely associated with them, have adopted the  custom of the white people, and bury their dead. The fine,  expensive blankets, and most beautifully worked baskets, which  have been kept sacredly in hiding for many years, to be buried  with the owner, are now cut into small fragments before being  deposited in the ground, for fear some white person will  desecrate the grave by digging them up and carrying them away.    There are no people in the world who more reverence for their  dead, or hold memory more sacred, than these so-called \"Digger\"  Indians. After being released from the reservations they kept  themselves in abject poverty for many sacrificing their best  blankets, baskets and clothing in the devouring flames of a fire  kindled for that purpose, when holding their annual mourning  festivals in memory of their dead friends.      RELIGIOUS BELIEFS.    The old Indians are all very reticent regarding their religious  beliefs. They hold them too sacred to be exposed to possible  ridicule, and it is therefore very difficult to get information  from them by direct questions.    They seem, however, to have a vague, indistinct belief or  tradition that their original ancestors, in the long forgotten  past, dwelt in a better and much more desirable country than  this, in the _El-o'-win_, or distant West, and that by some  misfortune or great calamity they were separated from that nappy  land, and became wanderers in this part of the world. They also  believe that the spirits of all good Indians will be permitted,  after death, to go back to that happy country of their ancestors'  origin; but that the spirits of bad Indians have to serve another  earth life in the form of a grizzly bear, as a punishment for  their former crimes. Hence, no Indians ever eat bear meat if  they know it.    All the old Indians are spiritualists, and very superstitious in  their religious beliefs. One special tenet is that if one of  their relatives or friends has been murdered, he will not receive  them on terms of friendship in the spirit world unless they  revenge his death, by either killing the murderer or some one of  the same blood. This belief sometimes results in an entirely  innocent person being put to death.    They all have a great fear of evil spirits, which they believe  have the power to do them much harm and defeat their  undertakings. They also have a fairly distinct idea of a Diety or  Great Spirit, who never does them any harm, and whose home is in  the happy land of their ancestors in the West.

The Yosemites and other kindred or adjacent tribes have been  branded as \"Diggers,\" and are generally thought to be the lowest  class of Indians in America, but in some lines of artistic work  they excelled all other tribes. For example, their basketry work,  for domestic and sacred purposes, and their bows and arrows, were  of very superior workmanship and fine finish.      BASKETRY AND BEAD WORK.    Many years ago the chief industry of the Indian women, aside from  their other domestic duties, was the making of baskets. They made  a great variety of shapes and sizes for their common use, and  also many of a more artistic design and finer finish for the  sacred purpose of being burned or buried with their bodies, or  that of some relative or dear friend, after death.
