Mr.  Wood asked him who gave him a right to marry a slave of his? My husband  said, \"Sir, I am a free man, and thought I had a right to choose a wife;  but if I had known Molly was not allowed to have a husband, I should not  have asked her to marry me.\" Mrs. Wood was more vexed about my marriage  than her husband. She could not forgive me for getting married, but  stirred up Mr. Wood to flog me dreadfully with the horsewhip. I thought it  very hard to be whipped at my time of life for getting a husband--I told  her so. She said that she would not have nigger men about the yards and  premises, or allow a nigger man's clothes to be washed in the same tub  where hers were washed. She was fearful, I think, that I should lose her  time, in order to wash and do things for my husband: but I had then no  time to wash for myself; I was obliged to put out my own clothes, though I  was always at the wash-tub.    I had not much happiness in my marriage, owing to my being a slave. It  made my husband sad to see me so ill-treated. Mrs. Wood was always abusing  me about him. She did not lick me herself, but she got her husband to do  it for her, whilst she fretted the flesh off my bones. Yet for all this  she would not sell me. She sold five slaves whilst I was with her; but  though she was always finding fault with me, she would not part with me.  However, Mr. Wood afterwards allowed Daniel to have a place to live in our  yard, which we were very thankful for.    After this, I fell ill again with the rheumatism, and was sick a long  time; but whether sick or well, I had my work to do. About this time I  asked my master and mistress to let me buy my own freedom. With the help  of Mr. Burchell, I could have found the means to pay Mr. Wood; for it was  agreed that I should afterwards, serve Mr. Burchell a while, for the cash  he was to advance for me. I was earnest in the request to my owners; but  their hearts were hard--too hard to consent. Mrs. Wood was very angry--she  grew quite outrageous--she called me a black devil, and asked me who had  put freedom into my head. \"To be free is very sweet,\" I said: but she took  good care to keep me a slave. I saw her change colour, and I left the  room.    About this time my master and mistress were going to England to put their  son to school, and bring their daughters home; and they took me with them  to take care of the child. I was willing to come to England: I thought  that by going there I should probably get cured of my rheumatism, and  should return with my master and mistress, quite well, to my husband. My  husband was willing for me to come away, for he had heard that my master  would free me,--and I also hoped this might prove true; but it was all a  false report.    The steward of the ship was very kind to me. He and my husband were in the  same class in the Moravian Church. I was thankful that he was so friendly,  for my mistress was not kind to me on the passage; and she told me, when  she was angry, that she did not intend to treat me any better in England  than in the West Indies--that I need not expect it. And she was as good as  her word.    When we drew near to England, the rheumatism seized all my limbs worse  than ever, and my body was dreadfully swelled. When we landed at the  Tower, I shewed my flesh to my mistress, but she took no great notice of  it. We were obliged to stop at the tavern till my master got a house; and  a day or two after, my mistress sent me down into the wash-house to learn  to wash in the English way. In the West Indies we wash with cold water--in  England with hot. I told my mistress I was afraid that putting my hands  first into the hot water and then into the cold, would increase the pain  in my limbs. The doctor had told my mistress long before I came from the  West Indies, that I was a sickly body and the washing did not agree with  me. But Mrs. Wood would not release me from the tub, so I was forced to do  as I could. I grew worse, and could not stand to wash. I was then forced  to sit down with the tub before me, and often through pain and weakness  was reduced to kneel or to sit down on the floor, to finish my task. When  I complained to my mistress of this, she only got into a passion as usual,  and said washing in hot water could not hurt any one;--that I was lazy and  insolent, and wanted to be free of my work; but that she would make me do  it. I thought her very hard on me, and my heart rose up within me. However  I kept still at that time, and went down again to wash the child's things;  but the English washerwomen who were at work there, when they saw that I  was so ill, had pity upon me and washed them for me.    After that, when we came up to live in Leigh Street, Mrs. Wood sorted out  five bags of clothes which we had used at sea, and also such as had been  worn since we came on shore, for me and the cook to wash. Elizabeth the  cook told her, that she did not think that I was able to stand to the tub,  and that she had better hire a woman. I also said myself, that I had come  over to nurse the child, and that I was sorry I had come from Antigua,  since mistress would work me so hard, without compassion for my  rheumatism. Mr. and Mrs. Wood, when they heard this, rose up in a passion  against me. They opened the door and bade me get out. But I was a  stranger, and did not know one door in the street from another, and was  unwilling to go away. They made a dreadful uproar, and from that day they  constantly kept cursing and abusing me. I was obliged to wash, though I  was very ill. Mrs. Wood, indeed once hired a washerwoman, but she was not  well treated, and would come no more.    My master quarrelled with me another time, about one of our great  washings, his wife having stirred him up to do so. He said he would compel  me to do the whole of the washing given out to me, or if I again refused,  he would take a short course with me: he would either send me down to the  brig in the river, to carry me back to Antigua, or he would turn me at  once out of doors, and let me provide for myself. I said I would willingly  go back, if he would let me purchase my own freedom. But this enraged him  more than all the rest: he cursed and swore at me dreadfully, and said he  would never sell my freedom--if I wished to be free, I was free in  England, and I might go and try what freedom would do for me, and be  d----d. My heart was very sore with this treatment, but I had to go on. I  continued to do my work, and did all I could to give satisfaction, but all  would not do.    Shortly after, the cook left them, and then matters went on ten times  worse. I always washed the child's clothes without being commanded to do  it, and any thing else that was wanted in the family; though still I was  very sick--very sick indeed. When the great washing came round, which was  every two months, my mistress got together again a great many heavy  things, such as bed-ticks, bed-coverlets, &c. for me to wash. I told her I  was too ill to wash such heavy things that day. She said, she supposed I  thought myself a free woman, but I was not; and if I did not do it  directly I should be instantly turned out of doors. I stood a long time  before I could answer, for I did not know well what to do. I knew that I  was free in England, but I did not know where to go, or how to get my  living; and therefore, I did not like to leave the house. But Mr. Wood  said he would send for a constable to thrust me out; and at last I took  courage and resolved that I would not be longer thus treated, but would go  and trust to Providence. This was the fourth time they had threatened turn  me out, and, go where I might, I was determined now to take them at their  word; though I thought it very hard, after I had lived with them for  thirteen years, and worked for them like a horse, to be driven out in this  way, like a beggar. My only fault was being sick, and therefore unable to  please my mistress, who thought she never could get work enough out of her  slaves; and I told them so: but they only abused me and drove me out. This  took place from two to three months, I think, after we came to England.    When I came away, I went to the man (one Mash) who used to black the shoes  of the family, and asked his wife to get somebody to go with me to Hatton  Garden to the Moravian Missionaries: these were the only persons I knew in  England. The woman sent a young girl with me to the mission house, and I  saw there a gentleman called Mr. Moore. I told him my whole story, and how  my owners had treated me, and asked him to take in my trunk with what few  clothes I had. The missionaries were very kind to me--they were sorry for  my destitute situation, and gave me leave to bring my things to be placed  under their care. They were very good people, and they told me to come to  the church.    When I went back to Mr. Wood's to get my trunk, I saw a lady, Mrs. Pell,  who was on a visit to my mistress. When Mr. and Mrs. Wood heard me come  in, they set this lady to stop me, finding that they had gone too far with  me. Mrs. Pell came out to me, and said, \"Are you really going to leave,  Molly? Don't leave, but come into the country with me.\" I believe she said  this because she thought Mrs. Wood would easily get me back again. I  replied to her, \"Ma'am, this is the fourth time my master and mistress  have driven me out, or threatened to drive me--and I will give them no  more occasion to bid me go. I was not willing to leave them, for I am a  stranger in this country, but now I must go--I can stay no longer to be so  used.\" Mrs. Pell then went up stairs to my mistress, and told that I would  go, and that she could not stop me. Mrs. Wood was very much hurt and  frightened when she found I was determined to go out that day. She said,  \"If she goes the people will rob her, and then turn her adrift.\" She did"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17855"],[0,"Hemp Hurds as Paper-Making Material (#7)"],[1,"wood and hemp hurds._    -----------+-------------+--------------+-----------+--------------------             |             |              |           | Acres required for             |             |              |           | sustained supply.             |             |              |           |---------+----------             |             | Raw material |  Annual   |         |  Material.  | Pulp yield. | required per |  growth   |   For   | For 1 ton             |             |    year.     | per acre. |  25-ton | of fiber             |             |              |           |  mill.  | per year.  -----------+-------------+--------------+-----------+---------+----------  Wood       | Two cords   | 15,000 cords | 0.37 cord |  40,500 |  5.4             | yield 1 ton |              | (about    |         |             | of fiber.   |              | 0.55 ton).|         |             |             |              |           |         |  Hemp hurds | One ton     | 25,000 tons  | 2.5 tons  |  10,000 |  1.33             | yields 600  |              |           |         |             | pounds      |              |           |         |             | of fiber.   |              |           |         |  -----------+-------------+--------------+-----------+---------+----------    The most important point derived from this calculation is in regard to  areas required for a sustained supply, which are in the ratio of 4 to 1.  Every tract of 10,000 acres which is devoted to hemp raising year by  year is equivalent to a sustained pulp-producing capacity of 40,500  acres of average pulp-wood lands. In other words, in order to secure  additional raw material for the production of 25 tons of fiber per day  there exists the possibility of utilizing the agricultural waste already  produced on 10,000 acres of hemp lands instead of securing, holding,  reforesting, and protecting 40,500 acres of pulp-wood land.    The annual growth per acre, although decidedly in favor of hurds, has  little bearing on the project, because the utilization of the hurds is  subordinate to the raising of hemp, and the paper manufacturer probably  could afford to use only hurds resulting from the hemp industry.      =PHYSICAL TESTS OF THE PAPERS PRODUCED.=    Samples of paper produced in the seven tests were submitted to the  Leather and Paper Laboratory of the Bureau of Chemistry.

The general character and  tests of these papers correspond very closely with No. 1 machine-finish  printing paper, according to the specifications of the United States  Government Printing Office, which call for a sheet not exceeding 0.0035  inch in thickness, strength not less than 12 points, free from  unbleached or ground wood pulp, and ash not over 10 per cent. The  strength factor of such papers is about 0.28. The ash should not be over  10 per cent for this grade of paper, but in spite of the larger amount  used the physical tests are sufficiently high. It is to be noted that  the physical tests of samples Nos. 138 to 142, inclusive, are higher  than in Nos. 143 and 144, in which 23 per cent of soda poplar was used,  which shows clearly that hemp-hurd stock imparts strength and folding  endurance to a greater extent than does soda-poplar stock. From these  preliminary tests it would be concluded, therefore, that hemp-hurd stock  acts similarly to soda-poplar stock, but will produce a somewhat harsher  and stronger sheet and one of higher folding endurance. Undoubtedly,  there is more dirt in the samples than would be tolerated by the trade,  but this was to be expected, since in this preliminary work the raw  material was sieved by hand screens instead of by automatic machines  which would sieve more thoroughly.      =CONCLUSIONS.=    There appears to be little doubt that under the present system of forest  use and consumption the present supply can not withstand the demands  placed upon it. By the time improved methods of forestry have  established an equilibrium between production and consumption, the price  of pulp wood may be such that a knowledge of other available raw  materials may be imperative.    Semicommercial paper-making tests were conducted, therefore, on hemp  hurds, in cooperation with a paper manufacturer. After several trials,  under conditions of treatment and manufacture which are regarded as  favorable in comparison with those used with pulp wood, paper was  produced which received very favorable comment both from investigators  and from the trade and which according to official tests would be  classed as a No. 1 machine-finish printing paper."]]]
