But her distance  from the sun, slightly exceeding 67,000,000 miles, is nearly double that  of Mercury, so that, when favorably situated, she becomes a very  conspicuous object, and, instead of being known almost exclusively by  astronomers, she is, perhaps, the most popular and most admired of all  the members of the planetary system, especially when she appears in the  charming role of the \"evening star.\" As she emerges periodically from  the blinding glare of the sun's immediate neighborhood and begins to  soar, bright as an electric balloon, in the twilight, she commands all  eyes and calls forth exclamations of astonishment and admiration by her  singular beauty. The intervals between her successive reappearances in  the evening sky, measured by her synodic period of 584 days, are  sufficiently long to give an element of surprise and novelty to every  return of so dazzling a phenomenon.    Even the light of the full moon silvering the tree tops does not  exercise greater enchantment over the mind of the contemplative  observer. In either of her roles, as morning or as evening star, Venus  has no rival. No fixed star can for an instant bear comparison with her.  What she lacks in vivacity of light--none of the planets twinkles, as do  all of the true stars--is more than compensated by the imposing size of  her gleaming disk and the striking beauty of her clear lamplike rays.  Her color is silvery or golden, according to the state of the  atmosphere, while the distinction of her appearance in a dark sky is so  great that no eye can resist its attraction, and I have known an  unexpected glimpse of Venus to put an end to an animated conversation  and distract, for a long time, the attention of a party of ladies and  gentlemen from the social occupation that had brought them together.    As a telescopic object Venus is exceedingly attractive, even when  considered merely from the point of view of simple beauty. Both Mercury  and Venus, as they travel about the sun, exhibit phases like those of  the moon, but Venus, being much larger and much nearer to the earth than  Mercury, shows her successive phases more effectively, and when she  shines as a thin crescent in the morning or evening twilight, only a  very slight magnifying power is required to show the sickle form of her  disk.    A remarkable difference between Venus and Mercury comes out as soon as  we examine the shape of the former's orbit. Venus's mean distance from  the sun is 67,200,000 miles, and her orbit is so nearly a circle, much  more nearly than that of any other planet, that in the course of a  revolution her distance from the sun varies less than a million miles.  The distance of the earth varies 3,000,000 miles, and that of Mercury  14,000,000. Her period of revolution, or the length of her year, is 225  of our days. When she comes between the sun and the earth she approaches  us nearer than any other planet ever gets, except the asteroid Eros, her  distance at such times being 26,000,000 miles, or about one hundred and  ten times the distance of the moon.    Being nearer to the sun in the ratio of 67 to 93, Venus receives almost  twice as much solar light and heat as we get, but less than one third as  much as Mercury gets. There is reason to believe that her axis, instead  of being considerably inclined, like that of the earth, is perpendicular  to the plane of her orbit. Thus Venus introduces to us another novelty  in the economy of worlds, for with a perpendicular axis of rotation she  can have no succession of seasons, no winter and summer flitting, one  upon the other's heels, to and fro between the northern and southern  hemispheres; but, on the contrary, her climatic conditions must be  unchangeable, and, on any particular part of her surface, except for  local causes of variation, the weather remains the same the year around.  So, as far as temperature is concerned, Venus may have two regions of  perpetual winter, one around each pole; two belts of perpetual spring in  the upper middle latitudes, one on each side of the equator; and one  zone of perpetual summer occupying the equatorial portion of the planet.  But, of course, these seasonal terms do not strictly apply to Venus, in  the sense in which we employ them on the earth, for with us spring is  characterized rather by the change in the quantity of heat and other  atmospheric conditions that it witnesses than by a certain fixed and  invariable temperature.    To some minds it may appear very undesirable, from the point of view of  animate existences, that there should be no alternation of seasons on  the surface of a planet, but, instead, fixed conditions of climate; yet  it is not clear that such a state of affairs might not be preferable to  that with which we are familiar. Even on the earth, we find that  tropical regions, where the seasonal changes are comparatively moderate,  present many attractions and advantages in contrast with the violent and  often destructive vicissitudes of the temperate zones, and nature has  shown us, within the pale of our own planet, that she is capable of  bringing forth harvests of fruit and grain without the stimulus of  alternate frost and sunshine.    Even under the reign of perpetual summer the fields and trees find time  and opportunity to rest and restore their productive forces.    The circularity of Venus's orbit, and the consequently insignificant  change in the sun's distance and heating effect, are other elements to  be considered in estimating the singular constancy in the operation of  natural agencies upon that interesting planet, which, twin of the earth  though it be in stature, is evidently not its twin in temperament.    And next as to the all-important question of atmosphere. In what  precedes, the presence of an atmosphere has been assumed, and,  fortunately, there is very convincing evidence, both visual and  spectroscopic, that Venus is well and abundantly supplied with air, by  which it is not meant that Venus's air is precisely like the mixture of  oxygen and nitrogen, with a few other gases, which we breathe and call  by that name. In fact, there are excellent reasons for thinking that the  atmosphere of Venus differs from the earth's quite as much as some of  her other characteristics differ from those of our planet. But, however  it may vary from ours in constitution, the atmosphere of Venus contains  water vapor, and is exceedingly abundant. Listen to Professor Young:    \"Its [Venus's] atmosphere is probably from one and a half to two times  as extensive and as dense as our own, and the spectroscope shows  evidence of the presence of water vapor in it.\"    And Prof. William C. Pickering, basing his statement on the result of  observations at the mountain observatory of Arequipa, says: \"We may feel  reasonably certain that at the planet's [Venus's] surface the density of  its atmosphere is many times that of our own.\"    We do not have to depend upon the spectroscope for evidence that Venus  has a dense atmosphere, for we can, in a manner, _see_ her atmosphere,  in consequence of its refractive action upon the sunlight that strikes  into it near the edge of the planet's globe. This illumination of  Venus's atmosphere is witnessed both when she is nearly between the sun  and the earth, and when, being exactly between them, she appears in  silhouette against the solar disk. During a transit of this kind, in  1882, many observers, and the present writer was one, saw a bright  atmospheric bow edging a part of the circumference of Venus when the  planet was moving upon the face of the sun--a most beautiful and  impressive spectacle.    Even more curious is an observation made in 1866 by Prof. C.S. Lyman, of  Yale College, who, when Venus was very near the sun, saw her atmosphere  _in the form of a luminous ring_. A little fuller explanation of this  appearance may be of interest.    When approaching inferior conjunction--i.e., passing between the earth  and sun--Venus appears, with a telescope, in the shape of a very thin  crescent. Professor Lyman watched this crescent, becoming narrower day  after day as it approached the sun, and noticed that its extremities  gradually extended themselves beyond the limits of a semicircle, bending  to meet one another on the opposite side of the invisible disk of the  planet, until, at length, they did meet, and he beheld a complete ring  of silvery light, all that remained visible of the planet Venus! The  ring was, of course, the illuminated atmosphere of the planet refracting  the sunlight on all sides around the opaque globe.    In 1874 M. Flammarion witnessed the same phenomenon in similar  circumstances. One may well envy those who have had the good fortune to  behold this spectacle--to actually see, as it were, the air that the  inhabitants of another world are breathing and making resonant with all  the multitudinous sounds and voices that accompany intelligent life. But  perhaps some readers will prefer to think that even though an atmosphere  is there, there is no one to breathe it.    [Illustration: VENUS'S ATMOSPHERE SEEN AS A RING OF LIGHT.]    As the visibility of Venus's atmosphere is unparalleled elsewhere in the  solar system, it may be worth while to give a graphic illustration of  it. In the accompanying figure the planet is represented at three  successive points in its advance toward inferior conjunction. As it  approaches conjunction it slowly draws nearer the earth, and its  apparent diameter consequently increases. At _A_ a large part of the  luminous crescent is composed of the planet's surface reflecting the  sunshine; at _B_ the ratio of the reflecting surface to the illuminated  atmosphere has diminished, and the latter has extended, like the curved  arms of a pair of calipers, far around the unilluminated side of the  disk; at _C_ the atmosphere is illuminated all around by the sunlight  coming through it from behind, while the surface of the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18435"],[0,"Good Things to Eat, as Suggested (#7)"],[1,"boiled eggs and parsley.      ~JELLIED CUCUMBER~--Pare and slice cucumbers and cook in water to cover  until tender. Drain, season with salt, a few grains of cayenne, and to  one cup of the cooked cucumber add a level teaspoon of gelatin dissolved  in a spoonful of cold water. Stir the soaked gelatin in while the  cucumber is hot. Set into a cold place to chill and become firm. If a  large mold is used break up roughly into pieces, if small molds are  taken then unmold onto lettuce leaves and serve with mayonnaise.      ~NUT AND CELERY SALAD~--Cover one cup of walnut meats and two slices of  onion with boiling water, to which is added a teaspoon of salt. Cook  half an hour, drain, turn into ice cold water for ten minutes, then rub  off the brown skin. Add the nuts broken in small pieces to two cups of  celery cut in small pieces crosswise. Use only the white inner stalks,  serve with a cream dressing.      ~SALAD~--Two cups of apples cut into small pieces, one cup celery cut  into small pieces, one cup English walnuts. Serve on a lettuce leaf with  mayonnaise dressing, made without mustard, and thinned with cream.  Garnish dish that dressing is made in with a little garlic.      ~SPANISH TOMATOES~--Choose ten or a dozen large tomatoes, cut a slice  from the stem end of each and scoop out the inside. Put the pulp into a  basin with two ounces of melted butter, two tablespoonfuls of lemon  juice, half a pound of chestnuts, boiled and grated, and seasoning of  salt and white pepper to taste. Fill the tomatoes with this, which  should be about the consistency of thick cream, spread with a thick  mayonnaise, garnish with chopped parsley and serve on lettuce leaves.      ~TOMATO BASKETS~--Tomato baskets are charming accessories for holding  vegetable salad, chicken, shrimps, cold beans, asparagus tips, shredded  celery, cucumbers cut in cubes and minced peppers. Choose firm, smooth  tomatoes, not too large and as nearly one size as possible. Dip for half  a minute in boiling water, skin and set in ice box to chill. Cut out  pulp and seeds, dress the cavity with salt, pepper, oil and vinegar,  then fill with the salad, seasoned with French dressing or mayonnaise.  Handles of watercress may be attached to these baskets. Set on lettuce  or cress, as desired.      ~TRIANON SALAD~--Cut one grape fruit and two oranges in sections and  free from seeds and membrane. Skin and seed one cup white grapes and cut  one-third cup pecan nut meats in small pieces. Mix ingredients, arrange  on a bed of romaine and pour over the following dressing: Mix four  tablespoons olive oil, one tablespoon grape juice, one tablespoon grape  vinegar, one-fourth teaspoon paprika, one-eighth teaspoon pepper and one  tablespoon finely chopped Roquefort cheese. This dressing should stand  in the ice-box four or five hours to become seasoned.      ~CREAM DRESSING~--Mix one-half level tablespoon each of salt and  mustard, three-quarters level tablespoon of sugar, one egg slightly  beaten, two and one-half tablespoons of melted butter, three-quarters  cup of cream, and heat in a double boiler. When hot add very slowly  one-quarter cup of hot vinegar, stirring all the time. When thickened  strain and cool.      ~FRENCH DRESSING~--For party of six five tablespoons of oil and three of  vinegar, juice of half lemon, two drops tabasco, tablespoon of salt,  slice of onion, and boil for three minutes and ready for service. Strain  and bottle and put in ice box, shake before using each time.      ~SALAD DRESSING~--When making salad for a large family take quart bottle  with a rather wide mouth, put in one-half cup of vinegar, one and  one-half cups of olive oil, two level teaspoons of salt and one-half  level teaspoon of pepper; cork the bottle tightly and shake vigorously  until an emulsion is made. The proportion of vinegar may be larger if  not very strong and more salt and pepper used if liked. Use from the  bottle and shake well each time any is used.    Instructions for Preparing Poultry Before Dressing.    To serve poultry tender and delicate; it should be kept some hours after  being killed before boiling or roasting. Poultry intended for dinner  should be killed the evening before. When poultry has ceased to bleed,  before picking put it into cold water, in a vessel large enough to  completely cover it. Then take out and soak in boiling water for a few  minutes. Pick it, being careful to take out all the small feathers. When  cleaning the inside of poultry or game be sure not to break the gall  bladder, for it will give a bitter taste to the meat. Be equally careful  not to tear the intestines near the gizzard, as it will make the inside  dirty and spoil the whole bird.          POULTRY AND POULTRY DRESSINGS      ~BOHEMIAN CHICKEN~--Select a young and tender chicken and prepare as for  frying or broiling. Place in a frying pan a pat of butter and place on  the fire. Beat to a smooth, thin batter two eggs, three spoonfuls of  milk and a little flour, season, dip each piece of the chicken in this  batter and fry a rich brown in the heated butter.      ~CHICKEN A LA TARTARE~--Have a chicken dressed and split down the back;  it should not weigh over two and a half pounds. Put one quarter cup of  butter in a frying pan with a teaspoon of finely minced parsley, half a  teaspoon of salt and a little pepper. Brown each half of the chicken in  the butter and on both sides. Take up the chicken, brush the inside over  with an egg beaten with one tablespoon of cold water, lay in a dripping  pan and dust over the egg half a cup of fine bread crumbs mixed with the  same amount of minced cooked ham. Set in a hot oven and finish cooking.  Serve on a hot dish with sauce tartare. The chicken will cook best if  laid in a wire broiler resting on the dripping pan.      ~CHICKEN BROILED IN PAPER~--Split a chicken and let it soak for two  hours in oil mixed with parsley, sliced onion, cloves, salt and pepper.  Put each half in papers, enclosing all the seasoning and broil over a  very slow fire. When done take off the paper, bacon, etc., and serve  with sauce a la ravigotte.      ~CHICKEN CROQUETTES~--Stir a pint of fine chopped chicken into a cup and  a quarter of sauce made of one-third cup of flour, three tablespoons of  butter, a cup of chicken stock and one-fourth cup of cream, season with  a few drops of onion juice, a teaspoon of lemon, one teaspoonful celery  salt and pepper. When thoroughly chilled form into cylindrical shapes,  roll in egg and bread crumbs and fry in deep fat. Serve surrounded with  peas and figures stamped upon cooked slices of carrot. Season with salt,  paprika and butter.      ~CHICKEN CROQUETTES~--Take two chickens weighing about two pounds each,  put them into a saucepan with water to cover, add two onions and  carrots, a small bunch of parsley and thyme, a few cloves and half a  grated nutmeg, and boil until birds are tender; then remove the skin,  gristle and sinews and chop the meat as fine as possible. Put into a  saucepan one pound of butter and two tablespoonfuls of flour, stir over  the fire for a few minutes and add half a pint of the liquor the  chickens were cooked in and one pint of rich cream, and boil for eight  or ten minutes, stirring continually. Remove the pan from the fire,  season with salt, pepper, grated nutmeg and a little powdered sweet  marjoram, add the chopped meat and stir well. Then stir in rapidly the  yolks of four eggs, place the saucepan on the fire for a minute,  stirring well, turn the mass onto a dish, spread it out and let it get  cold. Cover the hands with flour and form the preparation into shapes,  dip them into egg beaten with cream, then in sifted breadcrumbs and let  them stand for half an hour or so to dry; then fry them a delicate color  after plunging into boiling lard. Take them out, drain, place on a  napkin on a dish and serve. The remainder of the chicken stock may be  used for making consomme or soup.      ~CHICKEN CROQUETTES WITH FISH FLAVOR~--The foundation of all croquettes  is a thick white sauce which stiffens when cold, so that mixed with  minced fish, chicken or other compounds it can be easily handled and  shaped into pears, cylinders, ovals, etc. When cooked the croquettes  should be soft and creamy inside. This sauce is made as follows:--    Scald in a double boiler one pint rich milk or cream. Melt in a granite  saucepan two even tablespoons butter, then add two heaping  tablespoonfuls cornstarch or flour, and one tablespoon of flavor.    When blended add one-third of the hot cream and keep stirring as it  cooks and thickens. When perfectly smooth put in all the cream. The  sauce should be very thick. Add the seasoning, a half teaspoonful of  salt, a half teaspoonful celery salt, white peppers or paprika to taste,  then the meat.    In shaping the croquettes take about a tablespoonful of the mixture and  handling gently and carefully, press gently into whatever shape is  desired. Have ready a board sprinkled lightly with bread or cracker  crumbs, and roll the croquettes lightly in this, taking care not to  exert pressure sufficient to break them. Coat the croquettes with some  slightly salted beaten egg. Then roll again in the crumbs. Fry in deep  hot fat, a few at a time, then drain on paper.      ~CHICKEN POT PIE~--Cut a fowl into pieces to serve and cook in water to  cover until the bones will come out easily. Before taking them out drop  dumplings in, cover closely and cook ten minutes without lifting the  cover. The liquid should be boiling rapidly when the dough is put in and  kept boiling until the end. For the dumplings sift two cups of flour  twice with half a level teaspoon of salt and four level teaspoons of  baking powder. Mix with about seven-eighths cup of milk, turn out on a  well floured board and pat out half an inch thick. Cut into small cakes.  If this soft dough is put into the kettle in spoonfuls the time of  cooking must be doubled. The bones and meat"]]]
