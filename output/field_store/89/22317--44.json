After that, she sat  undisturbed for an hour.    In the middle of the afternoon, the bell rang with an  important-sounding tinkle. Immediately after, the door shut with an  important-sounding slam. The footsteps, clattering across the room to  the show case, had an important-sounding tap. And the little girl, who  looked inquisitively across the counter at Maida, had decidedly an  important manner.    She was not a pretty child. Her skin was too pasty, her blue eyes  too full and staring. But she had beautiful braids of glossy brown  hair that came below her waist. And you would have noticed her at  once because of the air with which she wore her clothes and because  of a trick of holding her head very high.    Maida could see that she was dressed very much more expensively than  the other children in the neighborhood. Her dark, blue coat was  elaborate with straps and bright buttons. Her pale-blue beaver hat  was covered with pale-blue feathers. She wore a gold ring with a  turquoise in it, a silver bracelet with a monogram on it, a little  gun-metal watch pinned to her coat with a gun-metal pin, and a long  string of blue beads from which dangled a locket.    Maida noticed all this decoration with envy, for she herself was  never permitted to wear jewelry. Occasionally, Granny would let her  wear one string from a big box of bead necklaces which Maida had  bought in Venice.    \"How much is that candy?\" the girl asked, pointing to one of the  trays.    Maida told her.    \"Dear me, haven't you anything better than that?\"    Maida gave her all her prices.    \"I'm afraid there's nothing good enough here,\" the little girl went  on disdainfully. \"My mother won't let me eat cheap candy. Generally,  she has a box sent over twice a week from Boston. But the one we  expected to-day didn't come.\"    \"The little girl likes to make people think that she has nicer  things than anybody else,\" Maida thought. She started to speak. If  she had permitted herself to go on, she would have said: \"The candy  in this shop is quite good enough for any little girl. But I won't  sell it to you, anyway.\" But, instead, she said as quietly as she  could: \"No, I don't believe there's anything here that you'll care  for. But I'm sure you'll find lots of expensive candy on Main  Street.\"    The little girl evidently was not expecting that answer. She  lingered, still looking into the show case. \"I guess I'll take five  cents' worth of peppermints,\" she said finally. Some of the  importance had gone out of her voice.    Maida put the candy into a bag and handed it to her without  speaking. The girl bustled towards the door. Half-way, she stopped  and came back.    \"My name is Laura Lathrop,\" she said. \"What's yours?\"    \"Maida.\"    \"Maida?\" the girl repeated questioningly. \"Maida?--oh, yes, I  know--Maida Flynn. Where did you live before you came here?\"    \"Oh, lots of places.\"    \"But where?\" Laura persisted.    \"Boston, New York, Newport, Pride's Crossing, the Adirondacks,  Europe.\"    \"Oh, my! Have you been to Europe?\" Laura's tone was a little  incredulous.    \"I lived abroad a year.\"    \"Can you speak French?\"    \"Oui, Mademoiselle, je parle Francais un peu.\"    \"Say some more,\" Laura demanded.    Maida smiled. \"Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq, six, sept, huit, neuf,  dix, onze, douze--\"    Laura looked impressed. \"Do you speak any other language?\"    \"Italian and German--a very little.\"    Laura stared hard at her and her look was full of question. But it  was evident that she decided to believe Maida.    \"I live in Primrose Court,\" she said, and now there was not a shadow  of condescension left in her voice. \"That large house at the back  with the big lawn about it. I'd like to have you come and play with  me some afternoon. I'm very busy most of the time, though. I take  music and fancy dancing and elocution. Next winter, I'm going to  take up French. I'll send you word some afternoon when I have time  to play.\"    \"Thank you,\" Maida said in her most civil voice. \"Come and play with  me sometime,\" she added after a pause.    \"Oh, my mother doesn't let me play in other children's houses,\"  Laura said airily. \"Good-bye.\"    \"Good-bye,\" Maida answered.    She waited until Laura had disappeared into the court. \"Granny,\" she  called impetuously, \"a little girl's been here who I think is the  hatefullest, horridest, disagreeablest thing I ever saw in my life.\"    \"Why, what did the choild do?\" Granny asked in surprise.    \"Do?\" Maida repeated. \"She did everything. Why, she--she--\" She  interrupted herself to think hard a moment. \"Well, it's the queerest  thing. I can't tell you a thing she did, Granny, and yet, all the  time she was here I wanted to slap her.\"    \"There's manny folks that-a-way,\" said Granny. \"The woisest way is  to take no notuce av ut.\"    \"Take no notice of it!\" Maida stormed. \"It's just like not taking  any notice of a bee when it's stinging you.\"    Maida was so angry that she walked into the living-room without  limping.    At four that afternoon, when the children came out of school, there  was another flurry of trade. Towards five, it slackened. Maida sat  in her swivel-chair and wistfully watched the scene in the court.  Little boys were playing top. Little girls were jumping rope. Once  she saw a little girl in a scarlet cape come out of one of the  yards. On one shoulder perched a fluffy kitten. Following her,  gamboled an Irish setter and a Skye terrier. Presently it grew dark  and the children began to go indoors. Maida lighted the gas and lost  herself in \"Gulliver's Travels.\"    The sound of voices attracted her attention after awhile. She turned  in her chair. Outside, staring into the window, stood a little boy  and girl--a ragged, dirty pair. Their noses pressed so hard against  the glass that they were flattened into round white circles. They  took no notice of Maida. Dropping her eyes to her book, she  pretended to read.    \"I boneys that red top, first,\" said the little boy in a piping  voice.    He was a round, brown, pop-eyed, big-mouthed little creature. Maida  could not decide which he looked most like--a frog or a brownie. She  christened him \"the Bogle\" at once.    \"I boneys that little pink doll with the curly hair, first,\" said  the girl.    She was a round, brown little creature, too--but pretty. She had  merry brown eyes and a merry little red and white smile. Maida  christened her \"the Robin.\"    \"I boneys that big agate, second,\" said the Bogle.    \"I boneys that little table, second,\" said the Robin.    \"I boneys that knife, third,\" said the Bogle.    \"I boneys that little chair, third,\" said the Robin.    Maida could not imagine what kind of game they were playing. She  went to the door. \"Come in, children,\" she called.    The children jumped and started to run away. But they stopped a  little way off, turned and stood as if they were not certain what to  do. Finally the Robin marched over to Maida's side and the Bogle  followed.    \"Tell me about the game you were playing,\" Maida said. \"I never  heard of it before.\"    \"'Tain't any game,\" the Bogle said.    \"We were just boneying,\" the Robin explained. \"Didn't you ever boney  anything?\"    \"No.\"    \"Why, you boneys things in store windows,\" the Robin went on. \"You  always boney with somebody else. You choose one thing for yours and  they choose something else for theirs until everything in the window  is all chosen up. But of course they don't really belong to you. You  only play they do.\"    \"I see,\" Maida said.    She went to the window and took out the red top and the little pink  doll with curly hair. \"Here, these are the things you boneyed first.  You may have them.\"    \"Oh, thank you--thank you--thank you,\" the Robin exclaimed. She kissed  the little pink doll ecstatically, stopping now and then to look  gratefully at Maida.    \"Thank you,\" the Bogle echoed. He did not look at Maida but he began  at once to wind his top.    \"What is your name?\" Maida asked.    \"Molly Doyle,\" the Robin answered. \"And this is my brother, Timmie  Doyle.\"    \"My name's Maida. Come and see me again, Molly, and you, too,  Timmie.\"    \"Of course I'll come,\" Molly answered, \"and I'm going to name my  doll 'Maida.'\"    Molly ran all the way home, her doll tightly clutched to her breast.  But Timmie stopped to spin his top six times--Maida counted.    No more customers came that evening. At six, Maida closed and locked  the shop.    After dinner she thought she would read one of her new books. She  settled herself in her little easy chair by the fire and opened to a  story with a fascinating picture. But the moment her eyes fell on  the page--it was the strangest thing--a drowsiness, as deep as a  fairy's enchantment, fell upon her. She struggled with it for  awhile, but she could not throw it off. The next thing she knew,  Granny was helping her up the stairs, was undressing her, had laid  her in her bed. The next thing she was saying dreamily, \"I made one  dollar and eighty-seven cents to-day. If my papa ever gets into any  more trouble in Wall Street, he can borrow from me.\"    The next thing, she felt the pillow soft and cool under her cheek.  The next thing--bright sunlight was pouring through the window--it was  morning again.                                  CHAPTER IV: THE SECOND DAY      It had rained all that night, but the second morning dawned the  twinklingest kind of day. It seemed to Maida that Mother Nature had  washed a million tiny, fleecy, white clouds and hung them out to dry  in the crisp blue air. Everything still dripped but the brilliant  sunshine put a sparkle on the whole world. Slates of old roofs  glistened, brasses of old doors glittered, silver of old name-plates  shone. Curbstones, sidewalks, doorsteps glimmered and gleamed. The  wet, ebony-black trunks of the maples smoked as if they were afire,  their thick-leaved, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17546"],[0,"The Lion of Saint Mark: A Story of Venice in the Fourteenth Century (#7)"],[1,"of the hut and bored another hole, so as  to obtain a view of the faces of those whose backs had before been  towards him.    One of these was Ruggiero Mocenigo. Another was a stranger to Francis,  and some difference in the fashion of his garments indicated that he  was not a Venetian, but, Francis thought, a Hungarian. The other three  were not nobles. One of them Francis recognized, as being a man of much  influence among the fishermen and sailors. The other two were unknown  to him.    As upwards of an hour had been spent in making the two holes and taking  observations, Francis thought it better now to make his way back to his  boat, especially as it was evident that he would gain nothing by  remaining longer. Therefore, after taking the same precautions as  before, to conceal all signs of his presence, he made his way across  the sands back to his gondola.    \"Heaven be praised, you are back again!\" Giuseppi said, when he heard  his low whistle, as he came down to the boat. \"I have been in a fever  ever since I lost sight of you. Have you succeeded?\"    \"I have found out that there is certainly a plot of some sort being got  up, and I know some of those concerned in it, but I could hear nothing  that went on. Still, I have succeeded better than I expected, and I am  well satisfied with the night's work.\"    \"I hope you won't come again, Messer Francisco. In the first place, you  may not always have the fortune to get away unseen. In the next place,  it is a dangerous matter to have to do with conspiracies, whichever  side you are on. The way to live long in Venice is to make no enemies.\"    \"Yes, I know that, Giuseppi, and I haven't decided yet what to do in  the matter.\"    A quarter of an hour later, their fare returned to the boat. This time  they took a long detour, and, entering Venice by one of the many  canals, reached the landing place without adventure. The stranger  handed Giuseppi a ducat.    \"I do not know when I shall want you again; but I will mark the hour,  as agreed, on the pillar. Do not fail to go there every afternoon; and  even if you don't see it, you might as well come round here at half  past ten of a night. I may want you suddenly.\"    Before going to sleep that night, Francis thought the matter over  seriously, and finally concluded that he would have no more to do with  it. No doubt, by crossing over to San Nicolo in the daytime, he might  be able to loosen a plank at the back of the hut, or to cut so large an  opening that he could hear, as well as see, what was going on within;  but supposing he discovered that a plot was on hand in favour of the  enemies of Venice, such as Padua or Hungary, what was he to do next? At  the best, if he denounced it, and the officers of the republic  surrounded the hut when the conspirators were gathered there, arrested  them, and found upon them, or in their houses, proofs sufficient to  condemn them, his own position would not be enviable. He would gain,  indeed, the gratitude of the republic; but as for rewards, he had no  need of them. On the other hand, he would draw upon himself the enmity  of some eight or ten important families, and all their connections and  followers, and his life would be placed in imminent danger. They would  be all the more bitter against him, inasmuch as the discovery would not  have been made by accident, but by an act of deliberate prying into  matters which concerned him in no way, he not being a citizen of the  republic.    So far his action in the matter had been a mere boyish freak; and now  that he saw it was likely to become an affair of grave importance,  involving the lives of many persons, he determined to have nothing  further to do with it.        Chapter 3: On The Grand Canal.      Giuseppi, next morning, heard the announcement of the determination of  Francis, to interfere no further in the matter of the conspiracy at San  Nicolo, with immense satisfaction. For the last few nights he had  scarcely slept, and whenever he dozed off, dreamed either of being  tortured in dungeons, or of being murdered in his gondola; and no money  could make up for the constant terrors which assailed him. In his  waking moments he was more anxious for his employer than for himself,  for it was upon him that the vengeance of the conspirators would fall,  rather than upon a young gondolier, who was only obeying the orders of  his master.    It was, then, with unbounded relief that he heard Francis had decided  to go no more out to San Nicolo.    During the next few days Francis went more frequently than usual to the  Piazza of Saint Mark, and had no difficulty in recognizing there the  various persons he had seen in the hut, and in ascertaining their names  and families. One of the citizens he had failed to recognize was a  large contractor in the salt works on the mainland. The other was the  largest importer of beasts for the supply of meat to the markets of the  city.    Francis was well satisfied with the knowledge he had gained. It might  never be of any use to him, but it might, on the other hand, be of  importance when least expected.    As a matter of precaution he drew up an exact account of the  proceedings of the two nights on the lagoons, giving an account of the  meeting, and the names of the persons present, and placed it in a  drawer in his room. He told Giuseppi what he had done.    \"I do not think there is the least chance of our ever being recognized,  Giuseppi. There was not enough light for the man to have made out our  features. Still there is nothing like taking precautions, and if--I  don't think it is likely, mind--but if anything should ever happen to  me--if I should be missing, for example, and not return by the  following morning--you take that paper out of my drawer and drop it  into the Lion's Mouth. Then, if you are questioned, tell the whole  story.\"    \"But they will never believe me, Messer Francisco,\" Giuseppi said in  alarm.    \"They will believe you, because it will be a confirmation of my story;  but I don't think that there is the least chance of our ever hearing  anything further about it.\"    \"Why not denounce them at once without putting your name to it,\"  Giuseppi said. \"Then they could pounce upon them over there, and find  out all about it for themselves?\"    \"I have thought about it, Giuseppi, but there is something treacherous  in secret denunciations. These men have done me no harm, and as a  foreigner their political schemes do not greatly concern me. I should  not like to think I had sent twelve men to the dungeons and perhaps to  death.\"    \"I think it's a pity you ever went there at all, Messer Francisco.\"    \"Well, perhaps it is, Giuseppi; but I never thought it would turn out a  serious affair like this. However, I do wish I hadn't gone now; not  that I think it really matters, or that we shall ever hear anything  more of it. We may, perhaps, some day see the result of this  conspiracy, that is, if its objects are such as I guess them to be;  namely, to form a party opposed to war with Hungary, Padua, or Genoa.\"    For some days after this Francis abstained from late excursions in the  gondola. It was improbable that he or Giuseppi would be recognized did  their late passenger meet them. Still, it was possible that they might  be so; and when he went out he sat quietly among the cushions while  Giuseppi rowed, as it would be a pair-oared gondola the stranger would  be looking for. He was sure that the conspirator would feel uneasy when  the boat did not come to the rendezvous, especially when they found  that, on three successive days, figures were marked as had been  arranged on the column at the corner of the Piazzetta.    Giuseppi learned indeed, a week later, that inquiries had been made  among the gondoliers for a boat rowed by two brothers, Giovanni and  Beppo; and the inquirer, who was dressed as a retainer of a noble  family, had offered five ducats reward for information concerning it.  No such names, however, were down upon the register of gondoliers  licensed to ply for hire. Giuseppi learned that the search had been  conducted quietly but vigorously, and that several young gondoliers who  rowed together had been seen and questioned.    The general opinion, among the boatmen, was that some lady must have  been carried off, and that her friends were seeking for a clue as to  the spot to which she had been taken.    One evening Francis had been strolling on the Piazza with Matteo, and  had remained out later than he had done since the night of his last  visit to San Nicolo. He took his seat in the gondola, and when Giuseppi  asked him if he would go home, said he would first take a turn or two  on the Grand Canal as the night was close and sultry.    There was no moon now, and most of the gondolas carried torches.  Giuseppi was paddling quietly, when a pair-oared gondola shot past  them, and by the light of the torch it carried, Francis recognized the  ladies sitting in it to be Maria and Giulia Polani with their duenna;  two armed retainers sat behind them. They were, Francis supposed,  returning from spending the evening at the house of some of their  friends. There were but few boats now passing along the canal.    Polani's gondola was a considerable distance ahead, when Francis heard  a sudden shout of, \"Mind where you are going!\"    Then there was a crash of two gondolas striking each other, followed by  an outburst of shouts and cries of alarm, with, Francis thought, the  clash of swords.    \"Row, Giuseppi!\" he exclaimed, leaping from his seat and catching up  the other oar; and with swift and powerful strokes the two lads drove  the gondola towards the scene of what was either an accident, or an  attempt at crime.    They had no doubt which it was when they arrived at the spot. A  four-oared gondola lay alongside that of the Polanis, and the  gondoliers with their oars, and the two retainers with their swords,  had offered a stout resistance to an"]]]
