No weight should be placed on  the boards.    Although no paper has hitherto been found that will take so perfect an  impression from colour-blocks as the long-fibred Japanese paper, yet it  should be the aim of all craftsmen to become independent of foreign  materials as far as possible. There is no doubt that our paper-makers  should be able to produce a paper of good quality sufficiently absorbent  to take colour from the wet block and yet tough enough to bear handling  when slightly damp.    If a short-fibred paper is made without size, it comes to pieces when it  is damped for printing. But the amount of absorbency required is not so  great as to preclude the use of size altogether. It is a problem which  our paper-makers could surely solve. A soft, slightly absorbent, white  paper is required. At present nothing has been produced to take the  place of the long mulberry fibre of the Japanese, which prints  perfectly, but it is far from being pure white in colour. A white paper  would have a great advantage in printing high and delicate colour  schemes.      INK    Next in importance is the preparation of the ink for printing the  key-block or any black or grey parts of a design. As a rule the  key-block is printed black, more or less diluted with paste; indeed the  key-block is often printed very faintly by means of paste only just  tinged with a trace of black.    The use of colour for the key-block is treated in Chapter VII. The ink  is prepared as follows. Take a stick of solid Chinese ink of good  quality, and break it with a hammer into fragments; put these to soak in  a pot with water for three or four days. (The quality of the sticks of  Chinese ink varies greatly. The cheap sticks make a coarse and gritty  ink which does not print well.) Day by day pour off the water, adding  fresh, so that the glue that soaks out of the softened black fragments  is removed. Three days is usually long enough for this. If left too long  the whole mass goes bad and is spoiled. When the black mass is soft and  clean drain off the water and rub the ink smooth in a dish with a bone  palette knife. It is then ready for use, but would rapidly go bad if not  used up at once, so that a preservative is necessary to keep a stock of  ink in good condition. An effective method is to put the ink at once  into a well-corked, wide-mouthed bottle. To the under side of the cork  is nailed a little wad of unsized paper soaked with creosote. By this  means ink can be kept in perfect condition for weeks or months. A drop  of fresh creosote should occasionally be put on the wad fixed to the  cork.    [Illustration: FIG. 18.--Cork of ink-bottle with wad for  preservative.]    Fresh ink may at any time be obtained rapidly in small quantities by  rubbing down a stick of Chinese ink on a slab in the ordinary way, but  this is very laborious, and is only worth while if one needs a small  quantity of a glossy black, for which the rubbed-down ink containing all  its glue is the best.      COLOUR    Any colour that can be obtained in a fine dry powder may be used in  wood-block printing. Some artists have succeeded in using ordinary  water colours sold in tubes, by mixing the colour with the rice paste  before printing; but the best results are obtained by the use of pure,  finely ground dry colour mixed only with water, the rice paste being  added actually on the block.    Most of the artists' colour merchants supply colour by weight in the  form of dry powder: any colour that is commonly used in oil or  water-colour painting may be obtained in this state. A stock of useful  colours should be kept in wide-necked bottles.    A few shallow plates or small dishes are needed to hold colour and a  bone or horn palette knife for mixing and rubbing the colour into a  smooth paste in the dishes. Small bone paper knives are useful for  taking colour from the bottles.    When the colour scheme of a print is made certain--and this is best done  by printing small experimental batches--it is a good plan to have a  number of covered pots equal to the number of the different colour  impressions, and to fill these with a quantity of each tint, the colour  or colours being mixed smoothly with water to the consistency of stiff  cream.    Some colours will be found to print more smoothly and easily than  others. Yellow ochre, for instance, prints with perfect smoothness and  ease, while heavier or more gritty colours tend to separate and are more  difficult. In the case of a very heavy colour such as vermilion, a drop  of glue solution will keep the colour smooth for printing, and less  paste is necessary. But most colours will give good impressions by means  of rice paste alone. It is essential, however, that only very finely  ground colours of good quality should be used.      PASTE    A paste must be used with the colour in order to hold it on to the  surface of the paper and to give brilliancy. The colour, if printed  without paste, would dry to powder again. The paste also preserves the  matt quality which is characteristic of the Japanese prints.    Finely ground rice flour may be obtained from grocery dealers. An  excellent French preparation of rice sold in packets as _Creme de Riz_  is perfect for the purpose of making paste for printing. It should be  carefully made as follows: While half a pint of water is put to boil in  a saucepan over a small spirit lamp or gas burner, mix in a cup about  two teaspoonfuls of rice flour with water, added little by little until  a smooth cream is made with no lumps in it. A bone spoon is good for  this purpose. Pour this mixture into the boiling water in the saucepan  all at once, and stir well till it boils again, after which it should be  left simmering over a small flame for five minutes.    When the paste has cooled it should be smooth and almost fluid enough to  pour: not stiff like a pudding.    While printing, a little paste is put out in a saucer and replenished  from time to time.    Fresh paste should be made every day.          CHAPTER VI           Detailed Method of Printing      Success in printing depends very much on care and orderliness. It is  necessary to keep to a fixed arrangement of the position of everything  on the work-table and to have all kept as clean as possible. To see the  deft and unhurried work of a Japanese craftsman at printing is a great  lesson, and a reproach to Western clumsiness.    The positions indicated by the diagram on page 11 will be found to be  practical and convenient.    The special tools used in printing are the \"baren\" or printing pad,  which is the only instrument of pressure used, and the printing  brushes.      THE BAREN OR PRINTING PAD    As made by the Japanese, the baren is about five inches in diameter, and  consists of a circular board upon which a flat coil of cord or twisted  fibre is laid. This is held in place by a covering made of a strip of  bamboo-sheath, the two ends of which are twisted and brought together at  the back of the board so as to form a handle. The flat surface of the  bamboo-sheath is on the under side of the pad when the handle is  uppermost. The ribbed bamboo-sheath is impervious to the dampness of the  paper in printing, and the pad may be used to rub and press directly on  the back of the damp paper as it lies on the block without any  protective backing sheet. The collotype reproduction facing page 12  shows the shape and character of the baren.    Japanese printing pads may be obtained from some of the artists'  colour-men, or from Japan through various agencies. They are by far the  best instrument for the purpose. A pad lasts a considerable time, and  when the bamboo sheath wears through may be re-covered as described  below. If the new bamboo sheath is unobtainable, the baren may be  re-covered by a sheet of vegetable parchment (of the kind used for  covering pots of jam), laid on when wet, and twisted and bound at the  end like the original bamboo covering. A baren used and re-covered when  worn will last for an indefinite time in this way.      TO RE-COVER A WORN BAREN WITH BAMBOO SHEATH    Damp the new leaf in water with a brush on both sides thoroughly.    Wipe dry both sides. Lay it on a flat surface and stretch wider with the  fingers on the inside, keeping the leaf flat with the palm of the hand.    Rub the inside of the leaf with something hard and smooth across the  width on both sides.    1. Cut AG, BG with leaf folded.    2. Place the round pad in position on the flat leaf.    3. Stretch the leaf to lap at sides EF.    4. Turn in EA and BF fold by fold, first one side and then the other.    5. Pull hard before beginning the other end.    [Illustration: FIG. 19.--Method of re-covering baren.]    6. Cut away CH, DH, holding down firmly the end done.    7. Twist up the ends tightly, pull over to the centre, and tie tightly  together; cut off ends.    8. Polish on board and oil slightly.    Twist the inside part of the baren occasionally to save wear by changing  its position within the sheath.    Several substitutes have been tried in place of the Japanese baren,  with coverings of leather, shark's skin, celluloid, and various other  materials, but these necessitate the use of a backing sheet to protect  the paper from their harsh surfaces.    An ingenious rubber of ribbed glass which works directly on the paper  has been devised by Mr. William Giles, who has produced beautiful  results by its means.    If one is using the Japanese baren, its surface needs to be kept very  slightly oiled to enable it to run freely over the damp paper. A pad of  paper with a drop of sweet oil suffices for this, and may lie on the  right of the printing block where the baren is put after each impression  is taken.    An even simpler method is that of the Japanese craftsman who rubs the  baren from time to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/202"],[0,"My Bondage and My Freedom (#7)"],[1,"so esteem them. In a word, he is, for  the most part of the first eight years of his life, a spirited, joyous,  uproarious, and happy boy, upon whom troubles fall only like water on a  duck's back. And such a boy, so far as I can now remember, was the boy  whose life in slavery I am now narrating.          CHAPTER II. _Removed from My First Home_    THE NAME \"OLD MASTER\" A TERROR--COLONEL LLOYD'S PLANTATION--WYE  RIVER--WHENCE ITS NAME--POSITION OF THE LLOYDS--HOME ATTRACTION--MEET  OFFERING--JOURNEY FROM TUCKAHOE TO WYE RIVER--SCENE ON REACHING OLD  MASTER'S--DEPARTURE OF GRANDMOTHER--STRANGE MEETING OF SISTERS AND  BROTHERS--REFUSAL TO BE COMFORTED--SWEET SLEEP.      That mysterious individual referred to in the first chapter as an object  of terror among the inhabitants of our little cabin, under the ominous  title of \"old master,\" was really a man of some consequence. He owned  several farms in Tuckahoe; was the chief clerk and butler on the home  plantation of Col. Edward Lloyd; had overseers on his own farms; and  gave directions to overseers on the farms belonging to Col. Lloyd.  This plantation is situated on Wye river--the river receiving its name,  doubtless, from Wales, where the Lloyds originated. They (the Lloyds)  are an old and honored family in Maryland, exceedingly wealthy. The home  plantation, where they have resided, perhaps for a century or more, is  one of the largest, most fertile, and best appointed, in the state.    About this plantation, and about that queer old master--who must be  something more than a man, and something worse than an angel--the reader  will easily imagine that I was not only curious, but eager, to know all  that could be known. Unhappily for me, however, all the information  I could get concerning him increased my great dread of being carried  thither--of being{34} separated from and deprived of the protection of  my grandmother and grandfather. It was, evidently, a great thing to go  to Col. Lloyd's; and I was not without a little curiosity to see the  place; but no amount of coaxing could induce in me the wish to remain  there. The fact is, such was my dread of leaving the little cabin, that  I wished to remain little forever, for I knew the taller I grew the  shorter my stay. The old cabin, with its rail floor and rail bedsteads  upstairs, and its clay floor downstairs, and its dirt chimney, and  windowless sides, and that most curious piece of workmanship dug in  front of the fireplace, beneath which grandmammy placed the sweet  potatoes to keep them from the frost, was MY HOME--the only home I ever  had; and I loved it, and all connected with it. The old fences around  it, and the stumps in the edge of the woods near it, and the squirrels  that ran, skipped, and played upon them, were objects of interest and  affection. There, too, right at the side of the hut, stood the old well,  with its stately and skyward-pointing beam, so aptly placed between the  limbs of what had once been a tree, and so nicely balanced that I could  move it up and down with only one hand, and could get a drink myself  without calling for help. Where else in the world could such a well be  found, and where could such another home be met with? Nor were these  all the attractions of the place. Down in a little valley, not far from  grandmammy's cabin, stood Mr. Lee's mill, where the people came often in  large numbers to get their corn ground. It was a watermill; and I never  shall be able to tell the many things thought and felt, while I sat on  the bank and watched that mill, and the turning of that ponderous wheel.  The mill-pond, too, had its charms; and with my pinhook, and thread  line, I could get _nibbles_, if I could catch no fish. But, in all my  sports and plays, and in spite of them, there would, occasionally, come  the painful foreboding that I was not long to remain there, and that I  must soon be called away to the home of old master.    I was A SLAVE--born a slave and though the fact was in{35 DEPARTURE FROM  TUCKAHOE} comprehensible to me, it conveyed to my mind a sense of my  entire dependence on the will of _somebody_ I had never seen; and, from  some cause or other, I had been made to fear this somebody above all  else on earth. Born for another's benefit, as the _firstling_ of the  cabin flock I was soon to be selected as a meet offering to the fearful  and inexorable _demigod_, whose huge image on so many occasions haunted  my childhood's imagination. When the time of my departure was decided  upon, my grandmother, knowing my fears, and in pity for them, kindly  kept me ignorant of the dreaded event about to transpire. Up to the  morning (a beautiful summer morning) when we were to start, and, indeed,  during the whole journey--a journey which, child as I was, I remember as  well as if it were yesterday--she kept the sad fact hidden from me. This  reserve was necessary; for, could I have known all, I should have  given grandmother some trouble in getting me started. As it was, I was  helpless, and she--dear woman!--led me along by the hand, resisting,  with the reserve and solemnity of a priestess, all my inquiring looks to  the last.    The distance from Tuckahoe to Wye river--where my old master lived--was  full twelve miles, and the walk was quite a severe test of the endurance  of my young legs. The journey would have proved too severe for me,  but that my dear old grandmother--blessings on her memory!--afforded  occasional relief by \"toting\" me (as Marylanders have it) on her  shoulder. My grandmother, though advanced in years--as was evident  from more than one gray hair, which peeped from between the ample and  graceful folds of her newly-ironed bandana turban--was yet a woman of  power and spirit. She was marvelously straight in figure, elastic, and  muscular. I seemed hardly to be a burden to her. She would have \"toted\"  me farther, but that I felt myself too much of a man to allow it, and  insisted on walking. Releasing dear grandmamma from carrying me, did not  make me altogether independent of her, when we happened to pass through  portions of the somber woods which lay between Tuckahoe and{36} Wye  river. She often found me increasing the energy of my grip, and holding  her clothing, lest something should come out of the woods and eat me up.  Several old logs and stumps imposed upon me, and got themselves taken  for wild beasts. I could see their legs, eyes, and ears, or I could see  something like eyes, legs, and ears, till I got close enough to them to  see that the eyes were knots, washed white with rain, and the legs were  broken limbs, and the ears, only ears owing to the point from which they  were seen. Thus early I learned that the point from which a thing is  viewed is of some importance.    As the day advanced the heat increased; and it was not until the  afternoon that we reached the much dreaded end of the journey. I found  myself in the midst of a group of children of many colors; black,  brown, copper colored, and nearly white. I had not seen so many children  before. Great houses loomed up in different directions, and a great many  men and women were at work in the fields. All this hurry, noise, and  singing was very different from the stillness of Tuckahoe. As a new  comer, I was an object of special interest; and, after laughing and  yelling around me, and playing all sorts of wild tricks, they (the  children) asked me to go out and play with them. This I refused to do,  preferring to stay with grandmamma. I could not help feeling that our  being there boded no good to me. Grandmamma looked sad. She was soon to  lose another object of affection, as she had lost many before. I knew  she was unhappy, and the shadow fell from her brow on me, though I knew  not the cause.    All suspense, however, must have an end; and the end of mine, in this  instance, was at hand. Affectionately patting me on the head, and  exhorting me to be a good boy, grandmamma told me to go and play with  the little children. \"They are kin to you,\" said she; \"go and play with  them.\" Among a number of cousins were Phil, Tom, Steve, and Jerry, Nance  and Betty.    Grandmother pointed out my brother PERRY, my sister SARAH, and my sister  ELIZA, who stood in the group. I had never seen{37 BROTHERS AND SISTERS}  my brother nor my sisters before; and, though I had sometimes heard of  them, and felt a curious interest in them, I really did not understand  what they were to me, or I to them. We were brothers and sisters, but  what of that? Why should they be attached to me, or I to them? Brothers  and sisters we were by blood; but _slavery_ had made us strangers. I  heard the words brother and sisters, and knew they must mean something;  but slavery had robbed these terms of their true meaning. The experience  through which I was passing, they had passed through before. They had  already been initiated into the mysteries of old master's domicile, and  they seemed to look upon me with a certain degree of compassion; but my  heart clave to my grandmother. Think it not strange, dear reader, that  so little sympathy of feeling existed between us. The conditions of  brotherly and sisterly feeling were wanting--we had never nestled and  played together. My poor mother, like many other slave-women, had many  _children_, but NO FAMILY! The domestic hearth, with its holy lessons  and precious endearments, is abolished in the case of a slave-mother  and her children. \"Little children, love one another,\" are words seldom  heard in a slave cabin.    I really wanted to play with my brother and sisters, but they were  strangers to me, and I was full of fear that grandmother might leave  without taking me with her. Entreated to do so, however, and that, too,  by my dear grandmother, I went to the back part of the house, to play  with them and the other children. _Play_, however, I did not, but stood  with my back against the wall, witnessing the playing of the others.  At last, while "]]]
