Quantae diducto subsidunt aequore valles!     Jam jam tacturas Tartara nigra putes.     Quocunque adspicio, nihil est nisi pontus et aether;     Fluctibus hic tumidis, nubibus ille minax....    More there was of it in my head; but this much was an accurate statement  of my case; and yet less so now (I was thankful to reflect) than in  the morning, when every wave was indeed a mountain, and its trough a  Tartarus. I had learnt the lines at school; nay, they had formed my very  earliest piece of Latin repetition. And how sharply I saw the room I  said them in, the man I said them to, ever since my friend! I figured  him even now hearing Ovid rep., the same passage in the same room. And I  lay saying it on a hen-coop in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean!    At last I fell into a deep sleep, a long unconscious holiday of the  soul, undefiled by any dream.    They say that our dreaming is done as we slowly wake; then was I out of  the way of it that night, for a sudden violent rocking awoke me in  one horrid instant. I made it worse by the way I started to a sitting  posture. I had shipped some water. I was shipping more. Yet all around  the sea was glassy; whence then the commotion? As my ship came trim  again, and I saw that my hour was not yet, the cause occurred to me; and  my heart turned so sick that it was minutes before I had the courage to  test my theory.    It was the true one.    A shark had been at my trailing fowls; had taken the bunch of them  together, dragging the legs from my loose fastenings. Lucky they had  been no stronger! Else had I been dragged down to perdition too.    Lucky, did I say? The refinement of cruelty rather; for now I had  neither meat nor drink; my throat was a kiln; my tongue a flame; and  another day at hand.    The stars were out; the sea was silver; the sun was up!             .        .         .         .         .    Hours passed.    I was waiting now for my delirium.    It came in bits.    I was a child. I was playing on the lawn at home. I was back on the  blazing sea.    I was a schoolboy saying my Ovid; then back once more.    The hen-coop was the Lady Jermyn. I was at Eva Denison's side. They were  marrying us on board. The ship's bell was ringing for us; a guitar in  the background burlesqued the Wedding March under skinny fingers; the  air was poisoned by a million cigarettes, they raised a pall of smoke  above the mastheads, they set fire to the ship; smoke and flame covered  the sea from rim to rim, smoke and flame filled the universe; the sea  dried up, and I was left lying in its bed, lying in my coffin, with  red-hot teeth, because the sun blazed right above them, and my withered  lips were drawn back from them for ever.    So once more I came back to my living death; too weak now to carry a  finger to the salt water and back to my mouth; too weak to think of Eva;  too weak to pray any longer for the end, to trouble or to care any more.    Only so tired.             .         .         .         .         .    Death has no more terrors for me. I have supped the last horror of the  worst death a man can die. You shall hear now for what I was delivered;  you shall read of my reward.    My floating coffin was many things in turn; a railway carriage, a  pleasure boat on the Thames, a hammock under the trees; last of all it  was the upper berth in a not very sweet-smelling cabin, with a clatter  of knives and forks near at hand, and a very strong odor of onions in  the Irish stew.    My hand crawled to my head; both felt a wondrous weight; and my head  was covered with bristles no longer than those on my chin, only less  stubborn.    \"Where am I?\" I feebly asked.    The knives and forks clattered on, and presently I burst out crying  because they had not heard me, and I knew that I could never make them  hear. Well, they heard my sobs, and a huge fellow came with his mouth  full, and smelling like a pickle bottle.    \"Where am I?\"    \"Aboard the brig Eliza, Liverpool, homeward bound; glad to see them eyes  open.\"    \"Have I been here long?\"    \"Matter o' ten days.\"    \"Where did you find me?\"    \"Floating in a hen-coop; thought you was a dead 'un.\"    \"Do you know what ship?\"    \"Do we know? No, that's what you've got to tell us!\"    \"I can't,\" I sighed, too weak to wag my head upon the pillow.    The man went to my cabin door.    \"Here's a go,\" said he; \"forgotten the name of his blessed ship, he has.  Where's that there paper, Mr. Bowles? There's just a chance it may be  the same.\"    \"I've got it, sir.\"    \"Well, fetch it along, and come you in, Mr. Bowles; likely you may think  o' somethin'.\"    A reddish, hook-nosed man, with a jaunty, wicked look, came and smiled  upon me in the friendliest fashion; the smell of onions became more than  I knew how to endure.    \"Ever hear of the ship Lady Jermyn?\" asked the first corner, winking at  the other.    I thought very hard, the name did sound familiar; but no, I could not  honestly say that I had beard it before.    The captain looked at his mate.    \"It was a thousand to one,\" said he; \"still we may as well try him with  the other names. Ever heard of Cap'n Harris, mister?\"    \"Not that I know of.\"    \"Of Saunderson-stooard?\"    \"No.\"    \"Or Crookes-quartermaster.\"    \"Never.\"    \"Nor yet of Ready--a passenger?\"    \"No.\"    \"It's no use goin' on,\" said the captain folding up the paper.    \"None whatever, sir,\" said the mate    \"Ready! Ready!\" I repeated. \"I do seem to have heard that name before.  Won't you give me another chance?\"    The paper was unfolded with a shrug.    \"There was another passenger of the name of San-Santos. Dutchman,  seemin'ly. Ever heard o' him?\"    My disappointment was keen. I could not say that I had. Yet I would not  swear that I had not.    \"Oh, won't you? Well, there's only one more chance. Ever heard of Miss  Eva Denison--\"    \"By God, yes! Have you?\"    I was sitting bolt upright in my bunk. The skipper's beard dropped upon  his chest.    \"Bless my soul! The last name o' the lot, too!\"    \"Have you heard of her?\" I reiterated.    \"Wait a bit, my lad! Not so fast. Lie down again and tell me who she  was.\"    \"Who she was?\" I screamed. \"I want to know where she is!\"    \"I can't hardly say,\" said the captain awkwardly. \"We found the gig o'  the Lady Jermyn the week arter we found you, bein' becalmed like; there  wasn't no lady aboard her, though.\"    \"Was there anybody?\"    \"Two dead 'uns--an' this here paper.\"    \"Let me see it!\"    The skipper hesitated.    \"Hadn't you better wait a bit?\"    \"No, no; for Christ's sake let me see the worst; do you think I can't  read it in your face?\"    I could--I did. I made that plain to them, and at last I had the  paper smoothed out upon my knees. It was a short statement of the last  sufferings of those who had escaped in the gig, and there was nothing  in it that I did not now expect. They had buried Ready first--then my  darling--then her step-father. The rest expected to follow fast enough.  It was all written plainly, on a sheet of the log-book, in different  trembling hands. Captain Harris had gone next; and two had been  discovered dead.    How long I studied that bit of crumpled paper, with the salt spray  still sparkling on it faintly, God alone knows. All at once a peal of  nightmare laughter rattled through the cabin. My deliverers started  back. The laugh was mine.          CHAPTER VI. THE SOLE SURVIVOR      A few weeks later I landed in England, I, who no longer desired to set  foot on any land again.    At nine-and-twenty I was gaunt and gray; my nerves were shattered, my  heart was broken; and my face showed it without let or hindrance from  the spirit that was broken too. Pride, will, courage, and endurance, all  these had expired in my long and lonely battle with the sea. They had  kept me alive-for this. And now they left me naked to mine enemies.    For every hand seemed raised against me, though in reality it was the  hand of fellowship that the world stretched out, and the other was the  reading of a jaundiced eye. I could not help it: there was a poison in  my veins that made me all ingratitude and perversity. The world welcomed  me back, and I returned the compliment by sulking like the recaptured  runaway I was at heart. The world showed a sudden interest in me; so I  took no further interest in the world, but, on the contrary, resented  its attentions with unreasonable warmth and obduracy; and my would-be  friends I regarded as my very worst enemies. The majority, I feel sure,  meant but well and kindly by the poor survivor. But the survivor could  not forget that his name was still in the newspapers, nor blink the fact  that he was an unworthy hero of the passing hour. And he suffered  enough from brazenly meddlesome and self-seeking folk, from impudent and  inquisitive intruders, to justify some suspicion of old acquaintances  suddenly styling themselves old friends, and of distant connections  newly and unduly eager to claim relationship. Many I misjudged, and have  long known it. On the whole, however, I wonder at that attitude of mine  as little as I approve of it.    If I had distinguished myself in any other way, it would have been a  different thing. It was the fussy, sentimental, inconsiderate  interest in one thrown into purely accidental and necessarily painful  prominence--the vulgarization of an unspeakable tragedy--that my soul  abhorred. I confess that I regarded it from my own unique and selfish  point of view. What was a thrilling matter to the world was a torturing  memory to me. The quintessence of the torture was, moreover, my own  secret. It was not the loss of the Lady Jermyn that I could not bear to  speak about; it was my own loss; but the one involved the other. My  loss apart, however, it was plain enough to dwell upon experiences so  terrible and yet so recent as those which I had lived to tell.

And he travelled far and he travelled fast, and he travelled east and  west, north and south, over hills, and dales, and valleys, and  mountains, and woods, and sheepwalks, but never a sign of the missing  castle did he see. Now at last he came to the palace of the King of all  the Mice in the Wide World. And there was a little mousie in a fine  hauberk and a steel cap doing sentry at the front gate, and he was not  for letting Jack in until he had told his errand. And when Jack had told  it, he passed him on to the next mouse sentry at the inner gate; so by  degrees he reached the King's chamber, where he sate surrounded by mice  courtiers.    Now the King of the Mice received Jack very graciously, and said that he  himself knew nothing of the missing Castle, but, as he was King of all  the Mice in the whole world, it was possible that some of his subjects  might know more than he. So he ordered his chamberlain to command a  Grand Assembly for the next morning, and in the meantime he entertained  Jack right royally.    But the next morning, though there were brown mice, and black mice, and  grey mice, and white mice, and piebald mice, from all parts of the  world, they all answered with one breath:    \"If it please your Majesty, we have not seen the missing Castle.\"    Then the King said, \"You must go and ask my elder brother the King of  all the Frogs. He may be able to tell you. Leave your horse here and  take one of mine. It knows the way and will carry you safe.\"    So Jack set off on the King's horse, and as he passed the outer gate he  saw the little mouse sentry coming away, for its guard was up. Now Jack  was a kind-hearted lad, and he had saved some crumbs from his dinner in  order to recompense the little sentry for his kindness. So he put his  hand in his pocket and pulled out the crumbs.    \"Here you are, mousekin,\" he said. \"That's for your trouble!\"    Then the mouse thanked him kindly and asked if he would take him along  to the King of the Frogs.    \"Not I,\" says Jack. \"I should get into trouble with your King.\"    But the mousekin insisted. \"I may be of some use to you,\" it said. So it  ran up the horse's hind leg and up by its tail and hid in Jack's pocket.  And the horse set off at a hard gallop, for it didn't half like the  mouse running over it.    So at last Jack came to the palace of the King of all the Frogs, and  there at the front gate was a frog doing sentry in a fine coat of mail  and a brass helmet. And the frog sentry was for not letting Jack in; but  the mouse called out that they came from the King of all the Mice and  must be let in without delay. So they were taken to the King's chamber,  where he sate surrounded by frog courtiers in fine clothes; but alas!  he had heard nothing of the Castle on golden pillars, and though he  summoned all the frogs of all the world to a Grand Assembly next  morning, they all answered his question with:      \"_Kro kro, Kro kro_\"    which every one knows stands for \"No\" in frog language.    So the King said to Jack, \"There remains but one thing. You must go and  ask my eldest brother, the King of all the Birds. His subjects are  always on the wing, so mayhap they have seen something. Leave the horse  you are riding here, and take one of mine. It knows the way, and will  carry you safe.\"    So Jack set off, and being a kind-hearted lad he gave the frog sentry,  whom he met coming away from his guard, some crumbs he had saved from  his dinner. And the frog asked leave to go with him, and when Jack  refused to take him he just gave one hop on to the stirrup, and a second  hop on to the crupper, and the next hop he was in Jack's other pocket.    Then the horse galloped away like lightning, for it didn't like the  slimy frog coming down \"plop\" on its back.    Well, after a time, Jack came to the palace of the King of all the  Birds, and there at the front gate were a sparrow and a crow marching up  and down with matchlocks on their shoulders. Now at this Jack laughed  fit to split, and the mouse and the frog from his pockets called out:    \"We come from the King! Sirrahs! Let us pass.\"    So that the sentries were right mazed, and let them pass in without more  ado.    But when they came to the King's chamber, where he sate surrounded by  all manner of birds, tomtits, wrens, cormorants, turtle-doves, and the  like, the King said he was sorry, but he had no news of the missing  Castle. And though he summoned all the birds of all the world to a Grand  Assembly next morning, not one of them had seen or heard tell of it.    So Jack was quite disconsolate till the King said, \"But where is the  eagle? I don't see my eagle.\"    Then the Chamberlain--he was a tomtit--stepped forward with a bow and  said:    \"May it please your Majesty he is late.\"    \"Late?\" says the King in a fume. \"Summon him at once.\"    So two larks flew up into the sky till they couldn't be seen and sang  ever so loud, till at last the eagle appeared all in a perspiration from  having flown so fast.    Then the King said, \"Sirrah! Have you seen a missing Castle that stands  upon twelve pillars of gold?\"    And the eagle blinked its eyes and said, \"May it please your Majesty  that is where I've been.\"    Then everybody rejoiced exceedingly, and when the eagle had eaten a  whole calf so as to be strong enough for the journey, he spread his wide  wings, on which Jack stood, with the mouse in one pocket and the frog in  the other, and started to obey the King's order to take the owner back  to his missing Castle as quickly as possible.    And they flew over land and they flew over sea, until at last in the far  distance they saw the Castle standing on its twelve golden pillars. But  all the doors and windows were fast shut and barred, for, see you, the  servant-master who had run away with it had gone out for the day  a-hunting, and he always bolted doors and windows while he was absent  lest some one else should run away with it.    Then Jack was puzzled to think how he should get hold of the golden  snuff-box, until the little mouse said:    \"Let me fetch it. There is always a mouse-hole in every castle, so I am  sure I shall be able to get in.\"    So it went off, and Jack waited on the eagle's wings in a fume; till at  last mousekin appeared.    \"Have you got it?\" shouted Jack, and the little mousie cried:                                 \"Yes!\"    So every one rejoiced exceedingly, and they set off back to the palace  of the King of all the Birds, where Jack had left his horse; for now  that he had the golden snuff-box safe he knew he could get the Castle  back whenever he chose to send the three little red men to fetch it. But  on the way over the sea, while Jack, who was dead tired with standing so  long, lay down between the eagle's wings and fell asleep, the mouse and  the eagle fell to quarrelling as to which of them had helped Jack the  most, and they quarrelled so much that at last they laid the case before  the frog. Then the frog, who made a very wise judge, said he must see  the whole affair from the very beginning; so the mouse brought out the  golden snuff-box from Jack's pocket, and began to relate where it had  been found and all about it. Now, at that very moment Jack awoke, kicked  out his leg, and plump went the golden snuff-box down to the very bottom  of the sea!    \"I thought my turn would come,\" said the frog, and went plump in after  it.    Well, they waited, and waited, and waited for three whole days and three  whole nights; but froggie never came up again, and they had just given  him up in despair when his nose showed above the water.    \"Have you got it?\" they shouted.    \"No!\" says he, with a great gasp.    \"Then what do you want?\" they cried in a rage.    \"My breath,\" says froggie, and with that he sinks down again.    Well, they waited two days and two nights more, and at last up comes the  little frog with the golden snuff-box in its mouth.    Then they all rejoiced exceedingly, and the eagle flew ever so fast to  the palace of the King of the Birds.    But alas and alack-a-day! Jack's troubles were not ended; his mother's  malison was still bringing him ill-luck, for the King of the Birds flew  into a fearsome rage because Jack had not brought the Castle of the  golden pillars back with him. And he said that unless he saw it by eight  o'clock next morning Jack's head should come off as a cheat and a liar.    Then Jack being close to death opened the golden snuff-box, and out  tumbled the three little red men in their three little red caps. They  had recovered their tempers and were quite glad to be back with a master  who knew that they would only, as a rule, work under fear of death; for,  see you, the servant-master had been for ever disturbing their sleep  with opening the box to no purpose.    So before the clock struck eight next morning, there was the Castle on  its twelve golden pillars, and the King of the Birds was fine and  pleased, and let Jack take his horse and ride to the palace of the King  of the Frogs. But there exactly the same thing happened, and poor Jack  had to open the snuff-box again and order the Castle to come to the  palace of the King of the Frogs. At this the little red men were a wee  bit cross; but they said they supposed it could not be helped; so,  though they yawned, they brought the Castle all right, and Jack was  allowed to take his horse and go to the palace of the King of all the  Mice in the World. But here the same thing happened, and the little red  men tumbled out of the golden snuff-box in a real rage, and said fellows  might as well have no sleep at all! However, they did as they were  bidden; they brought the Castle of the golden pillars from the palace of  the King of the Frogs to the palace of the King of the Birds, and Jack  was allowed to take his own horse and ride home.
