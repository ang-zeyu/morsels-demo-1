We were beaten below in no time, for we were scarce prepared  for so sudden an onslaught. There, however, we defended ourselves  stoutly, firing into the hull of the ship alongside, and defending  our ports and entrances from the Spaniards.    \"For a while our case seemed desperate. The Jesus was hard at work,  too; and when she had sunk the ship of the Spanish admiral, she  came up, and gave a broadside into the ship alongside of us. Her  crew ran swiftly back to her; and we, with much rejoicing, poured  on deck again, and began to pay them hotly for their sudden attack  upon us.    \"It was a great fight, and one that would have done your heart  good, to see the three English ships, two of them so small as to be  little more than boats, surrounded by a whole fleet of Spaniards,  while from on shore the guns of the forts played upon us. Had it  not been for those forts, I verily believe that we should have  destroyed the Spanish fleet. Already another large vessel had  followed the example of their admiral's ship, and had gone to the  bottom. Over 540 of their sailors we had, as they have themselves  admitted, slain outright.    \"We were faring well, and had begun to hope that we might get to  find our way out of the toils, when a cry came from the lookout,  who said that the Jesus was hoisting signals of distress, and that  he feared she was sinking.    \"Close as she was lying to a battery, and surrounded by enemies,  our bold captain did not hesitate a minute; but sailed the Minion,  through a crowd of enemies, close to the Jesus. You should have  heard the cheer that the two crews gave each other. It rose above  all the noise of the battle, and would assuredly have done your  heart good. The Jesus was sinking fast, and it was as much as they  could do to tumble into the boats, and to row hastily to our side.  We should have saved them all, but the Spaniards, who dared not lay  us aboard, and who were in no slight degree troubled by the bravery  with which we had fought, set two of their great ships on fire, and  launched them down upon us, preferring to lose two of their own  ships for the sake of capturing or destroying our little bark. The  sight of the ships coming down, in flames, shook the hearts of our  men more than all the fury of the Spaniards had been able to do;  and without waiting for orders, they turned the ship's head for the  mouth of the port.    \"The admiral, who had just come on board, cursed and shouted when  he saw what was being done; but the panic of the fire ships got the  better of the men, and we made off, firing broadsides at the  Spaniards' fleet as we passed through them; and aided by the little  Judith, which stuck to us through the whole of the fight.    \"When we cooled down and came to think of it, we were in no slight  degree ashamed of our desertion of our comrades in the Jesus.  Fortunately the number so left behind was not large; but we knew  that, according to their custom, the Spaniards would put all to  death, and so indeed it afterwards turned out, many of them being  dispatched with horrible tortures.    \"This terrible treatment of the prisoners caused, when it was  known, great indignation; and although Queen Elizabeth did not  declare war with Spain, from that time she gave every countenance  she could to the adventurers who waged war, on their own account,  against her.    \"The Minion suffered severely, packed close as she was with all her  own crew, and a great part of that of the Jesus, vast numbers of  whom were wounded. However, at length a hundred were, at their own  request, landed and left to shift for themselves, preferring to run  the risk of Indians, or even of Spaniards, to continue any longer  amid the horrors on board the ship. I myself, boys, was not one of  that number, and came back to England in her.    \"Truly it was the worst voyage that I ever made, for though fortune  was for a time good to us, and we collected much money; yet in the  end we lost all, and hardly escaped with our lives. It has seemed  to me that this bad fortune was sent as a punishment upon us, for  carrying off the negroes into slavery. Many others thought the  same, and methinks that that was also the opinion of our present  good admiral.\"    \"Did you come out with him, in his further voyages here?\" Ned  asked.    \"I was with him in the Dragon, two years ago, when with the Swanne  she came here. Last year I sailed with him in the Swanne, alone.\"    \"You did not have any very stirring adventures?\"    \"No, we were mainly bent on exploring; but for all that we carried  off many prizes, and might, had we been pilgrims, have bought farms  in Devonshire, and settled down on our share of the prize money;  but there, that is not the way with sailors. Quick come, quick go,  and not one in a hundred that I have ever heard of, however much he  may have taken as his share of prizes, has ever kept it, or  prospered greatly therefrom.\"    It was now evening, and many of the men had betaken themselves to  the water, for a swim. The heat had been great all day, and as it  was their last, they had been pressed at work to get the stores,  which had been landed, again on board ship; and to finish all up,  ready for the division of the party, next day.    \"I do not care for bathing here,\" Ned said, in reply to a sailor,  who asked him why he too did not join in the sport. \"I confess that  I have a dread of those horrible sharks, of which we have heard so  much, and whose black fins we see from time to time.\"    \"I should have thought,\" said the harsh, sneering voice of Giles  Taunton, \"that an Otter would have been a match for a shark. The  swimmers of the South Isles, and indeed the natives here, attack  the sharks without fear. I should have thought that anyone who  prides himself, as you do, upon swimming, would have been equally  willing to encounter them.\"    \"I do not know that I do pride myself on my swimming, Giles  Taunton,\" Ned said composedly; \"at any rate, no one has ever heard  me speak of such abilities as I may have in that way. As to the  natives, they have seen each other fight with sharks, and know how  the matter is gone about. If I were to be present a few times, when  such strife takes place, it may be that I should not shirk from  joining in the sport; but knowing nothing whatever of the method  pursued, or of the manner of attack, I should be worse than a fool,  were I to propose to venture my life in such a sport.\"    Many sailors who were standing round approved of what Ned said.    \"Aye, aye, lad,\" one said, \"no one would think of making his first  jump across the spot where he might be dashed to pieces. Let a man  learn to jump on level ground; and then, when he knows his powers,  he may go across a deep chasm.\"    By this time a good many of the men were out of the water, when  suddenly there arose the cry of, \"Shark!\" from the lookout on the  poop. There was a great rush for the ship, and the excitement on  board was nearly as great as that in the water. Ned quietly dropped  off his jacket and his shoes and, seizing a short boarding pike,  waited to see what would come of it.    It chanced that his friends, the other boys, were farther out than  the men; having, with the ardor of youth, engaged themselves in  races, regardless of the admonition that had frequently been given  them to keep near the ship; for the terror of these water beasts  was very great.    The men all gained the ship in safety, but the shark, which had  come up from a direction in which it would cut them off, was  clearly likely to arrive before the boys could gain the side. At  first it seemed, indeed, that their fate was sealed; but the shark,  who in many respects resembles a cat with a mouse, and seems to  prefer to trifle with its victim to the last, allowed them to get  close to the ship; although, by rapid swimming, it could easily  have seized them before.    The nearest to it, as it approached the ship, was Tom Tressilis,  who was not so good a swimmer as the others; but he had swum  lustily, and with good heart, though his white face showed how  great the effect of the danger was upon him. He had not spoken a  word, since the shark first made its appearance. As he struck  despairingly to gain the ship, from which the sailors were already  casting him ropes, his eye caught that of Ned, who cried to him  cheerily:    \"Keep up your spirits, Tom. I will be with you.\"    As the huge fish swept along, at a distance of some four yards from  the side of the ship, and was already turning on its back, opening  its huge mouth to seize its victim, Ned dived head foremost from  the ship onto him. So great was the force and impetus with which he  struck the creature, that it was fairly driven sideways from its  course, missing by the nearest shave the leg of Tom Tressilis. Ned  himself was half stunned by the force with which his head had  struck the fish, for a shark is not so soft a creature to jump  against as he had imagined; however, he retained consciousness  enough to grasp at the fin of the shark, to which he held on for  half a minute.    By this time the shark was recovering from the effects of the  sudden blow, and Ned was beginning to be able to reflect. In a  moment he plunged the half pike deep into the creature's stomach.  Again and again he repeated the stroke; until the shark, rolling  over in his agony, and striking furiously with his tail, shook Ned  from his hold. He instantly dived beneath the water, and came up at  a short distance. The shark was still striking the water furiously,  the sailors on board were throwing down upon him shot, pieces of  iron, and all sorts of missiles, and some of the best archers were  hastily bringing their bows to the side.    The shark caught sight of his opponent, and instantly rushed at  him. Ned again dived, just before the creature reached him; and,  rising under him, inflicted some more stabs with the pike; then he  again swam"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19207"],[0,"The Firelight Fairy Book (#7)"],[1," thanked the dwarf, and after making sure that he had  plenty of bread and cheese in his knapsack, hurried northwards as fast  as his legs could carry him. Through bramble and brier, through valley  and wooded dale went he, and at dusk he came to a gigantic pine standing  solitary in a rocky field. Wearied with his long journey, the hunter lay  down beneath the pine and slept.    When it was dawn he woke refreshed, and turning his eyes toward the  level rays of the rising sun, began his journey to the east. Presently  he reached a height in the forest, and from this height, he saw, not  very far away, a black turret rising over the ocean of bright leaves. At  high noon he arrived at the castle. It was ruinous and quite deserted;  grass grew in the courtyard and between the bricks of the terrace, and  the oaken door was as soft and rotten as a log that has long been buried  in mire.    Entering the castle, the hunter soon discovered the round room. A table  laden with wonderful treasures stood in the centre of the chamber,  directly under a shower of sunlight pouring through a half-ruined window  in the mildewed wall. How the diamonds and precious stones sparkled and  gleamed!    Now, while the hunter was filling his pockets, the flash of a jewel  lying on the floor happened to catch his eye, and looking down, he saw  that a kind of trail of jewels lay along the floor leading out of the  room. Following the scattered gems,--which had the appearance of having  been spilled from some treasure-casket heaped too high,--the hunter came  to a low door, and opening this door, he discovered a flight of stone  steps leading to the turret. The steps were strewn carelessly with the  finest emeralds, topazes, beryls, moonstones, rubies, and crystal  diamonds.    Remembering the counsel of his friend the dwarf, however, the hunter did  not go up the stairs, but hurried home with his treasure.    When the hunter returned to his country, the wonderful treasures which  he had taken from the castle in the wood made him a very rich man, and  in a short time the news of his prosperity came to the ears of the King.  This King was the wickedest of rogues, and his two best friends, the  Chamberlain and the Chancellor, were every bit as unscrupulous as he.  They oppressed the people with taxes, they stole from the poor, they  robbed the churches; indeed there was no injustice which they were not  ready to commit. So, when the Chamberlain heard of the hunter's wealth,  he--being a direct, straightforward rascal--declared that the simplest  thing to do would be to kill the hunter and take his money.    The Chancellor, who was somewhat more cunning and worldly, declared that  it would be better to throw the hunter into a foul, dark dungeon till he  was ready to buy his freedom with all his wealth.    The King, who was the wickedest and wisest of the precious three,  declared that the best thing to do was to find out whence the hunter had  got his treasure, so that, if there happened to be any left, they could  go and get it. Then of course, they could kill the hunter and take his  treasure too.    Thus it came to pass that by a royal order the hunter was thrown into a  horrible prison, and told that his only hope of release lay in revealing  the origin of his riches. So, after he had been slowly starved and  cruelly beaten, he told of the treasure castle in the wood.    On the following morning, the King, the Chamberlain, and the Chancellor,  taking with them some strong linen bags and some pack mules, rode forth  in quest of the treasure. Great was their joy when they found the  treasure castle and the treasure room just as the hunter had described.  The Chancellor poured the shining gems through his claw-like fingers,  and the King and the Chamberlain threw their arms around each others'  shoulders and danced a jig as well as their age and dignity would  permit. The first fine careless rapture over, they began pouring the  treasure into the linen sacks they had brought with them, and these,  filled to the brim, they carried to the castle door.    Soon not the tiniest gem was left on the table. Suddenly the Chamberlain  happened to catch sight of the gems strewn along the floor.    \"See, see!\" he cried, his voice shrill and greedy. \"There is yet more to  be had!\"    So the three rogues got down on their hands and knees and began stuffing  the stray jewels into their bulging pockets. The trail of jewels led  them across the hall to the little door opening on the stairway, and up  this stairway they scrambled as fast as they could go.    At the top of the stair, in the turret, they found another round room  lit by three narrow, barred windows, and in the centre of this turret  chamber, likewise laden with gold and jewels, they found another ebony  table. With shrieks of delight, the King and the Chancellor and the  Chamberlain ran to this second treasure, and plunged their hands in the  glittering golden mass.    Suddenly, a great bell rang in the castle, a great brazen bell whose  deep clang beat about them in throbbing, singing waves.    \"What's that?\" said the three rogues in one breath, and rushed together  to the door.    It was locked! An instant later there was a heavy explosion which threw  them all to the floor, tossing the treasure over them; and then, wonder  of wonders, the castle turret, with the three rogues imprisoned in it,  detached itself from the rest of the castle, and flew off into the air.  From the barred windows, the King, the Chamberlain, and the Chancellor  saw league upon league of the forest rushing by beneath them. Suddenly  the flying room began to descend swiftly, and landed lightly as a bird  in the middle of a castle courtyard. Strange-looking fellows with human  bodies and heads of horses came rushing toward the enchanted turret, and  seized its prisoners. In a few moments they were brought before the King  to whom the treasure belonged.    Now this King was a brother of the dwarf whom the hunter had rescued  from the pit. He had a little gold crown on his head, and sat on a  little golden throne with cushions of crimson velvet.    \"With what are these three charged?\" said the Dwarf-King.    \"With having tried to rob the treasure castle, Your Majesty,\" replied  one of the horse-headed servitors in a firm, stable tone.    \"Then send for the Lord Chief Justice at once,\" said the Dwarf-King.    The three culprits were left standing uneasily in a kind of cage. They  would have tried to speak, but every time they opened their mouths, one  of the guards gave them a dig in the ribs.    For a space of five minutes there was quiet in the crowded throne-room,  a quiet broken now and then by a veiled cough or the noise of shuffling  feet. Presently, from far away, came the clear, sweet call of silver  trumpets.    \"He's coming! He's coming!\" murmured many voices. A buzz of excitement  filled the room. Several people had to be revived with smelling salts.    The trumpets sounded a second time. The excitement increased.    The trumpets sounded a third time, near at hand. A man's voice announced  in solemn tones, \"The Lord Chief Justice approaches.\"    The audience grew very still. Hardly a rustle or a flutter was heard.  Suddenly the great tapestry curtains which overhung the door parted, and  there appeared, first of all, an usher, clad in red velvet and carrying  a golden wand; then came two golden-haired pages, also clad in red  velvet and carrying a flat black-lacquer box on a velvet cushion. Last  of all came an elderly man dressed in black, and carrying a golden perch  on which sat a fine green parrot. On reaching the centre of the hall,  the parrot flapped its wings, arranged an upstart feather or two, and  then resumed that solemn dignity for which birds and animals are so  justly famous.    With great ceremony the gentleman in black placed the Lord Chief Justice  on a lacquer stand close by the throne of the Dwarf-King.    Trumpets sounded. Two servitors hurried forward with the captive King.    \"Your Venerability,\" spoke the Dwarf-King to the parrot, who watched him  intently out of its round yellow eye, and nodded its head, \"this rascal  has been taken in the act of robbing the treasure castle. What  punishment do you suggest?\"    At these words, the two golden-haired pages, advancing with immense  solemnity, lifted the lacquer box to within reach of the parrot's beak.  The box was full of cards. Over them, swaying from one leg to the other  as he did so, the parrot swept his head.    An icy silence fell over the throng. The King, the Chancellor, and the  Chamberlain quaked in their shoes. Presently the parrot picked out a  card, and the gentleman in black handed it to the Dwarf-King.    \"Prisoner,\" said the Dwarf-King to the other King, \"the Lord Chief  Justice condemns you to be for the rest of your natural life Master  Sweeper of the Palace Chimneys.\"    Discreet applause was heard. The Chancellor was then hurried forward,  and the bird picked out a second card.    \"Prisoner,\" said the Dwarf-King, \"the Lord Chief Justice condemns you to  be for the rest of your natural life Master Washer of the Palace  Windows.\"    More discreet applause was heard. And now the Chamberlain was brought to  the bar. The parrot gave him quite a wicked eye, and hesitated for some  time before drawing a card.    \"Prisoner,\" said the Dwarf-King, reading the card which the parrot had  finally chosen, \"the Lord Chief Justice condemns you for the rest of  your natural life to be Master Beater of the Palace Carpets.\"    Great applause followed this sage judgment.    So the three rogues were led away, and unless you have heard to the  contrary, they are still making up for their wicked lives by enforced  diligence at their tasks. The palace has five hundred and ninety-six  chimneys, eight thousand, seven hundred and fifty-three windows, and  eleven hundred and ninety-nine large dust-gathering carpets, and the  chimneys, windows,"]]]
