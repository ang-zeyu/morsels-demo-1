Still, sixteen  things are essential, of which the following are the most important:         \"Preparing a seat for the god; invoking his presence; bathing the       image; clothing it; putting the string round it; offering perfumes;       flowers; incense; lamps; offerings of fruits and prepared eatables;       betel-nut; prayers; circumambulation. An ordinary worshiper       presents some of the offerings, mutters a short prayer or two,       when circumambulating the image, the rest being done by the       priest.\"[31]    We give one additional specimen of the ritual:         \"As an atonement for unwarily eating or drinking what is forbidden       eight hundred repetitions of the Gayatri prayer should be preceded       by three suppressions of the breath, water being touched during the       recital of the following text: 'The bull roars; he has four horns,       three feet, two heads, seven hands, and is bound by a three-fold       cord; he is the mighty, resplendent being, and pervades mortal       men.'\"[32]    The bull is understood to be justice personified. All Brahmanical  ceremonies exhibit, we may say, ritualism and symbolism run mad.    [Sidenote: Caste.]  The most prominent and characteristic institution of Hinduism is caste.  The power of caste is as irrational as it is unbounded; and it works  almost unmixed evil. The touch--even the shadow--of a low caste man  pollutes. The scriptural precept, \"Honor all men,\" appears to a true  Hindu infinitely absurd. He honors and worships a cow; but he shrinks  with horror from the touch of a Mhar or Mang. Even Brahmans, if they  come from different provinces, will not eat together. Thus Hinduism  separates man from man; it goes on dividing and still dividing; and new  fences to guard imaginary purity are continually added.    [Sidenote: Treatment of women.  Widows.]  The whole treatment of women has gradually become most tyrannical and  unjust. In very ancient days they were held in considerable respect;  but, for ages past, the idea of woman has been steadily sinking lower  and lower, and her rights have been more and more assailed. The burning  of widows has been prohibited by enactment; but the awful rite would in  many places be restored were it not for the strong hand of the British  government. The practice of marrying women in childhood is still  generally--all but universally--prevalent; and when, owing to the zeal  of reformers, a case of widow-marriage occurs, its rarity makes it be  hailed as a signal triumph. Multitudes of the so-called widows were  never really wives, their husbands (so-called) having died in childhood.  Widows are subjected to treatment which they deem worse than death; and  yet their number, it is calculated, amounts to about twenty-one  millions! More cruel and demoralizing customs than exist in India in  regard to women can hardly be found among the lowest barbarians. We are  glad to escape from dwelling on points so exceedingly painful.          IV.    CONTRAST WITH CHRISTIANITY.      The immense difference between the Hindu and Christian religions has  doubtless already frequently suggested itself to the reader. It will not  be necessary, therefore, to dwell on this topic at very great length.  The contrast forces itself upon us at every point.    [Sidenote: The Aryas and Israelites--their probable future, about 1500 B.C.  Contrast of their after-history.]  When, about fifteen centuries B.C., the Aryas were victoriously  occupying the Panjab, and the Israelites were escaping from the \"iron  furnace\" of Egypt, if one had been asked which of the two races would  probably rise to the highest conception of the divine, and contribute  most largely to the well-being of mankind, the answer, quite possibly,  might have been, the Aryas. Egypt, with its brutish idolatries, had  corrupted the faith of the Israelites, and slavery had crushed all  manliness out of them. Yet how wonderful has been their after-history!  Among ancient religions that of the Old Testament stands absolutely  unique, and in the fullness of time it blossomed into Christianity. How  is the marvel to be explained? We cannot account for it except by  ascribing it to a divine election of the Israelites and a providential  training intended to fit them to become the teachers of the world.  \"Salvation is of the Jews.\"    The contrast between the teachings of the Bible and those of the Hindu  books is simply infinite.    [Sidenote: Hindu theology compared with Christian.]  The conception of a purely immaterial Being, infinite, eternal, and  unchangeable, which is that of the Bible regarding God, is entirely  foreign to the Hindu books. Their doctrine is various, but, in every  case, erroneous. It is absolute pantheism, or polytheism, or an  inconsistent blending of polytheism and pantheism, or atheism.    Equally striking is the contrast between Christianity and Hinduism as to  the attributes of God. According to the former, he is omnipresent;  omnipotent; possessed of every excellence--holiness, justice, goodness,  truth. According to the chief Hindu philosophy, the Supreme is devoid of  attributes--devoid of consciousness. According to the popular  conception, when the Supreme becomes conscious he is developed into  three gods, who possess respectively the qualities of truth, passion,  and darkness.    [Sidenote: Conception of God.]  \"God is a Spirit.\" \"God is light.\" \"God is love.\" These sublime  declarations have no counterparts in Hindustan.    He is \"the Father of spirits,\" according to the Bible. According to  Hinduism, the individual spirit is a portion of the divine. Even the  common people firmly believe this.    Every thing is referred by Hinduism to God as its immediate cause. A  Christian is continually shocked by the Hindus ascribing all sin to God  as its source.    [Sidenote: The object of worship.]  The adoration of God as a Being possessed of every glorious excellence  is earnestly commanded in the Bible. \"Thou shalt worship the Lord thy  God; and him only shalt thou serve.\" In India the Supreme is never  worshiped; but any one of the multitudinous gods may be so; and, in  fact, every thing can be worshiped _except_ God. A maxim in the mouth of  every Hindu is the following: \"Where there is faith, there is God.\"  Believe the stone a god and it is so.    [Sidenote: The sense of sin.]  Every sin being traced to God as its ultimate source, the sense of  personal guilt is very slight among Hindus. Where it exists it is  generally connected with ceremonial defilement or the breach of some one  of the innumerable and meaningless rites of the religion. How unlike in  all this is the Gospel! The Bible dwells with all possible earnestness  on the evil of sin, not of ceremonial but moral defilement--the  transgression of the divine law, the eternal law of right.    [Sidenote: Atonement.]  How important a place in the Christian system is held by atonement, the  great atonement made by Christ, it is unnecessary to say. Nor need we  enlarge on the extraordinary power it exercises over the human heart, at  once filling it with contrition, hatred of sin, and overflowing joy. We  turn to Hinduism. Alas! we find that the earnest questionings and higher  views of the ancient thinkers have in a great degree been ignored in  later times. Sacrifice in its original form has passed away. Atonement  is often spoken of; but it is only some paltry device or other, such as  eating the five products of the cow, going on pilgrimage to some sacred  shrine, paying money to the priests, or, it may be, some form of bodily  penance. Such expedients leave no impression on the heart as to the true  nature and essential evil of sin.    [Sidenote: Salvation.  Sanctification.]  Salvation, in the Christian system, denotes deliverance, not only from  the punishment of sin, but from its power, implying a renovation of the  moral nature. The entire man is to be rectified in heart, speech, and  behavior. The perfection of the individual, and, through that, the  perfection of society, are the objects aimed at; and the consummation  desired is the doing of the will of God on earth as it is done in  heaven. Now, of all this, surely a magnificent ideal, we find in  Hinduism no trace whatever.    [Sidenote: Views of life.  The great tenet of Hinduism.]  Christianity is emphatically a religion of hope; Hinduism may be  designated a religion of despair. The trials of life are many and great.  Christianity bids us regard them as discipline from a Father's hand, and  tells us that affliction rightly borne yields \"the peaceable fruits of  righteousness.\" To death the Christian looks forward without fear; to  him it is a quiet sleep, and the resurrection draws nigh. Then comes the  beatific vision of God. Glorified in soul and body, the companion of  angels and saints, strong in immortal youth, he will serve without let  or hinderance the God and Saviour whom he loves. To the Hindu the trials  of life are penal, not remedial. At death his soul passes into another  body. Rightly, every human soul animates in succession eighty-four lacs  (8,400,000) of bodies--the body of a human being, or a beast, or a bird,  or a fish, or a plant, or a stone, according to desert. This weary, all  but endless, round of births fills the mind of a Hindu with the greatest  horror. At last the soul is lost in God as a drop mingles with the  ocean. Individual existence and consciousness then cease. The thought is  profoundly sorrowful that this is the cheerless faith of countless  multitudes. No wonder, though, the great tenet of Hinduism is  this--_Existence is misery._    [Sidenote: The future of the race.  The struggle between good and evil.]  So much for the future of the individual. Regarding the future of the  race Hinduism speaks in equally cheerless terms. Its golden age lies in  the immeasurably distant past; and the further we recede from it the  deeper must we plunge into sin and wretchedness."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16997"],[0,"A Journey through the Kingdom of Oude, Volumes I & II (#7)"],[1,"progress without exciting  alarm. Had a nation, endowed with all the knowledge we have, come  into Europe in the days of Galileo and Copernicus, and attempted to  impart it to the mass of the people, or to the higher classes only,  the same alarm would have been raised, or nearly the same. We must be  content with small, or slow progress; but there are certain branches  of knowledge, highly useful to the people, that are finding their way  among them from our metropolitan establishments, and working good.    I might better have said, that had we come into Greece when Homer was  the Bible of the people, with all our astronomy, chemistry, and  physical science generally, and our literature, blended as it is with  our religion, we should have found our Greek fellow-subjects as  untractable as the Hindoos or Parsees. The fact is, that every  Hindoo, educated through our language in our literature and science,  must be more or less wretched in domestic life, for he cannot feel or  think with his family, or bring them to feel or think with him. The  knowledge which he has acquired satisfies him that the faith to which  they adhere, and which guides them in all their duties, ceremonies,  acts, and habits, is monstrous and absurd; but he can never hope to  impart to them this knowledge, or to alienate them from that faith;  nor does he himself feel any confidence in any other creed: he feels  that he is an isolated being, who can exchange thoughts and feelings  unreservedly with no one. I have seen many estimable Hindoos in this  state, with minds highly gifted and cultivated, and with abilities  for anything. For such men we cannot create communities, nor can they  create them for themselves: they can enjoy their books and  conversation with men who understand and enjoy them like themselves;  but how few are the men of this class with whom they can ever hope to  associate on easy terms! It is not so with Mahommedans. All the  literature and science in the world has no more effect on their faith  than on ours; and their families apprehend no alienation in any  member who may choose to indulge in them; and they indulge in them  little, merely because they do not find that they conduce to secure  them employment and bread.    I think it would be useful if we could get rid of the terms  _education_, _civilization_, &c., and substitute that of _knowledge_.  It would obviate much controversy, for the greater part of our  disputes arise from the vagueness of the terms we use. All would  agree that certain branches of knowledge are useful to certain  classes, and that certain modes are the best for imparting them. The  subject is deeply interesting and important; but I must not indulge  further.

To Sir Erskine Perry,   Chief Justice, Bombay.                  ___________________________________                                         Jhansee, 24th September, 1848.    My Lord,    I feel grateful for the offer contained in your Lordship's letter of  the 16th instant, and no less so for the gracious manner in which it  has been conveyed, and beg to say that I shall be glad to avail  myself of it, and be prepared to proceed to take charge as soon as I  am directed to do so, as I have no arrears in any of my offices to  detain me, and can make them over to any one at the shortest notice,  with the assurance that he will find nothing in them to perplex or  embarrass him.    I shall do my best to carry out your Lordship's views in the new  charge; and though I am not so strong as I could wish, I may, with  prudence, hope to have health for a few years to sustain me in duties  of so much interest.    I hope your Lordship will pardon my taking advantage of the present  occasion to say a few words on the state of affairs in the north-  west, which are now of such absorbing interest. I have been for some  time impressed with the belief that the system of administration in  the Punjaub has created doubts as to the ultimate intention of our  Government with regard to the restoration of the country to the  native ruler when he comes of age. The native aristocracy of the  country seem to have satisfied themselves that our object has been to  retain the country, and that this could be prevented only by timely  resistance. The sending European officers to relieve the chief of  Mooltan, and to take possession of the country and fort, seems to  have removed the last lingering doubt upon this point; and Molraj  seems to have been satisfied that in destroying them he should be  acting according to the wishes of all his class, and all that portion  of the population who might aspire to employment under a native rule.  This was precisely the impression created by precisely the same means  in Afghanistan; and I believe that the notion now generally prevalent  is, that our professed intentions of delivering over the country to  its native ruler were not honest, and that we should have  appropriated the country to ourselves could we have done so.    There are two classes of native Governments in India. In one the  military establishments are all national, and depend entirely upon  the existence of native rule. They are officered by the aristocracy  of the country, chiefly landed, who know that they are not fitted for  either civil or military office under our system, and must be reduced  to beggary or insignificance should our rule be substituted for that  of their native chief. In the other, all the establishments are  foreign, like our own. The Seiks were not altogether of the first  class, like those of Rajpootana and Bundelcund, but they were so for  the most part; and when they saw all offices of trust by degrees  being filled by Captain This and Mr. That, they gave up all hopes of  ever having their share in the administration.    Satisfied that this was our error in Afghanistan, in carrying out the  views of Lord Ellenborough in the Gwalior State, I did everything in  my power to avoid it, and have entirely succeeded, I believe; but it  has not been done without great difficulty. I considered Lord  Hardinge's measures good, as they interposed Hindoo States between us  and a beggarly and fanatical country, which it must be ruinous to our  finances to retain, and into which we could not avoid making  encroachments, however anxious the Government might be to avoid it,  if our borders joined. But I supposed that we should be content with  guiding, controlling, and supervising the native administration, and  not take all the executive upon ourselves to the almost entire  exclusion of the native aristocracy. I had another reason for  believing that Lord Hardinge's measures were wise and prudent. While  we have a large portion of the country under native rulers, their  administration will contrast with ours greatly to our advantage in  the estimation of the people; and we may be sure that, though some  may be against us, many will be for us. If we succeed in sweeping  them all away, or absorbing them, we shall be at the mercy of our  native army, and they will see it; and accidents may possibly occur  to unite them, or a great portion of them, in some desperate act. The  thing is possible, though improbable; and the best provision against  it seems to me to be the maintenance of native rulers, whose  confidence and affection can be engaged, and administrations improved  under judicious management.    The industrial classes in the Punjaub would, no doubt, prefer our  rule to that of the Seiks; but that portion who depend upon public  employment under Government for their subsistence is large in the  Punjaub, and they would nearly all prefer a native rule. They have  evidently persuaded themselves that our intention is to substitute  our own rule; and it is now, I fear, too late to remove the  impression. If your Lordship is driven to annexation, you must be in  great force; and a disposition must be shown on the part of the local  authorities to give the educated aristocracy of the country a liberal  share in the administration.    One of the greatest dangers to be apprehended in India is, I believe,  the disposition on the part of the dominant class to appoint to all  offices members of their own class, to the exclusion of the educated  natives. This has been nobly resisted hitherto; but where every  subaltern thinks himself in a condition to take a wife, and the land  opens no prospect to his children but in the public service, the  competition will become too great.    I trust that your Lordship will pardon my having written so much, and  believe me, with great respect, your Lordship's obedient humble  servant,                    (Signed)     W. H. SLEEMAN.    P.S.--The Commander-in-Chief has asked me, through the Quartermaster-  General, whether any corps can be spared from Bundelcund. I shall say  that we can spare two regiments--one from Nagode, whose place can be  supplied by a wing of the regiment at Nowgow, and one from Jhansee,  whose place can be supplied from the Gwalior Contingent, if your  Lordship sees no objection, as a temporary arrangement.

My Dear Elliot,    A salute of twenty-one guns had been fired here by the King for the  sadly dear victory over Shere Sing, and another has been fired to-day  for the fall of Mooltan. The King continues very ill, but no danger  seems to be apprehended. The disease is accompanied by very untoward  secondary symptoms, which are likely ultimately to destroy him, and  render his life miserable while it lasts. How much of these symptoms  he derives from his birth, and how much from his own excesses, is  uncertain. "]]]
