If the Sun  shin'd too hot and scorch'd him, she shaded him; if he was cold she  cherish'd him and kept him warm; and when Night came she brought him  home to his old Place, and covered him partly with her own Body, and  partly with some Feathers which were left in the Ark, which had been put  in with him when he was first expos'd. Now, when they went out in the  Morning, and when they came home again at Night, there always went with  them an Herd of Deer, which lay in the same place where they did; so  that the Boy being always amongst them learn'd their voice by degrees,  and imitated it so exactly that there was scarce any sensible  difference; nay, when he heard the voice of any Bird or Beast, he'd come  very near it, being of a most excellent Apprehension. But of all the  voices which he imitated, he made most use of the Deers, which he was  Master of, and could express himself as they do, either when they want  help, call their Mates, when they would have them come nearer, or go  farther off. (For you must know that the Brute Beasts have different  Sounds to express these different things.) Thus he contracted such an  Acquaintance with the Wild Beasts, that they were not afraid of him, nor  he of them.    Sec. 12. By this time he began to have the Ideas of a great many things  fix'd in his mind, so as to have a desire to some, and an aversion to  others, even when they were absent. In the mean while he consider'd all  the several sorts of Animals, and saw that they were all clothed either  with Hair, Wool, or several sorts of Feathers: he consider'd their great  Swiftness and Strength, and that they were all arm'd with Weapons  defensive, as Horns, Teeth, Hoofs, Spurs, Nails, and the like. But that  he himself was Naked and Defenceless, Slow and Weak, in respect of them.  For whenever there happened any Controversy about gathering of such ripe  Fruits as fell from the Trees; he always came off by the worst, for they  could both keep their own, and take away his, and he could neither beat  them, off, nor run away from them.    Sec. 13. He observ'd besides that his Fellow-Fawns, tho' their Fore-heads  were smooth at first, yet afterwards had Horns bud out, and tho' they  were feeble at first, yet afterwards grew very Vigorous and Swift. All  these things he perceived in them, which were not in himself; and when  he had consider'd the Matter, he could not imagine what should be the  reason of this Difference; then he consider'd such Animals as had any  Defect or Natural Imperfection, but amongst them all he could find none  like himself. He took Notice that the Passages of the Excrements were  cover'd in all other Creatures besides himself: that by which they  voided their grosser Excrements, with a Tail; and that which serv'd for  the voiding of their Urine, with Hair or some such like thing. Besides,  he observ'd that their Privy parts, were more concealed than his own  were.    Sec. 14. All these things were matter of great Grief to him, and when he  had perplex'd himself very much with the thoughts of them, and was now  near seven Years Old, he despair'd utterly of having those things grow  upon him, the want of which made him so uneasy. He therefore resolv'd to  help himself, and thereupon gets him some Broad Leaves of Trees, of  which he made two Coverings, one to wear behind, the other before; and  made a Girdle of Palm-Trees and Rushes Twisted together, to Hang his  coverings upon, and Ty'd it about his waste, and so wore it. But alas it  would not last long, for the Leaves wither'd and dropt away; so that he  was forc'd to get more, which he doubled and put together as well as he  could, Plaiting the Leaves one upon another, which made it a little more  durable, but not much. Then having broke a Bough from a Tree and fitted  the Ends of it to his Mind, he stript off the Twigs and made it smooth;  with this he began to attack the Wild Beasts, assaulting the weaker, and  defending himself against the stronger. By this means he began a little  to know his own Strength, and perceiv'd that his Hands were better than  their Feet; because by the help of them, he had provided wherewithal to  cover his Nakedness, and also gotten him a Defensive Weapon, so that now  he had no need of a Tail, nor of those Natural Weapons which he had so  wish'd for at first.    Sec. 15. He was now above Seven Years Old, and because the repairing of his  Covering of Leaves so often, was very troublesome to him, he had a  design of taking the Tail of some Dead Beast, and wearing it himself;  but when he perceiv'd that all Beasts did constantly avoid those which  were Dead of the same kind, it made him doubt whether it might be safe  or not; at last, by chance he found a Dead Eagle, and observing that  none of the Beasts shew'd any aversion to that Carcass, he concluded  that this would suit his purpose: and in the first place, he cuts off  the Wings, and the Tail whole, and spreads the Feathers open; then he  drew off the Skin,and divided it into two equal parts, one of which he  wore upon his Back, with the other he covered his Navel and Secrets: the  Tail he wore behind, and the Wings were plac'd upon each Arm. This Dress  of his answer'd several Ends; for in the first place it cover'd his  Nakedness, and help'd to keep him warm, and then it made him so  frightful to the Beasts, that none of them car'd to meddle with him, or  come near him; only the _Roe_ his Nurse, which never left him, nor he,  her; and when she grew Old and Feeble, he us'd to lead her where there  was the best Food, and pluck the best Fruits for her, and give her them  to eat.    Sec. 16. Notwithstanding this she grew lean and weak, and continu'd a while  in a languishing Condition, till at last she Dyed, and then all her  Motions and Actions ceas'd. When the Boy perceiv'd her in this  Condition, he was ready to dye for Grief. He call'd her with the same  voice which she us'd to answer to, and made what Noise he could, but  there was no Motion, no Alteration. Then he began to peep into her Eyes  and Ears, but could perceive no visible defect in either; in like manner  he examin'd all the parts of her Body, and found nothing amiss, but  every thing as it should be. He had a vehement desire to find, if  possible, that part were the defect was, that he might remove it, and  she return to her former State, of Life and Vigour. But he was  altogether at a loss, how to compass his design, nor could he possibly  bring it about.    Sec. 17. That which put him upon this search, was what he observ'd in  himself. He took Notice that when he shut his Eyes, or held any thing  before them, he could see nothing at all, till that Obstacle was  removed; and so when he put his Fingers into his Ears, that he could not  hear, till he took 'em out again; and when he closed his Nostrils  together, he smelt nothing till they were open'd; from whence he  concluded, that all his Senses and Actions were liable to Obstacles and  Impediments, upon the removal of which, the same Operations return'd to  their former course. Therefore, when he had examined every External Part  of her, and found no visible defect, and yet at the same time perceiv'd  an Universal Cessation of Motion in the whole Body, not peculiar to one  Member, but common to them all, he began to imagine that the hurt was in  some part, which was most remote from the sight, and hidden in the  inward part of the Body; and that this Part was of such nature and use,  that without its help, none of the other External Parts could exercise  their proper Functions; and that if this Part suffer any hurt, the  damage was Universal, and a Cessation of the whole ensu'd,    Sec. 18. This made him very desirous to find that part if possible, that he  might remove the defect from it, that so it might be as it us'd to be,  and the whole Body might enjoy the Benefit of it, and the same course of  Actions follow as before. He had before observ'd, in the Bodies of Wild  Beasts and other Animals, that all their Members were solid, and that  there were only three Cavities, _viz_. The Skull, the Breast, and the  Belly; he imagined therefore that this Part which he wanted, must needs  be in one of these Cavities, and above all, he had a strong persuasion  that it was in the middlemost of them. He verily believ'd, that all the  Members stood in need of this part, and that from thence it must  necessarily follow, that the Seat of it must be in the Centre. And when  he reflected upon his own Body, he felt such a part in his Breast, of  which he had this notion, _viz_. That it was impossible for for him to  subsist without it, so much as the twinkling of an eye, tho' he could at  the same time conceive a possibility of subsisting without his other  parts, _viz_. his Hands, Feet, Ears, Nose, Eyes, or even his Head. And  upon this account, whenever he fought with any Wild Beast, he always  took particular care to guard his Breast; because of the Apprehension  which he had of that Part, which was contain'd in it.    Sec. 19. Having, by this way of reasoning, assur'd himself that the  disaffected Part lay in the Breast; he was resolv'd to make a search, in  order to find it out; that whatsoever the Impediment was, he might  remove it if possible; but then again, he was afraid on the other side,  lest his Undertaking should be worse than the Disease, and prove  prejudicial. He began to consider next, whether or no he had ever  remembred any Beasts, or other Animals, which he had seen in that  condition, recover again, and return to the same State which they were  in before: but he could call to Mind no such Instance; from whence he  concluded, that if she"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16847"],[0,"Hinduism and Buddhism, An Historical Sketch, Vol. 3 (#7)"],[1," canon supported by the opponents of the Mahavihara?    Even in its main outline the story is not very coherent for one would  imagine that, if a Buddhist from Magadha went to Ceylon to translate  the Sinhalese commentaries, his object must have been to introduce  them among Indian Buddhists. But there is no evidence that Buddhaghosa  did this and he is for us simply a great figure in the literary and  religious history of Ceylon. Burmese tradition maintains that he was a  native of Thaton and returned thither, when his labours in Ceylon were  completed, to spread the scriptures in his native language. This  version of his activity is intelligible, though the evidence for it is  weak.    He composed a great corpus of exegetical literature which has been  preserved, but, since much of it is still unedited, the precise extent  of his labours is uncertain. There is however little doubt of the  authenticity of his commentaries on the four great Nikayas, on the  Abhidhamma and on the Vinaya (called Samanta-pasadika) and in them[78]  he refers to the Visuddhi-magga as his own work. He says expressly  that his explanations are founded on Sinhalese materials, which he  frequently cites as the opinion of the ancients (porana). By this word  he probably means traditions recorded in Sinhalese and attributed to  Mahinda, but it is in any case clear that the works which he consulted  were considered old in the fifth century A.D. Some of their names are  preserved in the Samanta-pasadika where he mentions the great  commentary (Maha-Atthakatha), the Raft commentary (Paccari, so  called because written on a raft), the Kurundi commentary composed at  Kurunda-Velu and others.[79] All this literature has disappeared and  we can only judge of it by Buddhaghosa's reproduction which is  probably not a translation but a selection and rearrangement. Indeed  his occasional direct quotations from the ancients or from an  Atthakatha imply that the rest of the work is merely based on  the Sinhalese commentaries.    Buddhaghosa was not an independent thinker but he makes amends for his  want of originality not only by his industry and learning but by his  power of grasping and expounding the whole of an intricate subject.  His Visuddhi-magga has not yet been edited in Europe, but the extracts  and copious analysis[80] which have been published indicate that it is  a comprehensive restatement of Buddhist doctrine made with as free a  hand as orthodoxy permitted. The Mahavamsa observes that the Theras  held his works in the same estimation as the Pitakas. They are in  no way coloured by the Mahayanist tenets which were already prevalent  in India, but state in its severest form the Hinayanist creed, of  which he is the most authoritative exponent. The Visuddhi-magga is  divided into three parts treating of conduct (silam), meditation  (samadhi) and knowledge (panna), the first being the necessary  substratum for the religious life of which the others are the two  principal branches. But though he intersperses his exposition with  miraculous stories and treats exhaustively of superhuman powers, no  trace of the worship of Mahayanist Bodhisattvas is found in his works  and, as for literature, he himself is the chief authority for the  genuineness and completeness of the Pali Canon as we know it.    When we find it said that his works were esteemed as highly as the  Pitakas, or that the documents which he translated into Pali were  the words of the Buddha,[81] the suspicion naturally arises that the  Pali Canon may be in part his composition and it may be well to review  briefly its history in Ceylon. Our knowledge appears to be derived  entirely from the traditions of the Mahavihara which represent Mahinda  as teaching the text of the Pitakas orally, accompanied by a  commentary. If we admit the general truth of the narrative concerning  Mahinda's mission, there is nothing improbable in these statements,  for it would be natural that an Indian teacher should know by heart  his sacred texts and the commentaries on them. We cannot of course  assume that the Pitakas of Mahinda were the Pali Canon as we know  it, but the inscriptions of Asoka refer to passages which can be found  in that canon and therefore parts of it at any rate must have been  accepted as scripture in the third century B.C. But it is probable  that considerable variation was permitted in the text, although the  sense and a certain terminology were carefully guarded. It was not  till the reign of Vattagamani, probably about 20 B.C., that  the canon was committed to writing and the Parivara, composed in  Ceylon,[82] was included in it.    In the reign of Buddhadasa[83] a learned monk named Mahadhammakathi is  said to have translated the Suttas into Sinhalese, which at this time  was esteemed the proper language for letters and theology, but in the  next century a contrary tendency, probably initiated by Buddhaghosa,  becomes apparent and Sinhalese works are rewritten in Pali.[84] But  nothing indicates that any part of what we call the Pali Canon  underwent this process. Buddhaghosa distinguishes clearly between text  and comment, between Pali and Sinhalese documents. He has a coherent  history of the text, beginning with the Council of Rajagaha; he  discusses various readings, he explains difficult words. He treated  the ancient commentaries with freedom, but there is no reason to think  that he allowed himself any discretion or right of selection in  dealing with the sacred texts accepted by the Mahavihara, though it  might be prudent to await the publication of his commentaries on all  the Nikayas before asserting this unreservedly.    To sum up, the available evidence points to the conclusion that in the  time of Asoka texts and commentaries preserved orally were brought to  Ceylon. The former, though in a somewhat fluid condition, were  sufficiently sacred to be kept unchanged in the original Indian  language, the latter were translated into the kindred but still  distinct vernacular of the island. In the next century and a half  some additions to the Pali texts were made and about 20 B.C. the  Mahavihara, which proved as superior to the other communities in  vitality as it was in antiquity, caused written copies to be made of  what it considered as the canon, including some recent works. There is  no evidence that Buddhaghosa or anyone else enlarged or curtailed the  canon, but the curious tradition that he collected and burned all the  books written by Mahinda in Sinhalese[85] may allude to the existence  of other works which he (presumably in agreement with the Mahavihara)  considered spurious.    Soon after the departure of Buddhaghosa Dhatusena came to the throne  and \"held like Dhammasoka a convocation about the three  Pitakas.\"[86] This implies that there was still some doubt as to  what was scripture and that the canon of the Mahavihara was not  universally accepted. The Vetulyas, of whom we heard in the third  century A.D., reappear in the seventh when they are said to have been  supported by a provincial governor but not by the king Aggabodhi[87]  and still more explicitly in the reign of Parakrama Bahu (c. 1160). He  endeavoured to reconcile to the Mahavihara \"the Abhayagiri brethren  who separated themselves from the time of king Vattagamani  Abhaya and the Jetavana brethren that had parted since the days of  Mahasena and taught the Vetulla Pitaka and other writings as the  words of Buddha, which indeed were not the words of Buddha.\"[88] So it  appears that another recension of the canon was in existence for many  centuries.    Dhatusena, though depicted in the Mahavamsa as a most orthodox  monarch, embellished the Abhayagiri monastery and was addicted to  sumptuous ceremonies in honour of images and relics. Thus he made an  image of Mahinda, dedicated a shrine and statue to Metteyya and  ornamented the effigies of Buddha with the royal jewels. In an image  chamber (apparently at the Abhayagiri) he set up figures of  Bodhisattvas,[89] by which we should perhaps understand the previous  births of Gotama. He was killed by his son and Sinhalese history  degenerated into a complicated story of crime and discord, in which  the weaker faction generally sought the aid of the Tamils. These  latter became more and more powerful and with their advance Buddhism  tended to give place to Hinduism. In the eighth century the court  removed from Anuradhapura to Pollannaruwa, in order to escape from the  pressure of the Tamils, but the picture of anarchy and decadence grows  more and more gloomy until the accession of Vijaya Bahu in 1071 who  succeeded in making himself king of all Ceylon. Though he recovered  Anuradhapura it was not made the royal residence either by himself or  by his greater successor, Parakrama Bahu.[90] This monarch, the most  eminent in the long list of Ceylon's sovereigns, after he had  consolidated his power, devoted himself, in the words of Tennent, \"to  the two grand objects of royal solicitude, religion and agriculture.\"  He was lavish in building monasteries, temples and libraries, but not  less generous in constructing or repairing tanks and works of  irrigation. In the reign of Vijaya Bahu hardly any duly ordained monks  were to be found,[91] the succession having been interrupted, and the  deficiency was supplied by bringing qualified Theras from Burma. But  by the time of Parakrama Bahu the old quarrels of the monasteries  revived, and, as he was anxious to secure unity, he summoned a synod  at Anuradhapura. It appears to have attained its object by recognizing  the Mahavihara as the standard of orthodoxy and dealing summarily with  dissentients.[92] The secular side of monastic life also received  liberal attention. Lands, revenues and guest-houses were provided for  the monasteries as well as hospitals. As in Burma and Siam Brahmans  were respected and the king erected a building for their use in the  capital. Like Asoka, he forbade the"]]]
