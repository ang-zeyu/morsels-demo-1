Verily is He the Loving, the Tender, the Ever-Bestowing.            10: O THOU DEAR HANDMAID OF GOD! THY LETTER HATH ...      O thou dear handmaid of God! Thy letter hath been received and its  contents noted. Thou didst ask for a rule whereby to guide thy life.    Believe thou in God, and keep thine eyes fixed upon the exalted Kingdom;  be thou enamoured of the Abha Beauty; stand thou firm in the Covenant;  yearn thou to ascend into the Heaven of the Universal Light. Be thou  severed from this world, and reborn through the sweet scents of holiness  that blow from the realm of the All-Highest. Be thou a summoner to love,  and be thou kind to all the human race. Love thou the children of men and  share in their sorrows. Be thou of those who foster peace. Offer thy  friendship, be worthy of trust. Be thou a balm to every sore, be thou a  medicine for every ill. Bind thou the souls together. Recite thou the  verses of guidance. Be engaged in the worship of thy Lord, and rise up to  lead the people aright. Loose thy tongue and teach, and let thy face be  bright with the fire of God's love. Rest thou not for a moment, seek thou  to draw no easeful breath. Thus mayest thou become a sign and symbol of  God's love, and a banner of His grace.            11: SERVICE TO THE FRIENDS IS SERVICE TO THE KINGDOM OF ...      Service to the friends is service to the Kingdom of God, and consideration  shown to the poor is one of the greatest teachings of God.            12: KNOW THOU OF A CERTAINTY THAT LOVE IS THE SECRET OF ...      Know thou of a certainty that Love is the secret of God's holy  Dispensation, the manifestation of the All-Merciful, the fountain of  spiritual outpourings. Love is heaven's kindly light, the Holy Spirit's  eternal breath that vivifieth the human soul. Love is the cause of God's  revelation unto man, the vital bond inherent, in accordance with the  divine creation, in the realities of things. Love is the one means that  ensureth true felicity both in this world and the next. Love is the light  that guideth in darkness, the living link that uniteth God with man, that  assureth the progress of every illumined soul. Love is the most great law  that ruleth this mighty and heavenly cycle, the unique power that bindeth  together the divers elements of this material world, the supreme magnetic  force that directeth the movements of the spheres in the celestial realms.  Love revealeth with unfailing and limitless power the mysteries latent in  the universe. Love is the spirit of life unto the adorned body of mankind,  the establisher of true civilization in this mortal world, and the shedder  of imperishable glory upon every high-aiming race and nation.    Whatsoever people is graciously favoured therewith by God, its name shall  surely be magnified and extolled by the Concourse from on high, by the  company of angels, and the denizens of the Abha Kingdom. And whatsoever  people turneth its heart away from this Divine Love--the revelation of the  Merciful--shall err grievously, shall fall into despair, and be utterly  destroyed. That people shall be denied all refuge, shall become even as  the vilest creatures of the earth, victims of degradation and shame.    O ye beloved of the Lord! Strive to become the manifestations of the love  of God, the lamps of divine guidance shining amongst the kindreds of the  earth with the light of love and concord.    All hail to the revealers of this glorious light!            13: O THOU DAUGHTER OF THE KINGDOM! THY LETTER DATED ...      O thou daughter of the Kingdom! Thy letter dated 5 December 1918 was  received. It contained the good news that the friends of God and the  maidservants of the Merciful have gathered in summer at Green Acre, have  been engaged day and night in the commemoration of God, have served the  oneness of the world of humanity, have shown love to all religions, have  remained aloof from every religious prejudice and have been kind to all  people. The divine religions must be the cause of oneness among men, and  the means of unity and love; they must promulgate universal peace, free  man from every prejudice, bestow joy and gladness, exercise kindness to  all men and do away with every difference and distinction. Just as  Baha'u'llah addressing the world of humanity saith: 'O people! Ye are the  fruits of one tree and the leaves of one branch.' At most it is this, that  some souls are ignorant, they must be educated; some are sick, they must  be healed; some are still of tender age, they must be helped to attain  maturity, and the utmost kindness must be shown to them. This is the  conduct of the people of Baha.    I hope that thy brothers and sisters will all become the well-wishers of  the world of mankind.            14: O YE TWO BLESSED SOULS! YOUR LETTERS WERE RECEIVED. ...      O ye two blessed souls! Your letters were received. They showed that ye  have investigated the truth and have been freed from imitations and  superstitions, that ye observe with your own eyes and not with those of  others, hearken with your own ears and not with the ears of others, and  discover mysteries with the help of your own consciences and not with  those of others. For the imitator saith that such a man hath seen, such a  man hath heard, and such a conscience hath discovered; in other words he  dependeth upon the sight, the hearing and the conscience of others and  hath no will of his own.    Now, praise be to God, ye have shown will-power and have turned to the Sun  of Truth. The plain of your hearts hath been illumined by the lights of  the Lord of the Kingdom and ye have been led to the straight path, have  marched along the road that leadeth to the Kingdom, have entered the Abha  Paradise, and have secured a portion and share of the fruit of the Tree of  Life.    Blessed are ye and a goodly home awaiteth you. Upon you be greetings and  praise.            15: O CAPTIVE OF THE LOVE OF GOD! THE LETTER WHICH ...      O captive of the love of God! The letter which thou didst write at the  time of thy departure hath been received. It brought me joy; and it is my  hope that thine inner eye may be opened wide, so that unto thee the very  core of the divine mysteries may be disclosed.    Thou didst begin thy letter with a blessed phrase, saying: 'I am a  Christian.' O would that all were truly Christian! It is easy to be a  Christian on the tongue, but hard to be a true one. Today some five  hundred million souls are Christian, but the real Christian is very rare:  he is that soul from whose comely face there shineth the splendour of  Christ, and who showeth forth the perfections of the Kingdom; this is a  matter of great moment, for to be a Christian is to embody every  excellence there is. I hope that thou, too, shalt become a true Christian.  Praise thou God that at last, through the divine teachings, thou hast  obtained both sight and insight to the highest degree, and hast become  firmly rooted in certitude and faith. It is my hope that others as well  will achieve illumined eyes and hearing ears, and attain to everlasting  life: that these many rivers, each flowing along in diverse and separated  beds, will find their way back to the circumambient sea, and merge  together and rise up in a single wave of surging oneness; that the unity  of truth, through the power of God, will make these illusory differences  to vanish away. This is the one essential: for if unity be gained, all  other problems will disappear of themselves.    O honoured lady! In accordance with the divine teachings in this glorious  dispensation we should not belittle anyone and call him ignorant, saying:  'You know not, but I know'. Rather, we should look upon others with  respect, and when attempting to explain and demonstrate, we should speak  as if we are investigating the truth, saying: 'Here these things are  before us. Let us investigate to determine where and in what form the  truth can be found.' The teacher should not consider himself as learned  and others ignorant. Such a thought breedeth pride, and pride is not  conducive to influence. The teacher should not see in himself any  superiority; he should speak with the utmost kindliness, lowliness and  humility, for such speech exerteth influence and educateth the souls.    O honoured lady! For a single purpose were the Prophets, each and all,  sent down to earth; for this was Christ made manifest, for this did  Baha'u'llah raise up the call of the Lord: that the world of man should  become the world of God, this nether realm the Kingdom, this darkness  light, this satanic wickedness all the virtues of heaven--and unity,  fellowship and love be won for the whole human race, that the organic  unity should reappear and the bases of discord be destroyed and life  everlasting and grace everlasting become the harvest of mankind.    O honoured lady! Look about thee at the world: here unity, mutual  attraction, gathering together, engender life, but disunity and inharmony  spell death. When thou dost consider all phenomena, thou wilt see that  every created thing hath come into being through the mingling of many  elements, and once this collectivity of elements is dissolved, and this  harmony of components is dissevered, the life form is wiped out.    O honoured lady! In cycles gone by, though harmony was established, yet,  owing to the absence of means, the unity of all mankind could not have  been achieved. Continents remained widely divided, nay even among the  peoples of one and the same continent association and interchange of  thought were wellnigh impossible. Consequently intercourse, understanding  and unity amongst all the peoples and kindreds of the earth were  unattainable. In this day,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19289"],[0,"Some Answered Questions (#7)"],[1,". Until our time no such thing has  ever occurred.    If there be justice, this will be acknowledged; but there are some people  who, even if all the proofs in the world be adduced before them, still  will not judge justly!    Thus nations and states with all their strength could not resist Him.  Verily, single and alone, imprisoned and oppressed, He accomplished  whatever He desired.    I do not wish to mention the miracles of Baha'u'llah, for it may perhaps  be said that these are traditions, liable both to truth and to error, like  the accounts of the miracles of Christ in the Gospel, which come to us  from the apostles, and not from anyone else, and are denied by the Jews.  Though if I wish to mention the supernatural acts of Baha'u'llah, they are  numerous; they are acknowledged in the Orient, and even by some  non-Baha'is. But these narratives are not decisive proofs and evidences to  all; the hearer might perhaps say that this account may not be in  accordance with what occurred, for it is known that other sects recount  miracles performed by their founders. For instance, the followers of  Brahmanism relate miracles. From what evidence may we know that those are  false and that these are true? If these are fables, the others also are  fables; if these are generally accepted, so also the others are generally  accepted. Consequently, these accounts are not satisfactory proofs. Yes,  miracles are proofs for the eyewitness only, and even he may regard them  not as a miracle but as an enchantment. Extraordinary feats have also been  related of some conjurors.    Briefly, my meaning is that many wonderful things were done by  Baha'u'llah, but we do not recount them, as they do not constitute proofs  and evidences for all the peoples of the earth, and they are not decisive  proofs even for those who see them: they may think that they are merely  enchantments.    Also, most of the miracles of the Prophets which are mentioned have an  inner significance. For instance, in the Gospel it is written that at the  martyrdom of Christ darkness prevailed, and the earth quaked, and the veil  of the Temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom, and the dead  came forth from their graves. If these events had happened, they would  indeed have been awesome, and would certainly have been recorded in the  history of the times. They would have become the cause of much troublings  of heart. Either the soldiers would have taken down Christ from the cross,  or they would have fled. These events are not related in any history;  therefore, it is evident they ought not to be taken literally, but as  having an inner significance.(31)    Our purpose is not to deny such miracles; our only meaning is that they do  not constitute decisive proofs, and that they have an inner significance.    Accordingly, today, at table, we will refer to the explanation of the  traditional proofs which are in the Holy Books. Until now, all that we  have spoken of are rational proofs.    The state in which one should be to seriously search for the truth is the  condition of the thirsty, burning soul desiring the water of life, of the  fish struggling to reach the sea, of the sufferer seeking for the true  doctor to obtain the divine cure, of the lost caravan endeavoring to find  the right road, of the lost and wandering ship striving to reach the shore  of salvation.    Therefore, the seeker must be endowed with certain qualities. First of  all, he must be just and severed from all else save God; his heart must be  entirely turned to the supreme horizon; he must be free from the bondage  of self and passion, for all these are obstacles. Furthermore, he must be  able to endure all hardships. He must be absolutely pure and sanctified,  and free from the love or the hatred of the inhabitants of the world. Why?  because the fact of his love for any person or thing might prevent him  from recognizing the truth in another, and, in the same way, hatred for  anything might be a hindrance in discerning truth. This is the condition  of seeking, and the seeker must have these qualities and attributes. Until  he reaches this condition, it is not possible for him to attain to the Sun  of Reality.    Let us now return to our subject.    All the peoples of the world are awaiting two Manifestations, Who must be  contemporaneous; all wait for the fulfillment of this promise. In the  Bible the Jews have the promise of the Lord of Hosts and the Messiah; in  the Gospel the return of Christ and Elijah is promised.    In the religion of Muhammad there is the promise of the Mihdi and the  Messiah, and it is the same with the Zoroastrian and the other religions,  but if we relate these matters in detail, it would take too long. The  essential fact is that all are promised two Manifestations, Who will come,  one following on the other. It has been prophesied that in the time of  these two Manifestations the earth will be transformed, the world of  existence will be renewed, and beings will be clothed in new garments.  Justice and truth will encompass the world; enmity and hatred will  disappear; all causes of division among peoples, races and nations will  vanish; and the cause of union, harmony and concord will appear. The  negligent will awake, the blind will see, the deaf will hear, the dumb  will speak, the sick will be cured, the dead will arise. War will give  place to peace, enmity will be conquered by love, the causes of dispute  and wrangling will be entirely removed, and true felicity will be  attained. The world will become the mirror of the Heavenly Kingdom;  humanity will be the Throne of Divinity. All nations will become one; all  religions will be unified; all individual men will become of one family  and of one kindred. All the regions of the earth will become one; the  superstitions caused by races, countries, individuals, languages and  politics will disappear; and all men will attain to life eternal, under  the shadow of the Lord of Hosts.    Now we must prove from the Holy Books that these two Manifestations have  come, and we must divine the meaning of the words of the Prophets, for we  wish for proofs drawn from the Holy Books.    A few days ago, at table, we put forth rational proofs establishing the  truth of these two Manifestations.    To conclude: in the Book of Daniel, from the rebuilding of Jerusalem to  the martyrdom of Christ, seventy weeks are appointed; for by the martyrdom  of Christ the sacrifice is accomplished and the altar destroyed.(32) This  is a prophecy of the manifestation of Christ. These seventy weeks begin  with the restoration and the rebuilding of Jerusalem, concerning which  four edicts were issued by three kings.    The first was issued by Cyrus in the year 536 B.C.; this is recorded in  the first chapter of the Book of Ezra. The second edict, with reference to  the rebuilding of Jerusalem, is that of Darius of Persia in the year 519  B.C.; this is recorded in the sixth chapter of Ezra. The third is that of  Artaxerxes in the seventh year of his reign--that is, in 457 B.C.; this is  recorded in the seventh chapter of Ezra. The fourth is that of Artaxerxes  in the year 444 B.C.; this is recorded in the second chapter of Nehemiah.    But Daniel refers especially to the third edict which was issued in the  year 457 B.C. Seventy weeks make four hundred and ninety days. Each day,  according to the text of the Holy Book, is a year. For in the Bible it is  said: \"The day of the Lord is one year.\"(33) Therefore, four hundred and  ninety days are four hundred and ninety years. The third edict of  Artaxerxes was issued four hundred and fifty-seven years before the birth  of Christ, and Christ when He was martyred and ascended was thirty-three  years of age. When you add thirty-three to four hundred and fifty-seven,  the result is four hundred and ninety, which is the time announced by  Daniel for the manifestation of Christ.    But in the twenty-fifth verse of the ninth chapter of the Book of Daniel  this is expressed in another manner, as seven weeks and sixty-two weeks;  and apparently this differs from the first saying. Many have remained  perplexed at these differences, trying to reconcile these two statements.  How can seventy weeks be right in one place, and sixty-two weeks and seven  weeks in another? These two sayings do not accord.    But Daniel mentions two dates. One of these dates begins with the command  of Artaxerxes to Ezra to rebuild Jerusalem: this is the seventy weeks  which came to an end with the ascension of Christ, when by His martyrdom  the sacrifice and oblation ceased.    The second period, which is found in the twenty-sixth verse, means that  after the termination of the rebuilding of Jerusalem until the ascension  of Christ, there will be sixty-two weeks: the seven weeks are the duration  of the rebuilding of Jerusalem, which took forty-nine years. When you add  these seven weeks to the sixty-two weeks, it makes sixty-nine weeks, and  in the last week (69-70) the ascension of Christ took place. These seventy  weeks are thus completed, and there is no contradiction.    Now that the manifestation of Christ has been proved by the prophecies of  Daniel, let us prove the manifestations of Baha'u'llah and of the Bab. Up  to the present we have only mentioned rational proofs; now we shall speak  of traditional proofs.    In the eighth chapter of the Book of Daniel, verse thirteen, it is said:  \"Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain  saint which spake, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily  sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary  and the host to be trodden under foot?\" Then he answered (v. 14): \"Unto  two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be  cleansed\"; (v. 17) \"But he said unto me ... at the time of the end shall  be the vision.\" That is to say, how long will this misfortune, this ruin,  this abasement and"]]]
