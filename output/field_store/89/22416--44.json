It was made plain enough,  by the dressing of the shops, that here, too, it was Christmas-time  again; but it was evening, and the streets were lighted up.    The Ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door, and asked Scrooge if he  knew it.    \"Know it!\" said Scrooge. \"Was I apprenticed here?\"    They went in. At sight of an old gentleman in a Welsh wig, sitting  behind such a high desk, that if he had been two inches taller, he must  have knocked his head against the ceiling, Scrooge cried in great  excitement:    \"Why, it's old Fezziwig! Bless his heart, it's Fezziwig alive again!\"    Old Fezziwig laid down his pen, and looked up at the clock, which  pointed to the hour of seven. He rubbed his hands; adjusted his  capacious waistcoat; laughed all over himself, from his shoes to his  organ of benevolence; and called out, in a comfortable, oily, rich, fat,  jovial voice:    \"Yo ho, there! Ebenezer! Dick!\"    Scrooge's former self, now grown a young man, came briskly in,  accompanied by his fellow-'prentice.    \"Dick Wilkins, to be sure!\" said Scrooge to the Ghost. \"Bless me, yes.  There he is. He was very much attached to me, was Dick. Poor Dick! Dear,  dear!\"    \"Yo ho, my boys!\" said Fezziwig. \"No more work to-night. Christmas-eve,  Dick. Christmas, Ebenezer! Let's have the shutters up,\" cried old  Fezziwig with a sharp clap of his hands, \"before a man can say Jack  Robinson!\"    You wouldn't believe how those two fellows went at it! They charged into  the street with the shutters--one, two, three--had 'em up in their  places--four, five, six--barred 'em and pinned 'em--seven, eight,  nine--and came back before you could have got to twelve, panting like  race-horses.    \"Hilli-ho!\" cried old Fezziwig, skipping down from the high desk with  wonderful agility. \"Clear away, my lads, and let's have lots of room  here! Hilli-ho, Dick! Chirrup, Ebenezer!\"    Clear away! There was nothing they wouldn't have cleared away, or  couldn't have cleared away, with old Fezziwig looking on. It was done in  a minute. Every movable was packed off, as if it were dismissed from  public life for evermore; the floor was swept and watered, the lamps  were trimmed, fuel was heaped upon the fire; and the warehouse was as  snug, and warm, and dry, and bright a ball-room as you would desire to  see upon a winter's night.    In came a fiddler with a music-book, and went up to the lofty desk, and  made an orchestra of it, and tuned like fifty stomachaches. In came Mrs.  Fezziwig, one vast substantial smile. In came the three Miss Fezziwigs,  beaming and lovable. In came the six young followers whose hearts they  broke. In came all the young men and women employed in the business. In  came the housemaid, with her cousin the baker. In came the cook, with  her brother's particular friend the milkman. In came the boy from over  the way, who was suspected of not having board enough from his master;  trying to hide himself behind the girl from next door but one, who was  proved to have had her ears pulled by her mistress. In they all came,  one after another; some shyly, some boldly, some gracefully, some  awkwardly, some pushing, some pulling; in they all came, any how and  every how. Away they all went, twenty couple at once; hands half round  and back again the other way; down the middle and up again; round and  round in various stages of affectionate grouping; old top couple always  turning up in the wrong place; new top couple starting off again as soon  as they got there; all top couples at last, and not a bottom one to help  them! When this result was brought about, old Fezziwig, clapping his  hands to stop the dance, cried out, \"Well done!\" and the fiddler plunged  his hot face into a pot of porter, especially provided for that purpose.  But, scorning rest upon his reappearance, he instantly began again,  though there were no dancers yet, as if the other fiddler had been  carried home, exhausted, on a shutter, and he were a bran-new man  resolved to beat him out of sight, or perish.    There were more dances, and there were forfeits, and more dances, and  there was cake, and there was negus, and there was a great piece of Cold  Roast, and there was a great piece of Cold Boiled, and there were  mince-pies, and plenty of beer. But the great effect of the evening came  after the Roast and Boiled, when the fiddler (an artful dog, mind! The  sort of man who knew his business better than you or I could have told  it him!) struck up \"Sir Roger de Coverley.\" Then old Fezziwig stood out  to dance with Mrs. Fezziwig. Top couple, too; with a good stiff piece of  work cut out for them; three or four and twenty pair of partners; people  who were not to be trifled with; people who _would_ dance, and had no  notion of walking.    But if they had been twice as many--ah! four times--old Fezziwig would  have been a match for them, and so would Mrs. Fezziwig. As to _her_, she  was worthy to be his partner in every sense of the term. If that's not  high praise, tell me higher, and I'll use it. A positive light appeared  to issue from Fezziwig's calves. They shone in every part of the dance  like moons. You couldn't have predicted, at any given time, what would  become of them next. And when old Fezziwig and Mrs. Fezziwig had gone  all through the dance; advance and retire, both hands to your partner,  bow and curtsy, cork-screw, thread-the-needle, and back again to your  place; Fezziwig \"cut\"--cut so deftly, that he appeared to wink with his  legs, and came upon his feet again without a stagger.    When the clock struck eleven, this domestic ball broke up. Mr. and Mrs.  Fezziwig took their stations, one on either side the door, and, shaking  hands with every person individually as he or she went out, wished him  or her a Merry Christmas. When everybody had retired but the two  'prentices, they did the same to them; and thus the cheerful voices died  away, and the lads were left to their beds; which were under a counter  in the back-shop.    During the whole of this time Scrooge had acted like a man out of his  wits. His heart and soul were in the scene, and with his former self. He  corroborated everything, remembered everything, enjoyed everything, and  underwent the strangest agitation. It was not until now, when the bright  faces of his former self and Dick were turned from them, that he  remembered the Ghost, and became conscious that it was looking full upon  him, while the light upon its head burnt very clear.    \"A small matter,\" said the Ghost, \"to make these silly folks so full of  gratitude.\"    \"Small!\" echoed Scrooge.    The Spirit signed to him to listen to the two apprentices, who were  pouring out their hearts in praise of Fezziwig; and, when he had done  so, said:    \"Why! Is it not? He has spent but a few pounds of your mortal money:  three or four, perhaps. Is that so much that he deserves this praise?\"    \"It isn't that,\" said Scrooge, heated by the remark, and speaking  unconsciously like his former, not his latter self. \"It isn't that,  Spirit. He has the power to render us happy or unhappy; to make our  service light or burdensome; a pleasure or a toil. Say that his power  lies in words and looks; in things so slight and insignificant that it  is impossible to add and count 'em up: what then? The happiness he gives  is quite as great as if it cost a fortune.\"    He felt the Spirit's glance, and stopped.    \"What is the matter?\" asked the Ghost.    \"Nothing particular,\" said Scrooge.    \"Something, I think?\" the Ghost insisted.    \"No,\" said Scrooge, \"no. I should like to be able to say a word or two  to my clerk just now. That's all.\"    His former self turned down the lamps as he gave utterance to the wish;  and Scrooge and the Ghost again stood side by side in the open air.    \"My time grows short,\" observed the Spirit. \"Quick!\"    This was not addressed to Scrooge, or to any one whom he could see, but  it produced an immediate effect. For again Scrooge saw himself. He was  older now; a man in the prime of life. His face had not the harsh and  rigid lines of later years; but it had begun to wear the signs of care  and avarice. There was an eager, greedy, restless motion in the eye,  which showed the passion that had taken root, and where the shadow of  the growing tree would fall.    He was not alone, but sat by the side of a fair young girl in a mourning  dress: in whose eyes there were tears, which sparkled in the light that  shone out of the Ghost of Christmas Past.    \"It matters little,\" she said softly. \"To you, very little. Another idol  has displaced me; and, if it can cheer and comfort you in time to come  as I would have tried to do, I have no just cause to grieve.\"    \"What Idol has displaced you?\" he rejoined.    \"A golden one.\"    \"This is the even-handed dealing of the world!\" he said. \"There is  nothing on which it is so hard as poverty; and there is nothing it  professes to condemn with such severity as the pursuit of wealth!\"    \"You fear the world too much,\" she answered gently. \"All your other  hopes have merged into the hope of being beyond the chance of its sordid  reproach. I have seen your nobler aspirations fall off one by one, until  the master passion, Gain, engrosses you. Have I not?\"    \"What then?\" he retorted. \"Even if I have grown so much wiser, what  then? I am not changed towards you.\"    She shook her head.    \"Am I?\"    \"Our contract is an old one. It was made when we were both poor, and  content to be so, until, in good season, we could improve our worldly  fortune by our patient industry. You _are_ changed. When it was made you  were another man.\"    \"I was a boy,\" he said impatiently.    \"Your own feeling tells you that you were not what you are,\" she  returned. \"I am. That which promised happiness when we were one in heart  is fraught with misery now that we are"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19354"],[0,"Lessons in Music Form (#7)"],[1," defines, at the same  time, the beginning of the next, and _vice versa_.  The locating of  one, therefore, serves to locate the other.  There is, usually,  something sufficiently indicative about a \"beginning,\" to render it  noticeable to a careful observer, and the same is true of an \"ending.\"  This is illustrated in the following:    [Illustration: Example 17.  Fragments of Beethoven.]      No. 1 is from the pianoforte sonata, op. 10, No. 3, second movement;  see the original.  This phrase exhibits an ending, unmistakably, in the  _fifth_ measure, and not in the fourth.  Its form is therefore  irregular.    In No. 2 (from the first pianoforte sonata), the first phrase ends with  the fourth measure, obviously, for the evidence of a new \"beginning\" in  the following measure is perfectly clear; the phrase is therefore  regular.  But the next phrase runs on to the _sixth_ measure from this  point (the tenth from the beginning of the whole), because there is no  earlier evidence of an \"ending.\"  Observe that the first phrase has a  preliminary quarter-note, the second phrase none.  Turning to  Mendelssohn's Songs Without Words, the very first (introductory) phrase  of No. 3 is five measures in length; the first one in No. 35 also  contains five measures; the first one in No. 16, and in No. 9, contains  three measures.  The irregular phrase will be again considered (in a  different aspect) in a later chapter.    The recognition of these syntactic traits of the melodic sentence is of  great moment to the player, for they constitute the information upon  which conscious, intelligent, effective _phrasing_ depends; and without  intelligent phrasing, without a clear exposition of the formation and  arrangement of the members and phrases, full comprehension and adequate  enjoyment of a musical composition is impossible.          *      *      *      *      *      *    CONTENTS OF THE PHRASE.--The question may arise, what is it that makes  a phrase,--the rhythm, harmony, or melody?  Strictly speaking, all  three; for music subsists in the ceaseless co-operation of these three  primary elements of composition, and no phrase is wholly complete  without the evidence of each and all.  Generalizing the definitions  already given, the function of each of these primary elements may be  thus described: The element of harmony regulates the choice of the  tones that are to sound together; the upright shafts of tone (chords)  which determine the _body_, or framework, of the music.  The element of  melody regulates the choice of single tones, selected from the  successive shafts of harmony, that are to form a connected line or  strand of tones (in horizontal order, so to speak),--something like a  chain or chains stretched from harmonic post to post, which describe  the figure or _outline_ of the musical image.  The element of rhythm  gives the whole body its _life_,--regulates the choice of varying  lengths, defining the infinitely varied \"tapping\" of the musical  mechanism.    It is evident, from this, that no vivid, satisfying musical impression  can be created in the absence of any one of these essential elements.  But, for all that, they are not of equal importance; and, in  determining the extremities of the phrase (and of all other factors of  musical structure), the melody takes precedence over harmony and  rhythm.  That is to say, that in his analysis of figures, motives,  phrases, periods, and so forth, the student's attention should be  centered upon the melody,--that chain of successive single tones which,  as repeatedly stated, usually describes the _uppermost_ line of the  harmonic and rhythmic body.  That is the reason why the illustrations  given in this book are so frequently limited to the melody alone; it is  the pencil point which traces the design, describes the form, of the  musical composition.      LESSON 4.--Procure the _Jugend Album_, op. 68, of Schumann, and mark  the phrases in Nos. 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, 18, 20, and others.  In  the given numbers the phrases are all regular,--four measures in length.    Analyze in the same manner Mendelssohn's Songs Without Words, Nos. 27,  22 (first phrase, five measures), 48, 28, 35, and others; occasional  irregularities may be encountered.    Also Beethoven, pianoforte sonata; op. 14, No. 2, second movement (C  major, _andante_); and op. 26, first movement.    A few cautious experiments may also be made in analyzing any  composition which the student may chance to be studying, especially if  not too elaborate.  The necessary safeguard consists in simply passing  over every confusing point, limiting the analysis to those phrases that  are self defining, for the present,--until greater experience and  fuller information shall have been gained.          CHAPTER V.  CADENCES.    CADENCES IN GENERAL.--A cadence is the ending of a phrase.  Strictly  speaking, every interruption or \"break\" between figures, and between  all melodic members, is a cadence; but the term \"cadence\" is applied to  nothing smaller than entire phrases.    The cadence is the point of Repose which creates the necessary contrast  with the condition of Action that prevails more or less constantly  during the phrase; and the effect of this point of repose is,  therefore, to separate one phrase from the next.  The cadential effect  is generally produced by two or three chords, the last one of which is  called the cadence-chord, and stands, when the cadence is perfectly  regular, upon an accented beat of the final measure.  This, according  to our definition of the phrase, will most commonly be the fourth  measure.    For example:    [Illustration: Example 18.  Fragment of Schumann.]      The first chord in the fourth measure, on the accented beat, is the  \"cadence-chord\"; but the preceding chord (and possibly the one before  that, also) is naturally inseparable from the final one, and therefore  the entire cadence would be defined technically as embracing both (or  all three) of these chords.  The effect of repose is obtained _by the  length of the final chord_, which exceeds that of any other melody tone  in the phrase; its time-value is a dotted quarter, because of the  preliminary tone (_e_, before the first accent) which, in the original  (op. 68, No. 28), precedes the next phrase in exactly the same manner.    Illustrations of the regular cadence will be found, also, in Ex. 15 and  Ex. 16; in the latter,--consisting as it does of four consecutive  phrases, four cadences occur, distinctly marked by the _longer tone_ on  the accented beat of each successive fourth measure.      MODIFICATION OR DISGUISING OF THE CADENCE.--The most natural and  characteristic indication of a cadence is the _longer tone_, seen in  the examples to which reference has just been made; for a tone of  greater length than its fellows is, in itself, the most conclusive  evidence of a point of repose, as compared with the shorter tones in  the course of the sentence, whose more prompt succession indicates the  action of the phrase.  (See Ex. 29.)    From this the student is not to conclude that every long tone marks a  cadence.  The rhythmic design of a melody is obtained by a constant  interchange of long and short tones, without direct reference to the  cadence alone; and numerous examples will be found in which tones of  equal, or even greater, length than the cadence-tone occur in the  course of the phrase.  We have already seen that the end of a motive,  or even of a figure, may be marked by a longer tone, or its equivalent  in rests; and have been taught to expect a cadence in the fourth  measure only, as a rule.    But the direct evidence of a cadence afforded by a longer tone is  considered not only unnecessary, but in many cases distinctly  undesirable.  While cadences are indispensable, in music of clearly  recognizable form, it is equally true that they must not be so emphatic  as to check the current of melody and harmony too frequently or  completely, or destroy the continuity and coherence of the members.  And it is therefore an almost invariable practice, especially in music  of a higher order, to modify and disguise the cadences by some means or  other; that is, to diminish the weight of the characteristic \"longer  tone,\"--to counteract, partially or entirely, the impression of actual  cadential cessation, by continuing (instead of interrupting) the  rhythmic pulse.  This is so very common, and so confusing a device,  that the effect of the various methods employed to conceal or disguise  a cadence must be thoroughly understood.    It is necessary to remember, always, the rule that governs the actual  body of the phrase, and its possible preliminary tones; namely, that  the vital, essential starting-point of a phrase (and other factors of  musical form) is _the first primary accent_, the first beat of the  first _full_ measure.  The length of the phrase is reckoned from this  point, and consequently, the cadence-chord is entitled to all the beats  that remain, from its accent to the very end of the final measure.  For  example:    [Illustration: Example 19.  Fragment of Mozart.]    In this case the cadence-chord is not modified or disguised in the  least, but takes full advantage of the six beats that make the sum of  the fourth measure.    This important fact concerning the actual value of the cadence-chord  remains unchanged, through all the licenses taken in disguising or  (apparently) diminishing its value.  Whatever means may be resorted to,  in modifying the cadence, they do not alter the fact that _the  cadence-chord is always entitled to this full sum of beats_; and these  beats virtually represent the cadence-chord, either in its unchanged  form (as in Ex. 19 and Ex. 16) or in any of the manifold disguised  forms illustrated in the following examples.    One of the simplest forms is shown in Ex. 15:--The cadence-chord, on  the accented beat of the fourth measure, is entitled to the six beats"]]]
