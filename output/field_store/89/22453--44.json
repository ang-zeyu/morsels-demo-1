The houses agreed to this  proposal, and directed the following Ordinance to be published; which  bore this title--    \"AN ORDINANCE FOR THE BETTER OBSERVATION OF THE FEAST OF THE NATIVITY  OF CHRIST.    \"Whereas some doubts have been raised whether the next Fast shall be  celebrated, because it falleth on the day which, heretofore, was  usually called the Feast of the Nativity of our Saviour; the lords and  commons do order and ordain that public notice be given, that the Fast  appointed to be kept on the last Wednesday in every month, ought to be  observed until it be otherwise ordered by both houses; and that this  day particularly is to be kept with the more solemn humiliation,  because it may call to remembrance our sins and the sins of our  forefathers, who have turned this Feast, pretending the memory of  Christ, into an extreme forgetfulness of him, by giving liberty to  carnal and sensual delights; being contrary to the life which Christ  himself led here upon earth, and to the spiritual life of Christ in  our souls; for the sanctifying and saving whereof Christ was pleased  both to take a human life, and to lay it down again.    \"The lords ordered That the Lord Mayor of London take care that this  Ordinance should be dispersed to all churches and chapels, within the  line of communication and the bills of mortality. Afterwards it was  made general through the kingdom; in consequence of which Christmas  day was no longer observed as a Festival, by law, till the  Restoration.\"    But the popular love of Christmas could not be done away with by  restrictive legislation, as the movers therein very well knew, _teste_  Lightfoot, who, in his Journal, says \"Some of our members were sent to  the houses to desire them to give an order that the next Fast day  might be solemnly kept, because the people will be ready to neglect  it, being Christmas day.\"    Nor was anything neglected to repress this Christ-tide, because its  keeping was inbred in the people, and they hated this sour puritanical  feeling, and the doing away with their accustomed festivities. Richard  Kentish told the House of Commons so in very plain language. Said he:  \"The people of England do hate to be reformed; so now, a prelatical  priest, with a superstitious service book, is more desired, and would  be better welcome to the generality of England, than the most learned,  laborious, conscientious preacher, whether Presbyterian or  Independent. These poor simple creatures are mad after superstitious  festivals, after unholy holidays.\"    The houses of Parliament baked their pie for themselves, and  deservedly had to eat it; for two red hot gospellers, Calamy and  Sedgewick, preached on the iniquity of keeping Christ-tide to the  Lords in Westminster Abbey; whilst in the contiguous Church of S.  Margaret, Thorowgood and Langley expatiated on the same theme to the  Commons, and, as if they could not have enough of so good a thing,  _all four sermons were printed by order of the Houses_.    Calamy in his sermon said, \"This day is the day which is commonly  called the Feast of Christ's Nativity, or Christmas Day, a day that  hath hitherto been much abused in superstition and profaneness. I have  known some that have preferred Christmas Day before the Lord's Day,  and have cried down the Lord's Day and cried up Christmas Day. I have  known those that would be sure to receive the Sacrament on Christmas  Day though they did not receive it all the year after. This was the  superstition of this day, and the profaneness was as great. There were  some that did not play cards all the year long, yet they must play at  Christmas. This year, God, by a providence hath buried this Feast in a  Fast, and I hope it will never rise again. You have set out, Right  Honourable, a strict Order for the keeping of it, and you are here  to-day to observe your own Order, and I hope you will do it strictly.\"  And he finished with a prayer, in which he begged they might have  grace \"to be humbled, especially for the old superstition and  profaneness of this Feast.\"    But although the English people were crushed for a time under the iron  heel of the Puritan boot, they had no sympathy with their masters, nor  their ways--_vide_ the rebound, immediately after Oliver Cromwell's  death, and the return to the old state of things, which has never  altered since, except as a matter of fashion. Yet, even then, there  were protests against this effacement of Christ-tide, and many have  been handed down to us, differing naturally very much in style. One  really amusing one has the merit of being short: and when the reader  of this book has perused it, I believe he will thank me for having  reproduced it. It is--         \"THE         ARRAIGNMENT         Conviction and Imprisonment         of         CHRISTMAS         On _S.

Now, the very men who do all that quick bad work for us are  capable of doing perfect work. Only, perfect work can't be hurried, and  therefore it can't be cheap beyond a certain point. But suppose you pay  twelve times as much as you do now, and you have one woodcut for a  shilling instead of twelve; and the one woodcut for a shilling is as  good as art can be, so that you will never tire of looking at it; and is  struck on good paper with good ink, so that you will never wear it out  by handling it; while you are sick of your penny-each cuts by the end of  the week, and have torn them mostly in half too. Isn't your shilling's  worth the best bargain?      41. It is not, however, only in getting prints or woodcuts of the best  kind that you will practise economy. There is a certain quality about an  original drawing which you cannot get in a woodcut, and the best part of  the genius of many men is only expressible in original work, whether  with pen or ink--pencil or colours. This is not always the case; but in  general, the best men are those who can only express themselves on paper  or canvas; and you will therefore, in the long run, get most for your  money by buying original work; proceeding on the principle already laid  down, that the best is likely to be the cheapest in the end. Of course,  original work cannot be produced under a certain cost. If you want a  man to make you a drawing which takes him six days, you must, at all  events, keep him for six days in bread and water, fire and lodging; that  is the lowest price at which he can do it for you, but that is not very  dear: and the best bargain which can possibly be made honestly in  art--the very ideal of a cheap purchase to the purchaser--is the  original work of a great man fed for as many days as are necessary on  bread and water, or perhaps we may say with as many onions as will keep  him in good humour. That is the way by which you will always get most  for your money; no mechanical multiplication or ingenuity of commercial  arrangements will ever get you a better penny's worth of art than that.      42. Without, however, pushing our calculations quite to this  prison-discipline extreme, we may lay it down as a rule in art-economy,  that original work is, on the whole, cheapest and best worth having. But  precisely in proportion to the value of it as a production, becomes the  importance of having it executed in permanent materials. And here we  come to note the second main error of the day, that we not only ask our  workmen for bad art, but we make them put it into bad substance. We  have, for example, put a great quantity of genius, within the last  twenty years, into water-colour drawing, and we have done this with the  most reckless disregard whether either the colours or the paper will  stand. In most instances, neither will. By accident, it may happen that  the colours in a given drawing have been of good quality, and its paper  uninjured by chemical processes. But you take not the least care to  ensure these being so; I have myself seen the most destructive changes  take place in water-colour drawings within twenty years after they were  painted; and from all I can gather respecting the recklessness of modern  paper manufacture, my belief is, that though you may still handle an  Albert Duerer engraving, two hundred years old, fearlessly, not one-half  of that time will have passed over your modern water-colours, before  most of them will be reduced to mere white or brown rags; and your  descendants, twitching them contemptuously into fragments between finger  and thumb, will mutter against you, half in scorn and half in anger,  \"Those wretched nineteenth century people! they kept vapouring and  fuming about the world, doing what they called business, and they  couldn't make a sheet of paper that wasn't rotten.\"      43. And note that this is no unimportant portion of your art economy at  this time. Your water-colour painters are becoming every day capable of  expressing greater and better things; and their material is especially  adapted to the turn of your best artists' minds. The value which you  could accumulate in work of this kind would soon become a most important  item in the national art-wealth, if only you would take the little pains  necessary to secure its permanence. I am inclined to think, myself, that  water-colour ought not to be used on paper at all, but only on vellum,  and then, if properly taken care of, the drawing would be almost  imperishable. Still, paper is a much more convenient material for rapid  work; and it is an infinite absurdity not to secure the goodness of its  quality, when we could do so without the slightest trouble. Among the  many favours which I am going to ask from our paternal government, when  we get it, will be that it will supply its little boys with good paper.  You have nothing to do but to let the government establish a paper  manufactory, under the superintendence of any of our leading chemists,  who should be answerable for the safety and completeness of all the  processes of the manufacture. The government stamp on the corner of your  sheet of drawing-paper, made in the perfect way, should cost you a  shilling, which would add something to the revenue; and when you bought  a water-colour drawing for fifty or a hundred guineas, you would have  merely to look in the corner for your stamp, and pay your extra shilling  for the security that your hundred guineas were given really for a  drawing, and not for a coloured rag. There need be no monopoly or  restriction in the matter; let the paper manufacturers compete with the  government, and if people liked to save their shilling, and take their  chance, let them; only, the artist and purchaser might then be sure of  good material, if they liked, and now they cannot be.      44. I should like also to have a government colour manufactory; though  that is not so necessary, as the quality of colour is more within the  artist's power of testing, and I have no doubt that any painter may get  permanent colour from the respectable manufacturers, if he chooses. I  will not attempt to follow the subject out at all as it respects  architecture, and our methods of modern building; respecting which I  have had occasion to speak before now.      45. But I cannot pass without some brief notice our habit--continually,  as it seems to me, gaining strength--of putting a large quantity of  thought and work, annually, into things which are either in their nature  necessarily perishable, as dress; or else into compliances with the  fashion of the day, in things not necessarily perishable, as plate. I am  afraid almost the first idea of a young rich couple setting up house in  London, is, that they must have new plate. Their father's plate may be  very handsome, but the fashion is changed. They will have a new service  from the leading manufacturer, and the old plate, except a few apostle  spoons, and a cup which Charles the Second drank a health in to their  pretty ancestress, is sent to be melted down, and made up with new  flourishes and fresh lustre. Now, so long as this is the case--so long,  observe, as fashion has influence on the manufacture of plate--so long  _you cannot have a goldsmith's art in this country_. Do you suppose any  workman worthy the name will put his brains into a cup, or an urn, which  he knows is to go to the melting-pot in half a score years? He will not;  you don't ask or expect it of him. You ask of him nothing but a little  quick handicraft--a clever twist of a handle here, and a foot there, a  convolvulus from the newest school of design, a pheasant from Landseer's  game cards; a couple of sentimental figures for supporters, in the style  of the signs of insurance offices, then a clever touch with the  burnisher, and there's your epergne, the admiration of all the footmen  at the wedding-breakfast, and the torment of some unfortunate youth who  cannot see the pretty girl opposite to him, through its tyrannous  branches.      46. But you don't suppose that _that's_ goldsmith's work? Goldsmith's  work is made to last, and made with the men's whole heart and soul in  it; true goldsmith's work, when it exists, is generally the means of  education of the greatest painters and sculptors of the day. Francia was  a goldsmith; Francia was not his own name, but that of his master the  jeweller; and he signed his pictures almost always, \"Francia, the  goldsmith,\" for love of his master; Ghirlandajo was a goldsmith, and was  the master of Michael Angelo; Verrocchio was a goldsmith, and was the  master of Leonardo da Vinci. Ghiberti was a goldsmith, and beat out the  bronze gates which Michael Angelo said might serve for gates of  Paradise.[7] But if ever you want work like theirs again, you must keep  it, though it should have the misfortune to become old-fashioned. You  must not break it up, nor melt it any more. There is no economy in that;  you could not easily waste intellect more grievously. Nature may melt  her goldsmith's work at every sunset if she chooses; and beat it out  into chased bars again at every sunrise; but you must not. The way to  have a truly noble service of plate, is to keep adding to it, not  melting it. At every marriage, and at every birth, get a new piece of  gold or silver if you will, but with noble workmanship on it, done for  all time, and put it among your treasures; that is one of the chief  things which gold was made for, and made incorruptible for. When we know  a little more of political economy, we shall find that none but  partially savage nations need, imperatively, gold for their currency;[8]  but gold has been given us, among other things, that we might put  beautiful work into its imperishable splendour, and that the artists who  have the most wilful fancies may have a material which will drag out,  and beat out, as their dreams require, and will hold itself together  with fantastic"]]]
