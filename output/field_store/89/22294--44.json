All  the arts of life, above all painting and domestic architecture,  nourished at Brussels; and nowhere were troops so well equipped,  burghers more prosperous, learning more widespread, than in his domains.  Here, too, were the most ceremonious courtesy, the most splendid  banquets, and the most wonderful display of jewels, plate, and  cloth-of-gold. Charles VII., a clever though a cold-hearted, indolent  man, let Philip alone, already seeing how the game would go for the  future; for when the dauphin had quarrelled with the reigning favourite,  and was kindly received on his flight to Burgundy, the old king sneered,  saying that the duke was fostering the fox who would steal his chickens.      2. Louis XI.'s Policy.--_Louis XI._ succeeded his father Charles in  1461. He was a man of great skill and craft, with an iron will, and  subtle though pitiless nature, who knew in what the greatness of a king  consisted, and worked out his ends mercilessly and unscrupulously. The  old feudal dukes and counts had all passed away, except the Duke of  Brittany; but the Dukes of Orleans, Burgundy, and Anjou held princely  appanages, and there was a turbulent nobility who had grown up during  the wars, foreign and civil, and been encouraged by the favouritism of  Charles VI. All these, feeling that Louis was their natural foe, united  against him in what was called the \"League of the Public Good,\" with his  own brother, the Duke of Berry, and Count Charles of Charolais, who was  known as Charles the Bold, the son of Duke Philip of Burgundy, at their  head. Louis was actually defeated by Charles of Charolais in the battle  of Montlhery; but he contrived so cleverly to break up the league, by  promises to each member and by sowing dissension among them, that he  ended by becoming more powerful than before.      3. Charles the Bold.--On the death of Philip the Good, in 1467,  Charles the Bold succeeded to the duchy of Burgundy. He pursued more  ardently the plan of forming a new kingdom of Burgundy, and had even  hopes of being chosen Emperor. First, however, he had to consolidate his  dominions, by making himself master of the countries which parted  Burgundy from the Netherlands. With this view he obtained Elsass in  pledge from its owner, a needy son of the house of Austria, who was  never likely to redeem it. Lorraine had been inherited by Yolande, the  wife of Rene, Duke of Anjou and titular King of Sicily, and had passed  from her to her daughter, who had married the nearest heir in the male  line, the Count of Vaudemont; but Charles the Bold unjustly seized the  dukedom, driving out the lawful heir, Rene de Vaudemont, son of this  marriage. Louis, meantime, was on the watch for every error of Charles,  and constantly sowing dangers in his path. Sometimes his mines exploded  too soon, as when he had actually put himself into Charles's power by  visiting him at Peronne at the very moment when his emissaries had  encouraged the city of Liege to rise in revolt against their bishop, an  ally of the duke; and he only bought his freedom by profuse promises,  and by aiding Charles in a most savage destruction of Liege. But after  this his caution prevailed. He gave secret support to the adherents of  Rene de Vaudemont, and intrigued with the Swiss, who were often at issue  with the Burgundian bailiffs and soldiery in Elsass--greedy, reckless  men, from whom the men of Elsass revolted in favour of their former  Austrian lord. Meantime Edward IV. of England, Charles's brother-in-law,  had planned with him an invasion of France and division of the kingdom,  and in 1475 actually crossed the sea with a splendid host; but while  Charles was prevented from joining him by the siege of Neuss, a city in  alliance with Sigismund of Austria, Louis met Edward on the bridge of  Pecquigny, and by cajolery, bribery, and accusations of Charles,  contrived to persuade him to carry home his army without striking a  blow. That meeting was a curious one. A wooden barrier, like a wild  beast's cage, was erected in the middle of the bridge, through which the  two kings kissed one another. Edward was the tallest and handsomest man  present, and splendidly attired. Louis was small and mean-looking, and  clad in an old blue suit, with a hat decorated with little leaden images  of the saints, but his smooth tongue quite overcame the duller intellect  of Edward; and in the mean time the English soldiers were feasted and  allowed their full swing, the French being strictly watched to prevent  all quarrels. So skilfully did Louis manage, that Edward consented to  make peace and return home.      4. The Fall of Charles the Bold (1477).--Charles had become entangled  in many difficulties. He was a harsh, stern man, much disliked; and his  governors in Elsass were fierce, violent men, who used every pretext for  preying upon travellers. The Governor of Breisach, Hagenbach, had been  put to death in a popular rising, aided by the Swiss of Berne, in 1474;  and the men of Elsass themselves raised part of the sum for which the  country had been pledged, and revolted against Charles. The Swiss were  incited by Louis to join them; Rene of Lorraine made common cause with  them. In two great battles, Granson and Morat, Charles and all his  chivalry were beaten by the Swiss pikemen; but he pushed on the war.  Nancy, the chief city of Lorraine, had risen against him, and he  besieged it. On the night of the 5th of January, 1477, Rene led the  Swiss to relieve the town by falling in early morning on the besiegers'  camp. There was a terrible fight; the Burgundians were routed, and after  long search the corpse of Duke Charles was found in a frozen pool,  stripped, plundered, and covered with blood. He was the last of the male  line of Burgundy, and its great possessions broke up with his death. His  only child, Marie, did not inherit the French dukedom nor the county,  though most of the fiefs in the Low Countries, which could descend to  the female line, were her undisputed portion. Louis tried, by stirring  up her subjects, to force her into a marriage with his son Charles; but  she threw herself on the protection of the house of Austria, and  marrying Maximilian, son of the Emperor Frederick III., carried her  border lands to swell the power of his family.      5. Louis's Home Government.--Louis's system of repression of the  nobles went on all this time. His counsellors were of low birth (Oliver  le Daim, his barber, was the man he most trusted), his habits frugal,  his manners reserved and ironical; he was dreaded, hated, and  distrusted, and he became constantly more bitter, suspicious, and  merciless. Those who fell under his displeasure were imprisoned in iron  cages, or put to death; and the more turbulent families, such as the  house of Armagnac, were treated with frightful severity. But his was not  wanton violence. He acted on a regular system of depressing the lawless  nobility and increasing the royal authority, by bringing the power of  the cities forward, by trusting for protection to the standing army,  chiefly of hired Scots, Swiss, and Italians, and by saving money. By  this means he was able to purchase the counties of Roussillon and  Perpignan from the King of Aragon, thus making the Pyrenees his  frontier, and on several occasions he made his treasury fight his  battles instead of the swords of his knights. He lived in the castle of  Plessis les Tours, guarded by the utmost art of fortification, and  filled with hired Scottish archers of his guard, whom he preferred as  defenders to his own nobles. He was exceedingly unpopular with his  nobles; but the statesman and historian, Philip de Comines, who had gone  over to him from Charles of Burgundy, viewed him as the best and ablest  of kings. He did much to promote trade and manufacture, improved the  cities, fostered the university, and was in truth the first king since  Philip Augustus who had any real sense of statesmanship. But though the  burghers throve under him, and the lawless nobles were depressed, the  state of the peasants was not improved; feudal rights pressed heavily on  them, and they were little better than savages, ground down by burthens  imposed by their lords.      6. Provence and Brittany.--Louis had added much to the French  monarchy. He had won back Artois; he had seized the duchy and county of  Burgundy; he had bought Roussillon. His last acquisition was the county  of Provence. The second Angevin family, beginning with Louis, the son of  King John, had never succeeded in gaining a footing in Naples, though  they bore the royal title. They held, however, the imperial fief of  Provence, and Louis XI., whose mother had been of this family, obtained  from her two brothers, Rene and Charles, that Provence should be  bequeathed to him instead of passing to Rene's grandson, the Duke of  Lorraine. The Kings of France were thenceforth Counts of Provence; and  though the county was not viewed as part of the kingdom, it was  practically one with it. A yet greater acquisition was made soon after  Louis's death in 1483. The great Celtic duchy of Brittany fell to a  female, Anne of Brittany, and the address of Louis's daughter, the Lady  of Beaujeu, who was regent of the realm, prevailed to secure the hand of  the heiress for her brother, Charles VIII. Thus the crown of France had  by purchase, conquest, or inheritance, obtained all the great feudal  states that made up the country between the English Channel and the  Pyrenees; but each still remained a separate state, with different laws  and customs, and a separate parliament in each to register laws, and to  act as a court of justice.
