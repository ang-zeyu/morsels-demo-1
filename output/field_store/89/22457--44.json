A policeman had his hand up checking the traffic. His glance  fell on Jane--the effect was electrical. His eyes bulged, his cheeks  whitened, his chest heaved, his hand dropped, and he would undoubtedly  have fallen had not a good Samaritan, in the guise of a non-psychical  public-house loafer, held him up. Jane was now close to the chemist's,  and it was with a sigh of relief that I saw her glide in and  disappear.    Had there been any doubt at all, after my first encounter with Jane,  as to her being superphysical, there was certainly none now. The  policeman's paroxysm of fear and the horse's fit of shying were facts.  What had produced them? I alone knew--and I knew for certain--it was  Jane. Both man and animal saw what I saw. Hence the phantom was not  subjective; it was not illusionary; it was a _bona fide_ spirit  manifestation--a visitant from the other world--the world of  earthbound souls. Jane fascinated me. I made endless researches in  connection with her, and, in answer to one of my inquiries, I was  informed that eighteen years ago--that is to say, about the time  Jane's dress was in fashion--the chemist's shop had been occupied by a  dressmaker of the name of Bosworth. I hunted up Miss Bosworth's  address and called on her. She had retired from business and was  living in St. Michael's Road, Bournemouth. I came to the point  straight.    \"Can you give me any information,\" I asked, \"about a lady whose  Christian name was Jane?\"    \"That sounds vague!\" Miss Bosworth said. \"I've met a good many Janes  in my time.\"    \"But not Janes with pale yellow hair, and white eyebrows and  eyelashes!\" And I described her in detail.    \"How do you come to know about her?\" Miss Bosworth said, after a long  pause.    \"Because,\" I replied with a certain slowness and deliberation  characteristic of me, \"because I've seen her ghost!\"    Of course I knew Miss Bosworth was no sceptic--the moment my eyes  rested on her I saw she was psychic, and that the superphysical was  often at her elbow. Accordingly, I was not in the least surprised at  her look of horror.    \"What!\" she exclaimed, \"is she still there? I thought she would surely  be at rest now!\"    \"Who was she?\" I inquired. \"Come--you need not be afraid of me. I have  come here solely because the occult has always interested me. Who was  Jane, and why should her ghost haunt George Street?\"    \"It happened a good many years ago,\" Miss Bosworth replied, \"in 1892.  In answer to an advertisement I saw in one of the daily papers, I  called on a Miss Jane Vernelt--Mademoiselle Vernelt she called  herself--who ran a costumier's business in George Street, in the very  building, in fact now occupied by the chemist you have mentioned. The  business was for sale, and Miss Vernelt wanted a big sum for it.  However, as her books showed a very satisfactory annual increase in  receipts and her clientele included a duchess and other society  leaders, I considered the bargain a tolerably safe one, and we came to  terms. Within a week I was running the business, and, exactly a month  after I had taken it over, I was greatly astonished to receive a visit  from Miss Vernelt. She came into the shop quite beside herself with  agitation. 'It's all a mistake!' she screamed. 'I didn't want to sell  it. I can't do anything with my capital. Let me buy it back.' I  listened to her politely, and then informed her that as I had gone to  all the trouble of taking over the business and had already succeeded  in extending it, I most certainly had no intention of selling it--at  least not for some time. Well, she behaved like a lunatic, and in the  end created such a disturbance that I had to summon my assistants and  actually turn her out. After that I had no peace for six weeks. She  came every day, at any and all times, and I was at last obliged to  take legal proceedings. I then discovered that her mind was really  unhinged, and that she had been suffering from softening of the brain  for many months. Her medical advisers had, it appeared, warned her to  give up business and place herself in the hands of trustworthy friends  or relations, who would see that her money was properly invested, but  she had delayed doing so; and when, at last, she did make up her mind  to retire, the excitement, resulting from so great a change in her  mode of living, accelerated the disease, and, exactly three weeks  after the sale of her business, she became a victim to the delusion  that she was ruined. This delusion grew more and more pronounced as  her malady increased, and amidst her wildest ravings she clamoured to  be taken back to George Street. The hauntings, indeed, began before  she died; and I frequently saw her--when I knew her material body to  be under restraint--just as you describe, gliding in and out the  show-rooms.    \"For several weeks after her death, the manifestations continued--they  then ceased, and I have never heard of her again until now.\"    If I remember rightly the account of the George Street ghost here  terminated; but my friend referred to it again at the close of his  letter.    \"Since my return to Scotland,\" he wrote, \"I have frequently visited  George Street, almost daily, but I have not seen 'Jane.' I only hope  that her poor distracted spirit has at last found rest.\" And with this  kindly sentiment my correspondent concluded.                                    CASE V        THE SALLOW-FACED WOMAN OF NO. -- FORREST        ROAD, EDINBURGH      The Public unfortunately includes a certain set of people, of the  middle class very \"middlish,\" who are ever on the look-out for some  opportunity, however slight and seemingly remote, of bettering  themselves socially; and, learning that those in a higher strata of  society are interested in the supernatural, they think that they may  possibly get in touch with them by working up a little local  reputation for psychical research. I have often had letters from this  type of \"pusher\" (letters from genuine believers in the Occult I  always welcome) stating that they have been greatly interested in my  books--would I be so very kind as to grant them a brief interview, or  permit them to accompany me to a haunted house, or give them certain  information with regard to Lady So-and-so, whom they have long wanted  to know? Occasionally, I have been so taken in as to give permission  to the writer to call on me, and almost always I have bitterly  repented. The wily one--no matter how wily--cannot conceal the cloven  hoof for long, and he has either tried to thrust himself into the  bosom of my family, or has written to my neighbours declaring himself  to be my dearest friend; and when, in desperation, I have shown him  the cold shoulder, he has attacked me virulently in some \"rag\" of a  local paper, the proprietor, editor, or office-boy of which happens to  be one of his own clique. I have even known an instance where this  type of person has, through trickery, actually gained access to some  notoriously haunted house, and from its owners--the family he has long  had his eyes on, from a motive anything but psychic--has ferreted out  the secret and private history of the haunting. Then, when he has been  \"found out\" and forced to see that his friendship is not wanted, he  has, in revenge for the slight, unblushingly revealed the facts that  were only entrusted to him in the strictest confidence; and, through  influence with the lower stratum of the Press, caused a most glaring  and sensational account of the ghost to be published.    With such a case in view, I cannot be surprised that possessors of  family ghosts and haunted houses should show the greatest reluctance  to be approached on the subject, save by those they feel assured will  treat it with the utmost delicacy.    But I have quoted the above breach of confidence merely to give  another reason for my constant use of fictitious names with regard to  people and places, and having done so (I hope to some purpose), I will  proceed with the following story:--    Miss Dulcie Vincent, some of whose reminiscences appeared in my book  of _Ghostly Phenomena_ last year, is nearly connected with Lady Adela  Minkon, who owns a considerable amount of house property, including  No. -- Forrest Road, in Edinburgh, and whose yacht at Cowes is the  envy of all who have cruised in her. Three years ago, Lady Adela  stayed at No. -- Forrest Road. She had heard that the house was  haunted, and was anxious to put it to the test. Lady Adela was  perfectly open-minded. She had never experienced any occult phenomena  herself, but, very rationally, she did not consider that her  non-acquaintance with the superphysical in any way negatived the  evidence of those who declare that they have witnessed manifestations;  their statements, she reasoned, were just as worthy of credence as  hers. She thus commenced her occupation of the house with a perfectly  unbiased mind, resolved to stay there for at least a year, so as to  give it a fair trial. The hauntings, she was told, were at their  height in the late summer and early autumn. It is, I think,  unnecessary to enter into any detailed description of her house. In  appearance, it differed very little, if at all, from those adjoining  it; in construction, it was if anything a trifle larger. The basement,  which included the usual kitchen offices and cellars, was very dark,  and the atmosphere--after sunset on Fridays, only on Fridays--was  tainted with a smell of damp earth, shockingly damp earth, and of a  sweet and nauseating something that greatly puzzled Lady Adela. All  the rooms in the house were of fair dimensions, and cheerful,  excepting on this particular evening of the week; a distinct gloom  settled on them then, and the strangest of shadows were seen playing  about the passages and on the landings.    \"It may be fancy,\" Lady Adela said to herself, \"merely fancy!"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2005"],[0,"Piccadilly Jim (#7)"],[1,"managed to preserve during the opening stages of the  interview now definitely disappeared. His eyes shone wildly and  he snorted like a war-horse. He clutched the butler by the sleeve  and drew him closer to the table, then began to move forks,  spoons, cups, and even the contents of his plate about the cloth  with an energy little short of feverish.    \"Bayliss!\"    \"Sir?\"    \"Watch!\" said Mr. Crocker, with the air of an excitable high  priest about to initiate a novice into the Mysteries.    He removed a roll from the basket.    \"You see this roll? That's the home plate. This spoon is first  base. Where I'm putting this cup is second. This piece of bacon  is third. There's your diamond for you. Very well, then. These  lumps of sugar are the infielders and the outfielders. Now we're  ready. Batter up? He stands here. Catcher behind him. Umps behind  catcher.\"    \"Umps, I take it, sir, is what we would call the umpire?\"    \"Call him anything you like. It's part of the game. Now here's  the box, where I've put this dab of marmalade, and here's the  pitcher, winding up.\"    \"The pitcher would be equivalent to our bowler?\"    \"I guess so, though why you should call him a bowler gets past  me.\"    \"The box, then, is the bowler's wicket?\"    \"Have it your own way. Now pay attention. Play ball! Pitcher's  winding up. Put it over, Mike, put it over! Some speed, kid! Here  it comes, right in the groove. Bing! Batter slams it and streaks  for first. Outfielder--this lump of sugar--boots it. Bonehead!  Batter touches second. Third? No! Get back! Can't be done. Play  it safe. Stick around the sack, old pal. Second batter up.  Pitcher getting something on the ball now besides the cover.  Whiffs him. Back to the bench, Cyril! Third batter up. See him  rub his hands in the dirt. Watch this kid. He's good! He lets  two alone, then slams the next right on the nose. Whizzes around  to second. First guy, the one we left on second, comes home for  one run. That's a game! Take it from me, Bill, that's a _game!_\"    Somewhat overcome with the energy with which he had flung himself  into his lecture, Mr. Crocker sat down and refreshed himself with  cold coffee.    \"Quite an interesting game,\" said Bayliss. \"But I find, now that  you have explained it, sir, that it is familiar to me, though I  have always known it under another name. It is played a great  deal in this country.\"    Mr. Crocker started to his feet.    \"It is? And I've been five years here without finding it out!  When's the next game scheduled?\"    \"It is known in England as Rounders, sir. Children play it with a  soft ball and a racquet, and derive considerable enjoyment from  it. I had never heard of it before as a pastime for adults.\"    Two shocked eyes stared into the butler's face.    \"Children?\" The word came in a whisper.    \"A racquet?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"You--you didn't say a soft ball?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    A sort of spasm seemed to convulse Mr. Crocker. He had lived five  years in England, but not till this moment had he realised to the  full how utterly alone he was in an alien land. Fate had placed  him, bound and helpless, in a country where they called baseball  Rounders and played it with a soft ball.    He sank back into his chair, staring before him. And as he sat  the wall seemed to melt and he was gazing upon a green field, in  the centre of which a man in a grey uniform was beginning a  Salome dance. Watching this person with a cold and suspicious  eye, stood another uniformed man, holding poised above his  shoulder a sturdy club. Two Masked Marvels crouched behind him in  attitudes of watchful waiting. On wooden seats all around sat a  vast multitude of shirt-sleeved spectators, and the air was full  of voices.    One voice detached itself from the din.    \"Pea-nuts! Get y'r pea-nuts!\"    Something that was almost a sob shook Bingley Crocker's ample  frame. Bayliss the butler gazed down upon him with concern. He  was sure the master was unwell.    The case of Mr. Bingley Crocker was one that would have provided  an admirable \"instance\" for a preacher seeking to instil into an  impecunious and sceptical flock the lesson that money does not of  necessity bring with it happiness. And poetry has crystallised  his position in the following stanza.        An exile from home splendour dazzles in vain.      Oh, give me my lowly thatched cottage again;      The birds singing gaily, that came at my call,      Give me them, and that peace of mind dearer than all.    Mr. Crocker had never lived in a thatched cottage, nor had his  relations with the birds of his native land ever reached the  stage of intimacy indicated by the poet; but substitute \"Lambs  Club\" for the former and \"members\" for the latter, and the  parallel becomes complete.    Until the time of his second marriage Bingley Crocker had been an  actor, a snapper-up of whatever small character-parts the gods  provided. He had an excellent disposition, no money, and one son,  a young man of twenty-one. For forty-five years he had lived a  hand-to-mouth existence in which his next meal had generally come  as a pleasant surprise: and then, on an Atlantic liner, he met  the widow of G. G. van Brunt, the sole heiress to that magnate's  immense fortune.    What Mrs. van Brunt could have seen in Bingley Crocker to cause  her to single him out from all the world passes comprehension:  but the eccentricities of Cupid are commonplace. It were best to  shun examination into first causes and stick to results. The  swift romance began and reached its climax in the ten days which  it took one of the smaller Atlantic liners to sail from Liverpool  to New York. Mr. Crocker was on board because he was returning  with a theatrical company from a failure in London, Mrs. van  Brunt because she had been told that the slow boats were the  steadiest. They began the voyage as strangers and ended it as an  engaged couple--the affair being expedited, no doubt, by the fact  that, even if it ever occurred to Bingley to resist the onslaught  on his bachelor peace, he soon realised the futility of doing so,  for the cramped conditions of ship-board intensified the always  overwhelming effects of his future bride's determined nature.    The engagement was received in a widely differing spirit by the  only surviving blood-relations of the two principals. Jimmy, Mr.  Crocker's son, on being informed that his father had plighted his  troth to the widow of a prominent millionaire, displayed the  utmost gratification and enthusiasm, and at a little supper which  he gave by way of farewell to a few of his newspaper comrades and  which lasted till six in the morning, when it was broken up by  the flying wedge of waiters for which the selected restaurant is  justly famous, joyfully announced that work and he would from  then on be total strangers. He alluded in feeling terms to the  Providence which watches over good young men and saves them from  the blighting necessity of offering themselves in the flower of  their golden youth as human sacrifices to the Moloch of  capitalistic greed: and, having commiserated with his guests in  that a similar stroke of luck had not happened to each of them,  advised them to drown their sorrows in drink. Which they did.    Far different was the attitude of Mrs. Crocker's sister, Nesta  Pett. She entirely disapproved of the proposed match. At least,  the fact that in her final interview with her sister she  described the bridegroom-to-be as a wretched mummer, a despicable  fortune-hunter, a broken-down tramp, and a sneaking, grafting  confidence-trickster lends colour to the supposition that she was  not a warm supporter of it. She agreed wholeheartedly with Mrs.  Crocker's suggestion that they should never speak to each other  again as long as they lived: and it was immediately after this  that the latter removed husband Bingley, step-son Jimmy, and all  her other goods and chattels to London, where they had remained  ever since. Whenever Mrs. Crocker spoke of America now, it was in  tones of the deepest dislike and contempt. Her friends were  English, and every year more exclusively of England's  aristocracy. She intended to become a leading figure in London  Society, and already her progress had been astonishing. She knew  the right people, lived in the right square, said the right  things, and thought the right thoughts: and in the Spring of her  third year had succeeded in curing Bingley of his habit of  beginning his remarks with the words \"Say, lemme tell ya  something.\" Her progress, in short, was beginning to assume the  aspect of a walk-over.    Against her complete contentment and satisfaction only one thing  militated. That was the behaviour of her step-son, Jimmy.    It was of Jimmy that she spoke when, having hung the receiver on  its hook, she returned to the breakfast-room. Bayliss had  silently withdrawn, and Mr. Crocker was sitting in sombre silence  at the table.    \"A most fortunate thing has happened, Bingley,\" she said. \"It was  most kind of dear Lady Corstorphine to ring me up. It seems that  her nephew, Lord Percy Whipple, is back in England. He has been  in Ireland for the past three years, on the staff of the Lord  Lieutenant, and only arrived in London yesterday afternoon. Lady  Corstorphine has promised to arrange a meeting between him and  James. I particularly want them to be friends.\"    \"Eugenia,\" said Mr. Crocker in a hollow voice, \"do you know they  call baseball Rounders over here, and children play it with a  soft ball?\"    \"James is becoming a serious problem. It is absolutely necessary  that he should make friends with the right kind of young men.\"    \"And a racquet,\" said Mr. Crocker.    \"Please listen to what I am saying, Bingley. I am talking about  James. There is a crude American strain in him which seems to  grow worse instead of better. I was lunching with the Delafields  at the Carlton yesterday, and there, only a few tables away, was  James with an"]]]
