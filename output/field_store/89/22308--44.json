That HOMBRE has got something on his mind.\"    \"Well, by golly, it ain't dry-farmers,\" Slim asserted boldly.    \"If you fellows wouldn't say it was a frame-up between us two, I'd go  after him and find out. But...\"    \"But as it stands, we'd believe Andy Green a whole lot quicker'n what we  would you,\" supplemented Big Medicine loudly. \"You're dead right there.\"    \"What was it he said about it?\" Weary wanted to know. \"I wasn't paying  much attention, with the Kid yelling his head off and old Silver gaping  like a sick turkey, and all. What was it about them dryfarmers?\"    \"He said,\" piped Pink, \"that he'd got next to a scheme to bring a big  bunch of dry-farmers in on this bench up here, with stock that they'd  turn loose on the range. That's what he said. He claims the agent wanted  him to go in on it.\"    \"Mamma!\" Weary held a match poised midway between his thigh and his  cigarette while he stared at Pink. \"That would be some mixup--if it was  to happen.\" His sunny blue eyes--that were getting little crow's-feet  at their corners--turned to look after the departing Andy. \"Where's the  josh?\" he questioned the group.    \"The josh is, that he'd like to see us all het up over it, and makin'  war-talks and laying for the pilgrims some dark night with our six-guns,  most likely,\" retorted Pink, who happened to be in a bad humor because  in ten minutes he was due at a line of post-holes that divided the big  pasture into two unequal parts. \"He can't agitate me over anybody's  troubles but my own. Happy, I'll help Bud stretch wire this afternoon if  you'll tamp the rest uh them posts.\"    \"Aw, you stick to your own job! How was it when I wanted you to help  pull the old wire off that hill fence and git it ready to string down  here? You wasn't crazy about workin' with bob wire then, I noticed. You  said--\"    \"What I said wasn't a commencement to what I'll say again,\" Pink began  truculently, and so the subject turned effectually from Andy Green.    Weary smoked meditatively while they wrangled, and when the group broke  up for the afternoon's work he went unobtrusively in search of Andy.  He was not quite easy in his mind concerning the alleged joke. He had  looked full at the possibilities of the situation--granting Andy had  told the truth, as he sometimes did--and the possibilities had not  pleased him. He found Andy morosely replacing some broken strands in his  cinch, and he went straight at the mooted question.    Andy looked up from his work and scowled. \"This ain't any joke with me,\"  he stated grimly. \"It's something that's going to put the Flying U  out of business if it ain't stopped before it gets started. I've been  worrying my head off ever since day before yesterday; I ain't in the  humor to take anything off those imitation joshers up there--I'll tell  yuh that much.\"    \"Well, but how do you figure it can be stopped?\" Weary sat soberly down  on the oats box and absently watched Andy's expert fingers while they  knotted the heavy cotton cord through the cinch-ring. \"We can't stand  'em off with guns.\"    Andy dropped the cinch and stood up, pushing back his hat and then  pulling it forward into place with the gesture he used when he was very  much in earnest. \"No, we can't. But if the bunch is game for it there's  a way to block their play--and the law does all our fighting for us. We  don't have to yeep. It's like this, Weary counting Chip and the Little  Doctor and the Countess there's eleven of us that can use our rights up  here on the bench. I've got it all figured out. If we can get Irish and  Jack Bates to come back and help us out, there's thirteen of us. And  we can take homesteads along the creeks and deserts back on the bench,  and--say, do you know how much land we can corral, the bunch of us? Four  thousand acres and if we take our claims right, that's going to mean  that we get a dead immortal cinch on all the bench land that's worth  locating, around here, and we'll have the creeks, and also we'll have  the breaks corralled for our own stock.    \"I've gone over the plat--I brought a copy to show you fellows what we  can do. And by taking up our claims right, we keep a deadline from the  Bear Paws to the Flying U. Now the Old Man owns Denson's ranch, all  south uh here is fairly safe--unless they come in between his south line  and the breaks; and there ain't room for more than two or three claims  there. Maybe we can get some of the boys to grab what there is, and  string ourselves out north uh here too.    \"That's the only way on earth we can save what little feed there is  left. This way, we get the land ourselves and hold it, so there don't  any outside stock come in on us. If Florence Grace Hallman and her bunch  lands any settlers here, they'll be between us and Dry Lake; and they're  dead welcome to squat on them dry pinnacles--so long as we keep their  stock from crossing our claims to get into the breaks. Savvy the burro?\"    \"Yes-s--but how'd yuh KNOW they're going to do all this? Mamma! I don't  want to turn dry-farmer if I don't have to!\"    Andy's face clouded. \"That's just what'll block the game, I'm afraid. I  don't want to, either. None of the boys'll want to. It'll mean going  up there and baching, six or seven months of the year, by our high  lonesomes. We'll have to fulfill the requirements, if we start  in--because them pilgrims'll be standing around like dogs at a picnic,  waiting for something to drop so they can grab it and run. It ain't  going to be any snap.    \"And there's another thing bothers me, Weary. It's going to be one peach  of a job to make the boys believe it hard enough to make their entries  in time.\" Andy grinned wrily. \"By gracious, this is where I could see a  gilt-edged reputation for telling the truth!\"    \"You could, all right,\" Weary agreed sympathetically. \"It's going to  strain our swallowers to get all that down, and that's a fact. You ought  to have some proof, if you want the boys to grab it, Andy.\" His face  sobered. \"Who is this Florence person? If you could get some kinda  proof--a letter, say...\"    \"Easiest thing in the world!\" Andy brightened at the suggestion. \"She's  stopping at the Park, in Great Falls, and she wanted me to come up or  write. Anybody going to town right away? I'll send that foxy dame a  letter that'll produce proof enough. You've helped ma a lot, Weary.\"    Weary scrutinized him sharply and puckered his lips into a doubtful  expression. \"I wish I knew for a fact whether all this is straight  goods, Andy,\" he said pensively. \"Chances are you're just stringing me.  But if you are, old boy, I'm going to take it outa your hide--and don't  you forget that.\" He grinned at his own mental predicament. \"Honest,  Andy, is this some josh, or do you mean it?\"    \"By gracious, I wish it was a josh! But it ain't, darn it. In about  two weeks or so you'll all see the point of this joke--but whether the  joke's on us or on the homeseekers' Syndicate depends on you fellows.  Lord! I wish I'd never told a lie!\"    Weary sat knocking his heels rhythmically against the side of the box  while he thought the matter over from start to hypothetical finish and  back again. Meanwhile Andy Green went on with his work and scowled over  his well-earned reputation that hampered him now just when he needed the  confidence of his fellows in order to save their beloved Flying U from  slow annihilation. Perhaps his mental suffering could not rightly be  called remorse, but a poignant regret it most certainly was, and a sense  of complete bafflement which came out in his next sentence.    \"Even if she wrote me a letter, the boys'd call it a frame-up just the  same. They'd say I had it fixed before I left town. Doctor Cecil's up at  the Falls. They'd lay it to her.\"    \"I was thinking of that, myself. What's the matter with getting Chip to  go up with you? Couldn't you ring him in on the agent somehow, so he can  get the straight of it?\"    Andy stood up and looked at Weary a minute. \"How'd I make Chip believe  me enough to GO?\" he countered. \"Darn it, everything looked all smooth  sailing till I got back here to the ranch and the boys come at me with  that same old smart-aleck brand uh talk. I kinda forgot how I've lied  to 'em and fooled 'em right along till they duck every time I open my  face.\" His eyes were too full of trouble to encourage levity in his  listener. \"You remember that time the boys' rode off and left me laying  out here on the prairie with my leg broke?\" he went on dismally. \"I'd  rather have that happen to me a dozen times than see 'em set back and  give me the laugh now, just when--Oh, hell!\" He dropped the finished  cinch and walked moodily to the door. \"Weary, if them dry-farmers come  flockin' in on us while this bunch stands around callin' me a liar, I--\"  He did not attempt to finish the sentence; but Weary, staring curiously  at Andy's profile, saw a quivering of the muscles around his lips and  felt a responsive thrill of sympathy and belief that rose above his long  training in caution.    Spite of past experience he believed, at that moment, every word which  Andy Green had uttered upon the subject of the proposed immigration. He  was about to tell Andy so, when Chip walked unexpectedly out of Silver's  stall and glanced from Weary to Andy standing still in the doorway.  Weary looked at him enquiringly; for Chip must have heard every word  they said, and if Chip believed it--    \"Have you got that plat with you, Andy?\" Chip asked tersely and with  never a doubt in his tone.    Andy swung toward him like a prisoner who has just heard a jury return  a verdict of not guilty to the judge. \"I've got it,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17404"],[0,"Kinship Organisations and Group Marriage in Australia (#7)"],[1,"e, be  argued that brothers succeed as children of the same mother; but against  this must be set the fact that they are also children of the same  father; for uncertain paternity can only be a _vera causa_ where  _pirrauru_ and similar customs are found; and even here the pre-eminence  of the primary husband might well be held to determine the legal  paternity of the children, which is, of course, especially in Africa, a  matter of potestas rather than procreation. However this may be, the  position of the widow does not appear to invalidate the guardianship  origin of matriliny.    We now turn to the question of why male tends to take the place of  female descent. The possible factors are (1) authority in the family,  (2) the rise of chieftainship and inheritance generally, and (3) the  organisation of the family group. Of the authority of father or mother  over the children, there is not much trace in Australia except in the  most youthful period of the pre-adult life. It is for example  exceptional for a parent to correct a child. As to who decides in cases  of infanticide we have unfortunately too little information to be able  to generalise. Only in one important step--that of betrothal--have we  anything like adequate information, and the interrelations between rule  of descent and potestas are found to be in this case sufficiently clear,  though it is not clear on what principle it is decided _who_ shall  exercise the right.    Taking first tribes with matrilineal descent, we find that the Barkinji,  the Wakelbura, the Dieri, and in some cases the Wollaroi, assign the  right of betrothal to the mother or mother's brother[19]. In other  cases, transitional forms, the father, his elder brother, or the girl's  brothers decide, or else the parents or two of these persons  jointly[20]. Among the Mukjarawaint the betrothal rested in part with  the paternal grandparents[21]; it may be noted that the grandfather had  to decide also whether a child should be brought up or killed. Among the  Kuinmurbura it falls to the mother's brother's son or the father's  sister's son, who is, apparently, entitled to marry the girl  himself[22].    Turning now to tribes with male descent, we find that the father, his  brother, or the parents, almost invariably make the decision[23]. Among  the eight-class tribes, Spencer and Gillen assert in one place[24] that  the mother's brother betroths a girl; but this is contradicted in two  other passages[25], and cannot be regarded as reliable.    On the whole therefore it appears that while there are some survivals of  matria potestas into patrilineal descent, and in the matrilineal stage  transitional forms are found, the right of betrothal tends to pass from  the mother's to the father's side, when the rule of descent changes; but  there is little to show how far a change in the right of betrothal tends  to cause a change in the rule of descent.    A curious fact may be noted here, which goes far to demonstrate the  absolutely heterogeneous nature of kinship and consanguinity, and  suggests that descent is not reckoned in the female line on account of  any supposed specially close connection between the mother and her  offspring. Of the four tribes among which, according to Howitt, the  child is regarded as the offspring of the father alone[26], the mother  being only its nurse, two, the Yuin and Kulin, have male descent; two,  however, the Wolgal and Tatathi, have female descent, and among the  latter, in addition, the right of betrothal lies with the mother or  mother's brother.    On the whole, therefore, it may be said that no questions of potestas  seem to have exercised any influence in bringing about the transition  from matrilineal to patrilineal descent. It does not appear necessary,  therefore, to do more than allude in passing to a fact which may well  have had something to do with the decay of matria potestas, at any rate,  so far as the mother's brother is concerned, even if it did not actively  hasten the coming of patria potestas. This fact is the considerable size  of the area over which, with the rise of the so-called nations, it is  possible to select a wife. The more remote geographically the mother's  relatives, the less their influence. Allowance must of course be made  for the opportunities of discussion afforded by the great gatherings of  the tribes; but the wider area of bride-choice must have shaken the  authority of the brother.    It has been remarked above that there is no well-established case of the  right of betrothal being assigned on patrilineal principles in a  matrilineal tribe. The influence of the father's brother is not  necessarily a mark of patrilineal tendencies, except in so far as all  patria potestas is such. That the elder brother has authority in this  case is no more decisive than that the elder brother has authority in  cases of betrothal; it is no more an exemplification of the simple  patria potestas, which has already been shown to be universal and under  but slight limitations so far as the wife is concerned. From the point  of view of potestas, it is a great advance that the father should be  able to dispose of his own daughter in marriage; but if we may judge by  the survival of matria potestas into patriliny, the cases of patria  potestas under matriliny cannot have exercised an important influence in  bringing about a change in the rule of descent.    The case of the power of the girl's own brother is somewhat different.  _Prima facie_ it appears to owe its origin to the fact that it is the  brothers who are mainly interested in the transaction, inasmuch as it is  to them that wives come in exchange for the sisters given in marriage.  Consequently we cannot, as has already been the case with the so-called  levirate, assign the practice definitely either to matripotestal or  patripotestal customs, for father's and mother's authority are alike  overruled.    It has already been stated that we have but few data for estimating the  influence of the right of betrothal on the rule of descent. Clearly the  father has little to gain from the fact that his daughter follows him  rather than the mother, when the inevitable effect of the marriage  regulations is to make her children of the phratry and totem of her  husband, and consequently to make them of a different phratry and totem  from her father. Under matriliny on the other hand there is nothing to  prevent the grandchildren from being of the same totem as the  grandfather, and they are necessarily of the same class in a four-class  tribe. If considerations with regard to the phratry and totem of the  grandchildren played any part in bringing about a change in the rule of  descent, this must have been based on a review of the changes that would  be brought about in the position of the son's and not the daughter's  offspring. But this is unlikely.    But on the other hand the father's disposal of the daughter's hand is  indirectly a means of increasing his influence both with his son and in  general. If the son gains his wife by an exchange of sisters, the  father's authority is obviously increased. But we do not know how far  this factor of the right of betrothal has operated.    Turning now to questions of inheritance, we find that properly speaking  the hereditary chief is unknown in Australia. There is a tendency for  the son of the tribal headman to succeed his father, but it is subject  to exceptions. Moreover, it is by no means a universal rule for the  tribe to have an over-headman; it may be ruled by the council of  district headmen. In any case the influence of the quasi-hereditary  character of the over-headmanship upon the rule of descent cannot but  have been comparatively slight.    It is, on the other hand, usual for the local group and the totem kin to  have headmen. In the case of the latter, age is often the qualification,  as among the Dieri[27]; in such cases there is no possible effect on the  rule of succession. But among some of the Victorian tribes with  matrilineal descent the rule is for the son to follow the father in the  headmanship[28]; and the same is the case, as we should expect, among  the patrilineal eight-class tribes[29]. The most important tribe in  which hereditary headmanship is combined with female descent is the  Wiradjeri[30]; their neighbours, the Kamilaroi, showed marked respect to  the son of a headman, if he possessed ability, though they did not,  apparently, make him his father's successor[31].    On the whole, then, we cannot assign much weight to this element in the  list of possible causes of the transition.    Of inheritance of chattels or land and fixtures we know little. From  Spencer and Gillen we learn that among the Warramunga the mother's  brother, or daughter's husband, succeeds to the boomerangs, and other  moveable property[32]. Among the Kulin and the Kurnai inheritance in the  male line seems to have been the rule. In the Adelaide district, as we  learn from Gerstaecker[33], individual property in land was known; it  descended in the male line. Among the Turribul there was individual  property in _bunya-bunya_ trees; these too devolved from father to  son[34].    On the other hand on the Bloomfield property in zamia nut grounds has  vested in women and descends from mother to daughter[35]; but in this  remarkable variant we see, of course, not the influence of the mother's  kin, but female influence or rather the right of females to the produce  of their labour. In respect of other property, inheritance in North  Queensland is in the male line, for it descends to blood brothers and  remains in the same exogamous group from generation to generation.    This brings us to the question of the part played by the local group in  causing the change from female to male descent. Under ordinary  circumstances, with female descent, the local group is made up of  persons of different phratries and totems; in any case, just as"]]]
