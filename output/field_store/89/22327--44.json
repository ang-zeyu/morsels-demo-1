He had therefore only to choose which  of the two would better repay his immediate investigation.    He decided upon the northern one, which you will remember was the one  holding the tapestry; since, to find anybody there, no matter whom, would  certainly settle the identity of the person responsible for that flying  arrow. For, as all conceded, too little time had elapsed between its  delivery and the discovery of the victim for the quickest possible  attempt at escape to have carried the concealer of the bow very far from  the spot where he had thrown it. It was possible--just possible--that he  might have got as far as one of the four large rooms opening into the  corridor stretching across the front, but that he was not in the gallery  itself Mr. Gryce soon convinced himself by a rapid walk through its  entire length.    That he did not follow up this move by an immediate searching of the  rooms I have mentioned was owing to a wish he had to satisfy himself on  another point first.    What was this point?    In passing along the rear on his way to this gallery, he had noticed the  narrow staircase opening not a dozen feet away to his left. This  undoubtedly led down to the side-entrance. If by any chance the user of  the bow had fled to the rear instead of to the front, he would be found  somewhere on this staircase, for he never could have got to the bottom  before the cry of \"Close the doors! Let no man out!\" rendered this chance  of immediate exit unavailable. So Mr. Gryce retraced his steps, and  barely stopping to note the boy eying him with eager glances from the  doorway of Room A, he approached the iron balustrade guarding the small  staircase, and cautiously looked over.    A man was there! A man going down--no, coming up; and this man, as he  soon saw from his face and uniform, was Correy the attendant.    \"So that is where _you_ were,\" he called down as he beckoned the man up.    \"As near as I can remember. I was on my way in search of Mr. Jewett, for  whom I had a message, and had got as far as you saw me, when I heard a  cry of pain from somewhere in the gallery. This naturally quickened my  steps and I was up and on this floor in a jiffy.\"    \"Did you notice, as you stepped from the landing, whether the boy staring  at us from the doorway over there was facing just as we see him now?\"    \"He was. I remember his attitude perfectly.\"    \"Coming out of the door--not going in?\"    \"Sure. He was on the run. He had heard the cry too.\"    \"And followed you into the gallery?\"    \"Preceded me. He was on the scene almost as soon as the man who stepped  in from the adjoining section.\"    \"I see. And this man?\"    \"Was well within my view from the minute I entered the first arch.  He seemed more bewildered than frightened till he had passed the  communicating arch and nearly stumbled over the body of the girl shot  down almost at his elbow.\"    \"And yourself?\"    \"I knew by his look that something dreadful had happened, and when I saw  what it was, I didn't think of anything better to do than to order the  doors shut.\"    \"On your own initiative? Where was the Curator?\"    \"Not far, it seems. But he gets awfully absorbed in whatever he is doing,  and there was no time to lose. Some one had shot that arrow, some one who  might escape.\"    Mr. Gryce never allowed himself--or very rarely--to look at anyone full  and square in the face; yet he always seemed to form an instant opinion  of whomever he talked with. Perhaps he had already gauged this man and  not unfavorably, for he showed not the slightest distrust as he remarked  quite frankly:    \"You must have had some suspicion of foul play even then, to act in so  expeditious a manner.\"    \"I don't know what my suspicions were. I simply followed my first  impulse. I don't think it was a bad one. Do you, sir?\"    \"Far from it. But enough of that. Do you think\"--here he drew Correy into  the gallery out of earshot of the boy, who was watching them with all the  curiosity of his fourteen years--\"that this lad could have stolen from  where we are standing now to the door where you first saw him, during the  time you were making your rush up the stairs? Boys of his age are mighty  quick, and----\"    \"I know it, sir; and I see what you mean. But even if he had been able to  do this,--which I very much doubt,--no boy of his age could have strung  that bow, or had he found it strung, have shot an arrow from it with  force enough to kill. Only a hand accustomed to its use could handle a  bow like that with any success.\"    \"You know the bow, then? Saw it nearer than you said--possibly handled  it?\"    \"No, sir; but I know its kind and have handled many of them.\"    \"In this building?\"    \"Yes, sir, and in other museums where I have been. I have arranged and  rearranged Indian exhibits for years.\"    \"Then you think that the bow we saw behind the tapestry is an Indian  one?\"    \"Without question.\"    The detective nodded and left him. One word with the boy, and he would  feel free to go elsewhere.    It proved to be an amusing one. The boy, for all his enthusiasm as a  scout, proved to be so hungry that he was actually doleful. More than  that, he had a ticket for that afternoon's ball game in his pocket and  feared that he would not be let out in time to see it. He therefore was  quick with his answers, which certainly were ingenuous enough. He had  been looking at the model of a ship (which could be seen through an open  door), when he heard a woman cry out as if hurt, from somewhere down the  gallery. He was running to see what it meant when a man came along who  seemed in as great a hurry as himself. But he got there first--and so on  and on, corroborating Correy's story in every particular. He was so  honest (Mr. Gryce had been at great pains to trip him up in one of his  statements and had openly failed) and yet so anxious for the detective to  notice the ticket to the ball game which he held in one hand, that the  old man took pity on him and calling an officer, ordered him to let the  boy out--a concession to youth and innocence he was almost ready to  regret when a woman of uncertain years and irate mien attacked him from  the doorway he had just left, with the loud remark:    \"If you let him go, you can let me go too. I was in this room at the same  time he was and know no more about what happened over there than the  dead. I have an appointment downtown of great importance. I shall miss it  if you don't let me go at once.\"    \"Is it of greater importance than the right which this dead girl's  friends have to know by whose careless hands the arrow killing her  was shot?\" And without waiting for a reply, which was not readily  forthcoming, Mr. Gryce handed her over to Correy with an injunction to  see that she was given a comfortable seat below and proceeded to finish  up this portion of the building by a search through the three great rooms  extending along the rear.    He found them all empty and without clue of any kind, and satisfied that  his real work lay in front, he returned thither with as much expedition  as old age and rheumatism would admit. Why, in doing so, he went for the  third time through the gallery instead of through rooms J, H and I, he  did not stop to inquire, though afterward he asked that question of  himself more than once. Had he taken this latter course, he might not  have missed--    But that will come later. What we have to do now is to accompany him to  the front of the building, where matters of importance undoubtedly await  him. He had noted, in his previous passage to and fro, that the young man  who had been nearest to the tragedy was in his place before the case of  coins in Section I. This time he noted something more. The young man was  in the selfsame spot, but during this brief interval of waiting, the  passion he evidently cherished for numismatics had reasserted itself, and  he now stood with his eyes bent as eagerly upon the display of coins over  which he hung, as if no shaft of death had crossed the space without and  no young body lay in piteous quiet beyond the separating partition.    It was an exhibition of one of the most curious traits of human nature,  and Mr. Gryce would undoubtedly have expended a few cynical thoughts upon  it if, upon entering the broad front corridor which he had hitherto  avoided, he had not run upon Sweetwater pointing in a meaning way toward  two huge cases which, stacked with medieval arms, occupied one of the  corners.    \"Odd couple over there,\" he whispered as the older detective paused to  listen. \"Been watching them for the last five minutes. They pretend to be  looking at some old armor, but they are mighty uneasy and keep glancing  up at the window overhead as if they would like to jump out.\"    Mr. Gryce indulged in one of his characteristic exclamations. This was  the couple whose queer actions he had noticed on the staircase. \"I'll  have a talk with them presently. Anyone in the rooms opposite?\"    \"Yes, the Curator. He's in Room A, where there are a lot of engravings  waiting to be hung. I guess he was pretty well up to his neck in business  when that fellow Correy set up his shout. And have you noticed that he's  a bit deaf, which is the reason, perhaps, why he was not sooner on the  scene?\"    \"No, I hadn't noticed. Anyone else at this end?\"    \"Only the young couple I speak of.\"    Mr. Gryce gave them a second look. They were by many paces farther from  the pedestal from behind which the bow had been flung back of the  tapestry than would quite fit in with the theory he had formed, and by  means of which he hoped to single out the person who had sent the deadly  arrow. But then, under the stress of fear, people can move very swiftly;  and besides, what guarantee did he have that these poor, frightened  creatures had located themselves with all the honesty the occasion  demanded?

I can easily put you in fresh ones;\" but the  child paid no attention to the boat.    \"He is a wicked bad boy, Jim; and did he hurt you?\"    \"Oh, no, he didn't hurt me, Aggie, at least nothing to speak of. I hurt  him a good deal more. I paid him out well for breaking your boat, and  pushing you down, the cowardly brute!\"    \"Only look, Jim,\" she said, holding out her frock. \"What will she say?\"    James laughed.    \"Mother won't say anything,\" he said. \"She is accustomed to my coming  in all muddy.\"    \"But she said 'Keep your frock clean,' and it's not clean,\" Aggie said  in dismay.    \"Yes, but that is not your fault, little one. I will make it all right  with her, don't you fret. Come on, we had better go home and change it  as soon as possible.\"    They passed close by the two fishermen on their way.    \"You gave it to the young squire finely, Master Walsham,\" one of them  said, \"and served him right, too. We chanced to be looking at the  moment, and saw it all. He is a bad un, he is, by what they say up at  the Hall. I heard one of the grooms talking last night down at the  'Ship,' and a nice character he gave him. This thrashing may do him  some good; and look you, Master Walsham, if he makes a complaint to the  squire, and it's likely enough he will get up a fine story of how it  came about--the groom said he could lie like King Pharaoh--you just  send word to me, and me and Bill will go up to the squire, and tell him  the truth of the matter.\"    Mrs. Walsham felt somewhat alarmed when her son told her what had  happened, for the squire was a great man at Sidmouth, a magistrate, and  the owner of the greater part of the place as well as of the land  around it; and although Mrs. Walsham did not hold the same exaggerated  opinion of his powers as did the majority of his neighbours, who would  scarcely have dreamt of opposing it, had the squire ordered anyone to  be hung and quartered, still she felt that it was a somewhat terrible  thing that her son should have thrashed the nephew and heir of the  great man.    In the evening there was a knock at the door, and the little maid came  in with eyes wide open with alarm, for she had heard of the afternoon's  battle, to say that the constable wished to speak to Mrs. Walsham.    \"Servant, ma'am,\" he said as he entered. \"I am sorry to be here on an  unpleasant business; but I have got to say as the squire wishes to see  Master Walsham in the justice room at ten o'clock, on a charge of 'salt  and battery.    \"Don't you be afeard ma'am,\" he went on confidentially. \"I don't think  as anything is going to be done to him. I ain't got no warrant, and so  I don't look upon it as regular business. I expects it will be just a  blowing up. It will be just the squire, and not the magistrate, I takes  it. He told me to have him up there at ten, but as he said nothing  about custody, I thought I would do it my own way and come to you quiet  like; so if you say as Master Walsham shall be up there at ten o'clock,  I'll just take your word for it and won't come to fetch him. The doctor  was allus very good to me and my missus, and I shouldn't like to be  walking through Sidmouth with my hand on his son's collar.\"    \"Thank you, Hobson,\" Mrs. Walsham said quietly. \"You can rely upon it  my son shall be there punctually. He has nothing to be afraid or  ashamed of.\"    Full of rage as Richard Horton had been, as he started for home, he  would never have brought the matter before the squire on his own  account. His case was too weak, and he had been thrashed by a boy  younger than himself. Thus, he would have probably chosen some other  way of taking his vengeance; but it happened that, just as he arrived  home, he met his tutor coming out. The latter was astounded at  Richard's appearance. His eyes were already puffed so much that he  could scarcely see out of them, his lips were cut and swollen, his  shirt stained with blood, his clothes drenched and plastered with red  mud.    \"Why, what on earth has happened, Richard?\"    Richard had already determined upon his version of the story.    \"A brute of a boy knocked me down into the water,\" he said, \"and then  knocked me about till he almost killed me.\"    \"But what made him assault you in this outrageous manner?\" his tutor  asked. \"Surely all the boys about here must know you by sight; and how  one of them would dare to strike you I cannot conceive.\"    \"I know the fellow,\" Richard said angrily. \"He is the son of that  doctor fellow who died two years ago.\"    \"But what made him do it?\" the tutor repeated.    \"He was sailing his boat, and it got stuck, and he threw in some stones  to get it off; and I helped him, and I happened to hit the mast of his  beastly boat, and then he flew at me like a tiger, and that's all.\"    \"Well, it seems to be a monstrous assault, Richard, and you must speak  to the squire about it.\"    \"Oh, no, I sha'n't,\" Richard said hastily. \"I don't want any row about  it, and I will pay him off some other way. I could lick him easy enough  if it had been a fair fight, only he knocked me down before I was on my  guard. No, I sha'n't say anything about it.\"    But Richard's tutor, on thinking the matter over, determined to speak  to the squire. Only the evening before, Mr. Linthorne had surprised him  by asking him several questions as to Richard's progress and conduct,  and had said something about examining him himself, to see how he was  getting on. This had caused Mr. Robertson no little alarm, for he knew  that even the most superficial questioning would betray the extent of  Richard's ignorance, and he had resolved that, henceforth, he would  endeavour to assert his authority, and to insist upon Richard's  devoting a certain portion of each day, regularly, to study. Should the  squire meet the boy anywhere about the house, he must at once notice  the condition of his face; and even if he did not meet him, he could  not fail to notice it on Sunday, when he sat beside him in the pew. It  would be better, therefore, that he should at once report the matter to  him.    Without saying a word to Richard of his intentions, he therefore went  to the squire's study, and told him what had taken place, as he had  learned it from Richard. The squire listened silently.    \"Very well, Mr. Robertson. You were quite right to tell me about it. Of  course, I cannot suffer my nephew to be treated in this manner. At the  same time, I am sorry that it was Walsham's son. I don't know anything  about the boy, and should not know him even by sight, but I had an  esteem for his father, who was a hard-working man, and, I believe,  clever. He used to attend here whenever any of the servants were ill,  and I had intended to do something for the boy. I am sorry he has  turned out so badly. However, I will have him up here and speak to him.  This sort of thing cannot be permitted.\"    And accordingly, orders were given to the constable. When, in the  evening, Mr. Robertson informed Richard what he had done, the boy flew  into a terrible passion, and abused his tutor with a violence of  language which shocked and astonished him, and opened his eyes to his  own culpability, in allowing him to go on his way unchecked. He in vain  endeavoured to silence the furious lad. He had been so long without  exercising any authority, that he had now no authority to exercise,  and, after an angry scene, Richard flung himself out of the room, and  left his tutor in a state bordering on consternation.        Chapter 3: The Justice Room.      Richard's feelings were not to be envied, as he lay awake that night,  thinking over what had taken place in the morning. It had never, for a  moment, entered his mind that his tutor would repeat his statement to  the squire, and he would have given a good deal if he had not made it.  However, there was nothing for him now but to stick to the story, and  he felt but little doubt of the result. He had no idea that any, but  the actors in it, had witnessed the scene by the pool, and he felt  confident that his uncle would, as a matter of course, take his word in  preference to that of this boy, who would naturally tell lies to screen  himself. Of course, the child was there, but no one would mind what a  baby like that said. Still, it was a nuisance, and he gnashed his teeth  with rage at the interference of his tutor in the matter.    \"I will get rid of him, somehow, before long,\" he said. \"I will pay him  out for his meddling, as sure as my name's Richard Horton. I will get  him out of this before three months are gone.\"    The next morning at breakfast, Richard received a message from the  squire that he was to be present at ten o'clock in the justice room,  and accordingly, at that hour he presented himself there with a  confident air, but with an inward feeling of misgiving.    The squire was sitting at his table, with his clerk beside him. Mr.  Robertson was in a chair a short distance off. The constable was  standing by the side of James Walsham, at the other end of the room.  Mr. Linthorne nodded to his nephew.    \"I wish you to repeat the story which you told Mr. Robertson  yesterday.\"    Richard had thought over whether it would be better to soften his  story, but as it had already been told to the squire, he had concluded  that there would be more danger in contradicting his first version than  in sticking to it. Accordingly, he repeated his story almost word for  word as he had told it to Mr. Robertson.    \"What have you to say to this, James Walsham?\" the squire asked. \"This  is a serious charge, that you without any provocation assaulted and  maltreated my nephew.\"    \"I say it is all a lie, sir,\" James said fearlessly.    The squire uttered a short exclamation of surprise and anger. He had  been, at first, favourably impressed with the appearance of the young  prisoner, though he had been surprised at"]]]
