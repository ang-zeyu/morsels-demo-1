By adding silent _e_ to the above words we  have _note, pine, here, ripe, ride, mete_.  In each of these cases the  _e_ follows the consonant, though really combining with the vowel before  the consonant; but if we place the additional _e_ just after the first  _e_ in _met_ we have _meet,_ which is a word even more common than  _mete.  E_ is the only vowel that may be placed after the consonant and  still combine with the vowel before it {while being silent}; but nearly  all the other vowels may be placed beside the vowel that would otherwise  be short in order to make it long, and sometimes this added vowel is  placed before as well as after the vowel to be lengthened.  Thus we have  _boat, bait, beat, field, chief,_ etc.  There are a very, very few  irregular words in which the vowel sound has been kept short in spite  of the added vowel, as for instance, _head, sieve,_ etc.  It appears  that with certain consonants the long sound is especially difficult,  and so in the case of very common words the wear of common speech has  shortened the vowels in spite of original efforts to strengthen them.  This is peculiarly true of the consonant _v,_ and the combination _th,_  and less so of _s_ and _z_.  So in {(I)}_live, have, give, love, shove,  move,_ etc., the vowel sound is more or less obscured even in spite of  the silent _e,_ though in the less common words _alive, behave,_ etc.,  the long sound strengthened by accent has not been lost.  So as a rule  two silent vowels are now used to make the vowel before the _v_ long,  as in _leave, believe, receive, beeves, weave,_ etc.  In the single word  _sieve_ the vowel remains short in spite of two silent vowels added to  strengthen it.  Two vowels are also sometimes required to strengthen a  long vowel before _th,_ as in _breathe,_ though when the vowel itself  is a strong one, as _a_ in _bathe,_ the second vowel is not required,  and _o_ in _both_ is so easily increased in sound that the two  consonants alone are sufficient.  It will be seen, therefore, that much  depends on the quality of the vowel.  _A_ and _o_ are the strongest  vowels, _i_ the weakest (which accounts for sieve).  After _s_ and _z_  we must also have a silent _e_ in addition to the silent vowel with  which the sounded vowel is combined, as we may see in _cheese, increase,  freeze,_ etc.  The added vowel in combination with the long vowel is not  always needed, however, as we may see in contrasting _raise_ and _rise_.    Not only vowels but consonants may serve to lengthen vowel sounds, as  we see in _right, night, bright,_ and in _scold, roll,_ etc.  Only _o_  is capable of being lengthened by two simple consonants such as we have  in _scold_ and _roll_.  In _calm_ and _ball,_ for instance, the _a_ has  one of its extra values rather than its long sound.  The _gh_ is of  course a powerful combination.  Once it was pronounced; but it became so  difficult that we have learned to give its value by dwelling a little on  the vowel sound.    Another powerful means of lengthening a vowel is accent.  When a vowel  receives the full force of the accent by coming at the end of an accented  syllable it is almost invariably made long.  We see this in monosyllables  such as _he, no,_ etc.  It is often necessary to strengthen by an  additional silent vowel, however, as in _tie, sue, view,_ etc., and _a_ has  a peculiarity in that when it comes at the end of a syllable alone it has  the sound of _ah,_ or _a_ Italian, rather than that of _a_ long, and we  have _pa, ma,_ etc., and for the long sound _y_ is added, as in _say, day,  ray.  I_ has a great disinclination to appear at the end of a word, and so  is n usually changed to _y_ when such a position is necessary, or it takes  silent _e_ as indicated above; while this service on the part of _y_ is  reciprocated by _i_'s taking the place of _y_ inside a word, as may be  illustrated by _city_ and _cities_.    When a vowel gets the _full force_ of the accent in a word of two or  more syllables it is bound to be long, as for instance the first _a_ in  _ma'di a_.  Even the stress necessary to keep the vowel from running  into the next syllable will make it long, though the sound is somewhat  obscured, some other syllable receiving the chief accent, as the first  _a_ in _ma gi'cian_.  In this last word _i_ seems to have the full  force of the accent, yet it is not long; and we note the same in such  words as _condi'tion,_ etc.  The fact is, however, that _i_ being a  weak vowel easily runs into the consonant sound of the next syllable,  and if we note the sounds as we pronounce _condition_ we shall see that  the _sh_ sound represented by _ti_ blends with the _i_ and takes the  force of the accent.  We cannot separate the _ti_ or _ci_ from the  following portion of the syllable, since if so separated they could not  have their _sh_ value; but in pronunciation this separation is made in  part and the _sh_ sound serves both for the syllable that precedes and  the syllable that follows.  In a word like _di men'sion_ we find the _i_  of the first syllable long even without the accent, since the accent on  _men_ attaches the _m_ so closely to it that it cannot in any way  relieve the _i_.  So we see that in an accented syllable the consonant  before a short vowel, as well as the consonant following it, receives  part of the stress.  This is especially noticeable in the word _ma  gi'cian_ as compared with _mag'ic_.  In magic the syllable _ic_ is in  itself so complete that the _g_ is kept with the _a_ and takes the force  of the accent, leaving the _a_ short.  In _magician_ the _g_ is drawn  away from the _a_ to help out the short _i_ followed by an _sh_ sound,  and the _a_ is lengthened even to altering the form of the simple word.  In the word _ma'gi an,_ again, we find _a_ long, the _g_ being needed to  help out the _i_.    Since accent makes a vowel long if no consonant intervenes at the end  of a syllable, and as a single consonant following such a vowel in a  word of two syllables (though not in words of three or more) is likely  to be drawn into the syllable following, a single consonant following  a single short vowel must be doubled.  If two or more consonants follow  the vowel, as in _masking, standing, wilting,_ the vowel even in an  accented syllable remains short.  But in _pining_ with one _n_ following  the _i_ in the accented syllable, we know that the vowel must be long,  for if it were short the word would be written _pinning_.    Universal Rule: _Monosyllables_ in which, a single vowel is followed by  a single consonant (except _v_ and _h_ never doubled) _double the final  consonant_ when a single syllable beginning with a vowel is added,  and _all words_ so ending double the final consonant on the addition of  a syllable beginning with a vowel _if the syllable containing the single  vowel_ followed by a single consonant _is to be accented_.    Thus we have _can---canning, run---running, fun---funny, flat---flattish_;  and also _sin---sinned_ (for the _ed_ is counted a syllable though not  pronounced as such nowadays); _preferred,_ but _preference,_ since the  accent is thrown back from the syllable containing the single vowel  followed by a single consonant in the word _preference,_ though not in  _preferred_; and of course the vowel is not doubled in _murmured, wondered,  covered,_ etc.    If, however, the accented syllable is followed by two or more syllables,  the tendency of accent is to shorten the vowel.  Thus we have  _grammat'ical,_ etc., in which the short vowel in the accented syllable  is followed by a single consonant not doubled.  The word _na'tion_ (with  a long a) becomes _na'tional_ (short _a_) when the addition of a syllable  throws the accent on to the antepenult.  The vowel _u_ is never shortened  in this way, however, and we have _lu'bricate,_ not _lub'ricate_.  We also find such words as _no'tional_ (long _o_).  While accented  syllables which are followed by two or more syllables seldom if ever double  the single consonant, in pronunciation we often find the vowel long if the  two syllables following contain short and weak vowels.  Thus we have  _pe'riod_ (long _e_), _ma'niac_ (long _a_), and _o'rient'al_ (long _o_).    In words of two syllables and other words in which the accent comes on  the next to the last syllable, a short vowel in an accented syllable  should logically always be followed by more than one consonant or a  double consonant.  We find the double consonant in such words as  _summer, pretty, mammal,_ etc.  Unfortunately, our second law, which  requires all derived words to preserve the form of the original root,  interferes with this principle very seriously in a large number  of English words.  The roots are often derived from languages in  which this principle did not apply, or else these roots originally  had very different sound values from those they have with us.  So we have _body,_ with one _d,_ though we have _shoddy_ and _toddy_  regularly formed with two _d_'s, and we have _finish, exhibit,_ etc.;  in _col'onnade_ the _n_ is doubled in a syllable that is not accented.    The chief exception to the general principle is the entire class of  words ending in _ic,_ such as _colic, cynic, civic, antithetic,  peripatetic,_ etc.  If the root is long, however, it will remain long  after the addition of the termination _ic,_ as _music_ (from _muse_),  _basic_ (from _base_), etc.    But in the case of words which we form ourselves, we will find practically  no exceptions to the rule that a short vowel in a syllable _next_ to the  last _must_ be followed by a _double consonant_ when accented, while a  short vowel in a syllable _before_ the next to the last is _not_ followed  by a double consonant "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19721"],[0,"The Literary World Seventh Reader (#7)"],[1,"behold the likeness of the  Great Stone Face.    The cavalcade came prancing along the road, with a great clattering of  hoofs and a mighty cloud of dust, which rose up so dense and high that  the visage of the mountain side was completely hidden from Ernest's  eyes. All the great men of the neighborhood were there on horseback:  militia officers, in uniform; the member of congress; the sheriff of the  county; the editors of newspapers; and many a farmer, too, had mounted  his patient steed, with his Sunday coat upon his back. It really was a  very brilliant spectacle, especially as there were numerous banners  flaunting over the cavalcade, on some of which were gorgeous portraits  of the illustrious statesman and the Great Stone Face, smiling  familiarly at one another, like two brothers. If the pictures were to be  trusted, the resemblance, it must be confessed, was marvelous. We must  not forget to mention that there was a band of music, which made the  echoes of the mountains ring with the loud triumph of its strains, so  that airy and soul-thrilling melodies broke out among all the heights  and hollows, as if every nook of his native valley had found a voice to  welcome the distinguished guest. But the grandest effect was when the  far-off mountain precipice flung back the music; for then the Great  Stone Face itself seemed to be swelling the triumphant chorus, in  acknowledgment that, at length, the man of prophecy was come.    All this while the people were throwing up their hats and shouting with  such enthusiasm that the heart of Ernest kindled up, and he likewise  threw up his hat and shouted as loudly as the loudest, \"Huzza for the  great man! Huzza for Old Stony Phiz!\" But as yet he had not seen him.    \"Here he is now!\" cried those who stood near Ernest. \"There! There! Look  at Old Stony Phiz and then at the Old Man of the Mountain, and see if  they are not as like as two twin brothers!\"    In the midst of all this gallant array came an open [v]barouche, drawn  by four white horses; and in the barouche, with his massive head  uncovered, sat the illustrious statesman, Old Stony Phiz himself.    \"Confess it,\" said one of Ernest's neighbors to him, \"the Great Stone  Face has met its match at last!\"    Now, it must be owned that, at his first glimpse of the countenance  which was bowing and smiling from the barouche, Ernest did fancy that  there was a resemblance between it and the old familiar face upon the  mountain side. The brow, with its massive depth and loftiness, and all  the other features, indeed, were bold and strong. But the grand  expression of a divine sympathy that illuminated the mountain visage  might here be sought in vain.    Still Ernest's neighbor was thrusting his elbow into his side, and  pressing him for an answer.    \"Confess! Confess! Is not he the very picture of your Old Man of the  Mountain?\"    \"No!\" said Ernest, bluntly; \"I see little or no likeness.\"    \"Then so much the worse for the Great Stone Face!\" answered his  neighbor. And again he set up a shout for Old Stony Phiz.    But Ernest turned away, melancholy, and almost despondent; for this was  the saddest of his disappointments, to behold a man who might have  fulfilled the prophecy, and had not willed to do so. Meantime, the  cavalcade, the banners, the music, and the barouches swept past him,  with the shouting crowd in the rear, leaving the dust to settle down,  and the Great Stone Face to be revealed again, with the grandeur that it  had worn for untold centuries.    \"Lo, here I am, Ernest!\" the benign lips seemed to say. \"I have waited  longer than thou, and am not yet weary. Fear not; the man will come.\"      V    The years hurried onward, treading in their haste on one another's  heels. And now they began to bring white hairs and scatter them over the  head of Ernest; they made wrinkles across his forehead and furrows in  his cheeks. He was an aged man. But not in vain had he grown old; more  than the white hairs on his head were the wise thoughts in his mind. And  Ernest had ceased to be obscure. Unsought for, undesired, had come the  fame which so many seek, and made him known in the great world, beyond  the limits of the valley in which he had dwelt so quietly. College  professors, and even the active men of cities, came from far to see and  converse with Ernest; for the report had gone abroad that this simple  farmer had ideas unlike those of other men, and a tranquil majesty as if  he had been talking with the angels as his daily friends. Ernest  received these visitors with the gentle sincerity that had marked him  from boyhood, and spoke freely with them of whatever came uppermost, or  lay deepest in his heart or their own. While they talked together his  face would kindle and shine upon them, as with a mild evening light.  When his guests took leave and went their way, and passing up the  valley, paused to look at the Great Stone Face, they imagined that they  had seen its likeness in a human countenance, but could not remember  where.    While Ernest had been growing up and growing old, a bountiful Providence  had granted a new poet to this earth. He, likewise, was a native of the  valley, but had spent the greater part of his life at a distance from  that romantic region, pouring out his sweet music amid the bustle and  din of cities. Often, however, did the mountains which had been familiar  to him in his childhood lift their snowy peaks into the clear atmosphere  of his poetry. Neither was the Great Stone Face forgotten, for he had  celebrated it in a poem which was grand enough to have been uttered by  its lips.    The songs of this poet found their way to Ernest. He read them after his  customary toil, seated on the bench before his cottage door, where for  such a length of time he had filled his repose with thought, by gazing  at the Great Stone Face. And now, as he read stanzas that caused the  soul to thrill within him, he lifted his eyes to the vast countenance  beaming on him so benignantly.    \"O majestic friend,\" he said, addressing the Great Stone Face, \"is not  this man worthy to resemble thee?\"    The Face seemed to smile, but answered not a word.    Now it happened that the poet, though he dwelt so far away, had not only  heard of Ernest, but had meditated much upon his character, until he  deemed nothing so desirable as to meet this man whose untaught wisdom  walked hand in hand with the noble simplicity of his life. One summer  morning, therefore, he took passage by the railroad, and, in the decline  of the afternoon, alighted from the cars at no great distance from  Ernest's cottage. The great hotel, which had formerly been the palace of  Mr. Gathergold, was close at hand, but the poet, with his carpetbag on  his arm, inquired at once where Ernest dwelt, and was resolved to be  accepted as his guest.    Approaching the door, he there found the good old man, holding a volume  in his hand, which he read, and then, with a finger between the leaves,  looked lovingly at the Great Stone Face.    \"Good evening,\" said the poet. \"Can you give a traveler a night's  lodging?\"    \"Willingly,\" answered Ernest. And then he added, smiling, \"Methinks I  never saw the Great Stone Face look so hospitably at a stranger.\"    The poet sat down on the bench beside him, and he and Ernest talked  together. Often had the poet conversed with the wittiest and the wisest,  but never before with a man like Ernest, whose thoughts and feelings  gushed up with such a natural freedom, and who made great truths so  familiar by his simple utterance of them. Angels, as had been so often  said, seemed to have wrought with him at his labor in the fields; angels  seemed to have sat with him by the fireside. So thought the poet. And  Ernest, on the other hand, was moved by the living images which the poet  flung out of his mind, and which peopled all the air about the cottage  door with shapes of beauty.    As Ernest listened to the poet, he imagined that the Great Stone Face  was bending forward to listen, too. He gazed earnestly into the poet's  glowing eyes.    \"Who are you, my strangely gifted guest!\" he said.    The poet laid his finger on the volume that Ernest had been reading.    \"You have read these poems,\" said he. \"You know me, then,--for I wrote  them.\"    Again, and still more earnestly than before, Ernest examined the poet's  features; then turned toward the Great Stone Face; then back to his  guest. But his countenance fell; he shook his head, and mournfully  sighed.    \"Wherefore are you sad?\" inquired the poet.    \"Because,\" replied Ernest, \"all through life I have awaited the  fulfillment of a prophecy; and when I read these poems, I hoped that it  might be fulfilled in you.\"    \"You hoped,\" answered the poet, faintly smiling, \"to find in me the  likeness of the Great Stone Face. And you are disappointed, as formerly  with Mr. Gathergold, and Old Blood-and-Thunder, and Old Stony Phiz. Yes,  Ernest, it is my doom. You must add my name to the illustrious three,  and record another failure of your hopes. For--in shame and sadness do I  speak it, Ernest--I am not worthy.\"    \"And why?\" asked Ernest. He pointed to the volume. \"Are not those  thoughts divine?\"    \"You can hear in them the far-off echo of a heavenly song,\" replied the  poet. \"But my life, dear Ernest, has not corresponded with my thought. I  have had grand dreams, but they have been only dreams, because I have  lived--and that, too, by my own choice--among poor and mean realities.  Sometimes even--shall I dare to say it?--I lack faith in the grandeur,  the beauty, and the goodness which my own works are said to have made  more evident in nature and in human life. Why, then, pure seeker of the  good and true, shouldst thou hope to find me in yonder image of the  divine?\"    The poet spoke sadly, and his eyes were dim with tears. So, likewise,  were those of Ernest.    At the hour of sunset, as had long been his frequent custom, Ernest was "]]]
