But all desire delight; both wise and foolish, and  even irrational creatures. Therefore delight is the best of all.  Therefore happiness, which is the supreme good, consists in pleasure.    _On the contrary,_ Boethius says (De Consol. iii): \"Any one that  chooses to look back on his past excesses, will perceive that  pleasures had a sad ending: and if they can render a man happy, there  is no reason why we should not say that the very beasts are happy  too.\"    _I answer that,_ Because bodily delights are more generally known,  \"the name of pleasure has been appropriated to them\" (Ethic. vii,  13), although other delights excel them: and yet happiness does not  consist in them. Because in every thing, that which pertains to its  essence is distinct from its proper accident: thus in man it is one  thing that he is a mortal rational animal, and another that he is a  risible animal. We must therefore consider that every delight is a  proper accident resulting from happiness, or from some part of  happiness; since the reason that a man is delighted is that he has  some fitting good, either in reality, or in hope, or at least in  memory. Now a fitting good, if indeed it be the perfect good, is  precisely man's happiness: and if it is imperfect, it is a share of  happiness, either proximate, or remote, or at least apparent.  Therefore it is evident that neither is delight, which results from  the perfect good, the very essence of happiness, but something  resulting therefrom as its proper accident.    But bodily pleasure cannot result from the perfect good even in that  way. For it results from a good apprehended by sense, which is a power  of the soul, which power makes use of the body. Now good pertaining to  the body, and apprehended by sense, cannot be man's perfect good. For  since the rational soul excels the capacity of corporeal matter, that  part of the soul which is independent of a corporeal organ, has a  certain infinity in regard to the body and those parts of the soul  which are tied down to the body: just as immaterial things are in a  way infinite as compared to material things, since a form is, after a  fashion, contracted and bounded by matter, so that a form which is  independent of matter is, in a way, infinite. Therefore sense, which  is a power of the body, knows the singular, which is determinate  through matter: whereas the intellect, which is a power independent of  matter, knows the universal, which is abstracted from matter, and  contains an infinite number of singulars. Consequently it is evident  that good which is fitting to the body, and which causes bodily  delight through being apprehended by sense, is not man's perfect good,  but is quite a trifle as compared with the good of the soul. Hence it  is written (Wis. 7:9) that \"all gold in comparison of her, is as a  little sand.\" And therefore bodily pleasure is neither happiness  itself, nor a proper accident of happiness.    Reply Obj. 1: It comes to the same whether we desire good, or desire  delight, which is nothing else than the appetite's rest in good: thus  it is owing to the same natural force that a weighty body is borne  downwards and that it rests there. Consequently just as good is  desired for itself, so delight is desired for itself and not for  anything else, if the preposition \"for\" denote the final cause. But  if it denote the formal or rather the motive cause, thus delight is  desirable for something else, i.e. for the good, which is the object  of that delight, and consequently is its principle, and gives it its  form: for the reason that delight is desired is that it is rest in  the thing desired.    Reply Obj. 2: The vehemence of desire for sensible delight arises  from the fact that operations of the senses, through being the  principles of our knowledge, are more perceptible. And so it is that  sensible pleasures are desired by the majority.    Reply Obj. 3: All desire delight in the same way as they desire good:  and yet they desire delight by reason of the good and not conversely,  as stated above (ad 1). Consequently it does not follow that delight  is the supreme and essential good, but that every delight results  from some good, and that some delight results from that which is the  essential and supreme good.  ________________________    SEVENTH ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 2, Art. 7]    Whether Some Good of the Soul Constitutes Man's Happiness?    Objection 1: It would seem that some good of the soul constitutes  man's happiness. For happiness is man's good. Now this is threefold:  external goods, goods of the body, and goods of the soul. But  happiness does not consist in external goods, nor in goods of the  body, as shown above (AA. 4, 5). Therefore it consists in goods  of the soul.    Obj. 2: Further, we love that for which we desire good, more than  the good that we desire for it: thus we love a friend for whom we  desire money, more than we love money. But whatever good a man  desires, he desires it for himself. Therefore he loves himself more  than all other goods. Now happiness is what is loved above all: which  is evident from the fact that for its sake all else is loved and  desired. Therefore happiness consists in some good of man himself:  not, however, in goods of the body; therefore, in goods of the soul.    Obj. 3: Further, perfection is something belonging to that which is  perfected. But happiness is a perfection of man. Therefore happiness  is something belonging to man. But it is not something belonging to  the body, as shown above (A. 5). Therefore it is something belonging  to the soul; and thus it consists in goods of the soul.    _On the contrary,_ As Augustine says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 22), \"that  which constitutes the life of happiness is to be loved for its own  sake.\" But man is not to be loved for his own sake, but whatever is  in man is to be loved for God's sake. Therefore happiness consists in  no good of the soul.    _I answer that,_ As stated above (Q. 1, A. 8), the end is twofold:  namely, the thing itself, which we desire to attain, and the use,  namely, the attainment or possession of that thing. If, then, we speak  of man's last end, it is impossible for man's last end to be the soul  itself or something belonging to it. Because the soul, considered in  itself, is as something existing in potentiality: for it becomes  knowing actually, from being potentially knowing; and actually  virtuous, from being potentially virtuous. Now since potentiality is  for the sake of act as for its fulfilment, that which in itself is in  potentiality cannot be the last end. Therefore the soul itself cannot  be its own last end.    In like manner neither can anything belonging to it, whether power,  habit, or act. For that good which is the last end, is the perfect  good fulfilling the desire. Now man's appetite, otherwise the will,  is for the universal good. And any good inherent to the soul is a  participated good, and consequently a portioned good. Therefore none  of them can be man's last end.    But if we speak of man's last end, as to the attainment or possession  thereof, or as to any use whatever of the thing itself desired as an  end, thus does something of man, in respect of his soul, belong to his  last end: since man attains happiness through his soul. Therefore the  thing itself which is desired as end, is that which constitutes  happiness, and makes man happy; but the attainment of this thing is  called happiness. Consequently we must say that happiness is something  belonging to the soul; but that which constitutes happiness is  something outside the soul.    Reply Obj. 1: Inasmuch as this division includes all goods that man  can desire, thus the good of the soul is not only power, habit, or  act, but also the object of these, which is something outside. And in  this way nothing hinders us from saying that what constitutes  happiness is a good of the soul.    Reply Obj. 2: As far as the proposed objection is concerned,  happiness is loved above all, as the good desired; whereas a friend  is loved as that for which good is desired; and thus, too, man loves  himself. Consequently it is not the same kind of love in both cases.  As to whether man loves anything more than himself with the love of  friendship there will be occasion to inquire when we treat of Charity.    Reply Obj. 3: Happiness, itself, since it is a perfection of the  soul, is an inherent good of the soul; but that which constitutes  happiness, viz. which makes man happy, is something outside his soul,  as stated above.  ________________________    EIGHTH ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 2, Art. 8]    Whether Any Created Good Constitutes Man's Happiness?    Objection 1: It would seem that some created good constitutes man's  happiness. For Dionysius says (Div. Nom. vii) that Divine wisdom  \"unites the ends of first things to the beginnings of second things,\"  from which we may gather that the summit of a lower nature touches  the base of the higher nature. But man's highest good is happiness.  Since then the angel is above man in the order of nature, as stated  in the First Part (Q. 111, A. 1), it seems that man's happiness  consists in man somehow reaching the angel.    Obj. 2: Further, the last end of each thing is that which, in  relation to it, is perfect: hence the part is for the whole, as for  its end. But the universe of creatures which is called the macrocosm,  is compared to man who is called the microcosm (Phys. viii, 2), as  perfect to imperfect. Therefore man's happiness consists in the whole  universe of creatures.    Obj. 3: Further, man is made happy by that which lulls his natural  desire. But man's natural desire does not reach out to a good  surpassing his capacity. Since then man's capacity does not include  that good which surpasses the limits of all creation, it seems that  man can be made happy by some created good. Consequently some created  good constitutes man's happiness.    _On "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17910"],[0,"The Mafulu: Mountain People of British New Guinea (#7)"],[1,"at, from the point of view of covering,  the bands might be dispensed with altogether. This remark applies  still more strongly to the case of young boys and unmarried girls,  including among the latter big full-grown girls, who are in fact  fully developed women, whose bands can hardly be regarded as being  more than nominal, and who, especially the girls and young women,  and even sometimes married women who are nursing their babies, can  really only be described as being practically naked.    Plate 13 (Figs, 1, 2, and 3) illustrates the staining and decoration  of perineal bands. [33] Fig. 1 is a section of a man's band about  6 inches wide. The transverse lines, which extend along the whole  length of the band, are in alternate groups of black and red. The  background is unevenly stained yellow behind the black lines; but the  background behind the red lines and the spaces intervening between the  groups of lines are unstained. Fig. 2 is the pattern near the end of  a woman's band about 5 inches wide. The lines are coloured red. There  is no pattern on the rest of the band; but the whole of the band,  including the background of the pattern, is stained yellow. Fig. 3 is  a section of a woman's band about 2 1/2 inches wide. The colouring  is in alternate bands of red and yellow with irregular unstained  spaces between.    I was struck with the gradual reduction of the women's dress as I  travelled from the coast, with its Roro inhabitants, through Mekeo,  and thence by Lapeka and Ido-ido to Dilava, and on by Deva-deva to  Mafulu. The petticoats of the Roro women gave way to the shorter  ones of Mekeo, and these seemed to get shorter as I went further  inland. Then at Lapeka they were still shorter. At Ido-ido, which  is Kuni, the petticoats ceased, and there was only the perineal  band. Then, again, at Dilava (still Kuni) this band was narrower,  and at Deva-deva, and finally at Mafulu, it was often, as I have said,  almost nominal.    I was told that the age at which a boy usually begins to wear his  band is about 10 or 12, or in the case of a chief's son 16 or 17;  but that girls assume their bands at a somewhat earlier age, say at  7 or 8. So far as my personal observation went I should have thought  that the usual maximum age of nakedness for both boys and girls was  rather younger, and I never saw a naked boy of an age anything like 16.    The assumption of the perineal band is the subject of a ceremony  which will be dealt with hereafter.    Caps are very often worn by men, but not by women or children. These  are simply pieces of plain unstained bark cloth about 9 inches wide,  which are coiled and twisted on the head. The result is often a  shapeless mass; but there are methods of arranging the cloth in  definite ways which produce describable results. Sometimes the cloth  is merely coiled several times around the head, so as to produce  a tall thin turban-shaped band, the crown of the head being left  uncovered. Often this plan is extended by turning the end of the  cloth over, so as to cover the top of the head, thus producing in  some cases a result which resembles a fez, and in other cases one  which looks more like a tight skullcap. Again the cap often has its  centre terminating in an end or tassel hanging over, thus making it  look like a cap of liberty; and yet again I have seen the cap look  almost like the square paper caps often worn by certain artisans at  home. These caps are seen in several of the plates.    Abdominal belts are commonly worn by both men and women, but not as  a rule by children. There are several distinct forms of these:--    (1) A thick strong dark-coloured belt (Plate 14, Fig. I) made of tree  bark; made and worn by men only. The belt is about 3 or more inches  wide and is often so long that it passes twice round the body, the  outer end being fastened to the coil beneath it by two strings. This  form of belt is sometimes ornamented with simple straight-lined  geometric patterns carved into the belt, but it is never coloured. The  process of manufacture is as follows: they cut off a strip of bark  large enough for one, two, three, or four belts, and coil it up in  concentric circles, like the two circles of the belt when worn. They  then place it so coiled into water, and leave it there to soak for  a few days, after which they strip off the outer part, leaving the  smooth inner bark, which they dry, and finally cut into the required  lengths, to which they add the attachment strings made of native fibre.    (2) A belt made of a material looking like split cane and thin strips  from the fibre of what I was told was a creeping plant [34]; made  and worn by men only. The latter material is obtained by splitting  the fibre into thin strips. These strips and the strips of split  cane-like material are rather coarse in texture. The former are of  a dull red-brown colour (natural, not produced by staining) and the  latter are stone-yellow. The two are plaited together in geometric  patterns. The width of the belt is about 2 inches. It only passes once  round the man's body; and the plaiting is finished with the belt on  the body, so that it can only afterwards be removed by unplaiting or  cutting it off.    (3) A belt (Plate 14, Fig. 2) made of stone-yellow unsplit cane;  made and worn by both men and women. This is the simplest form of  belt, being merely a strip of cane intertwined (not plaited) so as  to form a band about half an inch wide, and left the natural colour  of the cane. Both men and women, when short of food, use this belt  to reduce the pain of hunger, by tightening it over the stomach. It  is, therefore, much worn during a period of restricted diet prior to  a feast. Women also use it, along with their other ordinary means,  to bring about abortion, the belt being for this purpose drawn very  tightly round the body. Often two, or even three, such belts are  worn together.    (4) A belt (Plate 14, Fig. 3) made of coarse, sometimes very coarse,  stone-yellow split cane or cane-like material; made and worn by men  only. This belt is left the natural colour of the material, which is  plaited so as to form a band from half an inch to 2 inches broad, the  two ends of which are bound together with cane. It also, like No. 2,  is finished on the body. A man will often wear two or three of these  belts together.    (5) A belt (Plate 15, Fig. i) made out of the inner fibre of a creeping  plant [35]; made and worn by men only. The fibre threads used for  this belt are very fine, so the plaiting is minute, instead of being  coarse like that of No. 2; but it is generally done rather loosely  and openly. The belt is usually about 2 inches wide or a trifle less  and is often plaited in slightly varying geometric patterns. It is  not stained in manufacture, but the natural stone-grey colour of the  fibre soon becomes tinted as the result of wear and the staining of  the wearer's body, and in particular it often becomes an ornamental  red. This belt also is finished on the man's body.    (6) A belt (Plate 15, Fig. 2) made of the inner fibre of what I was  told was another creeping plant [36] and the stem of a plant which  I believe to be one of the Dendrobiums [37]; made and worn by men  only. The fibres of the former plant are stained black; the reedy stems  of the other plant are put in short bamboo stems filled with water,  and then boiled. They are then easily split up into flattish straws,  and become a colour varying from rather bright yellow to brown. For  making the belt these two materials, looking rather like black and  bright yellow straw, are plaited together in various geometrical  patterns. The width of the belt is 2 inches, or a trifle more. It is  tied at the ends with fibre string.    (7) A rather special form of belt (Plate 15, Fig. 3) used mainly for  visiting and dancing; made and worn by both men and women. The belt is  made out of a hank of loose separate strands between 4 and 5 feet long,  tied together with string or bark cloth at two opposite points, so as  to form a belt of between 2 feet and 2 feet 6 inches in length. For  better description I would liken it to a skein of wool, as it looks  when held on the hands of one person for the purpose of being wound  off into a ball by someone else, but which, instead of being wound  off, is tied up at the two points where it passes round the hands of  the holder, and is then pulled out into a straight line of double the  original number of strands, and so forms a single many-stranded belt  of 2 feet or more in length. It is fastened round the waist with a  piece of bark cloth attached to one of the points where the hank has  been tied up. [38]    The number of strands is considerable. Belts examined by me and counted  gave numbers varying from eighteen to thirty-five, and the number of  strands of the belt round the body would be double that. Each strand  is made of three parts plaited together, and is one-eighth of an inch  or less in width. Various materials, including all the materials  used for armlets (see below), are employed for making these belts,  some for one and some for another. Sometimes a belt has its strands  all plaited out of one material only, in which case the belt will  be all of one colour. Sometimes its strands are plaited out of two  different coloured materials. There is no colouring of the belt,  except that of its strands.    Belt No. 1, as worn, is seen in Plates 9 and 11. Belt No. 3 is worn by  the man at the extreme right in Plate 16. It is worn by many of the  women figured in the plates, and several of them have two belts. One  of the women figured in Plates 18 and 19 has three of them. Belt No. 4  is worn by one of the men figured in Plates 7 and 8 (he has three of  them). Belt No. 7 is worn by one or two of the women figured in the  frontispiece, the one to the extreme right having a many-stranded belt,  and it is excellently illustrated in Plate 17.
