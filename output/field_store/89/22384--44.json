Come in here out of sight; I'm going to  take 'em off your trail.\"    While he spoke, he led, half carried Vic, into a thicket of shrubs with  a small open space at the center. The black and the wolf-dog followed  and now the stranger pulled at the bridle rein. The stallion kneeled  like a trained dog, and lying thus the shrubbery was high enough to  hide him. Closer, sweeping through the wood, Vic heard the crash of the  pursuit, yet the other was maddeningly slow of speech.    \"You stay here, partner, and sit over there. I'm borrowin' your gun\"--a  swift hand appropriated it from Vic's holster and his own fingers were  too paralyzed to resist--\"and don't you try to ride my hoss unless you  want them teeth in your throat. Lie quiet and tie up your hurt. Bart,  watch him!\"    And there sat Gregg where he had slipped down in his daze of weakness  with the great dog crouched at his feet and snarling ominously every  time he raised his hand. The voices came closer; the crashing burst on  his very ears, and now, through the interstices of the shrubbery he  saw the stranger swing into the saddle on Grey Molly and urge her to a  gallop. He could follow them for only an instant with his eyes, but it  seemed to Vic that Molly cantered under her new rider with strange ease  and lightness. It was partly the rest, no doubt, and partly the smaller  burden.    A deep beat of racing hoofs, and then the dusty roan shot out of the  trees close by with the sheriff leaning forward, jockeying his horse.  It seemed that no living thing could escape from that relentless rider.  Then right behind Vic a horse snorted and grunted--as it leaped a fallen  log, perhaps--and he watched in alarm to see if the stallion would  answer that sound with start or whinney. The black lay perfectly still,  and instead of lifting up to answer or to look, the head lowered with  ears flat back until the long, outstretched neck gave the animal a snaky  appearance. The dog, too, though it showed murderous fangs whenever Vic  moved, did not stir from his place, but lay flattening into the ground.    \"Cut to the right! Cut to the right, Harry!\" came the voice of the  sheriff, already piping from the distance as the last of the posse  brushed out from the trees. \"Yo hoi! Gus, take the left arroyo!\"    Two answering yells, and then the rush of hoofs fell away. They were  cornering the stranger, no doubt, and Vic struggled to lift himself to  his feet and watch until a faint sound from the dog made him look down.  Bart lay with his haunches drawn up under him, his forepaws digging  into the soft loam, his eyes demoniac. Instinctively Vic reached for his  absent gun, and then, despairing, relaxed to his former position. The  wolf-dog lowered his head to his paws and there remained with the eyes  following each intake of Gregg's breath. A rattle of gunshots flung back  loosely from the hills, and among them Vic winced at the sound of the  sheriff's rifle, clear and ringing over the bark of the revolvers.    Had they nailed the stranger? The firing recommenced, more faintly and  prolonged, so that it was plain the posse maintained a running fusilade  after the fugitive. After that fear of his own growing weakness shut  out all else from the mind of Gregg as he felt his senses, his physical  strength, flowing out like an ebb tide to a sea which, he knew, was  death. He began to work desperately to bind up the wound and stop the  flow of blood and it was fear which gave him momentary strength to tear  away his shirt and then with his teeth and left hand rip it into strips.  After that, heedless of the pain, he constructed a rude bandage, very  clumsily, for he had to work over his shoulder. Here his teeth, once  more, were almost as useful as another hand, and as the bandage grew  tight the deadly, warm trickle along his side lessened and his fingers  fell away from the last knot. He fainted.        Chapter VII. Joan Disobeys    What he next knew was a fire of agony that wrapped his whole body and  consciousness flashed back on him. Strong arms lifted him up, up; above  him he sensed the eyes of his torturer, dim in moonlight, and he beat  his clubbed left fist into that face. After that he knew he was being  dragged onto a saddle, but a wave of pain rushed up his side and numbed  his brain. Thereafter his senses returned by fits and starts, vaguely.  Once he felt a steel cable that girdled his waist and breast and held  him erect, though his head flopped back and forth; once his eyes opened  and above him glittered the bright field of stars towards which he  drifted through space, a mind without a body; once a stab of torment  wakened him enough to hear: \"Easy Satan; watch them stones. One more  jolt like that will send him clear to--\" And the voice glided into an  eternity of distance. Yet again he swung tip from the pit of darkness  and became aware of golden hair around a woman's face, and a marvelous  soft, cool hand upon his forehead. Her voice reached him, too, and made  him think of all things musical, all things distant, like the sounds of  birds falling from the sky and though he understood not a syllable, a  sweet assurance of safety flooded through him. He slept.    When he woke again, it was from a dream of fleeing through empty air  swifter than the wind with a wolf-dog looming behind him out of space,  but presently he found that he was lying in a bed with a stream of  sunlight washing across a white coverlet. A door at his right swung  open and there in the entrance stood the wolf-dog of his vision with a  five-year-old girl upon its back.    \"Don't go in there, Bart!\" whispered the child. \"Go on back!\"    She took one of those pointed wolf-ears in her chubby fist and tugged to  swing him around, but Bart, with a speed which the eye could not follow,  twisted his head and the rows of great teeth closed over her hand.  It was so horrible that the cry froze in the throat of Gregg, yet the  child, with only a little murmur of anger, reached over with her other  hand and caught the wolf by the nose.    \"Bad Bart!\" she whispered, and raised the hand which he instantly  released. White marks showed on the pudgy tan. \"Bad dog!\" she repeated,  and beat his neck with an impotent little fist. The wolf-dog cringed,  and turned from the door.    \"Come in,\" invited Gregg. He was surprised to find his voice thin, apt  to swing up to a high pitch beyond his control. A shower of golden curls  tossed away from her face as she looked to him. \"Oh!\" she cried, still  with a guarded voice. She leaned far over, one hand buried in the ruff  of Bart's neck to secure her balance, and with the other she laid hold  of his right ear and drew him around facing the door once more. This  time he showed his teeth but submitted, only twitching the ear back and  forth a time or two when she relaxed her hold.    \"Come in,\" repeated Gregg.    She canted her head to one side and considered him with fearless blue  eyes.    \"I want to,\" she sighed.    \"Why can't you, honey?\"    \"Munner says no.\"    He attempted to turn further towards her, but the pain in his right  shoulder prevented. He found that his arm was bandaged to the elbow and  held close to his side by a complex swathing.    \"Who is your mother?\" asked Vic.    \"Munner?\" she repeated, frowning in wonder. \"Why, munner is--my munner.\"    \"Oh,\" smiled he, \"and who's your pa?\"    \"What?\"    \"Who's your father? Who's your dad?\"    \"Daddy Dan. You ask a lot of things,\" she added, disapprovingly.    \"Come on in,\" pleaded Vic Gregg, \"and I won't ask nothin' more about  you.\"    \"Munner says no,\" she repeated.    She employed the moment of indecision by plucking at the hair of Bart's  shoulders; he growled softly, terribly, but she paid not the slightest  heed.    \"Your mother won't care,\" asserted Vic.    \"I know,\" she nodded, \"but Daddy will.\"    \"Spanking?\"    She looked blankly at him.    \"What will he do, then, if you come in to see me?\"    \"He'll look at me.\" She grew breathless at the thought, and cast a  guilty glance over her shoulder.    \"Honey,\" chuckled Gregg, weakly, \"I'll take all the blame. Just you come  along in and he'll do his lookin' at me.\"    He thought of the slender fellow who had rescued him and his large,  gentle brown eyes, but to a child even those mild eyes might seem  terrible with authority.    \"Will you, true?\" said the child, wistfully.    \"Honest and true.\"    \"All right.\" She made up her mind instantly, her face shining with  excitement. \"Giddap, Bart.\" And she thumped the wolf-dog vigorously with  her heels.    He carried her in with a few gliding steps, soundless, except for the  light rattle of claws on the floor, but he stopped well out of reach of  the bed and when Vic held his left hand as far as he could across his  chest, Bart winced and gave harsh warning. Vic had seen vicious dogs in  his day, seen them fighting, seen them playing, but he had never heard  one of them growl like this. The upper lips of the animal twitched  dangerously back and the sound came from the very depths of his body.  It made the flesh crawl along Vic's back; one rip of those great teeth  could tear a man's throat open. The child thudded her heels against the  ribs of Bart again.    \"Giddap!\" she cried.    The wolf-dog shuddered but would not budge an inch.    \"Naughty Bart!\" She slipped off to the floor. \"I'll make him come,\" she  said.    \"If it's the same to you,\" said Vic, rather hastily, \"I'd just as soon  he stayed where he is.\"    \"He's got to do what I want,\" she answered. She shook a tiny forefinger  at him. \"Bart, you just come here!\"    The dog turned his blazing eyes on her and replied with a growl that  shook his sides.    \"Stop!\" she ordered, and struck him sharply on the nose.

Unable to find accommodations at a hotel he slept on the railway station  floor. He said:    \"I had been on a trip to Sweden to see the midnight sun. I did not  realize the gravity of the situation until I saw the Russian fleet  cleared for action. This was only July 26th, at Kronstadt, where the  shipyards were working overtime.    \"I arrived at the Russian capital on the following day. Enormous  demonstrations were taking place. I was warned to get out and left on  the night of the 28th for Berlin. I saw Russian soldiers drilling at the  stations and artillery constantly on the move.    \"At Berlin I was warned to keep off the streets for fear of being  mistaken for an Englishmen. At Hamburg the number of warnings was  increased. Two Russians who refused to rise in a cafe when the German  anthem was played were attacked and badly beaten. I also saw two  Englishmen attacked in the street, but they finally were rescued by the  police.    \"There was a harrowing scene when the Hamburg-American Line steamer  Imperator canceled its sailing. She left stranded three thousand  passengers, most of them short of money, and the women wailing. About  one hundred and fifty of us were given passage in the second class of  the American Line steamship Philadelphia, for which I was offered $400  by a speculator.    \"The journey to Flushing was made in a packed train, its occupants  lacking sleep and food. No trouble was encountered on the frontier.\"    Theodore Hetzler, of the Fifth Avenue Bank, was appointed chairman of  the meeting for preliminary relief of the stranded tourists, and  committees were named to interview officials of the steamship companies  and of the hotels, to search for lost baggage, to make arrangements for  the honoring of all proper checks and notes, and to confer with the  members of the American embassy.    Oscar Straus, who arrived from Paris, said that the United States  embassy there was working hard to get Americans out of France. Great  enthusiasm prevailed at the French capital, he said, owing to the  announcement that the United States Government was considering a plan to  send transports to take Americans home.    The following committees were appointed at the meeting:    Finance--Theodore Hetzler, Fred I. Kent and James G. Cannon;  Transportation--Joseph F. Day, Francis M. Weld and George D. Smith, all  of New York; Diplomatic--Oscar S. Straus, Walter L. Fisher and James  Byrne; Hotels--L. H. Armour, of Chicago, and Thomas J. Shanley, New  York.    The committee established headquarters where Americans might register  and obtain assistance. Chandler Anderson, a member of the International  Claims Commission, arrived in London from Paris. He said he had been  engaged with the work of the commission at Versailles, when he was  warned by the American embassy that he had better leave France. He acted  promptly on this advice and the commission was adjourned until after the  war. Mr. Anderson had to leave his baggage behind him because the  railway company would not register it. He said the city of Paris  presented a strange contrast to the ordinary animation prevailing there.  Most of the shops were closed. There were no taxis in the streets, and  only a few vehicles drawn by horses.    The armored cruiser Tennessee, converted for the time being into a  treasure ship, left New York on the night of August 6th, 1914, to carry  $7,500,000 in gold to the many thousand Americans who were in want in  European countries. Included in the $7,500,000 was $2,500,000  appropriated by the government. Private consignments in gold in sums  from $1,000 to $5,000 were accepted by Colonel Smith, of the army  quartermaster's department, who undertook their delivery to Americans in  Paris and other European ports.    The cruiser carried as passengers Ambassador Willard, who returned to  his post at Madrid, and army and naval officers assigned as military  observers in Europe. On the return trip accommodations for 200 Americans  were available.    The dreadnaught Florida, after being hastily coaled and provisioned,  left the Brooklyn Navy Yard under sealed orders at 9.30 o'clock the  morning of August 6th and proceeded to Tompkinsville, where she dropped  anchor near the Tennessee.    The Florida was sent to protect the neutrality of American ports and  prohibit supplies to belligerent ships. Secretary Daniels ordered her to  watch the port of New York and sent the Mayflower to Hampton Roads.  Destroyers guarded ports along the New England coast and those at Lewes,  Del., to prevent violations of neutrality at Philadelphia and in that  territory. Any vessel that attempted to sail for a belligerent port  without clearance papers was boarded by American officials.    The Texas and Louisiana, at Vera Cruz and the Minnesota, at Tampico,  were ordered to New York, and Secretary Daniels announced that other  American vessels would be ordered north as fast as room could be found  for them in navy yard docks.    At wireless stations, under the censorship ordered by the President, no  code messages were allowed in any circumstances. Messages which might  help any of the belligerents in any way were barred.    The torpedo-boat destroyer Warrington and the revenue cutter  Androscoggin arrived at Bar Harbor on August 6th, to enforce neutrality  regulations and allowed no foreign ships to leave Frenchman's Bay  without clearance papers. The United States cruiser Milwaukee sailed the  same day from the Puget Sound Navy Yard to form part of the coast patrol  to enforce neutrality regulations.    Arrangements were made in Paris by Myron T. Herrick, the American  Ambassador, acting under instructions from Washington, to take over the  affairs of the German embassy, while Alexander H. Thackara, the American  Consul General, looked after the affairs of the German consulate.    President Poincare and the members of the French cabinet later issued a  joint proclamation to the French nation in which was the phrase  \"mobilization is not war.\"    The marching of the soldiers in the streets with the English, Russian  and French flags flying, the singing of patriotic songs and the shouting  of \"On to Berlin!\" were much less remarkable than the general demeanor  and cold resolution of most of the people.    The response to the order of mobilization was instant, and the stations  of all the railways, particularly those leading to the eastward, were  crowded with reservists. Many women accompanied the men until close to  the stations, where, softly crying, farewells were said. The troop  trains left at frequent intervals. All the automobile busses  disappeared, having been requisitioned by the army to carry meat, the  coachwork of the vehicles being removed and replaced with specially  designed bodies. A large number of taxicabs, private automobiles and  horses and carts also were taken over by the military for transport  purposes.    The wildest enthusiasm was manifested on the boulevards when the news of  the ordering of the mobilization became known. Bodies of men formed into  regular companies in ranks ten deep, paraded the streets waving the  tricolor and other national emblems and cheering and singing the  \"Marseillaise\" and the \"Internationale,\" at the same time throwing their  hats in the air. On the sidewalks were many weeping women and children.  All the stores and cafes were deserted.    All foreigners were compelled to leave Paris or France before the end of  the first day of mobilization by train but not by automobile. Time  tables were posted on the walls of Paris giving the times of certain  trains on which these people might leave the city.    American citizens or British subjects were allowed to remain in France,  except in the regions on the eastern frontier and near certain  fortresses, provided they made declaration to the police and obtained a  special permit.    As to Italy's situation, Rome was quite calm and the normal aspect made  tourists decide that Italy was the safest place. Austria's note to  Serbia was issued without consulting Italy. One point of the Triple  Alliance provided that no member should take action in the Balkans  before an agreement with the other allies. Such an agreement did not  take place. The alliance was of defensive, not aggressive, character and  could not force an ally to follow any enterprise taken on the sole  account and without a notice, as such action taken by Austria against  Serbia. It was felt even then that Italy would eventually cast its lot  with the Entente Allies.    Secretary of the Treasury William G. McAdoo; John Skelton Williams,  Comptroller of the Currency; Charles S. Hamblin and William P. G.  Harding, members of the Federal Reserve Board, went to New York early in  August, 1914, where they discussed relief measures with a group of  leading bankers at what was regarded as the most momentous conference of  the kind held in the country in recent years.    The New York Clearing House Committee, on August 2d, called a meeting of  the Clearing House Association, to arrange for the immediate issuance of  clearing house certificates. Among those at the conference were J. P.  Morgan and his partner, Henry P. Davison; Frank A. Vanderlip, president  of the National City Bank, and A. Barton Hepburn, chairman of the Chase  National Bank.        CHAPTER III    WHY THE WORLD WENT TO WAR    While it is true that the war was conceived in Berlin, it is none the  less true that it was born in the Balkans. It is necessary in order that  we may view with correct perspective the background of the World War,  that we gain some notion of the Balkan States and the complications  entering into their relations. These countries have been the adopted  children of the great European powers during generations of rulers.  Russia assumed guardianship of the nations having a preponderance of  Slavic blood; Roumania with its Latin consanguinities was close to"]]]
