But the science of  ethics will always console me for the ignorance of the physical  sciences.      68    Men are never taught to be gentlemen, and are taught everything else;  and they never plume themselves so much on the rest of their knowledge  as on knowing how to be gentlemen. They only plume themselves on knowing  the one thing they do not know.      69    _The infinites, the mean._--When we read too fast or too slowly, we  understand nothing.      70    _Nature_ ...--[Nature has set us so well in the centre, that if we  change one side of the balance, we change the other also. _I act._ +Ta  zoa trechei.+ This makes me believe that the springs in our brain are so  adjusted that he who touches one touches also its contrary.]      71    Too much and too little wine. Give him none, he cannot find truth; give  him too much, the same.      72    _Man's disproportion._--[This is where our innate knowledge leads us. If  it be not true, there is no truth in man; and if it be true, he finds  therein great cause for humiliation, being compelled to abase himself in  one way or another. And since he cannot exist without this knowledge, I  wish that, before entering on deeper researches into nature, he would  consider her both seriously and at leisure, that he would reflect upon  himself also, and knowing what proportion there is....] Let man then  contemplate the whole of nature in her full and grand majesty, and turn  his vision from the low objects which surround him. Let him gaze on that  brilliant light, set like an eternal lamp to illumine the universe; let  the earth appear to him a point in comparison with the vast circle  described by the sun; and let him wonder at the fact that this vast  circle is itself but a very fine point in comparison with that described  by the stars in their revolution round the firmament. But if our view be  arrested there, let our imagination pass beyond; it will sooner exhaust  the power of conception than nature that of supplying material for  conception. The whole visible world is only an imperceptible atom in the  ample bosom of nature. No idea approaches it. We may enlarge our  conceptions beyond all imaginable space; we only produce atoms in  comparison with the reality of things. It is an infinite sphere, the  centre of which is everywhere, the circumference nowhere.[30] In short  it is the greatest sensible mark of the almighty power of God, that  imagination loses itself in that thought.    Returning to himself, let man consider what he is in comparison with all  existence; let him regard himself as lost in this remote corner of  nature; and from the little cell in which he finds himself lodged, I  mean the universe, let him estimate at their true value the earth,  kingdoms, cities, and himself. What is a man in the Infinite?    But to show him another prodigy equally astonishing, let him examine the  most delicate things he knows. Let a mite be given him, with its minute  body and parts incomparably more minute, limbs with their joints, veins  in the limbs, blood in the veins, humours in the blood, drops in the  humours, vapours in the drops. Dividing these last things again, let him  exhaust his powers of conception, and let the last object at which he  can arrive be now that of our discourse. Perhaps he will think that here  is the smallest point in nature. I will let him see therein a new abyss.  I will paint for him not only the visible universe, but all that he can  conceive of nature's immensity in the womb of this abridged atom. Let  him see therein an infinity of universes, each of which has its  firmament, its planets, its earth, in the same proportion as in the  visible world; in each earth animals, and in the last mites, in which he  will find again all that the first had, finding still in these others  the same thing without end and without cessation. Let him lose himself  in wonders as amazing in their littleness as the others in their  vastness. For who will not be astounded at the fact that our body, which  a little while ago was imperceptible in the universe, itself  imperceptible in the bosom of the whole, is now a colossus, a world, or  rather a whole, in respect of the nothingness which we cannot reach? He  who regards himself in this light will be afraid of himself, and  observing himself sustained in the body given him by nature between  those two abysses of the Infinite and Nothing, will tremble at the sight  of these marvels; and I think that, as his curiosity changes into  admiration, he will be more disposed to contemplate them in silence than  to examine them with presumption.    For in fact what is man in nature? A Nothing in comparison with the  Infinite, an All in comparison with the Nothing, a mean between nothing  and everything. Since he is infinitely removed from comprehending the  extremes, the end of things and their beginning are hopelessly hidden  from him in an impenetrable secret, he is equally incapable of seeing  the Nothing from which he was made, and the Infinite in which he is  swallowed up.    What will he do then, but perceive the appearance of the middle of  things, in an eternal despair of knowing either their beginning or their  end. All things proceed from the Nothing, and are borne towards the  Infinite. Who will follow these marvellous processes? The Author of  these wonders understands them. None other can do so.    Through failure to contemplate these Infinites, men have rashly rushed  into the examination of nature, as though they bore some proportion to  her. It is strange that they have wished to understand the beginnings of  things, and thence to arrive at the knowledge of the whole, with a  presumption as infinite as their object. For surely this design cannot  be formed without presumption or without a capacity infinite like  nature.    If we are well informed, we understand that, as nature has graven her  image and that of her Author on all things, they almost all partake of  her double infinity. Thus we see that all the sciences are infinite in  the extent of their researches. For who doubts that geometry, for  instance, has an infinite infinity of problems to solve? They are also  infinite in the multitude and fineness of their premises; for it is  clear that those which are put forward as ultimate are not  self-supporting, but are based on others which, again having others for  their support, do not permit of finality. But we represent some as  ultimate for reason, in the same way as in regard to material objects we  call that an indivisible point beyond which our senses can no longer  perceive anything, although by its nature it is infinitely divisible.    Of these two Infinites of science, that of greatness is the most  palpable, and hence a few persons have pretended to know all things. \"I  will speak of the whole,\"[31] said Democritus.    But the infinitely little is the least obvious. Philosophers have much  oftener claimed to have reached it, and it is here they have all  stumbled. This has given rise to such common titles as _First  Principles_, _Principles of Philosophy_,[32] and the like, as  ostentatious in fact, though not in appearance, as that one which blinds  us, _De omni scibili_.[33]    We naturally believe ourselves far more capable of reaching the centre  of things than of embracing their circumference. The visible extent of  the world visibly exceeds us; but as we exceed little things, we think  ourselves more capable of knowing them. And yet we need no less capacity  for attaining the Nothing than the All. Infinite capacity is required  for both, and it seems to me that whoever shall have understood the  ultimate principles of being might also attain to the knowledge of the  Infinite. The one depends on the other, and one leads to the other.  These extremes meet and reunite by force of distance, and find each  other in God, and in God alone.    Let us then take our compass; we are something, and we are not  everything. The nature of our existence hides from us the knowledge of  first beginnings which are born of the Nothing; and the littleness of  our being conceals from us the sight of the Infinite.    Our intellect holds the same position in the world of thought as our  body occupies in the expanse of nature.    Limited as we are in every way, this state which holds the mean between  two extremes is present in all our impotence. Our senses perceive no  extreme. Too much sound deafens us; too much light dazzles us; too great  distance or proximity hinders our view. Too great length and too great  brevity of discourse tend to obscurity; too much truth is paralysing (I  know some who cannot understand that to take four from nothing leaves  nothing). First principles are too self-evident for us; too much  pleasure disagrees with us. Too many concords are annoying in music; too  many benefits irritate us; we wish to have the wherewithal to over-pay  our debts. _Beneficia eo usque laeta sunt dum videntur exsolvi posse; ubi  multum antevenere, pro gratia odium redditur._[34] We feel neither  extreme heat nor extreme cold. Excessive qualities are prejudicial to us  and not perceptible by the senses; we do not feel but suffer them.  Extreme youth and extreme age hinder the mind, as also too much and too  little education. In short, extremes are for us as though they were not,  and we are not within their notice. They escape us, or we them.    This is our true state; this is what makes us incapable of certain  knowledge and of absolute ignorance. We sail within a vast sphere, ever  drifting in uncertainty, driven from end to end. When we think to attach  ourselves to any point and to fasten to it, it wavers and leaves us; and  if we follow it, it eludes our grasp, slips past us, and vanishes for  ever. Nothing stays for us. This is our natural condition, and yet most  contrary to our inclination; we burn with desire to find solid"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18273"],[0,"The Wild Tribes of Davao District, Mindanao (#7)"],[1,"of baskets the surface is divided into three  parallel zones or decorative bands. These are produced by making a  slight variation in the weave, by the use of blackened strips of bamboo  and rattan, or by substituting in their place the black cuticle of a  fern.    As a rule the women of this tribe are not good potters and take little  pride in their work. In some districts the art has been entirely lost,  and the people depend on the coast natives for their cooking utensils.  At the village of Bansalan the women were found still to be proficient  in their work. After the dampened clay had been carefully kneaded in  order to remove lumps and gravel, the bottom of the jar was moulded with  the fingers and placed on a dish which was turned on a bit of cloth or a  board and answered the purpose of a potter's wheel. As the dish was  turned with the right hand the operator shaped the clay with the fingers  of the left adding fresh strips of material from time to time until the  desired size was obtained. The final shaping was done with a wooden  paddle and the jar was allowed to dry, after which it was smoothed off  with a stone. When ready for firing it was placed in the midst of a pile  of rubbish, over which green leaves were placed to cause a slow fire.    Other dishes are made by splitting a cocoanut in half and removing the  \"meat.\" This is readily accomplished by the use of a scraper fitted with  a rough iron blade (Fig. 25), over which the concave side or the half  nut is drawn. The cocoanut meat is used for food and oil.    FIG. 25. COCOANUT SCRAPER.    A little later we shall describe the active part woman takes in the  planting and care of the fields, but now we shall take up in some detail  the industry in which she stands pre-eminent, the preparation and  weaving of hemp.    The hemp ordinarily stripped by the men is considered too fine to be  used in the manufacture of clothing, so a smaller stripping device is  employed by the woman (Plate XX). On this she cleans the outer layers of  the hemp stalk, from which a stronger and coarser thread can be  obtained. The fiber is tied in a continuous thread and is wound onto a  reel. The warp threads are measured on sharpened sticks driven into a  hemp or banana stalk, and are then transferred to a rectangular frame  (Plate XXI). The operator, with the final pattern in mind, overties or  wraps with waxed threads, such portions of the warp as she desires to  remain white in the completed garment. So carefully does she wrap these  sections, that, when the thread is removed from the frame and placed in  the liquid dye, no portion of the coloring matter penetrates to the  portions thus protected. If a red color is desired the root of the  _sikarig_[17] palm is scraped and the scrapings placed in bark vats  filled with cold water. The thread is first washed in, and is later  boiled with the dye for a half hour, after which it is placed in a  basket to drain and dry. The process is repeated daily for about two  weeks, or until the thread assumes a brick red color. If a purple hue is  desired a little lime is added to the dye. Black is obtained by a  slightly different method. The leaves, root, and bark of the _pinarrEm_  tree are crushed in water. This yields a black liquor which is poured  into a jar containing the thread and the whole is placed over a slow  fire where it remains until the liquid is near the boiling point. When  this is reached the thread is removed and placed in a gourd, the open  end of which fits over the jar so as to catch the steam coming from the  dye. After a time the thread is removed and dried, and the process is  repeated until at last a permanent black is obtained. After the coloring  is complete the thread is again placed on the rectangular frame, the  over-tying is removed and the warp is ready for the loom (Plate XXII.)  In the loom (Plate XXIII) the threads encircle a bamboo pole attached to  the wall, and are held tense by a strap which passes around the waist of  the operator. The weft threads are forced up against the fabric by means  of the comber board and are beaten in with a baton. The warp threads are  held in their relative positions, first by the comber board, second by  loops which pass under the lower threads and over a small stick or lease  rod, and lastly by passing over and under, or around, other lease rods.  These are rolled away as the work progresses.    [17] _Morinda Bracteata Roxb_.    [18] Woof threads are generally of one color. A somewhat similar process  used in Java is described by SIR THOS. RAFFLES in The History of Java,  Vol. I, p. 189.    [Transcriber's note: Although footnote 2 appears on the same page as the  above paragraph, it is not clear to what particular part of that  paragraph it refers.]    After the cloth is removed from the loom it is polished. A long pole of  _palma brava_ is fitted into a notch in the roof. The operator seats  herself on the floor with a smooth board before her, or in her lap, and  on it places the dampened cloth. A shell is fitted over the lower end of  the pole, which is bent and made bowlike, until the shell rests on the  cloth. It is then ironed rapidly to and fro until the fabric has  received a high polish (Plate XXIV).    The woman's duties do not end with the manufacture of cloth, for all the  garments worn by the members of the tribe are the result of her  handiwork. She sews the strips of hemp cloth into skirts, men's  trousers, carrying bags, and sometimes into jackets. The women devote  hours of labor to these jackets, covering arms, necks, and waist bands  with colored embroidery or designs in applique, while on the better  garments they place elaborate designs in beads or shell disks.    After the evening meal is over the women of the household gather around  the flickering lights, and until far into the night work on these  garments, bead necklaces, or other ornaments.    Only a few of the weavers attempt to make the peculiar chocolate-colored  head covering worn by the _magani_. For these kerchiefs the woman weaves  a square cotton cloth of the desired size, and at one corner attaches a  small brass hook. Joined to the hook, by means of a chain, is a loop  which fits over the toes of the operator, thus enabling her to keep the  fabric taut while her hands are left free for work. Small sections of  this cloth are raised and are wrapped with waxed thread, so that when  the fabric is dyed these portions will not receive the coloring matter  (Plate XXV). Later the overtying is removed, leaving small white rings  or squares on a chocolate-colored background. These cloths are meant  primarily for the warriors, but expert weavers, who are under the  protection of a certain powerful spirit, are also permitted to wear an  upper garment of this material.    A considerable part of the man's time is consumed in preparation for, or  actual participation in, hunting or warfare, but in addition to this he  does a goodly portion of the work in the fields, and is the house  builder. When a man is about to erect a dwelling he notifies his friends  to come and aid him. This they will do without pay, but when in need of  similar services they will expect and will receive similar help. All  sorts of house-furnishings, such as spoons, meat blocks, or rice mortars  are made by the man, and not infrequently, he assists in the making or  waterproofing of baskets. A few of the old men of Cibolan still engage  in the manufacture of small shell disks with which valuable suits are  decorated, but the greater part of those now in use have been inherited,  or are purchased from neighboring peoples. The men carve beads out of  \"Job's tears\"[19] and make them into necklaces. For this purpose a  peculiarly carved and decorated stick is employed (Plate XXVI). This is  placed in the palm of the left hand so that the thumb and forefinger can  hold the seed which fits into a depression in the top. A knife in the  right hand of the artist is worked over the seed thus cutting a line  into which dirt is rubbed. Women's combs are made by shaping a half  circle out of light wood and then cutting teeth into it with a saw-like  blade of tin or iron.    [19] _Coix lachryma Johi L_.    Among the men, as with the women, certain industries are monopolized by  a few individuals. In this community no men stand higher in the  estimation of their fellows than do the smiths and the casters of  copper. The writer spent many hours watching I-o, the brass and copper  worker of Cibolan, while he shaped bells, bracelets, and betel boxes at  his forge on the outskirts of the village (Plate XXVII). Feathered  plungers, which worked up and down in two bamboo cylinders, forced air  through a small clay-tipped tube into a charcoal fire. This served as a  bellows, while a small cup made of straw ashes formed an excellent  crucible. The first day I watched I-o, he was making bells. Taking a  ball of wax the size of a bucket shot, he put it on the end of a stick  (Fig. 26a), and over this moulded the form of a bell in damp ashes  obtained from rice straw (b). When several bells were thus fashioned  they were dipped in melted wax and were turned on a leaf until smooth,  after which an opening was cut through the wax at the bottom of each  form (c). Strips of wax were rolled out and laid in shallow grooves  which had been cut in the sides of the bells and were pressed in, at  intervals, with a small bamboo knife (d). The top stick was then  withdrawn, leaving an opening down to the wax ball inside. Into this  hole a thin strip of wax was inserted and was doubled back on itself so  as to form a hanger (e). For three days the forms were allowed to harden  and were covered with several coats of damp straw ashes. Finally they  were laid in a bed of the same material with a thin strip of wax leading  from each bell to a central core (f).
