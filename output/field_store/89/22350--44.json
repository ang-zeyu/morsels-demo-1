Cardinal Bourne assisted at the service,  and the ceremonial was of a most  impressive and ornate character,  gorgeous vestments, beautiful music, and  the gleam of many lights combining  to make a tout ensemble that suggested  some  great  occasion  of  national  thanksgiving,  as,  indeed,  it  was.  Scarlet and  green were  the brilliant colour-notes  of the  function. The  celebrant of the Mass was Mgr.  Canon Moyes, other dignitaries taking part  in  the  service.  Amongst  the  congregation were  the  children  of  the  King  of the  Belgians--Prince Leopold,  Duc de  Brabant; Prince  Charles,  Comte  de  Flandre; and  Princess  Marie-Jose,  of  all  of whom  we  give  portraits.--[Photo. by C.N.]          __________________________________________________________________________                                 THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, NOV. 18, 1914--43      [Illustration: THE KING AS GIVER OF WAR-MASCOTS: THE GOAT PRESENTED BY  HIS MAJESTY TO THE 7TH ROYAL WELSH FUSILIERS.]    The King recently  presented the white goat shown in  the above photograph  to the 7th Battalion (Reserve) Royal Welsh Fusiliers, who, since they were  raised,  have been  in  training at  Newtown,  Montgomeryshire. The  Welsh  Fusiliers have always had a white goat  as a mascot, drawn from the famous  herd of  Cashmere goats which  also supplied  the King's gift.  The animal  given  by his  Majesty to  the  new battalion  was taken  from Windsor  to  Newtown under escort,  and was received at  the station by two  men of the  7th Royal Welsh  Fusiliers, who stood with fixed bayonets.

(left half)]    Nothing  could  give a  better  idea  of  shell-fire than  the  remarkable  photograph here reproduced.  It is a panoramic view of  a German artillery  bombardment of advancing  infantry, and was taken in  three sections, well  within  a hundred  and fifty  yards of  some of  the bursting  shells. The  locality  of the  battle  is  in the  Argonne  country  between the  Upper  Aisne and  the Meuse,  where the  French are  having continuous  and stiff  fighting. Men of  the French infantry keeping under cover  in one of their  advanced trenches  are seen  in the  left foreground  of the  picture. The  object  of  the  actual  fighting  on  the  occasion  was  to  keep  apart  the  Third  German  army  as  it  fell  back  towards  prepared  positions  near  the Meuse  and a  force  of reinforcing  troops coming  up from  the  direction of Metz.  \"To impede the persistent advance of  our ---- corps.\"          __________________________________________________________________________                                 THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, NOV. 18, 1914--45      [Illustration: \"SIX GERMAN SHELLS TO EVERY FRENCH SOLDIER\"--SHRAPNEL AND  HIGH-EXPLOSIVE BOMBS BURSTING IN THE OPEN: A PANORAMIC PHOTOGRAPH TAKEN  DURING A BATTLE IN THE ARGONNE. (right half)]    writes a French  correspondent on the spot, the  enemy resisted vigorously  and with  his heavy artillery.  He treated us  to shells with  a veritable  prodigality, but  without causing us  very serious losses. In  the forward  movement, led by the ---- infantry regiment, on an important position that  had to  be taken,  practically every  soldier engaged  was saluted  by six  shells. There  was, though, no 'shyness'  among our men. They  laughed and  joked with one  another as they quitted the trenches  to move forward over  the  open. By  the  evening the  enemy's position  had  been taken.\"  Both  ordinary shrapnel and high-explosive 15-c.m.  shells from the German heavy  position-batteries of howitzers, which weapons the Germans prefer for such  work, although they  also use guns of the same  calibre, are seen bursting  in front of the French troops.          __________________________________________________________________________  46--THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, NOV. 18, 1914.      [Illustration: HOME AFTER A GERMAN VISITATION: A ROOM IN A HOUSE AT  NIEUPORT AFTER A SHELL HAD BURST.]    Nieuport has been badly damaged by  the German bombardment, and it is said  that half the houses in it appear  to have been struck by shells, yet that  it has not been so utterly ruined as some of the surrounding villages. The  worst loss  as regards buildings at  Nieuport has been the  destruction of  the  church,  which,  as  many  photographs show  well,  has  been  almost  completely demolished.  It was  a fine  specimen of one  of the  few stone  churches found  in that part  of the country, with  twelfth-century Gothic  windows. The walls and pillars stand bare, the roof has gone, and half the  tower, whose bells  lie buried on the ground amid  the wreckage. Desultory  fighting continued at Nieuport after  the main German attack shifted south  to Ypres.--[Photo. by C.N.]          __________________________________________________________________________                                 THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, NOV. 18, 1914--47      [Illustration: WHAT IT MEANS TO VILLAGERS TO HAVE GERMANS BILLETED UPON  THEM: MOTOR-CORPS OFFICERS ASLEEP IN A COTTAGE.]    The  inhabitants of  those parts  of France  and Belgium  which are  still  groaning under  the German incubus  are greatly  to be pitied.  Beyond the  terrible agony inflicted by the  invaders upon defenceless populations, in  the form  of executions and  house-burnings and various forms  of outrage,  there is a great  mass of less drastic but still  intolerable misery to be  borne by  those unfortunate  householders who are  compelled to  house and  feed the soldiers of the enemy. Some  idea of the nature of the infliction  to which they  are subjected can be  gathered from such a  drawing as that  here  reproduced.  It  shows  some  officers of  the  motor-corps  of  the  Nineteenth German Army  Corps asleep in a house upon  which they have been  billeted. The drawing is by a German artist.          __________________________________________________________________________  48--THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, NOV. 18, 1914.      [Illustration: AT YPRES, WITH THE BRITISH: THE FRENCH NAVAL BRIGADE  CHARGING.]    Much hard fighting  on the Yser and elsewhere in  West Flanders has fallen  to the lot of the French bluejackets  of the Naval Brigade, a strong force  of whom  were brought  up from  Brest to reinforce  the Belgians  in their  defensive battles near the coast after the retreat from Antwerp. Attacking  side by side with the British, they  retook Ypres on October 13, and after  that held Dixmude for weeks.

Our  photographs  were  taken  on  and  near  the  battlefield.  No.  1 on  the  first page  represents a  preliminary  incident. It  shows  an  Austrian  patrol  captured  while   pressing  forward  with  the  rash  assurance that  characterised the  Austrian headlong advance.  No. 2  is a  battlefield  scene, on  December 3,  when the  Serbians suddenly  attacked  the  Austrians  and  broke  up  their  positions  at  all  points  at  the  outset,  making  whole regiments,  scattered  and  isolated among  ravines  and  valleys,  in  many  instances, surrender  at  discretion.  One  corps  of  disarmed  Austrian  prisoners  is  seen while  being  marched  to  the                                                        [_Continued opposite._          __________________________________________________________________________                      THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, DEC. 30, 1914--[Part 21]--43      [Illustration: SERBIAN WOMEN IN THE FIELD WITH THEIR MEN: PEASANTS  BRINGING A WOUNDED SOLDIER TO THE DRESSING-TENT.]    _Continued._]    rear.  No. 3  shows Serbian  villagers placing  wreaths on  the graves  of  fallen  countrymen. Photograph  No. 4  lets  us realise  something of  the  heroic part the women villagers took in helping to achieve the triumph. As  the  battle took  shape they  came forward  and cheered  the men-folk  on,  calling out  \"Napred, braco,  Napred,\" \"Forward, brothers,  forward,\" also  helping (as our photograph shows) to push the cannon and ease the worn-out  horses. Yet another instance of the work the Serbian women did is shown in  our page  photograph. Owing to the  lack of Red Cross  men attendants, the  peasant women took  on themselves to serve  as stretcher-bearers, bringing  in  the wounded,  as these  fell in  fight, to  the dressing-tents  in the  villages and  the churches,  which were  used as  hospitals.--[_Photos. by  Topical._]          __________________________________________________________________________  44--THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, DEC. 30, 1914.--[Part 21]      [Illustration: WITH \"SPIT\" HELD BY RIFLES, A SPADE, AND A COUPLE OF  STICKS: COOKING THE CHRISTMAS GEESE AT THE FRONT.]    There was no Christmas  truce at the front. The grim  realities of the war  over-rode all considerations  of sentiment, and the hope which  was, for a  while, common to both sides had to be left unfulfilled. None the less, the  Season was not  without its little luxuries, and, thanks  to the excellent  work  of the  Army Service  Corps  and the  thoughtfulness of  sympathetic  friends  at home,  there  was  no dearth  of  substantial necessaries  and  comforts, as well as tobacco and cigarettes galore. Our illustration shows  a group  of soldiers  cooking their  Christmas geese in  the open,  and as  intent  upon their  task as  though  such conditions  were quite  orthodox  and  even such  minor alarums  as  \"spasmodic artillery  duels, and  local  fusillades\" were things unheard of.--[_Photo. by L.N.A._]          __________________________________________________________________________                      THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, DEC. 30, 1914--[Part 21]--45      [Illustration: CHRISTMAS AT THE FRONT: BRITISH SOLDIERS BRINGING IN  MISTLETOE.]    It is pleasant  to think that, with  all the dangers and  anxieties of the  war, our soldiers at the front paid  tribute to the season of goodwill. It  is a reassuring picture, this of the  two men in khaki, rifle on shoulder,  but  swinging  from the  deadly  barrels  berried  mistletoe, so  rich  in  suggestion of the happiness of Christmases when the scourge of war was not  upon the nations.--[_Photograph by L.N.A._]      [Illustration: TRYING A BRITISH DAINTY! A FRENCH SOLDIER EATING  CHRISTMAS PUDDING.]    The  conditions under  which tens  of  thousands of  soldiers spent  their  Christmas were memorably abnormal, but, none  the less, the season was not  passed  without such  observance of  old customs,  and such  care for  all  available good  cheer, as were  possible. Our illustration shows  a French  soldier obviously enjoying  his Christmas dinner despite the  fact that he  has to eat it by the wayside.--[_Photo. by Alfieri._]          __________________________________________________________________________  46--THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, DEC. 30, 1914.--[Part 21]      [Illustration: A MISSING LONDONER! AN ENGLISH M.E.T. MOTOR-'BUS IN THE  HANDS OF THE GERMANS AND PUT TO USE BY THEM.]    As with our  London soldiers at the  front, the fortune of  war has levied  its toll on  other Londoners. Our photograph depicts  the unfortunate fate  that has befallen  a once well-known object in the  streets of London--one  of  the motor-'buses  shipped across  to France  to serve  in transporting  British troops to  the front, now in  the hands of the enemy.  Not many of  them have  had such bad luck,  from all accounts, but  accidents cannot be  helped, and  a victim  has been  claimed now and  again, mostly  at places  where some raiding  Uhlan patrol has managed  to cut in and  ambush one on  some outlying road  near the line of communications between  the front and  an  army base,  catching the  'bus while  returning after  discharging its  soldier \"fares.\"          __________________________________________________________________________                      THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, DEC. 30, 1914--[Part 21]--47      [Illustration: WEAPONS OF GREY \"MOLES,\" AT TSING-TAU: A LAND-MINE AND  EMERGENCY HAND-GRENADES CAPTURED FROM THE GERMANS.]    The Germans made use of land-mines in  the defence of Tsing-tau, and a few  days after  the town's surrender, on  Nov. 7, several exploded  while they  were being  removed by  the Japanese,  causing much loss  of life.  It was  stated  that the  explosions  killed  two officers  and  eight men,  while  one  officer  and  fifty-six  men  were injured.  The  Germans  also  used  hand-grenades, as  shown in our photograph.  These appear to have  been of  the improvised \"jam-tin\" type such as has been employed in the trenches in  Flanders  \"Eye-Witness\" wrote  recently: \"Mines  have not  played such  an  important part  in this  mole-work as  might have  been supposed.  We have  heard the  enemy mining and  we have tried  it ourselves, but  one strikes  water in  this country  between seven and  eight feet  down.\"--[_Photo. by  C.N._]          __________________________________________________________________________  48--THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, DEC. 30, 1914.--[Part 21]      [Illustration: IN SHELTERS SUGGESTING A ROW OF MINIATURE RAILWAY-ARCHES!  GERMANS IN THEIR \"RABBIT-WARRENS\" IN THE ARGONNE.]    \"In  the Argonne  we  beat  back the  enemy's  attacks  and preserved  our  front.\" That  is a typical announcement  one constantly sees in  the Paris  _communiques_ recording events in the  district where the photograph given  above was taken. Special interest being taken in the fighting in Flanders,  one rather  overlooks the give-and-take  warfare being carried  on further  east, where  siege-trench fighting like that  on the Aisne still  goes on.  There the  Germans occupy deeply  dug lines which  are largely made  up of  underground  galleries partly  natural, partly  artificial, in  character,  as  our  photograph shows.  When  the  French  artillery fire  is  severe,  the  Germans  scuttle like  rabbits  into  their  burrows, coming  out  to  man  the  trenches in  front  immediately  the  French infantry  begin  to  approach.--[_Photo. by C.N._]    ==========================================================================    London: Published Weekly at the Office,  172, Strand, in the Parish of St.  Clement  Danes, in  the county  of London,  by <sc>The  Illustrated London  News  and  Sketch,  Ltd.</sc>,  172, Strand,  aforesaid;  and  Printed  by  <sc>The  Illustrated  London News  and  Sketch,  Ltd.</sc>, Milford  Lane,  W.C.--<sc>Wednesday, Dec. 30, 1914.</sc>          __________________________________________________________________________      ========================================================================    To ensure a regular supply of  the following papers, the Publisher would    be glad if you  would sign the order (or orders) below  and send to your    Railway Bookstall or Local Newsagent.    ========================================================================                                       :                                       :  _To Messrs._ _____________________    _To Messrs._ _____________________ :                                       :  __________________________________                                       :    __________________________________ :  _Please supply me each week with a                                       :  copy of_ THE SKETCH.    _Please supply me each  week  with :  __________________________________    a copy of_ THE ILLUSTRATED LONDON  :    NEWS.                              :  __________________________________    __________________________________ :....................................                                       :                                       :  _To Messrs._ _____________________    __________________________________ :                                       :  __________________________________                                       :    __________________________________ :  _Please supply me each week during                                       :  the War with a copy of_                                       :  THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS.    __________________________________ :  __________________________________                                       :                                       :"]]]
