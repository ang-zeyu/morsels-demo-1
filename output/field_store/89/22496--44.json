When the sunburn caused by her sea-voyage had  yielded to a course of treatment, it left her with a complexion which  put even that of Stephanie Radford, the acknowledged school beauty, in  the shade. The coral tinge in Rona's cheeks was, as Doris Deane  enviously remarked, \"almost too good to look natural\", and her blue eyes  with the big pupils and the little dark rims round the iris shone like  twinkling stars when she laughed. That ninnying laugh, to be sure, was  still somewhat offensive, but she was trying to moderate it, and only  when she forgot did it break out to scandalize the refined atmosphere of  The Woodlands; the small white even teeth which it displayed, and two  conspicuous dimples, almost atoned for it. The brown hair was brushed  and waved and its consequent state of new glossiness was a very distinct  improvement on the former elf locks. In the sunshine it took tones of  warm burnt sienna, like the hair of the Madonna in certain of Titian's  great pictures. Lessons, alack! were uphill work. Rona was naturally  bright, but some subjects she had never touched before, and in others  she was hopelessly backward. The general feeling in the school was that  \"The Cuckoo\", as they nicknamed her, was an experiment, and no one could  guess exactly what she would grow into.    \"She's like one of those queer beasties we dug up under the yew-tree  last autumn,\" suggested Merle Denham. \"Those wriggling transparent  things, I mean. Don't you remember? We kept them in a box, and didn't  know whether they'd turn out moths, or butterflies, or earwigs, or  woodlice!\"    \"They turned into cockchafer beetles, as a matter of fact,\" said Ulyth  drily.    \"Well, they were horrid enough in all conscience. I don't like Nature  study when it means hoarding up creepy-crawlies.\"    \"You're not obliged to take it.\"    \"I don't this year. I've got Harmony down on my time-table instead.\"    \"You'll miss the rambles with Teddie.\"    \"I don't care. I'll play basket-ball instead.\"    \"How about the blackberry foray?\"    \"Oh, I'm not going to be left out of that! It's not specially Nature  study. I've put my name down with Miss Moseley's party.\"    The inmates of The Woodlands were fond of jam. It was supplied to them  liberally, and they consumed large quantities of it at tea-time. To help  to meet this demand, blackberrying expeditions were organized during the  last weeks of September, and the whole school turned out in relays to  pick fruit. A dozen girls and a mistress generally composed a party,  which was not confined to any particular form, but might include any  whose arrangements for practising or special lessons allowed them to go.  Dates and particulars of the various rambles planned, with the names of  the mistresses who were to be leaders, were pinned up on the  notice-board, and the girls might put their names to them as they liked,  so long as each list did not exceed twelve.    On Saturday afternoon Miss Moseley headed a foray in the direction of  Porth Powys Falls, and Merle, Ulyth, Rona, Addie, and Stephanie were  members of her flock.    \"I'm glad I managed to get into this party,\" announced Merle, \"because I  always like Porth Powys better than Pontvoelas or Aberceiriog. It's a  jollier walk, and the blackberries are bigger and better. I was the very  last on the list, so I'd luck. Alice had to go under Teddie's wing. I'd  rather have Mosie than Teddie!\"    \"So would I,\" agreed Ulyth. \"I scribbled my name the very first of all.  Just got a chance to do it as I was going to my music-lesson, before  everyone else made a rush for the board. Porth Powys will be looking no  end to-day.\"    Swinging their baskets, the girls began to climb a narrow path which ran  alongside the stream up the glen. Some of them were tempted to linger,  and began to gather what blackberries could be found; but Miss Moseley  had different plans.    \"Come along! It's ridiculous to waste our labour here,\" she exclaimed.  \"All these bushes have been well picked over already. We'll walk  straight on till we come to the lane near the ruined cottage, then we  shall get a harvest and fill our baskets in a third of the time. Quick  march!\"    There was sense in her remarks, so Merle abandoned several half-ripe  specimens for which she had been reaching and joined the file that was  winding, Indian fashion, up the path through the wood. Over a high,  ladder-like stile they climbed, then dropped down into the gorge to  where a small wooden bridge spanned the stream. They loved to stand here  looking at the brown rushing water that swirled below. The thick trees  made a green parlour, and the continual moisture had carpeted the woods  with beautiful verdant moss which grew in close sheets over the rocks.  Up again, by an even steeper and craggier track, they climbed the  farther bank of the gorge, and came out at last on to the broad  hill-side that overlooked the Craigwen Valley.    Here was scope for a leader; the track was so overgrown as to be almost  indistinguishable, and ran across boggy land, where it was only too easy  to plunge over one's boot-tops in oozy peat. Miss Moseley found the way  like a pioneer; she had often been there before and remembered just what  places were treacherous and just where it was possible to use a swinging  bough for a help. By following in her footsteps the party got safely  over without serious wettings, and sat down to take breath for a few  minutes on some smooth, glacier-ground rocks that topped the ridge they  had been scaling. They were now at some height above the valley, and the  prospect was magnificent. For at least ten miles they could trace the  windings of the river, and taller and more distant mountain peaks had  come into view.    \"Some people say that Craigwen Valley's very like the Rhine,\"  volunteered Ulyth. \"It hasn't any castles, of course, except at  Llangarmon, but the scenery's just as lovely.\"    \"Nice to think it's British then,\" rejoiced Merle. \"Wales can hold its  own in the way of mountains and lakes. People have no need to go abroad  for them. What's New Zealand like, Rona?\"    \"We've ripping rivers there,\" replied the Cuckoo, \"bigger than this by  lots, and with tree-ferns up in the bush. This isn't bad, though, as far  as it goes. What's that place over across on the opposite hill?\"    \"Where the light's shining? Oh, that's Llanfairgwyn! There's a village  and a church. We've only been once. It's rather a long way, because you  have to cross the ferry at Glanafon before you can get to the other side  of the river.\"    \"And what's that big white house in the trees, with the flag?\"    \"That's Plas Cafn. It's _the_ place in the neighbourhood, you know,\"  said Stephanie, fondly fingering her necklace.    \"I don't know. How should I?\"    \"Well, you know it now, at any rate.\"    \"Does it belong to toffs?\"    \"It belongs to Lord and Lady Glyncraig. They live there for part of the  year.\"    \"Oh!\" said Rona. She put her chin on her hand and surveyed the distant  mansion for several moments in silence. \"I reckon they're stuck up,\"  she remarked at last.    \"I believe they're considered nice. I've never spoken to them,\" replied  Ulyth.    \"I have,\" put in Stephanie complacently. \"I went to tea once at Plas  Cafn. It was when Father was Member for Rotherford. Lord Glyncraig knew  him in Parliament, of course, and he happened to meet Father and me just  when we were walking past the gate at Plas Cafn, and asked us in to  tea.\"    Merle, Addie, and Ulyth smiled. This visit, paid four years ago, was the  standing triumph of Stephanie's life. She never forgot, nor allowed any  of her schoolfellows to forget, that she had been entertained by the  great people of the neighbourhood.    \"He wasn't Lord Glyncraig then; he was only Sir John Mitchell, Baronet.  He's been raised to a peerage since,\" said Merle, willing to qualify  some of the glory of Stephanie's reminiscences.    \"We don't grow peers in Waitoto, or baronets either, for the matter of  that,\" observed Rona. \"I don't guess they're wanted out with us. We'd  have no place in the bush for a Lord Glyncraig.\"    \"You'd better claim acquaintance with him, as your name's Mitchell too.  How proud he'd be of the honour!\" teased Addie.    Coral flooded the whole of the Cuckoo's face. She had begun to  understand the difference between her rough upbringing and the refined  homes of the other girls, and she resented the sneers that were often  made at her expense.    \"Our butcher at home is Joseph Mitchell,\" hinnied Merle.    \"Mitchell's a common enough name,\" said Ulyth. \"I know two families in  Scotland and some people at Plymouth all called Mitchell. They're none  of them related to each other, and probably not to Merle's butcher or to  Lord Glyncraig.\"    \"Nor to me,\" said Rona. \"I'm a democrat, and I glory in it. Stephanie's  welcome to her grand friends if she likes them.\"    \"I do like them,\" sighed Stephanie plaintively. \"I love aristocratic  people and nice houses and things. Why shouldn't I? You needn't grin,  Addie Knighton; you'd know them yourself if you could. When I come out  I'd like to be presented at Court, and go to a ball where the people are  all dukes and duchesses and earls and countesses. It would be worth  while dancing with a duke, especially if he wore the Order of the  Garter!\"    \"Until that glorious day comes you'll have to dance with poor little me  for a partner,\" giggled Merle.    \"Aren't you all rested? We shall get no blackberries if we don't hurry  on,\" called Miss Moseley from the other end of the rock.    Everybody scrambled up immediately and set out again over the  bracken-covered hill-side. Another half-mile and they had reached the  bourne of their expedition. The narrow track through the gorse and fern  widened suddenly into a lane, a lane with very high, unmortared walls,  over which grew a variety of bramble with a particularly luscious  fruit. Every connoisseur of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20733"],[0,"Critical Miscellanies (Vol. 1 of 3), Essay 1: Robespierre (#7)"],[1,"would have  saved the Constitution. Their experience, the loss of which it is the  fashion to deplore, could have had no application to the strange  combinations of untoward circumstance that were now rising up with such  deadly rapidity in every quarter of the horizon, like vast sombre banks  of impenetrable cloud. Prudence in new cases, as has been somewhere  said, can do nothing on grounds of retrospect. The work of the  Constituent was doomed by the very nature of things. Their assumption  that the Revolution was made, while all France was still torn by fierce  and unappeasable disputes as to seignorial rights, was one of the most  striking pieces of self-deception in history. It is told how in the  eleventh century, when the fervent hosts of the Crusaders tramped across  Europe on their way to deliver the Holy City from the hands of the  unbelievers, the wearied children, as they espied each new town that lay  in their interminable march, cried out with joyful expectation, 'Is not  this, then, Jerusalem?' So France had set out on a portentous journey,  little knowing how far off was the end; lightly taking each poor  halting-place for the deeply longed-for goal; and waxing more fiercely  disappointed, as each new height that they gained only disclosed yet  farther and more unattainable horizons. 'Alas,' said Burke, 'they little  know how many a weary step is to be taken, before they can form  themselves into a mass which has a true political personality.'    An immense revolution had been effected, but by what force were its  fruits to be guarded? Each step in the revolution had raised a host of  irreconcilable enemies. The rights of property, the old and jealous  associations of local independence, the traditions of personal dignity,  the relations of the civil to the spiritual power--these were the  momentous matters about which the lawmakers of the Constituent had  exercised themselves. The parties of the Chamber had for these two  years past been laying mine and countermine among the very deepest  foundations of society. One by one each great corporation of the old  order had been alienated from the new order. It was inevitable that it  should be so. Let us look at one or two examples of this. The monarchy  had imposed administrative centralisation upon France without securing  national unity. Thus the great provinces that had been slowly added one  after the other to the monarchy, while becoming members of the same  kingdom, still retained different institutions and isolated usages. The  time was now come when France should be France, and its inhabitants  Frenchmen, and no longer Bretons, Normans, Gascons, Provencals. The  Assembly by a single decree (1790) redivided the country into  eighty-three departments. It wiped out at a stroke the separate  administrations, the separate parlements, the peculiar privileges, and  even the historic names of the old provinces. We need not dwell on the  significance of this change here, but will only remark in passing that  the stubborn disputes from the time of the Regency downwards between the  Crown and the provincial parlements turned, under other names and in  other forms, upon this very issue of the unification of the law. The  Crown was with the progressive party, but it lacked the strength and  courage to set aside retrograde local sentiment as the Constituent  Assembly was able to set it aside.    Then this prodigious change in the distribution of government was  accompanied by no less prodigious a change in the source of power.  Popular election replaced the old system of territorial privilege and  aristocratic prerogative. The effect of this vital innovation, followed  as it was a few months later by a decree abolishing titles and armorial  bearings, was to complete the estrangement of the old privileged classes  from the revolutionary movement. All that they had meant to concede was  the payment of an equal land tax. What was life worth to the noble, if  common people were to be allowed to wear arms and to command a company  of foot or a troop of horse; if he was no longer to have thousands of  acres left waste for the chase; if he was compelled to sue for a vote  where he had only yesterday reigned as manorial lord; if, in short, he  was at a stroke to lose all those delights of insolence and vanity which  had made, not the decoration, but the very substance, of his days?    Nor were the nobles of the sword and the red-heeled slipper the only  outraged class. The magistracy of the provincial parliaments were  inflamed with resentment against changes that stripped them of the power  of exciting against the new government the same factious and  impracticable spirit with which they had on so many occasions  embarrassed the old. The clergy were thrown even still more violently  into opposition. The Assembly, sorely pressed for resources, declared  the property held by ecclesiastics, amounting to a revenue of not less  than eight million pounds sterling a year, or double that amount in  modern values, to be the property of the nation. Talleyrand carried a  measure decreeing the sale of the ecclesiastical domain. The clergy were  as intensely irritated as laymen would have been by a similar assertion  of sovereign right. And their irritation was made still more dangerous  by the next set of measures against them.    The Assembly withdrew all recognition of Catholicism as the religion of  the State; monastic vows were abolished, and orders and congregations  suppressed; the ecclesiastical divisions were made to coincide with the  civil divisions, a bishop being allotted to each department. What was a  more important revolution than all, bishops and incumbents were  henceforth to be appointed by popular election. The Assembly, who had  always the institutions of our own country before them, meant to  introduce into France the system of the Church of England, which was  even then an anachronism in the land of its birth; much worse was such a  system an anachronism, after belief had been sapped by a Voltaire and an  Encyclopaedia. The clergy both showed and excited a mutinous spirit. The  Assembly, by way of retort, decreed that all ecclesiastics should take  the oath of allegiance to the civil constitution of the clergy, on pain  of forfeiture of their benefices. Five-sixths of the clergy refused, and  the result was an outbreak of religious fury in the great towns of the  south and elsewhere, which recalled the violence of the sixteenth  century and the Reformation.    Thus when the Constituent Assembly ceased from its labours, the popular  party had to face the mocking and defiant privileged classes; the  magistracy, whose craft and calling were gone; and the clergy and as  many of the flocks as shared the holy vindictiveness of their pastors.  Immense material improvements had been made, but who was to guard them  against all these powerful and exasperated bands? No chamber could  execute so portentous an office, least of all a chamber that was bound  to work in accord with a King, who at the very moment when he was  swearing fidelity to the new order of things, was sending entreaties to  the King of Prussia and to the Emperor, his brother-in-law, to overthrow  the new order and bring back the old. If the Revolution had achieved  priceless gains for France, they could only be preserved on condition  that public action was directed by those who valued these gains for  themselves and for their children above all things else--above the  monarchy, above the constitution, above peace, above their own sorry  lives. There was only one party who showed this passionate devotion,  this fanatical resolution not to suffer the work that had been done to  be undone, and never to allow France to sink back from exalted national  life into the lethargy of national death. That party was the Jacobins,  and, above all, the austere and rigorous Jacobins of Paris. On their  ascendancy depended the triumph of the Revolution, and on the triumph of  the Revolution depended the salvation of France. Their ascendancy meant  a Jacobin dictatorship, and against this, as against dictatorship in all  its forms, many things have been said, and truly said. But the one most  important thing that can be said about Jacobin dictatorship is that, in  spite of all the dolorous mishaps and hateful misdeeds that marked its  course, it was still the only instrument capable of concentrating and  utilising the dispersed social energy of the French people. The crisis  was not a crisis of logic but of force, and the Jacobins alone  understood, as the old Covenanters had understood, that problems of  force are not solved by phrases, but by mastery and the sword.    The great popular club of Paris was the centre of all those who looked  at events in this spirit. The Legislative Assembly, the successor of the  Constituent, met in the month of October 1791. Like its predecessor, the  Legislative contained a host of excellent and patriotic men, and they at  once applied themselves to the all-important task, which the Constituent  had left so deplorably incomplete, of finally breaking down the old  feudal rights. The most important group in the new chamber were the  deputies from the Gironde. Events soon revealed violent dissents between  the Girondins and the Jacobins, but, for some months after the meeting  of the Legislative, Girondins and Jacobins represented together in  unbroken unity the great popular party. From this time until the fall of  the monarchy, the whole of this popular party in all its branches found  their rallying-place, not in the Assembly, but in the Jacobin Club; and  the ascendancy of the Jacobin Club embodied the dictatorship of Paris.  It was only from Paris that the whole circle of events could be  commanded. When the peasants had got what they wanted, that is to say  the emancipation of the land, they were ready to think that the  Revolution was in safety and at an end. They "]]]
