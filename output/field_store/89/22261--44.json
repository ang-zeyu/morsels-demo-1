In  fact, either of the above-named processes, incorrect for the ordinary  astronomical, would be correct for the Herschelian Telescope. The latter  inverts but does not reverse right and left; therefore after inverting  our picture we must interchange right and left because they have been  reversed by the inversion. This is effected either by looking at the  picture from behind, or by holding it up to a mirror.    [Illustration: PLATE II.]          CHAPTER II.    A HALF-HOUR WITH ORION, LEPUS TAURUS, ETC.      Any of the half-hours here assigned to the constellation-seasons may be  taken first, and the rest in seasonal or cyclic order. The following  introductory remarks are applicable to each:--    If we stand on an open space, on any clear night, we see above us the  celestial dome spangled with stars, apparently fixed in position. But  after a little time it becomes clear that these orbs are slowly shifting  their position. Those near the eastern horizon are rising, those near  the western setting. Careful and continuous observation would show that  the stars are all moving in the same way, precisely, as they would if  they were fixed to the concave surface of a vast hollow sphere, and this  sphere rotated about an axis. This axis, in our latitude, is inclined  about 51-1/2 deg. to the horizon. Of course only one end of this imaginary  axis can be above our horizon. This end lies very near a star which it  will be well for us to become acquainted with at the beginning of our  operations. It lies almost exactly towards the north, and is raised from  50 deg. to 53 deg. (according to the season and hour) above the horizon. There  is an easy method of finding it.    We must first find the Greater Bear. It will be seen from Plate 1, that  on a spring evening the seven conspicuous stars of this constellation  are to be looked for towards the north-east, about half way between the  horizon and the point overhead (or _zenith_), the length of the set of  stars being vertical. On a summer's evening the Great Bear is nearly  overhead. On an autumn evening he is towards the north-west, the length  of the set of seven being somewhat inclined to the horizon. Finally, on  a winter's evening, he is low down towards the north, the length of the  set of seven stars being nearly in a horizontal direction.    Having found the seven stars, we make use of the pointers [alpha] and  [beta] (shown in Plate 1) to indicate the place of the Pole-star, whose  distance from the pointer [alpha] is rather more than three times the  distance of [alpha] from [beta].    Now stand facing the Pole-star. Then all the stars are travelling round  that star _in a direction contrary to that in which the hands of a watch  move_. Thus the stars below the pole are moving _towards the right_,  those above the pole _towards the left_, those to the right of the pole  _upwards_, those to the left of the pole _downwards_.    Next face the south. Then all the stars on our left, that is, towards  the east, are rising slantingly towards the south; those due south are  moving horizontally to the right, that is, towards the west; and those  on our right are passing slantingly downwards towards the west.    It is important to familiarise ourselves with these motions, because it  is through them that objects pass out of the field of view of the  telescope, and by moving the tube in a proper direction we can easily  pick up an object that has thus passed away, whereas if we are not  familiar with the varying motions in different parts of the celestial  sphere, we may fail in the attempt to immediately recover an object, and  waste time in the search for it.    The consideration of the celestial motions shows how advantageous it is,  when using an alt-azimuth, to observe objects as nearly as possible due  south. Of course in many cases this is impracticable, because a  phenomenon we wish to watch may occur when an object is not situated  near the meridian. But in examining double stars there is in general no  reason for selecting objects inconveniently situated. We can wait till  they come round to the meridian, and then observe them more comfortably.  Besides, most objects are higher, and therefore better seen, when due  south.    Northern objects, and especially those within the circle of perpetual  apparition, often culminate (that is, cross the meridian, or north and  south line) at too great a height for comfortable vision. In this case  we should observe them towards the east or west, and remember that in  the first case they are rising, and in the latter they are setting, and  that in both cases they have also a motion from left to right.    If we allow an object to pass right across the field of view (the  telescope being fixed), the apparent direction of its motion is the  exact reverse of the true direction of the star's motion. This will  serve as a guide in shifting the alt-azimuth after a star has passed out  of the field of view.    The following technical terms must be explained. That part of the field  of view towards which the star appears to move is called the _preceding_  part of the field, the opposite being termed the _following_ part. The  motion for all stars, except those lying in an oval space extending from  the zenith to the pole of the heavens, is more or less from right to  left (in the inverted field). Now, if we suppose a star to move along a  diameter of the field so as to divide the field into two semicircles,  then in all cases in which this motion takes places from right to left,  that semicircle which contains the lowest point (apparently) of the  field is the _northern_ half, the other is the _southern_ half. Over the  oval space just mentioned the reverse holds.    Thus the field is divided into four quadrants, and these are termed  _north following_ (_n.f._) and _south following_ (_s.f._); _north  preceding_ (_n.p._), and _south preceding_ (_s.p._). The student can  have no difficulty in interpreting these terms, since he knows which is  the following and which the preceding _semicircle_, which the northern  and which the southern. In the figures of plates 3 and 5, the letters  _n.f._, _n.p._, &c., are affixed to the proper quadrants. It is to be  remembered that the quadrants thus indicated are measured either way  from the point and feather of the diametral arrows.    Next, of the apparent annual motion of the stars. This takes place in  exactly the same manner as the daily motion. If we view the sky at eight  o'clock on any day, and again at the same hour one month later, we shall  find that at the latter observation (as compared with the former) the  heavens appear to have rotated by the _twelfth part_ of a complete  circumference, and the appearance presented is precisely the same as we  should have observed had we waited for two hours (the _twelfth part_ of  a day) on the day of the first observation.           *       *       *       *       *    Our survey of the heavens is supposed to be commenced during the first  quarter of the year, at ten o'clock on the 20th of January, or at nine  on the 5th of February, or at eight on the 19th of February, or at seven  on the 6th of March, or at hours intermediate to these on intermediate  days.    We look first for the Great Bear towards the north-east, as already  described, and thence find the Pole-star; turning towards which we see,  towards the right and downwards, the two guardians of the pole ([beta]  and [gamma] Ursae Minoris). Immediately under the Pole-star is the  Dragon's Head, a conspicuous diamond of stars. Just on the horizon is  Vega, scintillating brilliantly. Overhead is the brilliant Capella, near  which the Milky Way is seen passing down to the horizon on either side  towards the quarters S.S.E. and N.N.W.    For the present our business is with the southern heavens, however.    Facing the south, we see a brilliant array of stars, Sirius  unmistakeably overshining the rest. Orion is shining in full glory, his  leading brilliant, Betelgeuse[2] being almost exactly on the meridian,  and also almost exactly half way between the horizon and the zenith. In  Plate 2 is given a map of this constellation and its neighbourhood.    Let us first turn the tube on Sirius. It is easy to get him in the field  without the aid of a finder. The search will serve to illustrate a  method often useful when a telescope has no finder. Having taking out  the eye-piece--a low-power one, suppose--direct the tube nearly towards  Sirius. On looking through it, a glare of light will be seen within the  tube. Now, if the tube be slightly moved about, the light will be seen  to wax and wane, according as the tube is more or less accurately  directed. Following these indications, it will be found easy to direct  the tube, so that the object-glass shall appear _full of light_. When  this is done, insert the eye-piece, and the star will be seen in the  field.    But the telescope is out of focus, therefore we must turn the small  focussing screw. Observe the charming chromatic changes--green, and  red, and blue light, purer than the hues of the rainbow, scintillating  and coruscating with wonderful brilliancy. As we get the focus, the  excursions of these light flashes diminish until--if the weather is  favourable--the star is seen, still scintillating, and much brighter  than to the naked eye, but reduced to a small disc of light, surrounded  (in the case of so bright a star as Sirius) with a slight glare. If  after obtaining the focus the focussing rack work be still turned, we  see a coruscating image as before. In the case of a very brilliant star  these coruscations are so charming that we may be excused for calling  the observer's attention to them. The subject is not without interest  and difficulty as an optical one.

This thought  consoled me immediately, and though I was only six years old at  the time, I said to myself: \"I will pray for my poor old man on  the day of my First Communion.\" Five years later I faithfully kept  my resolution. I have always thought that my childish prayer for  this suffering member of Christ has been blessed and rewarded.    As I grew older my love of God grew more and more. I often offered  my heart to Him, using the words my Mother had taught me, and I  tried very hard to please Him in all my actions, taking great care  never to offend Him. And yet one day I committed a fault which I  must tell you here--it gives me a good opportunity of humbling  myself, though I believe I have grieved over it with perfect  contrition.    It was the month of May, 1878. My sisters decided that I was too  small to go to the May devotions every evening, so I stayed at  home with the nurse and said my prayers with her before the little  altar which I had arranged according to my own taste. Everything  was small--candlesticks, vases, and the rest; two wax vestas were  quite sufficient to light it up properly. Sometimes Victoire, the  maid, gave me some little bits of real candle, but not often.    One evening, when we went to our prayers, I said to her: \"Will you  begin the _Memorare?_ I am going to light the candles.\" She tried  to begin, and then looked at me and burst out laughing. Seeing my  precious vestas burning quickly away, I begged her once more to  say the _Memorare._ Again there was silence, broken only by bursts  of laughter. All my natural good temper deserted me. I got up  feeling dreadfully angry, and, stamping my foot furiously, I cried  out: \"Victoire, you naughty girl!\" She stopped laughing at once,  and looked at me in utter astonishment, then showed me--too  late--the surprise she had in store hidden under her apron--two  pieces of candle. My tears of anger were soon changed into tears  of sorrow; I was very much ashamed and grieved, and made a firm  resolution never to act in such a way again.    Shortly after this I made my first confession.[3] It is a very  sweet memory. Pauline had warned me: \"Therese, darling, it is not  to a man but to God Himself that you are going to tell your sins.\"  I was so persuaded of this that I asked her quite seriously if I  should not tell Father Ducellier that I loved him \"with my whole  heart,\" as it was really God I was going to speak to in his person.    Well instructed as to what I was to do, I entered the  confessional, and turning round to the priest, so as to see him  better, I made my confession and received absolution in a spirit  of lively faith--my sister having assured me that at this solemn  moment the tears of the Holy Child Jesus would purify my soul. I  remember well that he exhorted me above all to a tender devotion  towards Our Lady, and I promised to redouble my love for her who  already filled so large a place in my heart. Then I passed him my  Rosary to be blessed, and came out of the Confessional more joyful  and lighthearted than I had ever felt before. It was evening, and  as soon as I got to a street lamp I stopped and took the newly  blessed Rosary out of my pocket, turning it over and over. \"What  are you looking at, Therese, dear?\" asked Pauline. \"I am seeing  what a blessed Rosary looks like.\" This childish answer amused my  sisters very much. I was deeply impressed by the graces I had  received, and wished to go to confession again for all the big  feasts, for these confessions filled me with joy. The feasts! What  precious memories these simple words bring to me. I loved them;  and my sisters knew so well how to explain the mysteries hidden in  each one. Those days of earth became days of Heaven. Above all I  loved the procession of the Blessed Sacrament: what a joy it was  to strew flowers in God's path! But before scattering them on the  ground I threw them high in the air, and was never so happy as  when I saw my rose-leaves touch the sacred Monstrance.    And if the great feasts came but seldom, each week brought one  very dear to my heart, and that was Sunday. What a glorious day!  The Feast of God! The day of rest! First of all the whole family  went to High Mass, and I remember that before the sermon we had to  come down from our places, which were some way from the pulpit,  and find seats in the nave. This was not always easy, but to  little Therese and her Father everyone offered a place. My uncle  was delighted when he saw us come down; he called me his  \"Sunbeam,\" and said that to see the venerable old man leading his  little daughter by the hand was a sight which always filled him  with joy. I never troubled myself if people looked at me, I was  only occupied in listening attentively to the preacher. A sermon  on the Passion of our Blessed Lord was the first I understood, and  it touched me deeply. I was then five and a half, and after that  time I was able to understand and appreciate all instructions. If  St. Teresa was mentioned, my Father would bend down and whisper to  me: \"Listen attentively, little Queen, he is speaking of your holy  patroness.\" I really did listen attentively, but I must own I  looked at Papa more than at the preacher, for I read many things  in his face. Sometimes his eyes were filled with tears which he  strove in vain to keep back; and as he listened to the eternal  truths he seemed no longer of this earth, his soul was absorbed in  the thought of another world. Alas! Many long and sorrowful years  had to pass before Heaven was to be opened to him, and Our Lord  with His Own Divine Hand was to wipe away the bitter tears of His  faithful servant.    To go back to the description of our Sundays. This happy day which  passed so quickly had also its touch of melancholy; my happiness  was full till Compline, but after that a feeling of sadness took  possession of me. I thought of the morrow when one had to begin  again the daily life of work and lessons, and my heart, feeling  like an exile on this earth, longed for the repose of Heaven--the  never ending Sabbath of our true Home. Every Sunday my aunt  invited us in turns to spend the evening with her. I was always  glad when mine came, and it was a pleasure to listen to my uncle's  conversation. His talk was serious, but it interested me, and he  little knew that I paid such attention; but my joy was not unmixed  with fear when he took me on his knee and sang \"Bluebeard\" in his  deep voice.    About eight o'clock Papa would come to fetch me. I remember that I  used to look up at the stars with inexpressible delight. Orion's  belt fascinated me especially, for I saw in it a likeness to the  letter \"T.\" \"Look, Papa,\" I would cry, \"my name is written in  Heaven!\" Then, not wishing to see this dull earth any longer, I  asked him to lead me, and with my head thrown back, I gazed  unweariedly at the starry skies.    I could tell you much about our winter evenings at home. After a  game of draughts my sisters read aloud Dom Gueranger's _Liturgical  Year,_ and then a few pages of some other interesting and  instructive book. While this was going on I established myself on  Papa's knee, and when the reading was done he used to sing  soothing snatches of melody in his beautiful voice, as if to lull  me to sleep, and I would lay my head on his breast while he rocked  me gently to and fro.    Later on we went upstairs for night prayers, and there again my  place was beside my beloved Father, and I had only to look at him  to know how the Saints pray. Pauline put me to bed, and I  invariably asked her: \"Have I been good to-day? Is God pleased  with me? Will the Angels watch over me?\" The answer was always  \"Yes,\" otherwise I should have spent the whole night in tears.  After these questions my sisters kissed me, and little Therese was  left alone in the dark.    I look on it as a real grace that from childhood I was taught to  overcome my fears. Sometimes in the evening Pauline would send me  to fetch something from a distant room; she would take no refusal,  and she was quite right, for otherwise I should have become very  nervous, whereas now it is difficult to frighten me. I wonder  sometimes how my little Mother was able to bring me up with so  much tenderness, and yet without spoiling me, for she did not pass  over the least fault. It is true she never scolded me without  cause, and I knew well she would never change her mind when once a  thing was decided upon.    To this dearly loved sister I confided my most intimate thoughts;  she cleared up all my doubts. One day I expressed surprise that  God does not give an equal amount of glory to all the elect in  Heaven--I was afraid that they would not all be quite happy. She  sent me to fetch Papa's big tumbler, and put it beside my tiny  thimble, then, filling both with water, she asked me which seemed  the fuller. I replied that one was as full as the other--it was  impossible to pour more water into either of them, for they could  not hold it. In this way Pauline made it clear to me that in  Heaven the least of the Blessed does not envy the happiness of the  greatest; and so, by bringing the highest mysteries down to the  level of my understanding, she gave my soul the food it needed.    Joyfully each year I welcomed the prize day. Though I was the only  competitor, justice was none the less strictly observed, and I  never received rewards unless they were well merited. My heart  used to beat with excitement when I heard the decisions, and in  presence of the whole family received prizes from Papa's hands. It  was to me like a picture of the Judgment Day!    Seeing Papa so cheerful, no suspicion"]]]
