It would be a mistake to  conclude too much from experiments of such restricted scope; but they  all agree in showing that if every child were given an equal training,  the differences in these traits would nevertheless be very great.    And although we do not wish to strain the application of these results  too far, we are at least justified in saying that they strongly indicate  that inborn mediocrity can not be made into a high grade of talent by  training. Not every boy has a chance to distinguish himself, even if he  receives a good education.    We are driven back to the same old conclusion, that it is primarily  inborn nature which causes the achievements of men and women to be what  they are. Good environment, opportunity, training, will give good  heredity a chance to express itself; but they can not produce greatness  from bad heredity.    These conclusions are familiar to scientific sociologists, but they have  not yet had the influence on social service and practical attempts at  reform which they deserve. Many popular writers continue to confuse  cause and effect, as for example H. Addington Bruce, who contributed an  article to the _Century Magazine_, not long ago, on \"The Boy Who Goes  Wrong.\" After alleging that the boy who goes wrong does so because he is  not properly brought up, Mr. Bruce quotes with approval the following  passage from Paul Dubois, \"the eminent Swiss physician and philosopher:    \"If you have the happiness to be a well-living man, take care not to  attribute the credit of it to yourself. Remember the favorable  conditions in which you have lived, surrounded by the relatives who  loved you and set you a good example; do not forget the close friends  who have taken you by the hand and led you away from the quagmires of  evil; keep a grateful remembrance for all the teachers who have  influenced you, the kind and intelligent school-master, the devoted  pastor; realize all these multiple influences which have made you what  you are. Then you will remember that such and such a culprit has not in  his sad life met with these favorable conditions; that he had a drunken  father or a foolish mother, and that he has lived without affection,  exposed to all kinds of temptation. You will then take pity upon this  disinherited man, whose mind has been nourished upon malformed mental  images, begetting evil sentiments such as immoderate desire or social  hatred.\"    Mr. Bruce indorses this kind of talk when he concludes, \"The blame for  the boy who goes wrong does not rest with the boy himself, or yet with  his remote ancestors. It rests squarely with the parents who, through  ignorance or neglect, have failed to mold him aright in the plastic days  of childhood.\"    Where is the evidence of the existence of these plastic days of  childhood? If they exist, why do not ordinary brothers become as much  alike as identical twins? How long are we to be asked to believe, on  blind faith, that the child is putty, of which the educator can make  either mediocrity or genius, depending on his skill? What does the  environmentalist _know_ about these \"plastic days\"? If a boy has a  drunken father or foolish mother, does it not suggest that there is  something wrong with his pedigree? With such an ancestry, we do not  expect him to turn out brilliantly, no matter in what home he is brought  up. If a boy has the kind of parents who bring him up well; if he is,  as Dr. Dubois says, surrounded by relatives who love him and set him a  good example, we at once have ground for a suspicion that he comes of a  pretty good family, a stock characterized by a high standard of  intellectuality and morality, and it would surprise us if such a boy did  not turn out well. But he turns out well because what's bred in the bone  will show in him, if it gets any kind of a chance. It is his nature, not  his nurture, that is mainly responsible for his character.          CHAPTER II    MODIFICATION OF THE GERM-PLASM      Every living creature was at some stage of its life nothing more than a  single cell. It is generally known that human beings result from the  union of an egg-cell and a sperm-cell, but it is not so universally  understood that these germ-cells are part of a continuous stream of  germ-plasm which has been in existence ever since the appearance of life  on the globe, and which is destined to continue in existence as long as  life remains on the globe.    The corollaries of this fact are of great importance. Some of them will  be considered in this chapter.    Early investigators tended naturally to look on the germ-cells as a  product of the body. Being supposedly products of the body, it was  natural to think that they would in some measure reproduce the character  of the body which created them; and Darwin elaborated an ingenious  hypothesis to explain how the various characters could be represented in  the germ-cell. The idea held by him, in common with most other thinkers  of his period, is still held more or less unconsciously by those who  have not given particular attention to the subject. Generation is  conceived as a direct chain: the body produces the germ-cell which  produces another body which in turn produces another germ-cell, and so  on.    But a generation ago this idea fell under suspicion. August Weismann,  professor of zooelogy in the University of Freiburg, Germany, made  himself the champion of the new idea, about 1885, and developed it so  effectively that it is now a part of the creed of nearly every  biologist.    Weismann caused a general abandonment of the idea that the germ-cell is  produced by the body in each generation, and popularized the conception  of the germ-cell as a product of a stream of undifferentiated  germ-plasm, not only continuous but (potentially at least) immortal.  The body does not produce the germ-cells, he pointed out; instead, the  germ-cells produce the body.    The basis of this theory can best be understood by a brief consideration  of the reproduction of very simple organisms.    \"Death is the end of life,\" is the belief of many other persons than the  Lotus Eaters. It is commonly supposed that everything which lives must  eventually die. But study of a one-celled animal, an Infusorian, for  example, reveals that when it reaches a certain age it pinches in two,  and each half becomes an Infusorian in all appearance identical with the  original cell. Has the parent cell then died? It may rather be said to  survive, in two parts. Each of these daughter cells will in turn go  through the same process of reproduction by simple fission, and the  process will be continued in their descendants. The Infusorian can be  called potentially immortal, because of this method of reproduction.    The immortality, as Weismann pointed out, is not of the kind attributed  by the Greeks to their gods, who could not die because no wound could  destroy them. On the contrary, the Infusorian is extremely fragile, and  is dying by millions at every instant; but if circumstances are  favorable, it _can_ live on; it is not inevitably doomed to die sooner  or later, as is Man. \"It dies from accident often, from old age never.\"    Now the single-celled Infusorian is in many respects comparable with the  single-celled germ of the higher animals. The analogy has often been  carried too far; yet it remains indisputable that the germ-cells of men  reproduce in the same way--by simple fission--as the Infusorian and  other one-celled animals and plants, and that they are organized on much  the same plan. Given favorable circumstances, the germ-cell should be  expected to be equally immortal. Does it ever find these favorable  circumstances?    The investigations of microscopists indicate that it does--that  evolution has provided it with these favorable circumstances, in the  bodies of the higher animals. Let us recall in outline the early history  of the fertilized germ-cell, the _zygote_ formed by the union of ovum  and spermatozooen. These two unite to form a single cell, which is  essentially the same, physiologically, as other germ-cells. It divides  in two similar cells; these each divide; the resulting cells again  divide, and so the process continues, until the whole body--a fully  developed man,--has been produced by division and redivision of the one  zygote.    But the germ-cell is obviously different from most of the cells that  make up the finished product, the body. The latter are highly  differentiated and specialized for different functions--blood cells,  nerve cells, bone cells, muscle cells, and so on, each a single cell but  each adapted to do a certain work, for which the original,  undifferentiated germ-cell was wholly unfit. It is evident that  differentiation began to take place at some point in the series of  divisions, that is to say, in the development of the embryo.    Th. Boveri, studying the development of a threadworm, made the  interesting discovery that this differentiation began at the first  division. Of the two daughter-cells produced from the zygote, one  continued dividing at a very slow rate, and without showing any  specialization. Its \"line of descent\" produced only germ-cells. The  products of division of the other daughter-cell began to differentiate,  and soon formed all the necessary kinds of cells to make up the body of  the mature worm. In this body, the cells from the first daughter-cell  mentioned were inclosed, still undifferentiated: they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19562"],[0,"Napoleon and the Queen of Prussia (#7)"],[1,"with soft turf, served as pillows to their wounded heads.    \"Oh, how delightful to rest on German soil under a German oak!\" sighed  Schill. \"I should like to lie here all my lifetime, looking up to the  rustling leaves, and dreaming! Amid the stillness surrounding us, it is  almost impossible to believe that we witnessed yesterday such wild  strife and bloodshed. Is all this reality, or have we had merely an  evil, feverish dream?\"    \"Touch your forehead; try to raise your right arm, and you will see that  it is reality,\" said Pueckler, laughing bitterly, \"and if you should have  any doubt, let our young friend read the latest bulletin issued by our  _triumphator_. But will you promise not to interrupt him, nor to be  angry at what we are going to hear?\"    \"I promise you to be perfectly calm, for my weakness compels me to be  so. Read, friend Staps. But, pray, let us have the German translation,  for it would be a violation of the peaceful silence of the forest, and  of the sacredness of the German oak, if we should use here the language  of our enemies.\"    Frederick Staps sat down opposite the officers, on the trunk of a fallen  tree. Drawing a paper from his bosom, he unfolded it, and read as  follows:    \"The battle of Jena has effaced the disgrace of Rossbach, and decided a  campaign in seven days. Since the ninth of October we have proceeded  from victory to victory, and the battles of Jena and Auerstadt have  crowned all. The Prussian army is dispersed--almost annihilated. The  king is wandering about without shelter, and the queen will now regret  with bitter tears that she instigated her husband to this senseless and  unjust war. Admirable was the conduct of our whole army, soul-stirring  the enthusiasm of the brave soldiers for their chieftain and emperor.  When there was any momentary difficulty to overcome, the shout of 'Long  live the emperor!' resounded, animating all souls, and carrying away all  hearts. The emperor saw at the most critical moment of the battle that  the enemy's cavalry threatened the flanks of the infantry. He galloped  up to order new manoeuvres, and the front to be transformed into a  square. At every step he was hailed by shouts of 'Long live the  emperor!' The soldiers of the imperial guard were jealous of all the  other corps who participated in the battle, while they alone were  inactive. Several voices were already heard to shout, 'Forward!' The  emperor turned and asked, 'What is that? He must assuredly be a  beardless youth who wishes to anticipate me as to what I ought to do.  Let him wait until he has commanded in twenty battles; then he may claim  to be my adviser.' The whole guard replied to this rebuke by the  unanimous shout of 'Long live the emperor!' and rushed toward the enemy,  when, at length, the order was given to charge. The results of this  battle are from thirty to forty thousand prisoners, three hundred  field-pieces, and thirty standards. Among the prisoners there are more  than twenty generals. The losses of the Prussian army are very heavy,  amounting to more than twenty thousand killed and wounded. Our losses  are estimated at about twelve hundred killed and three thousand  wounded.\"[6]    [Footnote 6: Fifth bulletin of the Grand Army.]    \"Profound silence ensued when Staps had read the bulletin. The two  officers were still lying on the ground, and their dilated eyes gazing  at the roof of foliage above them.\"    \"And we must quietly listen to that,\" said Schill, after a long pause;  \"and our hearts do not break with grief and rage! heaven does not grow  dark, and earth does not open to swallow up the degraded, in order to  save them compassionately from the sense of their humiliation! These  words will be read by the whole of Europe, and all will know that this  insolent conqueror may dare with impunity to speak in insulting terms of  our queen, the purest and best of women!\"    \"He is the master of the world, and will issue many more bulletins of  this description, and speak in such terms of many more princes and  princesses,\" said Count Pueckler. \"He has the power to do so. He needs  only stretch out his hand, and kingdoms fall to ruins--nations are at  his feet, and cry imploringly: 'Let us be your slaves, and lay your hand  on us as our lord and master!' It is useless to resist him. Let us,  therefore, submit.\"    \"No,\" exclaimed Schill, rising, \"no, let us not submit. When a whole  nation arouses itself, and shakes its lion's mane, there is no hand,  even though it were an iron one, that could hold and subdue it.\"    \"But our nation will not rise again--it has been crushed,\" said Pueckler,  mournfully. \"It is sleeping the sleep of death.\"    \"No, it has not been crushed. No, it will not die!\" exclaimed Schill, in  an outburst of generous rage. \"It is only necessary to instill genuine  vitality into its veins, and to awaken it from its lethargy by  soul-stirring exhortations, as our young friend here encouraged and  strengthened us an hour ago by his noble song. Oh, sing again, friend  Staps! Purify the air--which is still infected by the words of the  imperial bulletin--purify it by another German song, and let the native  oak, which has listened to our disgrace, now hear also manly words.  Sing! and may your voice reach our poor soldiers who are closing their  eyes on the battle-field; and may it breathe the consolation into their  ears, 'You die for Germany, but Germany does not die--she lives, and  will rise again!'\"    \"Yes, I will sing,\" said Frederick Staps, enthusiastically, \"but I wish  that every note issuing from my breast would transform itself into a  sword, and strike around with the storm's resistless fury!\"    \"In that case all of us, and yourself, too, would be the first victims,\"  said Pueckler, with a melancholy smile.    \"Of what consequence are our lives, if they are given up for the  fatherland?\" exclaimed Staps, fervently. \"Oh, believe me, I could, like  Mucius Scaevola, lay my hand on the red-hot iron, and not wince, but  sing jubilant hymns, if I thought that my torture would be useful to my  country. Now, I can only sing, only pray, only weep. But who knows  whether I shall not become one day a modern Mucius Scaevola, a modern  Moeros, and deliver the world from its tyrant?\"    And suddenly raising his voice, with a radiant face, he began to sing:        Frisch auf! Es ruft das Vaterland      Die Maenner in die Schlacht.      Frisch auf! Zu daempfen Trug und Schand!      Heran mit Macht, mit Macht!           Heran und braucht den Maennerleib,           Wozu ihn Gott gebaut:           Zum Schirm der Jungfrau und dem Weib,           Dem Saeugling und der Braut!        Denn ein Tyrann mit Luegenwort      Und Strick und Henkerschwert,      Uebt in dem Vaterlande Mord,      Und schaendet Thron und Heerd,          Und will, so weit die Sonne scheint          Der einz'ge Koenig sein;          Ein Menschenfeind, ein Freiheitsfeind,          Spricht er: die Welt ist mein!        Verhuet' es Gott und Hermann's Blut!      Nie werde solches wahr!      Erwache, alter deutscher Muth,      Der Recht und Licht gebar!          Erwache! sonder Rast und Ruh,          Schlag' Jeden der dir droht,          Und ruf' ihm deutsche Losung zu:          \"Sieg gelt' es, oder Tod!\"[7]    [Footnote 7: \"Victory or death!\" A very popular hymn of that period.]    \"Victory or death!\" shouted the two officers, raising their hands and  eyes toward heaven.    \"When will the Germans sing and act in this manner?\" asked Count  Pueckler, sadly.    \"When we have awakened them!\" exclaimed Schill, joyfully. \"For that is  now our only task: to arouse the Germans, and to remind them of their  duty and honor. Every one ought to raise his voice for this purpose, and  toil for it. The time is past when the nation was separated from the  army, and when the civilian hated the soldier. All these separate  interests we buried yesterday on the battle-fields of Jena and  Auerstadt. Heaven permitted our army to be defeated for the purpose of  teaching us that its heart was demoralized and its vitality entirely  gone. But Bonaparte, who believes his successes to be due solely to his  own energy and sagacity, is, after all, nothing but the scourge that God  uses to chastise us. And, after chastising us sufficiently, the scourge  will be cast aside, and lie on the ground, trampled under foot and  despised, while we shall rise and become again a glorious nation. But,  in order to bring about this change, it is necessary to arouse the  Prussians, and fan the flames of their patriotism. Every Prussian must  feel and know that he is a soldier of the grand army which we shall one  day place in the field against the so-called grand army of Napoleon,  and, when the call of 'Rally round the flag!' resounds, he must take up  the sword, and proudly feel that the holy vengeance of the fatherland is  placed in his hands.\"    \"But suppose there is no one to utter the cry of 'Rally round the flag!'  how are the people to appear and take up arms?\"    \"_We_ are there, and _we_ shall exhort the people to arms!\" said Schill,  energetically. \"Henceforth, we must not wait until the generals call us;  we ourselves must be generals, and organize armies--every one after his  own fashion--according to his influence. We must travel over the  country, and enlist recruits. As we have no standing army, we must form  independent corps, and, by means of raids, harass and molest the enemy.  The strongest lion succumbs when stung by many bees. Every Prussian must  turn conspirator, and prevail on his neighbor to join the great  conspiracy; secret leagues and clubs must be instituted everywhere, and  work and agitate until we are united like _one_ man, and, with the  resistless power of our holy wrath, expel the tyrant who enslaves us!\"    \"Yes, you are right; we must not give way to timid despondency, but hope  and dare every thing. Every one must become a general, and enlist  troops, to"]]]
