Next day when they had sent the threefold wave of greeting to Father by  the Green Dragon, and the old gentleman had waved back as usual, Peter  proudly led the way to the station.    \"But ought we?\" said Bobbie.    \"After the coals, she means,\" Phyllis explained.    \"I met the Station Master yesterday,\" said Peter, in an offhand way,  and he pretended not to hear what Phyllis had said; \"he expresspecially  invited us to go down any time we liked.\"    \"After the coals?\" repeated Phyllis. \"Stop a minute--my bootlace is  undone again.\"    \"It always IS undone again,\" said Peter, \"and the Station Master was  more of a gentleman than you'll ever be, Phil--throwing coal at a chap's  head like that.\"    Phyllis did up her bootlace and went on in silence, but her shoulders  shook, and presently a fat tear fell off her nose and splashed on the  metal of the railway line. Bobbie saw it.    \"Why, what's the matter, darling?\" she said, stopping short and putting  her arm round the heaving shoulders.    \"He called me un-un-ungentlemanly,\" sobbed Phyllis. \"I didn't never call  him unladylike, not even when he tied my Clorinda to the firewood bundle  and burned her at the stake for a martyr.\"    Peter had indeed perpetrated this outrage a year or two before.    \"Well, you began, you know,\" said Bobbie, honestly, \"about coals and all  that. Don't you think you'd better both unsay everything since the wave,  and let honour be satisfied?\"    \"I will if Peter will,\" said Phyllis, sniffling.    \"All right,\" said Peter; \"honour is satisfied. Here, use my hankie,  Phil, for goodness' sake, if you've lost yours as usual. I wonder what  you do with them.\"    \"You had my last one,\" said Phyllis, indignantly, \"to tie up the  rabbit-hutch door with. But you're very ungrateful. It's quite right  what it says in the poetry book about sharper than a serpent it is to  have a toothless child--but it means ungrateful when it says toothless.  Miss Lowe told me so.\"    \"All right,\" said Peter, impatiently, \"I'm sorry. THERE! Now will you  come on?\"    They reached the station and spent a joyous two hours with the Porter.  He was a worthy man and seemed never tired of answering the questions  that begin with \"Why--\" which many people in higher ranks of life often  seem weary of.    He told them many things that they had not known before--as, for  instance, that the things that hook carriages together are called  couplings, and that the pipes like great serpents that hang over the  couplings are meant to stop the train with.    \"If you could get a holt of one o' them when the train is going and pull  'em apart,\" said he, \"she'd stop dead off with a jerk.\"    \"Who's she?\" said Phyllis.    \"The train, of course,\" said the Porter. After that the train was never  again 'It' to the children.    \"And you know the thing in the carriages where it says on it, 'Five  pounds' fine for improper use.' If you was to improperly use that, the  train 'ud stop.\"    \"And if you used it properly?\" said Roberta.    \"It 'ud stop just the same, I suppose,\" said he, \"but it isn't proper  use unless you're being murdered. There was an old lady once--someone  kidded her on it was a refreshment-room bell, and she used it improper,  not being in danger of her life, though hungry, and when the train  stopped and the guard came along expecting to find someone weltering in  their last moments, she says, 'Oh, please, Mister, I'll take a glass of  stout and a bath bun,' she says. And the train was seven minutes behind  her time as it was.\"    \"What did the guard say to the old lady?\"    \"_I_ dunno,\" replied the Porter, \"but I lay she didn't forget it in a  hurry, whatever it was.\"    In such delightful conversation the time went by all too quickly.    The Station Master came out once or twice from that sacred inner temple  behind the place where the hole is that they sell you tickets through,  and was most jolly with them all.    \"Just as if coal had never been discovered,\" Phyllis whispered to her  sister.    He gave them each an orange, and promised to take them up into the  signal-box one of these days, when he wasn't so busy.    Several trains went through the station, and Peter noticed for the first  time that engines have numbers on them, like cabs.    \"Yes,\" said the Porter, \"I knowed a young gent as used to take down the  numbers of every single one he seed; in a green note-book with silver  corners it was, owing to his father being very well-to-do in the  wholesale stationery.\"    Peter felt that he could take down numbers, too, even if he was not  the son of a wholesale stationer. As he did not happen to have a green  leather note-book with silver corners, the Porter gave him a yellow  envelope and on it he noted:--         379       663    and felt that this was the beginning of what would be a most interesting  collection.    That night at tea he asked Mother if she had a green leather note-book  with silver corners. She had not; but when she heard what he wanted it  for she gave him a little black one.    \"It has a few pages torn out,\" said she; \"but it will hold quite a lot  of numbers, and when it's full I'll give you another. I'm so glad you  like the railway. Only, please, you mustn't walk on the line.\"    \"Not if we face the way the train's coming?\" asked Peter, after a gloomy  pause, in which glances of despair were exchanged.    \"No--really not,\" said Mother.    Then Phyllis said, \"Mother, didn't YOU ever walk on the railway lines  when you were little?\"    Mother was an honest and honourable Mother, so she had to say, \"Yes.\"    \"Well, then,\" said Phyllis.    \"But, darlings, you don't know how fond I am of you. What should I do if  you got hurt?\"    \"Are you fonder of us than Granny was of you when you were little?\"  Phyllis asked. Bobbie made signs to her to stop, but Phyllis never did  see signs, no matter how plain they might be.    Mother did not answer for a minute. She got up to put more water in the  teapot.    \"No one,\" she said at last, \"ever loved anyone more than my mother loved  me.\"    Then she was quiet again, and Bobbie kicked Phyllis hard under the  table, because Bobbie understood a little bit the thoughts that were  making Mother so quiet--the thoughts of the time when Mother was a  little girl and was all the world to HER mother. It seems so easy and  natural to run to Mother when one is in trouble. Bobbie understood a  little how people do not leave off running to their mothers when they  are in trouble even when they are grown up, and she thought she knew a  little what it must be to be sad, and have no mother to run to any more.    So she kicked Phyllis, who said:--    \"What are you kicking me like that for, Bob?\"    And then Mother laughed a little and sighed and said:--    \"Very well, then. Only let me be sure you do know which way the trains  come--and don't walk on the line near the tunnel or near corners.\"    \"Trains keep to the left like carriages,\" said Peter, \"so if we keep to  the right, we're bound to see them coming.\"    \"Very well,\" said Mother, and I dare say you think that she ought not  to have said it. But she remembered about when she was a little girl  herself, and she did say it--and neither her own children nor you nor  any other children in the world could ever understand exactly what it  cost her to do it. Only some few of you, like Bobbie, may understand a  very little bit.    It was the very next day that Mother had to stay in bed because her head  ached so. Her hands were burning hot, and she would not eat anything,  and her throat was very sore.    \"If I was you, Mum,\" said Mrs. Viney, \"I should take and send for the  doctor. There's a lot of catchy complaints a-going about just now. My  sister's eldest--she took a chill and it went to her inside, two years  ago come Christmas, and she's never been the same gell since.\"    Mother wouldn't at first, but in the evening she felt so much worse that  Peter was sent to the house in the village that had three laburnum trees  by the gate, and on the gate a brass plate with W. W. Forrest, M.D., on  it.    W. W. Forrest, M.D., came at once. He talked to Peter on the way back.  He seemed a most charming and sensible man, interested in railways, and  rabbits, and really important things.    When he had seen Mother, he said it was influenza.    \"Now, Lady Grave-airs,\" he said in the hall to Bobbie, \"I suppose you'll  want to be head-nurse.\"    \"Of course,\" said she.    \"Well, then, I'll send down some medicine. Keep up a good fire. Have  some strong beef tea made ready to give her as soon as the fever goes  down. She can have grapes now, and beef essence--and soda-water and  milk, and you'd better get in a bottle of brandy. The best brandy. Cheap  brandy is worse than poison.\"    She asked him to write it all down, and he did.    When Bobbie showed Mother the list he had written, Mother laughed. It  WAS a laugh, Bobbie decided, though it was rather odd and feeble.    \"Nonsense,\" said Mother, laying in bed with eyes as bright as beads.  \"I can't afford all that rubbish. Tell Mrs. Viney to boil two pounds of  scrag-end of the neck for your dinners to-morrow, and I can have some  of the broth. Yes, I should like some more water now, love. And will you  get a basin and sponge my hands?\"    Roberta obeyed. When she had done everything she could to make Mother  less uncomfortable, she went down to the others. Her cheeks were very  red, her lips set tight, and her eyes almost as bright as Mother's.    She told them what the Doctor had said, and what Mother had said.    \"And now,\" said she, when she had told all, \"there's no one but us to do  anything, and we've got to do it. I've got the shilling for the mutton.\"    \"We can do without the beastly mutton,\" said Peter; \"bread and butter  will support life. People have lived on less on desert islands many a  time.\"    \"Of course,\" said his sister. And Mrs."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18751"],[0,"A Text-book of Assaying: For the Use of Those Connected with Mines. (#7)"],[1," but for that excess would exist in combination as  complex fusible silicates. There are many minerals which with but little  soda form a glass, but with more yield a lumpy scoriacious mass. There  are many minerals, too, which are already basic (for example, calcite),  and which, when present, demand either a less basic or an acid flux  according to the proportions in which they exist. For purposes of this  kind borax, or glass, or clay with more or less soda may be used, and of  these borax is by far the most generally useful. An objection to too  basic a slag (and a very important one) is the speed with which it  corrodes ordinary crucibles. These crucibles, consisting of quartz and  clay, are rapidly attacked by lime, soda and bases generally.    [Illustration: FIG. 4.]    In considering what is and what is not a good slag, certain chemical  properties are of importance. If a mixture of many substances be fused  and allowed to solidify in a crucible, there will be found some or all  of the following. At the bottom of the crucible (fig. 4) a button of  metal, resting on this a speise; then a regulus, next a slag made up of  silicates and borates and metallic oxides, and lastly, on the top  another layer of slag, mainly made up of fusible chlorides and  sulphates. In assaying operations the object is generally to concentrate  the metal sought for in a button of metal, speise or regulus, and to  leave the earthy and other impurities as far as possible in the slag;  whether there be one or two layers of slag is a matter of  indifference;[3] but the chemical action of the lower layer upon the  speise, or regulus, or metal, is of great importance.    A _regulus_ is a compound of one or more of the metals with sulphur; it  is usually brittle, often crystalline, and of a dull somewhat greasy  lustre. It is essential that the slag, when solid, shall be so much more  brittle than the regulus, that it shall be easy to crumble, and remove  it without breaking the latter; and it must not be basic. The effect of  fusing a regulus with a basic slag is well seen when _sulphide of lead_  is fused with _carbonate of soda_; the result is a button of metal (more  or less pure), and a slag containing sulphides of lead and sodium; and  again, if sulphide of lead be fused with an excess of oxide of lead, a  button of lead will be got, and a slag which is simply oxide of lead  (with whatever it may have taken up from the crucible), or if a  sufficient excess has not been used, oxide of lead mixed with some  sulphide. When (as is most frequently the case) the desire is to prevent  the formation of regulus, these reactions may be taken advantage of, but  otherwise the use of a flux having any such tendency must be avoided. A  good slag (from which a regulus may be easily separated) may be obtained  by fusing, say, 20 grams of ore with borax 15 grams, powdered glass 15  grams, fluor spar, 20 grams, and lime 20 grams; by quenching the slag in  water as soon as it has solidified, it is rendered very brittle.    Sulphide of iron formed during an assay will remain diffused through  the slag, instead of fusing into a button of regulus, if the slag  contain sulphide of sodium. The same is true of other sulphides if not  present in too great a quantity, and if the temperature is not too high.    _Speises_ are compounds of a metal or metals with arsenic. They are  chiefly of interest in the metallurgy of nickel, cobalt, and tin. They  are formed by heating the metal or ore in covered crucibles with arsenic  and, if necessary, a reducing agent. The product is fused with more  arsenic under a slag, consisting mainly of borax. They are very fusible,  brittle compounds. On exposure to the air at a red heat the arsenic and  the metal simultaneously oxidize. When iron, cobalt, nickel, and copper  are present in the same speise, they are eliminated in the order  mentioned.    _Slags_ from which metals are to be separated should not be too acid; at  least, in those cases in which the metal is to be reduced from a  compound, as well as separated from earthy impurities. Where the object  is simply to get a button of metal from a substance in which it is  already in the metallic state, but mixed with dross (made up of metallic  oxides, such as those of zinc or iron), from which it is desired to  separate it, an acid flux like borax is best; or, if the metal is easily  fusible, and there would be danger of loss of metal by oxidation or  volatilising, it may be melted under a layer of resin or fat. Common  salt is sometimes used with a similar object, and is often useful. Under  certain conditions, however, it has a tendency to cause the formation of  volatile chlorides with a consequent loss of metal.    In the great majority of cases, the fusion of the metal is accompanied  by reduction from the state of oxide; in these the slag should be basic.  It is not easy to reduce the whole of a reducible oxide (say oxide of  copper or of iron) from a slag in which it exists as a borate or  silicate; there should be at least enough soda present to liberate it.  When the object is to separate one metal, say copper, without reducing  an unnecessary amount of another (iron) at the same time, a slag with a  good deal of borax is a distinct advantage. The slag then will probably  not be free from copper, so that it will be necessary to powder and mix  the slag with some soda and a reducing agent, and to again fuse the slag  in order to separate this residual metal. In all those cases in which  the slag retains an oxide of a heavy metal, this cleaning of the slag is  advisable, and in the case of rich ores necessary. Slags containing  sulphides are especially apt to retain the more easily reducible metals.    The following are the ordinary and most useful fluxes:--    ~Soda.~--The powdered bicarbonate, sold by druggists as \"carbonate of  soda,\" is generally used. It gives off its water and excess of carbonic  acid readily and without fusion. Where the melting down is performed  rapidly, the escaping gas is apt to cause trouble by frothing, and so  causing waste of the material. Ordinary carbonate of soda, when hydrated  (soda crystals), melts easily, and gives off its water with ebullition.  It is unfit for use in assaying, but when dried it can be used instead  of the bicarbonate. One part of the dried carbonate is equivalent to  rather more than one and a half parts of the bicarbonate. From two to  four parts of the flux are amply sufficient to yield a fluid slag with  one part of earthy matter. This statement is also true of the fluxes  which follow.    ~Borax~ is a hydrated biborate of soda, containing nearly half its  weight of water. When heated it swells up, loses its water, and fuses  into a glass. The swelling up may become a source of loss in the assay  by pushing some of the contents out of the crucible. To avoid this,  _fused_ or _dried borax_ may be used, in which case a little more than  half the amount of borax indicated will suffice. Borax will flux almost  anything, but it is especially valuable in fluxing lime, &c., and  metallic oxides; as also in those cases in which it is desired to keep  certain of the latter in the slag and out of the button of metal.    ~Oxide of Lead~, in the form of red lead or litharge, is a valuable  flux; it easily dissolves those metallic oxides which are either  infusible or difficultly fusible of themselves, such as oxides of iron  or copper. The resulting slag is strongly basic and very corrosive; no  crucible will long withstand the attack of a fused mixture of oxides of  lead and copper. With silicates, also, it forms very fusible double  silicates; but in the absence of silicates and borates it has no action  upon lime or magnesia. Whether the lead be added as litharge or as red  lead, it will exist in the slag as monoxide (litharge); the excess of  oxygen of the red lead is thus available for oxidising purposes. If this  oxidising power is prejudicial, it may be neutralised by mixing the red  lead with 1 per cent. of charcoal.    ~Glass~: broken beakers and flasks, cleaned, dried, and powdered will  do. It should be free from lead.    ~Fluor~: fluor-spar as free as possible from other minerals, powdered.  It helps to flux phosphate of lime, &c., and infusible silicates.    ~Lime~: should be fresh and powdered. It must not be slaked. Powdered  white marble (carbonate of lime) will do; but nearly double the quantity  must be taken. One part of lime produces the same effect as 1.8 parts of  the carbonate of lime.    ~Tartar~ and \"black flux,\" are reducing agents as well as fluxes. The  \"black flux,\" which may be obtained by heating tartar, is a mixture of  carbonate of potash and charcoal.    REDUCING AGENTS.--The distinction between reducing agents and fluxes  (too often ignored) is an important one. Fluxes yield slags; reducing  agents give buttons of regulus or of metal. The action of a reducing  agent is the separation of the oxygen or sulphur from the metal with  which it is combined. For example, the mineral anglesite (lead sulphate)  is a compound of lead, sulphur, and oxygen; by carefully heating it with  charcoal the oxygen is taken away by the charcoal, and a regulus of lead  sulphide remains. If the regulus be then fused with metallic iron the  sulphur is removed by the iron, and metallic lead is left. The charcoal  and the iron are reducing agents. But in defining a reducing agent as  one which removes oxygen, or sulphur, from a metallic compound so as to  set the metal free, it must be remembered that sulphur itself will  reduce metallic lead from fused litharge, and that oxygen will similarly  set free the metal in fused lead sulphide. There is no impropriety in  describing sulphur as a reducing agent; but it is absurd to call oxygen  one. Some confusion will be avoided if these substances and those which  are opposite to them in property be classed as oxidising and  de-oxidising, sulphurising, and de-"]]]
