[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18222"],[0,"The Religion of Numa (#7)"],[1,"was subsequently  built, for it is an almost invariable rule that the earliest temples are  built on the actual site of, or close to, the old altar or shrine which  preceded the formal temple. Like Hercules therefore he was received  inside the _pomerium_, and probably for a similar reason, because it was  felt that he was a god of Tusculum, and hence a god of Rome's kinsfolk.  We have an additional confirmation of this feeling in the way in which  the later direct cult of Castor was treated. This cult, connecting  Castor with healing and the interpretation of dreams, and emphasising  his function as a rescuer from the dangers of the sea, would have been  without meaning for the old Romans who worshipped him merely as a patron  of horsemen and horsemanship. The new ideas seem to have had as their  centre a later temple in the Circus Flaminius and thus Hercules and  Castor may again be paralleled, since they have, each of them, an old  cult-centre inside the _pomerium_, Hercules in the Forum Boarium, Castor  in the Forum, and a later cult-centre, for more advanced ideas, in each  case in the Circus Flaminius.    Although it was Greek influence which ultimately caused the destruction  of Roman religion, and although the cults of Hercules and of Castor are  the first definite effects of this influence, it cannot be said that the  destruction had in any sense begun, because in their slow journey  northward, and in their long residence at Tibur and Tusculum  respectively, the two cults had lost all that was pernicious. The Roman  instinct, which felt them to be akin to itself, did not go amiss; they  were indeed akin to the new Rome with its new interest in trade and its  increased interest in warfare, for the trader and the warrior have gone  side by side in all ages of the world's history, whether it be a  primitive instinct to grasp territory for commercial purposes or a more  civilised endeavour to obtain an open port.    The beginnings of Greek influence have thus been exhibited in the case  of Hercules and of Castor, and it remains to inquire what Etruria did.  There is no race about which we know so much and yet so little as about  the Etruscans. They have always been and still are a riddle, and as our  knowledge of them increases we seem further than ever from a solution,  and what we gain in positive knowledge is more than counterbalanced by  the increased sense of our ignorance. Altogether aside from the problem  of the origin of the Etruscans, and the race to which they belonged, is  the other problem of their disappearance. In a certain sense Etruria  steps out of history quite as mysteriously as she entered into it, nay  even more mysteriously, for we are always willing to allow a certain  percentage of mystery as the legitimate accompaniment of prehistoric  history, but when in the light of more or less historic times a nation  steps off the stage of the world's history, and leaves practically no  heritage behind her, we have a right to be amazed. Of all the peoples in  Italy Rome ought in the order of events to have been her successor, and  yet when we contrast the influence of Etruria on Rome with the influence  of the Greek colonies of Southern Italy we see an amazing difference.  The influence of these Greek colonies on Rome prepared the way for the  direct influence of the Greek motherland, so that one passed over into  the other by imperceptible gradations, but the influence of Etruria on  Rome not only led to nothing but was in itself of a most superficial  sort. Etruria must have had some literature, yet we search the history  of Roman literature in vain for any traces of the influence of that  literature on Rome, with the one exception of books on divination and  the interpretation of lightning. We know too little of her manners and  customs to be able to tell exactly how much they may have influenced  Rome, and yet it is worth noting that the things which Roman writers  actually refer to Etruria, are all of them most superficial: a few of  the insignia of political office; a few of the trappings of one or two  ritualistic acts; a branch of divination, by the consultation of the  entrails (_haruspicina_), which was of secondary importance compared to  augury; and the most depraved form of Roman public sport, the  gladiatorial games. The only fundamental institution of Rome which it is  the habit to ascribe to Etruria, the idea of the so-called _templum_ or  division of the sky into regions as an axiom of augury, seems to have  been quite as much a general Italic idea as a specifically Etruscan one.  Even in art her influence was relatively slight, and though her  architects seem to have built the earliest formal temples for Rome, they  were soon succeeded in this work by the Greeks. We seek in vain for a  complete and satisfactory explanation of this limitation of her  influence, but certain thoughts suggest themselves, which, as far as  they go, are probably correct. All that we know of Etruria impresses us  with the fact that hers was an outward civilisation unaccompanied by an  inward culture, that it was a formal rather than a spiritual growth, an  artificial acquisition from without rather than a development from  within outwards. It was strong but with its strength went brutality, it  was interested in art but for its sensual rather than its spiritual  aspects. Now the idealism of youth is present in nations just as in  individuals, though probably a nation is less conscious of it than an  individual. It is with the nation one of the effects of the instinct of  self-preservation, and for a youthful nation to absorb the vices of an  old decadent one would be self-destruction. Thus the youthful Rome  rejected most of the Etruscan poison, and thus nature purified herself,  and Etruria was buried in the pit of her own nastiness.    There was however one town which acted as an interpreter between Rome  and Etruria, and was the original cult-centre for a very great goddess,  spreading her cult in both directions, into Rome and into Etruria. The  town was Falerii and the goddess was Minerva, who in a certain sense  entered Rome three times, once direct from Falerii to Rome, and once  from Falerii to Rome by way of Etruria, and finally, when Falerii was  captured by the Romans, again direct to Rome. In the earliest period  there are scarcely any traces of the worship of Minerva in Latium or  Southern Italy, and we are absolutely certain that she was not known in  Rome. In the country north of Rome, however, the situation is different  There she is found quite frequently, especially in Etruria under the  name of MENERVA or MENRVA. Yet she cannot have been an Etruscan goddess,  because the name itself is Italic and not Etruscan. She is therefore  neither Roman, nor Etruscan, nor Latin, at least so far as we know Latin  in Latium. If we can find a place however where a Latin people is under  strong Etruscan influence, we shall be near the solution. Such a place  is Falerii, in the country of the Faliscans. To the ancients it appeared  so thoroughly Etruscan that they go out of their way to explain that it  was not. As a matter of fact it was the only Latin town on the right  bank of the Tiber, and because of its locality it was early brought into  vital connection with the Etruscans, so vital that while it never lost  all of its original Latin character, it lost enough of it to exercise a  very considerable direct influence over Etruria, and to be to a very  large extent influenced by her in turn. We cannot of course positively  prove that Minerva was originally worshipped only at Falerii, and that  her cult spread entirely from this one point, but we have at least  strong negative evidence, and so far as the general history of ancient  religion is concerned there is nothing impossible in such a spread.  Religious history shows many parallels to this; for example the classic  case of the god Eros of Thespiae, in Boeotia, who would have lived and  died merely a little insignificant local god, if it had not been for the  Boeotian poet Hesiod who adopted Eros into his poetry and thus gave him  a start in life by which he ultimately succeeded in going all over the  Greek world, and then passing into Rome as Cupid; and so into all later  times.    We are accustomed to think of Minerva as the Latin name for Athena, the  daughter of Zeus, and unconsciously we clothe Minerva with all the glory  of Athena and endow her with Athena's many-sidedness. In reality the  little peasant goddess of Falerii had originally nothing in common with  Athena except the fact that both of them were interested in handicraft  and the handicraftsman, but Athena had a hundred other interests  besides, while this one thing seems to have filled the whole of  Minerva's horizon. When Minerva went on her travels into Etruria, she  came among a people who eventually learned from the representations of  Greek art a very considerable amount of Greek mythology, and who, when  they heard of Athena, saw her resemblance to Minerva and began thus to  associate the two. But even in this association Minerva was still  pre-eminently the goddess of the artisan and the labouring man, she was  the patroness of the works of man's hands rather than of the works of  his mind, and as such she was brought into Rome by Etruscan and  Faliscan workmen. At first she was worshipped merely by these workmen in  their own houses, but by degrees as the number of these workmen  increased and as a knowledge of their handicraft spread to native  Romans, Minerva became so prominent that the state was compelled to  acknowledge her, and to accept her among the gods of the state. But it  was a very different acknowledgment from that of Hercules or Castor;  these gods had been received inside the _pomerium_, but Minerva was  given a temple outside, over on the Aventine. None the less her cult  throve, and her power was soon shown both religiously and socially."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18223"],[0,"The Essence of Buddhism (#7)"],[1,"Romeo and Juliet.    259 King Henry VI.
