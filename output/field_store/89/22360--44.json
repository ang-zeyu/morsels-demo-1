This earthquake was      |                    |     |violent in Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, and      |                    |     |the Mountain Province. It was remarkable      |                    |     |for its duration of nearly one minute.      |                    |     |The resulting damage was negligible.      |                    |     |   94 |1873   VI 11 23 15  |  VI |This earthquake was violent in      |                    |     |northeastern Mindoro and very strong on      |                    |     |Romblon and Marinduque Islands, likewise      |                    |     |in the Province of Batangas.

A very strong earthquake      |                    |     |throughout northern Luzon; that is, in      |                    |     |the provinces north of the 16th parallel      |                    |     |of latitude. Its center appears to have      |                    |     |been near the Ilocos coast.      |                    |     |   98 |1874  VII  8 10 32  |  VI |Central Luzon.

The center lay near      |                    |     |Casiguran Bay. The provinces affected      |                    |     |most were northern Camarines, Tayabas,      |                    |     |Laguna, Rizal, Bulacan, Nueva Ecija,      |                    |     |Nueva Vizcaya, and Isabela.      |                    |     |  101 |1875  III  9  3 30  | VII |Very violent earthquake in Abra and the      |                    |     |Mountain Province.

The duration of this earthquake was      |                    |     |quite unusual.

Next to the waltzes in popularity come the polonaises; and they fully  deserve their popularity. Liszt has given us a charming description of  the polonaise as it was formerly danced in Chopin's native country. It  was less a dance than a promenade in which courtly pomps and  aristocratic splendor were on exhibition. It was a chivalrous but not  an amorous dance, precedence being given to age and rank, before youth  and beauty. And whereas, in other dances, the place of honor is  always given to the fair sex, in the polonaise the men are in the  foreground. In a word, the polonaise represents, both in its subject  and the style of music, the masculine side of Chopin's genius.    The feminine side is chiefly embodied in the mazurkas and the  nocturnes. It has been said that the highest genius must combine  masculine with feminine traits, and it is a remarkable fact that the  works of two of the most spontaneous composers--Chopin and  Schubert--are often characterized by an exquisite feminine tenderness  and grace; as if, seeing that women have not done their duty as  composers, they had tried to introduce the feminine spirit in music.  Yet it is unfair to place too much emphasis on this side of their  genius. In their bolder moments, Chopin and Schubert are thoroughly  masculine.    It seems strange at first sight that the mazurkas, these exquisite  love poems, should be so much less popular than the waltzes, for they  are quite as melodious and much easier--although here, as elsewhere,  Chopin often introduces a few very difficult bars in an otherwise easy  composition, as if to keep away bunglers. Perhaps the cause of their  comparative neglect is, that they are so thoroughly Polish in spirit;  unless they are played with an exotic _rubato_, their fragrance  vanishes. There is more local color in the mazurkas than in any of  his other works. The Mazurs are musically a highly gifted nation, and  Chopin was impressed early in life with the quaint originality of  their melodies. No doubt some of his mazurkas are merely artistic  settings of these old love songs, but they are the settings of an  inspired jeweller. If we can judge by the number of pieces of each  class that he wrote, the mazurka was Chopin's favorite form. Even on  his death-bed he wrote one. It was his last effort, and he was too  weak to try it over on the piano. It is of heart-rending sadness, and  exquisite pathos. Perhaps it was a patriotic rather than an aesthetic  feeling which led him thus to favor the mazurka. His love for his  country was exceeded only by his devotion to his art. \"Oh, how sad it  must be to die in a foreign country,\" he wrote to a friend in 1830;  and when, soon afterward, he left home he took along a handful of  Polish soil which he kept for nineteen years. Shortly before his death  he expressed a wish that it should be strewn in his coffin--a wish  which was fulfilled; so that his body rested on Polish soil even in  Paris.    A countless number of exquisite melodic rhythmic and harmonic details  in the mazurkas might be dwelt upon in this place, but I will only  call attention to the inexhaustible variety of ideas which makes each  of them so unique, notwithstanding their strong family likeness. They  are like fantastic orchids, or like the countless varieties of humming  birds, those \"winged poems of the air,\" of which no two are alike  while all resemble each other.    The nocturnes represent the dreamy side of Chopin's genius. They are  sufficiently popular, yet few amateurs have any idea of their  unfathomable depth, and few know how to use the pedal in such a way as  to produce the rich uninterrupted flow of tone on which the melody  should float. Most pianists play them too fast. Mozart and Schumann  protested against the tendency to take their slow pieces too fast, and  Chopin suffers still more from this pernicious habit. Mendelssohn in  \"A Midsummer Night's Dream,\" and Weber in \"Oberon,\" have given us  glimpses of dreamland, but Chopin's nocturnes take us there bodily,  and plunge us into reveries more delicious than the visions of an  opium eater. They should be played in the twilight and in solitude,  for the slightest foreign sound breaks the spell. But just as dreams  are sometimes agitated and dramatic, so some of these nocturnes are  complete little dramas with stormy, tragic episodes, and the one in C  sharp minor, _e.g._, embodies a greater variety of emotion and more  genuine dramatic spirit on four pages than many popular operas on four  hundred.    One of Chopin's enchanting innovations, which he introduced  frequently in the nocturnes, consists in those unique and exquisite  _fioriture_, or dainty little notes which suddenly descend on the  melody like a spray of dew drops glistening in all the colors of the  rainbow. No less unique and original are the exquisite modulations  into foreign keys which abound in the nocturnes, as, indeed, in all  his works. Schucht calls attention to the fact that in his very opus 1  Chopin permits himself a freedom of modulation which Beethoven rarely  indulged in. But this is a mere trifle compared with the works of his  last period. Here we find a striking originality and boldness of  modulation that has no parallel in music, except in Wagner's last  music-dramas. Now we have seen that Moscheles, and other  contemporaries of Chopin, found his modulations harsh and  disagreeable; and doubtless there are amateurs to-day who regard them  in the same way. It seems, indeed, as if musical people must be  divided into two classes--those who find their chief delight in melody  pure and simple, and those who think that rich and varied harmony is  the soul of music. Chopin fortunately wrote for both classes. Italy  has produced no melodist equal to him, and Germany only one--Franz  Schubert. No one has written melodies more soulful than those of the  nocturne, opus 37, No. 2, the second ballad, the etudes, opus 10, No.  3; opus 25, No. 7, etc. I distinctly remember the thrill with which I  heard each of these melodies for the first time; but it was a deeper  emotion still which I felt when I played for the first time the  sublimest of his nocturnes--the last but one he wrote--and came across  that wonderful modulation from five sharps to four flats, and, later  on, the delicious series of modulations in the fourth and fifth bars  after the Tempo Primo. I realized then that modulation is a deeper  source of emotional expression than melody.    In speaking of Chopin's melancholy character, the nocturnes are often  referred to as illustrations of it. They do, indeed, breathe a spirit  of sadness, but the majority represent, as I have said, the dreamy  side of his genius. The real anguish of his heart is not expressed in  the nocturnes but in the preludes and etudes, strange as these names  may seem for such pathetic effusions of his heart. The etude, opus 10,  No. 6, seems as if it were in a sort of double minor; as much sadder  than ordinary minor, as ordinary minor is sadder than major. Chopin  had abundant cause to be melancholy. He inherited that national  melancholy of the Poles which causes them even to dance to tunes in  minor keys, and which is commonly attributed to the long-continued  political oppression under which they have suffered. But, apart from  this national trait, Chopin had sufficient personal reasons for  writing the greater part of his mazurkas and his other pieces in  minor keys. Like other men of genius, he keenly felt the anguish of  not being fully appreciated by his contemporaries. Moreover, although  he was greatly admired by the French and Polish women in Paris, and  was even conceded a lady-killer, he was, in his genuine affairs of the  heart, thrice disappointed. His first love, who wore his engagement  ring when he left Warsaw, proved faithless to the absent lover, and  married another man. The second love deceived him in the same way,  preferring a Count to a genius. And his third love, George Sand, after  apparently reciprocating his attachment, for a few years, not only  discarded him, but tried to justify her conduct to the world, by  giving an exaggerated portraiture of his weaknesses, in her novel  \"Lucrezia Floriani.\"    Nevertheless, it was in one respect fortunate for the world that  George Sand was Chopin's friend so long, for we owe to her facile pen  many interesting accounts of Chopin's habits and the origin of some of  his compositions. The winter which he spent with her on the Island of  Majorca was one of the most important in his life, for it was here  that he composed some of those masterpieces, his preludes--a word  which might be paraphrased as Introductions to a new world of musical  emotion. There is a strange discrepancy in the accounts which Liszt  and George Sand give of the Majorca episode in Chopin's life. Liszt  describes it as a period of calm enjoyment, George Sand as one of  discomfort and distress. As she was an eye-witness, her testimony  appears the more trustworthy, especially as it is borne out by the  character of the preludes which he composed there. There are among  Chopin's preludes a few which breathe the spirit of contentment and  grace, or of religious grandeur, but most of them are outbreaks of the  wildest anguish and heart-rending pathos. If tears could be heard,  they would sound like these preludes. Two of the saddest--those in B  minor and E minor--were played by the famous organist Lefebure Wely,  at Chopin's funeral services. But it is useless to specify. They are  all jewels of the first water.    Some years ago I wrote in \"The Nation\" that if all pianoforte music in  the world were to be destroyed, excepting one collection, my vote  should be cast for Chopin's preludes. If anything could induce me to  modify that opinion to-day, it would be the thought of Chopin's  etudes. I would never consent to their loss. Louis Ehlert, speaking of  Chopin's F Major"]]]
