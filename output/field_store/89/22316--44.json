They occupy the same    horizontal planes as the original lintels, and the walls are trimmed    to afford solid resting places for them. The openings above the    lintels have been filled in the same manner as the underpinning,    with hard-burned brick set back 1 inch from the wall surfaces and    plastered with a coating of cement mortar, bringing it out flush    with the original wall.      I further find that the contractors have placed one wooden brace and    two iron braces as designated in the specifications. The wooden    brace is constructed of two pieces of good, clear, squared lumber 6    by 8 inches in cross section, well bolted together, secured by    plates of boiler iron three-eighths of an inch thick and 14 by 18    inches square. The specifications provide for this brace to run from    the south side of the south wall through the center room with a    plate on each side of the south wall and one on each side of the    wall on the north side of the center room. The contractors have    deviated from these requirements in having extended the said brace    through the entire length of the building and placed the plates that    were specified for the north wall of the center room on the    respective sides of the extreme north wall of the building. While    this deviation adds nothing to the security of the south wall, it is    doubtless as effective as it would have been had it been placed as    contemplated in the plan. It may in some degree strengthen the north    wall, and I recommend that it be accepted as in compliance with the    terms of the contract. The two iron rods called for in the    specifications are of wrought iron 11/2 inches in diameter, secured by    boiler-iron plates three-eighths of an inch thick and 12 inches in    diameter, securely fastened as required in the specifications. There    was a necessary deviation from the plan as to the place the rod    nearest the east side of the building should be placed. Early in the    prosecution of the work a portion of the debris in contact with the    eastern wall was removed. During the night following this a section    of the south end of the east wall fell, carrying with it that    portion of the wall between the south and east rooms to which the    plan required said rod to be attached. In consequence the    contractors placed the rod so as to connect it with the portion of    the wall still intact. As a brace to the south wall it is placed    advantageously. In excavation, underpinning, and filling in the    contractors have exceeded the limitations prescribed in the    contract, and have therefore performed an amount of work for the    remuneration of which there is no provision. The following table    shows the amount of work authorized in each of the four items with    reference to which the contract was drawn and the amount actually    performed by contractors:     Item                 |1.

They are fully advised that there is no provision for the    payment of this excess. The requirements of the contract are, in my    opinion, fully met in the quality of material used and the work    performed.      The preservation of the ruin is incomplete. There are six places    where lintels have disappeared and not been replaced and a    corresponding number of cavities that should be filled. Deep seams    have been cut in the walls by the action of the elements, and unless    far greater provision is made for its protection the work already    done will be of small avail.      At many places where the debris came in contact with the wall    disintegration seems to have resulted. At a slight touch it    frequently crumbles. Owing to this fact two sections of the wall    fell during the progress of the work when the debris was    removed--one from the east wall, described above, and one from the    south wall near the west extremity. These breaches maybe observed as    shown in two of the six accompanying photographs [plates CXX, CXXI].    These photographs were taken ten days before the work was completed.    There being no professional photographer in that vicinity I was    compelled to take advantage of the kind offer of Mr H. H. Burrell,    an amateur photographer, who happened to be there at that time. Thus    the views I secured failed to show all the brickwork done. The    coating of mortar was not applied until after the date on which the    views were taken, in consequence of which the bare bricks are shown    in the views.      During the progress of work in removing the debris a number of    articles of interest to the ethnologist were found at various depths    and localities. They have been packed by the contractors and will be    sent to the National Museum.      The floors in the center, north, and east rooms were found to be    about 8 feet above the ground surface. The material was similar to    that of which the walls are composed. The west and south rooms    appeared to have had floors at one time on the same level, but the    surfaces had disintegrated, and there was a mass of loose earth,    which was removed to a depth of 6.9 feet below the floors of the    other three rooms, where another floor was found slightly less firm    than those.      Reverend Isaac T. Whittemore, who has been designated by the    honorable the Secretary of the Interior as the custodian of the    ruin, rendered me valuable assistance in the performance of my    mission. He has manifested a zealous concern for the preservation of    the ruin and has given time and labor to that end. There is no    provision for his just compensation. I therefore recommend that if    any funds be found available after the payment of the amount due the    contractors the same be ordered paid to Mr Whittemore for his    services.          Very respectfully,            H. C. Rizer, _Chief Clerk_.

Honorable Hoke Smith,        _Secretary of the Interior_.      Dear Sir: It is with great hesitancy that I write to add to the    burdens of one so busy and burdened as I presume you to be. But it    is not for myself but for others that I write, and will try to be    laconic.      Can you embody in your next report to Congress an appeal for an    appropriation of $7,000 or $8,00[0] to roof the Casa Grande ruin, to    fence 40 acres, and make excavations of all the mounds in the    vicinity for the purpose of learning the history of the wonderful    people who once lived here and erected the buildings and built    canals?        *   *   *   *   *    Very sincerely, yours,        Isaac T.

Business was impossible with so unreasonable a ghost.    \"'Certainly, two hundred and forty thousand francs are not be picked up  for the asking,' said M. Poligny, without moving a muscle of his face.  'And have you considered what the loss over Box Five meant to us?  We  did not sell it once; and not only that, but we had to return the  subscription:  why, it's awful!  We really can't work to keep ghosts!  We prefer to go away!'    \"'Yes,' echoed M. Debienne, 'we prefer to go away.  Let us go.'\"    \"And he stood up.  Richard said:  'But, after all all, it seems to me  that you were much too kind to the ghost.  If I had such a troublesome  ghost as that, I should not hesitate to have him arrested.'    \"'But how?  Where?' they cried, in chorus.  'We have never seen him!'    \"'But when he comes to his box?'    \"'WE HAVE NEVER SEEN HIM IN HIS BOX.'    \"'Then sell it.'    \"'Sell the Opera ghost's box!  Well, gentlemen, try it.'    \"Thereupon we all four left the office.  Richard and I had 'never  laughed so much in our lives.'\"        Chapter IV  Box Five      Armand Moncharmin wrote such voluminous Memoirs during the fairly long  period of his co-management that we may well ask if he ever found time  to attend to the affairs of the Opera otherwise than by telling what  went on there.  M. Moncharmin did not know a note of music, but he  called the minister of education and fine arts by his Christian name,  had dabbled a little in society journalism and enjoyed a considerable  private income.  Lastly, he was a charming fellow and showed that he  was not lacking in intelligence, for, as soon as he made up his mind to  be a sleeping partner in the Opera, he selected the best possible  active manager and went straight to Firmin Richard.    Firmin Richard was a very distinguished composer, who had published a  number of successful pieces of all kinds and who liked nearly every  form of music and every sort of musician.  Clearly, therefore, it was  the duty of every sort of musician to like M. Firmin Richard.  The only  things to be said against him were that he was rather masterful in his  ways and endowed with a very hasty temper.    The first few days which the partners spent at the Opera were given  over to the delight of finding themselves the head of so magnificent an  enterprise; and they had forgotten all about that curious, fantastic  story of the ghost, when an incident occurred that proved to them that  the joke--if joke it were--was not over.  M. Firmin Richard reached his  office that morning at eleven o'clock. His secretary, M. Remy, showed  him half a dozen letters which he had not opened because they were  marked \"private.\" One of the letters had at once attracted Richard's  attention not only because the envelope was addressed in red ink, but  because he seemed to have seen the writing before.  He soon remembered  that it was the red handwriting in which the memorandum-book had been  so curiously completed.  He recognized the clumsy childish hand.  He  opened the letter and read:    DEAR MR.  MANAGER:    I am sorry to have to trouble you at a time when you must be so very  busy, renewing important engagements, signing fresh ones and generally  displaying your excellent taste.  I know what you have done for  Carlotta, Sorelli and little Jammes and for a few others whose  admirable qualities of talent or genius you have suspected.    Of course, when I use these words, I do not mean to apply them to La  Carlotta, who sings like a squirt and who ought never to have been  allowed to leave the Ambassadeurs and the Cafe Jacquin; nor to La  Sorelli, who owes her success mainly to the coach-builders; nor to  little Jammes, who dances like a calf in a field.  And I am not  speaking of Christine Daae either, though her genius is certain,  whereas your jealousy prevents her from creating any important part.  When all is said, you are free to conduct your little business as you  think best, are you not?    All the same, I should like to take advantage of the fact that you have  not yet turned Christine Daae out of doors by hearing her this evening  in the part of Siebel, as that of Margarita has been forbidden her  since her triumph of the other evening; and I will ask you not to  dispose of my box to-day nor on the FOLLOWING DAYS, for I can not end  this letter without telling you how disagreeably surprised I have been  once or twice, to hear, on arriving at the Opera, that my box had been  sold, at the box-office, by your orders.    I did not protest, first, because I dislike scandal, and, second,  because I thought that your predecessors, MM. Debienne and Poligny, who  were always charming to me, had neglected, before leaving, to mention  my little fads to you.  I have now received a reply from those  gentlemen to my letter asking for an explanation, and this reply proves  that you know all about my Memorandum-Book and, consequently, that you  are treating me with outrageous contempt.  IF YOU WISH TO LIVE IN  PEACE, YOU MUST NOT BEGIN BY TAKING AWAY MY PRIVATE BOX.    Believe me to be, dear Mr. Manager, without prejudice to these little  observations,            Your Most Humble and Obedient Servant,                                  OPERA GHOST.    The letter was accompanied by a cutting from the agony-column of the  Revue Theatrale, which ran:    O. G.--There is no excuse for R. and M.  We told them and left your  memorandum-book in their hands.  Kind regards.    M. Firmin Richard had hardly finished reading this letter when M.  Armand Moncharmin entered, carrying one exactly similar.  They looked  at each other and burst out laughing.    \"They are keeping up the joke,\" said M. Richard, \"but I don't call it  funny.\"    \"What does it all mean?\" asked M. Moncharmin.  \"Do they imagine that,  because they have been managers of the Opera, we are going to let them  have a box for an indefinite period?\"    \"I am not in the mood to let myself be laughed at long,\" said Firmin  Richard.    \"It's harmless enough,\" observed Armand Moncharmin.  \"What is it they  really want?  A box for to-night?\"    M. Firmin Richard told his secretary to send Box Five on the grand tier  to Mm. Debienne and Poligny, if it was not sold.  It was not.  It was  sent off to them.  Debienne lived at the corner of the Rue Scribe and  the Boulevard des Capucines; Poligny, in the Rue Auber.  O. Ghost's two  letters had been posted at the Boulevard des Capucines post-office, as  Moncharmin remarked after examining the envelopes.    \"You see!\" said Richard.    They shrugged their shoulders and regretted that two men of that age  should amuse themselves with such childish tricks.    \"They might have been civil, for all that!\" said Moncharmin.  \"Did you  notice how they treat us with regard to Carlotta, Sorelli and Little  Jammes?\"    \"Why, my dear fellow, these two are mad with jealousy!  To think that  they went to the expense of, an advertisement in the Revue Theatrale!  Have they nothing better to do?\"    \"By the way,\" said Moncharmin, \"they seem to be greatly interested in  that little Christine Daae!\"    \"You know as well as I do that she has the reputation of being quite  good,\" said Richard.    \"Reputations are easily obtained,\" replied Moncharmin.  \"Haven't I a  reputation for knowing all about music?  And I don't know one key from  another.\"    \"Don't be afraid:  you never had that reputation,\" Richard declared.    Thereupon he ordered the artists to be shown in, who, for the last two  hours, had been walking up and down outside the door behind which fame  and fortune--or dismissal--awaited them.    The whole day was spent in discussing, negotiating, signing or  cancelling contracts; and the two overworked managers went to bed  early, without so much as casting a glance at Box Five to see whether  M. Debienne and M. Poligny were enjoying the performance.    Next morning, the managers received a card of thanks from the ghost:    DEAR, MR.  MANAGER:    Thanks.  Charming evening.  Daae exquisite.  Choruses want waking up.  Carlotta a splendid commonplace instrument.  Will write you soon for  the 240,000 francs, or 233,424 fr. 70 c., to be correct.  Mm. Debienne  and Poligny have sent me the 6,575 fr. 30 c. representing the first ten  days of my allowance for the current year; their privileges finished on  the evening of the tenth inst.    Kind regards.  O. G.    On the other hand, there was a letter from Mm. Debienne and Poligny:    GENTLEMEN:    We are much obliged for your kind thought of us, but you will easily  understand that the prospect of again hearing Faust, pleasant though it  is to ex-managers of the Opera, can not make us forget that we have no  right to occupy Box Five on the grand tier, which is the exclusive  property of HIM of whom we spoke to you when we went through the  memorandum-book with you for the last time.  See Clause 98, final  paragraph.    Accept, gentlemen, etc.    \"Oh, those fellows are beginning to annoy me!\" shouted Firmin Richard,  snatching up the letter.    And that evening Box Five was sold.    The next morning, Mm. Richard and Moncharmin, on reaching their office,  found an inspector's report relating to an incident that had happened,  the night before, in Box Five.  I give the essential part of the report:    I was obliged to call in a municipal guard twice, this evening, to  clear Box Five on the grand tier, once at the beginning and once in the  middle of the second act.  The occupants, who arrived as the curtain  rose on the second act, created a regular scandal by their laughter and  their ridiculous observations.  There were cries of \"Hush!\" all around  them and the whole house was beginning to protest, when the box-keeper  came to fetch me.  I entered the box and said what I thought necessary.  The people did not seem to me to be in their right mind; and they made  stupid remarks.  I said that, if the noise"]]]
