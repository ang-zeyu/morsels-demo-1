There were over a hundred rooms in it, shaped just as  the snow had drifted. The biggest one stretched for many miles. They  were all lighted by the strongest northern lights. All the rooms were  immensely big and empty, and glittering in their iciness. There was  never any gaiety in them; not even so much as a ball for the little  bears, when the storms might have turned up as the orchestra, and the  polar bears might have walked about on their hind legs and shown off  their grand manners. There was never even a little game-playing party,  for such games as 'touch last' or 'the biter bit'--no, not even a little  gossip over the coffee cups for the white fox misses. Immense, vast,  and cold were the Snow Queen's halls. The northern lights came and went  with such regularity that you could count the seconds between their  coming and going. In the midst of these never-ending snow-halls was a  frozen lake. It was broken up on the surface into a thousand bits, but  each piece was so exactly like the others that the whole formed a  perfect work of art. The Snow Queen sat in the very middle of it when  she sat at home. She then said that she was sitting on 'The Mirror of  Reason,' and that it was the best and only one in the world.    Little Kay was blue with cold, nay, almost black; but he did not know  it, for the Snow Queen had kissed away the icy shiverings, and his heart  was little better than a lump of ice. He went about dragging some sharp,  flat pieces of ice, which he placed in all sorts of patterns, trying to  make something out of them; just as when we at home have little tablets  of wood, with which we make patterns, and call them a 'Chinese puzzle.'    Kay's patterns were most ingenious, because they were the 'Ice Puzzles  of Reason.' In his eyes they were first-rate and of the greatest  importance: this was because of the grain of glass still in his eye. He  made many patterns forming words, but he never could find out the right  way to place them for one particular word, a word he was most anxious to  make. It was 'Eternity.' The Snow Queen had said to him that if he could  find out this word he should be his own master, and she would give him  the whole world and a new pair of skates. But he could not discover it.    'Now I am going to fly away to the warm countries,' said the Snow Queen.  'I want to go and peep into the black caldrons!' She meant the volcanoes  Etna and Vesuvius by this. 'I must whiten them a little; it does them  good, and the lemons and the grapes too!' And away she flew.    Kay sat quite alone in all those many miles of empty ice halls. He  looked at his bits of ice, and thought and thought, till something gave  way within him. He sat so stiff and immovable that one might have  thought he was frozen to death.    Then it was that little Gerda walked into the Palace, through the great  gates in a biting wind. She said her evening prayer, and the wind  dropped as if lulled to sleep, and she walked on into the big empty  hall. She saw Kay, and knew him at once; she flung her arms round his  neck, held him fast, and cried, 'Kay, little Kay, have I found you at  last?'    But he sat still, rigid and cold.    Then little Gerda shed hot tears; they fell upon his breast and  penetrated to his heart. Here they thawed the lump of ice, and melted  the little bit of the mirror which was in it. He looked at her, and she  sang:        'Where roses deck the flowery vale,      There, Infant Jesus, we thee hail!'    Then Kay burst into tears; he cried so much that the grain of glass  was washed out of his eye. He knew her, and shouted with joy, 'Gerda,  dear little Gerda! where have you been for such a long time? And where  have I been?' He looked round and said, 'How cold it is here; how empty  and vast!' He kept tight hold of Gerda, who laughed and cried for joy.  Their happiness was so heavenly that even the bits of ice danced for joy  around them; and when they settled down, there they lay! just in the  very position the Snow Queen had told Kay he must find out, if he was to  become his own master and have the whole world and a new pair of skates.    Gerda kissed his cheeks and they grew rosy, she kissed his eyes and they  shone like hers, she kissed his hands and his feet, and he became well  and strong. The Snow Queen might come home whenever she liked, his order  of release was written there in shining letters of ice.    They took hold of each other's hands and wandered out of the big Palace.  They talked about grandmother, and about the roses upon the roof.  Wherever they went the winds lay still and the sun broke through the  clouds. When they reached the bush with the red berries they found the  reindeer waiting for them, and he had brought another young reindeer  with him, whose udders were full. The children drank her warm milk and  kissed her on the mouth. Then they carried Kay and Gerda, first to the  Finn woman, in whose heated hut they warmed themselves and received  directions about the homeward journey. Then they went on to the Lapp  woman; she had made new clothes for them and prepared her sledge. Both  the reindeer ran by their side, to the boundaries of the country; here  the first green buds appeared, and they said 'Good-bye' to the reindeer  and the Lapp woman. They heard the first little birds twittering and saw  the buds in the forest. Out of it came riding a young girl on a  beautiful horse, which Gerda knew, for it had drawn the golden chariot.  She had a scarlet cap on her head and pistols in her belt; it was the  little robber girl, who was tired of being at home. She was riding  northwards to see how she liked it before she tried some other part of  the world. She knew them again, and Gerda recognised her with delight.    'You are a nice fellow to go tramping off!' she said to little Kay. 'I  should like to know if you deserve to have somebody running to the end  of the world for your sake!'    But Gerda patted her cheek, and asked about the Prince and Princess.    'They are travelling in foreign countries,' said the robber girl.    'But the crow?' asked Gerda.    'Oh, the crow is dead!' she answered. 'The tame sweetheart is a widow,  and goes about with a bit of black wool tied round her leg. She pities  herself bitterly, but it's all nonsense! But tell me how you got on  yourself, and where you found him.'    Gerda and Kay both told her all about it.    'Snip, snap, snurre, it's all right at last then!' she said, and she  took hold of their hands and promised that if she ever passed through  their town she would pay them a visit. Then she rode off into the wide  world. But Kay and Gerda walked on, hand in hand, and wherever they went  they found the most delightful spring and blooming flowers. Soon they  recognised the big town where they lived, with its tall towers, in which  the bells still rang their merry peals. They went straight on to  grandmother's door, up the stairs and into her room. Everything was just  as they had left it, and the old clock ticked in the corner, and the  hands pointed to the time. As they went through the door into the room  they perceived that they were grown up. The roses clustered round the  open window, and there stood their two little chairs. Kay and Gerda sat  down upon them, still holding each other by the hand. All the cold empty  grandeur of the Snow Queen's palace had passed from their memory like a  bad dream. Grandmother sat in God's warm sunshine reading from her  Bible.    'Without ye become as little children ye cannot enter into the Kingdom  of Heaven.'    Kay and Gerda looked into each other's eyes, and then all at once the  meaning of the old hymn came to them.        'Where roses deck the flowery vale,      There, Infant Jesus, we thee hail!'    And there they both sat, grown up and yet children, children at heart;  and it was summer--warm, beautiful summer.          THE NIGHTINGALE    [Illustration: _Among these trees lived a nightingale, which sang so  deliciously, that even the poor fisherman, who had plenty of other  things to do, lay still to listen to it, when he was out at night  drawing in his nets._]    In China, as you know, the Emperor is a Chinaman, and all the people  around him are Chinamen too. It is many years since the story I am going  to tell you happened, but that is all the more reason for telling it,  lest it should be forgotten. The emperor's palace was the most beautiful  thing in the world; it was made entirely of the finest porcelain, very  costly, but at the same time so fragile that it could only be touched  with the very greatest care. There were the most extraordinary flowers  to be seen in the garden; the most beautiful ones had little silver  bells tied to them, which tinkled perpetually, so that one should not  pass the flowers without looking at them. Every little detail in the  garden had been most carefully thought out, and it was so big, that even  the gardener himself did not know where it ended. If one went on  walking, one came to beautiful woods with lofty trees and deep lakes.  The wood extended to the sea, which was deep and blue, deep enough for  large ships to sail up right under the branches of the trees. Among  these trees lived a nightingale, which sang so deliciously, that even  the poor fisherman, who had plenty of other things to do, lay still to  listen to it, when he was out at night drawing in his nets. 'Heavens,  how beautiful it is!' he said, but then he had to attend to his business  and forgot it. The next night when he heard it again he would again  exclaim, 'Heavens, how beautiful it is!'    Travellers came to the emperor's capital, from every country in the  world; they admired everything very much, especially the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17866"],[0,"Murder in the Gunroom (#7)"],[1,"anything, but you'd have given him a lot of dirty publicity.  That's all Fleming was expecting to do about those wheel locks.\"    \"I'm not Fleming. He could afford litigation like that; I can't. I want  my money, and if I don't get it in cash, I'm going to beat it out of that  dirty little swindler's hide,\" Gresham replied, an ugly look appearing on  his face.    \"I wouldn't blame you. You could find plenty of other collectors who'd  hold your coat while you were doing it,\" Rand told him. Then he inquired,  idly: \"What sort of a pistol was it that Lane Fleming is supposed to have  shot himself with?\"    Gresham frowned. \"I really don't know; I didn't see it. It's supposed  to have been a Confederate Leech & Rigdon .36; you know, one of those  imitation Colt Navy Models that were made in the South during the Civil  War.\"    Rand nodded. He was familiar with the type.    \"The story is that Fleming found it hanging back of the counter at some  roadside lunch-stand, along with a lot of other old pistols, and talked  the proprietor into letting it go for a few dollars,\" Gresham continued.  \"It was supposed to have been loaded at the time, and went off while  Fleming was working on it, at home.\" He shook his head. \"I can't believe  that, Jeff. Lane Fleming would know a loaded revolver when he saw one. I  believe he deliberately shot himself, and the family faked the accident  and fixed the authorities. The police never made any investigation; it  was handled by the coroner alone. And our coroner, out in Scott County,  is eminently fixable, if you go about it right; a pitiful little  nonentity with a tremendous inferiority complex.\"    \"But good Lord, why?\" Rand demanded. \"I never heard of Fleming having any  troubles worth killing himself over.\"    Gresham lowered his voice. \"Jeff, I'm not supposed to talk about this,  but the fact is that I believe Fleming was about to lose control of the  Premix Company,\" he said. \"I have, well, sources of inside information.  This is in confidence, so don't quote me, but certain influences were at  work, inside the company, toward that end.\" He inspected the tip of his  cigar and knocked off the ash into the tray at his elbow. \"Lane Fleming's  death is on record as accidental, Jeff. It's been written off as such. It  would be a great deal better for all concerned if it were left at that.\"          CHAPTER 5      Rand drove slowly through Rosemont, the next day, refreshing his memory  of the place. It was one of the many commuters' villages strung out for  fifty miles along the railroad lines radiating from New Belfast, and  depended for its support upon a population scattered over a five-mile  radius at estates and country homes. Obviously a planned community, it  was dominated by a gray-walled, green-roofed railroad station which stood  on its passenger-platform like a captain in front of four platoons of  gray-walled, green-roofed houses and stores aligned along as many  converging roads. There was a post office, uniform with the rest of the  buildings; an excessive quantity of aluminum trimming dated it somewhere  in the middle Andrew W. Mellon period. There were four gas stations, a  movie theater, and a Woolworth store with a red front that made it look  like some painted hussy who had wandered into a Quaker Meeting.    Over the door of one of the smaller stores, Rand saw a black-lettered  white sign: _Antiques_. There was a smoke-gray Plymouth coupe parked in  front of it.    Instead of turning onto the road to the Fleming estate, he continued  along Route 19 for a mile or so beyond the village, until he came to a  red brick pseudo-Colonial house on the right. He pulled to the side of  the road and got out, turning up the collar of his trench coat. The air  was raw and damp, doubly unpleasant after the recent unseasonable warmth.  An apathetically persistent rain sogged the seedling-dotted old fields on  either side, and the pine-woods beyond, and a high ceiling of unbroken  dirty gray gave no promise of clearing. The mournful hoot of a distant  locomotive whistle was the only sound to pierce the silence. For a  moment, Rand stood with his back to the car, looking at the gallows-like  sign that proclaimed this to be the business-place of Arnold Rivers,  Fine Antique and Modern Firearms for the Discriminating Collector.    The house faced the road with a long side; at the left, a porch formed  a continuation under a deck roof, and on the right, an ell had been  built at right angles, extending thirty feet toward the road. Although  connected to the house by a shed roof, which acquired a double pitch and  became a gable roof where the ell projected forward, it was, in effect,  a separate building, with its own front door and its own door-path. Its  floor-level was about four feet lower than that of the parent structure.    A Fibber McGee door-chime clanged as Rand entered. Closing the door  behind him, he looked around. The room, some twenty feet wide and fifty  long, was lighted by an almost continuous row of casement windows on the  right, and another on the left for as far as the ell extended beyond the  house. They were set high, a good five feet from lower sill to floor, and  there was no ceiling; the sloping roof was supported by bare timber  rafters. Racks lined the walls, under the windows, holding long-guns  and swords; the pistols and daggers and other small items were displayed  on a number of long tables. In the middle of the room, glaring at the  front door, was a brass four-pounder on a ship's carriage; a Philippine  _latanka_, muzzle tilted upward, stood beside it. Where the ell joined  the house under the shed roof, there was a fireplace, and a short flight  of steps to a landing and a door out of the dwelling, and some  furniture--a davenport, three or four deep chairs facing the fire, a low  cocktail-table, a cellarette, and, in the far corner, a big desk.    As Rand went toward the rear, a young man rose from one of the chairs,  laid aside a magazine, and advanced to meet him. He didn't exactly  harmonize with all the lethal array around him; he would have looked more  at home presiding over an establishment devoted to ladies' items. His  costume ran to pastel shades, he had large and soulful blue eyes and  prettily dimpled cheeks, and his longish blond hair was carefully  disordered into a windblown effect.    \"Oh, good afternoon,\" he greeted. \"Is there anything in particular you're  interested in, or would you like to just look about?\"    \"Mostly look about,\" Rand said. \"Is Mr. Rivers in?\"    \"Mr. Rivers is having luncheon. He'll be finished before long, if you  care to wait.... Have you ever been here before?\"    \"Not for some time,\" Rand said. \"When I was here last, there was a young  fellow named Jordan, or Gordon, or something like that.\"    \"Oh. He was before my time.\" The present functionary introduced himself  as Cecil Gillis. Rand gave his name and shook hands with him. Young  Gillis wanted to know if Rand was a collector.    \"In a small way. General-pistol collector,\" Rand told him. \"Have you many  Colts, now?\"    There was a whole table devoted to Colts. No spurious Whitneyville  Walkers; after all, a dealer can sell just so many of such top-drawer  rarities before the finger of suspicion begins leveling itself in his  direction, and Arnold Rivers had long ago passed that point. There were  several of the commoner percussion models, however, with lovely, perfect  bluing that was considerably darker than that applied at the Colt factory  during the 'fifties and 'sixties of the last century. The silver plating  on backstraps and trigger-guards was perfect, too, but the naval-battle  and stagecoach-holdup engravings on the cylinders were far from clear--in  one case, completely obliterated. The cylinder of one 1851 Navy bore  serial numbers that looked as though they had been altered to conform to  the numbers on other parts of the weapon. Many of the Colts, however,  were entirely correct, and all were in reasonably good condition.    Rand saw something that interested him, and picked it up.    \"That isn't a real Colt,\" the exquisite Mr. Gillis told him. \"It's a  Confederate copy; a Leech & Rigdon.\"    \"So I see. I have a Griswold & Grier, but no Leech & Rigdon.\"    \"The Griswold & Grier; that's the one with the brass frame,\" Cecil Gillis  said. \"Surprising how many collectors think all Confederate revolvers  had brass frames, because of the Griswold & Grier, and the Spiller &  Burr.... That's an unusually fine specimen, Mr. Rand. Mr. Rivers got  it sometime in late December or early January; from a gentleman in  Charleston, I understand. I believe it had been carried during the Civil  War by a member of the former owner's family.\"    Rand looked at the tag tied to the trigger-guard; it was marked, in  letter-code, with three different prices. That was characteristic of  Arnold Rivers's business methods.    \"How much does Mr. Rivers want for this?\" he asked, handing the revolver  to young Gillis.    The clerk mentally decoded the three prices and vacillated for a moment  over them. He had already appraised Rand, from his twenty-dollar Stetson  past his Burberry trench coat to his English hand-sewn shoes, and placed  him in the pay-dirt bracket; however, from some remarks Rand had let  drop, he decided that this customer knew pistols, and probably knew  values.    \"Why, that is sixty dollars, Mr. Rand,\" he said, with the air of one  conferring a benefaction. Maybe he was, at that, Rand decided; prices had  jumped like the very devil since the war.    \"I'll take it.\" He dug out his billfold and extracted three twenties.  \"Nice clean condition; clean it up yourself?\"    \"Why, no. Mr. Rivers got it like this. As I said, it's supposed to have  been a family heirloom, but from the way it's been cared for, I would  have thought it had been in a collection,\" the clerk replied. \"Shall I  wrap it for you?\"    \"Yes, if you please.\" Rand followed him"]]]
