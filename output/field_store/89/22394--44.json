Here I paid the laoban 2000 cash, whereupon he paid  his men something on account, and then blandly suggested a game of  cards. He was fast winning back his money, when I intervened and bade  them turn in, as I wished to make an early start in the morning. The  river seemed to get broader, deeper, and more rapid as we ascended; the  trackers, on the contrary, became thinner, narrower, and more decrepit.    On March 8th, our fourteenth day out, disaster nearly overtook us when  within a day's sail of our destination. Next day we reached Chungking  safely, having done by some days the fastest journey on record up the  Yangtse rapids. My captain and his young crew had finished the journey  within the time agreed upon.    [Illustration: THE RIVER YANGTSE AT TUNG-LO-HSIA.]    [Illustration: MEMORIAL ARCHWAY AT THE FORT OF FU-TO-KUAN.]          CHAPTER IV.    THE CITY OF CHUNGKING--THE CHINESE CUSTOMS--THE FAMOUS MONSIEUR HAAS,  AND A FEW WORDS ON THE OPIUM FALLACY.      After passing through the gorge known as Tung-lo-hsia ten miles from  Chungking, the laoban tried to attract my attention, calling me from my  crib and pointing with his chin up the river repeating \"Haikwan one  piecee,\" which I interpreted to mean that there was an outpost of the  customs here in charge of one white man; and this proved to be the case.  The customs kuatze or houseboat was moored to the left bank; the  Imperial Customs flag floated gaily over an animated collection of  native craft. We drew alongside the junk and an Englishman appeared at  the window.    \"Where from?\" he asked, laconically.    \"Australia.\"    \"The devil, so am I. What part?\"    \"Victoria.\"    \"So am I. Town?\"    \"Last from Ballarat.\"    \"My native town, by Jove! Jump up.\"    I gave him my card. He looked at it and said, \"When I was last in  Victoria I used to follow with much interest a curious walk across  Australia, from the Gulf of Carpentaria to Melbourne done by a namesake.  Any relation? The same man! I'm delighted to see you.\" Here then at the  most inland of the customs stations in China, 1500 miles from the sea,  I met my fellow countryman who was born near my home and whose father  was a well-known Mayor of Ballarat City.    Like myself he had formerly been a student of Melbourne University, but  I was many years his senior. What was his experience of the University I  forgot to inquire, but mine I remember vividly enough; for it was not  happy. In the examination for the Second-year Medicine, hoping the more  to impress the Professors, I entered my name for honours--and they  rejected me in the preliminary pass. It seems that in the examination in  Materia Medica, I had among other trifling lapses prescribed a dose of  Oleum Crotonis of \"one half to two drachms _carefully increased_.\" I  confess that I had never heard of the wretched stuff; the question was  taken from far on in the text book and, unfortunately, my reading had  not extended quite so far. When a deputation from my family waited upon  the examiner to ascertain the cause of my misadventure, the only  satisfaction we got was the obliging assurance \"that you might as well  let a mad dog loose in Collins Street\" as allow me to become a doctor.  And then the examiner produced my prescription. But I thought I saw a  faint chance of escape. I pointed a nervous finger to the two words  \"carefully increased,\" and pleaded that that indication of caution ought  to save me. \"Save _you_ it might,\" he shouted with unnecessary  vehemence; \"but, God bless my soul, man, it would not save your  patient.\" The examiner was a man intemperate of speech; so I left the  University. It was a severe blow to the University, but the University  survived it.    My countryman had been five years in China in the customs service, that  marvellous organisation which is more impartially open to all the world  than any other service in the world. As an example, I note that among  the Commissioners of Customs at the ports of the River Yangtse alone, at  the time of my voyage the Commissioner at Shanghai was an Austrian, at  Kiukiang a Frenchman, at Hankow an Englishman, at Ichang a Scandinavian,  and at Chungking a German.    The Australian had been ten months at Chungking. His up-river journey  occupied thirty-eight days, and was attended with one moving incident.  In the Hsintan rapid the towline parted, and his junk was smashed to  pieces by the rocks, and all that he possessed destroyed. It was in this  rapid that my boat narrowly escaped disaster, but there was this  difference in our experiences, that at the time of his accident the  river was sixty feet higher than on the occasion of mine.    Tang-chia-to, the customs out-station, is ten miles by river from  Chungking, but not more than four miles by land. So I sent the boat on,  and in the afternoon walked over to the city. A customs coolie came with  me to show me the way. My friend accompanied me to the river crossing,  walking with me through fields of poppy and sugarcane, and open beds of  tobacco. At the river side he left me to return to his solitary home,  while I crossed the river in a sampan, and then set out over the hills  to Chungking. It was more than ever noticeable, the poor hungry  wretchedness of the river coolies. For three days past all the trackers  I had seen were the most wretched in physique of any I had met in China.  Phthisis and malaria prevail among them; their work is terribly arduous;  they suffer greatly from exposure; they appear to be starving in the  midst of abundance. My coolie showed well by contrast with the trackers;  he was sleek and well fed. A \"chop dollar,\" as he would be termed down  south, for his face was punched or chopped with the small-pox, he swung  along the paved pathway and up and down the endless stone steps in a way  that made me breathless to follow. We passed a few straggling houses and  wayside shrines and tombstones. All the dogs in the district recognised  that I was a stranger, and yelped consumedly, like the wolfish mongrels  that they are. From a hill we obtained a misty view of the City of  Chungking, surrounded on two sides by river and covering a broad expanse  of hill and highland. I was taken to the customs pontoon on the south  bank of the river, and then up the steep bank by many steps to the  basement of an old temple where the two customs officers have their  pleasant dwelling. I was kindly received, and stayed the night. We were  an immense height above the water; the great city was across the broad  expanse of river, here more than seven hundred yards in width. Away down  below us, moored close to the bank, and guarded by three Chinese armed  junks or gunboats, was the customs hulk, where the searching is done,  and where the three officers of the outdoor staff have their offices.  There is at present but little smuggling, because there are no Chinese  officials. Smuggling may be expected to begin in earnest as soon as  Chinese officials are introduced to prevent it. Chinese searchers do  best who use their eyes not to see--best for themselves, that is. The  gunboats guarding this Haikwan Station have a nominal complement of  eighty men, and an actual complement of twenty-four; to avoid, however,  unnecessary explanation, pay is drawn by the commanding officer, not for  the actual twenty-four, but for the nominal eighty.    [Illustration: THE CITY OF CHUNGKING, AS SEEN FROM THE OPPOSITE BANK OF  THE RIVER YANGTSE.]    My two companions in the temple were tidewaiters in the Customs. There  are many storied lives locked away among the tidewaiters in China. Down  the river there is a tidewaiter who was formerly professor of French in  the Imperial University of St. Petersburg; and here in Chungking,  filling the same humble post, is the godson of a marquis and the nephew  of an earl, a brave soldier whose father is a major-general and his  mother an earl's daughter, and who is first cousin to that enlightened  nobleman and legislator the Earl of C. Few men so young have had so many  and varied experiences as this sturdy Briton. He has humped his swag in  Australia, has earned fifteen shillings a day there as a blackleg  protected by police picquets on a New South Wales coal mine. He was at  Harrow under Dr. Butler, and at Corpus Christi, Cambridge. He has been  in the Dublin Fusiliers, and a lieutenant in Weatherby's Horse, enlisted  in the 5th Lancers, and rose from private to staff-sergeant, and ten  months later would have had his commission. He served with distinction  in the Soudan and Zululand, and has three medals with four clasps. He  was present at El Teb, and at the disaster at Tamai, when McNeill's  zareeba was broken. He was at Tel-el-kebir; saw Burnaby go forth to meet  a coveted death at Abu-klea, and was present at Abu-Kru when Sir Herbert  Stewart received his death-wound. He was at Rorke's Drift, and appears  with that heroic band in Miss Elizabeth Thompson's painting. Leaving the  army, C. held for a time a commission in the mounted constabulary of  Madras, and now he is a third class assistant tidewaiter in the Imperial  Maritime Customs of China, with a salary as low as his spirits are high.    Chungking is an open port, which is not an open port. By the treaty of  Tientsin it is included in the clause which states that any foreign  steamer going to it, a closed port, shall be confiscated. Yet by the  Chefoo Convention, Chungking is to become an open port as soon as the  first foreign steamer shall reach there. This reminds one of the  conflicting instructions once issued by a certain government in  reference to the building of a new gaol. The instructions were  explicit:--         Clause I.--The new gaol shall be constructed out of the       materials of the old.         Clause II.--The prisoners shall remain in the old gaol till       the new gaol is constructed.

To find angles, BAc', ABb, and length of link, E.    1. As the length of arm, D, is to the chord of arc, ab, divided by  2, so is the radius to the sine angle oscillation of arm, D, divided  by 4.    2. 360 deg. is to the whole circumference as the angle bBa is to the  length of arc ab.    3. Now arc ab is equal to arc a'c'.    4. The whole circumference is to 360 deg. as the length of arc a'e' is  to the angle oscillation of C divided by 2.    5. Half angle oscillation, C, taken from angle BAa' is equal to angle  BAc'.    6. Half angle oscillation, D, taken from angle ABa is equal to angle  ABb.    7.

MESSRS. EDITORS:--In one of the late numbers of your journal, you  publish a paper, read by Mr. Porter before some learned society in New  York, on something about the possibility or practicability of running  a steam engine at a high rate of speed, and claiming to give a  scientific explanation of the why and wherefore. Now, scientifically,  I know nothing about a steam engine; practically, I know how to stop  and start one. Therefore, you will understand that what I say is not  as coming from one who claims to be wise above what is written, but as  simply being a statement of the case, as it appears to one who wants  to learn, and takes this way to draw out the truth. A scientific  theory, invested with all its sines, coefficients, and other  paraphernalia, is a very pretty thing to look at, no doubt, for those  who understand it, and, when properly applied, is invaluable; but  when, as in this case, a practical question is to be decided, by the  aid of a scientific demonstration, it will not do to throw aside the  main elements of the problem, or any, in fact, of the minor points, no  matter how trivial they may appear.    Mr. Porter's labors were strictly of a scientific nature. He starts  out with the proposition that what he is about to explain is very  simple, and very likely it is; but, for one, I can't see it, and I  want more light. He says that it takes a certain number of pounds to  overcome the inertia of the reciprocating parts of a certain weight,  to give it a certain speed. What is inertia? He says, \"we will not  take into account the friction of parts.\" Now, my understanding of  this point is, that friction is practically one of the main elements  in the problem. How can we hope to obtain a correct solution when he  rubs out one of the terms of the equation? What is friction doing all  the time, while he is theoretically having his reciprocating parts  storing up power and then giving it out again, just at the right time,  and in the right quantity?    What an immense amount of iron has been wasted by being cast into fly  wheels, when a fraction of the amount, if only put into cross heads,  would render fly wheels unnecessary!    Mr. Porter stops short in his discussion. He should have added a table  giving the proportionate length of stroke, weight of parts, and number  of revolutions required to produce the effect of an engine running at  a high speed, without the least fraction of inequality in the strain  on the crank, and then the sun would have fairly risen in the \"dawn of  a new era for the steam engine.\" But, as it is so very simple, we can  all figure it out for ourselves.    In the diagram Mr. Porter gives, to illustrate the travel of the  piston, he wets his finger and draws it over another term in the  equation (a method of elimination not taught by Hutton, Davies, and  other mathematicians). It is a quick way, but is it correct? He says,  \"the distance traveled by the piston is the versed sine of an angle  formed by a line from the center of the crank pin, in any part of its  stroke to the center of the circle described by the crank pin, leaving  out of the calculation the angular vibration of the connecting rod.\"  What he means by the \"angular vibration,\" I do not know. He is wrong  in the statement. If he will think of it he will see it. If he meant  to say that the piston's travel was measured by the versed sine of the  angle formed by the connecting rod and the line of horizontal centers,  he is wrong again, yet nearer the truth than before, just as the  proportion between the length of the connecting rod and the half  diameter of the circle described by the crank pin. This can quickly  be seen by supposing the connecting rod to be detached, and allowed  to fall down on the center line, at any part of the stroke. If he  understood this (as no doubt he did), he should not ignore the facts.    What I am aiming at is this. When a man attempts to demonstrate a  thing mathematically, he must take into his calculation everything  essentially connected with the problem, just exactly as it is, and not  as he would have it; otherwise, he cannot, by any possibility, attain  a correct result. When he claims, as now, the practicability of  running engines at a high speed, I think he is claiming too much.  Build an engine of proper materials, make it strong, and fit  everything as it should be, balance crank and fly wheel to a nicety,  keep everything snugly in its place, and the terrors of a quick stroke  vanish.

EDITORS:--I have read, with much interest, Dr. Chandler's  colorimetric test of the purity of white lead, as published in the  SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN sometime ago. I enclose another test, which,  though not new, is of value to all using white lead on account of its  simplicity and effectiveness. It has been in use here for nearly two  years, and has been found reliable. Having never seen it in print, I  have tried to put it in as simple words as possible.    FELIX MCARDLE, Analytical Chemist.  St. Louis, Mo.    Take a piece of firm, close grained charcoal, and, near one end of it,  scoop out a cavity about half an inch in diameter and a quarter of an  inch in depth. Place in the cavity a sample, of the lead to be tested,  about the size of a small pea, and apply to it continuously the  blue or hottest part of the flame of the blow pipe; if the sample be  strictly pure, it will in a very short time, say in two minutes, be  reduced to metallic lead, leaving no residue; but if it be adulterated  to the extent of ten per cent. only, with oxide of zinc, sulphate of  baryta, whiting or any other carbonate of lime, (which substances are  now the only adulterations used), or if it be composed entirely of  these materials, as is sometimes the case with cheap lead, it cannot  be reduced, but will remain on the charcoal an infusible mass.    Dry white lead, (carbonate of lead) is composed of metallic lead,  oxygen and carbonic acid, and, when ground with linseed oil, forms the  white lead of commerce. When it is subjected to the above treatment,  the oil is first burned off, and then at a certain degree of heat, the  oxygen and carbonic acid are set free, leaving only the metallic lead  from which it was manufactured. If, however, there be present in the  sample any of the above mentioned adulterations, they cannot of course  be reduced to metallic lead, and cannot be reduced, by any heat of  the blow pipe flame, to their own metallic bases; and being intimately  incorporated and ground with the carbonate of lead, they prevent it  from being reduced.    It is well, after blowing upon the sample, say for half a minute, by  which time the oil will be burned off, to loosen the sample from the  charcoal, with a knife blade or spatula, in order that the flame may  pass under as well as over and against it. With proper care the lead  will run into one button, instead of scattering over the charcoal,  and this is the reason why the cavity above mentioned is necessary. A  common star candle or a lard oil lamp furnishes the best flame for use  of the blow pipe; a coal oil lamp should not be used.    By the above test, after a little practice, so small an adulteration  as one or two per cent. can be detected; it is, however, only a test  of the purity or impurity of a lead, and if found adulterated, the  degree or percentage of adulteration cannot be well ascertained by it.    Jewellers usually have all the necessary apparatus for making the  test, and any one of them can readily make it by observing the above  directions, and from them can be obtained a blow pipe at small cost.    If you have no open package of the lead to be tested, a sample can  most easily be obtained by boring into the side or top of a keg with  a gimlet, and with it taking out the required quantity; care should be  used to free it entirely from the borings or"]]]
