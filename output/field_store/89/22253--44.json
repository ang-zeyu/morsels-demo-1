The doctrine of the immortality of the soul was not new to the  Greeks in the age of Socrates, but, like the unity of God, had a  foundation in the popular belief. The old Homeric notion of a gibbering  ghost flitting away to Hades; or of a few illustrious heroes enjoying  the isles of the blest; or of an existence divided between the two; or  the Hesiodic, of righteous spirits, who become guardian angels,--had  given place in the mysteries and the Orphic poets to representations,  partly fanciful, of a future state of rewards and punishments. (Laws.)  The reticence of the Greeks on public occasions and in some part of  their literature respecting this 'underground' religion, is not to be  taken as a measure of the diffusion of such beliefs. If Pericles in the  funeral oration is silent on the consolations of immortality, the  poet Pindar and the tragedians on the other hand constantly assume the  continued existence of the dead in an upper or under world. Darius  and Laius are still alive; Antigone will be dear to her brethren after  death; the way to the palace of Cronos is found by those who 'have  thrice departed from evil.' The tragedy of the Greeks is not 'rounded'  by this life, but is deeply set in decrees of fate and mysterious  workings of powers beneath the earth. In the caricature of Aristophanes  there is also a witness to the common sentiment. The Ionian and  Pythagorean philosophies arose, and some new elements were added to the  popular belief. The individual must find an expression as well as the  world. Either the soul was supposed to exist in the form of a magnet, or  of a particle of fire, or of light, or air, or water; or of a number or  of a harmony of number; or to be or have, like the stars, a principle  of motion (Arist. de Anim.). At length Anaxagoras, hardly distinguishing  between life and mind, or between mind human and divine, attained  the pure abstraction; and this, like the other abstractions of Greek  philosophy, sank deep into the human intelligence. The opposition of  the intelligible and the sensible, and of God to the world, supplied an  analogy which assisted in the separation of soul and body. If ideas were  separable from phenomena, mind was also separable from matter; if the  ideas were eternal, the mind that conceived them was eternal too. As  the unity of God was more distinctly acknowledged, the conception of the  human soul became more developed. The succession, or alternation of  life and death, had occurred to Heracleitus. The Eleatic Parmenides had  stumbled upon the modern thesis, that 'thought and being are the same.'  The Eastern belief in transmigration defined the sense of individuality;  and some, like Empedocles, fancied that the blood which they had shed  in another state of being was crying against them, and that for thirty  thousand years they were to be 'fugitives and vagabonds upon the earth.'  The desire of recognizing a lost mother or love or friend in the world  below (Phaedo) was a natural feeling which, in that age as well as in  every other, has given distinctness to the hope of immortality. Nor were  ethical considerations wanting, partly derived from the necessity of  punishing the greater sort of criminals, whom no avenging power of this  world could reach. The voice of conscience, too, was heard reminding  the good man that he was not altogether innocent. (Republic.) To these  indistinct longings and fears an expression was given in the mysteries  and Orphic poets: a 'heap of books' (Republic), passing under the names  of Musaeus and Orpheus in Plato's time, were filled with notions of an  under-world.    16. Yet after all the belief in the individuality of the soul after  death had but a feeble hold on the Greek mind. Like the personality of  God, the personality of man in a future state was not inseparably bound  up with the reality of his existence. For the distinction between the  personal and impersonal, and also between the divine and human, was far  less marked to the Greek than to ourselves. And as Plato readily passes  from the notion of the good to that of God, he also passes almost  imperceptibly to himself and his reader from the future life of the  individual soul to the eternal being of the absolute soul. There has  been a clearer statement and a clearer denial of the belief in modern  times than is found in early Greek philosophy, and hence the comparative  silence on the whole subject which is often remarked in ancient writers,  and particularly in Aristotle. For Plato and Aristotle are not further  removed in their teaching about the immortality of the soul than they  are in their theory of knowledge.    17. Living in an age when logic was beginning to mould human thought,  Plato naturally cast his belief in immortality into a logical form. And  when we consider how much the doctrine of ideas was also one of words,  it is not surprising that he should have fallen into verbal fallacies:  early logic is always mistaking the truth of the form for the truth of  the matter. It is easy to see that the alternation of opposites is  not the same as the generation of them out of each other; and that the  generation of them out of each other, which is the first argument in  the Phaedo, is at variance with their mutual exclusion of each other,  whether in themselves or in us, which is the last. For even if we admit  the distinction which he draws between the opposites and the things  which have the opposites, still individuals fall under the latter class;  and we have to pass out of the region of human hopes and fears to a  conception of an abstract soul which is the impersonation of the ideas.  Such a conception, which in Plato himself is but half expressed, is  unmeaning to us, and relative only to a particular stage in the history  of thought. The doctrine of reminiscence is also a fragment of a former  world, which has no place in the philosophy of modern times. But Plato  had the wonders of psychology just opening to him, and he had not the  explanation of them which is supplied by the analysis of language and  the history of the human mind. The question, 'Whence come our abstract  ideas?' he could only answer by an imaginary hypothesis. Nor is it  difficult to see that his crowning argument is purely verbal, and is  but the expression of an instinctive confidence put into a logical  form:--'The soul is immortal because it contains a principle of  imperishableness.' Nor does he himself seem at all to be aware that  nothing is added to human knowledge by his 'safe and simple answer,'  that beauty is the cause of the beautiful; and that he is merely  reasserting the Eleatic being 'divided by the Pythagorean numbers,'  against the Heracleitean doctrine of perpetual generation. The answer to  the 'very serious question' of generation and destruction is really  the denial of them. For this he would substitute, as in the Republic, a  system of ideas, tested, not by experience, but by their consequences,  and not explained by actual causes, but by a higher, that is, a more  general notion. Consistency with themselves is the only test which is to  be applied to them. (Republic, and Phaedo.)    18. To deal fairly with such arguments, they should be translated as  far as possible into their modern equivalents. 'If the ideas of men are  eternal, their souls are eternal, and if not the ideas, then not the  souls.' Such an argument stands nearly in the same relation to Plato and  his age, as the argument from the existence of God to immortality among  ourselves. 'If God exists, then the soul exists after death; and if  there is no God, there is no existence of the soul after death.' For  the ideas are to his mind the reality, the truth, the principle of  permanence, as well as of intelligence and order in the world. When  Simmias and Cebes say that they are more strongly persuaded of the  existence of ideas than they are of the immortality of the soul, they  represent fairly enough the order of thought in Greek philosophy. And we  might say in the same way that we are more certain of the existence  of God than we are of the immortality of the soul, and are led by the  belief in the one to a belief in the other. The parallel, as Socrates  would say, is not perfect, but agrees in as far as the mind in either  case is regarded as dependent on something above and beyond herself. The  analogy may even be pressed a step further: 'We are more certain of our  ideas of truth and right than we are of the existence of God, and  are led on in the order of thought from one to the other.' Or more  correctly: 'The existence of right and truth is the existence of God,  and can never for a moment be separated from Him.'    19. The main argument of the Phaedo is derived from the existence of  eternal ideas of which the soul is a partaker; the other argument of the  alternation of opposites is replaced by this. And there have not been  wanting philosophers of the idealist school who have imagined that the  doctrine of the immortality of the soul is a theory of knowledge, and  that in what has preceded Plato is accommodating himself to the popular  belief. Such a view can only be elicited from the Phaedo by what may  be termed the transcendental method of interpretation, and is obviously  inconsistent with the Gorgias and the Republic. Those who maintain  it are immediately compelled to renounce the shadow which they have  grasped, as a play of words only. But the truth is, that Plato in his  argument for the immortality of the soul has collected many elements of  proof or persuasion, ethical and mythological as well as dialectical,  which are not easily to be reconciled with one another; and he is as  much in earnest about his doctrine of retribution, which is repeated  in all his more ethical writings,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16598"],[0,"History of the American Negro in the Great World War (#7)"],[1,"l. The pity of it       all.'         \"War breeds socialism. At night the opposing hosts rest on their       arms, searching the heavens for the riddle of life and death, and       wondering what their tomorrow will bring forth. Around a thousand       camp fires the steady conviction is being driven home that this       sacrifice of life might all be avoided. It seems difficult to       realize that millions of men, skilled by years of constant       application, have left the factory, the mill, or the desk to waste       not only their time but their very lives and possibly the lives of       those dependent on them to wage war, brother against brother.         \"The more reasonable it appears that peace must quickly come, the       more hopeless does it seem. I am convinced that an overwhelming       majority of the populations of Germany, England and France are       opposed to this war. The Governments of these states do not want       war.         \"War deals in human life as recklessly as the gambler in money.         \"Imagine the point of view of a commanding general who is       confronted with the task of taking a fortress; 'That position will       cost me five thousand lives; it will be cheap at the price, for it       must be taken.'         \"He discounts five thousand human lives as easily as the       manufacturer marks off five thousand dollars for depreciation. And       so five thousand homes are saddened that another flag may fly over       a few feet of fortified masonry. What a grim joke for Europe to       play upon humanity.\"    There were not wanting those to point out to Mr. Ridder that the  sacrifice of life could have been avoided had Germany and its tool  Austria, played fair with Serbia and the balance of Europe. Also, his  statement that the government of Germany did not want the war has been  successfully challenged from a hundred different sources.    H. G. Wells, the eminent English author, contributed a prophecy which  translated very plainly the handwriting on the wall. He said:         \"This war is not going to end in diplomacy; it is going to end       diplomacy.         \"It is quite a different sort of war from any that have gone before.       At the end there will be no conference of Europe on the old lines,       but a conference of the world. It will make a peace that will put an       end to Krupp, and the spirit of Krupp and Kruppism and the private       armament firms behind Krupp for evermore.\"    Austria formally declared war against Serbia, July 28, 1914. During the  few days intervening between the dispatch of the ultimatum to Serbia and  the formal declaration of war, Serbia and Russia, seeing the inevitable,  had commenced to mobilize their armies. On the last day of July, Germany  as Austria's ally, issued an ultimatum with a twelve hour limit  demanding that Russia cease mobilization. They were fond of short term  ultimatums. They did not permit more than enough time for the dispatch  to be transmitted and received, much less considered, before the terms  of it had expired. Russia demanded assurances from Austria that war was  not forthcoming and it continued to mobilize. On August 1, Germany  declared war. France then began to mobilize.    Germany invaded the duchy of Luxemburg and demanded free passage for its  troops across Belgium to attack France at that country's most vulnerable  point. King Albert of Belgium refused his consent on the ground that the  neutrality of his country had been guaranteed by the powers of Europe,  including Germany itself, and appealed for diplomatic help from Great  Britain. That country, which had sought through its foreign secretary,  Sir Edward Grey, to preserve the peace of Europe, was now aroused.  August 4, it sent an ultimatum to Germany demanding that the neutrality  of Belgium be respected. As the demand was not complied with, Britain  formally declared war against Germany.    Italy at that time was joined with Germany and Austria in what was known  as the Triple Alliance. But Italy recognized the fact that the war was  one of aggression and held that it was not bound by its compact to  assist its allies. The sympathies of its people were with the French and  British. Afterwards Italy repudiated entirely its alliance and all  obligations to Germany and Austria and entered the war on the side of  the allies. Thus the country of Mazzini, of Garibaldi and Victor  Emmanuel, ranged itself on the side of emancipation and human rights.    The refusal of Italy to enter a war of conquest was the first event to  set the balance of the world seriously thinking of the meaning of the  war. If Italy refused to join its old allies, it meant that Italy was  too honorable to assist their purposes; Italy knew the character of its  associates. When it finally repudiated them altogether and joined the  war on the other side, it was a terrific indictment of the Germanic  powers, for Italy had much more to gain in a material way from its old  alliance. It simply showed the world that spirit was above materialism;  that emancipation was in the air and that the lamp of civilization might  be dimmed but could not be darkened by the forces of evil.          CHAPTER III.    MILITARISM AND AUTOCRACY DOOMED.      GERMANY'S MACHINE--HER SCIENTIFIC ENDEAVOR TO MOLD SOLDIERS--INFLUENCE  ON THOUGHT AND LIVES OF THE PEOPLE--MILITARISM IN THE HOME--THE STATUS  OF WOMAN--FALSE THEORIES AND FALSE GODS--THE SYSTEM ORDAINED TO  PERISH--WAR'S SHOCKS--AMERICA INCLINES TO NEUTRALITY--GERMAN AND FRENCH  TREATMENT OF NEUTRALS CONTRASTED--EXPERIENCES OF AMERICANS ABROAD AND  ENROUTE HOME--STATUE OF LIBERTY TAKES ON NEW BEAUTY--BLOOD OF NEGRO AND  WHITE TO FLOW.      Those who had followed the Kaiser's attitudes and their reflections  preceeding the war in the German military party, were struck by a  strange blending of martial glory and Christian compunction. No one  prays more loudly than the hypocrite and none so smug as the devil when  a saint he would be.    During long years the military machine had been under construction.  Human ingenuity had been reduced to a remarkable state of organization  and efficiency. One of the principal phases of Kultur was the  inauguration of a sort of scientific discipline which made the German  people not only soldiers in the field, but soldiers in the workshop, in  the laboratory and at the desk. The system extended to the schools and  universities and permeated the thought of the nation. It particularly  was reflected in the home; the domestic arrangements and customs of the  people. The German husband was the commander-in-chief of his household.  It was not that benevolent lordship which the man of the house assumes  toward his wife and family in other nations. The stern note of command  was always evident; that attitude of \"attention!\" \"eyes front!\" and  unquestioning obedience.    German women always were subordinate to their husbands and the male  members of their families. It was not because the man made the living  and supported the woman. Frequently the German woman contributed as much  towards the support of the family as the males; it was because the  German male by the system which had been inculcated into him, regarded  himself as a superior being and his women as inferiors, made for  drudgery, for child-bearing, and for contributors to his comforts and  pleasures. His attitude was pretty much like that of the American Indian  towards his squaw.    Germany was the only nation on earth pretending to civilization in which  women took the place of beasts of burden. They not only worked in the  fields, but frequently pulled the plow and other implements of  agriculture. It was not an uncommon sight in Germany to see a woman and  a large dog harnessed together drawing a milk cart. When it became  necessary to deliver the milk the woman slipped her part of the harness,  served the customer, resumed her harness and went on to the next stop.  In Belgium, in Holland and in France, women delivered the milk also, but  the cart always was drawn by one or two large dogs or other animals and  the woman was the driver. In Austria it was a strange sight to  foreigners, but occasioned no remark among the people, to see women  drawing carts and wagons in which were seated their lords and masters.  Not infrequently the boss wielded a whip.    The pride of the German nation was in its efficient workmen. Friends of  the country and its system have pointed to the fact of universal labor  as its great virtue; because to work is good. Really, they were  compelled to work. Long hours and the last degree of efficiency were  necessary in order to meet the requirements of life and the tremendous  burdens of taxation caused by the army, the navy, the fortifications and  the military machine in general; to say nothing of the expense of  maintaining the autocratic pomp of the Kaiser, his sons and satellites.  Every member of the German family had his or her task, even to the  little three-year-old toddler whose business it was to look after the  brooms, dust rags and other household utensils. There was nothing of  cheerfulness or even of the dignity of labor about this. It was hard,  unceasing, grinding toil which crushed the spirits of the people. It was  part of the system to cause them to welcome war as a diversion.    To the German mind everything had an aspect of seriousness. The people  took their pleasures seriously. On their holidays, mostly occasions on  which they celebrated an event in history or the birthday of a monarch  or military hero, or during the hours which they could devote to  relaxation, they gathered with serious, stolid faces in beer gardens. If  they danced it was mostly a cumbersome performance. Generally they  preferred to sit and blink behind great foaming tankards and listen to  intellectual music. No other nation had such music. It was so  intellectual in itself that it relieved the listeners of the necessity"]]]
