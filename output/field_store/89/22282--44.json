Somewhere,  far off, a band was playing, at intervals it seemed; and now and then,  nearer to, a silvery strain from a bugle shot sharply up through the  night, and seemed to lose itself like a rocket among the stars,--the  patient, untroubled stars. Suddenly a hand was laid upon my arm.    \"I'd like to say a word to you,\" said Bladburn.    With a little start of surprise, I made room for him on the fallen tree  where I was seated.    \"I mayn't get another chance,\" he said. \"You and the boys have been very  kind to me, kinder than I deserve; but sometimes I've fancied that my  not saying anything about myself had given you the idea that all was  not right in my past. I want to say that I came down to Virginia with a  clean record.\"    \"We never really doubted it, Bladburn.\"    \"If I didn't write home,\" he continued, \"it was because I hadn't any  home, neither kith nor kin. When I said the old folks were dead, I said  it. Am I boring you? If I thought I was--\"    \"No, Bladburn. I have often wanted you to talk to me about yourself, not  from idle curiosity, I trust, but because I liked you that rainy night  when you came to camp, and have gone on liking you ever since. This  isn't too much to say, when Heaven only knows how soon I may be past  saying it or you listening to it.\"    \"That's it,\" said Bladburn, hurriedly, \"that's why I want to talk with  you. I've a fancy that I shan't come out of our first battle.\"    The words gave me a queer start, for I had been trying several days to  throw off a similar presentiment concerning him,--a foolish presentiment  that grew out of a dream.    \"In case anything of that kind turns up,\" he continued, \"I'd like you to  have my Latin grammar here,--you've seen me reading it. You might stick  it away in a bookcase, for the sake of old times. It goes against me to  think of it falling into rough hands or being kicked about camp and  trampled under foot.\"    He was drumming softly with his fingers on the volume in the bosom of  his blouse.    \"I didn't intend to speak of this to a living soul,\" he went on,  motioning me not to answer him; \"but something took hold of me to-night  and made me follow you up here. Perhaps, if I told you all, you would be  the more willing to look after the little book in case it goes ill with  me. When the war broke out I was teaching school down in Maine, in the  same village where my father was schoolmaster before me. The old man  when he died left me quite alone. I lived pretty much by myself, having  no interests outside of the district school, which seemed in a manner my  personal property. Eight years ago last spring a new pupil was brought  to the school, a slight slip of a girl, with a sad kind of face and  quiet ways. Perhaps it was because she wasn't very strong, and perhaps  because she wasn't used over well by those who had charge of her, or  perhaps it was because my life was lonely, that my heart warmed to the  child. It all seems like a dream now, since that April morning when  little Mary stood in front of my desk with her pretty eyes looking down  bashfully and her soft hair falling over her face. One day I look up,  and six years have gone by,--as they go by in dreams,--and among the  scholars is a tall girl of sixteen, with serious, womanly eyes which I  cannot trust myself to look upon. The old life has come to an end. The  child has become a woman and can teach the master now. So help me  Heaven, I didn't know that I loved her until that day!    \"Long after the children had gone home I sat in the schoolroom with my  face resting on my hands. There was her desk, the afternoon shadows  falling across it. It never looked empty and cheerless before. I went  and stood by the low chair, as I had stood hundreds of times. On the  desk was a pile of books, ready to be taken away, and among the rest a  small Latin grammar which we had studied together. What little despairs  and triumphs and happy hours were associated with it! I took it up  curiously, as if it were some gentle dead thing, and turned over the  pages, and could hardly see them. Turning the pages, idly so, I came to  a leaf on which something was written with ink, in the familiar girlish  hand. It was only the words 'Dear John,' through which she had drawn two  hasty pencil lines--I wish she hadn't drawn those lines!\" added  Bladburn, under his breath.    He was silent for a minute or two, looking off towards the camps, where  the lights were fading out one by one.    \"I had no right to go and love Mary. I was twice her age, an awkward,  unsocial man, that would have blighted her youth. I was as wrong as  wrong can be. But I never meant to tell her. I locked the grammar in my  desk and the secret in my heart for a year. I couldn't bear to meet her  in the village, and kept away from every place where she was likely to  be. Then she came to me, and sat down at my feet penitently, just as she  used to do when she was a child, and asked what she had done to anger  me; and then, Heaven forgive me! I told her all, and asked her if she  could say with her lips the words she had written, and she nestled in my  arms all a-trembling like a bird, and said them over and over again.    \"When Mary's family heard of our engagement, there was trouble. They  looked higher for Mary than a middle-aged schoolmaster. No blame to  them. They forbade me the house, her uncles; but we met in the village  and at the neighbors' houses, and I was happy, knowing she loved me.  Matters were in this state when the war came on. I had a strong call to  look after the old flag, and I hung my head that day when the company  raised in our village marched by the schoolhouse to the railroad  station; but I couldn't tear myself away. About this time the minister's  son, who had been away to college, came to the village. He met Mary here  and there, and they became great friends. He was a likely fellow, near  her own age, and it was natural they should like one another. Sometimes  I winced at seeing him made free of the home from which I was shut out;  then I would open the grammar at the leaf where 'Dear John' was written  up in the corner, and my trouble was gone. Mary was sorrowful and pale  these days, and I think her people were worrying her.    \"It was one evening two or three days before we got the news of Bull  Run. I had gone down to the burying-ground to trim the spruce hedge set  round the old man's lot, and was just stepping into the enclosure, when  I heard voices from the opposite side. One was Mary's, and the other I  knew to be young Marston's, the minister's son. I didn't mean to listen,  but what Mary was saying struck me dumb. _We must never meet again_, she  was saying in a wild way. _We must say good-by here, forever,--good-by,  good-by!_ And I could hear her sobbing. Then, presently, she said,  hurriedly, _No, no; my hand, not my lips_! Then it seemed he kissed her  hands, and the two parted, one going towards the parsonage, and the  other out by the gate near where I stood.    \"I don't know how long I stood there, but the night-dews had wet me to  the bone when I stole out of the graveyard and across the road to the  schoolhouse. I unlocked the door, and took the Latin grammar from the  desk and hid it in my bosom. There was not a sound or a light anywhere  as I walked out of the village. And now,\" said Bladburn, rising suddenly  from the tree-trunk, \"if the little book ever falls in your way, won't  you see that it comes to no harm, for my sake, and for the sake of the  little woman who was true to me and didn't love me? Wherever she is  to-night, God bless her!\"           *       *       *       *       *    As we descended to camp with our arms resting on each other's shoulder,  the watch-fires were burning low in the valleys and along the hillsides,  and as far as the eye could reach, the silent tents lay bleaching in the  moonlight.      III    We imagined that the throwing forward of our brigade was the initial  movement of a general advance of the army: but that, as the reader will  remember, did not take place until the following March. The Confederates  had fallen back to Centreville without firing a shot, and the National  troops were in possession of Lewinsville, Vienna, and Fairfax  Court-House. Our new position was nearly identical with that which we  had occupied on the night previous to the battle of Bull Run,--on the  old turnpike road to Manassas, where the enemy was supposed to be in  great force. With a field-glass we could see the Rebel pickets moving in  a belt of woodland on our right, and morning and evening we heard the  spiteful roll of their snare-drums.    Those pickets soon became a nuisance to us. Hardly a night passed but  they fired upon our outposts, so far with no harmful result; but after a  while it grew to be a serious matter. The Rebels would crawl out on  all-fours from the wood into a field covered with underbrush, and lie  there in the dark for hours, waiting for a shot. Then our men took to  the rifle-pits,--pits ten or twelve feet long by four or five feet deep,  with the loose earth banked up a few inches high on the exposed sides.  All the pits bore names, more or less felicitous, by which they were  known to their transient tenants. One was called \"The Pepper-Box,\"  another \"Uncle Sam's Well,\" another \"The Reb-Trap,\" and another, I am  constrained to say, was named after a not to be mentioned tropical  locality. Though this rude sort of nomenclature predominated, there was  no lack of softer titles, such as \"Fortress Matilda\" and \"Castle Mary,\"  and one had, though unintentionally, a literary flavor to it, \"Blair's  Grave,\" which was not popularly considered as reflecting unpleasantly on  Nat Blair, who had assisted in making the excavation.    Some of the regiment had discovered a field of late corn in the  neighborhood, and used to boil a few ears"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17162"],[0,"Mother Stories from the Old Testament (#7)"],[1,"id, and offered to go out  against him. Saul was informed of David's offer, and sent for him.  Saul told David he was not able to fight the giant, but he boldly  replied, \"The Lord which delivered me out of the paw of the lion and  out of the paw of the bear, He will deliver me out of the hand of this  Philistine.\" David trusted not in his own power, but in God! Then Saul  said, \"Go, and the Lord be with thee.\"    He went, slung one of the smooth stones he had chosen out of the  brook, smote the Philistine in the forehead so that he fell to the  earth, and then ran and cut off his head. Thus God enabled this ruddy  youth to overcome the giant Philistine, and to slay him with a sling  and a stone.    [Illustration: CHOOSING SMOOTH STONES OUT OF THE BROOK.]          NATHAN REPROVING THE KING.      David was now King. He had great riches and honour, and a palace had  been built for him. He had brought the ark from Kirjath-jearim, and  placed it in the tabernacle prepared for it at Jerusalem, and he now  reigned over all the people of Israel and Judah. But David did a very  wicked thing. He took the wife of Uriah the Hittite for his wife, and  caused Uriah to be slain. God was displeased at what he had done, and  sent Nathan the prophet to reprove him.    Nathan's reproof was given by a parable. It was a story of a poor man  who had one dear little lamb. It grew up in his house, played with his  children, and was very precious to him. But one day a traveller came  to a rich neighbour, who possessed great flocks and herds, and this  neighbour, instead of killing one of his own lambs and setting it  before his guest, sent and took the poor man's lamb and killed it.    David heard the story, and was very angry. He said the rich man should  die, and the lamb taken away should be restored fourfold. Then Nathan,  looking at the King, said: \"Thou art the man!\" He showed David how  greatly he had sinned, and told him that trouble and sorrow would come  upon him for what he had done. God had given him riches and honour,  and all that he could wish for; yet he had taken the one precious  thing of Uriah's, even his wife, and had caused him to be slain. David  was sorely grieved when he saw how wickedly he had acted. He confessed  his sin to God, and God forgave it; but great trouble came upon the  King afterwards through this crime.    [Illustration: \"THOU ART THE MAN.\"]          DAVID AND ARAUNAH.      After David had reigned may years, he numbered the people of Israel.  This was wrong; and God sent a pestilence which destroyed seventy  thousand men. David was grieved, and prayed that God would punish him  and spare the people. God stayed the hand of the destroying angel; who  stood by the threshing-floor of Araunah, whither David was told to go  and offer sacrifice. David went. He purchased the threshing-floor of  Araunah, also oxen and wood and offered a burnt sacrifice to God. The  following verses describe the scene:--        Beside Araunah's threshing-place      The awful angel took his stand,      When from high heaven came words of grace--      \"It is enough; stay now thine hand.\"        For David's penitential prayer      Had enter'd God's compassionate ear;      And where the angel stood, even there      God bade the King and altar rear.        Araunah offered ground, and wood,      And oxen for the sacrifice:      David stood noble wish withstood,      And bought them all at full price.        His answer has a royal ring;      Its lesson high shall not be lost:      \"Burnt offerings I will never bring      Unto Jehovah without cost.\"        The altar rose, the victims died,      The plague was stayed, and lo, there fell--      Token that Heaven was satisfied--      A fire from God, and all was well.        'Twas like a finger from the skies--      That falling fire--to show God's will,      That here the Temple should arise      And crown Moriah's sacred hill.        And still God marks the faithful prayer,      The careful work, the costly pains;      The Spirit's fire descendeth there,      And there, as in a shrine, remains.            RICHARD WILTON, M.A.    [Illustration: DAVID AND ARAUNAH.]          ELIJAH FED BY RAVENS.      God was displeased with King Ahab, and sent His prophet, Elijah the  Tishbite, to say unto him, \"As the Lord God of Israel liveth there  shall not be dew nor rain for years in all Israel.\" God knew that  these words would make Ahab angry with Elijah, so He commanded Elijah  to get out of Ahab's way. \"Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and  hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan. And it shall  be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the  ravens to feed thee there.\"    Elijah went, and the ravens brought him bread and meat, morning and  evening, and he drank of the brook. But after many days the brook  dried up, and God told him to go to Zarephath, where a widow would  sustain him. So he arose and went to Zarephath. When he came to the  gate of the city he saw the widow gathering sticks; and called to her,  saying, \"Bring me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may  drink, and a morsel of bread in thy hand, that I may eat.\"    The widow turned and said, \"As the Lord thy God liveth, I have not a  cake, but only a handful of meal, and a little oil in a cruse; and,  behold, I am gathering a few sticks, that I may go in and bake it for  me and my son, that we may eat it before we starve to death.\" Elijah  told her not to fear, but to make a cake for him, and, afterwards, one  for her son and herself, for God had said that neither her handful of  meal nor her cruse of oil should fail until He again sent rain upon  the earth. So she did as Elijah told her, and there was always enough  oil and meal for their daily food, according to the word of the Lord  which He spake by Elijah.    [Illustration: ELIJAH FED BY RAVENS.]          PLOUGHING IN CANAAN.      In Scripture frequent mention is made of the husbandman and his work.  Ploughing the land, sowing the seed, reaping the harvest, and  winnowing the grain are often referred to. Our picture shows an  Eastern husbandman ploughing. How different it is to ploughing in our  own land! There is no _coulter_; and instead of the broad steel  _plough-share_ we see a pointed piece of wood. And the long handles  with which our labourers guide their ploughs--where are they? The  strong horses, too, harnessed one behind the other, are missing. Yes!  none of these were used in Canaan. Small oxen drew the plough; and the  husbandman guided it by means of a single handle, as we see him doing  in the picture. Thus their method of ploughing was a slow one, and  unless the land had been very good their harvests would have been  poor.    Often these husbandmen had to wait until the rain made the ground soft  enough for their ploughs to enter it, consequently many had to toil in  cold, stormy, winter weather. To this the proverb alludes which says:  \"The sluggard will not plough by reason of the cold; therefore shall  he beg in harvest, and have nothing.\" (Prov. xx. 4.)    Perhaps it was just such a plough, drawn by just such oxen as we see  in our picture, that Elisha was using when Elijah passed by and cast  his mantle upon him; thereby calling Elisha to be his servant and  successor. We are told that Elisha \"took a yoke of oxen, and slew  them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and  gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after  Elijah, and ministered unto him.\"    [Illustration: PLOUGHING IN CANAAN.]          THE SHUNAMMITE'S SON.      Many interesting stories are told in the Bible, few of which are more  touching than that of Elisha the prophet, and the Shunammite woman.  This story we find in the fourth chapter of the Second Book of Kings.    We read of the prophet journeying to and fro, and resting in the  little chamber that the kind Shunammite had built for him on the wall  of her house. We see its bed, table, stool, and candlestick; and the  joy beaming upon the good woman's face when a tiny infant son was  given her. How she loved him! And as he grew up how carefully she  watched over him. But a sad time was coming.    The golden corn was in the field ready for reaping, for the harvest  time had come. The hot sun shone overhead, and the little lad was out  with his father in the field, probably running about among the corn.  Suddenly he felt a violent pain, and cried out, \"My head, my head!\"  Then joy was changed to sorrow. The father saw his son was ill, and  bade a lad carry the little boy to his mother, on whose knees he sat  till noon, and then he died.    Next we see the mother leaving her dead son, and journeying to find  the prophet. Elisha sees her coming, and sends Gehazi to inquire if  all is well. Then she falls down before the prophet and tells him her  trouble; and he sends his servant with his staff to lay it upon the  dead child. The story closes by stating how Elisha follows Gehazi,  goes to the chamber where the dead boy lay, prays to God that the life  may be restored, and finally has the joy of giving the lad, alive and  well again, into the arms of his mother.    [Illustration: THE SHUNAMMITE'S SON RESTORED.]          THE LITTLE CAPTIVE MAID.      Naaman was a great general in the army of the King of Syria, who  esteemed him highly, because it was Naaman that led the Syrians when  God gave them victory over the Israelites. But in spite of his bravery  and his high position, he was miserable, because he suffered from a  terrible disease called leprosy. Now, among the captives whom the  Syrians had brought back from war was a little Israelitish maiden, who  was appointed to wait upon Naaman's wife. She had heard of the  wonderful things which Elisha did in the name of God; and she told her  mistress that if Naaman could only see this prophet, who was in  Samaria, he could be cured. And the King was told what the maid had  said, and he"]]]
