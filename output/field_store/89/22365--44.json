From that day he was treated as  an equal by father and daughter. The many servants were commanded to  obey his slightest whim, to serve him with the most expensive food on  the market, to spare no expense in making him the happiest and best-fed  dog in all the world. Day after day he ran at Honeysuckle's side as she  gathered flowers in her garden, lay down before her door when she was  resting, guarded her Sedan chair when she was carried by servants into  the city. In short, they were constant companions; a stranger would have  thought they had been friends from childhood.    One day, however, just as they were returning from a journey outside her  father's compound, at the very instant when Honeysuckle was alighting  from her chair, without a moment's warning, the huge animal dashed past  the attendants, seized his beautiful mistress in his mouth, and before  anyone could stop him, bore her off to the mountains. By the time the  alarm was sounded, darkness had fallen over the valley and as the night  was cloudy no trace could be found of the dog and his fair burden.    Once more the frantic father left no stone unturned to save his  daughter. Huge rewards were offered, bands of woodmen scoured the  mountains high and low, but, alas, no sign of the girl could be found!  The unfortunate father gave up the search and began to prepare himself  for the grave. There was nothing now left in life that he cared  for--nothing but thoughts of his departed daughter. Honeysuckle was gone  for ever.    \"Alas!\" said he, quoting the lines of a famous poet who had fallen into  despair:        \"My whiting hair would make an endless rope,    Yet would not measure all my depth of woe.\"      Several long years passed by; years of sorrow for the ageing man, pining  for his departed daughter. One beautiful October day he was sitting in  the very same pavilion where he had so often sat with his darling. His  head was bowed forward on his breast, his forehead was lined with grief.  A rustling of leaves attracted his attention. He looked up. Standing  directly in front of him was Dr. Dog, and lo, riding on his back,  clinging to the animal's shaggy hair, was Honeysuckle, his long-lost  daughter; while standing near by were three of the handsomest boys he  had ever set eyes upon!    \"Ah, my daughter! My darling daughter, where have you been all these  years?\" cried the delighted father, pressing the girl to his aching  breast. \"Have you suffered many a cruel pain since you were snatched  away so suddenly? Has your life been filled with sorrow?\"    \"Only at the thought of your grief,\" she replied, tenderly, stroking  his forehead with her slender fingers; \"only at the thought of your  suffering; only at the thought of how I should like to see you every day  and tell you that my husband was kind and good to me. For you must know,  dear father, this is no mere animal that stands beside you. This Dr.  Dog, who cured me and claimed me as his bride because of your promise,  is a great magician. He can change himself at will into a thousand  shapes. He chooses to come here in the form of a mountain beast so that  no one may penetrate the secret of his distant palace.\"    \"Then he is your husband?\" faltered the old man, gazing at the animal  with a new expression on his wrinkled face.    \"Yes; my kind and noble husband, the father of my three sons, your  grandchildren, whom we have brought to pay you a visit.\"    \"And where do you live?\"    \"In a wonderful cave in the heart of the great mountains; a beautiful  cave whose walls and floors are covered with crystals, and encrusted  with sparkling gems. The chairs and tables are set with jewels; the  rooms are lighted by a thousand glittering diamonds. Oh, it is lovelier  than the palace of the Son of Heaven himself! We feed of the flesh of  wild deer and mountain goats, and fish from the clearest mountain  stream. We drink cold water out of golden goblets, without first boiling  it, for it is purity itself. We breathe fragrant air that blows through  forests of pine and hemlock. We live only to love each other and our  children, and oh, we are so happy! And you, father, you must come back  with us to the great mountains and live there with us the rest of your  days, which, the gods grant, may be very many.\"    [Illustration: \"CLINGING TO THE ANIMAL'S SHAGGY HAIR WAS HONEYSUCKLE\"]    The old man pressed his daughter once more to his breast and fondled the  children, who clambered over him rejoicing at the discovery of a  grandfather they had never seen before.    From Dr. Dog and his fair Honeysuckle are sprung, it is said, the  well-known race of people called the Yus, who even now inhabit the  mountainous regions of the Canton and Hunan provinces. It is not for  this reason, however, that we have told the story here, but because we  felt sure every reader would like to learn the secret of the dog that  cured a sick girl and won her for his bride.          HOW FOOTBINDING STARTED    [Illustration]      In the very beginning of all things, when the gods were creating the  world, at last the time came to separate the earth from the heavens.  This was hard work, and if it had not been for the coolness and skill of  a young goddess all would have failed. This goddess was named Lu-o. She  had been idly watching the growth of the planet, when, to her horror,  she saw the newly made ball slipping slowly from its place. In another  second it would have shot down into the bottomless pit. Quick as a flash  Lu-o stopped it with her magic wand and held it firmly until the chief  god came dashing up to the rescue.    But this was not all. When men and women were put on the earth Lu-o  helped them greatly by setting an example of purity and kindness. Every  one loved her and pointed her out as the one who was always willing to  do a good deed. After she had left the world and gone into the land of  the gods, beautiful statues of her were set up in many temples to keep  her image always before the eyes of sinful people. The greatest of these  was in the capital city. Thus, when sorrowful women wished to offer up  their prayers to some virtuous goddess they would go to a temple of Lu-o  and pour out their hearts before her shrine.    At one time the wicked Chow-sin, last ruler of the Yins, went to pray in  the city Temple. There his royal eyes were captivated by the sight of a  wonderful face, the beauty of which was so great that he fell in love  with it at once, telling his ministers that he wished he might take this  goddess, who was no other than Lu-o, for one of his wives.    Now Lu-o was terribly angry that an earthly prince should dare to make  such a remark about her. Then and there she determined to punish the  Emperor. Calling her assistant spirits, she told them of Chow-sin's  insult. Of all her servants the most cunning was one whom we shall call  Fox Sprite, because he really belonged to the fox family. Lu-o ordered  Fox Sprite to spare himself no trouble in making the wicked ruler suffer  for his impudence.    For many days, try as he would, Chow-sin, the great Son of Heaven, could  not forget the face he had seen in the temple.    \"He is stark mad,\" laughed his courtiers behind his back, \"to fall in  love with a statue.\"    \"I must find a woman just like her,\" said the Emperor, \"and take her to  wife.\"    \"Why not, most Mighty One,\" suggested a favourite adviser, \"send forth a  command throughout the length and breadth of your Empire, that no maiden  shall be taken in marriage until you have chosen yourself a wife whose  beauty shall equal that of Lu-o?\"    Chow-sin was pleased with this suggestion and doubtless would have  followed it had not his Prime Minister begged him to postpone issuing  the order. \"Your Imperial Highness,\" began the official, \"since you have  been pleased once or twice to follow my counsel, I beg of you to give  ear now to what I say.\"    \"Speak, and your words shall have my best attention,\" replied Chow-sin,  with a gracious wave of the hand.    \"Know then, Great One, that in the southern part of your realm there  dwells a viceroy whose bravery has made him famous in battle.\"    \"Are you speaking of Su-nan?\" questioned Chow-sin, frowning, for this  Su-nan had once been a rebel.    \"None other, mighty Son of Heaven. Famous is he as a soldier, but his  name is now even greater in that he is the father of the most beautiful  girl in all China. This lovely flower that has bloomed of late within  his household is still unmarried. Why not order her father to bring her  to the palace that you may wed her and place her in your royal  dwelling?\"    \"And are you sure of this wondrous beauty you describe so prettily?\"  asked the ruler, a smile of pleasure lighting up his face.    \"So sure that I will stake my head on your being satisfied.\"    \"Enough! I command you at once to summon the viceroy and his daughter.  Add the imperial seal to the message.\"    The Prime Minister smilingly departed to give the order. In his heart he  was more than delighted that the Emperor had accepted his suggestion,  for Su-nan, the viceroy, had long been his chief enemy, and he planned  in this way to overthrow him. The viceroy, as he knew, was a man of  iron. He would certainly not feel honoured at the thought of having his  daughter enter the Imperial Palace as a secondary wife. Doubtless he  would refuse to obey the order and would thus bring about his own  immediate downfall.    Nor was the Prime Minister mistaken. When Su-nan received the imperial  message his heart was hot with anger against his sovereign. To be robbed  of his lovely Ta-ki, even by the throne, was, in his eyes, a terrible  disgrace.

He locked the door  almost instinctively, and then, when he heard me hammering at it, went  out of the window.\"    \"Y-yes. Well, that sounds reasonable enough. What do you say, Mr.  Gillingham?\"    \"I should hardly call it 'reasonable' to lose your head,\" said Antony,  getting up from his chair and coming towards them.    \"Well, you know what I mean. It explains things.\"    \"Oh, yes. Any other explanation would make them much more complicated.\"    \"Have you any other explanation?\"    \"Not I.\"    \"Are there any points on which you would like to correct Mr.  Cayley?--anything that he left out after you arrived here?\"    \"No, thanks. He described it all very accurately.\"    \"Ah! Well now, about yourself. You're not staying in the house, I  gather?\"    Antony explained his previous movements.    \"Yes. Did you hear the shot?\"    Antony put his head on one side, as if listening. \"Yes. Just as I came  in sight of the house. It didn't make any impression at the time, but I  remember it now.\"    \"Where were you then?\"    \"Coming up the drive. I was just in sight of the house.\"    \"Nobody left the house by the front door after the shot?\"    Antony closed his eyes and considered.    \"Nobody,\" he said. \"No.\"    \"You're certain of that?\"    \"Absolutely,\" said Antony, as though rather surprised that he could be  suspected of a mistake.    \"Thank you. You're at 'The George,' if I want you?\"    \"Mr. Gillingham is staying here until after the inquest,\" explained  Cayley.    \"Good. Well now, about these servants?\"          CHAPTER V. Mr. Gillingham Chooses a New Profession      As Cayley went over to the bell, Antony got up and moved to the door.    \"Well, you won't want me, I suppose, inspector,\" he said.    \"No, thank you, Mr. Gillingham. You'll be about, of course?\"    \"Oh, yes.\"    The inspector hesitated.    \"I think, Mr. Cayley, it would be better if I saw the servants alone.  You know what they are; the more people about, the more they get  alarmed. I expect I can get at the truth better by myself.\"    \"Oh, quite so. In fact, I was going to ask you to excuse me. I feel  rather responsible towards these guests of ours. Although Mr. Gillingham  very kindly--\" He smiled at Antony, who was waiting at the door, and  left his sentence unfinished.    \"Ah, that reminds me,\" said the Inspector. \"Didn't you say that one of  your guests--Mr. Beverley was it?--a friend of Mr. Gillingham's, was  staying on?\"    \"Yes; would you like to see him?\"    \"Afterwards, if I may.\"    \"I'll warn him. I shall be up in my room, if you want me. I have a room  upstairs where I work--any of the servants will show you. Ah, Stevens,  Inspector Birch would like to ask you a few questions.\"    \"Yes, sir,\" said Audrey primly, but inwardly fluttering. The  housekeeper's room had heard something of the news by this time, and  Audrey had had a busy time explaining to other members of the staff  exactly what he had said, and what she had said. The details were not  quite established yet, but this much at least was certain: that Mr.  Mark's brother had shot himself and spirited Mr. Mark away, and that  Audrey had seen at once that he was that sort of man when she opened  the door to him. She had passed the remark to Mrs. Stevens. And Mrs.  Stevens--if you remember, Audrey--had always said that people didn't go  away to Australia except for very good reasons. Elsie agreed with both  of them, but she had a contribution of her own to make. She had actually  heard Mr. Mark in the office, threatening his brother.    \"You mean Mr. Robert,\" said the second parlour-maid. She had been having  a little nap in her room, but she had heard the bang. In fact, it had  woken her up--just like something going off, it was.    \"It was Mr. Mark's voice,\" said Elsie firmly.    \"Pleading for mercy,\" said an eager-eyed kitchen-maid hopefully from the  door, and was hurried out again by the others, wishing that she had not  given her presence away. But it was hard to listen in silence when she  knew so well from her novelettes just what happened on these occasions.    \"I shall have to give that girl a piece of my mind,\" said Mrs. Stevens.  \"Well, Elsie?\"    \"He said, I heard him say it with my own ears, 'It's my turn now,' he  said, triumphant-like.\"    \"Well, if you think that's a threat, dear, you're very particular, I  must say.\"    But Audrey remembered Elsie's words when she was in front of Inspector  Birch. She gave her own evidence with the readiness of one who had  already repeated it several times, and was examined and cross-examined  by the Inspector with considerable skill. The temptation to say, \"Never  mind about what you said to him,\" was strong, but he resisted it,  knowing that in this way he would discover best what he said to her. By  this time both his words and the looks he gave her were getting their  full value from Audrey, but the general meaning of them seemed to be  well-established.    \"Then you didn't see Mr. Mark at all.\"    \"No, sir; he must have come in before and gone up to his room. Or come  in by the front door, likely enough, while I was going out by the back.\"    \"Yes. Well, I think that's all that I want to know, thank you very much.  Now what about the other servants?\"    \"Elsie heard the master and Mr. Robert talking together,\" said Audrey  eagerly. \"He was saying--Mr. Mark, I mean--\"    \"Ah! Well, I think Elsie had better tell me that herself. Who is Elsie,  by the way?\"    \"One of the housemaids. Shall I send her to you, sir?\"    \"Please.\"    Elsie was not sorry to get the message. It interrupted a few remarks  from Mrs. Stevens about Elsie's conduct that afternoon which were (Elsie  thought) much better interrupted. In Mrs. Stevens' opinion any crime  committed that afternoon in the office was as nothing to the double  crime committed by the unhappy Elsie.    For Elsie realized too late that she would have done better to have said  nothing about her presence in the hall that afternoon. She was bad at  concealing the truth and Mrs. Stevens was good at discovering it. Elsie  knew perfectly well that she had no business to come down the front  stairs, and it was no excuse to say that she happened to come out of  Miss Norris' room just at the head of the stairs, and didn't think it  would matter, as there was nobody in the hall, and what was she doing  anyhow in Miss Norris' room at that time? Returning a magazine? Lent by  Miss Norris, might she ask? Well, not exactly lent. Really, Elsie!--and  this in a respectable house! In vain for poor Elsie to plead that  a story by her favourite author was advertised on the cover, with a  picture of the villain falling over the cliff. \"That's where you'll go  to, my girl, if you aren't careful,\" said Mrs. Stevens firmly.    But, of course, there was no need to confess all these crimes to  Inspector Birch. All that interested him was that she was passing  through the hall, and heard voices in the office.    \"And stopped to listen?\"    \"Certainly not,\" said Elsie with dignity, feeling that nobody really  understood her. \"I was just passing through the hall, just as you might  have been yourself, and not supposing they was talking secrets, didn't  think to stop my ears, as no doubt I ought to have done.\" And she  sniffed slightly.    \"Come, come,\" said the Inspector soothingly, \"I didn't mean to  suggest--\"    \"Everyone is very unkind to me,\" said Elsie between sniffs, \"and there's  that poor man lying dead there, and sorry they'd have been, if it had  been me, to have spoken to me as they have done this day.\"    \"Nonsense, we're going to be very proud of you. I shouldn't be surprised  if your evidence were of very great importance. Now then, what was it  you heard? Try to remember the exact words.\"    Something about working in a passage, thought Elsie.    \"Yes, but who said it?\"    \"Mr. Robert.\"    \"How do you know it was Mr. Robert? Had you heard his voice before?\"    \"I don't take it upon myself to say that I had had any acquaintance with  Mr. Robert, but seeing that it wasn't Mr. Mark, nor yet Mr. Cayley, nor  any other of the gentlemen, and Miss Stevens had shown Mr. Robert into  the office not five minutes before--\"    \"Quite so,\" said the Inspector hurriedly. \"Mr. Robert, undoubtedly.  Working in a passage?\"    \"That was what it sounded like, sir.\"    \"H'm. Working a passage over--could that have been it?\"    \"That's right, sir,\" said Elsie eagerly. \"He'd worked his passage over.\"    \"Well?\"    \"And then Mr. Mark said loudly--sort of triumphant-like--'It's my turn  now. You wait.'\"    \"Triumphantly?\"    \"As much as to say his chance had come.\"    \"And that's all you heard?\"    \"That's all, sir--not standing there listening, but just passing through  the hall, as it might be any time.\"    \"Yes. Well, that's really very important, Elsie. Thank you.\"    Elsie gave him a smile, and returned eagerly to the kitchen. She was  ready for Mrs. Stevens or anybody now.    Meanwhile Antony had been exploring a little on his own. There was a  point which was puzzling him. He went through the hall to the front of  the house and stood at the open door, looking out on to the drive. He  and Cayley had run round the house to the left. Surely it would have  been quicker to have run round to the right? The front door was not in  the middle of the house, it was to the end. Undoubtedly they went the  longest way round. But perhaps there was something in the way, if one  went to the right--a wall, say. He strolled off in that direction,  followed a path round the house and came in sight of the office windows.  Quite simple, and about half the distance of the other way. He went on  a little farther, and came to a door, just beyond the broken-in windows.  It opened easily, and he found himself in a passage. At the end of the  passage was another door. He opened it and found himself in the hall  again.    \"And, of course, that's the"]]]
