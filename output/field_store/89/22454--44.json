When  made of good clay, rightly tempered with sand, and well burned, they  will in a wall remain for centuries, and as far as material is  concerned, answer all purposes. Brick walls may be thinner than stone  walls, but they equally require \"firring off\" for inside plastering, and  in addition, they need the aid of paint quite as often as wood, to give  them an agreeable color--bricks themselves not usually being in the  category of desirable colors or shades.    Wood, when abundant and easily obtained, is worked with the greatest  facility, and on many accounts, is the cheapest material, _for the  time_, of which a building can be constructed. But it is perishable. It  requires every few years a coat of paint, and is always associated with  the idea of decay. Yet wood may be moulded into an infinite variety of  form to please the eye, in the indulgence of any peculiar taste or  fancy.    We cannot, in the consideration of material for house-building  therefore, urge upon the farmer the adoption of either of the above  named materials to the preference of another, in any particular  structure he may require; but leave him to consult his own circumstances  in regard to them, as best he may. But this we will say: _If it be  possible_, never lay a _cellar_ or underground wall of perishable  material, such as wood or soft bricks; nor build with soft or _unburnt_  bricks in a wall exposed to the weather _anywhere;_ nor with stone which  is liable to crumble or disintegrate by the action of frost or water  upon it. We are aware that unburnt bricks have been strongly recommended  for house-building in America; but from observation, we are fully  persuaded that they are worthless for any _permanent_ structure, and if  used, will in the end prove a dead loss in their application. Cottages,  out-buildings, and other cheap erections on the farm, for the  accommodation of laborers, stock, or crops, may be made of wood, where  wood is the cheapest and most easily obtained; and, even taking its  perishable nature into account, it may be the most economical. In their  construction, it may be simply a matter of calculation with him who  needs them, to calculate the first cost of any material he has at hand,  or may obtain, and to that add the interest upon it, the annual wear and  tear, the insurance, and the period it may last, to determine this  matter to his entire satisfaction--always provided he have the means at  hand to do either. But other considerations generally control the  American farmer. His pocket is apt more often to be pinched, than his  choice is to be at fault; and this weighty argument compels him into the  \"make shift\" system, which perhaps in its results, provided the main  chance be attained, is quite as advantageous to his interests as the  other.    As a general remark, all buildings should show for themselves, what they  are built of. Let stone be stone; bricks show on their own account; and  of all things, put no counterfeit by way of plaster, stucco, or other  false pretence other than paint, or a durable wash upon wood: it is a  miserable affectation always, and of no possible use whatever. All  counterfeit of any kind as little becomes the buildings of the farmer,  as the gilded _pinchbeck_ watch would fit the finished attire of a  gentleman.    Before submitting the several designs proposed for this work, it may be  remarked, that in addressing them to a climate strictly American, we  have in every instance adopted the wide, steeply-pitched roof, with  broad eaves, gables and cornices, as giving protection, shade, and  shelter to the walls; thus keeping them dry and in good preservation,  and giving that well housed, and comfortable expression, so different  from the stiff, pinched, and tucked-up look in which so many of the  haberdasher-built houses of the present day exult.    We give some examples of the hipped roof, because they are convenient  and cheap in their construction; and we also throw into the designs a  lateral direction to the roofs of the wings, or connecting parts of the  building. This is sometimes done for effect in architectural appearance,  and sometimes for the economy and advantage of the building itself.  Where roofs thus intersect or connect with a side wall, the connecting  gutters should be made of copper, zinc, lead, galvanized iron, or tin,  into which the shingles, if they be covered with that material, should  be laid so as to effectually prevent leakage. The _eave gutters_ should  be of copper, zinc, lead, galvanized iron or tin, also, and placed _at  least_ one foot back from the edge of the roof, and lead the water into  conductors down the wall into the cistern or elsewhere, as may be  required. If the water be not needed, and the roof be wide over the  walls, there is no objection to let it pass off naturally, if it be no  inconvenience to the ground below, and can run off, or be absorbed into  the ground without detriment to the cellar walls. All this must be  subject to the judgment of the proprietor himself.          OUTSIDE COLOR.      We are not among those who cast off, and on a sudden condemn, as out of  all good taste, the time-honored white house with its green blinds,  often so tastefully gleaming out from beneath the shade of summer trees;  nor do we doggedly adhere to it, except when in keeping, by contrast or  otherwise, with everything around it. For a century past white has been  the chief color of our wooden houses, and often so of brick ones, in the  United States. This color has been supposed to be strong and durable,  being composed chiefly of white lead; and as it _reflected_ the rays of  the sun instead of _absorbing_ them, as some of the darker colors do, it  was thus considered a better preserver of the weather-boarding from the  cracks which the fervid heat of the sun is apt to make upon it, than the  darker colors. White, consequently, has always been considered, until  within a few years past, as a fitting and _tasteful_ color for  dwellings, both in town and country. A new school of _taste_ in colors  has risen, however, within a few years past, among us; about the same  time, too, that the recent gingerbread and beadwork style of country  building was introduced. And these were both, as all _new_ things are  apt to be, carried to extremes. Instead of _toning_ down the glare of  the white into some quiet, neutral shade, as a straw color; a drab of  different hues--always an agreeable and appropriate color for a  dwelling, particularly when the door and window casings are dressed with  a deeper or lighter shade, as those shades predominate in the main body  of the house; or a natural and soft _wood_ color, which also may be of  various shades; or even the warm russet hue of some of our rich  stones--quite appropriate, too, as applied to wood, or bricks--the  _fashion_ must be followed without either rhyme or reason, and hundreds  of our otherwise pretty and imposing country houses have been daubed  over with the dirtiest, gloomiest pigment imaginable, making every  habitation which it touched look more like a funeral appendage than a  cheerful, life-enjoying home. We candidly say that we have no sort of  affection for such sooty daubs. The fashion which dictates them is a  barbarous, false, and arbitrary fashion; void of all natural taste in  its inception; and to one who has a cheerful, life-loving spirit about  him, such colors have no more fitness on his dwelling or out-buildings,  than a tomb would have in his lawn or dooryard.    Locality, amplitude of the buildings, the purpose to which they are  applied--every consideration connected with them, in fact, should be  consulted, as to color. Stone will give its own color; which, by the  way, some prodigiously smart folks _paint_--quite as decorous or  essential, as to \"paint the lily.\" Brick sometimes must be painted, but  it should be of a color in keeping with its character,--of substance and  dignity; not a counterfeit of stone, or to cheat him who looks upon it  into a belief that it may be marble, or other unfounded pretension.  A _warm_ russet is most appropriate for brick-work of any kind of  color--the color of a russet apple, or undressed leather--shades that  comport with Milton's beautiful idea of      \"_Russet_ lawns and fallows _gray_.\"    Red and yellow are both too glaring, and slate, or lead colors too  somber and cold. It is, in fact, a strong argument in favor of bricks in  building, where they can be had as cheap as stone or wood, that any  color can be given to them which the good taste of the builder may  require, in addition to their durability, which, when made of good  material, and properly burned, is quite equal to stone. In a wooden  structure one may play with his fancy in the way of color, minding in  the operation, that he does not play the mountebank, and like the clown  in the circus, make his tattooed tenement the derision of men of correct  taste, as the other does his burlesque visage the ridicule of his  auditors.    A _wooden_ country house, together with its out-buildings, should always  be of a cheerful and softly-toned color--a color giving a feeling of  warmth and comfort; nothing glaring or flashy about it. And yet, such  buildings should not, in their color, any more than in their  architecture, appear as if _imitating_ either stone or brick. Wood, of  itself, is light. One cannot build a _heavy_ house of wood, as compared  with brick or stone. Therefore all imitation or device which may lead to  a belief that it may be other than what it really is, is nothing less  than a fraud--not criminal, we admit, but none the less a fraud upon  good taste and architectural truth.    It is true that in this country we cannot afford to place in stone and  brick buildings those ornate trimmings and appendages which, perhaps, if  economy were not to be consulted, might be more durably constructed of  stone, but at an expense too great to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/200"],[0,"The Project Gutenberg Encyclopedia, Volume 1 of 28 (#7)"],[1,"him the Commercium Epistolicum, said, ``You are  well worthy to judge between Leibnitz and me.'' The reputation  of Abauzit induced William III. to request him to settle in  England, but he did not accept the king's offer, preferring  to return to Geneva.  There from 1715 he rendered valuable  assistance to a society that had been formed for translating  the New Testament into French.  He declined the offer of  the chair of philosophy in the university in 1723, but  accepted, in 1727, the sinecure office of librarian to the  city of his adoption.  Here he died at a good old age, in  1767.  Abauzit was a man of great learning and of wonderful  versatility.  Whatever chanced to be discussed,it used to be  said of Abauzit, as of Professor W. Whewell of more modern  times, that he seemed to have made it a subject of particular  study.  Rousseau, who was jealously sparing of his praises,  addressed to him, in his Nouvelle Heloise, a fine panegyric;  and when a stranger flatteringly told Voltaire he had come  to see a great man, the philosopher asked him if he had seen  Abauzit.  Little remains of the labours of this intellectual  giant, his heirs having, it is said, destroyed the papers  that came into their possession, because their own religious  opinions were different.  A few theological, archaeological  abd astronomical articles from his pen appeared in the  Journal Helvetique and elsewhere, and he contributed  several papers to Rousseau's Dictionnaire de musique  (1767).  He wrote a work throwing doubt on the canonical  authority of the Apocalypse, which called forth a reply  from Dr Leonard Twells.  He also edited and made valuable  additions to J. Spon's Histoire de la republique de Geneve.  A collection of his writings was published at Geneva in  1770 (OEuvres de feu M. Abauzit), and another at London  in 1773 (OEuvres diverses de M. Abauzit). Some of them  were translated into English by Dr Edward Harwood (1774).    Information regarding Abauzit will be found in J.  Senebier's HIstoire Litteraire de Geneve, Harwood's  Miscellanies, and W. Orme's Bibliotheca Biblica (1824).    'ABAYE, the name of a Babylonian 'amora (q.v.),  born in the middle of the 3rd century.  He died in 339.    'ABBA 'ARIKA, the name of thc Babylonian 'amora (q.v.) of  the 3rd century, who established at Sura the systematic study  of the Rabbinic traditions which, using the Mishnah as text, led  to the compilation of the Talmud.  He is commonly known as Rab.    ABBADIDES, a Mahommedan dynasty which arose in Spain on the  downfall of the western caliphate.  It lasted from about 1023  till 1091, but during the short period of its existence was  singularly active and typical of its time.  The founder of  the house was Abd-ul-Qasim Mahommed, the cadi of Seville in  1023.  He was the chief of an Arab family settled in the city  from the first days of the conquest.  The Beni-abbad were not  of ancient descent, though the poets, whom they paid largely,  made an illustrious pedigree for them when they had become  powerful.  They were, however, very rich.  Abd-ul-Qasim gained  the confidence of the townsmen by organizing a successful  resistance to the Berber soldiers of fortune who were grasping  at the fragments of the caliphate.  At first he professed to  rule only with the advice of a council formed of the nobles,  but when his power became established he dispensed with this  show of republican government, and then gave himself the  appearance of a legitimate title by protecting an impostor  who professed to be the caliph Hisham II. When Abd-ul-Qasim  died in 1042 he had created a state which, though weak in  itself, was strong as compared to the little powers about  it.  He had made his family the recognized leaders of the  Mahommedans of Arab and native Spanish descent against  the Berber element, whose chief was the king of Granada.  Abbad, surnamed El Motaddid, his son and successor, is  one of the most remarkable figures in Spanish Mahommedan  history.  He had a striking resemblance to the Italian princes  of the later middle ages and the early renaissance, of the  stamp of Fiiipo Maria Visconti.  El Motaddid was a poet and  a lover of letters, who was also a poisoner, a drinker of  wine, a sceptic and treacherous to the utmost degree.  Though  he waged war all through his reign he very rarely appeared in  the field, but directed the generals, whom he never trusted,  from his ``lair'' in the fortified palace, the Alcazar of  Seville.  He killed with his own hand one of his sons who had  rebelled against him.  On one occasion he trapped a number  of his enemies, the Berber chiefs of the Ronda, into visiting  him, and got rid of them by smothering them in the hot room  of a bath.  It was his taste to preserve the skulls of the  enemies he had killed--those of the meaner men to be used as  flower-pots, while those of the princes were kept in special  chests.  His reign until his death on the 28th of February  1069 was mainly spent in extending his power at the expense  of his smaller neighbours, and in conflicts with his chief  rival the king of Granada.  These incessant wars weakened the  Mahommedans, to the great advantage of the rising power of  the Christian kings of Leon and Castile, but they gave the  kingdom of Seville a certain superiority over the other little  states.  After 1063 he was assailed by Fernando El Magno of  Castile and Leon, who marched to the gates of Seville, and  forced him to pay tribute.  His son, Mahommed Abd-ul-Qasim  Abenebet---who reigned by the title of El Motamid--was the  third and last of the Abbadides, He was a no less remarkable  person than his father and much more amiable.  Like him he was  a poet, and a favourer of poets.  El Motamid went, however,  considerably further in patronage of literature than his father,  for he chose as his favourite and prime minister the poet Ibn  Ammar.  In the end the vanity and featherheadedness of Ibn  Ammar drove his master to kill him.  El Motamid was even  more influenced by his favourite wife, Romaica, than by his  vizir.  He had met her paddling in the Guadalquivir, purchased  her from her master, and made her his wife.  The caprices  of Romaica, and the lavish extravagance of Motamid in his  efforts to please her, form the subject of many stories.  In politics he carried on the feuds of his family with the  Berbers, and in his efforts to extend his dominions could be  as faithless as his father.  His wars and his extravagance  exhausted his treasury, and he oppressed his subjects by  taxes.  In 1080 he brought down upon himself the vengeance of  Alphonso VI. of Castile by a typical piece of flighty oriental  barbarity.  He had endeavoured to pay part of his tribute to the  Christian king with false money.  The fraud was detected by a  Jew, who was one of the envoys of Alphonso.  El Motamid, in  a moment of folly and rage, crucified the Jew and imprisoned  the Christian members of the mission.  Alphonso retaliated  by a destructive raid.  When Alphonso took Toledo in 1085,  El Motamid called in Yusef ibn Tashfin, the Almoravide (see  SPAIN, History, and ALMORAVIDES). During the six years  which preceded his deposition in 1091, El Motamid behaved  with valour on the field, but with much meanness and political  folly.  He endeavoured to curry favour with Yusef by betraying  the other Mahommedan princes to him, and intrigued to secure  the alliance of Alphonso against the Almoravide.  It was  probably during this period that he surrendered his beautiful  daughter Zaida to the Christian king, who made her his  concubine, and is said by some authorities to have married  her after she bore him a son, Sancho.  The vacillations and  submissions of El Motamid did not save him from the fate  which overtook his fellow-princes.  Their scepticism and  extortion had tired their subjects, and the mullahs gave Yusef  a ``fetva'' authorzing him to remove them in the interest of  religion.  In 1091 the Almoravides stormed Seville.  El  Motamid, who had fought bravely, was weak enough to order his  sons to surrender the fortresses they still held, in order  to save his own life.  He died in prison in Africa in 1095.    AUTHORITIES.--Dozy, Histoire des Musulmans d'Espagne,  Leiden, 1861; and Historia Abbadidarum (Scriptorum  Arabum loci de Abbadidio), Leiden, 1846. (D. II.)    ABBADIE, ANTOINE THOMSON D', (1810-1897), and ARNAUD MICHEL  D', (1815-1893), two brothers notable for their travels in  Abyssinia during the first half of the 19th century.  They  were both born in Dublin, of a French father and an Irish  mother, Antoine in 1810 and Arnaud in 1815.  The parents  removed to France in 1818, and there the brothers received  a careful scientific education.  In 1835 the French Academy  sent Antoine on a scientific mission to Brazil, the results  being published at a later date (1873) under the title of  Observations relatives a! la physique du globe faites au  Bresil et en Ethiopie. The younger Abbadie spent some  time in Algeria before, in 1837, the two brothers started for  Abyssinia, landing at Massawa in February 1838.  They visited  various parts of Abyssinia, including the then little-known  districts of Ennarea and Kaffa, sometimes together and  sometimes separately.  They met with many difficulties and  many adventures, and became involved in political intrigues,  Antoine especially exercising such influence as he possessed  in favour of France and the Roman Catholic missionaries.  After  collecting much valuable information concerning the geography,  geology, archaeology and natural history of Abyssinia, the  brothers returned to France in 1848 and began to prepare their  materials for publication.  The younger brother, Arnaud, paid  another visit to Abyssinia in 1853.  The more distinguished  brother, Antoine, became involved in various controversies  relating both to his geographical results and his political  intrigues.  He was especially attacked by C. T."]]]
