And among the teachings of Baha'u'llah is the promotion of education.  Every child must be instructed in sciences as much as is necessary. If the  parents are able to provide the expenses of this education, it is all  right; otherwise the community must provide the means for the teaching of  that child.    And among the teachings of His Holiness Baha'u'llah are justice and right.  Until these are realized on the plane of existence, all things will be in  disorder and remain imperfect. The world of mankind is a world of  oppression and cruelty, and a realm of aggression and error.    In fine, such teachings are numerous. These manifold principles, which  constitute the greatest basis for the felicity of mankind and are of the  bounties of the Merciful, must be added to the matter of Universal Peace  and combined with it, so that results may accrue. Otherwise the  realization of Universal Peace in the world of mankind is difficult. As  the teachings of His Holiness Baha'u'llah are combined with Universal  Peace, they are like a table provided with every kind of fresh and  delicious food. Every soul can find at that table of infinite bounty that  which he desires. If the question is restricted to Universal Peace alone,  the remarkable results which are expected and desired will not be  attained. The scope of Universal Peace must be such that all the  communities and religions may find their highest wish realized in it. At  present the teachings of His Holiness Baha'u'llah are such that all the  communities of the world, whether religious, political or ethical, ancient  or modern, find in the teachings of Baha'u'llah the expression of their  highest wish.    For example, the people of religions find, in the teachings of His  Holiness Baha'u'llah, the establishment of Universal Religion--a religion  that perfectly conforms with present conditions, which in reality effects  the immediate cure of the incurable disease, which relieves every pain and  bestows the infallible antidote for every deadly poison. For if we wish to  arrange and organize the world of mankind in accordance with the present  religious imitations and thereby to establish the felicity of mankind, it  is impossible and impracticable: for example, the enforcement of the laws  of the Old Testament and also of the other religions in accordance with  present imitations. But the essential basis of all the divine religions  which pertains to the virtues of the world of mankind and is the  foundation of the welfare of the world of man, is found in the teachings  of His Holiness Baha'u'llah in the most perfect presentation.    Similarly, with regard to the people who clamor for freedom: the moderate  freedom which guarantees the welfare of the world of man, is found in the  teachings of His Holiness Baha'u'llah.    So with regard to political parties: that which is the greatest policy  directing the world of mankind, nay, rather the divine policy, is found in  the teachings of His Holiness Baha'u'llah.    Likewise with regard to the party of \"equality\" which seeks the solution  of the economic problems: until now all proposed solutions have proved  impracticable except the economic proposals in the teachings of His  Holiness Baha'u'llah, which are practicable and cause no distress to  society.    So with the other parties: when ye look deeply into this matter, ye will  discover that the highest aims of those parties are found in the teachings  of Baha'u'llah. These teachings constitute the all-inclusive power among  all men, and are practicable....    For example, the question of Universal Peace, about which His Holiness  Baha'u'llah says that the Supreme Tribunal must be established; although  the League of Nations has been brought into existence, yet it is incapable  of establishing Universal Peace. But the Supreme Tribunal which His  Holiness Baha'u'llah has described will fulfill this sacred task with the  utmost might and power. And his plan is this: that the national assemblies  of each country and nation--that is to say, their parliaments--should elect  two or three persons who are the choicest men of that nation, and are well  informed concerning international laws and the relations between  governments and aware of the essential needs of the world of humanity in  this day. The number of these representatives should be in proportion to  the number of inhabitants of that country. The election of these souls who  are chosen by the national assembly--that is, the parliament--must be  confirmed by the upper house, the congress and the cabinet and also by the  president or monarch so that these persons may be the elected ones of all  the nation and the government. From among these people the members of the  Supreme Tribunal will be elected, and all mankind will thus have a share  therein, for every one of these delegates is fully representative of his  nation. When the Supreme Tribunal gives a ruling on any international  question, either unanimously or by majority rule, there will no longer be  any pretext for the plaintiff or ground of objection for the defendant. In  case any of the governments or nations, in the execution of the  irrefutable decision of the Supreme Tribunal, be negligent or dilatory,  the rest of the nations will rise up against it, because all the  governments and nations of the world are the supporters of this Supreme  Tribunal. Consider what a firm foundation this is! But by a limited and  restricted League the purpose will not be realized as it ought and should.  This is the truth about the situation which has been stated....    Today nothing but the power of the Word of God which encompasses the  realities of things can bring the thoughts, minds, hearts and spirits  under the shade of one Tree. He is the potent in all things, the vivifier  of souls, the preserver and the controller of the world of mankind. Praise  be to God, in this day the light of the Word of God has shone forth upon  all regions; and from all sects, communities, nations, tribes, peoples,  religions and denominations, souls have gathered together under the shadow  of the Word of Oneness, and have in the utmost fellowship united and  harmonized!            RACIAL HARMONY      Today I am most happy, for I see here(6) a gathering of the servants of  God. I see the white and colored people together. In the estimation of God  there is no distinction of color; all are one in the color and beauty of  servitude to Him. Color is not important; the heart is all-important. It  matters not what the exterior may be if the heart be pure and white  within. God does not behold differences of hue and complexion; He looks at  the hearts. He whose morals and virtues are praiseworthy is preferred in  the presence of God; he who is devoted to the Kingdom is most beloved. In  the realm of genesis and creation the question of color is of least  importance.    The mineral kingdom abounds with many-colored substances and compositions  but we find no strife among them on that account. In the kingdom of the  plant and vegetable, distinct and variegated hues exist but the fruit and  flowers are not in conflict for that reason. Nay, rather, the very fact  that there is difference and variety lends a charm to the garden. If all  were of the same color the effect would be monotonous and depressing. When  you enter a rose-garden the wealth of color and variety of floral forms  spread before you a picture of wonder and beauty. The world of humanity is  like a garden and the various races are the flowers which constitute its  adornment and decoration. In the animal kingdom also we find variety of  color. See how the doves differ in beauty yet they live together in  perfect peace, and love each other. They do not make difference of color a  cause of discord and strife. They view each other as the same species and  kind. They know they are one in kind. Often a white dove soars aloft with  a black one. Throughout the animal kingdom we do not find the creatures  separated because of color. They recognize unity of species and oneness of  kind. If we do not find color distinction drawn in a kingdom of lower  intelligence and reason, how can it be justified among human beings,  especially when we know that all have come from the same source and belong  to the same household? In origin and intention of creation mankind is one.  Distinctions of race and color have arisen afterward.    Therefore today I am exceedingly glad that both white and colored people  have gathered here and I hope the time will come when they shall live  together in the utmost peace, unity and friendship. I wish to say one  thing of importance to both in order that the white race may be just and  kind to the colored and that the colored race may in turn be grateful and  appreciative toward the white. The great proclamation of liberty and  emancipation from slavery was made upon this continent. A long bloody war  was fought by white men for the sake of colored people. These white men  forfeited their possessions and sacrificed their lives by thousands in  order that colored men might be freed from bondage. The colored population  of the United States of America are possibly not fully informed of the  wide-reaching effect of this freedom and emancipation upon their colored  brethren in Asia and Africa where even more terrible conditions of slavery  existed. Influenced and impelled by the example of the United States, the  European powers proclaimed universal liberty to the colored race and  slavery ceased to exist. This effort and accomplishment by the white  nations should never be lost sight of. Both races should rejoice in  gratitude, for the institution of liberty and equality here became the  cause of liberating your fellow-being"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19239"],[0,"Bahá'í World Faith (#7)"],[1,"of the world are following imitations in  lieu of truth and as imitations are many and various, differences of  belief have been productive of strife and warfare. So long as these  imitations remain the oneness of the world of humanity is impossible.  Therefore we must investigate the reality in order that by its light the  clouds and darkness may be dispelled. Reality is one reality; it does not  admit multiplicity or division. If the nations of the world investigate  reality they will agree and become united. Many people and sects in Iran  have sought reality through the guidance and teaching of Baha'u'llah. They  have become united and now live in a state of agreement and love; among  them there is no longer the least trace of enmity and strife.    The Jews were expecting the appearance of the Messiah, looking forward to  it with devotion of heart and soul but because they were submerged in  imitations they did not believe in His Holiness Jesus Christ when he  appeared. Finally they rose against Him even to the extreme of persecution  and shedding His blood. Had they investigated reality they would have  accepted their promised Messiah. These blind imitations and hereditary  prejudices have invariably become the cause of bitterness and hatred and  have filled the world with darkness and violence of war. Therefore we must  seek the fundamental truth in order to extricate ourselves from such  conditions and then with illumined faces find the pathway to the kingdom  of God.    The second teaching of Baha'u'llah concerns the unity of mankind. All are  the servants of God and members of one human family. God has created all  and all are His children. He rears, nourishes, provides for and is kind to  all. Why should we be unjust and unkind? This is the policy of God, the  lights of which have shone throughout the world. His sun bestows its  effulgence unsparingly upon all, His clouds send down rain without  distinction or favor, His breezes refresh the whole earth. It is evident  that humankind without exception is sheltered beneath His mercy and  protection. Some are imperfect; they must be perfected. The ignorant must  be taught, the sick healed, the sleepers awakened. The child must not be  oppressed or censured because it is undeveloped; it must be patiently  trained. The sick must not be neglected because they are ailing; nay,  rather, we must have compassion upon them and bring them healing. Briefly;  the old conditions of animosity, bigotry and hatred between the religious  systems must be dispelled and the new conditions of love, agreement and  spiritual brotherhood be established among them.    The third teaching of Baha'u'llah is that religion must be the source of  fellowship, the cause of unity and the nearness of God to man. If it  rouses hatred and strife it is evident that absence of religion is  preferable and an irreligious man better than one who professes it.  According to the divine will and intention religion should be the cause of  love and agreement, a bond to unify all mankind for it is a message of  peace and good-will to man from God.    The fourth teaching of Baha'u'llah is the agreement of religion and  science. God has endowed man with intelligence and reason whereby he is  required to determine the verity of questions and propositions. If  religious beliefs and opinions are found contrary to the standards of  science they are mere superstitions and imaginations; for the antithesis  of knowledge is ignorance, and the child of ignorance is superstition.  Unquestionably there must be agreement between true religion and science.  If a question be found contrary to reason, faith and belief in it are  impossible and there is no outcome but wavering and vacillation.    Baha'u'llah has also taught that prejudices, whether religious, racial,  patriotic or political are destructive to the foundations of human  development. Prejudices of any kind are the destroyers of human happiness  and welfare. Until they are dispelled the advancement of the world of  humanity is not possible, yet racial, religious and national bias are  observed everywhere. For thousands of years the world of humanity has been  agitated and disturbed by prejudices. As long as it prevails, warfare,  animosity and hatred will continue. Therefore if we seek to establish  peace we must cast aside this obstacle, for otherwise agreement and  composure are not to be attained.    Fifth: Baha'u'llah set forth principles of guidance and teaching for  economic readjustment. Regulations were revealed by Him which insure the  welfare of the commonwealth. As the rich man enjoys his life surrounded by  ease and luxuries, so the poor man must likewise have a home and be  provided with sustenance and comforts commensurate with his needs. This  readjustment of the social economic is of the greatest importance inasmuch  as it insures the stability of the world of humanity; and until it is  effected, happiness and prosperity are impossible.    Sixth: Baha'u'llah teaches that an equal standard of human rights must be  recognized and adopted. In the estimation of God all men are equal; there  is no distinction or preferment for any soul in the dominion of His  justice and equity.    Seventh: Education is essential and all standards of training and teaching  throughout the world of mankind should be brought into conformity and  agreement; a universal curriculum should be established and the basis of  ethics be the same.    Eighth: A universal language shall be adopted and be taught by all the  schools and institutions of the world. A committee appointed by national  bodies of learning shall select a suitable language to be used as a medium  of international communication. All must acquire it. This is one of the  great factors in the unification of man.    Ninth: Baha'u'llah emphasized and established the equality of man and  woman. Sex is not particularized to humanity; it exists throughout the  animate kingdoms but without distinction or preference. In the vegetable  kingdom there is complete equality between male and female of species.  Likewise in the animal plane equality exists; all are under the protection  of God. Is it becoming to man that he, the noblest of creatures, should  observe and insist upon such distinction? Woman's lack of progress and  proficiency has been due to her need of equal education and opportunity.  Had she been allowed this equality there is no doubt she would be the  counterpart of man in ability and capacity. The happiness of mankind will  be realized when women and men coordinate and advance equally, for each is  the complement and helpmeet of the other.    The world of humanity cannot advance through mere physical powers and  intellectual attainments; nay, rather, the Holy Spirit is essential. The  divine Father must assist the human world to attain maturity. The body of  man is in need of physical and mental energy but his spirit requires the  life and fortification of the Holy Spirit. Without its protection and  quickening the human world would be extinguished. His Holiness Jesus  Christ declared, \"Let the dead bury their dead.\" He also said, \"That which  is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the spirit is  spirit.\" It is evident therefore according to His Holiness that the human  spirit which is not fortified by the presence of the Holy Spirit is dead  and in need of resurrection by that divine power; otherwise though  materially advanced to high degrees man cannot attain full and complete  progress.          SCIENCE AND SPIRITUAL DEVELOPMENT      If we look with a perceiving eye upon the world of creation, we find that  all existing things may be classified as follows: First--Mineral--that is to  say matter or substance appearing in various forms of composition.  Second--Vegetable--possessing the virtues of the mineral plus the power of  augmentation or growth, indicating a degree higher and more specialized  than the mineral. Third--Animal--possessing the attributes of the mineral  and vegetable plus the power of sense perception. Fourth--Human--the highest  specialized organism of visible creation, embodying the qualities of the  mineral, vegetable and animal plus an ideal endowment absolutely minus and  absent in the lower kingdoms--the power of intellectual investigation into  the mysteries of outer phenomena. The outcome of this intellectual  endowment is science which is especially characteristic of man. This  scientific power investigates and apprehends created objects and the laws  surrounding them. It is the discoverer of the hidden and mysterious  secrets of the material universe and is peculiar to man alone. The most  noble and praiseworthy accomplishment of man therefore is scientific  knowledge and attainment.    Science may be likened to a mirror wherein the images of the mysteries of  outer phenomena are reflected. It brings forth and exhibits to us in the  arena of knowledge all the product of the past. It links together past and  present. The philosophical conclusions of bygone centuries, the teachings  of the prophets and wisdom of former sages are crystallized and reproduced  in the scientific advancement of today. Science is the discoverer of the  past. From its premises of past and present we deduce conclusions as to  the future. Science is the governor of nature and its mysteries, the one  agency by which man explores the institutions of material creation. All  created things are captives of nature and subject to its laws. They cannot  transgress the control of these laws in one detail or particular. The  infinite starry worlds and heavenly bodies are nature's obedient subjects.  The earth and its myriad organisms, all minerals, plants and animals are  thralls of its dominion. But man through the exercise of his scientific,  intellectual power can rise out of this condition, can modify, change and  control nature according to his own wishes and uses. Science, so"]]]
