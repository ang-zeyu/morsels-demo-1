It was now very cold, and the river  was so blocked with ice that the boat could go no farther. The missionaries  therefore walked the rest of the distance to St. Louis and from there  across the state of Missouri to its western boundary.    The snow was deep, there were no beaten roads, the houses were few and far  between, and the wind blew fierce and cold. For days they had nothing to  eat but corn bread and frozen pork; but at last they reached the town of  Independence, in Jackson county, Missouri, which was then near to the  Indian country.    The elders now took up their labors among the Indians. They were kindly  received, and the chief called a council which Oliver Cowdery addressed.  The Book of Mormon was presented to them and explained, and they became  very much interested. The sectarian preachers heard about this and  complained to the Indian agent, who ordered the elders off the Indian  lands. So after but a few days of preaching the elders had to leave. They  went back to Jackson county and preached to the white settlers, some of  whom believed the word of God and were added to the Church. Four of the  elders remained at Independence, while Bro. Pratt was sent back to Kirtland  to report their labors.    Topics.--1. Parley P. Pratt. 2. The first mission to the Indians. 3. At  Kirtland. 4. Journey to Independence and preaching to Indians.

The scriptures often speak of a time in the latter days when the people of  God shall be gathered together to build up the Lord's kingdom and prepare  for his second coming. The gospel should be preached to all the world, and  those who would believe should go out from Babylon, or the wicked world,  and came together with the people of the Lord. Every elder who has been on  a mission will tell you that as soon as persons accept the gospel, a desire  comes to them to gather with the main body of the Saints. Thus the Lord  puts the spirit of gathering into the hearts of the believers, and his  purposes are fulfilled.    The Lord told the prophet Joseph that the time for this gathering had come,  and that the central gathering place for the Saints on this land was  somewhere in the West, though at first the exact location was not told him.    In December, 1830, the word of the Lord came to Joseph that the Saints  should gather to Ohio. This was westward and in the proper direction. The  western missionaries had raised up large branches in Ohio, so it was not  like going into a new place. The Church was growing steadily, and many  revelations were given to the Saints. We might say the Lord was assigning  lessons for us, which we have not yet learned very well.    Preparations were made for this removal by holding the third conference of  the Church at Fayette and setting its affairs in order.    One day, about the 1st of February, 1831, a sleigh containing two men and  two women, drove through the streets of Kirtland, Ohio, and stopped at the  door of Gilbert and Whitney's store. One of the men alighted, and springing  up the steps, walked into the store where one of the owners was standing.    \"Newel K. Whitney, thou art the man!\" exclaimed the visitor, extending his  hand as to an old friend.    \"You have the advantage of me,\" replied the storekeeper, \"I could not call  you by name as you have me.\"    \"I am Joseph, the prophet,\" said the stranger, smiling. \"You've prayed me  here; now what do you want of me?\"    Mr. Whitney, you will remember, had joined the Church sometime before, and  of course he was delighted to see the prophet. Joseph and his wife, Emma,  stayed at Brother Whitney's house for some time. Shortly after this, Newel  K. Whitney was called to be bishop at Kirtland, and later he became the  second presiding bishop of the Church.    Early next spring, 1831, the Saints from New York began to come to Ohio,  buying land in and around the town of Kirtland.    Before leaving Fayette, Joseph had been visited by a young man who had  walked two hundred miles to see him and have the prophet tell him what his  duty was. This young man was Orson Pratt, brother of Parley P. Pratt.  Joseph received a revelation in which Orson was called to preach the gospel  to the world; and this duty Orson Pratt did all his life.    [Illustration: SIDNEY RIGDON.]    Elder Pratt became one of the Twelve Apostles. He went on a great many  missions in this country and to Europe, during which time he crossed the  ocean sixteen times. He became one of the most learned men in the Church,  and wrote many books on gospel subjects. Read the title, or first page of  the Book of Mormon and the book of Doctrine and Covenants and see what they  say of Orson Pratt. Elder Pratt was one of the pioneers, he and Erastus  Snow being the first two men of that company to enter Salt Lake Valley.    Another man who came to see Joseph while yet at Fayette was Sidney Rigdon,  a former Campbellite preacher whom Parley P. Pratt had baptized at  Kirtland. Elder Rigdon also became a prominent man in the Church, being  first counselor to President Joseph Smith during the life time of the  prophet. He took an active part in all the affairs of the Church up to  within a few months of the prophet's death. He was greatly disappointed  because he was not chosen to succeed Joseph as the leader of the Church,  and soon after apostatized. He died outside the Church.    Thomas B. Marsh was the name of a man who came to Kirtland with the Church.  He became a leader among the Saints and was president of the first quorum  of Twelve Apostles. Elder Marsh did much missionary work and suffered with  the Saints in their persecution; but in 1838 he became dissatisfied and did  some wicked things against his brethren. He was therefore cut off from the  Church. Nineteen years after he came back and was baptized again. He came  to Utah and lived at Ogden, where he died, a poor, broken-down man.    Topics.--1. The gathering. 2. The move to Ohio. 3. Orson Pratt. 4. Sidney  Rigdon. 5. Thomas B. Marsh.    Questions and Review.--1. What is meant by the gathering? 2. Quote some  scriptural passage on the gathering. 3. Where was the first gathering  place? 4. Locate Kirtland. 5. Tell about Joseph's first visit to Kirtland.  6. Who was Newel K. Whitney? 7.

Tell about Thomas B. Marsh.          CHAPTER XII.    THE LAND OF ZION.      The Book of Mormon (13th chapter of Ether) tells us that this land of  America is a \"choice land above all other lands;\" and the Lord has said  that the people who lived here must serve him or in time be destroyed. This  you will remember was proved so often in the history of the Nephites.    Strictly speaking, the whole of America is the land of Zion, but the Lord  revealed to Joseph that there should be a \"center place,\" where a great  city should be build which should be called the city of Zion, or the New  Jerusalem. This city will be the capital or in the center of a large  district of country full of people who serve the Lord. A grand temple will  be built in the central city, and the glory of the Lord will rest upon it  by day and by night. Then shall there be peace in the earth for a thousand  years, and the Saints will be busy working to save all the people who live  or have ever lived on the earth. Jesus with his angels will no doubt visit  the earth from time to time to look after his work at this glorious period.    Now all this was to have a beginning, one of these small beginnings we have  spoken about.    June 7th, 1831, the Prophet Joseph received a revelation instructing him  and twenty-eight other elders to go on missions. They were to travel two  and two by different routes through the Western states, preaching the  gospel and building up the Church on the way. They were to meet in the  state of Missouri about a thousand miles from Kirtland and there hold a  conference. At this time, if they were faithful, the Lord would reveal to  them the location of the central place and the spot where the temple should  sometime stand.    The brethren went on their missions as they had been instructed, and Joseph  and his party arrived at Independence, Missouri, about the middle of July,  1831. Oliver Cowdery and the other brethren who had been sent on the  mission to the Indians, you will recollect, stopped at Independence. They  were very glad to meet Joseph and his companions again.    Shortly after the prophet's arrival, the Lord made known the exact spot for  the city of Zion. It is where the town of Independence is located, in  Jackson County, Missouri, and the site for the temple was pointed out as  lying westward on a lot not far from the court house.    Some of the Saints now moved to Jackson county, the first to arrive being  what was called the Colesville Branch of the Church. These Saints had come  from Colesville, State of New York, having stopped but a short time near  Kirtland.    The first step towards the founding of Zion was taken on the 2nd day of  August, 1831. On that day twelve men, of which Joseph was one, carried and  placed the first log for the first house. This was in Kaw township, twelve  miles west of Independence, where the Colesville branch was "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16545"],[0,"King Alfred of England (#7)"],[1,"the English Channel to the mouth  of the Seine. He ascended this river to Rouen, and there landed,  spreading throughout the country the utmost terror and dismay. From  Rouen he marched to Paris, finding no force able to resist him on his  way, or to defend the capital. His troops destroyed the monastery of  St. Germain's, near the city, and then the King of the Franks, finding  himself at their mercy, bought them off by paying a large sum of  money. With this money and the other booty which they had acquired,  Ragnar and his horde now returned to their ships at Rouen, and sailed  away again toward their usual haunts among the bays and islands of the  Baltic Sea.    This exploit, of course, gave Ragnar Lodbrog's barbarous name a very  wide celebrity. It tended, too, greatly to increase and establish his  power. He afterward made similar incursions into Spain, and finally  grew bold enough to brave the Anglo-Saxons themselves on the green  island of Britain, as the Anglo-Saxons had themselves braved the  aboriginal inhabitants two or three centuries before. But Ragnar seems  to have found the Anglo-Saxon swords and spears which he advanced to  encounter on landing in England much more formidable than those which  were raised against him on the southern side of the Channel. He was  destroyed in the contest. The circumstances were as follows:    In making his preparations for a descent upon the English coast, he  prepared for a very determined contest, knowing well the character of  the foes with whom he would have now to deal. He built two enormous  ships, much larger than those of the ordinary size, and armed and  equipped them in the most perfect manner. He filled them with selected  men, and sailing down along the coast of Scotland, he watched for a  place and an opportunity to land. Winds and storms are almost always  raging among the dark and gloomy mountains and islands of Scotland.  Ragnar's ships were caught on one of these gales and driven on shore.  The ships were lost, but the men escaped to the land. Ragnar, nothing  daunted, organized and marshaled them as an army, and marched into  the interior to attack any force which might appear against them. His  course led him to Northumbria, the most northerly Saxon kingdom. Here  he soon encountered a very large and superior force, under the command  of Ella, the king; but, with the reckless desperation which so  strongly marked his character, he advanced to attack them. Three  times, it is said, he pierced the enemy's lines, cutting his way  entirely through them with his little column. He was, however, at  length overpowered. His men were cut to pieces, and he was himself  taken prisoner. We regret to have to add that our cruel ancestors put  their captive to death in a very barbarous manner. They filled a den  with poisonous snakes, and then drove the wretched Ragnar into it. The  horrid reptiles killed him with their stings. It was Ella, the king of  Northumbria, who ordered and directed this punishment.    The expedition of Ragnar thus ended without leading to any permanent  results in Anglo-Saxon history. It is, however, memorable as the first  of a series of invasions from the Danes--or Northmen, as they are  sometimes called, since they came from all the coasts of the Baltic  and German Seas--which, in the end, gave the Anglo-Saxons infinite  trouble. At one time, in fact, the conquests of the Danes threatened  to root out and destroy the Anglo-Saxon power from the island  altogether. They would probably have actually effected this, had the  nation not been saved by the prudence, the courage, the sagacity, and  the consummate skill of the subject of this history, as will fully  appear to the reader in the course of future chapters.    Ragnar was not the only one of these Northmen who made attempts to  land in England and to plunder the Anglo-Saxons, even in his own day.  Although there were no very regular historical records kept in those  early times, still a great number of legends, and ballads, and ancient  chronicles have come down to us, narrating the various transactions  which occurred, and it appears by these that the sea kings generally  were beginning, at this time, to harass the English coasts, as well as  all the other shores to which they could gain access. Some of these  invasions would seem to have been of a very formidable character.    At first these excursions were made in the summer season only, and,  after collecting their plunder, the marauders would return in the  autumn to their own shores, and winter in the bays and among the  islands there. At length, however, they grew more bold. A large band  of them landed, in the autumn of 851, on the island of Thanet where  the Saxons themselves had landed four centuries before, and began very  coolly to establish their winter quarters on English ground. They  succeeded in maintaining their stay during the winter, and in the  spring were prepared for bolder undertakings still.    They formed a grand confederation, and collected a fleet of three  hundred and fifty ships, galleys, and boats, and advanced boldly  up the Thames. They plundered London, and then marched south to  Canterbury, which they plundered too. They went thence into one of the  Anglo-Saxon kingdoms called Mercia, the inhabitants of the country not  being able to oppose any effectual obstacle to their marauding march.  Finally, a great Anglo-Saxon force was organized and brought out to  meet them. The battle was fought in a forest of oaks, and the Danes  were defeated. The victory, however, afforded the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms  only a temporary relief. New hordes were continually arriving and  landing, growing more and more bold if they met with success, and but  little daunted or discouraged by temporary failures.    The most formidable of all these expeditions was one organized and  commanded by the sons and relatives of Ragnar, whom, it will be  recollected, the Saxons had cruelly killed by poisonous serpents in  a dungeon or den. The relatives of the unhappy chieftain thus  barbarously executed were animated in their enterprise by the double  stimulus of love of plunder and a ferocious thirst for revenge. A  considerable time was spent in collecting a large fleet, and in  combining, for this purpose, as many chieftains as could be induced to  share in the enterprise. The story of their fellow-countryman expiring  under the stings of adders and scorpions, while his tormentors were  exulting around him over the cruel agonies which their ingenuity  had devised, aroused them to a phrensy of hatred and revenge. They  proceeded, however, very deliberately in their plans. They did nothing  hastily. They allowed ample time for the assembling and organizing  of the confederation. When all was ready, they found that there were  eight kings and twenty earls in the alliance, generally the relatives  and comrades of Ragnar. The two most prominent of these commanders  were Guthrum and Hubba. Hubba was one of Ragnar's sons. At length,  toward the close of the summer, the formidable expedition set sail.  They approached the English coast, and landed without meeting with any  resistance. The Saxons seemed appalled and paralyzed at the greatness  of the danger. The several kingdoms of the Heptarchy, though they had  been imperfectly united, some years before, under Egbert, were still  more or less distinct, and each hoped that the one first invaded would  be the only one which would suffer; and as these kingdoms were rivals,  and often hostile to each other, no general league was formed against  what soon proved to be the common enemy. The Danes, accordingly,  quietly encamped, and made calm and deliberate arrangements for  spending the winter in their new quarters, as if they were at home.    During all this time, notwithstanding the coolness and deliberation  with which these avengers of their murdered countryman acted, the  fires of their resentment and revenge were slowly but steadily  burning, and as soon as the spring opened, they put themselves in  battle array, and marched into the dominions of Ella. Ella did all  that it was possible to do to meet and oppose them, but the spirit of  retaliation and rage which his cruelties had evoked was too strong to  be resisted. His country was ravaged, his army was defeated, he was  taken prisoner, and the dying terrors and agonies of Ragnar among the  serpents were expiated by tenfold worse tortures which they inflicted  upon Ella's mutilated body, by a process too horrible to be described.    After thus successfully accomplishing the great object of their  expedition, it was to have been hoped that they would leave the island  and return to their Danish homes. But they evinced no disposition  to do this. On the contrary, they commenced a course of ravage and  conquest in all parts of England, which continued for several years.  The parts of the country which attempted to oppose them they destroyed  by fire and sword. They seized cities, garrisoned and occupied them,  and settled in them as if to make them their permanent homes. One  kingdom after another was subdued. The kingdom of Wessex seemed alone  to remain, and that was the subject of contest. Ethelred was the king.  The Danes advanced into his dominions to attack him. In the battle  that ensued, Ethelred was killed. The successor to his throne was his  brother Alfred, the subject of this history, who thus found himself  suddenly and unexpectedly called upon to assume the responsibilities  and powers of supreme command, in as dark and trying a crisis of  national calamity and danger as can well be conceived. The manner in  which Alfred acted in the emergency, rescuing his country from her  perils, and laying the foundations, as he did, of all the greatness  and glory which has since accrued to her, has caused his memory to be  held in the highest estimation among all nations, and has immortalized  his name.
