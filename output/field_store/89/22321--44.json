XLIII.--HOWEVER, NEITHER MAN NOR THE UNIVERSE IS THE EFFECT OF CHANCE.    Then you will say that intelligent man and even the universe and all it  encloses, are the effects of chance. No, I answer, the universe is not  an effect; it is the cause of all effects; all the beings it embraces  are the necessary effects of this cause which sometimes shows to us its  manner of acting, out which often hides from us its way. Men may use the  word \"chance\" to cover their ignorance of the true causes; nevertheless,  although they may ignore them, these causes act, but by certain laws.  There is no effect without a cause.    Nature is a word which we make use of to designate the immense  assemblage of beings, diverse substances, infinite combinations, and all  the various motions which we see. All bodies, whether organized or not  organized, are the necessary results of certain causes, made to produce  necessarily the effects which we see. Nothing in nature can be made by  chance; all follow fixed laws; these laws are but the necessary union of  certain effects with their causes. An atom of matter does not meet  another atom by accident or by hazard; this rencounter is due to  permanent laws, which cause each being to act by necessity as it does,  and can not act otherwise under the same circumstances. To speak about  the accidental coming together of atoms, or to attribute any effects to  chance, is to say nothing, if not to ignore the laws by which bodies  act, meet, combine, or separate.    Everything is made by chance for those who do not understand nature, the  properties of beings, and the effects which must necessarily result from  the concurrence of certain causes. It is not chance that has placed the  sun in the center of our planetary system; it is by its very essence,  the substance of which it is composed, that it occupies this place, and  from thence diffuses itself to invigorate the beings who live in these  planets.          XLIV.--NEITHER DOES THE ORDER OF THE UNIVERSE PROVE THE EXISTENCE OF A  GOD.    The worshipers of a God find, especially in the order of the universe,  an invincible proof of the existence of an intelligent and wise being  who rules it. But this order is only a result of motions necessarily  brought on by causes or by circumstances which are sometimes favorable  and sometimes injurious to ourselves; we approve the former and find  fault with the latter.    Nature follows constantly the same progress; that is to say, the same  causes produce the same effects, as long as their action is not  interrupted by other causes which occasion the first ones to produce  different effects. When the causes, whose effects we feel, are  interrupted in their action by causes which, although unknown to us, are  no less natural and necessary, we are stupefied, we cry out miracles:  and we attribute them to a cause far less known than all those we see  operating before us. The universe is always in order; there can be no  disorder for it. Our organization alone is suffering if we complain  about disorder. Bodies, causes, beings, which this world embraces, act  necessarily in the manner in which we see them act, whether we approve  or disapprove their action. Earthquakes, volcanoes, inundations,  contagions, and famines are effects as necessary in the order of nature  as the fall of heavy bodies, as the course of rivers, as the periodical  movements of the seas, the blowing of the winds, the abundant rains, and  the favorable effects for which we praise and thank Providence for its  blessings.    To be astonished that a certain order reigns in the world, is to be  surprised to see the same causes constantly producing the same effects.  To be shocked at seeing disorder, is to forget that the causes being  changed or disturbed in their action, the effects can no longer be the  same. To be astonished to see order in nature, is to be astonished that  anything can exist; it is to be surprised at one's own existence. What  is order for one being, is disorder for another. All wicked beings find  that everything is in order when they can with impunity put everything  into disorder; they find, on the contrary, that everything is in  disorder when they are prevented from exercising their wickedness.          XLV.--CONTINUATION.    Supposing God to be the author and the motor of nature, there could be  no disorder relating to Him; all causes which He would have made would  necessarily act according to their properties the essences and the  impulsions that He had endowed them with. If God should change the  ordinary course of things, He would not be immutable. If the order of  the universe--in which we believe we see the most convincing proof of His  existence, of His intelligence, His power, and His goodness--should be  inconsistent, His existence might be doubted; or He might be accused at  least of inconstancy, of inability, of want of foresight, and of wisdom  in the first arrangement of things; we would have a right to accuse Him  of blundering in His choice of agents and instruments. Finally, if the  order of nature proves the power and the intelligence, disorder ought to  prove the weakness, inconstancy, and irrationality of Divinity. You say  that God is everywhere; that He fills all space; that nothing was made  without Him; that matter could not act without Him as its motor. But in  this case you admit that your God is the author of disorder; that it is  He who deranges nature; that He is the Father of confusion; that He is  in man; and that He moves man at the moment when he sins. If God is  everywhere, He is in me; He acts with me; He is deceived when I am  deceived; He questions with me the existence of God; He offends God with  me. Oh, theologians! you never understand yourselves when you speak of  God.          XLVI.--A PURE SPIRIT CAN NOT BE INTELLIGENT, AND TO ADORE A DIVINE  INTELLIGENCE IS A CHIMERA.    To be what we call intelligent, we must have ideas, thoughts, will; to  have ideas, thoughts, and will, we must have organs; to have organs, we  must have a body; to act upon bodies, we must have a body; to experience  trouble, we must be capable of suffering; from which it evidently  follows that a pure spirit can not be intelligent, and can not be  affected by that which takes place in the universe.    Divine intelligence, divine ideas, divine views, you say, have nothing  in common with those of men. So much the better! But in this case, how  can men judge of these views--whether good or evil--reason about these  ideas, or admire this intelligence? It would be to judge, to admire, to  adore that of which we can form no idea. To adore the profound views of  divine wisdom, is it not to worship that of which it is impossible for  us to judge? To admire these same views, is it not admiring without  knowing wry? Admiration is always the daughter of ignorance. Men admire  and worship only what they do not understand.          XLVII.--ALL THE QUALITIES WHICH THEOLOGY GIVES TO ITS GOD ARE CONTRARY TO  THE VERY ESSENCE WHICH IT SUPPOSES HIM TO HAVE.    All these qualities which are given to God are not suited to a being  who, by His own essence, is devoid of all similarity to human beings. It  is true, they think to find this similarity by exaggerating the human  qualities with which they have clothed Divinity; they thrust them upon  the infinite, and from that moment cease to understand themselves. What  is the result of this combination of man with God, or of this  theanthropy? Its only result is a chimera, of which nothing can be  affirmed without causing the phantom to vanish which they had taken so  much trouble to conjure up.    Dante, in his poem of Paradise, relates that the Divinity appeared to  him under the figure of three circles, which formed an iris, whose  bright colors arose from each other; but having wished to retain its  brilliant light, the poet saw only his own face. In worshiping God, man  adores himself.          XLVIII.--CONTINUATION.    The slightest reflection suffices to prove to us that God can not have  any of the human qualities, virtues, or perfections. Our virtues and our  perfections are the results of our temperament modified. Has God a  temperament like ours? Our good qualities are our habits relative to the  beings in whose society we live. God, according to you, is a solitary  being. God has no one like Him; He does not live in society; He has no  need of any one; He enjoys a happiness which nothing can alter. Admit,  then, upon your own principles, that God can not possess what we call  virtues, and that man can not be virtuous in regard to Him.          XLIX.--IT IS ABSURD TO SAY THAT THE HUMAN RACE IS THE OBJECT AND THE END  OF CREATION.    Man, charmed with his own merits, imagines that it is but his own kind  that God proposed as the object and the end in the formation of the  universe. Upon what is this so flattering opinion based? It is, we are  told, upon this: that man is the only being endowed with an intelligence  which enables him to know the Divine nature, and to render to it homage  worthy of it. We are assured that God created the world for His own  glory, and that the human race was included in His plan, in order that  He might have somebody to admire and glorify Him in His works. But by  these intentions has not God visibly missed His end?    1. According to you, it would always be impossible for man to know his  God, and he would be kept in the most invincible ignorance of the Divine  essence.    2. A being who has no equals, can not be susceptible of glory. Glory can  result but from the comparison of his own excellence with that of  others.    3. If God by Himself is infinitely happy and is sufficient unto Himself,  why does He need the homage of His feeble creatures?    4. In spite of all His works, God is not glorified; on the contrary, all  the religions of the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17615"],[0,"In Search of the Okapi (#7)"],[1,"was feared.    \"The would Muata take to himself wives, and would drink beer, and  grow fat; but his mother counseled with him, saying he was a boy--  saying he was only at the beginning of the path. And Muata listened,  for she was wiser than all, and he set his heart on the plan she put  before him to win back the land of his people.    \"Thus Muata the chief was still a warrior and a hunter. He followed  the spoor into the fastnesses of the woods, and trained the young of  the jackal to drive the buck towards him.    \"Ohe! it was ended. The evil-doers, the child-slayers,  the robbers  of men, sent spies into the forest, and when Muata returned from his  hunting there was wailing at the kraal, and the fire was dead on the  hearth. And the women cried, 'O chief, they have taken the lioness;  they lured her out with tales of ill that had befallen Muata, even  the young lion. So she went forth between the gates, and they, the  robbers, carried her away.'    \"Muata turned on his heel straightway. He sought the trail of the  man-thieves. It was plain and level. It led through the forest, and  by night his jackal led him on the scent. By day he followed; by  night and day Muata went on the track to the river. At the river he  heard news. They had gone on the river towards the setting sun.    \"Muata took a canoe from the river people, and with his jackal he  followed, while the sun rose and set many times, and he came to the  father of rivers.    \"The waters were wide, and his canoe was like a leaf carried here  and there. His heart was sad, but the spirit of his mother  prevailed. He followed, and a man came to him saying that the yellow  men were near at hand, and sick of the sickness that shakes. Muata  gathered together his strength and pushed on. Ohe! and he fell into  the hands of his enemies like a child. He went among them sleeping,  and when he awoke his hands and limbs were bound.    \"And the enemy mocked him, saying, 'Is this Muata?' saying, 'even  the ant will make him cry aloud;' and they smeared fat on him. They  shook the ants over him, and they bit deep. They reviled him, they  spat on him, as day by day he followed in the canoe tied to their  greater canoe. They made plans about him to kill him, but the chief  man said even a dog had his price. So they forebore to slay Muata,  but they carried him down the father of waters to where there was a  still greater canoe with wings. They put a gag into his mouth to  still his voice, but in the night the jackal bit through the rope,  and Muata was alone on the waters.    \"Then the jackal cried suddenly, and Muata was borne out of the  water, and he was fed.    \"That is the story of Muata, and his heart goes out to the white men  who brought him out of the darkness.\"          CHAPTER V    TROUBLE BREWING    That was the story of Muata!    The white boys looked and wondered. This man who had been through so  many dangers could not be much older than they were. If his story  were true, he had shown endurance, courage, and a force of character  that set the stamp of greatness upon him as greatness would be  reckoned among his kind.    Was it true that he had slain a gorilla with bow and arrow, that he  warred successfully against the Arab slave-hunters? Had he subdued a  band of men by sheer force of will?    The boys believed him.  They did not stop to ask whether the story  was probable.  They formed their opinion upon the manner of the  young chief--upon his grave dignity, and upon the absence of a  boastful spirit.    \"If his story is true,\" said Mr. Hume, \"he owes much to his mother.\"    \"Where is your mother?\" asked Compton.    \"The chief's wife is not a woman,\" said Muata. \"And yet she is a  woman. She beguiled them in the forest by pretence of great  submission and fear of the woods. So they trusted her to bring  firewood, believing she would not go far from the camp. But she was  watching  for sign of the little people. This I know, for she  vanished in the woods near the river. And the yellow hunters of men  knew not how she had gone; but they left word to people by the river  to say to me that my mother had been carried away in a canoe.\"    \"And what will you do now?\"    \"See, I am no one--a liver on kindness, a slave at the gate. But in  time Muata will return to the place of hiding.\"    \"Better stay with us, Muata. We go into the forest ourselves. We  will give you food, and teach you how to use the weapon of the Arab  hunters. You will hunt for us, work in the canoe for us, and, maybe,  we will go with you to your hiding-place.\"    \"The forest is dark and terrible. Why, will my father enter the  darkness with his sons?\"    \"We go to hunt, and for the love of the woods and the water. Has not  a hunter joy in the hunting?\"    \"I know it;\" and the chief observed them intently, as if he were  unpersuaded. \"The ways of white men are strange. Muata hunts to keep  the hut supplied with meat, but the white man carries his meat with  him. When he kills he leaves the meat and takes only the horns or  the skin of the thing he has slain. Muata is not a child. When he  sees a single vulture in the sky, he knows there are others coming  behind.  A white man comes out of the beyond into the black man's  country. He is soft-spoken; he is a hunter only. Mawoh! and behind  him comes an army.\"    \"What do you know about white men, Muata?\"    \"The wise men at the hiding-place talked. They knew one such. He  lived among them. His ways were strange. He talked with the trees;  he sought among the rocks; he communed with spirits. He was  harmless, but the wise men said others would follow on his trail  doing mischief. So I ask, my father, why do you wish to enter the  forest?\"    \"Because,\" said Compton, leaning forward, \"my father was lost in the  forest, and I would find him. Tell me, where is the white man your  old men talked of?\"    \"The forest takes, the forest keeps,\" said Muata, lifting a hand  solemnly.    \"Do you mean,\" asked the boy, quietly, \"that the white man does not  live?\"    \"The people dealt well by their white man. They gave him food; they  carried water for him, and built his fire. Even I, as a child,  carried wood to him and listened at his knees.\"    \"I am not blaming the people; but I want to find the place that is  called the Place of Rest, where my father lived; perhaps where he  died.\"    \"This, then, is the hunting?\" said the chief, softly.    Mr. Hume recognized the suspicion in the altered tone and suave  manner of the chief.    \"We have spoken,\" he said sharply. \"We go into the forest to hunt  and to seek without anger against any. We thought you would have  worked in well with us; but I see you are a man of a crooked mind.\"    \"Softly, my father,\" said the chief, quietly. \"Is it wise that a  chief should listen to the counsel of strangers without taking  thought for his people?\"    \"We saved the chief's life.\"    \"The chiefs life is his own\"--Muata snapped his fingers--\"but the  secret of the hiding-place is the life of the people. Go slowly, my  father. Muata would work for you and with you; his shield is your  shield; his eye is your eye; but the secret of the hiding-place is  not his to give away.\"    \"Then you must land here on the bank among your enemies.\"    The chief glanced at the far-off wooded banks, with lines of smoke  rising from cooking-fires.    \"I have no weapons,\" he said.    \"We cannot help that,\" said Mr. Hume, with indifference.  \"Either  you agree to take us to the Place of Rest, or you land.\"    Muata rose up, looked under the flat of his hand all around, then  let the cotton sheet they had given him slip to the deck. The jackal  started up, with his ears pricked and his eyes fixed on his master's  face. The chief caught hold of a wire rope and jumped on to the  rail, where he steadied himself.    \"What will you do?\" asked Mr. Hume.    Muata turned round and pointed to the otter on his chest.    \"You don't mean to say,\" said Venning, indignantly, \"that you are  going to let him swim ashore? Why, the bank is miles away, and the  crocodiles are in between.\"    Muata's glance fell on the jackal, and he spoke to it. The animal  whined, then crouched.    \"A favour, my father,\" he said. \"If the beast followed me, he would  be food for the crocodiles. Place him on land when you reach the  bank, for the sake of good hunting.\"    \"I will do so.\"    The chief took another long glance around, then drew himself up for  the dive.    \"Stop,\" said Mr. Hume.    Muata looked round.    \"Your shield is our shield. So be it. We will not ask you to lead us  to your hiding-place. Is that so, Compton?\"    \"When he leads us,\" said Compton, nodding his head, \"it will be at  his own will.\"    \"At any rate,\" muttered Venning, \"he has proved himself to be a man;  but I wonder if he would have reached the shore?\"    As he spoke the jackal howled, and the chief, who was still standing  on the rail, slipped and fell with a splash. They ran to the side,  and the jackal, with another howl, sprang to the rail and thence  into the river, where a second or two later it was in the troubled  wake of the steamer, beating frantically with its fore paws.    \"Man overboard!\" shouted Mr. Hume. \"Stand by with a rope.\"    But the Belgian skipper on the little bridge held to his course,  while a small knot of coloured passengers aft stood laughing and  chattering.    \"Stop her, you swab,\" cried Mr. Hume; then, as the man took no  notice, he ran to the wheel, thrust aside the steersman, and jammed  the wheel over.    The displaced man, with an oath, flung himself at the hunter with  the sympathy of the passengers, who, ceasing their laughter,  advanced with menacing cries.    Before the boys had time to comprehend the situation, Mr. Hume  settled the matter out of hand. Letting go the wheel, he caught his  assailant by the waistband, and with a heave flung him overboard.  Then with a quick right and left he sent two of the others reeling.    \"Now,\" he roared"]]]
