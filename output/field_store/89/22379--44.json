The subjects are the gods,       demi-gods, and heroes in scenes from their lives and       adventures. The fourth kind of ware dates down into the       Hellenistic age and shows red figures surrounded by a black       ground. The figure, the drawing, the composition are better       than at any other period and suggest a high excellence in       other forms of Greek painting. After Alexander, vase       painting seems to have shared the fate of wall and panel       painting. There was a striving for effect, with ornateness       and extravagance, and finally the art passed out entirely.         There was an establishment founded in Southern Italy which       imitated the Greek and produced the Apulian ware, but the       Romans gave little encouragement to vase painting, and about       65 B.C. it disappeared. Almost all the museums of the world       have collections of Greek vases. The British, Berlin, and       Paris collections are perhaps as complete as any.

ETRUSCAN PAINTING: Painting in Etruria has not a great deal of  interest for us just here. It was largely decorative and sepulchral in  motive, and was employed in the painting of tombs, and upon vases and  other objects placed in the tombs. It had a native way of expressing  itself, which at first was neither Greek nor Oriental, and yet a  reminder of both. Technically it was not well done. Before 500 B.C. it  was almost childish in the drawing. After that date the figures were  better, though short and squat. Those on the vases usually show  outline drawing filled in with dull browns and yellows. Finally there  was a mingling of Etruscan with Greek elements, and an imitation of  Greek methods. It was at best a hybrid art, but of some importance  from an archaeological point of view.    ROMAN PAINTING: Roman art is an appendix to the art history of Greece.  It originated little in painting, and was content to perpetuate the  traditions of Greece in an imitative way. What was worse, it copied  the degeneracy of Greece by following the degenerate Hellenistic  paintings. In motive and method it was substantially the same work as  that of the Greeks under the Diadochi. The subjects, again, were often  taken from Greek story, though there were Roman historical scenes,  _genre_ pieces, and many portraits.    [Illustration: FIG. 15.--RITUAL SCENE, PALATINE WALL PAINTING. (FROM  WOLTMANN AND WOERMANN.)]    In the beginning of the Empire tablet or panel painting was rather  abandoned in favor of mural decoration. That is to say, figures or  groups were painted in fresco on the wall and then surrounded by  geometrical, floral, or architectural designs to give the effect of a  panel let into the wall. Thus painting assumed a more decorative  nature. Vitruvius says in effect that in the early days nature was  followed in these wall paintings, but later on they became ornate and  overdone, showing many unsupported architectural facades and  impossible decorative framings. This can be traced in the Roman and  Pompeian frescos. There were four kinds of these wall paintings. (1.)  Those that covered all the walls of a room and did away with dado,  frieze, and the like, such as figures with large landscape  backgrounds showing villas and trees. (2.) Small paintings separated  or framed by pilasters. (3.) Panel pictures let into the wall or  painted with that effect. (4.) Single figures with architectural  backgrounds. The single figures were usually the best. They had grace  of line and motion and all the truth to nature that decoration  required. Some of the backgrounds were flat tints of red or black  against which the figure was placed. In the larger pieces the  composition was rather rambling and disjointed, and the color harsh.  In light-and-shade and relief they probably followed the Greek  example.    [Illustration: FIG. 16.--PORTRAIT-HEAD. (FROM FAYOUM, GRAF COL.)]    ROMAN PAINTERS: During the first five centuries Rome was between the  influences of Etruria and Greece. The first paintings in Rome of which  there is record were done in the Temple of Ceres by the Greek artists  of Lower Italy, Gorgasos and Damophilos (fl. 493 B.C.). They were  doubtless somewhat like the vase paintings--profile work, without  light, shade, or perspective. At the time and after Alexander Greek  influence held sway. Fabius Pictor (fl. about 300 B.C.) is one of the  celebrated names in historical painting, and later on Pacuvius,  Metrodorus, and Serapion are mentioned. In the last century of the  Republic, Sopolis, Dionysius, and Antiochus Gabinius excelled in  portraiture. Ancient painting really ends for us with the destruction  of Pompeii (79 A.D.), though after that there were interesting  portraits produced, especially those found in the Fayoum (Egypt).[1]    [Footnote 1: See Scribner's Magazine, vol. v., p. 219, New Series.]         EXTANT REMAINS: The frescos that are left to us to-day are       largely the work of mechanical decorators rather than       creative artists. They are to be seen in Rome, in the Baths       of Titus, the Vatican, Livia's Villa, Farnesina,       Rospigliosi, and Barberini Palaces, Baths of Caracalla,       Capitoline and Lateran Museums, in the houses of excavated       Pompeii, and the Naples Museum. Besides these there are       examples of Roman fresco and distemper in the Louvre and       other European Museums. Examples of Etruscan painting are to       be seen in the Vatican, Cortona, the Louvre, the British       Museum and elsewhere.          CHAPTER IV.    ITALIAN PAINTING.

RISE OF CHRISTIANITY: Out of the decaying civilization of Rome sprang  into life that remarkable growth known as Christianity. It was not  welcomed by the Romans. It was scoffed at, scourged, persecuted, and,  at one time, nearly exterminated. But its vitality was stronger than  that of its persecutor, and when Rome declined, Christianity utilized  the things that were Roman, while striving to live for ideas that were  Christian.    [Illustration: FIG. 17.--CHAMBER IN CATACOMBS, SHOWING WALL  DECORATION.]    There was no revolt, no sudden change. The Christian idea made haste  slowly, and at the start it was weighed down with many paganisms. The  Christians themselves in all save religious faith, were Romans, and  inherited Roman tastes, manners, and methods. But the Roman world,  with all its classicism and learning, was dying. The decline socially  and intellectually was with the Christians as well as the Romans.  There was good reason for it. The times were out of joint, and almost  everything was disorganized, worn out, decadent. The military life of  the Empire had begun to give way to the monastic and feudal life of  the Church. Quarrels and wars between the powers kept life at fever  heat. In the fifth century came the inpouring of the Goths and Huns,  and with them the sacking and plunder of the land. Misery and  squalor, with intellectual blackness, succeeded. Art, science,  literature, and learning degenerated to mere shadows of their former  selves, and a semi-barbarism reigned for five centuries. During all  this dark period Christian painting struggled on in a feeble way,  seeking to express itself. It started Roman in form, method, and even,  at times, in subject; it ended Christian, but not without a long  period of gradual transition, during which it was influenced from many  sources and underwent many changes.    ART MOTIVES: As in the ancient world, there were two principal motives  for painting in early Christian times--religion and decoration.  Religion was the chief motive, but Christianity was a very different  religion from that of the Greeks and Romans. The Hellenistic faith was  a worship of nature, a glorification of humanity, an exaltation of  physical and moral perfections. It dealt with the material and the  tangible, and Greek art appealed directly to the sensuous and earthly  nature of mankind. The Hebraic faith or Christianity was just the  opposite of this. It decried the human, the flesh, and the worldly. It  would have nothing to do with the beauty of this earth. Its hopes were  centred upon the life hereafter. The teaching of Christ was the  humility and the abasement of the human in favor of the spiritual and  the divine. Where Hellenism appealed to the senses, Hebraism appealed  to the spirit.

The shepherds slept; and, glimmering faint,        With twist of thin, blue smoke,      Only their fire's crackling flames        The tender silence broke--      Save when a young lamb raised his head,        Or, when the night wind blew,      A nesting bird would softly stir,        Where dusky olives grew--        With finger on her solemn lip,        Night hushed the shadowy earth,      And only stars and angels saw        The little Saviour's birth;      Then came such flash of silver light        Across the bending skies,      The wondering shepherds woke, and hid        Their frightened, dazzled eyes!        And all their gentle sleepy flock        Looked up, then slept again,      Nor knew the light that dimmed the stars        Brought endless Peace to men--      Nor even heard the gracious words        That down the ages ring--      The Christ is born! the Lord has come,        Good-will on earth to bring!        Then o'er the moonlit, misty fields,        Dumb with the world's great joy,      The shepherds sought the white-walled town,        Where lay the baby boy--      And oh, the gladness of the world,        The glory of the skies,      Because the longed-for Christ looked up        In Mary's happy eyes!           *       *       *       *       *    COLONIAL CHRISTMASES    ALICE MORSE EARLE    [From \"Customs and Fashions in Old New England.\"]    The first century of colonial life saw few set times and days for  pleasure. The holy days of the English Church were as a stench to the  Puritan nostrils, and their public celebration was at once rigidly  forbidden by the laws of New England. New holidays were not quickly  evolved, and the sober gatherings for matters of Church and State for a  time took their place. The hatred of \"wanton Bacchanallian Christmasses\"  spent throughout England, as Cotton said, in \"revelling, dicing,  carding, masking, mumming, consumed in compotations, in interludes, in  excess of wine, in mad mirth,\" was the natural reaction of intelligent  and thoughtful minds against the excesses of a festival which had ceased  to be a Christian holiday, but was dominated by a lord of misrule who  did not hesitate to invade the churches in time of service, in his noisy  revels and sports. English Churchmen long ago revolted also against such  Christmas observance.    Of the first Pilgrim Christmas we know but little, save that it was  spent, as was many a later one, in work....    By 1659 the Puritans had grown to hate Christmas more and more; it was,  to use Shakespeare's words, \"the bug that feared them all.\" The very  name smacked to them of incense, stole, and monkish jargon; any person  who observed it as a holiday by forbearing of labor, feasting, or any  other way was to pay five shillings fine, so desirous were they to  \"beate down every sprout of Episcopacie.\" Judge Sewall watched jealously  the feeling of the people with regard to Christmas, and noted with  pleasure on each succeeding year the continuance of common traffic  throughout the day. Such entries as this show his attitude: \"Dec. 25,  1685. Carts come to town and shops open as usual. Some somehow observe  the day, but are vexed I believe that the Body of people profane it, and  blessed be God no authority yet to compel them to keep it.\" When the  Church of England established Christmas services in Boston a few years  later, we find the Judge waging hopeless war against Governor Belcher  over it, and hear him praising his son for not going with other boy  friends to hear the novel and attractive services. He says: \"I dehort  mine from Christmas keeping and charge them to forbear.\"    Christmas could not be regarded till this century as a New England  holiday, though in certain localities, such as old Narragansett--an  opulent community which was settled by Episcopalians--two weeks of  Christmas visiting and feasting were entered into with zest by both  planters and slaves for many years previous to the revolution.           *       *       *       *       *        THE ANGELS        WILLIAM DRUMMOND        Run, shepherds, run where Bethlehem blest appears.      We bring the best of news; be not dismayed:      A Saviour there is born more old than years,      Amidst heaven's rolling height this earth who stayed.        In a poor cottage inned, a virgin maid,      A weakling did him bear, who all upbears;      There is he poorly swaddled, in manger laid,      To whom too narrow swaddlings are our spheres:      Run, shepherds, run, and solemnize his birth.        This is that night--no, day, grown great with bliss,      In which the power of Satan broken is:      In heaven be glory, peace unto the earth!      Thus singing, through the air the angels swarm,      And cope of stars re-echoed the same.        Or say, if this new Birth of ours      Sleeps, laid within some ark of flowers,      Spangled with dew-light; thou canst clear      All doubts, and manifest the where.        Declare to us, bright star, if we shall seek      Him in the morning's blushing cheek,      Or search the beds of spices through,      To find him out?        _Star_.--No, this ye need not do;      But only come and see Him rest,      A princely babe, in's mother's breast.           *       *       *       *       *        HYMN FOR CHRISTMAS        FELICIA HEMANS        Oh! lovely voices of the sky        Which hymned the Saviour's birth,      Are ye not singing still on high,        Ye that sang, \"Peace on earth\"?          To us yet speak the strains            Wherewith, in time gone by,          Ye blessed the Syrian swains,            Oh! voices of the sky!        Oh! clear and shining light, whose beams        That hour Heaven's glory shed,      Around the palms, and o'er the streams,        And on the shepherd's head.          Be near, through life and death,            As in that holiest night          Of hope, and joy, and faith--            Oh! clear and shining light!           *       *       *       *       *        NEW PRINCE, NEW POMP        ROBERT SOUTHWELL        Behold a simple, tender Babe,        In freezing winter night,      In homely manger trembling lies;        Alas! a piteous sight.        The inns are full; no man will yield        This little Pilgrim bed;      But forced he is with silly beasts        In crib to shroud his head.        Despise him not for lying there;        First what he is inquire:      An Orient pearl is often found        In depth of dirty mire.        Weigh not his crib, his wooden dish,        Nor beasts that by him feed;      Weigh not his mother's poor attire,        Nor Joseph's simple weed.        This stable is a Prince's court,        The crib his chair of state;      The beasts are parcel of his pomp,        The wooden dish his plate.        The persons in that poor attire        His royal liveries wear;      The Prince himself is come from heaven:        This pomp is praised there.        With joy approach, O Christian wight!        Do homage to thy King;      And highly praise this humble pomp,        Which he from heaven doth bring.           *       *       *       *       *        THE THREE KINGS        HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW        Three Kings came riding from far away,        Melchior and Gaspar and Baltasar;      Three Wise Men out of the East were they,      And they traveled by night and they slept by day,        For their guide was a beautiful, wonderful star.        The star was so beautiful, large and clear,        That all the other stars of the sky      Became a white mist in the atmosphere;      And by this they knew that the coming was near        Of the Prince foretold in the prophecy.        Three caskets they bore on their saddle-bows,        Three caskets of gold with golden keys;      Their robes were of crimson silk, with rows      Of bells and pomegranates and furbelows,        Their turbans like blossoming almond-trees.        And so the Three Kings rode into the West,        Through the dusk of night over hill and dell,      And sometimes they nodded with beard on breast,      And sometimes talked, as they paused to rest,        With the people they met at some wayside well.        \"Of the child that is born,\" said Baltasar,        \"Good people, I pray you, tell us the news;      For we in the East have seen his star,      And have ridden fast, and have ridden far,        To find and worship the King of the Jews.\"        And the people answered, \"You ask in vain;        We know of no king but Herod the Great!\"      They thought the Wise Men were men insane,      As they spurred their horses across the plain        Like riders in haste who cannot wait.        And when they came to Jerusalem,        Herod the Great, who had heard this thing,      Sent for the Wise Men and questioned them;      And said, \"Go down unto Bethlehem,        And bring me tidings of this new king.\"        So they rode away, and the star stood still,        The only one in the gray of morn;      Yes, it stopped, it stood still of its own free will,      Right over Bethlehem on the hill,        The city of David where Christ was born.        And the Three Kings rode through the gate and the guard,        Through the silent street, till their horses turned      And neighed as they entered the great inn-yard;      But the windows were closed, and the doors were barred,        And only a light in the stable burned.        And cradled there in the scented hay,        In the air made sweet by the breath of kine,"]]]
