Cicero mentions the Helvellas as a favorite dish  of the Romans.    +THE TRUFFLE = delicacy.+    It will be well to finish this section with the mention of the Truffle.  It may yet be found in the United States, but hitherto its place of  growth has been on the continent of Europe, and especially in France,  where it forms an article of commerce, and is highly prized as food. It  is subterranean, and requires for its discovery a higher sense of smell  than man possesses. It is generally found by the hog and the dog, who  are trained to help the truffle hunters. There are some species in our  country that resemble it, and grow underneath the ground. One, found in  the Southern States, called Rhizopogon, grows in sandy soil. This  species, however, does not belong to Class II., but to Class I., the  Gasteromycetes, or Stomach fungi. It is not likely that the beginner  will find this mushroom, so no description will be given.      GENERAL HELPS TO THE MEMORY.    There are certain facts which if committed to memory will be of great  help to beginners in classifying mushrooms. There are distinctive  features belonging to different genera, which will be enumerated as  follows. These facts apply to the order of Agarics, containing the  largest number of familiar mushrooms. They have been placed in tables  for the convenience of the beginner, and are arranged without regard to  family relationship.    _Mushrooms Containing both Volva and Ring (Annulus)._      There is only one genus that has both volva and ring.

Having arranged these lists of mushrooms by their different  characteristics, and then by the color of the spores, we will give a  list of fungi familiar to most persons, classified according to the  colors of the cap. The far greater number have been analyzed by the  writers, and a full description is given to enable the beginner more  easily to identify them.    The reader will notice that in the lists of fungi given above there are  certain genera not elsewhere mentioned in this book. He will understand  that it is inadvisable in a short primer to allude to all the genera  that exist. It was, however, impossible to give a complete table without  including them in it.      [Illustration: Russula pectinata.    Photographed by C. G. Lloyd.]          DESCRIPTIONS OF FUNGI, ARRANGED ACCORDING TO COLOR OF CAP ONLY.      MUSHROOMS WITH RED OR PINK COLORED CAP.    The genus Russula probably contains the largest number of mushrooms with  reddish caps, the word Russula meaning reddish.      +RUSSULA EMETICA = a vomit.+    +The Nauseating Russula.+    +Cap+ bright blood red, at first rosy, then blood color, tawny when old,  3 to 4 inches broad, first bell-shaped, then flattened or depressed,  polished, margin at length grooved (sulcate), flesh white, reddish under  the cuticle. +Stem+ 1 1/2 to 3 inches long, 3/4 of an inch thick, white  or with a reddish hue, spongy, stuffed, stout, elastic when young,  fragile when old, even, tapering slightly upward. +Gills+ free, broad,  rather distant, white.    This is found on the ground among dead leaves, in the woods and open  places from July to December. It has a bitter taste, and is said to be  poisonous. Those eating it are often affected as if they had taken an  emetic. It is easily distinguished by the fact of the flesh turning red  immediately under the skin when it is peeled off. There are numerous  varieties of it, in one the stem has minute wrinkles running lengthwise.  We found it in different localities. The taste was acrid. It was one of  the first and the last mushrooms that we gathered. (Poisonous.)      +RUSSULA SANGUINEA = blood.+    +The Blood-colored Russula.+    +Cap+ blood red, becoming pale at margin, 2 to 3 inches broad, at first  convex, then depressed, and funnel-shaped (infundibuliform), irregularly  swollen in the centre, polished, even, margin acute, moist in damp  weather. Flesh firm, cheesy, white. +Stem+ stout, spongy, stuffed, at  first contracted at apex, then equal, slightly marked with lines white  or reddish. +Gills+ at first fastened to stem and then decurrent,  crowded, narrow, connected by veins, fragile, somewhat forked, shining  white, afterward turning ochraceous color. The taste is acrid and  peppery. It is found in woods from August to September, and is not  common. (Poisonous.)      +RUSSULA ROSEIPES = rosy stem.+    +The Rosy Stemmed Russula.+    This is a striking-looking mushroom. The colors are pretty, and the  tinge of red in the stem adds to its beauty. There are other species of  Russula that also have red tints in the stem. +Cap+ rosy red, with pink  and orange hues, 1 to 2 inches broad, convex, becoming nearly plane or  slightly depressed; at first viscid, soon dry, slightly marked with  lines on the thin margin, taste mild. +Gills+ moderately close, nearly  entire, rounded behind and slightly adnexed, swollen in the middle,  whitish, becoming yellow. +Stem+ 1 to 2 inches long, 3 to 4 lines thick,  slightly tapering upward, stuffed or hollow, white, tinged with red.  It is distinguished from other species by its mild taste, rosy cap,  commonly dry and but slightly striate on margin, its gills changing from  white to yellow or slightly ochraceous, and being partially attached to  the stem, and its stem being slightly stained with rosy red. It grows in  pine and hemlock woods, and is found in July and August. (Edible.)      +RUSSULA LEPIDA = neat or elegant.+    +The Elegant Russula.+    +Cap+ at first is a bright red, but becomes a dull reddish-pink, paler  at the disc, 3 inches broad, dry, fleshy, convex; then expanded,  scarcely depressed, obtuse and polished, afterward cracked (rimose), and  with minute scales (squamulose). The margin spreading and rounded,  obtuse, _not_ striate. +Stem+ about 3 inches long, from 1 to 1 1/2 inch  thick, even, solid, white, or rose color. +Gills+ rounded behind, rather  thick, somewhat crowded, often forked, connected by veins, white, often  red at edge. Taste mild. We found our specimen in mixed woods. The stem  was only tinged with pink. (Edible.)      +LACTARIUS VOLEMUS = a kind of large pear. (From its shape.)+    +The Orange Brown Lactarius.+    +Cap+ 3 to 5 inches broad, reddish-orange color, becoming pale, compact,  rigid, obtuse, with the margin bent inward, depressed, at length marked  with lines like a river (rimose). Flesh white, turning brown. +Stem+  2 to 3 inches long, 3/4 to 1 1/4 inch thick, stout, stuffed,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18458"],[0,"Star Born (#7)"],[1,". But until this moment Raf had never felt  the real careless freedom of youth. Now he was moved by a desire to  disobey orders--to take the flitter up by himself and head off into  the blue of the brightening sky for more than just a test flight, not  to explore Hobart's city but to cruise over the vast sea of grass and  find out its wonders for himself.    But the discipline which had shaped him almost since birth sent him  now to check the flyer and wait, inwardly impatient, for Hobart,  Lablet, and Soriki, the com-tech, to join him.    The wait was not a long one since the three others, with equipment  hung about, tramped down the ramp as Raf settled himself behind the  control board of the flyer. He triggered the shield which snapped over  them for a windbreak and brought the flitter up into the spreading  color of the morning. Beside him Hobart pressed the button of the  automatic recorder, and in the seat behind, Soriki had the headset of  the com clamped over his ears. They were not only making a record of  their trip, they were continuing in constant communication with the  ship--now already a silver pencil far to the rear.    It was some two hours later that they discovered what was perhaps one  reason for the isolation of the district in which the _RS 10_ had set  down. Rolling foothills rose beneath them and miles ahead the  white-capped peaks of a mountain range made a broken outline against  the turquoise sky. The broken lands would be a formidable barrier for  any foot travelers: there were no easy roads through that series of  sharp lifts and narrow valleys. And the one stream they followed for a  short space descended from the heights in spectacular falls. Twice  they skimmed thick growths of trees, so tightly packed that from the  air they resembled a matted carpet of green-blue. And to cut through  such a forest would be an impossible task.    The four in the flitter seldom spoke. Raf kept his attention on the  controls. Sudden currents of air were tricky here, and he had to be  constantly alert to hold the small flyer on an even keel. His glimpses  of what lay below were only snatched ones.    At last it was necessary to zoom far above the vegetation of the lower  slopes, to reach an altitude safe enough to clear the peaks ahead.  Since the air supply within the windshield was constant they need not  fear lack of oxygen. But Raf was privately convinced, as they soared,  that the range might well compare in height with those Asian mountains  which dominated all the upflung reaches of his native world.    When they were over the sharp points of that chain disaster almost  overtook them. A freakish air current caught the flitter as if in a  giant hand, and Raf fought for control as they lost altitude past the  margin of safety. Had he not allowed for just such a happening they  might have been smashed against one of the rock tips over which they  skimmed to a precarious safety. Raf, his mouth dry, his hands sweating  on the controls, took them up--higher than was necessary--to coast  above the last of that rocky spine to see below the beginning of the  downslopes leading to the plains the range cut in half. He heard  Hobart draw a hissing breath.    \"That was a close call.\" Lablet's precise, lecturer's voice cut  through the drone of the motor.    \"Yeah,\" Soriki echoed, \"looked like we might be sandwich meat there  for a while. The kid knows his stuff after all.\"    Raf grinned a little sourly, but he did not answer that. He _ought_ to  know his trade. Why else would he be along? They were each specialists  in one or two fields. But he had good sense enough to keep his mouth  shut. That way the less one had to regret minutes--or hours--later.    The land on the south side of the mountains was different in character  to the wild northern plains.    \"Fields!\"    It did not require that identification from Lablet to point out what  they had already seen. The section below was artificially divided into  long narrow strips. But the vegetation growing on those strips was no  different from the northern grass they had seen about the spacer.    \"Not cultivated now,\" the scientist amended his first report. \"It's  reverting to grassland--\"    Raf brought the flitter closer to the ground so that when a domed  structure arose out of a tangle of overgrown shrubs and trees they  were not more than fifty feet above it. There was no sign of life  about the dwelling, if dwelling it was, and the unkempt straggle of  growing things suggested that it had been left to itself through more  than one season. Lablet wanted to set down and explore, but the  captain was intent upon reaching the city. A solitary farm was of  little value compared with what they might learn from a metropolis.  So, rather to Raf's relief, he was ordered on.    He could not have explained why he shrank from such investigation.  Where earlier that morning he had wanted to take the flitter and go  off by himself to explore the world which seemed so bright and new,  now he was glad that he was only the pilot of the flyer and that the  others were not only in his company but ready to make the decisions.  He had a queer distaste for the countryside, a disinclination to land  near that dome.    Beyond the first of the deserted farms they came to the highway and,  since the buckled and half-buried roadway ran south, Hobart suggested  that they use it as a visible guide. More isolated dome houses showed  in the course of an hour. And their fields were easy to map from the  air. But nowhere did the Terrans see any indication that those fields  were in use. Nor were there any signs of animal or bird life. The  weird desolation of the landscape began to work its spell on the men  in the flitter. There was something unnatural about the country, and  with every mile the flyer clocked off, Raf longed to be heading in the  opposite direction.    The domes drew closer together, made a cluster at crossroads, gathered  into a town in which all the buildings were the same shape and size,  like the cells of a wasp nest. Raf wondered if those who had built  them had not been humanoid at all, but perhaps insects with a hive  mind. And because that thought was unpleasant he resolutely turned his  attention to the machine he piloted.    They passed over four such towns, all marking intersections of roads  running east and west, north and south, with precise exactness. The  sun was at noon or a little past that mark when Captain Hobart gave  the order to set down so that they could break out rations and eat.    Raf brought the flitter down on the cracked surface of the road,  mistrusting what might lie hidden in the field grass. They got out and  walked for a space along pavement which had once been smooth.    \"High-powered traffic--\" That was Lablet. He had gone down on one  knee and was tracing a finger along the substance.    \"Straight--\" Soriki squinted against the sun. \"Nothing stopped them,  did it? We want a road here and we'll get it! That sort of thing. Must  have been master engineers.\"    To Raf the straight highways suggested something else. Master  engineering, certainly. But a ruthlessness too, as if the builders,  who refused to accept any modifications of their original plans from  nature, might be as arrogant and self-assured in other ways. He did  not admire this relic of civilization; in fact it added to his vague  uneasiness.    The land was so still, under the whisper of the wind. He discovered  that he was listening--listening for the buzz of an insect, the squeak  of some grass dweller, anything which would mean that there was life  about them. As he chewed on the ration concentrate and drank sparingly  from his canteen, Raf continued to listen. Without result.    Hobart and Lablet were engrossed in speculation about what might lie  ahead. Soriki had gone back to the flitter to make his report to the  ship. The pilot sat where he was, content to be forgotten, but eager  to see an animal peering at him from cover, a bird winging through the  air.    \"--if we don't hit it by nightfall--But we can't be that far away!  I'll stay out and try tomorrow.\" That was Hobart. And since he was  captain what he said was probably what they would do. Raf shied away  from the thought of spending the night in this haunted land. Though,  on the other hand, he would be utterly opposed to lifting the flitter  over those mountains again except in broad daylight.    But the problem did not arise, for they found their city in the  midafternoon, the road bringing them straight to an amazing collection  of buildings, which appeared doubly alien to their eyes since it did  not include any of the low domes they had seen heretofore.    Here were towers of needle slimness, solid blocks of almost windowless  masonry looking twice as bulky beside those same towers, archways  stringing at dizzy heights above the ground from one skyscraper to the  next. And here time and nature had been at work. Some of the towers  were broken off, a causeway displayed a gap--Once it had been a  breathtaking feat of engineering, far more impressive than the  highway, now it was a slowly collapsing ruin.    But before they had time to take it all in Soriki gave an exclamation.  \"Something coming through on our wave band, sir!\" He leaned forward to  dig fingers into Hobart's shoulder. \"Message of some kind--I'd swear  to it!\"    Hobart snapped into action. \"Kurbi--set down--there!\"    His choice of a landing place was the flat top of a near-by building,  one which stood a little apart from its neighbors and, as Raf could  see, was not overlooked except by a ruined tower. He circled the  flitter. The machine had been specially designed to land and take off  in confined spaces, and he knew all there was possible to learn about  its handling on his home world. But he had never tried to bring it  down on a roof, and he was very sure that now he had no margin for  error left him, not with Hobart"]]]
