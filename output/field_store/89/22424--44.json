The difference between _key_ and _scale_ is therefore this,       that while both _key_ and _scale_ employ the same tone       material, by _key_ we mean the material in general, without       any particular order or arrangement in mind, while by _scale_       we mean the same tones, but now arranged into a regular       ascending or descending series. It should be noted in this       connection also that not all scales present an equally good       opportunity of having their tones used as a basis for tonality       or key-feeling: neither the chromatic nor the whole-step scale       possess the necessary characteristics for being used as       tonality scales in the same sense that our major and minor       scales are so used.    79. There are _three general classes of scales_ extant at the present  time, viz.: (1) Diatonic; (2) Chromatic; (3) Whole-tone.[13]    [Footnote 13: If strictly logical terminology is to be insisted upon the  whole-tone scale should be called the \"whole-step\" scale.]    80. The word _diatonic_ means \"through the tones\" (_i.e._, through the  tones of the key), and is applied to both major and minor scales of our  modern tonality system. In general a diatonic scale may be defined as  one which proceeds by half-steps and whole-steps. There is, however, one  exception to this principle, viz., in the progression six to seven in  the harmonic minor scale, which is of course a step-and-a-half. (See p.  33, Sec. 86.)    81. A _major diatonic scale_ is one in which the intervals between the  tones are arranged as follows:    1  whole  2  whole  3  half  4  whole  5  whole  6  whole  7  half  8     step      step      step     step      step      step      step    In other words, a major diatonic scale is one in which the intervals  between three and four, and between seven and eight are half-steps, all  the others being whole-steps. A composition based on this scale is said  to be written in the major mode, or in a major key. The major diatonic  scale may begin on any one of the twelve pitches C, C[sharp] or D[flat],  D, D[sharp] or E[flat], E, F, F[sharp] or G[flat], G, G[sharp] or  A[flat], A, A[sharp] or B[flat], B, but in each case it is the same  scale because the intervals between its tones are the same. We have then  one major scale only, but this scale may be written in many different  positions, and may be sung or played beginning on any one of a number of  different pitches.    82. It is interesting to note that the major scale consists of two  identical series of four tones each; _i.e._, the first four tones of the  scale are separated from one another by exactly the same intervals and  these intervals appear in exactly the same order as in the case of the  last four tones of the scale. Fig. 53 will make this clear. The first  four tones of any diatonic scale (major or minor) are often referred to  as the _lower tetrachord_[14] and the upper four tones as the _upper  tetrachord_.    [Footnote 14: The word _tetrachord_ means literally \"four strings\" and  refers to the primitive instrument, the four strings of which were so  tuned that the lowest and the highest tones produced were a perfect  fourth apart. With the Greeks the tetrachord was the unit of analysis as  the octave is with us to-day, and all Greek scales are capable of  division into two tetrachords, the arrangement of the intervals between  the tones in each tetrachord differentiating one scale from another, but  the tetrachords themselves always consisting of groups of four tones,  the highest being a perfect fourth above the lowest.]    [Illustration: Fig. 53.]    It is interesting further to note that the upper tetrachord of any  _sharp_ scale is always used without change as the lower tetrachord of  the next major scale involving sharps, while the lower tetrachord of any  _flat_ scale is used as the upper tetrachord of the next flat scale. See  Figs. 54 and 55.    [Illustration: Fig. 54.]    [Illustration: Fig. 55.]    83. From the standpoint of staff notation the major scale may be written  in fifteen different positions, as follows:    [Illustration]    It will be observed that in the above series of scales those beginning  on F[sharp] and G[flat] call for the same keys on the piano, _i.e._,  while the notation is different, the actual tones of the scale are the  same. The scales of C[sharp] and D[flat] likewise employ the same tones.  When two scales thus employ the same tones but differ in notation they  are said to be _enharmonic_, (cf. p. 38, Sec. 93.)         _Note_.--The student is advised to adopt some uniform method       of writing scales, preferably the one followed in those given       above, the necessary sharps and flats appearing before the       notes in the scale and then repeated collectively at the end       as a signature. He is also advised to repeat these scales and       signatures over and over until absolute familiarity is       attained. _E.g._, E--F[sharp]--G[sharp]--A--B--C[sharp]--D[sharp]--E;       signature, four sharps, F, C, G, and D.          CHAPTER VIII    SCALES (_Continued_)      84. The _minor diatonic scale_ is used in several slightly different  forms, but the characteristic interval between the first and third tones  (which differentiates it from the major scale) remains the same in every  case. This interval between the first and third tones consists of four  half-steps in the major scale and of three half-steps in the minor scale  and this difference in size has given rise to the designation _major_  for the scale having the larger third, and _minor_ for the scale having  the smaller one.    85. _The original (or primitive) form_ of the minor scale has its tones  arranged as follows.    1  whole  2  half  3  whole  4  whole  5  half  6  whole  7  whole  8     step      step     step      step     step     step      step    As its name implies, this is the oldest of the three forms (being  derived from the old Greek Aeolian scale), but because of the absence of  a \"leading tone\" it is suitable for the simplest one-part music only,  and is therefore little used at present.    86. _The harmonic minor scale_ is like the primitive form except that it  substitutes a tone one half-step higher for the seventh tone of the  older (_i.e._, the primitive) form. This change was made because the  development of writing music in several parts (particularly _harmonic_  part-writing) made necessary a \"leading tone,\" _i.e._, a tone with a  strong tendency to move on up to the key-tone as a closing point. In  order to secure a tone with such a strongly upward tendency the  interval between _seven_ and _eight_ had to be reduced in size to a  half-step. It should be noted that this change in the seventh tone of  the scale caused an interval of a step-and-a-half between the sixth and  seventh tones of the scale.    1  whole  2  half  3  whole  4  whole  5  half  6  step and  7  half 8     step      step     step      step      step      a half      step    87. _The melodic minor scale_ substitutes a tone one half-step higher  than six as well as one a half-step higher than seven, but this change  is made in the ascending scale only, the descending scale being like the  primitive form. The higher sixth (commonly referred to as the \"raised  sixth\") was used to get rid of the unmelodic interval of a  step-and-a-half[15] (augmented second), while the return to the  primitive form in descending is made because the ascending form is too  much like the tonic major scale.    [Footnote 15: The step-and-a-half (augmented second) is \"unmelodic\"  because it is the same size as a _minor third_ and the mind finds it  difficult to take in as a _second_ (notes representing it being on  adjacent staff-degrees) an interval of the same size as a third.]    1  whole  2  half  3  whole  4  whole  5  whole  6  whole  7  half  8     step      step     step      step      step      step      step              7  whole  6  half  5  whole  4  whole  3  half  2  whole  1               step      step     step      step      step     step    This form is used only to a very limited extent, and then principally in  vocal music, the harmonic form being in almost universal use in spite of  the augmented second.    88. The minor scale in its various positions (up to five sharps and five  flats) and in all three forms follows: a composition based on any one of  these forms (or upon a mixture of them, which often occurs) is said to  be _in the minor mode_. It will be noted that the first four tones are  alike in all three forms; _i.e._, the lower tetrachord in the minor  scale is invariable no matter, what may happen to the upper tetrachord.  The sign + marks the step-and-a-half.    [Illustration]         _Note._--The student is advised to recite the _harmonic form_       of the minor scale as was suggested in the case of the major       scale, noting that the \"raised seventh\" does not affect the       key-signature. _E.g._,--E--F[sharp]--G--A--B--C--D[sharp]--E;       signature, one sharp, F.    89. A minor scale having the same signature as a major scale is said to  be its _relative minor_. _E.g._,--e is the relative minor of G, c of  E[flat], d of F, etc., the small letter being used to refer to the minor  key or scale, while the capital letter indicates the major key or scale  unless accompanied by the word _minor_. Relative keys are therefore  defined as those having the same signature. G and e are relative keys,  as are also A and f[sharp], etc.    90. A minor scale beginning with the same tone as a major scale is  referred to as its _tonic minor_. Thus, _e.g._, c with three flats in  its signature is the tonic minor of C with all degrees in natural  condition; e with one sharp is the tonic minor of E with four sharps,  etc. Tonic keys are therefore those having the same key-tone.    91.

There appeared  no necessity for any arbitrary selection of these emigrants; there was  always a sufficient number who volunteered to depart.    These subdivided states, petty if we regard either territory or  population,--all appertained to one vast general family. They spoke  the same language, though the dialects might slightly differ. They  intermarried; They maintained the same general laws and customs; and so  important a bond between these several communities was the knowledge  of vril and the practice of its agencies, that the word A-Vril was  synonymous with civilisation; and Vril-ya, signifying \"The Civilised  Nations,\" was the common name by which the communities employing the  uses of vril distinguished themselves from such of the Ana as were yet  in a state of barbarism.    The government of the tribe of Vril-ya I am treating of was apparently  very complicated, really very simple. It was based upon a principle  recognised in theory, though little carried out in practice, above  ground--viz., that the object of all systems of philosophical thought  tends to the attainment of unity, or the ascent through all intervening  labyrinths to the simplicity of a single first cause or principle.  Thus in politics, even republican writers have agreed that a benevolent  autocracy would insure the best administration, if there were any  guarantees for its continuance, or against its gradual abuse of the  powers accorded to it. This singular community elected therefore a  single supreme magistrate styled Tur; he held his office nominally  for life, but he could seldom be induced to retain it after the first  approach of old age. There was indeed in this society nothing to induce  any of its members to covet the cares of office. No honours, no insignia  of higher rank, were assigned to it. The supreme magistrate was not  distinguished from the rest by superior habitation or revenue. On the  other hand, the duties awarded to him were marvellously light and easy,  requiring no preponderant degree of energy or intelligence. There being  no apprehensions of war, there were no armies to maintain; there being  no government of force, there was no police to appoint and direct. What  we call crime was utterly unknown to the Vril-ya; and there were no  courts of criminal justice. The rare instances of civil disputes were  referred for arbitration to friends chosen by either party, or decided  by the Council of Sages, which will be described later. There were  no professional lawyers; and indeed their laws were but amicable  conventions, for there was no power to enforce laws against an offender  who carried in his staff the power to destroy his judges. There were  customs and regulations to compliance with which, for several ages,  the people had tacitly habituated themselves; or if in any instance an  individual felt such compliance hard, he quitted the community and went  elsewhere. There was, in fact, quietly established amid this state,  much the same compact that is found in our private families, in which we  virtually say to any independent grown-up member of the family whom  we receive to entertain, \"Stay or go, according as our habits and  regulations suit or displease you.\" But though there were no laws such  as we call laws, no race above ground is so law-observing. Obedience to  the rule adopted by the community has become as much an instinct as  if it were implanted by nature. Even in every household the head of it  makes a regulation for its guidance, which is never resisted nor even  cavilled at by those who belong to the family. They have a proverb,  the pithiness of which is much lost in this paraphrase, \"No happiness  without order, no order without authority, no authority without unity.\"  The mildness of all government among them, civil or domestic, may be  signalised by their idiomatic expressions for such terms as illegal or  forbidden--viz., \"It is requested not to do so and so.\" Poverty among  the Ana is as unknown as crime; not that property is held in common, or  that all are equals in the extent of their possessions or the size and  luxury of their habitations: but there being no difference of rank or  position between the grades of wealth or the choice of occupations, each  pursues his own inclinations without creating envy or vying; some like  a modest, some a more splendid kind of life; each makes himself happy in  his own way. Owing to this absence of competition, and the limit placed  on the population, it is difficult for a family to fall into distress;  there are no hazardous speculations, no emulators striving for superior  wealth and rank. No doubt, in each settlement all originally had the  same proportions of land dealt out to them; but some, more adventurous  than others, had extended their possessions farther into the bordering  wilds, or had improved into richer fertility the produce of their  fields, or entered into commerce or trade. Thus, necessarily, some  had grown richer than others, but none had become absolutely poor, or  wanting anything which their tastes desired. If they did so, it was  always in their power to migrate, or at the worst to apply, without  shame and with certainty of aid, to the rich, for all the members of  the community considered themselves as brothers of one affectionate and  united family. More upon this head will be treated of incidentally as my  narrative proceeds.    The chief care of the supreme magistrate was to communicate with certain  active departments charged with the administration of special details.  The most important and essential of such details was that connected with  the due provision of light. Of this department my host, Aph-Lin, was  the chief. Another department, which might be called the foreign,  communicated with the neighbouring kindred states, principally for the  purpose of ascertaining all new inventions; and to a third department  all such inventions and improvements in machinery were committed for  trial. Connected with this department was the College of Sages--a  college especially favoured by such of the Ana as were widowed and  childless, and by the young unmarried females, amongst whom Zee was  the most active, and, if what we call renown or distinction was a thing  acknowledged by this people (which I shall later show it is not), among  the more renowned or distinguished. It is by the female Professors  of this College that those studies which are deemed of least use in  practical life--as purely speculative philosophy, the history of remote  periods, and such sciences as entomology, conchology, &c.--are the more  diligently cultivated. Zee, whose mind, active as Aristotle's, equally  embraced the largest domains and the minutest details of thought, had  written two volumes on the parasite insect that dwells amid the hairs  of a tiger's* paw, which work was considered the best authority on that  interesting subject.    * The animal here referred to has many points of difference from the  tiger of the upper world. It is larger, and with a broader paw, and  still more receding frontal. It haunts the side of lakes and pools,  and feeds principally on fishes, though it does not object to any  terrestrial animal of inferior strength that comes in its way. It is  becoming very scarce even in the wild districts, where it is devoured  by gigantic reptiles. I apprehended that it clearly belongs to the tiger  species, since the parasite animalcule found in its paw, like that in  the Asiatic tiger, is a miniature image of itself.    But the researches of the sages are not confined to such subtle or  elegant studies. They comprise various others more important, and  especially the properties of vril, to the perception of which their  finer nervous organisation renders the female Professors eminently keen.  It is out of this college that the Tur, or chief magistrate, selects  Councillors, limited to three, in the rare instances in which novelty of  event or circumstance perplexes his own judgment.    There are a few other departments of minor consequence, but all are  carried on so noiselessly, and quietly that the evidence of a government  seems to vanish altogether, and social order to be as regular and  unobtrusive as if it were a law of nature. Machinery is employed to an  inconceivable extent in all the operations of labour within and without  doors, and it is the unceasing object of the department charged with its  administration to extend its efficiency. There is no class of labourers  or servants, but all who are required to assist or control the machinery  are found in the children, from the time they leave the care of their  mothers to the marriageable age, which they place at sixteen for the  Gy-ei (the females), twenty for the Ana (the males). These children are  formed into bands and sections under their own chiefs, each following  the pursuits in which he is most pleased, or for which he feels himself  most fitted. Some take to handicrafts, some to agriculture, some to  household work, and some to the only services of danger to which the  population is exposed; for the sole perils that threaten this tribe are,  first, from those occasional convulsions within the earth, to foresee  and guard against which tasks their utmost ingenuity--irruptions of fire  and water, the storms of subterranean winds and escaping gases. At  the borders of the domain, and at all places where such peril might  be apprehended, vigilant inspectors are stationed with telegraphic  communications to the hall in which chosen sages take it by turns to  hold perpetual sittings. These inspectors are always selected from the  elder boys approaching the age of puberty, and on the principle that at  that age observation is more acute and the physical forces more alert  than at any other. The second service of danger, less grave, is in the  destruction of all creatures hostile to the life, or the culture, or  even the comfort, of the Ana. "]]]
