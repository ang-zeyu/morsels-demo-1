In a quarter of an hour  they arrived at the gate of a large barracks. The guard turned out  as soon as the marshal was seen approaching, and a trumpet call was  heard in the courtyard as they entered the gate.    Fergus was struck with the spectacle, the like of which he had  never seen before. The whole regiment was drawn up in parade order.  The colonel was some distance in the front, the officers ranged at  intervals behind him. Suddenly the colonel raised his sword above  his head, a flash of steel ran along the line, eight trumpeters  sounded the first note of a military air, and the regiment stood at  the salute, men and horses immovable, as if carved in stone. A  minute later the music stopped, the colonel raised his sword again,  there was another flash of steel, and the salute was over. Then the  colonel rode forward to meet the marshal.    \"Nothing could have been better, my dear colonel,\" the latter said.  \"As I told you yesterday, my inspection of your regiment is but a  mere form, for I know well that nothing could be more perfect than  its order; but I must report to the king that I have inspected all  the regiments now in Berlin and Potsdam, and others that will form  my command, should any untoward event disturb the peace of the  country.    \"But before I begin, permit me to present to you this young officer,  who was yesterday appointed to your regiment. I have already spoken  to you of him. This is Cornet Fergus Drummond, a cousin of my own,  and whom I recommend strongly to you. As I informed you, he will for  the present act as one of my aides-de-camp.\"    \"You have lost no time in getting your uniform, Mr. Drummond,\" the  colonel said. \"I am sure that you will be most cordially received,  by all my officers as by myself, as a relation of the marshal, whom  we all respect and love.\"    \"I will now proceed to the inspection,\" the marshal said, and he  proceeded towards the end of the line.    The colonel rode beside him, but a little behind. The two  aides-de-camp followed, and the four troopers brought up the rear.  They proceeded along the front rank, the officers having before  this taken up their position in the line. The marshal looked  closely at each man as he passed, horse as well as man being  inspected.    \"I do not think, colonel, that the king himself could have  discovered the slightest fault or blemish. The regiment is simply  perfect. I hope that during the next few days you will have every  shoe inspected by the farrier, and every one showing the least  signs of wear taken off and replaced; and that you will also direct  the captains of troops to see that the men's kits are in perfect  order.\"    \"That shall be done, sir, though I own that I cannot see against  whom we are likely to march; for though the air is full of rumours,  all our neighbours seem to think of nothing so little as war.\"    \"It may be,\" Keith said with a smile, \"that it is merely his  majesty's intention to see in how short a time we can place an  army, complete in every particular and ready for a campaign, in the  field. His majesty is fond of trying military experiments.\"    \"I hope, marshal, that you will do us the honour of drinking a  goblet of champagne with us. Some of my officers have not yet been  presented to you, and I shall be glad to take the opportunity of  doing so.\"    \"With pleasure, colonel. A good offer should never be refused.\"    By this time they had moved to the front of the regiment.    \"Officers and men of the 3rd Royal Dragoon Guards,\" Keith said in a  loud voice, \"I shall have great pleasure in reporting to the king  the result of my inspection, that the regiment is in a state of  perfect efficiency, and that I have been unable to detect the  smallest irregularity or blemish. I am quite sure that, if you  should at any time be called upon to fight the enemies of your  country, you will show that your conduct and courage will be fully  equal to the excellence of your appearance. I feel that whatever  men can do you will do.    \"God save the king!\"    He lifted his plumed hat. The trumpet sounded, the men gave the  royal salute, and then a loud cheer burst from the ranks; for the  rumours current had raised a feeling of excitement throughout the  regiment, and though no man could see from what point danger  threatened, all felt that great events were at hand.    The regiment was then dismissed, hoarse words of command were  shouted, and each troop moved off to its stable; while the colonel  and Keith rode to the officers' anteroom, the trumpets at the same  time sounding the officers' call. In a few minutes all were  gathered there. The colonel first presented some of his young  officers to the marshal, and then introduced Fergus to his new  comrades, among whom were two Scotch officers.    \"Mr. Drummond will, for the present, serve with the marshal as one  of his aides-de-camp; but I hope that he will soon join the  regiment where, at any rate, he will at all times find a warm  welcome.\"    Keith had already told the colonel that, for the present, Fergus  would be released from all duty as an aide-de-camp, and would spend  his time in acquiring the rudiments of drill.    Champagne was now served round. The officers drank the health of  the marshal, and he in return drank to the regiment; then all  formality was laid aside for a time, and the marshal laughed and  chatted with the officers, as if he had been one of themselves.  Fergus was surrounded by a group, who were all pleased at finding  that he could already talk the language fluently; and in spite of  the jealousy of the Scottish officers, felt throughout the service,  the impression that he made was a very favourable one; and the  hostility of race was softened by the fact that he was a near  relation of the marshal, who was universally popular. He won  favour, too, by saying, when the colonel asked whether he would  rather have a Scottish or a Prussian trooper assigned to him, as  servant and orderly, that he would choose one of the latter.    After speaking to the adjutant the colonel gave an order and, two  minutes later, a tall and powerful trooper entered the room and  saluted. The adjutant went up to him.    \"Karl Hoger,\" he said, \"you are appointed orderly and servant to  Mr. Fergus Drummond. He is quartered at the officers' house, facing  the palace. You will take your horse round there, and await his  arrival. He will show you where it is to be stabled. You are  released from all regimental duty until further orders.\"    The man saluted and retired, without the slightest change of face  to show whether the appointment was agreeable to him, or otherwise.    Half an hour later the marshal mounted and, with his party, rode  back to the palace. After he had dismounted, Lindsay and Fergus  rode across to their quarters. Karl Hoger was standing at the  entrance, holding his horse. He saluted as the two officers came  up.    \"I will go in and see if dinner is ready,\" Lindsay said. \"I told  Donald that we should be back at half-past one, and it is nearly  two now, and I am as hungry as a hunter.\"    Fergus led the way to the stable, and pointed out to the trooper  the two stalls that the horses were to occupy; for each room in the  officers' quarters had two stalls attached to it, the one for the  occupant, the other for his orderly.    \"I suppose you have not dined yet, Karl?\"    \"No, sir, but that does not matter.\"    \"I don't want you to begin by fasting. Here are a couple of marks.  When you have stabled the horses and finished here, you had better  go out and get yourself dinner. I shall not be able to draw rations  for you for today.    \"After you have done, come to the main entrance where I met you and  take the first corridor to the left. Mine is the fifth door on the  right-hand side. If I am not in, knock at the next door to it on  this side. You will see Lieutenant Lindsay's name on it.    \"You need not be in any hurry over your meal, for I am just going  to have dinner, and certainly shall not want you for an hour.\"    On reaching Lindsay's quarters Fergus found that dinner was  waiting, and he and Lindsay lost no time in attacking a fine fish  that Donald had bought in the market.    \"That is a fine regiment of yours, Drummond,\" Lindsay said.    \"Magnificent. Of course, I never saw anything like it before, but  it was certainly splendid.\"    \"Yes. They distinguished themselves in the campaigns of Silesia  very much. Their colonel, Grim, is a capital officer--very strict,  but a really good fellow, and very much liked by his officers.  However, if I were you, I should be in no hurry to join. I had two  years and a half in an infantry regiment, before Keith appointed me  one of his aides-de-camp, and I can tell you it was hard  work--drill from morning till night. We were stationed at a  miserable country place, without any amusements or anything to do;  and as at that time there did not seem the most remote chance of  active service, it was a dog's life. Everyone was surly and ill  tempered, and I had to fight two duels.\"    \"What about?\"    \"About nothing, as far as I could see. A man said something about  Scotch officers, in a tone I did not like. I was out of temper, and  instead of turning it off with a laugh I took it up seriously, and  threw a glass at his head. So of course we fought. We wounded each  other twice, and then the others stopped it. The second affair was  just as absurd, except that there I got the best of it, and sliced  the man's sword arm so deeply that he was on the sick list for two  months--the result of an accident, as the surgeon put it down. So  although I don't say but that there is a much better class of men  in the 3rd than there was in my regiment, I should not be in any  hurry to join.    \"If"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19715"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Norwich (#7)"],[1,"   The battlementing to the presbytery also was added at the same time as  the flying buttresses.    It will also be noted that here, as in the nave, an addition was made in  the way of a range of later \"Perpendicular\" windows superimposed over  the original Norman triforium, which was blocked up.    #The Chapel of St. Mary-the-Less#, marked B on plan, projects southward  from the presbytery, and dates from the fourteenth century. Between this  and the circular Norman chapel of St. Luke, was Bishop Wakeryng's  chapel. It has long since disappeared, but the doorway of Perpendicular  design remained until about 1841, when it was removed and the  compartment Normanised--a piece of wanton vandalism and the destruction  of an historical link.    The circular Norman chapels, of which two remain, are very interesting.  In the original plan of the founder there were three; but the  easternmost was superseded by Early English structure, which in its turn  was demolished.    #The Chapel of Saint Luke#, marked C on plan, flanking the south side of  the apse, was much restored in the sixties; in Britton's \"Norwich,\"  published in 1816, late \"Decorated\" windows are shown; these were  replaced by _modern_ Norman. Its form is peculiar; on plan, that of two  circles interpenetrating. On elevation, in the lower stage, are the  modern Norman windows, with shafts in jambs, over which occur two tiers  of arcading, in the higher of which window openings are pierced. The  position of the Norman Lady Chapel is shown by dotted lines, as well as  the rectangular shape of the Early English chapel built by Walter de  Suffield (1245-57) about 1250. The line of the roof of the later chapel  can still be seen plainly traced on the stonework over the arches which  once gave entrance to it. This later chapel was destroyed by Dean  Gardiner in Queen Elizabeth's reign. The foundations of both chapels  have been laid open quite recently but a few feet under the level of the  garden.    [Illustration: Exterior of the Chapel of St. Luke from the East.]    #The Jesus Chapel#, marked D on plan, on the north side of the apse,  retains the early \"Perpendicular\" windows inserted in the Norman work;  its other characteristics are as those described to St. Luke's Chapel in  the south.    On the north side of the presbytery, and to the west of the Jesus  Chapel, were other chapels, shown on the plan by dotted lines; the  positions of their roofs are clearly marked yet on the stonework. One  must have been the #Reliquary Chapel#; the bridge chapel in the north  aisle of presbytery formed its ante-chapel.    #The North Transept#, and generally the north side of the cathedral, are  more conveniently examined from the gardens of the bishop's palace,  whence this portion of the exterior of the cathedral can best be seen.    The details of the fabric on the north side are essentially the same as  those described to the south side of cathedral; though here the work has  been less restored, and consequently is of more interest to the student.  The original Norman chapel, now used as a store-house, projects eastward  from the north transept; a corresponding feature occurred in the south  transept, but has long since vanished.    #The Bishop's Palace# stands to the north of the cathedral, and was  formerly connected with it by a vaulted passage, Herbert, the founder,  built the first palace, of which portions are incorporated in the  present building. Bishop Salmon (1299-1325) in 1318, according to the  patent rolls of the twelfth year of the reign of Edward II., obtained  licence to buy a piece of land 47 perches 4 feet in length, and 23  perches 12 feet in breadth, to enlarge and rebuild thereon the palace of  Herbert. He also built a chapel, and the great hall, measuring 120 feet  from north to south, and 60 feet wide, with kitchen, buttery, and  offices at the west end. The grand ruin somewhat to the east of the  palace now is supposed to have formed part of the entrance to this hall.  It was, however, too large to keep up, and so was leased by Bishop  Nykke, just before his death in 1535 to the mayor, sheriff, and  citizens, so that the Guild of S. George might hold their annual feast  there. Later on it became a meeting-house. The present private chapel of  the bishop was built by Bishop Reynolds in 1662 across part of the south  end.    To the north of the nave of the cathedral, and on the west side of the  palace, was an open area called the _green-yard,_ and in Sir Thomas  Browne's \"Works,\" vol. iv. p. 27 (London, 1835) is an account of the  _combination sermons_ which were preached here in the summer prior to  the Reformation.    \"Before the late times the combination sermons were preached, in the  summer time, at the Cross in the Green Yard where there was a good  accommodation for the auditors. The mayor, aldermen, with their wives  and officers, had a well-contrived place built against the wall of the  Bishop's palace, covered with lead, so that they were not offended by  rain. Upon the north side of the church, places were built gallery wise,  one above another, where the dean, prebends and their wives, gentlemen,  and the better sort, very well heard the sermon: the rest either stood  or sat in the green, upon long forms provided for them, paying a penny  or half-penny a-piece, as they did at S. Paul's Cross in London. The  Bishop and chancellor heard the sermons at the windows of the Bishop's  palace: the pulpit had a large covering of lead over it, and a cross  upon it; and there were eight or ten stairs of stone about it, upon  which the hospital boys and others stood. The preacher had his face to  the south, and there was a painted board of a foot and a half broad and  about a yard and a half long hanging over his head, before, upon which  were painted the names of the benefactors towards the Combination Sermon  which he particularly commemorated in his prayer....\"    On the north side of the cathedral, in the seventh compartment of the  aisle from the west end, the walled-up entrance to the _green-yard_ is  to be noticed.    There is no doubt that this space was originally the cemetery of the  monks, and Harrod quotes from the _Chronicle_ of John de Whethamsted to  that effect. A stone coffin lid found here in 1848 goes to confirm this.          CHAPTER III    THE INTERIOR      Norwich Cathedral is justly celebrated for the beauty of its interior.  Entering from the upper close by the north aisle door, and then taking a  position immediately under the great west window, facing east, there is  before one the long perspective of the Norman nave, the choir and  presbytery, while overhead comes the later vault, telling richly by  contrast with the severe plainness of the earlier work below. The  extreme length of the cathedral is about 407 feet. The nave, always long  in Norman churches, is here over 200 feet from the west door to the  choir screen. Although some critics object to the position of the organ  on this same screen, there can be no doubt that, not only is it a most  admirable position for the instrument acoustically, but also that its  presence here does not detract from the general effect of the interior.  From the west end of the nave, as a dark silhouette against the eastern  apsidal windows, or as an object in the middle distance, it helps the  spectator to realise the length of the cathedral. A certain sense of  mystery and something undiscerned adds to the charm of an interior, and  the organ here helps, with the screen, to enshrine the eastern arm and  most sacred portion of the building, and interrupts the vista for the  sake of which disastrous sacrifices have been made in many of our  cathedral churches.    #The Nave# consists of seven double bays; in all, fourteen compartments  from the west end to the tower crossing.    It will be noticed that, in the plan (page 113), a square of the nave,  occupying longitudinally the space of two bays of the aisles, is  indicated by the dotted lines; also a main pier is marked as Y and a  subsidiary pier as z.    The main piers, as at Y, are large rectangular masses, having on the  nave side a flat buttress-like piece added, with shafts in the angles,  and bearing on the face the two vaulting shafts. On the aisle side are  two shafts to each transverse arch; and on the two lateral faces are  triple shafts to the arcade arches, with four angle shafts at each  corner of the main pier, taking the outer rings to same. The plan is the  same at the triforium level. The smaller or subsidiary piers (as at X)  have single vaulting shafts on the nave face, double ones to the aisle,  and under the arcade arches convex faces, with four angle shafts, as in  main piers. The plan of these piers determines the elevation. The nave  arcade arches, ornamented with the billet, and triforium with a  _chevron_ or zig-zag, are almost equal in size, and over these lower  stages comes the typical triple Norman clerestory with walk; the whole  covered in by the fine lierne vault.    [Illustration: A Norman Capital.]    The vault has thirteen complete bays and two semi-bays, one at either  end. The junctions between this later vault and the Norman work can be  seen. The main piers had the original double shafts cut off at the level  of the top of the triforium arches, the later single shaft being brought  down and joined by a peculiar branch-like connection. The original  shafts to the subsidiary piers, which it is probable took only a minor  part in carrying the flat Norman wooden roof, were finished by a cap at  the impost level of the triforium, and the later shaft was brought down  and finished by the _rebus_ of Bishop Lyhart, the constructor of the  vault. This _rebus_ should be noticed; it is a pun in stone, with its  hart lying in water. It will also be noticed that the outer arches of  the triforium are not concentric with the sub-arches.
