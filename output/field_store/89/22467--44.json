Similarly, he finds that the Book of Esther has been pronounced by  scholars as a clumsy forgery of the second century, and that the story  of the slaying of Goliath by David is not consistent with the  unlegendary tradition that the slayer of Goliath was Elhanan, and the  period of this adventure not in Saul's but in David's reign. The Book of  Psalms, although attributed to King David, was not written by King  David; and the Book of Proverbs, although attributed to Solomon, was not  written by King Solomon.    The Book of Genesis relates the mythical traditions of the Hebrews from  the creation of the world to the death of Joseph. \"A French physician of  the eighteenth century, Astruc, was the first scholar to point out that  the two principal designations of God in Genesis, Elohim and Jahveh, are  not used arbitrarily. If we place side by side the passages in which God  is called Elohim, and those in which he is called by the other name, we  get two perfectly distinct narratives, which the author of the  Pentateuch, as we possess it, has juxtaposed rather than fused. This one  discovery suffices to discredit the attribution of these books to  Moses, who could not have been an unintelligent compiler, and also  discredits the theory of the divine inspiration of the Bible text. A  comparison of the two narratives shows that all which relates to the  creation of Eve, the Garden of Eden, and Adam's transgression, exists  only in the Jehovist text. Thus it is evident that two versions of the  Creation are given in Genesis. But there are traces in the Old Testament  of a third legend, akin to that of the Babylonians, in which Marduk  creates the world by virtue of a victory over the waters of chaos  (Tiamat). This conception of a conflict between the creator and hostile  forces was contrary to the monotheistic thesis, and has disappeared from  our two versions of Genesis; but the suppression sufficiently proves  that it was very ancient and had long been accepted.\"    The Martian finds that theologians have attempted to crawl out of  desperate situations in their interpretation of the Old Testament by a  method of reading into a passage or extracting out of it ideas  altogether foreign to its original intent. This method they call  \"Allegory.\" By means of this process they have been able to extract any  meaning which suits their purposes, and by this method of juggling could  prove anything. A classic example is that licentious piece of literature  called the \"Song of Solomon,\" in which it is claimed that a woman's  breasts, thighs, and belly are the symbols of the union of Jahveh and  the Synagogue.    Continuing his researches, the Martian notices a number of passages in  the Old Testament that lead him to the conclusion that the Hebrews were  originally polytheists. The name Elohim, he finds, is plural (singular,  Eloah), meaning the gods. Again, in another passage of Genesis, God is  described as saying, \"Let us make man in our image (I, 26),\" and further  on, \"The man is become as one of us.\" It becomes evident to him that  the Hebrews, like their neighbors, worshiped \"baalim\" or the gods of the  heathens. The \"teraphim,\" the etymology of which is unknown, were little  portable idols which seem to have been the Lares of the ancient Hebrews.  David owned some (I Samuel XIX, 13-16), and the prophet Hosea, in the  eighth century before Christ, seems still to have considered the  \"teraphim\" as indispensable in worship (Hos. III, 4). These evidences of  polytheism and fetichism in the people of Israel destroy, in the mind of  the Martian, the claim of these people to have been faithful from their  earliest origin to a spiritual monotheism. Rather does he find that they  took the religions of other peoples with whom they came in contact.    The Old Testament contains numerous instances of the practice of magic.  Moses and Aaron were magicians who rivalled Pharaoh's magicians (Ex.  VII, 11-20); and Balaam was a magician who pronounced incantations  against Israel and afterwards passed over to the service of Jehovah.  Jacob resorted to a kind of sympathetic magic to procure the birth of a  speckled sheep (Gen. XXX, 39). \"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live,\"  is written in Exodus XXII, 18, and this phrase offered an affirmation of  the reality of witchcraft during the period of the Witchcraft Delusion.  The Martian notes that the sentence, \"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to  live,\" has caused more suffering, torture, and death than probably any  other sentence ever framed. His mind revolts at the stupidity and the  slavish adherence to so-called authority of the human mind, which is  manifested in this example of what occurred in the period of the  Witchcraft Delusion, when the words of an ignorant and barbaric Hebrew  were taken by Christian followers to be the words of a god. And yet our  Martian guest recognizes that in this day all men are aware of the  fallacy of this utterance in a book which is still claimed to be  infallible.    The Martian then considers the many ancient Hebrew rites and religious  taboos that have come down through the ages, and are still practiced in  a modified form by the modern Hebrew. Thus, in the Old Testament, there  are numerous instances recorded of the practices of slaughtering of  innocent animals who were offered as peace offerings to Yahveh. As time  passed, the practice of slaughtering and then burning the sacrificial  animal gave way to the practice of only giving the blood of the animal  as an offering. This custom has come down to the present day in the  modern worship of Jehovah; the blood of animals is still forbidden to  the modern Hebrew. Therefore, the orthodox Jew has the neck of the  chicken slit by a \"Shochet\" who allows the blood to drip to the  ground--a modern blood offering to the Gods. The explanations given by  the rabbis of our day are spurious. Similarly, the orthodox Jew of our  time still persists in salting the meat before cooking, a process which  is intended to remove the blood, which is the portion of the Gods.    The reason that the pious Jew abstains from pork leads to the  consideration of Totemism as found in the Old Testament. Totemism is a  kind of worship rendered to animals and vegetables considered as allied  and related to man. The worship of animals and plants is found as a  survival in all ancient societies and is the origin of the belief in the  transmigration of souls. Totemism seems to have been as widespread as  the animism from which it is derived, and has been closely intertwined  in the development of religious beliefs. Totemism in a modified form is  found in the Old Testament where animals speak on occasion, as the  serpent in Genesis, or Balaam's ass. In the most remote periods it is  probable that every clan had at least one totem animal which might no  more be killed or eaten than the human individuals of the clan. The  totem was protected by taboo. The totem was sacred and in this capacity  it was looked upon as a source of strength and holiness, and to live  beside it and under its protection was considered as a righteous custom.  In certain communities the idea that it was necessary to abstain from  eating certain totems survived the progress of material civilization.  The cow is taboo to the Hindus, the pig is taboo to the Mohammedans and  to the Jews. The pious Jew abstains from pork because his remote  ancestors, five or six thousand years before our era, had the wild boar  as their totem. This is the origin of this alimentary taboo; among the  ancient Hebrews it arose, and only comparatively recently has it been  suggested that the flesh of these taboo animals was unwholesome. In the  eighteenth century, philosophers propagated the erroneous notion that if  certain religious legislators had forbidden various aliments, it was for  hygienic motives. Even Renan believed that dread of trichinosis and  leprosy had caused the Hebrews to forbid the use of pork. To show the  irrational nature of this explanation, it will be enough to point out  that in the whole of the Bible there is not a single instance of an  epidemic or a malady attributed to the eating of unclean meats; the idea  of hygiene awoke very late in the Greek world. To the Biblical writers,  as to contemporary savages, illness is supernatural; it is an effect of  the wrath of spirits.    Primitive man ascribed all diseases either to the wrath of God, or the  malice of an evil being. The curing of disease by the casting out of  devils and by prayers were the means of relief from sickness recognized  and commanded by the Old Testament. The hygienic explanation of an  alimentary prohibition as still insisted upon by the rabbis is entirely  erroneous and marks the expounder of such an explanation as one who is  entirely ignorant of the evolution of religious beliefs. The entire  matter is well stated in one sentence by Reinach, \"Nothing can be more  absurd, generally speaking, than to explain the religious laws and  practices of the remote past by considerations based on modern science.\"    The Martian is able to trace some curious customs that were exhibited by  the ancient Hebrews as well as most other ancient peoples, and which  have persisted to this day. The customs remain the same, the meanings  have become lost in the blind adherence to custom. It is known that the  old Jewish mourning customs originated with the desire for protection  from the liberated spirit of the deceased. The loud cries uttered by the  mourners were thought to frighten away the spirits. The change of dress,  the covering of the head with ashes, and the shaving of the hair of the  mourners were done with the purpose of making themselves unrecognizable  to the spirits. Hence, the custom still prevails of wearing the mourning  veil.

Obviously self-administered. Oh, I don't deny  the habit! But my point is this: the injection in the shoulder was NOT  self-administered.\"    \"Come, Helen,\" said Cumberly, taking his daughter's arm; for she had  drawn near, during the colloquy--\"you must get to bed.\"    His face was very stern when he turned again to Mr. Hilton.    \"I shall return in a few minutes,\" he said, and escorted his daughter  from the room.          VI    AT SCOTLAND YARD      Matters of vital importance to some people whom already we have met, and  to others whom thus far we have not met, were transacted in a lofty and  rather bleak looking room at Scotland Yard between the hours of nine and  ten A. M.; that is, later in the morning of the fateful day whose advent  we have heard acclaimed from the Tower of Westminster.    The room, which was lighted by a large French window opening upon a  balcony, commanded an excellent view of the Thames Embankment. The floor  was polished to a degree of brightness, almost painful. The distempered  walls, save for a severe and solitary etching of a former Commissioner,  were nude in all their unloveliness. A heavy deal table (upon which  rested a blotting-pad, a pewter ink-pot, several newspapers and two  pens) together with three deal chairs, built rather as monuments of  durability than as examples of art, constituted the only furniture, if  we except an electric lamp with a green glass shade, above the table.    This was the room of Detective-Inspector Dunbar; and Detective-Inspector  Dunbar, at the hour of our entrance, will be found seated in the chair,  placed behind the table, his elbows resting upon the blotting-pad.    At ten minutes past nine, exactly, the door opened, and a thick-set,  florid man, buttoned up in a fawn colored raincoat and wearing a bowler  hat of obsolete build, entered. He possessed a black mustache, a breezy,  bustling manner, and humorous blue eyes; furthermore, when he took  off his hat, he revealed the possession of a head of very bristly,  upstanding, black hair. This was Detective-Sergeant Sowerby, and the  same who was engaged in examining a newspaper in the study of Henry  Leroux when Dr. Cumberly and his daughter had paid their second visit to  that scene of an unhappy soul's dismissal.    \"Well?\" said Dunbar, glancing up at his subordinate, inquiringly.    \"I have done all the cab depots,\" reported Sergeant Sowerby, \"and a good  many of the private owners; but so far the man seen by Mr. Exel has not  turned up.\"    \"The word will be passed round now, though,\" said Dunbar, \"and we shall  probably have him here during the day.\"    \"I hope so,\" said the other good-humoredly, seating himself upon one of  the two chairs ranged beside the wall. \"If he doesn't show up.\"...    \"Well?\" jerked Dunbar--\"if he doesn't?\"    \"It will look very black against Leroux.\"    Dunbar drummed upon the blotting-pad with the fingers of his left hand.    \"It beats anything of the kind that has ever come my way,\" he confessed.  \"You get pretty cautious at weighing people up, in this business; but I  certainly don't think--mind you, I go no further--but I certainly  don't think Mr. Henry Leroux would willingly kill a fly; yet there is  circumstantial evidence enough to hang him.\"    Sergeant Sowerby nodded, gazing speculatively at the floor.    \"I wonder,\" he said, slowly, \"why the girl--Miss Cumberly--hesitated  about telling us the woman's name?\"    \"I am not wondering about that at all,\" replied Dunbar, bluntly. \"She  must meet thousands in the same way. The wonder to me is that she  remembered at all. I am open to bet half-a-crown that YOU couldn't  remember the name of every woman you happened to have pointed out to you  at an Arts Ball?\"    \"Maybe not,\" agreed Sowerby; \"she's a smart girl, I'll allow. I see you  have last night's papers there?\"    \"I have,\" replied Dunbar; \"and I'm wondering\"...    \"If there's any connection?\"    \"Well,\" continued the inspector, \"it looks on the face of it as though  the news of her husband's death had something to do with Mrs. Vernon's  presence at Leroux's flat. It's not a natural thing for a woman, on the  evening of her husband's death, to rush straight away to another man's  place\"...    \"It's strange we couldn't find her clothes\"...    \"It's not strange at all! You're simply obsessed with the idea that this  was a love intrigue! Think, man! the most abandoned woman wouldn't run  to keep an appointment with a lover at a time like that! And remember  she had the news in her pocket! She came to that flat dressed--or  undressed--just as we found her; I'm sure of it. And a point like that  sometimes means the difference between hanging and acquittal.\"    Sergeant Sowerby digested these words, composing his jovial countenance  in an expression of unnatural profundity. Then:--    \"THE point to my mind,\" he said, \"is the one raised by Mr. Hilton. By  gum! didn't Dr. Cumberly tell him off!\"    \"Dr. Cumberly,\" replied Dunbar, \"is entitled to his opinion, that the  injection in the woman's shoulder was at least eight hours old; whilst  Mr. Hilton is equally entitled to maintain that it was less than ONE  hour old. Neither of them can hope to prove his case.\"    \"If either of them could?\"...    \"It might make a difference to the evidence--but I'm not sure.\"    \"What time is your appointment?\"    \"Ten o'clock,\" replied Dunbar. \"I am meeting Mr. Debnam--the late Mr.  Vernon's solicitor. There is something in it. Damme! I am sure of it!\"    \"Something in what?\"    \"The fact that Mr. Vernon died yesterday evening, and that his wife was  murdered at midnight.\"    \"What have you told the press?\"    \"As little as possible, but you will see that the early editions will  all be screaming for the arrest of Soames.\"    \"I shouldn't wonder. He would be a useful man to have; but he's probably  out of London now.\"    \"I think not. He's more likely to wait for instructions from his  principal.\"    \"His principal?\"    \"Certainly. You don't think Soames did the murder, do you?\"    \"No; but he's obviously an accessory.\"    \"I'm not so sure even of that.\"    \"Then why did he bolt?\"    \"Because he had a guilty conscience.\"    \"Yes,\" agreed Sowerby; \"it does turn out that way sometimes. At any  rate, Stringer is after him, but he's got next to nothing to go upon.  Has any reply been received from Mrs. Leroux in Paris?\"    \"No,\" answered Dunbar, frowning thoughtfully. \"Her husband's wire would  reach her first thing this morning; I am expecting to hear of a reply at  any moment.\"    \"They're a funny couple, altogether,\" said Sowerby. \"I can't imagine  myself standing for Mrs. Sowerby spending her week-ends in Paris. Asking  for trouble, I call it!\"    \"It does seem a daft arrangement,\" agreed Dunbar; \"but then, as you say,  they're a funny couple.\"    \"I never saw such a bundle of nerves in all my life!\"...    \"Leroux?\"    Sowerby nodded.    \"I suppose,\" he said, \"it's the artistic temperament! If Mrs. Leroux  has got it, too, I don't wonder that they get fed up with one another's  company.\"    \"That's about the secret of it. And now, I shall be glad, Sowerby, if  you will be after that taxi-man again. Report at one o'clock. I shall be  here.\"    With his hand on the door-knob: \"By the way,\" said Sowerby, \"who the  blazes is Mr. King?\"    Inspector Dunbar looked up.    \"Mr. King,\" he replied slowly, \"is the solution of the mystery.\"          VII    THE MAN IN THE LIMOUSINE      The house of the late Horace Vernon was a modern villa of prosperous  appearance; but, on this sunny September morning, a palpable atmosphere  of gloom seemed to overlie it. This made itself perceptible even to the  toughened and unimpressionable nerves of Inspector Dunbar. As he mounted  the five steps leading up to the door, glancing meanwhile at the lowered  blinds at the windows, he wondered if, failing these evidences and his  own private knowledge of the facts, he should have recognized that the  hand of tragedy had placed its mark upon this house. But when the door  was opened by a white-faced servant, he told himself that he should, for  a veritable miasma of death seemed to come out to meet him, to envelop  him.    Within, proceeded a subdued activity: somber figures moved upon the  staircase; and Inspector Dunbar, having presented his card, presently  found himself in a well-appointed library.    At the table, whereon were spread a number of documents, sat a lean,  clean-shaven, sallow-faced man, wearing gold-rimmed pince-nez; a man  whose demeanor of business-like gloom was most admirably adapted to that  place and occasion. This was Mr. Debnam, the solicitor. He gravely  waved the detective to an armchair, adjusted his pince-nez, and coughed,  introductorily.    \"Your communication, Inspector,\" he began (he had the kind of voice  which seems to be buried in sawdust packing), \"was brought to me this  morning, and has disturbed me immeasurably, unspeakably.\"    \"You have been to view the body, sir?\"    \"One of my clerks, who knew Mrs. Vernon, has just returned to this house  to report that he has identified her.\"    \"I should have preferred you to have gone yourself, sir,\" began Dunbar,  taking out his notebook.    \"My state of health, Inspector,\" said the solicitor, \"renders it  undesirable that I should submit myself to an ordeal so unnecessary--so  wholly unnecessary.\"    \"Very good!\" muttered Dunbar, making an entry in his book; \"your clerk,  then, whom I can see in a moment, identifies the murdered woman as Mrs.  Vernon. What was her Christian name?\"    \"Iris--Iris Mary Vernon.\"    Inspector Dunbar made a note of the fact.    \"And now,\" he said, \"you will have read the"]]]
