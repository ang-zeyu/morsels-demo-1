[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18767"],[0,"Stories about Animals: with Pictures to Match (#7)"],[1,"reason for this foolish  fear--for it was foolish, of course--was, that a servant girl, in the  employ of my mother, used to tell me scores of stories in which wolves  always played a very prominent part. I remember one story in particular,  which cost me a world of terror. The principal scene in the tale, and  the one which most frightened me, was at the time pictured so strongly  on my imagination, that it never entirely wore off. It was much after  this fashion. The wolf's jaws were opened wide enough to take a poor  fellow's head in, and fancy pictured that event as being about to happen  scores of times. Indeed, the nurse told me, over and over again, that  unless I kept out of mischief--which I did not always, I am sorry to  say--I should be sure to come to some such end. Boys and girls, if you  have ever heard such stories, don't let them trouble you for a moment.  There is not a word of truth in them. I know how you feel--some of you  who are quite young, and who have been entertained with stories of this  class--when any body asks you to go alone into a dark room. You are  afraid of something, and for your life cannot tell what. I should not  wonder very much if some of you were _afraid of the dark_. I have heard  children talk about being afraid of the dark. You laugh, perhaps. It is  rather funny--almost too funny to be treated seriously. Well, if it is  not the dark, what is it you are afraid of? Your parents, and others who  are older than you, are alone in the dark a thousand times in the course  of a year. Did you ever hear them say any thing about meeting a single  one of the heroes of the frightful stories you have heard? Do you think  they ever came across a ghost, or an apparition, or a fairy, or an elf,  or a witch, or a hobgoblin, or a giant, or a Blue-Beard, or a wolf? It  makes you smile to think of it. Well, then, after all, don't you think  it would be a great deal wiser and better to turn all these foolish  fancies out of your head, just as one would get rid of a company of  saucy rats and mice that were doing mischief in the cellar or  corn-house? I think so.    Before I have done with the wolf, I must recite that fable of AEsop's,  about one who dressed himself up in the garb of a sheep, to impose upon  the shepherd, but who shared a very different fate from the one he  anticipated.    [Illustration: THE WOLF IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING.]    A wolf, clothing himself in the skin of a sheep, and getting in among  the flock, by this means took the opportunity to devour many of them. At  last the shepherd discovered him, and cunningly fastening a rope about  his neck, tied him up to a tree which stood hard by. Some other  shepherds happening to pass that way, and observing what he was about,  drew near and expressed their amazement. \"What,\" says one of them,  \"brother, do you make a practice of hanging sheep?\" \"No,\" replies the  other; \"but I make a practice of hanging a wolf whenever I catch him,  though in the habit and garb of a sheep.\" Then he showed them their  mistake, and they applauded the justice of the execution. The moral of  this fable is so plain, that it is quite useless to repeat it.          The Horse.      Of all the animals which have been pressed into the service of man, the  horse, perhaps, is the most useful. What could we do without the labor  of this noble and faithful animal? Day after day, and year after year,  he toils on for his master, seldom complaining, when he is well treated,  seldom showing himself ungrateful to his friends, and sometimes  exhibiting the strongest attachment.    The following story is a matter of history, and is told by one who was a  witness of most of the facts connected with it: During the peninsular  war in Europe, the trumpeter of a French cavalry corps had a fine  charger assigned to him, of which he became passionately fond, and  which, by gentleness of disposition and uniform docility, equally  evinced its affection. The sound of the trumpeter's voice, the sight of  his uniform, or the twang of his trumpet, was sufficient to throw  this animal into a state of the greatest excitement; and he appeared  to be pleased and happy only when under the saddle of his rider. Indeed  he was unruly and useless to every body else; for once, on being removed  to another part of the forces, and consigned to a young officer, he  resolutely refused to perform his evolutions, and bolted straight to the  trumpeter's station, and there took his stand, jostling alongside his  former master. This animal, on being restored to the trumpeter, carried  him, during several of the peninsular campaigns, through many  difficulties and hair-breadth escapes. At last the corps to which he  belonged was worsted, and in the confusion of retreat the trumpeter was  mortally wounded. Dropping from his horse, his body was found, many days  after the engagement, stretched on the ground, with the faithful old  charger standing beside it. During the long interval, it seems that he  had never left the trumpeter's side, but had stood sentinel over his  corpse, as represented in the engraving, scaring away the birds of prey,  and remaining totally heedless of his own privations. When found, he was  in a sadly reduced condition, partly from loss of blood through wounds,  but chiefly from want of food, of which, in the excess of his grief, he  could not be prevailed on to partake.    [Illustration: THE HORSE WATCHING THE BODY OF THE TRUMPETER.]    In a book called \"Sketches of the Horse,\" is an anecdote which exhibits  the intelligence of this animal in perhaps a still stronger light. A  farmer, living in the neighborhood of Bedford, in England, was returning  home from market one evening in 1828, and being somewhat tipsy, rolled  off his saddle into the middle of the road. His horse stood still; but  after remaining patiently for some time, and not observing any  disposition in his rider to get up and proceed further, he took him by  the collar and shook him. This had little or no effect, for the farmer  only gave a grumble of dissatisfaction at having his repose disturbed.  The animal was not to be put off by any such evasion, and so applied his  mouth to one of his master's coat-laps, and after several attempts, by  dragging at it, to raise him upon his feet, the coat-lap gave way. Three  individuals who witnessed this extraordinary proceeding then went up,  and assisted the man in mounting his horse.    My father had a horse, when I was a little boy, that was quite a pet  with the whole family. We called him Jack, and he knew his name as well  as I did. The biography of the old veteran would be very interesting, I  am sure, if any body were to write it. I do not mean to be his  biographer, however, though my partiality for him will be a sufficient  apology for a slight sketch.    Old Jack was a very intelligent horse. He would always come when he  heard his name called, let him be ever so far distant in the pasture;  that is, if he had a mind to come. Of course, being a gentleman of  discernment, he sometimes chose to stay where he was, and enjoy his  walk. This was especially the case when the grass was very green, and  when the person who came for him chanced to be a little green also. Jack  had his faults, it cannot be denied, and among them, perhaps the most  prominent one was a strong aversion to being caught by any body but my  father, whom he seemed to regard as having the sole right to summon him  from the pasture. I used occasionally to try my hand at catching him. In  fact, I succeeded several times, by stratagem only. I carried a measure  containing a few gills of oats with me into the field; and his love for  oats was so much stronger than his dislike of the catching process, that  I secured him. But after a while the old fellow became too cunning for  me. He came to the conclusion that the quantity of his favorite dish was  too small to warrant him in sacrificing his freedom. He had some  knowledge of arithmetic, you see. Certainly he must have cyphered as  far as loss and gain. One day I went into the pasture with my bridle  concealed behind me, and just about enough oats to cover the bottom of  my measure, and advanced carefully toward the spot where old Jack was  quietly grazing in the meadow. He did not stir as I approached. He held  up his head a little, and seemed to be thinking what it was best to do.  I drew nearer, encouraged, of course. The cunning fellow let me come  within a few feet of him, and then suddenly wheeled around, threw his  heels into the air, a great deal too near my head, and then started off  at full gallop, snorting his delight at the fun, and seeming to say, \"I  am not quite so great a fool as you suppose.\"    Still, old Jack was kind and gentle. My father never had any trouble  with him, and many a long mile have I rode after him, when he went over  the ground like a bird. I loved him, with all his faults; I loved him  dearly, and when he was sold, we all had a long crying spell about it. I  remember the time well, when the man who purchased our old pet came to  take him away. I presume the man was kind enough, but really I never  could forgive him for buying the horse. He was rather a rough-looking  man, and he laughed a good deal when we told him he must be good to  Jack, and give him plenty of oats, and not make him work too hard. I  went out, with my sister, to bid our old friend a last sad good-bye. We  carried him some green grass--we knew how well he loved grass, he had  given us proof enough of that--and while he was eating it, and the man  was preparing to take him away, we talked to old Jack till the tears  stood in our eyes; we told him how sorry we were to part with him; and  he seemed to be sad, too, for he stopped eating his grass, and looked at  us tenderly, while we put our arms around his neck and caressed him for  the last time.

From these the blood  runs with too great force for the clot to form within the wound.    *Time Required for Coagulation.*--The rate at which coagulation takes place  varies greatly under different conditions. It is influenced strongly by  temperature; heat hastens and cold retards the process. It may be  prevented entirely by lowering the temperature of the blood to near the  freezing point. The presence of a foreign substance increases the rapidity  of coagulation, and it has been observed that bleeding from small wounds  is more quickly checked by covering them with linen or cotton fibers. The  fibers in this case hasten the process of coagulation.    *Quantity of Blood.*--The quantity of blood is estimated to be about one  thirteenth of the entire weight of the body. This for the average  individual is an amount weighing nearly twelve pounds and having a volume  of nearly one and one half gallons. About 46 per cent by volume of this  amount is made up of corpuscles and 54 per cent of plasma. Of the plasma  about 10 per cent consists of solids and 90 per cent of water, as already  stated.    *Functions of the Blood.*--The blood is the great carrying, or  distributing, agent in the body. Through its movements (considered in the  next chapter) it carries food and oxygen to the cells and waste materials  from the cells. Much of the blood may, therefore, be regarded as _freight_  in the process of transportation. The blood also carries, or distributes,  heat. Taking up heat in the warm parts of the body, it gives it off at  places having a lower temperature. This enables all parts of the body to  keep at about the same temperature.    In addition to serving as a carrier, the blood has antiseptic properties,  i.e., it destroys disease germs. While  this function is mainly due to the  white corpuscles, it is due in part to the plasma.(13) Through its  coagulation, the blood also closes leaks in the small blood vessels. The  blood is thus seen to be a liquid of several functions.                                    [Fig. 12]      Fig. 12--*A balanced change* in water. The level remains constant although  the water is continually changing; suggestive of the changes in the blood.      *Changes in the Blood.*--In performing its functions in the body the blood  must of necessity undergo rapid and continuous change. The red corpuscles,  whose changes have already been noted, appear to be the most enduring  constituents of the blood. The plasma is the portion that changes most  rapidly. Yet in spite of these changes the quantity and character of the  blood remain practically constant.(14) This is because there is a  _balancing_ of the forces that bring about the changes. The addition of  various materials to the blood just equals the withdrawal of the same  materials from the blood. Somewhat as a vessel of water (Fig. 12) having  an inflow and an outflow which are equal in amount may keep always at the  same level, the balancing of the intake and outgo of the blood keeps its  composition about the same from time to time.    *Hygiene of the Blood.*--The blood, being a changeable liquid, is easily  affected through our habits of living. Since it may be affected for ill as  well as for good, one should cultivate those habits that are beneficial  and avoid those that are harmful in their effects. Most of the hygiene of  the blood, however, is properly included in the hygiene of the organs that  act upon the blood--a fact which makes it unnecessary to treat this subject  fully at this time.    From a health standpoint, the most important constituents of the blood  are, perhaps, the corpuscles. These are usually sufficient in number and  vigor in the blood of those who take plenty of physical exercise, accustom  themselves to outdoor air and sunlight, sleep sufficiently, and avoid the  use of injurious drugs. On the other hand, they are deficient in quantity  and inferior in quality in the bodies of those who pursue an opposite  course. Impurities not infrequently find their way into the blood through  the digestive organs. One should eat wholesome, well-cooked food, drink  freely of _pure_ water, and limit the quantity of food _to what can be  properly digested_. The natural purifiers of the blood are the organs of  excretion. The skin is one of these and its power to throw off impurities  depends upon its being clean and active.    *Effect of Drugs.*--Certain drugs and medicines, including alcohol and  quinine,(15) have recently been shown to destroy the white corpuscles. The  effect of such substances, if introduced in considerable amount in the  body, is to render one less able to withstand attacks of disease. Many  patent medicines are widely advertised for purifying the blood. While  these may possibly do good in particular cases, the habit of doctoring  one's self with them is open to serious objection. Instead of taking drugs  and patent medicines for purifying the blood, one should study to live  more hygienically. We may safely rely upon wholesome food, pure water,  outdoor exercise and sunlight, plenty of sleep, and a clean skin for  keeping the blood in good condition. If these natural remedies fail, a  physician should be consulted.    *Summary.*--The blood is the carrying or transporting agent of the body. It  consists in part of constituents, such as the red corpuscles, that enable  it to carry different substances; and in part of the materials that are  being carried. The latter, which include food and oxygen for the cells and  wastes from the cells, may be classed as freight. Certain constituents in  the blood destroy disease germs, and other constituents, by coagulating,  close small leaks in the blood vessels. Although subject to rapid and  continuous change, the blood is able--by reason of the balancing of  materials added to and withdrawn from it--to remain about the same in  quantity and composition.    Exercises.--1. Compare blood and water with reference to weight, density,  color, odor, and complexity of composition.    2. Show by an outline the different constituents of the blood.    3. Compare the red and white corpuscles with reference to size, shape,  number, origin, and function.    4. Name some use or purpose for each constituent of the blood.    5. What constituents of the blood may be regarded as freight and what as  agents for carrying this freight?    6. After coagulation, what portions of the blood are found in the clot?  What portions are found in the serum?    7. What purposes are served by water in the blood?    8. Show how the blood, though constantly changing, is kept about the same  in quantity, density, and composition.    9. In the lungs the blood changes from a dark to a bright red color and in  the tissues it changes back to dark red. What is the cause of these  changes?    10. If the oxygen and hemoglobin formed a strong instead of a weak  chemical union, could the hemoglobin then act as an oxygen carrier? Why?    11.

PRACTICAL WORK      *To demonstrate the Physical Properties of Blood* (Optional).--Since blood  is needed in considerable quantity in the following experiments, it is  best obtained from the butcher. To be sure of securing the blood in the  manner desired, take to the butcher three good-sized bottles bearing  labels as follows:    *1* Fill two thirds full. While the blood is cooling, stir rapidly with  the hand or a bunch of switches to remove the clot.    *2* Fill two thirds full and set aside without shaking or stirring.    *3* Fill two thirds full and thoroughly mix with the liquid in the bottle.    Label 3 must be pasted on a bottle, having a tight-fitting stopper, which  is filled one fifth full of a saturated solution of Epsom salts. The  purpose of the salts is to prevent coagulation until the blood is diluted  with water as in the experiments which follow.    *Experiments.*--1. Let some of the defibrinated blood (bottle 1) flow (not  fall) on the surface of water in a glass vessel. Does it remain on the  surface or sink to the bottom? What does the experiment show with  reference to the relative weight of blood and water?    2. Fill a large test tube or a small bottle one fourth full of the  defibrinated blood and thin it by adding an equal amount of water. Then  place the hand over the mouth and shake until the blood is thoroughly  mixed with the air. Compare with a portion of the blood not mixed with the  air, noting any difference in color. What substance in the air has acted  on the blood to change its color?    3. Fill three tumblers each two thirds full of water and set them in a  warm place. Pour into one of the tumblers, and thoroughly mix with the  water, two tablespoonfuls of the blood containing the Epsom salts. After  an interval of half an hour add blood to the second tumbler in the same  manner, and after another half hour add blood to the third. The water  dilutes the salts so that coagulation is no longer prevented. Jar the  vessel occasionally as coagulation proceeds; and if the clot is slow in  forming, add a trace of some salt of calcium (calcium chloride). After the  blood has been added to the last tumbler make a comparative study of all.  Note that coagulation begins in all parts of the liquid at the same time  and that, as the process goes on, the clot shrinks and is drawn toward the  center.    4. Place a clot from one of the tumblers in experiment 3 in a large vessel  of water. Thoroughly wash, adding fresh water, until a white, stringy  solid remains. This substance is fibrin.    5. Examine the coagulated blood obtained from the butcher (bottle 2).  Observe the dark central mass (the clot) surrounded by a clear liquid (the  serum). Sketch the vessel and its contents, showing and naming the parts  into which the blood separates by coagulation.    *To "]]]
