[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18013"],[0,"Representation of Deities of the Maya Manuscripts (#7)"],[1,"K we recognize the ornament so common in the temple  ruins of Central America--the so-called \"elephant's trunk.\" The peculiar,  conventionalized face, with the projecting proboscis-shaped nose, which is  applied chiefly to the corners of temple walls, displays unquestionably  the features of god K. The significance of god K in this architectural  relation is unknown. Some connection with his character as the deity of a  star and with his astronomic qualities may, however, be assumed, since, as  we know, the temple structures of Central America are always placed with  reference _to the cardinal points_.      L. The Old, Black God.    [Illustration: Fig. 44]    God L's features are those of an old man with sunken, toothless mouth.  His hieroglyph is Fig. 44, which is characterized by the black face.    God L, who is also black, must not be confounded with M whose description  follows. L is represented and designated by his hieroglyph in the  accompanying text, in Dr. 14b and 14c and Dr. 46b; the figure has the  characteristic black face. He appears entirely black in Dr. 7a. The  hieroglyph alone occurs in Dr. 21b and 24 (third vertical line in the  first passage) with a variation, namely without the Ymix-sign before the  head. This deity does not occur in the Madrid and Paris manuscripts.    The significance of god L does not appear from the few pictures, which  are given of him. In Dr. 46b the god is pictured armed and in warlike  attitude. Both in Dr. 14b and 14c he wears a bird on his head and has a  Kan in his hand.    According to Foerstemann, his day is Akbal, darkness, night.    Cyrus Thomas (Aids to the Study of the Maya Codices, in the 6th Annual  Report of the Bureau of Ethnology, Washington, 1888, p. 358) thinks he is  the god Ekchuah, who has come down to us as a black deity. God M seems,  however, to correspond to Ekchuah (see the description of M).      M. The Black God with the Red Lips.    [Illustration: Figs. 45-48]    God M's hieroglyph is Figs. 45, 46; it seems to represent an eye rimmed  with black, though the figure of the god himself displays an entirely  different drawing of the eye (see Fig. 47).    The god is found in the Dresden manuscript only three times, namely in  Dr. 16b (with a bone in his hand) in picture and sign, in Dr. 13c  grouped with an animal, without the hieroglyph, and in Dr. 43a (with his  sign) while finally his hieroglyph alone appears in Dr. 56 (top, left) in  a group and of a somewhat different form.    On the other hand, god M appears with special frequency in the Madrid  manuscript, which treats of this deity with great fullness of detail.  While he is represented in the Dresden manuscript (16b) with his body  striped black and white, and on p. 43a entirely white, he is always  entirely black in the Codex Troano. His other distinguishing marks are  the following:    1. The mouth encircled by a red-brown border.    2. The large, drooping under lip. By this he can be recognized with  certainty also in Dr. 43a.    3. The two curved lines at the right of the eye.    His significance can be conjectured. He seems to be of a warlike nature,  for he is almost always represented armed with the lance and also as  engaged in combat and, in some instances, pierced by the lance of his  opponent, god F, for example in Tro. 3c, 7a, 29*a. The peculiar object  with parallel stripes, which he wears on his head is a rope from which a  package frequently hangs. By means of a rope placed around his head the  god frequently carries a bale of merchandise, as is the custom today  among the aborigines in different parts of America. On 4b and 5a in the  Cod. Tro. this can plainly be seen. All these pictures lead us to  conclude, that we have here to do with a god of _travelling merchants_. A  deity of this character called Ekchuah has been handed down to us, who is  designated explicitly as a _black_ god. In favor of this is also the  fact, that he is represented fighting with F and pierced by the latter.  For the travelling merchant must, of course, be armed to ward off hostile  attacks and these are admirably symbolized by god F, for he is the god of  death in war and of the killing of the captured enemy. The god is found  in the Codex Troano in the following places and on many pages two or  three times: pp. 2, 3, 4, 5, always with the hieroglyph, then without it  on pp. 6, 7, 19, 4*c, 14*b, 17*a, 18*b and again with the hieroglyph  on pp. 22*a, 23*a, 25*a; finally it is found again without the  hieroglyph on pp. 29*a, 30*a, 31*, 32*, 33*, 34*. In the Codex  Cortesianus god M occurs in the following places: p. 15, where he strikes  the sky with the axe and thus causes rain, p. 19 (bottom), 28 (bottom,  second figure), 34 (bottom) and 36 (top). M is always to be recognized by  the encircled mouth and the drooping under-lip; figures without these  marks are not identical with M, thus for example in Tro. 23, 24, 25, 21*.  Tro. 34*a shows what is apparently a variant of M with the face of an  old man, the scorpion's tail and the vertebrae of the death-god, a figure  which in its turn bears on its breast the plainly recognizable head of M.  God M is also represented elsewhere many times with the scorpion's  tail, thus for example on Tro. 30*a, 31*a.    Besides his hieroglyph mentioned above, Figs. 45 and 46, another sign  seems to refer to god M, namely Fig. 48 (compare for example Tro. 5a and  Cort. 28, bottom). The head in this sign has the same curved lines at the  corner of the eye as appear on the deity himself. Foerstemann mentions  this sign in his Commentary on the Paris Manuscript, p. 15, and in his  Commentary on the Dresden Manuscript, p. 56. He thinks the hieroglyph has  relation to the revolution of Venus, which is performed in 584 days. A  relation of this kind is, I think, very possible, if we bear in mind that  all the god-figures of the manuscripts have more or less of a calendric  and chronologic significance in their chief or in their secondary  function.    It should be mentioned that God M is represented as a rule as an old man  with toothless jaw or the characteristic solitary tooth. That he is also  related to bee-culture is shown by his presence on p. 4*c of the Codex  Troano, in the section on bees.    Besides gods L and M, a few quite isolated black figures occur in the  Codex Troano, who, apparently, are identical with neither of these two  deities, but are evidently of slight importance and perhaps are only  variants of other deities. Similar figures of black deities are found in  the Codex Tro. 23, 24 and 25 (perhaps this is a black variant of B as god  of the storm?) and on 21*c we twice see a black form with the aged face  and the solitary tooth in the under jaw (perhaps only a variant of M). In  the Codex Cortesianus and in the Dresden manuscript no other black  deities occur, but in the Paris manuscript a black deity seems to be  pictured once (p. 21, bottom).    According to Brinton (Nagualism, Philadelphia 1894, pp. 21, 39), there is  among the Tzendals in addition to Ekchuah, a second black deity called  Xicalahua, \"black lord\".      N. The God of the End of the Year.    [Illustration: Figs. 49-51]    We have here a deity with the features of an old man and wearing a  peculiar head ornament reproduced in Fig. 50, which contains the sign for  the year of 360 days. The god's hieroglyph is Fig. 49, which consists of  the numeral 5 with the sign of the month Zac. Foerstemann has recognized  in god N the god of the five Uayeyab days, which were added as  intercalary days at the end of the original year of 360 days, and were  considered unlucky days. N is, therefore, the god of the end of the year.  Foerstemann has discussed him in detail under this title in a monograph  published in Globus, Vol. 80, No. 12. It is still open to question  whether god N actually occurs in all the places of the Dresden  manuscript, which are mentioned by Foerstemann. He can be recognized  positively on Dr. 17a, 21c (grouped with a woman) and 37a; also on  12c, but in this latter place with pronounced deviations from the usual  representations. The figures in Dr. 23c (first group) and 43a (third  picture) are doubtful, especially since the hieroglyph of the god is  lacking in both instances. The third group in Dr. 21c is equally  dubious. Here a woman is pictured sitting opposite a god. The latter  seems to be god N, yet in the text we find instead of his sign the  hieroglyph given in Fig. 51. It is not impossible that this sign likewise  denotes god N.    God N is found a few times in the Paris manuscript, for example on p. 4,  where he holds K's head in his hands, and on p. 22.      O. A Goddess with the Features of an Old Woman.    [Illustration: Fig. 52]    This goddess occurs only in the Madrid manuscript and is distinguished by  the solitary tooth in the under jaw, as a sign of age, the invariable  characteristic of aged persons in the manuscripts. She is pictured in the  following places: Tro. 5*c, 6*b, and 11*b, c and d, Cort. 10b,  11a, 38a. In Tro. 11* she is represented working at a loom. She does  not appear at all in the Dresden and Paris manuscripts. The figures of  women mentioned under I with the serpent on their heads, are especially  not to be regarded as identical with goddess O, for she never wears the  serpent, but a tuft of hair bound high up on her head and running out in  two locks.    Her hieroglyph is Fig. 52; it is distinguished by the wrinkles of age  about the eye. Owing to the limited number of her pictures, there is  little to be said concerning the significance of this goddess.      P. The Frog-God.    [Illustration: Fig. 53]    We call him the frog-god because in the Codex Tro. 31, he is pictured in  the first and second lines with the club-shaped fingers of a frog, which  occur only on this figure. The blue background, which is his attribute  twice in the same passage, likewise points to a connection with water,  and that the god also has"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18019"],[0,"The Luckiest Girl in the School (#7)"],[1,"hey're  getting sore. If I let a blister come, I shan't be able to play at all.\"    \"Then for goodness' sake don't play any more to-day, and soak your  fingers in alum when you get home.\"    The general meeting on Tuesday was a very important event, for it marked  the opening of the winter session of games and guilds. During the first  week or ten days of the autumn term the girls had enough to do in  settling into the work of their new forms, but now October was come  everybody began to think about hockey, and to consider the advisability  of beginning rehearsals for various Christmas performances.    \"I always hate the end of September,\" proclaimed Grace Olliver. \"It's so  fine, and the geraniums are still so fresh in the park, that you're  deceived into thinking it's still summer, yet when you try to play  tennis, you find the courts horrible, and you cut up the grass in half  an hour. I'm glad when the leaves all come off, and you know it's  autumn, and you look up your hockey jersey, and think what sport you had  last winter over 'The Dramatic.' I'm fond enough of cricket, but I'd  really rather have winter than summer. On the whole, there's more going  on.\"    \"I'm glad Margaret Howell's head of the school,\" replied Evelyn  Richards. \"She's A1 at all the guilds, though I don't think she's much  chance of being elected Games Captain.\"    \"All the better. It's quite enough for Margaret to act head. She's good  enough at that, I admit. Makes an ideal president. But a girl who's  literary isn't generally sporty as well. It stands to reason she can't  do both properly.\"    \"Meg doesn't want to be Games Captain; it's not in her line,\"  volunteered Beatrice, Margaret's younger sister. \"She told me to tell  you all to vote for Kirsty Paterson.\"    \"Kirsty's topping!\"    \"What's this Symposium we're to have after the meeting?\" asked Grace.    \"Why, I don't exactly know,\" laughed Evelyn. \"I looked 'symposium' up in  the dictionary, and it said: 'literally a drinking together; a merry  feast; a convivial party.' I don't know what we're going to drink,  unless we bring lemon kali and pass it round, like they used to do the  loving cup in the Middle Ages!\"    \"I suppose it'll be just a kind of concert. But how about the  collection? What are we supposed to give?\"    \"Anything you like, from a penny upwards,\" replied Beatrice. \"Meg  calculated that two hundred and six pennies would be seventeen and  twopence, and some girls will probably give more, so she thinks we're  sure of a sovereign, and that ought to buy a decent trophy, something to  begin upon, at any rate. One must make a start.\"    \"Right you are! A penny won't break the banks of even the First Form  babes, and millionaires can give their half-crowns, if they're so  disposed!\"    Punctually at 3 p.m. on the following Tuesday, the whole school  assembled in the gymnasium. No mistress was present, for on occasions  such as this Miss Bishop believed in self-government. She could trust  her head girl and prefects, and had armed them with full authority.  Winona anticipated the meeting with excitement and curiosity. It was  altogether outside her experience. She had never in her life attended  such a function. Garnet, whose elder sisters had been at large schools,  had sketched an outline of what was likely to take place, but even  Garnet's information was second-hand. Though she had now been exactly a  fortnight at Seaton, Winona still felt more or less of a new-comer. She  had hardly spoken to any one outside her own form, and knew the names of  comparatively few of her two hundred and five schoolfellows. Without  Garnet she would have been quite at a loss how to steer her course in  this great ocean of school life; she thankfully accepted her friend as  pilot, and for the present was content to follow her lead. The two girls  presented themselves in the gymnasium in good time, and took their seats  among the other members of V.a. The front bench was occupied by  a row of ten-year-olds who had come up this term from the Preparatory,  and who sat squeezing each others' arms, highly impressed with the  importance of their remove. Behind them Form II., a giggling crew rather  more _au fait_ with the ways of the school, effervesced occasionally  into excited squeals, and were instantly suppressed by a prefect. The  Third and Fourth, which comprised the bulk of the girls from twelve to  fifteen, occupied the middle of the hall, a lively, self-confident and  rather obstreperous set, all at that awkward age which is anxious to  claim privileges, but not particularly ready to submit to the authorized  code. Every one of them was talking at the extreme pitch of her voice,  and the noise was considerable. Patricia Marshall and Clarice Nixon  looked at each other and frowned ominously, but as the hands of the big  clock pointed almost to three, they judged it better not to interfere,  and the din continued.    At the stroke of the hour, Margaret Howell strode on to the platform.  She was a tall, fine-looking girl of seventeen, with bright hazel eyes,  regular features, and a thick brown plait that fell below her waist. Her  ready powers of speech, clear ringing voice, brisk decisive tone, and a  certain personal magnetism showed her to be that _rara avis_, a born  leader. It was fortunate indeed for the school that its headship this  year should have fallen to Margaret. The need for a firm but judicious  hand on the reins was great. During the two previous years of the  school's existence the self-government had been in a state of evolution.  For the first year, when everybody was new together, comparatively  little could be done. The school must find itself before it began to  form its private code of laws. In the second year ill-luck had raised to  the post of honor Ivy Chatterton, a clever but most untactful girl,  whose quick temper had brought her into constant collision with her  prefects. Many were the squalls which had swept over the school, of so  serious a nature sometimes as almost to wreck several of the guilds. The  younger girls, following the example of their elders, had quarreled  hotly, and indulged in an incredible amount of petty spite, and  altogether the current tone had been anything but desirable. Miss  Bishop, who had seen, to her sorrow, this downward trend, had welcomed  the advent of Margaret, believing her to have the ability to cope with  difficult situations, and at the same time to have the grit and  self-control not to allow her head to be turned by her elevation to  office.    \"You will have a great responsibility: I am giving you unusual power,  and I trust that you will make the highest use of it,\" she had said to  the girl, during a certain quiet ten minutes' talk in her study, and  Margaret had held herself very straight, and had answered: \"I'll do my  level best, Miss Bishop!\"    All eyes were now fixed on the head girl as she stood in the center of  the platform, ringing the bell for silence. The clamor subsided as if by  magic, and in the midst of a dead hush she began her speech.    \"Girls! We've been back now for a whole fortnight--time for most of us  to shake down into our places, isn't it? The school year's fairly  started, and we've met together this afternoon to talk about a number of  things that are of very great importance to us all. You all know that a  school--to be worth anything--has two sides. There's the inside part,  with classes and prep. and exams.--what's generally called the  'curriculum'--that's managed by the mistresses. And there's the outside  part, the games and sports and concerts and guilds--that's run by the  girls themselves. Now I think, if we arrange well, we ought to be able  to look forward to three very jolly terms. Everything depends upon  making a good start. I've been getting to know how they manage in  several other big schools, and I propose that we frame our code by  theirs. What we want first of all is a feeling of unity and public  spirit. Each girl must make up her mind to do all she can to push on the  'Seaton High.' We want to win matches, and have a good sports record,  and generally build up a reputation. Slacking at games must be out of  the question. Everybody must buck up all round. Those who aren't playing  themselves can show their interest by attending the matches. It makes  the greatest difference to an eleven to know that their own side is  watching their play, and ready to cheer them on. There's nothing so  forlorn and depressing as to see whole rows of the enemy's school hats  on the spectators' benches, and only half-a-dozen of one's own--yet  that's what happened when we played Harbury last spring. No wonder we  lost! I'm going to ask you presently to elect a Games Captain, and then  I want you to support her loyally for the whole of the year. Let her  feel that she can depend upon you, and that instead of getting together  scratch teams, her difficulty will be how to choose among so many crack  players. But as you know, games are not the whole of our business  to-day. We have our guilds to consider as well. I want to put these upon  a good and firm basis. Last winter we didn't quite know where we were  with them, did we? At present we have 'The Dramatic Society,' 'The  Debating Club,' 'The Literary Association,' and 'The Patriotic Knitting  Guild.' We might very well add a 'Photographic Union' and a 'Natural  History League.' They ought all to be run on the same lines. Each must  have a President, a Secretary, and a Committee of eight members, who  will undertake the business of the Society, and settle all its events.  Any difficulty or dispute must be referred to the Prefects' meeting, the  decision of which shall be final. Each guild must draw up a list of its  own rules; these must be submitted first to the Prefects, then, if  passed as satisfactory, they must be written in the minutes book, and  strictly adhered to. I want you all to realize that this school is"]]]
