Insert the needle in the centre of this  loop, on the traced line about one-sixteenth of an inch below the  starting-point. Bring it out a quarter of an inch below and outside the  loop. Take the thread in the right hand and tighten the loop that has  now been formed, and then pass the thread under the point of the needle  towards the left (see diagram). Place the left thumb over the stitch in  process of making and draw the thread through; this will complete the  first two links of the chain; to continue, repeat from the beginning.    Knotted chain is a pretty stitch; to look well it must be worked with a  stout thread. To carry it out (fig. 37)--Trace two parallel lines upon  the material, about one-eighth of an inch apart. Bring the thread  through at the right hand end in the centre between the two lines, then  insert the needle on the upper line one-sixteenth of an inch further  along, and bring it through on the lower line immediately below. Draw  the thread through and there will be a short slanting line left upon the  material. Throw the thread round to the left and hold it under the  thumb, then pass the needle and thread through the slanting line from  above downwards, leaving the thread a little slack. Place the thread  again under the thumb, then in the same way as before, from above  downwards, pass the needle and thread through this slack loop. This  makes the first two links of the chain; the last one will not be  properly fixed in place until the next stitch is taken. The dotted  vertical line on the diagram shows the piece of material taken up by the  needle upon commencing the next stitch.    [Illustration: Fig. 37.]    [Illustration: Fig. 38.]    Split stitch is a most useful one for many purposes. It is difficult to  distinguish from a fine chain when done, but in the working it much more  resembles stem stitch. It can be carried out in the hand or in a frame.  This stitch, frequently seen upon ancient work, was much used for both  draperies and features; the lines of the stitching usually, by their  direction, expressing moulding of form or folds of drapery. To work it  (fig. 38)--Bring the thread through at the lower end of the traced line,  then insert the needle about one-eighth of an inch further along, and  bring it through on the line two or three threads nearer the  starting-point; whilst bringing it through take it also through the  centre of the working thread, which thus splits each stitch.

SATIN AND SIMILAR STITCHES    Satin stitch is perhaps the most commonly used of all stitches. It is  more quickly worked by hand, but for complicated work the help of a  frame is required. Floss silk thread is seen to greatest advantage in a  stitch of this kind, for it shows off the glossiness of silk  particularly well. It is straightforward in the working and needs no  further description than is given by the diagram (fig. 39). The stitches  may vary in length, they must neither be impracticably long nor, on the  other hand, too much cut up, lest the silky effect be partly lost. These  stitches lie close together and in parallel lines; the chief difference  between satin and several other closely allied stitches being that these  others may radiate or vary in direction according to the space to be  filled. The stitch is usually worked in oblique lines; stems, leaves,  and petals would be treated in this way; sometimes it is worked  regularly having regard to the warp and woof of the material; it would  be treated thus when used in conjunction with cross or stroke stitch.    [Illustration: Fig. 39.]    It will be seen that there is as much silk at the back as on the front  of the work. There is a method of carrying out the stitch by which this  waste of material at the back is avoided; the thread is returned to the  front close to where it went through instead of crossing over and coming  up on the other side. The effect on the right side, however, is not so  good, so this method cannot be recommended.    One of the technical difficulties with satin stitch is to get a neat  firm line at the edges of the filled space; this is excellently attained  by the Chinese and Japanese, who use this satin stitch a great deal.  They frequently work each petal of a complicated flower separately,  leaving as a division, between each one and the next, a fine line of  material firmly and clearly drawn.    [Illustration: Fig. 40.]    The stitch is much used for raised work, and also lends itself well to  gradation of colour. Fig. 40 is an example of shading in satin stitch.  In this case each new row of stitches fits in just between those of the  last row; this is a bold but very effective method of expressing  gradation. A variation upon this is shown in fig. 42; the bands of  different colour are here necessarily worked in a chevron pattern which  makes the shading rather more gradual. An example of the same thing can  be seen in fig. 44 in the leaf upon which the squirrel sits. Apart from  gradation of colour, the surface to be covered by satin stitch has often  to be partitioned up in some way in order to make the satin stitches of  a practical length.    [Illustration: Fig. 41.]    Long and short stitch is a very slight variation, if any, from satin  stitch. The name describes the method of working, for it is carried out  by working alternately a long and a short stitch, the stitches being  picked up just as in satin stitch. It is useful for close fillings and  shaded work, and also as a solid outline for any kind of open filling.  The working of the stitch can be seen in fig. 41, where the band of  lightest colour on the upper part of the leaf is worked in long and  short stitch. The advantage of this way of working can be seen at once,  it makes a firm outline on the one edge and a nicely broken-up one on  the other, just ready for another shade to be worked in. In order to  carry out the rest of the shading on the leaf in the same way the  stitches can be all of the same length; this will always ensure a broken  line at the edge, which is a necessity for this method of gradation.  Long and short stitch used as an outline for a leaf with an open filling  can be seen on page 209. The _opus plumarium_ or feather stitch that we  read of in the descriptions of the old embroideries was a similar stitch  to this, and so called, some say, because it resembled the plumage of a  bird.    [Illustration: Fig. 42.]    Stem stitch, well known and frequently in use for various purposes, such  as for lines, outlines, gradated and flat fillings, and so on, is  usually done in the hand, and is quite simple; fig. 43 explains the  working. If a broad line is required the needle is put in more  obliquely, and a raised effect can be obtained by working over a laid  thread. The thread must be kept to the same side of the needle, either  to the left or to the right as better suits the purpose in hand; the  effect is more line-like when it is kept to the right. Occasionally,  when just a double line is to be worked, it is deliberately done in the  two ways, and then the line resembles a narrow plait. A solid filling  in stem stitch should be worked in lines as illustrated in the squirrel  in fig. 44. This little beast is taken from the curtain shown in Plate  VII., and is a good example of the life and interest that the  introduction of such things adds to embroideries.    [Illustration: Fig. 43.]    [Illustration: Fig. 44.]    The stitches just described were largely used in crewel work. This is a  rather vague name that denotes a decorative kind of needlework carried  out with coloured wools upon a plain white linen ground. The design is  usually composed of conventionally treated leaves and flowers, often  growing from boldly curved stems. These were partly shaded in solid  stitches, partly worked with geometrical open fillings; ornamental birds  and beasts of all kinds were introduced, and the effect of the whole was  very beautiful. The work is characteristically English, and a great  deal of it was executed in the XVIIth century. Plates VII. and VIII. are  illustrative of the type of work, and fig. 45 represents a detail. The  various stitches which occur in this drawing are stem, herring-bone,  long and short, knot, basket, buttonhole, single chain and satin  stitches.    [Illustration: Fig. 45.]    [Illustration: Fig. 46.]    [Illustration: Fig. 47.]    Overcast stitch in embroidery is practically a very short raised satin  stitch. It requires neat workmanship, and then makes a bold clear line  or outline. To work it (fig. 46)--Run or couch down a thread on the  traced line, then with fine thread cover this over with close upright  stitches, picking up as little material as possible each time in order  to make the line clear and round. The stitch is worked most perfectly in  a frame.    Back stitch sometimes makes a good line or outline. To work it (fig.  47)--Bring the needle through one-sixteenth of an inch from the end of  the traced line, insert it at the commencement and bring it through  again one-sixteenth of an inch beyond where it first came out. Each  stitch, it will be seen, commences at the point where the last one  finished.      BUTTONHOLE STITCH AND ITS APPLICATION    Buttonhole stitch, which is well known in plain needlework, is very  useful also in embroidery, besides being an important stitch in  needlepoint lace. Owing to its construction it is well suited for the  covering of raw edges, but it is also adaptable to a variety of other  purposes, such as are open or close fillings of leaves and flowers, cut  work, and the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20387"],[0,"A Thin Ghost and Others (#7)"],[1,"there seemed to be a good many insertions in it of various kinds. It  seemed quite worth while to leave a commission of five and twenty  pounds for it, and this he was able to do, for his usual agent entered  the room as he was on the point of leaving it.    That evening he rejoined his aunt at their temporary abode, which was  a small dower-house not many hundred yards from the Manor. On the  following morning the two resumed a discussion that had now lasted for  some weeks as to the equipment of the new house. Mr. Denton laid  before his relative a statement of the results of his visit to  town--particulars of carpets, of chairs, of wardrobes, and of bedroom  china. \"Yes, dear,\" said his aunt, \"but I don't see any chintzes here.  Did you go to ----?\" Mr. Denton stamped on the floor (where else,  indeed, could he have stamped?). \"Oh dear, oh dear,\" he said, \"the one  thing I missed. I _am_ sorry. The fact is I was on my way there and I  happened to be passing Robins's.\" His aunt threw up her hands.  \"Robins's! Then the next thing will be another parcel of horrible old  books at some outrageous price. I do think, James, when I am taking  all this trouble for you, you might contrive to remember the one or  two things which I specially begged you to see after. It's not as if I  was asking it for myself. I don't know whether you think I get any  pleasure out of it, but if so I can assure you it's very much the  reverse. The thought and worry and trouble I have over it you have no  idea of, and _you_ have simply to go to the shops and order the  things.\" Mr. Denton interposed a moan of penitence. \"Oh, aunt----\"  \"Yes, that's all very well, dear, and I don't want to speak sharply,  but you _must_ know how very annoying it is: particularly as it delays  the whole of our business for I can't tell how long: here is  Wednesday--the Simpsons come to-morrow, and you can't leave them. Then  on Saturday we have friends, as you know, coming for tennis. Yes,  indeed, you spoke of asking them yourself, but, of course, I had to  write the notes, and it is ridiculous, James, to look like that. We  must occasionally be civil to our neighbours: you wouldn't like to  have it said we were perfect bears. What was I saying? Well, anyhow it  comes to this, that it must be Thursday in next week at least, before  you can go to town again, and until we have decided upon the chintzes  it is impossible to settle upon one single other thing.\"    Mr. Denton ventured to suggest that as the paint and wallpapers had  been dealt with, this was too severe a view: but this his aunt was  not prepared to admit at the moment. Nor, indeed, was there any  proposition he could have advanced which she would have found herself  able to accept. However, as the day went on, she receded a little from  this position: examined with lessening disfavour the samples and price  lists submitted by her nephew, and even in some cases gave a qualified  approval to his choice.    As for him, he was naturally somewhat dashed by the consciousness of  duty unfulfilled, but more so by the prospect of a lawn-tennis party,  which, though an inevitable evil in August, he had thought there was  no occasion to fear in May. But he was to some extent cheered by the  arrival on the Friday morning of an intimation that he had secured at  the price of L12 10s. the four volumes of Poynter's manuscript diary,  and still more by the arrival on the next morning of the diary itself.    The necessity of taking Mr. and Mrs. Simpson for a drive in the car on  Saturday morning and of attending to his neighbours and guests that  afternoon prevented him from doing more than open the parcel until the  party had retired to bed on the Saturday night. It was then that he  made certain of the fact, which he had before only suspected, that he  had indeed acquired the diary of Mr. William Poynter, Squire of  Acrington (about four miles from his own parish)--that same Poynter  who was for a time a member of the circle of Oxford antiquaries, the  centre of which was Thomas Hearne, and with whom Hearne seems  ultimately to have quarrelled--a not uncommon episode in the career of  that excellent man. As is the case with Hearne's own collections, the  diary of Poynter contained a good many notes from printed books,  descriptions of coins and other antiquities that had been brought to  his notice, and drafts of letters on these subjects, besides the  chronicle of everyday events. The description in the sale-catalogue  had given Mr. Denton no idea of the amount of interest which seemed to  lie in the book, and he sat up reading in the first of the four  volumes until a reprehensibly late hour.    On the Sunday morning, after church, his aunt came into the study and  was diverted from what she had been going to say to him by the sight  of the four brown leather quartos on the table. \"What are these?\" she  said suspiciously. \"New, aren't they? Oh! are these the things that  made you forget my chintzes? I thought so. Disgusting. What did you  give for them, I should like to know? Over Ten Pounds? James, it is  really sinful. Well, if you have money to throw away on this kind of  thing, there _can_ be no reason why you should not subscribe--and  subscribe handsomely--to my anti-Vivisection League. There is not,  indeed, James, and I shall be very seriously annoyed if----. Who did  you say wrote them? Old Mr. Poynter, of Acrington? Well, of course,  there is some interest in getting together old papers about this  neighbourhood. But Ten Pounds!\" She picked up one of the volumes--not  that which her nephew had been reading--and opened it at random,  dashing it to the floor the next instant with a cry of disgust as a  earwig fell from between the pages. Mr. Denton picked it up with a  smothered expletive and said, \"Poor book! I think you're rather hard  on Mr. Poynter.\" \"Was I, my dear? I beg his pardon, but you know I  cannot abide those horrid creatures. Let me see if I've done any  mischief.\" \"No, I think all's well: but look here what you've opened  him on.\" \"Dear me, yes, to be sure! how very interesting. Do unpin it,  James, and let me look at it.\"    It was a piece of patterned stuff about the size of the quarto page,  to which it was fastened by an old-fashioned pin. James detached it  and handed it to his aunt, carefully replacing the pin in the paper.    Now, I do not know exactly what the fabric was; but it had a design  printed upon it, which completely fascinated Miss Denton. She went  into raptures over it, held it against the wall, made James do the  same, that she might retire to contemplate it from a distance: then  pored over it at close quarters, and ended her examination by  expressing in the warmest terms her appreciation of the taste of the  ancient Mr. Poynter who had had the happy idea of preserving this  sample in his diary. \"It is a most charming pattern,\" she said, \"and  remarkable too. Look, James, how delightfully the lines ripple. It  reminds one of hair, very much, doesn't it. And then these knots of  ribbon at intervals. They give just the relief of colour that is  wanted. I wonder----\" \"I was going to say,\" said James with deference,  \"I wonder if it would cost much to have it copied for our curtains.\"  \"Copied? how could you have it copied, James?\" \"Well, I don't know the  details, but I suppose that is a printed pattern, and that you could  have a block cut from it in wood or metal.\" \"Now, really, that is a  capital idea, James. I am almost inclined to be glad that you were  so--that you forgot the chintzes on Monday. At any rate, I'll promise  to forgive and forget if you get this _lovely_ old thing copied. No  one will have anything in the least like it, and mind, James, we won't  allow it to be sold. Now I _must_ go, and I've totally forgotten what  it was I came in to say: never mind, it'll keep.\"    After his aunt had gone James Denton devoted a few minutes to  examining the pattern more closely than he had yet had a chance of  doing. He was puzzled to think why it should have struck Miss Denton  so forcibly. It seemed to him not specially remarkable or pretty. No  doubt it was suitable enough for a curtain pattern: it ran in vertical  bands, and there was some indication that these were intended to  converge at the top. She was right, too, in thinking that these main  bands resembled rippling--almost curling--tresses of hair. Well, the  main thing was to find out by means of trade directories, or  otherwise, what firm would undertake the reproduction of an old  pattern of this kind. Not to delay the reader over this portion of  the story, a list of likely names was made out, and Mr. Denton fixed a  day for calling on them, or some of them, with his sample.    The first two visits which he paid were unsuccessful: but there is  luck in odd numbers. The firm in Bermondsey which was third on his  list was accustomed to handling this line. The evidence they were able  to produce justified their being entrusted with the job. \"Our Mr.  Cattell\" took a fervent personal interest in it. \"It's 'eartrending,  isn't it, sir,\" he said, \"to picture the quantity of reelly lovely  medeevial stuff of this kind that lays well-nigh unnoticed in many of  our residential country 'ouses: much of it in peril, I take it, of  being cast aside as so much rubbish. What is it Shakespeare  says--unconsidered trifles. Ah, I often say he 'as a word for us all,  sir. I say Shakespeare, but I'm well aware all don't 'old with me  there--I 'ad something of an upset the other day when a gentleman came  in--a titled man, too, he was, and I think he told me he'd wrote on  the topic, and I 'appened to cite out something about 'Ercules and the  painted cloth. Dear me, you never see such a pother. But as to this,  what you've kindly confided to us, it's a piece of work we shall take  a reel enthusiasm in achieving it out to the very best of our ability.
