The young tenor showed him his  copy of the contract and was horrified to be told that he had bound  himself to his Shylock for a lifetime; that the contract read that he  was to give Vergine five years of actual singing. Caruso would have  reached the age of fifty before the last payment came. The matter was  finally adjusted by the courts, and the unscrupulous teacher lost  200,000 lire by the judgment.    In Italy every man must serve his time in the army, and Caruso was  checked in his operatic career by the call to go into barracks. Not  long, however, was he compelled to undergo the tedium of army life. In  consideration of his art he was permitted to offer his brother as a  substitute after two months, and he returned to the opera. He was  engaged immediately for a season at Caserta, and from that time his rise  has been steady and unimpeded. After singing in one Italian city after  another he went to Egypt and thence to Paris, where he made a favorable  impression. A season in Berlin followed, but the Wagner influence was  dominant, and he did not succeed in restoring the supremacy of Italian  opera. The next season was spent in South America, and in the new world  Caruso made his first triumph. From Rio he went to London, and on his  first appearance he captured his Covent Garden audience. When he made  his first appearance in the United States he was already at the top of  the operatic ladder, and, although many attempts to dislodge him have  been made, he stands still on the topmost rung.          From a Personal Viewpoint      Of the thousands of people who visit the opera during the season few  outside of the small proportion of the initiated realize how much the  performance of the singer whom they see and hear on the stage is  dependent on previous rehearsal, constant practice and watchfulness over  the physical conditions that preserve that most precious of our assets,  the voice.    Nor does this same great public in general know of what the singer often  suffers in the way of nervousness or stage fright before appearing in  front of the footlights, nor that his life, outwardly so feted and  brilliant, is in private more or less of a retired, ascetic one and that  his social pleasures must be strictly limited.    These conditions, of course, vary greatly with the individual singer,  but I will try to tell in the following articles, as exemplified in my  own case, what a great responsibility a voice is when one considers that  it is the great God-given treasure which brings us our fame and  fortune.    I am perhaps more favored than many in the fact that my voice was always  \"there,\" and that, with proper cultivation, of course, I have not had to  overstrain it in the attempt to reach vocal heights which have come to  some only after severe and long-continued effort. But, on the other  hand, the finer the natural voice the more sedulous the care required to  preserve it in its pristine freshness to bloom. This is the singer's  ever present problem--in my case, however, mostly a matter of common  sense living.    As regards eating--a rather important item, by the way--I have kept to  the light \"continental\" breakfast, which I do not take too early; then a  rather substantial luncheon toward two o'clock. My native macaroni,  specially prepared by my chef, who is engaged particularly for his  ability in this way, is often a feature in this midday meal. I incline  toward the simpler and more nourishing food, though my tastes are broad  in the matter, but lay particular stress on the excellence of the  cooking, for one cannot afford to risk one's health on indifferently  cooked food, no matter what its quality.    On the nights when I sing I take nothing after luncheon, except perhaps  a sandwich and a glass of Chianti, until after the performance, when I  have a supper of whatever I fancy within reasonable bounds. Being  blessed with a good digestion, I have not been obliged to take the  extraordinary precautions about what I eat that some singers do. Still,  I am careful never to indulge to excess in the pleasures of the table,  for the condition of our alimentary apparatus and that of the vocal  chords are very closely related, and the unhealthy state of the one  immediately reacts on the other.    My reason for abstaining from food for so long before singing may be  inquired. It is simply that when the large space required by the  diaphragm in expanding to take in breath is partly occupied by one's  dinner the result is that one cannot take as deep a breath as one would  like and consequently the tone suffers and the all-important ease of  breathing is interfered with. In addition a certain amount of bodily  energy is used in the process of digestion which would otherwise be  entirely given to the production of the voice.    These facts, seemingly so simple, are very vital ones to a singer,  particularly on an \"opening night.\" A singer's life is such an active  one, with rehearsals and performances, that not much opportunity is  given for \"exercise,\" and the time given to this must, of course, be  governed by individual needs. I find a few simple physical exercises in  the morning after rising, somewhat similar to those practiced in the  army, or the use for a few minutes of a pair of light dumbbells, very  beneficial. Otherwise I must content myself with an occasional  automobile ride. One must not forget, however, that the exercise of  singing, with its constant deep inhalation (and acting in itself is  considerable exercise also), tends much to keep one from acquiring an  over-supply of embonpoint.    A proper moderation in eating, however, as I have already said, will  contribute as much to the maintenance of correct proportion in one's  figure as any amount of voluntary exercise which one only goes through  with on principle.    As so many of you in a number of States of this great country are  feeling and expressing as well as voting opinions on the subject of  whether one should or should not drink intoxicants, you may inquire what  practice is most in consonance with a singer's well being, in my  opinion. Here, again, of course, customs vary with the individual. In  Italy we habitually drink the light wines of the country with our meals  and surely are never the worse for it. I have retained my fondness for  my native Chianti, which I have even made on my own Italian estate, but  believe and carry out the belief that moderation is the only possible  course. I am inclined to condemn the use of spirits, whisky in  particular, which is so prevalent in the Anglo-Saxon countries, for it  is sure to inflame the delicate little ribbons of tissue which produce  the singing tone and then--_addio_ to a clear and ringing high C!    Though I indulge occasionally in a cigarette, I advise all singers,  particularly young singers, against this practice, which can certainly  not fail to have a bad effect on the delicate lining of the throat, the  vocal chords and the lungs.    You will see by all the foregoing that even the gift of a good breath is  not to be abused or treated lightly, and that the \"goose with the golden  egg\" must be most carefully nurtured.    Outside of this, however, one of the great temptations that beset any  singer of considerable fame is the many social demands that crowd upon  him, usually unsought and largely undesired. Many of the invitations to  receptions, teas and dinners are from comparative strangers and cannot  be considered, but of those from one's friends which it would be a  pleasure to attend very few indeed can be accepted, for the singer's  first care, even if a selfish one, must be for his health and  consequently his voice, and the attraction of social intercourse must,  alas, be largely foregone.    The continual effort of loud talking in a throng would be extremely bad  for the sensitive musical instrument that the vocalist carries in his  throat, and the various beverages offered at one of your afternoon teas  it would be too difficult to refuse. So I confine myself to an  occasional quiet dinner with a few friends on an off night at the opera  or any evening at the play, where I can at least be silent during the  progress of the acts.    In common with most of the foreign singers who come to America, I have  suffered somewhat from the effects of your barbarous climate, with its  sudden changes of temperature, but perhaps have become more accustomed  to it in the years of my operatic work here. What has affected me most,  however, is the overheating of the houses and hotels with that dry steam  heat which is so trying to the throat. Even when I took a house for the  season I had difficulty in keeping the air moist. Now, however, in the  very modern and excellent hotel where I am quartered they have a new  system of ventilation by which the air is automatically rendered pure  and the heat controlled--a great blessing to the over-sensitive  vocalist.    After reading the above the casual person will perhaps believe that a  singer's life is really not a bit of a sinecure, even when he has  attained the measure of this world's approval and applause afforded by  the \"great horseshoe.\"          The Voice and Tone Production      The question, \"How is it done?\" as applied to the art of singing brings  up so many different points that it is difficult to know where to begin  or how to give the layman in any kind of limited space a concise idea of  the principles controlling the production of the voice and their  application to vocal art.    Every singer or singing master is popularly supposed to have a method by  following out which he has come to fame. Yet if asked to describe this  method many an artist would be at a loss to do so, or else deny that he  had any specific method at all, such a subtle and peculiarly individual  matter it is that constitutes the technical part of singing. Most  singers--in fact, all of them--d"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/201"],[0,"Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions (Illustrated) (#7)"],[1,"art of lipspeech and lip-reading, so it is with us as regards  \"Seeing\" and \"Feeling\".  None who in early life resort to \"Feeling\"  will ever learn \"Seeing\" in perfection.    For this reason, among our Higher Classes, \"Feeling\" is discouraged or  absolutely forbidden.  From the cradle their children, instead of going  to the Public Elementary schools (where the art of Feeling is taught),  are sent to higher Seminaries of an exclusive character; and at our  illustrious University, to \"feel\" is regarded as a most serious fault,  involving Rustication for the first offence, and Expulsion for the  second.    But among the lower classes the art of Sight Recognition is regarded as  an unattainable luxury.  A common Tradesman cannot afford to let his  son spend a third of his life in abstract studies.  The children of the  poor are therefore allowed to \"feel\" from their earliest years, and  they gain thereby a precocity and an early vivacity which contrast at  first most favourably with the inert, undeveloped, and listless  behaviour of the half-instructed youths of the Polygonal class; but  when the latter have at last completed their University course, and are  prepared to put their theory into practice, the change that comes over  them may almost be described as a new birth, and in every art, science,  and social pursuit they rapidly overtake and distance their Triangular  competitors.    Only a few of the Polygonal Class fail to pass the Final Test or  Leaving Examination at the University.  The condition of the  unsuccessful minority is truly pitiable.  Rejected from the higher  class, they are also despised by the lower.  They have neither the  matured and systematically trained powers of the Polygonal Bachelors  and Masters of Arts, nor yet the native precocity and mercurial  versatility of the youthful Tradesman.  The professions, the public  services, are closed against them; and though in most States they are  not actually debarred from marriage, yet they have the greatest  difficulty in forming suitable alliances, as experience shews that the  offspring of such unfortunate and ill-endowed parents is generally  itself unfortunate, if not positively Irregular.    It is from these specimens of the refuse of our Nobility that the great  Tumults and Seditions of past ages have generally derived their  leaders; and so great is the mischief thence arising that an increasing  minority of our more progressive Statesmen are of opinion that true  mercy would dictate their entire suppression, by enacting that all who  fail to pass the Final Examination of the University should be either  imprisoned for life, or extinguished by a painless death.    But I find myself digressing into the subject of Irregularities, a  matter of such vital interest that it demands a separate section.          Section 7.  Concerning Irregular Figures        Throughout the previous pages I have been assuming--what perhaps should  have been laid down at the beginning as a distinct and fundamental  proposition--that every human being in Flatland is a Regular Figure,  that is to say of regular construction.  By this I mean that a Woman  must not only be a line, but a straight line; that an Artisan or  Soldier must have two of his sides equal; that Tradesmen must have  three sides equal; Lawyers (of which class I am a humble member), four  sides equal, and generally, that in every Polygon, all the sides must  be equal.    The size of the sides would of course depend upon the age of the  individual.  A Female at birth would be about an inch long, while a  tall adult Woman might extend to a foot.  As to the Males of every  class, it may be roughly said that the length of an adult's sides, when  added together, is two feet or a little more.  But the size of our  sides is not under consideration.  I am speaking of the EQUALITY of  sides, and it does not need much reflection to see that the whole of  the social life in Flatland rests upon the fundamental fact that Nature  wills all Figures to have their sides equal.    If our sides were unequal our angles might be unequal.  Instead of its  being sufficient to feel, or estimate by sight, a single angle in order  to determine the form of an individual, it would be necessary to  ascertain each angle by the experiment of Feeling.  But life would be  too short for such a tedious grouping.  The whole science and art of  Sight Recognition would at once perish; Feeling, so far as it is an  art, would not long survive; intercourse would become perilous or  impossible; there would be an end to all confidence, all forethought;  no one would be safe in making the most simple social arrangements; in  a word, civilization would relapse into barbarism.    Am I going too fast to carry my Readers with me to these obvious  conclusions?  Surely a moment's reflection, and a single instance from  common life, must convince every one that our whole social system is  based upon Regularity, or Equality of Angles.  You meet, for example,  two or three Tradesmen in the street, whom you recognize at once to be  Tradesmen by a glance at their angles and rapidly bedimmed sides, and  you ask them to step into your house to lunch.  This you do at present  with perfect confidence, because everyone knows to an inch or two the  area occupied by an adult Triangle:  but imagine that your Tradesman  drags behind his regular and respectable vertex, a parallelogram of  twelve or thirteen inches in diagonal:--what are you to do with such a  monster sticking fast in your house door?    But I am insulting the intelligence of my Readers by accumulating  details which must be patent to everyone who enjoys the advantages of a  Residence in Spaceland.  Obviously the measurements of a single angle  would no longer be sufficient under such portentous circumstances;  one's whole life would be taken up in feeling or surveying the  perimeter of one's acquaintances.  Already the difficulties of avoiding  a collision in a crowd are enough to tax the sagacity of even a  well-educated Square; but if no one could calculate the Regularity of a  single figure in the company, all would be chaos and confusion, and the  slightest panic would cause serious injuries, or--if there happened to  be any Women or Soldiers present--perhaps considerable loss of life.    Expediency therefore concurs with Nature in stamping the seal of its  approval upon Regularity of conformation:  nor has the Law been  backward in seconding their efforts.  \"Irregularity of Figure\" means  with us the same as, or more than, a combination of moral obliquity and  criminality with you, and is treated accordingly.  There are not  wanting, it is true, some promulgators of paradoxes who maintain that  there is no necessary connection between geometrical and moral  Irregularity.  \"The Irregular\", they say, \"is from his birth scouted by  his own parents, derided by his brothers and sisters, neglected by the  domestics, scorned and suspected by society, and excluded from all  posts of responsibility, trust, and useful activity.  His every  movement is jealously watched by the police till he comes of age and  presents himself for inspection; then he is either destroyed, if he is  found to exceed the fixed margin of deviation, or else immured in a  Government Office as a clerk of the seventh class; prevented from  marriage; forced to drudge at an uninteresting occupation for a  miserable stipend; obliged to live and board at the office, and to take  even his vacation under close supervision; what wonder that human  nature, even in the best and purest, is embittered and perverted by  such surroundings!\"    All this very plausible reasoning does not convince me, as it has not  convinced the wisest of our Statesmen, that our ancestors erred in  laying it down as an axiom of policy that the toleration of  Irregularity is incompatible with the safety of the State.  Doubtless,  the life of an Irregular is hard; but the interests of the Greater  Number require that it shall be hard.  If a man with a triangular front  and a polygonal back were allowed to exist and to propagate a still  more Irregular posterity, what would become of the arts of life?  Are  the houses and doors and churches in Flatland to be altered in order to  accommodate such monsters?  Are our ticket-collectors to be required to  measure every man's perimeter before they allow him to enter a theatre  or to take his place in a lecture room?  Is an Irregular to be exempted  from the militia?  And if not, how is he to be prevented from carrying  desolation into the ranks of his comrades?  Again, what irresistible  temptations to fraudulent impostures must needs beset such a creature!  How easy for him to enter a shop with his polygonal front foremost, and  to order goods to any extent from a confiding tradesman!  Let the  advocates of a falsely called Philanthropy plead as they may for the  abrogation of the Irregular Penal Laws, I for my part have never known  an Irregular who was not also what Nature evidently intended him to  be--a hypocrite, a misanthropist, and, up to the limits of his power, a  perpetrator of all manner of mischief.    Not that I should be disposed to recommend (at present) the extreme  measures adopted by some States, where an infant whose angle deviates  by half a degree from the correct angularity is summarily destroyed at  birth.  Some of our highest and ablest men, men of real genius, have  during their earliest days laboured under deviations as great as, or  even greater than, forty-five minutes: and the loss of their precious  lives would have been an irreparable injury to the State.  The art of  healing also has achieved some of its most glorious triumphs in the  compressions, extensions, trepannings, colligations, and other surgical  or diaetetic operations by which Irregularity has been partly or wholly  cured.  Advocating therefore a VIA MEDIA, I would lay down no fixed or  absolute line of"]]]
