More French troops soon  after disembarked under the command of La Brosse, who was followed by  the bishop of Amiens, and three doctors of the Sorbonne. These last  were supplied with store of syllogisms, authorities, citations, and  scholastic arguments, which they intended to oppose to the Scottish  preachers, and which, they justly presumed, would acquire force,  and produce conviction, by the influence of the French arms and  artillery.[**]         * See note D, at the end of the volume.         ** Spotswood, p. 134. Thuan. lib. xxiv. c. 10.    The constable Montmorency had always opposed the marriage of the dauphin  with the queen of Scots, and had foretold that, by forming such close  connections with Scotland, the ancient league would be dissolved; and  the natives of that kingdom, jealous of a foreign yoke, would soon  become, instead of allies, attached by interest and inclination, the  most inveterate enemies to the French government. But though the event  seemed now to have justified the prudence of that aged minister, it is  not improbable, considering the violent counsels by which France  was governed, that the insurrection was deemed a favorable event; as  affording a pretence for sending over armies, for entirely subduing the  country, for attainting the rebels,[*] and for preparing means thence to  invade England, and support Mary's title to the crown of that kingdom.  The leaders of the congregation, well acquainted with these views, were  not insensible of their danger, and saw that their only safety consisted  in the vigor and success of their measures. They were encouraged by  the intelligence received of the sudden death of Henry II.; and having  passed an act from their own authority, depriving the queen dowager of  the regency, and ordering all the French troops to evacuate the kingdom,  they collected forces to put their edict in execution against them. They  again became masters of Edinburgh; but found themselves unable to keep  long possession of that city. Their tumultuary armies, assembled in  haste, and supported by no pay, soon separated upon the least disaster,  or even any delay of success; and were incapable of resisting such  veteran troops as the French, who were also seconded by some of the  Scottish nobility, among whom the earl of Bothwell distinguished  himself., Hearing that the marquis of Elbeuf, brother to the regent,  was levying an army against them in Germany, they thought themselves  excusable for applying, in this extremity, to the assistance of England;  and as the sympathy of religion, as well as regard to national liberty,  had now counterbalanced the ancient animosity against that kingdom, this  measure was the result of inclination no less than of interest.[**]  [5] Maitland of Lidington, therefore, and Robert Melvil, were secretly  despatched by the congregation to solicit succors from Elizabeth.         * Forbes, vol. i. p. 139. Thuan. lib. xxiv. c. 13.         ** See note E, at the end of the volume.    The wise council of Elizabeth did not long deliberate in agreeing to  this request, which concurred so well with the views and interests of  their mistress. Cecil in particular represented to the queen, that the  union of the crowns of Scotland and France, both of them the hereditary  enemies of England, was ever regarded as a pernicious event; and her  father, as well as Protector Somerset, had employed every expedient both  of war and negotiation to prevent it: that the claim which Mary advanced  to the crown rendered the present situation of England still more  dangerous, and demanded on the part of the queen the greatest vigilance  and precaution; that the capacity, ambition, and exorbitant views of the  family of Guise, who now governed the French counsels, were sufficiently  known; and they themselves made no secret of their design to place  their niece on the throne of England: that deeming themselves secure of  success, they had already, somewhat imprudently and prematurely, taken  off the mask; and Throgmorton, the English ambassador at Paris,  sent over, by every courier, incontestable proofs of their hostile  intentions:[*] that they only waited till Scotland should be entirely  subdued; and having thus deprived the English of the advantages  resulting from their situation and naval power, they prepared means for  subverting the queen's authority: that the zealous Catholics in England,  discontented with the present government, and satisfied in the legality  of Mary's title, would bring them considerable reenforcement, and would  disturb every measure of defence against that formidable power: that the  only expedient for preventing these designs, was to seize the present  opportunity, and take advantage of a like zeal in the Protestants of  Scotland; nor could any doubt be entertained with regard to the justice  of a measure founded on such evident necessity, and directed only to the  ends of self-preservation: that though a French war, attended with great  expense, seemed the necessary consequence of supporting the malecontents  in Scotland, that power, if removed to the continent, would be much less  formidable; and a small disbursement at present would, in the end,  be found the greatest frugality: and that the domestic dissensions of  France, which every day augmented, together with the alliance of Philip,  who, notwithstanding his bigotry and hypocrisy, would never permit the  entire conquest of England, were sufficient to secure the queen against  the dangerous ambition and resentment of the house of Guise.[**]         * Forbes, vol. i. p. 134, 136, 149, 150, 159, 165, 181, 194,       229, 231, 235--241, 253.         ** Forbes, vol. i. p 387 Jebb, vol. i. p. 448.

Elizabeth's propensity to caution and economy was, though with some  difficulty,[*] overcome by these powerful motives and she prepared  herself to support by arms and money the declining affairs of the  congregation in Scotland. She equipped a fleet, which consisted of  thirteen ships of war; and giving the command of it to Winter, she sent  it to the Frith of Forth: she appointed the young duke of Norfolk her  lieutenant in the northern counties; and she assembled, at Berwick, an  army of eight thousand men under the command of Lord Gray, warden of  the east and middle marches. Though the court of France, sensible of the  danger, offered her to make immediate restitution of Calais, provided  she would not interpose in the affairs of Scotland, she resolutely  replied, that she never would put an inconsiderable fishing-town  in competition with the safety of her dominions;[**] and she still  continued her preparations. She concluded a treaty of mutual defence  with the congregation, which was to last during the marriage of the  queen of Scots with Francis, and a year after; and she promised never to  desist till the French had entirely evacuated Scotland.[***] And having  thus taken all proper measures for success, and received from the Scots  six hostages for the performance of articles, she ordered her fleet and  army to begin their operations.         * Forbes, vol. i. p. 454, 460.         ** Spotswood, p. 146.         *** Knox, p. 217.

The English army, reenforced  by five thousand Scots,[*] sat down before the place; and after two  skirmishes, in the former of which the English had the advantage, in the  latter the French, they began to batter the town; and, though repulsed  with considerable loss in a rash and ill-conducted assault, they reduced  the garrison to great difficulties. Their distress was augmented by two  events; the dispersion by a storm of D'Elbeuf's fleet, which carried a  considerable army on board,[**] and the death of the queen, regent, who  expired about this time in the Castle of Edinburgh; a woman endowed with  all the capacity which shone forth in her family, but possessed of much  more virtue and moderation than appeared in the conduct of the other  branches of it. The French, who found it impossible to subsist for want  of provisions, and who saw that the English were continually reenforced  by fresh numbers, were obliged to capitulate; and the bishop of Valence  and Count Randan, plenipotentiaries from France, signed a treaty at  Edinburgh with Cecil and Dr. Wotton, whom Elizabeth had sent thither for  that purpose. It was there stipulated, that the French should instantly  evacuate Scotland; that the king and queen of France and Scotland should  thenceforth abstain from bearing the arms of England, or assuming the  title of that kingdom; that further satisfaction for the injury  already done in that particular should be granted Elizabeth; and that  commissioners should meet to settle this point, or, if they could not  agree, that the king of Spain should be umpire between the crowns.  Besides these stipulations, which regarded England, some concessions  were granted to the Scots; namely, that an amnesty should be published  for all past offences; that none but natives should enjoy any office in  Scotland; that the states should name twenty-four persons, of whom the  queen of Scots should choose seven, and the states five, and in the  hands of these twelve should the whole administration be placed during  their queen's absence; and that Mary should neither make peace nor war  without consent of the states.[***] In order to hasten the execution of  this important treaty, Elizabeth sent ships, by which the French forces  were transported into"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19215"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol. I., Part E. (#7)"],[1,"openly, and solemnly, and in numerous  instances, exercised for the most invidious purpose; in order to extort  loans, or rather subsidies, without consent of parliament.         * Rushworth, vol. i. p. 462.         ** State Trials, vol. vii. p. 147.         *** State Trials, vol. vii. p. 161.    But this was not the only hardship of which the nation thought they had  reason to complain. The army which had made the fruitless expedition to  Cadiz, was dispersed throughout the kingdom; and money was levied upon  the counties for the payment of their quarters.[*]    The soldiers were billeted upon private houses, contrary to custom,  which required that, in all ordinary cases, they should be quartered in  inns and public houses.[**]    Those who had refused or delayed the loan, were sure to be loaded with a  great number of these dangerous and disorderly guests.    Many too, of low condition, who had shown a refractory disposition, were  pressed into the service, and enlisted in the fleet or army,[***] Sir  Peter Hayman, for the same reason, was despatched on an errand to the  Palatinate.[****] Glanville, an eminent lawyer, had been obliged,  during the former interval of parliament, to accept of an office in the  navy.[v]    The soldiers, ill paid and undisciplined, committed many crimes and  outrages, and much increased the public discontents. To prevent these  disorders, martial law, so requisite to the support of discipline, was  exercised upon the soldiers. By a contradiction which is natural when  the people are exasperated, the outrages of the army were complained  of; the remedy was thought still more intolerable.[v*] Though the  expediency, if we are not rather to say the necessity, of martial law  had formerly been deemed of itself a sufficient ground for establishing  it, men, now become more jealous of liberty, and more refined reasoners  in questions of government, regarded as illegal and arbitrary every  exercise of authority which was not supported by express statute or  uninterrupted precedent.         * Rushworth, vol. i. p. 419.         ** Rushworth, vol. i. p. 419.         *** Rushworth, vol. i. p. 422.         **** Rushworth, vol i. p. 481.         v    Parl.

It may safely be affirmed, that, except a few courtiers or  ecclesiastics, all men were displeased with this high exertion of  prerogative, and this new spirit of administration. Though ancient  precedents were pleaded in favor of the king's measures, a considerable  difference, upon comparison, was observed between the cases. Acts of  power, however irregular, might casually, and at intervals, be exercised  by a prince, for the sake of despatch or expediency, and yet liberty  still subsist in some tolerable degree under his administration.  But where all these were reduced into a system, were exerted without  interruption, were studiously sought for, in order to supply the  place of laws, and subdue the refractory spirit of the nation, it was  necessary to find some speedy remedy, or finally to abandon all hopes of  preserving the freedom of the constitution. Nor did moderate men esteem  the provocation which the king had received, though great, sufficient  to warrant all these violent measures. The commons as yet had nowise  invaded his authority: they had only exercised, as best pleased them,  their own privileges. Was he justifiable, because from one house of  parliament he had met with harsh and unkind treatment, to make, in  revenge, an invasion on the rights and liberties of the whole nation?    But great was at this time the surprise of all men, when Charles,  baffled in every attempt against the Austrian dominions, embroiled with  his own subjects, unsupplied with any treasure but what he extorted  by the most invidious and most dangerous measures; as if the half of  Europe, now his enemy, were not sufficient for the exercise of military  prowess; wantonly attacked France, the other great kingdom in his  neighborhood, and engaged at once in war against these two powers, whose  interests were hitherto deemed so incompatible that they could never,  it was thought, agree either in the same friendships or enmities. All  authentic memoirs, both foreign and domestic, ascribe to Buckingham's  counsels this war with France, and represent him as actuated by motives  which would appear incredible, were we not acquainted with the violence  and temerity of his character.    The three great monarchies of Europe were at this time ruled by young  princes, Philip, Louis, and Charles, who were nearly of the same  age, and who had resigned the government of themselves, and of their  kingdoms, to their creatures and ministers, Olivarez, Richelieu, and  Buckingham. The people, whom the moderate temper or narrow genius of  their princes would have allowed to remain forever in tranquillity, were  strongly agitated by the emulation and jealousy of the ministers. Above  all, the towering spirit of Richelieu, incapable of rest, promised an  active age, and gave indications of great revolutions throughout all  Europe.    This man had no sooner, by suppleness and intrigue, gotten possession of  the reins of government, than he formed at once three mighty projects;  to subdue the turbulent spirits of the great, to reduce the rebellious  Hugonots, and to curb the encroaching power of the house of Austria.  Undaunted and implacable, prudent and active, he braved all the  opposition of the French princes and nobles in the prosecution of his  vengeance; he discovered and dissipated all their secret cabals and  conspiracies. His sovereign himself he held in subjection, while  he exalted the throne. The people, while they lost their liberties,  acquired, by means of his administration, learning, order, discipline,  and renown. That confused and inaccurate genius of government, of which  France partook in common with other European kingdoms, he changed into  a simple monarchy; at the very time when the incapacity of Buckingham  encouraged the free spirit of the commons to establish in England a  regular system of liberty.    However unequal the comparison between these ministers, Buckingham had  entertained a mighty jealousy against Richelieu; a jealousy not founded  on rivalship of power and politics, but of love and gallantry; where the  duke was as much superior to the cardinal, as he was inferior in every  other particular.    At the time when Charles married by proxy the princess Henrietta,  the duke of Buckingham had been sent to France, in order to grace the  nuptials, and conduct the new queen into England. The eyes of the French  court were directed by curiosity towards that man who had enjoyed the  unlimited favor of two successive monarchs, and who, from a private  station, had mounted, in the earliest youth, to the absolute government  of three kingdoms. The beauty of his person, the gracefulness of his  air, the splendor of his equipage, his fine taste in dress, festivals,  and carousals, corresponded to the prepossessions entertained in his  favor: the affability of his behavior, the gayety of his manners,  the magnificence of his expense, increased still further the general  admiration which was paid him. All business being already concerted, the  time was entirely spent in mirth and entertainments; and during those  splendid scenes among that gay people, the duke found himself in a  situation where he was perfectly qualified to excel.[*]         * Clarendon, vol. i. p. 38.    But his great success at Paris proved as fatal as his former failure  at Madrid. Encouraged by the smiles of the court, he dared to carry  his ambitious addresses to the queen herself; and he failed not to  make impression on a heart not undisposed to the tender passions. That  attachment at least of the mind, which appears so delicious, and is so  dangerous, seems to have been encouraged by the princess; and the  duke presumed so far on her good graces, that, after his departure, he  secretly returned upon some pretence, and, paying a visit to the queen,  was dismissed with a reproof which savored more of kindness than of  anger.[*]    Information of this correspondence was soon carried to Richelieu. The  vigilance of that minister was here further roused by jealousy. He, too,  either from vanity or politics, had ventured to pay his addresses to  the queen. But a priest, past middle age, of a severe character, and  occupied in the most extensive plans of ambition or vengeance, was  but an unequal match, in that contest, for a young courtier, entirely  disposed to gayety and gallantry. The cardinal's disappointment strongly  inclined him to counterwork the amorous projects of his rival. When the  duke was making preparations for a new embassy to Paris, a message was  sent him from Louis, that he must not think of such a journey. In a  romantic passion he swore, \"That he would see the queen, in spite of  all the power of France;\" and, from that moment, he determined to engage  England in a war with that kingdom.[**]    He first took advantage of some quarrels excited by the queen of  England's attendants; and he persuaded Charles to dismiss at once  all her French servants, contrary to the articles of the marriage  treaty.[***] He encouraged the English ships of war and privateers to  seize vessels belonging to French merchants; and these he forthwith  condemned as prizes, by a sentence of the court of admiralty. But  finding that all these injuries produced only remonstrances and  embassies, or at most reprisals, on the part of France, he resolved to  second the intrigues of the duke of Soubize, and to undertake at once a  military expedition against that kingdom.         * Memoires de Mad. de Motteville.         ** Clarendon, vol. i. p. 38         *** Rushworth, vol. i. p. 423, 424.
