It is true that      the American statesmen have fallen into the same error as the      European--_id est_, to believe that without _them_ the people could      never prosper, and still live in the belief that home-happiness      hangs on them, their theories and arts of governing; but the most      superficial glance teaches that if wise laws are able to effect      more for the happiness of man than they can bring about, still no      one should _there_ attempt to draw happiness from such a source      when popular and private life have combined to bestow it. But      should the happiness of the Americans ever be derived from this      side, it will be more sensible to assume that the foundation      thereof will be the release from that which in the recent culture      has passed for the deepest political wisdom. The true secret of      all the good fortune of America lies in the favorable condition of      external things. 'It is not with them as in Europe, where the poor      can only better their condition or become rich by making the rich      poor, for therein lies the source of an infinite strife which hath      been combated for centuries, with the axioms of religion and      morals. But in America, men when striving to better their      condition, instead of becoming enemies and turning their arms      against each other, strive with _Nature_, and wring from her      boundless stores that wealth which she so bountifully affords!'\"      We have made these quotations less on account of any merit which they  possess, than to give our readers an idea of the general opinion  prevailing in Germany in regard to our country; and to confirm an  assertion made in a recent number of the _International_, that in no  country in Europe are we so impartially and favorably judged. There is one  particular, however, in which we find this book worthy of especial praise.  The author highly commends the flourishing state of religion in the United  States, declaring that we are in this respect superior to the Germans, and  that on the Sabbath the churches are filled to a degree unknown in Europe.  It is from our deep-rooted attachment to domestic life, and our observance  of religion, that he correctly deduces our true happiness, as separated  from the natural advantages of the country. It is greatly to be desired  that the majority of his countrymen resident in America, would allow  themselves to be impressed in a similar manner as to the advantages of  piety and Sabbath-keeping. There is in the United States a vast number of  German newspapers--conducted we should imagine for the greater part by  unprincipled and worthless adventurers of the red republican, socialist  stamp, who, despite the protection which they here enjoy, incessantly and  spitefully abuse every institution to which they are really indebted for  their asylum among us, and most of all our observation of the Sabbath, in  a style which entitles them to something severer than mere contempt. But  Herr Bromme is right. Respect for morality and religion, a due regard for  the Sabbath, and a dependence on the home-circle for pleasure and  recreation, are the surest safeguard of peace, happiness, and prosperity.            A VISIT TO THE FIRE WORSHIPPERS' TEMPLE AT BAKU.      In a recent number of the _Russian Archives for Scientific Information_,  is an account of a visit made by a Russian lady of distinction, in company  with her husband and sons, to a temple of the Indian sect of Gebers, or  Fire Worshippers, near Baku, a city of Georgia, lying on the Caspian Sea.  We translate this interesting narrative for the _International_, as  follows:    In order the better to enjoy the spectacle of the fire, we chose the  evening for our excursion thither; but a thick fog came on, which made the  road difficult and dangerous. When we finally reached the place it was  pitch dark; the flames were rising in beautiful purity to the peaceful sky  of night, and the entire castle, within which was the temple, seemed to be  surrounded by a circle of watch-fires. These were lighted by Persians from  the neighborhood, who were busy burning lime and baking bread, dark forms  like those which worked on the tower of Babel, and burnt lime for it. They  were now brought here by the ease and cheapness of carrying on their  occupations. All that is necessary is to make a hole in the ground, touch  a burning coal to it, and an inexhaustible flame rises forth like a  spring. Behind this range of little flames and fires, rose, in the pale  light, the dirty white walls of the castle, in the centre of which there  flashed from the summit of two lofty pillars great masses of the purest,  clearest, and keenest flame, which were now bent down horizontally and  wreathed like serpents by the force of the wind, and now rose  perpendicularly to the sky, whose dome they lighted up like two vast altar  tapers. We drove around the edifice, and stopped on one side where there  were no flames rising from the earth. A fine rain was falling, but we  remained without while our guide went in to announce us. He came back  immediately with a swarthy Hindoo. The sight of this man impressed me  strangely, and I forgot that he belonged to a remote colony of a few  individuals, and asked myself if we had been suddenly transported to  India, or if India had been brought up to the Caspian.    We went into the court-yard, in which stands the temple, with its two  fire-pillars. About half way up hang a couple of large bells, which the  Hindoo sounded by way of preparing us for what we were to see. There was  something fearful in the loud clangor, and my boys crowded close beside  me. Except our party, no one was to be seen except the swart Geber, in his  white turban and long brown robe, with just enough of a pair of light blue  trowsers visible to bring into distinctness his naked black feet. His  features were noble, and his beard long and black. He looked like a  conjurer, like the lord of an enchanted castle, summoning his spirits. The  hissing fire, as if obeying him, flashed up more brightly at the crash of  the bells; now it was clear as day around us, and now it was twilight as  the wind lowered the flame. My husband and sons and the guide who had  brought us to the place, were all dressed in oriental costume, and I alone  seemed to belong to Europe. A shudder of home-sickness came over me, and  at every moment I expected to see something monstrous, to behold all the  cruelties of a heathenish and barbarous worship.    The interpreter now summoned us to follow the Geber. We were told that the  castle was built by a rich Indian nabob, who was a fire worshipper, and  who, with his followers, long inhabited it. Now, only three Hindoos remain  from that period of splendor. But nature remains eternally the same, and  whether worshipped or not, the flames still shine and awe the  superstitious, and so great is the fame of the place that many pilgrims  come yearly from distant India to pray, and to have prayers said for them,  here in the visible presence of the primeval light.    At last we came to the cell of the priest, and on his invitation entered  it. We passed through a low door, and down a few steps, and found  ourselves in a small, semicircular, low, but very white room, with a floor  of mason-work, and a small altar in the centre. Around the wall were  seats, also of mason-work. In the altar there was an opening as large as a  gun-barrel, from which rose a slender flame that lighted the room very  clearly. There were other little openings on the sides of the altar. The  Hindoo took a wisp of straw, lighted it, and touched these openings, from  which the most beautiful flames at once issued. The children, who had  never seen gas lights, or at least did not remember them, regarded all  this as the most perfect witchery. On a second altar, which, like the  first, was about the height of a common table, lay or stood the idols and  treasures of our priest. Small steps led up to it, which were used to hold  muscles, stones, shells, and other instruments employed in the sacred  rites. The idols were of metal, and ugly and monstrous, like Chinese  images. Beside these figures, we were astonished to see crosses of various  forms and sizes. We asked the Geber about them, and he answered with  oriental emphasis: \"There is one God, and no one has seen him; therefore  every one adores him after his own way, and represents him after his own  way.\" The reply was diplomatic enough, and we could not ascertain how the  crosses had come there.    On the altar and its steps lay a great number of singularly beautiful  Indian stones, which the boys wanted very much, but which, in spite of our  large offers, we could not obtain. They were mementoes from the distant  fatherland, and possibly they served as sacred ornaments for the little  cell. There were also several censers, lamps, and little silver plates and  salvers. The air was stifling from the fumes of gas, and the heat was like  that of a vapor bath. The priest took from the altar some pieces of red  and white candied sugar, held them, praying, before his idols, sprinkled  them with holy water, and handed them to us on a silver plate.    A second Hindoo now came in, a tall old man, whose name, as he told us,  was Amintaas. He invited us into his cell, which was larger and  differently arranged. In the centre was a large kettle, set in mason-work,  with water in it, and a gas flame burning under it; the altar was in  another apartment beyond, and separated from the first by a low wall or  fence, with a passage through. Another apartment, similarly divided off,  was spread with carpets for sleeping. After we had seen the stones,  shells, and idols, which were richer and more numerous than in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20112"],[0,"Lill's Travels in Santa Claus Land (#7)"],[1,"text and consultation of external sources.    scan 014 line  4: corrected closing double quote to single  scan 014 line 10: corrected \"dooping\" to \"drooping\"  scan 024 line -4: corrected \"after wards\" to \"afterwards\"  scan 032 Illustration caption: corrected closing single quote to double  scan 047 line -6: \"said,\" inferred  scan 047 line -4: \"untie\" inferred  scan 047 line -3: \"honestly,\""]]]
