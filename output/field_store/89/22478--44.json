After the sustained applause had subsided Mr. W. W. Nichols gave a brief  account of the objects for which the American Industrial Commission came  to France. He referred to the impetus which had been given to the whole  idea by M. Damour, the French deputy and leader of the French Commission  which recently visited the United States, and declared that the  representatives of French and American manufacturers and industries  might help mutually in solving the industrial problem which affected the  sister republics. \"Our aim,\" said Mr. Nichols, \"is reciprocity in  personal conduct and co-operation which will lead to the solution of  many minor difficulties. Our possibilities are enormous.\"    Mr. Nichols concluded with an expression of thanks for the welcome which  the Commission had received in France and an acknowledgment of the  services which the American Chamber had rendered both to France and to  the United States.    On Tuesday we visited the school for maimed soldiers in Paris. At this  place the men who are unable to return to the front are taught all  kinds of trades--barbering, soap-making, shoe making, etc.    On Wednesday, September 13th the Commission made a trip to Rouen.    Women in knitting mills there earn four francs daily, working eleven  hours; in the webbing mills they earn five francs daily, working eleven  hours. There are no unions. A great deal of the product had been  marketed in Germany but this market was lost. At Rouen we saw a large  British steamer loaded with soldiers enroute to the front. They saluted  the American flag. The harbor was full of shipping. The boats draw  twenty feet of water.    I met J. M. Belin, a manufacturer of tubes used in flying machines. I  had a very interesting talk with Monsieur Belin. He told me there were  ten thousand German soldiers being killed daily on all the fronts and  that seventy per cent of the iron and coal formerly belonging to France  was now in the hands of the Germans.    On Thursday, September 14th, we left Paris for Limoges, arriving there  at five P.M. We were given a reception by the mayor of the town and the  president of the Chamber of Commerce at the Chamber of Commerce Rooms.  We were driven through the town, across the River Vienne. We saw an  ancient Roman bridge, said to be more than two thousand years old.    [Illustration: Ancient Bridge at Limoges--Built by the Romans Two  Thousand Years Ago and Still in Use.]    Also a very old cathedral. A very interesting sight, which I had seen in  oil paintings, was that of women washing on the banks of the river. The  river was lined for nearly a mile with women all occupied in this useful  way.    Limoges is the center of the porcelain industry in France. Its exports  to the United States are very large. The consul at Limoges was  instructed to do all possible to aid the Commission, and, per contra,  the Consul at Rouen was instructed not to accept any invitations or  recognize the Commission in an official way.    We visited the Martin china works and saw a veritable \"Bull in a china  shop\", that is to say, there was a pair of bullocks hitched to a wagon  going through the warehouse while we were there.    We visited the celebrated Haviland plant at Limoges, and met Geo.  Haviland, who is well known in America. With him we had quite a  discussion regarding the manufacturers at Limoges increasing their  output of low grade wares.    At noon on this day we had a conference with the Chamber of Commerce of  Limoges. At this conference I was permitted to say a few words, which  were translated for the audience as follows:    Gentlemen, I have been criticised by my fellow Commissioners for  not taking part in the discussions. I speak English only, and have  hesitated to enter these arguments. It seems to me, though, that  instead of trying to enter on the increase of your common product,  such as any china manufacturer in the United States can make, you  should increase the production of your high grade product. There  are high grade porcelains made in Austria and a lot of this comes  to us from Germany. Your product is known all over the world--the  name \"Haviland\" is a household word. In my opinion if your  manufacturers here at Limoges went into the production of the  common qualities of porcelain, it would lower your reputation.    My recommendation, therefore, is that if possible you increase the  production of the artistic porcelains.    In the evening a banquet was given us at the Hotel Rue de Lu Paix. On my  right was Eugene L. Belisle, American Consul, and on my left was Leon  Pinton, Vice-president of the Chamber of Commerce.    The banquet table was a beautiful sight. French and American flags were  entwined. Speeches were made by members of the Chamber of Commerce and  responses by Mr. Nichols in broken French. I had a most interesting talk  with Consul Belisle. He said that one year ago the French would have  made a much better settlement of the war than today. They are now better  prepared and would demand the return of territory, including Alsace  Lorraine, the French people being educated up to this point. He said  also that he had come in contact with German prisoners and they were  discouraged and would be glad to surrender.    We met at this banquet General Comby, district commander of the twelfth  regiment.    Dr. Mailloux and Mr. MacArthur had a very interesting talk with General  Comby, Thursday night after the banquet was over. General Comby was in  active service at the front after the opening of the war. He described  to us particularly what he had seen of warfare at the time of the battle  of the Marne. He said it was called the battle of the Marne because of  the lack of any other name to give it, but the battle took place over a  period of some thirty odd days and covered a considerable region, much  of which was far away from the Marne. He informed us that the fresh  troops who have not before experienced the severity of battle go into a  desperate fight with the greatest valor and heroism; that after troops  have seen a long session of fighting, and have been through the  hardships of many engagements they lose, and he thinks it is natural  they should lose, much of the spirit that accompanies them in their  first engagements.    He told us of the very severe losses that were suffered in these first  actions of the war; greater than at any other time. Mr. MacArthur  understood him to regard this so-called Battle of the Marne as perhaps  the bloodiest and most terrible of all battles in history. He informed  us that it was not one single battle, but a succession of almost  continuous struggles, day and night, over a period of three or four  weeks.    General Comby had under his immediate command 18,000 troops, of whom he  lost 13,500 in these engagements. He said, however, that in spite of  all these losses, he had never found himself nor his troops in the  position of defeat; that defeat is largely a matter of sentiment and  valor. An army with comparatively slight losses might consider itself  defeated if it chose to do so. An army of troops like some of those he  had could be cut almost to pieces, and yet, if there was a remnant  sufficient and disposed to come together again, they formed a still  undefeated and effective body.    The general spoke particularly of a battalion of zouaves that he had,  numbering about 1,000, and which was cut down until there were only 280  left. Yet they came together undefeated and effective troops. He said  that since the Battle of the Marne the war has taken on a different  character. He considered the German defeat as taking place at and by  reason of this battle. Had they not been checked then, and turned, there  is no telling what the Germans might have done. But they were checked  and turned, which constituted their defeat, and all operations that have  and are now taking place are simply operations to follow up the victory  that was realized at the Marne.    On Saturday, September 16th, we arrived at Aubusson, the centre of the  tapestry industry of France, as it has been for the past five centuries.    Aubusson is located in a beautiful country. On our way to that city we  noticed women attending sheep, just as we had seen in pictures by  Millet and other painters. These women, with only a dog as companion,  knit as they tend their flocks.    We arrived in Aubusson at 10:30 A.M. We were first taken to the town  hall, where there was a general exhibit of the products of the district  on view. I was greatly impressed with a portrait, in tapestry, of  General Joffre, the great French commander, idolized by the French  people and hero of the Battle of the Marne. It did not occur to me at  the moment of examining this tapestry portrait that it might be  purchased; but afterwards, while we were at luncheon, I thought possibly  it might be bought, and asked Monsieur Damour, who sat next to me, what  he thought about it. He expressed the belief that it was not for sale  and would not be permitted to go out of France. He said, however, that  he would make an investigation, and sent his secretary, who came back in  a very short time with the information that the portrait would be sold  to an American only. The price was named and without any further  negotiations I accepted the offer, making only one condition, that it  was not to be duplicated. I had the portrait taken from its frame and  brought it with me, having it retrained upon my arrival home. It is  certainly a beautiful piece of work, as well as unique; no one but an  expert could tell at first glance that it is not a portrait done in oil.  It was copied by one of the greatest tapestry artists in France from  the oil painting made of General Joffre by a noted French artist.
