But if so, why the question of color? There it was  again! And now, centering all his attention on that one point, the  Terran picked out the outline of a head--a head grotesque enough to be  something conjured out of Lumbrilo's sorcerer's imagination. Had Dane  not seen its like among the tri-dee prints in Captain Jellico's  collection, he would have believed that his eyes were playing tricks.    It was a bullet-shaped head, embellished by two out-sized prick ears,  the hair-tufted pointed tips of which projected well above the top of  the skull. Round eyes were set deeply in sunken pits. The mouth was a  swinish snout from which lolled a purple tongue, though the rest of that  gargoyle head was very close in color to the rock against which it half  rested.    Dane had no doubts that the rock ape was spying upon the small camp.  Having heard tales of those semi-intelligent animals--the most  intelligent native creatures of Khatka--most of which were concerned  with their more malignant characteristics, Dane was alarmed. That lurker  could be an advance scout of some pack. And a pack of rock apes, if able  to surprise their prey, were formidable opponents.    Asaki stirred, sat up. And that round head above turned to follow the  Chief Ranger's every move.    \"Above ... by the finger rock ... to the right....\" Dane kept his voice  close to a whisper. When he saw the sudden constriction of muscle across  the Khatkan's bare shoulders, he knew that the other had heard and  understood.    Only, if Asaki had spotted the rock ape, he did not betray his  knowledge. The Khatkan got lithely to his feet. Then one of those feet  stirred Nymani into the instant wakefulness of the wilderness-trained  man.    Dane slid his hand about the bole of the tree and touched Jellico,  watched the captain's gray eyes open with a similar awareness. Asaki  picked up his needler. Weapon in hand, he whirled and fired almost in  one connected movement. It was the fastest shot Dane had ever seen.    The gargoyle head lifted away from the rock, and then turned to one side  as its body, somehow vaguely obscene in its resemblance to the human  form, fell away, to sprawl limply down-slope.    Though the dead rock ape had not had a chance to give tongue, there came  a cry from above, a coughing, deep-throated hawking. Down the steep  incline bumped a round white ball, bouncing past the tumbled carcass of  the ape, sailing up into the air, to strike and burst open a few feet  away.    \"Back!\" With one arm Asaki sent Jellico, his nearest neighbor, tumbling  back into the jungle. Then the Chief Ranger pumped a stream of needle  rays into the remains of the ball. A shrill, sweet humming arose as red  motes, vivid as molten copper in the sunlight, climbed on wings beating  too fast to be seen.    The debris of the nest smoked into nothing. But no needle ray could hope  to stop all the poisonous army issuing forth from it, fighting mad, to  seek any warm-blooded creature within scenting distance. The men threw  themselves into the brush, rolling in the thick mold of the vegetable  decay on the ground, rubbing its moist plaster over their bodies in  frantic haste.    Red-hot fire, far worse than any of the splinter torment Dane had  undergone the night before, pierced between his shoulders. He rolled on  his back, shoving himself along, both to kill the fire-wasp and coat the  sting with cooling mold. Cries of pain told him that he was not the only  sufferer, as all dug hands into the slimy stuff under them and slapped  it over their faces and heads.    \"Apes....\" That half shout got through to alert the men on the jungle  floor. True to their nature, the rock apes, now streaming downhill, were  coughing their challenges, advertising their attack. And it was only  that peculiarity of their species which saved their intended victims.    The apes came forward, partially erect, at a shambling run. The first  two, bulls close to six feet, went down under fire from Asaki's needler.  A third somehow escaped, swerving to the left, and came bounding at an  angle toward Dane. The Terran jerked free his force blade as that swine  snout split wide to show greenish tusks and the horrible stench of the  creature's body made him gasp.    A taloned paw clawed at him eagerly, slipped from his slime-covered body  just as he brought the force blade up. Foul breath coughed in his face  and he stumbled back as the heavy body of the ape crashed against him,  cut in half by the weapon. To Dane's sickened horror the paws still  clawed for him, the fangs still gnashed as he rolled free of the mangled  body and somehow got to his feet.    The roar of a blaster, of two blasters, drowned out the clamor of the  apes as Dane drew his fire ray, set his shoulders against a tree bole  and prepared to fight it out. He fired, saw a smaller and more nimble  enemy go down screeching. Then there were none left on their shaggy  feet, though some on the ground dragged themselves forward, still  striving to reach the men.    Dane slapped a fire-wasp from his leg. He was glad of the support of the  tree at his back as the smell of the ape's blood drenching him from  chest level down, and the mess on the ground, made his stomach churn.    When he could control his retching, he straightened. To his relief he  saw that all the others were on their feet, apparently unharmed. But  Tau, catching sight of the younger spaceman, gasped and started for him.    \"Dane! What did they do?\"    His junior laughed a little hysterically. \"Not mine....\" He swabbed with  a handful of grass at his bloodied breeches and blundered on into the  sunlight.    Nymani found them a foam-flecked stream below a miniature falls where  the swift current prevented the lurking of sand worms. They stripped  eagerly, cleaning first themselves and then their fouled clothing while  Tau tended the wealth of fire-wasp stings. There was little he could do  to relieve the swelling and pain, until Asaki produced a reed-like plant  which, chopped in sections, yielded a sticky purple liquid that dried on  the skin as a tar gum--the native remedy. So, glued and plastered, they  climbed away from the water and prepared to spend the night in a hollow  between two leaning rocks, certainly not as snug as the cave but a  fortress of sorts.    \"And credit-happy space hoppers pay a fortune for an outing like this!\"  Tau commented bitterly, hunching well forward so that a certain stung  portion of his anatomy would not come in contact with the rock beneath  him.    \"Hardly for this,\" Jellico replied, and Dane saw Nymani grin  one-sidedly, his other cheek puffed and painted sticky purple.    \"We do not always encounter apes and fire-wasps in the same day,\"  supplied the Chief Ranger. \"Also, guests at the preserves wear stass  belts.\"    Jellico snorted. \"I don't think you'd get any repeats from your clients  otherwise! What do we meet tomorrow? A herd of graz on stampede, or  something even more subtle and deadly?\"    Nymani got up and walked a little way from their rock shelter. He turned  down-slope and Dane saw his nostrils expand as they had when he had  investigated the cave.    \"Something is dead,\" he said slowly. \"A very large something. Or else--\"    Asaki strode down to join his men. He gave a curt nod and Nymani skidded  on down the mountain side.    \"What is it?\" Jellico asked.    \"It might be many things. There is one I hope it is not,\" was the Chief  Ranger's somewhat evasive reply. \"I will hunt a labbla--there was fresh  spoor at the stream.\" He set off along their back trail to return a half  hour later, the body of his kill slung across one shoulder. He was  skinning it when Nymani trotted back.    \"Well?\"    \"Death pit,\" supplied the Hunter.    \"Poachers?\" Jellico inquired.    Nymani nodded. Asaki continued his task, but there was a glint in his  dark eyes as he butchered with sure and expert strokes. Then he glanced  at the shadow extending beyond the rocks.    \"I, too, would see,\" he told Nymani.    Jellico arose, and Dane, interested, followed. Some five minutes later  none of them needed the native keenness of smell to detect the presence  of some foulness ahead. The odor of corruption was almost tangible in  the sultry air. And it grew worse until they stood on the edge of a pit.  Dane retreated hurriedly. This was as bad as the battlefield of the rock  apes. But the captain and the two Khatkans stood calmly assessing the  slaughter left by the hide poachers.    \"Glam, graz, hoodra,\" Jellico commented. \"Tusks and hides--the full line  of trade stuff.\"    Asaki, his expression bleak, stepped back from the pit. \"Day old  calves, old ones, females--all together. They kill wantonly and leave  those they do not choose to pelt.\"    \"Trail--\" Nymani pointed eastward. \"Leads to Mygra swamp.\"    \"The swamps!\" Asaki was shaken. \"They must be mad!\"    \"Or know more about this country than your men do,\" Jellico corrected.    \"If poachers can enter Mygra, then we can follow!\"    But not now, Dane protested silently. Certainly Asaki did not mean that  _they_ were to track outlaws into swamps the Khatkan had already labeled  unexplored death traps!          V      Sitting up, Dane stared wide-eyed into the dark. A handful of glowing  coals, guarded by rocks, was the center of their camp. He hunched up to  that hardly knowing why he moved. His hands were shaking, his skin damp  with sweat no heat produced. Yet, now that he was conscious of the  night, the Terran could not remember the nightmare from which he had  just awakened, though he was left with a growing apprehension which he  could not define. What prowled out there in that dark? Walked the  mountain side? Listened, spied and waited?    Dane half started to his feet as a form did move into the dim light of  the fire. Tau stood there, regarding him with sober "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18854"],[0,"The Gourmet's Guide to Europe (#7)"],[1,"ent- and dining-room the Calais buffet deserves to be mentioned.      Boulogne    At Boulogne there is a restaurant in the Casino, but I think it adds  very little to the revenues of the establishment. Most people take their  meals contentedly or discontentedly in their hotels, but the little  restaurant on the pier, which used to belong to the widow Poirmeur but  is now the Restaurant Garnier, with its miniature terrace and its  windows which look out on to the waves when the tide is up, has an  individuality of its own, and is one of the haunts of the gourmet who  enjoys a meal with unusual surroundings. In the winter the little  restaurant hibernates. If customers appear the wife of the proprietor  cooks dinner or lunch for them, and cooks very fairly; but with the  advent of summer a cook is engaged for the season, and it is a matter of  importance to the sojourner in Boulogne whether that cook ranks as  \"fair\" or \"good.\" He generally is good. Fish, of course, is always fresh  at Boulogne and generally excellent in quality, and the shell-fish are  above suspicion--at least I never heard of anybody suffering from eating  _moules_,--therefore a _Sole Normande_ or any similar dish generally  forms part of a _dejeuner_ on the pier, and this with an _entrecote_ and  an _omelette au rhum_ makes a fine solid sea-side feast. The buffet at  the station, since it was taken in hand by the South-Eastern Railway, is  not the dreadful place of ill-cooked food it used to be. At the terminus  of the tramway which runs into the forest a little _cabaret_ gives a  simple meal, and the trip out and back is the pleasantest short  excursion from Boulogne. At Wimille it is wise to inquire what charge  the new hotel proposes to make before sitting down to a meal. Ambleteuse  is another little watering-place to the north on the coast. Here the  mid-day meal at the principal inn is lengthy if nothing else.    Following the coast along, Paris-Plage has not as yet developed any  restaurant of note, and the inn at Etaples, which is the town on the  railway whence the walk or drive to Paris-Plage has to be undertaken, is  more famous for having given shelter to generations of artists, some of  whom have paid their bills with sketches, than for its food, though some  of the best _pre-sale_ mutton in France comes from the fields  over-flowed by the estuary at high tide. A goodly proportion of the  shrimps and prawns one has to pay so highly for as _hors-d'oeuvre_ in  the restaurants of Paris come from Paris-Plage, Le Touquet, and their  neighbour down the coast, Berk. Indeed, if any gourmet has a _penchant_  for shrimps and asses' milk, Berk would be his paradise. Treport  requires no description, but      Dieppe    is a place of importance, and in the days of the Second Empire Lafosse's  Restaurant in the Grande Rue used to be one of the very best dining  places in the provinces of France. Good cooking is now to be looked for  from Cabois, 74 Grande Rue, from Beaufils, Rue de la Barre, and from  Lefebvre, Rue de l'Hotel de Ville. M. Ducordet, the proprietor of the  Grand Hotel, who was the happy man chosen to supply M. Felix Faure with  a banquet when he visited Dieppe, caters for the Casino and the Golf  Club. The Casino restaurant is worthy of all commendation. The buffet at  the Gare Maritime is above the average of buffets in its cookery.    The restaurant of the Hotel Chateau at Puys, a mile and a half from  Dieppe, is owned by Mons. Pelettier of local celebrity, who has  collected an excellent cellar of wine.    At Pourville, two miles from Dieppe, Mons. Gras is responsible for the  entertainment at the Hotel Casino. The restaurant has a special  reputation, made by \"Papa\" Paul Graff, who was formerly one of the many  _chefs de cuisine_ of Napoleon III., and who left the Tuileries to keep  the hotel. The proprietor is very proud of his kitchens and larders, and  is delighted to show them to visitors.      Havre    is one of the towns in which the Englishman or American crossing to  Southampton or coming thence often finds himself for some hours.  Tortoni's in the market-place has a reputation for good cooking, but  judging from the two or three dinners I have eaten there, both _a la  carte_ and the _table-d'hote_ one at 5 francs, the cookery is of the  good solid bourgeois order, eight courses and a pint of wine for one's  money. In days long gone by there used to be this footnote to the _carte  du jour_ at Tortoni's, \"Les hors-d'oeuvres ne se remplacent pas,\"  which was translated for the benefit of the English, \"The out-of-works  do not replace themselves.\" Tortoni's Hotel Restaurant must not be  confounded with the Brasserie Tortoni quite close to it, which is a  bachelor's resort; but which I, as a bachelor, have found very amusing  sometimes after dinner.    Frascati's Restaurant, an adjunct to the big hotel on the sea-shore, is  the \"swagger\" restaurant of the place, and many a man who has come over  by the midnight boat and has stayed for a bathe and a meal at Frascati's  before going on to Paris by the mid-day train has breakfasted there in  content. The _Ecrevisses Bordelaises_, the _Croutes aux Champignons_,  the _Salade Russe_ here have left me pleasant memories. In the winter  the _chef_ retires to Paris or elsewhere, and the restaurant is not to  be so thoroughly trusted; and sometimes when a crowd of passengers are  going across to Southampton by the night boat to catch an American  steamer, I have found the attendance very sketchy, owing to the waiters  having more work than they can do satisfactorily. The restaurant is in  the verandah facing the sea.    So much from my own experience. Other people with larger knowledge all  have a good word to say for Frascati's, but all a word of caution as to  its prices. It is wise to look at the price of the champagnes, for  instance, before giving an order. The official dinners at Havre are  always given at Frascati's, and it is here that the British colony holds  its annual banquet on the King's birthday. I append a menu of a dinner  of ceremony at Frascati's which, though it is miles too long, is a very  noble feast:--             Tortue claire a la Francaise.                 Creme Du Barry.                Rissoles Lucullus.          Caisses de laitances Dieppoise.            Barbues dorees a la Vatel.            Selle de Chevreuil Nemrod.           Poularde du Mans Cambaceres.        Terrines d'Huitres a la Joinville.       Cailles de vigne braisees Parisienne.               Granites a l'Armagnac.            Faisans de Compiegne rotis.               Truffes au Champagne.                Salade Chrysantheme.      Pains de pointes d'Asperges a la Creme.                 Turbans d'Ananas.                  Glace Frascati.                      Dessert.    The Hotel de Normandie is another hostel at which the cooking is good  and the wines excellent. This is a menu of a _table-d'hote diner maigre_  served there on Good Friday, and it is an excellent example of a meal  without meat:--               Bisque d'Ecrevisses.               Reine Christine.           Filets de Soles Normandy.      Nouillettes Napolitaine en Caisse.          Saumon de la Loire Tartare.            Sorbets Supreme Fecamp.      Coquille de Homard a l'Americaine.             Sarcelles sur Canape.               Salade panachee.       Asperges d'Argenteuil Mousseline.            Petits Pois au Sucre.               Glace Quo Vadis.      Petits Fours. Corbeille de Fruits.                   Dessert.    The cooking at the Continental Hotel is reported as being good, but its  wine-list does not meet with so much praise. The Burgundies, red and  white, at the Hotel du Bordeaux are highly praised.    One of my correspondents sends me an account of Perrier's, a little  restaurant, which I give in his own words. \"The quaintest and most  original place in Havre is a little restaurant on the quay, opposite  where the Trouville boats start from. It is known equally well as  'Perier's' or the Restaurant des Pilotes. It is kept by one Buholzer,  who was at one time _chef_ at Rubion's in Marseilles. He afterwards was  _chef_ on one of the big Transatlantique boats, where he learnt to mix a  very fair cocktail. The entrance is through a tiny cafe with sanded  tiled floor. Thence a corkscrew staircase leads to a fair-sized room on  the first floor. All the food you get there is excellent, and  _Bouillabaisse_ or _Homard a l'Americaine_ 'constructed' by the boss, is  a joy, not for ever, but in the case of the first named, for some time.  The house does not go in for a very varied selection of wines, but what  there is is good. Ask for their special roll.\" The same correspondent  goes on to tell me that the proprietor of the Broche a Rotir at  St-Adresse, who used to be his own _chef_, and attained much local  celebrity, has sold the goodwill, but that the place is still to be  commended, and that Bequet of the Restaurant Bequet can, if he likes,  cook the best dinner in the department; but that you must find him in  the mood.    Of cafes in Havre, the Cafe Prader, near the theatre, and the Paris are  the two where the drinkables are sure to be of good quality.      Rouen    At Rouen the gourmet has a right to expect the _Caneton Rouennaise_ and  the _Sole Normande_ to be cooked to perfection; and outside the hotels,  some of which have excellent cooking, there is a restaurant, the  Francais, in the Rue Jacques le Lieur, a street which runs behind the  Hotel d'Angleterre, parallel to the Quai de la Bourse. Of course the  Rouen duck is not any particular breed of duck, though the good people  of Rouen will probably stone you if you assert this. It is simply a roan  duck. The rich sauce which forms part of the dish was, however, invented  at Rouen. The delights of the _Sole Normande_ I need not dilate on. A  good bottle of Burgundy is the best accompaniment to the duck. The  Restaurant de Paris, in the Rue de la Grosse Horloge, is "]]]
