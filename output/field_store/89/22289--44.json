He expresses  his personality to us, and personality in art is a thing incalculable.  Corot's _Arcadia_ landscape delights us because it is the distilled essence  of the vision, heart, and character of the personality called Corot.  Personality may be expressed by a Rembrandt, abundantly. It may also be  expressed by a Velasquez, negatively.    We must be vigilant, in judging a painter, to distinguish between his own  personality and the personality of those who interpret him to us. The more  we give of ourselves to a painter or an author, the greater is the return  of his appeal and interest. Cleave the wood of your brain and you find him  brimming with communications, raise the stone of your imagination and he is  revealed.    A certain critic, who had devoted his life to the study of Reynolds, while  lecturing upon the achievement of that master, threw upon the screen a  certain large subject-picture, not one of Reynold's happiest efforts, but a  laboured and unattractive design which, we know, gave Reynolds an infinity  of trouble.    So scientific, so interesting was this critic's analysis of the picture, so  absorbing the attributes he read into it, that many of his audience were  persuaded that they were looking upon a Reynolds masterpiece, whereas they  were but hypnotised by the subtleties of the critic's mind working upon  Reynolds.    Conversely the criticism of some writers tends towards depreciation because  of their predilection for objective as opposed to subjective criticism. The  late P.G. Hamerton, writing upon Rembrandt, says, \"The chiaroscuro of  Rembrandt is often false and inconsistent, and in fact he relied largely on  public ignorance. But though arbitrary, it is always conducive to his  purpose.\"    \"Conducive to his purpose!\" There is much virtue in those four words.  Rembrandt probably knew as well as anybody that his lighting of a picture  was not a facsimile of the lighting of nature, or rather not the  chiaroscuro as seen by the average eye; but he had an aim, a vision before  him, and he did not hesitate to interpret that vision in his own way. Who  dares to say that Rembrandt was disloyal to nature? Our concern is not what  we should have done, but what Rembrandt did, seeing with his own eyes. And  the questions we should ask ourselves are:--Is the interpretation of the  world as seen through his eyes beautiful, suggestive, profound, and  stimulating? Does the statement of his personality in paint add to our  knowledge, educate our aesthetic perceptions, and extend our horizon by  showing us things that our imperfect vision does not see except through  him?    [Illustration: A YOUNG WOMAN IN A RED CHAIR HOLDING A PINK IN HER RIGHT  HAND    1656. The Hermitage, St. Petersburg.]    Comparisons are not only odious, but foolish. No sensible critic attempts a  comparison between Titian, Velasquez, and Rembrandt. He accepts them as  they are, and is grateful. But even the most obscure of mortals may have  his preferences, and a curious chapter in the lives of individuals who  have concerned themselves with painting would be the bewildering way in  which the pendulum of their appreciation and admiration has swung backwards  and forwards from Titian to Velasquez, from Velasquez to Rembrandt, and  sometimes back to Titian. It is often a question of mood.    There are moods when the regal abundance, the consummate craftsmanship of  Titian, the glow and splendour of his canvases, the range of them from _The  Man with the Glove_ in the Louvre to the _Bacchus and Ariadne_, force us to  place him on the summit of Parnassus. We are dazzled by this prince of  painters, dominating Venice at the height of her prosperity, inspired by  her, having around him, day by day, the glorious pictures that the genius  of Venice had produced. We follow his triumphant career, see him courted  and feted, recognise his detachment from the sorrow and suffering of the  unfortunate and unclassed, and amid the splendour of his career note his  avidity for the loaves and fishes of the world. Unlike Rembrandt, fortune  favoured Titian to the end. His career was a triumphal progress. We stand  in that small room at the Prado Museum at Madrid and gaze upon his  canvases, sumptuous and opulent, diffusing colour like a sunset,  indifferent to their story or meaning, happy and content with the flaming  feast outspread for our enjoyment. We stand before his _Entombment_ at the  Louvre, dumb before its superlative painting, with hardly a thought for the  tragedy that it represents. Titian accepts the literary motive, and the  artist in him straight forgets it. We walk from _The Entombment_ to the  little chamber where Rembrandt's _Christ at Emmaus_ hangs, and the heart of  Rembrandt is beating there. To Titian the glory of the world, to Rembrandt  all that man has felt and suffered, parting and sorrow, and the awakening  of joy. We do not compare the one painter with the other; we say: \"This is  Titian, that is Rembrandt; each gives us his emotion.\" Foolish indeed it  seems in the face of these two pictures, and a thousand others, to say that  art should be this or that,--that a picture should or should not have a  literary or a philosophical motive. Painters give us themselves. We amuse  ourselves by placing them in schools, by analysing their achievement, by  scientific explanations of what they did just by instinct, as lambs  gambol--and behind all stands the Sphinx called Personality.    There are moods when the appeal of Velasquez is irresistible. Grave and  reticent, a craftsman miraculously equipped, detached, but not with the  Jovian detachment of Titian, this Spanish gentleman stalks silently across  the art stage. Hundreds of drawings of Rembrandt's exhibit evidence of the  infinite extent of his experiments after perfection. The drawings of  Velasquez can be counted on the fingers of one hand. He drew in paint upon  the canvas. From his portraits and pictures we gather not the faintest idea  of what he felt, what he thought, what he believed. One thing we know  absolutely--that he saw as keenly and as searchingly as any painter who has  ever lived. What he saw before him he could paint, and in the doing of it  he was unrivalled. His hand followed and obeyed his eye. When the object  was not before him, he falls short of his superlative standard. The figures  of Philip IV., of Olivares, and of Prince Baltazar Carlos in the three  great equestrian portraits are as finely drawn as man could make them.  Velasquez saw them; he did not see the prancing horses which they ride,  consequently our eyes dropping from the consummate figures are disappointed  at the conventional attitudes of the steeds. Velasquez, like Titian, moved  from success to success; both were friends of kings, both basked in royal  favour, neither had the disadvantage, or perhaps the great advantage, like  Rembrandt, of the education of adversity. Velasquez made two journeys into  Italy; he knew what men had accomplished in painting, and if he was not  largely influenced by Titian and Tintoretto, their work showed him what man  had done, what man could do, and indicated to him his own dormant powers.    Rembrandt was sufficient unto himself. There are moods when one is sure  that he stands at the head of the painting hierarchy. In spite of his  greatness, we feel that he is very near to our comprehension. What a  picture of the old painter towards the end of his life that saying of  Baldinucci presents. We are told that near the close of his career,  absorbed in his art, indifferent to the world, \"when he was painting at his  easel he had come to wipe his brushes on the hinder portions of his dress.\"    Rembrandt looms out like some amorphous boulder, stationary,  lichen-stained, gathering time unto itself. He travelled so little that it  can be said he was untravelled. The works of other painters affected him  not at all. We are without proof that he was even interested in the work of  his contemporaries or predecessors. Life was his passion. One model was as  good as another. He looked at life, and life fired his imaginations. He  painted himself fifty times; he painted his friends, his relations, and the  people he met while prowling about the streets. His pencil was never idle.  Imagination, which confuses the judgment of so many, aided him, for his  imagination was not nourished by vanity, or the desire to produce an  effect, but flowed from the greatness of his brooding heart. He stood alone  during his life, an absorbed man, uninfluenced by any school; he stands  alone to-day. The world about him, and his thoughts and reflections, were  his only influences. He read few books, and the chief among them was the  Bible. Mr. Berenson has written an exhaustive and learned work on Lorenzo  Lotto, analysing his pictures year by year, and exhuming the various  painters who influenced Lotto at the different periods of his life. Mr.  Berenson's book extends to nearly three hundred pages. The influences of  the painting fraternity upon Rembrandt would not provide material for the  first paragraph of the first page of such a book.    His fame is assured. He is one of the great triumvirate. \"He was greater,  perhaps,\" says Mr. Clausen, \"than any other painter in human feeling and  sympathy, in dramatic sense and invention; and his imagination seemed  inexhaustible.\"    The Ryks Museum at Amsterdam may be said to have been designed as a shrine  for his _Night Watch_. Near by it hangs _The Syndics of the Cloth Company_,  excelled, in this particular class of work, by no picture in the world; but  it is by the portraits and the etchings that the sweep, profundity, and  versatility of Rembrandt's genius is exemplified. Truly his imagination was  inexhaustible.    It is an education to stand before his portraits in the National Gallery.

Secondly, notice how great, good, and holy a work is here assigned  children, which is alas! utterly neglected and disregarded, and no one  perceives that God has commanded it or that it is a holy, divine Word  and doctrine. For if it had been regarded as such, every one could have  inferred that they must be holy men who live according to these words.  Thus there would have been no need of inventing monasticism nor  spiritual orders, but every child would have abided by this  commandment, and could have directed his conscience to God and said:  \"If I am to do good and holy works, I know of none better than to  render all honor and obedience to my parents, because God has Himself  commanded it. For what God commands must be much and far nobler than  everything that we may devise ourselves, and since there is no higher  or better teacher to be found than God, there can be no better  doctrine, indeed, than He gives forth. Now, He teaches fully what we  should do if we wish to perform truly good works, and by commanding  them, He shows that they please Him. If, then, it is God who commands  this, and who knows not how to appoint anything better, I will never  improve upon it.\"    Behold, in this manner we would have had a godly child properly  taught, reared in true blessedness, and kept at home in obedience to  his parents and in their service, so that men should have had blessing  and joy from the spectacle. However, God's commandment was not  permitted to be thus [with such care and diligence] commended, but had  to be neglected and trampled under foot, so that a child could not lay  it to heart, and meanwhile gaped [like a panting wolf] at the devices  which we set up, without once [consulting or] giving reverence to God.    Let us, therefore, learn at last, for God's sake, that, placing all  other things out of sight, our youths look first to this commandment,  if they wish to serve God with truly good works, that they do what is  pleasing to their fathers and mothers, or to those to whom they may be  subject in their stead. For every child that knows and does this has,  in the first place, this great consolation in his heart that he can  joyfully say and boast (in spite of and against all who are occupied  with works of their own choice): \"Behold, this work is well pleasing to  my God in heaven that I know for certain.\" Let them all come together  with their many great, distressing, and difficult works and make their  boast, we will see whether they can show one that is greater and  nobler than obedience to father and mother, to whom God has appointed  and commanded obedience next to His own majesty; so that if God's Word  and will are in force and being accomplished nothing shall be esteemed  higher than the will and word of parents; yet so that it, too, is  subordinated to obedience toward God and is not opposed to the  preceding commandments.    Therefore you should be heartily glad and thank God that He has chosen  you and made you worthy to do a work so precious and pleasing to Him.  Only see that, although it be regarded as the most humble and despised  you esteem it great and precious, not on account of our worthiness, but  because it is comprehended in, and controlled by, the jewel and  sanctuary, namely, the Word and commandment of God. Oh, what a high  price would all; Carthusians, monks, and nuns pay, if in all their  religious doings they could bring into God's presence a single work  done by virtue of His commandment, and be able before His face to say  with joyful heart: \"Now I know that this work is well pleasing to  Thee.\" Where will these poor wretched persons hide when in the sight of  God and all the world they shall blush with shame before a young child  who has lived according to this commandment, and shall have to confess  that with their whole life they are not worthy to give it a drink of  water? And it serves them right for their devilish perversion in  treading God's commandment under foot that they must vainly torment  themselves with works of their own device, and, in addition, have scorn  and loss for their reward.    Should not the heart, then, leap and melt for joy when going to work  and doing what is commanded, saying: Lo, this is better than all  holiness of the Carthusians, even though they kill themselves fasting  and praying upon their knees without ceasing? For here you have a sure  text and a divine testimony that He has enjoined this, but concerning  the other He did not command a word. But this is the plight and  miserable blindness of the world that no one believes these things; to  such an extent the devil has deceived us with false holiness and the  glamour of our own works.    Therefore I would be very glad (I say it again) if men would open  their eyes and ears and take this to heart, lest some time we may  again be led astray from the pure Word of God to the lying vanities of  the devil. Then, too, all would be well; for parents would have more  joy, love, friendship, and concord in their houses; thus the children  could captivate their parents' hearts. On the other hand, when they are  obstinate, and will not do what they ought until a rod is laid upon  their back, they anger both God and their parents, whereby they deprive  themselves of this treasure and joy of conscience and lay up for  themselves only misfortune. Therefore, as every one complains, the  course of the world now is such that both young and old are altogether  dissolute and beyond control, have no reverence nor sense of honor, do  nothing except as they are driven to it by blows, and perpetrate what  wrong and detraction they can behind each other's back; therefore God  also punishes them, that they sink into all kinds of filth and misery.  As a rule, the parents, too, are themselves stupid and ignorant; one  fool trains [teaches] another, and as they have lived, so live their  children after them.     This, now, I say should be the first and most important consideration  to urge us to the observance of this commandment; on which account,  even if we had no father and mother we ought to wish that God would set  up wood and stone before Us, whom we might call father and mother. How  much more, since He has given us living parents, should we rejoice to  show them honor and obedience, because we know it is so highly pleasing  to the Divine Majesty and to all angels, and vexes all devils, and is,  besides, the highest work which we can do, after the sublime divine  worship comprehended in the previous commandments, so that giving of  alms and every other good work toward our neighbor are not equal to  this. For God has assigned this estate the highest place, yea, has set  it up in His own stead, upon earth. This will and pleasure of God ought  to be a sufficient reason and incentive to us to do what we can with  good will and pleasure.    Besides this, it is our duty before the world to be grateful for  benefits and every good which we have of our parents. But here again  the devil rules in the world, so that the children forget their  parents, as we all forget God, and no one considers how God nourishes,  protects, and defends us, and bestows so much good on body and soul;  especially when an evil hour comes we are angry and grumble with  impatience and all the good which we have received throughout our life  is wiped out [from our memory]. Just so we do also with our parents,  and there is no child that understands and considers this [what the  parents have endured while nourishing and fostering him], except the  Holy Ghost grant him this grace.    God knows very well this perverseness of the world; therefore He  admonishes and urges by commandments that every one consider what his  parents have done for him and he will find that he has from them body  and life, moreover, that he has been fed and reared when otherwise he  would have perished a hundred times in his own filth. Therefore it is a  true and good saying of old and wise men: Deo, parentibus et magistris  non potest satis gratiae rependi, that is, To God, to parents, and to  teachers we can never render sufficient gratitude and compensation. He  that regards and considers this will indeed without compulsion do all  honor to his parents, and bear them up on his hands as those through  whom God has done him all good.    Over and above all this, another great reason that should incite us the  more [to obedience to this commandment] is that God attaches to this  commandment a temporal promise and says: That thou mayest live long  upon the land which the Lord, thy God, giveth thee.    Here you can see yourself how much God is in earnest in respect to this  commandment, inasmuch as He not only declares that it is well pleasing  to Him, and that He has joy and delight therein; but also that it shall  be for our prosperity and promote our highest good; so that we may have  a pleasant and agreeable life, furnished with every good thing.  Therefore also St. Paul greatly emphasizes the same and rejoices in it  when he says, Eph. 6, 2. 3: This is the first commandment with promise:  That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth.  For although the rest also have their promises contained in them, yet  in none is it so plainly and explicitly stated.    Here, then, you have the fruit and the reward, that whoever observes  this commandment shall have happy days, fortune, and prosperity; and on  the other hand, the punishment, that whoever is disobedient shall the  sooner perish, and never enjoy life. For to have long life in the sense  of the Scriptures is not only to become old, but to have everything  which belongs to long life, such as health, wife, and children,  livelihood, peace, good government, etc., without which this life can  neither be enjoyed in cheerfulness nor long "]]]
