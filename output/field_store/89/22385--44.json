EXPERIMENT.    If the water contain a minute portion of iron, a quantity of it equal to  one of the three preceding portions, must be taken and mixed with a  solution of benzoate of ammonia. The precipitate being washed, dried,  and exposed to a red heat, and weighed, nine-tenths of its weight  indicate the weight of protoxide of iron contained in the water.    In this manner the quantity of all the substances contained in the water  will be ascertained, except there be any soda. To know the amount of it,  the following method, pointed out by Dr. Murray, answers very well.      EXPERIMENT.    Evaporate a portion of the water to one third of its bulk. Precipitate  the carbonic and sulphuric acids by the addition of muriate of barytes,  taking care not to add any excess of the tests.    Precipitate the lime by oxalate of ammonia, and the magnesia by  carbonate of ammonia and phosphoric acid. (Page 52.) Then evaporate the  liquid thus treated to dryness. A quantity of common salt will remain:  let this be exposed to a red heat; 0.4 of its weight indicate the sodium  contained in the bulk of water employed; and 0.4 sodium are equivalent  to 0.53 of soda.    It seems hardly requisite to mention some other substances that  occasionally make their appearance in the waters used for domestic  purposes. A fine divided sand is a common constituent, which is easily  obtained in a separate state. We have only to evaporate a portion of the  water to dryness, and redissolve the saline residue in distilled water.  The silicious sand remains undissolved, and betrays itself by its  insolubility in acids, and its easy fusibility into a transparant glass,  with soda, before the blow-pipe.      DELETERIOUS EFFECTS OF KEEPING WATER FOR DOMESTIC ECONOMY IN LEADEN  RESERVOIRS.    The deleterious effect of lead, when taken into the stomach, is at  present so universally known, that it is quite unnecessary to adduce  any argument in proof of its dangerous tendency.    The ancients were, upwards of 2000 years ago, as well aware of the  pernicious quality of this metal as we are at the present day; and  indeed they appeared to have been much more apprehensive of its effects,  and scrupulous in the application of it to purposes of domestic economy.    Their precautions may have been occasionally carried to an unnecessary  length. This was the natural consequence of the imperfect state of  experimental knowledge at that period. When men were unable to detect  the poisonous matters--to be over scrupulous in the use of such water,  was an error on the right side.    The moderns, on the other hand, in part, perhaps, from an ill-founded  confidence, and inattention to a careful and continued examination of  its effects, have fallen into an opposite error.    There can be no doubt that the mode of preserving water intended for  food or drink in leaden reservoirs, is exceedingly improper; and  although pure water exercises no sensible action upon metallic lead,  provided air be excluded, the metal is certainly acted on by the water  when air is admitted: this effect is so obvious, that it cannot escape  the notice of the least attentive observer.    The white line which may be seen at the surface of the water preserved  in leaden cisterns, where the metal touches the water and where the air  is admitted, is a carbonate of lead, formed at the expense of the metal.  This substance, when taken into the stomach, is highly deleterious to  health. This was the reason which induced the ancients to condemn leaden  pipes for the conveyance of water; it having been remarked that persons  who swallowed the sediment of such water, became affected with disorders  of the bowels.[18]    Leaden water reservoirs were condemned in ancient times by Hyppocrates,  Galen, and Vitruvius, as dangerous: in addition to which, we may depend  on the observations of Van Swieten, Tronchin, and others, who have  quoted numerous unhappy examples of whole families poisoned by water  which had remained in reservoirs of lead. Dr. Johnston, Dr. Percival,  Sir George Baker, and Dr. Lamb, have likewise recorded numerous  instances where dangerous diseases ensued from the use of water  impregnated with lead.    Different potable waters have unequal solvent powers on this metal. In  some places the use of leaden pumps has been discontinued, from the  expense entailed upon the proprietors by the constant want of repair.  Dr. Lamb[19] states an instance where the proprietor of a well ordered  his plumber to make the lead of a pump of double the thickness of the  metal usually employed for pumps, to save the charge of repairs; because  he had observed that the water was so hard, as he called it, that it  corroded the lead very soon.    The following instance is related by Sir George Baker:[20]    \"A gentleman was the father of a numerous offspring, having had  one-and-twenty children, of whom eight died young, and thirteen survived  their parents. During their infancy, and indeed _until they had quitted  the place of their usual residence, they were all remarkably unhealthy_;  being particularly subject to disorders of the stomach and bowels. The  father, during many years, was paralytic; the mother, for a long time,  was subject to colics and bilious obstructions.    \"After the death of the parents, the family sold the house which they  had so long inhabited. The purchaser found it necessary to repair the  pump. This was made of lead; which, upon examination was found to be so  corroded, that several perforations were observed in the cylinder, in  which the bucket plays; and the cistern in the upper part was reduced to  the thinness of common brown paper, and was full of holes, like a  sieve.\"    I have myself seen numerous instances where leaden cisterns have been  completely corroded by the action of water with which they were in  contact: and there is, perhaps, not a plumber who cannot give testimony  of having experienced numerous similar instances in the practice of his  trade.    I have been frequently called upon to examine leaden cisterns, which had  become leaky on account of the action of the water which they contained;  and I could adduce an instance of a legal controversy having taken place  to settle the disputes between the proprietors of an estate and a  plumber, originating from a similar cause--the plumber being accused of  having furnished a faulty reservoir; whereas the case was proved to be  owing to the chemical action of the water on the lead. Water containing  a large quantity of common air and carbonic acid gas, always acts very  sensibly on metallic lead.    Water, which has no sensible action, in its natural state, upon lead,  may acquire the capability of acting on it by heterogeneous matter,  which it may accidentally receive. Numerous instances have shewn that  vegetable matter, such as leaves, falling into leaden cisterns filled  with water, imparted to the water a considerable solvent power of action  on the lead, which, in its natural state it did not possess. Hence the  necessity of keeping leaden cisterns clean; and this is the more  necessary, as their situations expose them to accidental impurities. The  noted saturnine colic of Amsterdam, described by Tronchin, originated  from such a circumstance; as also the case related by Van Swieten,[21]  of a whole family afflicted with the same complaint, from such a  cistern. And it is highly probable that the case of disease recorded by  Dr. Duncan,[22] proceeded more from some foulness in the cistern, than  from the solvent power of the water. In this instance the officers of  the packet boat used water for their drink and cooking out of a leaden  cistern, whilst the sailors used the water taken from the same source,  except that theirs was kept in wooden vessels. The consequence was, that  all the officers were seized with the colic, and all the men continued  healthy.    The carelessness of the bulk of mankind, Dr. Lambe very justly observes,  to these things, \"is so great, that to repeat them again and again  cannot be wholly useless.\"    Although the great majority of persons who daily use water kept in  leaden cisterns receive no sensible injury, yet the apparent salubrity  must be ascribed to the great slowness of its operation, and the  minuteness of the dose taken, the effects of which become modified by  different causes and different constitutions, and according to the  predisposition to diseases inherent in different individuals. The  supposed security of the multitude who use the water with impunity,  amounts to no more than presumption, in favour of any individual, which  may or may not be confirmed by experience.    Independent of the morbid susceptibility of impressions which  distinguish certain habits, there is, besides, much variety in the  original constitution of the human frame, of which we are totally  ignorant.    \"The susceptibility or proneness to disease of each individual, must be  esteemed peculiar to himself. Confiding to the experience of others is a  ground of security which may prove fallacious; and the danger can with  certainty be obviated only by avoiding its source. And considering the  various and complicated changes of the human frame, under different  circumstances and at different ages, it is neither impossible nor  improbable that the substances taken into the system at one period, and  even for a series of years, with apparent impunity may, notwithstanding,  at another period, be eventually the occasion of disease and of death.    \"The experience of a single person, or of many persons, however  numerous, is quite incompetent to the decision of a question of this  nature.    \"The pernicious effects of an intemperate use of spiritous liquors is  not less certain because we often see habitual drunkards enjoy a state  of good"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19036"],[0,"Germany and the Germans from an American Point of View (#7)"],[1,"exploitation. Of Frederick's wars against Austria, against  France, Russia, Saxony, Sweden, and Poland; of his victories at  Prague, Leuthen, Rossbach, and Zorndorf; of his addition of Siberia  and Polish Prussia to his kingdom; of his comical literary love affair  with Voltaire; of his brutal comments upon the reigning ladies of  Russia and France, which brought upon him their bitter hatred; of his  restoration and improvement of his country; of his strict personal  economy and loyalty to his own people, scores of volumes have been  written. The hero-worshipper, Carlyle, and the Jove of reviewers,  Macaulay, have described him, and many minor scribes besides.    It is said of his victory of Rossbach, in 1757, that then and there  began the recreation of Germany, the revival of her political and  intellectual life, and union under Prussia and Prussian kings.  Frederick the Great deserves this particular encomium; for as Luther  freed Germany, and all Christendom indeed, from the tyranny of  tradition, as Lessing freed us from the tyranny of the letter, from  the second-hand and half-baked Hellenism of a Racine and a Corneille,  so Frederick the Great freed his countrymen at last from the puerile  slavery to French fashions and traditions, which had made them self-  conscious at home and ridiculous abroad. He first made a Prussian  proud to be a Prussian.    This last quarter of the eighteenth century in Germany saw the death  of Lessing in 1781, the publication of Kant's \"Kritik der Reinen  Vernunft\" in the same year, and the death of the great Frederick in  1786. These names mark the physical and intellectual coming of age of  Germany. Lessing died misunderstood and feared by the card-board  literary leaders of his day, men who still wrote and thought with the  geometrical instruments handed them from France; Kant attempted to  push philosophical inquiry beyond the bounds of human experience, and  Frederick left Prussia at last not ashamed to be Prussia. Napoleon was  eighteen years old when Frederick died, and he, next to Bismarck, did  more to bring about German unity than any other single force.  Unsuccessful Charlemagne though he was, he without knowing it blazed  the political path which led to the crowning of a German emperor in  the palace at Versailles, less than a hundred years after the death of  Frederick the Great. In 1797 at Montebello, Napoleon said: \"If the  Germanic System did not exist, it would be necessary to create it  expressly for the convenience of France.\"        II FREDERICK THE GREAT TO BISMARCK      Frederick the Great died in 1786, leaving Prussia the most  formidable military power on the Continent. In financial, law, and  educational matters he had made his influence felt for good. He  distributed work-horses and seed to his impoverished nobles; he  encouraged silk, cotton, and porcelain industries; he built the Finow,  the Planesche, and Bromberger Canals; he placed a tariff on meat,  except pork, the habitual food of the poor, and spirits and tobacco  and coffee were added to the salt monopoly; he codified the laws,  which we shall mention later; he aided the common schools, and in his  day were built the opera-house, library, and university in Berlin, and  the new palace of Sans Souci at Potsdam.    Almost exactly one hundred years after the death of Frederick the  Great, there ended practically, at the death of the Emperor William I,  in 1888, the political career of the man, who with his personally  manufactured cement of blood and iron, bound Germany together into a  nation. The middle of the seventeenth, the middle of the eighteenth,  and the middle of the nineteenth centuries, with the Great Elector,  Frederick the Great, and Bismarck as the central figures, mark the  features of the historical landscape of Germany as with mile-stones.    How difficult was the task to bring at last an emperor of all Germany  to his crowning at Versailles, January 18, 1871, and how mighty the  artificer who accomplished the work, may be learned from a glance at  the political, geographical, and patriotic incoherence of the land  that is now the German Empire.    Germany had no definite national policy from the death of Frederick  the Great till the reign of Bismarck began in 1862. Hazy discussions  of a confederation of princes, of a Prussian empire, of lines of  demarcation, of acquisitions of German territory, were the phantoms of  a policy, and even these were due to the pressure of Prussia.    The general political torpidity is surprisingly displayed, when one  remembers that Goethe (1749-1832), who lived through the French  Revolution, who was thirty-seven years old when Frederick the Great  died, and who lived through the whole flaming life of Napoleon, was  scarcely more stirred by the political features of the time than  though he had lived in Seringapatam. He was a superlatively great man,  but he was as parochial in his politics as he was amateurish in his  science, as he was a mixture of the coxcomb and the boor, in his love  affairs. Lessing, who died in 1781, Klopstock, who died in 1803,  Schiller, who died in 1805, Kant, who died in 1804, Hegel, who died in  1831, Fichte, who died in 1814, Wolf, who died in 1824, \"Jean Paul\"  Friedrich Richter, who died in 1825, Voss, who died in 1826,  Schelling, who died in 1854, the two Schlegels, August Wilhelm and  Frederick, who died in 1845 and in 1829, Jacob Grimm, who died in  1863, Herder, Wieland, Kotzebue, what a list of names! What a  blossoming of literary activity! But no one of them, these the leaders  of thought in Germany, at the time when the world was approaching the  birthday of democracy through pain and blood, no one of these was  especially interested in politics.    There was theoretical writing about freedom. Heine mocked at his  countrymen and at the world in general, and deified Napoleon, from his  French mattress, on which he died, in 1856, only fifty-seven years  old. Fichte ended a course of lectures on Duty, with the words: \"This  course of lectures is suspended till the end of the campaign. We shall  resume if our country become free, or we shall have died to regain our  liberty.\" But Fichte neither resumed nor died! Herder criticised his  countrymen for their slavish following of French forms and models in  their literature, as in their art and social life. And well he might  thus criticise, when one remembers how cramped was the literary vision  even of such men as Voltaire and Heine. We have already mentioned some  of Voltaire's literary judgments in the preceding chapter, and Heine  ventured to compare Racine to Euripides! No wonder that Germany needed  schooling in taste, if such were the opinions of her advisers. Such  literary canons as these could only be accepted by minds long inured  to provincial, literary, and social slavery.    Just as every little princeling of those days in Germany took Louis  XIV for his model, so every literary fledgling looked upon Voltaire as  a god, and modelled his style upon the stiff and pompous verses of the  French literary men of that time.    Not even to-day has Germany escaped from this bondage. In Baden three  words out of ten that you hear are French, and the German wherever he  lives in Germany still invites you to Mittagessen at eight P. M.  because he has no word in his own language for diner, and must still  say anstaendiger or gebildeter Mensch for gentleman. To make the German  even a German in speech and ideals and in independence has been a  colossal task. One wonders, as one pokes about in odd corners of  Germany even now, whether Herder's caustic contempt, and Bismarck's  cavalry boots, have made every German proud to be a German, as now he  surely ought to be. The tribal feeling still exists there.    Fichte's lectures on Nationality were suppressed and Fichte himself  looked upon askance. The Schlegels spent a lifetime in giving Germany  a translation of Shakespeare. Hegel wrote the last words of his  philosophy to the sound of the guns at the battle of Jena. Goethe  writes a paragraph about his meeting with Napoleon. Metternich, born  three years before the American Revolution, and who died a year before  the battle of Bull Run, declared: \"The cause of all the trouble is the  attempt of a small faction to introduce the sovereignty of the people  under the guise of a representative system.\"    If this was the attitude of the intellectual nobility of the time,  what are we to suppose that Messrs. Muller and Schultze and Fischer  and Kruger, the small shop-keepers and others of their ilk, and their  friends thought? Even forty years later Friedrich Hebbel, in 1844,  paid a visit to the Industrial Exposition in Paris. He writes in his  diary: \"Alle diese Dinge sind mir nicht allein gleichgueltig; sic sind  mir widerwaertig.\" Germany had not awakened even then to any wide  popular interest in the world that was doing things. As Voltaire  phrased it, France ruled the land, England the sea, and Germany the  clouds, even as late as the middle of the nineteenth century. This is  the more worth noting, as giving a peg upon which to hang Germany's  astounding progress since that time. Even as late as Bismarck's day he  complained of the German: \"It is as a Prussian, a Hanoverian, a  Wuertemberger, a Bavarian, or a Hessian, rather than as a German, that  he is disposed to give unequivocal proof of patriotism.\" The present  ambitious German Emperor said, in 1899, at Hamburg: \"The sluggishness  shown by the German people in interesting themselves in the great  questions moving the world, and in arriving at a political  understanding of those questions, has caused me deep anxiety.\" What  kind of material had the nation-makers to work with! What a long,  disappointing task it must have been to light these people into a  blaze of patriotism!
