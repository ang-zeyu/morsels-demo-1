Somehow I'll bet there's goin' to be hell.\"  Beyond the  store were some rather pretty and comfortable homes, little ranch  houses back in the coves of the hills.  The road turned west and Jean  saw his first sunset in the Tonto Basin.  It was a pageant of purple  clouds with silver edges, and background of deep rich gold.  Presently  Jean met a lad driving a cow.  \"Hello, Johnny!\" he said, genially, and  with a double purpose.  \"My name's Jean Isbel.  By Golly! I'm lost in  Grass Valley.  Will you tell me where my dad lives?\"    \"Yep.  Keep right on, an' y'u cain't miss him,\" replied the lad, with a  bright smile.  \"He's lookin' fer y'u.\"    \"How do you know, boy?\" queried Jean, warmed by that smile.    \"Aw, I know.  It's all over the valley thet y'u'd ride in ter-day.  Shore I wus the one thet tole yer dad an' he give me a dollar.\"    \"Was he glad to hear it?\" asked Jean, with a queer sensation in his  throat.    \"Wal, he plumb was.\"    \"An' who told you I was goin' to ride in to-day?\"    \"I heerd it at the store,\" replied the lad, with an air of confidence.  \"Some sheepmen was talkin' to Greaves.  He's the storekeeper.  I was  settin' outside, but I heerd.  A Mexican come down off the Rim ter-day  an' he fetched the news.\"  Here the lad looked furtively around, then  whispered.  \"An' thet greaser was sent by somebody.  I never heerd no  more, but them sheepmen looked pretty plumb sour.  An' one of them,  comin' out, give me a kick, darn him.  It shore is the luckedest day  fer us cowmen.\"    \"How's that, Johnny?\"    \"Wal, that's shore a big fight comin' to Grass Valley.  My dad says so  an' he rides fer yer dad.  An' if it comes now y'u'll be heah.\"    \"Ahuh!\" laughed Jean.  \"An' what then, boy?\"    The lad turned bright eyes upward.  \"Aw, now, yu'all cain't come thet  on me.  Ain't y'u an Injun, Jean Isbel?  Ain't y'u a hoss tracker thet  rustlers cain't fool?  Ain't y'u a plumb dead shot?  Ain't y'u wuss'ern  a grizzly bear in a rough-an'-tumble? ... Now ain't y'u, shore?\"    Jean bade the flattering lad a rather sober good day and rode on his  way.  Manifestly a reputation somewhat difficult to live up to had  preceded his entry into Grass Valley.    Jean's first sight of his future home thrilled him through.  It was a  big, low, rambling log structure standing well out from a wooded knoll  at the edge of the valley.  Corrals and barns and sheds lay off at the  back.  To the fore stretched broad pastures where numberless cattle and  horses grazed.  At sunset the scene was one of rich color. Prosperity  and abundance and peace seemed attendant upon that ranch; lusty voices  of burros braying and cows bawling seemed welcoming Jean. A hound  bayed.  The first cool touch of wind fanned Jean's cheek and brought a  fragrance of wood smoke and frying ham.    Horses in the Pasture romped to the fence and whistled at these  newcomers.  Jean espied a white-faced black horse that gladdened his  sight.  \"Hello, Whiteface!  I'll sure straddle you,\" called Jean. Then  up the gentle slope he saw the tall figure of his father--the same as  he had seen him thousands of times, bareheaded, shirt sleeved, striding  with long step.  Jean waved and called to him.    \"Hi, You Prodigal!\" came the answer.  Yes, the voice of his father--and  Jean's boyhood memories flashed.  He hurried his horse those last few  rods.  No--dad was not the same.  His hair shone gray.    \"Here I am, dad,\" called Jean, and then he was dismounting.  A deep,  quiet emotion settled over him, stilling the hurry, the eagerness, the  pang in his breast.    \"Son, I shore am glad to see you,\" said his father, and wrung his hand.  \"Wal, wal, the size of you!  Shore you've grown, any how you favor your  mother.\"    Jean felt in the iron clasp of hand, in the uplifting of the handsome  head, in the strong, fine light of piercing eyes that there was no  difference in the spirit of his father.  But the old smile could not  hide lines and shades strange to Jean.    \"Dad, I'm as glad as you,\" replied Jean, heartily.  \"It seems long  we've been parted, now I see you.  Are You well, dad, an' all right?\"    \"Not complainin', son. I can ride all day same as ever,\" he said.  \"Come.  Never mind your hosses.  They'll be looked after. Come meet the  folks.... Wal, wal, you got heah at last.\"    On the porch of the house a group awaited Jean's coming, rather  silently, he thought.  Wide-eyed children were there, very shy and  watchful.  The dark face of his sister corresponded with the image of  her in his memory.  She appeared taller, more womanly, as she embraced  him.  \"Oh, Jean, Jean, I'm glad you've come!\" she cried, and pressed  him close.  Jean felt in her a woman's anxiety for the present as well  as affection for the past.  He remembered his aunt Mary, though he had  not seen her for years.  His half brothers, Bill and Guy, had changed  but little except perhaps to grow lean and rangy.  Bill resembled his  father, though his aspect was jocular rather than serious.  Guy was  smaller, wiry, and hard as rock, with snapping eyes in a brown, still  face, and he had the bow-legs of a cattleman.  Both had married in  Arizona.  Bill's wife, Kate, was a stout, comely little woman, mother  of three of the children.  The other wife was young, a strapping girl,  red headed and freckled, with wonderful lines of pain and strength in  her face.  Jean remembered, as he looked at her, that some one had  written him about the tragedy in her life.  When she was only a child  the Apaches had murdered all her family.  Then next to greet Jean were  the little children, all shy, yet all manifestly impressed by the  occasion.  A warmth and intimacy of forgotten home emotions flooded  over Jean.  Sweet it was to get home to these relatives who loved him  and welcomed him with quiet gladness.  But there seemed more.  Jean was  quick to see the shadow in the eyes of the women in that household and  to sense a strange reliance which his presence brought.    \"Son, this heah Tonto is a land of milk an' honey,\" said his father, as  Jean gazed spellbound at the bounteous supper.    Jean certainly performed gastronomic feats on this occasion, to the  delight of Aunt Mary and the wonder of the children.  \"Oh, he's  starv-ved to death,\" whispered one of the little boys to his sister.  They had begun to warm to this stranger uncle.  Jean had no chance to  talk, even had he been able to, for the meal-time showed a relaxation  of restraint and they all tried to tell him things at once.  In the  bright lamplight his father looked easier and happier as he beamed upon  Jean.    After supper the men went into an adjoining room that appeared most  comfortable and attractive.  It was long, and the width of the house,  with a huge stone fireplace, low ceiling of hewn timbers and walls of  the same, small windows with inside shutters of wood, and home-made  table and chairs and rugs.    \"Wal, Jean, do you recollect them shootin'-irons?\" inquired the  rancher, pointing above the fireplace.  Two guns hung on the spreading  deer antlers there.  One was a musket Jean's father had used in the war  of the rebellion and the other was a long, heavy, muzzle-loading  flintlock Kentucky, rifle with which Jean had learned to shoot.    \"Reckon I do, dad,\" replied Jean, and with reverent hands and a rush of  memory he took the old gun down.    \"Jean, you shore handle thet old arm some clumsy,\" said Guy Isbel,  dryly.  And Bill added a remark to the effect that perhaps Jean had  been leading a luxurious and tame life back there in Oregon, and then  added,  \"But I reckon he's packin' that six-shooter like a Texan.\"    \"Say, I fetched a gun or two along with me,\" replied Jean, jocularly.  \"Reckon I near broke my poor mule's back with the load of shells an'  guns.  Dad, what was the idea askin' me to pack out an arsenal?\"    \"Son, shore all shootin' arms an' such are at a premium in the Tonto,\"  replied his father.  \"An' I was givin' you a hunch to come loaded.\"    His cool, drawling voice seemed to put a damper upon the pleasantries.  Right there Jean sensed the charged atmosphere.  His brothers were  bursting with utterance about to break forth, and his father suddenly  wore a look that recalled to Jean critical times of days long past. But  the entrance of the children and the women folk put an end to  confidences.  Evidently the youngsters were laboring under subdued  excitement.  They preceded their mother, the smallest boy in the lead.  For him this must have been both a dreadful and a wonderful experience,  for he seemed to be pushed forward by his sister and brother and  mother, and driven by yearnings of his own.  \"There now, Lee.  Say,  'Uncle Jean, what did you fetch us?'  The lad hesitated for a shy,  frightened look at Jean, and then, gaining something from his scrutiny  of his uncle, he toddled forward and bravely delivered the question of  tremendous importance.    \"What did I fetch you, hey?\" cried Jean, in delight, as he took the lad  up on his knee.  \"Wouldn't you like to know?  I didn't forget, Lee. I  remembered you all.  Oh! the job I had packin' your bundle of  presents.... Now, Lee, make a guess.\"    \"I dess you fetched a dun,\" replied Lee.    \"A dun!--I'll bet you mean a gun,\" laughed Jean.  \"Well, you  four-year-old Texas gunman!  Make another guess.\"    That appeared too momentous and entrancing for the other two  youngsters, and, adding their shrill and joyous voices to Lee's, they  besieged Jean.    \"Dad, where's my pack?\" cried Jean.  \"These young Apaches are after my  scalp.\"    \"Reckon the boys fetched it onto the porch,\" replied the rancher.    Guy Isbel opened the door and went out.  \"By golly! heah's three  packs,\" he called.  \"Which one do you want, Jean?\"    \"It's a long, heavy bundle, all tied up,\" replied Jean.    Guy came staggering in under a burden that brought a whoop from the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20709"],[0,"From Pole to Pole: A Book for Young People (#7)"],[1," Emin  Effendi had not been tired of you, old moth-eaten parrot, he would not  have brought me to his harem.\" And then she hurries up to her room again  to ask the mirror if it is true that her eyes are red.    In order to forget her vexation she decides to go over to the great  bazaar in Stambul. The slave envelops her in a voluminous _kaftan_[2]  in which her white hands with yellow-stained nails disappear among the  folds. She slips into her shoes, which are like slippers with turned-up  points, and puts on the most important garment of all--the veil. Its  upper part covers the head and the forehead down to the eyebrows, while  the lower part hangs down over the chin, mouth, and part of the nose. A  woman does not show her face to any man but her husband. Of late years  many women transgress this rule and let the lower part of the veil fall  so low that most of the face is seen. Fatima, however, does not go with  the new fashion. She shows only her eyes, but her glances are enough to  let the man in the street perceive that she is beautiful. None of them  is so impertinent as to look at her or speak to her. Only Europeans she  meets turn round.    The slave does not go with her. She stops at the quay where the  _caiques_, or long rowing-boats, lie. The boatmen rise and scream  together. Each one extols with words and gestures the excellences of his  boat. She makes her choice, and steps in and sits down on the cushions.  The _caique_ is narrow and sharp as a canoe, painted white, with a gold  border on the gunwale. Two powerful men take their oars, and the  _caique_ darts over the blue waters of the Bosporus. Half-way between  Scutari and Stambul, Fatima looks eagerly down the Sea of Marmora. She  longs for an hour of freedom, and orders the boatmen to change the  direction. The wind is fresh, so they pull in their oars and hoist the  sail, and the boat glides southward at a rapid pace. But Fatima is  capricious, and is soon tired of the Sea of Marmora, and orders the men  to steer to the nearest quay in Stambul. She gives them two silver  coins, which they take without a word of thanks or civility. She hastens  up to the great bazaar and steps from the hot sunlight of the streets  into cool shade and gloom.    For the bazaars are like tunnels. They are streets and lanes covered  with vaults of stone, where daylight penetrates sparingly through the  cupolas in the roof. Here the heat of summer is not felt, and you can  walk dry-shod on stormy and rainy days. You are soon accustomed to the  darkness, but have great difficulty in finding the way unless you have  been born in Stambul and have often passed through this labyrinth. The  passages are quite narrow, but yet wide enough to allow _droshkies_[3]  and carts to pass through.    The bazaar, then, is an underground town in itself, a town of tradesmen  and artisans. On either side of every street is an endless row of small  open shops, the floors of which are raised a little above the level of  the street, and serve also as counters or show stands. The shops are not  mixed up together, but each industry, each class of goods, has its own  street. In the shoemakers' street, for example, shoes of all kinds are  set out, but the most common are slippers of yellow and red leather,  embroidered and stitched with gold, for men, women, and children, for  rich and poor. For a long distance you can see nothing but slippers and  shoes right and left.    You are very glad when the shoe department comes to an end and you come  to a large street where rich shopkeepers sell brocades of silver, gold,  and silk. It is best not to take much money with you to this street, or  you will be tempted to buy everything you see. Here lie mats from  Persia, embroidered silken goods from India, shawls from Kashmir, and  the finest work of southern Asia and northern Africa. Poor Fatima! Her  husband is wealthy enough, but he has no mind to let her scatter his  money about in the great bazaar. With sad looks she gazes at the  turquoises from Nishapur, the rubies from Badakshan, the pearls from the  coast of Bahrein, and the corals from the Indian Ocean.    When she has spent all the silver coins she has with her, she turns to  leave, but it is a long way to the entrances of the bazaar. She passes  through the street of the metalworkers and turns off at the armourers'  lane. There the noise is deafening: sledge hammers and mallets hammer  and beat, for the shops of the bazaar are workshops as well.    Again she turns a corner. Evidently she has lost her way, for she stands  and looks about in all directions. She has now come to a passage where  water-pipes and all articles connected with smoking are sold. Then she  turns in another direction. An odour tells her a long distance off that  she is coming to the street of spice-dealers. She has to ask her way  almost at every step.    Not only in Constantinople but in all parts of the Turkish Empire, and  all over the Mohammedan world, goods are bought and sold in these  half-dark tunnels which are called bazaars. It is the same in the  Mohammedan towns of North Africa, in Arabia, Asia Minor, Persia,  Caucasia, Afghanistan, India, and Turkestan. Wherever minarets rise  above the dwellings of men and the muezzin sings out his everlasting  \"There is no god but God,\" the exchange of wares and coin is carried on  in dark bazaars. The great bazaar in Stambul is one of the richest, but  even where the bazaars are small and insignificant the same order  prevails, the same mode of life. Among Turkish men and women of high  rank stroll poor ragamuffins and dervishes or begging monks. A caravan  of camels moves slowly through the crowd, bringing fresh supplies to the  tradesmen from a steamboat quay or from the railway station. The camels  have scarcely disappeared in the darkness before a train of mules with  heavy bales follows in their track. A loud-voiced man offers for sale  grapes and melons he carries in a basket, while another bears a  water-bottle of leather.    And all the races which swarm here! The great majority are, of course,  Turks, but we also see whole rows of shops where only Persians trade. We  see Hindus from India, Egyptians from Cairo, Arabs from the coasts of  the Red Sea, Circassians and Tatars from the Caucasus and the Crimea,  Sarts from Samarkand and Bokhara, Armenians, Jews, and Greeks, and not  infrequently we meet a negro from Zanzibar or a Chinaman from the  farthest East.    It is a confusion of shopmen and customers, brokers and thieves from all  the East. A noise and bustle, a deafening roar which never ceases all  day long, a hurrying, a striving and eagerness to clear the stock and  gain money. If the prices were fixed, business would soon be done. But  if you have taken a fancy to a Kurdish mat and ask the price, the  tradesman demands a quite absurd sum. You shrug your shoulders and go  your way. He calls out another, lower price. You go on quietly, and the  man comes running after you and has dropped his price to the lowest. In  every shop bargains are made vociferously in the same way. There is a  continual buzz of voices, now and then interrupted by the bells of  caravans.    The illumination is dim. The noonday sun penetrates only through  openings in the vault and forms patches of light. Dust floats about in  the shafts of light, mixed with smoke from water-pipes. The greater the  distance the dimmer this confined air appears. There is also an  indescribable odour. The smell of men and animals, of dusty goods, of  rank tobacco, of rotting refuse, strong spices, fresh, juicy fruit--all  mixed together into a peculiar odour which is characteristic of all  Oriental bazaars.    The bazaar of Stambul contains a great deal besides. On the northern  side is a line of old caravanserais, massive stone buildings of several  storeys, with galleries, passages, and rooms, and with a large open  court in the centre. Here resort the wholesale merchants, and here are  their warehouses and stocks. Lastly, cafes and eating-houses are found  in the tunnelled streets, baths and small oratories, so that a man can  pass his whole day in the bazaar without needing to go home. He can  obtain all he wants in the vicinity of his shop.

II    CONSTANTINOPLE TO TEHERAN (1905)      THE BLACK SEA    Attended by the _cavass_[4] of the Swedish Embassy, old Ali, I drove  down to the quay on a fresh, sunny October morning, loaded all my boxes  on board a _caique_, and was rowed by four men out to the Bosporus  between anchored sailing vessels, steamers, and yachts. On arriving at  the gangway of a large Russian steamer, I waited until all my luggage  was safe on board and then followed it.    The anchor is weighed, the propeller begins to turn, and the vessel  steers a course northwards through the Bosporus. With my field-glasses I  settle down on a bench in the stern and take farewell of the Turkish  capital. How grand, how unforgettable is this scene! The white, graceful  minarets shoot up to heaven from the sea of houses, and the  cypresses--tall, grave, and straight as kings--also seem to point out to  the children of earth the way to Paradise. Everywhere the houses mount  up the hills, ranged like the rows of seats in a theatre. The whole is  like a gigantic circus with an auditorium for more than a million Turks,  and the arena is the blue water of the Bosporus.    The steamer carries us away relentlessly from this charming picture. As  dreams fade away in the night, so the white city is concealed by the  first promontories. Then I change "]]]
