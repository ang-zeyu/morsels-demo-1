At the present    moment no concern can be more momentous, or in which the    consequences, the interests of the Country, can be more at    stake, than the education of its future Sovereign.      \"'I feel the time to be now come that what has been done    should be put to some test, that if anything has been done in    error of judgment it may be corrected, and that the plan for    the future should be open to consideration and revision. I do    not presume to have an over-confidence in what I have done; on    the contrary, as a female, as a stranger (but only in birth,    as I feel that this is my country by the duties I fulfil, and    the support I receive), I naturally desire to have a candid    opinion from authorities competent to give one. In that view I    address your Lordships; I would propose to you that you advert    to all I have stated, to the papers I lay before you, and that    then you should personally examine the Princess with a view of    telling me--        \"'1. If the course hitherto pursued in Her education has          been the best; if not, where it was erroneous.        \"'2. If the Princess has made all the Progress she should         have made.        \"'3. And if the course I am to follow is that you would         recommend, and if not in what respect you would         desire a change, and on what grounds.      \"'Mr Davys[4] will explain to you the nature of the Princess's    religious education, which I have confided to him, that    she should be brought up in the Church of England as by    Law established. When she was at a proper age she commenced    attending Divine Service regularly with me, and I have every    feeling, that she has religion at Her heart, that she is    morally impressed with it to that degree, that she is less    liable to error by its application to Her feelings as a Child    capable of reflection. The general bent of Her character    is strength of intellect, capable of receiving with ease,    information, and with a peculiar readiness in coming to a very    just and benignant decision on any point Her opinion is asked    on. Her adherence to truth is of so marked a character that I    feel no apprehension of that Bulwark being broken down by any    circumstance.      \"'I must conclude by observing that as yet the Princess is not    aware of the station that she is likely to fill. She is aware    of its duties, and that a Sovereign should live for others;    so that when Her innocent mind receives the impression of Her    future fate, she receives it with a mind formed to be sensible    of what is to be expected from Her, and it is to be hoped, she    will be too well grounded in Her principles to be dazzled with    the station she is to look to.'\"        [Footnote 3: Charles James Blomfield, Bishop of London,      1828-1853, and John Kaye, Bishop of Lincoln, 1827-1853.]        [Footnote 4: The Rev. George Davys, the Princess's instructor,      afterwards successively Dean of Chester and Bishop of      Peterborough.]      The examination was undertaken by the Bishops, with highly  satisfactory results. Their report says:      \"The result of the examination has been such as in our opinion    amply to justify the plan of instruction which has been    adopted. In answering a great variety of questions proposed to    her, the Princess displayed an accurate knowledge of the most    important features of Scripture History, and of the leading    truths and precepts of the Christian Religion as taught by    the Church of England, as well as an acquaintance with the    Chronology and principal facts of English History remarkable    in so young a person. To questions in Geography, the use of    the Globes, Arithmetic, and Latin Grammar, the answers which    the Princess returned were equally satisfactory.      \"Upon the whole, we feel no hesitation in stating our opinion    that the Princess should continue, for some time to come, to    pursue her studies upon the same plan which has been hitherto    followed, and under the same superintendence. Nor do we    apprehend that any other alterations in the plan will be    required than those which will be gradually made by the    judicious director of Her Highness's studies, as the mind    expands, and her faculties are strengthened.\"      [Pageheading: RESULT OF EXAMINATION]    The Duchess of Kent referred all this correspondence to the Archbishop  of Canterbury.[5] His memorandum is preserved; it states he has  considered the Report, and further, has himself personally examined  the Princess. He continues:      \"I feel it my duty to say that in my judgment the plan of Her    Highness's studies, as detailed in the papers transmitted to me by    command of your Royal Highness, is very judicious, and particularly    suitable to Her Highness's exalted station; and that from the    proficiency exhibited by the Princess in the examination at which    I was present, and the general correctness and pertinency of her    answers, I am perfectly satisfied that Her Highness's education    in regard to cultivation of intellect, improvement of talent, and    religious and moral principle, is conducted with so much care and    success as to render any alteration of the system undesirable.\"        [Footnote 5: Dr William Howley.]    The Princess was gradually and watchfully introduced to public life,  and was never allowed to lose sight of the fact that her exalted  position carried with it definite and obvious duties. The following  speech, delivered at Plymouth in 1832, in answer to a complimentary  deputation, may stand as an instance of the view which the Duchess of  Kent took of her own and her daughter's responsibilities:--      \"It is very agreeable to the Princess and myself to hear the    sentiments you convey to us. It is also gratifying to us to be assured    that we owe all these kind feelings to the attachment you bear the    King, as well as to his Predecessors of the House of Brunswick, from    recollections of their paternal sway. The object of my life is    to render the Princess worthy of the affectionate solicitude she    inspires, and if it be the Will of Providence she should fill a higher    station (I trust most fervently at a very distant day), I shall    be fully repaid for my anxious care, if she is found competent to    discharge the sacred trust; for communicating as the Princess does    with all classes of Society, she cannot but perceive that the greater    the diffusion of Religion, Knowledge, and the love of freedom in a    country, the more orderly, industrious, and wealthy is its population,    and that with the desire to preserve the constitutional Prerogatives    of the Crown ought to be co-ordinate the protection of the liberties    of the people.\"      [Pageheading: CLAREMONT]    The strictness of the _regime_ under which the Princess was brought  up is remarkable; and it is possible that her later zest for simple  social pleasures is partly to be accounted for by the austere routine  of her early days. In an interesting letter of 1843 to the Queen,  recalling the days of their childhood, Princess Feodore, the Queen's  half-sister, wrote--    \"Many, many thanks, dearest Victoria, for your kind letter of the  7th from dear Claremont. Oh I understand how you like being there.  Claremont is a dear quiet place; to me also the recollection of the  few pleasant days I spent during my youth. I always left Claremont  with tears for Kensington Palace. When I look back upon those years,  which ought to have been the happiest in my life, from fourteen  to twenty, I cannot help pitying myself. Not to have enjoyed the  pleasures of youth is nothing, but to have been deprived of all  intercourse, and not one cheerful thought in that dismal existence of  ours, was very hard. My only happy time was going or driving out with  you and Lehzen; then I could speak and look as I liked. I escaped  some years of imprisonment, which you, my poor darling sister, had  to endure after I was married. But God Almighty has changed both  our destinies most mercifully, and has made us _so_ happy in our  homes--which is the only real happiness in this life; and those years  of trial were, I am sure, very useful to us both, though certainly not  pleasant. Thank God they are over!... I was much amused in your last  letter at your tracing the _quickness_ of our tempers in the female  line up to Grandmamma,[6] but I must own that you are _quite right_!\"        [Footnote 6: Augusta Caroline Sophia, Dowager-Duchess      of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, a Princess of Reuss Ebersdorf      (1757-1831).]    But if there was little amusement, there was, on the other hand, great  devotion; the Princess, as a child, had that peculiar combination  of self-will and warm-heartedness which is apt to win for a child a  special love from its elders. The Princess Feodore wrote to the Queen,  in 1843--    \"... Spaeth[7] wished _me_ to thank you for the coronation print, as  she could not write to you or Albert _now_, she says! why, I don't  see. There certainly never was such devotedness as hers, to all our  family, although it sometimes shows itself rather foolishly--with you  it always was a sort of idolatry, when she used to go upon her knees  before you, when you were a child. She and poor old Louis did all  they could to spoil you, if Lehzen had not prevented and scolded them  nicely sometimes; it was quite amusing.\"        [Footnote 7: Baroness Spaeth, Lady-in-Waiting to the Duchess of      Kent.]      [Pageheading: WILLIAM IV.]    The Princess was brought up with exemplary simplicity at Kensington  Palace, where her mother had a set of apartments. She was often at  Claremont, which belonged to her uncle Leopold, King of the Belgians;  holidays were spent at Ramsgate, Tunbridge Wells, Broadstairs, and  elsewhere.    In June 1830 George IV. died, and William IV."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20031"],[0,"A Final Reckoning: A Tale of Bush Life in Australia (#7)"],[1,"for my dead husband.\"    \"I think the squire was too hasty, Mrs. Whitney,\" the schoolmaster  said. \"But you see, he did not know Reuben as we do; and I think,  if you will excuse my saying so, you have been a little hasty, too.  The squire came in to me to tell me about it, and I could see he  was not satisfied in his mind, even before I gave him my positive  opinion that Reuben was innocent; and I do think that, if you had  not given Mrs. Ellison notice so sharply, the squire would have  taken back his words; and said that at any rate, as there was  nothing absolutely proved, he would hold his judgment in suspense  until the matter was cleared up.\"    \"And having everyone pointing the finger at my boy in the meantime!  No, thank you, Mr. Shrewsbury, that would not do for me. I was not  a bit hasty. Mrs. Ellison came in here prepared to talk to me about  Reuben's wickedness; I saw it in her face, so I wouldn't let her  open her lips. If she had, I should have given her a piece of my  mind that she wouldn't have forgot, in a hurry.\"    \"I can quite understand your feelings, Mrs. Whitney,\" the  schoolmaster said, \"and I have no doubt I should have acted as you  did, if a son of mine had been suspected in the same way. Still, I  think it's a pity; for if Reuben had stayed here, there would have  been more chance of the matter being cleared up. However, we won't  talk about that now. Now tell me, what are your plans?\"    Mrs. Whitney told her visitors what she had determined upon. As  Lewes was only four miles off, the schoolmaster said that he and  his wife would sometimes come over to see her; and that he hoped  that Reuben, whatever trade he was apprenticed to, would still go  on with his studies. He would give him any advice or assistance in  his power.    The next day Mrs. Whitney and Reuben moved, with all their  belongings, to Lewes.        Chapter 3: The Burglary At The Squire's.      \"What is that woman Whitney going to do with her boy?\" the squire  asked the schoolmaster, when he happened to meet him in the village  about a month after she had left. \"Have you heard?\"    \"Nothing is settled yet, sir. My wife had a letter from her, two or  three days ago, saying that she had been disappointed in getting  Penfold the mill wright to take him. He wanted fifty pounds  premium, and she could only afford to pay twenty, so she is looking  out for something else. You have heard nothing more that would  throw any light on that affair, squire?\"    \"No, and don't suppose I ever shall. Have you any opinion about  it?\"    \"My opinion is that of Reuben, himself,\" the schoolmaster said. \"He  believes that someone did it who had a grudge against him, on  purpose, to throw suspicion on him.\"    \"Who should have a grudge against him?\" the squire asked.    \"Well, squire, there was one boy in the village who had, rightly or  wrongly, a grudge against Reuben. That is Tom Thorne. Reuben has  not a shadow of evidence that it was this boy, but the lad has  certainly been his enemy ever since that affair of breaking the  windows of the school, just before I came here. Thorne, you know,  did it, but allowed Reuben to be punished for the offence; and the  truth would never have been known had it not been, as I heard, that  your daughter happened to see the stone thrown. Since that time  there has been bad blood between the boys. I do not for a moment  say that Thorne poisoned your dog. Still, the boys are near enough  of a size for one to be mistaken for the other in the dark; and  Thorne knew that Reuben had been bitten by the dog, for Reuben  spoke to another boy about it, that afternoon, while Thorne was  standing by. Of course, this is but the vaguest suspicion. Still,  if you ask my opinion, I should say that I consider, from what I  have heard of the character of Tom Thorne, that he would be much  more likely to poison the dog, in order to get Reuben into  disgrace, than Reuben would be to do so out of revenge because the  dog had bitten him.\"    The squire took off his hat, and passed his hands through his hair,  in perplexity.    \"I don't know what to think, Shrewsbury,\" he said. \"It may be as  you say. I look upon Thorne as the worst character in the village,  and likely enough his son may take after him. That ale house of his  is the resort of all the idle fellows about. I have strong reason  to believe he is in alliance with the poachers. The first time I  get a chance, out he goes. I have only been waiting, for some time,  for an opportunity. I can't very well turn him out of his house  without some excuse.    \"What did you say was the name of the mill wright at Lewes Mrs.  Whitney was wanting to get her son with?\"    The schoolmaster repeated the name, which the squire jotted down in  a notebook.    \"Look here, Shrewsbury,\" he said, \"don't you mention to Mrs.  Whitney that you spoke to me about this matter. Do you understand?\"    \"I understand, sir,\" the schoolmaster said.    And he was not surprised when, a few days afterwards, his wife  received a letter from Mrs. Whitney, saying that Mr. Penfold had  come in to say that he had changed his mind, and that he would take  Reuben as his apprentice for twenty pounds; adding, to her  surprise, that he should give him half a crown a week for the first  year, and gradually raise his pay, as he considered that boys ought  to be able to earn a little money for themselves.    Reuben, therefore, was going to work on the following week. The  half a crown a week which he was to earn was an important matter  for his mother. For although she had found a cottage and opened a  little shop, as before, her receipts were extremely small, and she  had already begun to fear that she should be obliged to make  another move, Lewes being too well supplied with shops for a small  concern like hers to flourish. The half crown a week, however,  would pay her rent; and she expected that she should make, at any  rate, enough to provide food for herself and Reuben.    Mrs. Whitney had hoped that, although Lewes was but four miles from  the village, the story about the dog would not travel so far; for  it was not often that anyone from the village went over to the  town. In this, however, she was mistaken for, a week after Reuben  had gone to work, the foreman went to his master and said:    \"I don't know whether you are aware, Mr. Penfold, about that new  boy; but I hear that he had to leave Tipping, where he was employed  by Squire Ellison, for poisoning the squire's dog.\"    \"How did you hear it?\" Mr. Penfold asked.    \"William Jenkins heard it from a man named Thorne, who belongs to  the village, and whom he met at a public house, yesterday.\"    \"William Jenkins had best not spend so much time in public houses,\"  Mr. Penfold said shortly. \"I heard the story before I saw the boy  and, from what I hear, I believe he was wrongfully accused. Just  tell Jenkins that; and say that if I hear of him, or any of the  hands, throwing the thing up in the boy's face, I will dismiss them  instantly.\"    And so Reuben did not know, till long after, that the story of the  killing of the dog was known to anyone at Lewes.    For three years he worked in Mr. Penfold's yard, giving much  satisfaction to his employer by his steadiness and handiness. He  continued his studies of an evening, under the advice of his former  master; who came over with his wife, three or four times each year,  to spend a day with Mrs. Whitney. Reuben was now receiving ten  shillings a week and, although the receipts of the shop failed, he  and his mother were able to live in considerable comfort.    One day, about three years after coming to Lewes, he was returning  to work after dinner when, as he passed a carriage standing in  front of one of the shops, he heard his name pronounced, and the  colour flushed to his cheek as, looking up, he saw Kate Ellison.  Timidly he touched his cap, and would have hurried on, but the girl  called to him.    \"Stop a minute, Reuben. I want to speak to you. I am glad I have  met you. I have looked for you, every time I have come to Lewes. I  wanted to tell you that I am sure you did not kill Wolf. I know you  wouldn't have done it. Besides, you know, you told me that you  never told stories; so when I heard that you said you didn't, I was  quite sure about it.\"    \"Thank you, miss,\" Reuben said gratefully. \"I did not kill the dog.  I should never have thought of such a thing, though every one  seemed against me.\"    \"Not every one, Reuben. I didn't think so; and papa has told me,  since, that he did not think so, and that he was afraid that he had  made a mistake.\"    \"I am glad to hear that, miss,\" Reuben said. \"The squire had been  very kind to me, and it has always grieved me, very much, that he  should think me capable of such a thing. I felt angry at the time,  but I have not felt angry since I have thought it over quietly; for  the case seems so strong against me that I don't see how the squire  could have thought otherwise.    \"Thank you, miss. I sha'n't forget your kindness,\" and Reuben went  on with a light heart, just as Mrs. Ellison and her elder daughter  came out from the shop.    \"Who were you speaking to, Kate?\" she asked, as she took her seat  in the carriage.    \"I was talking to Reuben Whitney, mamma. He was passing, so I  called him to tell him that I did not believe he had killed Wolf.\"    \"Then it was very improper behaviour on your part, Kate,\" her  mother said angrily, for she had never quite recovered from the  shock Mrs. Whitney had given to her dignity. \"You know my opinion  on the subject. I have told you before that it is one I do not care  to have discussed, and that I consider it very improper for a girl,  of your age, to hold opinions different to those of your elders. I  have no doubt, whatever, that boy poisoned the dog. I must beg of  you that you will never speak to him again.\"    Kate leaned back in the carriage with a little sigh. She could not  understand why her "]]]
