Any action foreign to the regular habits of an  animal was to be mistrusted.    Getting to his feet Hume paced along the line of marks. They were  fresh--hot fresh. And they still led in a straight line for the woods.  With another wave of his hand he stopped Chambriss. The civ was  trained in spite of his eagerness and obeyed. Hume left the tracks,  made a detour which brought him to a point from which he could study  those clumps of brush. No sign except that line of prints pointed to  the woods. And if the party kept on, they might well come upon the  L-B!    He decided to risk it. But when they were less than a couple of yards  from the tree fringe his hand shot up to direct Chambriss to fire  towards the quivering bush.    Only, that formless half seen thing, hardly to be distinguished in  color from the vegetation, was no water-cat. There was a thin, ragged  cry. Then the creature plunged backward, was gone.    \"What in the name of nine Gods was that?\" Chambriss demanded.    \"I don't know.\" Hume went forward, jerked the needler dart from a tree  trunk. \"But don't shoot again--not unless you are sure of what you are  aiming at!\"          5      Moisture from the night's rain hung on the tree leaves, clung in  globules to Rynch's sweating body. He lay on a wide branch trying to  control the heavy panting which supplied his laboring lungs. And he  could still hear the echoes of the startled cries which had come from  the men who had threaded through the woods to the up-pointed tail fins  of the L-B.    Now he tried to reason why he had run. They were his own kind, they  would take him out of the loneliness of a world heretofore empty of  his species. But that tall man--the one who had led the party into the  irregular clearing about the life boat--    Rynch shivered, dug his nails into the wood on which he lay. At the  sight of that man, dream and reality had crashed together, sending him  into panic-stricken flight. That was the man from the room--the man  with the cup!    As his heart quieted he began to think more coherently. First, he had  not been able to find the strong-jaws's den. Then the marks on the  ground at the point from which he had fallen and the L-B were here,  just as he remembered. But not far from the small ship he had  discovered something more--a campsite with a shelter fashioned out of  spalls and vines, containing possessions a castaway might have  accumulated.    That man would come, Rynch was sure of that, but he was too spent to  struggle on.    No, the answer to every part of the puzzle lay with that man. To go  back to the ship clearing was to risk capture--but he had to know.  Rynch looked with more attention at his present surroundings. Deep  mold under the trees here would hold tracks. There might just be  another way to move. He eyed the spread of limbs on a neighbor tree.    His journey through those heights was awkward and he sweated and  cringed when he disturbed vocal treetop dwellers. He was also to  discover that close to the site of the L-B crash others waited.    He huddled against the bole of a tree when he made out the curve of a  round bulk holding tight to the tree trunk aloft. Though it was balled  in upon itself he was sure the creature was fully as large as he, and  the menacing claws suggested it was a formidable opponent.    When it made no move to follow him Rynch began to hope it had only  been defending its own hiding place, for its present attitude  suggested concealment.    Still facing that featureless blob in the tree, the man retreated,  alert for the first sign of advance on the part of the creature above.  None came, and he dared to slip around the bole of the tree under  which he stood, listening intently for any corresponding movement  overhead. Now he was facing that survivor's camp.    Another object crouched in the dark of the lean-to shelter, just as  its fellow was on sentry duty in the tree! Only this one did not have  the self-color of the foliage to disguise it. Four-limbed, its long  forearms curved about its bent knees, its general outline almost that  of a human--if a human went clothed in a thick fuzz. The head hunched  right against the shoulders as if the neck were very short, or totally  lacking, was pear-shaped, with the longer end to the back, and the  sense organs of eyes and nose squeezed together on the lower quarter  of the rounded portion, with a line of wide mouth to split the blunt  round of the muzzle. Dark pits for eyes showed no pupil, iris, or  cornea. The nose was a black, perfectly rounded tube jutting an inch  or so beyond the cheek surface. Grotesque, alien and terrifying, it  made no hostile move. And, since it had not turned its head, he could  not be sure it had even sighted him. But it knew he was there, he was  certain of that. And was waiting--for what? As the long seconds  crawled by Rynch began to believe that it was not waiting for him.  Heartened, he pulled at the vine loop, climbed back into the tree.    Minutes later he discovered that there were more than two of the  beasts waiting quietly about the camp, and that their sentry line ran  between him and the clearing of the L-B. He withdrew farther into the  wood, intent upon finding a detour which would bring him out into the  open lands. Now he wanted to join forces with his own kind, whether  those men were potential enemies or not.    As time passed the beasts closed about the clearing of the camp.  Afternoon was fading into evening when he reached a point several  miles downstream near the river. Since he had come into the open he  had not sighted any of the watchers. He hoped they did not willingly  venture out of the trees where the leaves were their protection.    Rynch went flat on the stream bank, made a worm's progress up the  slope to crouch behind a bush and survey the land immediately ahead.  There stood an off-world spacer, fins down, nose skyward, and grouped  not too far from its landing ramp, a collection of bubble tents. A  fire burned in their midst and men were moving about it.    Now that he was free from the wood and its watchers and had come so  near to his goal, Rynch was curiously reluctant to do the sensible  thing, to rise out of concealment and walk up to that fire, to claim  rescue by his own kind.    The man he sought stood by the fire, shrugging his arms into a webbing  harness which brought a box against his chest. Having made that fast  he picked up a needler by its sling. By their gestures the others were  arguing with him, but he shook his head, came on, to be a shadow  stalking among other shadows. One of the men trailed him, but as they  reached a post planted a little beyond the bubble tents he stopped,  allowed the explorer to advance alone into the dark.    Rynch went to cover under a bush. The man was heading to the stream  bed. Had they somehow learned of his own presence nearby, were they  out to find him? But the preparations the tall man had made seemed  more suited to going on patrol. The watchers! Was the other out to spy  on them? That idea made sense. And in the meantime he would let the  other past him, follow along behind until he was far enough from the  camp so that his friends could not interfere--then, they would have a  meeting!    Rynch's fingers balled into fists. He would find out what was real,  what was a dream in this crazy, mixed up mind of his! That other would  know, and would tell him the truth!    Alert as he was, he lost sight of the stranger who melted into the  dusky cover of the shadows. Then came a quiet ripple of water close to  his own hiding place. The man from the spacer camp was using the  stream as his road.    In spite of his caution Rynch was close to betrayal as he edged around  a clump of vegetation growing half in, half out of the stream. Only a  timely rustle told him that the other had sat down on a drift log.    Waiting for him? Rynch froze, so startled that he could not think  clearly for a second. Then he noted that the outline of the other's  body was visible, growing brighter by the moment.    Minute particles of pale-greenish radiance were gathering about the  other. The dark shadow of an arm flapped, the radiance swirled, broke  again into pinpoint sparks.    Rynch glanced down at his own body--the same sparks were drifting in  about him, edging his arms, thighs, chest. He pushed back into the  bushes while the sparks still flitted, but they no longer gathered in  strength enough to light his presence. Now he could see they drifted  about the vegetation, about the log where the man sat, about rocks and  reeds. Only they were thicker about the stranger as if his body were a  magnet. He continued to keep them whirling by means of waving hand and  arm, but there was enough light to show Rynch the fingers of his other  hand, busy on the front panel of the box he wore.    That fingering stopped, then Rynch's head came up as he heard a very  faint sound. Not a beast's cry--or was it?    Again those fingers moved on the panel. Was the other sending a  message by that means? Rynch watched him check the webbing, count the  equipment at his belt, settle the needler in the crook of his arm.  Then the stranger left the stream, headed towards the woods.    Rynch jumped to his feet, a cry of warning shaping, but not to be  uttered. He padded after the other. There was plenty of time to stop  the man before he reached the danger which might lurk under the trees.    However the other was as wary of that dark as if he suspected what  might lie in wait there. He angled along northward, avoiding clumps of  scattered brush, keeping in the open where Rynch dared not tail him  too closely.    Their course, parallel to the woods, brought them at last to a second  stream, the size of a river, into which the first creek emptied. Here  the other settled down between two rocks with every"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19092"],[0,"The Adventures of Paddy Beaver (#7)"],[1,"all the little people of the Green Forest or the  Green Meadows. Sharp as are the wits of old Granny Fox, they are not  quite as sharp as the wits of Old Man Coyote. If you want to fool him,  you will have to get up very early in the morning, and then it is more  than likely that you will be the one fooled, not he. There is very  little going on around him that he doesn't know about. But once in a  while something escapes him. The coming of Paddy the Beaver to the Green  Forest was one of these things. He didn't know a thing about Paddy until  Paddy had finished his dam and his house, and was cutting his supply of  food for the winter.    You see, it was this way: When the Merry Little Breezes of Old Mother  West Wind first heard what was going on in the Green Forest and hurried  around over the Green Meadows and through the Green Forest to spread the  news, as is their way, they took the greatest pains not to even hint it  to Old Man Coyote because they were afraid that he would make trouble  and perhaps drive Paddy away. The place that Paddy had chosen to build  his dam was so deep in the Green Forest that Old Man Coyote seldom went  that way. So it was that he knew nothing about Paddy, and Paddy knew  nothing about him for some time.    But after a while Old Man Coyote noticed that the little people of  the Green Meadows were not about as much as usual. They seemed to have  a secret of some kind. He mentioned the matter to his friend, Digger  the Badger.    Digger had been so intent on his own affairs that he hadn't noticed  anything unusual, but when Old Man Coyote mentioned the matter he  remembered that Blacky the Crow headed straight for the Green Forest  every morning. Several times he had seen Sammy Jay flying in the same  direction as if in a great hurry to get somewhere.    Old Man Coyote grinned. \"That's all I need to know, friend Digger,\"  said he. \"When Blacky the Crow and Sammy Jay visit a place more than  once, something interesting is going on there. I think I'll take a  stroll up through the Green Forest and have a look around.\"    With that, off Old Man Coyote started. But he was too sly and crafty to  go straight to the Green Forest. He pretended to hunt around over the  Green Meadows just as he usually did, all the time working nearer and  nearer to the Green Forest. When he reached the edge of it, he slipped  in among the trees, and when he felt sure that no one was likely to see  him, he began to run this way and that way with his nose to the ground.    \"Ha!\" he exclaimed presently, \"Reddy Fox has been this way lately.\"    Pretty soon he found another trail. \"So,\" said he, \"Peter Rabbit has  been over here a good deal of late, and his trail goes in the same  direction as that of Reddy Fox. I guess all I have to do now is to  follow Peter's trail, and it will lead me to what I want to find out.\"    So Old Man Coyote followed Peter's trail, and he presently came to the  pond of Paddy the Beaver. \"Ha!\" said he, as he looked out and saw  Paddy's new house. \"So there is a newcomer to the Green Forest! I have  always heard that Beaver is very good eating. My stomach begins to feel  empty this very minute.\" His mouth began to water, and a fierce, hungry  look shone in his yellow eyes.    It was just then that Sammy Jay saw him and began to scream at the top  of his lungs so that Paddy the Beaver over in his house heard him. Old  Man Coyote knew that it was of no use to stay longer with Sammy Jay  about, so he took a hasty look at the pond and found where Paddy came  ashore to cut his food. Then, shaking his fist at Sammy Jay, he started  straight back for the Green Meadows. \"I'll just pay a visit here in the  night,\" said he, \"and give Mr. Beaver a surprise while he is at work.\"    But with all his craft, Old Man Coyote didn't notice that he had left a  footprint in the mud.    [Illustration]          XVII    OLD MAN COYOTE IS DISAPPOINTED      Old Man Coyote lay stretched out in his favorite napping place on the  Green Meadows. He was thinking of what he had found out up in the Green  Forest that morning--that Paddy the Beaver was living there. Old Man  Coyote's thoughts seemed very pleasant to himself, though really they  were very dreadful thoughts. You see, he was thinking how easy it was  going to be to catch Paddy the Beaver, and what a splendid meal he would  make. He licked his chops at the thought.    \"He doesn't know I know he's here,\" thought Old Man Coyote. \"In fact, I  don't believe he even knows that I am anywhere around. Of course, he  won't be watching for me. He cuts his trees at night, so all I will have  to do is to hide right close by where he is at work, and he'll walk  right into my mouth. Sammy Jay knows I was up there this morning, but  Sammy sleeps at night, so he will not give the alarm. My, my, how good  that Beaver will taste!\" He licked his chops once more, then yawned and  closed his eyes for a nap.    Old Man Coyote waited until jolly, round, red Mr. Sun had gone to bed  behind the Purple Hills, and the Black Shadows had crept out across the  Green Meadows. Then, keeping in the blackest of them, and looking very  much like a shadow himself, he slipped into the Green Forest. It was  dark in there, and he made straight for Paddy's new pond, trotting along  swiftly without making a sound. When he was near the aspen-trees which  he knew Paddy was planning to cut, he crept forward very slowly and  carefully. Everything was still as still could be.    \"Good!\" thought Old Man Coyote. \"I am here first, and now all I need do  is to hide and wait for Paddy to come ashore.\"    So he stretched himself flat behind some brush close beside the little  path Paddy had made up from the edge of the water and waited. It was  very still, so still that it seemed almost as if he could hear his heart  beat. He could see the little stars twinkling in the sky and their own  reflections twinkling back at them from the water of Paddy's pond. Old  Man Coyote waited and waited. He is very patient when there is something  to gain by it. For such a splendid dinner as Paddy the Beaver would make  he felt that he could well afford to be patient. So he waited and  waited, and everything was as still as if no living thing but the trees  were there. Even the trees seemed to be asleep.    At last, after a long, long time, he heard just the faintest splash. He  pricked up his ears and peeped out on the pond with the hungriest look  in his yellow eyes. There was a little line of silver coming straight  towards him. He knew that it was made by Paddy the Beaver swimming.  Nearer and nearer it drew. Old Man Coyote chuckled way down deep inside,  without making a sound. He could see Paddy's head now, and Paddy was  coming straight in, as if he hadn't a fear in the world.    Almost to the edge of the pond swam Paddy. Then he stopped. In a few  minutes he began to swim again, but this time it was back in the  direction of his house, and he seemed to be carrying something. It was  one of the little food logs he had cut that day, and he was taking it  out to his storehouse. Then back he came for another. And so he kept on,  never once coming ashore. Old Man Coyote waited until Paddy had carried  the last log to his storehouse and then, with a loud whack on the water  with his broad tail, had dived and disappeared in his house.    Then Old Man Coyote arose and started elsewhere to look for his dinner,  and in his heart was bitter disappointment.          XVIII    OLD MAN COYOTE TRIES ANOTHER PLAN      For three nights Old Man Coyote had stolen up through the Green Forest  with the coming of the Black Shadows and had hidden among the  aspen-trees where Paddy the Beaver cut his food, and for three nights  Paddy had failed to come ashore. Each night he had seemed to have enough  food logs in the water to keep him busy without cutting more. Old Man  Coyote lay there, and the hungry look in his eyes changed to one of  doubt and then to suspicion. Could it be that Paddy the Beaver was  smarter than he thought? It began to look very much as if Paddy knew  perfectly well that he was hiding there each night. Yes, Sir, that's the  way it looked. For three nights Paddy hadn't cut a single tree, and yet  each night he had plenty of food logs ready to take to his storehouse in  the pond.    \"That means that he comes ashore in the daytime and cuts his trees,\"  thought Old Man Coyote as, tired and with black anger in his heart, he  trotted home the third night. \"He couldn't have found out about me  himself; he isn't smart enough. It must be that some one has told him.  And nobody knows that I have been over there but Sammy Jay. It must be  he who has been the tattletale. I think I'll visit Paddy by daylight  to-morrow, and then we'll see!\"    Now the trouble with some smart people is that they are never able to  believe that others may be as smart as they. Old Man Coyote didn't know  that the first time he had visited Paddy's pond he had left behind him a  footprint in a little patch of soft mud. If he had known it, he wouldn't  have believed that Paddy would be smart enough to guess what that  footprint meant. So Old Man Coyote laid all the blame at the door of  Sammy Jay, and that very morning, when Sammy came flying over the Green  Meadows, Old Man Coyote accused him of being a tattletale and threatened  the most dreadful things to Sammy if ever he caught him.    Now Sammy had flown down to the Green Meadows to tell Old Man Coyote  how Paddy was doing all his work on land in the daytime. But when Old  Man Coyote began to call him a tattletale and accuse him of having  warned Paddy, and to threaten dreadful things, he straightway forgot all  his anger at Paddy and turned it all on Old Man Coyote. He called him  everything he could think of, and this was a great deal, for Sammy has a  wicked tongue. When he hadn't any breath left, he flew over to the Green  Forest, and there he hid where he could watch all that was going"]]]
