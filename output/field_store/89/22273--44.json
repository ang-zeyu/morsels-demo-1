Such things take place only that the souls of men may develop  and be delivered from the prison-cage of self and desire. Otherwise, that  ideal King hath, throughout eternity, been in His Essence independent of  the comprehension of all beings, and will continue, for ever, in His own  Being to be exalted above the adoration of every soul. A single breeze of  His affluence doth suffice to adorn all mankind with the robe of wealth;  and one drop out of the ocean of His bountiful grace is enough to confer  upon all beings the glory of everlasting life. But inasmuch as the divine  Purpose hath decreed that the true should be known from the false, and the  sun from the shadow, He hath, therefore, in every season sent down upon  mankind the showers of tests from His realm of glory.    Were men to meditate upon the lives of the Prophets of old, so easily  would they come to know and understand the ways of these Prophets that  they would cease to be veiled by such deeds and words as are contrary to  their own worldly desires, and thus consume every intervening veil with  the fire burning in the Bush of divine knowledge, and abide secure upon  the throne of peace and certitude. For instance, consider Moses, son of  'Imran, one of the exalted Prophets and Author of a divinely-revealed  Book. Whilst passing, one day, through the market, in His early days, ere  His ministry was proclaimed, He saw two men engaged in fighting. One of  them asked the help of Moses against his opponent. Whereupon, Moses  intervened and slew him. To this testifieth the record of the sacred Book.  Should the details be cited, they will lengthen and interrupt the course  of the argument. The report of this incident spread throughout the city,  and Moses was full of fear, as is witnessed by the text of the Book. And  when the warning: \"O Moses! of a truth, the chiefs take counsel to slay  Thee\"(43) reached His ears, He went forth from the city, and sojourned in  Midian in the service of Shoeb. While returning, Moses entered the holy  vale, situate in the wilderness of Sinai, and there beheld the vision of  the King of glory from the \"Tree that belongeth neither to the East nor to  the West.\"(44) There He heard the soul-stirring Voice of the Spirit  speaking from out of the kindled Fire, bidding Him to shed upon Pharaonic  souls the light of divine guidance; so that, liberating them from the  shadows of the valley of self and desire, He might enable them to attain  the meads of heavenly delight, and delivering them, through the Salsabil  of renunciation, from the bewilderment of remoteness, cause them to enter  the peaceful city of the divine presence. When Moses came unto Pharaoh and  delivered unto him, as bidden by God, the divine Message, Pharaoh spoke  insultingly saying: \"Art thou not he that committed murder, and became an  infidel?\" Thus recounted the Lord of majesty as having been said by  Pharaoh unto Moses: \"What a deed is that which Thou hast done! Thou art  one of the ungrateful. He said: 'I did it indeed, and I was one of those  who erred. And I fled from you when I feared you, but My Lord hath given  Me wisdom, and hath made Me one of His Apostles.'\"(45)    And now ponder in thy heart the commotion which God stirreth up. Reflect  upon the strange and manifold trials with which He doth test His servants.  Consider how He hath suddenly chosen from among His servants, and  entrusted with the exalted mission of divine guidance Him Who was known as  guilty of homicide, Who, Himself, had acknowledged His cruelty, and Who  for well-nigh thirty years had, in the eyes of the world, been reared in  the home of Pharaoh and been nourished at his table. Was not God, the  omnipotent King, able to withhold the hand of Moses from murder, so that  manslaughter should not be attributed unto Him, causing bewilderment and  aversion among the people?    Likewise, reflect upon the state and condition of Mary. So deep was the  perplexity of that most beauteous countenance, so grievous her case, that  she bitterly regretted she had ever been born. To this beareth witness the  text of the sacred verse wherein it is mentioned that after Mary had given  birth to Jesus, she bemoaned her plight and cried out: \"O would that I had  died ere this, and been a thing forgotten, forgotten quite!\"(46) I swear  by God! Such lamenting consumeth the heart and shaketh the being. Such  consternation of soul, such despondency, could have been caused by no  other than the censure of the enemy and the cavilings of the infidel and  perverse. Reflect, what answer could Mary have given to the people around  her? How could she claim that a Babe Whose father was unknown had been  conceived of the Holy Ghost? Therefore did Mary, that veiled and immortal  Countenance, take up her Child and return unto her home. No sooner had the  eyes of the people fallen upon her than they raised their voice saying: \"O  sister of Aaron! Thy father was not a man of wickedness, nor unchaste thy  mother.\"(47)    And now, meditate upon this most great convulsion, this grievous test.  Notwithstanding all these things, God conferred upon that essence of the  Spirit, Who was known amongst the people as fatherless, the glory of  Prophethood, and made Him His testimony unto all that are in heaven and on  earth.    Behold how contrary are the ways of the Manifestations of God, as ordained  by the King of creation, to the ways and desires of men! As thou comest to  comprehend the essence of these divine mysteries, thou wilt grasp the  purpose of God, the divine Charmer, the Best-Beloved. Thou wilt regard the  words and the deeds of that almighty Sovereign as one and the same; in  such wise that whatsoever thou dost behold in His deeds, the same wilt  thou find in His sayings, and whatsoever thou dost read in His sayings,  that wilt thou recognize in His deeds. Thus it is that outwardly such  deeds and words are the fire of vengeance unto the wicked, and inwardly  the waters of mercy unto the righteous. Were the eye of the heart to open,  it would surely perceive that the words revealed from the heaven of the  will of God are at one with, and the same as, the deeds that have emanated  from the Kingdom of divine power.    And now, take heed, O brother! If such things be revealed in this  Dispensation, and such incidents come to pass, at the present time, what  would the people do? I swear by Him Who is the true Educator of mankind  and the Revealer of the Word of God that the people would instantly and  unquestionably pronounce Him an infidel and would sentence Him to death.  How far are they from hearkening unto the voice that declareth: Lo! a  Jesus hath appeared out of the breath of the Holy Ghost, and a Moses  summoned to a divinely-appointed task! Were a myriad voices to be raised,  no ear would listen if We said that upon a fatherless Child hath been  conferred the mission of Prophethood, or that a murderer hath brought from  the flame of the burning Bush the message of \"Verily, verily, I am God!\"    If the eye of justice be opened, it will readily recognize, in the light  of that which hath been mentioned, that He, Who is the Cause and ultimate  Purpose of all these things, is made manifest in this day. Though similar  events have not occurred in this Dispensation, yet the people still cling  to such vain imaginings as are cherished by the reprobate. How grievous  the charges brought against Him! How severe the persecutions inflicted  upon Him--charges and persecutions the like of which men have neither seen  nor heard!    Great God! When the stream of utterance reached this stage, We beheld, and  lo! the sweet savours of God were being wafted from the dayspring of  Revelation, and the morning breeze was blowing out of the Sheba of the  Eternal. Its tidings rejoiced anew the heart, and imparted immeasurable  gladness to the soul. It made all things new, and brought unnumbered and  inestimable gifts from the unknowable Friend. The robe of human praise can  never hope to match Its noble stature, and Its shining figure the mantle  of utterance can never fit. Without word It unfoldeth the inner mysteries,  and without speech It revealeth the secrets of the divine sayings. It  teacheth lamentation and moaning to the nightingales warbling upon the  bough of remoteness and bereavement, instructeth them in the art of love's  ways, and showeth them the secret of heart-surrender. To the flowers of  the Ridvan of heavenly reunion It revealeth the endearments of the  impassioned lover, and unveileth the charm of the fair. Upon the anemones  of the garden of love It bestoweth the mysteries of truth, and within the  breasts of lovers It entrusteth the symbols of the innermost subtleties.  At this hour, so liberal is the outpouring of Its grace that the holy  Spirit itself is envious! It hath imparted to the drop the waves of the  sea, and endowed the mote with the splendour of the sun. So great are the  overflowings of Its bounty that the foulest beetle hath sought the perfume  of the musk, and the bat the light of the sun. It hath quickened the dead  with the breath of life, and caused them to speed out of the sepulchres of  their mortal bodies. It hath established the ignorant upon the seats of  learning, and elevated the oppressor to the throne of justice.    The universe is pregnant with these manifold bounties, awaiting the hour  when the effects of Its unseen gifts will be made manifest in this world,  when the languishing and sore athirst will attain the living Kawthar of  their Well-Beloved, and the erring wanderer, lost in the wilds of  remoteness and nothingness, will enter the tabernacle of life, and attain  reunion with his heart's desire. In the soil of whose heart will these  holy seeds germinate? From the garden of whose soul will the blossoms of  the invisible realities spring forth?

Thou seest, therefore, O Thou Beloved of the world, Him Who is dear to  Thee in the clutches of such as have denied Thee, and beholdest Thy  heart's desire under the swords of the ungodly. Methinks He, from His most  exalted station, saith unto me: \"Would that my soul, O Prisoner, could be  a ransom for Thy captivity, and my being, O wronged One, be sacrificed for  the adversities Thou didst suffer! Thou art He through Whose captivity the  standards of Thine almighty power were hoisted, and the day-star of Thy  revelation shone forth above the horizon of tribulation, in such wise that  all created things bowed down before the greatness of Thy majesty.    \"The more they strove to hinder Thee from remembering Thy God and from  extolling His virtues, the more passionately didst Thou glorify Him and  the more loudly didst Thou call upon Him. And every time the veils of the  perverse came in between Thee and Thy servants, Thou didst shed the  splendors of the light of Thy countenance out of the heaven of Thy grace.  Thou art, in very truth, the Self-Subsisting as testified by the tongue of  God, the All-Glorious, the one alone Beloved; and Thou art the Desire of  the world as attested by what hath flowed down from the Pen of Him Who  hath announced unto Thy servants Thy hidden Name, and adorned the entire  creation with the ornament of Thy love, the Most Precious, the Most  Exalted.    \"The eyes of the world were gladdened at the sight of Thy luminous  countenance, and yet the peoples have united to put out Thy light, O Thou  in Whose hands are the reins of the worlds! All the atoms of the earth  have celebrated Thy praise, and all created things have been set ablaze  with the drops sprinkled by the ocean of Thy love, and yet the people  still seek to quench Thy fire. Nay--and to this Thine own Self beareth me  witness--they are all weakness, and Thou, verily, art the All-Powerful; and  they are but paupers and Thou, in truth, art the All-Possessing; and they  are impotent and Thou art, truly, the Almighty. Naught can ever frustrate  Thy purpose, neither can the dissensions of the world harm Thee. Through  the breaths of Thine utterance the heaven of understanding hath been  adorned, and by the effusions of Thy pen every moldering bone hath been  quickened. Grieve not at what hath befallen Thee, neither do Thou lay hold  on them for the things they have committed in Thy days. Do Thou be  forbearing toward them. Thou art the Ever-Forgiving, the Most  Compassionate.\"            XXXIII: \"PRAISE BE UNTO THEE, O MY GOD! THOU ART HE...\"      Praise be unto Thee, O my God! Thou art He Who by a word of His mouth hath  revolutionized the entire creation, and by a stroke of His pen hath  divided Thy servants one from another. I bear witness, O my God, that  through a word spoken by Thee in this Revelation all created things were  made to expire, and through yet another word all such as Thou didst wish  were, by Thy grace and bounty, endued with new life.    I render Thee thanks, therefore, and extol Thee, in the name of all them  that are dear to Thee, for that Thou hast caused them to be born again, by  reason of the living waters which have flowed down out of the mouth of Thy  will. Since Thou didst quicken them by Thy bounteousness, O my God, make  them steadfastly inclined, through Thy graciousness, towards Thy will; and  since Thou didst suffer them to enter into the Tabernacle of Thy Cause,  grant by Thy grace that they may not be kept back from Thee.    Unlock, then, to their hearts, O my God, the portals of Thy knowledge,  that they may recognize Thee as One Who is far above the reach and ken of  the understanding of Thy creatures, and immeasurably exalted above the  strivings of Thy people to hint at Thy nature, and may not follow every  clamorous impostor that presumeth to speak in Thy name. Enable them,  moreover, O my Lord, to cleave so tenaciously to Thy Cause that they may  remain unmoved by the perplexing suggestions of them who, prompted by  their desires, utter what hath been forbidden unto them in Thy Tablets and  Thy Scriptures.    Thou art well aware, O my Lord, that I hear the howling of the wolves  which appear in Thy servants' clothing. Keep safe, therefore, Thy loved  ones from their mischief, and enable them to cling steadfastly to  whatsoever hath been manifested by Thee in this Revelation, which no other  Revelation within Thy knowledge hath excelled.    Do Thou destine for them, O my Lord, that which will profit them.  Illumine, then, their eyes with the light of Thy knowledge, that they may  see Thee visibly supreme over all things, and resplendent amidst Thy  creatures, and victorious over all that are in Thy heaven and all that are  on Thy earth. Powerful art Thou to do Thy pleasure. No God is there but  Thee, the All-Glorious, Whose help is implored by all men.    Praised be Thou, Who art the Lord of all creation.            XXXIV: \"PRAISED BE THOU, O LORD MY GOD! I IMPLORE THEE...\"      Praised be Thou, O Lord my God! I implore Thee by Thine Ancient Beauty and  Most Great Name, Whom Thou hast sacrificed that all the dwellers of Thine  earth and heaven may be born anew, and Whom Thou hast cast into prison  that mankind may, as a token of Thy bounty and of Thy sovereign might, be  released from the bondage of evil passions and corrupt desires, to number  me with those who have so deeply inhaled the fragrance of Thy mercy, and  hastened with such speed unto the living waters of Thy grace, that no dart  could hinder them from turning unto Thee, nor any spear from setting their  faces towards the orient of Thy Revelation.    We testify, O my Lord, that Thou art God and that there is none other God  besides Thee. From everlasting Thou wast enthroned on the inaccessible  heights of Thy power, and wilt unto everlasting continue to exercise Thy  transcendent and unrestrained dominion. The hosts of the world are  powerless to frustrate Thy will, nor can all the dwellers of the earth and  all the inmates of heaven annul Thy decree. Thou truly art the Almighty,  the Most Exalted, the Most Great.    Bless, O my God, those of the followers of the Bayan as have been numbered  with the people of Baha, who have entered within the Crimson Ark in Thy  Name, the Most Exalted, the Most High. Thy might, verily, is equal to all  things.            XXXV: \"I GIVE PRAISE TO THEE, O LORD MY GOD! I ENTREAT...\"      I give praise to Thee, O Lord my God! I entreat Thee by Thy Name through  which Thou didst cause the dawn to appear, and the winds to blow, and the  seas to surge, and the trees to bring forth their fruits, and the earth to  be beautified with its rivers, that Thou wilt aid all them that are dear  to Thee with both Thy visible and invisible hosts. Render them, moreover,  victorious over all those who have so rebelled in Thy land, and dishonored  Thy name, and disbelieved in Thy signs, and broken Thy Covenant, and cast  behind their backs Thy laws, and have to such an extent risen up against  Thee, that they carried into captivity Thy kindred, and flung the  Manifestation of Thy Self into prison, and immured Him Who is the  Day-Spring of Thine Essence in the most desolate of cities.    Thou, O my Lord, art He whose strength is immense, Whose decree is  terrible. Lay hold on Thine adversaries by the power of Thy sovereignty,  and assemble Thy loved ones beneath the shadow of the tree of Thy oneness,  that they may stand before Thy throne, and catch the accents of Thy voice,  and gaze on Thy beauty, and discover the power of Thy might.    Thou art, verily, the All-Powerful, the Almighty.            XXXVI: \"LAUDED BE THY NAME, O MY GOD! I AM SO CARRIED...\"      Lauded be Thy name, O my God! I am so carried away by the breezes blowing  from Thy presence that I have forgotten my self and all that I possess.  This is but a sign of the wonders of Thy grace and bountiful favors  vouchsafed unto me. I give praise to Thee, O my God, that Thou hast chosen  me out of all Thy creatures, and made me to be the Day-Spring of Thy  strength and the Manifestation of Thy might, and empowered me to reveal  such of Thy signs and such tokens of Thy majesty and power as none,  whether in Thy heaven or on Thy earth, can produce.    I beseech Thee, O my Lord, by Thy most effulgent Name, to acquaint my  people with the things Thou didst destine for them. Do Thou, then,  preserve them within the stronghold of Thy guardianship and the tabernacle  of Thine unerring protection, lest through them may appear what will  divide Thy servants. Assemble them, O my Lord, on the shores of this  Ocean, every drop of which proclaimeth Thee to be God, besides Whom there  is none other God, the All-Glorious, the All-Wise.    Uncover before them, O my Lord, the majesty of Thy Cause, lest they be led  to doubt Thy sovereignty and the power of Thy might. I swear by Thy glory,  O Thou Who art the Beloved of the worlds! Had they been aware of Thy power  they would of a certainty have refused to utter what Thou didst not ordain  for them in the heaven of Thy will.    Inspire them, O my Lord, with a sense of their own powerlessness before  Him Who is the Manifestation of Thy Self, and teach them to recognize the  poverty of their own nature in the face of the manifold tokens of Thy  self-sufficiency and riches, that they may gather together round Thy  Cause, and cling to the hem of Thy mercy, and cleave to the cord of the  good-pleasure of Thy will.    Thou art the Lord of the worlds, and of all those who show mercy, art the  Most Merciful.            XXXVII: \"GLORY BE TO THEE, O KING OF ETERNITY, AND THE...\"      Glory be to Thee, O King of eternity, and the Maker of nations, and the  Fashioner of every moldering bone! I pray Thee, by Thy Name through which  Thou didst call all mankind unto the horizon of Thy majesty and glory, and  didst guide Thy servants to "]]]
