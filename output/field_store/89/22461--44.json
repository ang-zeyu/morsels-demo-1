There was, then, no reason for           differentiating between the two temples, as, for instance, by           calling the one that had been removed [Greek: o archaios neôs],           because the one that had been removed was no longer in           existence. That the designation [Greek: archaios (palaios) neôs]           is applicable to the Erechtheion has been accepted for many           years and has been explained anew by Petersen.[27] If the temple           burnt by the Persians had continued to exist alongside of the           Parthenon, one might doubt whether it or the Erechtheion was           meant by the expression [Greek: o archaios neôs], but if one of           the two temples was no longer in existence, the name must belong           to the other. It is just possible that in Hesychios, [Greek:           Ecatompedos neôs en te acropolis te Parthenè cataskeuastheis upo           Athenaiôn, meixôn tou empresthentos upa tôn Persôn posi           penteconta], the expression [Greek: tou empresthentos upo tôn           Persôn posi penteconta (neô or possibly Ecatompedon neô)] was           originally chosen because the expression [Greek: archaiou neô]           (which would otherwise be very appropriate here) was regularly           used to designate the Erechtheion.[28]             [Footnote 26: Or [Greek: to Ecatompedon]. Even after Dörpfeld's           arguments, I cannot believe that any great difference in the           use of the two expressions can be found.]             [Footnote 27: _Mitth_., XII, p. 63 ff. Comparison of modern           with ancient instances is frequently misleading, but sometimes           furnishes a useful illustration. There is in Boston, Mass., a           church called the _Old South_ church. This became too small and           too inconvenient for its congregation, so a new church was           built in a distant part of the city. The intention then was to           destroy the old building, in which case the new one (though new           and in a different part of the city) would have been called the           Old South church. The old building was, however, preserved, and           the new one now goes by the name of the New Old South church,           though I have also heard it called the Old South in spite of           the continued existence of the old building. So the new           building of the Erechtheion retained the name [Greek: archaios           neôs] which had belonged to its predecessor on the same spot.]             [Footnote 28: LOLLING (p. 638 ff.) discusses the measurements           of the Parthenon and the old Hekatompedon, and finds a slight           inaccuracy in the statement of Hesychios. He thinks, however,           (p. 641) that Hesychios would not compare the two unless they           had both been standing at the same time. Possibly any           inaccuracy may be accounted for by the fact that the older           temple was no longer standing when the comparison was first           made. Possibly, too, the name Hekatompedon was not originally           meant to be taken quite literally, but rather, as Curtitis,           _Stadtgeschichte,_ p. 72, seems to think, as a proud           designation of a grand new building.]    Page 14  At the end of his last article on this subject, Dörpfeld calls           attention to the fact that \"not only the lower step           (_Unterstufe_) of the temple, but also a stone of the stylobate           are still in their old position, and several stylobate-stones           are still lying about upon the temple,\" and says that the whole           stylobate, with the exception of the part cut away by the           Erechtheion, must therefore have existed in Roman times. I do           not see why quite so much is to be assumed. Even granting that           we know the exact level of the surface of the Acropolis in           classical times at every point, we certainly do not know all           the objects--votive offerings and the like--set up in various           places. Some small part of the stylobate of the ruined temple           may have been used as a foundation for some group of statuary           or other offering,[29] or a fragment of the building itself may           have been left as a reminder to future generations of the           devastations of the barbarians. The existence of these stones           is called by Dörpfeld \"a fact hitherto insufficiently           considered\" (_eine bisher nicht genügend bechtete Thatsache_).           I cannot believe that the fact would have remained so long           \"insufficiently considered\" by Dörpfeld and others if it were           really in itself a sufficient proof that the pre-Persian temple           continued in existence until the end of ancient Athens. If I am           right in thinking that the temple did not exist during the last           centuries of classical antiquity, it must have ceased to exist           when the Parthenon was completed. Dörpfeld is certainly           justified in saying[30] that \"he who concedes the continued  Page 15  existence of the temple until the end of the fourth century has           no right to let the temple disappear in silence later\" (_darf           den Tempel nicht spater ohne weiteres verschwinden lassen_).             [Footnote 29: Whether the present condition of the stone of the           stylobate still _in situ_ favors this conjecture, is for those           on the spot to decide. It looks in Dörpfeld's plans (_Ant.           Denkm.,_ i, I, and _Mitth.,_ XI, p. 337) as if it had a hole in           it, such as are found in the pedestals of statues.]             [Footnote 30: _Mitth.,_ xv, 438. This is directed against the           closing paragraph of Lolling's article, where he says: \"We           cannot determine exactly when this (the removal of the temple)           happened, but it seems that the temple no longer existed in the           times of Plutarch,\" _etc._]             In the above discussion I have purposely passed over some           points because I wished to confine myself to what was           necessary. So I have not reviewed in detail the passages           containing the expression [Greek: archaios (palaios) neôs],           as they have been sufficiently discussed by others. So, too,           I have omitted all mention of the [Greek: megaron ta pros           esperan tetrammenon],[31] the [Greek: parastades],[32] the           passages in Homer,[33] Aristophanes,[34] and some other           writers, because these references and allusions, being more           or less uncertain or indefinite, may be (and have been)           explained, according to the wish of the interpreter, as           evidence for or against the continued existence of the temple           burnt by the Persians. Those who agree with me will interpret           the passages in question accordingly.             To recapitulate briefly, I hope that I have shown: (1) that           Pausanias does not mention the temple excavated in 1886, and           (2) that the existence of that temple during the latter part of           the fifth and the fourth centuries is not proved. I believe           that the temple continued to exist in some form until the           completion of the Parthenon, but this belief is founded not so           much upon documentary evidence as upon the consideration that           the Athenians and their goddess must have had a treasure-house           during the time from the Persian invasion to the completion of           the Parthenon; especially after the treasure of the confederacy           of Delos was moved to Athens in 454 B.C. As soon, however, as           the Parthenon was completed, the temple burnt by the Persians           was removed. This was before the fire of 406 B.C. The fire,           therefore, injured, as has been supposed hitherto, the           Erechtheion. The opisthodomos, which was injured by fire at           some time not definitely ascertained (but probably not very far           from the date of the fire in the Erechtheion), was the           opisthodomos of the Parthenon.             [Footnote 31: HEROD, v, 77.]             [Footnote 32: _CIA_, II, 733, 735, 708.]             [Footnote 33: _Od._, VII. 80 f.; _Il._, II. 546 ff. _Mitth._,           XII, pp. 26, 62, 207.]             [Footnote 34: PLUT., 1191 ff. _cf. Mitth._, XII., pp. 69, 206.]             It will, I hope, be observed, that I do not claim to have           _proved_ the non-existence of the earlier temple after the           completion of the Parthenon. All I claim is that its existence  Page 16  is not proved. Now if, as I hope I have shown, the temple is           not mentioned by Pausanias,[35] and there is no reasonable           likelihood of its silent disappearance between 435 B.C. and the           time of Pausanias, the probabilities are in favor of its           disappearance about 435 B.C., when it was supplanted by the           Parthenon. No one, however, would welcome more gladly than I           any further evidence either for or against its continued           existence.             HAROLD N. FOWLER.           _Exeter, New Hampshire_, March, 1892.             [Footnote 35: The fact that Pausanias does not mention this           temple is not a certain proof that he might not have seen it,           for he fails to mention other things that certainly existed in           his day. This temple, however, if it then existed, must have           been in marked contrast to almost every other building in the           Acropolis, and would have had special attractions for a person           of Pausanias' archæological tastes.]               POSTSCRIPT.--This article had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2016"],[0,"The 1998 CIA World Factbook (#7)"],[1," Monseigneur Juan MARTI Alanis (since 31  January 1971); note-each coprince is represented by a veguer (French:  Jean-Pierre COURTOIS; Spanish: Francesc BADIA Battalla)  head of government: Executive Council President Marc FORNE Molne  (since 21 December 1994)  cabinet: Executive Council designated by the executive council  president  elections: executive council president elected by the General Council  and formally appointed by the coprinces; election last held 16  February 1997 (next to be held NA 2001)  election results: Marc FORNE Molne elected executive council  president; percent of General Council vote-NA    Legislative branch: unicameral General Council of the Valleys or  Consell General de las Valls (28 seats; members are elected by direct  popular vote, 14 from a single national constituency and 14 to  represent each of the 7 parishes; members serve four-year terms)  elections: last held 16 February 1997 (next to be held February 2001)  election results: percent of vote by party-UL 57%, AND 21%, IDN 7%, ND  7%, other 8%; seats by party-UL 16, AND 6, ND 2, IDN 2, UPO 2    Judicial branch: Supreme Court of Andorra at Perpignan (France) two  civil judges appointed by the veguers, one appeals judge appointed by  the coprinces alternately; Ecclesiastical Court of the Bishop of Seo  de Urgel (Spain); Tribunal of the Courts or Tribunal des Cortes  presided over by the two civil judges, one appeals judge, the veguers,  and two members of the General Council    Political parties and leaders: National Democratic Group or AND [Oscar  RIBAS Reig]; Liberal Union or UL [Francesc CERQUEDA]; New Democracy or  ND [Jaume BARTOMEU Cassany]; Andorran National Coalition or CNA  [Antoni CERQUEDA Gispert]; National Democratic Initiative or IDN  [Vincenc MATEU Zamora]; Liberal Party of Andorra (Partit Liberal  d'Andorra) or PLA [Marc FORNE]; Unio Parroquial d'Ordino or UDO  note: there are two other small parties    International organization participation: CE, ECE, ICRM, IFRCS,  Interpol, IOC, ITU, OSCE, UN, UNESCO, WHO, WIPO, WToO    Diplomatic representation in the US:  chief of mission: Ambassador Juli MINOVES-TRIQUELL (also Permanent  Representative to the UN)  chancery: 2 United Nations Plaza, 25th Floor, New York, NY 10017  telephone: [1] (212) 750-8064  FAX: [1] (212) 750-6630    Diplomatic representation from the US: the US does not have an embassy  in Andorra; US interests in Andorra are represented by the Consulate  General's office in Barcelona (Spain); mailing address: Paseo Reina  Elisenda, 23, 08034 Barcelona, Spain; telephone: (343) 280-2227; FAX:  (343) 205-7705; note-Consul General Maurice S.

An estimated 10 million  tourists visit annually, attracted by Andorra's duty-free status and  by its summer and winter resorts. Andorra's comparative advantage has  recently eroded as the economies of neighboring France and Spain have  been opened up, providing broader availability of goods and lower  tariffs. The banking sector, with its \"tax haven\" status, also  contributes substantially to the economy. Agricultural production is  limited by a scarcity of arable land, and most food has to be  imported. The principal livestock activity is sheep raising.  Manufacturing consists mainly of cigarettes, cigars, and furniture.  Andorra is a member of the EU Customs Union and is treated as an EU  member for trade in manufactured goods (no tariffs) and as a non-EU  member for agricultural products.

A cease-fire between the government and  (UNITA) lasted from 31 May 1991 until October 1992 when UNITA refused  to accept its defeat in internationally monitored elections and  fighting resumed throughout much of the country. The two sides signed  another peace accord on 20 November 1994 and the cease-fire is  generally holding, but military tensions and banditry persist. The  peace accord provided for the integration of former UNITA insurgents  into the Angolan armed forces and the government. A Government of  National Unity and Reconciliation was installed in April 1997 and  military integration was declared complete in June 1997, although  UNITA filled fewer than half of the military positions allocated to  the rebels. Efforts which began in May 1997 to extend government into  UNITA-occupied areas are proceeding slowly. The original 7,200-man UN  peacekeeping force began a phased drawdown in late 1996 and all UN  military components are scheduled to depart by 30 June 1998 except for  through 1998.    @Angola:Geography    Location: Southern Africa, bordering the South Atlantic Ocean, between  Namibia and Democratic Republic of the Congo    Geographic coordinates: 12 30 S, 18 30 E    Map references: Africa    Area:  total: 1,246,700 sq km  land: 1,246,700 sq km  water: 0 sq km    Area-comparative: slightly less than twice the size of Texas    Land boundaries:  total: 5,198 km  border countries: Democratic Republic of the Congo 2,511 km of which  220 km is the boundary of discontiguous Cabinda Province, Republic of  the Congo 201 km, Namibia 1,376 km, Zambia 1,110 km    Coastline: 1,600 km    Maritime claims:  exclusive fishing zone: 200 nm  territorial sea: 20 nm    Climate: semiarid in south and along coast to Luanda; north has cool,  dry season (May to October) and hot, rainy season (November to April)    Terrain: narrow coastal plain rises abruptly to vast interior plateau    Elevation extremes:  lowest point: Atlantic Ocean 0 m  highest point: Morro de Moco 2,620 m    Natural resources: petroleum, diamonds, iron ore, phosphates, copper,  feldspar, gold, bauxite, uranium    Land use:  arable land: 2%  permanent crops: 0%  permanent pastures: 23%  forests and woodland: 43%  other: 32% (1993 est.)
