An  outline of the most important of these movements is given in the second  part of this book.    But apart from these there is now an international organization that is  working for the adoption of an international auxiliary language, and a  brief account of it may be given here.    During the Paris Exhibition of 1900 a number of international congresses  and learned societies, which were holding meetings there, appointed  delegates for the consideration of the international language question.  These delegates met on January 17, 1901, and founded a \"Delegation for  the Adoption of an International Auxiliary Language.\" They drew up the  following declaration, which has been approved by all subsequently  elected delegates:           *       *       *       *       *       DELEGATION FOR THE ADOPTION OF AN INTERNATIONAL AUXILIARY LANGUAGE                                  Declaration    The undersigned, deputed by various Congresses and Societies to study  the question of an international auxiliary language, have agreed on the  following points:    (1) There is a necessity to choose and to spread the use of an  international language, designed not to replace national idioms in the  individual life of each people, but to serve in the written and oral  relations between persons whose mother-tongues are different.    (2) In order to fulfil its purpose usefully, an international language  must satisfy the following conditions:       1st Condition: It must fulfil the needs of the ordinary intercourse     of social life, of commercial communications, and of scientific and     philosophic relations;       2nd Condition: It must be easily acquired by every person of     average elementary education, and especially by persons of European     civilization;       3rd Condition: It must not be one of the national languages.    (3) It is desirable to organize a general DELEGATION representing  all who realize the necessity, as well as the possibility, of an  international auxiliary language, and who are interested in its  employment. This Delegation will appoint a Committee of members who can  meet during a certain period of time. The purpose of this Committee is  defined in the following articles.    (4) The choice of the auxiliary language belongs in the first instance  to the _International Association of Academies_, or, in case of failure,  to the Committee mentioned in Art. 3.    (5) Consequently the first duty of the Committee will be to present to  the _International Association of Academies_, in the required forms, the  desires expressed by the constituent Societies and Congresses, and to  invite it respectfully to realize the project of an auxiliary language.    (6) It will be the duty of the Committee to create a Society for  propaganda, to spread the use of the auxiliary language which is chosen.    (7) The undersigned, being delegated by various Congresses and  Societies, decide to approach all learned bodies, and all societies of  business men and tourists, in order to obtain their adhesion to the  present project.    (8) Representatives of regularly constituted Societies which have  agreed to the present _Declaration_ will be admitted as members of the  DELEGATION.           *       *       *       *       *    This declaration is the official programme of the Delegation. The most  important point of principle to note is Art. 2, 3rd Con.: \"It must not  be one of the national languages.\"    As regards the methods of action prescribed, no attempt is to be made  to bring direct pressure to bear upon any government. It was rightly  felt that the adoption of a universal language is a matter for private  initiative. No government can properly take up the question, no Ministry  of Education can officially introduce an auxiliary language into the  schools under its control, until the principle has met with a certain  amount of general recognition. The result of a direct appeal to any  government or governments could only have been, in the most favourable  case, the appointment by the government appealed to of a commission to  investigate and report on the question. Such a commission would examine  experts and witnesses from representative bodies, such as academies,  institutes, philological and other learned societies. The best course of  action, therefore, for the promoters of an international language is to  apply direct to such bodies, to bring the question before them and try  to gain their support. This is what the Delegation has done.    Now, there already exists an international organization whose object  is to represent and focus the opinion of learned societies in all  countries. This is the International Association of Academies, formed in  1900 for the express purpose, according to its statutes, of promoting  \"scientific enterprises of international interest.\" The delegates feel  that the adoption of an international language comes in the fullest  sense within the letter and spirit of this statute. It is, therefore,  to this Association that the choice of language is, in the first place,  left. (Art. 4.)    The Association meets triennially. At its first meeting (Paris 1901)  the question of international language was brought before it by General  Sébert, of the French Institute, but too late to be included among the  agenda of that meeting. The occasion was important as eliciting an  expression of opinion on the part of the signatories to General Sébert's  address. These included twenty-five members of the French Institute, one  of the most distinguished scientific bodies in the world.    At the second meeting of the Association (London 1904) the Delegation  did not officially present the question for discussion, but the  following paragraph appears in the report of the proceedings of the  Royal Society, which was the host (_London Royal Society_, 1904, C.  Section of Letters, Thursday, May 26, 1904, p. 33):    \"In the course of the sitting, the chairman (Lord Reay, President of  the British Academy) submitted to the meeting whether the question of  the 'International Auxiliary Language' should be considered, though  not included in the agenda. From many quarters applications had been  made that the subject might be discussed in some form or other. Prof.  Goldziher and M. Perrot spoke against the suggested discussion,  the former maintaining that the matter was a general question of  international communication, and did not specifically affect scientific  interests; the latter announced that he had been commissioned by the  _Académie des Inscriptions_ to oppose the consideration of this subject.  The matter then dropped.\"    The third meeting of the Association of Academies was held at Vienna  at the end of May 1907, under the auspices of the Vienna Academy of  Science. The question was officially laid before it by the Delegation.  The Association declared, for formal reasons, that the question did not  fall within its competence.[1]       [1]In the voting as to the inclusion of the question in the agenda,     eight votes were cast in favour of international language, and twelve     against. This considerable minority shows very encouraging progress     in such a body, considering the newness of the scheme.    Up till now only two national academies have shown themselves favourable  to the scheme, those of Vienna and Copenhagen.    The Vienna Academy commissioned one of its most eminent members,  Prof. Schuchardt, to watch the movement on its behalf, and to keep it  informed on the subject. In 1904 he presented a report favourable to  an international language. He and Prof. Jespersen are amongst the most  famous philologists who support the movement.    It is not therefore anticipated that the Association of Academies will  take up the question; and the Delegation, thinking it desirable not to  wait indefinitely till it is converted, has proceeded to the election  of a committee, as provided in Art. 4 of the Declaration. It consists  of twelve members, with powers to add to their number. It will meet in  Paris, October 5, 1907. It is anticipated that the language chosen will  be Esperanto. None of the members of this international committee are  English, all the English savants invited having declined.    What may be the practical effect of the choice made by this Committee  remains to be seen. In France there is a permanent Parliamentary  Commission for the consideration of questions affecting public  education. This Commission has for some time had before it a proposal  for the introduction of Esperanto into the State schools of France,  signed by twelve members of Parliament and referred by the House to  the Commission. This year the proposal has been presented again in a  different form. The text of the scheme, which is much more practical  than the former one, is as follows:    \"The study of the international language Esperanto will be included in  the curricula of those government schools in which modern languages are  already taught.    \"This study will be optional, and candidates who offer for the various  examinations English, German, Italian, Spanish, or Arabic, will be  allowed to offer Esperanto as an additional subject.    \"They will be entitled to the advantages enjoyed by candidates who offer  an additional language.\"    At present it is a very usual thing to offer an additional language, and  if this project passes, Esperanto will be on exactly the same footing as  other languages for this purpose. The project of recognizing Esperanto  as a principal language for examination was entirely impracticable. It  is far too easy, and would merely have become a \"soft option\" and a  refuge"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16751"],[0,"McGuffey's Sixth Eclectic Reader (#7)"],[1,"emphasized.        EXAMPLES. (38)    1. Cassius. Must I endure all this?     Brutus. All this!--Ay,--more. Fret, till your proud--heart--break.    2. What! weep you when you but behold     Our Caesar's vesture wounded? Look ye here,     Here is himself, marred, as you see, by traitors.    3. There was a time, my fellow-citizens, when the Lacedaemonians were  sovereign masters, both by sea and by land; while this state had not one  ship--no, NOT--ONE--WALL.    4. Shall I, the conqueror of Spain and Gaul; and not only of the Alpine  nations, but of the Alps themselves; shall I compare myself with this  HALF--YEAR--CAPTAIN?    5. You call me misbeliever--cutthroat--dog.     Hath a dog--money? Is it possible--     A cur can lend three--thousand--ducats?        EMPHATIC PAUSE. (39)    A short pause is often made before or after, and sometimes both before and  after, an emphatic word or phrase,--thus very much increasing the emphatic  expression of the thought.    EXAMPLES. (39)    1. May one be pardoned, and retain--the offense?     In the corrupted currents of this world,     Offense's gilded hand may shove by--justice;     And oft 'tis seen, the wicked prize itself     Buys out the law: but 't is not so--above:     There--is no shuffling: there--the action lies     In its true nature.    2.

This--is no flattery: These--are counselors     That feelingly persuade me what I am.    4. And this--our life, exempt from public haunt,     Finds tongues--in tree, books--in the running brooks,     Sermons--in stones, and--good in everything.    5. Heaven gave this Lyre, and thus decreed,     Be thou a bruised--but not a broken--reed.        IV. INSTRUCTIONS FOR READING VERSE. (39)    INFLECTIONS.    In reading verse, the inflections should be nearly the same as in reading  prose; the chief difference is, that in poetry, the monotone and rising  inflection are more frequently used than in prose. The greatest difficulty  in reading this species of composition, consists in giving it that  measured flow which distinguishes it from prose, without falling into a  chanting pronunciation.    If, at any time, the reader is in doubt as to the proper inflection, let  him reduce the passage to earnest conversation, and pronounce it in the  most familiar and prosaic manner, and thus he will generally use the  proper inflection.      EXERCISES IN INFLECTION. (40)    1. Meanwhile the south wind rose, and with black wings     Wide hovering', all the clouds together drove     From under heaven': the hills to their supply',     Vapor and exhalation dusk and moist     Sent up amain': and now, the thickened sky     Like a dark ceiling stood': down rushed the rain     Impetuous', and continued till the earth     No more was seen': the floating vessel swam     Uplifted', and, secure with beake'd prow',     Rode tilting o'er the waves'.      2. My friend', adown life's valley', hand in hand',       With grateful change of grave and merry speech       Or song', our hearts unlocking each to each',     We'll journey onward to the silent land';     And when stern death shall loose that loving band,       Taking in his cold hand, a hand of ours',       The one shall strew the other's grave with flowers',     Nor shall his heart a moment be unmanned'.     My friend and brother'! if thou goest first',       Wilt thou no more revisit me below'?     Yea, when my heart seems happy causelessly',       And swells', not dreaming why', my soul shall know     That thou', unseen', art bending over me'.      3. Here rests his head upon the lap of earth',       A youth, to fortune and to fame unknown';     Fair Science frowned not on his humble birth',       And Melancholy marked him for her own'.      4. Large was his bounty', and his soul sincere',       Heaven did a recompense as largely send';     He gave to misery (all he had) a tear',       He gained from heaven' ('t was all he wished') a friend'.      5. No further seek his merits to disclose',       Or draw his frailties from their dread abode';     (There they alike' in trembling hope repose',)       The bosom of his Father, and his God'.        ACCENT AND EMPHASIS. (41)    In reading verse, every syllable must have the same accent, and every word  the same emphasis as in prose; and whenever the melody or music of the  verse would lead to an incorrect accent or emphasis, this must be  disregarded.    If a poet has made his verse deficient in melody, this must not be  remedied by the reader, at the expense of sense or the established rules  of accent and quantity. Take the following:    EXAMPLE. (41)       O'er shields, and helms, and helme'd heads he rode,     Of thrones, and mighty Seraphim prostrate    According to the metrical accent, the last word must be pronounced  \"pros-trate'.\" But according to the authorized pronunciation it is  \"pros'trate. Which shall yield, the poet or established usage? Certainly  not the latter.    Some writers advise a compromise of the matter, and that the word should  he pronounced without accenting either syllable. Sometimes this may be  done, but where it is not practiced, the prosaic reading should be  preserved.    In the following examples, the words and syllables which are improperly  accented or emphasized in the poetry, are marked in italics. According to  the principle stated above, the reader should avoid giving them that  pronunciation which the correct rending of the poetry would require, but  should read them as prose, except where he can throw off all accent and  thus compromise the conflict between the poetic reading and the correct  reading. That is, he must read the poetry wrong, in order to read the  language right.      EXAMPLES. (42)    1. Ask of thy mother earth why oaks are made     Taller and stronger than the weeds they shade.    2. Their praise is still, \"the style is excellent,\"     The sense they humbly take upon content.    3. False eloquence, like the prismatic glass,     Its fairy colors spreads on every place.    4. To do aught good, never will be our task,     But ever to do ill is our sole delight.    5. Of all the causes which combine to blind     Man's erring judgment, and mislead the mind,     What the weak head with strongest bias rules     Is pride, the never-failing vice of fools.    6. Eye Nature's walks, shoot folly as it flies,     And catch the manners living as they rise.    7. To whom then, first incensed, Adam replied,     \"Is this thy love, is this the recompense     Of mine to thee, ungrateful Eve?\"    8. We may, with more successful hope, resolve     To wage, by force or guile, successful war,     Irreconcilable to our grand foe,     Who now triumphs, and in excess of joy     Sole reigning holds the tyranny of Heaven.    9. Which, when Beelzebub perceived (than whom,     Satan except, none higher sat), with grave     Aspect, he rose, and in his rising seemed     A pillar of state.    10. Thee, Sion, and the flowery brooks beneath,      That wash thy hallowed feet, and warbling flow,      Nightly I visit: nor sometimes forget,      Those other two equaled with me in fate.    NOTE.--Although it would be necessary, in these examples, to violate the  laws of accent or emphasis, to give perfect rhythm, yet a careful and  well-trained reader will be able to observe these laws and still give the  rhythm in such a manner that the defect will scarcely be noticed.    POETIC PAUSES. (43)    In order to make the measure of poetry perceptible to the ear, there  should generally be a slight pause at the end of each line, even where the  sense does not require it.    There is, also, in almost every line of poetry, a pause at or near its  middle, which is called the caesura.    This should, however, never be so placed as to injure the sense of the  passage. It is indeed reckoned a great beauty, where it naturally  coincides with the pause required by the sense. The caesura, though  generally placed near the middle, may be placed at other intervals.    There are sometimes, also, two additional pauses in each line, called  demi-caesuras.    The caesura is marked (||), and the demi-caesura thus, (|), in the  examples given.    There should be a marked accent upon the long syllable next preceding  the caesura, and a slighter one upon that next before each of the  demi-caesuras. When made too prominent, these pauses lead to a singsong  style, which should be carefully avoided.    In the following examples, the caesura is marked in each line; the  demi-caesura is not marked in every case.      EXAMPLES. (44)    1. Nature | to all things || fixed | the limits fit,     And wisely | curbed || proud man's | pretending wit.    2. Then from his closing eyes || thy form shall part,     And the last pang || shall tear thee from his heart.    3. Warms in the sun, || refreshes in the breeze,     Glows in the stars, || and blossoms in the trees.    4. There is a land || of every land the pride,     Beloved by Heaven || o'er all the world beside,     Where brighter suns || dispense serener light,     And milder moons || imparadise the night;     Oh, thou shalt find, || howe'er thy footsteps roam,     That land--thy country, || and that spot--thy home.    5. In slumbers | of midnight || the sailor | boy lay;       His hammock | swung loose || at the sport | of the wind;     But, watch-worn | and weary, || his cares | flew away,       And visions | of happiness || danced | o'er his mind.    6. She said, | and struck; || deep entered | in her side     The piercing steel, || with reeking purple dyed:     Clogged | in the wound || the cruel | weapon stands,     The spouting blood || came streaming o'er her hands.     Her sad attendants || saw the deadly stroke,     And with loud cries || the sounding palace shook.        SIMILE.
