Frankly, they were not  beautiful, even at that stage; and a fortnight before, when they had  been larger than the eggs they had come out of, they were positively  reptilian and repulsive.    Blackie said the blackbird equivalent to \"Be quiet, you little fools!\"  as quietly and as sternly as he could three or four times, and perched  on the top of a wheelbarrow to watch the gray shadow which was a cat.  That sudden death, however, was more afraid of the open than Blackie,  even, and, moreover, wasn't expecting blackbirds' nests in the middle  of fields.  It turned back; and at length Mrs. Blackie, who had been on  a general survey round about to see what foes of the night were on the  move--and a fine hubbub she had made in the process--came home,  reporting all well.    Then they slept; at least, they ceased to be any further seen or heard.  Think, however, how you would sleep if every few minutes you could hear  sounds in your house one-third of which were probably the noises of a  burglar.  Think, also, how you would feel if you knew that that burglar  was a murderer, and that that murderer was, in all likelihood, looking  for you, or some one just like you.  Yet those birds were happy enough,  I fancy.    It was barely pale gray.  It was cold and wan and washed, and  wonderfully clean and sweet, and wet with dews, when a lark climbed  invisibly into the sky and suddenly burst into song, next morning.  There was something strange and out of place, in a way, in this song,  breaking out of the night; and as it and another continued to break the  utter silence for ten minutes, it seemed rather as if it were still  night, and not really dawn at all.  Dawn appeared to be waiting for  something else to give it authority, so to speak, and at the end of ten  minutes that something else came--the slim form of Blackie, streaking,  phantom-like, through the mist from the trench out in the field to the  summer-house in the garden.  Here, mounted upon the very top, he stood  for a moment, as one clearing his throat before blowing a bugle, and  then, full, rich, deep, and flute-like, he lazily gave out the first  bars of his song.  Instantly, almost as if it had been a signal, a  great tit-mouse sang out, \"Tzur ping-ping! tzur ping-ping!\" in  metallic, ringing notes; a thrush struck in with his brassy, clarion  challenge, thrush after thrush taking it up, till, with the clear  warble of robin and higher, squeaking notes of hedge-sparrow and wren  joining in, the wonderful first bars of the Dawn Hymn of the birds  rolled away over the fields to the faraway woods, and beyond.    Blackie sang on for a bit, in spite of the fact that people said that  it was not considered \"the thing\" for a blackbird with such domestic  responsibilities to sing.  And two other blackbirds helped him to break  the man-made rule.    As a matter of fact, I fancy he was not taking chances upon the ground  while the mist hung to cover late night prowlers, for as soon as the  gay and gaudy chaffinches had stuck themselves up in the limes and the  sycamores, and started their own smashing idea of song, he was down  upon the lawn giving the early worm a bad time.    Then it was that he heard a rumpus that shot him erect, and sent his  extraordinarily conspicuous orange dagger of a beak darting from side  to side in that jerky way of listening that many birds affect.    \"Twet-twet-et-et-et! twet! twet-twet-twet-et-et-twet!\" came the  unmistakable voice of one in a temper, scolding loudly.  And he knew  that scold--had heard it before, by Jove!  And who should know it if  not he, since it was the voice of his wife?    Perhaps he heaved a sigh as he rose from the deliciously cool, wet  lawn--where it was necessary to take long, high hops if you wanted to  avoid getting drenched--and winged his way towards the riot.  His wife  was calling him, and it came from the other side of the garden, _her_  side, behind the house.  Perhaps it was a cat, or a rat, or something.  Anything, almost, would set her on like that if experience, plus the  experience of blackbirds for hundreds of generations working blindly in  her brain--and not the experience of books--had taught her that the  precise creature whom she saw was a danger and a menace to young  blackbirds.    All the same, when Blackie arrived he _was_ surprised, for all that he  saw was a grayish bird with \"two lovely black eyes,\" not by any means  as large as a blackbird.  When it flew it kept low, with a weak and  peculiar flight that was deceiving; and when Mrs. Blackie, following  it, and yelling like several shrews, got too close, it turned its head,  and said, \"Wark! wark!\" in a harsh and warning way.    Blackie joined in with his deeper \"Twoit-twoit-twoit!\" just by way of  lending official dignity to the proceedings.  Whereupon his wife,  feeling that he had backed her up, redoubled her excitement and shrill  abuse.    And they spent two solid hours at this fool's game, helped by a robin,  a blue tit, and a chaffinch or two--the chaffinch must have his finger  in every pie--following that gray bird from nowhere, while it moved  about the garden in its shuffling flight, or alternately sat and  scowled at them.  But it must be admitted that Blackie himself looked  rather bored, and might have gone off for breakfast any time, if he had  dared.    As a matter of fact, however, the bird did not stand upon the Register  of Bad Deeds as being a terror of even the mildest kind of blackbirds.  Red-backed shrike was her name, female was her sex, and from Africa had  she come.  Goodness knows where she was going, but not far, probably;  and the largest thing in the bird line she appeared able to tackle was  something of the chaffinch size.  But, all the same, Mrs. Blackie  seemed jolly well certain that she knew better.    Then arrived the bombshell.    One of the Blackie youngsters, stump-tailed, frog-mouthed, blundering,  foolish, gawky, and squawking, landed, all of a heap, right into the  very middle of the picnic-party.    Mrs. Blackie very nearly had a fit on the spot, and the shrike judged  that the time had about arrived for her to quit that vicinity.    Blackie himself, to do him justice, kept cool enough to do nothing.  Wives will say that he was just husband all over, but there were  reasons abroad.  One of them shot past Blackie, who was low down, a  second later and a yard away, and had he not been absolutely still, and  therefore as invisible as one of the most conspicuous of birds in the  wild can be, he would have known in that instant, or the next, what  lies upon the other side of death.    Another reason shot through the lower hedge, and, both together, they  fell upon the young bird.    They were the cat of the house and her half-grown kitten, and they were  upon the unhappy youngster before you could shout, \"Murder!\"    What followed was painful.  Mrs. Blackie went clean demented.  Blackie  went--not so demented.  (It always appeared to me that his was a more  practical mind than his wife's, perhaps because he wore a more  conspicuous livery.)  Mrs. Blackie kept passing and repassing the cats'  backs, flying from bough to bough, and sometimes touching and sometimes  not touching them.  It was useless, of course, this pathetic charging;  and it was foolish.    Blackie charged, too, but not within feet.    Suddenly the old cat, who had had one eye upon Mrs. Blackie the whole  time, sprang up and struck quickly twice.  There was a chain of shrieks  from Mrs. Blackie, and down she went in the grip of the clawed death.  She never got up again.    What had happened was simple enough.  One of the laborers working on  the trench, knowing of the nest, had, out of curiosity, approached a  little too close, when the bevy of youngsters, being ready to fly, but  not knowing it before this great fright, burst apart at his approach  like a silent cannon cracker.  The fear showed them they could use  their wings.    All three had made, flying low and weakly, for the nearest hedge, which  was the garden hedge--two to the side which comprised their father's  hunting-ground, and one to the side dominated by their ma.  And the old  cat and her kitten had seen them coming, and had given chase.          *      *      *      *      *      *    Blackie discovered his remaining progeny sitting about in bushes,  squawking, a few minutes later, when he returned, somewhat agitated to  his precious lawn, and there he promptly proceeded to feed them.  The  task was such a large one, and took so long, and so many worms had to  be cut up, and so much bread, and, I may say, when all else failed, so  many daisies had to be picked, before he finally silenced their  ceaseless, craving remarks, that, by the time he had finished feeding  himself and had a clean up, something of the pain of the tragedy had  gone from him.    And fine fat blackbirds he made of those youngsters, too, in the end, I  want to tell you, for he stuck to 'em like a brick.          III    UNDER THE YELLOW FLAG    A little past noon each day the sun covered a crack between two boards  on the summer-house floor, and up through that aperture, for three  days, had come a leggy, racy-looking, wolfish black spider.  Each day,  as it grew hotter, she extended her sphere of jerky investigation,  vanishing down the crack again when the sun passed from it.    To-day she prolonged her roamings right up the wall of the summer-house  and along a joist bare of all save dust, and--well, the spider walked  straight on, moving with little jerks as if by intermittent clockwork,  and she seemed to stroll right on top of the wasp lying curled up on  her side.  Only when one of the latter's delicate feelers shifted round  towards her, as though in some uncanny way conscious of her approach,  did she leap back as if she had touched an electric wire.  Then she  froze--flat.  The wasp was lying curled up, as we have said, upon her  side, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17571"],[0,"Piano Tuning: A Simple and Accurate Method for Amateurs (#7)"],[1,"the pick in the felt just back of the point and  this will loosen it up and make it softer and more elastic. Where the  strings have worn deep grooves, sandpaper them down nearly even and  soften the felt as above.    In regluing the felt to the head, glue only the back ends of the felt,  and clamp with strong rubber band till the glue sets. Use tailor's  chalk (fuller's earth) to clean hammer felts. To harden or draw felts  back in shape, place a damp cloth over them, and then pass a hot iron  over it.    10. _Dampers_.--Damper felt often gets hardened so that when it comes  against the vibrating string, it causes a sort of buzzing sound.  Loosen it up with the pick. Imperfect damping can sometimes be  corrected in the same way.    The damper head sometimes turns round on its wire, leaving one or two  strings undamped. Tighten the set screw. See that the dampers are in  line; and that they will stop the tone properly when the key is  released.    Damper springs sometimes break. It is necessary to take out the damper  lever to put in a new one.    See that the spoons are in line and work properly. Press the  sustaining pedal down, and see if all the dampers are in line; if not,  bend the damper wires with the regulator until they line up perfectly.    11. _Damper Rod_.--When the sustaining pedal squeaks, look first to  the pedal, then to the wooden rods leading up to the damper rod. If  the trouble is found in any of these, or the springs, use sperm oil or  vaseline.    Catch hold of the damper rod at the left behind the action and work  it. If it squeaks, you will have to take out the action and oil the  swings where they are hinged to the main rail.      QUESTIONS ON LESSON V.        1. If you should find a key sticking, how would you determine the      cause?        2. Name all the defects to which the key is subject.        3. Describe the proper adjustment of bottom or capstan.        4. Give two causes of blocking.        5. Give the purpose of the regulating button, and its proper      adjustment.          LESSON VI.    ~REGULATING AND REPAIRING.--(Continued.)~    THE SQUARE ACTION.      1. _The key_ in the square piano is subject to the same troubles as  that of the upright, and requires the same treatment. However, the  keys being much longer are more liable to cause trouble by warping.    2. _Bottom or Key Rocker_.--Unlike in the upright action, the jack is  attached directly to the bottom; but, lowering or raising the bottom  has the same effect in both cases. The screws regulating the height of  the jack can be gotten at with a proper screwdriver. If you have to  take out the key in order to regulate the bottom, first take  particular notice of the conditions in respect to the operation of the  jack on the hammer. Work the key slowly, to discover if there is lost  motion. Decide which way the bottom must go and how far, so that you  will not have to remove and replace the key more than once or twice  to adjust it. In taking out the key, remove the board which is set  edgewise over the keys immediately back of where the fingers strike,  by taking out the screw at each end. Lift the hammer with the finger  until the jack falls out of place; then by lifting the key off the  balance pin it can be drawn out. The back check will sometimes rub so  hard against the regulating button that it will be bent somewhat, and  must be adjusted after the key is replaced.    The bottom is often found to have shrunken; it rattles at every stroke  of the key. This can generally be stopped by simply turning the back  screw down until tight, which can be done without taking the key out.  This will rarely be found to alter the jack enough to cause it to fail  to return to the notch in the butt. After doing this, however, it is  well to examine for such a condition.    A sluggish motion of the jack is often found in old square pianos  caused by the swelling of the wood, at the point where the jack is  hinged to the bottom, or by the center pin's becoming foul from oxide.  This will cause the jack to fail at times to operate on the hammer,  especially in quick repetition. The key is struck with no response.  Take out the bottom entirely, and with the fingers press the sides of  the bottom inward; at the same time, work the jack back and forth.  This will generally free it if the jack-spring is all right.    3. _Jack_.--As in the upright, the behavior of the jack depends  entirely upon the surrounding members. A very common occurrence in the  square piano is a broken jack-spring. This spring is concealed in a  groove on the under side of the bottom, with a linen thread leading  around the end of the jack and held fast by a wooden plug. If the  spring is found to be long enough, drive out the plug, attach a new  thread to the spring, and fasten as before. If a new spring is needed,  one may be made by wrapping some small wire round a piece of music  wire of the right size.    4. _The back check, hammer stem and regulating button_ are subject to  the same faults as their counterparts in the upright, which may be  remedied in the same way. Bridles and hammer springs are not needed in  the square, as the weight of the hammer, moving in a vertical  direction, is sufficient to bring it to its rest position.    5. _Hammers_, when made of felt, will of course require the same  treatment as those in the upright. In many old squares the hammers are  built up of buckskin. If this becomes beaten down hard, it is well to  cap the hammer with a new soft piece of buckskin, gluing only at the  back ends.    6. _Butts and Flanges_.--A click just as the key comes up, indicates  that the felt cushion, against which the jack rests, is worn out and  must be replaced.    In all square actions the center pin, in the butt, is held by friction  alone, but rarely gets loose; if it should be found loose, put in a  larger pin.    The flange, shown in the cut, is what is called a split flange. By the  set screw T, the jaws can be regulated so that they neither clamp  the center pin so tightly as to make the action sluggish nor so  loosely as to let the hammer wabble.    If the bushing cloth is found to be badly worn, it is better to put in  new, which must be done neatly, or the result will not be  satisfactory.    Hammer flanges, like all other wooden parts, shrink away from the  screw heads and allow the hammer to drift to one side or rattle. While  the action is in the piano, strike the keys to see if there are any  that strike improperly. Mark the keys so as to indicate just what the  trouble is, so that you will know how to remedy it when the action is  out. If the hammers are set so close that they rub against each other,  you may have to cut off a slight shaving of felt, but this is rarely  necessary; for if properly placed, there is generally room for all;  yet sometimes the expansion of the felt or warping of the shank makes  cutting necessary.    7. _Dampers_.--The dampers in the square action depend entirely upon  their weight for their efficiency in damping the strings and returning  after being raised by the key. Often, after the key is struck, the  damper will not return to its place and the string is undamped. This  is generally found to be caused by the wire sticking in the hole  through which it passes, the wire being rusty or bent or some foreign  substance being in the hole round the wire. The bushing cloth in the  hole may be in such condition as to retard the free passage of the  damper wire, in which case the wire may be heated with a match and run  up and down a few times through the hole, which will free it. The  damper may not fall readily on account of a sluggish joint in the  flange. Work it back and forth as far as it will go a few times; if  necessary, take it off the damper rail and look for the cause of the  trouble.    Damper flanges get loose on the damper rail and work to one side,  causing defective damping and rattling. See that they are all tight,  and in their places.    Damper lifter buttons sometimes hold the damper off the string. See  that the top button falls so low that the damper lever does not touch  it when the key is released. This is accomplished by altering the  lower button. Examine the damper felts to see if they are moth-eaten,  or have become hardened or in any way impaired. Notice the adjustment  of the shade; that it is not too low or too high. The purpose of the  shade is to prevent the damper levers from flying up; but it should be  high enough so that the levers do not touch it when the key is  depressed gently.    Defective damping is one of the most annoying conditions, and when one  is employed to regulate a piano thoroughly and put it in order, he  should see that no key is left in which this occurs. Strike each key  and immediately let it up to see if it stops the sound quickly, or, in  other words, damps perfectly; if it does not, find the cause and  regulate until satisfactory.    8. _The grand action_ being, in principle, practically the same as  that of the square and the upright, containing the same mechanism as  is found in those actions, it is needless to give special instructions  concerning it; as the previous work has given the pupil a thorough  knowledge of the requirements of all actions, their common faults, and  proper methods of regulating to bring about satisfactory results. Let  us merely remark: Study thoroughly the behavior of every component  part of each action that comes under your observation; understand what  each part is for, why it is there, and how it works or should work  properly to fill its office. Then regulate and try for results. If you  have natural mechanical genius, a little experience will prepare you  to do all regulating and repairing with skill and quickness.      MISCELLANEOUS REPAIRS.    A few miscellaneous difficulties, common to all styles of actions, are  occasionally met with and need to be rectified.    1. _Broken Hammer Shank_.--Glue the"]]]
