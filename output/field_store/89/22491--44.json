A  Tradition said to come from the Companions runs thus:--\"One day, a woman  came to the Prophet and said, 'my father died without making the  Pilgrimage.' The Prophet said, 'If thy father had left a debt what wouldest  thou do,' 'I would pay the debt.' 'Good, then pay this debt also.'\" The  Quran forbids the use of Khamar, an intoxicating substance, and so it is  argued that wine and opium are unlawful, though not forbidden by name. The  Wahhabis would extend the prohibition to the use of tobacco.    From cases such as these, many jurisconsults hold that the Mujtahidin of  the earliest age established this fourth foundation of the faith which they  call Qias. It is also called I'tibar-ul-Amsal, or \"imitation of an  example.\" The idea is taken from the verse: \"Profit by this example, ye who  are men of insight\" (Sura lix. 2). There are strict rules laid down which  regulate Qias, of which the most important is, that in all cases it must be  based on the Quran, the Sunnat, and the Ijma'. In fact, the fundamental  idea of Islam {28} is that a perfect law has been given, even unto details,  of social and political life. The teaching of Muhammad contains the  solution of every difficulty that can arise. Every law not provided by the  Prophet must be deduced analogically. This produces uniformity after a  fashion, but only because intellectual activity in higher pursuits ceases  and moral stagnation follows. Thus all who come within the range of this  system are bound down to political servitude. Whatever in feeling or  conviction goes beyond the limits of an out-worn set of laws is swept away.  There is a wonderful family likeness in the decay of all Musalman States,  which seems to point to a common cause. All first principles are contained  in the Quran and the Sunnat; all that does not coincide with them must be  wrong. They are above all criticism.    Qias, then, affords no hope of enlightened progress, removes no fetter of  the past, for in it there must be no divergence in principle from a  legislation imperfect in its relation to modern life and stationary in its  essence.[32] In the Nihayat-ul-Murad it is written:--\"We are shut up to  following the four Imams.\" In the Tafsir-i-Ahmadi we read:--\"To follow any  other than the four Imams is unlawful.\" An objector may say that such  respect is like the reverence the heathen pay to their ancestors. To this  an answer is given in the preface to the Tarjuma-i-Sharh-i-Waqayah. The  writer there says that it is nothing of the kind. \"The Mujtahidin are not  the source of the orders of the Law, but they are the medium by which we  obtain the Law. Thus Imam Abu Hanifa said: 'We select first from the Quran,  then from the Traditions, then from the decrees of the Companions; we act  on what the Companions agreed upon; where they doubt, we doubt.' The  Commentator Jelal-ud-din Mahli says, 'The common people and others who have  {29} not reached the rank of a Mujtahid, must follow one of the four  Imams.' Then when he enters one Mazhab (sect) he must not change. Again, it  may be objected that God gave no order about the appointment of four Imams.  Now, it is recorded in a Tradition that the Prophet said, 'Follow the way  of the great company; whosoever departs from it will enter hell.' The  Followers of the Imams are a great company.\" It is moreover the unanimous  opinion, the \"Ijma'-i-Ummat,\" that the Imams rightly occupy the position  accorded to them. It is a great blessing, as we read in the  Tafsir-i-Ahmadi: \"It is of the grace of God, that we are shut up to these  four Imams. God approves of this, and into this matter proofs and  explanations do not enter.\" Should any one further object that, in the days  of the Prophet, there were no Mujtahidin, that each man acted on a \"saying\"  as he heard it, that he did not confine his belief or conduct to the  deductions made by some \"appointed Companion,\" he may be answered  thus:--\"For a long time after the death of the Prophet many Companions were  alive, and consequently the Traditions then current were trustworthy; but  now it is not so, hence the need for the Imams and their systems.\"    These four foundations,--the QURAN, the SUNNAT, IJMA' and QIAS--form in  orthodox Muslim opinion and belief a perfect basis of a perfect religion  and polity. They secure the permanence of the system, but they repress an  intelligent growth. The bearing of all this on modern politics is very  plain. Take again the case of Turkey. The constitution of the Government is  theocratic. The germs of freedom are wanting there as they have never been  wanting in any other country in Europe. The ruling power desires no change;  originality of thought, independence of judgment is repressed. Nothing good  has the Turk ever done for the world.[33] This rule has been one continued  display of brute {30} force unrelieved by any of the reflected glory which  shone for a while in Cordova and in Baghdad. No nation can possibly  progress, the foundations of whose legal and theocratic system are what has  been described in this chapter. When brought into diplomatic and commercial  intercourse with States possessing the energy and vigour of a national life  and liberal constitution, Muslim kingdoms must, in the long run, fail and  pass away. It has been well said that \"Spain is the only instance of a  country once thoroughly infused with Roman civilisation which has been  actually severed from the empire; and even then the severance, though of  long duration, was but partial and temporary. After a struggle of nearly  eight centuries, the higher form of social organisation triumphed over the  lower and the usurping power of Islam was expelled.\" So it ought to be, and  so indeed it must ever be, for despotism must give way to freedom; the life  latent in the subject Christian communities must sooner or later cast off  the yoke of a barbarian rule, which even at its best is petrified and so is  incapable of progress. However low a Christian community may have fallen,  there is always the possibility of its rising again. A lofty ideal is  placed before it. All its most cherished beliefs point forward and upward.  In Islam there is no regenerative power. Its golden age was in the past.  When the work of conquest is done, when a Muhammadan nation has to live by  industry, intelligence and thrift, it always miserably fails.    In this chapter which must now draw to a close, I have tried to prove from  authentic and authoritative sources that {31} the Quran alone is to no  Muslim the sole guide of life. The fetters of a dogmatic system fasten  alike around the individual and the community. Islam is sterile, it gives  no new birth to the spirit of a man, leads him not in search of new forms  of truth, and so it can give no real life, no lasting vitality to a  nation.[34]    {32}        NOTE TO CHAPTER I.        IJTIHAD.        Questions connected with Ijtihad are so important in Islam, that I      think it well to give in the form of a note a fuller and more technical      account of it, than I could do in the Chapter just concluded. This      account which I shall now give is that of a learned Musalman, and is,      therefore, of the highest value. It consists of extracts from an      article in the Journal Asiatique, Quatrieme Serie, tome, 15, on \"Le      Marche et les Progres de la Jurisprudence parmi les Sectes orthodoxes      Musalmanes\" by Mirza Kazim Beg, Professor in the University of St.      Petersburg. It entirely supports all that has been said of the rigid      character of Muhammadan Law, and of the immobility of systems founded      thereon.        \"Orthodox Musalmans admit the following propositions as axioms.        1. God the only legislator has shown the way of felicity to the people      whom He has chosen, and in order to enable them to walk in that way He      has shown to them the precepts which are found, partly in the eternal      Quran, and partly in the sayings of the Prophet transmitted to      posterity by the Companions and preserved in the Sunnat. That way is      called the \"Shari'at.\" The rules thereof are called Ahkam.        2. The Quran and the Sunnat, which since their manifestation are the      primitive sources of the orders of the Law, form two branches of study,      _viz._, Ilm-i-Tafsir, or the interpretation of the Quran and      Ilm-i-Hadis, or the study of Tradition.        3. All the orders of the Law have regard either to the actions (Din),      or to the belief (Iman) of the Mukallifs.[35]        4. As the Quran and the Sunnat are the principal sources from whence      the precepts of the Shari'at have been drawn, so the rules recognized      as the principal elements of actual jurisprudence are the subject of      Ilm-i-Fiqh, or the science of Law.        Fiqh in its root signifies conception, comprehension. Thus Muhammad      prayed for Ibn Mas'ud: \"May God make him {33} comprehend (Faqqihahu),      and make him know the interpretation of the Quran.\" Muhammad in his      quality of Judge and chief of the Believers decided, without appeal or      contradiction, all the affairs of the people. His sayings served as a      guide to the Companions. After the death of the Prophet the first      Khalifs acted on the authority of the Traditions. Meanwhile the Quran      and the Sunnat, the principal elements of religion and legislation,      became little by little the subject of controversy. It was then that      men applied themselves vigorously to the task of learning by heart the      Quran and the Traditions, and then that jurisprudence became a separate      science. No science had as yet been systematically taught,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20663"],[0,"The American Practical Brewer and Tanner (#7)"],[1," thus, in every turning, the bottom and top should always  exchange places. In this stage of the process, care should be taken to  turn the couch frequently, to prevent the growth of the root, in order  to give the greater facility to the growth of the blade, it being  essentially requisite to keep that of the root stationary, to prevent a  waste of strength in the grain. Three or four days after watering, is  generally found a sufficient time for the blade to grow fully up to the  end of the grain; farther than which it should not be suffered to  proceed. The couch should be now checked in its growth, and thrown on  the second or withering floor, where it should be laid thin, and  frequently turned; this continued operation will bring it dry and sweet  to the kiln, to which it may be committed without further delay.  Although the common practice is to throw it up into what is commonly  termed a sweet-heap, and so remain from twelve to twenty-four hours, or  until you can hardly bear your hand in it; then, and not before, is it  considered fit to go on the kiln. This is a practice that cannot be too  much condemned, or too generally exploded, as producing the very worst  consequences; a few of which I will mention. Green malt, thus treated,  becomes in a manner decomposed; and beer brewed from such malt will  never keep long, acquiring a disagreeable, nauseous flavour, rapidly  tending to acidity, beside becoming unusually high coloured. Although  the malt, before grinding, will have all the appearance of pale malt,  this quality can be easily accounted for by the high heat the malt is  suffered to acquire in the heap before putting it on the kiln. What I  have here mentioned will, I trust, suffice to recommend a more  judicious mode of practice. Forty-eight hours for malt to remain on the  kiln is enough, as pale malt can be completely dried in that time, if  frequently turned, and properly attended to. It is further worthy of  remark, that barley malt should in no case exceed fifteen or sixteen  days from the steep to the kiln, and is often more successfully  effected in twelve or thirteen days. The common practice of maltsters  is to allow twenty one days, which generally brings the green malt in a  mouldy state to the kiln, to the great injury of flavour and  preservation in beer brewed from such malts; whereas, the grain should  be brought as sweet and dry as circumstances will allow of to this last  and important operation of malting, every part of which requires minute  and continued attention. When you suppose your malt sufficiently dry,  make a round space in the centre of your kilncast by shovelling the  malt to the extremities; after which, sweep this space, and shovel back  again your malt from the walls and angles into it; make a round heap of  the whole on the centre of your kiln, sweep your kiln all round the  foot of your heap; so let it stand two hours, then throw it off; this  last operation is performed to give every chance for equal drying. The  practice of many maltsters is to take seventy two hours to dry their  pale malt, keeping all the time a very slow and slack fire, this is  another capital error, and should be corrected with the former ones.  Various are the opinions entertained, as to the best mode of preserving  malt after coming off the kiln: some are of opinion that the  circumambient air should have a free access to it; this opinion, I  admit, might have weight if such malt was to be immediately brewed; but  where it is allowed to remain in heap for four or five months, and  gradually become cool, the less air admitted to have access to it the  better; this has been the practice and opinion of the most judicious  maltsters I have been acquainted with, and, consequently, is what I  would recommend, except in the case of immediate use, where exposure  becomes necessary, particularly after grinding, as malt so treated will  bear a higher liquor, and yield a more preserving extract.          _Winter Barley._      To avoid useless and unnecessary repetitions, it is enough simply to  state, that winter barley, being a weaker bodied grain than summer,  requires less watering, consequently, a less time in steep, say 36 to  40 hours, and about 32 gallons of water to sixty bushels will be  sufficient on the floor; the other treatment the same.          _Oats the same_,      with about 24 gallons of water on the floor, for sixty bushels, divided  as directed in the case of summer and winter barley; the remaining part  of the process the same.          _Rye Malt._      Rye may be steeped 48 hours, with 48 gallons of water on the floor; the  remainder of the process the same, quantity of grain sixty bushels.          _Wheat._      The above time in steep, and same proportion of water on the floor,  will answer to make wheat malt, suppose 60 bushels, varying somewhat  according to season, the time of steeping, and bringing to the kiln;  the remainder of the process the same.          _Indian Corn Malt, a valuable auxiliary to Brewing materials._      This species of grain well managed, and made into malt, will be found  alike useful to the brewer and distiller, but it is peculiarly adapted  to the brewing of porter; further, it is known to possess more  saccharine matter than any other grain used in either brewing or  distilling, joined to the advantage of not interfering with the season  for malting barley, as this should commence when the former ceases. The  summer months are the fittest for malting this kind of grain, and can  be only very defectively made at any other season, as it requires a  high temperature to force germination, and cause it to give out all its  sweet. The following process, it is expected, will be found to answer  every purpose wished for: suppose your steep to contain sixty bushels,  after you have levelled it off, let on your water as directed in  malting barley; you should give fresh water to your steep at the end of  twenty-four hours. If it is southern corn you are malting, it will  require to remain in steep seventy-two hours in the whole; if it be  northern corn, it will require ninety-six hours, there being a  considerable difference in the density of these two kinds of grain; the  hardest, of course, requires the most water; and, in all cases, the  fresher Indian corn is from the cob the better it will malt. When you  have accomplished the necessary time in your steep, you let off your  water; and, when sufficiently drained, let it down in your couch frame,  where it will require turning once in twelve hours, in order to keep it  of equal temperature; the depth of the grain should be about two feet  and a half in the frame; as it begins to germinate and grow, open your  frame, and thin it down at every turning, until you reduce its  thickness to six or seven inches; thus extending it on your lower  floor, turning it more frequently, as the growth is rapid. The  vegetation of the grain, together with the turning, will by this time  make the watering pot necessary; the criterion by which you will judge  of its fitness for the water, is as soon as you perceive the root or  acrospire begins to wither. Two thirds of your water is to be  distributed over the surface of your couch for the first watering,  which will require thirty-two gallons, and when turned back again,  sixteen gallons for the second watering, making in the whole  forty-eight gallons of water to sixty bushels of corn. This water  should be put on with a gardener's watering pot, as equally as  possible. Supposing this pot to contain four gallons, it will make  eight pots for the first watering, and four for the second. In this  stage of the operation the turnings on the floor should be very  frequent, in order to keep the grain cool, as the heat of the weather,  at this season, will be sufficient to promote and perfect the  vegetation. The second day after the first watering, if the blade is  not sufficiently grown, water again, but in less quantity, say one  half. It will be now four or five days more before the couch is ready  for the kiln, which will be ascertained by the blade becoming the full  length of the corn. After this it should be thrown on the upper floor,  and suffered to wither for a couple of days, turning it frequently; by  this time the blade will have a yellow appearance, the grain will  become tender, and, if tasted, be found uncommonly sweet; in this state  it may be committed to the kiln, and dried in the usual way.    N. B. It will generally take ten days after it is out of the steep to  perfect the malting of southern corn, and twelve days for northern.          _Fermentation._      Notwithstanding that progress of improvement in the doctrine of  fermentation has, in the last twenty years, far surpassed any thing in  the same period that preceded it, we have still much to learn.  Fermentation is the instrument or means which nature employs in the  decomposition of vegetable and animal bodies, or reduction of them to  their original elements, or first principles. Fermentation is,  therefore, a spontaneous separation of the component parts of these  bodies, and is one of those processes that is conducted by nature for  their resolution, and the combination and fermentation of other bodies  out of them; therefore, it is one of these operations in which nature  is continually present, and going on before our eyes; this may be one  reason that a very critical observance of it has escaped our attention.  Fermentation brings us acquainted with this unerring axiom; that  nothing in nature is lost; or that matter, of which all things are  composed, is indestructible. For instance, the vinous process of  fermentation, succeeded by distillation, produces ardent spirits, or  alcohol, the elements of which are here described. If we pass this  alcohol, or spirits of wine, through a glass, porcelain, or metallic  tube, heated right hot, provided with a suitable condenser and  apparatus"]]]
