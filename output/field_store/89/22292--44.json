[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1726"],[0,"Theaetetus (#7)"],[1," the antiquity of a family, he remembers that every one has had  myriads of progenitors, rich and poor, Greeks and barbarians, kings  and slaves. And he who boasts of his descent from Amphitryon in the  twenty-fifth generation, may, if he pleases, add as many more, and  double that again, and our philosopher only laughs at his inability to  do a larger sum. Such is the man at whom the vulgar scoff; he seems to  them as if he could not mind his feet. 'That is very true, Socrates.'  But when he tries to draw the quick-witted lawyer out of his pleas and  rejoinders to the contemplation of absolute justice or injustice in  their own nature, or from the popular praises of wealthy kings to the  view of happiness and misery in themselves, or to the reasons why a man  should seek after the one and avoid the other, then the situation is  reversed; the little wretch turns giddy, and is ready to fall over the  precipice; his utterance becomes thick, and he makes himself ridiculous,  not to servant-maids, but to every man of liberal education. Such are  the two pictures: the one of the philosopher and gentleman, who may be  excused for not having learned how to make a bed, or cook up flatteries;  the other, a serviceable knave, who hardly knows how to wear his  cloak,--still less can he awaken harmonious thoughts or hymn virtue's  praises.    'If the world, Socrates, were as ready to receive your words as I am,  there would be greater peace and less evil among mankind.'    Evil, Theodorus, must ever remain in this world to be the antagonist of  good, out of the way of the gods in heaven. Wherefore also we should fly  away from ourselves to them; and to fly to them is to become like them;  and to become like them is to become holy, just and true. But many  live in the old wives' fable of appearances; they think that you should  follow virtue in order that you may seem to be good. And yet the truth  is, that God is righteous; and of men, he is most like him who is most  righteous. To know this is wisdom; and in comparison of this the wisdom  of the arts or the seeming wisdom of politicians is mean and common. The  unrighteous man is apt to pride himself on his cunning; when others  call him rogue, he says to himself: 'They only mean that I am one who  deserves to live, and not a mere burden of the earth.' But he should  reflect that his ignorance makes his condition worse than if he knew.  For the penalty of injustice is not death or stripes, but the fatal  necessity of becoming more and more unjust. Two patterns of life are set  before him; the one blessed and divine, the other godless and wretched;  and he is growing more and more like the one and unlike the other. He  does not see that if he continues in his cunning, the place of innocence  will not receive him after death. And yet if such a man has the courage  to hear the argument out, he often becomes dissatisfied with himself,  and has no more strength in him than a child.--But we have digressed  enough.    'For my part, Socrates, I like the digressions better than the argument,  because I understand them better.'    To return. When we left off, the Protagoreans and Heracliteans were  maintaining that the ordinances of the State were just, while they  lasted. But no one would maintain that the laws of the State were always  good or expedient, although this may be the intention of them. For  the expedient has to do with the future, about which we are liable to  mistake. Now, would Protagoras maintain that man is the measure not  only of the present and past, but of the future; and that there is no  difference in the judgments of men about the future? Would an untrained  man, for example, be as likely to know when he is going to have a fever,  as the physician who attended him? And if they differ in opinion,  which of them is likely to be right; or are they both right? Is not a  vine-grower a better judge of a vintage which is not yet gathered, or a  cook of a dinner which is in preparation, or Protagoras of the probable  effect of a speech than an ordinary person? The last example speaks 'ad  hominen.' For Protagoras would never have amassed a fortune if every man  could judge of the future for himself. He is, therefore, compelled to  admit that he is a measure; but I, who know nothing, am not equally  convinced that I am. This is one way of refuting him; and he is refuted  also by the authority which he attributes to the opinions of others, who  deny his opinions. I am not equally sure that we can disprove the truth  of immediate states of feeling. But this leads us to the doctrine of  the universal flux, about which a battle-royal is always going on in the  cities of Ionia. 'Yes; the Ephesians are downright mad about the  flux; they cannot stop to argue with you, but are in perpetual motion,  obedient to their text-books. Their restlessness is beyond expression,  and if you ask any of them a question, they will not answer, but dart at  you some unintelligible saying, and another and another, making no way  either with themselves or with others; for nothing is fixed in them  or their ideas,--they are at war with fixed principles.' I suppose,  Theodorus, that you have never seen them in time of peace, when they  discourse at leisure to their disciples? 'Disciples! they have none;  they are a set of uneducated fanatics, and each of them says of the  other that they have no knowledge. We must trust to ourselves, and not  to them for the solution of the problem.' Well, the doctrine is old,  being derived from the poets, who speak in a figure of Oceanus and  Tethys; the truth was once concealed, but is now revealed by the  superior wisdom of a later generation, and made intelligible to the  cobbler, who, on hearing that all is in motion, and not some things  only, as he ignorantly fancied, may be expected to fall down and worship  his teachers. And the opposite doctrine must not be forgotten:--         'Alone being remains unmoved which is the name for all,'    as Parmenides affirms. Thus we are in the midst of the fray; both  parties are dragging us to their side; and we are not certain which of  them are in the right; and if neither, then we shall be in a ridiculous  position, having to set up our own opinion against ancient and famous  men.    Let us first approach the river-gods, or patrons of the flux.    When they speak of motion, must they not include two kinds of motion,  change of place and change of nature?--And all things must be supposed  to have both kinds of motion; for if not, the same things would be at  rest and in motion, which is contrary to their theory. And did we not  say, that all sensations arise thus: they move about between the agent  and patient together with a perception, and the patient ceases to be a  perceiving power and becomes a percipient, and the agent a quale instead  of a quality; but neither has any absolute existence? But now we make  the further discovery, that neither white or whiteness, nor any sense  or sensation, can be predicated of anything, for they are in a perpetual  flux. And therefore we must modify the doctrine of Theaetetus and  Protagoras, by asserting further that knowledge is and is not sensation;  and of everything we must say equally, that this is and is not, or  becomes or becomes not. And still the word 'this' is not quite correct,  for language fails in the attempt to express their meaning.    At the close of the discussion, Theodorus claims to be released from the  argument, according to his agreement. But Theaetetus insists that they  shall proceed to consider the doctrine of rest. This is declined by  Socrates, who has too much reverence for the great Parmenides lightly  to attack him. (We shall find that he returns to the doctrine of rest  in the Sophist; but at present he does not wish to be diverted from  his main purpose, which is, to deliver Theaetetus of his conception of  knowledge.) He proceeds to interrogate him further. When he says that  'knowledge is in perception,' with what does he perceive? The first  answer is, that he perceives sights with the eye, and sounds with the  ear. This leads Socrates to make the reflection that nice distinctions  of words are sometimes pedantic, but sometimes necessary; and he  proposes in this case to substitute the word 'through' for 'with.' For  the senses are not like the Trojan warriors in the horse, but have  a common centre of perception, in which they all meet. This common  principle is able to compare them with one another, and must therefore  be distinct from them (compare Republic). And as there are facts of  sense which are perceived through the organs of the body, there are also  mathematical and other abstractions, such as sameness and difference,  likeness and unlikeness, which the soul perceives by herself. Being is  the most universal of these abstractions. The good and the beautiful are  abstractions of another kind, which exist in relation and which above  all others the mind perceives in herself, comparing within her past,  present, and future. For example; we know a thing to be hard or soft by  the touch, of which the perception is given at birth to men and animals.  But the essence of hardness or softness, or the fact that this hardness  is, and is the opposite of softness, is slowly learned by reflection and  experience. Mere perception does not reach being, and therefore fails of  truth; and therefore has no share in knowledge. But if so, knowledge  is not perception. What then is knowledge? The mind, when occupied  by herself with being, is said to have opinion--shall we say that  'Knowledge is true opinion'? But still an old difficulty recurs; we  ask ourselves, 'How is false opinion possible?' This difficulty may be  stated as follows:--    Either we know or do not know a thing (for the intermediate processes  of learning and forgetting need not at present be considered); and in  thinking or having an opinion, we must either know or not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17262"],[0,"Catalogue Of Linguistic Manuscripts In The Library Of The Bureau Of Ethnology.
