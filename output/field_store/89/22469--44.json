MS. 31922_.]    In April, 1502, at the age of ten, Henry became the heir-apparent to  the English throne. He succeeded at once to the dukedom of Cornwall,  but again a precedent was set which was followed but yesterday; and  ten months were allowed to elapse before he was, on 18th February,  1503, created Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester, the dukedom of York  becoming void until a king or an heir apparent should again have a  second son.[58] The first sign of his increased importance was his  implication in the maze of matrimonial intrigues which formed so large  a part of sixteenth-century diplomacy. The last thing kings        (p. 026)  considered was the domestic felicity of their children; their marriages  were pieces in the diplomatic game and sometimes the means by which  States were built up. While Duke of York, Henry had been proposed as a  husband for Eleanor,[59] daughter of the Archduke Philip; and his  sister Mary as the bride of Philip's son Charles, who, as the heir of  the houses of Castile and of Aragon, of Burgundy and of Austria, was  from the cradle destined to wield the imperial sceptre of Caesar. No  further steps were taken at the time, and Prince Arthur's death  brought other projects to the front.                       [Footnote 58: The next prince to hold the title was                     Charles, afterwards Charles I., who was created                     Duke of York on 6th Jan., 1605.]                       [Footnote 59: Afterwards Queen of Portugal and then                     of France. _L. and P._, _Henry VII._, i., 285,                     425.]    Immediately on receiving the news, and two days before they dated  their letter of condolence to Henry VII., Ferdinand and Isabella  commissioned the Duke of Estrada to negotiate a marriage between the  widowed Catherine and her youthful brother-in-law.[60] No doubt was  entertained but that the Pope would grant the necessary dispensation,  for the spiritual head of Christendom was apt to look tenderly on the  petitions of the powerful princes of this world. A more serious  difficulty was the question of the widow's dower. Part only had been  paid, and Ferdinand not merely refused to hand over the rest, but  demanded the return of his previous instalments. Henry, on the other  hand, considered himself entitled to the whole, refused to refund a  penny, and gave a cold reception to the proposed marriage between  Catherine and his sole surviving son. He was, however, by no means  blind to the advantages of the Spanish matrimonial and political  alliance, and still less to the attractions of Catherine's dower;  (p. 027)  he declined to send back the Princess, when Isabella, shocked at Henry  VII.'s proposal to marry his daughter-in-law himself, demanded her  return; and eventually, when Ferdinand reduced his terms, he suffered  the marriage treaty to be signed. On 25th June, 1503, Prince Henry and  Catherine were solemnly betrothed in the Bishop of Salisbury's house,  in Fleet Street.                       [Footnote 60: _Sp. Cal._, i., 267.]    The papal dispensation arrived in time to solace Isabella on her  death-bed in November, 1504; but that event once more involved in  doubt the prospects of the marriage. The crown of Castile passed from  Isabella to her daughter Juana; the government of the kingdom was  claimed by Ferdinand and by Juana's husband, Philip of Burgundy. On  their way from the Netherlands to claim their inheritance, Philip and  Juana were driven on English shores. Henry VII. treated them with all  possible courtesy, and made Philip a Knight of the Garter, while  Philip repaid the compliment by investing Prince Henry with the Order  of the Golden Fleece.[61] But advantage was taken of Philip's plight  to extort from him the surrender of the Earl of Suffolk, styled the  White Rose, and a commercial treaty with the Netherlands, which the  Flemings named the Malus Intercursus. Three months after his arrival  in Castile, Philip died, and Henry began to fish in the troubled  waters for a share in his dominions. Two marriage schemes occurred to  him; he might win the hand of Philip's sister Margaret, now Regent of  the Netherlands, and with her hand the control of those provinces; or  he might marry Juana and claim in her right to administer Castile. On  the acquisition of Castile he set his mind. If he could not gain   (p. 028)  it by marriage with Juana, he thought he could do so by marrying  her son and heir, the infant Charles, to his daughter Mary. Whichever  means he took to further his design, it would naturally irritate  Ferdinand and make him less anxious for the completion of the marriage  between Catherine and Prince Henry. Henry VII. was equally averse from  the consummation of the match. Now that he was scheming with Charles's  other grandfather, the Emperor Maximilian, to wrest the government of  Castile from Ferdinand's grasp, the alliance of the King of Aragon had  lost its attraction, and it was possible that the Prince of Wales  might find elsewhere a more desirable bride. Henry's marriage with  Catherine was to have been accomplished when he completed the age of  fourteen; but on the eve of his fifteenth birthday he made a solemn  protestation that the contract was null and void, and that he would  not carry out his engagements.[62] This protest left him free to  consider other proposals, and enhanced his value as a negotiable  asset. More than once negotiations were started for marrying him to  Marguerite de Valois, sister of the Duke of Angouleme, afterwards  famous as Francis I.;[63] and in the last months of his father's  reign, the Prince of Wales was giving audience to ambassadors from  Maximilian, who came to suggest matrimonial alliances between the  prince and a daughter of Duke Albert of Bavaria, and between Henry  VII. and the Lady Margaret of Savoy, Regent of the Netherlands.[64]  Meanwhile, Ferdinand, threatened on all sides, first came to terms (p. 029)  with France; he married a French princess, Germaine de Foix, abandoned  his claim to Navarre, and bought the security of Naples by giving  Louis XII. a free hand in the north of Italy. He then diverted  Maximilian from his designs on Castile by humouring his hostility to  Venice. By that bait he succeeded in drawing off his enemies, and the  league of Cambrai united them all, Ferdinand and Louis, Emperor and  Pope, in an iniquitous attack on the Italian Republic. Henry VII.,  fortunately for his reputation, was left out of the compact. He was  still cherishing his design on Castile, and in December, 1508, the  treaty of marriage between Mary and Charles was formally signed. It  was the last of his worldly triumphs; the days of his life were  numbered, and in the early months of 1509 he was engaged in making a  peace with his conscience.                       [Footnote 61: _L. and P._, _Henry VII._, ii., 158;                     _Ven. Cal._, i., 867.]                       [Footnote 62: _Sp. Cal._, i., 458; _L. and P._,                     iv., 5791.]                       [Footnote 63: _L. and P._, _Henry VII._, i.,                     241-47; ii. 342-43.]                       [Footnote 64: _Sp. Cal._, Suppl., p. 23.]           *       *       *       *       *    The twenty-four years during which Henry VII. had guided the destinies  of England were a momentous epoch in the development of Western  civilisation. It was the dawn of modern history, of the history of  Europe in the form in which we know it to-day. The old order was in a  state of liquidation. The mediaeval ideal, described by Dante, of a  universal monarchy with two aspects, spiritual and temporal, and two  heads, emperor and pope, was passing away. Its place was taken by the  modern but narrower ideal of separate polities, each pursuing its own  course, independent of, and often in conflict with, other societies.  Unity gave way to diversity of tongues, of churches, of states; and  the cosmopolitan became nationalist, patriot, separatist. Imperial  monarchy shrank to a shadow; and kings divided the emperor's power (p. 030)  at the same time that they consolidated their own. They extended their  authority on both sides, at the expense of their superior, the  emperor, and at the expense of their subordinate feudal lords. The  struggle between the disruptive forces of feudalism and the central  power of monarchy ended at last in monarchical triumph; and internal  unity prepared the way for external expansion. France under Louis XI.  was first in the field. She had surmounted her civil troubles half a  century earlier than England. She then expelled her foreign foes,  crushed the remnants of feudal independence, and began to expand at  the cost of weaker States. Parts of Burgundy, Provence, and Brittany  became merged in France; the exuberant strength of the new-formed  nation burst the barriers of the Alps and overflowed into the plains  of Italy. The time of universal monarchy was past, but the dread of it  remained; and from Charles VIII.'s invasion of Italy in 1494 to  Francis I.'s defeat at Pavia in 1525, French dreams of world-wide  sovereignty were the nightmare of other kings. Those dreams might, as  Europe feared, have been realised, had not other States followed  France in the path of internal consolidation. Ferdinand of Aragon  married Isabella of Castile, drove out the Moors, and founded the  modern Spanish kingdom. Maximilian married Mary, the daughter of  Charles the Bold, and joined the Netherlands to Austria. United France  found herself face to face with other united States, and the political  system of modern Europe was roughly sketched out. The boundaries of  the various kingdoms were fluctuating. There still remained minor  principalities and powers, chiefly in Italy and Germany, which offered  an easy prey to their ambitious neighbours; for both nations had   (p. 031)"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20318"],[0,"Little Journeys to the Homes of the Great - Volume 14 (#7)"],[1,"and       anecdotes, Harris from Hanover, whom Paganini has taken with him to       manage the financial business of his concerts. But they do not know       that the devil has only borrowed Herr George Harris' form, and that       meanwhile the poor soul of this poor man is shut up with other       rubbish in a trunk at Hanover, until the devil returns its       flesh-envelope, while he perhaps will guide his master through the       world in a worthier form--namely as a black poodle.\"         But if Paganini seemed mysterious and strange enough when I saw him       walking in bright midday under the green trees of the Hamburg       Jungfernstieg, how his awful bizarre appearance startled me at the       concert in the evening! The Hamburg Opera House was the scene of       this concert, and the art-loving public had flocked there so       early, and in such numbers, that I only just succeeded in obtaining       a little place in the orchestra. Although it was post-day, I saw in       the first row of boxes the whole educated commercial world, a whole       Olympus of bankers and other millionaires, the gods of coffee and       sugar by the side of their fat goddesses, Junos of Wandrahm and       Aphrodites of Dreckwall. A religious silence reigned through the       assembly. Every eye was directed towards the stage. Every ear was       making ready to listen. My neighbor, an old furrier, took the dirty       cotton out of his ears in order to drink in better the costly       sounds for which he had paid his two thalers.         At last a dark figure, which seemed to have arisen from the       underworld, appeared upon the stage. It was Paganini in his black       costume--the black dress-coat and the black waistcoat of a horrible       cut, such as is prescribed by infernal etiquette at the court of       Proserpine. The black trousers hung anxiously around the thin legs.       The long arms appeared to grow still longer, as, holding the violin       in one hand and the bow in the other, he almost touched the floor       with them, while displaying to the public his unprecedented       obeisances. In the angular curves of his body there was a horrible       woodenness, and also something absurdly animal-like, that during       these bows one could not help feeling a strange desire to laugh.       But his face, that appeared still more cadaverously pale in the       glare of the orchestra lights, had about it something so imploring,       so simply humble, that a sorrowful compassion repressed one's       desire to smile. Had he learnt these complimentary bows from an       automaton, or a dog? Is that the entreating gaze of one sick unto       death, or is there lurking behind it the mockery of a crafty       miser? Is that a man brought into the arena at the moment of death,       like a dying gladiator, to delight the public with his convulsions?       Or is it one risen from the dead, a vampire with a violin, who, if       not the blood out of our hearts, at any rate sucks the gold out of       our pockets?         Such questions crossed our minds while Paganini was performing his       strange bows, but all those thoughts were at once still when the       wonderful master placed his violin under his chin and began to       play.         As for me, you already know my musical second-sight, my gift of       seeing at each tone a figure equivalent to the sound, and so       Paganini with each stroke of his bow brought visible forms and       situations before my eyes; he told me in melodious hieroglyphics       all kinds of brilliant tales; he, as it were, made a magic lantern       play its colored antics before me, he himself being chief actor. At       the first stroke of his bow the stage scenery around him had       changed; he suddenly stood with his music-desk in a cheerful room,       decorated in a gay, irregular way after the Pompadour style;       everywhere little mirrors, gilded Cupids, Chinese porcelain, a       delightful chaos of ribbons, garlands of flowers, white gloves,       torn lace, false pearls, powder-puffs, diamonds of gold-leaf and       spangles--such tinsel as one finds in the room of a prima donna.       Paganini's outward appearance had also changed, and certainly most       advantageously; he wore short breeches of lily-colored satin, a       white waistcoat embroidered with silver, and a coat of bright blue       velvet with gold buttons; the hair in little carefully curled locks       bordered his face, which was young and rosy, and gleamed with sweet       tenderness as he ogled the pretty young lady who stood near him at       the music-desk, while he played the violin.         Yes, I saw at his side a pretty young creature, dressed in antique       costume, the white satin swelled out above the waist, making the       figure still more charmingly slender; the high raised hair was       powdered and curled, and the pretty round face shone out all the       more openly with its glancing eyes, its little rouged cheeks, its       tiny beauty-patches, and the sweet, impertinent little nose. In her       hand was a roll of white paper, and by the movements of her lips as       well as by the coquettish waving to and fro of her little upper lip       she seemed to be singing; but none of her trills was audible to me,       and only from the violin with which young Paganini led the lovely       child could I discover what she sang, and what he himself during       her song felt in his soul.         Oh, what melodies were those! Like the nightingale's notes, when       the fragrance of the rose intoxicates her yearning young heart with       desire, they floated in the twilight. Oh, what melting, languid       delight was that! The sounds kissed each other, then fled away       pouting, and then, laughing, clasped each other and became one, and       died away in intoxicating harmony. Yes, the sounds carried on their       merry game like butterflies, when one, in playful provocation, will       escape from another, hide behind a flower, be overtaken at last,       and then, wantonly joying with the other, fly away into the golden       sunlight. But a spider, a spider can prepare a sudden tragical fate       for such enamored butterflies!         Did the young heart anticipate this? A melancholy sighing tone, a       sad foreboding of some slowly approaching misfortune, glided softly       through the enrapturing melodies that were streaming from       Paganini's violin. His eyes became moist. Adoringly he knelt down       before his amata. But, alas! as he bowed down to kiss her feet, he       saw under the sofa a little abbate! I do not know what he had       against the poor man, but the Genoese became pale as death. He       seized the little fellow with furious hands, drew a stiletto from       its sheath, and buried it in the young rogue's breast.         At this moment, however, a shout of \"Bravo! Bravo!\" broke out from       all sides. Hamburg's enthusiastic sons and daughters were paying       the tribute of their uproarious applause to the great artist, who       had just ended the first of his concert, and was now bowing with       even more angles and contortions than before. And on his face the       abject humility seems to me to have become more intense. From his       eyes stared a sorrowful anxiety like that of a poor malefactor.       \"Divine!\" cried my neighbor, the furrier, as he scratched his ears;       \"that piece alone was worth two thalers.\"         When Paganini began to play again a gloom came before my eyes. The       sounds were not transformed into bright forms and colors; the       master's form was clothed in gloomy shades, out of the darkness of       which his music moaned in the most piercing tones of lamentation.         Only at times, when a little lamp that hung above cast its       sorrowful light over him, could I catch a glimpse of his pale       countenance, on which the youth was not yet extinguished. His       costume was singular, in two colors, yellow and red. Heavy chains       weighed upon his feet. Behind him moved a face whose physiognomy       indicated a lusty goat-nature. And I saw at times long, hairy hands       seize assistingly the strings of the violin on which Paganini was       playing. They often guided the hand which held the bow, and then a       bleat-laugh of applause accompanied the melody, which gushed from       the violin ever more full of sorrow and anguish. They were melodies       which were like the song of the fallen angels who had loved the       daughters of earth, and being exiled from the kingdom of the       blessed, sank into the underworld with faces red with shame. They       were melodies in whose bottomless depths glimmered neither       consolation nor hope. When the saints in heaven hear such melodies,       the praise of God dies upon their paled lips, and they cover their       heads weeping. At times when the obligate goat's laugh bleated in       among the melodious pangs, I caught a glimpse in the background of       a crowd of small women-figures who nodded their odious heads with       wicked wantonness. Then a rush of agonizing sounds came from the       violin, and a fearful groan and a sob, such as was never heard upon       earth before, nor will be perhaps heard upon earth again, unless in       the valley of Jehoshaphat, when the colossal trumpets of doom shall       ring out, and the naked corpses shall crawl forth from the grave to       abide their fate. But the agonized violinist suddenly made one       stroke of the bow, such a mad, despairing stroke, that his chains       fell rattling from him, and his mysterious assistant and the other       foul, mocking forms vanished.         At this moment my neighbor, the furrier, said, \"A pity, a pity! a       string has snapped--that comes from constant pizzicato.\"         Had a string of the violin really snapped? I do not "]]]
