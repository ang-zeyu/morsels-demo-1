I had slightly miscalculated the distance, as Fate would have it, and  with a patch of gorse effectually screening my approach, I came upon  her, kneeling on the damp grass and unfastening the bundle which had  attracted my attention. I stopped and watched her.    She was dressed in bedraggled fashion in rusty black, wore a common  black straw hat and a thick veil; but it seemed to me that the  dexterous hands at work untying the bundle were slim and white, and I  perceived a pair of hideous cotton gloves lying on the turf beside  her. As she threw open the wrappings and lifted out something that  looked like a small shrimping-net, I stepped around the bush, crossed  silently the intervening patch of grass and stood beside her.    A faint breath of perfume reached me--of a perfume which, like the  secret incense of Ancient Egypt, seemed to assail my soul. The glamour  of the Orient was in that subtle essence, and I only knew one woman  who used it. I bent over the kneeling figure.    \"Good morning,\" I said; \"can I assist you in any way?\"    She came to her feet like a startled deer, and flung away from me with  the lithe movement of some Eastern dancing-girl.    Now came the sun, and its heralding rays struck sparks from the jewels  upon the white fingers of this woman who wore the garments of a  mendicant. My heart gave a great leap. It was with difficulty that I  controlled my voice.    \"There is no cause for alarm,\" I added.    She stood watching me; even through the coarse veil I could see how  her eyes glittered. I stooped and picked up the net.    \"Oh!\" The whispered word was scarcely audible; but it was enough. I  doubted no longer.    \"This is a net for bird-snaring,\" I said. \"What strange bird are you  seeking, _Karamaneh_?\"    With a passionate gesture Karamaneh snatched off the veil, and with it  the ugly black hat. The cloud of wonderful intractable hair came  rumpling about her face, and her glorious eyes blazed out upon me. How  beautiful they were, with the dark beauty of an Egyptian night; how  often had they looked into mine in dreams!    To labour against a ceaseless yearning for a woman whom one knows, upon  evidence that none but a fool might reject, to be worthless--evil; is  there any torture to which the soul of man is subject, more pitiless?  Yet this was my lot, for what past sins assigned to me I was unable to  conjecture; and this was the woman, this lovely slave of a monster, this  creature of Dr. Fu-Manchu.    \"I suppose you will declare that you do not know me!\" I said harshly.    Her lips trembled, but she made no reply.    \"It is very convenient to forget, sometimes,\" I ran on bitterly, then  checked myself, for I knew that my words were prompted by a feckless  desire to hear her defence, by a fool's hope that it might be an  acceptable one. I looked again at the net contrivance in my hand; it  had a strong spring fitted to it and a line attached. Quite obviously  it was intended for snaring. \"What were you about to do?\" I demanded  sharply; but in my heart, poor fool that I was, I found admiration for  the exquisite arch of Karamaneh's lips, and reproach because they were  so tremulous.    She spoke then.    \"Dr. Petrie--\"    \"Well?\"    \"You seem to be--angry with me, not so much because--of what I do, as  because I do not remember you. Yet--\"    \"Kindly do not revert to the matter,\" I interrupted. \"You have chosen,  very conveniently, to forget that once we were friends. Please  yourself; but answer my question.\"    She clasped her hands with a sort of wild abandon.    \"Why do you treat me so?\" she cried. She had the most fascinating  accent imaginable. \"Throw me into prison, kill me if you like for what  I have done!\" She stamped her foot. \"For what I have done! But do not  torture me, try to drive me mad with your reproaches--that I forget  you! I tell you--again I tell you--that until you came one night, last  week, to rescue some one from\"--(there was the old trick of hesitating  before the name of Fu-Manchu)--\"from _him_, I had never, never seen  you!\"    The dark eyes looked into mine, afire with a positive hunger for  belief--or so I was sorely tempted to suppose. But the facts were  against her.    \"Such a declaration is worthless,\" I said, as coldly as I could. \"You  are a traitress; you betray those who are mad enough to trust you--\"    \"I am no traitress!\" she blazed at me. Her eyes were magnificent.    \"This is mere nonsense. You think that it will pay you better to serve  Fu-Manchu than to remain true to your friends. Your 'slavery'--for I  take it you are posing as a slave again--is evidently not very harsh.  You serve Fu-Manchu, lure men to their destruction, and in return he  loads you with jewels, lavishes gifts--\"    \"Ah! so!\"    She sprang forward, raising flaming eyes to mine; her lips were  slightly parted. With that wild abandon which betrayed the desert  blood in her veins, she wrenched open the neck of her bodice and  slipped a soft shoulder free of the garment. She twisted around, so  that the white skin was but inches removed from me.    \"These are some of the gifts that he lavishes upon me!\"    I clenched my teeth. Insane thoughts flooded my mind. For that creamy  skin was wealed with the marks of the lash!    She turned, quickly rearranging her dress, and watching me the while.  I could not trust myself to speak for a moment, then--    \"If I am a stranger to you, as you claim, why do you give me your  confidence?\" I asked.    \"I have known you long enough to trust you!\" she said simply, and  turned her head aside.    \"Then why do you serve this inhuman monster?\"    She snapped her fingers oddly, and looked up at me from under her  lashes. \"Why do you question me if you think that everything I say is  a lie?\"    It was a lesson in logic--from a woman! I changed the subject.    \"Tell me what you came here to do,\" I demanded.    She pointed to the net in my hands.    \"To catch birds; you have said so yourself.\"    \"What bird?\"    She shrugged her shoulders.    And now a memory was born within my brain: it was that of the cry of  the nighthawk which had harbingered the death of Forsyth! The net was  a large and strong one; could it be that some horrible fowl of the  air--some creature unknown to Western naturalists--had been released  upon the common last night? I thought of the marks upon Forsyth's face  and throat; I thought of the profound knowledge of obscure and  dreadful things possessed by the Chinaman.    The wrapping in which the net had been lay at my feet. I stooped and  took out from it a wicker basket. Karamaneh stood watching me and  biting her lip, but she made no move to check me. I opened the basket.  It contained a large phial, the contents of which possessed a pungent  and peculiar smell.    I was utterly mystified.    \"You will have to accompany me to my house,\" I said sternly.    Karamaneh upturned her great eyes to mine. They were wide with fear.  She was on the point of speaking when I extended my hand to grasp her.  At that, the look of fear was gone and one of rebellion held its  place. Ere I had time to realize her purpose, she flung back from me  with that wild grace which I had met with in no other woman,  turned--and ran!    Fatuously, net and basket in hand, I stood looking after her. The idea  of pursuit came to me certainly; but I doubted if I could outrun her.  For Karamaneh ran, not like a girl used to town or even country life,  but with the lightness and swiftness of a gazelle; ran like the  daughter of the desert that she was.    Some two hundred yards she went, stopped, and looked back. It would  seem that the sheer joy of physical effort had aroused the devil in  her, the devil that must lie latent in every woman with eyes like the  eyes of Karamaneh.    In the ever-brightening sunlight I could see the lithe figure swaying;  no rags imaginable could mask its beauty. I could see the red lips and  gleaming teeth. Then--and it was music good to hear, despite its  taunt--she laughed defiantly, turned, and ran again!    I resigned myself to defeat; I blush to add, gladly! Some evidences of  a world awakening were perceptible about me now. Feathered choirs  hailed the new day joyously. Carrying the mysterious contrivance which  I had captured from the enemy, I set out in the direction of my house,  my mind very busy with conjectures respecting the link between this  bird-snare and the cry like that of a nighthawk which we had heard at  the moment of Forsyth's death.    The path that I had chosen led me around the border of the Mound  Pond--a small pool having an islet in the centre. Lying at the margin  of the pond I was amazed to see the plate and jug which Nayland Smith  had borrowed recently.    Dropping my burden, I walked down to the edge of the water. I was  filled with a sudden apprehension. Then, as I bent to pick up the now  empty jug, came a hail:    \"All right, Petrie! Shall join you in a moment!\"    I started up, looked to right and left; but, although the voice had  been that of Nayland Smith, no sign could I discern of his presence!    \"Smith!\" I cried. \"Smith!\"    \"Coming!\"    Seriously doubting my senses, I looked in the direction from which the  voice had seemed to proceed--and there was Nayland Smith.    He stood on the islet in the centre of the pond, and, as I perceived  him, he walked down into the shallow water and waded across to me!    \"Good heavens!\" I began.    One of his rare laughs interrupted me.    \"You must think me mad this morning, Petrie!\" he said. \"But I have  made several discoveries. Do you know what that islet in the pond  really is?\"    \"Merely an islet, I suppose.\"    \"Nothing of the kind; it is a burial mound, Petrie! It marks the site  of one of the Plague Pits where victims were buried during the Great  Plague of London. You will observe that although you have seen it  every "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19145"],[0,"The Time Traders (#7)"],[1,"earlier.  As it was he fought with all his vigor to keep Kurt immobile, to try and  knock him out with a lucky blow.    In the end Kurt aided in his own defeat. When Ross relaxed somewhat, the  other pushed against him, only to have Ross flinch to one side. Kurt  could not stop himself, and his head cracked against the wheel of the  cat. He went limp.    Ross made the most of the next few moments. He brought his belt from  under his parka, twisting it around Kurt's wrists with no gentleness.  Then he wriggled about, changing places with the unconscious man.    He had no idea of where to go, but he was sure he was going to get  away--at the cat's top speed--from that point. And with that in mind and  only a limited knowledge of how to manage the machine, Ross started up  and turned in a wide circle until he was sure the cat was headed in the  opposite direction.    The light which had guided them was still on. Would reversing its  process take him back to the base? Lost in the immensity of the cold  wilderness, he made the only choice possible and gunned the cat again.          CHAPTER 4      Once again Ross sat waiting for others to decide his future. He was as  outwardly composed as he had been in Judge Rawle's chambers, but  inwardly he was far more apprehensive. Out in the wilderness of the  polar night he had had no chance for escape. Heading away from Kurt's  rendezvous, Ross had run straight into the search party from the base,  had seen in action that mechanical hound that Kurt had said they would  put on the fugitives' trail--the thing which would have gone on hunting  them until its metal rusted into powder. Kurt's boasted immunity to that  tracker had not been as good as he had believed, though it had won them  a start.    Ross did not know just how much it might count in his favor that he had  been on his way back, with Kurt a prisoner in the cat. As his waiting  hours wore on he began to think it might mean very little indeed. This  time there was no show on the wall of his cell, nothing but time to  think--too much of that--and no pleasant things to think about.    But he had learned one valuable lesson on that cold expedition.  Kelgarries and the others at the base were the most formidable  opponents he had ever met, and all the balance of luck and equipment lay  on their side of the scales. Ross was now convinced that there could be  no escape from this base. He had been impressed by Kurt's preparations,  knowing that some of them were far beyond anything he himself could have  devised. He did not doubt that Kurt had come here fully prepared with  every ingenious device the Reds could supply.    At least Kurt's friends had had a rude welcome when they did arrive at  the meeting place. Kelgarries had heard Ross out and then had sent ahead  a team. Before Ross's party had reached the base there had been a blast  which split the arctic night wide open. And Kurt, conscious by then, had  shown his only sign of emotion when he realized what it meant.    The door to Ross's cell room clicked, and he swung his feet to the  floor, sitting up on his bunk to face his future. This time he made no  attempt to put on an act. He was not in the least sorry he had tried to  get away. Had Kurt been on the level, it would have been a bright play.  That Kurt was not, was just plain bad luck.    Kelgarries and Ashe entered, and at the sight of Ashe the taut feeling  in Ross's middle loosened a bit. The major might come by himself to pass  sentence, but he would not bring Ashe along if the sentence was a really  harsh one.    \"You got off to a bad start here, Murdock.\" The major sat down on the  edge of the wall shelf which doubled as a table. \"You're going to have a  second chance, so consider yourself lucky. We know you aren't another  plant of our enemies, a fact that saves your neck. Do you have anything  to add to your story?\"    \"No, sir.\" He was not adding that \"sir\" to curry any favor; it came  naturally when one answered Kelgarries.    \"But you have some questions?\"    Ross met that with the truth. \"A lot of them.\"    \"Why don't you ask them?\"    Ross smiled thinly, an expression far removed and years older than his  bashful boy's grin of the shy act. \"A wise guy doesn't spill his  ignorance. He uses his eyes and ears and keeps his trap shut----\"    \"And goes off half cocked as a result...\" the major added. \"I don't  think you would have enjoyed the company of Kurt's paymaster.\"    \"I didn't know about him then--not when I left here.\"    \"Yes, and when you discovered the truth, you took steps. Why?\" For the  first time there was a trace of feeling in the major's voice.    \"Because I don't like the line-up on his side of the fence.\"'    \"That single fact has saved your neck this time, Murdock. Step out of  line once more, and nothing will help you. But just so we won't have to  worry about that, suppose you ask a few of those questions.\"    \"How much of what Kurt fed me is the truth?\" Ross blurted out. \"I mean  all that stuff about shooting back in time.\"    \"All of it.\" The major said it so quietly that it carried complete  conviction.    \"But why--how--?\"    \"You have us on a spot, Murdock. Because of your little expedition, we  have to tell you more now than we tell any of our men before the final  briefing. Listen, and then forget all of it except what applies to the  job at hand.    \"The Reds shot up Sputnik and then Muttnik.... When--? Twenty-five years  ago. We got up our answers a little later. There were a couple of  spectacular crashes on the moon, then that space station that didn't  stay in orbit, after that--stalemate. In the past quarter century we've  had no voyages into space, nothing that was prophesied. Too many bugs,  too many costly failures. Finally we began to get hints of something  big, bigger than any football roaming the heavens.    \"Any discovery in science comes about by steps. It can be traced back  through those steps by another scientist. But suppose you were  confronted by a result which apparently had been produced without any  preliminaries. What would be your guess concerning it?\"    Ross stared at the major. Although he didn't see what all this had to do  with time-jumping, he sensed that Kelgarries was waiting for a serious  answer, that somehow Ross would be judged by his reply.    \"Either that the steps were kept strictly secret,\" he said slowly, \"or  that the result didn't rightfully belong to the man who said he  discovered it.\"    For the first time the major regarded him with approval. \"Suppose this  discovery was vital to your life--what would you do?\"    \"Try to find the source!\"    \"There you have it! Within the past five years our friends across the  way have come up with three such discoveries. One we were able to trace,  duplicate, and use, with a few refinements of our own. The other two  remain rootless; yet they are linked with the first. We are now  attempting to solve that problem, and the time grows late. For some  reason, though the Reds now have their super, super gadgets, they are  not yet ready to use them. Sometimes the things work, and sometimes they  fail. Everything points to the fact that the Reds are now experimenting  with discoveries which are not basically their own----\"    \"Where did they get them? From another world?\" Ross's imagination came  to life. Had a successful space voyage been kept secret? Had there been  contact made with another intelligent race?    \"In a way it's another world, but the world of time--not space. Seven  years ago we got a man out of East Berlin. He was almost dead, but he  lived long enough to record on tape some amazing data, so wild it was  almost dismissed as the ravings of delirium. But that was after Sputnik,  and we didn't dare disregard any hints from the other side of the Iron  Curtain. So the recording was turned over to our scientists, who proved  it had a core of truth.    \"Time travel has been written up in fiction; it has been discussed  otherwise as an impossibility. Then we discover that the Reds have it  working----\"    \"You mean, they go into the future and bring back machines to use now.\"    The major shook his head. \"Not the future, the past.\"    Was this an elaborate joke? Somewhat heatedly Ross snapped out the  answer to that. \"Look here, I know I haven't the education of your big  brains, but I do know that the farther back you go into history the  simpler things are. We ride in cars; only a hundred years ago men drove  horses. We have guns; go back a little and you'll find them waving  swords and shooting guys with bows and arrows--those that don't wear tin  plate on them to stop being punctured----\"    \"Only they were, after all,\" commented Ashe. \"Look at Agincourt, m'lad,  and remember what arrows did to the French knights in armor.\"    Ross disregarded the interruption. \"Anyway\"--he stuck doggedly to his  point--\"the farther back you go, the simpler things are. How are the  Reds going to find anything in history we can't beat today?\"    \"That is a point which has baffled us for several years now,\" the major  returned. \"Only it is not _how_ they are going to find it, but _where_.  Because somewhere in the past of this world they have contacted a  civilization able to produce weapons and ideas so advanced as to baffle  our experts. We have to find that source and either mine it ourselves or  close it off. As yet we're still trying to find it.\"    Ross shook his head. \"It must be a long way back. Those guys who  discover tombs and dig up old cities--couldn't they give you some hints?  Wouldn't a civilization like that have left something we could find  today?\"    \"It depends,\" Ashe remarked, \"upon the type of civilization. The  Egyptians built in stone, grandly. They used tools and weapons of  copper, bronze, and stone, and they were considerate enough to operate  in a dry climate which preserved relics well. The cities of the Fertile  Crescent built in mud brick and used stone, copper,"]]]
