The other trades depended upon the proportion of their  members to the rest of the community for the estimation in which they  were held. The masons, stone-cutters, and common labourers furnished  the most important contingent; among these ought also to be reckoned  the royal servants--of whose functions we should have been at a loss  to guess the importance, if contemporary documents had not made it  clear--fishermen, hunters, laundresses, wood-cutters, gardeners, and  water-carriers.*         * The Cailliaud ostracon, which contains a receipt given to       some fishermen, was found near Sheikh Abd el-Qurneh, and       consequently belonged to the fishermen of the necropolis.       There is a question as to the water-carriers of the Khiru in       the hieratic registers of Turin, also as to the washers of       clothes, wood-cutters, gardeners and workers in the       vineyard.

Without reckoning the constant libations needed for the gods and the  deceased, the workshops required a large quantity of drinking water for  the men engaged in them. In every gang of workmen, even in the present  day, two or three men are set apart to provide drinking-water for the  rest; in some arid places, indeed, at a distance from the river, such  as the Valley of the Kings, as many water-carriers are required as there  are workmen. To the trades just mentioned must be added the low-caste  crowd depending oh the burials of the rich, the acrobats, female  mourners, dancers and musicians. The majority of the female corporations  were distinguished by the infamous character of their manners, and  prostitution among them had come to be associated with the service of  the god.*         * The heroine of the erotic papyrus of Turin bears the title       of \"Singing-woman of Amon,\" and the illustrations indicate       her profession so clearly and so expressively, that no       details of her sayings and doings are wanting.    [Illustration: 049.jpg THE GODDESS MABITSAKBO]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Lanzone.    There was no education for all this mass of people, and their religion  was of a meagre character. They worshipped the official deities, Amon,  Mut, Isis, and Hathor, and such deceased Pharaohs as Amenothes I.  and Nofritari, but they had also their own Pantheon, in which animals  predominated--such as the goose of Amon, and his ram Pa-rahaninofir,  the good player on the horn, the hippopotamus, the cat, the chicken,  the swallow, and especially reptiles. Death was personified by a great  viper, the queen of the West, known by the name Maritsakro, the friend  of silence. Three heads, or the single head of a woman, attached to the  one body, were assigned to it. It was supposed to dwell in the mountain  opposite Karnak, which fact gave to it, as well as to the necropolis  itself, the two epithets of Khafitnibus and Ta-tahnit, that is, The  Summit.*         * The abundance of the monuments of Maritsakro found at       Sheikh Abd el-Gurneh, inclines me to believe that her       sanctuary was situated in the neighbourhood of the temple of       Uazmosu, but there was also on the top of the hill another       sanctuary which would equally satisfy the name Ta-tahnit.    Its chapel was situated at the foot of the hill of Sheikh Abd el-Qurneh,  but its sacred serpents crawled and wriggled through the necropolis,  working miracles and effecting the cure of the most dangerous maladies.  The faithful were accustomed to dedicate to them, in payment of their  vows, stelas, or slabs of roughly hewn stone, with inscriptions  which witnessed to a deep gratitude. \"Hearken! I, from the time of my  appearance on earth, I was a 'Servant of the True Place,' Nofirabu, a  stupid ignorant person, who knew not good from evil, and I committed  sin against The Summit. She punished me, and I was in her hand day and  night. I lay groaning on my couch like a woman in childbed, and I made  supplication to the air, but it did not come to me, for I was hunted  down by The Summit of the West, the brave one among all the gods and all  the goddesses of the city; so I would say to all the miserable sinners  among the people of the necropolis: 'Give heed to The Summit, for there  is a lion in The Summit, and she strikes as strikes a spell-casting  Lion, and she pursues him who sins against her! 'I invoked then my  mistress, and I felt that she flew to me like a pleasant breeze;  she placed herself upon me, and this made me recognise her hand, and  appeased she returned to me, and she delivered me from suffering, for  she is my life, The Summit of the West, when she is appeased, and she  ought to be invoked!'\" There were many sinners, we may believe, among  that ignorant and superstitious population, but the governors of Thebes  did not put their confidence in the local deities alone to keep them  within bounds, and to prevent their evil deeds; commissioners, with the  help of a detachment of Mazaiu, were an additional means of conducting  them into the right way. They had, in this respect, a hard work to  accomplish, for every day brought with it its contingent of crimes,  which they had to follow up, and secure the punishment of the authors.  Nsisuamon came to inform them that the workman Nakhtummaut and his  companions had stolen into his house, and robbed him of three large  loaves, eight cakes, and some pastry; they had also drunk a jar of beer,  and poured out from pure malice the oil which they could not carry  away with them. Panibi had met the wife of a comrade alone near an  out-of-the-way tomb, and had taken advantage of her notwithstanding her  cries; this, moreover, was not the first offence of the culprit, for  several young girls had previously been victims of his brutality, and  had not ventured up to this time to complain of him on account of the  terror with which he inspired the neighbourhood. Crimes against the dead  were always common; every penniless fellow knew what quantities of gold  and jewels had been entombed with the departed, and these treasures,  scattered around them at only a few feet from the surface of the ground,  presented to them a constant temptation to which they often succumbed.  Some were not disposed to have accomplices, while others associated  together, and, having purchased at a serious cost the connivance of the  custodians, set boldly to work on tombs both recent and ancient. Not  content with stealing the funerary furniture, which they disposed of to  the undertakers, they stripped the mummies also, and smashed the  bodies in their efforts to secure the jewels; then, putting the remains  together again, they rearranged the mummies afresh so cleverly that  they can no longer be distinguished by their outward appearance from the  originals, and the first wrappings must be removed before the fraud can  be discovered. From time to time one of these rogues would allow himself  to be taken for the purpose of denouncing his comrades, and avenging  himself for the injustice of which he was the victim in the division  of the spoil; he was laid hold of by the Mazaiu, and brought before the  tribunal of justice. The lands situated on the left bank of the  Nile belonged partly to the king and partly to the god Amon, and any  infraction of the law in regard to the necropolis was almost certain  to come within the jurisdiction of one or other of them. The commission  appointed, therefore, to determine the damage done in any case, included  in many instances the high priest or his delegates, as well as the  officers of the Pharaoh. The office of this commission was to examine  into the state of the tombs, to interrogate the witnesses and the  accused, applying the torture if necessary: when they had got at the  facts, the tribunal of the notables condemned to impalement some half  a dozen of the poor wretches, and caused some score of others to be  whipped.* But, when two or three months had elapsed, the remembrance of  the punishment began to die away, and the depredations began afresh. The  low rate of wages occasioned, at fixed periods, outbursts of discontent  and trouble which ended in actual disturbances. The rations allowed to  each workman, and given to him at the beginning of each month, would  possibly have been sufficient for himself and his family, but, owing to  the usual lack of foresight in the Egyptian, they were often consumed  long before the time fixed, and the pinch soon began to be felt. The  workmen, demoralised by their involuntary abstinence, were not slow to  turn to the overseer; \"We are perishing of hunger, and there are still  eighteen days before the next month.\" The latter was prodigal of fair  speeches, but as his words were rarely accompanied by deeds, the  workmen would not listen to him; they stopped work, left the workshop in  turbulent crowds, ran with noisy demonstrations to some public place to  hold a meeting--perhaps the nearest monument, at the gate of the temple  of Thutmosis III.,** behind the chapel of Minephtah,*** or in the court  of that of Seti I.         * This is how I translate a fairly common expression, which       means literally, \"to be put on the wood.\" Spiegelberg sees in       this only a method of administering torture.         ** Perhaps the chapel of Uazmosu, or possibly the free space       before the temple of Deir el-Bahari.         *** The site of this chapel was discovered by Prof. Petrie       in the spring of 1896. It had previously been supposed to be       a temple of Amenothes III.    Their overseers followed them; the police commissioners of the locality,  the Mazaiu, and the scribes mingled with them and addressed themselves  to some of the leaders with whom they might be acquainted."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17327"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 7 (of 12) (#7)"],[1,"everything in  his alarm--palace, treasures, harem, and even his chariot.* A body of  Assyrians pursued him hotly beyond the fords of the Lallu, chasing him  as far as Mount Itini; then, retracing their steps to headquarters, they  at once set out on a fresh track, crossed the Idir, and proceeded to lay  waste the plains of Ilaniu and Suani.**         * This raid, which started from the same point as the       preceding one, ran eastwards in an opposite direction and       ended at Mount Itini. Leaving the fief of Arashtua in the       neighbourhood of Suleimaniyeh, Assur-nazir-pal crossed the       chain of the Azmir-dagh near Pir-Omar and Gudrun, where we       must place Mounts Lara and Bidirgi, and emerged upon Zamru;       the only-places which appear to correspond to Zamru in that       region are Kandishin and Suleimanabad. Hence the Lallu is       the river which runs by Kandishin and Suleimanabad, and       Itini the mountain which separates this river from the       Tchami-Kizildjik.         ** I think we may recognise the ancient name of Ilaniu in       that of Alan, now borne by a district on the Turkish and       Persian frontier, situated between Kunekd ji-dagh and the       town of Serdesht. The expedition, coming from the fief of       Arashtua, must have marched northwards: the Idir in this       case must be the Tchami-Kizildjik, and Mount Sabua the chain       of mountains above Serdesht.    Despairing of taking Amika prisoner, Assur-nazir-pal allowed him to lie  hidden among the brushwood of Mount Sabua, while he himself called  a halt at Parsindu,* and set to work to organise the fruits of his  conquest.         * Parsindu, mentioned between Mount Ilaniu and the town of       Zamru, ought to lie somewhere in the valley of Tchami-       Kizildjik, near Murana.    He placed garrisons in the principal towns---at Parsindu, Zamru, and  at Arakdi in Lullume, which one of his predecessors had re-named  Tukulti-Ashshur-azbat,* --\"I have taken the help of Assur.\" He next  imposed on the surrounding country an annual tribute of gold,  silver, lead, copper, dyed stuffs, oxen, sheep, and wine. Envoys from  neighbouring kings poured in--from Khudun; Khubushkia, and Gilzan, and  the whole of Northern Zamua bowed \"before the splendour of his arms;\" it  now needed only a few raids resolutely directed against Mounts Azira and  Simaki, as far as the Turn at, to achieve the final pacification of the  South. While in this neighbourhood, his attention was directed to the  old town of Atlila,** built by Sibir,*** an ancient king of Karduniash,  but which had been half ruined by the barbarians. He re-named it  Dur-Assur, \"the fortress of Assur,\" and built himself within it a palace  and storehouses, in which he accumulated large quantities of corn,  making the town the strongest bulwark of his power on the Cossaean  border.         *The approximate site of Arakdi is indicated in the       itinerary of Assur-nazir-pal itself; the king comes from       Zamru in the neighbourhood of Sulei-manabad, crosses Mount       Lara, which is the northern part of the Azmir-dagh, and       arrives at Arakdi, possibly somewhere in Surtash. In the       course of the preceding campaign, after having laid waste       Bara, he set out from this same town (Arakdi) to subdue       Nishpi, all of which bears out the position I have       indicated. The present town of Bazian would answer fairly       well for the site of a place destined to protect the       Assyrian frontier on this side.         ** Given its position on the Chaldaean frontier, Atlila is       probably to be identified with the Kerkuk of the present       day.         *** Hommel is inclined to believe that Sibir was the       immediate predecessor of Nabubaliddin, who reigned at       Babylon at the same time as Assur-nazir-pal at Nineveh;       consequently he would be a contemporary of Ramman-nirari       III. and of Tukulti-ninip II. Peiser and Rost have       identified him with Simmash-shikhu.    [Illustration: 037.jpg THE ZAB BELOW THE PASSES OF ALAN, THE ANCIENT  ILANIU]         Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph by M. de Morgan.    The two campaigns of B.C. 882 and 881 had cost Assur-nazir-pal great  efforts, and their results had been inadequate to the energy expended.  His two principal adversaries, Nurramman and Amika, had eluded him, and  still preserved their independence at the eastern extremities of their  former states. Most of the mountain tribes had acknowledged the king's  supremacy merely provisionally, in order to rid themselves of his  presence; they had been vanquished scores of times, but were in no sense  subjugated, and the moment pressure was withdrawn, they again took  up arms. The districts of Zamua alone, which bordered on the Assyrian  plain, and had been occupied by a military force, formed a province, a  kind of buffer state between the mountain tribes and the plains of the  Zab, protecting the latter from incursions.    Assur-nazir-pal, feeling himself tolerably safe on that side, made no  further demands, and withdrew his battalions to the westward part of his  northern frontier. He hoped, no doubt, to complete the subjugation of  the tribes who still contested the possession of various parts of  the Kashiari, and then to push forward his main guard as far as the  Euphrates and the Arzania, so as to form around the plain of Amidi a  zone of vassals or tutelary subjects like those of Zamua. With this end  in view, he crossed the Tigris near its source at the traditional fords,  and made his way unmolested in the bend of the Euphrates from the palace  of Tilluli, where the accustomed tribute of Kummukh was brought to him,  to the fortress of Ishtarati, and from thence to Kibaki. The town of  Matiate, having closed its gates against him, was at once sacked, and  this example so stimulated the loyalty of the Kurkhi chiefs, that  they ha*tened to welcome him at the neighbouring military station of  Zazabukha. The king's progress continued thence as before, broken by  frequent halts at the most favourable points for levying contributions  on the inhabitants.1 Assur-nazir-pal encountered no serious difficulty  except on the northern slopes of the Kashiari, but there again fortune  smiled on him; all the contested positions were soon ceded to him,  including even Madara, whose fourfold circuit of walls did not avail to  save it from the conqueror.** After a brief respite at Tushkhan, he set  out again one evening with his lightest chariots and the pick of his  horsemen, crossed the Tigris on rafts, rode all night, and arrived  unexpectedly the next morning before Pitura, the chief town of the  Dirrabans.*** It was surrounded by a strong double enceinte, through  which he broke after forty-eight hours of continuous assault: 800 of  its men perished in the breach, and 700 others were impaled before the  gates.         * It is difficult to place any of these localities on the       map: they ought all to be found between the ford of the       Tigris, at Diarbeldr and the Euphrates, probably at the foot       of the Mihrab-dagh and the Kirwantchernen-dagh.         ** Madara belonged to a certain Lapturi, son of Tubusi,       mentioned in the campaign of the king's second year. In       comparing the facts given in the two passages, we see it was       situated on the eastern slope of the Kashiari, not far from       Tushkhan on one side, and Ardupa--that is probably Mardin--?       on the other. The position of Ortaveran, or of one of the       \"tells\" in its neighbourhood, answers fairly well to these       conditions.         *** According to the details given in the _Annals_, we must       place the town of Bitura (or Pitura) at about 19 miles from       Kurkh, on the other side of the Tigris, in a north-easterly       direction, and consequently the country of Lirra would be       between the Hazu-tchai and the Batman-tchai. The Matni, with       its passes leading in to Nairi, must in this case be the       mountain group to the north of Mayafarrikin, known as the       Dordoseh-dagh or the Darkosh-dagh.    Arbaki, at the extreme limits of Eirkhi, was the next to succumb, after  which the Assyrians, having pillaged Dirra, carried the passes of Matni  after a bloody combat, spread themselves over Nairi, burning 250 of its  towns and villages, and returned with immense booty to Tushkhan. They  had been there merely a few days when the newt arrived that the people  of Bit-Zamani, always impatient of the yoke, had murdered their  prince Ammibaal, and had proclaimed a certain Burramman in his place.  Assur-nazir-pal marched upon Sinabux and repressed the insurrection,  reaping a rich harvest of spoil--chariots fully equipped, 600  draught-horses, 130 pounds of silver and as much of gold, 6600 pounds of  lead and the same of copper, 19,800 pounds of iron, stuffs, furniture  in gold and ivory, 2000 bulls, 500 sheep, the entire harem of Ammibaal,  besides a number of maidens of noble family together with their dresses.  Burramman was by the king's order flayed alive, and Arteanu his brother  chosen as his successor. Sinabu* and the surrounding towns formed part  of that network of colonies which in times past Shalmaneser I. had  organised as a protection from the incursions of the inhabitants of  Nairi; Assur-nazir-pal now used it as a rallying-place for the remaining  Assyrian families, to whom he distributed lands and confided the  guardianship of the neighbouring strongholds.         * Hommel thinks that Sinabu is very probably the same as the       Kinabu mentioned above; but it appears from Assur-nazir-       pal's own account that this Kinabu was in the province of       Khalzidipkha (Khalzilukha) on the Kashiari, whereas Sinabu       was in Bit-Zamani.    The results of this measure were not long in making themselves felt:  Shupria, Ulliba, and Nirbu, besides other districts, paid their dues  to the king, and Shura in Khamanu,* which"]]]
