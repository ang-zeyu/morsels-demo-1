In this order, we begin the descent; sometimes on foot, sometimes  shuffling on the ice; always proceeding much more quietly and slowly  than on our upward way; and constantly alarmed by the falling among us  of somebody from behind, who endangers the footing of the whole party,  and clings pertinaciously to anybody's ankles. It is impossible for the  litter to be in advance, too, as the track has to be made; and its  appearance behind us, overhead--with some one or other of the bearers  always down, and the rather heavy gentleman with his legs always in the  air--is very threatening and frightful. We have gone on thus, a very  little way, painfully and anxiously, but quite merrily, and regarding it  as a great success--and have all fallen several times, and have all been  stopt, somehow or other, as we were sliding away when Mr. Pickle of  Portici, in the act of remarking on these uncommon circumstances as  quite beyond his experience, stumbles, falls, disengages himself, with  quick presence of mind, from those about him, plunges away head  foremost, and rolls, over and over, down the whole surface of the cone!    Giddy, and bloody, and a mere bundle of rags, is Pickle of Portici when  we reach the place where we dismounted, and where the horses are  waiting; but, thank God, sound in limb! And never are we likely to be  more glad to see a man alive and on his feet, than to see him  now--making light of it too, tho sorely bruised and in great pain. The  boy is brought into the Hermitage on the Mountain, while we are at  supper, with his head tied up; and the man is heard of, some hours  afterward. He, too, is bruised and stunned, but has broken no bones; the  snow having, fortunately, covered all the larger blocks of rock and  stone, and rendered them harmless.          CASTELLAMARE AND SORRENTO[11]    BY HIPPOLYTE ADOLPHE TAINE      The sky is almost clear. Only above Naples hangs a bank of clouds, and  around Vesuvius huge white masses of smoke, moving and stationary. I  never yet saw, even in summer at Marseilles, the blue of the sea so  deep, bordering even on hardness. Above this powerful lustrous azure,  absorbing three-quarters of the visible space, the white sky seems to be  a firmament of crystal. As we recede we obtain a better view of the  undulating coast, embraced in one grand mountain form, all its parts  uniting like the members of one body. Ischia and the naked promontories  on the extreme end repose in their lilac envelop, like a slumbering  Pompeiian nymph under her veil. Veritably, to paint such nature as this,  this violet continent extending around this broad luminous water, one  must employ the terms of the ancient poets, and represent the great  fertile goddess embraced and beset by the eternal ocean, and above them  the serene effulgence of the dazzling Jupiter.    We encounter on the road some fine faces with long elegant features,  quite Grecian; some intelligent noble-looking girls, and here and there  hideous mendicants cleaning their hairy breasts. But the race is much  superior to that of Naples, where it is deformed and diminutive, the  young girls there appearing like stunted, pallid grisets. The railroad  skirts the sea a few paces off and almost on a level with it. A harbor  appears blackened with lines of rigging, and then a mole, consisting of  a small half-ruined fort, reflecting a clear sharp shadow in the  luminous expanse. Surrounding this rise square houses, gray as if  charred, and heaped together like tortoises under round roofs, serving  them as a sort of thick shell.    On this fertile soil, full of cinders, cultivation extends to the shore  and forms gardens; a simple reed hedge protects them from the sea and  the wind; the Indian fig with its clumsy thorny leaves clings to the  slopes; verdure begins to appear on the branches of the trees, the  apricots showing their smiling pink blossoms; half-naked men work the  friable soil without apparent effort; a few square gardens contain  columns and small statues of white marble. Everywhere you behold traces  of antique beauty and joyousness. And why wonder at this when you feel  that you have the divine vernal sun for a companion, and on the right,  whenever you turn to the sea, its flaming golden waves.    With what facility you here forget all ugly objects! I believe I passed  at Castellamare some unsightly modern structures, a railroad station,  hotels, a guard-house, and a number of rickety vehicles hurrying along  in quest of fares. This is all effaced from my mind; nothing remains but  impressions of obscure porches with glimpses of bright courts filled  with glossy oranges and spring verdure, of esplanades with children  playing on them and nets drying, and happy idlers snuffing the breeze  and contemplating the capricious heaving of the tossing sea.    On leaving Castellamare the road forms a corniche[12] winding along the  bank. Huge white rocks, split off from the cliffs above, lie below in  the midst of the eternally besieging waves. On the left the mountains  lift their shattered pinnacles, fretted walls, and projecting crags, all  that scaffolding of indentations which strike you as the ruins of a line  of rocked and tottering fortresses. Each projection, each mass throws  its shadow on the surrounding white surfaces, the entire range being  peopled with tints and forms.    Sometimes the mountain is rent in twain, and the sides of the chasm are  lined with cultivation, descending in successive stages. Sorrento is  thus built on three deep ravines. All these hollows contain gardens,  crowded with masses of trees overhanging each other. Nut-trees, already  lively with sap, project their white branches like gnarled fingers;  everything else is green; winter lays no hand on this eternal spring.  The thick lustrous leaf of the orange-tree rises from amid the foliage  of the olive, and its golden apples glisten in the sun by thousands,  interspersed with gleams of the pale lemon; often in these shady lanes  do its glittering leaves flash out above the crest of the walls. This is  the land of the orange. It grows even in miserable court-yards,  alongside of dilapidated steps, spreading its luxuriant tops everywhere  in the bright sunlight. The delicate aromatic odor of all these opening  buds and blossoms is a luxury of kings, which here a beggar enjoys for  nothing.    I passed an hour in the garden of the hotel, a terrace overlooking the  sea about half-way up the bank. A scene like this fills the imagination  with a dream of perfect bliss. The house stands in a luxurious garden,  filled with orange and lemon-trees, as heavily laden with fruit as those  of a Normandy orchard; the ground at the foot of the trees is covered  with it. Clusters of foliage and shrubbery of a pale green, bordering on  blue, occupy intermediate spaces. The rosy blossoms of the peach, so  tender and delicate, bloom on its naked branches. The walks are of  bright blue porcelain, and the terrace displays its round verdant  masses overhanging the sea, of which the lovely azure fills all space.    I have not yet spoken of my impressions after leaving Castellamare. The  charm was only too great. The pure sky, the pale azure almost  transparent, the radiant blue sea as chaste and tender as a virgin  bride, this infinite expanse so exquisitely adorned as if for a festival  of rare delight, is a sensation that has no equal. Capri and Ischia on  the line of the sky lie white in their soft vapory tissue, and the  divine azure gently fades away surrounded by this border of brightness.    Where find words to express all this? The gulf seemed like a marble vase  purposely rounded to receive the sea. The satin sheen of a flower, the  soft luminous petals of the velvet orris with shimmering sunshine on  their pearly borders, such are the images that fill the mind, and which  accumulate in vain and are ever inadequate. The water at the base of  these rocks is now a transparent emerald, reflecting the tints of topaz  and amethyst; again a liquid diamond, changing its hue according to the  shifting influences of rock and depth; or again a flashing diadem,  glittering with the splendor of this divine effulgence.          CAPRI[13]    BY AUGUSTUS J. C. HARE      The Island of Capri (in the dialect of the people Crapi), the ancient  Capreae, is a huge limestone rock, a continuation of the mountain range  which forms the southern boundary of the Bay of Naples. Legend says that  it was once inhabited by a people called Teleboae, subject to a king  called Telon. Augustus took possession of Capreae as part of the  imperial domains, and repeatedly visited it. His stepson Tiberius (A.D.  27) established his permanent residence on the island, and spent the  latter years of his life there, abandoning himself to the voluptuous  excesses which gave him the name of Caprineus....    The first point usually visited in Capri is the Blue Grotto (Grotta  Azzurra), which is entered from the sea by an arch under the wall of  limestone cliff, only available when the sea is perfectly calm. Visitors  have to lie flat down in the boat, which is carried in by the wave and  is almost level with the top of the arch. Then they suddenly find  themselves in a magical scene. The water is liquid sapphire, and the  whole rocky vaulting of the cavern shimmers to its inmost recesses with  a pale blue light of marvelous beauty. A man stands ready to plunge into  the water when the boats from the steamers arrive, and to swim about;  his body, in the water, then sparkles like a sea-god with phosphorescent  silver; his head, out of the water, is black like that of a Moor.  Nothing can exaggerate the beauty of the Blue Grotto, and perhaps the  effect is rather enhanced than spoiled by the shouting of the boatmen,  the rush of boats to the entrance, the confusion on leaving and reaching  the steamers.

Now they had fought because  they could not agree whether they should enjoy these things in common or  separately.    \"Suppose we make a bargain,\" said the man; \"it is true I have no money,  but I have other things yet more valuable to exchange for these; I must,  however, make trial of them beforehand, to see if you have spoken truth  concerning them.\"    So they let him mount the horse, and put the cloak round him, and they  gave him the stick into his hand, and as soon as he had all this he was  no longer to be seen; but laying about him well, he gave them all a  sound thrashing, crying out,    \"Now, you good-for-nothing fellows, you have got what you deserve;  perhaps you will be satisfied now!\"    Then he rode up the glass mountain, and when he reached the castle gates  he found them locked; but he beat with his stick upon the door and it  opened at once. And he walked in, and up the stairs to the great room  where sat the Princess with a golden cup and wine before her: she could  not see him so long as the cloak was on him, but drawing near to her he  pulled off the ring she had given him, and threw it into the cup with a  clang.    \"This is my ring,\" she cried, \"and the man who is to set me free must be  here too!\"    But though she sought through the whole castle she found him not; he had  gone outside, seated himself on his horse, and thrown off the cloak. And  when she came to look out at the door, she saw him and shrieked out for  joy; and he dismounted and took her in his arms, and she kissed him,  saying,    \"Now hast thou set me free from my enchantment, and to-morrow we will be  married.\"          THE FROG PRINCE      IN the old times, when it was still of some use to wish for the thing  one wanted, there lived a King whose daughters were all handsome, but  the youngest was so beautiful that the sun himself, who has seen so  much, wondered each time he shone over her because of her beauty. Near  the royal castle there was a great dark wood, and in the wood under an  old linden-tree was a well; and when the day was hot, the King's  daughter used to go forth into the wood and sit by the brink of the cool  well, and if the time seemed long, she would take out a golden ball, and  throw it up and catch it again, and this was her favourite pastime.    Now it happened one day that the golden ball, instead of falling back  into the maiden's little hand which had sent it aloft, dropped to the  ground near the edge of the well and rolled in. The king's daughter  followed it with her eyes as it sank, but the well was deep, so deep  that the bottom could not be seen. Then she began to weep, and she wept  and wept as if she could never be comforted. And in the midst of her  weeping she heard a voice saying to her,    \"What ails thee, king's daughter? thy tears would melt a heart of  stone.\"    And when she looked to see where the voice came from, there was nothing  but a frog stretching his thick ugly head out of the water.    \"Oh, is it you, old waddler?\" said she; \"I weep because my golden ball  has fallen into the well.\"    \"Never mind, do not weep,\" answered the frog; \"I can help you; but what  will you give me if I fetch up your ball again?\"    \"Whatever you like, dear frog,\" said she; \"any of my clothes, my pearls  and jewels, or even the golden crown that I wear.\"    \"Thy clothes, thy pearls and jewels, and thy golden crown are not for  me,\" answered the frog; \"but if thou wouldst love me, and have me for  thy companion and play-fellow, and let me sit by thee at table, and eat  from thy plate, and drink from thy cup, and sleep in thy little bed,--if  thou wouldst promise all this, then would I dive below the water and  fetch thee thy golden ball again.\"    \"Oh yes,\" she answered; \"I will promise it all, whatever you want, if  you will only get me my ball again.\"    But she thought to herself, \"What nonsense he talks! as if he could do  anything but sit in the water and croak with the other frogs, or could  possibly be any one's companion.\"    But the frog, as soon as he heard her promise, drew his head under the  water and sank down out of sight, but after a while he came to the  surface again with the ball in his mouth, and he threw it on the grass.    The King's daughter was overjoyed to see her pretty play-thing again,  and she caught it up and ran off with it.    \"Stop, stop!\" cried the frog; \"take me up too; I cannot run as fast as  you!\"    But it was of no use, for croak, croak after her as he might, she would  not listen to him, but made haste home, and very soon forgot all about  the poor frog, who had to betake himself to his well again.    The next day, when the King's daughter was sitting at table with the  King and all the court, and eating from her golden plate, there came  something pitter patter up the marble stairs, and then there came a  knocking at the door, and a voice crying \"Youngest King's daughter, let  me in!\"    And she got up and ran to see who it could be, but when she opened the  door, there was the frog sitting outside. Then she shut the door hastily  and went back to her seat, feeling very uneasy. The King noticed how  quickly her heart was beating, and said,    \"My child, what are you afraid of? is there a giant standing at the door  ready to carry you away?\"    \"Oh no,\" answered she; \"no giant, but a horrid frog.\"    \"And what does the frog want?\" asked the King.    \"O dear father,\" answered she, \"when I was sitting by the well  yesterday, and playing with my golden ball, it fell into the water, and  while I was crying for the loss of it, the frog came and got it again  for me on condition I would let him be my companion, but I never thought  that he could leave the water and come after me; but now there he is  outside the door, and he wants to come in to me.\"    And then they all heard him knocking the second time and crying,        \"Youngest King's daughter,      Open to me!      By the well water      What promised you me?      Youngest King's daughter      Now open to me!\"    \"That which thou hast promised must thou perform,\" said the King; \"so go  now and let him in.\"    So she went and opened the door, and the frog hopped in, following at  her heels, till she reached her chair. Then he stopped and cried,    \"Lift me up to sit by you.\"    But she delayed doing so until the King ordered her. When once the frog  was on the chair, he wanted to get on the table, and there he sat and  said,    \"Now push your golden plate a little nearer, so that we may eat  together.\"    And so she did, but everybody might see how unwilling she was, and the  frog feasted heartily, but every morsel seemed to stick in her throat.    \"I have had enough now,\" said the frog at last, \"and as I am tired, you  must carry me to your room, and make ready your silken bed, and we will  lie down and go to sleep.\"    Then the King's daughter began to weep, and was afraid of the cold frog,  that nothing would satisfy him but he must sleep in her pretty clean  bed. Now the King grew angry with her, saying,    \"That which thou hast promised in thy time of necessity, must thou now  perform.\"    So she picked up the frog with her finger and thumb, carried him  upstairs and put him in a corner, and when she had lain down to sleep,  he came creeping up, saying, \"I am tired and want sleep as much as you;  take me up, or I will tell your father.\"    Then she felt beside herself with rage, and picking him up, she threw  him with all her strength against the wall, crying,    \"Now will you be quiet, you horrid frog!\"    But as he fell, he ceased to be a frog, and became all at once a prince  with beautiful kind eyes. And it came to pass that, with her father's  consent, they became bride and bridegroom. And he told her how a wicked  witch had bound him by her spells, and how no one but she alone could  have released him, and that they two would go together to his father's  kingdom. And there came to the door a carriage drawn by eight white  horses, with white plumes on their heads, and with golden harness, and  behind the carriage was standing faithful Henry, the servant of the  young prince. Now, faithful Henry had suffered such care and pain when  his master was turned into a frog, that he had been obliged to wear  three iron bands over his heart, to keep it from breaking with trouble  and anxiety. When the carriage started to take the prince to his  kingdom, and faithful Henry had helped them both in, he got up behind,  and was full of joy at his master's deliverance. And when they had gone  a part of the way, the prince heard a sound at the back of the carriage,  as if something had broken, and he turned round and cried,    \"Henry, the wheel must be breaking!\" but Henry answered,        \"The wheel does not break,      'Tis the band round my heart      That, to lessen its ache,      When I grieved for your sake,      I bound round my heart.\"    Again, and yet once again there was the same sound, and the prince  thought it must be the wheel breaking, but it was the breaking of the  other bands from faithful Henry's heart, because it was now so relieved  and happy.          CAT & MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP.      A CAT having made acquaintance with a mouse, professed such great love  and friendship for her, that the mouse at last agreed that they should  live and keep house together.    \"We must make provision for the winter,\" said the cat, \"or we shall  suffer hunger, and you, little mouse, must not stir out, or you will be  caught in a trap.\"    So they took counsel together and bought a little pot of fat. And then  they could not tell where to put it for safety, but after long  consideration the cat said there could not be a better place than the  church, for nobody would"]]]
