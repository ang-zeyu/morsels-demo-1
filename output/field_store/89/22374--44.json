For clarity we might indicate the mind and its functions in the  following diagram:            / Emotion        { Pleasure                                \\          {                { Pain                                    }          {                                   / Eye                  }          {                                   { Ear                  }          {                / Sensation        / Nose                 }          {                {   (impression   <  Mouth                }          {                {   on mind from   \\ Skin                 }          {                {   some organs)   { Muscles              }          {                {                  { Viscera              }          {                {                  \\ General sensation    }          {                {                                         }          {                {  Perception            }                }          {                {    (recognition of      > of object     }          /                {    cause of sensation) }  of quality    \\   Mind <   Intellect, or  /                                           > Mind          \\   the Stream <              { Self                       /          {   of Thought   \\            { Organic                    }          {                {  Memory   <  Inorganic                  }          {                {            { Percept                    }          {                {            { Concept                    }          {                {                                         }          {                {            { Abstract                   }          {                {  Ideation <  Concrete                   }          {                {            { Imaginative { Fanciful     }          {                {                          { Constructive }          {                {  Reason                                 }          {                \\  Judgment                               }          \\ Will                                                     /    The following terms are ones constantly used in psychology, and are  briefly defined that there may be no haziness in their application.    _Sensation_ is the uninterpreted response of the mind to stimuli brought  by sense organs.                            { hot.    Examples: Feeling of  { cold.                          { pain.    Sensation may arouse instinct and cause reflex action, or start a  feeling state, or a train of thought.    _Perception_ is the conscious recognition of the cause of a given  sensation.               { fluid--water.    Example: { cold--snow.             { pain--cut.    _Percept_ is a word often used to denote the mind's immediate image of  the thing perceived.    Percepts are of two kinds: object and quality.      Example: { object, as water.             { quality, as fluid.    _Memory_ is the mind's faculty of retaining, recognizing, and  reproducing sensations, percepts, and concepts.    _Organic memory_ is the mind's reproduction of past bodily sensations.    Example: I recall the physical sensations of a chill, and live it over  in my mind, so that I can accurately describe how a chill feels to me,  though I can but surmise how one feels to you.    _Inorganic memory_ is the mind's reproduction of its own reactions in  the past.    Example: Myself having a chill, how I acted; what I thought and my  emotions during that chill.    _Ideation_ is the mind's grouping of percepts by the aid of memory, to  form concepts.    Example: I perceive color, form, mouth, eyes, nose, chin, etc. These  percepts I combine as a result of past experience (memory) to form my  concept, _face_; and the process of combining is ideation.    _Concepts_ are mental representations of things or qualities,  _i. e._, of object or quality percepts.    We might say that the percept is the mind's immediate image of a thing  or quality, and the concept is the result of the storing up and grouping  and recombining of percepts. Thus a lasting mental picture is secured;  and my idea of horse, for instance, is so clear and definite a thing in  my mind that if I should never again see a particular horse, I should  yet always be able to think accurately of a horse.    Concepts are of two kinds--concrete and abstract.    A _concrete concept_, or concrete idea (for concept and idea are  interchangeably used), is an idea of a particular object or quality.      Examples: This wine-sap apple (object concept).              This sweet orange (quality concept).    An _abstract concept_, or abstract idea, is a mental reproduction of a  quality or an object dissociated from any particular setting or  particular experience.    Abstract ideas are of two kinds. We speak of them as _abstract object  concepts_ and as _abstract quality concepts_. An _abstract object  concept_ we might call a generalized idea, an idea comprehending all  objects having certain things in common.    Example: My idea of animal includes many scores of very different  individual animals, but they all have bodies and heads and extremities.  They all have some kind of digestive apparatus; they breathe, and can  move.    An _abstract quality concept_ is easier to think than to explain. It is  as though the mind in considering a multitude of different objects found  a certain quality common to many of them, and it \"abstracted,\" _i. e._,  drew this particular quality, and only this, from them all, and then  imagined it as a something in itself which it calls _redness_, or  _whiteness_, or _goodness_. Thereafter, whenever it finds something like  it anywhere else again it says, \"That is like my redness.\" So I call it  \"red.\" In other words, consciousness thereafter can determine in a newly  discovered object something it knows well merely because that something  corresponds to a representation which experience and memory have already  formed.    These comprehensive concepts, or _universals_, as some psychologists  term them, the mind, having pieced together from experience and memory,  holds as independent realities, not primarily belonging to _this_ or  _that_, but lending themselves to this or that. For example: My mind  says \"white,\" and sees white in some object. But I see the white only  because my mind has a quality concept, _whiteness_. This outside object  corresponds to my concept. I recognize the likeness and call it \"white.\"    I speak of goodness, or purity, of benevolence; or of fulness,  emptiness, scantiness. There is no object or quality in the outside  world I can say is goodness, or fulness. But I do see things in the  external world through my ideas of goodness or fulness that correspond  to these ideas. They have some of the qualities the ideas embrace; and  so I point them out and say, \"This represents purity; that, impurity\";  or, \"This is full, that is empty.\" One satisfies my concept of purity,  while the other does not. One fulfils my concept of fulness; the other  does not. And because we can never point out any one quality in the  outside world and say \"This is purity, and all of purity; this is  goodness; or this good plus this good plus this makes all of goodness\";  because of this impossibility we speak of these concepts as having  reality somewhere. They are _absolutes_, _universals_, _abstract quality  concepts_--the unfound all of which the things we call pure and good are  but the part.    _Apperception_ is the process of comparing the new with all that is in  the mind, and of classifying it by its likeness to something already  there.    With an abstract idea of an object in mind we very deftly, through the  use of memory and constructive imagination, deduce the whole from the  part recognized as familiar.    Example: In walking through the field, along the bank of the brook, I  glimpse under the low-hanging branches of the weeping willow a  restlessly moving hoof. I see a certain kind of hoof and only that. Or I  hear a lowing sound. And I say \"cow.\" I have not seen a cow, but only a  part which tells me a cow is there; for all the cows I ever saw had  hoofs of that general description, and so it fits into my concept _cow_,  and into no others. Or I have heard cows, only, give that lowing sound  before. From my perception, then, of hoof or sound I apperceive _cow_.  Memory relates that hoof or that lowing sound to a certain kind of  animal known in the past; and constructive imagination draws in all the  rest of the picture that belongs with it.    Again, we may apperceive an object or quality from our recognition of  something which in our experience has been associated, under those  particular circumstances, with only that object or quality. I see smoke  on the ocean's far horizon, and I decide instantly, \"a steamer.\" I have  not perceived any steamer, but only something that \"goes with it,\" as it  were. I see the ship with my mind, not with my eyes; for I know that a  cloud of smoke out there always has, in my past experience, represented  just that. I compare the newly appearing stimulus--smoke in that  particular location--with all that is associated with it in my mind,  and classify it with the known. I apperceive \"steamer.\"    In apperception, then, we construct from the known actually perceived by  the senses, the unknown. How does the child realize that the moving  speck on the distant hillside is his father? There is nothing to  indicate it except that it is black and moves in this direction. But  experience tells Johnny that father comes home that way just about this  time. Moreover, it says that father looks so when at that distance. When  Johnny is as sure it is his father as if he could see his face close  beside him he has apperceived him. The speck on the hill is the newly  arriving stimulus. Johnny compares it with what corresponds to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18845"],[0,"Seeing Europe with Famous Authors, Volume 7 (#7)"],[1,"it is impossible to  describe....    The pavement of the Pantheon, composed of porphyry, pavonazzetto, and  giallo antico, tho constantly overflowed by the Tiber, and drenched by  the rains which fall upon it from the roof, is the finest in Rome. There  is an opening in the center, through which the water entering by the  dome is carried off into a reservoir.    The Pantheon has a peculiar interest in the history of art, as the  burial place of Raphael. His grave was opened in 1833, and the remains  found to be lying in the spot which Vasari had pointed out.          HADRIAN'S TOMB[11]    BY RODOLFO LANCIANI      Nerva was the last Emperor buried in the mausoleum of Augustus.[12]  Trajan's ashes were laid to rest in an urn of gold under his monumental  column. Hadrian determined to raise a new tomb for himself and his  successors, and, like Augustus, selected a site on the green and shady  banks of the Tiber, not on the city side, however, but in the gardens of  Domitia, which, with those of Agrippina, formed a crown property called  by Tacitus \"Nero's Gardens.\" The mausoleum and the bridge which  gave access to it were substantially finished in A.D. 136.  Antoninus Pius, after completing the ornamental part in 139, transferred  to it Hadrian's ashes from their temporary burial-place in the former  villa of Cicero at Puteoli, and was himself afterward interred there....    Beside the passages of the \"Hadrian's Life,\" and of Dion Cassius, two  descriptions of the monument have come down to us, one by Procopius, the  other by Leo I. From these we learn that it was composed of a square  basement of moderate height, each side of which measured 247 feet. It  was faced with blocks of Parian marble, with pilasters at the corners,  crowned by a capital. Above the pilasters were groups of men and horses  in bronze, of admirable workmanship. The basement was protected around  by a sidewalk and a railing of gilt bronze, supported by marble pillars  crowned with gilded peacocks, two of which are in the Giardino della  Pigna, in the Vatican. A grand circular mole, nearly a thousand feet in  circumference, and also faced with blocks of Parian marble, stood on the  square basement and supported in its turn a cone of earth covered with  evergreens, like the mausoleum of Augustus.    Of this magnificent decoration nothing now remains except a few blocks  of the coating of marble, on the east side of the quadrangle, near the  Bastione di S. Giovanni. All that is visible of the ancient work from  the outside are the blocks of peperino of the mole which once supported  the outer casing. The rest, both above and below, is covered by the  works of fortification constructed at various periods, from the time of  Honorius (393-403) to our own days. In no other monument of ancient and  medieval Rome is our history written, molded, as it were, so vividly, as  upon the battered remains of this castle-tomb. Within and around it took  place all the fights for dominion with which popes, emperors, barons,  barbarians, Romans, have distracted the city for fifteen hundred years.    Of the internal arrangement of the monument nothing was known until  1825, when the principal door was discovered in the middle of the square  basement facing the bridge. It opens upon a corridor leading to a large  niche, which, it is conjectured, contained a statue of Hadrian. The  walls of this vestibule, by which modern visitors generally begin their  inspection, are built of travertine, and bear evidence of having been  paneled with Numidian marble. The pavement is of white mosaic. On the  right side of this vestibule, near the niche, begins an inclined spiral  way, 30 feet high and 11 feet wide, leading up to the central chamber,  which is in the form of a Greek cross.    There is no doubt that the tomb was adorned with statues. Procopius  distinctly says that, during the siege laid by the Goths to the castle  in 537, many of them were hurled down from the battlements upon the  assailants. On the strength of this passage topographers have been in  the habit of attributing to the mausoleum all the works of statuary  discovered in the neighborhood; like the Barberini Faun now in Munich,  the exquisite statue of a River God described by Cassiano dal Pozzo,  etc., as if such subjects were becoming a house of death. The mausoleum  of Hadrian formed part of one of the largest and noblest cemeteries of  ancient Rome, crossed by the Via Triumphalis. The tomb next in  importance to it was the so-called \"Meta,\" or \"sepulcrum Romuli,\" or  \"sepulcrum Neronis,\" a pyramid of great size, which stood on the site of  the church of St. Maria Transpontina, and was destroyed by Alexander VI.  in 1499.          TRAJAN'S FORUM[13]    BY FRANCIS WEY      In the midst of the busy quarters lying at the base of the Quirinal, you  come out upon a great piazza which you name at once without ever having  seen it before; Trajan's Column serves as ensign for a forum, of which  Apollodorus of Damascus erected the porticoes. The lines described by  the bases of a plantation of pillars will help you to identify the  pesimeter of the temple which Hadrian consecrated, and the site of the  Ulpian Library which was divided into two chambers--one for Greek books,  and the other for Latin; and finally the situation of the basilica,  opening on to the forum and with its apse in the north-northwest  direction....    It was in the Ulpian Basilica that, in 312, Constantine, having  assembled the notables of the empire seated himself in the presbyterium,  to proclaim his abjuration of polytheism in favor of the religion of  Christ; on that day and spot the prince closed the cycle of antiquity,  opened the catacombs, and inaugurated the modern world. The Acts of St.  Sylvester describe many passages of the discourse in which, \"invoking  truth against mischievous divisions,\" and declaring that he \"put away  superstitions born of ignorance and reared on unreason,\" the emperor  ordains that \"churches be opened to Christians, and that the priests of  the temples and those of Christ enjoy the same privileges.\" He himself  undertakes to build a church in his Lateran palace.    I do not think there exists any monument in the world more precious or  more exquisite in its proportions than Trajan's Column, nor one that has  rendered more capital service. This has been set forth with more  authority than I can pretend to, by Viollet-le-Duc, the architect who  has written best on his own art; his description sums up the subject and  makes everything clear. A set of pictures of the campaigns of Trajan  against the Decians--the bas-reliefs--reproduces the arms, the  accouterments, the engines of war, the dwellings of the barbarians; we  discern the breed of the warriors and their horses; we look upon the  ships of the time, canoes and quinqueremes; women of all ranks, priests  of all theogonies, sieges, and assaults. Such are the merits of this  sculptured host, that Polidoro da Caravaggio, Giulio Romano, Michael  Angelo, and all the artists of the Renaissance have drawn thence models  of style and picturesque grouping.    Trajan's Column is of pure Carrara marble. The shaft measures about  ninety-four English feet, by twelve in diameter at the base, and ten  below the capital, which is Doric and carved out of a single block; the  column is composed of thirty-four blocks, hollowed out internally and  cut into a winding stair. A series of bas-reliefs, divided from one  another by a narrow band, run spirally around the shaft parallel to the  inner staircase of a hundred and eighty-two steps, and describes  twenty-three circuits to reach the platform on which the statue is  placed. The foot and the pedestal are seventeen feet high; the torus, of  enormous diameter, is a monolith; the whole construction rises a hundred  and thirty-five feet from the ground. These thirty-four blocks,  measuring eleven meters in circumference by one in height, had--a task  of considerable precision--to have holes drilled in them for the screws  of the staircase, it being necessary to determine from the inside  precisely where these borings must be made in order not to break the  continuity of the bas-reliefs, executed by several different hands, and  which are more deeply worked in proportion as they gain in height, so as  to appear of an equal projection.          THE BATHS OF CARACALLA[14]    BY HIPPOLYTE ADOLPHE TAINE      You reach the Baths of Caracalla, the most imposing object after the  Coliseum that one sees in Rome. These colossal structures are so many  signs of their times. Imperial Rome plundered the entire Mediterranean  basin, Spain, Gaul, and two-thirds of England, for the benefit of a  hundred thousand idlers. She amused them in the Coliseum with massacres  of beasts and of men; in the Circus Maximus with combats of athletes and  with chariot races; in the theater of Marcellus with pantomimes, plays,  and the pageantry of arms and costume; she provided them with baths, to  which they resorted to gossip, to contemplate statues, to listen to  declaimers, to keep themselves cool in the heats of summer. All that had  been invented of the convenient, agreeable, and beautiful, all that  could be collected in the world that was curious and magnificent, was  for them; the Caesars fed them and diverted them, seeking only to afford  them gratification, and to obtain their acclamations.    A Roman of the middle classes might well regard his emperors as so many  public purveyors, administering his property, relieving him from  troublesome cares, furnishing him at fair rates, or for nothing, with  corn, wine, and oil, giving him sumptuous meals and well-got-up fetes,  providing him with pictures, statues, pantomimists, gladiators, and  lions, resuscitating his \"blase\" taste every morning with some  surprising novelty, and even occasionally converting themselves into  actors, charioteers, singers, and gladiators for his especial"]]]
