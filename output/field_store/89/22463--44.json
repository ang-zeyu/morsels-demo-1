Some idea of the massiveness of the structures may be gathered when it  is known that each group of the clustered pillars separating the bays  covers an area of two hundred and twenty-five square feet at its base,  while those of the cylindrical columns of the sub-bays are twelve feet  square, and the columns themselves have a circumference of over  twenty-three feet. There is little room to doubt that the effect  obtained by the old builders of Durham was intentional. The masterly way  in which great masses of solid masonry, greater than was constructively  necessary, are handled, and the reticence and delicacy of the ornament  combine to prove this. There is in the whole scheme a delightful union  of great power and vigour in the masses, and of tenderness and loving  care in the detail.    The #Choir# is the earliest part of the church. Its two western bays  show Carileph's work, but the eastern piers have been considerably  altered owing to the addition at a later period of the eastern transept,  when Carileph's apses were taken down. This bay contains some very rich  and beautiful detail. The piers on either side of the choir are  decorated with arcades, the lower stage having six arches, and the upper  three, all richly carved with foliage in the caps and hood moulds, and  with heads and half figures. There is also a square aumbry on each pier.  Above the upper arcade, which breaks through the level of the triforium  string course, which is also carried round it, there is on each pier a  figure of an angel beneath a canopy. These are the only two figures  remaining of many which formerly added to the beauty of the interior of  the church. The vaulting of the choir is thirteenth-century work,  quadripartite, the ribs decorated with dog-tooth ornament and square  leaves, and has fine bosses at the intersections of the diagonal ribs.  The choir of Durham is especially interesting to the student of  architecture, showing as it does the Early Norman work of Carileph,  combined with the Early English and Early Decorated work of the newer  eastern portion.    On the south side of the choir stands the monument of Bishop Hatfield,  who directed the see of Durham from 1345 until 1381. This monument is  beneath the Episcopal Throne, which was erected by Bishop Hatfield  himself. It consists of an altar tomb surmounted by a recumbent effigy  of the bishop, in richly-worked robes, beneath a canopy, richly groined,  with foliated bosses at the intersections of the ribs. On the walls at  the east and west ends may still be seen the remains of fresco painting,  representing in each case two angels. Beneath the staircase leading up  to the throne is a very fine decorated arcade, containing several  shields bearing the bishop's and other arms. The whole structure was  originally richly coloured and gilded, and remains of this work can  still be made out. It is a noble specimen of the work of its date.    Immediately opposite the tomb of Bishop Hatfield, on the north side of  the choir, the visitor will notice the recently-erected memorial to the  late Bishop Lightfoot. This is an altar tomb of black and coloured  marble. The sides are ornamented with panels of Perpendicular tracery  containing shields. Round the upper mouldings runs a Latin inscription  in brass. The whole is surmounted by a recumbent figure of the bishop in  white marble, his hands on his breast, and his feet resting against  three books. Originally designed by Sir Edgar Boehm, R.A., at his death  the monument was completed by Alfred Gilbert, R.A.    The beautiful altar screen is usually known as the #Neville Screen,#  and was erected about the year 1380, mainly from moneys supplied by  John, Lord Neville of Raby. It spans the whole of the choir, and is  continued along the sides of the sacrarium, forming sedilia of four  seats on either side. It is pierced by two doors, which lead to the  shrine of S. Cuthbert, immediately behind the screen. Though very light  and graceful in appearance, the screen, as it is at present, can give  the beholder little idea of what its appearance must have been when  each of its canopied niches contained a figure aglow with gold and  colour. There were originally 107 of these statues, the centre one  representing Our Lady, supported on either side by S. Cuthbert and S.  Oswald. Unfortunately none of the figures remain _in situ_.    Immediately in front of the steps of the high altar will be seen the  matrix of a large brass. It covers the grave of Ludovick de Bellomonte,  Bishop of Durham from 1318 to 1333. The slab, which is in two pieces,  measures fifteen feet ten inches by nine feet seven inches, and an  examination will show the brass to have been an elaborate and sumptuous  composition. Unfortunately all the metal work has disappeared.    The #Stalls,# as they originally existed, were destroyed in 1650 by  the Scottish prisoners, who were kept in the cathedral after the battle  of Dunbar. The present stalls we owe to Bishop Cosin (1660 to 1672), and  they are remarkable pieces of carving for that date. In general  character they imitate Perpendicular work, though the details do not  adhere altogether to that style.    Before leaving this part of the church a note may be devoted to the  alterations and additions made during the years 1870 to 1876. A new  screen between the nave and choir was then erected; the choir floor  relaid with marble mosaic; the stalls replaced in their old positions,  and new portions made to replace those destroyed in 1846. A new organ,  pulpit, and lectern were also added.    The new #Choir Screen# is very much open to criticism. Though no  doubt beautiful in detail, and of excellent workmanship, its effect, as  a whole, is not pleasant, when seen from the west end silhouetted  against the light of the choir. A screen previously existed in this  position erected by Bishop Cosin. This was removed in 1846, with the  idea of improving the appearance of the church from the west end by  obtaining a \"vista\" through to the Neville screen and rose window of the  eastern transept. The effect seems, however, to have been disappointing,  hence the erection of the present screen, which may or may not have  improved matters. In the two western piers of the choir holes may be  seen cut in the stonework. These received the rood-beam from which,  during Lent, the Lenten curtain was suspended.    [Illustration: The Choir, looking West.]    The #North Aisle of the Choir,# again, shows the joining and  harmonising of the \"new work\" of the eastern transept with the earlier  Norman work. Inside the church the most easterly bay appears to be  altogether of Early English date; but on the exterior it will be seen  that the Norman wall runs right up to the western wall of the eastern  transept. The interior of the bay, however, is enriched with a wall  arcade similar to that in the Nine Altars Chapel, and the arch and vault  are decorated with foliage and dog-tooth ornament.    Along the side wall of this aisle runs a stone bench bearing the arms of  Bishop Walter de Skirlaw (1388 to 1405), near which he was buried, but  his monument and brass, erected by himself, have disappeared.    Slightly westward of the bench is a doorway which at one time opened  into the Sacrist's Exchequer, erected by Prior Wessington, but it has  long ago been destroyed.    The piers of the west end of this aisle bear marks which were originally  holes cut in the stone. These served to support a porch, having a rood  and altar, which is thus described in the \"Rites of Durham\":        \"Right over the Entrance of this North Alleye, going to the Songe      Scoole (the Exchequer mentioned above) there was a porch adjoyninge      to the quire on the South, and S. Benedick's altar on the North, the      porch having in it an altar, and the roode or picture of our      Saviour, which altar and roode was much frequented in devotion by      Docteur Swalwell, sometime monk of Durham, the said roode havinge      marveilous sumptuous furniture for festivall dayes belonginge to      it.\"    The #South Aisle Of the Choir# is similar architecturally to the  north aisle. Here may be seen a doorway, of late thirteenth-century  work, which originally led to the revestry, now destroyed.    Here again the eastern piers bear marks left by holes in the stonework,  which originally earned the supports of a screen, in front of which the  Black Rood of Scotland, which was taken from King David at the battle of  Neville's Cross (1346), was placed. The rood is described as having been  brought from Holyrood by David Bruce, and was made of silver, with  effigies of our Saviour, S. John, and Our Lady, having crowns of gold on  their heads. The Black Rood was restored to its original possessors at  the close of the war.    The windows of both the choir aisles originally contained very fine old  stained glass, representing various saints, and scenes in the life of S.  Cuthbert.    The #Transepts.#--Leaving the choir by its western end the visitor at  once enters the transepts. A large portion of these, including the great  piers and arches which carry the central tower, are, without doubt, of  the time of Carileph. The eastern side of both is certainly his work,  while the western is probably the building which was carried on by the  monks in the interval between Carileph's death, in 1096, and the  appointment of Flambard to the see in 1099. The work on the eastern  sides differs little from that of the choir, while that of the western  sides, being plainer, has been thought by some to indicate a want of  means on the part of the monks, while carrying on the work in the  interval just alluded to. Each transept consists of two bays, with an  aisle on the eastern side, access to which is gained by the ascent of  three steps.    Each of the three sub-bays nearest the north and south extremities  originally contained an altar, those in the north transept being"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20194"],[0,"The Petticoat Commando: Boer Women in Secret Service (#7)"],[1,"sis, merciful Providence numbs our  keenest sensibilities and the brain acts and thinks mechanically. The  inevitable comes, however, and we wonder at finding ourselves still  breathing, after passing through that fire of mental agony.    Our young patriot's heart was torn and bleeding, but her sufferings  then were as nothing compared to those she endured in later months and  years, when the incidents of that winter's day would pass in review  across her brain, haunting her sleeping and waking thoughts like some  hideous nightmare.    It is not for me to describe the scene: the cheering of the multitude,  the parade of haggard troops--the soul-sickening display of imperial  patriotism.    As if ashamed of having witnessed it, the sun, suddenly grown old and  grey, hid himself behind a passing cloud, and in the shadows which  enveloped her the girl seemed to feel the hand of Nature, groping for  hers, to convey its silent message of sympathy.    The crowds dispersed and the troops withdrew to the outskirts of the  town to pitch their tents for the night.    When Hansie arrived at Harmony she found all the open space around it  occupied by troops, and camps erected at the very gates, while, all  along the roads and railway lines, fires were burning and soldiers  were engaged in tending their horses and preparing their rations.    The air was so heavy with smoke and dust that it seemed as if a dense  fog were resting on the town, but an order and discipline prevailed  which could not be surpassed.    Mrs. van Warmelo was standing at the gate with a loaded revolver in  her hands, keeping the entire British army at bay with a pair of  blazing eyes.    She had already spoken to the officer in command, who, on hearing that  two unprotected ladies were living alone on the property, had  immediately issued orders that no man was to enter Harmony on any  pretext whatever. Somewhat reassured, mother and daughter retired into  their stronghold, barricading doors and windows and ordering Carlo,  the good watch-dog, to preserve an extra vigilance that night.    Brave old Carlo! from that moment he seemed to understand that his  duty was to protect his beloved mistresses from their mortal foe, and  nothing could equal his dislike and distrust of anything connected  with the unwelcome visitors around his hitherto peaceful abode. For a  long time, he valiantly withstood temptation in the form of titbits  offered him by soldiers, not at any time responding to the many  advances made by them, and my reader will agree with me, as this story  unfolds itself, that no dog could have developed more useful  qualities.    The first few weeks after the occupation of Pretoria were spent in  settling down and finding accommodation for the thousands of British  officers and men, and it soon became evident to the inhabitants of  Harmony that Sunnyside had been chosen as a suitable suburb for the  more important members of the military forces.    To give the reader some idea of how Harmony was hemmed in by troops on  every side, I have drawn the annexed chart, and, though some  alterations were made as the months went by, this was practically the  position of our heroines during the greater part of the war.    On the eastern side were encamped the Military Mounted Police; on the  west, on the banks of the Aapies River and adjoining the Berea Park,  lay Kitchener's bodyguard; on the south were established the  Montmorency Scouts; and on the north, commanding the principal  entrance to Harmony, the Provost-Marshal, Major Poore, had taken up  his abode in the comfortable residence of the ex-Mayor of Pretoria,  Sir Johannes van Boeschoten, who was knighted on the occasion of the  recent visit to South Africa of the Duke of Connaught.    Opposite the Provost-Marshal, in a house belonging to Mr. B.T. Bourke,  the War Office, as we called it, was established; and still a little  farther north, in the British Agency, vacated by Sir Conyngham and  Lady Lily Greene when martial law was proclaimed, Lord Roberts and  his staff were installed, until better quarters could be found for  them. The Military Governor, General Sir John Maxwell, then took  possession of the British Agency and remained there, as far as I know,  until the end of the war.        [Illustration: (map of Harmony and neighbourhood.)]    During the first half-year after the British entry into Pretoria  Harmony's front gate was blocked by the tent of the military post  office, the ropes of which had been fastened to the posts of the gate.  Although the inhabitants of Harmony found it inconvenient to squeeze  through the small opening at the side of the gate, Mrs. van Warmelo  made no objection to the arrangement, because it safeguarded the  property to some extent from possible intruders.    Other houses in the immediate neighbourhood of Harmony were occupied  at different times by Lord Kitchener of Khartoum, the Duke of  Westminster, and many other distinguished personages, with their  staffs. From this it will readily be understood that in the whole of  Pretoria no spot could have been more completely hemmed in by the  vigilant military than Harmony.    How this vigilance was evaded by two Boer women, and how Harmony  became the centre of Boer espionage as time went on, will be the theme  of this story; but I wish my reader clearly to understand that from  beginning to end there was no treachery, no broken promises of peace  and good behaviour.    It was simply taken for granted that the two women in question were  hopelessly cut off from all communication with their friends in the  field, and utterly helpless and incapable of assisting their  fellow-countrymen.    There were no conditions attached to the privilege of remaining  undisturbed in their home, and, though it was well known that their  menfolk were among the fighting burghers and that they themselves  entertained the strongest feelings of antagonism towards the British,  they were quietly left in peace.    Whether the fact that Mrs. van Warmelo's elder daughter was married to  Mr. Henry Cloete, of Alphen, Wynberg, had anything to do with this  unexpected and altogether undeserved leniency, I do not know. It  certainly could not be put down to the credit of our heroines that Mr.  Cloete had at one time been Acting British Agent at Pretoria, nor that  he had shown the British Government such services as earned for him  the distinction of having the Order of Companion of St. Michael and  St. George conferred upon him.    All I can say is that if the van Warmelos owed their security to these  facts, we can only look upon that as one of the fortunate  circumstances of war over which we had no control. Other Boer  residents in Pretoria fared less fortunately.    A great many \"undesirable\" families were put over the border at once;  and of the remaining burghers, some took the oath of allegiance for  purposes of their own, on which I am not in a position to pass  judgment, others, the greater majority, took the oath of neutrality,  and a few, in some mysterious way or other, avoided both these oaths,  and remained in the capital, without pass, without permit, until time  and occasion presented themselves for a sudden and unaccountable  disappearance. In another chapter I shall endeavour to describe the  dangers and difficulties under which one of these men escaped from  British martial law to the free life of the Boer commandos.    Although houses were \"commandeered\" right and left, and officers  quartered on private families, as is the custom in every  well-conducted war, Harmony was left in peace, only one mild attempt  being made a few days after the occupation of Pretoria, by the officer  in command of the Montmorency Scouts, to obtain entrance for himself  and fellow officers at Harmony's inhospitable door.    \"Only three officers,\" he said--\"no men; and we shall give no  trouble.\"    It was Hansie's duty to refuse, and refuse she did, firmly, patiently,  without betraying her inmost fear that he could, and probably  would--like the American darkie preacher, who announced to his flock  that a certain meeting would take place \"on Friday next, de Lord  willin', an' if not, den on Sat'dy, whedder or no\"--take possession of  her home, \"whedder or no\" she gave her consent.    It is still a source of surprise that he did not, that, instead, he  descended to argument, to beseechings.    \"Our tents are bitterly cold at night,\" he said at last. \"Let us at  least sleep in the house.\"    \"My brothers in the field have no tents,\" Hansie answered, \"they sleep  under the open sky. Do you think that we are going to allow British  officers to sleep in their beds? Allow me to tell you that we are  red-hot Republicans.\"    He departed, and, though Mrs. van Warmelo and Hansie lived in some  trepidation for the next few days, no second attempt was made to  commandeer Harmony.    The incident of the large number of side-saddles found in the British  camp at Dundee had given Hansie food for much thought, and had caused  her to plan her own future line of action long before the British  officers entered Pretoria.    \"They will want to enjoy themselves with our girls,\" she told her  mother.    \"They will be found at tennis-parties, at social evenings, and at  concerts. They will want us to go out riding and driving with them,  but, mother, I vow I shall never be seen with a khaki officer as long  as our men are in the field.\" And, as far as she was able, she kept  her word until the war was over.    This was not always easy, for many temptations were brought in her  way, and she soon found it necessary to give up riding and tennis  altogether in order to keep to her resolution.          CHAPTER V    ONLY A BIT OF RIBBON GAY!      The conspicuously bright hues of the \"Vierkleur\" round Hansie's hat  attracted the attention of the new-comers in Pretoria, and she was  often asked what they represented.
