To calm him, he  clung to the conviction that the issue could not really be very serious.  If the obligations of Philippe's honour compelled him to cross swords  with the man he had struck, M. de La Tour d'Azyr's birth compelled him  no less to do no serious hurt to the unfledged lad he had so grievously  provoked. M. le Marquis, after all, was a man of honour. He could intend  no more than to administer a lesson; sharp, perhaps, but one by which  his opponent must live to profit. Andre-Louis clung obstinately to that  for comfort.    Steel beat on steel, and the men engaged. The Marquis presented to his  opponent the narrow edge of his upright body, his knees slightly flexed  and converted into living springs, whilst M. de Vilmorin stood squarely,  a full target, his knees wooden. Honour and the spirit of fair play  alike cried out against such a match.    The encounter was very short, of course. In youth, Philippe had received  the tutoring in sword-play that was given to every boy born into his  station of life. And so he knew at least the rudiments of what was  now expected of him. But what could rudiments avail him here? Three  disengages completed the exchanges, and then without any haste the  Marquis slid his right foot along the moist turf, his long, graceful  body extending itself in a lunge that went under M. de Vilmorin's clumsy  guard, and with the utmost deliberation he drove his blade through the  young man's vitals.    Andre-Louis sprang forward just in time to catch his friend's body under  the armpits as it sank. Then, his own legs bending beneath the weight of  it, he went down with his burden until he was kneeling on the damp turf.  Philippe's limp head lay against Andre-Louis' left shoulder; Philippe's  relaxed arms trailed at his sides; the blood welled and bubbled from the  ghastly wound to saturate the poor lad's garments.    With white face and twitching lips, Andre-Louis looked up at M. de La  Tour d'Azyr, who stood surveying his work with a countenance of grave  but remorseless interest.    \"You have killed him!\" cried Andre-Louis.    \"Of course.\"    The Marquis ran a lace handkerchief along his blade to wipe it. As he  let the dainty fabric fall, he explained himself. \"He had, as I told  him, a too dangerous gift of eloquence.\"    And he turned away, leaving completest understanding with Andre-Louis.  Still supporting the limp, draining body, the young man called to him.    \"Come back, you cowardly murderer, and make yourself quite safe by  killing me too!\"    The Marquis half turned, his face dark with anger. Then M. de  Chabrillane set a restraining hand upon his arm. Although a party  throughout to the deed, the Chevalier was a little appalled now that it  was done. He had not the high stomach of M. de La Tour d'Azyr, and he  was a good deal younger.    \"Come away,\" he said. \"The lad is raving. They were friends.\"    \"You heard what he said?\" quoth the Marquis.    \"Nor can he, or you, or any man deny it,\" flung back Andre-Louis.  \"Yourself, monsieur, you made confession when you gave me now the reason  why you killed him. You did it because you feared him.\"    \"If that were true--what, then?\" asked the great gentleman.    \"Do you ask? Do you understand of life and humanity nothing but how to  wear a coat and dress your hair--oh, yes, and to handle weapons against  boys and priests? Have you no mind to think, no soul into which you can  turn its vision? Must you be told that it is a coward's part to kill the  thing he fears, and doubly a coward's part to kill in this way? Had you  stabbed him in the back with a knife, you would have shown the courage  of your vileness. It would have been a vileness undisguised. But you  feared the consequences of that, powerful as you are; and so you shelter  your cowardice under the pretext of a duel.\"    The Marquis shook off his cousin's hand, and took a step forward,  holding now his sword like a whip. But again the Chevalier caught and  held him.    \"No, no, Gervais! Let be, in God's name!\"    \"Let him come, monsieur,\" raved Andre-Louis, his voice thick and  concentrated. \"Let him complete his coward's work on me, and thus make  himself safe from a coward's wages.\"    M. de Chabrillane let his cousin go. He came white to the lips, his eyes  glaring at the lad who so recklessly insulted him. And then he checked.  It may be that he remembered suddenly the relationship in which this  young man was popularly believed to stand to the Seigneur de Gavrillac,  and the well-known affection in which the Seigneur held him. And so he  may have realized that if he pushed this matter further, he might find  himself upon the horns of a dilemma. He would be confronted with the  alternatives of shedding more blood, and so embroiling himself with the  Lord of Gavrillac at a time when that gentleman's friendship was of the  first importance to him, or else of withdrawing with such hurt to his  dignity as must impair his authority in the countryside hereafter.    Be it so or otherwise, the fact remains that he stopped short; then,  with an incoherent ejaculation, between anger and contempt, he tossed  his arms, turned on his heel and strode off quickly with his cousin.    When the landlord and his people came, they found Andre-Louis, his arms  about the body of his dead friend, murmuring passionately into the deaf  ear that rested almost against his lips:    \"Philippe! Speak to me, Philippe! Philippe... Don't you hear me? O God  of Heaven! Philippe!\"    At a glance they saw that here neither priest nor doctor could avail.  The cheek that lay against Andre-Louis's was leaden-hued, the half-open  eyes were glazed, and there was a little froth of blood upon the  vacuously parted lips.    Half blinded by tears Andre-Louis stumbled after them when they bore the  body into the inn. Upstairs in the little room to which they conveyed  it, he knelt by the bed, and holding the dead man's hand in both his  own, he swore to him out of his impotent rage that M. de La Tour d'Azyr  should pay a bitter price for this.    \"It was your eloquence he feared, Philippe,\" he said. \"Then if I can  get no justice for this deed, at least it shall be fruitless to him. The  thing he feared in you, he shall fear in me. He feared that men might be  swayed by your eloquence to the undoing of such things as himself. Men  shall be swayed by it still. For your eloquence and your arguments shall  be my heritage from you. I will make them my own. It matters nothing  that I do not believe in your gospel of freedom. I know it--every word of  it; that is all that matters to our purpose, yours and mine. If all else  fails, your thoughts shall find expression in my living tongue. Thus  at least we shall have frustrated his vile aim to still the voice he  feared. It shall profit him nothing to have your blood upon his soul.  That voice in you would never half so relentlessly have hounded him and  his as it shall in me--if all else fails.\"    It was an exulting thought. It calmed him; it soothed his grief, and he  began very softly to pray. And then his heart trembled as he considered  that Philippe, a man of peace, almost a priest, an apostle of  Christianity, had gone to his Maker with the sin of anger on his soul.  It was horrible. Yet God would see the righteousness of that anger. And  in no case--be man's interpretation of Divinity what it might--could that  one sin outweigh the loving good that Philippe had ever practised, the  noble purity of his great heart. God after all, reflected Andre-Louis,  was not a grand-seigneur.            CHAPTER V. THE LORD OF GAVRILLAC    For the second time that day Andre-Louis set out for the chateau,  walking briskly, and heeding not at all the curious eyes that followed  him through the village, and the whisperings that marked his passage  through the people, all agog by now with that day's event in which he  had been an actor.    He was ushered by Benoit, the elderly body-servant, rather  grandiloquently called the seneschal, into the ground-floor room known  traditionally as the library. It still contained several shelves of  neglected volumes, from which it derived its title, but implements  of the chase--fowling-pieces, powder-horns, hunting-bags,  sheath-knives--obtruded far more prominently than those of study. The  furniture was massive, of oak richly carved, and belonging to another  age. Great massive oak beams crossed the rather lofty whitewashed  ceiling.    Here the squat Seigneur de Gavrillac was restlessly pacing when  Andre-Louis was introduced. He was already informed, as he announced at  once, of what had taken place at the Breton arme. M. de Chabrillane  had just left him, and he confessed himself deeply grieved and deeply  perplexed.    \"The pity of it!\" he said. \"The pity of it!\" He bowed his enormous head.  \"So estimable a young man, and so full of promise. Ah, this La Tour  d'Azyr is a hard man, and he feels very strongly in these matters.  He may be right. I don't know. I have never killed a man for holding  different views from mine. In fact, I have never killed a man at all.  It isn't in my nature. I shouldn't sleep of nights if I did. But men are  differently made.\"    \"The question, monsieur my godfather,\" said Andre-Louis, \"is what is to  be done.\" He was quite calm and self-possessed, but very white.    M. de Kercadiou stared at him blankly out of his pale eyes.    \"Why, what the devil is there to do? From what I am told, Vilmorin went  so far as to strike M. le Marquis.\"    \"Under the very grossest provocation.\"    \"Which he himself provoked by his revolutionary language. The poor  lad's head was full of this encyclopaedist trash. It comes of too much  reading. I have never set much store by books, Andre; and I have never  known anything but trouble to come out of learning. It unsettles a man.  It complicates his views of life, destroys the simplicity which makes  for peace of mind and happiness.

CHAPTER III. - THE INTERIOR OF THE CATHEDRAL.      The Cathedral is usually entered from the north-west through the beautiful  parvise porch of Bishop Booth. The lower stage of this porch is formed by  three arches with octagonal turrets at their outer angles. These turrets  are each capped by a lantern. The second stage has three fine  Perpendicular windows. The doorway, which actually opens into the church,  belongs to a smaller porch within this outer one. The inner porch is of  the Decorated period. There is some particularly good iron-work on the  doors, made by Messrs Potter from designs by Mr. Cottingham, junior.    Hereford has a smaller area than either of the other two sister  cathedrals, being only 26,850 feet in extent.                         [Illustration: THE NORTH PORCH.]                                 THE NORTH PORCH.      The *Nave*, which is separated from the aisles by eight massive Norman  piers (part of the original church), of which the capitals are worthy of  notice, has somewhat suffered by restorations at the hand of Wyatt. The  triforium, the clerestory, the vaulting of the roof and the western wall  and doorway are all his work; and it must not be forgotten that he  shortened the original nave by one entire bay. Walking to the west end,  from which the best general view is to be obtained, one is impressed by  the striking effect of the great Norman piers and arches and the gloom of  the choir beyond. Through the noble circular arches, which support the  central tower and the modern screen on the eastern side of it, we see the  eastern wall of the choir, pierced above by three lancet windows and below  by a wide circular arch receding in many orders. A central pillar divides  this lower arch, two pointed arches springing from its capital and leaving  a spandrel between them, which is covered with modern sculpture. In the  far distance may be distinguished the east wall of the Lady Chapel and its  brilliant lancet lights.    Throughout the Cathedral the Norman work is remarkable for the richness of  its ornament as compared with other buildings of the same date, such as  Peterborough or Ely.    The main arches of the nave are ornamented with the billet and other  beautiful mouldings, and the capitals of both piers and shafts are also  elaborately decorated. The double half shafts set against the north and  south fronts of the huge circular piers are in the greater part  restorations.    Over each pier arch there are two triforium arches imitated from the Early  English of Salisbury. They are divided by slender pillars, but there is no  triforium passage.    During the Late Decorated period the nave-aisles were practically rebuilt,  the existing walls and windows being erected upon the bases of the Norman  walls, which were retained for a few feet above the foundations. The  vaulting of the roofs of the nave-aisles and the roof of the nave itself  were coloured under the direction of Mr. Cottingham.    *The Font*, of late Norman design, probably twelfth century, is in the  second bay of the south aisle beginning from the west.    The circular basin is 32 inches in diameter, large enough for the total  immersion of children. Beneath arches round the basin are figures of the  twelve Apostles. These, however, with one exception, have been much  broken. The most curious feature of this interesting font is the base with  four demi-griffins or lions projecting therefrom. The whole is protected  by a mosaic platform.    *Monuments in the Nave.*--The first monument on the south side as we walk  from the western end is the fine effigy in alabaster of Sir Richard  Pembridge in plate and mail armour with his greyhound. This monument was  formerly at the Black Friars Monastery, but was removed here at the  Suppression. Sir Richard Pembridge was a Knight of the Garter (53rd of  that order) at the time of Edward III., and was present at Poitiers. He  died in 1375. There are still traces of colour on this monument and gold  remains on the points of the cap to which the camail is fastened, as also  on the jewelled sword-belt. A sheaf of green coloured leathers is  separated from the tilting helmet, on which the head rests, by a coronet  of open roses. When the effigy was brought here it had but one leg left,  and that the gartered one. A wooden limb was carved, and the workman  showed such accuracy in duplicating the stone leg that the Knight was  adorned with a pair of garters for many years until Lord Saye and Sele,  Canon Residentiary, presented the Cathedral with a new alabaster leg, and  the wooden one was banished to a shelf in the library.                            [Illustration: THE NAVE.]                                    THE NAVE.    _Photochrom Co., Ld., Photo._      Under a foliated Decorated arch in the wall in the fifth bay is the carved  figure of an unknown ecclesiastic. The effigy is headless and otherwise  much mutilated.    In the sixth bay is another mutilated and headless figure, under a  foliated arch, which is crowned by a bearded head wearing a cap. It is  thought to be the monument of a former treasurer.    In the fifth bay a quaint door leads from the aisle to the Bishop's  Cloister. This has a square heading which rises above the sill of the  window over it. There is an interesting series of heads in the hollow  moulding, which are said to be copies of earlier work in the same  position. The iron-work of the door itself is modern by Potter. A lofty  Norman arch leads from this aisle into the south transept.    The north aisle of the nave is similar in style to the south. It contains  six memorial windows to Canon Clutton and his wife, with subjects by  Warrenton from the life of St. John the Baptist.    In the sixth bay from the west of the north wall of the nave is the effigy  and tomb under which is buried Bishop Booth (1535), the builder of the  large projecting porch which bears his name. The recumbent figure of the  Bishop is fully vested with a _mitra pretiosa_ with pendent fillets. He  wears a cassock, amice, alb, stole, fringed tunic and dalmatic, and  chasuble with orfrays in front. On his feet are broad-toed sandals; his  hands are gloved; a crozier (the head of which has been broken) is veiled  on the right. At this side is a feathered angel. The original inscription,  cut into stone and fixed above the effigy, remains uninjured:          \"Carolus Booth, episcopus Herefordensis cum 18 annos, 5 menses et      totidem dies Ecclesiae huic cum laude prefuisset, quinto die Maii      1535 defunctus sub hoc tumulo sepultus jacet.\"      The iron-work in front of this tomb is the only specimen in the Cathedral  which has not been disturbed, although Mr. Havergal says \"most of our  large ancient monuments were protected by iron railings.\" It is divided  into six square panels, having shields and heraldic ornaments.    The beautiful wrought iron *Screen*, an elaborate example of artistic  metal-work, painted and gilt, executed by Messrs Skidmore of Coventry,  from designs by Sir Gilbert Scott, stands between the eastern piers of the  central tower, a little towards the nave. The first great piece of  metal-work of this kind executed in England in modern times was the choir  screen at Lichfield, designed and carried out by the same artists as the  Hereford screen; though the latter and subsequent production transcends  that of Lichfield, both in craftsmanship and beauty.    It has five main arches, each subdivided into two sub-arches by a slender  shaft. The central arch is larger and higher than the others, is gabled  and surmounted by a richly jewelled cross. This forms the entrance, and on  either side, to a height of 4 feet, the lower part of the arches are  filled with tracery in panels. The spandrels between the heads of the  arches are enriched with elaborate ornament in flowing outline.                        [Illustration: THE CHOIR SCREEN.]                                THE CHOIR SCREEN.    _Photochrom Co., Ld., Photo._      A variety of foliage and flowers has been worked in thin plates of copper  and hammered iron, in imitation of natural specimens, and throughout the  screen the passion flower is prominent in the decoration. It is composed  of 11,200 lbs. of iron, 5000 lbs. of copper and brass, 50,000 pieces of  vitreous and other mineral substances in the mosaic panels, and about 300  cut and polished stones. There are also seven bronze figures, three single  figures, and two groups. Of these the _Times_, May 29, 1862, well said:  \"These figures are perfect studies in themselves. Every one can understand  them at a glance, and from the centre figure of Our Saviour to those of  the praying Angels, the fulness of their meaning may be felt without the  aid of any inscriptions beneath the feet to set forth who or what they  are.\"               [Illustration: SECTION THROUGH TOWER AND TRANSEPTS.]                       SECTION THROUGH TOWER AND TRANSEPTS.      The eastern side of the screen, though without statuary, is no less worthy  of inspection. Over the gates the large oval space is filled with the  sacred monogram I.H.C. The base consists of polished Devonshire marble.  The diversity of tint of the metals used is in itself a source of colour,  but the whole of the hammered iron-work of the foliage has been painted  with oxides of iron and copper, while the colour scheme is further carried  out in the mosaics.    The whole effect is certainly beautiful, and the screen is perhaps the  best example of this kind of work produced in modern times. The cost of  the screen was L3000, though"]]]
