Below the east window of the  Lady Chapel, between the two great buttresses with mutilated canopies on  the two lower of their three divisions, there is some blank panelling,  consisting of four shallow-arched recesses with a pilaster down the  centre, each arch uniting two minor ones with cinquefoil cusps at the  head and crowned by a quatrefoil with a rosette in the middle. There  were originally four heads at the ends of the corbels under these  quatrefoils, but the southernmost is broken away. A similar arcade runs  along the southern wall of the Lady Chapel, but there is none on the  north side. The two main corbel-tables at the east end show the arms of  England and France and the bishop's device of three \"torteaux.\" Under  these, at a short distance from the ground, are two smaller windows,  which give light to the Lady Chapel crypt. The panelling dates from  about 1490, and is due to Bishop Peter Courtenay.    [Illustration: NAVE, SHOWING THE SCREEN BEFORE RESTORATION.  _A. Pumphrey, Photo._]          CHAPTER III    THE INTERIOR      The very first glimpse of the nave, as one enters by the west door,  reveals the superb proportions of the interior. In spite of all  statistics of its size, the outward appearance of the building hardly  impresses the spectator with the fact that Winchester is the largest  cathedral in Northern Europe, and it is not until one is within the  walls that the great length of the cathedral begins to become real and  its majesty is properly appreciated. The total span, from end to end, of  556 feet, compared with the 537 feet of Ely, the 525 of York, the 524 of  Lincoln, and the 516 of Canterbury, would not alone produce the effect  of almost infinite vastness, and is certainly not realised either in a  distant prospect from the hills or in a nearer view from the cathedral  precincts. But when once the nave is entered, owing partly to the open  and comparatively low choir-screen, the magnificent vault of nearly 400  feet may easily be understood to have few rivals in the world. Certainly  neither of the two buildings in England which are practically equal in  size to Winchester Cathedral give the peculiarly overwhelming sense of  length produced here. The old epithet of \"Royal\" may be said to apply as  fitly to the cathedral as to the town, and it certainly is a worthy  shelter for the bones of half-forgotten dynasties, and as fine a  monument of an earlier England as Westminster is of later periods in the  development of the country.    Of course, as in all English cathedrals, a lack of colour and a sense of  coldness and emptiness modifies any unqualified admiration which one  might at first feel. But Winchester could well afford to admit far more  than the most captious critic could utter against it, and yet claim to  be the most stately nave that England can show. Despite the late  recasting, the proportions are Norman, and the very core of the pillars  is still the original Norman stonework. Notwithstanding the changes  wrought by Edingdon and Wykeham, all the more petty detail of the  Decorated period is lavished on a colossal structure planned with the  simple magnificence of those that \"builded better than they knew.\"    Perhaps it is not quite fair to the later architects to attribute all  the excellence of the work to the earlier builders, for the graceful  columns of the nave's eleven bays which rise unbroken to where the  roof-groining springs from their capitals are made by Wykeham to fulfil  a new duty which entirely alters their whole aspect. The general effect  has been said to be as if a Norman architect had expressed himself in  the more refined idiom of the early fifteenth century. Yet the work of  Edingdon and Wykeham was ruthless in its way. The original Norman nave  of Walkelin consisted of the normal three storeys, of equal height in  this case--the main arches, triforium, and clerestory. At the present  day the main arches are fully half as high again as they were in the  Norman cathedral, while the base of the clerestory has been brought down  to meet them, so that the triforium appears to have vanished or rather  to exist merely as a balcony over each arch. As a matter of fact,  however, it was the old clerestory which was entirely removed and  replaced by the present upper storey. On p. 35 we see on the one hand  typical Norman work, of the character still existing at Romsey Abbey and  Christchurch Priory--to mention only the two large churches nearest to  Winchester. During the conversion of the nave the bases and capitals of  the grouped shafts of the main arches were removed, together with all  the masonry above them. This is not mere conjecture, for the Norman  shafts and capitals which still remain on the north side of the nave, in  the second bay from the crossing, where they were covered by the ancient  rood-screen, show that the pier-arches of the nave sprang from the same  height as those of the transepts; the Norman main arch of the triforium  still exists in every compartment over the vault of the side aisles to  prove that the triforium of the nave was practically on the same level  as that of the transepts, and the tops of the Norman shafts yet  remaining above the nave-vaulting are additional evidence that the nave  was to all intents and purposes uniform with the transepts in its  general arrangement. In the south aisle, moreover, there is to be seen  the lower extremity of a Norman shaft, once covered by some votive altar  or shrine which was removed during the destructive period of the  Reformation. \"It may be readily noted,\" says the writer of a recent  article on Winchester Cathedral, \"how the new ashlar was brought down to  the level of this vanished altar, and how Wykeham's vaulting-shaft has  been made to end in foliation where it once rose in receipt of prayers  and wax-candles vowed in return for mercies vouchsafed.\" In the seven  westerly piers of the south aisle, the Norman stonework has merely  received new mouldings; while flat Norman buttresses can be seen outside  between the clerestory windows, also on the south side.    [Illustration: ELEVATION OF TWO BAYS OF THE NAVE,  SHOWING ITS TRANSFORMATION.  From Willis's \"Architectural History of Winchester Cathedral,\" 1846.]    On the division into two, in place of the usual three, storeys, it may,  perhaps, be of interest to quote some remarks of Willis in the  \"Proceedings of the Archaeological Institute.\" \"The compartment of  Wykeham's nave,\" he says, \"is divided into two parts vertically instead  of three; for although it has a triforium gallery, yet this is so  completely subordinated to the clerestory window that it cannot be held  as a separate division of the composition, as in the Norman work where  the triforium compartment is of all importance and similar in decoration  to the other two, although not exactly like them. In Wykeham's work, on  the contrary, we find above the lofty pier-arch what at first sight  appears to be a clerestory window divided at mid-height by a transom,  and recessed under a deeply-pointed archway. But it is above the transom  only that the real window is formed by glazing the spaces between the  monials. Below the transom these spaces are filled with panels, and two  narrow openings cut through the latter give access from the roof to a  kind of balcony which projects over the pier-arches. In each compartment  this balcony exists, but there is no free passage from one to the other.  This mode of uniting the triforium and clerestory by the employment of a  transom dividing the stone panels of the former from the glazed lights  of the latter is common enough at the period of Wykeham's work and  before it, but the balcony is unusual.\"    It is needless to add any further explanation, since the diagram fully  explains both the present state of the nave and the manner in which the  transformation from the original Norman design was brought about; but it  may be worth while to quote an architect's verdict on the general effect  of Wykeham's work in the nave. \"If we cannot admire all the details,\"  says this writer, \"we can but bear tribute to the conception of the  whole. Its lofty arcades give no space for triforium, and the proportion  between the clerestory and the arcade is somewhat unsatisfactory. If we  except the vaulted roof, and the chantry of the great Wykeham himself,  and his predecessor Edingdon, this portion of the church may, with  reason, be considered simple in its character, and bears distinct  evidence of having been grafted on earlier work. The Norman columns  still remain in one or two places towards the east end of the nave  arcade, but with the exception of these and of the Norman masonry  existing in the piers on the south, and perhaps portions of the aisle  walls, all is transformed to Perpendicular detail\" (_The Builder_,  October 1892).    [Illustration: THE NAVE, LOOKING EAST. _S.B. Bolas & Co., Photo._]    Altogether there are, between the western doors and the piers supporting  the tower, twelve arches on each side, one of each series being included  in the choir. Hooks and brackets may be seen in the face of the piers at  about three-quarters of their height; these were formerly used for the  suspension of arras on occasions of great festivity.    It has been practically established that the sculpture at least of the  nave and its vault was not finished for nearly half-a-century after  Wykeham's death. We find Cardinal Beaufort's arms and bust, and his  device, a white hart chained, as well as Waynflete's lily, intermingled  with the arms and bust of Wykeham. Under the triforium gallery is a  cornice, in each compartment of which are to be found seven large  sculptured bosses, representing a cardinal's hat, a lily, roses, etc. Of  the compartments of the clerestory in the nave we have said that they  have the appearance"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20348"],[0,"The Moving Picture Girls in War Plays (#7)"],[1,"doesn't think so,\" said the manager dryly. \"I don't know  what to do about it, for I have no place where I can put her up alone.\"    \"Bring her here!\" exclaimed Alice, impulsively.    \"Indeed, no!\" cried Miss Pennington. \"We actresses were told that none  of the extra people would be quartered with us! If that had not been  agreed to I would not have come to this place.\"    \"Nor I!\" chimed in Miss Dixon. \"We professionals are not to be classed  with these extras--and amateurs at that!\"    \"I know I did promise you regulars that you would be boarded by  yourselves,\" said Mr. Pertell, scratching his head in perplexity, \"and I  don't blame you for not wanting, as a general run, to mix with the  others. For some of them, while they are decent enough, have a big idea  of their own importance. I wouldn't think of asking you to let one of  the extra men come here, but this young lady----\"    \"She is perfectly charming!\" broke in Alice. \"And she certainly can  ride!\"    \"She did seem very nice,\" murmured Ruth.    \"Pooh! A vulgar cowgirl!\" sneered Miss Dixon.    \"There is a nice room near mine,\" went on Alice. \"She could have that, I  should think. The Apgars don't use it, and it is certainly annoying to  be pestered by a young man!\" and she looked with uptilted nose at Paul,  who said emphatically:    \"Well, I like that!\"    \"If I could bring her here----\" began Mr. Pertell.    \"By all means!\" exclaimed Ruth. \"We will try to make her happy and  comfortable--if she is an amateur.\"    \"She has no right to come here!\" burst out Miss Dixon.    \"No, indeed!\" added Miss Pennington. \"If she comes, I shall go! I will  not board in the same place with an amateur cowgirl doing an extra turn  in the pictures.\"    \"Nor I!\" snapped Miss Dixon.    \"All right--all right!\" said Mr. Pertell quickly. \"I know it's contrary  to my promise, and I won't insist on it. Only it would have made it  easier----\"    \"Let Miss Brown come,\" quickly whispered Alice in the director's ear.  \"They won't leave. They're too comfortable here, and they get too good  salaries. Let Miss Brown come!\"    \"Will you stand by me if I do?\"    \"Yes,\" said Alice.    \"So will I,\" added Ruth.    Then the supper bell rang and the discussion ended for the time being.  Later Mr. Pertell explained privately to Ruth and her sister that Miss  Brown was a quiet and refined young lady about whom he knew little save  that she had answered his advertisement for an amateur who could ride.  She had made good and he had engaged her for the war scenes.    \"But she tells me that among the young men in the same boarding bungalow  is one who seems quite smitten with her. He is impudent and exceedingly  persistent, and she does not desire his attentions. She said she thought  she would have to leave unless she could get a quiet place where he  could not follow. It is all right during the day, as he can not come  near her, but after hours----\"    \"Do bring her!\" urged Alice. \"We'll try to make her comfortable. And  don't fear what they will do,\" and she nodded toward the two other  actresses, who had been in vaudeville before going into motion pictures.    So it was that, later in the evening, Miss Brown brought her trunk to  the Apgar farmhouse and was installed in a room near Alice and Ruth.    \"Oh, it is _so_ much nicer here!\" sighed Estelle Brown, as she admitted  Ruth and Alice, who knocked on her door. \"I could not have stood the  other place much longer. Though every one--except that one man--was very  nice to me.\"    \"Let us be your friends!\" urged Alice.    \"You are very kind,\" murmured Estelle, and the more the two girls looked  at her, the prettier they thought her. She had wonderful hair, a  marvelous complexion, and white, even teeth that made her smile a  delight.    \"Have you been in this business long?\" asked Ruth.    \"No, not very--in fact, this is my first big play. I have done little  ones, but I did not get on very well. I love the work, though.\"    \"Were your people in the profession?\" asked Alice.    \"I don't know--that is, I'm not sure. I believe some of them were,  generations back. Oh, did you hear that?\" and she interrupted her reply  with the question.    \"That\" was the voice of some one in the lower hall inquiring if Miss  Brown was in.    \"It's that--that impertinent Maurice Whitlow!\" whispered Estelle to Ruth  and Alice. \"I thought I could escape him here. Oh, what shall I do?\"    \"I'll say you are not at home,\" returned Ruth, in her best \"stage  society\" manner, and, sweeping down the hall, she met the maid who was  coming up to tell Miss Brown there was a caller for her below.    \"Tell him Miss Brown is not at home,\" said Ruth.    \"Very well,\" and the maid smiled understandingly.    \"Ah! not at home? Tell her I shall call again,\" came in drawling tones  up the stairway, for it was warm, and doors and windows were open.    \"Little--snip!\" murmured Estelle. \"I'm so glad I didn't have to see him.  He's a pest--all the while wanting to take me out and buy ice-cream  sodas. He's just starting in at the movies, and he thinks he's a star  already. Oh! but don't you just love the guns and horses?\" she asked  impulsively.    \"Well, I can't say that I do,\" answered Ruth. \"I like quieter plays.\"    \"I don't!\" cried Alice. \"The more excitement the better I like it. I can  do my best then.\"    \"So can I,\" said Estelle. Then they fell to talking of the work, and of  many other topics.    \"Did Estelle Brown strike you as being peculiar?\" asked Ruth of her  sister when they were back in their rooms, getting ready for bed.    \"Peculiar? What do you mean?\"    \"I mean she didn't seem to know whether or not her people were in the  profession.\"    \"Yes, she did side-step that a bit.\"    \"Side-step, Alice?\"    \"Well, avoid answering, if you like that better. But my way is shorter.  Say, maybe she has gone into this without her people knowing it, and she  wants to keep them from bringing her back.\"    \"Maybe, though it didn't strike me as being that way. It was as though  she wasn't quite sure of herself.\"    \"Sure of herself--what do you mean?\"    \"Well, I can't explain it any better.\"    \"I'll think it over,\" said Alice, sleepily. \"We've got lots to do  to-morrow,\" and she tumbled into bed with a drowsy \"good-night.\"    Miss Laura Dixon and Miss Pearl Pennington most decidedly turned up  their noses at the breakfast table when they saw Estelle sitting between  Ruth and Alice. And their murmurs of disdain could be plainly heard.    \"She here? Then I'm going to leave!\"    \"The idea of amateurs butting in like this! It's a shame!\"    Fortunately Estelle was exchanging some gay banter with Paul and did not  hear. But Ruth and Alice did, and the latter could not avoid a thrust at  the scornful ones. To Ruth, in an unnecessarily loud voice, Alice  remarked:    \"Do you remember that funny vaudeville stunt we used to laugh over when  we were children--'The Lady Bookseller?'\"    \"Yes, I remember it very well,\" answered Ruth. \"What about it, Alice?\"  for she did not catch her sister's drift.    \"Why, I was just wondering how many years ago it was--ten, at least,  since it was popular, isn't it?\"    \"I believe so!\"    \"It's no such a thing!\" came the indignant remonstrance from Miss  Pennington. It was in this sketch that she had made her \"hit,\" and as  she now claimed several years less than the number to which she was  entitled, this sly reference to her age was not relished. \"It was only  _six_ years ago that I starred in that,\" she went on.    \"It seems much longer,\" said Alice, calmly. \"We were quite little when  we saw you in that. You were so funny with your big feet----\"    \"Big feet! I had to wear shoes several sizes too large for me! It was in  the act. I--I----\"    \"They're stringing you--keep still!\" whispered her chum, and with red  cheeks Miss Pennington subsided.    But Alice's remarks had the desired effect, and there were no more  references, for the present, directed at pretty Estelle. Miss Dixon and  Miss Pennington had a scene with Mr. Pertell, though, in which they  threatened to leave unless Estelle were sent back to the bungalow where  the other extra players boarded. But the manager remained firm, and the  two vaudeville actresses did not quit the company.    Hard work followed, and Estelle made some daring rides, once narrowly  escaping injury from the burning wad of a cannon, which went off  prematurely as she dashed past the very muzzle. But she put spurs to her  horse, who leaped over the spurt of fire and smoke. A few feet of film  were spoiled; but this was better than having an actor hurt.    Alice was sitting on the farmhouse porch one afternoon, waiting for  Estelle and Ruth to come down, for they were going for a walk together,  not being needed in the films. Estelle had been taken into companionship  by the two girls, who found her a very charming companion, though little  disposed to talk about herself.    Alice, who was reading a motion picture magazine, was startled by  hearing a voice saying, almost in her ear:    \"Is Miss Brown in?\"    \"Oh!\" and Alice looked up to see Maurice Whitlow smirking at her. He had  tiptoed up on the porch and was standing very close to her. She had  never been introduced to him, but that is not absolutely insisted on in  moving picture circles, particularly when a company is on \"location.\"    \"Is Miss Brown in?\" repeated Whitlow.    \"I don't know, I'm sure,\" replied Alice.    \"Ah, well, I'll wait and find out. I'll sit down here by you and wait,\"  went on the young man, drawing a chair so close to that of Alice that it  touched. \"Fine day, isn't it? I say! you did that bit of acting very  cleverly to-day.\"    \"Did I?\" and Alice went on reading.    \"Yes. I had a little bit myself. I carried a message from the field  headquarters to the rear--after more ammunition, you know. Did you  notice me riding?\"    \"I did not.\"    \"Well, I saw you, all right. If Miss Brown isn't home, do you want to go  over to the village"]]]
