It is incumbent upon you to commemorate and ponder upon the signs of God,  to implore to God and to be evanescent and subservient in the Cause of  God. This is what makes you the signs of guidance among the people, stars  shining in the supreme horizon and thriving trees in the Paradise of  El-Abha.    Then know ye that Abdul-Baha is in cheerfulness and joy and in the  happiness of great glad-tidings through being in this far distant  prison.(8) By the life of El-Baha! --this prison is my supreme paradise, my  utmost desire, the joy of my heart and the dilation of my breast, my  shelter, my asylum, my inaccessible cave and my high protection. By it I  glory among the angels of heaven and the Supreme Concourse.    Be rejoiced, O friends of God, with this confinement which is a cause of  freedom, this prison which is a means of salvation (to many) and this  suffering which is the best cause of great comfort. Verily, by God, I  would not change this prison for the throne of the command of the horizons  and would not exchange this confinement for all excursions and enjoyments  in the gardens of the earth.    Verily, I hope, through the kindness of my Lord and His mercy, bounty and  generosity, to be suspended in the air in His path and that my breast may  become the target to be be pierced by thousands of bullets; or that I may  be cast into the bottomless seas, or thrown into the wilderness and plains  of barrenness. This is my utmost aim, my supreme desire, the animation of  my spirit, the healing of my bosom and the sight of my eyes.    As to you, O friends of God: Make firm your feet in the Cause of God with  such firmness as cannot be shaken by the most great disasters of this  world. Be not troubled by anything under any condition. Be as lofty  mountains, dawning stars from the horizon of existence, brilliant lamps in  the assemblies of oneness and lowly souls, pure hearted, with the friends.    Be signs of guidance; lights of piety; severed from the world, holding  fast to the firm rope; spreaders of the spirit of life; abiders in the ark  of safety; manifestations of mercy; dawning-stars of the mysteries of  existence; points of revelation; day-springs of light; strengthened by the  Holy Spirit; attracted toward God; sanctified from all things and from the  (natural) qualities of people, and characterized with the attributes of  the angels of heaven--so ye may attain to the greatest gift in this great  century and new age.    By the life of El-Abha! No one will obtain this great favor save he who  cuts himself from this world, being attracted by the love of God, who is  dead to the desires and appetites of self, sincere to God in all things  and meek, humble, imploring, pleading and lowly before God.          \"O ye who are firm in the Covenant!...\"      O ye who are firm in the Covenant!    The report of the Spiritual Gathering, which is dated *** and sent by you,  was received and its contents were a source of great fragrance and  spirituality. I was glad to read the names of the revered members.    The signature of that meeting should be the Spiritual Gathering (House of  Spirituality) and the wisdom therein is that hereafter the government  should not infer from the term \"House of Justice\" that a court is  signified, that it is connected with political affairs, or that at any  time it will interfere with governmental affairs.    Hereafter, enemies will be many. They would use this subject as a cause  for disturbing the mind of the government and confusing the thoughts of  the public. The intention was to make known that by the term Spiritual  Gathering (House of Spirituality), that Gathering has not the least  connection with material matters, and that its whole aim and consultation  is confined to matters connected with spiritual affairs. The was also  instructed (performed) in all Persia.***          \"O my God! O my God!...\"      O my God! O my God!    These are servants who have turned to Thy Kingdom and hearkened unto Thy  voice. Their hearts were dilated by Thy call, responded unto Thy summons,  were attracted unto Thy beauty, acknowledged Thy proofs, believed in Thy  signs, confessed Thy Oneness and arose for the service of Thy Cause and  the promotion of Thy Word.    O Lord! O Lord! Make them lamps of guidance, lights glistening in the  supreme apex, sparkling stars in heaven, holy angels moving on earth and  thriving trees bearing delicious and fragrant fruits.    O Lord! O Lord! Purify their qualities, clarify their consciousness,  cleanse their hearts and illumine their faces. Verily Thou art the  Powerful, the Precious, the Protecting!    O ye spiritual ones! The rules for election are those which are customary  in that country. The period of election is five years.    O Lord! O Lord! Bless this Spiritual Gathering, strengthen them by Thy  power for the spreading of Thy divine fragrances, cause them to follow Thy  will which is effective in the realities of all things, and aid them by a  confirmation such as never hath preceded to any one in former  centuries.(9) For these are servants of Thy servants and Thou hast crowned  them them with this diadem, the most luminous (Abha) gems of which will  shine unto all the horizons.    Verily Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty, the Giver!          \"O ye who are sincere! O ye who are firm! O ye who...\"      O ye who are sincere! O ye who are firm! O ye who are steadfast!    Verily, I received a letter from that brilliant body and Spiritual  Gathering--those who have arisen and called out for the Kingdom of God  among the peoples of America.    Verily, know with certain knowledge that ye will be confirmed by hosts  from the Kingdom of El-Abha and with inspirations from the Supreme  Concourse in the promotion of the Word of God. Verily, Abdul-Baha is with  you and supplicates unto God, desiring His heavenly blessings to surround  you, His divine favors to encompass you, the appearances of the Sun of  Truth to shine in your hearts, the glad tidings of God to rejoice your  spirits, the fragrances of holiness to perfume your nostrils, the verses  of guidance to be chanted in your gatherings, and the lamp of the Supreme  Concourse to illumine your meetings. Know with real assurance that this  light will encompass the horizons (the world) with great brilliancy.    I ask God to make ye lamps ignited by the great Light, so that ye may  stand with all power, meekness, humbleness, sacrifice and self-resignation  and thus become examples for the people and pure types for the world, be  salt of the earth, stars of guidance, great trees with broad foliage and  excellent fruits of fragrant scent, growing by the bounty of the cloud of  the Kingdom of El-Abha.    I praise God that ye were firm in faithfulness in that ye testified and  acknowledged the efforts which Mirza Assa Ullah(10) manifested in  spreading the fragrances of God and that ye thanked him for his labor and  teaching for you, and this is what gladdens the heart of Abdul-Baha.          \"O thou who art attracted by the Fragrances of God!...\"      O thou(11) who art attracted by the Fragrances of God!    Verily I say unto thee the truth, that I am with you in spirit and in  heart, that I rejoice by your joy and am happy by your happiness; and hear  with the ear of spirit your calling and scent with the spiritual nostrils  the fragrances of your garden.    O ye friends of God! Arise from the corporeal beds (bodies) and ask for  the divine favors, so that ye become revived by the Holy Spirit through  the breath which the Spirit breathes into the souls.    By the glory of my Lord, there will be for your brilliant assemblage an  evident sign and great effects in the spirits and the hearts. Therefore,  gladden the friends of the Merciful with the glad-tidings of thy Lord in  this time, and convey to them greeting from Abdul-Baha in this promised  century, so that they may arise with me in servitude to the Threshold of  El-Baha.          \"O ye servants of the Threshold of God!...\"      O ye servants of the Threshold of God!    The weekly reports of *** were received and I was informed of their  beautiful meanings which proved firmness and steadfastness in the Cause of  God and solidity in the Covenant of God.    Through the favor and providence of the Beauty(12) of Abha I trust that  Spiritual Gathering will develop day by day and will be reinforced by the  strength of God.    Communication with the friends of God in other countries is a source of  fragrant spirituality.    O ye members of the Spiritual Gathering! Appreciate this favor. This is  the glorious crown of the Kingdom, which, in this century, the Hand of the  Great Favor has placed on your head, and the gems of this brilliant diadem  will surely glisten unto all centuries.    Thank God that ye became a manifestation of such favor and are addressed  by such speech.          \"O ye friends of Abdul-Baha!...\"      O ye friends of Abdul-Baha!    Verily I read your reports with great joy. They are a cause of  spirituality and fragrance and a source of dilation of souls. If this  Spiritual Meeting, by the divine fragrance and heavenly confirmation, be  firmly established (or continued) it will become a source of great signs  and will be confirmed in matters of paramount importance.    The Spiritual Meetings, which are organized in this cycle of God and this  divine century, have never had their simile or likeness in bygone cycles.  For the great meetings (organizations) were under the protection of  aristocratic men, while these meetings (or organizations) are under the  protection of the bounty of El-Abha. The helper or supporter of those  (organizations) was either a prince or a king; either a priest was the  principal, or a great republic (the cause); but the Helper, the Assistant,  the Confirmer and the Inspirer of these spiritual meetings (or  organizations) is His Majesty the Everlasting God.    Consider not the present"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19317"],[0,"Gallipoli Diary,  Volume 1 (#7)"],[1,"or gains. Ten thousand years of peace would  fail to produce a spectacle of so great virtue. Where, in peace,  passengers have also shown high constancy, it is because war and martial  discipline have lent them its standards. Once in a generation a  mysterious wish for war passes through the people. Their instinct tells  them that _there is no other way_ of progress and of escape from habits  that no longer fit them. Whole generations of statesmen will fumble over  reforms for a lifetime which are put into full-blooded execution within  a week of a declaration of war. There is _no other way_. Only by intense  sufferings can the nations grow, just as the snake once a year must with  anguish slough off the once beautiful coat which has now become a strait  jacket.    How was it going to end? How touching the devotion of all these small  satellites so anxiously forming escort? Onwards, at snail's pace, moved  our cortege which might at any moment be transformed into a funeral  affair, but slow as we went we yet went fast enough to give the go-by  to the French battleship _Gaulois_, also creeping out towards Tenedos in  a lamentable manner attended by another crowd of T.B.s and destroyers  eager to stand to and save.    The _Inflexible_ managed to crawl into Tenedos under her own steam but  we stood by until we saw the _Gaulois_ ground on some rocks called  Rabbit Island, when I decided to clear right out so as not to be in the  way of the Navy at a time of so much stress. After we had gone ten miles  or so, the _Phaeton_ intercepted a wireless from the _Queen Elizabeth_,  ordering the _Ocean_ to take the _Irresistible_ in tow, from which it  would appear that she (the _Irresistible_) has also met with some  misfortune.    Thank God we were in time! That is my dominant feeling. We have seen a  spectacle which would be purchased cheap by five years of life and, more  vital yet, I have caught a glimpse of the forces of the enemy and of  their Forts. What with my hurried scamper down the Aegean coast of the  Peninsula and the battle in the Straits, I begin to form some first-hand  notion of my problem. More by good luck than good guidance I have got  into personal touch with the outer fringes of the thing we are up  against and that is so much to the good. But oh, that we had been here  earlier! Winston in his hurry to push me out has shown a more soldierly  grip than those who said there was no hurry. It is up to me now to  revolve to-day's doings in my mind; to digest them and to turn myself  into the eyes and ears of the War Office whose own so far have  certainly not proved themselves very acute. How much better would I be  able to make them see and hear had I been out a week or two; did I know  the outside of the Peninsula by heart; had I made friends with the  Fleet! And why should I not have been?    Have added a P.S. to K.'s letter:--    \"Between Tenedos and Lemnos. 6 p.m.--This has been a very bad day for us  judging by what has come under my own personal observation. After going  right up to Bulair and down again to the South-west point looking at the  network of trenches the Turks have dug commanding all possible landing  places, we turned into the Dardanelles themselves and went up about a  mile. The scene was what I believe Naval writers describe as 'lively.'\"  (Then follows an account based on my Diary jottings). I end:    \"I have not had time to reflect over these matters, nor can I yet  realise on my present slight information the extent of these losses.  Certainly it looks at present as if the Fleet would not be able to carry  on at this rate, and, if so, the soldiers will have to do the trick.\":    \"Later.    \"The _Irresistible_, the _Ocean_ and the _Bouvet_ are gone! The  _Bouvet_, they say, just slithered down like a saucer slithers down in a  bath. The _Inflexible_ and the _Gaulois_ are badly mauled.\"    _19th March, 1915._ _H.M.S. \"Franconia.\"_--Last night I left H.M.S.  _Phaeton_ and went on board the _Franconia_. To-day, we have been busy  fixing things up. The chance sailors, seen by the Staff, have been using  highly coloured expletives about the mines. Sheer bad luck they swear;  bad luck that would not happen once in a hundred tries. They had knocked  out the Forts, they claim, and one, three-word order, \"Full steam  ahead,\" would have cut the Gordian Knot the diplomats have been fumbling  at for over a hundred years by slicing their old Turkey in two. Then  came the big delay owing to ships changing stations during which mines  set loose from up above had time to float down the current, when, by the  Devil's own fluke, they impinge upon our battleships, and blow de Robeck  and his plans into the middle of next week--or later! These are  ward-room yarns. De Robeck was working by stages and never meant, so far  as we know, to run through to the Marmora yesterday.    Cabled to Lord K. telling him of yesterday's reconnaissance by me and  the battle by de Robeck. Have said I have no official report to go upon  but from what I saw with my own eyes \"I am being most reluctantly driven  to the conclusion that the Straits are not likely to be forced by  battleships as at one time seemed probable and that, if my troops are to  take part, it will not take the subsidiary form anticipated. The Army's  part will be more than mere landings of parties to destroy Forts, it  must be a deliberate and progressive military operation carried out at  full strength so as to open a passage for the Navy.\"    To be able, if necessary, to act up to my own words I sent another  message to the Admiral and told him, if he could spare the troops from  the vicinity of the Straits, I would like to take them right off to  Alexandria so as to shake them out there and reship them ready for  anything. He has wirelessed back asking me, on political grounds, to  delay removing the troops \"until our attack is renewed in a few days'  time.\"    Bravo, the Admiral! Still; if there are to be even a few days' delay I  must land somewhere as mules and horses are dying. And, practically,  Alexandria is the only port possible.    Wemyss has just sent me over the following letter. It confirms  officially the loss of the three battleships:--                                                                  _Friday._      \"My Dear General,    \"The enclosed is a copy of a Signal I have received from de Robeck. I  sincerely hope that the word disastrous is too hard. It depends upon  what results we have achieved I think. I gather from intercepted signals  that the _Ocean_ also is sunk, but of this I am not quite certain. I am  off in _Dublin_ immediately she comes in and expect I may be back  to-night. This of course depends a good deal upon what de Robeck wants.  Captain Boyle brings this and will be at your disposal. He is the Senior  Naval Officer here in my absence.                    \"Believe me, Sir,                     \"Yours sincerely,                         (_Sd._) \"R. Wemyss.\"               Copy of Telegram enclosed:--      \"_From_ V.A.E.M.S.    \"_To_ S.N.O. Mudros.    \"_Date, 18th March, 1915._    \"Negative demonstration at Gaba Tepe, 19th. Will you come to Tenedos and  see me to-morrow. We have had disastrous day owing either to floating  mines or torpedoes from shore tubes fired at long range. H.M.S.  _Irresistible_ and _Bouvet_ sunk. H.M.S. _Ocean_ still afloat, but  probably lost. H.M.S. _Inflexible_ damaged by mine. _Gaulois_ badly  damaged by gunfire. Other ships all right, and we had much the best of  the Ports.\"    _20th March, 1915._ _H.M.S. \"Franconia.\" Mudros Harbour._ Stormy  weather, and even here, inside Mudros harbour, touch with the shore is  cut off.    After I was asleep last night, an answer came in from K., straight,  strong and to the point. He says, \"You know my view that the Dardanelles  passage must be forced, and that if large military operations on the  Gallipoli Peninsula by your troops are necessary to clear the way, those  operations must be undertaken after careful consideration of the local  defences and must be carried through.\"    Very well: all hinges on the Admiral.    _21st March, 1915._ _H.M.S. \"Franconia.\"_ A talk with Admiral Wemyss and  General d'Amade. Wemyss is clear that the Navy must not admit a check  and must get to work again as quickly as they can. Wemyss is Senior  Naval Officer at the Dardanelles and is much liked by everyone. He has  put his seniority in his pocket and is under his junior--fighting first,  rank afterwards!    A letter from de Robeck, dated \"Q.E. the 19th,\" has only just come to  hand:--    \"Our men were splendid and thank heaven our loss of life was quite  small, though the French lost over 100 men when _Bouvet_ struck a mine.    \"How our ships struck mines in an area that was reported clear and swept  the previous night I do not know, unless they were floating mines  started from the Narrows!    \"I was sad to lose ships and my heart aches when one thinks of it; one  must do what one is told and take risks or otherwise we cannot win. We  are all getting ready for another 'go' and not in the least beaten or  downhearted. The big forts were silenced for a long time and everything  was going well, until _Bouvet_ struck a mine. It is hard to say what  amount of damage we did, I don't know, there were big explosions in the  Forts!\"    Little Birdie, now grown up into a grand General, turned up at 3 p.m. I  was enchanted to see him. We had hundreds and thousands of things to  talk over. Although the confidence of the sailors seems quite unshaken  by the events of the 18th, Birdie seems to have made up his mind that  the Navy have shot their bolt for the time being and that we have no  time to lose in getting ready for a landing. But then he did not see the  battle and cannot, therefore, gauge the extent to which the Turkish  Forts were beaten.    _22nd March, 1915._ _H.M.S. \"Franconia.\"_ At 10 a.m. we had another  Conference on board the _Queen Elizabeth_."]]]
