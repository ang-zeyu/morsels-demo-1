It was  crushed flat, and only a small part of it remained. Possibly it had  turned after burial, as fragments of other bones were found here and  there toward the south from it, indicating an extended burial. The  teeth were hard, solid, and much worn. The bones found were more or  less gnawed, and among them were scraps, probably of food animals,  burned into charcoal. No bones found could be saved, as they were very  soft.      CAIRN (3)    This was similar in construction to (1) and (2), as is shown in figure  4. The wall, along the outside, measured 14 feet on the south, 13 feet  on the north, 15 feet on the west, and 14 feet on the east. The  inclosed space was 10 feet across each way. Some one had dug out much  of the south end; the northern end was undisturbed.      [Illustration: FIG. 4.--Outline of Cairn (3), Lost Hill.]    The prior excavation had barely missed, near the west wall, a few  fragments of an adult skull and three teeth. About even with the  middle point of the west wall, 2 feet from it, was evidence of the  burial of an adult--pieces of bone and skull, and some teeth. North of  these, near the northwest corner, were fragments of two adult skulls,  with one of which were some beads made of shells of water snails; 18  of these were recovered, all more or less decayed. Between these two  skulls were parts of a child's skull, the teeth not yet through the  bone.    Inclined flat stones in the eastern half of the grave, the tops  leaning eastward, denoted other burials; but nothing was found under  them, although small flat stones laid on the original surface  indicated the bottom of a grave.    Evidently several burials, of which all traces have disappeared, were  made in this vault.    Owing to the practical identity of these three graves, the poor  returns, and the difficulty of working in a tangled mass of tough  roots without displacing the stones so greatly that their proper  position became a perplexing question, the remaining three were not  excavated.      EXPLORATION OF THE GOURD CREEK CAVE (8)    Near the mouth of Gourd Creek, on the north side, is a cave which has  acquired much local reputation from its size and also from the  evidence it affords of a long-continued occupation by the aborigines.  It is easily reached from the road which passes in front; wagons can  be driven into it and there is ample space for them to turn and pass  out. Formerly it was much resorted to as a pleasant place for social  gatherings; but in recent years it has been used as a barn and  storehouse. The owner, Mr. Valentine Allen, gave cheerful permission  for all the excavation that was desired, subject only to the proviso  that the floor be put back in condition suitable for the purposes for  which he needed it. And it is only fair to state that he was not at  all difficult to satisfy in this respect.    A stream coming from the interior had a flow at the close of the long  drought in 1918 sufficient to fill a 2-inch pipe with a rapid fall; in  wet seasons the water spreads from wall to wall until it comes to  within 100 feet of the mouth.    Back in the cave, where the slope is greater, it has sufficient volume  and force to carry away all pebbles smaller than coarse gravel and the  material that finds lodgment among the stones.    The cave is easily traversed for almost 600 feet; beyond this are  narrow crevices and tortuous passages, where explorers must frequently  crawl or clamber. One adventurous party proceeded until they reached  an opening on the other side of the hill; but this was so choked by  fallen rock and debris from the hillside as to be impassable. In  storms a strong breeze passes through the main entrance, in or out in  accordance with the direction of the wind.    Owing to the irregular outline of the cliffs, the width of the  entrance can not be accurately given. From side to side, well under  the front of the ceiling the distance is 110 feet. Two hundred feet  toward the interior it contracts to 50 feet. At the entrance the walls  are vertical to a height of 25 feet; a short curve at the top on  either side, due to the breaking away of the ledges, connects them  with the roof, which is somewhat higher. Being a single massive  stratum, the top is practically horizontal, but the floor constantly  rises from the front with a slight and fairly uniform grade. The front  chamber is straight and well lighted for 300 feet, where it turns  abruptly westward; from this point the floor is solid rock which the  water keeps comparatively free from any loose matter except heavy  blocks from the walls or top.    Beginning at the entrance is a deposit whose farthest extension  reaches 100 feet into the cavern. It is composed to a small extent of  sand and clay carried by the stream, and of earth blown or washed in  from the outside; but, as investigation proved, it is mainly ashes  from prehistoric fires. The surface of this deposit, especially toward  the inner end, is very uneven, being higher near the walls than  through the central portion. This is due to two causes: In very wet  seasons water has carried away much of it, and a large amount has been  hauled out by the owner to scatter over his fields as a fertilizer. He  reports that in the course of this work he found quantities of pottery  fragments, broken bones, flints, and \"two or three\" human skeletons,  with fragments of others. This is the basis for the assertion,  frequently heard, that \"many\" or \"very many\" burials had been made  here. The only human remains which he saved are the complete skull of  an adult, remarkably preserved and apparently that of a white woman; a  rather large lower jaw, of a man; a few long bones; and parts of  skulls and jaws of three or four children.    From comments made and questions asked by visitors while the  investigation was in progress, it seems that bones and teeth of deer  and other animals are mistaken for those of people. No human bones  were uncovered in this work, except as noted below.    There is a firm belief in the community that somewhere in this cave is  concealed $100,000 in gold, seven \"pony loads\" in all, which was put  here by an old squaw, sole survivor of a massacre by which her tribe  was exterminated. Much of the irregularity of surface noted in the  deposits is due to the efforts of persons trying to find this money.    Before starting the work it was necessary to deepen the little stream,  which had cut its way through the accumulation much nearer to the  western than to the eastern wall of the cavern, in order to allow the  water to run out of the lower end of the deposit. Thorough drainage of  the whole mass was impossible, as water continually seeped in from the  gravel bed farther up, a condition which could not be remedied.    Bedrock was reached at a depth of 3 feet below the channel. The lower  2 feet of this distance was through a black, mucky substance which was  so tough and sticky that removing it was like digging through a bog.    Following the bedrock as a floor, the western side of the deposit was  first examined. It had a width of 35 feet at the mouth of the cave,  gradually narrowing inward for a distance of 75 feet, where it  terminated at the level of the water. Its greatest elevation, at the  side of the entrance, was about 10 feet; but this does not mean that  its thickness was so much at any point, as the rock sloped upward  quite as rapidly as the surface. So many stones were scattered through  it, fallen from the sides and roof, or rolled in from the outside  where they had broken loose from the cliff, that not more than  one-fourth of the area could be excavated. These rocks varied in size  from cobblestones to blocks weighing 3 or 4 tons. They were at all  levels, some lying on the rock floor, others only slightly imbedded in  the earth. Yet the superficial accumulation extended under all of them  except such as were in direct contact with the bedrock, proving that  the cave was occupied throughout the period in which such downfalls  occurred. An additional evidence of age is the fact that the usual  debris, such as bones, flints, pottery, ashes, etc., lay in immediate  contact with the bedrock where this has weathered to a chalky  consistency from 2 to 4 inches in depth since these objects were left  there.    Owing to the uneven surface of both the bedrock and the deposits on  it, the thickness of the latter varied from 1 to 3 feet--not including  the muck, which last, however, disappeared at the level where the rock  rose above the water line. But, whatever the depth, more than half the  overlying material was pure ashes; either resting undisturbed on the  fire beds, or piled in irregular masses, where they had been thrown to  get them out of the way. The largest ash bed was near the wall; it  measured from 4 to 7 feet across, with a very uneven outline, as if  many fires had been made there at different times.    The objects discovered included flint knives, spearheads, arrowheads  (mostly broken), with many spalls and chips; potsherds (only very  small pieces were found); animal bones; mussel shells; bone  perforators; chert nodules, more or less flaked; two stone beads or  buttons; a small fragment of a pipe; but no mortars, hammers, pestles,  cooking-stones, or hatchets, such as are usually found on the sites of  Indian villages. None of the pottery was decorated, but most of it was  cord-marked, though some of it was so smoothed and polished as almost  to appear glazed. It varied through a wide range of color, thickness,  and general appearance, and was noticeably deficient in quantity. In  fact, the west side of the cave had less the appearance of a  permanently occupied site than of a camping place which was used as a  temporary resort by traveling or hunting parties; but at the same time  the depth and amount of ashes showed that it had afforded shelter  through a long "]]]
