They become large landowners, men of  business and affairs.    The question may be asked whether genius makes its way to the front in  spite of unfavorable circumstances. Sometimes it doubtless does. But  pugnacity and perseverance are not necessarily connected with  intellectual genius. Genius may be as likely to be timid as belligerent.  Therefore unfavorable circumstances may crush many a genius.    The public schools ought to be on the watch for genius in any and all  kinds of work. When a genius is found, proper training ought to be  provided to develop this genius for the good of society as well as for  the good of the individual himself. A few children show ability in  drawing and painting, others in music, others in mechanical invention,  some in literary construction. When it is found that this ability is  undoubtedly a native gift and not a passing whim, special opportunity  should be provided for its development and training. It will be better  for the general welfare, as well as for individual happiness, if each  does in life that for which he is by nature best fitted. For most of us,  however, there is not much difference in our abilities. We can do one  thing as well as we can many other things. But in a few there are  undoubted special native gifts.      SUMMARY. This is an orderly world, in which everything has a cause.    All events are connected in a chain of causes and effects. Human    beings live in this world of natural law and are subject to it.    Human life is completely within this world of law and order and is a    part of it. Education is possible only because we can change human    beings by having influences act upon them.      Individuals receive their original traits from their ancestors,    probably as parts or units. Mendelism is the doctrine of the pure    transmission of unit characters. Eugenics is the science of    improving the human race by selective breeding. An individual's life    is the result of the interaction of his hereditary characteristics    and his environment.      CLASS EXERCISES    1. Try to find rock containing the remains of animals. You can get  information on such matters from a textbook on geology.    2. Read in a geology about the different geological epochs in the  history of the earth.    3. Make a comparison of the length of infancy in the lower animals and  in man. What is the significance of what you find? What advantage does  it give man?    4. What is natural selection? How does it lead to change in animals?  Does natural selection still operate among human beings? (See a modern  textbook on zooelogy.)    5. By observation and from consulting a zooelogy, learn about the  different classes of animal forms, from low forms to high forms.    6. By studying domestic animals, see what you can learn about heredity.  Enumerate all the points that you find bearing upon heredity.    7. In a similar way, make a study of heredity in your family. Consider  such characteristics as height, weight, shape of head, shape of nose,  hair and eye color. Can you find any evidence of the inheritance of  mental traits?    8. Make a complete outline of Chapter II.      REFERENCES FOR CLASS READING    DAVENPORT: _Heredity in Relation to Eugenics_.    KELLICOTT: _The Social Direction of Human Evolution_.          CHAPTER III    MIND AND BODY      =Gross Dependence.= The relation of mind to body has always been an  interesting one to man. This is partly because of the connection of the  question with that of life after death. An old idea of this relation,  almost universally held till recently, was that the mind or spirit lived  in the body but was more or less independent of the body. The body has  been looked upon as a hindrance to the mind or spirit. Science knows  nothing about the existence of spirits apart from bodies. The belief  that after death the mind lives on is a matter of faith and not of  science. Whether one believes in an existence of the mind after death of  the body, depends on one's religious faith. There is no scientific  evidence one way or the other. The only mind that science knows anything  about is bound up very closely with body. This is not saying that there  is no existence of spirit apart from body, but that at present such  existence is beyond the realm of science.    The dependence of mind upon body in a general way is evident to every  one, upon the most general observation and thought. We know the effect  on the mind of disease, of good health, of hunger, of fatigue, of  overwork, of severe bodily injury, of blindness or deafness. We have,  perhaps, seen some one struck upon the head by a club, or run over by an  automobile, and have noted the tremendous consequences to the person's  mind. In such cases it sometimes happens that, as far as we can see,  there is no longer any mind in connection with that body. The most  casual observation, then, shows that mind and body are in some way most  intimately related.    =Finer Dependence.= Let us note this relation more in detail, and, in  particular, see just which part of the body it is that is connected with  the mind. First of all, we note the dependence of mind upon sense  organs. We see only with our eyes. If we close the eyelids, we cannot  see. If we are born blind, or if injury or disease destroys the retinas  of the eyes or makes the eyes opaque so that light cannot pass through  to the retinas, then we cannot see.    Similarly, we hear only by means of the ears. If we are born deaf, or if  injury destroys some important part of the hearing mechanism, then we  cannot hear. In like manner, we taste only by means of the taste organs  in the mouth, and smell only with the organs of smell in the nose. In a  word, our primary knowledge of the world comes only through the sense  organs. We shall see presently just how this sensing or perceiving is  accomplished.    =Dependence of Mind on Nerves and Brain.= We have seen how in a general  way the mind is dependent on the body. We have seen how in a more  intimate way it is dependent on the special sense organs. But the part  of the body to which the mind is most directly and intimately related is  the nervous system. The sense organs themselves are merely modifications  of the nerve ends together with certain mechanisms for enabling stimuli  to act on the nerve ends. The eye is merely the optic nerve spread out  to form the retina and modified in certain ways to make it sensitive to  ether vibrations. In addition to this, there is, of course, the focusing  mechanism of the eye. So for all the sense organs; they are, each of  them, some sort of modification of nerve-endings which makes them  sensitive to some particular force or substance.    Let us make the matter clear by an illustration. Suppose I see a picture  on the wall. My eyes are directed toward the picture. Light from the  picture is refracted within the eyes, forming an image on each retina.  The retina is sensitive to the light. The light produces chemical  changes on the retina. These changes set up an excitation in the optic  nerves, which is conducted to a certain place in the brain, causing an  excitation in the brain. Now the important point is that when this  excitation is going on in the brain, _we are conscious, we see the  picture_.    As far as science can determine, we do not see, nor hear, nor taste, nor  smell, nor have any other sensation unless a sense organ is excited and  produces the excitation in the brain. There can be no doubt about our  primary, sensory experience. By primary, sensory experience is meant our  immediate, direct knowledge of any aspect of the world. In this field of  our conscious life, we are entirely dependent upon sense organs and  nerves and brain. Injuries to the eyes destroying their power to perform  their ordinary work, or injuries to the optic nerve or to the visual  center in the brain, make it impossible for us to see.    These facts are so self-evident that it seems useless to state them. One  has but to hold his hands before his eyes to convince himself that the  mind sees by means of eyes, which are physical sense organs. One has but  to hold his hands tight over his ears to find out that he hears by  means of ears--again, physical sense organs.    But simple and self-evident as the facts are, their acceptance must have  tremendous consequences to our thinking, and to our view of human  nature. If the mind is dependent in every feature on the body with its  sense organs, this must give to this body and its sense organs an  importance in our thought and scheme of things that they did not have  before. This close dependence of mind upon body must give to the body a  place in our scheme of education that it would not have under any other  view of the mind. We wish to emphasize here that this statement of the  close relation of the mind and body is not a theory which one may accept  or not. It is a simple statement of fact. It is a presupposition of  psychology. By \"presupposition\" is meant a fundamental principle which  the psychologist always has in mind. It is axiomatic, and has the same  place in psychology that axioms have in mathematics. All explanations of  the working of the mind must be stated in terms of nerve and brain  action, and stimulation of sense organs.    Since the sense organs are the primary and fundamental organs through  which we get experience, and since the sensations are the elementary  experiences out of which all mental life is built, it is necessary for  us to have a clear idea of the sense organs, their structure and  functions, and of the nature of sensations.    =Vision.= _The Visual Sense Organs._ The details of the anatomy of the eye  can be looked up in a physiological textbook. The essential principles  are very simple. The eye is made on the principle of a photographer's  camera.

The seventh child  was always thought to be exceptionally lucky, and [TR: unreadable HW  replaces 'the bond of affection between the parents and this child was  greater']. This belief persists today in many localities.    Every family was given a weekly supply of food but this was more for  convenience than anything else as they were free to eat anything their  appetites called for. They killed chickens, ate vegetables, meats, etc.  at any time. The presence of guests at the \"quarters\" roused Mrs. Towns  to activity and she always helped to prepare the menu. One of her  favorite items was chicken--prepared four different ways, in pie, in  stew, fried, and baked. She gave full directions for the preparation of  these delicacies to unskilled cooks. Pound cake was another favorite and  she insisted that a pound of butter and a dozen eggs be used in each  cake. When the meal was nearly ready, she usually made a trip to the  cabin to see if it had been well prepared. The hostess could always tell  without any comment whether she had satisfied her mistress, for if she  had, a serving was carried back to the big house. Fishing was a form of  remunerative recreation enjoyed by all. Everyone usually went on  Saturday afternoon, but if only a few made the trip, the catch was  shared by all.    Sewing was no easy job as there were few small women among the servants.  The cloth made at home, was plentiful, however, and sufficient clothing  was made for all. Some persons preferred making their own clothes and  this privilege was granted; otherwise they were made in a common sewing  room. Ten yards was the average amount of cloth in a dress, homespun and  gingham, the usual materials. The men wore suits of osnaburg and jeans.  This was dyed to more durable colors through the use of [HW: with]  indigo [HW: (blue)] and a dye made from railroad bark (brown).    Phil believes that the screeching of an owl, the bellowing of a cow, and  the howling of a dog after dark are signs of death because the [HW:  immediate] death of a human being is revealed to animals, which [TR:  illegible. 'in turn'?] warn humans. Though we may find some way to rid  ourselves of the fear of the warning--the death will occur just the  same.    On nearly all plantations there were some slaves who, trying to escape  work, hid themselves in the woods. [TR: original line: On nearly all  plantations there were some slaves who did not wish to work,  consequently, for this, or similar reasons, hid themselves in the  woods.] They smuggled food to their hiding place by night, and remained  away [HW: lost] in some instances, many months. Their belief in  witchcraft caused them to resort to most ridiculous means of avoiding  discovery. Phil told the story of a man who visited a conjurer to obtain  a \"hand\" for which he paid fifty dollars in gold. The symbol was a  hickory stick which he used whenever he was being chased, and in this  manner warded off his pursuers. The one difficulty in this procedure was  having to \"set up\" at a fork or cross roads. Often the fugitive had to  run quite a distance to reach such a spot, but when the stick was so  placed human beings and even bloodhounds lost his trail. With this  assistance, he was able to remain in the woods as long as he liked.    Snakes ware frequent visitor in the cabins of the \"quarters\". One  morning while Betty, a cook, was confined to bed, she sent for Mrs.  Towns to tell her that a snake had lain across her chest during the  previous night and had tried to get under the cover where her young baby  lay asleep. Mrs. Towns was skeptical about the size and activities of  the reptile but sent for several men to search the house. They had given  up the search when one chanced to glance above the sick woman's bed and  there lay the reptile on a shelf. The bed was roped and moved to another  part of the room and preparations made to shoot him. Quilts were piled  high on the bed so that the noise of the gun would not frighten the  baby. When all was ready Mrs. Towns asked the old man with the gun--    \"Daddy Luke, can you _kill_ the snake?\"    \"Yessum, mistress,\" he replied.    \"Daddy Luke, can you _kill_ the snake?\"    \"Yessum, mistress.\"    \"Daddy Luke, can you _kill_ the snake?\"    \"Yessum, mistress.\"    \"Shoot!!\"    He took careful aim and fired. The huge reptile rolled to the floor.    When the men returned to the yard to work near the woodpile, the mate  was discovered by one of the dogs that barked until a log was moved and  the second snake killed.    [HW: In those days] small snakes were not feared and for several years  it was customary for women to carry a tiny green snake in their bosoms.  This fad was discontinued when one of the women was severely injured  through a bite on her chest.    Phil remembers when the stars fell in 1833. \"They came down like rain,\"  he said. When asked why he failed to keep some, he replied that he was  afraid to touch them even after they became black.    [TR: The following paragraphs contain many crossouts replaced by  unreadable handwritten edits, and will be indicated by: 'deleted words'  replaced by ??.]    Freedom was discussed on the plantation [TR: ??] for many years before  the Civil War began. As contented as [TR: 'they' replaced by ??] were  [TR: 'there was something to look forward to when they thought of'  replaced by ??] being absolutely free. An ex-slave's description of the  real cause of the Civil War, deserves a place here. It seems that  Lincoln had sent several messages to Davis requesting that he free the  slaves. No favorable response was received. Lincoln had a conference  with Mr. Davis and to this meeting he carried a Bible and a gun. He  tried in vain to convince Davis that he was wrong according to the  Bible, so he finally threw the two upon the table and asked Davis to  take his choice. He chose the gun. Lincoln grasped the Bible and rushed  home. Thus Davis _began_ the war but Lincoln had God on his side and so  he _ended_ it.    One of Gov. Towns' sons went to the army and Phil was sent to care for  him while he was there; an aristocratic man never went to the war  without his valet. His [HW: Phil's] duty was to cook for him, keep his  clothes clean, and to bring the body home if he was killed. Poor  soldiers were either buried [HW: where they fell] or left lying on the  field for vultures to consume. Food was not so plentiful in the [TR:  'army' replaced by ??] and their diet of flapjacks and canned goods was  varied only by coffee and whiskey given when off duty. All cooking was  done between two battles or during the lull in a battle. John Towns was  soon sent back home as they [HW: the officers] felt he was too [TR:  'valuable a Southerner' crossed out] important to be killed in battle,  and his services were needed at home.    Near the close of the war, Sherman made a visit to this vicinity. As was  his usual habit, he had [TR: 'obtained' replaced by 'learned'?] the  reputation of Gov. Towns before he arrived. He found conditions so ideal  [TR: 'that not one thing was touched' replaced by ??]. He talked with  [HW: slaves and owners, he] went [TR: 'gaily' deleted] on his way. Phil  was so impressed by Sherman that he followed him and camped with the  Yankees about where Central City Park is now. He thought that anything a  Yankee said was true. [HW: When] One [HW: of them] gave him a knife and  told him to go and cut the first man he met, he followed instructions  even though he knew the man. [HW: Later] Realizing how foolishly he had  acted, he readily apologized and explained why. [HW: The Yankee soldiers  robbed beehives barehanded and were never stung, they] seemed to fear  nothing but lizards. Never having seen such reptiles they would run in  terror at the sight of one. The Confederates never discovered this.    After the close of the war they [HW: federal soldiers] were stationed in  the towns to keep order. Union flags were placed everywhere, and a  Southerner was accused of not respecting the flag if he even passed  under one without bowing. Penalties for this offense were, to be hung up  by the thumbs, to carry greasy [HW: greased] poles for a certain time,  and numerous other punishments which caused a deal of discomfort to the  victims but sent the soldiers and ex-slaves into peals of laughter. The  sight of a Yankee soldier sent a Confederate one into hysteria.    [HW: Phil says his fellow] slaves laughed when told they were free, but  Gov. Towns was almost indifferent. His slaves, he said, were always  practically free, so a little legal form did not [TR: 'add' replaced by  ??] much to them. Nearly every one remained there and worked for wages.    For the past thirty-five years, Phil Towns has been almost totally  disabled. Long life seems no novelty to him for he says everyone used to  live longer when they honored their elders more. He has eighty-four  relatives in Virginia--all older than he, but states that friends who  have visited there say he looks more aged than any of them. His great  desire is to return to Virginia, as he believes he will be able to find  the familiar landmarks in spite of the changes that have taken place.    Mr. Alex Block, of Macon, makes no charges for the old shack in which  Phil lives; his food furnished by the Department of Public Welfare is  supplemented by interested friends.
