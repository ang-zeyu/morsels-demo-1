The Elamite name Eri-Aku, \"servant of the moon-       god,\" was changed by some of his subjects into the       Babylonian Rim-Sin, \"Have mercy, O Moon-god!\" just as       Abesukh, the Hebrew Absihu'a (\"the father of welfare\") was       transformed into the Babylonian Ebisum (\"the actor\").--Ed.]      It was not the first time that Elam had audaciously interfered in  the affairs of her neighbours. In fabulous times, one of her mythical  kings--Khumbaba the Ferocious--had oppressed. Uruk, and Gilgames with  all his valour was barely able to deliver the town. Sargon the Elder is  credited with having subdued Elam; the kings and vicegerents of Lagash,  as well as those of Uru and. Larsam, had measured forces with Anshan,  but with no decisive issue. From time to time they obtained an  advantage, and we find recorded in the annals victories gained by Gudea,  Ine-sin, or Bursin, but to be followed only by fresh reverses; at the  close of such campaigns, and in order to seal the ensuing peace, a  princess of Susa would be sent as a bride to one of the Chaldaean cities,  or a Chaldaean lady of royal birth would enter the harem of a king of  Anshan. Elam was protected along the course of the Tigris and on the  shores of the Nar-Marratum by a wide marshy region, impassable except  at a few fixed and easily defended places. The alluvial plain extending  behind the marshes was as rich and fertile as that of Chaldaea. Wheat and  barley ordinarily yielded an hundred and at times two hundredfold; the  towns were surrounded by a shadeless belt of palms; the almond, fig,  acacia, poplar, and willow extended in narrow belts along the rivers'  edge. The climate closely resembles that of Chaldaja: if the midday heat  in summer is more pitiless, it is at least tempered by more frequent  east winds. The ground, however, soon begins to rise, ascending  gradually towards the north-east. The distant and uniform line of  mountain-peaks grows loftier on the approach of the traveller, and the  hills begin to appear one behind another, clothed halfway up with thick  forests, but bare on their summits, or scantily covered with meagre  vegetation. They comprise, in fact, six or seven parallel ranges,  resembling natural ramparts piled up between the country of the Tigris  and the table-land of Iran. The intervening valleys were formerly lakes,  having had for the most part no communication with each other and no  outlet into the sea. In the course of centuries they had dried up,  leaving a thick deposit of mud in the hollows of their ancient beds,  from which sprang luxurious and abundant harvests. The rivers--the  Uknu,* the Ididi,** and the Ulai***--which water this region are, on  reaching more level ground, connected by canals, and are constantly  shifting their beds in the light soil of the Susian plain: they soon  attain a width equal to that of the Euphrates, but after a short time  lose half their volume in swamps, and empty themselves at the present  day into the Shatt-el-Arab. They flowed formerly into that part of the  Persian Gulf which extended as far as Kornah, and the sea thus formed  the southern frontier of the kingdom.         * The Uknu is the Kerkhah of the present day, the Choaspes       of the Greeks.         ** The Ididi was at first identified with the ancient       Pasitigris, which scholars then desired to distinguish from       the Eulseos: it is now known to be the arm of the Karun       which runs to Dizful, the Koprates of classical times, which       has sometimes been confounded with the Eulaws.         *** The Ulai, mentioned in the Hebrew texts (Ban. viii. 2,       16), the Euloos of classical writers, also called       Pasitigris. It is the Karun of the present day, until its       confluence with the Shaur, and subsequently the Shaur       itself, which waters the foot of the Susian hills.    From earliest times this country was inhabited by three distinct  peoples, whose descendants may still be distinguished at the present  day, and although they have dwindled in numbers and become mixed with  elements of more recent origin, the resemblance to their forefathers  is still very remarkable. There were, in the first place, the short  and robust people of well-knit figure, with brown skins, black hair and  eyes, who belonged to that negritic race which inhabited a considerable  part of Asia in prehistoric times.*         * The connection of the negroid type of Susians with the       negritic races of India and Oceania, has been proved, in the       course of M. Dieulafoy's expedition to the Susian plains and       the ancient provinces of Elam.

These prevailed in the lowlands and the valleys, where the warm, damp  climate favoured their development; but they also spread into the  mountain region, and had pushed their outposts as far as the first  slopes of the Iranian table-land. They there contact with white-skinned  of medium height, who were probably allied to the nations of Northern  and Central Asia--to the Scythians,* for instance, if it is permissible  to use a vague term employed by the Ancients.         * This last-mentioned people is, by some authors, for       reasons which, so far, can hardly be considered conclusive,       connected with the so-called Sumerian race, which we find       settled in Chaldaea. They are said to have been the first to       employ horses and chariots in warfare.    [Illustration: 047.jpg NATIVE OF MIXED NEGRITIC RACE FROM SUSIANA]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph furnished by       Marcel Dieulafoy.      Semites of the same stock as those of Chaldaea pushed forward as far as  the east bank of the Tigris, and settling mainly among the marshes led a  precarious life by fishing and pillaging.* The country of the plain  was called Anzan, or Anshan,** and the mountain region Numma, or Ilamma,  \"the high lands:\" these two names were subsequently used to denote the  whole country, and Ilamma has survived in the Hebrew word Elam.*** Susa,  the most important and flourishing town in the kingdom, was situated  between the Ulai and the Ididi, some twenty-five or thirty miles from  the nearest of the mountain ranges.         * From the earliest times we meet beyond the Tigris with       names like that of Durilu, a fact which proves the existence       of races speaking a Semitic dialect in the countries under       the suzerainty of the King of Elam: in the last days of the       Chaldaean empire they had assumed such importance that the       Hebrews made out Elam to be one of the sons of Shem (_Gen._       x. 22).         ** Anzan, Anshan, and, by assimilation of the nasal with the       sibilant, Ashshan. This name has already been mentioned in       the inscriptions of the kings and vicegerents of Lagash and       in the _Book of Prophecies_ of the ancient Chaldaean       astronomers; it also occurs in the royal preamble of Cyrus       and his ancestors, who like him were styled \"kings of       Anshan.\" It had been applied to the whole country of Elam,       and afterwards to Persia. Some are of opinion that it was       the name of a part of Elam, viz. that inhabited by the       Turanian Medes who spoke the second language of the       Achaemenian inscriptions, the eastern half, bounded by the       Tigris and the Persian Gulf, consisting of a flat and swampy       land. These differences of opinion gave rise to a heated       controversy; it is now, however, pretty generally admitted       that Anzan-Anshan was really the plain of Elam, from the       mountains to the sea, and one set of authorities affirms       that the word Anzan may have meant \"plain\" in the language       of the country, while others hesitate as yet to pronounce       definitely on this point.         *** The meaning of \"Nunima,\" \"Ilamma,\" \"Ilamtu,\" in the       group of words used to indicate Elam, had been recognised       even by the earliest Assyriologists; the name originally       referred to the hilly country on the north and east of Susa.       To the Hebrews, Elam was one of the sons of Shem (Gen. x.       22). The Greek form of the name is Elymais, and some of the       classical geographers were well enough acquainted with the       meaning of the word to be able to distinguish the region to       which it referred from Susiana proper.    [Illustration: 048.jpg THE TUMULUS OF SUSA, AS IT APPEARED TOWARDS THE  MIDDLE OF THE XIXth CENTURY]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, after a plate in Chesney.    Its fortress and palace were raised upon the slopes of a mound which  overlooked the surrounding country:* at its base, to the eastward,  stretched the town, with its houses of sun-dried bricks.**         * Susa, in the language of the country, was called Shushun;       this name was transliterated into Chaldaeo-Assyrian, by       Shushan, Shushi.         ** Strabo tells us, on the authority of Polycletus, that the       town had no walls in the time of Alexander, and extended       over a space two hundred stadia in length; in the       VIII century B.C. it was enclosed by walls with bastions,       which are shown on a bas-relief of Assurbanipal, but it was       surrounded by unfortified suburbs.    Further up the course of the Uknu, lay the following cities: Madaktu,  the Badaca of classical authors,* rivalling Susa in strength and  importance; Naditu,** Til-Khumba,*** Dur-Undash,**** Khaidalu.^--all  large walled towns, most of which assumed the title of royal cities.  Elam in reality constituted a kind of feudal empire, composed of several  tribes--the Habardip, the Khushshi, the Umliyash, the people of Yamutbal  and of Yatbur^^--all independent of each other, but often united under  the authority of one sovereign, who as a rule chose Susa as the seat of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17325"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 5 (of 12) (#7)"],[1,"foreign  governments to treat Egyptians with a like clemency should they chance  to proffer a similar request.*         * All this seems to result from a letter in which the King       of Alasia demands from Amenothes III. the restitution of the       goods of one of his subjects who had died in Egypt; the tone       of the letter is that of one asking a favour, and on the       supposition that the King of Egypt had a right to keep the       property of a foreigner dying on his territory.    It is also not improbable that the sovereigns themselves had a personal  interest in more than one commercial undertaking, and that they were  the partners, or, at any rate, interested in the enterprises, of many  of their subjects, so that any loss sustained by one of the latter  would eventually fall upon themselves. They had, in fact, reserved to  themselves the privilege of carrying on several lucrative industries,  and of disposing of the products to foreign buyers, either to those who  purchased them out and out, or else through the medium of agents, to  whom they intrusted certain quantities of the goods for warehousing.  The King of Babylon, taking advantage of the fashion which prompted  the Egyptians to acquire objects of Chaldaean goldsmiths' and  cabinet-makers' art, caused ingots of gold to be sent to him by the  Pharaoh, which he returned worked up into vases, ornaments, household  utensils, and plated chariots. He further fixed the value of all  such objects, and took a considerable commission for having acted as  intermediary in the transaction.* In Alasia, which was the land of  metals, the king appears to have held a monopoly of the bronze. Whether  he smelted it in the country, or received it from more distant regions  ready prepared, we cannot say, but he claimed and retained for himself  the payment for all that the Pharaoh deigned to order of him.**         * Letter of Burnaburiash to Amenothes IV.         ** Letter from the King of Alasia to Amenothes III., where,       whilst pretending to have nothing else in view than making a       present to his royal brother, he proposes to make an       exchange of some bronze for the products of Egypt,       especially for gold.    From such instances we can well understand the jealous, watch which  these sovereigns exercised, lest any individual connected with  corporations of workmen should leave the kingdom and establish himself  in another country without special permission. Any emigrant who opened  a workshop and initiated his new compatriots in the technique or  professional secrets of his craft, was regarded by the authorities as  the most dangerous of all evil-doers. By thus introducing his trade into  a rival state, he deprived his own people of a good customer, and thus  rendered himself liable to the penalties inflicted on those who were  guilty of treason. His savings were confiscated, his house razed to the  ground, and his whole family--parents, wives, and children--treated  as partakers in his crime. As for himself, if justice succeeded in  overtaking him, he was punished with death, or at least with mutilation,  such as the loss of eyes and ears, or amputation of the feet. This  severity did not prevent the frequent occurrence of such cases, and  it was found necessary to deal with them by the insertion of a special  extradition clause in treaties of peace and other alliances. The two  contracting parties decided against conceding the right of habitation  to skilled workmen who should take refuge with either party on the  territory of the other, and they agreed to seize such workmen forthwith,  and mutually restore them, but under the express condition that neither  they nor any of their belongings should incur any penalty for the  desertion of their country. It would be curious to know if all the  arrangements agreed to by the kings of those times were sanctioned,  as in the above instance, by properly drawn up agreements. Certain  expressions occur in their correspondence which seem to prove that this  was the case, and that the relations between them, of which we can catch  traces, resulted not merely from a state of things which, according  to their ideas, did not necessitate any diplomatic sanction, but from  conventions agreed to after some war, or entered on without any previous  struggle, when there was no question at issue between the two states.*         * The treaty of Ramses II. with the King of the Khati, the       only one which has come down to us, was a renewal of other       treaties effected one after the other between the fathers       and grandfathers of the two contracting sovereigns. Some of       the Tel el-Amarna letters probably refer to treaties of this       kind; e.g. that of Burnaburiash of Babylon, who says that       since the time of Karaindash there had been an exchange of       ambassadors and friendship between the sovereigns of Chaldoa       and of Egypt, and also that of Dushratta of Mitanni, who       reminds Queen Tii of the secret negotiations which had taken       place between him and Amenothes III.    When once the Syrian conquest had been effected, Egypt gave permanency  to its results by means of a series of international decrees, which  officially established the constitution of her empire, and brought about  her concerted action with the Asiatic powers.    [Illustration: 040.jpg THE MUMMY OF THUTMOSIS III.]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph taken by Emil       Brugsch-Bey.    She already occupied an important position among them, when Thutmosis  III. died, on the last day of Phamenoth, in the IVth year of his reign.*  He was buried, probably, at Deir el-Bahari, in the family tomb wherein  the most illustrious members of his house had been laid to rest since  the time of Thutmosis I. His mummy was not securely hidden away, for  towards the close of the XXth dynasty it was torn out of the coffin by  robbers, who stripped it and rifled it of the jewels with which it was  covered, injuring it in their haste to carry away the spoil. It was  subsequently re-interred, and has remained undisturbed until the  present day; but before re-burial some renovation of the wrappings was  necessary, and as portions of the body had become loose, the restorers,  in order to give the mummy the necessary firmness, compressed it between  four oar-shaped slips of wood, painted white, and placed, three inside  the wrappings and one outside, under the bands which confined the  winding-sheet.         * Dr. Mahler has, with great precision, fixed the date of       the accession of Thutmosis III, as the 20th of March, 1503,       and that of his death as the 14th of February, 1449 b.c. I       do not think that the data furnished to Dr. Mahler by       Brugsch will admit of such exact conclusions being drawn       from them, and I should fix the fifty-four years of the       reign of Thutmosis III. in a less decided manner, between       1550 and 1490 b.c., allowing, as I have said before, for an       error of half a century more or less in the dates which go       back to the time of the second Theban empire.    [Illustration: 041.jpg HEAD OF THE MUMMY OF THUTMOSIS III.]         Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph lent by M. Grebaut,       taken by Emil Brugsch-Bey.    Happily the face, which had been plastered over with pitch at the time  of embalming, did not suffer at all from this rough treatment, and  appeared intact when the protecting mask was removed. Its appearance  does not answer to our ideal of the conqueror. His statues, though  not representing him as a type of manly beauty, yet give him refined,  intelligent features, but a comparison with the mummy shows that the  artists have idealised their model. The forehead is abnormally low, the  eyes deeply sunk, the jaw heavy, the lips thick, and the cheek-bones  extremely prominent; the whole recalling the physiognomy of Thutmosis  II., though with a greater show of energy. Thutmosis III. is a fellah of  the old stock, squat, thickset, vulgar in character and expression, but  not lacking in firmness and vigour.* Amenothes II., who succeeded him,  must have closely resembled him, if we may trust his official portraits.  He was the son of a princess of the blood, Hatshopsitu II., daughter of  the great Hatshopsitu,** and consequently he came into his inheritance  with stronger claims to it than any other Pharaoh since the time of  Amenothes I. Possibly his father may have associated him with himself on  the throne as soon as the young prince attained his majority;*** at any  rate, his accession aroused no appreciable opposition in the country,  and if any difficulties were made, they must have come from outside.         * The restored remains allow us to estimate the height at       about 5 ft. 3 in.         ** His parentage is proved by the pictures preserved in the       tomb of his foster-father, where he is represented in       company with the _royal mother_, Maritri. Hatshopsitu.         *** It is thus that Wiedemann explains his presence by the       side of Thutmosis III. on certain bas-reliefs in the temple       of Amada.    It is always a dangerous moment in the existence of a newly formed  empire when its founder having passed away, and the conquered people  not having yet become accustomed to a subject condition, they are called  upon to submit to a successor of whom they know little or nothing. It  is always problematical whether the new sovereign will display as great  activity and be as successful as the old one; whether he will be capable  of turning to good account the armies which his predecessor commanded  with such skill, and led so bravely against the enemy; whether, again,  he will have sufficient tact to estimate correctly the burden of  taxation which each province is capable of bearing, and to lighten it  when there is a risk of its becoming too heavy. If he does not show from  the first that it is his purpose to"]]]
