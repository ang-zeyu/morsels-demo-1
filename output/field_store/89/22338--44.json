[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18134"],[0,"Sixteen Months in Four German Prisons: Wesel, Sennelager, Klingelputz, Ruhleben (#7)"],[1," a gaping wound in the  soldier's face, extending from his temple to his chin. The blood spurted  out. The wounded man saluted, and requested the officer to permit him to  drop out to have his wound dressed. But the officer curtly refused, and  so the unfortunate soldier was compelled to walk, or rather to stumble,  beside me, the blood pouring from his lacerated face.    As we turned into the square immediately facing the entrance to the  prison I blanched. The mob which had gathered here was so dense, and was  lashed to such a high pitch of vicious fury, that I felt convinced we  should have to succumb to overwhelming numbers. The air was thick with  missiles, and the soldiers suffered severely, although we three  prisoners were not often struck. The soldiers tolerated the fusillade  with the best grace they could command for some time, but even their  endurance had its limits, and at last they turned. But the crowd was by  no means daunted. By hook or by crook they intended to prevent us  reaching the prison, and, they having closed behind us, we were  completely hemmed in.    \"Our last chance! Give them to us! English spies! Seize them, comrades!  Lynch them! Lynch them!\" were the coarse cries which rang out without  ceasing.    It was a thrilling and critical moment. The mass of screaming men and  women was now so dense that we could not move. The soldiers could no  longer even swing their rifles. The outstretched hands of the mob were  snapping and tearing within an inch or two of my coat. Had I swayed a  trifle they must have grasped me.    A shrill whistle rang out. The prison door was flung open and a number  of soldiers came out at the double with arms lowered, while the officers  were waving their swords. The crowd around the entrance fell back, and  the next moment a passage was being cleaved through the mass of raving  humanity. This sudden appearance of extra force created a diversion of  which our escort took advantage. We slipped through the gap which had  been cut in the crowd, and the next moment were in the prison. As the  gate closed with a resounding bang I gave a sigh of relief. We were safe  from mob violence whatever other fate might be in store for us.  Personally, although I passed through many exciting experiences  subsequently, and was often a victim of Prussian brutality, I regard  that march from the station to the prison at Wesel as the most dangerous  few minutes which I have ever encountered.    We were promptly taken into an office and subjected to another  inquisition. The questions were merely repetitions of those I had  already answered half-a-dozen times previously. Then I was submitted to  my second search. I was ordered to throw my hands above my head, a  bayonet point being held at my stomach to enforce the command. Searchers  went adroitly through my pockets, taking everything which they  contained. These included a batch of letters which I had received just  before starting from home, and which I had thrust into my pocket to read  at leisure during the journey.    These letters provoked a considerable amount of whispering,  head-shaking, wise smiles, and significant noddings. No one could read a  word of English--but that was immaterial. In the wisdom of their conceit  these inquisitors considered the communications to be fully  incriminating, and the frequent recurrence of the word \"Russia\" in the  letters convinced them that my guilt was now fully and truly established  beyond a shadow of a doubt. The various articles were carefully wrapped  up and tied with blue ribbon. Knowing the significance of red-tape at  home, I concluded that this was the Prussian analogue of our official  preference. Afterwards, however, I was told that \"blue\" ribbon was  employed for a specific purpose--the sealing of articles and goods  belonging to one arrested on the charge of espionage. How far this is  true I do not know, but I did observe that in every instance blue ribbon  was employed to secure the parcels belonging to spies.    My two cameras were regarded with reverent awe. As they were being  examined I urged them to be careful. I suggested that they should allow  me to develop the films, but this proposal was regarded with  consternation and emphatic negative head-shakings. The authorities would  see to that.    Suddenly there was intense excitement. One of the searchers had drawn a  watch-like contrivance from my waistcoat pocket. It was not a watch,  because it had no dial or works, but something which was quite foreign  to them. First they dropped it as if fearing it might explode. Then  finding that the fall brought about no ill-effects they approached it  warily, picked it up gingerly, and held it to their ears. It did not  tick. Then they shook it, banged it on the desk, studied it closely with  a wise, old-owlish look, and at last, shaking their heads quizzically,  consigned it to wrapping paper and sealed it with the blue ribbon.    Despite my serious predicament I could not refrain from indulging in an  outburst of laughter which only served to annoy them still further. The  mystery was not a new type of infernal machine as they imagined but  merely a home-made actinometer! It was contrived from an old cheap  watch-case, while the strange contents were merely strips of paper which  had been soaked in a solution of potassium bichromate!    These preliminaries completed, my two companions and I were paraded  before another pompous official who, like the majority of his ilk, was  smothered with decorations. Drawing himself to his full height he fired  a tirade at us for several minutes without taking the slightest pause  for breath. What it was all about I do not know. He spoke so rapidly,  and so in the style of a gramophone, that I came to the conclusion he  was in the habit of holding forth in this strain at intervals of every  few minutes. But his manner was so menacing as to lead me to apprehend  that no feelings of affection or hospitality were to be extended towards  us.    His speech completed, he shouted an order. Soldiers hurried in, and at  the word of command they commenced to load their rifles. I was quite at  a loss to understand this action, but my heart thumped and a queer,  indescribable feeling came over me. I felt sick and faint, especially  when I saw the men, upon completing loading, form up in two lines. Like  a flash it dawned upon me that according to German military form I had  been found guilty of the charge levelled against me, and that the  harangue of the pompous individual was no more or less than the  promulgation of my death sentence! For what else could these men have  loaded their rifles so ostentatiously? And why were there so many  soldiers? Their numbers plainly indicated the firing party.    My eyes grew dim with tears in spite of myself. Visions of my wife and  family at home, waiting and momentarily expecting \"Daddy,\" who had  notified them of his return, flitted through my brain. A lump rose in my  throat and for the first time I was within an ace of breaking-down. But  smothering my thoughts, I pulled myself together. Assuming a bravado I  was far from feeling, I demanded to see the Commandant. To my surprise  the request was granted. This functionary was seated at his desk in a  corner of the room, and I was escorted to him. Seeing me he curtly  demanded what I wanted.    \"Can I write to my wife?\"    The officer who accompanied me explained the situation, and although I  did not understand what transpired I caught the words \"Englische Spion!\"  The Commandant glared at me.    \"Where is she?\" he roared.    \"In England!\"    \"England!\" and the word, full of venom and hate, burst out like the cork  from a pop-gun. \"Nein! Certainly not! It is impossible! Get out!\"    Assisted by a vigorous prod I was brought alongside my two companions.    The soldiers lined up to march. My head was swimming, but all thoughts  of my own plight were dispelled by an incident which was as unexpected  as it was sudden. At the command \"March\" one of the two Indian students,  positive that he was now going to his doom, staggered. I caught him as  he fell. He dropped limply to the ground, half-dead with fright, and  with his face a sickly green.    \"Are we going to be shot? Are we going to be shot?\" he wailed  agonisedly.    He clutched the sleeve of a soldier, who, looking down and evidently  understanding English, motioned negatively. Then he added as an  afterthought, \"Not now!\"    While his negative head-shake revived my drooping spirits, his words  afterwards sent them to zero once more. I hardly knew whether to feel  relieved or otherwise. It would have been far better had the soldier  curbed his tongue, because his final words kept us on the rack of  suspense.    We were hustled out of the room. As we passed out I glanced at the  clock. It was just nine o'clock--Tuesday morning, August 4. I shall  never forget the day nor the hour. Like sheep we were driven and rushed  downstairs, the guards assisting our faltering steps with sundry rifle  prods and knocks. We tramped corridors, which seemed to be interminable,  and at last came to a ponderous iron gate. Here we were halted, and the  military guard handed us over to the gaolers. We passed through the  gates, which closed with a soul-smashing, reverberating bang.    Over the top of this gate I had noticed one of those mottoes to which  the German is so partial. I do not recall the actual words, but I was  told that it was something to do with crime and punishment. It would  have been far more appropriate had it been inscribed \"Main entrance to  Hell. No pass-out checks!\" According to many accounts which reached my  ears during the succeeding few days, many entered those gates, but few  passed out alive. I can substantiate this from my own observations,  which are duly narrated, while my experience was sufficient to vouch for  its similarity to Hades.    This gate gave approach to a long corridor,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18157"],[0,"Fundación de la ciudad de Buenos-Aires (#7)"],[1," otra parte con cuadra y solares de la           barranca de Mateo Sanchez, y tierra adentro, con cuadra           de Bartolomé Frutos.                                 1         4.
