In the Sixteenth Century, however, people took the  sackcloth from the saints and dressed them in flesh. Then was produced a  kind of revival of paganism, of naturalism, of life; and religious art,  in its flesh and colouring, no longer created anything but an Olympus of  beautiful maidens, or, at least, noble goddesses. Correggio's Magdalen  belongs to this artistic cycle and the painter executed it in the  noonday splendour of those qualities, the dawn of which glows in Parma  at St. Paul's. Correggio is not a mystic, he is a voluptuous naturalist,  and from him to the realist Caravaggio, \"the grinder of flesh,\" and the  exuberant Rubens, who gave much study to Correggio, the distance is not  very great and the decline is fatal. But, in the meantime, where shall  we find more grace, or seductiveness--under this conversion complicated  with memories--than in Correggio's Magdalen?    In hagiographal literature we find a work of similar tone and charm:  _Marie Madeleine_, by P. Lacordaire, an exquisite little book written  with tenderness and piety, which deliciously calls up before us the  Magdalen of repentance and love, \"the loving woman accustomed to the  delights of contemplation and needing only to see in her heart him whom  in other days she saw under the transparent veil of mortal flesh.\"    It must be confessed that Correggio was constantly preoccupied with  _charm_ and with that skilful coquetry that sports with every grace.  This is a subtlety of purely personal qualities; but let others beware  of a systematic affectation! In this way Correggio did not found a  school, but he had imitators, among whom was Parmigiano, who by dint of  study and in search for grace--the most natural thing in the world--most  often fell into affected and conventional ways.

BANQUET OF THE ARQUEBUSIERS    _(VAN DER HELST)_    WILLIAM MAKEPEACE THACKERAY      The _Night-Watch_ at Amsterdam is magnificent in parts, but on the side  to the spectator's right, smoky and dim. The _Five Masters of the  Drapers_ is wonderful for depth, strength, brightness, massive power.  What words are these to express a picture! to describe a description! I  once saw a moon riding in the sky serenely, attended by her sparkling  maids of honour, and a little lady said, with an air of great  satisfaction, \"_I must sketch it_.\" Ah, my dear lady, if with an H.B., a  Bristol board, and a bit of india-rubber, you can sketch the firmament  on high, and the moon in her glory, I make you my compliment! I can't  sketch _The Five Drapers_ with any ink or pen at present at command--but  can look with all my eyes, and be thankful to have seen such a  masterpiece.    They say he was a moody, ill-conditioned man, the old tenant of the  mill. What does he think of the \"Van der Helst\" which hangs opposite his  _Night-Watch_, and which is one of the great pictures of the world? It  is not painted by so great a man as Rembrandt; but there it is--to see  it is an event of your life. Having beheld it you have lived in the  year 1648, and celebrated the Treaty of Muenster. You have shaken the  hands of the Dutch Guardsmen, eaten from their platters, drunk their  Rhenish, heard their jokes, as they wagged their jolly beards. The  Amsterdam Catalogue discourses thus about it:--a model catalogue: it  gives you the prices paid, the signatures of the painters, a succinct  description of the work.    \"This masterpiece represents a banquet of the Civic Guard, which took  place on the 18th of June, 1648, in the great hall of the St. Joris  Doele, on the Singel at Amsterdam, to celebrate the conclusion of the  Peace at Muenster. The thirty-five figures composing the picture are all  portraits.    \"'The Captain Witse' is placed at the head of the table, and attracts  our attention first. He is dressed in black velvet, his breast covered  with a cuirass, on his head a broad-brimmed black hat with white plumes.  He is comfortably seated on a chair of black oak, with a velvet cushion,  and holds in his left hand, supported on his knee, a magnificent  drinking-horn, surrounded by a St. George destroying the dragon, and  ornamented with olive-leaves. The captain's features express cordiality  and good-humour; he is grasping the hand of 'Lieutenant Van Wavern'  seated near him in a habit of dark grey, with lace and buttons of gold,  lace-collar and wrist-bands, his feet crossed, with boots of yellow  leather, with large tops, and gold spurs, on his head a black hat and  dark-brown plumes. Behind him, at the centre of the picture, is the  standard-bearer, 'Jacob Banning,' in an easy martial attitude, hat in  hand, his right hand on his chair, his right leg on his left knee. He  holds the flag of blue silk, in which the Virgin is embroidered\" (such a  silk! such a flag! such a piece of painting!), \"emblematic of the town  of Amsterdam. The banner covers his shoulder, and he looks towards the  spectator frankly and complacently.    [Illustration: THE BANQUET OF THE ARQUEBUSIERS.          _Van der Helst._]    \"The man behind him is probably one of the sergeants. His head is bare.  He wears a cuirass, and yellow gloves, grey stockings, and boots with  large tops, and knee-caps of cloth. He has a napkin on his knees, and in  his hand a piece of ham, a slice of bread and a knife. The old man  behind is probably 'William the Drummer.' He has his hat in his right  hand, and in his left a gold-footed wineglass, filled with white wine.  He wears a red scarf, and a black satin doublet, with little slashes of  yellow silk. Behind the drummer, two matchlock-men are seated at the end  of the table. One in a large black habit, a napkin on his knee, a  _hausse-col_ of iron, and a linen scarf and collar. He is eating with  his knife. The other holds a long glass of white wine. Four musketeers,  with different shaped hats, are behind these, one holding a glass, the  three others with their guns on their shoulders. Other guests are placed  between the personage who is giving the toast and the standard-bearer.  One with his hat off, and his hand uplifted, is talking to another. The  second is carving a fowl. A third holds a silver plate; and another, in  the background, a silver flagon, from which he fills a cup. The corner  behind the captain is filled by two seated personages, one of whom is  peeling an orange. Two others are standing, armed with halberts, of whom  one holds a plumed hat. Behind him are other three individuals, one of  them holding a pewter pot on which the name 'Poock,' the landlord of the  'Hotel Doele,' is engraved. At the back, a maid-servant is coming in  with a pasty, crowned with a turkey. Most of the guests are listening to  the captain. From an open window in the distance, the facades of two  houses are seen, surmounted by stone figures of sheep.\"    There, now you know all about it: now you can go home and paint just  such another. If you do, do pray remember to paint the hands of the  figures as they are here depicted; they are as wonderful portraits as  the faces. None of your slim Van Dyck elegancies, which have done duty  at the cuffs of so many doublets; but each man with a hand for himself,  as with a face for himself. I blushed for the coarseness of one of the  chiefs in this great company, that fellow behind \"William the Drummer,\"  splendidly attired, sitting full in the face of the public; and holding  a pork-bone in his hand. Suppose the _Saturday Review_ critic were to  come suddenly on this picture? Ah! what a shock it would give that noble  nature! Why is that knuckle of pork not painted out? at any rate, why is  not a little fringe of lace painted round it? or a cut pink paper? or  couldn't a smelling-bottle be painted in instead, with a crest and a  gold top, or a cambric pocket-handkerchief in lieu of the horrid pig,  with a pink coronet in the corner? or suppose you covered the man's hand  (which is very coarse and strong), and gave him the decency of a kid  glove? But a piece of pork in a naked hand? O nerves and eau de Cologne,  hide it, hide it!    In spite of this lamentable coarseness, my noble sergeant, give me thy  hand as nature made it! A great, and famous, and noble handiwork I have  seen here. Not the greatest picture in the world--not a work of the  highest genius--but a performance so great, various, and admirable, so  shrewd of humour, so wise of observation, so honest and complete of  expression, that to have seen it has been a delight, and to remember it  will be a pleasure for days to come. Well done, Bartholomeus Van der  Helst! Brave, meritorious, victorious, happy Bartholomew, to whom it has  been given to produce a masterpiece!    ... Was it a dream? It seems like one. Have we been to Holland? Have we  heard the chimes at midnight at Antwerp? Were we really away for a week,  or have I been sitting up in the room dozing, before this stale old  desk? Here's the desk; yes. But if it has been a dream, how could I have  learned to hum that tune out of _Dinorah?_ Ah, is it that tune, or  myself that I am humming? If it was a dream how comes this yellow NOTICE  DES TABLEAUX DU MUSEE D'AMSTERDAM AVEC FASCIMILE DES MONOGRAMMES before  me, and this signature of the gallant      Bartholomeus van der Helst fecit A; 1648.    Yes, indeed, it was a delightful little holiday; it lasted a whole  week.        _Roundabout Papers_ (London, 1863).          L'EMBARQUEMENT POUR L'ILE DE CYTHERE    (_WATTEAU_)    EDMOND AND JULES DE GONCOURT      Watteau is the great poet of the Eighteenth Century. A creation, a whole  creation of poetry and dreams, emanated from his brain and filled his  work with the elegance of a supernatural life. From the fantasies of his  brain, from the caprice of his art, from his perfectly original genius, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17487"],[0,"Casa Grande Ruin (#7)"],[1,"later, supports the hypothesis that none of  the rooms except the middle one were ever more than two stories high and  that the wall remains above the second roof level represent a low  parapet.    [Illustration: Pl. LVIII: Square Opening in South Room.]    In the second story, or middle room of the middle tier, there were no  openings except the doorway in the eastern wall and two small orifices  in the western wall. In the middle of this wall there is a niche about  18 inches below the roof, and a foot below this is a round-cornered  opening measuring about 7 by 8 inches extending through the wall. This  opening was on a level with another in the western wall of the western  room, and commanded a far-reaching though contracted view toward the  west. Below and a little northward is a similar though somewhat larger  opening corresponding to an opening in the western wall of the western  room.    [Illustration: Fig. 330.--Elevations of walls, middle room.]    The upper doorway in the western wall of the western room is much broken  out, but the top can still be traced. It was 4 feet 51/2 inches in height  and 1 foot 11 inches wide at top. The opening was blocked by solid  masonry built into it and completely filling it up to within 10 inches  of the top. This upper space, which is on a level with the upper hole in  the middle room, seems to have been purposely left to allow an outlook  from that room. The filling block is level on top and flush with the  wall inside and out. At a height of 12 inches above the lower edge of  the floor beams below it, and perhaps 3 inches above the floor, is the  lower edge of a roughly square opening a foot across, cut out from the  block itself and inclined slightly downward toward the exterior. It was  plastered and smoothly finished. This opening corresponds to the one in  the middle room already described. This filling block, with the orifice  under discussion, is shown in figure 330, and in detail in plate LVII.    The lower doorway, shown in figure 330, is much broken out, and although  now but 2 feet 11/2 inches wide at its narrowest part, no trace of the  original surface remains on the northern side. The opening was 4 feet 61/2  inches high and probably less than 2 feet wide, with vertical sides.    In the western wall of the southern room there was but one opening. This  is about 9 inches square, finished smoothly, and occurs in the upper  room, about 6 feet 5 inches above the floor. It is shown in plate LVIII.  The doorway between this room and the western room was smoothly finished  and is in good order except the top, which is entirely gone. It was  covered with double lintels made of poles 2 to 4 inches in diameter, the  lower series about 3 inches above the top of the door. The opening was  originally filled in like that described above, leaving only 8 or 10  inches of the upper part open. The lower part of the block was pierced  by a square hole, like that in the western room, but this has weathered  or been broken out and the block has slipped down, so that now its top  is 1 foot 51/2 inches below what was formerly the top of the opening. The  top of the filling block is still smooth and finished and shows across  its entire width a series of prints probably of flat sticks about an  inch and a half wide, though, possibly these are marks of some finishing  tool. The marks run north and south.    The opening below the one just described was so much filled up at the  time of examination that none of its features could be determined,  except that it was bridged by two tiers of sticks of the usual size as  lintels. The subsequent excavation before referred to, however,  apparently disclosed an opening similar to the one described, and, like  it, filled nearly to the top with a large block.    A little west of the middle of the northern wall there are three niches,  arranged side by side and about 61/2 feet above the first roof beams. The  niches are 10 inches high, a foot wide, and about a foot deep, and are  about 8 inches apart. They are smoothly finished and plastered, but were  roughly made.    The eastern opening in the northern wall, opening into the east room, is  well preserved except the top, which is missing. It measured 4 feet 21/2  inches in height and 1 foot 11 inches wide at the bottom, the top being  nearly an inch narrower. It carried two tiers of lintels of medium size.    The gap in the southern wall of the southern room, shown in the plan,  though now open from the ground up, represents the location of two  doorways, one above the other. Remains of both of these can still be  seen on the ends of the walls. No measurements can be obtained. The  large fallen block near the southwestern corner of the room, which  undoubtedly slipped down from above, shows a finished surface at the  ground level inside, but above it no trace of an opening can be seen,  possibly because the ends of the walls above are much eroded.    [Illustration: Pl. LIX: Remains of Lintels.]    The upper opening in the eastern wall of the eastern room was apparently  capped with a single lintel composed of five sticks 4 to 6 inches in  diameter laid level on the top of a course of masonry. The bottom of the  opening is filled either with washed-down material or with the remains  of a block such as that previously described. This opening is the most  irregular one in the building, the top being nearly 4 inches narrower  than the bottom, but the northern side of the opening is vertical, the  southern side only being inclined inward. The opening was 4 feet 11  inches high and 1 foot 81/2 inches wide at the bottom. The opening  immediately below that described, which was the ground floor entrance  from the east, is so much broken out that no evidence remains of its  size and character. There appears to have been only one row of lintel  poles.    The eastern opening in the southern wall of the northern room is well  preserved, the lintels having been torn out by relic hunters without  much destruction of the surrounding masonry. It was neatly finished, and  its bottom, was probably a little above the first roof level. The edges  of the openings were made straight with flat sticks, either used as  implements or incorporated into the structure, and forming almost  perfectly straight edges. Marks of the same method of construction or  finish are apparent in all the other openings, but the remains are not  so well preserved as in this instance. Possibly the immediate lintels of  openings were formed of thin flat sticks, as the lintel poles are often  some inches above the top of the opening. In this opening the supporting  lintel was formed of a number of poles 2 to 4 inches in diameter,  irregularly placed, sometimes two or three in vertical series with very  little filling between them. This construction has been characterized as  a Norman arch. The opening was originally 1 foot 11 inches at the top  and 4 feet 6 inches high. The bottom is 11/2 inches wider than the top.    The upper opening in the western end of the southern wall is much like  that just described. A small fragment of masonry above the lintel  remains, and this is within a quarter of an inch of the top of the  opening. Above the opening there was a series of rough lintel poles, 3  to 5 inches in diameter, arranged in three tiers with 4 to 6 inches of  filling between them. Prints of these sticks are left in the wall and  show that some of them were quite crooked. Probably they were of  mesquite, obtained from the immediate vicinity. The edges of the  openings were finished with flat sticks, like those described, and its  bottom was 6 inches to a foot above the floor. The height of the opening  was 4 feet 3 inches and its width at the top 2 feet, at the bottom 2  feet 11/2 inches.    The opening immediately below the last described is filled with debris  to the level of the lintel. Above this, however, there is a series of  three tiers of sticks with 6 to 8 inches of masonry between them  vertically, sometimes laid side by side, sometimes separated by a foot  of masonry. Some of these lintel poles, as well as those of the opening  above it, extend 3 feet into the wall, others only a few inches. The  lower sides or bottoms of the holes are washed with pink clay, the same  material used for surfacing the interior walls. Perhaps this was merely  the wetting used to make succeeding courses of clay stick better. This  opening is shown in plate LIX.    Near the middle of the northern wall there are two openings, one above  the other. The upper opening was finished in the same manner as those  already described. But two tiers of poles show above it, though the top  is well preserved, and another tier may be buried in the wall. There are  indications that the opening was closed by a block about 2 feet thick  and flush with the outside. The height of the opening was 4 feet 5  inches, width at top 1 foot 41/2 inches, and at the bottom 1 foot 10  inches. It narrows a little from north to south.    The lower opening is so much broken out that little remains to show its  character. There is a suggestion that the opening was only 2 feet high,  and there were probably three tiers of lintels above the opening, the  top of which was 21/2 feet below the roof beams, but the evidence is not  so clear as in the other instances.    In the middle of the western wall, at a height of 5 feet 8 inches above  the first roof level, there is a large, roughly circular opening or  window, 14 inches in diameter. This is shown in plate LX. It is smoothly  finished, and enlarges, slightly, outward.          CONCLUSIONS.      As before stated, any conclusions drawn from a study of the Casa Grande  itself, and not checked by examination of other similar or analogous  ruins, can not be considered as firmly established, yet they have a  suggestive value.    From the character of the remains it seems probable that the site of the  ruins here designated "]]]
