While I lay musing on my  pillow, I heard the sound of little feet pattering outside of the door,  and a whispering consultation. Presently a choir of small voices chanted  forth an old Christmas carol, the burden of which was,              Rejoice, our Saviour he was born            On Christmas Day in the morning.    [Illustration]    I rose softly, slipped on my clothes, opened the door suddenly, and  beheld one of the most beautiful little fairy groups that a painter  could imagine. It consisted of a boy and two girls, the eldest not more  than six, and lovely as seraphs. They were going the rounds of the  house, and singing at every chamber-door; but my sudden appearance  frightened them into mute bashfulness. They remained for a moment  playing on their lips with their fingers, and now and then stealing a  shy glance, from under their eyebrows, until, as if by one impulse, they  scampered away, and as they turned an angle of the gallery, I heard them  laughing in triumph at their escape.    [Illustration]    Everything conspired to produce kind and happy feelings in this  stronghold of old-fashioned hospitality. The window of my chamber looked  out upon what in summer would have been a beautiful landscape. There was  a sloping lawn, a fine stream winding at the foot of it, and a tract of  park beyond, with noble clumps of trees, and herds of deer. At a  distance was a neat hamlet, with the smoke from the cottage chimneys  hanging over it; and a church with its dark spire in strong relief  against the clear cold sky. The house was surrounded with evergreens,  according to the English custom, which would have given almost an  appearance of summer; but the morning was extremely frosty; the light  vapour of the preceding evening had been precipitated by the cold, and  covered all the trees and every blade of grass with its fine  crystallisations. The rays of a bright morning sun had a dazzling effect  among the glittering foliage. A robin, perched upon the top of a  mountain-ash that hung its clusters of red berries just before my  window, was basking himself in the sunshine, and piping a few querulous  notes; and a peacock was displaying all the glories of his train, and  strutting with the pride and gravity of a Spanish grandee on the  terrace-walk below.    [Illustration]    I had scarcely dressed myself, when a servant appeared to invite me to  family prayers. He showed me the way to a small chapel in the old wing  of the house, where I found the principal part of the family already  assembled in a kind of gallery, furnished with cushions, hassocks, and  large prayer-books; the servants were seated on benches below. The old  gentleman read prayers from a desk in front of the gallery, and Master  Simon acted as clerk, and made the responses; and I must do him the  justice to say that he acquitted himself with great gravity and decorum.    The service was followed by a Christmas carol, which Mr. Bracebridge  himself had constructed from a poem of his favourite author, Herrick;  and it had been adapted to an old church melody by Master Simon. As  there were several good voices among the household, the effect was  extremely pleasing; but I was particularly gratified by the exaltation  of heart, and sudden sally of grateful feeling, with which the worthy  Squire delivered one stanza: his eyes glistening, and his voice rambling  out of all the bounds of time and tune:              \"'Tis Thou that crown'st my glittering hearth                With guiltlesse mirth,              And giv'st me wassaile bowles to drink,                Spiced to the brink:              Lord, 'tis Thy plenty-dropping hand                That soiles my land;              And giv'st me for my bushell sowne,                Twice ten for one.\"    I afterwards understood that early morning service was read on every  Sunday and saint's day throughout the year, either by Mr. Bracebridge or  by some member of the family. It was once almost universally the case at  the seats of the nobility and gentry of England, and it is much to be  regretted that the custom is fallen into neglect; for the dullest  observer must be sensible of the order and serenity prevalent in those  households, where the occasional exercise of a beautiful form of worship  in the morning gives, as it were, the key-note to every temper for the  day, and attunes every spirit to harmony.    Our breakfast consisted of what the Squire denominated true old English  fare. He indulged in some bitter lamentations over modern breakfasts of  tea-and-toast, which he censured as among the causes of modern  effeminacy and weak nerves, and the decline of old English heartiness;  and though he admitted them to his table to suit the palates of his  guests, yet there was a brave display of cold meats, wine and ale, on  the sideboard.    [Illustration]    After breakfast I walked about the grounds with Frank Bracebridge and  Master Simon, or Mr. Simon, as he was called by everybody but the  Squire. We were escorted by a number of gentlemen-like dogs, that seemed  loungers about the establishment; from the frisking spaniel to the  steady old stag-hound; the last of which was of a race that had been in  the family time out of mind: they were all obedient to a dog-whistle  which hung to Master Simon's button-hole, and in the midst of their  gambols would glance an eye occasionally upon a small switch he carried  in his hand.    [Illustration]    The old mansion had a still more venerable look in the yellow sunshine  than by pale moonlight; and I could not but feel the force of the  Squire's idea, that the formal terraces, heavily moulded balustrades,  and clipped yew-trees, carried with them an air of proud aristocracy.  There appeared to be an unusual number of peacocks about the place, and  I was making some remarks upon what I termed a flock of them, that were  basking under a sunny wall, when I was gently corrected in my  phraseology by Master Simon, who told me that, according to the most  ancient and approved treatise on hunting, I must say a _muster_ of  peacocks. \"In the same way,\" added he, with a slight air of pedantry,  \"we say a flight of doves or swallows, a bevy of quails, a herd of deer,  of wrens, or cranes, a skulk of foxes, or a building of rooks.\" He went  on to inform me that, according to Sir Anthony Fitzherbert, we ought to  ascribe to this bird \"both understanding and glory; for being praised,  he will presently set up his tail chiefly against the sun, to the  intent you may the better behold the beauty thereof. But at the fall of  the leaf, when his tail falleth, he will mourn and hide himself in  corners, till his tail come again as it was.\"    I could not help smiling at this display of small erudition on so  whimsical a subject; but I found that the peacocks were birds of some  consequence at the hall, for Frank Bracebridge informed me that they  were great favourites with his father, who was extremely careful to keep  up the breed; partly because they belonged to chivalry, and were in  great request at the stately banquets of the olden time; and partly  because they had a pomp and magnificence about them, highly becoming an  old family mansion. Nothing, he was accustomed to say, had an air of  greater state and dignity than a peacock perched upon an antique stone  balustrade.    [Illustration]    Master Simon had now to hurry off, having an appointment at the parish  church with the village choristers, who were to perform some music of  his selection. There was something extremely agreeable in the cheerful  flow of animal spirits of the little man; and I confess I had been  somewhat surprised at his apt quotations from authors who certainly were  not in the range of every-day reading. I mentioned this last  circumstance to Frank Bracebridge, who told me with a smile that Master  Simon's whole stock of erudition was confined to some half-a-dozen old  authors, which the Squire had put into his hands, and which he read over  and over, whenever he had a studious fit; as he sometimes had on a rainy  day, or a long winter evening. Sir Anthony Fitzherbert's Book of  Husbandry; Markham's Country Contentments; the Tretyse of Hunting, by  Sir Thomas Cockayne, Knight; Izaak Walton's Angler, and two or three  more such ancient worthies of the pen, were his standard authorities;  and, like all men who know but a few books, he looked up to them with a  kind of idolatry, and quoted them on all occasions. As to his songs,  they were chiefly picked out of old books in the Squire's library, and  adapted to tunes that were popular among the choice spirits of the last  century. His practical application of scraps of literature, however, had  caused him to be looked upon as a prodigy of book-knowledge by all the  grooms, huntsmen, and small sportsmen of the neighbourhood.    While we were talking we heard the distant toll of the village bell, and  I was told that the Squire was a little particular in having his  household at church on a Christmas morning; considering it a day of  pouring out of thanks and rejoicing; for, as old Tusser observed,              \"At Christmas be merry, _and thankful withal_,             And feast thy poor neighbours, the great and the small.\"    \"If you are disposed to go to church,\" said Frank Bracebridge, \"I can  promise you a specimen of my cousin Simon's musical achievements. As the  church is destitute of an organ, he has formed a band from the village  amateurs, and established a musical club for their improvement; he has  also sorted a choir, as he sorted my father's pack of hounds, according  to the directions of Jervaise Markham, in his Country Contentments; for  the bass he has sought out all the 'deep, solemn mouths,' and for the  tenor the 'loud ringing mouths,' among the country bumpkins; and for  'sweet mouths,' he has culled with curious taste among the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2066"],[0,"Wildfire (#7)"],[1,"down the river road. Riding down and up was merely  work, and a horse has as little liking for it as she had. Usually it  was a hot, dusty trip, and the great, dark, overhanging walls had a  depressing effect, upon her. She always felt awe at the gloomy canyon  and fear at the strange, murmuring red river. But she started down this  afternoon in the hope of meeting Joel. She had a hazy idea of telling  him she was sorry for what she had done, and of asking him to forget it  and pay no more heed to the riders.    The sheep raised a dust-cloud in the sandy wash where the road wound  down, and Lucy hung back to let them get farther ahead. Gradually the  tiny roar of pattering hoofs and the blended bleating and baaing died  away. The dust-cloud, however, hung over the head of the ravine, and  Lucy had to force Sarchedon through it. Sarchedon did not mind sand and  dust, but he surely hated the smell of sheep. Lucy seldom put a spur to  Sarchedon; still, she gave him a lash with her quirt, and then he went  on obediently, if disgustedly. He carried his head like a horse that  wondered why his mistress preferred to drive him down into an  unpleasant hole when she might have been cutting the sweet, cool sage  wind up on the slope.    The wash, with its sand and clay walls, dropped into a gulch, and there  was an end of green growths. The road led down over solid rock.  Gradually the rims of the gorge rose, shutting out the light and the  cliffs. It was a winding road and one not safe to tarry on in a stormy  season. Lucy had seen boulders weighing a ton go booming down that  gorge during one of the sudden fierce desert storms, when a torrent of  water and mud and stone went plunging on to the river. The ride through  here was short, though slow. Lucy always had time to adjust her  faculties for the overpowering contrast these lower regions presented.  Long before she reached the end of the gorge she heard the sullen  thunder of the river. The river was low, too, for otherwise there would  have been a deafening roar.    Presently she came out upon a lower branch of the canyon, into a great  red-walled space, with the river still a thousand feet below, and the  cliffs towering as high above her. The road led down along this rim  where to the left all was open, across to the split and peaked wall  opposite. The river appeared to sweep round a bold, bulging corner a  mile above. It was a wide, swift, muddy, turbulent stream. A great bar  of sand stretched out from the shore. Beyond it, through the mouth of  an intersecting canyon, could be seen a clump of cottonwoods and  willows that marked the home of the Creeches. Lucy could not see the  shore nearest her, as it was almost directly under her. Besides, in  this narrow road, on a spirited horse, she was not inclined to watch  the scenery. She hurried Sarchedon down and down, under the overhanging  brows of rock, to where the rim sloped out and failed. Here was a  half-acre of sand, with a few scant willows, set down seemingly in a  dent at the base of the giant, beetling cliffs. The place was light,  though the light seemed a kind of veiled red, and to Lucy always  ghastly. She could not have been joyous with that river moaning before  her, even if it had been up on a level, in the clear and open day. As a  little girl eight years old she had conceived a terror and hatred of  this huge, jagged rent so full of red haze and purple smoke and the  thunder of rushing waters. And she had never wholly outgrown it. The  joy of the sun and wind, the rapture in the boundless open, the  sweetness in the sage--these were not possible here. Something mighty  and ponderous, heavy as those colossal cliffs, weighted down her  spirit. The voice of the river drove out any dream. Here was the  incessant frowning presence of destructive forces of nature. And the  ford was associated with catastrophe--to sheep, to horses and to men.    Lucy rode across the bar to the shore where the Indians were loading  the sheep into an immense rude flatboat. As the sheep were frightened,  the loading was no easy task. Their bleating could be heard above the  roar of the river. Bostil's boatmen, Shugrue and Somers, stood  knee-deep in the quicksand of the bar, and their efforts to keep  free-footed were as strenuous as their handling of the sheep. Presently  the flock was all crowded on board, the Indians followed, and then the  boatmen slid the unwieldy craft off the sand-bar. Then, each manning a  clumsy oar, they pulled up-stream. Along shore were whirling, slow  eddies, and there rowing was possible. Out in that swift current it  would have been folly to try to contend with it, let alone make  progress. The method of crossing was to row up along the shore as far  as a great cape of rock jutting out, and there make into the current,  and while drifting down pull hard to reach the landing opposite.  Heavily laden as the boat was, the chances were not wholly in favor of  a successful crossing.    Lucy watched the slow, laborious struggle of the boatmen with the heavy  oars until she suddenly remembered the object of her visit down to the  ford. She appeared to be alone on her side of the river. At the landing  opposite, however, were two men; and presently Lucy recognized Joel  Creech and his father. A second glance showed Indians with burros,  evidently waiting for the boat. Joel Creech jumped into a skiff and  shoved off. The elder man, judging by his motions, seemed to be trying  to prevent his son from leaving the shore. But Joel began to row  up-stream, keeping close to the shore. Lucy watched him. No doubt he  had seen her and was coming across. Either the prospect of meeting him  or the idea of meeting him there in the place where she was never  herself made her want to turn at once and ride back home. But her  stubborn sense of fairness overruled that. She would hold her ground  solely in the hope of persuading Joel to be reasonable. She saw the big  flatboat sweep into line of sight at the same time Joel turned into the  current. But while the larger craft drifted slowly the other way, the  smaller one came swiftly down and across. Joel swept out of the current  into the eddy, rowed across that, and slid the skiff up on the  sand-bar. Then he stepped out. He was bareheaded and barefooted, but it  was not that which made him seem a stranger to Lucy.    \"Are you lookin' fer me?\" he shouted.    Lucy waved a hand for him to come up.    Then he approached. He was a tall, lean young man, stoop-shouldered and  bow-legged from much riding, with sallow, freckled face, a thin fuzz of  beard, weak mouth and chin, and eyes remarkable for their small size  and piercing quality and different color. For one was gray and the  other was hazel. There was no scar on his face, but the irregularity of  his features reminded one who knew that he had once been kicked in the  face by a horse.    Creech came up hurriedly, in an eager, wild way that made Lucy suddenly  pity him. He did not seem to remember that the stallion had an  antipathy for him. But Lucy, if she had forgotten, would have been  reminded by Sarchedon's action.    \"Look out, Joel!\" she called, and she gave the black's head a jerk.  Sarchedon went up with a snort and came down pounding the sand. Quick  as an Indian Lucy was out of the saddle.    \"Lemme your quirt,\" said Joel, showing his teeth like a wolf.    \"No. I wouldn't let you hit Sarch. You beat him once, and he's never  forgotten,\" replied Lucy.    The eye of the horse and the man met and clashed, and there was a  hostile tension in their attitudes. Then Lucy dropped the bridle and  drew Joel over to a huge drift-log, half buried in the sand. Here she  sat down, but Joel remained standing. His gaze was now all the stranger  for its wistfulness. Lucy was quick to catch a subtle difference in  him, but she could not tell wherein it lay.    \"What'd you want?\" asked Joel.    \"I've heard a lot of things, Joel,\" replied Lucy, trying to think of  just what she wanted to say.    \"Reckon you have,\" said Joel, dejectedly, and then he sat down on the  log and dug holes in the sand with his bare feet.    Lucy had never before seen him look tired, and it seemed that some of  the healthy brown of his cheeks had thinned out. Then Lucy told him,  guardedly, a few of the rumors she had heard.    \"All thet you say is nothin' to what's happened,\" he replied, bitterly.  \"Them riders mocked the life an' soul out of me.\"    \"But, Joel, you shouldn't be so--so touchy,\" said Lucy, earnestly.  \"After all, the joke WAS on you. Why didn't you take it like a man?\"    \"But they knew you stole my clothes,\" he protested.    \"Suppose they did. That wasn't much to care about. If you hadn't taken  it so hard they'd have let up on you.\"    \"Mebbe I might have stood that. But they taunted me with bein'--loony  about you.\"    Joel spoke huskily. There was no doubt that he had been deeply hurt.  Lucy saw tears in his eyes, and her first impulse was to put a hand on  his and tell him how sorry she was. But she desisted. She did not feel  at her ease with Joel.    \"What'd you and Van fight about?\" she asked, presently. Joel hung his  head. \"I reckon I ain't a-goin' to tell you.\"    \"You're ashamed of it?\"    Joel's silence answered that.    \"You said something about me?\" Lucy could not resist her curiosity,  back of which was a little heat. \"It must have been--bad--else Van  wouldn't have struck you.\"    \"He hit me--he knocked me flat,\" passionately said Joel.    \"And you drew a gun on him?\"    \"I did, an' like a fool I didn't wait till I got up. Then he kicked me!  ... Bostil's Ford will never be big enough fer me an' Van now.\"    \"Don't talk foolish. You won't fight with Van.... Joel, maybe you  deserved what you got. You say some--some rude things.\"    \"I only said I'd pay you back,\" burst out Joel.    \"How?\"    \"I swore I'd lay fer you--an' steal your clothes--so you'd have to run  home naked.\"    There was indeed something "]]]
