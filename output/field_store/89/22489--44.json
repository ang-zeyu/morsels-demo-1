[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20638"],[0,"From Plotzk to Boston (#7)"],[1," heard an  exclamation of, \"Oh, Esther! how do you happen to be here?\" and, on  seeing the speaker, found it to be an old friend of ours from Plotzk.  She had gone long before us, but her ship hadn't arrived yet. She was  surprised to see us because we had had no intention of going when she  went.    What a comfort it was to find a friend among all the strangers! She  showed us at once to our new quarters, and while she talked to mamma I  had time to see what they were like.    It looked something like a hospital, only less clean and comfortable;  more like the soldiers' barracks I had seen. I saw a very large room,  around whose walls were ranged rows of high iron double bedsteads, with  coarse sacks stuffed with something like matting, and not over-clean  blankets for the only bedding, except where people used their own. There  were three windows almost touching the roof, with nails covering all the  framework. From the ceiling hung two round gas lamps, and almost under  them stood a little wooden table and a settee. The floor was of stone.    Here was a pleasant prospect. We had no idea how long this unattractive  place might be our home.    Our friend explained that Number Five was only for Jewish women and  girls, and the beds were sleeping rooms, dining rooms, parlors, and  everything else, kitchens excepted. It seemed so, for some were lounging  on the beds, some sitting up, some otherwise engaged, and all were  talking and laughing and making a great noise. Poor things! there was  nothing else to do in that prison.    Before mother had told our friend of our adventures, a girl, also a  passenger, who had been walking in the yard, ran in and announced, \"It's  time to go to dinner! He has come already.\" \"He\" we soon learned, was  the overseer of the Jewish special kitchen, without whom the meals were  never taken.    All the inmates of Number Five rushed out in less than a minute, and I  wondered why they hurried so. When we reached the place that served as  dining room, there was hardly any room for us. Now, while the dinner is  being served, I will tell you what I can see.    In the middle of the yard stood a number of long tables covered with  white oilcloth. On either side of each table stood benches on which all  the Jewish passengers were now seated, looking impatiently at the door  with the sign \"Jewish Kitchen\" over it. Pretty soon a man appeared in  the doorway, tall, spare, with a thin, pointed beard, and an air of  importance on his face. It was \"he\", the overseer, who carried a large  tin pail filled with black bread cut into pieces of half a pound each.  He gave a piece to every person, the youngest child and the biggest man  alike, and then went into the kitchen and filled his pail with soup and  meat, giving everybody a great bowl full of soup and a small piece of  meat. All attacked their rations as soon as they received them and  greatly relished the coarse bread and dark, hot water they called soup.  We couldn't eat those things and only wondered how any one could have  such an appetite for such a dinner. We stopped wondering when our own  little store of provisions gave out.    After dinner, the people went apart, some going back to their beds and  others to walk in the yard or sit on the settees there. There was no  other place to go to. The doors of the prison were never unlocked except  when new passengers arrived or others left for their ships. The  fences--they really were solid walls--had wires and nails on top, so  that one couldn't even climb to get a look at the sea.    We went back to our quarters to talk over matters and rest from our  journey. At six o'clock the doctor came with a clerk, and, standing  before the door, bade all those in the yard belonging to Number Five  assemble there; and then the roll was called and everybody received a  little ticket as she answered to her name. With this all went to the  kitchen and received two little rolls and a large cup of partly  sweetened tea. This was supper; and breakfast, served too in this way  was the same. Any wonder that people hurried to dinner and enjoyed it?  And it was always the same thing, no change.    Little by little we became used to the new life, though it was hard to  go hungry day after day, and bear the discomforts of the common room,  shared by so many; the hard beds (we had little bedding of our own), and  the confinement to the narrow limits of the yard, and the tiresome  sameness of the life. Meal hours, of course, played the most important  part, while the others had to be filled up as best we could. The weather  was fine most of the time and that helped much. Everything was an event,  the arrival of fresh passengers a great one which happened every day;  the day when the women were allowed to wash clothes by the well was a  holiday, and the few favorite girls who were allowed to help in the  kitchen were envied. On dull, rainy days, the man coming to light the  lamps at night was an object of pleasure, and every one made the best of  everybody else. So when a young man arrived who had been to America once  before, he was looked up to by every person there as a superior, his  stories of our future home listened to with delight, and his manners  imitated by all, as a sort of fit preparation. He was wanted everywhere,  and he made the best of his greatness by taking liberties and putting  on great airs and, I afterwards found, imposing on our ignorance very  much. But anything \"The American\" did passed for good, except his going  away a few days too soon.    Then a girl came who was rather wanting a little brightness. So all  joined in imposing upon her by telling her a certain young man was a  great professor whom all owed respect and homage to, and she would do  anything in the world to express hers, while he used her to his best  advantage, like the willing slave she was. Nobody seemed to think this  unkind at all, and it really was excusable that the poor prisoners,  hungry for some entertainment, should try to make a little fun when the  chance came. Besides, the girl had opened the temptation by asking, \"Who  was the handsome man in the glasses? A professor surely;\" showing that  she took glasses for a sure sign of a professor, and professor for the  highest possible title of honor. Doesn't this excuse us?    The greatest event was the arrival of some ship to take some of the  waiting passengers. When the gates were opened and the lucky ones said  good bye, those left behind felt hopeless of ever seeing the gates open  for them. It was both pleasant and painful, for the strangers grew to be  fast friends in a day and really rejoiced in each other's fortune, but  the regretful envy could not be helped either.    Amid such events as these a day was like a month at least. Eight of  these we had spent in quarantine when a great commotion was noticed  among the people of Number Five and those of the corresponding number in  the men's division. There was a good reason for it. You remember that it  was April and Passover was coming on; in fact, it began that night. The  great question was, Would we be able to keep it exactly according to the  host of rules to be obeyed? You who know all about the great holiday can  understand what the answer to that question meant to us. Think of all  the work and care and money it takes to supply a family with all the  things proper and necessary, and you will see that to supply a few  hundred was no small matter. Now, were they going to take care that all  was perfectly right, and could we trust them if they promised, or should  we be forced to break any of the laws that ruled the holiday?    All day long there was talking and questioning and debating and  threatening that \"we would rather starve than touch anything we were not  sure of.\" And we meant it. So some men and women went to the overseer to  let him know what he had to look out for. He assured them that he would  rather starve along with us than allow anything to be in the least  wrong. Still, there was more discussing and shaking of heads, for they  were not sure yet.    There was not a crumb anywhere to be found, because what bread we  received was too precious for any of it to be wasted; but the women made  a great show of cleaning up Number Five, while they sighed and looked  sad and told one another of the good hard times they had at home getting  ready for Passover. Really, hard as it is, when one is used to it from  childhood, it seems part of the holiday, and can't be left out. To sit  down and wait for supper as on other nights seemed like breaking one of  the laws. So they tried hard to be busy.    At night we were called by the overseer (who tried to look more  important than ever in his holiday clothes--not his best, though) to the  feast spread in one of the unoccupied rooms. We were ready for it, and  anxious enough. We had had neither bread nor matzo for dinner, and were  more hungry than ever, if that is possible. We now found everything  really prepared; there were the pillows covered with a snow-white  spread, new oilcloth on the newly scrubbed tables, some little candles  stuck in a basin of sand on the window-sill for the women, and--a sure  sign of a holiday--both gas lamps burning. Only one was used on other  nights.    Happy to see these things, and smell the supper, we took our places and  waited. Soon the cook came in and filled some glasses with wine from two  bottles,--one yellow, one red. Then she gave to each person--exactly one  and a half matzos; also some cold meat, burned almost to a coal for the  occasion.    The young man--bless him--who had the honor to perform the ceremonies,  was, fortunately for us all, one of the passengers. He felt for and with  us, and it happened--just a coincidence--that the greater part of the  ceremony escaped from his book as he turned the leaves. Though strictly  religious, nobody felt in the least guilty about it, especially on  account of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2064"],[0,"A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland (#7)"],[1," It was  not long ago taken by the Highlanders.  But its situation seems well  chosen for pleasure, if not for strength; it stands at the head of the  lake, and, by a sloop of sixty tuns, is supplied from Inverness with  great convenience.    We were now to cross the Highlands towards the western coast, and to  content ourselves with such accommodations, as a way so little frequented  could afford.  The journey was not formidable, for it was but of two  days, very unequally divided, because the only house, where we could be  entertained, was not further off than a third of the way.  We soon came  to a high hill, which we mounted by a military road, cut in traverses, so  that as we went upon a higher stage, we saw the baggage following us  below in a contrary direction.  To make this way, the rock has been hewn  to a level with labour that might have broken the perseverance of a Roman  legion.    The country is totally denuded of its wood, but the stumps both of oaks  and firs, which are still found, shew that it has been once a forest of  large timber.  I do not remember that we saw any animals, but we were  told that, in the mountains, there are stags, roebucks, goats and  rabbits.    We did not perceive that this tract was possessed by human beings, except  that once we saw a corn field, in which a lady was walking with some  gentlemen.  Their house was certainly at no great distance, but so  situated that we could not descry it.    Passing on through the dreariness of solitude, we found a party of  soldiers from the fort, working on the road, under the superintendence of  a serjeant.  We told them how kindly we had been treated at the garrison,  and as we were enjoying the benefit of their labours, begged leave to  shew our gratitude by a small present.          ANOCH      Early in the afternoon we came to Anoch, a village in Glenmollison of  three huts, one of which is distinguished by a chimney.  Here we were to  dine and lodge, and were conducted through the first room, that had the  chimney, into another lighted by a small glass window.  The landlord  attended us with great civility, and told us what he could give us to eat  and drink.  I found some books on a shelf, among which were a volume or  more of Prideaux's Connection.    This I mentioned as something unexpected, and perceived that I did not  please him.  I praised the propriety of his language, and was answered  that I need not wonder, for he had learned it by grammar.    By subsequent opportunities of observation, I found that my host's  diction had nothing peculiar.  Those Highlanders that can speak English,  commonly speak it well, with few of the words, and little of the tone by  which a Scotchman is distinguished.  Their language seems to have been  learned in the army or the navy, or by some communication with those who  could give them good examples of accent and pronunciation.  By their  Lowland neighbours they would not willingly be taught; for they have long  considered them as a mean and degenerate race.  These prejudices are  wearing fast away; but so much of them still remains, that when I asked a  very learned minister in the islands, which they considered as their most  savage clans: 'Those,' said he, 'that live next the Lowlands.'    As we came hither early in the day, we had time sufficient to survey the  place.  The house was built like other huts of loose stones, but the part  in which we dined and slept was lined with turf and wattled with twigs,  which kept the earth from falling.  Near it was a garden of turnips and a  field of potatoes.  It stands in a glen, or valley, pleasantly watered by  a winding river.  But this country, however it may delight the gazer or  amuse the naturalist, is of no great advantage to its owners.  Our  landlord told us of a gentleman, who possesses lands, eighteen Scotch  miles in length, and three in breadth; a space containing at least a  hundred square English miles.  He has raised his rents, to the danger of  depopulating his farms, and he fells his timber, and by exerting every  art of augmentation, has obtained an yearly revenue of four hundred  pounds, which for a hundred square miles is three halfpence an acre.    Some time after dinner we were surprised by the entrance of a young  woman, not inelegant either in mien or dress, who asked us whether we  would have tea.  We found that she was the daughter of our host, and  desired her to make it.  Her conversation, like her appearance, was  gentle and pleasing.  We knew that the girls of the Highlands are all  gentlewomen, and treated her with great respect, which she received as  customary and due, and was neither elated by it, nor confused, but repaid  my civilities without embarassment, and told me how much I honoured her  country by coming to survey it.    She had been at Inverness to gain the common female qualifications, and  had, like her father, the English pronunciation.  I presented her with a  book, which I happened to have about me, and should not be pleased to  think that she forgets me.    In the evening the soldiers, whom we had passed on the road, came to  spend at our inn the little money that we had given them.  They had the  true military impatience of coin in their pockets, and had marched at  least six miles to find the first place where liquor could be bought.  Having never been before in a place so wild and unfrequented, I was glad  of their arrival, because I knew that we had made them friends, and to  gain still more of their good will, we went to them, where they were  carousing in the barn, and added something to our former gift.  All that  we gave was not much, but it detained them in the barn, either merry or  quarrelling, the whole night, and in the morning they went back to their  work, with great indignation at the bad qualities of whisky.    We had gained so much the favour of our host, that, when we left his  house in the morning, he walked by us a great way, and entertained us  with conversation both on his own condition, and that of the country.  His  life seemed to be merely pastoral, except that he differed from some of  the ancient Nomades in having a settled dwelling.  His wealth consists of  one hundred sheep, as many goats, twelve milk-cows, and twenty-eight  beeves ready for the drover.    From him we first heard of the general dissatisfaction, which is now  driving the Highlanders into the other hemisphere; and when I asked him  whether they would stay at home, if they were well treated, he answered  with indignation, that no man willingly left his native country.  Of the  farm, which he himself occupied, the rent had, in twenty-five years, been  advanced from five to twenty pounds, which he found himself so little  able to pay, that he would be glad to try his fortune in some other  place.  Yet he owned the reasonableness of raising the Highland rents in  a certain degree, and declared himself willing to pay ten pounds for the  ground which he had formerly had for five.    Our host having amused us for a time, resigned us to our guides.  The  journey of this day was long, not that the distance was great, but that  the way was difficult.  We were now in the bosom of the Highlands, with  full leisure to contemplate the appearance and properties of mountainous  regions, such as have been, in many countries, the last shelters of  national distress, and are every where the scenes of adventures,  stratagems, surprises and escapes.    Mountainous countries are not passed but with difficulty, not merely from  the labour of climbing; for to climb is not always necessary: but because  that which is not mountain is commonly bog, through which the way must be  picked with caution.  Where there are hills, there is much rain, and the  torrents pouring down into the intermediate spaces, seldom find so ready  an outlet, as not to stagnate, till they have broken the texture of the  ground.    Of the hills, which our journey offered to the view on either side, we  did not take the height, nor did we see any that astonished us with their  loftiness.  Towards the summit of one, there was a white spot, which I  should have called a naked rock, but the guides, who had better eyes, and  were acquainted with the phenomena of the country, declared it to be  snow.  It had already lasted to the end of August, and was likely to  maintain its contest with the sun, till it should be reinforced by  winter.    The height of mountains philosophically considered is properly computed  from the surface of the next sea; but as it affects the eye or  imagination of the passenger, as it makes either a spectacle or an  obstruction, it must be reckoned from the place where the rise begins to  make a considerable angle with the plain.  In extensive continents the  land may, by gradual elevation, attain great height, without any other  appearance than that of a plane gently inclined, and if a hill placed  upon such raised ground be described, as having its altitude equal to the  whole space above the sea, the representation will be fallacious.    These mountains may be properly enough measured from the inland base; for  it is not much above the sea.  As we advanced at evening towards the  western coast, I did not observe the declivity to be greater than is  necessary for the discharge of the inland waters.    We passed many rivers and rivulets, which commonly ran with a clear  shallow stream over a hard pebbly bottom.  These channels, which seem so  much wider than the water that they convey would naturally require, are  formed by the violence of wintry floods, produced by the accumulation of  innumerable streams that fall in rainy weather from the hills, and  bursting away with resistless impetuosity, make themselves a passage  proportionate to their mass.    Such capricious and temporary waters cannot be expected to produce many  fish.  The rapidity of the wintry deluge sweeps them away, and the  scantiness of the summer stream would "]]]
