In all probability, I mean just what I say, and only that. At all  events I do fully mean _that_; and if there is anything reserved in my  mind, it will be probably different from what you would guess. You are  perfectly welcome to know all that I think, as soon as I have put before  you all my grounds for thinking it; but by the time I have done so, you  will be able to form an opinion of your own; and mine will then be of no  consequence to you.      37. I use then to-day, as I shall in future use, the word \"Religion\" as  signifying the feelings of love, reverence, or dread with which the  human mind is affected by its conceptions of spiritual being; and you  know well how necessary it is, both to the rightness of our own life,  and to the understanding the lives of others, that we should always keep  clearly distinguished our ideas of Religion, as thus defined, and of  Morality, as the law of rightness in human conduct. For there are many  religions, but there is only one morality. There are moral and immoral  religions, which differ as much in precept as in emotion; but there is  only one morality, WHICH HAS BEEN, IS, AND MUST BE FOR EVER, AN INSTINCT  IN THE HEARTS OF ALL CIVILISED MEN, AS CERTAIN AND UNALTERABLE AS THEIR  OUTWARD BODILY FORM, AND WHICH RECEIVES FROM RELIGION NEITHER LAW, NOR  PLACE; BUT ONLY HOPE, AND FELICITY.      38. The pure forms or states of religion hitherto known, are those in  which a healthy humanity, finding in itself many foibles and sins, has  imagined, or been made conscious of, the existence of higher spiritual  personality, liable to no such fault or stain; and has been assisted in  effort, and consoled in pain, by reference to the will or sympathy of  such purer spirits, whether imagined or real. I am compelled to use  these painful latitudes of expression, because no analysis has hitherto  sufficed to distinguish accurately, in historical narrative, the  difference between impressions resulting from the imagination of the  worshipper, and those made, if any, by the actually local and temporary  presence of another spirit. For instance, take the vision, which of all  others has been since made most frequently the subject of physical  representation--the appearance to Ezekiel and St. John of the four  living creatures, which throughout Christendom have been used to  symbolise the Evangelists.[4] Supposing such interpretation just, one of  those figures was either the mere symbol to St. John of himself, or it  was the power which inspired him, manifesting itself in an independent  form. Which of these it was, or whether neither of these, but a vision  of other powers, or a dream, of which neither the prophet himself knew,  nor can any other person yet know, the interpretation,--I suppose no  modestly-minded and accurate thinker would now take upon himself to  decide. Nor is it therefore anywise necessary for you to decide on that,  or any other such question; but it is necessary that you should be bold  enough to look every opposing question steadily in its face; and modest  enough, having done so, to know when it is too hard for you. But above  all things, see that you be modest in your thoughts, for of this one  thing we may be absolutely sure, that all our thoughts are but degrees  of darkness. And in these days you have to guard against the fatallest  darkness of the two opposite Prides;--the Pride of Faith, which imagines  that the nature of the Deity can be defined by its convictions; and the  Pride of Science, which imagines that the energy of Deity can be  explained by its analysis.    [Footnote 4: Only the Gospels, \"IV Evangelia,\" according to St. Jerome.]      39. Of these, the first, the Pride of Faith, is now, as it has been  always, the most deadly, because the most complacent and  subtle;--because it invests every evil passion of our nature with the  aspect of an angel of light, and enables the self-love, which might  otherwise have been put to wholesome shame, and the cruel carelessness  of the ruin of our fellow-men, which might otherwise have been warmed  into human love, or at least checked by human intelligence, to congeal  themselves into the mortal intellectual disease of imagining that  myriads of the inhabitants of the world for four thousand years have  been left to wander and perish, many of them everlastingly, in order  that, in fulness of time, divine truth might be preached sufficiently to  ourselves: with this farther ineffable mischief for direct result, that  multitudes of kindly-disposed, gentle, and submissive persons, who might  else by their true patience have alloyed the hardness of the common  crowd, and by their activity for good balanced its misdoing, are  withdrawn from all such true services of man, that they may pass the  best part of their lives in what they are told is the service of God;  _namely, desiring what_ _they cannot obtain, lamenting what they cannot  avoid, and reflecting on what they cannot understand_.[5]    [Footnote 5: This concentrated definition of monastic life is of course  to be understood only of its more enthusiastic forms.]      40. This, I repeat, is the deadliest, but for you, under existing  circumstances, it is becoming daily, almost hourly, the least probable  form of Pride. That which you have chiefly to guard against consists in  the overvaluing of minute though correct discovery; the groundless  denial of all that seems to you to have been groundlessly affirmed; and  the interesting yourselves too curiously in the progress of some  scientific minds, which in their judgment of the universe can be  compared to nothing so accurately as to the woodworms in the panel of a  picture by some great painter, if we may conceive them as tasting with  discrimination of the wood, and with repugnance of the colour, and  declaring that even this unlooked-for and undesirable combination is a  normal result of the action of molecular Forces.      41. Now, I must very earnestly warn you, in the beginning of my work  with you here, against allowing either of these forms of egotism to  interfere with your judgment or practice of art. On the one hand, you  must not allow the expression of your own favourite religious feelings  by any particular form of art to modify your judgment of its absolute  merit; nor allow the art itself to become an illegitimate means of  deepening and confirming your convictions, by realising to your eyes  what you dimly conceive with the brain; as if the greater clearness of  the image were a stronger proof of its truth. On the other hand, you  must not allow your scientific habit of trusting nothing but what you  have ascertained, to prevent you from appreciating, or at least  endeavouring to qualify yourselves to appreciate, the work of the  highest faculty of the human mind,--its imagination,--when it is toiling  in the presence of things that cannot be dealt with by any other power.      42. These are both vital conditions of your healthy progress. On the one  hand, observe that you do not wilfully use the realistic power of art  to convince yourselves of historical or theological statements which you  cannot otherwise prove; and which you wish to prove:--on the other hand,  that you do not check your imagination and conscience while seizing the  truths of which they alone are cognizant, because you value too highly  the scientific interest which attaches to the investigation of second  causes.    For instance, it may be quite possible to show the conditions in water  and electricity which necessarily produce the craggy outline, the  apparently self-contained silvery light, and the sulphurous blue shadow  of a thunder-cloud, and which separate these from the depth of the  golden peace in the dawn of a summer morning. Similarly, it may be  possible to show the necessities of structure which groove the fangs and  depress the brow of the asp, and which distinguish the character of its  head from that of the face of a young girl. But it is the function of  the rightly-trained imagination to recognise, in these, and such other  relative aspects, the unity of teaching which impresses, alike on our  senses and our conscience, the eternal difference between good and evil:  and the rule, over the clouds of heaven and over the creatures in the  earth, of the same Spirit which teaches to our own hearts the bitterness  of death, and strength of love.      43. Now, therefore, approaching our subject in this balanced temper,  which will neither resolve to see only what it would desire, nor expect  to see only what it can explain, we shall find our enquiry into the  relation of Art to Religion is distinctly threefold: first, we have to  ask how far art may have been literally directed by spiritual powers;  secondly, how far, if not inspired, it may have been exalted by them;  lastly, how far, in any of its agencies, it has advanced the cause of  the creeds it has been used to recommend.      44. First: What ground have we for thinking that art has ever been  inspired as a message or revelation? What internal evidence is there in  the work of great artists of their having been under the authoritative  guidance of supernatural powers?    It is true that the answer to so mysterious a question cannot rest alone  upon internal evidence; but it is well that you should know what might,  from that evidence alone, be concluded. And the more impartially you  examine the phenomena of imagination, the more firmly you will be led to  conclude that they are the result of the influence of the common and  vital, but not, therefore, less Divine, spirit, of which some portion is  given to all living creatures in such manner as may be adapted to their  rank in creation; and that everything which men rightly accomplish is  indeed done by Divine help, but under a consistent law which is never  departed from.

He rode past the bag without seeing it, for Lorraine had thrust it far  back under a stocky bush whose scraggly branches nearly touched the  ground. So he came at last to the creek, swollen with the night's storm  so that it was swift and dangerous. Lone was turning back when John Doe  threw up his head, stared up the creek for a moment and whinnied  shrilly. Lone stood in the stirrups and looked.    A blaze-faced horse was standing a short rifle-shot away, bridled and  with an empty saddle. Whether he was tied or not Lone could not tell at  that distance, but he knew the horse by its banged forelock and its  white face and sorrel ears, and he knew the owner of the horse. He rode  toward it slowly.    \"Whoa, you rattle-headed fool,\" he admonished, when the horse snorted  and backed a step or two as he approached. He saw the bridle-reins  dangling, broken, where the horse had stepped on them in running. \"Broke  loose and run off again,\" he said, as he took down his rope and widened  the loop. \"I'll bet Thurman would sell you for a bent nickel, this  morning.\"    The horse squatted and jumped when he cast the loop, and then stood  quivering and snorting while Lone dismounted and started toward him. Ten  steps from the horse Lone stopped short, staring. For down in the bushes  on the farther side half lay, half hung the limp form of a man.          CHAPTER FIVE    A DEATH \"BY ACCIDENT\"      Lone Morgan was a Virginian by birth, though few of his acquaintances  knew it. Lone never talked of himself except as his personal history  touched a common interest with his fellows. But until he was seventeen  he had lived very close to the center of one of the deadliest feuds of  the Blue Ridge. That he had been neutral was merely an accident of  birth, perhaps. And that he had not become involved in the quarrel that  raged among his neighbors was the direct result of a genius for holding  his tongue. He had attended the funerals of men shot down in their own  dooryards, he had witnessed the trials of the killers. He had grown up  with the settled conviction that other men's quarrels did not concern  him so long as he was not directly involved, and that what did not  concern him he had no right to discuss. If he stood aside and let  violence stalk by unhindered, he was merely doing what he had been  taught to do from the time he could walk. \"Mind your own business and  let other folks do the same,\" had been the family slogan in Lone's home.  There had been nothing in Lone's later life to convince him that minding  his own business was not a very good habit. It had grown to be second  nature,--and it had made him a good man for the Sawtooth Cattle Company  to have on its pay roll.    Just now Lone was stirred beyond his usual depth of emotion, and it was  not altogether the sight of Fred Thurman's battered body that unnerved  him. He wanted to believe that Thurman's death was purely an  accident,--the accident it appeared. But Lorraine and the telltale  hoofprints by the rock compelled him to believe that it was not an  accident. He knew that if he examined carefully enough Fred Thurman's  body he would find the mark of a bullet. He was tempted to look, and yet  he did not want to know. It was no business of his; it would be foolish  to let it become his business.    \"He's too dead to care now how it happened--and it would only stir up  trouble,\" he finally decided and turned his eyes away.    He pulled the twisted foot from the stirrup, left the body where it lay,  and led the blaze-faced horse to a tree and tied it securely. He took  off his coat and spread it over the head and shoulders of the dead man,  weighted the edges with rocks and rode away.    Halfway up the hill he left the road and took a narrow trail through the  sage, a short-cut that would save him a couple of miles.    The trail crossed the ridge half a mile beyond Rock City, dipping into  the lower end of the small gulch where he had overtaken the girl. The  place recalled with fresh vividness, her first words to him: \"Are _you_  the man I saw shoot that other man and fasten his foot in the stirrup?\"  Lone shivered and threw away the cigarette he had just lighted.    \"My God, that girl mustn't tell that to any one else!\" he exclaimed  apprehensively. \"No matter who she is or what she is, she mustn't tell  that!\"    \"Hello! Who you talking to? I heard somebody talking----\" The bushes  parted above a low, rocky ledge and a face peered out, smiling  good-humoredly. Lone started a little and pulled up.    \"Oh, hello, Swan. I was just telling this horse of mine all I was going  to do to him. Say, you're a chancey bird, Swan, yelling from the brush,  like that. Some folks woulda taken a shot at you.\"    \"Then they'd hit me, sure,\" Swan observed, letting himself down into the  trail. He, too, was wet from his hat crown to his shoes, that squelched  when he landed lightly on his toes. \"Anybody would be ashamed to shoot  at a mark so large as I am. I'd say they're poor shooters.\" And he added  irrelevantly, as he held up a grayish pelt, \"I got that coyote I been  chasing for two weeks. He was sure smart. He had me guessing. But I made  him guess some, maybe. He guessed wrong this time.\"    Lone's eyes narrowed while he looked Swan over. \"You must have been out  all night,\" he said. \"You're crazier about hunting than I am.\"    \"Wet bushes,\" Swan corrected carelessly. \"I been tramping since  daylight. It's my work to hunt, like it's your work to ride.\" He had  swung into the trail ahead of John Doe and was walking with long  strides,--the tallest, straightest, limberest young Swede in all the  country. He had the bluest eyes, the readiest smile, the healthiest  color, the sunniest hair and disposition the Sawtooth country had seen  for many a day. He had homesteaded an eighty-acre claim on the south  side of Bear Top and had by that means gained possession of two living  springs and the only accessible portion of Wilder Creek where it crossed  the meadow called Skyline before it plunged into a gulch too narrow for  cattle to water with any safety.    The Sawtooth Cattle Company had for years \"covered\" that eighty-acre  patch of government land, never dreaming that any one would ever file on  it. Swan Vjolmar was there and had his log cabin roofed and ready for  the door and windows before the Sawtooth discovered his presence. Now,  nearly a year afterwards, he was accepted in a tolerant, half-friendly  spirit. He had not objected to the Sawtooth cattle which still watered  at Skyline Meadow. He was a \"Government hunter\" and he had killed many  coyotes and lynx and even a mountain lion or two. Lone wondered  sometimes what the Sawtooth meant to do about the Swede, but so far the  Sawtooth seemed inclined to do nothing at all, evidently thinking his  war on animal pests more than atoned for his effrontery in taking  Skyline as a homestead. When he had proven up on his claim they would  probably buy him out and have the water still.    \"Well, what do you know?\" Swan turned his head to inquire abruptly.  \"You're pretty quiet.\"    Lone roused himself. \"Fred Thurman's been dragged to death by that  damned flighty horse of his,\" he said. \"I found him in the brush this  side of Granite Creek. Had his foot caught in the stirrup. I thought I'd  best leave him there till the coroner can view him.\"    Swan stopped short in the trail and turned facing Lone. \"Last night my  dog Yack whines to go out. He went and sat in a place where he looks  down on the walley, and he howled for half an hour. I said then that  somebody in the walley has died. That dog is something queer about it.  He knows things.\"    \"I'm going to the Sawtooth,\" Lone told him. \"I can telephone to the  coroner from there. Anybody at Thurman's place, do you know?\"    Swan shook his head and started again down the winding, steep trail. \"I  don't hunt over that way for maybe a week. That's too bad he's killed. I  like Fred Thurman. He's a fine man, you bet.\"    \"He was,\" said Lone soberly. \"It's a damn shame he had to go--like  that.\"    Swan glanced back at him, studied Lone's face for an instant and turned  into a tributary gully where a stream trickled down over water-worn  rocks. \"Here I leave you,\" he volunteered, as Lone came abreast of him.  \"A coyote's crossed up there, and I maybe find his tracks. I could go do  chores for Fred Thurman if nobody's there. Should I do that? What you  say, Lone?\"    \"You might drift around by there if it ain't too much out of your way,  and see if he's got a man on the ranch,\" Lone suggested. \"But you better  not touch anything in the house, Swan. The coroner'll likely appoint  somebody to look around and see if he's got any folks to send his stuff  to. Just feed any stock that's kept up, if nobody's there.\"    \"All right,\" Swan agreed readily. \"I'll do that, Lone. Good-by.\"    Lone nodded and watched him climb the steep slope of the gulch on the  side toward Thurman's ranch. Swan climbed swiftly, seeming to take no  thought of where he put his feet, yet never once slipping or slowing. In  two minutes he was out of sight, and Lone rode on moodily, trying not  to think of Fred Thurman, trying to shut from his mind the things that  wild-eyed, hoarse-voiced girl had told him.    \"Lone, you mind your own business,\" he advised himself once. \"You don't  know anything that's going to do any one any good, and what you don't  know there's no good guessing. But that girl--she mustn't talk like  that!\"    Of Swan he scarcely gave a thought after the Swede had disappeared, yet  Swan was worth a thought or two, even from a man who was bent on minding  his own business. Swan had no sooner climbed the gulch toward Thurman's  claim than he proceeded to descend rather carefully to the bottom again,  walk"]]]
