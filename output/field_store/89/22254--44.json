Television broadcast stations: This entry gives the total number of  separate broadcast stations plus any repeater stations.    Televisions: This entry gives the total number of television sets.    Terminology: Due to the highly structured nature of the Factbook  database, some collective generic terms have to be used. \"Country  name\" and \"National capital\", for example are used collectively to  include nations, dependent areas, uninhabited islands, areas of  special sovereignty, etc. The term \"Military\" is also used as an  umbrella term for various civil defense, security, and defense  activities.    Terrain: This entry contains a brief description of the topography.    Total fertility rate: This entry gives a figure for the average number  of children that would be born per woman if all women lived to the end  of their childbearing years and bore children according to a given  fertility rate at each age. The total fertility rate is a more direct  measure of the level of fertility than the crude birth rate, since it  refers to births per woman. This indicator shows the potential for  population growth in the country. High rates will also place some  limits on the labor force participation rates for women. Large numbers  of children born to women indicate large family sizes that might limit  the capacity of the families to educate their children.    Transnational Issues: This category includes only two entries at the  present time. Disputes--international and Illicit drugs--deal with  current issues going beyond national boundaries.    Transportation: This category includes the entries dealing with the  movement of people or material.    Transportation--note: This entry includes miscellaneous transportation  information of significance not included elsewhere.    Unemployment rate: This entry contains the percent of the labor force  that is without jobs. Substantial underemployment might be noted.    United Nations System: This information is presented in Appendix B:  United Nations System which is a chart, table, or text (depending on  the version of the Factbook) that shows the organization of the UN in  detail.    Waterways: This entry gives the total length and individual names of  navigable rivers, canals, and other inland bodies of water.    Weights and measures: This information is presented in Appendix E:  Weights and Measures which includes mathematical notations  (mathematical powers and names), metric interrelationships (prefix;  symbol; length, weight, or capacity; area; volume), and standard  conversion factors.    Years: All year references are for the calendar year (CY) unless  indicated as fiscal year (FY). The calendar year is an accounting  period of 12 months from 1 January to 31 December. The fiscal year is  an accounting period of 12 months other than 1 January to 31 December.  FY93/94 refers to the fiscal year that began in calendar year 1993 and  ended in calendar year 1994.

Well, they followed his wishes, and the casket  containing the bare, gnawed bones was sealed and never opened. And to  this day poor Mrs. Louderer thinks her boy died of some fever while yet  aboard the transport. The manner of his death has been kept so secret  that I am the only one who has heard it.    I was so sorry for the poor mother that I resolved to visit her the  first opportunity I had. I am at liberty to go where I please when  there is no one to cook for. So, when the men left, a few days later, I  took Jerrine and rode over to the Louderer ranch. I had never seen Mrs.  Louderer and it happened to be \"Benny's day\" that I blundered in upon.  I found her to be a dear old German woman living all alone, the people  who do the work on the ranch living in another house two miles away.  She had been weeping for hours when I got there, but in accordance with  her custom on the many anniversaries, she had a real feast prepared,  although no one had been bidden.    She says that God always sends her guests, but that was the first time  she had had a little girl. She had a little daughter once herself,  little Gretchen, but all that was left was a sweet memory and a  pitifully small mound on the ranch, quite near the house, where Benny  and Gretchen are at rest beside \"der fader, Herr Louderer.\"    She is such a dear old lady! She made us so welcome and she is so  entertaining. All the remainder of the day we listened to stories of  her children, looked at her pictures, and Jerrine had a lovely time  with a wonderful wooden doll that they had brought with them from  Germany. Mrs. Louderer forgot to weep in recalling her childhood days  and showing us her treasures. And then our feast,--for it was verily a  feast. We had goose and it was _so_ delicious. I couldn't tell you half  the good things any more than I could have eaten some of all of them.    We sat talking until far into the night, and she asked me how I was  going to spend Christmas. I told her, \"Probably in being homesick.\" She  said that would never do and suggested that we spend it together. She  said it was one of their special days and that the only happiness left  her was in making some one else happy; so she had thought of cooking  some nice things and going to as many sheep camps as she could, taking  with her the good things to the poor exiles, the sheep-herders. I liked  the plan and was glad to agree, but I never dreamed I should have so  lovely a time. When the queer old wooden clock announced two we went to  bed.    I left quite early the next morning with my head full of Christmas  plans. You may not know, but cattle-men and sheep-men cordially hate  each other. Mr. Stewart is a cattle-man, and so I didn't mention my  Christmas plans to him. I saved all the butter I could spare for the  sheep-herders; they never have any. That and some jars of gooseberry  jelly was all I could give them. I cooked plenty for the people here,  and two days before Christmas I had a chance to go down to Mrs.  Louderer's in a buggy, so we went. We found her up to her ears in  cooking, and such sights and smells I could never describe. She was so  glad I came early, for she needed help. I never worked so hard in my  life or had a pleasanter time.    Mrs. Louderer had sent a man out several days before to find out how  many camps there were and where they were located. There were twelve  camps and that means twenty-four men. We roasted six geese, boiled  three small hams and three hens. We had besides several meat-loaves and  links of sausage. We had twelve large loaves of the _best_ rye bread; a  small tub of doughnuts; twelve coffee-cakes, more to be called  fruit-cakes, and also a quantity of little cakes with seeds, nuts, and  fruit in them,--so pretty to look at and _so_ good to taste. These had  a thick coat of icing, some brown, some pink, some white. I had  thirteen pounds of butter and six pint jars of jelly, so we melted the  jelly and poured it into twelve glasses.    The plan was, to start real early Christmas Eve morning, make our  circuit of camps, and wind up the day at Frau O'Shaughnessy's to spend  the night. Yes, Mrs. O'Shaughnessy is Irish,--as Irish as the pigs in  Dublin. Before it was day the man came to feed and to get our horses  ready. We were up betimes and had breakfast. The last speck was wiped  from the shining stove, the kitchen floor was scrubbed, and the last  small thing put in order. The man had four horses harnessed and hitched  to the sled, on which was placed a wagon-box filled with straw, hot  rocks, and blankets. Our twelve apostles--that is what we called our  twelve boxes--were lifted in and tied firmly into place. Then we  clambered in and away we went. Mrs. Louderer drove, and Tam O'Shanter  and Paul Revere were snails compared to us. We didn't follow any road  either, but went sweeping along across country. No one else in the  world could have done it unless they were drunk. We went careening  along hill-sides without even slacking the trot. Occasionally we struck  a particularly stubborn bunch of sagebrush and even the sled-runners  would jump up into the air. We didn't stop to light, but hit the earth  several feet in advance of where we left it. Luck was with us, though.  I hardly expected to get through with my head unbroken, but not even a  glass was cracked.    It would have done your heart good to see the sheep-men. They were all  delighted, and when you consider that they live solely on canned corn  and tomatoes, beans, salt pork, and coffee, you can fancy what they  thought of their treat. They have mutton when it is fit to eat, but  that is certainly not in winter. One man at each camp does the cooking  and the other herds. It doesn't make any difference if the cook never  cooked before, and most of them never did. At one camp, where we  stopped for dinner, they had a most interesting collection of fossils.  After delivering our last \"apostle,\" we turned our faces toward Frau  O'Shaughnessy's, and got there just in time for supper.    Mrs. O'Shaughnessy is a widow, too, and has quite an interesting story.  She is a dumpy little woman whose small nose seems to be smelling the  stars, it is so tip-tilted. She has the merriest blue eyes and the  quickest wit. It is really worth a severe bumping just to be welcomed  by her. It was so warm and cozy in her low little cabin. She had her  table set for supper, but she laid plates for us and put before us a  beautifully roasted chicken. Thrifty Mrs. Louderer thought it should  have been saved until next day, so she said to Frau O'Shaughnessy, \"We  hate to eat your hen, best you save her till tomorrow.\" But Mrs.  O'Shaughnessy answered, \"Oh, 't is no mather, 't is an ould hin she was  annyway.\" So we enjoyed the \"ould hin,\" which was brown, juicy, and  tender.    When we had finished supper and were drinking our \"tay,\" Mrs.  O'Shaughnessy told our fortunes with the tea-leaves. She told mine  first and said I would die an old maid. I said it was rather late for  that, but she cheerfully replied, \"Oh, well, better late than niver.\"  She predicted for Mrs. Louderer that she should shortly catch a beau.  \"'T is the next man you see that will come coortin' you.\" Before we  left the table some one knocked and a young man, a sheep-herder,  entered. He belonged to a camp a few miles away and is out from Boston  in search of health. He had been into town and his horse was lamed so  he could not make it into camp, and he wanted to stay overnight. He was  a stranger to us all, but Mrs. O'Shaughnessy made him at home and fixed  such a tempting supper for him that I am sure he was glad of the chance  to stay. He was very decidedly English, and powerfully proud of it. He  asked Mrs. O'Shaughnessy if she was Irish and she said, \"No, ye  haythen, it's Chinese Oi am. Can't yez tell it be me Cockney accint?\"  Mr. Boutwell looked very much surprised. I don't know which was the  funnier, the way he looked or what she said.    We had a late breakfast Christmas morning, but before we were through  Mr. Stewart came. We had planned to spend the day with Mrs.  O'Shaughnessy, but he didn't approve of our going into the sheep  district, so when he found where we had gone he came after us. Mrs.  Louderer and he are old acquaintances and he bosses her around like he  tries to boss me. Before we left, Mrs. O'Shaughnessy's married daughter  came, so we knew she would not be lonely.    It was almost one o'clock when we got home, but all hands helped and I  had plenty cooked anyway, so we soon had a good dinner on the table.  Mr. Stewart had prepared a Christmas box for Jerrine and me. He doesn't  approve of white waists in the winter. I had worn one at the wedding  and he felt personally aggrieved. For me in the box were two dresses,  that is, the material to make them. One is a brown and red checked, and  the other green with a white fleck in, both outing flannel. For Jerrine  there was a pair of shoes and stockings, both stockings full of candy  and nuts. He is very bluff in manner, but he is really the kindest  person.    Mrs. Louderer stayed until New Year's day. My Christmas was really a  very happy one.      Your friend,      ELINORE RUPERT.    ... An interesting day on this ranch is the day the cattle are named.  If Mr. Stewart had children he would as soon think of leaving them  unnamed as to let a \"beastie\" go without a name.    On the day they vaccinated he came into the kitchen and told me he  would need me to help him name the \"critters.\" So he and I \"assembled\"  in a safe place and took turns naming the calves. As fast as a calf was  vaccinated it was run out of the chute and he or I called out a name  for it and it was booked that way.    The first two he named were the \"Duke of Monmouth\" and the \"Duke of  Montrose.\" I called my first \"Oliver Cromwell\" and \"John Fox.\" The poor  \"mon\" had to have revenge, so"]]]
