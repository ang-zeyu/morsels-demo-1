With the  last pulsations of the belly comes silence; the length of the silent  interval varies according to the state of the atmosphere. Then, of a  sudden, begins a new strophe, a monotonous repetition of the first; and  so on indefinitely.    It often happens, especially during the hours of the sultry afternoons,  that the insect, intoxicated with sunlight, shortens and even suppresses  the intervals of silence. The song is then continuous, but always with  an alternation of crescendo and diminuendo. The first notes are heard  about seven or eight o'clock in the morning, and the orchestra ceases  only when the twilight fails, about eight o'clock at night. The concert  lasts a whole round of the clock. But if the sky is grey and the wind  chilly the Cigale is silent.    The second species, only half the size of the common Cigale, is known in  Provence as the _Cacan_; the name, being a fairly exact imitation of the  sound emitted by the insect. This is the Cigale of the flowering ash,  far more alert and far more suspicious than the common species. Its  harsh, loud song consists of a series of cries--_can! can! can!  can!_--with no intervals of silence subdividing the poem into stanzas.  Thanks to its monotony and its harsh shrillness, it is a most odious  sound, especially when the orchestra consists of hundreds of performers,  as is often the case in my two plane-trees during the dog-days. It is as  though a heap of dry walnuts were being shaken up in a bag until the  shells broke. This painful concert, which is a real torment, offers only  one compensation: the Cigale of the flowering ash does not begin his  song so early as the common Cigale, and does not sing so late in the  evening.    Although constructed on the same fundamental principles, the vocal  organs exhibit a number of peculiarities which give the song its special  character. The sound-box is lacking, which suppresses the entrance to  it, or the window. The cymbal is uncovered, and is visible just behind  the attachment of the hinder wing. It is, as before, a dry white scale,  convex on the outside, and crossed by a bundle of fine reddish-brown  nervures.    [Illustration: 1. THE ADULT CIGALE, FROM BELOW.    2. THE ADULT CIGALE, FROM BELOW.    3. THE CIGALE OF THE FLOWERING ASH, MALE AND FEMALE.]    From the forward side of the first segment of the abdomen project two  short, wide, tongue-shaped projections, the free extremities of which  rest on the cymbals. These tongues may be compared to the blade of a  watchman's rattle, only instead of engaging with the teeth of a rotating  wheel they touch the nervures of the vibrating cymbal. From this fact, I  imagine, results the harsh, grating quality of the cry. It is hardly  possible to verify the fact by holding the insect in the fingers; the  terrified _Cacan_ does not go on singing his usual song.    The dampers do not overlap; on the contrary, they are separated by a  fairly wide interval. With the rigid tongues, appendages of the abdomen,  they half shelter the cymbals, half of which is completely bare. Under  the pressure of the finger the abdomen opens a little at its  articulation with the thorax. But the insect is motionless when it  sings; there is nothing of the rapid vibrations of the belly which  modulate the song of the common Cigale. The chapels are very small;  almost negligible as resonators. There are mirrors, as in the common  Cigale, but they are very small; scarcely a twenty-fifth of an inch in  diameter. In short, the resonating mechanism, so highly developed in the  common Cigale, is here extremely rudimentary. How then is the feeble  vibration of the cymbals re-enforced until it becomes intolerable?    This species of Cigale is a ventriloquist. If we examine the abdomen by  transmitted light, we shall see that the anterior two-thirds of the  abdomen are translucent. With a snip of the scissors we will cut off the  posterior third, to which are relegated, reduced to the strictly  indispensable, the organs necessary to the propagation of the species  and the preservation of the individual. The rest of the abdomen presents  a spacious cavity, and consists simply of the integuments of the walls,  except on the dorsal side, which is lined with a thin muscular layer,  and supports a fine digestive canal, almost a thread. This large cavity,  equal to nearly half the total volume of the insect, is thus almost  absolutely empty. At the back are seen the two motor muscles of the  cymbals, two muscular columns arranged like the limbs of a ~V~. To right  and left of the point of this ~V~ shine the tiny mirrors; and between  the two branches of muscle the empty cavity is prolonged into the depths  of the thorax.    This empty abdomen with its thoracic annex forms an enormous resonator,  such as no other performer in our countryside can boast of. If I close  with my finger the orifice of the truncated abdomen the sound becomes  flatter, in conformity with the laws affecting musical resonators; if I  fit into the aperture of the open body a tube or trumpet of paper the  sound grows louder as well as deeper. With a paper cone corresponding  to the pitch of the note, with its large end held in the mouth of a  test-tube acting as a resonator, we have no longer the cry of the  Cigale, but almost the bellowing of a bull. My little children,  coming up to me by chance at the moment of this acoustic experiment,  fled in terror.    The grating quality of the sound appears to be due to the little tongues  which press on the nervures of the vibrating cymbals; the cause of its  intensity is of course the ample resonator in the abdomen. We must admit  that one must truly have a real passion for song before one would empty  one's chest and stomach in order to make room for a musical-box. The  necessary vital organs are extremely small, confined to a mere corner of  the body, in order to increase the amplitude of the resonating cavity.  Song comes first of all; other matters take the second rank.    It is lucky that the _Cacan_ does not follow the laws of evolution. If,  more enthusiastic in each generation, it could acquire, in the course of  progress, a ventral resonator comparable to my paper trumpets, the South  of France would sooner or later become uninhabitable, and the _Cacan_  would have Provence to itself.    After the details already given concerning the common Cigale it is  hardly needful to tell you how the insupportable _Cacan_ can be reduced  to silence. The cymbals are plainly visible on the exterior. Pierce them  with the point of a needle, and immediately you have perfect silence. If  only there were, in my plane-trees, among the insects which carry  gimlets, some friends of silence like myself, who would devote  themselves to such a task! But no: a note would be lacking in the  majestic symphony of harvest-tide.    We are now familiar with the structure of the musical organ of the  Cigale. Now the question arises: What is the object of these musical  orgies? The reply seems obvious: they are the call of the males inviting  their mates; they constitute a lovers' cantata.    I am going to consider this reply, which is certainly a very natural  one. For thirty years the common Cigale and his unmusical friend the  _Cacan_ have thrust their society upon me. For two months every summer I  have them under my eyes, and their voice in my ears. If I do not listen  to them very willingly I observe them with considerable zeal. I see  them ranged in rows on the smooth rind of the plane-trees, all with  their heads uppermost, the two sexes mingled, and only a few inches  apart.    The proboscis thrust into the bark, they drink, motionless. As the sun  moves, and with it the shadow, they also move round the branch with slow  lateral steps, so as to keep upon that side which is most brilliantly  illuminated, most fiercely heated. Whether the proboscis is at work or  not the song is never interrupted.    Now are we to take their interminable chant for a passionate love-song?  I hesitate. In this gathering the two sexes are side by side. One does  not spend months in calling a person who is at one's elbow. Moreover, I  have never seen a female rush into the midst of even the most deafening  orchestra. Sight is a sufficient prelude to marriage, for their sight is  excellent. There is no need for the lover to make an everlasting  declaration, for his mistress is his next-door neighbour.    Is the song a means of charming, of touching the hard of heart? I doubt  it. I observe no sign of satisfaction in the females; I have never seen  them tremble or sway upon their feet, though their lovers have clashed  their cymbals with the most deafening vigour.    My neighbours the peasants say that at harvest-time the Cigale sings to  them: _Sego, sego, sego!_ (Reap, reap, reap!) to encourage them in their  work. Harvesters of ideas and of ears of grain, we follow the same  calling; the latter produce food for the stomach, the former food for  the mind. Thus I understand their explanation and welcome it as an  example of gracious simplicity.    Science asks for a better explanation, but finds in the insect a world  which is closed to us. There is no possibility of foreseeing, or even  of suggesting the impression produced by this clashing of cymbals upon  those who inspire it. The most I can say is that their impassive  exterior seems to denote a complete indifference. I do not insist that  this is so; the intimate feelings of the insect are an insoluble  mystery.    Another reason for doubt is this: all creatures affected by song have  acute hearing, and this sense of hearing, a vigilant sentinel, should  give warning of danger at the slightest sound. The birds have an  exquisite delicacy of hearing. If a leaf stirs among the branches, if  two passers-by exchange a word, they are suddenly silent, anxious, and  on "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18362"],[0,"Fifteen Thousand Useful Phrases (#7)"],[1,"insecure truce    insensate barbarism    insensibly flattered    inseparably associated    insidious tendency    insignificant blot    insincere profession    insinuatingly pursued    insipid tameness    insistent babel    insolent placidity    insoluble riddles    inspiring achievement    inspiriting spectacle    instant readiness    instantaneous cessations    instinctive disapproval    insufferably dull    insufficient appeal    insular strength    insulting invectives      [invective = abusive language]    insuperable difficulty    insurmountable obstacles    intangible something    integral element    intellectual integrity    intelligent adaptation    intemperate scorn    intense perplexity    intensive cultivation    intentional garbling    interior spirit    interlocking directorate    intermediate link    interminable question    intermingled gloom    intermittent threats    internal dissension    interpolated speech    interpretative criticism    interwoven thread    intimately allied    intolerably tedious    intoxicating hum    intractable temper    intrenched privilege    intrepid dexterity    intricate interlacings    intriguing braggart    intrinsic fecundity       [fecundity = productive or creative power]    intrusive brightness    intuitive perception    invaluable composition    invariable kindness    inveighing incessantly    [inveighing = angry disapproval]    inventive jealousy    inveterate antipathy    invidious mention         [invidious = rousing ill will or resentment]    invigorating discipline    invincible optimism    inviolable confidence    involuntary yearnings    involuted sentences       [involuted = intricate;
