Yes, the property was fast  making its owners rich.    Rupert Ames was a \"rising young man,\" lacking the finished polish of a  higher education, no doubt, but still, he was no \"green-horn.\" Even Miss  Wilton had to acknowledge that, when she became acquainted so that she  could speak freely with him. He was a shrewd business man and knew how  to invest his growing bank account. It was no secret that city lots and  business property were continually being added to his possessions.    As to home life at the farm, Miss Wilton was always charmed with the  kind hearted mother, the bright, cheerful Nina, and the handsome, sober  head of the family. Such a beautiful spirit of harmony brooded over the  place! Even within the year, the observant young woman could see signs  of culture and coming wealth. The repairing of old buildings, and the  erecting of the new ones; the repainting and decorating of rooms; the  addition of costly pictures and furniture; the beautifying of the  outside surroundings--all this was observed, and a mental note taken.    For a time Rupert Ames was quite reserved in the presence of the young  school teacher. Naturally reticent, he was more than ever shy in the  company of an educated lady from the East. Rupert never saw her but he  thought of the day of her arrival on Dry Bench and the time when he held  her in his arms. Never had he referred to the latter part of the  episode, though she often talked of her peculiar introduction to them.    At the end of the first year, Miss Wilton had so far shown that she was  but common flesh and blood that Rupert had been in her company to a  number of socials, and they had walked from church a few times together.  Dame gossip at once mated the two, and pronounced it a fine match.    Early in September they had a peach party at the Ames farm. Willowby's  young folks were there, and having a good time. When the sun sank  behind the hills on the other side of the valley, and the cool air came  from the eastern mountains, Chinese lanterns were hung on the trees, and  chairs and tables were placed on the lawn. There were cake and ice-cream  and peaches--peaches of all kinds, large and small, white and yellow,  juicy and dry; for this was a peach party, and everybody was supposed to  eat, at least, half a dozen.    The band, with Volmer Holm as leader, furnished the music; and beautiful  it was, as it echoed from the porch out over the assembly on the lawn.  When the strains of a waltz floated out, a dozen couples glided softly  over the velvety grass.    \"That's fine music, Volmer,\" Rupert was saying to the bandmaster, as the  music ceased.    \"Do you think so? We've practiced very much since our new organization  was effected. Will it do for a concert?\"    \"You know I'm no judge of music. I like yours, though, Volmer. What do  you say about it, Miss Wilton? Mr. Holm wishes to know if his music is  fit for a concert?\"    \"Most certainly it is,\" answered the young lady addressed, as she  stepped up with an empty peach basket. \"Mr. Holm, I understand that last  piece is your own composition? If so, I must congratulate you; it is  most beautiful.\"    \"Thank you,\" and he bowed as he gave the signal to begin again.    \"Mr. Ames, more peaches are wanted--the big yellow ones. Where shall I  find them?\"    \"I'll get some--or, I'll go with you.\" He was getting quite bold.  Perhaps the music had something to do with that.    He did not take the basket, but led the way out into the orchard. It was  quite a distance to the right tree.    \"That is beautiful music,\" said she. \"Mr. Holm is a genius. He'll make  his mark if he keeps on.\"    \"Yes, I understand that he is going East to study. That will bring him  out if there is anything in him.\"    There was a pause in the conversation; then Rupert remarked carefully,  as if feeling his way:    \"Yes, there's talent in Volmer, but he makes music his god, which I  think is wrong.\"    \"Do you think so?\" she asked.    What that expression meant, it was hard to say.    \"Yes, I think that no man should so drown himself in one thing that he  is absolutely dead to everything else. Mr. Holm does that. Volmer  worships nothing but music.\"    Rupert filled the basket and they sauntered back.    \"A more beautiful god I cannot imagine,\" she said, half aloud.    Rupert turned with an inquiring look on his face, but he got nothing  more from her, as she was busy with a peach. Her straw hat was tilted  back on her head, and the wavy brown hair was somewhat in confusion.  School teaching had not, as yet, driven the roses from her cheeks, nor  the smiles from her lips. There was just enough of daylight left so  that Rupert could see Miss Wilton's big eye looking into his own. How  beautiful she was!    \"Mr. Ames, before we get back to the company, I wish to ask you a  question. Mr. Holm has asked me to sing at his concert, and I should  like to help him, if the school trustees do not object.\"    \"Why should they, Miss Wilton?\"    \"Well, some people, you know, are so peculiar.\"    \"I assure you they will not care--that is, if it will not interfere with  your school duties.\"    \"As to that, not a moment. I need no rehearsals as I am used to--that is  I--you see, I will sing some old song.\"    Miss Wilton's speech became unusually confused, and Rupert noticed it;  but just then Nina and her escort joined them, and they all went back to  the lawn.    \"Miss Wilton's going to sing at the concert,\" Volmer told Rupert later  in the evening. \"'Twill be a big help. She's a regular opera singer, you  know. She's been in the business. I heard her sing in Denver two years  ago, and she was with a troupe that passed through here some time since.  I remember her well, but of course I wouldn't say anything to her about  it. No doubt she wishes to forget it all.\"    \"What do you mean?\" asked Rupert, quite fiercely.    \"I mean that her company then was not of the choicest, but I believe  she's all right and a good enough girl. Rupe, don't bother about that.  Perhaps I shouldn't have said anything to you.\"    \"Oh, that's all right. I'm glad you mentioned it.\"    Still a dull, miserable pain fastened itself in Rupert Ames' heart the  rest of the evening; and even when the company had gone, and Miss Wilton  had lingered and sweetly said \"Good-night,\" and the lights were out,  strange thoughts and feelings drove from his eyes the sleep that usually  came peacefully to him.    Rupert Ames was in love. The fact became the central idea of his  existence.    During Rupert's busy life, love affairs had not occupied much of his  attention. Of course, he, in common with the rest of young mankind,  thought that some day he would love some girl and make her his wife; but  it was always as a far-away dream to him, connected with an angelic  perfection which he always found missing in the workaday world. His wife  must be a pure, perfect creature. Marriage was a sacred thing--one of  the great events in a person's life. Not that these views had now  changed altogether, for Miss Virginia Wilton came nearer his ideal than  anyone he had yet met. Still, there was considerable of the tangible  present about her. She was educated, businesslike, and a leader, and he,  ambitious of attaining to something in the world, would need such a  woman for his wife. But that sting which Volmer Holm had given him! His  wife must be beyond suspicion. He could not afford to make a mistake,  for if he did, it would be the mistake of his life. But was it a sin for  a girl to sing in an opera? Certainly not. Anyway, he would not condemn  her unheard--and then, he was sure he loved her. It had come to him  unbidden. It was no fault of his that this girl should have come into  his common life, and, seemingly, completely change it.    The autumn days passed. With the work of harvesting and marketing there  was no time for social gatherings. The school teacher had changed her  boarding place, and her path lay no longer past the Ames farm. So Rupert  mingled his thoughts with his labors, and in time there emerged from  that fusion a fixed purpose.    That fall Rupert's time as school trustee expired. At the first meeting  of the new board, Miss Wilton's position was given to a male teacher.  The reason given for the change was that \"It takes a man to govern  boys.\" Other reasons, however, could be heard in the undercurrent of  talk.    The first Sunday after he heard of it, Rupert found Miss Wilton, and  together they walked up the canyon road. It was a dull, cloudy day, and  not a breath moved the odorous choke-cherry bushes which lined the dusty  road. Never mind what was said and done that afternoon. 'Tis an old, old  story. Between woman's smiles and tears, the man gained hope and  courage, and when that evening they came down the back way through the  fields and orchards, Virginia Wilton was Rupert Ames' promised wife.          IV.      \"O Lord, lead me in a plain path.\"--_Isaiah 27:11._      The scene shifts to a land afar off toward the north, Norway--away up  into one of its mountain meadows. The landscape is a mixture of grandeur  and beauty. Hills upon hills, covered with pine and fir, stretch away  from the lowlands to the distant glacier-clad mountains, and patches of  green meadow gleam through the dark pine depths.    The clear blue sky changes to a faint haze in the hilly distance. The  gentle air is perfumed with the odor of the forest. A Sabbath stillness  broods over all. The sun has swung around to the northwest, and skims  along the horizon as if loth to leave such a sweet scene.    Evening was settling down on the Norwegian _saeter_, or summer herd  ground. Riding along the trail through the pines appeared a young man.  He was evidently not at home in the forest, as he peered anxiously  through every opening. His dress and bearing indicated that he was not a  woodsman nor a herder of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17253"],[0,"Dewey and Other Naval Commanders (#7)"],[1,"ahamas, and captured the fort and a sixteen-gun  man-of-war. Many other valiant exploits were performed and before long  some of the more daring privateers boldly crossed the Atlantic and by  their deeds threw the coast of Great Britain into consternation.    Among the most remarkable of these naval heroes was a young Scotchman,  not quite thirty years old.    [Illustration]    He had been trained in the merchant service and had become a skilful  sailor before he removed to Virginia, where he made his home. He  devotedly loved his adopted country, and, when the war broke out between  the colonies and Great Britain, and the long, hard struggle for  independence began, he was among the very first to offer his services on  the side of liberty. His character was so well known and appreciated  that he was appointed a first lieutenant. I am sure you have all heard  of him, for his name was John Paul Jones, though since, for some reason  or other, he dropped his first name and is generally referred to simply  as Paul Jones.    His first service was on the _Alfred_, which helped in the capture of  the fort at New Providence, already spoken of. Jones with his own hands  hoisted the first flag displayed on an American man-of-war. It was of  yellow silk, with the device of a rattlesnake, and bore the motto,  \"Don't tread on me.\"    Jones attracted such favorable attention during this enterprise that on  his return he was made commander of the twelve-ton brig _Providence_ and  was employed for a time in carrying troops from Rhode Island to New  York. Since he was by birth a citizen of Great Britain, which then  insisted that \"once a British subject always a British subject,\" the  English cruisers made determined efforts to capture him. Many of the  officers declared that if they could lay hands on the audacious  freebooter, as they called him, they would hang him at the yard arm.  But, before doing so, they had to catch him, and that proved a harder  task than they suspected. He was chased many times and often fired into,  but the _Providence_ was always swift enough to show a clean pair of  heels to her pursuers and Jones himself was such a fine sailor that he  laughed at their efforts to take him prisoner.    One of the cleverest exploits of Jones was performed in the autumn of  1776. He saw an American brig returning from the West Indies, heavily  laden with supplies for Washington's army, which was badly in need of  them. A British frigate was in hot pursuit of the American, which was  straining every nerve to escape, but would not have been able to do so  except for Jones, who ran in between the two, and, firing into the  frigate, induced her to let the American go and chase him. Taking  advantage of the chance thus offered, the brig got safely away and then  Jones himself dodged away from the frigate, which thus lost both.    In the month of October, 1776, Jones was promoted to the rank of captain  and ordered to cruise between Boston and the Delaware. I must tell you  an anecdote which illustrates his wonderful seamanship.    Some weeks before he was made a captain, and while cruising off Bermuda,  he saw five sail far to the windward and he beat up, doing so carefully  and with the purpose of finding out whether there was a chance for him  to strike an effective blow. He picked out what looked like a large  merchant ship and gave chase. He gained fast, but to his dismay, when he  was quite close, he discovered that instead of a merchant ship he had  almost run into a twenty-eight gun frigate of the enemy.    Finding he had caught a Tartar, Jones did the only thing left to him. He  hauled off and put on every stitch of sail and the frigate did the same.  She proved the better sailer, and, though she gained slowly, it was  surely, and in the course of a few hours she had approached within  musket shot of the brig's lee quarter. There seemed no possible escape  for Jones, knowing which, he did a remarkable thing. He veered off until  the frigate was almost astern, when he put about dead before the wind,  with every yard of canvas set.    The Englishman was dumfounded by the daring manoeuvre, which brought  the American within pistol shot, for he did not fire a gun until Jones  was beyond reach of his grape. The pursuit was continued hour after  hour, but the brig was now at her best and finally left her pursuer  hopelessly astern. When the _Providence_ ran into Newport in October she  had captured or destroyed fifteen prizes.    Jones's bold and skilful seamanship drew attention to him and he was now  given command of the 24-gun ship _Alfred_, while Captain Hacker took  charge of the _Providence_. The two vessels started on a cruise in  company and some days later the _Alfred_ fell in with three British  vessels, and, after a brisk action, captured them all. One proved to be  a transport with 150 men and a large amount of supplies for Burgoyne's  army, which was at that time organizing in Montreal for its notable  campaign through New York, where it was captured by General Gates, at  Saratoga.    This transport was so valuable that Jones, instead of putting a prize  crew on board, determined to take her into port, and, if in danger of  capture from pursuit, he meant to sink her. It began snowing the  following night and the _Providence_ and _Alfred_ were obliged to  separate.    Jones was making for Boston when he was discovered by the frigate that  he had outwitted two months before, when the _Providence_ narrowly  escaped capture. Night was closing in and the frigate being to windward,  her outlines were indistinct. Captain Jones ordered his prizes to steer  southward and to pay no attention to the signals displayed on his own  vessel. At midnight he hoisted a toplight and tacked to the west,  knowing the others would continue to the southward as he had directed.  The strategem was successful, for at daylight the frigate was pressing  hard after the _Alfred_, while the prizes had disappeared. The _Alfred_  eluded her enemy as before, and, upon reaching Boston, Jones found his  captives awaiting him.    An idea of the effectiveness of the privateers may be gained by the  statement that during the year 1777 nearly 500 vessels were captured by  them. By that time Paul Jones had proven himself to be the finest  officer in the American Navy. He had every quality to make him such. No  one could surpass him in seamanship. He was cool and daring and was  animated by the highest patriotism for his adopted country. Such a man  was sure to be heard of again, as Great Britain learned to her cost.    France had shown a strong liking for the American colonies from the  first. No doubt this liking was influenced by her hatred of England, for  the nations had been bitter rivals for years. We had sent several  commissioners to Paris, and they did a good deal for our country. The  commissioners had a heavy, single-decked frigate built in Holland, which  was named the _South Carolinian_ and was intended for Paul Jones, but  some difficulties occurred and he was sent to sea in the 18-gun ship  _Ranger_, which left Portsmouth, N.H., at the beginning of November. She  was so poorly equipped that Jones complained, though he did not hesitate  on that account.    On the way to Nantes, in France, the _Ranger_ captured two prizes,  refitted at Brest, and in April, 1778, sailed for the British coast.  Having made several captures, Captain Jones headed for the Isle of Man,  his intention being to make a descent upon Whitehaven. A violent wind  that night baffled him, and, hoping to prevent his presence in the  section from being discovered, he kept his vessel disguised as a  merchantman. Sailing hither and thither, generally capturing all vessels  that he sighted, he finally turned across to the Irish coast and in the  latter part of the month was off Carrickfergus, where he learned from  some fishermen that the British sloop-of-war _Drake_ was at anchor in  the roads. Jones was exceedingly anxious to attack her, and planned a  night surprise, but again the violent wind interfered and he was forced  to give up the scheme, so well suited to his daring nature.    This brave man now set out to execute one of the most startling schemes  that can be imagined. Whitehaven at that time was a city of 50,000  inhabitants and the harbor was filled with shipping. His plan was to  sail in among the craft and burn them all. It seemed like the idea of a  man bereft of his senses, but there was not the slightest hesitation on  his part. Such enterprises often succeed through their very boldness,  and his belief was that by acting quickly he could accomplish his  purpose and strike a blow at England that would carry consternation to  the people and the government.    Captain Jones had in mind the many outrages committed by British vessels  along our seacoast, for, describing his purpose in a memorial to  Congress, he said his intention was, by one good fire in England of  British shipping, \"to put an end to all burnings in America.\"          CHAPTER V.      A Daring Attempt by Captain Paul Jones--Why It Failed--A Bold  Scheme--Why It Did Not Succeed--The Fight Between the _Ranger_ and  _Drake_.        Paul Jones waited until midnight. Then, when no one was dreaming of  danger, his men silently pulled away from the _Ranger_ in two boats, one  commanded by himself and the other by Lieutenant Wallingford. It was a  long pull, and when they reached the outer pier of the harbor it was  beginning to grow light in the east. They now parted company, and Jones  directed his men to row for the south side of the harbor, while the  Lieutenant was to make for the north shore. The object of the two was  the same: the burning of the shipping.    Wallingford reached the north side, and then, strangely enough, gave up  the attempt, his reason being that the candle on which he counted to  start the fire was blown out.
