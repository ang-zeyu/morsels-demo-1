Formerly we accorded to man, as his  inheritance from some higher order of beings, what was called \"free  will\"; now we have taken even this will from him, for the term no longer  describes anything that we can understand. The old word \"will\" now  connotes only a sort of result, an individual reaction, that follows  inevitably upon a series of partly discordant and partly harmonious  stimuli--the will no longer \"acts,\" or \"moves.\"... Formerly it was  thought that man's consciousness, his \"spirit,\" offered evidence of his  high origin, his divinity. That he might be _perfected_, he was advised,  tortoise-like, to draw his senses in, to have no traffic with earthly  things, to shuffle off his mortal coil--then only the important part of  him, the \"pure spirit,\" would remain. Here again we have thought out the  thing better: to us consciousness, or \"the spirit,\" appears as a symptom  of a relative imperfection of the organism, as an experiment, a groping,  a misunderstanding, as an affliction which uses up nervous force  unnecessarily--we deny that anything can be done perfectly so long as it  is done consciously. The \"pure spirit\" is a piece of pure stupidity:  take away the nervous system and the senses, the so-called \"mortal  shell,\" and _the rest is miscalculation_--that is all!...      15.    Under Christianity neither morality nor religion has any point of  contact with actuality. It offers purely imaginary _causes_ (\"God,\"  \"soul,\" \"ego,\" \"spirit,\" \"free will\"--or even \"unfree\"), and purely  imaginary _effects_ (\"sin,\" \"salvation,\" \"grace,\" \"punishment,\"  \"forgiveness of sins\"). Intercourse between imaginary _beings_ (\"God,\"  \"spirits,\" \"souls\"); an imaginary _natural history_ (anthropocentric; a  total denial of the concept of natural causes); an imaginary  _psychology_ (misunderstandings of self, misinterpretations of agreeable  or disagreeable general feelings--for example, of the states of the  _nervus sympathicus_ with the help of the sign-language of  religio-ethical balderdash--, \"repentance,\" \"pangs of conscience,\"  \"temptation by the devil,\" \"the presence of God\"); an imaginary  _teleology_ (the \"kingdom of God,\" \"the last judgment,\" \"eternal  life\").--This purely _fictitious world_, greatly to its disadvantage, is  to be differentiated from the world of dreams; the latter at least  reflects reality, whereas the former falsifies it, cheapens it and  denies it. Once the concept of \"nature\" had been opposed to the concept  of \"God,\" the word \"natural\" necessarily took on the meaning of  \"abominable\"--the whole of that fictitious world has its sources in  hatred of the natural (--the real!--), and is no more than evidence of a  profound uneasiness in the presence of reality.... _This explains  everything._ Who alone has any reason for living his way out of reality?  The man who suffers under it. But to suffer from reality one must be a  _botched_ reality.... The preponderance of pains over pleasures is the  cause of this fictitious morality and religion: but such a preponderance  also supplies the formula for _decadence_....      16.    A criticism of the _Christian concept of God_ leads inevitably to the  same conclusion.--A nation that still believes in itself holds fast to  its own god. In him it does honour to the conditions which enable it to  survive, to its virtues--it projects its joy in itself, its feeling of  power, into a being to whom one may offer thanks. He who is rich will  give of his riches; a proud people need a god to whom they can make  _sacrifices_.... Religion, within these limits, is a form of gratitude.  A man is grateful for his own existence: to that end he needs a  god.--Such a god must be able to work both benefits and injuries; he  must be able to play either friend or foe--he is wondered at for the  good he does as well as for the evil he does. But the castration,  against all nature, of such a god, making him a god of goodness alone,  would be contrary to human inclination. Mankind has just as much need  for an evil god as for a good god; it doesn't have to thank mere  tolerance and humanitarianism for its own existence.... What would be  the value of a god who knew nothing of anger, revenge, envy, scorn,  cunning, violence? who had perhaps never experienced the rapturous  _ardeurs_ of victory and of destruction? No one would understand such a  god: why should any one want him?--True enough, when a nation is on the  downward path, when it feels its belief in its own future, its hope of  freedom slipping from it, when it begins to see submission as a first  necessity and the virtues of submission as measures of self-preservation,  then it _must_ overhaul its god. He then becomes a hypocrite, timorous  and demure; he counsels \"peace of soul,\" hate-no-more, leniency, \"love\"  of friend and foe. He moralizes endlessly; he creeps into every private  virtue; he becomes the god of every man; he becomes a private citizen, a  cosmopolitan.... Formerly he represented a people, the strength of a  people, everything aggressive and thirsty for power in the soul of a  people; now he is simply _the good god_.... The truth is that there is  no other alternative for gods: _either_ they are the will to power--in  which case they are national gods--_or_ incapacity for power--in which  case they have to be good....      17.    Wherever the will to power begins to decline, in whatever form, there is  always an accompanying decline physiologically, a _decadence_. The  divinity of this _decadence_, shorn of its masculine virtues and  passions, is converted perforce into a god of the physiologically  degraded, of the weak. Of course, they do not _call_ themselves the  weak; they call themselves \"the good.\"... No hint is needed to indicate  the moments in history at which the dualistic fiction of a good and an  evil god first became possible. The same instinct which prompts the  inferior to reduce their own god to \"goodness-in-itself\" also prompts  them to eliminate all good qualities from the god of their superiors;  they make revenge on their masters by making a _devil_ of the latter's  god.--The _good_ god, and the devil like him--both are abortions of  _decadence_.--How can we be so tolerant of the naivete of Christian  theologians as to join in their doctrine that the evolution of the  concept of god from \"the god of Israel,\" the god of a people, to the  Christian god, the essence of all goodness, is to be described as  _progress_?--But even Renan does this. As if Renan had a right to be  naive! The contrary actually stares one in the face. When everything  necessary to _ascending_ life; when all that is strong, courageous,  masterful and proud has been eliminated from the concept of a god; when  he has sunk step by step to the level of a staff for the weary, a  sheet-anchor for the drowning; when he becomes the poor man's god, the  sinner's god, the invalid's god _par excellence_, and the attribute of  \"saviour\" or \"redeemer\" remains as the one essential attribute of  divinity--just _what_ is the significance of such a metamorphosis?  what does such a _reduction_ of the godhead imply?--To be  sure, the \"kingdom of God\" has thus grown larger. Formerly he had only  his own people, his \"chosen\" people. But since then he has gone  wandering, like his people themselves, into foreign parts; he has given  up settling down quietly anywhere; finally he has come to feel at home  everywhere, and is the great cosmopolitan--until now he has the \"great  majority\" on his side, and half the earth. But this god of the \"great  majority,\" this democrat among gods, has not become a proud heathen god:  on the contrary, he remains a Jew, he remains a god in a corner, a god  of all the dark nooks and crevices, of all the noisesome quarters of the  world!... His earthly kingdom, now as always, is a kingdom of the  underworld, a _souterrain_ kingdom, a ghetto kingdom.... And he himself  is so pale, so weak, so _decadent_.... Even the palest of the pale are  able to master him--messieurs the metaphysicians, those albinos of the  intellect. They spun their webs around him for so long that finally he  was hypnotized, and began to spin himself, and became another  metaphysician. Thereafter he resumed once more his old business of  spinning the world out of his inmost being _sub specie Spinozae_;  thereafter he became ever thinner and paler--became the \"ideal,\" became  \"pure spirit,\" became \"the absolute,\" became \"the thing-in-itself.\"...  _The collapse of a god_: he became a \"thing-in-itself.\"      18.    The Christian concept of a god--the god as the patron of the sick, the  god as a spinner of cobwebs, the god as a spirit--is one of the most  corrupt concepts that has ever been set up in the world: it probably  touches low-water mark in the ebbing evolution of the god-type. God  degenerated into the _contradiction of life_. Instead of being its  transfiguration and eternal Yea! In him war is declared on life, on  nature, on the will to live! God becomes the formula for every slander  upon the \"here and now,\" and for every lie about the \"beyond\"! In him  nothingness is deified, and the will to nothingness is made holy!...      19.    The fact that the strong races of northern Europe did not repudiate this  Christian god does little credit to their gift for religion--and not  much more to their taste. They ought to have been able to make an end of  such a moribund and worn-out product of the _decadence_. A curse lies  upon them because they were not equal to it; they made illness,  decrepitude and contradiction a part of their instincts--and since then  they have not managed to _create_ any more gods. Two thousand years have  come and gone--and not a single new god! Instead, there still exists,  and as if by some intrinsic right,--as if he were the _ultimatum_ and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19331"],[0,"Ceremonial of Hasjelti Dailjis and Mythical Sand Painting of the Navajo Indians (#7)"],[1,"into  groups and drew the food toward them, but did not touch it for a time. The  invalid, song-priest, and his attendants, indulged in a smoke which was  social and not religious, the white man's tobacco being preferred on such  occasions. A girl and a boy, about 12 years of age, came into the lodge.  The boy was the son of the invalid, the girl his sister's child. The boy  knelt at the northeast end of the rug and the girl at the southeast end.  They were richly dressed in Navajo blankets, coral necklaces, etc., and  they remained perfectly quiet. The theurgist and his attendants talked  together in an undertone, and if the inmates of the lodge spoke at all  their voices were scarcely audible. After a time the choir opened, led by  the song-priest with his rattle. During the singing the rattle was passed  from one to the other. The invalid did not join in the song. The choir  continued an hour without cessation, and then rested 2 minutes, and again  began and continued for another hour.(4) At the conclusion of the singing  the song-priest handed to the girl a wand of turkey plumes taken from a  basket of feathers which had stood, since the placing of the masks, on the  west side of him. Another wand was passed to the boy; and the children  received some instructions from the song-priest, who spoke in an  undertone, after which, an attendant filled with water from a wicker water  jug a basket that had stood throughout the ceremony at the east of the  rug.    The song was now resumed, and dipping the wand he held in the basket of  water the boy sprinkled the masks, beginning at the north end and east  row. The girl repeated the same. The east row of masks was sprinkled  twice. When the children sprinkled the middle and west rows, the ceremony  was always begun at the north end of each line of masks; again dipping  their wands in the water, the boy beginning at the north side and the girl  at the south, they sprinkled the inmates of the lodge. The children were  very awkward, and were rendered more so by the many scoldings given them  for their mistakes. The sprinkling of the people was continued until the  water was exhausted. The lodge was also sprinkled at the cardinal points.  The song never ceased throughout this ceremony. The girl and boy, taking  the position first assigned them, an attendant, with a reed filled with  sacred tobacco, puffed the smoke over the masks, smoking each mask  separately on the east row; the middle and west rows he hurriedly passed  over. While this was being done an attendant took a pinch from all the  different foods and placed what he gathered into a basket in the niche  behind the song-priest.(5)  After the masks had been smoked, the attendant  puffed the smoke over all the people, beginning on the north side of the  lodge. During the smoking the song ceased, but was resumed when the  attendant took his seat. At the close of the song sacred meal was mixed  with water in a Zuni pottery bowl. This meal is made of green corn baked  in the earth and then ground. During the preparation of this medicine  mixture the song-priest sang: \"This food is mixed for the people of the  rocks! We feed you with this food, O people of the rocks!\" The theurgist  then dipped his forefinger into the mixture, and running his hand rapidly  over the masks from north to south, he touched each mouth; each line was  passed over four times. The invalid dipped his three first fingers into  the basket, and placing them in his mouth, sucked in his breath with a  loud noise. This was repeated four times by the invalid and then by each  of the attendants, when all the inmates of the lodge were expected to  partake of the mixture. This was done with a prayer for rain, good crops,  health, and riches. All hands now participated in the feast.             FOODS BROUGHT INTO THE LODGE.  Da'ttuneilgaij         Pats made of wheat flour                         and fried.  Tab'aestch'lonni       Corn meal pats wrapped in                         corn husks and boiled.

Tseste'lttsoi          Cakes some fourth of an                         inch thick made from                         sweet corn mixed with                         goat's milk and baked on                         a hot rock.  Tseste'                Bread made of corn first                         toasted and then finely                         ground and made into a                         thin batter which is                         baked upon a highly                         polished lava slab. The                         crisp gauzy sheets are                         folded or rolled.  Tki'neshpipizi         Small balls of corn meal                         mush.

Alkaandt               A bread made from sweet                         corn which is first                         parched then ground on a                         metate and then chewed by                         women and girls and                         placed in a mass in a                         flat basket; this must be                         either of yellow or white                         corn, the blue corn is                         never used for this                         purpose. A mush is made                         of either white or yellow                         corn meal and the former                         preparation which has                         become yeast is stirred                         into the mush. A hole is                         then dug in the ground                         (near the fire) and lined                         with shucks into which                         the mush is poured, it is                         then covered with shucks                         after which earth is                         thrown over it and a                         large fire built which                         burns all night. In the                         early morning the cinders                         and coals are removed                         when the bread is found                         to be baked.  Tkleheljoe             Yeast is prepared for                         this bread in the same                         manner as that for the                         Alkaandt except that the                         corn is baked instead of                         parched. The yeast is                         then mixed with meal into                         a stiff dough and baked                         in corn husks, four pats                         are placed in each                         package.  Ta'naetnil (beverage)   Is the same preparation                         as the yeast used in the                         Alkaandt except in this                         case a drink is made of                         it by pouring boiling                         water over it.  Diz'etso               Peaches (fresh or dried)                         stewed. There were also                         several large bowls of                         stewed mutton.    Little groups of threes and fives were formed over the floor of the lodge;  others less fortunate were closely packed together around the outer edge  of the lodge and could procure their food only through the generosity of  their neighbors. The girl and boy left the lodge after having partaken of  the sacred meal mixture. After refreshment the song-priest lifted each  mask with his left hand beginning with Hasjelti, and first extending his  right hand, which held a fine large crystal, toward the heavens, he  touched the under part of each mask with the crystal; four times he passed  over the masks. The choir sang but no rattle was used. The crystal was  afterward placed on the rug opposite the basket of feathers. The food  vessels were removed and the song continued for a time when the  song-priest repeated a long low prayer, after which the song was resumed,  and thus the night was consumed in prayer and song over the masks.            FIFTH DAY.          FIRST CEREMONY.      A basket of yucca suds was prepared by an attendant, who cleansed his  hands of the suds by pouring a gourd of clear water over them; he then put  a handful of the suds upon the head of a man who stood before him, nude  with the exception of a breech cloth, after which the man washed his head  from a water jug which was held over the head of the bather by the  attendant. The bather covered his body with the suds, and the contents of  the jug was emptied on the floor of the lodge by the attendant. The man  dressed himself in the ordinary cotton clothing with rare beads around his  neck, and a leather pouch held by a band of mountain sheep skin over his  shoulders; he knelt before a bowl of white kaolin which he spread over his  face; he then took his seat between two attendants, the one to the right  of him holding a pinch of native tobacco and the one on the left holding  corn meal in the palms of the right hands.    At early dawn the buffalo robe at the entrance of the lodge was slightly  dropped from the doorway to admit the rays of"]]]
