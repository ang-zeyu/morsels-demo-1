These are  described by Professor Wilson as follows:--    \"1st. _Salya._--The art of extracting extraneous substances, violently  or accidentally introduced into the body, with the treatment of the  inflammation and suppuration thereby induced.    \"The word _Salya_ means a dart or arrow, and points clearly to the  origin of this branch of Hindoo science.    \"2nd. _Salakya._--The treatment of external affections or diseases of  the eyes, nose, ears, &c.    \"3rd, _Kayao Chikitsa._--The general application of medicine to the  body, or the science of medicine, as opposed to surgery under the two  first heads.    \"4th. _Bhutavidya_, or demonology: the act of casting out demons, which  we may take to mean the treatment of insanity, such as it was.    \"5th. _Kaumara bhritya_, or the treatment of the diseases of women and  children.    \"6th. _Agada._--The administration of antidotes.    \"We do not appreciate this as an eastern nation would when poison was  only too common an instrument of ambition or revenge.    \"7th. _Rasayana._--Is chemistry, or perhaps it were better to say  alchemy, as its chief aim was the study of combinations of substances  mostly metallurgic, with a view of obtaining the universal medicine or  elixir which was to give immortal life.    \"8th. _Bajikarana._--Was connected with the means of promoting the  increase of the human race.\"    One of the articles of Hindoo medicine was _Kshara_ or alkaline  salts,--these are directed to be obtained by burning different  substances of vegetable origin, boiling the ashes with five or six times  their measure of water and filtering the solution, which was used both  internally and externally. Care is enjoined in their use, and emollient  applications are to be used if the caustic should occasion great pain.    I have already spoken of the fact of Indian physicians having been at  the Court of Persia, and also at that of Haroun al Raschid, and also  that the ancient writers on medicine were known to the Arabs of the time  of the schools of Baghdad and Cordova. There is no manner of doubt  concerning this fact, as in Serapion's works we find Charak actually  mentioned by name; under the head _De Mirobalanis_ we find \"_Et Xarch  indus dixit;_\" and again, in another section \"_Xarcha indus;_\" there  being no corresponding sound to che in Arabic, there is a slight change  in the name, but it is quite clear what it is intended for. In Avicenna,  again, we find reference to \"Scirak indum.\" Rhazes, again, who was  previous to Avicenna, has \"_Inquit Scarac indianus_,\" and again \"_Dixit  Sarac;_\" in another place an Indian author is quoted, who has not as yet  been traced, \"_Sindifar_,\" or, as it is in another place, \"_Sindichar  indianus._\"    Professor Wilson, in a notice on the medical science of the Hindoos,  published in the _Oriental Magazine_, examines into the distinctive  qualities of the various sorts of leeches, and shows that the  description given in Avicenna, in the section \"De Sanguisugis,\" is  almost identical with the Hindoo author's description of the twelve  sorts of leeches, in distinguishing the appearance and properties of the  various sorts.    That this is more than a mere coincidence is clear from the fact that  Avicenna says \"_Indi dixerunt_.\"    I do not think it will be seriously disputed that the Arabs had access  to the Hindoo works of and before their time, and we will find, if we  carefully examine the subject, that the science of medicine as  distinguished from surgery, and of chemistry as a part of that science  of medicine, was much more ancient than we have been prepared to admit.    It would be incredible to believe that amongst a people so observant and  highly cultured as the Brahmins must have been, that medicine and the  changes occurring in mixtures of various substances should have been  unstudied, and there is no doubt that this subject was far from being  neglected by them.    Many natural productions of the country, such as nitrate of potash,  borax, carbonate and sulphate of soda, sulphate of iron, alum, common  salt, and sulphur, could scarcely escape the notice of even ordinary  men; but Dr. Ainslie has shown, from the evidence of old Indian medical  works, that they were not only acquainted with ammonia (which they made  by distilling salammoniac one part, and chalk two parts), but that they  prepared sulphuric acid by burning sulphur and nitre together in earthen  pots, calling it _Gunduk Ka Attar_, or \"attar of sulphur.\" Nitric acid,  which was prepared, not by the process described by Geber, but by mixing  saltpetre, alum, and a portion of a liquor obtained by spreading cloths  over the common gram plant, and leaving them exposed to the dew, when  they were found to absorb the acid salt so abundantly secreted by the  plant on the surface of its leaves, and which, when examined by  Vauquelin, was found to contain both oxalic and acetic acids.    Muriatic acid was also made by distilling alum and common salt, dried  and pounded with the above acid liquor.    Arsenic was used by them for the cure of palsy, and also for venereal  diseases, and is still used by them for this purpose, and in  intermittent fevers.    It would occupy too much time to go further into this subject at the  present time, but there are many chemical compounds which are still made  and sold in the Indian bazaars which have been used from time  immemorial, and which require a knowledge of chemical manipulation in  the arts of subliming, distilling, &c.    Mr. Rodwell says, \"that the distillation of cinnabar with iron,  described by Dioscorides, is the first crude example of distillation,  which afterwards became a principal operation among the alchemists and  chemists for separating the volatile from the fixed.\"    That this is an assumption which has no foundation in fact is evident,  when we find in the Institutes of Menu many enactments against the  drinking of distilled spirits, and these made of various kinds and  distilled from molasses (or sugar-cane juice), rice, and the madhuca  flowers.    \"A soldier or merchant drinking arak, mead, or rum are to be considered  offenders in the highest degree,\" and \"for drinking spirits are to be  branded on the forehead with a vintner's flag,\" rather a summary way of  treating a drunkard, and one which would indicate that the ill effects  of over-indulgence in spirituous liquors had been long known, when such  severe enactments were made against it.    The method of distilling described by Mr. Kerr in the Asiatic  Researches, vol. 1, is so simple that it is almost certain that it was  employed in very ancient times for the purpose of distilling spirits,  and also attars of various sorts, which, from time immemorial, would  seem to have been a special production of India.    \"The body of the still is a common large unglazed earthen water jar,  nearly globular, of about 25 inches diameter at the widest part of it,  and 22 inches deep to the neck, which neck rises 2 inches more, and is  11 inches wide in the opening; this was filled about a half with  fermented mahwah flowers, which swam about in the liquor to be  distilled.    \"This jar they placed in a furnace, not the most artificial, though not  seemingly ill adapted to give a great heat with but very little fuel.  This they made by digging a round hole in the ground, about 20 inches  wide and full 3 feet deep, cutting an opening in the front sloping down  to the bottom, perpendicular at the sides, about 9 inches wide and about  15 inches long, reckoning from the edge of the circle: this is to serve  to throw in the wood and to allow a passage for the air; at the other  side a small opening about 4 inches by 3 inches is made to serve as an  outlet for the smoke, the bottom of the hole thus made was rounded like  a cup.    \"The jar was placed in this as far as it would go, and banked up with  clay all round to about a fifth of its height, except at the two  openings, when all was completed so far as the furnace was concerned.    \"Fully one third of the still or jar was exposed to the heat when  the fire was lighted; the fuel was at least 2 feet from the bottom  of the jar.    \"On to this jar there was now fitted what is called an adkur, this being  made of two earthen pans with their bottoms turned towards each other,  and a hole of about 4 inches diameter in the middle of each of them, the  lower of these pans fitted the hole in the jar, and was luted with clay,  the upper was luted to the lower one, and had a diameter of about 14  inches, the juncture formed a neck of about 3 inches, the upper pan was  about 4 inches deep, with a rim round the central hole, this formed a  gutter, and by means of a hollow bamboo luted to this, the spirit, as it  condensed, ran off into the receiver.    \"The arrangement was now completed by luting on a small copper pot or  vessel about 5 inches deep, 8 inches wide at mouth, and about 10 inches  at bottom, with its mouth downwards.    \"The cooler was formed by placing on a support at the back of the  furnace an earthen vessel containing a few gallons of water, from which,  by means of a bamboo tube, the water was allowed to run on to the centre  of the copper pot, from where it collected in the clay saucer, and ran  off by a small hole and bamboo tube for use again.    \"In about three hours' time from lighting the fire, they draw off fully  fifteen bottles of spirits.\"    Comparing this simple form of apparatus with those described by Geber,  we must admit that there is no doubt of the earlier date of this simple  apparatus; and, as we have seen, distilled spirit is expressly mentioned  in the Institutes of Menu, we are bound to admit that distillation was  in use long ere the Arabian times and that of Dioscorides.    Many such examples might be examined, but I will take one for  illustration--that of the manufacture of common salt.    Let us take this manufacture as a typical one.    We find in Jackson's "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17760"],[0,"How to Enjoy Paris in 1842 (#7)"],[1,"eets; the one chosen last year weighed 3,800 French pounds, and as  there are two ounces more than in the English pound the immense size of  the animal may be imagined. In the winter, they fatten their beasts with  hay, clover and corn, but oilcake is not known except in a few  instances, when beasts are fattened for prizes or exhibitions. Their  agricultural implements are in keeping with the rest of their system; I  have seen them ploughing even in the lightest land, with the great old  heavy turnwrest ploughs and four bulky horses, which might have been  effected just as well with a light Rotherham plough and one horse.  Recently, however, I have seen some slight ameliorations, and those  parts of France which are nearest England one might expect would improve  the soonest. The farming servants are generally a hard-working, quiet,  sober people, contented with very little, their living costing them a  mere trifle; in harvest-time an Englishman will pour beer down his  throat that will cost as much as would keep a whole French family; there  is a natural economy in their habits that tends to making their wages  more than equal to their demand. An Englishman must have the best  wheaten bread, and when he gets a pound of meat he is ready to eat it  all himself; the Frenchman is contented with a cheap brown bread, quite  as wholesome as the finest, and to his portion of meat he adds some  vegetables with which soup is made, and it gives comfort to the whole  family; and it is quite a mistake to imagine that beer and animal food  produce greater physical strength, as I have in several instances proved  that the French porter will carry much more than the English. I remember  when lodging in Salisbury Street, in the Strand, having packed up my  things for my departure for Paris, when a porter came to carry them to  the Golden Cross, he said it was impossible that any man could take them  at once, and the people of the house joined in saying that it was far  beyond one man's load, consisting of a moderate sized trunk, a large  portmanteau, and a well-stuffed carpet bag; when I declared that the  first porter I should meet with at Paris would take them all the same  distance without raising an objection, a sort of smile of incredulity  passed from one to the other, expressive of how absurd they thought such  an assertion. On arriving at Paris, however, the very first porter I  spoke to in the Diligence-yard took them all, without a question as to  their weight. In several cases, when persons have been quitting London  for Paris with me, I have proved to them how much heavier a burthen the  French porters will carry than the English. I believe the cause arises  in a great degree from the latter not being addicted to drinking ardent  spirits, which is ruinous to the strength and constitutions of such  numbers of the lower classes in London. But the Greek and Turkish  porters will carry twice as much as the French, and their beverage is  nothing but water and their food principally rice. In almost every  description of labour the Englishman has the advantage when what may be  styled knack or method be required; the consequence is, that they make  the most of what physical strength they possess; hence he will plough,  mow, or reap more in a day than a Frenchman. Not only is the machinery  which the Englishman employs much better, but he is what may be termed  more handy in making use of it; in every thing which relates to  husbandry or mechanism the Frenchman is generally awkward; a more  powerful instance cannot be cited than that of their always employing  two men to shoe a horse, one man being occupied to hold up the horse's  leg, whilst the farrier performs his part of the work; is it not  astonishing that after an uninterrupted communication with England for  twenty-seven years, that they should never have observed, that an  English farrier, by taking the animal's leg between his own, is able to  effect his purpose just as well as if two men were employed; but the  French must have remarked that custom in England; only, the besotted  prejudice that exists in that class against every species of innovation  causes them to persevere in their old habits. The agricultural  population in France are more wealthy and generally better clothed than  ours, particularly as regards the women; they pride themselves much upon  their stocks of linen and their bedding; instead of the men expending  their money in drink, what little they can save beyond their daily wants  they lay out in contributing to their solid comforts, and as spinning  and knitting are the constant occupation of the women in their leisure  hours, when their children marry they are enabled to furnish them with a  portion of the fruits of their industry; even the peasant girl has a  trousseau, as it is called, that is, some stock of linen at her  marriage, and a trifle of money wherewith to begin the world. Thus take  France throughout; it will be found, that, in consequence of temperance  and a persevering industry, the peasantry are generally passively happy;  there is a great difference in respect to their wages and comforts,  according to the province to which they belong; but although the  intention of this work is especially to treat upon Paris and its  population, yet as my readers must pass through a considerable portion  of France before they can arrive at Paris, I judged it right to give  them some information of the manners and habits of the population, with  which they must meet in the course of their journey; but without farther  delay will now at once conduct them to the Grand Capital, and as I  consider the first impressions are the most permanent, I will introduce  them by that entrance which presents so grand an appearance, as to  surpass that of any other country in Europe. In coming from England,  they may enter Paris at this point by the Rouen road.    The first object that strikes the traveller, as he approaches Paris, is  the Triumphal Arch, erected with the view of commemorating the victories  of Napoleon, but as those victories were ultimately crowned by defeat,  it is more consistent to consider the Triumphal Arch as a triumph of art  than of arms; as certainly the magnificence and sublimity of the design  is only to be equalled by the exquisite beauty of the execution. Having  passed this noble monument and splendid specimen of architectural  talent, the Champs Elysees extend in all their beauty to the view of the  beholder, presenting a fine broad road with rows of lofty trees on  either side, whilst handsome buildings and superb fountains are  occasionally visible from behind the foliage; and one of the latter,  which rises exactly in the centre, has a most happy effect; from this  circle several roads diverge in different directions, displaying various  objects of interest, but none of so high an order as that of the  Hospital of Invalids, for aged and wounded soldiers, the whole expanse  of which is seen in the distance at the end of a long wide avenue of  trees. From the Triumphal Arch on either side extends a row of  ornamental lamps for nearly a mile, which when lighted have the most  brilliant effect; and when it is considered how very small the  distances are between each lamp, I believe the assertion to be correct,  that there is not another such display of gas anywhere to be found.  Arrived at the Place Louis Quinze, or Place de la Concorde, as it is now  called, such a coup d'oeil is presented as remains unrivalled in  Europe, or indeed, in any part of the world. On one side, at the end of  a handsome and regular street, called the Rue Royale, rises in majestic  height the Madeleine, with its noble columns crowned by its sculptured  entablature in mezzo relievo, and adorned by its numerous statues, yet  preserving a chaste simplicity throughout the whole. On the opposite  side facing it, in a direct line at the end of a bridge, is the Chamber  of Deputies, resembling a Roman temple; its style is severe and its  _tout ensemble_ has an air of heavy grandeur, which is consistent with  an edifice in which are to be discussed the affairs of so great a  nation. In the centre of the Place is an Egyptian column, which was with  much difficulty brought from Egypt, and raised with considerable  ingenuity where it now stands, without any accident; gorgeous fountains  of bronze and gold are constantly playing, whilst colossal statues,  being allegorical representations of the principal towns of France, are  placed at regular distances, and appear as it were in solemn  contemplation of the splendid scene by which they are surrounded. Two  noble buildings, the Garde Meuble and the Hotel de la Marine, which may  be styled palaces, adorn each side of the Rue Royale, and form one side  of the magnificent square, whilst another is occupied by the Elysian  Fields, and that immediately opposite to the Tuileries gardens; but so  beautiful, so wonderful is the whole combined, that accustomed as I have  been to frequent it for upwards of twenty years, I cannot now traverse  it without remaining some time to admire the extraordinary combination  of so many beautiful objects centering in one vast area. Here no mean or  unseemly building meets the eye, but all is made tributary to one grand  effect; even the lamps with their supporters are of bronze and gold,  whilst in the distance the gilded dome of the Invalides peers above all,  and gives a brilliant termination to the sublimity of the scene.

In entering  from Boulogne or Calais, nothing can be conceived more discouraging than  the first appearance of Paris as you are borne"]]]
