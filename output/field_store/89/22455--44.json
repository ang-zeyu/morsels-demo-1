It is, moreover, from Quebec  to the Falls of St. Mary, almost a flat surface, intersected and  interlaced by numberless streams, and studded with small lakes, whilst  its littorale is a river unparalleled in the world, expanding into  enormous fresh water seas, abounding with fish.    If the tropical luxuries are absent, if its winters are long and  excessively severe, yet it yields all the European fruits abundantly,  and even some of the tropical ones, owing to the richness of its soil  and the great heat of the summer. Maize, or Indian corn, flourishes, and  is more wholesome and better than that produced in the warm South. The  crops of potato, that apple of the earth, as the French so justly term  it, are equal, if not superior, to those of any other climate; whilst  all the vegetables of the temperate regions of the old world grow with  greater luxuriance than in their original fields. I have successively  and successfully cultivated the tomato, the melon, and the capsicum, in  the open air, for several seasons, at Kingston and Toronto, which are  not the richest or the best parts of Western Canada, as far as  vegetation is concerned. Tobacco grows well in the western district, and  where is finer wheat harvested than in Western Canada?--whilst hay, and  that beauty of a landscape, the rich green sod, the velvet carpet of the  earth, are abundant and luxuriant.    If the majesty of vegetation is called in question, and intertropical  plants brought forward in contrast, even the woods and trackless  forests of Guiana, where the rankest of luxuriance prevails, will not do  more than compete with the glory of the primeval woods of Canada. I know  of nothing in this world capable of exciting emotions of wonder and  adoration more directly, than to travel alone through its forests.  Pines, lifting their hoary tops beyond man's vision, unless he inclines  his head so far backwards as to be painful to his organization, with  trunks which require fathoms of line to span them; oaks, of the most  gigantic form; the immense and graceful weeping elm; enormous poplars,  whose magnitude must be seen to be conceived; lindens, equally vast;  walnut trees of immense size; the beautiful birch, and the wild cherry,  large enough to make tables and furniture of.    Oh, the gloom and the glory of these forests, and the deep reflection  that, since they were first created by the Divine fiat, civilized man  has never desecrated them with his unsparing devastations; that a  peculiar race, born for these solitudes, once dwelt amidst their  shades, living as Nature's woodland children, until a more subtile being  than the serpent of Eden crept amongst them, and, with his glittering  novelties and dangerous beauty, caused their total annihilation! I see,  in spirit, the red hunter, lofty, fearless, and stern, stalking in his  painted nudity, and displaying a form which Apollo might have envied,  amidst the everlasting and silent woods; I see, in spirit, the bearded  stranger from the rising sun, with his deadly arms and his more deadly  fire-water, conversing with his savage fellow, and displaying the envied  wealth of gorgeous beads and of gaudy clothing.    The scene changes, the proud Indian is at the feet of his ensnarer;  disease has relaxed his iron sinews; drunkenness has debased his mind;  and the myriad crimes and vices of civilized Europe have combined to  sweep the aborigines of the soil from the face of the forest earth. The  forest groans beneath the axe; but, after a few years, the scene again  changes; fertile fields, orchards and gardens, delight the eye; the  city, and the town, and the village spires rise, and where two solitary  wigwams of the red hunter were once alone occasionally observed, twenty  thousand white Canadians now worship the same Great Author of the  existence of all mankind.    And to increase these fields, these orchards, these gardens, these  villages, these towns, and these cities, year after year, thirty  thousand of the children of Britain cross the broad Atlantic: and what  seeks this mass of human beings, braving the perils of the ocean and the  perils of the land? Competence and wealth! The former, by prudence, is  soon attainable; the acquisition of the latter uncertain and fickle.    No free grants of land are now given, but the settler may obtain them  upon easy terms from the government, or the Canada and British American  companies.    The settler with a small capital cannot do better than purchase out and  out. Instalments are a bad mode of purchasing; for, if all should not  turn out right, instalments are sometimes difficult to meet; and the  very best land, in the best locations, as we shall hereafter see, is to  be had from 7s. 6d., if in the deep Bush, as the forest is called; to  10s., if nearer a market; or 15s. and 20s., if very eligibly situated.  Thus for two hundred pounds a settler can buy two hundred acres of good  land, can build an excellent house for two hundred and fifty more, and  stock his farm with another fifty, as a beginning; or, in other words,  he can commence Canadian life for five hundred pounds sterling, with  every prospect before him, if he has a family, of leaving them  prosperous and happy. But he and they must work, work, work. He and all  his sons must avoid whiskey, that bane of the backwoods, as they would  avoid the rattlesnake, which sometimes comes across their path. Whiskey  and wet feet destroy more promising young men in Canada than ague and  fever, that scourge of all well watered woody countries; for the ague  and fever seldom kill but with the assistance of the dram and of  exposure.    Men nurtured in luxury or competence at home, as soon as the unfailing  _ennui_ arising from want of society in the backwoods begins to succeed  the excitement of settling, too frequently drink, and in many cases  drink from their waking hour until they sink at night into sottish  sleep. This is peculiarly the case where there is no village nor town  within a day's journey; and thus many otherwise estimable young men  become habitual drunkards, and sink from the caste of gentlemen  gradually into the dregs of society, whilst their wives and families  suffer proportionably.    In Lower Canada, this vice does not prevail to the same extent as in the  upper portion of the province. The French Canadians are not addicted to  the vice of drinking ardent spirits as a people, although the lumberers  and voyageurs shorten their lives very considerably by the use of  whiskey. The _lumberers_, who are the cutters and conveyers of timber,  pass a short and excited existence.    In the winter, buried in the eternal forest, far, far away from the  haunts of man, they chop and hew; in the summer, they form the timber,  boards, staves, &c., into rafts, which are conveyed down the great lakes  and the rivers St. Lawrence and Ottawa to Quebec--on these rafts they  live and have their summer being. Hard fare in plenty, such as salt pork  and dough cakes; fat and unleavened bread, with whiskey, is their diet.  Tea and sugar form an occasional luxury. Up to their waists in snow in  winter, and up to their waists in summer and autumn in water, with all  the moving accidents by flood and field; the occasional breaking-up of  the raft in a rapid, the difficulty of the winter and spring transport  of the heavy logs of squared timber out of the deep and trackless woods,  combine to form a portion of the hard and reckless life of a lumberer,  whose _morale_ is not much better than his _physicale_.    Picture to yourself, child of luxury, sitting on a cushioned sofa, in a  room where the velvet carpet renders a footfall noiseless, where art is  exhausted to afford comfort, and where even the hurricane cannot disturb  your perusal of this work, a wood reaching without limit, excepting the  oceans either of salt or fresh water which surround Canada, and where to  lose the track is hopeless starvation and death; figure the giant pines  towering to the clouds, gloomy and Titan-like, throwing their vast arms  to the skyey influences, and making a twilight of mid-day, at whose  enormous feet a thicket of bushes, almost as high as your head, prevents  your progress without the pioneer axe; or a deep and black swamp for  miles together renders it necessary to crawl from one fallen monarch of  the wood onwards to the decaying and prostrate bole of another, with an  occasional plunge into the mud and water, which they bridge; eternal  silence reigning, disturbed only by your feeble efforts to advance; and  you may form some idea of a red pine land, rocky and uneven, or a cedar  swamp, black as night, dark, dismal, and dangerous.    Here, after you have hewed or crept your toiling way, you see, some  yards or some hundred yards, as the forest is close or open, before  you, a light blue curling smoke amongst the dank and lugubrious scene;  you hear a dull, distant, heavy, sudden blow, frequent and deadened,  followed at long intervals by a tremendous rending, crashing,  overwhelming rush; then all is silent, till the voice of the guardian of  man is heard growling, snarling, or barking outright, as you advance  towards the blue smoke, which has now, by an eddy of the wind, filled a  large space between the trees.    You stand before the fire, made under three or four sticks set up  tenwise, to which a large cauldron is hung, bubbling and seething, with  a very strong odour of fat pork; a boy, dirty and ill-favoured, with a  sharp glittering axe, looks very suspiciously at you, but calls off his  wolfish dog, who sneaks away.    A moment shows you a long hut, formed of logs of wood, with a roof of  branches, covered by birch-bark, and by its side, or near the fire,  several nondescript sties or pens, apparently for keeping pigs in,  formed of branches close to the ground, either like a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20019"],[0,"Lectures on Landscape (#7)"],[1,"an equally  lighted blue of inimitable depth and loveliness.    It is impossible for you ever to see a more noble work of passionate  Greek chiaroscuro--rejoicing in light. From this I should like you to  go instantly to Rembrandt's \"Portrait of a Burgomaster\" (No. 77 in the  Exhibition of Old Masters).    59. That is ignobly passionate chiaroscuro, rejoicing in darkness  rather than light.    You cannot see a finer work by Rembrandt. It has all his power of  rendering character, and the portrait is celebrated through the world.  But it is entirely second-rate work. The character in the face is only  striking to persons who like candle-light effects better than  sunshine; any head by Titian has twice the character, and seen by  daylight instead of gas. The rest of the picture is as false in light  and shade as it is pretentious, made up chiefly of gleaming buttons in  places where no light could possibly reach them; and of an embossed  belt on the shoulder, which people think finely painted because it is  all over lumps of color, not one of which was necessary. That embossed  execution of Rembrandt's is just as much ignorant work as the embossed  projecting jewels of Carlo Crivelli; a real painter never loads (see  the Velasquez, No. 415 in the same exhibition).    60. Finally, from the Rembrandt go to the little Cima (No. 93), \"St.  Mark.\" Thus you have the Sandro Botticelli, of the noble Greek school  in Florence; the Rembrandt, of the debased Greek school in Holland;  and the Cima, of the pure color school of Venice.    The Cima differs from the Rembrandt, by being lovely; from the  Botticelli, by being simple and calm. The painter does not desire the  excitement of rapid movement, nor even the passion of beautiful light.  But he hates darkness as he does death; and falsehood more than  either. He has painted a noble human creature simply in clear  daylight; not in rapture, nor yet in agony. He is dressed neither in a  rainbow, nor bedraggled with blood. You are neither to be alarmed nor  entertained by anything that is likely to happen to him. You are not  to be improved by the piety of his expression, nor disgusted by its  truculence. But there is more true mastery of light and shade, if your  eye is subtle enough to see it, in the hollows and angles of the  architecture and folds of the dress, than in all the etchings of  Rembrandt put together. The unexciting color will not at first delight  you; but its charm will never fail; and from all the works of  variously strained and obtrusive power with which it is surrounded,  you will find that you never return to it but with a sense of relief  and of peace, which can only be given you by the tender skill which is  wholly without pretense, without pride, and without error.          III.    COLOR.      61. The distinctions between schools of art which I have so often  asked you to observe are, you must be aware, founded only on the  excess of certain qualities in one group of painters over another, or  the difference in their tendencies; and not in the absolute possession  by one group, and absence in the rest, of any given skill. But this  impossibility of drawing trenchant lines of parting need never  interfere with the distinctness of our conception of the opponent  principles which balance each other in great minds, or paralyze each  other in weak ones; and I cannot too often urge you to keep clearly  separate in your thoughts the school which I have called[11] \"of  Crystal,\" because its distinctive virtue is seen unaided in the sharp  separations and prismatic harmonies of painted glass, and the other,  the \"School of Clay,\" because its distinctive virtue is seen in the  qualities of any fine work in uncolored terra cotta, and in every  drawing which represents them.    [Footnote 11: \"Lectures on Art, 1870,\" Sec. 185.]    62. You know I sometimes speak of these generally as the Gothic and  Greek schools, sometimes as the colorist and chiaroscurist. All these  oppositions are liable to infinite qualification and gradation, as  between species of animals; and you must not be troubled, therefore,  if sometimes momentary contradictions seem to arise in examining  special points. Nay, the modes of opposition in the greatest men are  inlaid and complex; difficult to explain, though in themselves clear.  Thus you know in your study of sculpture we saw that the essential aim  of the Greek art was tranquil action; the chief aim of Gothic art  was passionate rest, a peace, an eternity of intense sentiment. As I  go into detail, I shall continually therefore have to oppose Gothic  passion to Greek temperance; yet Gothic rigidity, [Greek: stasis] of  [Greek: ekstasis], to Greek action and [Greek: eleutheria]. You see  how doubly, how intimately, opposed the ideas are; yet how difficult  to explain without apparent contradiction.    63. Now, to-day, I must guard you carefully against a misapprehension  of this kind. I have told you that the Greeks as Greeks made real and  material what was before indefinite; they turned the clouds and the  lightning of Mount Ithome into the human flesh and eagle upon the  extended arm of the Messenian Zeus. And yet, being in all things set  upon absolute veracity and realization, they perceive as they work and  think forward that to see in all things truly is to see in all things  dimly and through hiding of cloud and fire.    So that the schools of Crystal, visionary, passionate, and fantastic  in purpose, are, in method, trenchantly formal and clear; and the  schools of Clay, absolutely realistic, temperate, and simple in  purpose, are, in method, mysterious and soft; sometimes licentious,  sometimes terrific, and always obscure.    [Illustration: MADONNA AND CHILD.    From the painting by Filippo Lippi.]    64. Look once more at this Greek dancing-girl, which is from a terra  cotta, and therefore intensely of the school of Clay; look at her  beside this Madonna of Filippo Lippi's: Greek motion against Gothic  absolute quietness; Greek indifference--dancing careless--against  Gothic passion, the mother's--what word can I use except frenzy of  love; Greek fleshliness against hungry wasting of the self-forgetful  body; Greek softness of diffused shadow and ductile curve, against  Gothic lucidity of color and acuteness of angle; and Greek simplicity  and cold veracity against Gothic rapture of trusted vision.    65. And now I may safely, I think, go into our work of to-day without  confusing you, except only in this. You will find me continually  speaking of four men--Titian, Holbein, Turner, and Tintoret--in  almost the same terms. They unite every quality; and sometimes you  will find me referring to them as colorists, sometimes as  chiaroscurists. Only remember this, that Holbein and Turner are Greek  chiaroscurists, nearly perfect by adopted color; Titian and Tintoret  are essentially Gothic colorists, quite perfect by adopted  chiaroscuro.    66. I used the word \"prismatic\" just now of the schools of Crystal, as  being iridescent. By being studious of color they are studious of  division; and while the chiaroscurist devotes himself to the  representation of degrees of force in one thing--unseparated light,  the colorists have for their function the attainment of beauty by  arrangement of the divisions of light. And therefore, primarily, they  must be able to divide; so that elementary exercises in color must be  directed, like first exercises in music, to the clear separation of  notes; and the final perfections of color are those in which, of  innumerable notes or hues, every one has a distinct office, and can be  fastened on by the eye, and approved, as fulfilling it.    67. I do not doubt that it has often been matter of wonder among any  of you who had faith in my judgment, why I gave to the University, as  characteristic of Turner's work, the simple and at first unattractive  drawings of the Loire series. My first and principal reason was that  they enforced beyond all resistance, on any student who might attempt  to copy them, this method of laying portions of distinct hue side by  side. Some of the touches, indeed, when the tint has been mixed with  much water, have been laid in little drops or ponds, so that the  pigment might crystallize hard at the edge. And one of the chief  delights which any one who really enjoys painting finds in that art as  distinct from sculpture is in this exquisite inlaying or joiner's work  of it, the fitting of edge to edge with a manual skill precisely  correspondent to the close application of crowded notes without the  least slur, in fine harp or piano playing.    68. In many of the finest works of color on a large scale there is  even some admission of the quality given to a painted window by the  dark lead bars between the pieces of glass. Both Tintoret and  Veronese, when they paint on dark grounds, continually stop short with  their tints just before they touch others, leaving the dark ground  showing between in a narrow bar. In the Paul Veronese in the National  Gallery, you will every here and there find pieces of outline, like  this of Holbein's; which you would suppose were drawn, as that is,  with a brown pencil. But no! Look close, and you will find they are  the dark ground, _left_ between two tints brought close to each other  without touching.    [Illustration: THE LADY WITH THE BROOCH.    From the painting by Reynolds.]    69. It follows also from this law of construction that any master who  can color can always do any pane of his window that he likes,  separately from the rest. Thus, you see, here is one of Sir Joshua's  first sittings: the head is very nearly done with the first color; a  piece of background is put in round it: his sitter has had a pretty  silver brooch on, which Reynolds, having done as much as he chose to  the face for that time, paints quietly in its place below, leaving the  dress between to be fitted in afterwards; and he puts a little patch"]]]
