The best match in the world will not light a  candle unless the wick be first suitably prepared.\"    It was Laidlaw's turn to sigh. He knew so well the impossibility of  arguing with his chief when he was in the regions of the mystic, but at  the same time the respect he felt for his tremendous attainments was so  sincere that he always listened with attention and deference, wondering  how far the great man would go and to what end this curious combination  of logic and \"illumination\" would eventually lead him.    \"Only last night,\" continued the elder man, a sort of light coming into  his rugged features, \"the vision came to me again--the one that has  haunted me at intervals ever since my youth, and that will not be  denied.\"    Dr. Laidlaw fidgeted in his chair.    \"About the Tablets of the Gods, you mean--and that they lie somewhere  hidden in the sands,\" he said patiently. A sudden gleam of interest came  into his face as he turned to catch the professor's reply.    \"And that I am to be the one to find them, to decipher them, and to give  the great knowledge to the world--\"    \"Who will not believe,\" laughed Laidlaw shortly, yet interested in spite  of his thinly-veiled contempt.    \"Because even the keenest minds, in the right sense of the word, are  hopelessly--unscientific,\" replied the other gently, his face positively  aglow with the memory of his vision. \"Yet what is more likely,\" he  continued after a moment's pause, peering into space with rapt eyes that  saw things too wonderful for exact language to describe, \"than that  there should have been given to man in the first ages of the world some  record of the purpose and problem that had been set him to solve? In a  word,\" he cried, fixing his shining eyes upon the face of his perplexed  assistant, \"that God's messengers in the far-off ages should have given  to His creatures some full statement of the secret of the world, of the  secret of the soul, of the meaning of life and death--the explanation of  our being here, and to what great end we are destined in the ultimate  fullness of things?\"    Dr. Laidlaw sat speechless. These outbursts of mystical enthusiasm he  had witnessed before. With any other man he would not have listened to  a single sentence, but to Professor Ebor, man of knowledge and profound  investigator, he listened with respect, because he regarded this  condition as temporary and pathological, and in some sense a reaction  from the intense strain of the prolonged mental concentration of many  days.    He smiled, with something between sympathy and resignation as he met the  other's rapt gaze.    \"But you have said, sir, at other times, that you consider the ultimate  secrets to be screened from all possible--\"    \"The _ultimate_ secrets, yes,\" came the unperturbed reply; \"but that  there lies buried somewhere an indestructible record of the secret  meaning of life, originally known to men in the days of their pristine  innocence, I am convinced. And, by this strange vision so often  vouchsafed to me, I am equally sure that one day it shall be given to me  to announce to a weary world this glorious and terrific message.\"    And he continued at great length and in glowing language to describe the  species of vivid dream that had come to him at intervals since earliest  childhood, showing in detail how he discovered these very Tablets of the  Gods, and proclaimed their splendid contents--whose precise nature was  always, however, withheld from him in the vision--to a patient and  suffering humanity.    \"The _Scrutator_, sir, well described 'Pilgrim' as the Apostle of  Hope,\" said the young doctor gently, when he had finished; \"and now, if  that reviewer could hear you speak and realize from what strange depths  comes your simple faith--\"    The professor held up his hand, and the smile of a little child broke  over his face like sunshine in the morning.    \"Half the good my books do would be instantly destroyed,\" he said sadly;  \"they would say that I wrote with my tongue in my cheek. But wait,\" he  added significantly; \"wait till I find these Tablets of the Gods! Wait  till I hold the solutions of the old world-problems in my hands! Wait  till the light of this new revelation breaks upon confused humanity, and  it wakes to find its bravest hopes justified! Ah, then, my dear  Laidlaw--\"    He broke off suddenly; but the doctor, cleverly guessing the thought in  his mind, caught him up immediately.    \"Perhaps this very summer,\" he said, trying hard to make the suggestion  keep pace with honesty; \"in your explorations in Assyria--your digging  in the remote civilization of what was once Chaldea, you may find--what  you dream of--\"    The professor held up his hand, and the smile of a fine old face.    \"Perhaps,\" he murmured softly, \"perhaps!\"    And the young doctor, thanking the gods of science that his leader's  aberrations were of so harmless a character, went home strong in the  certitude of his knowledge of externals, proud that he was able to refer  his visions to self-suggestion, and wondering complaisantly whether in  his old age he might not after all suffer himself from visitations of  the very kind that afflicted his respected chief.    And as he got into bed and thought again of his master's rugged face,  and finely shaped head, and the deep lines traced by years of work and  self-discipline, he turned over on his pillow and fell asleep with a  sigh that was half of wonder, half of regret.          2      It was in February, nine months later, when Dr. Laidlaw made his way to  Charing Cross to meet his chief after his long absence of travel and  exploration. The vision about the so-called Tablets of the Gods had  meanwhile passed almost entirely from his memory.    There were few people in the train, for the stream of traffic was now  running the other way, and he had no difficulty in finding the man he  had come to meet. The shock of white hair beneath the low-crowned felt  hat was alone enough to distinguish him by easily.    \"Here I am at last!\" exclaimed the professor, somewhat wearily, clasping  his friend's hand as he listened to the young doctor's warm greetings  and questions. \"Here I am--a little older, and _much_ dirtier than when  you last saw me!\" He glanced down laughingly at his travel-stained  garments.    \"And _much_ wiser,\" said Laidlaw, with a smile, as he bustled about the  platform for porters and gave his chief the latest scientific news.    At last they came down to practical considerations.    \"And your luggage--where is that? You must have tons of it, I suppose?\"  said Laidlaw.    \"Hardly anything,\" Professor Ebor answered. \"Nothing, in fact, but what  you see.\"    \"Nothing but this hand-bag?\" laughed the other, thinking he was joking.    \"And a small portmanteau in the van,\" was the quiet reply. \"I have no  other luggage.\"    \"You have no other luggage?\" repeated Laidlaw, turning sharply to see if  he were in earnest.    \"Why should I need more?\" the professor added simply.    Something in the man's face, or voice, or manner--the doctor hardly knew  which--suddenly struck him as strange. There was a change in him, a  change so profound--so little on the surface, that is--that at first he  had not become aware of it. For a moment it was as though an utterly  alien personality stood before him in that noisy, bustling throng. Here,  in all the homely, friendly turmoil of a Charing Cross crowd, a curious  feeling of cold passed over his heart, touching his life with icy  finger, so that he actually trembled and felt afraid.    He looked up quickly at his friend, his mind working with startled and  unwelcome thoughts.    \"Only this?\" he repeated, indicating the bag. \"But where's all the stuff  you went away with? And--have you brought nothing home--no treasures?\"    \"This is all I have,\" the other said briefly. The pale smile that went  with the words caused the doctor a second indescribable sensation of  uneasiness. Something was very wrong, something was very queer; he  wondered now that he had not noticed it sooner.    \"The rest follows, of course, by slow freight,\" he added tactfully, and  as naturally as possible. \"But come, sir, you must be tired and in want  of food after your long journey. I'll get a taxi at once, and we can see  about the other luggage afterwards.\"    It seemed to him he hardly knew quite what he was saying; the change in  his friend had come upon him so suddenly and now grew upon him more and  more distressingly. Yet he could not make out exactly in what it  consisted. A terrible suspicion began to take shape in his mind,  troubling him dreadfully.    \"I am neither very tired, nor in need of food, thank you,\" the professor  said quietly. \"And this is all I have. There is no luggage to follow. I  have brought home nothing--nothing but what you see.\"    His words conveyed finality. They got into a taxi, tipped the porter,  who had been staring in amazement at the venerable figure of the  scientist, and were conveyed slowly and noisily to the house in the  north of London where the laboratory was, the scene of their labours of  years.    And the whole way Professor Ebor uttered no word, nor did Dr. Laidlaw  find the courage to ask a single question.    It was only late that night, before he took his departure, as the two  men were standing before the fire in the study--that study where they  had discussed so many problems of vital and absorbing interest--that  Dr. Laidlaw at last found strength to come to the point with direct  questions. The professor had been giving him a superficial and desultory  account of his travels, of his journeys by camel, of his encampments  among the mountains and in the desert, and of his explorations among the  buried temples, and, deeper,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16728"],[0,"A Catechism of Familiar Things; (#7)"],[1,"of Attica, founded by Cecrops, an Egyptian. It was the seat of  learning and the arts, and has produced some of the most celebrated  warriors, statesmen, orators, poets, and sculptors in the world. Since  the emancipation of Greece from the cruel bondage of its conquerors  the Turks, who had oppressed it for three centuries, Athens has been  chosen as its capital, and is still a considerable town adorned with  splendid ruins of the beautiful buildings it once possessed. Thebes  and Corinth, another celebrated city, are now only villages.         _Warrior_, a soldier.         _Statesmen_, men versed in the arts of government.         _Orator_, a public speaker.         _Poet_, one who composes poetry.         _Sculptor_, one who cuts figures in stone, marble, or ivory.      Who were the Venetians?    Inhabitants of Venice, a city of Italy.      Did this manufacture continue to be confined to the Greeks and  Venetians?    By no means. The rest of Italy, and Spain, by degrees learnt the art  from some manufactories in Sicily; and about the reign of Francis the  First, the French became masters of it. It, however, long remained a  rarity; their King, Henry the Second, is supposed to have worn the  first pair of knit silk stockings. The Fourth Henry encouraged the  planting of mulberry trees; his successors also did the same, and the  produce of silk in France is now very considerable.      When was the manufacture of silk introduced into England?    There was a company of silk women in England as early as the year  1455; but they probably were merely employed in needlework of silk and  thread, for Italy supplied England with the broad manufacture during  the chief part of the fifteenth century. The great advantage this new  manufacture afforded, made King James the First very desirous for its  introduction into England, particularly in 1608, when it was  recommended, in very earnest terms, to plant mulberry trees for the  rearing of silk worms; but unhappily without effect. However, towards  the latter end of this reign, the broad silk manufacture was  introduced, and with great success. The revocation of the Edict of  Nantes contributed greatly to its promotion, by the number of French  workmen who took refuge in England; to them the English are indebted  for the art of manufacturing many elegant kinds of silks, satins,  velvets, &c., which had formerly been imported from abroad up to the  year 1718. The silk manufacture has also been successfully introduced  into some portions of the United States.         _Revocation_, act of recalling, repeal.         _Imported_, brought into.      What was the Edict of Nantes?    A law made in favor of the Protestants, the repealing of which drove  many of their most skilful workmen to take refuge in England. They  were kindly received, and settled in Spitalfields, and many other  parts of England as well as Ireland, where they carried on a  flourishing and ingenious manufacture.      Were the attempts to rear Silk Worms in England successful?    No; after many trials, all of which failed, attention was directed to  the establishments for procuring both raw and wrought silks, in the  settlements in India belonging to Britain; this was attended with  complete success, the climate being extremely favorable, and the price  of labor cheap. Raw silk is imported in quantities from India, China,  Italy, &c.      How is the Silk taken from the Worm?    The people who are employed in the care of these insects collect the  golden balls from off the mulberry trees, (to the leaves of which the  insects glue their silk) and put them into warm water, that the  threads may unfasten and wind off more easily; having taken off the  coarse woolly part which covers the balls, they take twelve or  fourteen threads at a time, and wind them off into skeins. In order to  prepare this beautiful material for the hand of the weaver to be  wrought into silks, stuffs, brocades, satins, velvets, ribbons, &c.,  it is spun, reeled, milled, bleached, and dyed.         _Milled_, worked in a kind of mill.         _Bleached_, whitened.      What is Velvet?    A rich kind of stuff, all silk, covered on the outside with a close,  short, fine, soft shag; the wrong side being very strong and close.  The principal number, and the best velvets, were made in France and  Italy; others in Holland; they are now brought to great perfection in  England. An inferior kind is made by mixing cotton with the silk.  Velvet has been known in Europe for some centuries, but its  manufacture was long confined to some of the chief cities of Italy.  From that country the French learned the art, and greatly improved it.      Whence is the word Velvet derived?    From the Italian word _velluto_, signifying velvet, which comes from  _vellus_, hair or fleece.      What is Mohair?    The hair of a kind of goat, common about Angora, in Turkey. It is used  in the manufacture of various kinds of stuffs, shawls, &c.      Is there not another animal much celebrated for the material it  furnishes in the making of shawls?    Yes; the Thibet goat. The wool is sent to Cashmere, where it is spun  and dyed. Cashmere is situated in the north-west extremity of India,  and has long been celebrated for the beautiful and valuable shawls  bearing its name which are manufactured there. The goats are beautiful  creatures, with long, fine, wavy hair, reaching nearly to the ground,  so as almost to conceal their legs. The material of which the shawls  are made is a fine silky down, which grows under the long hair, next  to the skin.          CHAPTER VI.    CURRANTS, RAISINS, FIGS, RICE, SUGAR, SUGAR CANDY, &C., SAGO,  MILLET, GINGER, NUTMEG, MACE, PIMENTO OR ALLSPICE, PEPPER, AND CAYENNE  PEPPER.      What are Currants?    A kind of small raisins or dried grapes.      Whence are they brought?    From several islands of the Archipelago, particularly Zante and  Cephalonia; and from the Isthmus of Corinth, in Greece.      Do they grow on bushes like our Currants?    No, on vines like other grapes, except that the leaves are somewhat  thicker, and the grapes much smaller: they have no pips, and are of a  deep red, or rather black color.      When are they gathered, and how are they dried?    They are gathered in August, and laid on the ground in heaps till dry;  they are then cleaned, and put into magazines, from which they are  taken and packed in barrels for exportation.      What do you mean by Exportation?    The act of conveying goods for sale from one country to another.      What are Raisins?    Grapes prepared by drying them in the sun, or by the heat of an oven.  Raisins of Damascus, so called from the capital city of Syria, near  which they are cultivated, are very large, flat, and wrinkled on the  surface; soft and juicy inside, and nearly an inch long. Raisins of  the sun, or jar raisins, so called from being imported in jars, are  all dried by the heat of the sun; they are of a reddish blue color,  and are the produce of Spain, whence the finest and best raisins are  brought. There are several other sorts, named either from the place in  which they grow, or the kind of grape of which they are made, as those  of Malaga, Valencia, &c.      In what manner are they dried?    The common way of drying grapes for raisins, is to tie two or three  bunches of them together while yet on the vine, and dip them into a  lye made of hot wood-ashes, mixed with a little olive oil. This makes  them shrink and wrinkle: after this they are cut from the branches  which supported them, but left on the vine for three or four days,  separated on sticks, in an upright position, to dry at leisure.  Different modes, however, are adopted, according to the quality of the  grape. The commonest kinds are dried in hot ovens, but the best way is  that in which the grapes are cut when fully ripe, and dried by the  heat of the sun, on a floor of hard earth or stone.         _Lye_, a liquor made from wood-ashes; of great use in       medicine, bleaching, sugar works, &c.      What are Figs?    A soft, luscious fruit, the produce of the fig-tree. The best figs are  brought from Turkey, but they are also imported from Italy, Spain, and  the southern part of France. The islands of the Archipelago yield an  inferior sort in great abundance. In this country they are sometimes  planted in a warm situation in gardens, but, being difficult to ripen,  they do not arrive at perfection. The figs sent from abroad are dried  by the heat of the sun, or in furnaces for the purpose.         _Luscious_, sweet to excess, cloying.      What is Rice?    A useful and nutritious grain, cultivated in immense quantities in  India, China, and most eastern countries; in the West Indies, Central  America, and the United States; and in southern Europe. It forms the  principal food of the people of eastern and southern Asia, and is more  extensively consumed than any other species of grain, not even  excepting wheat.         _Nutritious_, wholesome, good for food.      Does it not require a great deal of moisture?    Yes, it is usually planted in moist soils, and near rivers, where the  ground can be overflowed after it is come up. The Chinese water their  rice-fields by means of movable mills, placed as occasion requires,  upon any part of the banks of a river; the water is raised in buckets  to a proper height, and afterwards conveyed in channels to the  destined places.      What is Sugar?    A sweet, agreeable substance, manufactured chiefly from the Sugar  Cane,[1] a native of the East and West Indies, South America and the  South Sea Islands; it is much cultivated in all tropical countries.  The earliest authentic accounts of sugar, are about the time of the  Crusades,[2] when it appears to have been purchased from the Saracens,  and imported into Europe.    [Footnote 1: Most of the sugar in Europe is made from beets.]  [Footnote 2: See Chapter XVII., article Navigation.]         _Authentic_, true,"]]]
