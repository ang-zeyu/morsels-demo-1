Those princesses who did not attain to the rank of queen by marriage,  were given in early youth to some well-to-do relative, or to some  courtier of high descent whom Pharaoh wished to honour; they filled the  office of priestesses to the goddesses Nit or Hathor, and bore in their  households titles which they transmitted to their children, with such  rights to the crown as belonged to them. The most favoured of the  princes married an heiress rich in fiefs, settled on her domain, and  founded a race of feudal lords. Most of the royal sons remained at  court, at first in their father's service and subsequently in that of  their brothers' or nephews': the most difficult and best remunerated  functions of the administration were assigned to them, the  superintendence of public works, the important offices of the  priesthood, the command of the army. It could have been no easy matter  to manage without friction this multitude of relations and connections,  past and present queens, sisters, concubines, uncles, brothers, cousins,  nephews, sons and grandsons of kings who crowded the harem and the  palace. The women contended among themselves for the affection of the  master, on behalf of themselves or their children. The children were  jealous of one another, and had often no bond of union except a common  hatred for the son whom the chances of birth had destined to be their  ruler. As long as he was full of vigour and energy, Pharaoh maintained  order in his family; but when his advancing years and failing strength  betokened an approaching change in the succession, competition showed  itself more openly, and intrigue thickened around him or around his  nearest heirs. Sometimes, indeed, he took precautions to prevent an  outbreak and its disastrous consequences, by solemnly associating with  himself in the royal power the son he had chosen to succeed him: Egypt  in this case had to obey two masters, the younger of whom attended  to the more active duties of royalty, such as progresses through the  country, the conducting of military expeditions, the hunting of wild  beasts, and the administration of justice; while the other preferred to  confine himself to the _role_ of adviser or benevolent counsellor. Even  this precaution, however, was insufficient to prevent disasters. The  women of the seraglio, encouraged from without by their relations or  friends, plotted secretly for the removal of the irksome sovereign.*  Those princes who had been deprived by their father's decision of any  legitimate hope of reigning, concealed their discontent to no purpose;  they were arrested on the first suspicion of disloyalty, and were  massacred wholesale; their only chance of escaping summary execution was  either by rebellion** or by taking refuge with some independent tribe of  Libya or of the desert of Sinai.         * The passage of the Uni inscription, in which mention is       made of a lawsuit carried on against Queen Amitsi, probably       refers to some harem conspiracy. The celebrated lawsuit,       some details of which are preserved for us in a papyrus of       Turin, gives us some information in regard to a conspiracy       which was hatched in the harem against Ramses II.         ** A passage in the \"Instructions of Amenemhait\" describes in       somewhat obscure terms an attack on the palace by       conspirators, and the wars which followed their undertaking.    [Illustration: 044.jpg The Island and Temple of Philae]    Did we but know the details of the internal history of Egypt, it would  appear to us as stormy and as bloody as that of other Oriental  empires: intrigues of the harem, conspiracies in the palace, murders of  heirs-apparent, divisions and rebellions in the royal family, were  the almost inevitable accompaniment of every accession to the Egyptian  throne.    The earliest dynasties had their origin in the \"White Wall,\" but the  Pharaohs hardly ever made this town their residence, and it would be  incorrect to say that they considered it as their capital; each king  chose for himself in the Memphite or Letopolite nome, between the  entrance to the Fayuni and the apex of the Delta, a special residence,  where he dwelt with his court, and from whence he governed Egypt. Such  a multitude as formed his court needed not an ordinary palace, but an  entire city. A brick wall, surmounted by battlements, formed a square  or rectangular enclosure around it, and was of sufficient thickness  and height not only to defy a popular insurrection or the surprises of  marauding Bedouin, but to resist for a long time a regular siege. At the  extreme end of one of its facades, was a single tall and narrow opening,  closed by a wooden door supported on bronze hinges, and surmounted with  a row of pointed metal ornaments; this opened into a long narrow passage  between the external wall and a partition wall of equal strength; at  the end of the passage in the angle was a second door, sometimes leading  into a second passage, but more often opening into a large courtyard,  where the dwelling-houses were somewhat crowded together: assailants ran  the risk of being annihilated in the passage before reaching the centre  of the place.* The royal residence could be immediately distinguished by  the projecting balconies on its facade, from which, as from a tribune,  Pharaoh could watch the evolutions of his guard, the stately approach of  foreign envoys, Egyptian nobles seeking audience, or such officials as  he desired to reward for their services. They advanced from the far  end of the court, stopped before the balcony, and after prostrating  themselves stood up, bowed their heads, wrung and twisted their hands,  now quickly, now slowly, in a rhythmical manner, and rendered worship to  their master, chanting his praises, before receiving the necklaces and  jewels of gold which he presented to them by his chamberlains, or which  he himself deigned to fling to them.**         * No plan or exact drawing of any of the palaces of the       Ancient Empire has come down to us, but, as Erman has very       justly pointed out, the signs found in contemporary       inscriptions give us a good general idea of them. The doors       which lead from one of the hours of the night to another, in       the \"Book of the Other World,\" show us the double passage       leading to the courtyard. The hieroglyph [--] gives us the       name Uoskhit (literally, _the broad_ [place]) of the       courtyard on to which the passage opened, at the end of       which the palace and royal judgment-seat (or, in the other       world, the tribunal of Osiris, the court of the double       truth) were situated.         ** The ceremonial of these receptions is not represented on       any monuments with which we are at present acquainted, prior       to the XVIIIth dynasty.    It is difficult for us to catch a glimpse of the detail of the internal  arrangements: we find, however, mention made of large halls \"resembling  the hall of Atumu in the heavens,\" whither the king repaired to deal  with state affairs in council, to dispense justice and sometimes also to  preside at state banquets. Long rows of tall columns, carved out of  rare woods and painted with bright colours, supported the roofs of these  chambers, which were entered by doors inlaid with gold and silver, and  incrusted with malachite or lapis-lazuli.*         * This is the description of the palace of Amon built by       Ramses III. Ramses II. was seated in one of these halls, on       a throne of gold, when he deliberated with his councillors       in regard to the construction of a cistern in the desert for       the miners who were going to the gold-mines of Akiti. The       room in which the king stopped, after leaving his       apartments, for the purpose of putting on his ceremonial       dress and receiving the homage of his ministers, appears to       me to have been called during the Ancient Empire \"Pi-dait\"       --\"The House of Adoration,\" the house in which the king was       worshipped, as in temples of the Ptolemaic epoch, was that       in which the statue of the god, on leaving the sanctuary,       was dressed and worshipped by the faithful. Sinuhit, under       the XIIth dynasty, was granted an audience in the \"Hall of       Electrum.\"    The private apartments, the \"akhonuiti,\" were entirely separate, but  they communicated with the queen's dwelling and with the harem of the  wives of inferior rank. The \"royal children\" occupied a quarter to  themselves, under the care of their tutors; they had their own houses  and a train of servants proportionate to their rank, age, and the  fortune of their mother's family. The nobles who had appointments  at court and the royal domestics lived in the palace itself, but the  offices of the different functionaries, the storehouses for their  provisions, the dwellings of their _employes_, formed distinct quarters  outside the palace, grouped around narrow courts, and communicating  with each other by a labyrinth of lanes or covered passages. The entire  building was constructed of wood or bricks, less frequently of roughly  dressed stone, badly built, and wanting in solidity. The ancient  Pharaohs were no more inclined than the Sultans of later days to occupy  palaces in which their predecessors had lived and died. Each king  desired to possess a habitation after his own heart, one which would not  be haunted by the memory, or perchance the double, of another sovereign.  These royal mansions, hastily erected, hastily filled with occupants,  were vacated and fell into ruin with no less rapidity: they grew old  with their master, or even more rapidly than he, and his disappearance  almost always entailed their ruin. In the neighbourhood of Memphis many  of these palaces might be seen, which their short-lived masters had  built for eternity, an eternity "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17323"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chald√¶a, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 3 (of 12) (#7)"],[1," was  a somewhat long interval between the manifestation of Oannes and  the foundation of a dynasty. The first king was Aloros of Babylon, a  Chaldaean of whom nothing is related except that he was chosen by the  divinity himself to be a shepherd of the people. He reigned for ten  sari, amounting in all to 36,000 years; for the saros is 3600 years, the  ner 600 years, and the soss 60 years.    [Illustration: 041.jpg TWO FISH-LIKE DEITIES OF THE CHALDAEANS.]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from an intaglio in the British Museum.    After the death of Aloros, his son Alaparos ruled for three sari, after  which Amillaros, of the city of Pantibibla, reigned thirteen sari. It  was under him that there issued from the Bed Sea a second Annedotos,  resembling Oannes in his semi-divine shape, half man and half fish.  After him Ammenon, also from Pantibibla, a Chaldaean, ruled for a term  of twelve sari; under him, they say, the mysterious Oannes appeared.  Afterwards Amelagaros of Pantibibla governed for eighteen sari; then  Davos, the shepherd from Pantibibla, reigned ten sari: under him there  issued from the Red Sea a fourth Annedotos, who had a form similar to  the others, being made up of man and fish. After him Bvedoranchos of  Pantibibla reigned for eighteen sari; in his time there issued yet  another monster, named Anodaphos, from the sea. These various monsters  developed carefully and in detail that which Oannes had set forth in a  brief way. Then Amempsinos of Larancha, a Chalaean, reigned ten sari; and  Obartes, also a Chaldaean, of Larancha, eight sari. Finally, on the death  of Obartes, his son Xisuthros held the sceptre for eighteen sari. It  was under him that the great deluge took place. Thus ten kings are to  be reckoned in all, and the duration of their combined reigns amounts  to one hundred and twenty sari. From the beginning of the world to the  Deluge they reckoned 691,200 years, of which 259,200 had passed  before the coming of Aloros, and the remaining 432,000 were generously  distributed between this prince and his immediate successors: the Greek  and Latin writers had certainly a fine occasion for amusement over these  fabulous numbers of years which the Chaldaeans assigned to the lives and  reigns of their first kings.    Men in the mean time became wicked; they lost the habit of offering  sacrifices to the gods, and the gods, justly indignant at this  negligence, resolved to be avenged.* Now, Shamashnapishtim I was  reigning at this time in Shurippak, the \"town of the ship:\" he and  all his family were saved, and he related afterwards to one of his  descendants how Ea had snatched him from the disaster which fell upon  his people.** \"Shurippak, the city which thou thyself knowest, is  situated on the bank of the Euphrates; it was already an ancient town  when the hearts of the gods who resided in it impelled them to bring the  deluge upon it--the great gods as many as they are; their father Anu,  their counsellor Bel the warrior, their throne-bearer Ninib, their  prince Innugi. The master of wisdom, Ea, took his seat with them,***  and, moved with pity, was anxious to warn Shamashnapishtim, his servant,  of the peril which threatened him;\" but it was a very serious affair to  betray to a mortal a secret of heaven, and as he did not venture to do  so in a direct manner, his inventive mind suggested to him an artifice.         * The account of Bcrossus implies this as a cause of the       Deluge, since he mentions the injunction imposed upon the       survivors by a mysterious voice to be henceforward       respectful towards the gods, [Greek word]. The Chalaean       account considers the Deluge to have been sent as a       punishment upon men for their sins against the gods, since       it represents towards the end (cf. p. 52 of this History) Ea       as reproaching Bel for having confounded the innocent and       the guilty in one punishment.         ** The name of this individual has been read in various       ways: Shamashnapishtim, \"sun of life,\" Sitnapishtim, \"the       saved,\" and Pirnapishtim. In one passage at least we find,       in place of Shamashnapishtim, the name or epithet of       Aclrakhasis, or by inversion Khasisadra, which appears to       signify \"the very shrewd,\" and is explained by the skill       with which he interpreted the oracle of Ea. Khasisadra is       most probably the form which the Greeks have transcribed by       Xisuthros, Sisuthros, Sisithes.         *** The account of the Deluge covers the eleventh tablet of       the poem of Gilgames. The hero, threatened with death,       proceeds to rejoin his ancestor Shamashnapishtim to demand       from him the secret of immortality, and the latter tells him       the manner in which he escaped from the waters: he had saved       his life only at the expense of the destruction of men. The       text of it was published by Smith and by Haupt, fragment by       fragment, and then restored consecutively. The studies of       which it is the object would make a complete library. The       principal translations are those of Smith, of Oppert, of       Lenor-mant, of Haupt, of Jensen, of A. Jeremias, of       Sauveplane, and of Zimmern.    [Illustration: 045.jpg Page with ONE OF THE TABLETS OF THE DELUGE  SERIES.]         Facsimile by Faucher-Gudin, from the photograph published by       G. Smith, Chaldaean Account of the Deluge from terra-cotta       tablets found at Nineveh.    He confided to a hedge of reeds the resolution that had been adopted:*  \"Hedge, hedge, wall, wall! Hearken, hedge, and understand well, wall!  Man of Shurippak, son of Ubaratutu, construct a wooden house, build a  ship, abandon thy goods, seek life; throw away thy possessions, save thy  life, and place in the vessel all the seed of life. The ship which thou  shalt build, let its proportions be exactly measured, let its dimensions  and shape be well arranged, then launch it in the sea.\" Shamashnapishtim  heard the address to the field of reeds, or perhaps the reeds repeated  it to him. \"I understood it, and I said to my master Ea 'The command,  O my master, which thou hast thus enunciated, I myself will respect it,  and I will execute it: but what shall I say to the town, the people and  the elders?'\" Ea opened his mouth and spake; he said to his servant:  \"Answer thus and say to them: 'Because Bel hates me, I will no longer  dwell in your town, and upon the land of Bel I will no longer lay my  head, but I will go upon the sea, and will dwell with Ea my master. Now  Bel will make rain to fall upon you, upon the swarm of birds and the  multitude of fishes, upon all the animals of the field, and upon all  the crops; but Ea will give you a sign: the god who rules the rain will  cause to fall upon you, on a certain evening, an abundant rain. When the  dawn of the next day appears, the deluge will begin, which will cover  the earth and drown all living things.'\" Shamashnapishtim repeated the  warning to the people, but the people refused to believe it, and turned  him into ridicule. The work went rapidly forward: the hull was a hundred  and forty cubits long, the deck one hundred and forty broad; all the  joints were caulked with pitch and bitumen. A solemn festival was  observed at its completion, and the embarkation began.** \"All that I  possessed I filled the ship with it all that I had of silver, I filled  it with it; all that I had of gold I filled it with it, all that I had  of the seed of life of every kind I filled it with it; I caused all  my family and my servants to go up into it; beasts of the field, wild  beasts of the field, I caused them to go up all together. Shamash had  given me a sign: 'When the god who rules the rain, in the evening shall  cause an abundant rain to fall, enter into the ship and close thy door.'  The sign was revealed: the god who rules the rain caused to fall one  night an abundant rain. The day, I feared its dawning; I feared to see  the daylight; I entered into the ship and I shut the door; that the ship  might be guided, I handed over to Buzur-Bel, the pilot, the great ark  and its fortunes.\"         * The sense of this passage is far from being certain; I       have followed the interpretation proposed, with some       variations, by Pinches, by Haupt, and by Jensen. The       stratagem at once recalls the history of King Midas, and the       talking reeds which knew the secret of his ass's ears. In       the version of Berossus, it is Kronos who plays the part       here assigned to Ea in regard to Xisuthros.         ** The text is mutilated, and does not furnish enough       information to follow in every detail the building of the       ark. From what we can understand, the vessel of       Shamashnapishtim was a kind of immense kelek, decked, but       without masts or rigging of any sort. The text identifies       the festival celebrated by the hero before the embarkation       with the festival Akitu of Merodach, at Babylon, during       which \"Nebo, the powerful son, sailed from Borsippa to       Babylon in the bark of the river Asmu, of beauty.\" The       embarkation of Nebo and his voyage on the stream had       probably inspired the information according to which the       embarkation of Shamashnapishtim was made the occasion of a       festival Akitu, celebrated at Shurippak; the time of the       Babylonian festival was probably thought to coincide with       the anniversary of the Deluge.    \"As soon as the morning became clear, a black cloud arose from the  foundations of heaven. Bamman growled in its bosom; Nebo and Marduk  ran before it--ran like two throne-bearers over hill and dale. Nera  the Great tore up the stake to which the ark was moored. Ninib came up  quickly; he began the attack; the Anunnaki raised their torches and made  the earth to tremble at their brilliancy; the tempest of Ramman scaled  the heaven, changed all the light to darkness, flooded the earth like a  lake.* For a"]]]
