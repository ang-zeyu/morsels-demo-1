This promise was promulgated in a telegram to the  Grand Duke Constantine.    \"There remains only now to find elsewhere the revenue which up to the  present time has been contributed by vodka. There has been introduced in  the Duma a bill offering a solution of this question. The aim of this  bill is not the creation of new taxes or an increase in the present  taxes, but an effort to render the Government domains and possessions  more productive.\"    [Illustration: decoration]    [Illustration: ADMIRAL SIR CHRISTOPHER CRADOCK,    Who Went Down with His Flagship, the Good Hope, in the Naval Engagement  Off the Coast of Chile.

(_Photo_ (C) _by Brown Bros._)]          Influence of the War Upon Russian Industry    [From Russkia Vedomosti, No. 260, Nov. 11, (Nov. 24,) 1914, P. 3.]           _The Russian Ministry of Commerce and Industry has lately       published the preliminary results of an inquiry into the       changes in industry which have occurred during the first two       and one-half months of the war, Aug. 1 to Oct. 14, 1914._    Altogether 8,550 of the largest industrial establishments, excepting  those of Poland, have been investigated. These employ 1,602,000 workers.  Of those investigated 502 factories employing 46,586 employes had to be  closed down entirely, while 1,034 establishments with 435,000  wage-earners have cut down their working force to 319,000. Thus about  one-third of the total industrial wage-earning force has felt the  effects of the war either through total discharge or through diminished  output.    The lack of trained labor power and the failure to obtain funds have  affected 222 establishments with 58,000 workers. Lack of funds has been  very severely felt in the Baltic provinces, (there, especially, in the  chemical industry,) affecting fourteen establishments with 15,701  workers. Altogether 132 establishments with 50,000 employes have cut  down their operations, and of these 30 per cent. employing 15,000  workers belonged to the chemical industry. Also twenty establishments of  the metal working (fine machinery) industry with 11,000 employes had to  curtail their volume of business. In other industries the lack of labor  supply has not been felt. Evidently only the industries requiring highly  qualified labor have suffered from this cause. The shortage of fuel  forced 108 establishments with 49,000 workers to diminish their output,  and eleven establishments with 3,000 workers had to close down  altogether.    The lack of fuel was very severely felt in the provinces of Petrograd  and in the Baltic, owing to the stoppage of the importation of British  coal. Of all establishments closed down for this reason, about 60 per  cent. belong to the provinces of Petrograd, Livland, and Estland.    In other regions this want was felt less severely. The output of coal in  the Donetz basin and of naphtha in the Baku region has increased, and  the decreased demand for fuel owing to the diminished production has  somewhat lowered the prices of naphtha. Thus in 1913 the average monthly  price of light naphtha in Balakhany was 42 copecks per pood, (two-thirds  of a cent per pound,) but in September, 1914, it was 36, and on Nov. 5  it fell to 25-26 copecks per pood, (13 cents per thirty-six pounds--a  little over 1-3 cent per pound.)    The main difficulty in the fuel supply lies, however, in the inadequate  transportation facilities.    The next obstacle in the way of normal development of industry is the  lack of transportation facilities. This cause alone forced 223 factories  with 128,000 workers to curtail their output, and fifty-six factories  with 5,300 workers stopped production.    But the most disastrous effect upon the Russian industry has been  produced by the diminished demand and by the lack of raw materials. For  lack of market, 671 establishments with 219,000 workers reduced their  output. The greatest sufferers have been the building trades and the  industries connected therewith--structural iron, cement, (concrete,)  brickmaking, &c.    The railroads have suffered greatly through the cancellation of  registered orders and by the stoppage of further orders from Poland,  also by the military mobilization.    During the month of August, 1914, the gross earnings of the Russian  railroads, both State and private, were only half of their gross  earnings for August the year before.    The unexpected prohibition of alcoholic beverages has almost ruined the  liquor industry.    For lack of demand 83 textile factories with 95,000 employes have  reduced their output. The lack of raw material forced 103 cotton mills  with 188,000 weavers to cut down their output. This makes 40 per cent.  of the total cotton mills of Russia. Similar reductions have occurred in  the silk, woolen, linen, and hemp industries.    The Ministry has withheld the data as to the exact nature of the raw  materials wanting, but it may be surmised that raw cotton and dyestuffs  are among the chief items.    Among the remedies suggested are better credit facilities and the  resumption of interrupted intercourse with friendly and neutral powers  for the securing of raw material.          Declaration of the Russian Industrial Interests    [Russkia Vedomosti, No. 217, Sept. 21, (Oct. 4,) 1914, P. 5.]      Referring to the abundance of donations forthcoming from the industrial  interests for the victims of war, the Council of the Conventions of the  industrial interests declares its confidence in the ability of Russian  industry to bear the burden of war cheerfully and whole-heartedly.    The Council finds the proposed measures of the Government for its  financing of the campaign insufficient, and promises to come forward  with its own project of a special single property and personal war tax.    Then the causes of the war are summed up and the importance of the war  for the industrial interests is outlined. The chief cause of the war is  assigned to the irreconcilable economic conflict between the German and  Russian interests created by commercial treaties favorable to Germany.    Victorious Russia should dictate her own economic programme to the  defeated enemy. Without such a result all sacrifices made will be in  vain, and will fall as a heavy and unbearable burden upon the shattered  economic organization of the country.    The industrial interests desire a war to the finish, and they say:    \"Let the Government know how to cultivate in the future among the people  the conviction that the war will be brought to an end, then the task of  finding the means for carrying on the campaign will be greatly  facilitated; for no sacrifice is too great for us for the overthrow of  the economic yoke of Germany and for the conquest of economic  independence. Nothing but strong will and determination are needed.\"         The Council of Industrial Conventions is a permanent       organization corresponding roughly to the executive board of       the National Manufacturers' Association of the United States.       All big industrial interests, like the mining companies, the       textile manufacturers, iron manufacturers, are represented in       the council.--Translator.          A Russian Financial Authority on the War    [Russkia Vedomosti, No. 167, July 22, (Aug. 4,) 1914, P. 4.]           _Prof. Migoulin, member of the Council of the Russian Ministry       of Finance and the author of several works on Russian       indebtedness, in his article, published immediately after the       beginning of the war and evidently written before the position       of Italy had become known, thus sums up the war situation:_    The moment for the declaration of war has been well chosen and carefully  planned by Germany and Austria. Russia had her hands full with the  numerous labor strikes and poor crops in certain parts of the country.    England had her troubles with the Ulsterites, and the President of  France was absent from his country when the Austrian ultimatum was  handed to Servia.    Austria had already mobilized large numbers of her troops in Bosnia  under the pretext of manoeuvres, Italy had a partial mobilization, and  Germany was preparing herself for a grand army show.    The German strategists are looking for a brief campaign. But they are  mistaken. Even with the capture of Petrograd the war will have barely  begun, for Petrograd is only the frontier of Russia.    Our troops are numerous and well equipped. The vastness of our country,  her poor roads, and her severe climate are her defenses. The French  frontier is strongly fortified. A quick surrender is unthinkable, and  there is no reason for surrender, for the war will continue to the  bitter end.    But a long campaign threatens Germany. She is a country with highly  developed industry and with a tremendous foreign commerce, the breakdown  of which cannot be compensated by any territorial conquest. A war of  Germany against England, France, and Russia will stop her commerce  entirely. It will be impossible for her to export her goods and to  import foodstuffs. Her manufactures and her commerce will come to a  deadlock, and unemployment will threaten her cities. All the victories  of her army will be of no avail. If her enemies draw out the war for a  year or two Germany will be exhausted. We are not talking of the  possibility of a German defeat, although Germany is not invincible.    The gold reserve of Russia, France, and England amount to about  350,000,000 rubles, ($155,000,000,) while the gold reserve of Germany,  Austria, and Italy is only about 160,000,000 rubles.    The gold currency of the first three countries amounts to about  7,000,000,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18891"],[0,"Dot and the Kangaroo (#7)"],[1," the world  millions of years before the ignorant Humans came on the earth at all.\"  The Platypus spluttered out more dirty water, in its indignation.    The Kangaroo became very timid, as it saw the rising anger of the  Platypus, and it whispered to Dot to say something to calm the little  creature.    \"A million years is a very long time,\" said Dot; unable at the moment to  think of anything better to say. But this remark angered the Platypus  more, for it seemed to suspect Dot of doubting what it said.    It clambered up into a more erect position, and its little brown eyes  became quite fiery.    \"I didn't say a million; I said millions! I can prove by a bone in my  body that my ancestors were the Amphitherium, the Amphilestes, the  Phascolotherium, and the Stereognathus!\" almost shrieked the little  creature.    [Illustration: THE PREHISTORIC CREATURES OF THE PLATYPUS'S SONG]    Dot didn't understand what all these words meant, and looked at the  Kangaroo for an explanation; but she saw that the Kangaroo didn't  understand either, only she was trying to hide her ignorance by a calm  appearance, while she nibbled the end of a long grass she held in her  fore paw. But Dot noticed, by the slight trembling of the little black  paw, that the Kangaroo was very nervous. She thought she would try and  say something to please Platypus; so she asked, very kindly, if the bone  ever hurt it. But this strange creature did not seem to notice the  remark. Settling itself more comfortably amongst the grass, it muttered  in calmer tones, \"I trace my ancestry back to the Oolite Age. Where does  man come in?\"    \"I don't know,\" said Dot.    \"Of course you don't!\" replied the Platypus, contemptuously, \"Humans are  so ignorant! That is because they are so new. When they have existed a  few more million years, they will be more like us of old families; they  will respect quiet, exclusive living, like that of the Ornithorhynchus  Paradoxus, and will not be so inquisitive, pushing, and dangerous as  now. The age will come when they will understand, and will cease to  write books, and there will be peace for everyone.\"    The Kangaroo now thought it a good opportunity to change the subject,  and gently introduced the topic of Dot's lost way, saying how she had  found the little girl, and had taken care of her ever since.    The Platypus did not seem interested, and yawned more than once whilst  the Kangaroo spoke.    \"The question is,\" concluded the Kangaroo, \"who shall I ask to find it?  Someone must know where it is.\"    \"Of course,\" said the Platypus, yawning again, without so much as  putting its web foot in front of its bill, which Dot thought very rude,  or else very ancient manners. \"Little Human,\" it said, \"tell me what  kind of bush creatures come about your burrow.\"    \"We live in a cottage,\" she said, but seeing that the Platypus did not  like to be corrected, and that the Kangaroo looked quite shocked at her  doing so, she hurriedly described the creatures she had seen there. She  said there were Crickets, Grasshoppers, Mice, Lizards, Swallows,  Opossums, Flying Foxes, Kookooburras, Magpies, and Shepherd's  Companions----    \"Stop!\" interrupted the Platypus, with a wave of its web foot; \"that is  the right one.\"    \"Who?\" asked the Kangaroo and Dot anxiously, together.    \"The bird you call Shepherd's Companion. Some of you call it Rickety  Dick, or Willy Wagtail.\" Turning to the Kangaroo especially, it  continued. \"If you can bring yourself to speak to anything so obtrusive  and gossiping, without any ancestry or manners whatever, you will be  able to learn all you need from that bird. Humans and Wagtails  fraternise together. They're both post-glacial.\"    \"I knew you could advise me,\" said the Kangaroo, gratefully.    \"Oh! Platypus, how clever you are!\" cried Dot, clapping her hands.    Directly Dot had spoken she saw that she had offended the queer little  creature before her. It raised itself with an air of offended dignity  that was unmistakable.    \"The name Platypus is insulting,\" it remarked, looking at the child  severely, \"it means _broad-footed_, a vulgar pseudonym which could only  have emanated from the brutally coarse expressions of a Human. My name  is Ornithorhynchus Paradoxus. Besides, even if my front feet can expand,  they can also contract; see! as narrow and refined as a bird's claw.  Observe, too, that my hind feet are narrow, and like a seal's fin,  though it has been described as a mole's foot.\"    As the Platypus spoke, and thrust out its strangely different feet, the  Kangaroo edged a little closer to Dot and whispered in her ear. \"It's  getting angry, and is beginning to use long words; do be careful what  you say or it will be terrible!\"    \"I beg your pardon,\" said Dot; \"I did not wish to hurt your feelings,  Para--, Pa--ra--dox--us.\"    \"_Ornithorhynchus_ Paradoxus, if you please,\" insisted the little  creature. \"How would you like it if your name was Jones-Smith-Jones, and  I called you one Jones, or one Smith, and did not say both the Jones and  the Smiths? You have no idea how sensitive our race is. You Humans have  no feelings at all compared with ours. Why! my fifth pair of nerves are  larger than a man's! Humans get on my nerves dreadfully!\" it ended in  disgusted accents.    \"She did not mean to hurt you,\" said the gentle Kangaroo, soothingly.  \"Is there anything we can do to make you feel comfortable again?\"    \"There is nothing you can do,\" sighed the Platypus, now mournful and  depressed. \"I must sing. Only music can quiet my nerves. I will sing a  little threnody composed by myself, about the good old days of this  world before the Flood.\" And as it spoke, the Platypus moved into an  upright position amongst the tussock grass, and after a little cough  opened its bill to sing.    The Kangaroo kept very close to Dot, and warned her to be very attentive  to the song, and not to interrupt it on any account. Almost before the  Kangaroo had ceased to whisper in her ear, Dot heard this strange song,  sung to the most peculiar tune she had ever heard, and in the funniest  of little squeaky voices.        The fairest Iguanodon reposed upon the shore;    Extended lay her beauteous form, a hundred feet and more.    The sun, with rays flammivomous, beat on the blue-black sand;    And sportive little Saurians disported on the strand;    But oft the Iguanodon reproved them in their glee,    And said, \"Alas! this Saurian Age is not what it should be!\"      Then, forth from that archaic sea, the Ichthyosaurus    Uprose upon his finny wings, with neocomian fuss,    \"O Iguanodon!\" he cried, as he approached the shore,    \"Why art thou thus dysthynic, love? Come, rise with me, and soar,    Or leave these estuarian seas, and wander in the grove;    Behold! a bird-like reptile fish is dying for thy love!\"      Then, through the dark coniferous grove they wandered side by side,    The tender Iguanodon and Ichthyosaurian bride;    And through the enubilious air, the carboniferous breeze,    Awoke, with _their_ amphibious sighs, the silence in the trees.    \"To think,\" they cried, botaurus-toned, \"when ages intervene,    Our osseous fossil forms will be in some museum seen!\"      Bemoaning thus, by dumous path, they crushed the cycad's growth,    And many a crash, and thunder, marked the progress of them both.    And when they reached the estuary, the excandescent sun    Was setting o'er the hefted sea; their saurian day was done.    Then raised they paraseline eyes unto the flaming moon,    And wept--the Neocomian Age was passing all too soon!      O Iguanodon! O Earth! O Ichthyosaurus!    O Melanocephalous saurians! Oh! oh! oh!                            (Here the Platypus was sobbing)      Oh, Troglyodites obscure--oh! oh!      At this point of the song, the poor Platypus, whose voice had trembled  with increasing emotion and sobbing in each verse, broke down, overcome  by the extreme sensitiveness of its fifth pair of nerves and the sadness  of its song, and wept in terrible grief.    The gentle Kangaroo was also deeply moved, seeing the Platypus in such  sorrow, and Dot mastered her aversion to touching cold, damp fur, and  stroked the little creature's head.    The Platypus seemed much soothed by their sympathy, but hurriedly bid  them farewell. It said it must try and restore its shattered fifth pair  of nerves by a few hydrophilus latipalpus beetles for lunch, and a  sleep.    It wearily dragged itself down to the edge of the pool, and looked  backwards to the Kangaroo and Dot, who called out \"Good-bye\" to it. Its  eyes were dim with tears, for it was still thinking of the Iguanodon and  Ichthyosaurus, and of the good old days before the Flood.    \"It breaks my heart to think that they are all fossils,\" it exclaimed,  mournfully shaking its head. \"Fossils!\" it repeated, as it plunged into  the pool and swam away. \"Fossils!\" it cried once more, in far, faint  accents; and a second later it dived out of sight.    For several moments after the Platypus had disappeared from view, the  Kangaroo and Dot remained just as it had left them. Then Dot broke the  silence.    \"Dear Kangaroo,\" said she, \"what was that song about?\"    \"I don't know,\" said the animal wistfully, \"no one ever knows what the  Platypus sings about.\"    \"It was very sad,\" said Dot.    \"Dreadfully sad!\" sighed the Kangaroo; \"but the Platypus is a most  learned and interesting creature,\" she added hastily. \"Its conversation  and songs are most edifying; everyone in the bush admits it.\"    \"Does anyone understand its conversation?\" asked Dot. She was afraid she  must be very stupid, for she hadn't understood anything except that  Willy Wagtail could help them to find her way.    \"That is the beauty of it all,\" said the Kangaroo. \"The Platypus is so  learned and so instructive, that no one tries to understand it; it is  not expected that anyone should.\"    [Illustration: DOT DANCES WITH THE NATIVE COMPANIONS]          CHAPTER V    "]]]
