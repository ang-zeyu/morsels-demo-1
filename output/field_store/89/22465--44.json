When she had gained the summit, the girl moved quickly through the  darkness in the direction of the next gorge which cut the mountain-side  a mile beyond Kor-ul-JA. It was the Gorge-of-water, Kor-ul-lul, to  which her father and two brothers had been sent by Es-sat ostensibly to  spy upon the neighboring tribe. There was a chance, a slender chance,  that she might find them; if not there was the deserted Kor-ul-GRYF  several miles beyond, where she might hide indefinitely from man if she  could elude the frightful monster from which the gorge derived its name  and whose presence there had rendered its caves uninhabitable for  generations.    Pan-at-lee crept stealthily along the rim of the Kor-ul-lul. Just where  her father and brothers would watch she did not know. Sometimes their  spies remained upon the rim, sometimes they watched from the gorge's  bottom. Pan-at-lee was at a loss to know what to do or where to go. She  felt very small and helpless alone in the vast darkness of the night.  Strange noises fell upon her ears. They came from the lonely reaches of  the towering mountains above her, from far away in the invisible valley  and from the nearer foothills and once, in the distance, she heard what  she thought was the bellow of a bull GRYF. It came from the direction  of the Kor-ul-GRYF. She shuddered.    Presently there came to her keen ears another sound. Something  approached her along the rim of the gorge. It was coming from above.  She halted, listening. Perhaps it was her father, or a brother. It was  coming closer. She strained her eyes through the darkness. She did not  move--she scarcely breathed. And then, of a sudden, quite close it  seemed, there blazed through the black night two yellow-green spots of  fire.    Pan-at-lee was brave, but as always with the primitive, the darkness  held infinite terrors for her. Not alone the terrors of the known but  more frightful ones as well--those of the unknown.  She had passed  through much this night and her nerves were keyed to the highest  pitch--raw, taut nerves, they were, ready to react in an exaggerated  form to the slightest shock.    But this was no slight shock. To hope for a father and a brother and to  see death instead glaring out of the darkness! Yes, Pan-at-lee was  brave, but she was not of iron. With a shriek that reverberated among  the hills she turned and fled along the rim of Kor-ul-lul and behind  her, swiftly, came the devil-eyed lion of the mountains of Pal-ul-don.    Pan-at-lee was lost. Death was inevitable. Of this there could be no  doubt, but to die beneath the rending fangs of the carnivore,  congenital terror of her kind--it was unthinkable. But there was an  alternative. The lion was almost upon her--another instant and he would  seize her. Pan-at-lee turned sharply to her left.  Just a few steps she  took in the new direction before she disappeared over the rim of  Kor-ul-lul. The baffled lion, planting all four feet, barely stopped  upon the verge of the abyss. Glaring down into the black shadows  beneath he mounted an angry roar.    Through the darkness at the bottom of Kor-ul-JA, Om-at led the way  toward the caves of his people. Behind him came Tarzan and Ta-den.  Presently they halted beneath a great tree that grew close to the cliff.    \"First,\" whispered Om-at, \"I will go to the cave of Pan-at-lee. Then  will I seek the cave of my ancestors to have speech with my own blood.  It will not take long. Wait here--I shall return soon. Afterward shall  we go together to Ta-den's people.\"    He moved silently toward the foot of the cliff up which Tarzan could  presently see him ascending like a great fly on a wall. In the dim  light the ape-man could not see the pegs set in the face of the cliff.  Om-at moved warily. In the lower tier of caves there should be a  sentry. His knowledge of his people and their customs told him,  however, that in all probability the sentry was asleep. In this he was  not mistaken, yet he did not in any way abate his wariness. Smoothly  and swiftly he ascended toward the cave of Pan-at-lee while from below  Tarzan and Ta-den watched him.    \"How does he do it?\" asked Tarzan. \"I can see no foothold upon that  vertical surface and yet he appears to be climbing with the utmost  ease.\"    Ta-den explained the stairway of pegs. \"You could ascend easily,\" he  said, \"although a tail would be of great assistance.\"    They watched until Om-at was about to enter the cave of Pan-at-lee  without seeing any indication that he had been observed and then,  simultaneously, both saw a head appear in the mouth of one of the lower  caves. It was quickly evident that its owner had discovered Om-at for  immediately he started upward in pursuit. Without a word Tarzan and  Ta-den sprang forward toward the foot of the cliff. The pithecanthropus  was the first to reach it and the ape-man saw him spring upward for a  handhold on the lowest peg above him. Now Tarzan saw other pegs roughly  paralleling each other in zigzag rows up the cliff face. He sprang and  caught one of these, pulled himself upward by one hand until he could  reach a second with his other hand; and when he had ascended far enough  to use his feet, discovered that he could make rapid progress. Ta-den  was outstripping him, however, for these precarious ladders were no  novelty to him and, further, he had an advantage in possessing a tail.    Nevertheless, the ape-man gave a good account of himself, being  presently urged to redoubled efforts by the fact that the Waz-don above  Ta-den glanced down and discovered his pursuers just before the Ho-don  overtook him. Instantly a wild cry shattered the silence of the  gorge--a cry that was immediately answered by hundreds of savage  throats as warrior after warrior emerged from the entrance to his cave.    The creature who had raised the alarm had now reached the recess before  Pan-at-lee's cave and here he halted and turned to give battle to  Ta-den. Unslinging his club which had hung down his back from a thong  about his neck he stood upon the level floor of the entrance-way  effectually blocking Ta-den's ascent. From all directions the warriors  of Kor-ul-JA were swarming toward the interlopers. Tarzan, who had  reached a point on the same level with Ta-den but a little to the  latter's left, saw that nothing short of a miracle could save them.  Just at the ape-man's left was the entrance to a cave that either was  deserted or whose occupants had not as yet been aroused, for the level  recess remained unoccupied. Resourceful was the alert mind of Tarzan of  the Apes and quick to respond were the trained muscles. In the time  that you or I might give to debating an action he would accomplish it  and now, though only seconds separated his nearest antagonist from him,  in the brief span of time at his disposal he had stepped into the  recess, unslung his long rope and leaning far out shot the sinuous  noose, with the precision of long habitude, toward the menacing figure  wielding its heavy club above Ta-den. There was a momentary pause of  the rope-hand as the noose sped toward its goal, a quick movement of  the right wrist that closed it upon its victim as it settled over his  head and then a surging tug as, seizing the rope in both hands, Tarzan  threw back upon it all the weight of his great frame.    Voicing a terrified shriek, the Waz-don lunged headforemost from the  recess above Ta-den. Tarzan braced himself for the coming shock when  the creature's body should have fallen the full length of the rope and  as it did there was a snap of the vertebrae that rose sickeningly in  the momentary silence that had followed the doomed man's departing  scream. Unshaken by the stress of the suddenly arrested weight at the  end of the rope, Tarzan quickly pulled the body to his side that he  might remove the noose from about its neck, for he could not afford to  lose so priceless a weapon.    During the several seconds that had elapsed since he cast the rope the  Waz-don warriors had remained inert as though paralyzed by wonder or by  terror. Now, again, one of them found his voice and his head and  straightway, shrieking invectives at the strange intruder, started  upward for the ape-man, urging his fellows to attack. This man was the  closest to Tarzan. But for him the ape-man could easily have reached  Ta-den's side as the latter was urging him to do. Tarzan raised the  body of the dead Waz-don above his head, held it poised there for a  moment as with face raised to the heavens he screamed forth the horrid  challenge of the bull apes of the tribe of Kerchak, and with all the  strength of his giant sinews he hurled the corpse heavily upon the  ascending warrior. So great was the force of the impact that not only  was the Waz-don torn from his hold but two of the pegs to which he  clung were broken short in their sockets.    As the two bodies, the living and the dead, hurtled downward toward the  foot of the cliff a great cry arose from the Waz-don. \"Jad-guru-don!  Jad-guru-don!\" they screamed, and then: \"Kill him! Kill him!\"    And now Tarzan stood in the recess beside Ta-den. \"Jad-guru-don!\"  repeated the latter, smiling--\"The terrible man! Tarzan the Terrible!  They may kill you, but they will never forget you.\"    \"They shall not ki--What have we here?\" Tarzan's statement as to what  \"they\" should not do was interrupted by a sudden ejaculation as two  figures, locked in deathlike embrace, stumbled through the doorway of  the cave to the outer porch. One was Om-at, the other a creature of his  own kind but with a rough coat, the hairs of which seemed to grow  straight outward from the skin, stiffly, unlike Om-at's sleek covering.  The two were quite evidently well matched and equally evident was the  fact that each was bent upon murder. They fought almost in silence  except for an occasional low growl as one or the other acknowledged  thus some new "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20203"],[0,"Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin (#7)"],[1,"want of sense.\"    This, however, I should submit to better judgments.        [21] Socrates confuted his opponents in argument by      asking questions so skillfully devised that the answers      would confirm the questioner's position or show the      error of the opponent.        [22] Alexander Pope (1688-1744), the greatest English      poet of the first half of the eighteenth century.    My brother had, in 1720 or 1721, begun to print a newspaper. It was  the second that appeared in America,[23] and was called the New England  Courant. The only one before it was the Boston News-Letter. I remember  his being dissuaded by some of his friends from the undertaking, as  not likely to succeed, one newspaper being, in their judgment, enough  for America. At this time (1771) there are not less than  five-and-twenty. He went on, however, with the undertaking, and after  having worked in composing the types and printing off the sheets, I  was employed to carry the papers thro' the streets to the customers.        [23] Franklin's memory does not serve him correctly here.      The _Courant_ was really the fifth newspaper established      in America, although generally called the fourth,      because the first, _Public Occurrences_, published in      Boston in 1690, was suppressed after the first issue.      Following is the order in which the other four papers      were published: _Boston News Letter_, 1704; _Boston      Gazette_, December 21, 1719; _The American Weekly      Mercury_, Philadelphia, December 22, 1719; _The New      England Courant_, 1721.    [Illustration: First page of The New England Courant of Dec. 4-11,  1721. Reduced about one-third. From a copy in the Library of the  Massachusetts Historical Society.]    [Transcriber's note: Transcription given at the end of the text.]    He had some ingenious men among his friends, who amus'd themselves by  writing little pieces for this paper, which gain'd it credit and made  it more in demand, and these gentlemen often visited us. Hearing their  conversations, and their accounts of the approbation their papers were  received with, I was excited to try my hand among them; but, being  still a boy, and suspecting that my brother would object to printing  anything of mine in his paper if he knew it to be mine, I contrived to  disguise my hand, and, writing an anonymous paper, I put it in at  night under the door of the printing-house. It was found in the  morning, and communicated to his writing friends when they call'd in  as usual. They read it, commented on it in my hearing, and I had the  exquisite pleasure of finding it met with their approbation, and that,  in their different guesses at the author, none were named but men of  some character among us for learning and ingenuity. I suppose now that  I was rather lucky in my judges, and that perhaps they were not really  so very good ones as I then esteem'd them.    Encourag'd, however, by this, I wrote and conveyed in the same way to  the press several more papers which were equally approv'd; and I kept  my secret till my small fund of sense for such performances was pretty  well exhausted, and then I discovered[24] it, when I began to be  considered a little more by my brother's acquaintance, and in a manner  that did not quite please him, as he thought, probably with reason,  that it tended to make me too vain. And, perhaps, this might be one  occasion of the differences that we began to have about this time.  Though a brother, he considered himself as my master, and me as his  apprentice, and, accordingly, expected the same services from me as he  would from another, while I thought he demean'd me too much in some he  requir'd of me, who from a brother expected more indulgence. Our  disputes were often brought before our father, and I fancy I was  either generally in the right, or else a better pleader, because the  judgment was generally in my favor. But my brother was passionate,  and had often beaten me, which I took extreamly amiss; and, thinking  my apprenticeship very tedious, I was continually wishing for some  opportunity of shortening it, which at length offered in a manner  unexpected.        [24] Disclosed.    [Illustration: \"I was employed to carry the papers thro' the streets  to the customers\"]    One of the pieces in our newspaper on some political point, which I  have now forgotten, gave offense to the Assembly. He was taken up,  censur'd, and imprison'd for a month, by the speaker's warrant, I  suppose, because he would not discover his author. I too was taken up  and examin'd before the council; but, tho' I did not give them any  satisfaction, they contented themselves with admonishing me, and  dismissed me, considering me, perhaps, as an apprentice, who was bound  to keep his master's secrets.    During my brother's confinement, which I resented a good deal,  notwithstanding our private differences, I had the management of the  paper; and I made bold to give our rulers some rubs in it, which my  brother took very kindly, while others began to consider me in an  unfavorable light, as a young genius that had a turn for libeling and  satyr. My brother's discharge was accompany'd with an order of the  House (a very odd one), that \"_James Franklin should no longer print  the paper called the New England Courant_.\"    There was a consultation held in our printing-house among his friends,  what he should do in this case. Some proposed to evade the order by  changing the name of the paper; but my brother, seeing inconveniences  in that, it was finally concluded on as a better way, to let it be  printed for the future under the name of Benjamin Franklin; and to  avoid the censure of the Assembly, that might fall on him as still  printing it by his apprentice, the contrivance was that my old  indenture should be return'd to me, with a full discharge on the back  of it, to be shown on occasion, but to secure to him the benefit of my  service, I was to sign new indentures for the remainder of the term,  which were to be kept private. A very flimsy scheme it was; however,  it was immediately executed, and the paper went on accordingly, under  my name for several months.    At length, a fresh difference arising between my brother and me, I  took upon me to assert my freedom, presuming that he would not venture  to produce the new indentures. It was not fair in me to take this  advantage, and this I therefore reckon one of the first errata of my  life; but the unfairness of it weighed little with me, when under the  impressions of resentment for the blows his passion too often urged  him to bestow upon me, though he was otherwise not an ill-natur'd man:  perhaps I was too saucy and provoking.    When he found I would leave him, he took care to prevent my getting  employment in any other printing-house of the town, by going round and  speaking to every master, who accordingly refus'd to give me work. I  then thought of going to New York, as the nearest place where there  was a printer; and I was rather inclin'd to leave Boston when I  reflected that I had already made myself a little obnoxious to the  governing party, and, from the arbitrary proceedings of the Assembly  in my brother's case, it was likely I might, if I stay'd, soon bring  myself into scrapes; and farther, that my indiscreet disputations  about religion began to make me pointed at with horror by good people  as an infidel or atheist. I determin'd on the point, but my father now  siding with my brother, I was sensible that, if I attempted to go  openly, means would be used to prevent me. My friend Collins,  therefore, undertook to manage a little for me. He agreed with the  captain of a New York sloop for my passage, under the notion of my  being a young acquaintance of his. So I sold some of my books to raise  a little money, was taken on board privately, and as we had a fair  wind, in three days I found myself in New York, near 300 miles from  home, a boy of but 17, without the least recommendation to, or  knowledge of, any person in the place, and with very little money in  my pocket.    [Illustration: Sailboat]          III    ARRIVAL IN PHILADELPHIA      My inclinations for the sea were by this time worne out, or I might  now have gratify'd them. But, having a trade, and supposing myself a  pretty good workman, I offer'd my service to the printer in the place,  old Mr. William Bradford, who had been the first printer in  Pennsylvania, but removed from thence upon the quarrel of George  Keith. He could give me no employment, having little to do, and help  enough already; but says he, \"My son at Philadelphia has lately lost  his principal hand, Aquilla Rose, by death; if you go thither, I  believe he may employ you.\" Philadelphia was a hundred miles further;  I set out, however, in a boat for Amboy, leaving my chest and things  to follow me round by sea.    In crossing the bay, we met with a squall that tore our rotten sails  to pieces, prevented our getting into the Kill,[25] and drove us upon  Long Island. In our way, a drunken Dutchman, who was a passenger too,  fell overboard; when he was sinking, I reached through the water to  his shock pate, and drew him up, so that we got him in again. His  ducking sobered him a little, and he went to sleep, taking first out  of his pocket a book, which he desir'd I would dry for him. It proved  to be my old favorite author, Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, in Dutch,  finely printed on good paper, with copper cuts, a dress better than I  had ever seen it wear in its own language. I have since found that it  has been translated into most of the languages of Europe, and suppose  it has been more generally read than any other book, except perhaps  the Bible. Honest John was the first that I know of who mix'd  narration and dialogue; a method of writing very engaging to the  reader, who in the most interesting parts finds himself, as it were,  brought into the company and present at the discourse.
