But I want some presents already.    SCHWILLIE (_crying_). Und me also. I want some presents, too.    KLINKER. Und Saint Nicholas can't come. Oh, oh! He can't get out on  the big ocean.    SCHWILLIE. Maybe he could float out on a piece of ice yet. Could he,  Hulda?    HULDA. No. I don't think he's much of a floater.    MEENY. If he did it would make him awful seasick.    KLINKER. I wish we was landed in New York yet, so I do.    SCHWILLIE. Where is Anita? She'll know.    HULDA. Yes, Anita will know whether he is coming or not. She knows  almost everything.    PADDY MIKE (_standing at rear L._). Here comes Anita now, and sure  she's having a grand time, so she is.    ALL (_rising and going to rear, looking off L._). Here she comes.  Hurrah for Anita. (_Music: The same as for the Opening Song._)    TOMASSO (_calling_). Anita, Anita, come here quick. We want you.    ANITA (_outside L._). I'm coming. Wait a minute. I'm coming.    _Music swells louder._ ANITA _dances in from L., all sing as she  dances around, waving her tambourine._    ALL (_singing to tune of the \"Opening Song\"_).         We're sailing to America,         Away across the sea,       We're happy little immigrants,         Our hearts are light and free.       Then clap, clap, clap together,    (_All skip around._)           Clap, clap away;       The steerage is a happy place--         Tomorrow's Christmas Day.    ANITA (_comes forward to C. surrounded by the others_). Oh, I've just  had the grandest time. It was so superb, magnificent, sublime!  (_Extends arms in ecstasy._) I have-a been at the leetla window  watching the great, grand, magnificent ocean. It was all so blue and  so green and so purple--and the sinking sun is all shining on the  great-a, beeg waves, like-a sparkling diamonds. (_Use elaborate  gestures at all times._) And me, the poor, leetla Italian girl, gets  to see all this great-a, grand-a ocean. It is superb, magnificent,  sublime! Ah, I am so happy, I could sing and dance and kees everybody  on the great-a, grand-a earth!    MEENY (_at L._). Vot makes you so happy, Anita? Maybe I'd be happy yet  also, if I didn't get seasick once in a while.    ANITA. What makes me so happy, Meeny? It's the sun and the waves, and  the sunlight shining like diamonds on the great-a, grand-a ocean. Are  you not also happy, Biddy Mary?    BIDDY MARY (_standing by_ ANITA). I am not. Sure, I niver do be having  time to be seeing diamonds on the great big waves. I have to be hard  at work, so I do, peeling the praties for our Christmas breakfast.    ANITA. I watched the great-a red sun as he began to sink, sink, sink  way down in the ocean. And the beeg-a waves got more beeg and more  beeg and on top of them I saw long white lace fringe. The green silk  waves were all-a trimmed with white lace fringe. And sometimes I think  I see the leetla mermaid fairies dancing in the foam. Leetla green and  white mermaids with the long long-a hair.    TOMASSO (_at R._). You make-a me seek, Anita. There is-a no such  things as fairies.    ANITA. But I love to _think_ there is. It is a great, grand-a pleasure  just to think there is. Is it not, Meeny?    MEENY (_stolidly_). Oh, sure.    ANITA. And that is why we should all be so verra, verra happy. We can  think such-a lovely things. The poor leetla children at-a home, pouf!  They cannot think such things, because they have never seen such a  great, beeg-a ship, or such a great, beeg-a ocean--    SERGIUS. Or a whale.    PADDY MIKE. Or a sailor man.    HULDA. Or a nice little steerage bed built just like a shelf in the  wall.    TOMASSO. Or the great beeg-a engine that makes the ship go.    MEENY. Or the tons and tons of coal vay down deep by the cellar.    SERGIUS (_mocking her_). Way down deep by the cellar! Whoever heard of  a cellar on board of a ship? You mean--down in the hatch.    MEENY. Hatch? Vot is dot hatch? Dis ain't a chicken, it's a boat.  (_All laugh._)    KLINKER (_takes_ SCHWILLIE _by the hand and goes to_ ANITA). Anita, we  want to ask you a question.    ANITA. Well, and what is the question of the leetla Dutch twins?    SCHWILLIE. Tonight is the night before Christmas.    KLINKER. Und we want to know if the good Saint Nicholas is coming  tonight.    ANITA. I don't know. You see it would be a great beeg-a, long-a trip  way out here on the ocean.    KLINKER (_half crying_). But I want him to come. I've been a awful  good boy, isn't I, Schwillie Willie Winkum?    SCHWILLIE. Sure, you is. Und me also, ain't I, Klinker?    ANITA. If you have both been verra, verra good I think that maybe the  good Saint will come. (_Looks around._) Have you all been verra, verra  good?    OTHERS. Yes, all of us.    HANS. We're always very, very good at Christmas time.    AH GOO. Me velly, _velly_ good.    ANITA (_points off R._). See, way up there on the upper deck, are the  rich, grand-a ladies and gentlemen coming out from the great, beeg-a  dining-room. If you go and stand under the hole maybe they'll throw  you some oranges or candy. They're awful nice peoples on the upper  deck.    MEENY. Let's all go right away quick. Maybe we'll get some oranges und  candy.    KLINKER. Oh, how I do love oranges und candy, don't I, Schwillie  Willie Winkum?    SCHWILLIE. Sure, und me also, don't I, Klinker?    SERGIUS. Let us all go together. (_All come forward and sing to tune  of the Opening Song._)         We're happy little immigrants,         We'll sing our happy song,       Our hearts are light, our faces bright--         The good ship speeds along.       Then clap, clap, clap together,         Clap, clap away;       The steerage is a happy place--         Tomorrow's Christmas Day.    (_All the children except_ ANITA _go out at R., repeating the chorus  of their song._)    ANITA. Surely the good-a Saint Nicholas will come tonight, because  there are so many, many verra good children on board this-a ship.  (_Counting on fingers._) There's Hulda from Holland and her two leetla  brothers, the Dutch twins, Klinker and Schwillie Willie Winkum. They  must have a great-a beeg-a Christmas present. And there's Sergius from  Russia, and Meeny and Paddy Mike and Biddy Mary, and Neelda from  Spain, and Yakob and Hans and Ah Goo and Mieze and leetla Sano San  from afar away Japan. They must all have the great-a, grand-a  presents. Maybe I could write old Santa Claus a leetla letter and tell  how good the poor children way down in the steerage have been. And  there's my cousin Tomasso from Italy. Oh, Santa Claus must bring him a  new violin. Then he can make-a the beautiful music on the golden  streets of New York. If there is anybody at all in the whole beeg  world who should have a nice-a, beeg-a Christmas, it is the verra poor  leetla children whose mammas and papas haven't got very much money.  But sometimes the good Santa Claus forgets all about the verra poor  leetla children--and that's the mostest saddest thing of all, for they  are the verra ones he should remember. When I get to be a great-a,  beeg, grand-a, reech lady in the golden streets of New York, ah! then  I will buy presents and presents and presents, and I will-a give them  to all the verra poor leetla children in the world. I wonder why it is  that the verra good Santa Claus sometimes forgets the poor leetla  children on-a Christmas Day. He never forgets the reech leetla  children, only those who are verra, verra poor. And that is a sad  misfortune. If I had-a nice-a Christmas present, with many candies and  figs and oranges, I could never rest until I had given something nice  to all the poor leetla children in the city--for that is what makes  the mostest happy Christmas of all.    _Enter_ SERGIUS _from R. quietly. He comes down behind_ ANITA _and  places his hands over her eyes._    SERGIUS. Guess who it is.    ANITA. Sergius!    SERGIUS (_disappointed_). Why, I thought that you would think it was a  goblin.    ANITA. Goblin? What is a goblin, Sergius?    SERGIUS. It's a little, wee bit of a man with a long beard. And they  go around having a good time at night. They are always very active on  the night before Christmas. (_Looks cautiously around._) I shouldn't  be at all surprised if we should see some tonight.    ANITA (_frightened_). Oh, Sergius, will they harm us?    SERGIUS. Not very much. They just like to have a little fun, that's  all. We have lots of them in Russia. And I believe there are some down  here in the steerage.    ANITA (_grasps his arm_). Oh, Sergius! Where are they?    SERGIUS. Well, last night I could not sleep, so I got up and came in  here, and just as I was passing by that barrel (_points to barrel up  L.C. where_ JACK FROST _is concealed_), I thought I heard a noise. It  was like some one rapping on the barrel. Like this. (_Raps on another  barrel._) I thought it was a goblin and I never stopped running until  I was safe in my bunk with the bedclothes around my head.    ANITA. Pooh! I'm not afraid. No leetla goblin man can make-a me  afraid.    SERGIUS. They do wonderful things on Christmas Eve. But come; let us  go to the bottom of the stairs. The ladies and gentlemen are looking  down and Tomasso is playing his violin. Soon they will throw apples  and oranges down to us, and perhaps money. Come and see.    ANITA. No, I'd rather wait here.    SERGIUS (_crossing to door at R._). All right, but don't let the  goblin man catch you. (_Exits at R._)    ANITA. The goblin man! Poof! There is no such thing as a goblin man.  In-a Italy we do not have such goblin mans. He said he heard something  rap, rap on the inside of the barrel. Poof! Sergius must have been  having one beeg, grand-a dream. Never in all my life did I ever hear  anything go rap, rap on the inside of a barrel. (_Stands close to_  JACK FROST'S _barrel._) And if I did, I'd think it was a leetla,  weeny-teeny mouse. But a leetla, weeny-teeny mouse never could go rap,  rap on the inside of a barrel, try as hard "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19831"],[0,"The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government, Volume 1 (#7)"],[1,"slaves until 1752, when the  proprietors surrendered the charter, and the colony became a part of the  royal government, and enjoyed the same privileges as the other  colonies.]    [Footnote 2: South Carolina subsequently (in 1803) repealed her law  forbidding the importation of slaves. The reason assigned for this  action was the impossibility of enforcing the law without the aid of the  Federal Government, to which entire control of the revenues, revenue  police, and naval forces of the country had been surrendered by the  States. \"The geographical situation of our country,\" said Mr. Lowndes,  of South Carolina, in the House of Representatives on February 14, 1804,  \"is not unknown. With navigable rivers running into the heart of it, it  was impossible, with our means, to prevent our Eastern brethren ...  engaged in this trade, from introducing them [the negroes] into the  country. The law was completely evaded.... Under these circumstances,  sir, it appears to me to have been the duty of the Legislature to repeal  the law, and remove from the eyes of the people the spectacle of its  authority being daily violated.\"    The effect of the repeal was to permit the importation of negroes into  South Carolina during the interval from 1803 to 1808. It in probable  that an extensive _contraband_ trade was carried on by the New England  slavers with other ports, on account of the lack of means to enforce the  laws of the Southern States forbidding it.]    [Footnote 3: One from the Society of Friends assembled at Philadelphia  and New York, the other from the Pennsylvania society of various  religious denominations combined for the abolition of slavery.

Foot,  a representative from Connecticut, in an incidental reference to it in  debate on another subject, a few weeks after the final settlement of the  Missouri case. He said: \"The Missouri question did not involve the  question of freedom or slavery, but merely _whether slaves now in the  country might be permitted to reside in the proposed new State; and  whether Congress or Missouri possessed the power to decide_.\"]    [Footnote 8: The votes on the proposed _restriction_, which eventually  failed of adoption, and on the _compromise_, which was finally adopted,  are often confounded. The advocacy of the former measure was exclusively  sectional, no Southern member voting for it in either House. On the  adoption of the compromise line of thirty-six degrees and thirty  minutes, the vote in the Senate was 34 yeas to 10 nays. The Senate  consisted of forty-four members from twenty-two States, equally divided  between the two sections--Delaware being classed as a Southern State.  Among the yeas were all the Northern votes, except two from  Indiana--being 20--and 14 Southern. The nays consisted of 2 from the  North, and 8 from the South.    In the House of Representatives, the vote was 134 yeas to 42 nays. Of  the yeas, 95 were Northern, 39 Southern; of the nays, 5 Northern, and 37  Southern.    Among the nays in the Senate were Messrs. James Barbour and James  Pleasants, of Virginia; Nathaniel Macon, of North Carolina; John  Gaillard and William Smith, of South Carolina. In the House, Philip P.  Barbour, John Randolph, John Tyler, and William S. Archer, of Virginia;  Charles Pinckney, of South Carolina (one of the authors of the  Constitution); Thomas W. Cobb, of Georgia; and others of more or less  note.    (See speech of the Hon. D. L. Yulee, of Florida, in the United States  Senate, on the admission of California, August 6, 1850, for a careful  and correct account of the compromise. That given in the second chapter  of Benton's \"Thirty Years' View\" is singularly inaccurate; that of  Horace Greeley, in his \"American Conflict,\" still more so.)]          CHAPTER II.        The Session of 1849-'50.--The Compromise Measures.--Virtual      Abrogation of the Missouri Compromise.--The Admission of      California.--The Fugitive Slave Law.--Death of Mr.      Calhoun.--Anecdote of Mr. Clay.      The first session of the Thirty-first Congress (1849-'50) was a  memorable one. The recent acquisition from Mexico of New Mexico and  California required legislation by Congress. In the Senate the bills  reported by the Committee on Territories were referred to a select  committee, of which Mr. Clay, the distinguished Senator from Kentucky,  was chairman. From this committee emanated the bills which, taken  together, are known as the compromise measures of 1850.    With some others, I advocated the division of the newly acquired  territory by an extension to the Pacific Ocean of the Missouri  Compromise line of thirty-six degrees and thirty minutes north latitude.  This was not because of any inherent merit or fitness in that line, but  because it had been accepted by the country as a settlement of the  sectional question which, thirty years before, had threatened a rupture  of the Union, and it had acquired in the public mind a prescriptive  respect which it seemed unwise to disregard. A majority, however,  decided otherwise, and the line of political conciliation was then  obliterated, as far as it lay in the power of Congress to do so. An  analysis of the vote will show that this result was effected almost  exclusively by the representatives of the North, and that the South was  not responsible for an action which proved to be the opening of  Pandora's box.[9]    However objectionable it may have been in 1820 to adopt that political  line as expressing a geographical definition of different sectional  interests, and however it may be condemned as the assumption by Congress  of a function not delegated to it, it is to be remembered that the act  had received such recognition and _quasi_-ratification by the people of  the States as to give it a value which it did not originally possess.  Pacification had been the fruit borne by the tree, and it should not  have been recklessly hewed down and cast into the fire. The frequent  assertion then made was that all discrimination was unjust, and that the  popular will should be left untrammeled in the formation of new States.  This theory was good enough in itself, and as an abstract proposition  could not be gainsaid; but its practical operation has but poorly  sustained the expectations of its advocates, as will be seen when we  come to consider the events that occurred a few years later in Kansas  and elsewhere. Retrospectively viewed under the mellowing light of time,  and with the calm consideration we can usually give to the irremediable  past, the compromise legislation of 1850 bears the impress of that  sectional spirit so widely at variance with the general purposes of the  Union, and so destructive of the harmony and mutual benefit which the  Constitution was intended to secure.    The refusal to divide the territory acquired from Mexico by an extension  of the line of the Missouri Compromise to the Pacific was a consequence  of the purpose to admit California as a State of the Union before it had  acquired the requisite population, and while it was mainly under the  control of a military organization sent from New York during the war  with Mexico and disbanded in California upon the restoration of peace.  The inconsistency of the argument against the extension of the line was  exhibited in the division of the Territory of Texas by that parallel,  and payment to the State of money to secure her consent to the partition  of her domain. In the case of Texas, the North had everything to gain  and nothing to lose by the application of the practice of geographical  compromise on an arbitrary line. In the case of California, the  conditions were reversed; the South might have been the gainer and the  North the loser by a recognition of the same rule.    The compensation which it was alleged that the South received was a more  effective law for the rendition of fugitives from service or labor. But  it is to be remarked that this law provided for the execution by the  General Government of obligations which had been imposed by the Federal  compact upon the several States of the Union. The benefit to be derived  from a fulfillment of that law would be small in comparison with the  evil to result from the plausible pretext that the States had thus been  relieved from a duty which they had assumed in the adoption of the  compact of union. Whatever tended to lead the people of any of the  States to feel that they could be relieved from their constitutional  obligations by transferring them to the General Government, or that they  might thus or otherwise evade or resist them, could not fail to be like  the tares which the enemy sowed amid the wheat. The union of States,  formed to secure the permanent welfare of posterity and to promote  harmony among the constituent States, could not, without changing its  character, survive such alienation as rendered its parts hostile to the  security, prosperity, and happiness of one another.    It was reasonably argued that, as the Legislatures of fourteen of the  States had enacted what were termed \"personal liberty laws,\" which  forbade the cooeperation of State officials in the rendition of fugitives  from service and labor, it became necessary that the General Government  should provide the requisite machinery for the execution of the law. The  result proved what might have been anticipated--that those communities  which had repudiated"]]]
