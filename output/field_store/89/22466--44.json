All attention denotes an active or dynamic phase of  consciousness. The difference is rather _in the way we secure  attention_; whether it is demanded by sudden stimulus, coaxed from us by  interesting objects of thought without effort on our part, or compelled  by force of will to desert the more interesting and take the direction  which we dictate.      6. IMPROVING THE POWER OF ATTENTION    While attention is no doubt partly a natural gift, yet there is probably  no power of the mind more susceptible to training than is attention. And  with attention, as with every other power of body and mind, the secret  of its development lies in its use. Stated briefly, the only way to  train attention is by attending. No amount of theorizing or resolving  can take the place of practice in the actual process of attending.    MAKING DIFFERENT KINDS OF ATTENTION REENFORCE EACH OTHER.--A very close  relationship and interdependence exists between nonvoluntary and  voluntary attention. It would be impossible to hold our attention by  sheer force of will on objects which were forever devoid of interest;  likewise the blind following of our interests and desires would finally  lead to shipwreck in all our lives. Each kind of attention must support  and reenforce the other. The lessons, the sermons, the lectures, and  the books in which we are most interested, and hence to which we attend  nonvoluntarily and with the least effort and fatigue, are the ones out  of which, other things being equal, we get the most and remember the  best and longest. On the other hand, there are sometimes lessons and  lectures and books, and many things besides, which are not intensely  interesting, but which should be attended to nevertheless. It is at this  point that the will must step in and take command. If it has not the  strength to do this, it is in so far a weak will, and steps should be  taken to develop it. We are to \"_keep the faculty of effort alive in us  by a little gratuitous exercise every day_.\" We are to be systematically  heroic in the little points of everyday life and experience. We are not  to shrink from tasks because they are difficult or unpleasant. Then,  when the test comes, we shall not find ourselves unnerved and untrained,  but shall be able to stand in the evil day.    THE HABIT OF ATTENTION.--Finally, one of the chief things in training  the attention is _to form the habit of attending_. This habit is to be  formed only by _attending_ whenever and wherever the proper thing to do  is to attend, whether \"in work, in play, in making fishing flies, in  preparing for an examination, in courting a sweetheart, in reading a  book.\" The lesson, or the sermon, or the lecture, may not be very  interesting; but if they are to be attended to at all, our rule should  be to attend to them completely and absolutely. Not by fits and starts,  now drifting away and now jerking ourselves back, but _all the time_.  And, furthermore, the one who will deliberately do this will often find  the dull and uninteresting task become more interesting; but if it never  becomes interesting, he is at least forming a habit which will be  invaluable to him through life. On the other hand, the one who fails to  attend except when his interest is captured, who never exerts effort to  compel attention, is forming a habit which will be the bane of his  thinking until his stream of thought shall end.      7. PROBLEMS IN OBSERVATION AND INTROSPECTION    1. Which fatigues you more, to give attention of the nonvoluntary type,  or the voluntary? Which can you maintain longer? Which is the more  pleasant and agreeable to give? Under which can you accomplish more?  What bearing have these facts on teaching?    2. Try to follow for one or two minutes the \"wave\" in your  consciousness, and then describe the course taken by your attention.    3. Have you observed one class alert in attention, and another lifeless  and inattentive? Can you explain the causes lying back of this  difference? Estimate the relative amount of work accomplished under the  two conditions.    4. What distractions have you observed in the schoolroom tending to  break up attention?    5. Have you seen pupils inattentive from lack of (1) change, (2) pure  air, (3) enthusiasm on the part of the teacher, (4) fatigue, (5) ill  health?    6. Have you noticed a difference in the _habit_ of attention in  different pupils? Have you noticed the same thing for whole schools or  rooms?    7. Do you know of children too much given to daydreaming? Are you?    8. Have you seen a teacher rap the desk for attention? What type of  attention was secured? Does it pay?    9. Have you observed any instance in which pupils' lack of attention  should be blamed on the teacher? If so, what was the fault? The remedy?    10. Visit a school room or a recitation, and then write an account of  the types and degrees of attention you observed. Try to explain the  factors responsible for any failures in attention, and also those  responsible for the good attention shown.          CHAPTER III    THE BRAIN AND NERVOUS SYSTEM      A fine brain, or a good mind. These terms are often used  interchangeably, as if they stood for the same thing. Yet the brain is  material substance--so many cells and fibers, a pulpy protoplasmic mass  weighing some three pounds and shut away from the outside world in a  casket of bone. The mind is a spiritual thing--the sum of the processes  by which we think and feel and will, mastering our world and  accomplishing our destiny.      1. THE RELATIONS OF MIND AND BRAIN    INTERACTION OF MIND AND BRAIN.--How, then, come these two widely  different facts, mind and brain, to be so related in our speech? Why are  the terms so commonly interchanged?--It is because mind and brain are so  vitally related in their processes and so inseparably connected in their  work. No movement of our thought, no bit of sensation, no memory, no  feeling, no act of decision but is accompanied by its own particular  activity in the cells of the brain. It is this that the psychologist has  in mind when he says, _no psychosis without its corresponding neurosis_.    So far as our present existence is concerned, then, no mind ever works  except through some brain, and a brain without a mind becomes but a mass  of dead matter, so much clay. Mind and brain are perfectly adapted to  each other. Nor is this mere accident. For through the ages of man's  past history each has grown up and developed into its present state of  efficiency by working in conjunction with the other. Each has helped  form the other and determine its qualities. Not only is this true for  the race in its evolution, but for every individual as he passes from  infancy to maturity.    THE BRAIN AS THE MIND'S MACHINE.--In the first chapter we saw that the  brain does not create the mind, but that the mind works through the  brain. No one can believe that the brain secretes mind as the liver  secretes bile, or that it grinds it out as a mill does flour. Indeed,  just what their exact relation is has not yet been settled. Yet it is  easy to see that if the mind must use the brain as a machine and work  through it, then the mind must be subject to the limitations of its  machine, or, in other words, the mind cannot be better than the brain  through which it operates. A brain and nervous system that are poorly  developed or insufficiently nourished mean low grade of efficiency in  our mental processes, just as a poorly constructed or wrongly adjusted  motor means loss of power in applying the electric current to its work.  We will, then, look upon the mind and the brain as counterparts of each  other, each performing activities which correspond to activities in the  other, both inextricably bound together at least so far as this life is  concerned, and each getting its significance by its union with the  other. This view will lend interest to a brief study of the brain and  nervous system.      2. THE MIND'S DEPENDENCE ON THE EXTERNAL WORLD    But can we first see how in a general way the brain and nervous system  are primarily related to our thinking? Let us go back to the beginning  and consider the babe when it first opens its eyes on the scenes of its  new existence. What is in its mind? What does it think about? Nothing.  Imagine, if you can, a person born blind and deaf, and without the sense  of touch, taste, or smell. Let such a person live on for a year, for  five years, for a lifetime. What would he know? What ray of intelligence  would enter his mind? What would he think about? All would be dark to  his eyes, all silent to his ears, all tasteless to his mouth, all  odorless to his nostrils, all touchless to his skin. His mind would be a  blank. He would have no mind. He could not get started to think. He  could not get started to act. He would belong to a lower scale of life  than the tiny animal that floats with the waves and the tide in the  ocean without power to direct its own course. He would be but an inert  mass of flesh without sense or intelligence.    THE MIND AT BIRTH.--Yet this is the condition of the babe at birth. It  is born practically blind and deaf, without definite sense of taste or  smell. Born without anything to think about, and no way to get anything  to think about until the senses wake up and furnish some material from  the outside world. Born with all the mechanism of muscle and nerve ready  to perform the countless complex movements of arms and legs and body  which characterize every child, he could not successfully start these  activities without a message from the senses to set them going. At birth  the child probably"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20239"],[0,"The Ten Books on Architecture (#7)"],[1,"of the tower but  not firmly nailed. This is to be cut away by the defenders in case the  enemy gets possession of any portion of the wall; and if the work is  quickly done, the enemy will not be able to make his way to the other  towers and the rest of the wall unless he is ready to face a fall.    5. The towers themselves must be either round or polygonal. Square  towers are sooner shattered by military engines, for the battering rams  pound their angles to pieces; but in the case of round towers they can  do no harm, being engaged, as it were, in driving wedges to their  centre. The system of fortification by wall and towers may be made  safest by the addition of earthen ramparts, for neither rams, nor  mining, nor other engineering devices can do them any harm.    [Illustration: CONSTRUCTION OF CITY WALLS    (From the edition of Vitruvius by Fra Giocondo, Venice, 1511)]    6. The rampart form of defence, however, is not required in all places,  but only where outside the wall there is high ground from which an  assault on the fortifications may be made over a level space lying  between. In places of this kind we must first make very wide, deep  ditches; next sink foundations for a wall in the bed of the ditch and  build them thick enough to support an earth-work with ease.    7. Then within this substructure lay a second foundation, far enough  inside the first to leave ample room for cohorts in line of battle to  take position on the broad top of the rampart for its defence. Having  laid these two foundations at this distance from one another, build  cross walls between them, uniting the outer and inner foundation, in a  comb-like arrangement, set like the teeth of a saw. With this form of  construction, the enormous burden of earth will be distributed into  small bodies, and will not lie with all its weight in one crushing mass  so as to thrust out the substructures.    8. With regard to the material of which the actual wall should be  constructed or finished, there can be no definite prescription, because  we cannot obtain in all places the supplies that we desire. Dimension  stone, flint, rubble, burnt or unburnt brick,--use them as you find  them. For it is not every neighbourhood or particular locality that can  have a wall built of burnt brick like that at Babylon, where there was  plenty of asphalt to take the place of lime and sand, and yet possibly  each may be provided with materials of equal usefulness so that out of  them a faultless wall may be built to last forever.          CHAPTER VI    THE DIRECTIONS OF THE STREETS; WITH REMARKS ON THE WINDS      1. The town being fortified, the next step is the apportionment of house  lots within the wall and the laying out of streets and alleys with  regard to climatic conditions. They will be properly laid out if  foresight is employed to exclude the winds from the alleys. Cold winds  are disagreeable, hot winds enervating, moist winds unhealthy. We must,  therefore, avoid mistakes in this matter and beware of the common  experience of many communities. For example, Mytilene in the island of  Lesbos is a town built with magnificence and good taste, but its  position shows a lack of foresight. In that community when the wind is  south, the people fall ill; when it is northwest, it sets them coughing;  with a north wind they do indeed recover but cannot stand about in the  alleys and streets, owing to the severe cold.    2. Wind is a flowing wave of air, moving hither and thither  indefinitely. It is produced when heat meets moisture, the rush of heat  generating a mighty current of air. That this is the fact we may learn  from bronze eolipiles, and thus by means of a scientific invention  discover a divine truth lurking in the laws of the heavens. Eolipiles  are hollow bronze balls, with a very small opening through which water  is poured into them. Set before a fire, not a breath issues from them  before they get warm; but as soon as they begin to boil, out comes a  strong blast due to the fire. Thus from this slight and very short  experiment we may understand and judge of the mighty and wonderful laws  of the heavens and the nature of winds.    3. By shutting out the winds from our dwellings, therefore, we shall not  only make the place healthful for people who are well, but also in the  case of diseases due perhaps to unfavourable situations elsewhere, the  patients, who in other healthy places might be cured by a different form  of treatment, will here be more quickly cured by the mildness that comes  from the shutting out of the winds. The diseases which are hard to cure  in neighbourhoods such as those to which I have referred above are  catarrh, hoarseness, coughs, pleurisy, consumption, spitting of blood,  and all others that are cured not by lowering the system but by building  it up. They are hard to cure, first, because they are originally due to  chills; secondly, because the patient's system being already exhausted  by disease, the air there, which is in constant agitation owing to winds  and therefore deteriorated, takes all the sap of life out of their  diseased bodies and leaves them more meagre every day. On the other  hand, a mild, thick air, without draughts and not constantly blowing  back and forth, builds up their frames by its unwavering steadiness, and  so strengthens and restores people who are afflicted with these  diseases.    4. Some have held that there are only four winds: Solanus from due east;  Auster from the south; Favonius from due west; Septentrio from the  north. But more careful investigators tell us that there are eight.  Chief among such was Andronicus of Cyrrhus who in proof built the marble  octagonal tower in Athens. On the several sides of the octagon he  executed reliefs representing the several winds, each facing the point  from which it blows; and on top of the tower he set a conical shaped  piece of marble and on this a bronze Triton with a rod outstretched in  its right hand. It was so contrived as to go round with the wind, always  stopping to face the breeze and holding its rod as a pointer directly  over the representation of the wind that was blowing.    5. Thus Eurus is placed to the southeast between Solanus and Auster:  Africus to the southwest between Auster and Favonius; Caurus, or, as  many call it, Corus, between Favonius and Septentrio; and Aquilo between  Septentrio and Solanus. Such, then, appears to have been his device,  including the numbers and names of the wind and indicating the  directions from which particular winds blow. These facts being thus  determined, to find the directions and quarters of the winds your method  of procedure should be as follows.    6. In the middle of the city place a marble amussium, laying it true by  the level, or else let the spot be made so true by means of rule and  level that no amussium is necessary. In the very centre of that spot set  up a bronze gnomon or \"shadow tracker\" (in Greek [Greek: skiatheras]).  At about the fifth hour in the morning, take the end of the shadow cast  by this gnomon, and mark it with a point. Then, opening your compasses  to this point which marks the length of the gnomon's shadow, describe a  circle from the centre. In the afternoon watch the shadow of your gnomon  as it lengthens, and when it once more touches the circumference of  this circle and the shadow in the afternoon is equal in length to  that of the morning, mark it with a point.    [Illustration: THE TOWER OF THE WINDS AT ATHENS]    7. From these two points describe with your compasses intersecting arcs,  and through their intersection and the centre let a line be drawn to the  circumference of the circle to give us the quarters of south and north.  Then, using a sixteenth part of the entire circumference of the circle  as a diameter, describe a circle with its centre on the line to the  south, at the point where it crosses the circumference, and put points  to the right and left on the circumference on the south side, repeating  the process on the north side. From the four points thus obtained draw  lines intersecting the centre from one side of the circumference to the  other. Thus we shall have an eighth part of the circumference set out  for Auster and another for Septentrio. The rest of the entire  circumference is then to be divided into three equal parts on each side,  and thus we have designed a figure equally apportioned among the eight  winds. Then let the directions of your streets and alleys be laid down  on the lines of division between the quarters of two winds.    8. On this principle of arrangement the disagreeable force of the winds  will be shut out from dwellings and lines of houses. For if the streets  run full in the face of the winds, their constant blasts rushing in from  the open country, and then confined by narrow alleys, will sweep through  them with great violence. The lines of houses must therefore be directed  away from the quarters from which the winds blow, so that as they come  in they may strike against the angles of the blocks and their force thus  be broken and dispersed.    9. Those who know names for very many winds will perhaps be surprised at  our setting forth that there are only eight. Remembering, however, that  Eratosthenes of Cyrene, employing mathematical theories and geometrical  methods, discovered from the course of the sun, the shadows cast by an  equinoctial gnomon, and the inclination of the heaven that the  circumference of the earth is two hundred and fifty-two thousand stadia,  that is, thirty-one one million five hundred thousand paces, and  observing that an eighth part of this, occupied by a wind, is three  million nine hundred and thirty-seven thousand five hundred paces, they  should not be surprised to find that a single wind, ranging over so wide  a field, is subject to shifts this way and that, leading to a variety of  breezes.    10.
