Yet there  are reasons for believing that the old village ruins on open sites, now  almost obliterated, mark the first period in the occupancy of the  canyon, perhaps even a period distinctly separated from the others.  Excavation on these sites would probably yield valuable results.      II--HOME VILLAGES ON BOTTOM LANDS    Ruins comprised in the second class are located on the bottom lands,  generally at the base of a cliff, and without reference to the  defensibility of the site. They are, as a rule, much broken down, and  might perhaps be classed with the ruins already described, but there are  some distinctive features which justify us in separating them. Ruins of  this class are always located either at the base of a cliff or in a cove  under it, on the level or raised but slightly above the bottom land, and  sometimes at a considerable distance from the stream. The ground plans  can generally be distinguished, and in many instances walls are still  standing--sometimes to a height of three stories. The ground plans  reflect more or less the character of the site they occupy, and we would  be as much surprised to find plans of their character in the open  country as we are to see plans of class I within the canyon. Unlike the  ground plans of class I, those of this group were laid out with direct  reference to the cliff behind them, and which formed, as it were, a part  of them.      [Illustration: Plate XLIV    Section of Old Walls, Canyon De Chelly]    In point of size, long period of occupancy, and position these villages  were the most important in the canyon. The ruins often cover  considerable areas and almost invariably show the remains of one or more  circular kivas. Sometimes they are located directly upon the bottom  land, more often they occupy low swells next the cliff, rising perhaps  10 feet above the general level and affording a fine view over it.  Sometimes they are found in alcoves at the base of the cliff, but they  always rest on the bottom land which extends into them; these merge  insensibly into the next class--village ruins on defensible sites--and  the distinction between them is partly an arbitrary one, as is also that  between the last mentioned and the cliff ruins proper.      [Illustration: Fig. 1--Ground plan of an old ruin in Canyon del    Muerto.]    Figure 1 is a ground plan of a small ruin located in Del Muerto, on the  bottom lands near its mouth. No standing walls now remain, but there is  no doubt that the village at one time covered much more ground than that  shown on the plan. There are now remains of sixteen rooms on the ground,  in addition to two kivas. There is a shallow alcove in the cliff at the  ground level, and the overhanging cliff gave the village some protection  overhead. Plate XLV shows another example in Del Muerto, the largest in  that canyon. The walls are still standing to a height of three stories  in one place, and the masonry is of high class. The back cliff has not  entered into the plan here to the same extent that it generally does.  Figure 2, a ground plan, exhibits only that portion of the area of the  ruin on which walls are still standing. It shows about 20 rooms on the  ground, exclusive of three or perhaps four kivas. The rooms are small as  a rule, rectangular, and arranged with a more than ordinary degree of  regularity. One room still carries its roof intact, as shown on the  plan. In the center of the ruin are the remains of a very large kiva,  over 36 feet in diameter. It is now so much broken down that but little  can be inferred as to its former condition, except that there was  probably no interior bench, as no remains of such a structure can now be  distinguished. The size of this kiva is exceptional, and it is very  probable that it was never roofed. The structures within the kiva, shown  on the ground plan, are Navaho burial cists. West of the large kiva  there were two others, less than 20 feet in diameter. One of these was  circular; the other was irregular in shape, perhaps more nearly  approaching an oval form. At no fewer than five places within the ruin  there are comparatively recent Navaho burials.      [Illustration: Fig. 2--Ground plan of a ruin on bottom land in    Canyon del Muerto.]      [Illustration: Fig. 3--Ground plan of a small ruin in Canyon de    Chelly.]    Figure 3 is a ground plan of a small and very compact village, situated  on the south side of the canyon at the point marked 28 on the detailed  map. It is located on a slightly raised part of the bottom, commanding  an outlook over a large area now under cultivation by the Navaho. The  wall lines are remarkably, although not perfectly, regular, and show at  least 25 rooms; there were probably others to the northward and  eastward. The rooms are now almost filled with debris, but two of them  are still intact, being kept in order by the Navaho and used for the  storage of corn. The roofs of both these rooms are now on the ground  level. The covered room nearest the cliff, shown on the plan, has been  divided into two small compartments by a wall through the middle; access  to each of these is obtained by a framed trapdoor in the roof about a  foot square. This dividing wall is probably of Navaho origin, as the  separate rooms formed by it are too small for habitation and the masonry  is very rough. A short distance to the north along the cliff there is a  Navaho house, roughly rectangular in plan, which was constructed of  stone obtained from this site. The masonry of the ruin presents a very  good face, not due to chinking, however, which was but slightly  practiced, but to the careful selection of material. Some of the stones  show surface pecking.      [Illustration: Plate XLV    General View of Ruin on Bottom Land, Canyon Del Muerto]    About 300 feet above or southeast of this ruin there are the remains of  two small rooms which were placed against the cliff. They are of the  same general character as those described, and doubtless formed part of  the same settlement. Between the two occurs a curious feature. A large  slab of rock, 280 feet long and not more than 12 feet thick at any  point, has split off from the cliff and dropped down to the ground,  where it remains on edge. This slab is triangular in elevation and about  50 feet high at the apex. Between it and the cliff, in the upper part,  there is a space from 2 to 21/2 feet wide. This is easily accessible from  the north, on the edge of the slab, and can be reached from the southern  end, but with much difficulty. Figure 4 shows this feature and its  relation to the ruin. There is no doubt that this was a granary or huge  storage bin, and probably the two rooms on the south were placed there  to guard that end; the northern end, of more easy access, being  protected by the village itself. It was well adapted to this purpose--a  fact that the Navaho have not been slow to appreciate. They have  constructed small bins near the northern end, shown on the plan, and  beyond this timbers have been wedged in so as to furnish a means of  closing the cleft. In the cleft itself cross walls have been  constructed, dividing it into several compartments. The interior forms a  convenient dry, airy space, and at the time it was visited the floor was  covered with a litter of cornhusks.      [Illustration: Fig. 4--Granary in the rocks, connected with a ruin.]    Almost directly opposite this ruin, on the other side of the canyon, are  the remains of a village that might properly be called a cave village.  At this point a large rock stands out from the cliff and in it there is  a cavity shaped almost like a quarter sphere. Its greatest diameter is  45 feet and its height about 20 feet. The bottom land here is 10 or 12  feet above the stream bed and slopes up gradually toward the cliff,  forming the bottom of the cave, which is perhaps 18 or 20 feet above the  stream and some distance from it. The cave commands an extensive outlook  over the cultivable lands below it and those extending up a branch  canyon a little above.    The whole bottom of the cave is covered by remains of rooms, shown in  plan in figure 5. The population could not have been greater than 10 or  12 persons, yet the remains of two kivas are clearly shown. Both were in  the front of the cave, adjoining but not connected with each other, and  were about 12 feet in diameter. Both had interior benches, extending in  one perhaps completely around, in the other only partly around. The  rooms are very irregular in shape and in size, ranging from 8 by 10 feet  to 3 by 4 feet, but the latter could be used only for storage. The  masonry is not of fine grade, although good; but not much detail can be  made out, as the place has been used as a sheepfold by the Navaho and  the ground surface has been filled up and smoothed over.      [Illustration: Fig. 5--Ground plan of a ruin in a cave.]    The largest ruin in the canyons is that shown in plan in figure 6. It is  situated in Del Muerto, on the canyon bottom at the base of a cliff, and  is known to the Navaho as Pakashi-izini (the blue cow). The name was  derived probably from a pictograph of a cow done in blue paint on the  canyon wall back of the ruin. Traces of walls extend over a narrow belt  against the cliffs about 400 feet long and not over 40 feet wide, and  over this area many walls are still standing. Scattered over the site  are a number of large bowlders. No attempt to remove these was made, but  walls were carried over and under them, and in some cases the direction  of a wall was modified to correspond with a face of a bowlder.    The settlement may have consisted of two separate portions, divided by a  row or cluster of large bowlders. The group shown on the right of the  plan was very compactly built, in one place being four"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19726"],[0,"The Door Through Space (#7)"],[1,"toys in the Kharsa, even bought them for Mack's kids. When a single man  is invited frequently to a home with five youngsters, it's about the  only way he can repay that hospitality, by bringing the children odd  trifles and knicknacks. But I had never seen anything quite like this  one, until--    --Until yesterday. The toy-seller they had hunted out of the Kharsa, the  one who had fled into the shrine of Nebran and vanished. He had had half  a dozen of those prism-and-star sparklers.    I tried to call up a mental picture of the little toy-seller. I didn't  have much luck. I'd seen him only in that one swift glance from beneath  his hood. \"Juli, have you ever seen a little man, like a _chak_ only  smaller, twisted, hunchbacked? He sells toys--\"    She looked blank. \"I don't think so, although there are dwarf _chaks_ in  the Polar Cities. But I'm sure I've never seen one.\"    \"It was just an idea.\" But it was something to think about. A toy-seller  had vanished. Rakhal, before disappearing, had smashed all Rindy's toys.  And the sight of a plaything of cunningly-cut crystal had sent Juli into  hysterics.    \"I'd better go before it's too dark,\" I said. I buckled the final clasp  of my shirtcloak, fitted my skean another notch into it, and counted the  money Mack had advanced me for expenses. \"I want to get into the Kharsa  and hunt up the caravan to Shainsa.\"    \"You're going there first?\"    \"Where else?\"    Juli turned, leaning one hand against the wall. She looked frail and  ill, years older than she was. Suddenly she flung her thin arms around  me, and a link of the chain on her fettered hands struck me hard, as she  cried out, \"Race, Race, he'll kill you! How can I live with that on my  conscience too?\"    \"You can live with a hell of a lot on your conscience.\" I disengaged her  arms firmly from my neck. A link of the chain caught on the clasp of my  shirtcloak, and again something snapped inside me. I grasped the chain  in my two hands and gave a mighty heave, bracing my foot against the  wall. The links snapped asunder. A flying end struck Juli under the eye.  I ripped at the seals of the jeweled cuffs, tore them from her arms,  find threw the whole assembly into a corner, where it fell with a  clash.    \"Damn it,\" I roared, \"that's over! You're never going to wear _those_  things again!\" Maybe after six years in the Dry-towns, Juli was  beginning to guess what those six years behind a desk had meant to me.    \"Juli, I'll find your Rindy for you, and I'll bring Rakhal in alive. But  don't ask more than that. Just _alive_. And don't ask me how.\"    He'd be alive when I got through with him. Sure, he'd be alive.    Just.          CHAPTER FIVE      It was getting dark when I slipped through a side gate, shabby and  inconspicuous, into the spaceport square. Beyond the yellow lamps, I  knew that the old city was beginning to take on life with the falling  night. Out of the chinked pebble-houses, men and woman, human and  nonhuman, came forth into the moonlit streets.    If anyone noticed me cross the square, which I doubted, they took me for  just another Dry-town vagabond, curious about the world of the strangers  from beyond the stars, and who, curiosity satisfied, was drifting back  where he belonged. I turned down one of the dark alleys that led away,  and soon was walking in the dark.    The Kharsa was not unfamiliar to me as a Terran, but for the last six  years I had seen only its daytime face. I doubted if there were a dozen  Earthmen in the Old Town tonight, though I saw one in the bazaar, dirty  and lurching drunk; one of those who run renegade and homeless between  worlds, belonging to neither. This was what I had nearly become.    I went further up the hill with the rising streets. Once I turned, and  saw below me the bright-lighted spaceport, the black many-windowed loom  of the skyscraper like a patch of alien shadow in the red-violet  moonlight. I turned my back on them and walked on.    At the fringe of the thieves market I paused outside a wineshop where  Dry-towners were made welcome. A golden nonhuman child murmured  something as she pattered by me in the street, and I stopped, gripped by  a spasm of stagefright. Had the dialect of Shainsa grown rusty on my  tongue? Spies were given short shrift on Wolf, and a mile from the  spaceport, I might as well have been on one of those moons. There were  no spaceport shockers at my back now. And someone might remember the  tale of an Earthman with a scarred face who had gone to Shainsa in  disguise....    I shrugged the shirtcloak around my shoulders, pushed the door and went  in. I had remembered that Rakhal was waiting for me. Not beyond this  door, but at the end of the trail, behind some other door, somewhere.  And we have a byword in Shainsa: _A trail without beginning has no end_.    Right there I stopped thinking about Juli, Rindy, the Terran Empire, or  what Rakhal, who knew too many of Terra's secrets, might do if he had  turned renegade. My fingers went up and stroked, musingly, the ridge of  scar tissue along my mouth. At that moment I was thinking only of  Rakhal, of an unsettled blood-feud, and of my revenge.    Red lamps were burning inside the wineshop, where men reclined on frowsy  couches. I stumbled over one of them, found an empty place and let  myself sink down on it, arranging myself automatically in the sprawl of  Dry-towners indoors. In public they stood, rigid and formal, even to eat  and drink. Among themselves, anything less than a loose-limbed sprawl  betrayed insulting watchfulness; only a man who fears secret murder  keeps himself on guard.    A girl with a tangled rope of hair down her back came toward me. Her  hands were unchained, meaning she was a woman of the lowest class, not  worth safeguarding. Her fur smock was shabby and matted with filth. I  sent her for wine. When it came it was surprisingly good, the sweet and  treacherous wine of Ardcarran. I sipped it slowly, looking round.    If a caravan for Shainsa were leaving tomorrow, it would be known here.  A word dropped that I was returning there would bring me, by ironbound  custom, an invitation to travel in their company.    When I sent the woman for wine a second time, a man on a nearby couch  got up, and walked over to me.    He was tall even for a Dry-towner, and there was something vaguely  familiar about him. He was no riffraff of the Kharsa, either, for his  shirtcloak was of rich silk interwoven with metallic threads, and  crusted with heavy embroideries. The hilt of his skean was carved from a  single green gem. He stood looking down at me for some time before he  spoke.    \"I never forget a voice, although I cannot bring your face to mind. Have  I a duty toward you?\"    I had spoken a jargon to the girl, but he addressed me in the lilting,  sing-song speech of Shainsa. I made no answer, gesturing him to be  seated. On Wolf, formal courtesy requires a series of polite _non  sequiturs_, and while a direct question merely borders on rudeness, a  direct answer is the mark of a simpleton.    \"A drink?\"    \"I joined you unasked,\" he retorted, and summoned the tangle-headed  girl. \"Bring us better wine than this swill!\"    With that word and gesture I recognized him and my teeth clamped hard on  my lip. This was the loudmouth who had shown fight in the spaceport  cafe, and run away before the dark girl with the sign of Nebran sprawled  on her breast.    But in this poor light he had not recognized me. I moved deliberately  into the full red glow. If he did not know me for the Terran he had  challenged last night in the spaceport cafe, it was unlikely that anyone  else would. He stared at me for some minutes, but in the end he only  shrugged and poured wine from the bottle he had ordered.    Three drinks later I knew that his name was Kyral and that he was a  trader in wire and fine steel tools through the nonhuman towns. And I  had given him the name I had chosen, Rascar.    He asked, \"Are you thinking of returning to Shainsa?\"    Wary of a trap, I hesitated, but the question seemed harmless, so I only  countered, \"Have you been long in the Kharsa?\"    \"Several weeks.\"    \"Trading?\"    \"No.\" He applied himself to the wine again. \"I was searching for a  member of my family.\"    \"Did you find him?\"    \"Her,\" said Kyral, and ceremoniously spat. \"No, I didn't find her. What  is your business in Shainsa?\"    I chuckled briefly. \"As a matter of fact, I am searching for a member of  my family.\"    He narrowed his eyelids as if he suspected me of mocking him, but  personal privacy is the most rigid convention of the Dry-towns and such  mockery showed a sensible disregard for prying questions if I did not  choose to answer them. He questioned no further.    \"I can use an extra man to handle the loads. Are you good with pack  animals? If so, you are welcome to travel under the protection of my  caravan.\"    I agreed. Then, reflecting that Juli and Rakhal must, after all, be  known in Shainsa, I asked, \"Do you know a trader who calls himself  Sensar?\"    He started slightly; I saw his eyes move along my scars. Then reserve,  like a lowered curtain, shut itself over his face, concealing a brief  satisfied glimmer. \"No,\" he lied, and stood up.    \"We leave at first daylight. Have your gear ready.\" He flipped something  at me, and I caught it in midair. It was a stone incised with Kyral's  name in the ideographs of Shainsa. \"You can sleep with the caravan if  you care to. Show that token to Cuinn.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Kyral's caravan was encamped in a barred field past the furthest gates  of the Kharsa. About a dozen men were busy loading the pack  animals--horses shipped in from Darkover, mostly. I asked the first man  I met for Cuinn. He pointed out a burly fellow in a shiny red  shirtcloak, who was busy at chewing out one of the young men for the way  he'd put a packsaddle on his beast.    Shainsa is a good language for cursing, but "]]]
