But in the days of \"Good  Queen Bess\" merry England, it would seem, was lustier. The Puritan  Stubbs, in his _Anatomie of Abuses_,[11] thus describes the festival:         \"They have twentie or fortie yoke of oxen, every oxe havyng a       sweete nosegaie of flowers tyed on the tippe of his hornes, and       these oxen draw home this Maiepoole (this stinckying idoll rather),       which is covered all over with flowers and hearbes, bound round       aboute with stringes from the top to the bottome, and sometyme       painted with variable colours, with two or three hundred men,       women, and children, following it with great devotion. And thus       beyng reared up, with handkerchiefes and flagges streaming on the       toppe, they strewe the ground about, binde greene boughs about it,       set up summer haules, bowers, and arbours hard by it. And then fall       they to banquet and feast, to leap and daunce aboute it, as the       heathen people did at the dedication of their idolles, whereof this       is a perfect patterne or rather the thyng itself.\"    The stern old Puritan was right, the maypole was the perfect pattern of  a heathen \"idoll, or rather the thyng itself.\" He would have  exterminated it root and branch, but other and perhaps wiser divines  took the maypole into the service of the Christian Church, and still[12]  on May Day in Saffron Walden the spring song is heard with its Christian  moral--        \"A branch of May we have brought you,        And at your door it stands;      It is a sprout that is well budded out,        The work of our Lord's hands.\"    The maypole was of course at first no pole cut down and dried. The gist  of it was that it should be a \"sprout, well budded out.\" The object of  carrying in the May was to bring the very spirit of life and greenery  into the village. When this was forgotten, idleness or economy would  prompt the villagers to use the same tree or branch year after year. In  the villages of Upper Bavaria Dr. Frazer[13] tells us the maypole is  renewed once every three, four, or five years. It is a fir-tree fetched  from the forest, and amid all the wreaths, flags, and inscriptions with  which it is bedecked, an essential part is the bunch of dark green  foliage left at the top, \"as a memento that in it we have to do, not  with a dead pole, but with a living tree from the greenwood.\"    At the ritual of May Day not only was the fresh green bough or tree  carried into the village, but with it came a girl or a boy, the Queen or  King of the May. Sometimes the tree itself, as in Russia, is dressed up  in woman's clothes; more often a real man or maid, covered with flowers  and greenery, walks with the tree or carries the bough. Thus in  Thuringia,[14] as soon as the trees begin to be green in spring, the  children assemble on a Sunday and go out into the woods, where they  choose one of their playmates to be Little Leaf Man. They break branches  from the trees and twine them about the child, till only his shoes are  left peeping out. Two of the other children lead him for fear he should  stumble. They take him singing and dancing from house to house, asking  for gifts of food, such as eggs, cream, sausages, cakes. Finally, they  sprinkle the Leaf Man with water and feast on the food. Such a Leaf Man  is our English Jack-in-the-Green, a chimney-sweeper who, as late as  1892, was seen by Dr. Rouse walking about at Cheltenham encased in a  wooden framework covered with greenery.    The bringing in of the new leafage in the form of a tree or flowers is  one, and perhaps the simplest, form of spring festival. It takes little  notice of death and winter, uttering and emphasizing only the desire for  the joy in life and spring. But in other and severer climates the  emotion is fiercer and more complex; it takes the form of a struggle or  contest, what the Greeks called an _agon_. Thus on May Day in the Isle  of Man a Queen of the May was chosen, and with her twenty maids of  honour, together with a troop of young men for escort. But there was not  only a Queen of the May, but a Queen of Winter, a man dressed as a  woman, loaded with warm clothes and wearing a woollen hood and fur  tippet. Winter, too, had attendants like the Queen of the May. The two  troops met and fought; and whichever Queen was taken prisoner had to pay  the expenses of the feast.    In the Isle of Man the real gist of the ceremony is quite forgotten, it  has become a mere play. But among the Esquimaux[15] there is still  carried on a similar rite, and its magical intent is clearly understood.  In autumn, when the storms begin and the long and dismal Arctic winter  is at hand, the central Esquimaux divide themselves into two parties  called the Ptarmigans and the Ducks. The ptarmigans are the people born  in winter, the ducks those born in summer. They stretch out a long rope  of sealskin. The ducks take hold of one end, the ptarmigans of the  other, then comes a tug-of-war. If the ducks win there will be fine  weather through the winter; if the ptarmigans, bad. This autumn festival  might, of course, with equal magical intent be performed in the spring,  but probably autumn is chosen because, with the dread of the Arctic ice  and snow upon them, the fear of winter is stronger than the hope of  spring.           *       *       *       *       *    The intense emotion towards the weather, which breaks out into these  magical _agones_, or \"contests,\" is not very easy to realize. The  weather to us now-a-days for the most part damps a day's pleasuring or  raises the price of fruit and vegetables. But our main supplies come to  us from other lands and other weathers, and we find it hard to think  ourselves back into the state when a bad harvest meant starvation. The  intensely practical attitude of man towards the seasons, the way that  many of these magical dramatic ceremonies rose straight out of the  emotion towards the food-supply, would perhaps never have been fully  realized but for the study of the food-producing ceremonies of the  Central Australians.    The Central Australian spring is not the shift from winter to summer,  from cold to heat, but from a long, arid, and barren season to a season  short and often irregular in recurrence of torrential rain and sudden  fertility. The dry steppes of Central Australia are the scene of a  marvellous transformation. In the dry season all is hot and desolate,  the ground has only patches of wiry scrub, with an occasional parched  acacia tree, all is stones and sand; there is no sign of animal life  save for the thousand ant-hills. Then suddenly the rainy season sets in.  Torrents fill the rivers, and the sandy plain is a sheet of water.  Almost as suddenly the rain ceases, the streams dry up, sucked in by the  thirsty ground, and as though literally by magic a luxuriant vegetation  bursts forth, the desert blossoms as a rose. Insects, lizards, frogs,  birds, chirp, frisk and chatter. No plant or animal can live unless it  live quickly. The struggle for existence is keen and short.    It seems as though the change came and life was born by magic, and the  primitive Australian takes care that magic should not be wanting, and  magic of the most instructive kind. As soon as the season of fertility  approaches he begins his rites with the avowed object of making and  multiplying the plants, and chiefly the animals, by which he lives; he  paints the figure of the emu on the sand with vermilion drawn from his  own blood; he puts on emu feathers and gazes about him vacantly in  stupid fashion like an emu bird; he makes a structure of boughs like the  chrysalis of a Witchetty grub--his favourite food, and drags his body  through it in pantomime, gliding and shuffling to promote its birth.  Here, difficult and intricate though the ceremonies are, and uncertain  in meaning as many of the details must probably always remain, the main  emotional gist is clear. It is not that the Australian wonders at and  admires the miracle of his spring, the bursting of the flowers and the  singing of birds; it is not that his heart goes out in gratitude to an  All-Father who is the Giver of all good things; it is that, obedient to  the push of life within him, his impulse is towards food. He must eat  that he and his tribe may grow and multiply. It is this, his will to  live, that he _utters and represents_.           *       *       *       *       *    The savage utters his will to live, his intense desire for food; but it  should be noted, it is desire and will and longing, not certainty and  satisfaction that he utters. In this respect it is interesting to note  that his rites and ceremonies, when periodic, are of fairly long  periods. Winter and summer are not the only natural periodic cycles;  there is the cycle of day and night, and yet among primitive peoples but  little ritual centres round day and night. The reason is simple. The  cycle of day and night is so short, it recurs so frequently, that man  naturally counted upon it and had no cause to be anxious. The emotional  tension necessary to ritual was absent. A few peoples, _e.g._ the  Egyptians, have practised daily incantations to bring back the sun.  Probably they had at first felt a real tension of anxiety, and  then--being a people hidebound by custom--had gone on from mere  conservatism. Where the sun returns at a longer interval, and is even,  as among the Esquimaux, hidden for the long space of six months, ritual  inevitably arises. They play at cat's-cradle to catch the ball of the  sun lest it should sink and be lost for ever.    Round the moon, whose cycle is long, but not too long, ritual very early  centred, but probably only when its supposed influence on vegetation was  first surmised. The moon, as it were, practises magic herself; she waxes  and wanes, and with her, man thinks, all the vegetable kingdom waxes and  wanes too, all but the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17132"],[0,"The Makers of Canada: Champlain (#7)"],[1," Brouage, his native country, having  sojourned in America for three years and five months.    FOOTNOTES:    [5] Norembega was the name applied at that time to a vast tract of  country whose limits were nearly unknown. There was a river and a cape  called Norembega. The river is now the Penobscot, and the cape is the  southern extremity of the Acadian peninsula.    [6] The Indians called this island _Pemetig_, which means _the island  which is ahead_. The French settled here in 1613, and founded St.  Sauveur on the north-eastern coast, in a splendid harbour which is  to-day known as Bar Harbour. The remains of many of the French who were  killed during the contest with the English, were interred at Point  Fernald. At the point nearest the mainland there is a bridge of seven  hundred feet in length, which communicates with the town of Trenton.    [7] Champlain called the river _Peimtegoueet_. This word means _the place  of a river where rapids exist_. The English have given their preference  to the word _Penobscot_, which comes from the Indian _Penaouasket, the  place where the earth is covered with stones_.    [8] The Pilgrim Fathers, the founders of New England, landed at this  place, which they named Plymouth, to preserve the name of the English  city from which they had sailed.          CHAPTER III    THE FOUNDING OF QUEBEC      After his return to France, as before described, Champlain had an  interview with de Monts, and laid before him the journal which he had  prepared of his explorations in America, together with plans of the  ports and coasts which he had minutely examined during his visits.  Champlain proposed to de Monts to continue his explorations, and  advanced some reasons for prosecuting an enterprise upon which a large  sum had been already expended, and which he was persuaded would  ultimately afford the means of repairing their fortunes. De Monts, owing  to the failure of his own efforts as a colonizer, was not at first  inclined to listen to Champlain's proposals, but he was finally  convinced of the wisdom of his suggestions, and appointed him lieutenant  of an expedition to Quebec for the purpose of trading with the Indians.  The expedition was to return to France during the same year. De Monts  obtained another commission from the king, dated at Paris, January 9th,  1608, which gave him the monopoly of the fur trade in the lands, ports  and rivers of Canada for a period of one year. Two vessels were equipped  for this expedition, the _Don de Dieu_, captain Henry Couillard, and  the _Levrier_, captain Nicholas Marion. Champlain was given the command  of the former vessel, and Pont-Grave was in command of the latter. The  _Levrier_ sailed from France on April 5th, and the _Don de Dieu_ eight  days later. The two vessels proceeded directly to Tadousac, without  calling at Perce, according to the usual custom.    On the arrival of the _Don de Dieu_ at Tadousac, Champlain found that  Pont-Grave had been attacked by Captain Darache, a Basque, who continued  to trade furs with the Indians in spite of the king's commands. Darache  had brought all his guns to bear upon the _Levrier_, and Pont-Grave  being unable to defend himself, had offered no resistance, whereupon  Darache's crew had boarded the vessel and carried off the cannon and  arms, at the same time intimating that they would continue to trade as  they pleased. The arrival of Champlain, however, altered the situation,  and Darache was compelled to sign an agreement by which he pledged  himself not to molest Pont-Grave, or to do anything prejudicial to the  interest of the king or of de Monts. It was also agreed that all  differences should be settled by the authorities in France. After this  agreement was effected through Champlain's intervention, the carpenters  of the expedition fitted out a small barque to convey to Quebec all the  articles necessary for the use of the future settlement.    [Illustration: Building the _Habitation_, Quebec, 1608    From the painting by C.W. Jefferys]    In the meantime Champlain visited the river Saguenay, where he met some  Indians from whom he gathered information concerning Lake St. John and  its tributaries. The information did not differ greatly from that which  he had obtained in the year 1603. Champlain set out from Tadousac on the  last day of June and arrived at Quebec on July 3rd, \"Where I searched,\"  he says, \"for a place suitable for our settlement, but I could find none  more convenient or better situated than the point of Quebec, so called  by the savages, which was covered with nut trees.\"    Champlain was accompanied by thirty men, amongst whom may be named  Nicholas Marsolet, Etienne Brule, Bonnerme, a doctor, Jean Duval,  Antoine Natel and La Taille. These names are specially recorded.  Champlain immediately employed some workmen to fell trees in order to  commence the construction of an _Habitation_. One party was engaged in  sawing timber, another in digging a cellar and some ditches, while  another party was sent to Tadousac with a barque to obtain supplies  which had been retained in the ships. Such was the beginning of  Champlain's city. Nothing great, it will be admitted, for a settlement  which its founder hoped before long would become the great warehouse of  New France.    Until this date the merchants had traded with the Indians only in those  places where they could easily be met, and even Chauvin, who was  mentioned in a previous chapter, had not gone further than Tadousac.  Neither Three Rivers, nor the islands of Sorel at the entrance of the  Iroquois River, now called the Richelieu River, were known to French  navigators at this period, and although these places were easily  accessible to the aborigines, they were not so available as Quebec.    Champlain well understood the advantages of founding his city on a spot  naturally fortified and where he could readily defend himself against  the attack of an enemy, whose approach he expected sooner or later. The  first foes, however, whom Champlain had to encounter were not the  Indians, but his own countrymen, members of his crew who under various  pretexts sought to kill their chief and give the command of the  settlement to the Basques. Jean Duval, the king's locksmith, was the  leader of this conspiracy against Champlain, and associated with him  were four vicious sailors to whom he promised a part of the reward which  had been offered for this treason. The conspirators agreed to preserve  secrecy, and fixed the night of the fourth day for the assassination of  their chief.    On the day upon which the plot was to be put into execution, Captain Le  Testu[9] arrived from Tadousac in command of a vessel laden with  provisions, utensils, etc. After the vessel was unloaded, one of the  conspirators, a locksmith named Natel, approached the captain and  acquainted him with the details of the plot. Champlain also listened to  the man's account and promised to observe secrecy, although he took  precautions to frustrate the scheme by inviting the leader and the four  conspirators to an entertainment on board Captain Le Testu's barque.    The men accepted the invitation, and as soon as they were on board they  were seized and held in custody until the following day. The deposition  of each man was then taken by Champlain in the presence of the pilot and  sailors, and set down in writing, after which the \"worthies\" were sent  to Tadousac, where Champlain requested Pont-Grave to guard them for a  time. Some days after the men were returned to Quebec, where they were  placed on trial for attempted murder.    The jury was composed of Champlain, Pont-Grave, Le Testu, Bonnerme, the  mate and the second mate, and some sailors. The verdict was unanimous.  Duval was condemned to death on the spot as the instigator of the plot,  and the others were also sentenced to death, but their sentence was to  be carried out in France. Duval was strangled at Quebec, and his head  was placed on a pike which was set up in the most conspicuous part of  the fort. This was the second example of capital punishment in New  France. The first case recorded was at Charlesbourg Royal, or Cap-Rouge,  near Quebec, in the winter of 1542-3, when Michel Gaillon, one of  Roberval's companions, was put to death.    Champlain was invested with executive, legislative and judiciary powers,  but the founder of Quebec never abused the authority intrusted to him.  From this time every one fulfilled his duty day by day, and Champlain  was able to continue his work in peace.    The habitation was composed of three buildings of two stories, each one  of three fathoms long and two and a half wide. The storehouse was six  fathoms long and three wide, with a cellar six feet deep. There was a  gallery around the buildings, at the second story. There were also  ditches fifteen feet wide and six deep. On the outer side of the ditches  Champlain constructed several spurs, which enclosed a part of the  dwelling, at the point where he placed a cannon. Before the habitation  there was a square four fathoms wide and six or seven long, looking out  upon the river bank. Surrounding the habitation were very good gardens,  and an open space on the north side, some hundred and twenty paces long  and fifty or sixty wide.    During the first weeks after his installation, Champlain made an  investigation of the vicinity. \"Near Quebec,\" he says, \"there is a  little river coming from a lake in the interior, distant six or seven  leagues from our settlement. I am of opinion that this river, which is  north a quarter north-west from our settlement, is the place where  Jacques Cartier wintered, since there are still, a league up the river,  remains of what seems to have been a chimney, the foundation of which  has been found, and indications of there having been ditches surrounding  their dwelling, which was small. We found also, large pieces of hewn,  worm-eaten timber, and some three or four"]]]
