The sand streamed off his coat in little  white streak. Jones appeared to be casting about in his mind.    \"I'm Grant Wallace,\" continued the newcomer. \"I missed you at the El  Tovar, at Williams and at Flagstaff, where I was one day behind. Was  half a day late at the Little Colorado, saw your train cross Moncaupie  Wash, and missed you because of the sandstorm there. Saw you from the  other side of the Big Colorado as you rode out from Emmett's along the  red wall. And here I am. We've never met till now, which obviously  isn't my fault.\"    The Colonel and I fell upon Wallace's neck. Frank manifested his usual  alert excitation, and said: \"Well, I guess he won't hang fire on a long  cougar chase.\" And Jim--slow, careful Jim, dropped a plate with the  exclamation: \"Shore it do beat hell!\" The hounds sniffed round Wallace,  and welcomed him with vigorous tails.    Supper that night, even if we did grind sand with our teeth, was a  joyous occasion. The biscuits were flaky and light; the bacon fragrant  and crisp. I produced a jar of blackberry jam, which by subtle cunning  I had been able to secrete from the Mormons on that dry desert ride,  and it was greeted with acclamations of pleasure. Wallace, divested of  his sand guise, beamed with the gratification of a hungry man once more  in the presence of friends and food. He made large cavities in Jim's  great pot of potato stew, and caused biscuits to vanish in a way that  would not have shamed a Hindoo magician. The Grand Canyon he dug in my  jar of jam, however, could not have been accomplished by legerdemain.    Talk became animated on dogs, cougars, horses and buffalo. Jones told  of our experience out on the range, and concluded with some salient  remarks.    \"A tame wild animal is the most dangerous of beasts. My old friend,  Dick Rock, a great hunter and guide out of Idaho, laughed at my advice,  and got killed by one of his three-year-old bulls. I told him they knew  him just well enough to kill him, and they did. My friend, A. H. Cole,  of Oxford, Nebraska, tried to rope a Weetah that was too tame to be  safe, and the bull killed him. Same with General Bull, a member of the  Kansas Legislature, and two cowboys who went into a corral to tie up a  tame elk at the wrong time. I pleaded with them not to undertake it.  They had not studied animals as I had. That tame elk killed all of  them. He had to be shot in order to get General Bull off his great  antlers. You see, a wild animal must learn to respect a man. The way I  used to teach the Yellowstone Park bears to be respectful and safe  neighbors was to rope them around the front paw, swing them up on a  tree clear of the ground, and whip them with a long pole. It was a  dangerous business, and looks cruel, but it is the only way I could  find to make the bears good. You see, they eat scraps around the hotels  and get so tame they will steal everything but red-hot stoves, and will  cuff the life out of those who try to shoo them off. But after a bear  mother has had a licking, she not only becomes a good bear for the rest  of her life, but she tells all her cubs about it with a good smack of  her paw, for emphasis, and teaches them to respect peaceable citizens  generation after generation.    \"One of the hardest jobs I ever tackled was that of supplying the  buffalo for Bronx Park. I rounded up a magnificent 'king' buffalo bull,  belligerent enough to fight a battleship. When I rode after him the  cowmen said I was as good as killed. I made a lance by driving a nail  into the end of a short pole and sharpening it. After he had chased me,  I wheeled my broncho, and hurled the lance into his back, ripping a  wound as long as my hand. That put the fear of Providence into him and  took the fight all out of him. I drove him uphill and down, and across  canyons at a dead run for eight miles single handed, and loaded him on  a freight car; but he came near getting me once or twice, and only  quick broncho work and lance play saved me.    \"In the Yellowstone Park all our buffaloes have become docile,  excepting the huge bull which led them. The Indians call the buffalo  leader the 'Weetah,' the master of the herd. It was sure death to go  near this one. So I shipped in another Weetah, hoping that he might  whip some of the fight out of old Manitou, the Mighty. They came  together head on, like a railway collision, and ripped up over a square  mile of landscape, fighting till night came on, and then on into the  night.    \"I jumped into the field with them, chasing them with my biograph,  getting a series of moving pictures of that bullfight which was sure  the real thing. It was a ticklish thing to do, though knowing that  neither bull dared take his eyes off his adversary for a second, I felt  reasonably safe. The old Weetah beat the new champion out that night,  but the next morning they were at it again, and the new buffalo finally  whipped the old one into submission. Since then his spirit has remained  broken, and even a child can approach him safely--but the new Weetah is  in turn a holy terror.    \"To handle buffalo, elk and bear, you must get into sympathy with their  methods of reasoning. No tenderfoot stands any show, even with the tame  animals of the Yellowstone.\"    The old buffalo hunter's lips were no longer locked. One after another  he told reminiscences of his eventful life, in a simple manner; yet so  vivid and gripping were the unvarnished details that I was spellbound.    \"Considering what appears the impossibility of capturing a full-grown  buffalo, how did you earn the name of preserver of the American bison?\"  inquired Wallace.    \"It took years to learn how, and ten more to capture the fifty-eight  that I was able to keep. I tried every plan under the sun. I roped  hundreds, of all sizes and ages. They would not live in captivity. If  they could not find an embankment over which to break their necks, they  would crush their skulls on stones. Failing any means like that, they  would lie down, will themselves to die, and die. Think of a savage wild  nature that could will its heart to cease beating! But it's true.  Finally I found I could keep only calves under three months of age. But  to capture them so young entailed time and patience. For the buffalo  fight for their young, and when I say fight, I mean till they drop. I  almost always had to go alone, because I could neither coax nor hire  any one to undertake it with me. Sometimes I would be weeks getting one  calf. One day I captured eight--eight little buffalo calves! Never will  I forget that day as long as I live!\"    \"Tell us about it,\" I suggested, in a matter of fact,  round-the-campfire voice. Had the silent plainsman ever told a complete  and full story of his adventures? I doubted it. He was not the man to  eulogize himself.    A short silence ensued. The cabin was snug and warm; the ruddy embers  glowed; one of Jim's pots steamed musically and fragrantly. The hounds  lay curled in the cozy chimney corner.    Jones began to talk again, simply and unaffectedly, of his famous  exploit; and as he went on so modestly, passing lightly over features  we recognized as wonderful, I allowed the fire of my imagination to  fuse for myself all the toil, patience, endurance, skill, herculean  strength and marvelous courage and unfathomable passion which he  slighted in his narrative.        CHAPTER 3.    THE LAST HERD    Over gray No-Man's-Land stole down the shadows of night. The undulating  prairie shaded dark to the western horizon, rimmed with a fading streak  of light. Tall figures, silhouetted sharply against the last golden  glow of sunset, marked the rounded crest of a grassy knoll.    \"Wild hunter!\" cried a voice in sullen rage, \"buffalo or no, we halt  here. Did Adams and I hire to cross the Staked Plains? Two weeks in  No-Man's-Land, and now we're facing the sand! We've one keg of water,  yet you want to keep on. Why, man, you're crazy! You didn't tell us you  wanted buffalo alive. And here you've got us looking death in the eye!\"    In the grim silence that ensued the two men unhitched the team from the  long, light wagon, while the buffalo hunter staked out his wiry,  lithe-limbed racehorses. Soon a fluttering blaze threw a circle of  light, which shone on the agitated face of Rude and Adams, and the  cold, iron-set visage of their brawny leader.    \"It's this way,\" began Jones, in slow, cool voice; \"I engaged you  fellows, and you promised to stick by me. We've had no luck. But I've  finally found sign--old sign, I'll admit the buffalo I'm looking  for--the last herd on the plains. For two years I've been hunting this  herd. So have other hunters. Millions of buffalo have been killed and  left to rot. Soon this herd will be gone, and then the only buffalo in  the world will be those I have given ten years of the hardest work in  capturing. This is the last herd, I say, and my last chance to capture  a calf or two. Do you imagine I'd quit? You fellows go back if you  want, but I keep on.\"    \"We can't go back. We're lost. We'll have to go with you. But, man,  thirst is not the only risk we run. This is Comanche country. And if  that herd is in here the Indians have it spotted.\"    \"That worries me some,\" replied the plainsman, \"but we'll keep on it.\"    They slept. The night wind swished the grasses; dark storm clouds  blotted out the northern stars; the prairie wolves mourned dismally.    Day broke cold, wan, threatening, under a leaden sky. The hunters  traveled thirty miles by noon, and halted in a hollow where a stream  flowed in wet season. Cottonwood trees were bursting into green;  thickets of prickly thorn, dense and matted, showed bright spring buds.    \"What is it?\" suddenly"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20571"],[0,"Woman's Work in Music (#7)"],[1,"romances. Many of these minstrels performed the  unusual task of setting the laws in poetic form. It is not unusual to  find lawyers becoming good poets, but in this case the legal minstrels  drew from the codes of their native land enough inspiration for long  effusions. Moral and religious precepts, too, were often put in the form  of lengthy poems. Of even greater interest to the student of old customs  are the so-called \"Essenhamens,\" or collections of rules for behaviour  for young ladies. In one of these, by Amanieus des Escas, called the  god of love, the poet gives his counsel to a young lady in the train of  some great countess. He meets her in one of her walks, whereupon she  addresses him and asks for certain rules to guide her conduct. The poet,  after apologetically insisting that she must know more about it, having  ten times as much common sense as he has, overcomes his scruples, and  proceeds to pour forth much undiluted wisdom.    From his verses we learn to approve of the well-known system of early  rising and early retiring, with many minor points about washing,  dressing, caring for the teeth and nails, and other mysteries of the  toilet. Then follow rules for behaviour in church, with directions to  preserve a quiet demeanour, and avoid improper use of the eyes or the  tongue. From the church the writer conducts his pupil to the  dinner-table, reciting many important details in carving, passing the  dishes properly, and performing the correct ablutions. He closes this  episode with the excellent advice that no harm can come from tempering  wine with water. After this comes the conversation in the drawing-room,  and many naive methods of raising interesting discussions are suggested.    Less highly gifted than the Troubadours were the Jongleurs, who composed  their retinue. These musical jacks-of-all-trades began as accompanists,  singing the songs of their master at the castles he visited. But soon  they grew numerous and independent, and occupied a station varying from  that of our public entertainers to that of the humblest street musician.  Nothing came amiss to them,--singing, playing all instruments, dancing,  imitating the calls of animals and birds, and even the juggling that has  derived its name from them. In the wandering life that they led, they  were often forced to take their wives and children along, and thus women  grew accustomed to take some part in the performances.    The glee-maidens were essentially an English institution, and no doubt  they were more sure of courtesy and protection in that country than on  the Continent. They were by far the most romantic figures of the  minstrel world. Often they would wander about the country alone and  unguarded, braving or avoiding the dangers of the road. Sometimes their  only escort was a pet dog or a goat. They arrayed themselves in small  garments of bright colours, often adorned with silver, while on their  feet were leather buskins. They were at home in the courtyards of  castles and monasteries no less than in the midst of villages and towns,  and, mounting on some slight knoll, they would entertain gentles and  commoners with voice and violin. They are often introduced into the  romances of early England, and many famous glee-maidens are found on the  pages of history. One of the most celebrated was Adeline, who lived in  the time of William the Conqueror, and was successful enough to be  rewarded by him with an estate.    In the reign of Henry III. we find one really great figure among the  glee-maidens,--Marie de France. She was the _Jongleuse_ of William  Longsword, son of Henry II. and Fair Rosamond, and he certainly deserves  the gratitude of the literary world for discovering and fostering her  wonderful talent. Born probably in Brittany, her life and works  identified her with the English. She was familiar with the Breton  tongue, and also with Latin. Her first production was a set of lays in  French verse, that met with instant popularity throughout England. The  courts of the nobles reechoed with her praises, and ladies as well as  knights were never weary of listening to her songs. Twelve of them are  now in the British Museum, among them a beautiful one dealing with King  Arthur and the Round Table. These works are of rare charm, no less for  their pleasing style and depth of feeling than for their simplicity of  expression and clearness of narrative. Her second effort was a poetical  rendering of many of AEsop's fables, done either as a favour or a  tribute of love for her protector. This was followed by a translation of  the Purgatory of St. Patrick in Ireland, taken from the Latin.    Few of the glee-maidens were so richly gifted or so highly placed as  Marie. Most of them travelled about, either alone or in the company of  glee-men, and were content with more ordinary compositions. At times  they were accompanied by dancing bears, who went through their figures  with the maidens, while the glee-men played, and tripped a fantastic  toe, if not exactly a light one.    The existence of the Jongleurs gradually undermined that of the  Troubadours, as the former grew more and more proficient. In the  thirteenth century we find Guirant Riquier, often called the last of the  Troubadours, requesting King Alfonso X. of Castile to make a definite  classification of Jongleurs, and title the best, thus preventing the  indiscriminate mixing of high and low musicians in the public mind. The  king made some effort to do so, but met with little success, for the  whole institution was gradually decaying. A more tragic fate awaited the  Troubadours of Provence, the home of the art. Espousing the cause of the  Albigenses, they used their wit with such telling effect that they  brought down upon themselves the deadly hatred of the Papists; and in  the short but bloody war that followed, they were almost wholly  exterminated in the cruel slaughter caused by the forces of religious  intolerance. Don Pedro of Aragon, who came to aid his brother  Troubadours, met with defeat and death, and after his loss the victors  started on a career of cruelty, torture, and indiscriminate murder. The  castles of the minstrel knights, once the home of beauty and song, were  razed to the ground, and the Troubadours were blotted from the page of  history.          CHAPTER III.    WIVES OF THE COMPOSERS      Among the women who have influenced music without actually creating it,  none have had greater chances to use their power than the wives of the  famous composers. Often they have been endowed with no inconsiderable  musical genius themselves, but have sacrificed their claim to renown  upon the altar of domestic duty. Sometimes, in rare instances, they have  had the ability to perform the double task of caring for the household  and continuing their own musical labours. Their story is an interesting  one, and from the time of the great John Sebastian Bach, who stands as a  model of domestic purity, down even to the present day, they have played  a large part in shaping the musical destinies of the world.    From the twelfth to the seventeenth century is a long gap, and music  underwent many changes during this period. After the passing of the  minstrel knights, popular music fades out of sight. That it had an  existence, however, is amply proven. The Jongleurs must have continued  long after their masters were stamped out, for their direct successors  are with us to-day, and our hand-organ is the descendant of their  fearful and wonderful organistrum. The entire school of English national  music saw its palmiest days during this epoch. Even on the Continent,  the great schools of contrapuntists delighted to show their skill by  employing as their cantus firmus, or chief part, some well-known popular  song, such as \"L'Homme Arme,\" for example.    In Germany, the mantle of the Minnesingers fell upon the guilds of  musical amateurs in the growing commercial cities. Less poetic than  their predecessors, these Mastersingers, as they named themselves, often  took refuge in arbitrary rules and set metrical forms that made a poor  substitute for real inspiration. That there was some genuine poetic  feeling and humour among them is shown by the work of Hans Sachs, the  greatest of their number. He wrote many poems and plays, of which the  \"Fassnachtspiele\" were the most popular and the most mirth-provoking.  Contrary to the version of his life given in Wagner's opera, he  succeeded in making a second marriage late in life; and contrary to the  general experience in such cases, the marriage was a happy one, for his  young wife was exceedingly proud of her famous husband. But in the  actual creative work of the Mastersingers woman played no part.    Sacred music and the science of composition flourished as never before.  There is an appropriate saying that old music was horizontal, while now  it is vertical; and the contrast between the interweaving of parts,  proceeding smoothly together, and our single melodies supported by  massive chords, is aptly illustrated by the remark. This very  interweaving led to a style of music that was extremely complex,  affording chances for intellectual and mathematical skill rather than  emotional fervour. It has been customary to say that this style of  composition was unsuited to women, and to pass over the epoch with the  casual remark that no women composers appear within its limits. But  modern research has shown the futility of this statement.    The records of the Netherland schools are meagre, so it is to Italy that  we must turn for the earliest examples of skilled women composers. The  first great name is that of Maddalena Casulana, who was born at Brescia  about 1540. Her published compositions took the shape of two volumes of  madrigals, issued in 1568 and 1583. Next in point of time comes Vittoria  Aleotti, a native of Argenta. Her _magnum opus_ was published at Venice,  in 1593, under the flowery title, "]]]
