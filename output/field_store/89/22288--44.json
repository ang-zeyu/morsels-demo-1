And from that hour  that disciple took her unto his own home.\"[14]    [Footnote 14: John, chapter xix. verses 26, 27.]    We can imagine the mother's anguish in seeing her son suffer this  cruel and ignominious death. He had lived only to do good, and now he  was dying an innocent sacrifice to his enemies. At such a moment the  mother might truly feel that a sword was piercing her soul, as the old  man Simeon[15] had once prophesied of her, many years before.    [Footnote 15: Luke, chapter ii. verse 35.]        \"Wearied was her heart with grieving,      Worn her breast with sorrow heaving,      Through her soul the sword had passed.        \"Ah! how sad and broken-hearted      Was that blessed mother, parted      From the God-begotten One!        \"How her loving heart did languish      When she saw the mortal anguish      Which o'erwhelmed her peerless Son.\"[16]    [Footnote 16: From _Stabat Mater_.]    Time passed, and Jesus now being dead, his friends were permitted by  the governor to remove him from the cross. Joseph of Arimathea took  the lead, as he was to lay the body in a new sepulchre recently made  in his garden. Nicodemus was also there, bringing linen and spices for  the burial, and the loving women lingered to see these preparations.    We can imagine how they might all stand aside to make room for the  mother Mary. Perhaps, indeed, they would withdraw a little way to  leave her for a moment alone with her son. The years seem to melt  away, and again she gathers him in her lap as when he was a babe. All  the motherly tenderness which she has had long pent up in her heart  now overflows. If she has sometimes felt a little lonely that in his  manhood he no longer needed her care, she forgets it now. He is still  her child.    The marble group by Michelangelo interprets such a moment for us. The  Italians call the subject the Pieta, which means compassion, but the  name scarcely expresses all the emotions of the mother. She seems  as strong and young as when she brooded over her babe in the Bethlehem  manger. \"Purity enjoys eternal youth\" was the sculptor's explanation  to those who objected.    [Illustration: THE PIETA. _St. Peter's, Rome._]    Across her capacious, motherly lap lies the slender, youthful figure  of the dead Christ. The head falls back, and the limbs are relaxed in  death. Suffering has left no trace on his face. The nail prints in  hands and feet, and the scar in the side, are the only signs of his  crucifixion. The delicately moulded body is beautiful in repose.    The mother seems to find mysterious comfort in gazing upon her son.  Perhaps his death has opened her eyes to the meaning of his life. If  this is so, she cannot grieve. He has finished the work given him to  do, and death is the beginning of immortality. So sorrow gives place  to resignation. She is again the proud mother. The fond hopes with  which she watched his childhood have been more than fulfilled. She  extends her hand in a gesture which seems to say, \"Behold and see.\"    It is said that certain Lombards, passing through the church where the  Pieta stood, ascribed the work to a Milanese sculptor named Cristoforo  Solari. Michelangelo, having overheard them, shut himself up in the  chapel, and chiselled his name upon the girdle which crosses the  Madonna's breast and supports her flowing garments. His name is not  found on any of his other works, and we can understand why he felt  proud of such a masterpiece. Though made when on the very threshold of  his career, it was never surpassed even in his later years. Some  other artist afterwards designed the two little bronze cherubs who  hold a crown over the Madonna's head. They are quite out of harmony  with the impressive dignity of the figures below.    Michelangelo's early love of Greek sculpture taught him many lessons,  which were worked out in this group. It has, first of all, that  perfect repose which was the leading trait in classic art. There is  nothing strained or violent in the positions. Besides this, the  figures are so arranged that on all sides, as in a Greek statue, the  lines are beautiful and harmonious.    But the subject itself is one which would have been too sad for the  pleasure-loving Greek. To the pagan the thought of death was something  to be avoided. Michelangelo's statue teaches the highest lesson of  religious faith,--the beauty of resigned sorrow and the sublimity of  sacrificing love.          VII    CHRIST TRIUMPHANT    (_Cristo Risorto_)      The character of Christ is so many-sided that when trying to fancy how  he looked while he lived in the world, everyone has probably a  different thought uppermost. The business man and the lawyer may  imagine the keen, searching glance which he turned upon those who  tried to entangle him with hard questions. A loving woman thinks  rather of the compassionate look with which he greeted the sisters of  Lazarus when they came to tell him that their brother was dead. The  physician may wonder how he looked when he spoke the commanding words  to those whom he healed.    Others dwell upon his sufferings as the Man of Sorrows, and often  think how sad he looked when he referred to the disciple who should  betray him. Lovers of nature like to imagine the look of pleasure on  his face in seeing the lilies growing in the field, or the expression  of eager inquiry with which he asked the fishermen what luck they had  had. Every boy and girl likes best to think of him smiling upon the  children, whom he called to him and took in his arms.    Now when an artist makes an ideal representation of Christ, he tries  to show us as many as possible of these elements of character combined  in one figure. So we may test the success of Michelangelo's statue of  Christ by searching out these various elements in it. We must also  know what incident the artist had in mind of which the work is an  illustration, so to speak.    The statue is called in Italian _Cristo Risorto_, that is, Christ  Risen or Triumphant, because the reference is to a circumstance not  recorded of his earthly career, but belonging to the time following  his resurrection. It is connected with a story told by St. Ambrose  about the apostle Peter. St. Peter, it is believed, spent the latter  part of his life in Rome, where the cruel emperor, Nero, was doing his  best to exterminate the Christians.    \"After the burning of Rome, Nero threw upon the Christians the  accusation of having fired the city. This was the origin of the first  persecution, in which many perished by terrible and hitherto  unheard-of deaths. The Christian converts besought Peter not to expose  his life, which was dear and necessary to the well-being of all; and  at length he consented to depart from Rome. But as he fled along the  Appian Way, about two miles from the gates, he was met by a vision of  our Saviour, travelling towards the city. Struck with amazement, he  exclaimed, 'Lord! whither goest thou?' (_Domine, quo vadis?_) to which  the Saviour, looking upon him with a mild sadness, replied, 'I go to  Rome to be crucified a second time,' and vanished. Peter, taking  this for a sign that he was to submit himself to the sufferings  prepared for him, immediately turned back, and reentered the city.\"[17]    [Footnote 17: From Mrs. Jameson's _Sacred and Legendary Art_, pages  200, 201.]    [Illustration: CHRIST TRIUMPHANT. _Church of S. Maria sopra Minerva,  Rome._]    It is this visionary figure of the Christ, appearing and disappearing  before the eyes of Peter, that Michelangelo represents in the statue.  He carries a cross not large enough for an actual crucifixion, as that  would be out of place here, but tall enough to show its real purpose.  He has also the long reed and the sponge which the soldier used to  give him a drink of vinegar and gall when he thirsted on the cross. A  bit of rope is a reminder of the scourging given him by the governor.    All these things he carries with him to Rome for a fresh martyrdom. It  is as if in walking along the way he suddenly meets Peter, and, at the  apostle's astonished question, he pauses, leaning a moment on the  cross, as he turns gently to reply.    Now as this is the Christ risen, or triumphant, the Christ who has  conquered death and the grave, Michelangelo wanted to do all he could  to make a noble-looking figure. The face is of the handsome type, with  regular features, which the Italians like to give to their ideal of  Christ. The expression of reproach is so gentle that one deserving  rebuke may well feel ashamed before it.    The sorrow in the face is such as Jesus might have shown as he turned  to Judas at the Last Supper. The gentleness in it is of the quality so  attractive to children. There is, too, something of the sympathetic  element in it which Mary and Martha found.    The countenance is not without intellectuality, though it scarcely  shows the keenness which the lawyers found it hard to outwit. It has  rather the refinement of a lover of all that is beautiful. Nor is  there much in expression or attitude to suggest the more commanding  qualities of Jesus. These stronger elements the statue seems to lack.    It is rather puzzling to one who is trying to form standards of taste  to learn that critics are divided in their opinion about this statue.  It is, therefore, well to know that Michelangelo is not wholly  responsible for the work as we now see it. Though he designed and  began it, he left it to some unskilful apprentices to finish. The  effect of the lines is injured by the bronze drapery which was added  later. A bronze sandal has also been put on the right foot to protect  it, as it had become much worn by kisses.    In criticising a statue one must always remember that it is best seen  in the surroundings for which it is designed. It is said, even by one  who does not greatly admire Michelangelo's Christ, that in the dim  light of the church where it stands, \"it diffuses a grace and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17213"],[0,"The Future of Islam (#7)"],[1,"    The early half of the last century was a period of religious stagnation  in Islam, almost as much as it was in Christendom. Faith, morals, and  religious practice were at the lowest ebb among Mussulmans, and it  seemed to Europeans who looked on as though the faith of Mecca had  attained its dotage, and was giving place to a non-curantist infidelity.  Politically and religiously the Mussulman world was asleep, when  suddenly it awoke, and like a young giant refreshed stood once more  erect in Arabia. The reform preached by Abd el Wahhab was radical. He  began by breaking with the maxim held by the mass of the orthodox that  inquiry on matters of faith was closed. He constituted himself a new  mujtahed and founded a new school, neither Hanafite, Malekite, nor  Shafite, and called it the school of the Unitarians, Muwaheddin, a name  still cherished by the Wahhabites. He rejected positively all traditions  but those of the companions of the Prophet, and he denied the claims of  any but the first four Caliphs to have been legitimately elected. The  Koran was to be the only written law, and Islam was to be again what it  had been in the first decade of its existence. He established it  politically in Nejd on precisely its old basis at Medina, and sought to  extend it over the whole of Arabia, perhaps of the world. I believe it  is hardly now recognised by Mohammedans how near Abd el Wahhab was to  complete success.    Before the close of the eighteenth century the chiefs of the Ibn Saouds,  champions of Unitarian Islam, had established their authority over all  Northern Arabia as far as the Euphrates, and in 1808 they took Mecca and  Medina. In the meanwhile the Wahhabite doctrines were gaining ground  still further afield. India was at one time very near conversion, and  in Egypt, and North Africa, and even in Turkey many secretly subscribed  to the new doctrines. Two things, however, marred the plan of general  reform and prevented its full accomplishment.    In the first place the reform was too completely reactive. It took no  account whatever of the progress of modern thought, and directly it  attempted to leave Arabia it found itself face to face with difficulties  which only political as well as religious success could overcome. It was  impossible, except by force of arms, to Arabianise the world again, and  nothing less than this was in contemplation. Its second mistake, and  that was one that a little of the Prophet's prudence which always went  hand in hand with his zeal might have avoided, was a too rigid  insistance upon trifles. Abd el Wahhab condemned minarets and tombstones  because neither were in use during the first years of Islam. The  minarets therefore were everywhere thrown down, and when the holy places  of Hejaz fell into the hands of his followers the tombs of saints which  had for centuries been revered as objects of pilgrimage were levelled to  the ground. Even the Prophet's tomb at Medina was laid waste and the  treasures it contained distributed among the soldiers of Ibn Saoud. This  roused the indignation of all Islam, and turned the tide of the  Wahhabite fortunes. Respectable feeling which had hitherto been on their  side now declared itself against them, and they never after regained  their position as moral and social reformers.    Politically, too, it was the cause of their ruin. The outside Mussulman  world, looking upon them as sacrilegious barbarians, was afraid to visit  Mecca, and the pilgrimage declined so rapidly that the Hejazi became  alarmed. The source of their revenue they found cut off, and it seemed  on the point of ceasing altogether. Then they appealed to  Constantinople, urging the Sultan to vindicate his claim to be protector  of the holy places. What followed is well known. After the peace of  Paris Sultan Mahmud commissioned Mehemet Ali to deliver Mecca and Medina  from the Wahhabite heretics, and this he in time effected. The war was  carried into Nejd; Deriyeh, their capital, was sacked, and Ibn Saoud  himself taken prisoner and decapitated in front of St. Sophia's at  Constantinople. The movement of reform in Islam was thus put back for,  perhaps, another hundred years.    Still the seed cast by Abd el Wahhab has not been entirely without  fruit. Wahhabism, as a political regeneration of the world, has failed,  but the spirit of reform has remained. Indeed, the present unquiet  attitude of expectation in Islam has been its indirect result. Just as  the Lutheran reformation in Europe, though it failed to convert the  Christian Church, caused its real reform, so Wahhabism has produced a  real desire for reform if not yet reform itself in Mussulmans. Islam is  no longer asleep, and were another and a wiser Abd el Wahhab to appear,  not as a heretic, but in the body of the Orthodox sect, he might play  the part of Loyola or Borromeo with success.    The present condition of the Wahhabites as a sect is one of decline. In  India, and I believe in other parts of Southern Asia, their missionaries  still make converts and their preachers are held in high esteem. But at  home in Arabia their zeal has waxed cold, giving place to liberal ideas  which in truth are far more congenial to the Arabian mind. The Ibn Saoud  dynasty no longer holds the first position in Nejd, and Ibn Rashid who  has taken their place, though nominally a Wahhabite, has little of the  Wahhabite fanaticism. He is in fact a popular and national rather than a  religious leader, and though still designated at Constantinople as a  pestilent heretic, is counted as their ally by the more liberal Sunites.  It is probable that he would not withhold his allegiance from a Caliph  of the legitimate house of Koreysh. But this, too, is beyond the subject  of the present chapter.    With the Wahhabites, then, our census of Islam closes. It has given us,  as I hope, a fairly accurate view of the forces which make up the  Mohammedan world, and though the enumeration of these cannot but be dull  work, I do not think it will have been work done in vain. Without it  indeed it would be almost impossible to make clear the problem presented  to us by modern Islam or guess its solution. More interesting matter,  however, lies before us, and in my next chapter I propose to introduce  my reader to that burning question of the day in Asia, the Caliphate,  and explain the position of the House of Othman towards the Mohammedan  world.

There is, moreover, a  Sheykh el Islam, also elected, who decides religious questions of  general importance, and a Grand Mufti appointed by the Government who  gives fetwas on matters of law. The latter is Hanefite, the former at  the present moment Shafite, as are the bulk of the students. These  number about fifteen hundred.

THE MODERN QUESTION OF THE CALIPHATE.      About the year 1515 of our era (921 of the Hejra), Selim I., Padishah of  the Ottoman Turks and Emperor of Constantinople, finding himself the  most powerful prince of his day in Islam, and wishing still further to  consolidate his rule, conceived the idea of reviving in his own person  the extinct glories of the Caliphate. He had more than one claim to be  considered their champion by orthodox Mohammedans, for he was the  grandson of that Mahomet II. who had finally extinguished the Roman  Empire of the East, and he had himself just ended a successful campaign  against the heretical Shah of Persia, head of the Sect of Ali. His only  rivals among Sunite princes were the Sultan el Hind, or, as we call him,  the Great Mogul, the Sultan el Gharb, or Emperor of Morocco, and the  Mameluke Sultan of Egypt, then known to the world as _par excellence_  the Sultan.    With the two former, as rulers of what were remote lands of Islam,  Selim seems to have troubled himself little; but he made war on Egypt.  In 1516 he invaded Syria, its outlying province, and in 1517 he entered  Cairo. There he made prisoner the reigning Mameluke, Kansaw el Ghouri,  and had him publicly beheaded, or according to another account, received  his head from a soldier, who had killed him where he lay on the ground  after falling (for the Sultan was an old man) from his horse. He then,  in virtue of a very doubtful cession made to him of his rights by one  Motawakkel Ibn Omar "]]]
