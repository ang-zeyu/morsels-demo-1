Ferrers, what have you been doing with Kenrick's  Exercises--I mean the key to it?\"    \"I!\" cried Ferrers, reddening violently; \"what--what do you mean,  Mortimer?\"    \"You have left the key on Louis' desk, to get him into a scrape--you  know you have.\"    \"Upon my word, Mortimer! what next!\" exclaimed Salisbury. \"Who do you  think would fash themselves about such a little hop-o'-my-thumb?\"    \"Will you let Ferrers answer!\" cried Reginald, imperiously.    Unconscious of the mistake he had made, Ferrers felt exceedingly  uncomfortable in his present position, and, assuming an air of  contemptuous indignation, he turned his back on Reginald, saying  as he did so, \"Such impertinence merits nothing but silent contempt.\"    \"You did it, you coward!\" cried Reginald, enraged almost beyond control.  \"I know you did, and _you_ know you did. Will you answer me?\"    \"Answer him, Ferrers, answer him at once, and let us have an end of his  impertinence,\" cried several voices: \"he's like a wild-cat.\"    \"Well then, I did not,\" said Ferrers, turning round with a violent  effort; \"will that satisfy you?\"    Reginald glared angrily and doubtfully on the changing countenance of  the speaker, and then burst out vehemently,    \"I don't believe a word you say: you did it either to spite him,  or you mistook your aim. Do you never use keys, Mr. Ferrers?\"    \"Really, Mortimer!\" exclaimed Trevannion, \"your language is very  intemperate and ungentlemanly. I have no doubt your brother knows  how to help himself; and now, for your comfort, know that I saw him  the other day with that same book, and here is Hamilton, who can  corroborate my statement.\"    \"Where? when?\" asked Reginald, in a subdued tone.    \"In the class-room alone, when he was writing his exercise. Hamilton,  am I not right?\"    Hamilton nodded.    \"Dr. Wilkinson will do justice to-morrow,\" said Reginald, as after  a moment's painful silence he looked up with assumed confidence,  and turned proudly away from Ferrers' reassured look of exultation,  though the latter hardly dared exult, for he thought Reginald had  mistaken the book, and feared the suspicions that might rest on  himself when it should be discovered that it was not a second-class  key. \"And now, Mortimer, let's have no more of this violent language,\"  said Hamilton. \"If the matter is to come before the doctor, he will  do all justice; let him be sole arbitrator; but I would not bring it  before him were I in your place. Make an apology to Ferrers, and say  nothing more. You will do your brother more harm than good.\"    \"_Make an apology_,\" said Reginald, ironically; \"I haven't changed  my mind yet. It must come before the doctor. Mr. Witworth found the  book, and has carried it by this time, or certainly will carry it,  to head-quarters.\"    \"Come along with me, and tell me the whole affair,\" said Hamilton.    While Reginald was unfolding the matter to Hamilton, the party they had  left was reinforced by Frank Digby, who warmly took Ferrers' part, and  enlightened the company as to many particulars of his cousin's former  character: and so much was said about the injury Reginald had done to  Ferrers by his suspicions, that when that youth discovered the certainty  of the mistake he had made, he was so far involved as to render it  impossible to him to acknowledge that even out of a spirit of teasing  he had placed the book near Louis; and his anxiety was so great to free  himself from any suspicion, that he was selfishly and ungenerously  insensible to the trouble entailed upon Louis, whom he disliked on  account of his superiority to himself, but on whom he had not seriously  contemplated inflicting so great an injury--so imperceptibly does one  fault lead to another, so unable are we to decide where the effects of  one false step, one dishonest thought, shall end.    The story was soon spread among Louis' immediate companions, who were  anxious to learn the cause of his swollen eyes and sad demeanor, and  Louis had to endure many sneers, and, what was still harder to bear,  much silent contempt from those whose high sense of honor made them  despise any approach to the meanness of which he was supposed guilty.  Hamilton, though in the study the whole evening, took no notice of him,  and when his eyes met Louis', they bore no more consciousness of his  presence than if he had been a piece of stone. Frank Digby did not  tease Louis, but he let fall many insinuations, and a few remarks so  bitter in their sarcasm, that Reginald more than once looked up with  a glance so threatening in its fierceness, that it checked even that  audacious speaker. Even little Alfred was not allowed to sit with Louis;  though Hamilton made no remark, nor even alluded to the subject to his  brother, he called him immediately to himself, and only allowed him to  leave him at bed-time.    As the elder boys went up stairs to bed, Frank continued his aggravating  allusions to Louis' weakness, but in so covert a manner, that no one but  those acquainted with Louis' former history could have understood their  import. For some time Reginald pretended not to hear them; there was a  strong struggle within him, for his high spirit rose indignantly at his  cousin's unkindness, yet was for some time checked by a better feeling  within; but, at length, on Frank's making some peculiarly insulting  remark in a low tone, his pent-up ire boiled forth, and, in the madness  of his fury, he seized on his cousin with a strength that passion  rendered irresistible. \"You've tried to provoke me to this all the  evening--you _will_ have it, you dastardly coward! you WILL have  it, will you?\"    These exclamations were poured forth in a shout, and Reginald, after  striking his cousin several violent blows, threw him from him with such  force that his head struck against the door-post, and he fell motionless  to the ground, the blood streaming from a wound in his forehead.    There was an awful silence for a minute. The boys, horror-struck, stood  as if paralyzed, gazing on the inanimate form of their school-fellow.  Reginald's passion subsided in an instant; his face turned pale, the  color fled from his lips, and clasping his hands in terror, he muttered,  \"Oh! what have I done!\" and then there was a shout, \"Oh, Frank Digby's  killed! Digby's killed--he's dead!\"    Hamilton at length pushed forward and raised Frank's head. And at this  moment Mr. Norton and Dr. Wilkinson, with two or three of the servants,  came from different directions. The crowd round Frank made way for the  doctor, who hurriedly approached, and assisted Hamilton to raise Frank  and carry him to his bed.    \"He's dead, he's dead!\" cried the boys all round.    \"How did this happen?\" asked the doctor, and without waiting for an  answer he tore open the handkerchief and collar of the insensible youth,  and dispatched some one immediately for a medical man. One was sent for  a smelling-bottle, another for some water, and Mrs. Wilkinson soon made  her appearance with a fan, and other apparatus for restoring a fainting  person. But it was long before there were any signs of returning life.  It was a terrible time for Reginald. It was agony to look on the  motionless form, and blood-streaked countenance before him--to watch  the cloud of anxiety that seemed to deepen on his master's face as  each new restorative failed its accustomed virtue,--to listen to the  subdued murmurs and fearful whispers, and to note the blanched faces  of his school-fellows. He stood with clasped hands, and there was a  prayer in his heart that he might not be called to suffer so very  deeply for this sinful expression of his temper. What if he should  have sent his cousin unprepared into eternity? Oh, what would he  give to see one motion; what, that he had been able to restrain his  ungovernable fury! There was almost despair in his wild thoughts, when  at last Frank sighed faintly, and then opened his eyes. He closed them  immediately, and just then the surgeon arriving, more potent remedies  were used, and he was at length restored to consciousness, though  unable to speak aloud. Doctor Wilkinson had him removed to another  room, and after seeing him comfortably arranged, returned to Reginald's  bedroom.    \"Now, how did this happen?\" he said.    No one spoke, and the silence was only broken by the sound of sobs from  the further end of the room.    \"Who did this?\" asked the doctor again.    \"I did, sir,\" said Reginald, in a broken voice.    \"Come forward. Who is it that speaks?\" said Doctor Wilkinson. \"Mortimer!  is this some passion of yours that has so nearly caused the death of  your cousin? I am deeply grieved to find that your temper is still so  ungovernable. What was the matter?\"    Reginald was incapable of answering, and none of his companions  understood the quarrel; so Doctor Wilkinson left the room, determined  to make a strict investigation the next morning.    Poor Reginald was almost overwhelmed: he knelt with his brother after  their candle was extinguished, by their bedside, and both wept bitterly,  though quite silently. Distress at his own fault, and his brother's  new trouble, and deep thankfulness that his cousin was alive, and not  dangerously hurt, filled Reginald's mind, and kept him awake long after  all besides in the room were asleep.          CHAPTER IV.      The next morning, after the early school-hours, Doctor Wilkinson kept  Reginald back as he was following the stream to breakfast, and led  the way into the class-room, where, after closing the door, he seated  himself, and motioning Reginald to draw closer to him, thus opened  his inquiry.    \"I wish to know, Mortimer, how this affair began last night: it appears,  from all I can make out, to have been a most unprovoked attack on your  part, but as there is often more than appears on the surface, I shall  be glad to hear what"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19856"],[0,"A Study of Pueblo Architecture: Tusayan and Cibola (#7)"],[1,"over 400 feet above Sikyátki.  Their roughly leveled summits measure 20 by 10 feet and are covered with  traces of house walls; and it is evident that groups of small-roomed  houses were clustered also around the sloping sides. About a hundred  yards south from their dwellings the people of the mounds built for  their own protection a strong wall entirely across the mesa, which at  that point is contracted to about 200 feet in width, with deep vertical  cliffs on either side. The base of the wall is still quite distinct, and  is about 3 feet thick.    But no reconciliation was ever effected between the Walpi and the  Sikyátki and their allies, and in spite of their defensive wall frequent  assaults were made upon the latter until they were forced to retreat.  The greater number of them retired to Oraibi and the remainder to  Sikyátki, and the feud was still maintained between them and the Walpi.      [Illustration: Plate VII. Horn House ruin, plan.]    Some of the incidents as well as the disastrous termination of this feud  are still narrated. A party of the Sikyátki went prowling through Walpi  one day while the men were afield, and among other outrages, one of them  shot an arrow through a window and killed a chief's daughter while she  was grinding corn. The chief's son resolved to avenge the death of his  sister, and some time after this went to Sikyátki, professedly to take  part in a religious dance, in which he joined until just before the  close of the ceremony. Having previously observed where the handsomest  girl was seated among the spectators on the house terraces, he ran up  the ladder as if to offer her a prayer emblem, but instead he drew out a  sharp flint knife from his girdle and cut her throat. He threw the body  down where all could see it, and ran along the adjoining terraces till  he cleared the village. A little way up the mesa was a large flat rock,  upon which he sprang and took off his dancer's mask so that all might  recognize him; then turning again to the mesa he sped swiftly up the  trail and escaped.    And so foray and slaughter continued to alternate between them until the  planting season of some indefinite year came around. All the Sikyátki  men were to begin the season by planting the fields of their chief on a  certain day, which was announced from the housetop by the Second Chief  as he made his customary evening proclamations, and the Walpi, becoming  aware of this, planned a fatal onslaught. Every man and woman able to  draw a bow or wield a weapon were got in readiness and at night they  crossed the mesa and concealed themselves along its edge, overlooking  the doomed village. When the day came they waited until the men had gone  to the field and then rushed down upon the houses. The chief, who was  too old to go afield, was the first one killed, and then followed the  indiscriminate slaughter of women and children, and the destruction of  the houses. The wild tumult in the village alarmed the Sikyátki and they  came rushing back, but too late to defend their homes. Their struggles  were hopeless, for they had only their planting sticks to use as  weapons, which availed but little against the Walpi with their bows and  arrows, spears, slings, and war clubs. Nearly all of the Sikyátki men  were killed, but some of them escaped to Oraibi and some to Awatubi. A  number of the girls and younger women were spared, and distributed among  the different villages, where they became wives of their despoilers.    It is said to have been shortly after the destruction of Sikyátki that  the first serious inroad of a hostile tribe occurred within this region,  and all the stories aver that these early hostiles were from the north,  the Ute being the first who are mentioned, and after them the Apache,  who made an occasional foray.    While these families of Hopituh stock had been building their straggling  dwellings along the canyon brinks, and grouping in villages around the  base of the East Mesa, other migratory bands of Hopituh had begun to  arrive on the Middle Mesa. As already said, it is admitted that the  Snake were the first occupants of this region, but beyond that fact the  traditions are contradictory and confused. It is probable, however, that  not long after the arrival of the Horn, the Squash people came from the  south and built a village on the Middle Mesa, the ruin of which is  called Chukubi. It is on the edge of the cliff on the east side of the  neck of that mesa, and a short distance south of the direct trail  leading from Walpi to Oraibi. The Squash people say that they came from  Palát Kwabi, the Red Land in the far South, and this vague term  expresses nearly all their knowledge of that traditional land. They say  they lived for a long time in the valley of the Colorado Chiquito,  on the south side of that stream and not far from the point where the  railway crosses it. They still distinguish the ruin of their early  village there, which was built as usual on the brink of a canyon, and  call it Etípsíkya, after a shrub that grows there profusely. They  crossed the river opposite that place, but built no permanent houses  until they reached the vicinity of Chukubi, near which two smaller  clusters of ruins, on knolls, mark the sites of dwellings which they  claim to have been theirs. Three groups (nyumu) traveling together were  the next to follow them; these were the Bear, the Bear-skin-rope, and  the Blue Jay. They are said to have been very numerous, and to have come  from the vicinity of San Francisco Mountain. They did not move up to  Chukubi, but built a large village on the summit, at the south end of  the mesa, close to the site of the present Mashongnavi. Soon afterward  came the Burrowing Owl, and the Coyote, from the vicinity of Navajo  Mountains in the north, but they were not very numerous. They also built  upon the Mashongnavi summit.    After this the Squash people found that the water from their springs was  decreasing, and began moving toward the end of the mesa, where the other  people were. But as there was then no suitable place left on the summit,  they built a village on the sandy terrace close below it, on the west  side; and as the springs at Chukubi ultimately ceased entirely, the rest  of the Squash people came to the terrace and were again united in one  village. Straggling bands of several other groups, both wingwu and  nyumu, are mentioned as coming from various directions. Some built on  the terrace and some found house room in Mashongnavi. This name is  derived as follows: On the south side of the terrace on which the Squash  village was built is a high column of sandstone which is vertically  split in two, and formerly there was a third pillar in line, which has  long since fallen. These three columns were called Tútuwalha, the  guardians, and both the Squash village and the one on the summit were so  named. On the north side of the terrace, close to the present village,  is another irregular massy pillar of sandstone called Mashóniniptu,  meaning \"the other which remains erect,\" having reference to the one on  the south side, which had fallen. When the Squash withdrew to the summit  the village was then called Mashóniniptuovi, \"at the place of the other  which remains erect;\" now that term is never used, but always its  syncopated form, Mashongnavi.      [Illustration: Plate VIII. Bat House.]    The Squash village, on the south end of the Middle Mesa, was attacked by  a fierce band that came from the north, some say the Ute, others say the  Apache; but whoever the invaders were, they completely overpowered the  people, and carried off great stores of food and other plunder. The  village was then evacuated, the houses dismantled, and the material  removed to the high summit, where they reconstructed their dwellings  around the village which thenceforth bore its present name of  Mashongnavi. Some of the Squash people moved over to Oraibi, and  portions of the Katchina and Paroquet people came from there to  Mashongnavi about the same time, and a few of these two groups occupied  some vacant houses also in Shupaulovi; for this village even at that  early date had greatly diminished in population, having sustained a  disastrous loss of men in the canyon affrays east of Walpi.    Shumopavi seems to have been built by portions of the same groups who  went to the adjacent Mashongnavi, but the traditions of the two villages  are conflicting. The old traditionists at Shumopavi hold that the first  to come there were the Paroquet, the Bear, the Bear-skin-rope, and the  Blue Jay. They came from the west--probably from San Francisco Mountain.  They claim that ruins on a mesa bluff about 10 miles south from the  present village are the remains of a village built by these groups  before reaching Shumopavi, and the Paroquets arrived first, it is said,  because they were perched on the heads of the Bears, and, when nearing  the water, they flew in ahead of the others. These groups built a  village on a broken terrace, on the east side of the cliff, and just  below the present village. There is a spring close by called after the  Shunóhu, a tall red grass, which grew abundantly there, and from which  the town took its name. This spring was formerly very large, but two  years ago a landslide completely buried it; lately, however, a small  outflow is again apparent.    The ruins of the early village cover a hillocky area of about 800 by 250  feet, but it is impossible to trace much of the ground plan with  accuracy. The corner of an old house still stands, some 6 or 8 feet  high, extending about 15 feet on one face and about 10 feet on the  other. The wall is over 3 feet in thickness, but of very clumsy masonry,  no care having been exercised in dressing the stones, which are of  varying sizes and laid in mud plaster. Interest attaches to this  fragment, as it is one of the few tangible evidences left of the Spanish  priests who engaged in "]]]
