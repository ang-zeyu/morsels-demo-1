The thorns had all blossomed into roses that scented the  air with fragrance as he went by. Primroses sprang up before his feet  and made a pathway to lead him straight to the castle gates; and the  birds suddenly broke forth into singing, as if to tell the world that  the hundred years of enchantment were over, and the Princess about to  be awakened from her long sleep.    The Prince passed through the council chamber, where the King and his  councillors were sleeping; through the room where the Queen and her  ladies slept. He passed on from hall to hall, climbed from stair to  stair, until at last he reached the tower chamber where the sleeping  Princess lay. For a moment he stood and gazed in wonder at her lovely  face; then he sank on his knees beside her, and kissed her as she lay  asleep.    Instantly the spell was broken. The King and Queen awoke, and all the  courtiers with them; the horses neighed in the stables, and shook their  glossy manes; the pigeons cooed upon the roof; the flies on the wall  moved again; the fire burnt up brightly; and the meat in the kitchen  began to frizzle once more as the spit turned round. The cook gave the  kitchen boy the tremendous box on the ear that she had started to give  him a hundred years ago, and everything and everybody went on just as  usual, as if nothing at all out of the common had occurred.    And up in the tower chamber the Princess opened her eyes to meet the  gaze of the Prince, who had dared to risk his life for her sake. What  they said to each other nobody quite knows, for nobody was there to  hear or see. But whatever it was, it must have been something very  satisfactory; for very soon after they were married, and lived happily  ever afterwards.    [Illustration]          PUSS-IN-BOOTS    [Illustration]      There was once a Miller, who, at his death, had nothing to leave to his  three sons except his mill, his ass, and his cat. The eldest son took  the mill, the second took the ass--and as for the youngest, all that  remained for him was the cat.    The youngest son grumbled at this. \"My brothers,\" said he, \"will be able  to earn an honest living; but when I have eaten my cat and sold his skin  I shall die of hunger.\"    The Cat, who was sitting beside him, overheard this.    [Illustration]    \"Nay, Master,\" he said, \"don't take such a gloomy view of things. If you  will get me a pair of boots made so that I can walk through the brambles  without hurting my feet, and give me a bag, you shall soon see what I am  worth.\"    The Cat's master was so surprised to hear his Cat talking, that he at  once got him what he wanted. The Cat drew on the boots and slung the  bag round his neck and set off for a rabbit warren. When he got there  he filled his bag with bran and lettuces, and stretching himself out  beside it as if dead, waited until some young rabbit should be tempted  into the bag. This happened very soon. A fat, thoughtless rabbit went  in headlong, and the Cat at once jumped up, pulled the strings and  killed him.    Puss was very proud of his success, and, going to the King's palace, he  asked to speak to the King. When he was shown into the King's presence  he bowed respectfully, and, laying the rabbit down before the throne,  he said--    \"Sire, here is a rabbit, which my master, the Marquis of Carabas,  desires me to present to your Majesty.\"    \"Tell your master,\" said the King, \"that I accept his present, and am  very much obliged to him.\"    A few days later, the Cat went and hid himself in a cornfield and laid  his bag open as before. This time two splendid partridges were lured  into the trap, and these also he took to the Palace and presented to the  King from the Marquis of Carabas. The King was very pleased with this  gift, and ordered the messenger of the Marquis of Carabas to be  handsomely rewarded.    [Illustration]    For two or three months the Cat went on in this way, carrying game every  day to the Palace, and saying it was sent by the Marquis of Carabas.    At last the Cat happened to hear that the King was going to take a drive  on the banks of the river, with his daughter, the most beautiful  Princess in the world. He at once went to his master.    \"Master,\" said he, \"if you follow my advice, your fortune will be made.  Go and bathe in the river at a place I shall show you, and I will do the  rest.\"    \"Very well,\" said the Miller's son, and he did as the Cat told him. When  he was in the water, the Cat took away his clothes and hid them, and  then ran to the road, just as the King's coach went by, calling out as  loudly as he could--    \"Help, help! The Marquis of Carabas will be drowned.\"    The King looked out of the carriage window, and when he saw the Cat who  had brought him so many fine rabbits and partridges, he ordered his  bodyguards to fly at once to the rescue of the Marquis of Carabas.    Then the Cat came up to the carriage and told the King that while his  master was bathing some robbers had stolen all his clothes. The King  immediately ordered one of his own magnificent suits of clothes to be  taken to the Marquis; so when the Miller's son appeared before the  monarch and his daughter, he looked so handsome, and was so splendidly  attired, that the Princess fell in love with him on the spot.    The King was so struck with his appearance that he insisted upon his  getting into the carriage to take a drive with them.    The Cat, delighted with the way his plans were turning out, ran on  before. He reached a meadow where some peasants were making hay.    \"Good people,\" said he, \"if you do not tell the King, when he comes this  way, that the meadow you are mowing belongs to the Marquis of Carabas,  you shall all be chopped up into little pieces.\"    When the King came by, he stopped to ask the haymakers to whom the  meadow belonged.    \"To the Marquis of Carabas, if it please Your Majesty,\" answered they,  trembling, for the Cat's threat had frightened them terribly.    The Cat, who continued to run before the carriage, now came to some  reapers.    \"Good people,\" said he, \"if you do not tell the King that all this corn  belongs to the Marquis of Carabas, you shall all be chopped up into  little pieces.\"    [Illustration]    The King again stopped to ask to whom the land belonged, and the  reapers, obedient to the Cat's command, answered--    \"To the Marquis of Carabas, please Your Majesty.\"    And all the way the Cat kept running on before the carriage, repeating  the same instructions to all the laborers he came to; so that the King  became very astonished at the vast possessions of the Marquis of  Carabas.    At last the Cat arrived at a great castle, where an Ogre lived who was  very rich, for all the lands through which the King had been riding were  part of his estate. The Cat knocked at the castle door, and asked to see  the Ogre.    The Ogre received him very civilly, and asked him what he wanted.    \"If you please, sir,\" said the Cat, \"I have heard that you have the  power of changing yourself into any sort of animal you please--and I  came to see if it could possibly be true.\"    \"So I have,\" replied the Ogre, and in a moment he turned himself into a  lion. This gave the Cat a great fright, and he scrambled up the curtains  to the ceiling.    \"Indeed, sir,\" he said, \"I am now quite convinced of your power to turn  yourself into such a huge animal as a lion; but I do not suppose you can  change yourself into a small one--such as a mouse, for instance?\"    \"Indeed, I can,\" cried the Ogre, indignantly; and in a moment the lion  had vanished, while a little brown mouse frisked about the floor.    In less than half a second the Cat sprang down from the curtains and,  pouncing upon the mouse, ate him all up before the Ogre had time to  return to any other shape.    And when the King arrived at the castle gates, there stood the Cat upon  the doorstep, bowing and saying--    \"Welcome to the castle of the Marquis of Carabas!\"    The Marquis helped the King and the Princess to alight, and the Cat led  them into a great hall, where a feast had been spread for the Ogre.    The King was so delighted with the good looks, the charming manners, and  the great wealth of the Marquis of Carabas, that he said the Marquis  must marry his daughter.    The Marquis, of course, replied that he should be only too happy; and  the very next day he and the Princess were married.    As for the Cat, he was given the title of Puss-in-Boots, and ever after  only caught mice for his own amusement.    [Illustration]          ADVENTURES OF TOM THUMB    [Illustration]      A long time ago, a woodcutter lived with his wife in a small cottage not  far from a great forest. They had seven children--all boys; and the  youngest was the smallest little fellow ever seen. He was called Tom  Thumb. But though he was so small, he was far cleverer than any of his  brothers, and he heard a great deal more than anybody ever imagined.    It happened that just at this time there was a famine in the land, and  the woodcutter and his wife became so poor that they could no longer  give their boys enough to eat.    One night--after the boys had gone to bed--the husband sighing deeply,  said--    \"We cannot feed our children any longer, and to see them starve before  our eyes is more than I can bear. To-morrow morning, therefore, we will  take them into the forest and leave them in the thickest part of it, so  that they will not be able to find their"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20750"],[0,"Journal of the Proceedings of the Linnean Society - Vol. 3 (#7)"],[1,"broad incomplete  annulus on the antennae beyond their middle.
