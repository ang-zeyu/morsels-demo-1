She whipped him, she slashed him,    She rode him through the mire;    I would not lend my pony now,    For all the lady's hire.        I went to the wood and got it;    I sat me down and looked at it;    The more I looked at it the less I liked it,    And I brought it home because I couldn't help it.

[Illustration]      Mary had a pretty bird,--      Feathers bright and yellow;    Slender legs, upon my word,      He was a pretty fellow--    The sweetest notes he always sung,      Which much delighted Mary;    And near the cage she'd ever sit,      To hear her own canary.

VI      Mary Chavah sent her letter of blunt directions concerning her sister's  headstone and the few belongings which her sister had wished her to  have. The last lines of the letter were about the boy.    \"Send the little one along. I am not the one, but I don't know what else  to tell you to do with him. Let me know when to expect him, and put his  name in with his things--I can't remember his right name.\"    When the answer came from John Blood, a fortnight later, it said that a  young fellow of those parts was starting back home shortly to spend  Christmas, and would take charge of the child as far as the City, and  there put him on his train for Old Trail Town. She would be notified  just what day to expect him, and John knew how glad his mother would  have been and his father too, and he was her grateful Nephew. P. S. He  would send some money every month \"toward him.\"    The night after she received this letter, Mary lay long awake, facing  what it was going to mean to have him there: to have a child there.    She recalled what she had heard other women say about it,--stray  utterances, made with the burdened look that hid a secret complacency, a  kind of pleased freemasonry in a universal lot.    \"The children bring so much sand into the house. You'd think it was  horses.\"    \"... the center table looks loaded and ready to start half the time ...  but I can't help it, with the children's books and truck.\"    \"... never would have another house built without a coat closet. The  children's cloaks and caps and rubbers litter up everything.\"    \"... every one of their knees out, and their underclothes outgrown, and  their waists soiled, the whole time. And I do try so hard....\"    Now with all these bewilderments she was to have to do. She wondered if  she would know how to dress him. Once she had watched Mis' Winslow dress  a child, and she remembered what unexpected places Mis' Winslow had  buttoned--buttonholes that went _up and down_ in the skirt bands, and so  on. Armholes might be too small and garters too tight, and how was one  ever to know? If it were a little girl now ... but a little boy.... What  would she talk to him about while they ate together?    [Illustration: \"HE STOOD LOOKING AT IT FROM PART WAY ACROSS THE ROAD\"]    She lay in the dark and planned--with no pleasure, but merely because  she always planned everything, her dress, her baking, what she would say  to this one and that. She would put up a stove in the back parlour, and  give him the room \"off.\" She was glad that the parlour was empty and  clean--\"no knick-knacks for a boy to knock around,\" she found herself  thinking. And a child would like the bedroom wallpaper, with the owl  border. When Summer came he could have the room over the dining room,  with the kitchen roof sloping away from it where he could dry his  hazelnuts--she had thought of the pasture hazelnuts, first thing. There  were a good many things a boy would like about the place: the bird house  where the martins always built, the hens, the big hollow tree, the  pasture ant hill.... She would have to find out the things he liked to  eat. She would have to help him with his lessons--she could do that for  only a little while, until he would be too old to need her. Then maybe  there would come the time when he would ask her things that she would  not know....    She fell asleep wondering how he would look. Already, not from any  impatience to have this done, but because that was the way in which she  worked, she had his room in order; and her picture of his father was by  the mirror, the young face of his father. Something faded had been  written below the picture, and this she had painstakingly rubbed away  before she set the picture in its place. Next day, while she was working  on Mis' Jane Moran's bead basque that was to be cut over and turned, she  laid it aside and cut out a jacket pattern, and a plaited waist  pattern--just to see if she could. These she rolled up impatiently and  stuffed away in her pattern bookcase.    \"I knew how to do them all the while, and I never knew I knew,\" she  thought with annoyed surprise. \"I s'pose I'll waste a lot of time  pottering over him.\"    It was so that she spent the weeks until the letter came telling her  what day the child would start. On the afternoon of the day the letter  came, she went down town to the Amos Ames Emporium to buy a washbasin  and pitcher for the room she meant the little boy to have. She stood  looking at a basin with a row of brown dogs around the rim, when over  her shoulder Mis' Abby Winslow spoke.    \"You ain't buying a Christmas present for anybody, are you?\" she asked  warningly.    Mary started guiltily and denied it.    \"Well, what in time do you want with dogs on the basin?\" Mis' Winslow  demanded.    Almost against her own wish, Mary told her. Mis' Winslow was one of  those whose faces are invariable forerunners of the sort of thing they  are going to say. With eyebrows, eyes, forehead, head, and voice she  took the news.    \"He is! Forever and ever more. When's he going to get here?\"    \"Week after next,\" Mary said listlessly. \"It's an awful responsibility,  ain't it--taking a child so?\"    Mis' Winslow's face abruptly rejected its own anxious lines and let the  eyes speak for it.    \"I always think children is like air,\" she said; \"you never realize how  hard they're pressing down on you--but you do know you can't live  without them.\"    Mary looked at her, her own face not lighting.    \"I'd rather go along like I am,\" she said; \"I'm used to myself the way I  am.\"    \"Mary Chavah!\" said Mis' Winslow, sharply, \"a vegetable sprouts. Can't  you? Is these stocking caps made so's they won't ravel?\" she inquired  capably of Abel Ames. \"These are real good value, Mary,\" she added  kindly. \"Better su'prise the little thing with one of these. A red one.\"    Mary counted over her money, and bought the red stocking cap and the  basin with the puppies. Then she went into the street. The sense of  oppression, of striving, that had seldom left her since that night in  the stable, made the day a thing to be borne, to be breasted. The air  was thick with snow, and in the whiteness the dreary familiarity of the  drug store, the meat market, the post office, the Simeon Buck Dry Goods  Exchange, smote her with a passion to escape from them all, to breed new  familiars, to get free of the thing that she had said she would do.    \"And I could,\" she thought; \"I could telegraph to John not to send him.  But Jenny--she can't. I don't see how she stands it....\"    The thought may have been why, instead of going home, she went to see  Jenny. A neighbor was in the sitting room with Mrs. Wing. Jenny met Mary  at the kitchen door and stood against a background of clothes drying on  lines stretched indoors.    \"Don't you want to come upstairs?\" Jenny said. \"There ain't a fire up  there--but I can show you the things.\"    She had put them all in the bottom drawer, as women always do; and, as  women always do, had laid them so that all the lace and embroidery and  pink ribbons possible showed in a flutter when the drawer was opened.  Jenny took the things out, one at a time, unfolded, discussed, compared,  with all the tireless zeal of a robin with a straw in its mouth or of a  tree, blossoming. \"Smell of them,\" Jenny bade her. \"Honestly, wouldn't  you know by the smell who they are for?\" \"I donno but you would,\" Mary  admitted awkwardly, and marveled dumbly at the newness Jenny was  feeling in that which, after all, was not new!    When these things were all out, a little tissue-paper parcel was left  lying in the drawer.    \"There's one more,\" Mary said.    Jenny flushed, hesitated, lifted it.    \"That's nothing,\" she said; \"before I came I made some little things for  its Christmas. I thought maybe it would come first, and we'd have the  Christmas in my room, and I made some little things--just for fun, you  know. But it won't be fair to do it now, with the whole town so set  against our having any Christmas. Mary, it just seems as though I had to  have a Christmas this year!\"    \"Oh, well,\" said Mary, \"the baby'll be your Christmas. The town can't  help that, I guess.\"    \"I know,\" Jenny flashed back brightly, \"you and I have got the best of  them, haven't we? We've each got one present coming, anyway.\"    \"I s'pose we have....\" Mary said.    She looked at Jenny's Christmas things--a ribbon rattle, a crocheted  cap, a first picture book, a cascade of colored rings--and then in grim  humour at Jenny.    \"It'll never miss its Christmas,\" she said dryly.    \"Don't you think so?\" said Jenny, soberly. \"I donno. It seems as if it'd  be kind o' lonesome to get born around Christmas and not find any going  on.\"    She put the things away, and closed the drawer. For no appreciable  reason, she kept it locked, and the key under the bureau cover.    \"Do you know yet when yours is coming?\" Jenny asked, as she rose.    \"Week after next,\" Mary repeated,--\"two weeks from last night,\" she  confessed, \"if he comes straight through.\"    \"I think,\" said Jenny, \"I think mine will be here--before then.\"    When they reached the foot of the stair, Mary unexpectedly refused to go  in the sitting room.    \"No,\" she said, \"I must be getting home. I just come out for a minute,  anyway. I'm--I'm much obliged for what you showed me,\" she added, and  hesitated. \"I've got his room fixed up real nice. There's owls on the  wall paper and puppies on the washbasin,\" she said. \"Come in when you  can and see it.\"    It was almost dusk when Mary reached home. While she was passing the  billboard at the corner--a flare of yellow letters, as if Colour and the  Alphabet had united to breed a monster--she heard children shouting. A  block"]]]
