I've lived, since then, in calm and strife,  Full fifty summers a sailor's life,  With wealth to spend and a power to range,  But never have sought nor sighed for change;  And Death, whenever he comes to me,  Shall come on the wild, unbounded sea.        _Barry Cornwall._          Diffidence      \"I'm after axin', Biddy dear--\"    And here he paused a while  To fringe his words the merest mite    With something of a smile--  A smile that found its image    In a face of beauteous mold,  Whose liquid eyes were peeping    From a broidery of gold.    \"I've come to ax ye, Biddy dear,    If--\" then he stopped again,  As if his heart had bubbled o'er    And overflowed his brain.  His lips were twitching nervously    O'er what they had to tell,  And timed the quavers with the eyes    That gently rose and fell.    \"I've come--\" and then he took her hands    And held them in his own,  \"To ax--\" and then he watched the buds    That on her cheeks had blown,--  \"Me purty dear--\" and then he heard    The throbbing of her heart,  That told how love had entered in    And claimed its every part.    \"Och! don't be tazin' me,\" said she,    With just the faintest sigh,  \"I've sinse enough to see you've come,    But what's the reason why?\"  \"To ax--\" and once again the tongue    Forbore its sweets to tell,  \"To ax--_if Mrs. Mulligan,    Has any pigs to sell_.\"          Curfew Must Not Ring To-night      Slowly England's sun was setting o'er the hilltops far away,  Filling all the land with beauty at the close of one sad day,  And the last rays kissed the forehead of a man and maiden fair,--  He with footsteps slow and weary, she with sunny floating hair;  He with bowed head, sad and thoughtful, she with lips all cold and white,  Struggling to keep back the murmur, \"Curfew must not ring to-night.\"    \"Sexton,\" Bessie's white lips faltered, pointing to the prison old,  With its turrets tall and gloomy, with its walls dark, damp and cold,  \"I've a lover in that prison, doomed this very night to die  At the ringing of the curfew, and no earthly help is nigh;  Cromwell will not come till sunset,\" and her lips grew strangely white  As she breathed the husky whisper: \"Curfew must not ring to-night.\"    \"Bessie,\" calmly spoke the sexton--every word pierced her young heart  Like the piercing of an arrow, like a deadly poisoned dart,--  \"Long, long years I've rung the curfew from that gloomy shadowed tower;  Every evening, just at sunset, it has told the twilight hour;  I have done my duty ever, tried to do it just and right;  Now I'm old I will not falter,--curfew, it must ring to-night.\"    Wild her eyes and pale her features, stern and white her thoughtful brow.  As within her secret bosom Bessie made a solemn vow.  She had listened while the judges read without a tear or sigh:  \"At the ringing of the curfew, Basil Underwood must die.\"  And her breath came fast and faster, and her eyes grew large and bright;  In an undertone she murmured, \"Curfew must not ring to-night.\"    With quick step she bounded forward, sprung within the old church door,  Left the old man treading slowly paths so oft he'd trod before;  Not one moment paused the maiden, but with eye and cheek aglow  Mounted up the gloomy tower, where the bell swung to and fro,--  As she climbed the dusty ladder on which fell no ray of light,  Up and up,--her white lips saying: \"Curfew must not ring to-night.\"    She has reached the topmost ladder; o'er her hangs the great, dark bell;  Awful is the gloom beneath her, like the pathway down to hell.  Lo, the ponderous tongue is swinging--'tis the hour of curfew now,  And the sight has chilled her bosom, stopped her breath and paled her brow.  Shall she let it ring? No, never! flash her eyes with sudden light,  As she springs and grasps it firmly--\"Curfew shall not ring to-night!\"    Out she swung--far out; the city seemed a speck of light below,  There 'twixt heaven and earth suspended as the bell swung to and fro;  And the sexton at the bell-rope, old and deaf, heard not the bell,  Sadly thought, \"That twilight curfew rang young Basil's funeral knell.\"  Still the maiden clung more firmly, and with trembling lips so white,  Said, to hush her heart's wild throbbing: \"Curfew shall not ring to-night.\"    It was o'er; the bell ceased swaying, and the maiden stepped once more  Firmly on the dark old ladder where, for hundred years before  Human foot had not been planted. The brave deed that she had done  Should be told long ages after; as the rays of setting sun  Crimson all the sky with beauty, aged sires with heads of white,  Tell the eager, listening children, \"Curfew did not ring that night.\"    O'er the distant hills came Cromwell; Bessie sees him, and her brow,  Lately white with fear and anguish, has no anxious traces now.  At his feet she tells her story, shows her hands all bruised and torn;  And her face so sweet and pleading, yet with sorrow pale and worn,  Touched his heart with sudden pity, lit his eyes with misty light:  \"Go! your lover lives,\" said Cromwell, \"Curfew shall not ring to-night.\"    Wide they flung the massive portal; led the prisoner forth to die,--  All his bright young life before him. 'Neath the darkening English sky  Bessie comes with flying footsteps, eyes aglow with love-light sweet;  Kneeling on the turf beside him, lays his pardon at his feet.  In his brave, strong arms he clasped her, kissed the face upturned           and white,  Whispered, \"Darling, you have saved me--curfew will not ring to-night.\"        _Rose Hartwick Thorpe._          Kate Shelly      Have you heard how a girl saved the lightning express--    Of Kate Shelly, whose father was killed on the road?  Were he living to-day, he'd be proud to possess    Such a daughter as Kate. Ah! 'twas grit that she showed  On that terrible evening when Donahue's train  Jumped the bridge and went down, in the darkness and rain.    She was only eighteen, but a woman in size,    With a figure as graceful and lithe as a doe,  With peach-blossom cheeks, and with violet eyes,    And teeth and complexion like new-fallen snow;  With a nature unspoiled and unblemished by art--  With a generous soul, and a warm, noble heart!    'Tis evening--the darkness is dense and profound;    Men linger at home by their bright-blazing fires;  The wind wildly howls with a horrible sound,    And shrieks through the vibrating telegraph wires;  The fierce lightning flashes along the dark sky;  The rain falls in torrents; the river rolls by.    The scream of a whistle; the rush of a train!    The sound of a bell! a mysterious light  That flashes and flares through the fast falling rain!    A rumble! a roar! shrieks of human affright!  The falling of timbers! the space of a breath!  A splash in the river; then darkness and death!    Kate Shelly recoils at the terrible crash;    The sounds of destruction she happens to hear;  She springs to the window--she throws up the sash,    And listens and looks with a feeling of fear.  The tall tree-tops groan, and she hears the faint cry  Of a drowning man down in the river near by.    Her heart feebly flutters, her features grow wan,    And then through her soul in a moment there flies  A forethought that gives her the strength of a man--    She turns to her trembling old mother and cries:  \"I must save the express--'twill be here in an hour!\"  Then out through the door disappears in the shower.    She flies down the track through the pitiless rain;    She reaches the river--the water below  Whirls and seethes through the timbers. She shudders again;    \"The bridge! To Moingona, God help me to go!\"  Then closely about her she gathers her gown  And on the wet ties with a shiver sinks down.    Then carefully over the timbers she creeps    On her hands and knees, almost holding her breath.  The loud thunder peals and the wind wildly sweeps,    And struggles to hurry her downward to death;  But the thought of the train to destruction so near  Removes from her soul every feeling of fear.    With the blood dripping down from each torn, bleeding limb,    Slowly over the timbers her dark way she feels;  Her fingers grow numb and her head seems to swim;    Her strength is fast failing--she staggers! she reels!  She falls--Ah! the danger is over at last,  Her feet touch the earth, and the long bridge is passed!    In an instant new life seems to come to her form;    She springs to her feet and forgets her despair.  On, on to Moingona! she faces the storm,    She reaches the station--the keeper is there,  \"Save the lightning express! No--hang out the red light!  There's death on the bridge at the river to-night!\"    Out flashes the signal-light, rosy and red;    Then sounds the loud roar of the swift-coming train,  The hissing of steam, and there, brightly ahead,    The gleam of a headlight illumines the rain.  \"Down brakes!\" shrieks the whistle, defiant and shrill;  She heeds the red signal--she slackens, she's still!    Ah! noble Kate Shelly, your mission is done;    Your deed that dark night will not fade from our gaze;  An endless renown you have worthily won;    Let the nation be just, and accord you its praise,  Let your name, let your fame, and your courage declare    What a _woman_ can do, and a _woman_ can dare!        _Eugene J. Hall._          There's But One Pair of Stockings to Mend To-Night      An old wife sat by her bright fireside,    Swaying thoughtfully to and fro  In an easy chair, whose creaky craw    Told a tale of long ago;  While down by her side, on the kitchen floor,  Stood a basket of worsted balls--a score.    The good man dozed o'er the latest news    Till the light in his pipe went out;  And, unheeded, the kitten with cunning paws    Rolled and tangled the balls about;  Yet still sat the wife in the ancient chair,  Swaying to and fro in the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18910"],[0,"Diary of a Nursing Sister on the Western Front, 1914-1915 (#7)"],[1,"em!) There  we heard that ten of our No.-- Sisters were ordered to Nantes for duty  by the 4.28, so we hied back to the station to meet them and see them  off. They were all frightfully glad to be on the move at last, and we  had a great meeting. The rest are still bathing at La Baule and cursing  their luck.    While we were getting some coffee in the only _patisserie_ in the dirty  little town, seven burly officer boys of the Black Watch came in to buy  cakes for the train, they said, to-night. They were nearly all second  lieutenants, one captain, and were so excited at going up to the Front  they couldn't keep still. They asked us eagerly if we'd had many of \"our  regiment\" wounded, and how many casualties were there, and how was the  fighting going, and how long would the journey take. (The nearer you get  to the Front the longer it takes, as trains are always having to shunt  and go round loops to make room for supply trains.) They didn't seem to  have the dimmest idea what they're in for, bless them. They are on this  train in the next carriage.    The Padre told me he was the only one at St Nazaire for all the  hospitals and all the troops in camp (15,000 in one camp alone).    He had commandeered the Bishop of Khartoum to help him, and another  bishop, who both happen to be here.    We are now going to turn out the light, and hope for the best till they  come to look at the warrant or turn us out to change.    6 A.M.--At Sable at 4 A.M. we were turned out for two hours; a wee open  station. Mr ---- and our Civil Surgeon were most awfully decent to us:  turned a sleepy official out of a room for us, and at 5 came and dug us  out to have coffee and _brioches_ with them. Then we went for a sunrise  walk round the village, and were finally dragged into their carriage, as  they thought it was more comfortable than ours. Just passed a big French  ambulance train full from Compiegne.    At Le Mans the train broke up again, and everybody got out. We  motor-ambulanced up to the Hospital with the three night Sisters coming  off station duty. Matron wanted us to go to bed for the day; but we  asked to come on after lunch, as they were busy and we weren't  overtired. I'm realising to-night that I have been on the train four  nights out of six, and bed is bliss at this moment.    I was sent to No.-- Stationary at the Jesuits' College to take over the  officers at one o'clock.    One was an angelic gunner boy with a septic leg and an undaunted smile,  except when I dressed his leg and he said \"Oh, damn!\" The other bad one  was wounded in the shoulder. They kept me busy till Sister ---- came  back, and then I went to my beloved Cathedral (and vergered some  Highland Tommies round it, they had fits of awe and joy over it, and  grieved over \"Reems\"). It is awfully hard to make these sick officers  comfortable, with no sheets or pillow-cases, no air ring-cushions,  pricky shirts, thick cups without saucers, &c. One longs for the medical  comforts of ----    I hear to-night that Miss ----, the Principal Matron on the Lines of  Communication (on the War Establishment Staff) is here again, and may  have a new destination for some of us details.    The heading in 'Le Matin' to-night is:--         UNE LUTTE ACHARNEE DE LA SOMME A LA MEUSE LA BATAILLE REDOUBLE DE       VIOLENCE    If it redoubles _de violence_ much longer who will be left?      _Sunday, September 27th._--My luck is in this time. Miss ---- has just  sent for me to tell me I am for permanent duty on No.-- Ambulance Train  (equipped) which goes up to the Front, to the nearest point on the rail  to the fighting line. Did you ever know such luck? There are four of us,  one Army Sister and me and two juniors; we live altogether on the train.  The train will always be pushed up as near the Field Hospitals as the  line gets to, whether we drive the Germans back to Berlin or they drive  us into the sea. It is now going to Braisne, a little east of Soissons,  just S. of the Aisne, N.E. of Rheims. It is on its way up now, and we  are to join it with our baggage when it stops here on the way to St  Nazaire. We shall have two days and two nights with wounded, and two  days and two nights to rest on the return empty. The work itself will be  of the grimmest possible, as we shall have all the worst cases, being an  equipped Hospital in a train. It was worth waiting five weeks to get  this; every man or woman stuck at the Base has dreams of getting to the  Front, but only one in a hundred gets the dream fulfilled.    There is no doubt that \"the horrors of War\" have outdone themselves by  this modern perfection of machinery killing, and the numbers involved,  as they have never done before, and as it was known they would. The  details are often unprintable. They have eight cases of tetanus at No.--  Stationary, and five have died.    All the patients at No.-- have been inoculated against tetanus to-day.  They have it in the French Hospitals too.    Went to the Voluntary Evening Service for the troops at the theatre at  5. The Padres and a Union Jack and the Allies' Flags; and a piano on the  stage; officers and sisters in the stalls; and the rest packed tight  with men: they were very reverent, and nearly took the roof off in the  Hymns, Creed, and Lord's Prayer. Excellent sermon. We had the War  Intercessions and a good prayer I didn't know, ending with \"Strengthen  us in life, and comfort us in death.\" The men looked what they were,  British to the bone; no one could take them for any other nation a mile  off. Clean, straight, thin, sunburnt, clear-eyed, all at their Active  Service best, no pallid rolls of fat on their faces like the French. The  man who preached must have liked talking to them in that pin-dropped  silence and attention; he evidently knows his opportunities.      _Monday, September 28th._--There are hundreds of people in deep new  black in this town; what must it be in Berlin? The cemetery here is  getting full of French and British soldiers' graves. Those 1200 sailors  from the three cruisers had fine clean quick deaths compared to what  happens here.    We have got our baggage (kit-bags and holdalls) down to the station at  the Red Cross Anglaise, and are sitting in our quarters waiting for the  word to come that No.-- train is in. Met Miss ---- in her car in the  town, and she said that it was just possible that the train might go  down to Havre this journey, she wasn't dead sure it was doing this  route! If so we shall be nicely and completely sold, as I don't know how  we should ever join it. But I'm not going to believe in such bad luck as  that would be till it happens.      _Tuesday, September 29th._--We _were_ sold last night after all. Trailed  down to the station to await the train according to orders, and were  then told by the A.D.M.S. that it had gone to Havre this journey, and  couldn't be on this line till next week, and we could go to bed. So  after all the embraces of Mme. and Fanny and Isabel, I turned up at  10.30 to ask for a bed. \"Ma pauvre demoiselle,\" said fat F., hastening  to let me in.    This morning Miss ---- came down with us to the A.D.M.S.'s Office to  find out how we could join the train, and he said: \"Wait till it comes  in next week, and meanwhile go on duty at the Hospital.\" I don't mind  anything as long as we do eventually get on to the train, and we are to  do that, so one must possess one's soul in patience. I am back with the  sick officers at No.-- Stationary.    There are rumours to-night of bad news from the front, and that the  German Navy is emerging from Kiel.      _Wednesday, September 30th._--Have been doing the sick officers all day  (or rather wounded). They are quite nice, but the lack of equipment  makes twice the work. We are still having bright sunny days, but it is  getting cold, and I shall be glad of warmer clothes. The food at the  still filthy Inn in a dark outhouse through the back yard has improved a  little! My Madame (in my billet) gives me coffee and bread and butter  (of the best) at 7, and there is a ration tin of jam, and I have  acquired a pot of honey.    _On duty at_ 7.30 A.M.--At 12 or 1 we go to the Inn for _dejeuner_: meat  of some sort, one vegetable, bread, butter, and cheese, and pears. Tea  we provide ourselves when we can.    At 7 or 8 we go to the Inn and have _potage_ (which is warm water with a  few stray onions or carrots in it), and tough cold meat, and sometimes a  piece of pastry (for pudding), bread, butter, and cheese, and a very  small cup of coffee, and little, rather hard pears. I am very well on it  now since they changed the bread, though pretty tired.      _Thursday, October 1st._--The sky in Mid France on October 1st is of a  blue that outblues the bluest that June or any other month can do in  l'Angleterre. It is cold in the early mornings and evenings, dazzling  all day, and shining moon by night.    The H.A.C. are all over the town: they do orderly duty at Headquarters  and all the Offices; they seem to be gentlemen in Tommy's kit; fine big  lot they are. Taking it all round, the Regular British Army on Active  Service--from hoary, beribboned Generals, decorated Staff Officers of  all ranks, other officers, and N.C.O.'s down to the humblest Tommy--is  the politest and best-mannered thing I have ever met, with few  exceptions. Wherever you are, or go, or have to wait, they come and ask  if they can do anything for you, generally with an engaging smile seize  your hand-baggage, offer you chairs and see you through generally. And  the men and N.C.O.'s are just the same, and always awfully grateful if  you can help them out with the language in any way.    This was a conversation I heard in my ward to-day. Brother of Captain  ---- (wounded) visits the amputation man, and, by way of cheering him  up, sits down, gazes at his ugly bandaged stump on a pillow, and says--    \"That must be the devil.\"    \"Yes, it is,\" says the leg man.    \"Hell,\" says the other, and"]]]
