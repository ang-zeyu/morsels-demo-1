True; but I leave it to every one to make themselves  ridiculous.    MRS. SOLID. I am very glad that you have furnished me here with the  criticisms of which I stand in need; for I might otherwise have been in  danger of supplying you with an example at the next soiree, perhaps at  the banker's, Mr. Gold's. But, as I should like to hear your answer, I  will listen to, and report to you, what is said in a certain though not  very numerous clique, who are opposed to you and your labors.    DOMINIE. Those people would act more wisely, if they were to study my  writings; in which I will make any corrections, if there is any thing  that I can add to them, for the advantage of truth, right, and beauty.    And now allow me, Miss Emily, since you are pretty well advanced, and  are not quite spoiled, to show you in a few lessons how to study these  variations by Herz (Les Trois Graces, No. 1, on a theme from \"The  Pirates\"). They are not easy; but I will teach them in a way that shall  not weary you or give you a distaste for them. I have intentionally  chosen these variations, because they do not lay claim to great musical  interest; and, consequently, their mode of performance, their execution,  gives them their chief value. Moreover, they possess the disadvantage  for teaching that they are of unequal difficulty, and require,  therefore, the more skill on the part of the teacher to compensate for  this.    _First Lesson._ Miss Emily, these are very clear, graceful variations,  which require an extremely nice, delicate execution; and, especially, a  complete mechanical mastery of their various difficulties. Although  these variations may seem to you too easy, I am governed in the  selection of them by the maxim that \"what one would learn to play finely  must be below the mechanical powers of the pupil.\" The theme of the  Italian song, which is the basis of these variations, is very well  chosen, and you must take great pains to execute it as finely as  possible, and to produce a singing effect upon the piano-forte. After  the piece is thoroughly learned, you will be greatly aided in the  production of this imitation of singing by the careful and correct use  of the pedal which raises the dampers. The theme does not offer great  mechanical difficulties; but it requires a loose, broad, full, and yet  tender touch, a good _portamento_, and a clear and delicately shaded  delivery; for you must remember that \"in the performance of a simple  theme the well-taught pupil may be recognized.\"    EMILY. But you do not begin at the beginning: there is an introduction  to the piece.    DOMINIE. Perhaps we shall take that at the last: I can't tell yet when.  A great many things in my instruction will seem to you misplaced: it may  be that the final result will restore to me the approval which I desire.    EMILY. Do you always give such a preliminary description before you  begin a piece with a pupil?    DOMINIE. I like to do so; for I wish to create an interest in the piece,  and to state in connection my principles and views about music and  piano-playing. Now we will try the theme, first quite slowly; and then  the first easy variation, with the last bars at the end of it, which  introduce the theme once more, and which should be played very clearly  and smoothly. We will then take from the introduction only the right  hand, and study the most appropriate fingering for it. I never write  this out fully; but only intimate it here and there, in order not to  interfere with the spontaneous activity of the learner. We will also  take a few portions for the left hand from the finale. In these you must  carefully observe the directions which are given for its performance,  and try to execute every thing correctly and clearly; for a careless  bass is prejudicial to the very best playing in the treble.    My lesson is now at an end; for we have taken up a good deal of time at  the beginning with the scales, and passing the thumb under correctly,  with the different species of touch, and the appropriate exercises for  these. I do not wish you yet to practise the first variation with both  hands together, for you do not yet strike the skipping bass evenly  enough and with sufficient precision; and you might accustom yourself to  inaccuracies, especially as your left hand has, as usual, been  neglected, and is inferior to the right in lightness and rapidity. We  shall find this a hindrance; for the object is not to practise much, but  to practise correctly. Therefore play these passages first slowly, then  quicker, at last very fast; then slow again, sometimes _staccato_,  sometimes _legato_, _piano_, and also moderately loud; but never when  the hands and fingers are fatigued, therefore not too continuously; but  many times in the course of the day, and always with fresh energy. At  present, you need not play _fortissimo_, or with the pedal: for in that  way you might be led into a tramping style, with a weak, stiff touch,  and a habit of striking at the keys with straight fingers; and that I do  not like. We will look for the true and the beautiful in a very  different treatment of the piano; and, first of all, in a clear,  unaffected, healthy performance, free from any forced character.    _Second Lesson._ Transposition of the triads and dominant chord in their  three positions, and in various kinds of measure; and practice of these,  with careful attention to a correct touch and loose wrist; cadences on  the dominant and sub-dominant; practice of the skipping bass in the  theme, and in the first and third variations, with practice in striking  and leaving the chords, observing carefully the precise value of the  notes. You must attend also to striking them not too forcibly or too  feebly, and take special care with regard to the fourth and fifth  fingers, which do not easily give the tone with so full a sound as the  other three fingers. Now we will try the theme with both hands together,  and consider the correct expression, and likewise the _piano_ and  _forte_, as well as the nicest _crescendo_ and _diminuendo_. We will  then take the first easy variation, of which you have already acquired a  mastery: we will play it exactly _a tempo_ and with the bass chords,  which should usually be given _staccato_, and which must be played with  delicacy and flexibility; but it will be well for you to practise first  the bass part once alone, in order that you may hear whether all the  tones sound evenly. Now the first variation will go pretty well with  both hands together; with increasing mastery of it, the requisite  shading in the right hand can be produced. As your right hand is not yet  tired, play to me now several times, first slowly and then faster, the  passages which I gave you from the introduction. When the right hand  becomes a little fatigued, take a portion from the finale for the left  hand. You may also try over the adagio; but I recommend for your special  practice the part for the right hand in the third variation. You cannot  make a mistake about it, if you do not try to play it too fast, and if  you carefully observe the fingering indicated. Now I will play the theme  to you, as nearly as possible as I heard the famous tenor Rubini sing  it. You see I place the fingers gently upon the keys and avoid raising  them too high, in order not to injure the nice connection of the tones,  and to produce a singing tone as far as possible. At the end of the  lesson you will play the theme to me once more.... I perceive you play  it with too much embarrassment, and not freely enough. It will go still  better two days hence, if you play it frequently during that time,  slowly, and become quite accustomed to it. In addition, you will  practise industriously every thing which we have gone through,  especially the first variation; but you must always do it with interest,  and never with weariness. Of course you will practise _without notes_  all the little exercises for the touch, and for the fourth and fifth  fingers, and the cadences.    _Third Lesson._ Other little exercises; trills, scales with shading for  one hand alone and for both together; the skipping basses, &c. We will  begin to-day with the bass part of the second variation. You observe  that often there are even eighth notes in the treble, while in the bass  there are even triplet eighth notes. In order to play these properly  together, even with only mechanical correctness, it is necessary that  the left hand shall acquire a perfectly free and independent movement,  and shall bring out the bass with perfect ease. You must pay special  attention to any weak notes, and accustom yourself not to give the last  triplet, in each bar, and the last note of this triplet, too hurriedly,  too sharply, or with too little tone. Notice how much difficulty this  equal playing of the triplets occasions to the right hand, which moves  in even eighth notes. While you play the left hand, I will play the  right: you must listen as little as possible to my playing, and preserve  your own independence. You must learn to play this variation entirely by  yourself with both hands together; but we must not be too much in a  hurry about it, and must give time to it. All restless urging, all  hurry, leads to inaccuracies in playing. You have learned enough for  to-day; but you may play the other variations, with the whole finale,  straight through, that you may not get into the habit of stopping at the  difficult passages which you have already learned.    _Fourth Lesson._ New exercises for striking stretches, and for the  extension of the hand and fingers; but this must be done prudently,  that the sound touch, which is always of the first importance, shall not  be endangered. Besides this, the repetition of the exercises learned in  the preceding lessons; but all to be played with a certain shading and  delicacy.

CHAPTER VII.    THE ROMAN GOVERNMENT.      So far as true history can guess, the Romans really did have kings and  drove them out, but there are signs that, though Porsena was a real  king, the war was not so honorable to the Romans as they said, for he  took the city and made them give up all their weapons to him, leaving  them nothing but their tools for husbandry. But they liked to forget  their misfortunes.    The older Roman families were called patricians, or fathers, and thought  all rights to govern belonged to them. Settlers who came in later were  called plebeians, or the people, and at first had no rights at all, for  all the land belonged to the patricians, and the only way for the  plebeians to get anything done for them was to become hangers-on--or, as  they called it, clients--of some patrician who took care of their  interests. There was a council of patricians called the Senate, chosen  among themselves, and also containing by right all who had been chief  magistrates. The whole assembly of the patricians was called the  Comitia. They, as has been said before, fought on horseback, while the  plebeians fought on foot; but out of the rich plebeians a body was  formed called the knights, who also used horses, and wore gold rings  like the patricians.    [Illustration: HEAD OF JUPITER.]    But the plebeians were always trying not to be left out of everything.  By and by, they said under Servius Tullius, the city was divided into  six quarters, and all the families living in them into six tribes, each  of which had a tribune to watch over it, bring up the number of its men,  and lead them to battle. Another division of the citizens, both  patrician and plebeian, was made every five years. They were all counted  and numbered and divided off into centuries according to their wealth.  Then these centuries, or hundreds, had votes, by the persons they chose,  when it was a question of peace or war. Their meeting was called the  Comitia; but as there were more patrician centuries than plebeian ones,  the patricians still had much more power. Besides, the Senate and all  the magistrates were in those days always patricians. These magistrates  were chosen every year. There were two consuls, who were like kings for  the time, only that they wore no crowns; they had purple robes, and sat  in chairs ornamented with ivory, and they were always attended by  lictors, who carried bundles of rods tied round an axe--the first for  scourging, the second for beheading. There were under them two praetors,  or judges, who tried offences; two quaestors, who attended to the public  buildings; and two censors, who had to look after the numbering and  registering of the people in their tribes and centuries. The consuls in  general commanded the army, but sometimes, when there was a great need,  one single leader was chosen and was called dictator. Sometimes a  dictator was chosen merely to fulfil an omen, by driving a nail into the  head of the great statue of Jupiter in the Capitol. Besides these, all  the priests had to be patricians; the chief of all was called Pontifex  Maximus. Some say this was because he was the _fax_ (maker) of  _pontes_ (bridges), as he blessed them and decided by omens where  they should be; but others think the word was Pompifex, and that he was  the maker of pomps or ceremonies. There were many priests as well as  augurs, who had to draw omens from the flight of birds or the appearance  of sacrifices, and who kept the account of the calendar of lucky and  unlucky days, and of festivals.    [Illustration: FEMALE COSTUMES.]    The Romans were a grave religious people in those days, and did not  count their lives or their affections dear in comparison with their  duties to their altars and their hearths, though their notions of duty  do not always agree with ours. Their dress in the city was a white  woollen garment edged with purple--it must have been more like in shape  to a Scottish plaid than anything else--and was wrapped round so as to  leave one arm free: sometimes a fold was drawn over the head. No one  might wear it but a free-born Roman, and he never went out on public  business without it, even when more convenient fashions had been copied  from Greece. Those who were asking votes for a public office wore it  white (_candidus_), and therefore were called candidates. The consuls  had it on great days entirely purple and embroidered, and all senators  and ex-magistrates had broader borders of purple. The ladies wore a long  graceful wrapping-gown; the boys a short tunic, and round their necks  was hung a hollow golden ball called a _bulla_, or bubble. When a boy  was seventeen, there was a great family sacrifice to the Lares and the  forefathers, his bulla was taken off, the toga was put on, and he was  enrolled by his own praenomen, Caius or Lucius, or whatever it might be,  for there was only a choice of fifteen. After this he was liable to be  called out to fight. A certain number of men were chosen from each tribe  by the tribune. It was divided into centuries, each led by a centurion;  and the whole body together was called a legion, from _lego_, to  choose. In later times the proper number for a legion was 6000 men. Each  legion had a standard, a bar across the top of the spear, with the  letters on it S P Q R--_Senatus, Populus Que Romanus_--meaning the Roman  Senate and People, a purple flag below and a figure above, such as an  eagle, or the wolf and twins, or some emblem dear to the Romans. The  legions were on foot, but the troops of patricians and knights on  horseback were attached to them and had to protect them.    [Illustration: FEMALE COSTUMES.]    The Romans had in those days very small riches, they held in general  small farms in the country, which they worked themselves with the help  of their sons and slaves. The plebeians were often the richest. They too  held farms leased to them by the state, and had often small shops in  Rome. The whole territory was so small that it was easy to come into  Rome to worship, attend the Senate, or vote, and many had no houses in  the city. Each man was married with a ring and sacrifice, and the lady  was then carried over the threshold, on which a sheepskin was spread,  and made mistress of the house by being bidden to be Caia to Caius. The  Roman matrons were good and noble women in those days, and the highest  praise of them was held to be _Domum mansit, lanam fecit_--she stayed  at home and spun wool. Each man was absolute master in his own house,  and had full power over his grown-up sons, even for life or death, and  they almost always submitted entirely. For what made the Romans so great  was that they were not only brave, but they were perfectly obedient, and  obeyed as perfectly as they could their fathers, their officers, their  magistrates, and, as they thought, their gods.    [Illustration]          CHAPTER VIII.    MENENIUS AGRIPPA'S FABLE.    B.C. 494.      A great deal of the history of Rome consists of struggles between the  patricians and plebeians. In those early days the plebeians were often  poor, and when they wanted to improve their lands they had to borrow  money from the patricians, who not only had larger lands, but, as they  were the officers in war, got a larger share of the spoil. The Roman law  was hard on a man in debt. His lands might be seized, he might be thrown  into prison or sold into slavery with his wife and children, or, if the  creditors liked, be cut to pieces so that each might take his share.    One of these debtors, a man who was famous for bravery as a centurion,  broke out of his prison and ran into the Forum, all in rags and with  chains still hanging to his hands and feet, showing them to his  fellow-citizens, and asking if this was just usage of a man who had done  no crime. They were very angry, and the more because one of the consuls,  Appius Claudius, was known to be very harsh, proud and cruel, as indeed  were all his family. The Volscians, a tribe often at war with them,  broke into their land at the same time, and the Romans were called to  arms, but the plebeians refused to march until their wrongs were  redressed. On this the other consul, Servilius, promised that a law  should be made against keeping citizens in prison for debt or making  slaves of their children; and thereupon the army assembled, marched  against the enemy, and defeated them, giving up all the spoil to his  troops. But the senate, when the danger was over, would not keep its  promises, and even appointed a Dictator to put the plebeians down.  Thereupon they assembled outside the walls in a strong force, and were  going to attack the patricians, when the wise old Menenius Agrippa was  sent out to try to pacify them. He told them a fable, namely, that once  upon a time all the limbs of a man's body became disgusted with the  service they had to render to the belly. The feet and legs carried it  about, the hands worked for it and carried food to it, the mouth ate  for it, and so on. They thought it hard thus all to toil for it, and  agreed to do nothing for it--neither to carry it about, clothe it, nor  feed it. But soon all found themselves growing weak and starved, and  were obliged to own that all would perish together unless they went on  waiting on this seemingly useless belly. So Agrippa told them that all  ranks and states depended on one another, and unless all worked together  all must be confusion and go to decay. The fable seems to have convinced  both rich and poor; the debtors were set free and the debts forgiven.  And though the laws about debts do not seem to have been changed,  another law was made which gave the plebeians tribunes in peace as well  as war. These tribunes were always to be plebeians, chosen by their own  fellows. No one was allowed to hurt them during their year of office, on  "]]]
