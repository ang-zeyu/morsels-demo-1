Only just a little while, then  you can come home to lunch--you and Antony.\" Her eyes sparkled now.  \"Oh, do say yes!\"    Knowing what he did know of the man upstairs, he longed to accompany  her; yet, contradictorily, knowing what he did he could not face him  again, could not submit himself to the test of being civil to Antony  Ferrara in the presence of Myra Duquesne.    \"Please don't tempt me,\" he begged, and forced a smile. \"I shall find  myself enrolled amongst the seekers of soup-tickets if I _completely_  ignore the claims of my employer upon my time!\"    \"Oh, what a shame!\" she cried.    Their eyes met, and something--something unspoken but cogent--passed  between them; so that for the first time a pretty colour tinted the  girl's cheeks. She suddenly grew embarrassed.    \"Good-bye, then,\" she said, holding out her hand. \"Will you lunch with  us to-morrow?\"    \"Thanks awfully,\" replied Cairn. \"Rather--if it's humanly possible.  I'll ring you up.\"    He released her hand, and stood watching her as she entered the lift.  When it ascended, he turned and went out to swell the human tide of  Piccadilly. He wondered what his father would think of the girl's  visiting Ferrara. Would he approve? Decidedly the situation was a  delicate one; the wrong kind of interference--the tactless kind--might  merely render it worse. It would be awfully difficult, if not  impossible, to explain to Myra. If an open rupture were to be avoided  (and he had profound faith in his father's acumen), then Myra must  remain in ignorance. But was she to be allowed to continue these  visits?    Should he have permitted her to enter Ferrara's rooms?    He reflected that he had no right to question her movements. But, at  least, he might have accompanied her.    \"Oh, heavens!\" he muttered--\"what a horrible tangle. It will drive me  mad!\"    There could be no peace for him until he knew her to be safely home  again, and his work suffered accordingly; until, at about midday, he  rang up Myra Duquesne, on the pretence of accepting her invitation to  lunch on the morrow, and heard, with inexpressible relief, her voice  replying to him.    In the afternoon he was suddenly called upon to do a big \"royal\"  matinee, and this necessitated a run to his chambers in order to  change from Harris tweed into vicuna and cashmere. The usual stream of  lawyers' clerks and others poured under the archway leading to the  court; but in the far corner shaded by the tall plane tree, where the  ascending steps and worn iron railing, the small panes of glass in the  solicitor's window on the ground floor and the general air of  Dickens-like aloofness prevailed, one entered a sort of backwater. In  the narrow hall-way, quiet reigned--a quiet profound as though motor  'buses were not.    Cairn ran up the stairs to the second landing, and began to fumble for  his key. Although he knew it to be impossible, he was aware of a queer  impression that someone was waiting for him, inside his chambers. The  sufficiently palpable fact--that such a thing _was_ impossible--did  not really strike him until he had opened the door and entered. Up to  that time, in a sort of subconscious way, he had anticipated finding a  visitor there.    \"What an ass I am!\" he muttered; then, \"Phew! there's a disgusting  smell!\"    He threw open all the windows, and entering his bedroom, also opening  both the windows there. The current of air thus established began to  disperse the odour--a fusty one as of something decaying--and by the  time that he had changed, it was scarcely perceptible. He had little  time to waste in speculation, but when, as he ran out to the door,  glancing at his watch, the nauseous odour suddenly rose again to his  nostrils, he stopped with his hand on the latch.    \"What the deuce is it!\" he said loudly.    Quite mechanically he turned and looked back. As one might have  anticipated, there was nothing visible to account for the odour.    The emotion of fear is a strange and complex one. In this breath of  decay rising to his nostril, Cairn found something fearsome. He opened  the door, stepped out on to the landing, and closed the door behind  him.    At an hour close upon midnight, Dr. Bruce Cairn, who was about to  retire, received a wholly unexpected visit from his son. Robert Cairn  followed his father into the library and sat down in the big, red  leathern easy-chair. The doctor tilted the lamp shade, directing the  light upon Robert's face. It proved to be slightly pale, and in the  clear eyes was an odd expression--almost a hunted look.    \"What's the trouble, Rob? Have a whisky and soda.\"    Robert Cairn helped himself quietly.    \"Now take a cigar and tell me what has frightened you.\"    \"Frightened me!\" He started, and paused in the act of reaching for a  match. \"Yes--you're right, sir. I _am_ frightened!\"    \"Not at the moment. You have been.\"    \"Right again.\" He lighted his cigar. \"I want to begin by saying  that--well, how can I put it? When I took up newspaper work, we  thought it would be better if I lived in chambers--\"    \"Certainly.\"    \"Well, at that time--\" he examined the lighted end of his  cigar--\"there was no reason--why I should not live alone. But now--\"    \"Well?\"    \"Now I feel, sir, that I have need of more or less constant  companionship. Especially I feel that it would be desirable to have a  friend handy at--er--at night time!\"    Dr. Cairn leant forward in his chair. His face was very stern.    \"Hold out your fingers,\" he said, \"extended; left hand.\"    His son obeyed, smiling slightly. The open hand showed in the  lamplight steady as a carven hand.    \"Nerves quite in order, sir.\"    Dr. Cairn inhaled a deep breath.    \"Tell me,\" he said.    \"It's a queer tale,\" his son began, \"and if I told it to Craig Fenton,  or Madderley round in Harley Street I know what they would say. But  you will _understand_. It started this afternoon, when the sun was  pouring in through the windows. I had to go to my chambers to change;  and the rooms were filled with a most disgusting smell.\"    His father started.    \"What kind of smell?\" he asked. \"Not--incense?\"    \"No,\" replied Robert, looking hard at him--\"I thought you would ask  that. It was a smell of something putrid--something rotten, rotten  with the rottenness of ages.\"    \"Did you trace where it came from?\"    \"I opened all the windows, and that seemed to disperse it for a time.  Then, just as I was going out, it returned; it seemed to envelop me  like a filthy miasma. You know, sir, it's hard to explain just the way  I felt about it--but it all amounts to this: I was glad to get  outside!\"    Dr. Cairn stood up and began to pace about the room, his hands locked  behind him.    \"To-night,\" he rapped suddenly, \"what occurred to-night?\"    \"To-night,\" continued his son, \"I got in at about half-past nine. I  had had such a rush, in one way and another, that the incident had  quite lost its hold on my imagination; I hadn't forgotten it, of  course, but I was not thinking of it when I unlocked the door. In fact  I didn't begin to think of it again until, in slippers and  dressing-gown, I had settled down for a comfortable read. There was  nothing, absolutely nothing, to influence my imagination--in that way.  The book was an old favourite, Mark Twain's _Up the Mississippi_, and  I sat in the armchair with a large bottle of lager beer at my elbow  and my pipe going strong.\"    Becoming restless in turn, the speaker stood up and walking to the  fireplace flicked off the long cone of grey ash from his cigar. He  leant one elbow upon the mantel-piece, resuming his story:    \"St. Paul's had just chimed the half-hour--half-past ten--when my pipe  went out. Before I had time to re-light it, came the damnable smell  again. At the moment nothing was farther from my mind, and I jumped up  with an exclamation of disgust. It seemed to be growing stronger and  stronger. I got my pipe alight quickly. Still I could smell it; the  aroma of the tobacco did not lessen its beastly pungency in the  smallest degree.    \"I tilted the shade of my reading-lamp and looked all about. There was  nothing unusual to be seen. Both windows were open and I went to one  and thrust my head out, in order to learn if the odour came from  outside. It did not. The air outside the window was fresh and clean.  Then I remembered that when I had left my chambers in the afternoon,  the smell had been stronger near the door than anywhere. I ran out to  the door. In the passage I could smell nothing; but--\"    He paused, glancing at his father.    \"Before I had stood there thirty seconds it was rising all about me  like the fumes from a crater. By God, sir! I realised then that it was  something ... following me!\"    Dr. Cairn stood watching him, from the shadows beyond the big table,  as he came forward and finished his whisky at a gulp.    \"That seemed to work a change in me,\" he continued rapidly; \"I  recognised there was something behind this disgusting manifestation,  something directing it; and I recognised, too, that the next move was  up to me. I went back to my room. The odour was not so pronounced, but  as I stood by the table, waiting, it increased, and increased, until  it almost choked me. My nerves were playing tricks, but I kept a fast  hold on myself. I set to work, very methodically, and fumigated the  place. Within myself I knew that it could do no good, but I felt that  I had to put up some kind of opposition. You understand, sir?\"    \"Quite,\" replied Dr. Cairn quietly. \"It was an organised attempt to  expel the invader, and though of itself it was useless,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19713"],[0,"The Laughing Prince: Jugoslav Folk and Fairy Tales (#7)"],[1,"all the Princess could say was, \"Oh!\"    He came slowly towards her and knelt before her.    \"Dear Princess,\" he said, \"do not be frightened. If it had not been for  your sweet words yesterday when you said you loved me I should never  have been able to leave this feather shirt. Do not turn from me now  because I am a man and not a pigeon. Love me still if you can, for I  love you. It was because I fell in love with you yesterday when I saw  you working at your embroidery that I flew in by the open window and let  you caress me.\"    For a long time the Princess could only stare at the kneeling youth, too  amazed to speak. He was so handsome that she forgot all about the pigeon  he used to be, she forgot her embroidery, she forgot everything. She  hadn't supposed that any young man in the whole world could be so  handsome! Why, just looking at him, she could be happy forever and ever  and ever!    \"Would you rather I were still a pigeon?\" the young man asked.    \"No! No! No!\" the Princess cried. \"I like you ever so much better this  way!\"    The young man gravely bowed his head and kissed her hand and the  Princess blushed and trembled and wished he would do it again. She had  never imagined that any kiss could be so wonderful!    They passed the afternoon together and it seemed to the Princess it was  the happiest afternoon of all her life. As the sun was sinking the youth  said:    \"Now I must leave you and become a pigeon again.\"    \"But you'll come back, won't you?\" the Princess begged.    \"Yes, I'll come back to-morrow but on one condition: that you don't tell  any one about me. I'll come back every day at the same hour but if ever  you tell about me then I won't be able to come back any more.\"    \"I'll never tell!\" the Princess promised.    Then the youth kissed her tenderly, dipped himself in the milk, went  back into his feather shirt, and flew off as a pigeon.    The next day he came again and the next and the next and the Princess  fell so madly in love with him that all day long and all night long,  too, she thought of nothing else. She no longer touched her embroidery  but day after day sat idle in the tower-room just awaiting the hour of  his arrival. And every day it seemed to the King and the Queen and all  the people about the Court that the Princess was becoming more and more  beautiful. Her cheeks kept growing pinker, her eyes brighter, her lovely  hair more golden.    \"I must say sitting at that foolish embroidery agrees with her,\" the  King said.    \"No, it isn't that,\" the Queen told him. \"It's the big bowl of milk she  drinks every afternoon. You know milk is very good for the complexion.\"    \"Milk indeed!\" murmured the Princess to herself, and she blushed rosier  than ever at thought of her wonderful secret.    But a princess can't keep growing more and more beautiful without  everybody in the world hearing about it. The neighboring kings soon  began to feel angry and suspicious.    \"What ails this Princess?\" they asked among themselves. \"Isn't one of  our sons good enough for her? Is she waiting for the King of Persia to  come as a suitor or what? Let us stand together on our rights and demand  to know why she won't consider one of our sons!\"    So they sent envoys to the Princess's father and he saw at once that the  matter had become serious.    \"My dear,\" he said to the Princess, \"your mother and I have humored you  long enough. It is high time that you had a husband and I insist that  you allow the sons of neighboring kings to be presented to you next  week.\"    \"I won't do it!\" the Princess declared. \"I'm not interested in the sons  of the neighboring kings and that's all there is about it!\"    Her father looked at her severely.    \"Is that the way for a princess to talk? Persist in this foolishness and  you may embroil your country in war!\"    \"I don't care!\" the Princess cried, bursting into tears. \"I can't marry  any of them, so why let them be presented?\"    \"Why can't you marry any of them?\"    \"I just can't!\" the Princess insisted.    At first, in spite of the pleadings of both parents, she would tell them  no more, but her mother kept questioning her until at last in  self-defense the Princess confessed that she had a true love who came to  her in the tower every afternoon in the form of a pigeon.    \"He's a prince,\" she told them, \"the son of a distant king. At present  he is under an enchantment that turns him into a pigeon. When the  enchantment is broken he is coming as a prince to marry me.\"    \"My poor child!\" the Queen cried. \"Think no more about this Pigeon  Prince! The enchantment may last a hundred years and then where will you  be!\"    \"But he is my love!\" the Princess declared, \"and if I can't have him I  won't have any one!\"    When the King found that nothing they could say would move her from this  resolution, he sighed and murmured:    \"Very well, my dear. If it must be so, it must be. This afternoon when  your lover comes, bring him down to me that I may talk to him.\"    But that afternoon the Pigeon did not come. Nor the next afternoon  either, nor the next, and then too late the Princess remembered his  warning that if she told about him he could never come back.    So now she sat in the tower-room idle and heartbroken, reproaching  herself that she had betrayed her lover and praying God to forgive her  and send him back to her. And the roses faded from her cheeks and her  eyes grew dull and the people about the Court began wondering why they  had ever thought her the most beautiful princess in the world.    At last she went to the King, her father, and said:    \"As my love can no longer come back to me because I forgot my promise  and betrayed him, I must go out into the world and hunt him. Unless I  find him life will not be worth the living. So do not oppose me,  father, but help me. Have three pairs of iron shoes made for me and  three iron staffs. I will wander over the wide world until these are  worn out and then, if by that time I have not found him, I will come  home to you.\"    So the King had three pairs of iron shoes made for the Princess and  three iron staffs and she set forth on her quest. She traveled through  towns and cities and many kingdoms, over rough mountains and desert  places, looking everywhere for her enchanted love. But nowhere could she  find any trace of him.    At the end of the first year she had worn out the first pair of iron  shoes and the first iron staff. At the end of the second year she had  worn out the second pair of iron shoes and the second iron staff. At the  end of the third year, when she had worn out the third pair of iron  shoes and the third staff, she returned to her father's palace looking  thin and worn and sad.    \"My poor child,\" the King said, \"I hope now you realize that the Pigeon  Prince is gone forever. Think no more about him. Go back to your  embroidery and when the roses begin blooming in your cheeks again we'll  find some young prince for you who isn't enchanted.\"    But the Princess shook her head.    \"Let me try one thing more, father,\" she begged, \"and then if I don't  find my love I'll do as you say.\"    The King agreed to this.    \"Well, then,\" the Princess said, \"build a public bath-house and have the  heralds proclaim that the King's daughter will sit at the entrance and  will allow any one to bathe free of charge who will tell her the story  of the strangest thing he has ever heard or seen.\"    So the King built the bath-house and sent out his heralds far and wide.  Men and women from all over the world came and bathed and told the  Princess stories of this marvel and that, but never, alas, a word of an  enchanted pigeon.    The days went by and the Princess grew more and more discouraged.    \"Isn't it sad,\" the courtiers began whispering, \"how the Princess has  lost her looks! Do you suppose she ever was really beautiful or did we  just imagine it?\"    And the neighboring kings when they heard this remarked softly among  themselves:    \"It's just as well we didn't hurry one of our sons into a marriage with  this young woman!\"    [Illustration: _The Princess Kissed Its Coral Beak_]    Now there was a poor widow who lived near the bath-house. She had a  daughter, a pretty young girl, who used to sit at the window and watch  the Princess as people came and told her their stories.    \"Mother,\" the girl said one day, \"every one in the world goes to the  bath-house and I want to go, too!\"    \"Nonsense!\" the mother said. \"What story could you tell the Princess?\"    \"But everybody else goes and I don't see why I can't!\"    \"Well, my dear,\" the mother promised, \"you may just as soon as you see  or hear something strange. Talk no more about it now but go, fetch me a  pitcher of water from the town well.\"    The girl obediently took an empty pitcher and went to the town well.  Just as she had filled the pitcher she heard some one say:    \"Mercy me, I fear I'll be late!\"    She turned around and what do you think she saw? A rooster in wooden  shoes with a basket under his wing!    \"I fear I'll be late! I fear I'll be late!\" the rooster kept repeating  as he hurried off making a funny little clatter with his wooden shoes.    \"How strange!\" the girl thought to herself. \"A rooster with wooden  shoes! I'm sure the Princess would love to hear about him! I'll follow  him and see what he does.\"    He went to a garden where he filled his basket with fresh  vegetables--with onions and beans and garlic. Then he hurried home to a  little house. The girl slipped in after him and hid behind the door.    \"Thank goodness, I'm on time!\" the rooster murmured.    He put a big bowl on the table and filled it with milk.    \"There!\" he said. \"Now I'm ready for them!\"    Presently twelve beautiful pigeons came flying in by the open door.  Eleven of them dipped in the bowl of milk, their feather shirts opened,  and out they stepped eleven handsome youths. But the Twelfth Pigeon  perched disconsolately on the"]]]
