But I must also plead indebtedness to many other naturalists who have  left their records in the 'Journals of the Asiatic Society' and other  publications, or who have brought out books of their own, such as  Blyth, Elliott, Hodgson, Sherwill, Sykes, Tickell, Hutton, Kellaart,  Emerson Tennent, and others; Col. McMaster's 'Notes on Jerdon,' Dr.  Anderson's 'Anatomical and Zoological Researches,' Horsfield's  'Catalogue of the Mammalia in the Museum of the East India Company,'  Dr. Dobson's 'Monograph of the Asiatic Chiroptera,' the writings of  Professors Martin Duncan, Flowers, Kitchen Parker, Boyd Dawkins,  Garrod, Mr. E. R. Alston, Sir Victor Brooke and others; the  Proceedings and Journals of the Zoological, Linnean, and Asiatic  Societies, and the correspondence in _The Asian_; so that after all  my own share is minimised to a few remarks here and there, based on  personal experience during a long period of jungle life, and on  observation of the habits of animals in their wild state, and also  in captivity, having made a large collection of living specimens from  time to time.    As regards classification, Cuvier's system is the most popular, so  I shall adopt it to a certain extent, keeping it as a basis, but  engrafting on it such modifications as have met with the approval  of modern naturalists. For comparison I give below a synopsis of  Cuvier's arrangement. I have placed Cetacea after Carnivora, and  Edentata at the end. In this I have followed recent authors as well  as Jerdon, whose running numbers I have preserved as far as possible  for purposes of reference.    Cuvier divides the Mammals into nine orders, as follows. (_The  examples I give are Indian ones, except where stated otherwise_):--    _Order I_.--BIMANA. Man.    _Order II_.--QUADRUMANA. Two families--1st, Apes and Monkeys; 2nd,  Lemurs.    _Order III_.--CARNARIA. Three families--1st, _Cheiroptera_, Bats;  2nd, _Insectivora_, Hedgehogs, Shrews, Moles, Tupaiae, &c.; 3rd,  _Carnivora_: Tribe 1, _Plantigrades_, Bears, Ailurus, Badger,  Arctonyx; 2, _Digitigrades_, Martens, Weasels, Otters, Cats,  Hyaenas, Civets, Musangs, Mongoose, Dogs, Wolves and Foxes.    _Order IV_.--MARSUPIATA. Implacental Mammals peculiar to America  and Australia, such as Opossums, Dasyures, Wombats, and Kangaroos.  We have none in India.    _Order V_.--RODENTIA. Squirrels, Marmots, Jerboas, Mole-Rats, Rats,  Mice, Voles, Porcupines, and Hares.    _Order VI_.--EDENTATA, or toothless Mammals, either partially or  totally without teeth. Three families--1st, _Tardigrades_, the  Sloths, peculiar to America; 2nd, _Effodientia_, or Burrowers, of  which the Indian type is the Manis, but which includes in other parts  of the world the Armadillos and Anteaters; 3rd, _Monotremata_, Spiny  Anteaters or Echidnas, and the Ornithorynchus.    _Order VII_.--PACHYDERMATA, or thick-skinned Mammals. Three  families--1st, _Proboscidians_, Elephants; 2nd, _Ordinary  Pachyderms_, Rhinoceroses, Hogs; 3rd, _Solidungula_, Horses.    _Order VIII_.--RUMINANTIA, or cud-chewing Mammals. Four  families--1st, _Hornless Ruminants_, Camels, Musks; 2nd, _Cervidae_,  true horns shed periodically, Deer; 3rd, _Persistent horns_,  Giraffes; 4th, _Hollow-horned Ruminants_, Antelopes, Goats, Sheep  and Oxen.    _Order IX._--CETACEA. Three families--1st, _Herbivorous Cetacea_,  Manatees, Dugongs; 2nd, _Ordinary Cetacea_, Porpoises; 3rd,  _Balaenidae_, Whales.          ORDER BIMANA.      Some people have an extreme repugnance to the idea that man should  be treated of in connection with other animals. The development  theory is shocking to them, and they would deny that man has anything  in common with the brute creation. This is of course mere sentiment;  no history of nature would be complete without the noblest work of  the Creator. The great gulf that separates the human species from  the rest of the animals is the impassable one of intellect.  Physically, he should be compared with the other mammals, otherwise  we should lose our first standpoint of comparison. There is no  degradation in this, nor is it an acceptance of the development  theory. To argue that man evolved from the monkey is an ingenious  joke which will not bear the test of examination, and the Scriptural  account may still be accepted. I firmly believe in man as an original  creation just as much as I disbelieve in any development of the Flying  Lemur (_Galeopithecus_) from the Bat, or that the habits of an animal  would in time materially alter its anatomy, as in the case of the  abnormal length of the hind toe and nail of the Jacana. It is not  that the habit of running over floating leaves induced the change,  but that an all-wise Creator so fashioned it that it might run on  those leaves in search of its food. I accept the development theory  to the extent of the multiplication of species, or perhaps, more  correctly, varieties in genera. We see in the human race how  circumstances affect physical appearance. The child of the ploughman  or navvy inherits the broad shoulders and thick-set frame of his  father; and in India you may see it still more forcibly in the  difference between Hindu and Mahomedan races, and those Hindus who  have been converted to Mahomedanism. I do not mean isolated converts  here and there who intermarry with pure Mahomedan women, but I mean  whole communities who have in olden days been forced to accept Islam.  In a few generations the face assumes an unmistakable Mahomedan type.  It is the difference in living and in thought that effects this change.    It is the same with animals inhabiting mountainous districts as  compared with the same living in the plains; constant enforced  exercise tells on the former, and induces a more robust and active form.    Whether diet operates in the same degree to effect changes I am  inclined to doubt. In man there is no dental or intestinal difference,  whether he be as carnivorous as an Esquimaux or as vegetarian as a  Hindu; whereas in created carnivorous, insectivorous, and  herbivorous animals there is a striking difference, instantly to be  recognised even in those of the same family. Therefore, if diet has  operated in effecting such changes, why has it not in the human race?    \"Who shall decide when doctors disagree?\" is a quotation that may  aptly be applied to the question of the classification of man; Cuvier,  Blumenbach, Fischer, Bory St. Vincent, Prichard, Latham, Morton,  Agassiz and others have each a system.    Cuvier recognises only three types--the Caucasian, the Mongolian,  and the Negro or Ethiopian, including Blumenbach's fourth and fifth  classes, American and Malay in Mongolian. But even Cuvier himself  could hardly reconcile the American with the Mongol; he had the high  cheek-bone and the scanty beard, it is true, but his eyes and his  nose were as Caucasian as could be, and his numerous dialects had  no affinity with the type to which he was assigned.    Fischer in his classification divided man into seven races:--    1_st_.--_Homo japeticus_, divided into three varieties--_Caucasicus_,  _Arabicus_ and _Indicus_.    2_nd_.--_H. Neptunianus_, consisting of--1st, the Malays peopling  the coasts of the islands of the Indian Ocean, Madagascar, &c.; 2nd,  New Zealanders and Islanders of the Pacific; and, 3rd, the Papuans.    3_rd_.--_H. Scythicus_. Three divisions, viz.: 1st, Calmucks and  other Tartars; 2nd, Chinese and Japanese; and, 3rd, Esquimaux.    4_th_.--_H. Americanus_, and    5_th_.--_H. Columbicus_, belong to the American Continent.    6_th_.--_H. AEthiopicus_. The Negro.    7_th_.--_H. Polynesius_. The _inland_ inhabitants of the Malay  Peninsula, of the Islands of the Indian Ocean, of Madagascar, New  Guinea, New Holland, &c.    I think this system is the one that most commends itself from its  clearness, but there are hardly two writers on ethnology who keep  to the same classification.    Agassiz classifies by realms, and has eight divisions.    The Indian races with which we have now to deal are distributed,  generally speaking, as follows:--    Caucasian.--(_Homo japeticus_, Bory and Fischer). Northerly,  westerly, and in the Valley of the Ganges in particular, but  otherwise generally distributed over the most cultivated parts of  the Peninsula, comprising the Afghans (Pathans), Sikhs, Brahmins,  Rajputs or Kshatryas of the north-west, the Arabs, Parsees, and  Mahrattas of the west coast, the Singhalese of the extreme south,  the Tamils of the east, and the Bengalis of the north-east.    Mongolians (_H. Scythicus_), inhabiting the chain of mountains to  the north, from Little Thibet on the west to Bhotan on the east, and  then sweeping downwards southerly to where Tenasserim joins the  Malay Peninsula. They comprise the Hill Tribes of the N. Himalayas,  the Goorkhas of Nepal, and the Hill Tribes of the north-eastern  frontier, viz. Khamtis, Singphos, Mishmis, Abors, Nagas, Jynteas,  Khasyas, and Garos. Those of the northern borders: Bhotias, Lepchas,  Limbus, Murmis and Haioos; of the Assam Valley Kachari, Mech and Koch.    The Malays (_H. Neptunianus_) Tipperah and Chittagong tribes, the  Burmese and Siamese.    Now comes the most difficult group to classify--the aborigines of  the interior, and of the hill ranges of Central India, the Kols, Gonds,  Bhils, and others which have certain characteristics of the  Mongolian, but with skins almost as dark as the Negro, and the full  eye of the Caucasian. The main body of these tribes, which I should  feel inclined to classify under Fischer's _H. Polynesius_, have been  divided by Indian ethnologists into two large groups--the Kolarians  and Dravidians. The former comprise the Juangs, Kharrias, Mundas,  Bhumij, Ho or Larka Kols, Santals, Birhors, Korwas, Kurs, Kurkus or  Muasis, Bhils, Minas, Kulis. The latter contains the Oraons, Malers,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19552"],[0,"The Plattsburg Manual: A Handbook for Military Training (#7)"],[1,"lique), place themselves abreast (on the  same line) of No. 1 and mark time.    Now it is difficult quickly to understand the movements of the rear  rank. Give them a lot of study and don't go on until you are certain  that you understand.    [Illustration: This is the way it is done.]    No. 3 moves straight to the front.    No. 2 follows No. 3.    No. 1 follows No. 2.    When they (Nos. 3, 2 and 1) arrive in rear of their file leaders, (Nos.  3, 2 and 1, front rank) they face to the right in marching and mark  time.    No. 4 of the rear rank moves straight to the front four paces, and  places himself abreast of No. 3, rear rank.    When No. 4, front rank, and No. 4, rear rank, are on the line, (and the  remainder of the squad must glance toward them to see when that is  true), the whole squad moves forward without further command.    Note that we have said that No. 1 front rank marks time. We see that he  becomes, temporarily, an immovable pivot for his squad. We, therefore,  call him a fixed pivot.    Had the command been squad left, instead of squad right, No. 4 would  have been the fixed pivot instead of No. 1.    Being in line, to turn and halt: 1. Squad right (left), 2. MARCH, 3.  Squad, 4. HALT.    The turn is executed as prescribed in the preceding case except that all  men, on arriving on the new line, mark time until the command halt is  given, when all halt.    Whenever the third command (i.e., squad) is given means that the command  halt is to follow. This is caution to the squad to prepare to halt. The  command halt should be given as No. 4 arrives on the line.        Second Movement      SQUAD RIGHT ABOUT    Being in line, to turn about and march: 1. Squad right (left) about, 2.  MARCH.    [Illustration:    This is what we have    This is what we want]    At the command march, the front rank twice executes Squad right,  initiating (starting) the second Squad right when No. 4 has arrived on  the line. That much is very simple.    The rear rank has a harder task. Let us have the front and rear rank  execute the movement separately:    [Illustration]    The rear rank is to take its place on the dotted line a b.    No. 3 rear rank moves straight to the front until in prolongation of  the line to be occupied by the rear rank.    No. 2 follows No. 3.    No. 1 follows No. 2.    When No. 3 arrives on the line to be occupied by the rear rank he  changes direction to the right; he moves in the new direction until in  rear of No. 3, front rank, when Nos. 3, 2, and 1, rear rank, are in rear  of Nos. 3, 2, and 1, front rank, (i.e., when they are in rear of their  front rank men), they face to the right in marching and mark time. No. 4  marches on the left of No. 3 to his new position. As he arrives on the  line, both ranks execute forward march without command, For the  remainder of the squad to know when No. 4 front and rear rank have  arrived on the line, they glance to see. The squad should step off on  the 9th count.        Third Movement      RIGHT TURN    Being in line: 1. Right (left) turn, 2. MARCH.    [Illustration: THIS IS THE WAY IT IS DONE]    At the command march, No. 1 front rank faces to the right in marching  and takes the half step. Nos. 2, 3, and 4 front rank right oblique  (turn 45 degrees to the right) until opposite their places in line, then  execute a second right oblique and take the half step on arriving  abreast of the pivot man. When No. 4 arrives on the line Nos. 1, 2, 3,  and 4 take the full step without further command. (To know when No. 4  arrives on the line it is necessary to glance in his direction.) Full  step on the 7th count.    The rear rank executes the movement in the same way and turns on the  same ground as the front rank. The rear rank, therefore, moves forward  at the command march, or continues to move forward, if already marching,  until it arrives at the place where the front turned, when it turns.    Note that the squad turns on No. 1 front rank but that he does not  remain in his position even temporarily, as in squad right; he is,  therefore, called the moving pivot. No. 4 is called the marching flank.    Had the command been left turn, No. 4 would have been the moving pivot,  and No. 1 the marching flank.    Knowing the three above movements, we are prepared for the following:    Being in line at a halt: 1. Take interval, 2. To the right (left), 3.  MARCH, 4. Squad, 5. HALT.    [Illustration: BEING IN THIS FORMATION]    At the command to the right (left), the rear rank men march backward  four steps (15 inches each step) and halt.    [Illustration: LIKE THIS    Note that the actual distance from the front rank to the rear rank is  now 40 plus 4x15 inches, i.e., 100 inches.]    At the command march, all face to the right and No. 1 front and rear  rank step off. No. 2, front and rear rank, follow No. 1, front and rear  rank, at a distance of four paces. Likewise with the other numbers.    [Illustration: Like this, when No. 1 front and rear rank have gained  four paces distance.]    At the command halt, given when No. 3 is three paces distant from No. 4,  all halt and face to the front.    [Illustration: The squad looks like this when the movement is  completed.]    Being at intervals: 1. Assemble, to the right, (left), 2. MARCH.    At the command march, No. 1 front rank stands fast. No. 1 rear rank  closes to 40 inches. The other men face to the right, close by the  shortest line, and face to the front.    [Illustration]    Being in line at a halt: 1. Take distance, 2. MARCH, 3. Squad, 4. HALT.    At the command march, No. 1 of the front rank moves straight to the  front; Nos. 2, 3, and 4 of the front rank and Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the  rear rank, in the order named, move straight to the front, each stepping  off so as to follow the preceding man at four paces. The command halt is  given when all have their distances.    In case more than one squad is in line, each squad executes the movement  as above. The guide of each rank of numbers is right.    [Illustration]    The front rank men should walk straight to the front and their rear rank  men should cover them accurately.    Being at distances, to assemble the squad: 1. Assemble, 2. MARCH.    No. 1 of the front rank stands fast; the other numbers move forward to  their proper places in line.        THE OBLIQUE MARCH      For the instruction of recruits, the squad being in column or correctly  aligned, the instructor causes the squad to face half right (or half  left), points out to the men their relative positions, and explains that  these are to be maintained in the oblique march.    1. Right (left) oblique, 2. MARCH.    Each man steps off in a direction 45 degrees to the right of his  original front. He preserves his relative position, keeping his  shoulders parallel to those of the guide (the man on the right front of  the line or column), and so regulates his steps that the ranks remain  parallel to their original front.    At the command halt, the men halt faced to the front.    To resume the original direction: 1. Forward, 2. MARCH.    [Illustration]    The men half face to the left in marching and then move straight to the  front.    If at half step or mark time while obliquing, the oblique march is  resumed by the commands: 1. Oblique, 2. MARCH.      TO FOLLOW THE CORPORAL    Being assembled or deployed, to march the squad without unnecessary  commands, the corporal places himself in front of it and commands:  FOLLOW ME.    If in line or skirmish line, No. 2 of the front rank follows in the  track of the corporal at about 3 paces; the other men conform to the  movements of No. 2, guiding on him and maintaining their relative  positions.    If in column, the head of the column follows the corporal.    [Illustration]    Note that No. 4 rear rank takes the place of the corporal when the  corporal is in front of the squad. This a general rule. When any front  rank man is absent his rear rank man steps up in the front rank. When  the squad is following the corporal No. 4 rear rank remains blank (i.e.,  No. 3 does not step to the left and cover No. 4).        TO DEPLOY AS SKIRMISHERS      Being in any formation, assembled: 1. As skirmishers, 2. MARCH.    The corporal places himself in front of the squad, if not already there.  Moving at a run, the men place themselves abreast of the corporal at  half-pace intervals. Nos. 1 and 2 on his right, Nos. 3 and 4 on his  left, rear-rank men on the right of their file leaders, extra men on the  left of No. 4; all then conform to the corporal's gait.    There is a rule of thumb that must be remembered. The rear-rank man is  always on the right of his file leader.    A common error is for beginners to execute the movement at a slow trot  which a run is required.    When the squad is acting alone, skirmish line is similarly formed on No.  2 of the front rank, who stands fast or continues the march, as the case  may be; the corporal places himself in front of the squad when advancing  and in rear when halted.    When deployed as skirmishers, the men march at ease, pieces at the trail  unless otherwise ordered.    The corporal is the guide when in the line; otherwise No. 2 front rank  is the guide. The guide is center.    The normal interval between skirmishers is one-half pace, resulting  practically in one man per yard of front. The front of a squad thus  deployed as skirmishers is about 10 paces.    [Illustration: SQUAD DEPLOYED ON CORPORAL    THIS IS THE WAY IT IS DONE]    The common error is to keep an interval of a very few inches when 15  inches are required.        TO INCREASE OR DIMINISH INTERVALS      If assembled, and it is desired to deploy at greater than the normal  interval; or if deployed, and it is desired to increase or decrease the  interval: 1. As skirmishers, (so many) paces, 2. MARCH.    Intervals are taken at the indicated number of paces. If already  deployed, the men move by the flank or away from the guide.    The above command is used but"]]]
