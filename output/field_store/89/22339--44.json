I also planted a few Black Champion; have not grown it long enough to  know definite results.    The demand for black currants is limited, but the prices are fair. As to  picking would say we pick them when not quite ripe, as the average  housewife claims they jell better than when over-ripe. They must be  picked by the stem and not stripped off--all defective, over-ripe and  bruised berries should be eliminated at the picking.    When the box is being filled a few gentle raps should be given to settle  the clusters into place, as they shake down considerably. All the  conveniences and same character of boxes and crates used in handling of  other small fruits are equally adapted to the currant.           *       *       *       *       *    WELCOME THE THRUSHES--THESE BIRDS DO THE FARMER LITTLE HARM AND MUCH  GOOD.--That thrushes--the group of birds in which are included  robins and bluebirds--do a great deal of good and very little harm to  agriculture is the conclusion reached by investigators of the United  States Department of Agriculture who have carefully studied the food  habits of these birds.

Report of Committee on Examination of Minnesota State Fruit-Breeding  Farm for the Year 1915.    DR. O. M. HUESTIS, MINNEAPOLIS; FRANK H. GIBBS, ST. ANTHONY PARK.      On the morning of October 12, 1915, your committee visited the State  Fruit-Breeding Farm, was met at the Zumbra Heights Station, on the M. &  St. Louis R.R., by Superintendent Haralson and were very soon in the  midst of a plat of over 3,000 everbearing strawberry plants all  different--some plants with scores of ripe and green berries as well as  blossoms, others with few berries and many runners. The superintendent  had already made selections and marked some 250 plants for propagation.  In another plat of 1,000 varieties it was very apparent that No. 1017, a  cross between Pan-American and Dunlap, was the superior, although others  were choice, both as plant makers and fruit-bearers. No doubt many  excellent kinds will come from those selected. It certainly was  encouraging to be able, even after the heavy frost of a week before, to  pick three quarts of large, well ripened berries, a photo of which we  obtained on reaching the city and will appear in the Horticulturist.    [Illustration: Field of No. 3 June-bearing strawberries at State  Fruit-Breeding Farm.]    Of the June-bearing varieties No. 3, a cross between Senator Dunlap and  Pocomoke, would seem to surpass anything else we saw as to strength of  plant and health of foliage. As to its fruiting ability, will refer to  the display made at the last summer meeting of the society, which was so  much admired. We have no doubt there is a great future for No. 3, as has  been for its illustrious parent, the Dunlap. Next we went over to the  raspberry field containing, it seemed, thousands of strong, straight,  healthy plants, which would have to be seen to be appreciated and only  then when in fruiting. No. 4 took our special attention. The canes were  especially clean, well branched and healthy--a cross between Loudon and  King. Many others seem to be very promising.    [Illustration: Everbearing strawberries, No. 1017. Minnesota State  Fruit-Breeding Farm. Gathered October 12, 1915.]    Next we were shown a variety of everbearing raspberry from which we  indulged in ripe fruit of good size and flavor and which it is hoped  will be as valuable as the everbearing strawberry. Of the thousands of  everbearing seedlings selections had been made of about 100 which were  fine looking plants, well cultivated and free from disease.    We were then shown some hundreds of wild peach seedlings, seedlings of  Burbank plums, thousands of hybrid plums of all ages, and a plat of  thousands of plum seedlings which will be disposed of to nurserymen this  fall and bring a nice income to the state; also wild pears from  Manchuria with good prospects of being hardy and free from blight.    We saw a number of nice plum trees, of which the superintendent told us  the fruit would color before ripening and would stand long shipments,  which so far promise well. Several hundred Beta grape seedlings probably  even more hardy than the parent, many crosses in roses which if judged  by the foliage must be seen in bloom to be appreciated, seedlings of  Compass cherry crossed with apricot; Compass cherry crossed with  nectarines; seedling currants, over 2,000 from which to select the best.  Over a hundred commercial varieties of apples from East and West, and  over 200 varieties of peaches from China and Manchuria, walnuts,  butternuts and many dwarf apple trees on Paradise stocks, which fruit  early. A good field of corn in shock, for feed for the horses. The old  orchard on the place when bought, which had been top-worked to some  extent, looked healthy everywhere. The farm seemed to be free from  noxious woods, free from pocket gophers or moles and well cultivated, we  thought, for the small number of men employed. Machinery and tools were  well housed. We were also pleased to be shown through the new home of  the superintendent, not yet occupied, which seemed to be complete in all  its appointments.    We think the state has a great asset in the farm and recommend that as  far as possible members of this society visit it during the coming  summer and that the society use its influence with the Board of Regents  that more land be procured as soon as possible in order that trial  plants may remain longer to more definitely prove their worth and that a  greater work may be done for the state. We notice in a report made just  six years before, viz., October 12, 1909, by Brothers Wedge, Underwood  and the then president of the society, Prof. Green, that even runnerless  everbearing strawberries were represented and that they had the usual  pleasure of picking strawberry blossoms in October. Had they been with  us they would have had a large dish of No. 1017 covered with rich cream  and served at the hand of Mrs. Haralson.    Mr. C. S. Harrison: Mr. Chairman, I think the slogan of this society  should be \"Urbanize the country and ruralize the town.\" I see tremendous  changes going on all the while. Can you think of the possibilities of  Minnesota? About 40 per cent of the land under cultivation and that half  worked. By and by there is going to be a crop of boys who will raise  seventy-five to 100 bushels of corn to the acre where their dads raised  twenty-five.

Marketing fruit or any farm product by association is the modern  farmer's insurance of results.    A great deal might be said on this subject, but I shall tell you briefly  what the Bay Lake Fruit Growers' Association have accomplished.    The first raspberry growing for market at Bay Lake was back in 1886.  Nick Newgard, one of our first settlers, sold quite a few berries that  year. Bay Lake is seven miles from Deerwood, the nearest railroad point,  and at that time there was only a trail between these places, and it was  necessary for Mr. Newgard to pack his berries in on his back. This same  method was used in transporting supplies.    [Illustration: Strawberry field on place of A. N. Gray, at Bay Lake.]    Mr. Newgard told me recently that he received a very good profit on his  berries the first ten years, but each year the acreage increased and  each year the growers' troubles increased in disposing of the crop.    In 1909 there was an unusually large crop and, shipping individually, as  we did at that time, it was a case of all shipments going to Duluth one  day, flooding the market, then the next day every one shipping to Fargo  and flooding that market, and at the end of the season when the growers  received their final returns they found that they had received very  small pay for their berries.    In the fall of that year the growers around Bay Lake called a meeting to  see if some organization could not be formed to handle their berries  and look after the collections. The result of this meeting was the  incorporation of the Bay Lake Fruit Growers' Association.    When the berry season opened in 1910 we had a manager, hired for the  season, on a salary, who worked under a board of five managing  directors. It was the manager's business to receive the berries at the  station, find a market for them, make the collections and settlements  with the growers. The result of this first year was so satisfactory to  the members that the total membership increased that fall to almost 100.  This new system had eliminated all the worry, and we received a good  price for our berries after the expense of our manager had been  deducted.    We have just closed our sixth season, which by the way has been a very  successful one, as the prices received have been above the average. We  now have about 150 members, and we have two shipping stations, Deerwood  and Aitkin. We market strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, currants,  gooseberries, plums, Compass cherries, apples, sweet corn and celery.    We have a nice trade worked up and have little trouble in finding a  ready market for any of our products.    It is our aim, as growers, to give our customers all A No. 1 quality.

While of course for the purpose of this paper an  examination of the originals would have been preferable, yet, in as much  as the Smithsonian Institution contains casts which attest the general  accuracy of the drawings given, and, as the illustrations by other  authors afford no higher idea of their artistic execution, it would seem  that any criticism applicable to these illustrations must in the main  apply to the originals. With reference to the casts in the Smithsonian  collection it may be stated that Dr. Rau, who had abundant opportunity  to acquaint himself with the originals while in the possession of Mr.  Davis, informs the writer that they accurately represent the carvings,  and for purposes of study are practically as good as the originals. The  latter are, as is well known, in the Blackmore Museum, England.    [Illustration: Fig. 26.--\"Rattlesnake,\" from Squier and Davis.]    Without going into further detail the matter may be summed up as  follows: Of forty-five of the animal carvings, including a few of clay,  which are figured in Squier and Davis's work, eleven are left unnamed by  the authors as not being recognizable; nineteen are identified  correctly, in a general way, as of a wolf, bear, heron, toad, &c.;  sixteen are demonstrably wrongly identified, leaving but five of which  the species is correctly given.    From this showing it appears that either the above authors' zoological  knowledge was faulty in the extreme, or else the mound sculptors'  ability in animal carving has been amazingly overestimated. However just  the first supposition may be, the last is certainly true.          SKILL IN SCULPTURE OF MOUND-BUILDERS.      In considering the degree of skill exhibited by the mound sculptors in  their delineation of the features and characteristics of animals, it is  of the utmost importance to note that the carvings of birds and animals  which have evoked the most extravagant expressions of praise as to the  exactness with which nature has been copied are uniformly those which,  owing to the possession of some unusual or salient characteristic, are  exceedingly easy of imitation. The stout body and broad flat tail of the  beaver, the characteristic physiognomy of the wild cat and panther, so  utterly dissimilar to that of other animals, the tufted head and  fish-eating habits of the heron, the raptorial bill and claws of the  hawk, the rattle of the rattlesnake, are all features which the rudest  skill could scarcely fail to portray.    It is by the delineation of these marked and unmistakable features, and  not the sculptor's power to express the subtleties of animal  characteristics, that enables the identity of a comparatively small  number of the carvings to be established. It is true that the contrary  has often been asserted, and that almost everything has been claimed for  the carvings, in the way of artistic execution, that would be claimed  for the best products of modern skill. Squier and Davis in fact go so  far in their admiration (Ancient Monuments, p. 272), as to say that, so  far as fidelity is concerned, many of them (_i.e._, animal carvings)  deserve to rank by the side of the best efforts of the artist  naturalists in our own day--a statement which is simply preposterous. So  far, in point of fact, is this from being true that an examination of  the series of animal sculptures cannot fail to convince any one, who is  even tolerably well acquainted with our common birds and animals, that  it is simply impossible to recognize specific features in the great  majority of them. They were either not intended to be copies of  particular species, or, if so intended, the artist's skill was wholly  inadequate for his purpose.    Some remarks by Dr. Coues, quoted in an article by E. A. Barber on Mound  Pipes in the American Naturalist for April, 1882, are so apropos to the  subject that they are here reprinted. The paragraph is in response to a  request to identify a bird pipe:         As is so frequently the probable case in such matters, I am       inclined to think the sculptor had no particular bird in mind in       executing his rude carving. It is not necessary, or indeed,       permissible, to suppose that particular species were intended to be       represented. Not unfrequently the likeness of some marked bird is       so good as to be unmistakable, but the reverse is oftener the case;       and in the present instance I can make no more of the carving than       you have done, excepting that if any particular species may have       been in the carver's mind, his execution does not suffice for its       determination.    The views entertained by Dr. Coues as to the resemblances of the  carvings will thus be seen to coincide with those expressed above.  Another prominent ornithologist, Mr. Ridgway, has also given verbal  expression to precisely similar views.    So far, therefore, as the carvings themselves afford evidence to the  naturalist, their general likeness entirely accords with the supposition  that they were not intended to be copies of particular species. Many of  the specimens are in fact just about what might be expected when a  workman, with crude ideas of art expression, sat down with intent to  carve out a bird, for instance, without the desire, even if possessed of  the requisite degree of skill, to impress upon the stone the details  necessary to make it the likeness of a particular species.      GENERALIZATION NOT DESIGNED.    While the resemblances of most of the carvings, as indicated above, must  be admitted to be of a general and not of a special character, it does  not follow that their general type was the result of design.    Such an explanation of their general character and resemblances is,  indeed, entirely inconsistent with certain well-known facts regarding  the mental operations of primitive or semi-civilized man. To the mind of  primitive man abstract conceptions of things, while doubtless not  entirely wanting, are at best but vaguely defined. The experience of  numerous investigators attests how difficult it is, for instance, to  obtain from a savage the name of a class of animals in distinction from  a particular species of that class. Thus it is easy to obtain the names  of the several kinds of bears known to a savage, but his mind  obstinately refuses to entertain the idea of a bear genus or class. It  is doubtless true that this difficulty is in no small part due simply to  the confusion arising from the fact that the savage's method of  classification is different from that of his questioner. For, although  primitive man actually does classify all concrete things into groups,  the classification is of a very crude sort, and has for a basis a very  different train of ideas from those upon which modern science is  established--a fact which many investigators are prone to overlook.  Still there seems to be good ground for believing that the conception of  a bird, for instance, in the abstract as distinct from some particular  kind or species would never be entertained by a people no further  advanced in culture than their various relics prove the Mound-Builders  to have been. In his carving, therefore, of a hawk, a bear, a heron, or  a fish, it seems highly probable that the mound sculptor had in mind a  distinct species, as we understand the term. Hence his failure to  reproduce specific features in a recognizable way is to be attributed to  the fact that his skill was inadequate to transfer the exact image  present in his mind, and not to his intention to carve out a general  representative of the avian class.    To carry the imitative idea farther and to suggest, as has been done by  writers, that the carver of the Mound-Building epoch sat down to his  work with the animal or a model of it before him, as does the accurate  zoological artist of our own day, is wholly insupported by evidence  derivable from the carvings themselves, and is of too imaginative a  character to be entertained. By the above remarks as to the lack of  specific resemblances in the animal carvings it is not intended to deny  that some of them have been executed with a considerable degree of skill  and spirit as well as, within certain limitations heretofore expressed,  fidelity to nature. Taking them as a whole it can perhaps be asserted  that they have been carved with a skill considerably above the general  average of attainments in art of our Indian tribes, but not above the  best efforts of individual tribes.    That they will by no means bear the indiscriminate praise they have  received as works of art and as exact imitations of nature may be  asserted with all confidence.      PROBABLE TOTEMIC ORIGIN.    With reference to the origin of these animal sculptures many writers  appear inclined to the view that they are purely decorative and  ornamental in character, _i.e._, that they are attempts at close  imitations of nature in the sense demanded by high art, and that they  owe their origin to the artistic instinct alone. But there is much in  their general appearance that suggests they may have been totemic in  origin, and that whatever of ornamental character they may possess is of  secondary importance.    With, perhaps, no exceptions, the North American tribes practiced  totemism in one or other of its various forms, and, although it by no  means follows that all the carving and etchings of birds or animals by  these tribes are totems, yet it is undoubtedly true that the totemic  idea is traceable in no small majority of their artistic  representations, whatever their form. As rather favoring the idea of the  totemic meaning of the carvings, it may be pointed out that a  considerable number of the recognizable birds and animals are precisely  the ones known to have been used as totems by many tribes of Indians.
