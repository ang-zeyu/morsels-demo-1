In the day-time and in the night season, at even and at morn, We pray to  God on thy behalf, that He may graciously aid thee to be obedient unto Him  and to observe His commandment, that He may shield thee from the hosts of  the evil ones. Do, therefore, as it pleaseth thee, and treat Us as  befitteth thy station and beseemeth thy sovereignty. Be not forgetful of  the law of God in whatever thou desirest to achieve, now or in the days to  come. Say: Praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds!          NASIRI'D-DIN SHAH      O KING! I was but a man like others, asleep upon My couch, when lo, the  breezes of the All-Glorious were wafted over Me, and taught Me the  knowledge of all that hath been. This thing is not from Me, but from One  Who is Almighty and All-Knowing. And He bade Me lift up My voice between  earth and heaven, and for this there befell Me what hath caused the tears  of every man of understanding to flow. The learning current amongst men I  studied not; their schools I entered not. Ask of the city wherein I dwelt,  that thou mayest be well assured that I am not of them who speak falsely.  This is but a leaf which the winds of the will of thy Lord, the Almighty,  the All-Praised, have stirred. Can it be still when the tempestuous winds  are blowing? Nay, by Him Who is the Lord of all Names and Attributes! They  move it as they list. The evanescent is as nothing before Him Who is the  Ever-Abiding. His all-compelling summons hath reached Me, and caused Me to  speak His praise amidst all people. I was indeed as one dead when His  behest was uttered. The hand of the will of thy Lord, the Compassionate,  the Merciful, transformed Me. Can any one speak forth of his own accord  that for which all men, both high and low, will protest against him? Nay,  by Him Who taught the Pen the eternal mysteries, save him whom the grace  of the Almighty, the All-Powerful, hath strengthened. The Pen of the Most  High addresseth Me saying: Fear not. Relate unto His Majesty the Shah that  which befell thee. His heart, verily, is between the fingers of thy Lord,  the God of Mercy, that haply the sun of justice and bounty may shine forth  above the horizon of his heart. Thus hath the decree been irrevocably  fixed by Him Who is the All-Wise.    Look upon this Youth, O King, with the eyes of justice; judge thou, then,  with truth concerning what hath befallen Him. Of a verity, God hath made  thee His shadow amongst men, and the sign of His power unto all that dwell  on earth. Judge thou between Us and them that have wronged Us without  proof and without an enlightening Book. They that surround thee love thee  for their own sakes, whereas this Youth loveth thee for thine own sake,  and hath had no desire except to draw thee nigh unto the seat of grace,  and to turn thee toward the right-hand of justice. Thy Lord beareth  witness unto that which I declare.    O King! Wert thou to incline thine ear unto the shrill of the Pen of Glory  and the cooing of the Dove of Eternity which, on the branches of the  Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing, uttereth praises to God, the  Maker of all names and Creator of earth and heaven, thou wouldst attain  unto a station from which thou wouldst behold in the world of being naught  save the effulgence of the Adored One, and wouldst regard thy sovereignty  as the most contemptible of thy possessions, abandoning it to whosoever  might desire it, and setting thy face toward the Horizon aglow with the  light of His countenance. Neither wouldst thou ever be willing to bear the  burden of dominion save for the purpose of helping thy Lord, the Exalted,  the Most High. Then would the Concourse on high bless thee. O how  excellent is this most sublime station, couldst thou ascend thereunto  through the power of a sovereignty recognized as derived from the Name of  God!...    O King of the age! The eyes of these refugees are turned towards and fixed  upon the mercy of the Most Merciful. No doubt is there whatever that these  tribulations will be followed by the outpourings of a supreme mercy, and  these dire adversities be succeeded by an overflowing prosperity. We fain  would hope, however, that His Majesty the Shah will himself examine these  matters, and bring hope to the hearts. That which We have submitted to thy  Majesty is indeed for thine highest good. And God, verily, is a sufficient  witness unto Me....    O would that thou wouldst permit Me, O Shah, to send unto thee that which  would cheer the eyes, and tranquillize the souls, and persuade every  fair-minded person that with Him is the knowledge of the Book... But for  the repudiation of the foolish and the connivance of the divines, I would  have uttered a discourse that would have thrilled and carried away the  hearts unto a realm from the murmur of whose winds can be heard: 'No God  is there but He!'...    I have seen, O Shah, in the path of God what eye hath not seen nor ear  heard... How numerous the tribulations which have rained, and will soon  rain, upon Me! I advance with My face set towards Him Who is the Almighty,  the All-Bounteous, whilst behind Me glideth the serpent. Mine eyes have  rained down tears until My bed is drenched. I sorrow not for Myself,  however. By God! Mine head yearneth for the spear out of love for its  Lord. I never passed a tree, but Mine heart addressed it saying: 'O would  that thou wert cut down in My name, and My body crucified upon thee, in  the path of My Lord!'... By God! Though weariness lay Me low, and hunger  consume Me, and the bare rock be My bed, and My fellows the beasts of the  field, I will not complain, but will endure patiently as those endued with  constancy and firmness have endured patiently, through the power of God,  the Eternal King and Creator of the nations, and will render thanks unto  God under all conditions. We pray that, out of His bounty--exalted be He--He  may release, through this imprisonment, the necks of men from chains and  fetters, and cause them to turn, with sincere faces, towards His Face, Who  is the Mighty, the Bounteous. Ready is He to answer whosoever calleth upon  Him, and nigh is He unto such as commune with Him.          THE RULERS OF AMERICA      HEARKEN ye, O Rulers of America and the Presidents of the Republics  therein, unto that which the Dove is warbling on the Branch of Eternity:  There is none other God but Me, the Ever-Abiding, the Forgiving, the  All-Bountiful. Adorn ye the temple of dominion with the ornament of  justice and of the fear of God, and its head with the crown of the  remembrance of your Lord, the Creator of the heavens. Thus counselleth you  He Who is the Dayspring of Names, as bidden by Him Who is the All-Knowing,  the All-Wise. The Promised One hath appeared in this glorified Station,  whereat all beings, both seen and unseen, have rejoiced. Take ye advantage  of the Day of God. Verily, to meet Him is better for you than all that  whereon the sun shineth, could ye but know it. O concourse of rulers! Give  ear unto that which hath been raised from the Dayspring of Grandeur:  Verily, there is none other God but Me, the Lord of Utterance, the  All-Knowing. Bind ye the broken with the hands of justice, and crush the  oppressor who flourisheth with the rod of the commandments of your Lord,  the Ordainer, the All-Wise.          THE ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLES IN EVERY LAND      O YE the elected representatives of the people in every land! Take ye  counsel together, and let your concern be only for that which profiteth  mankind, and bettereth the condition thereof, if ye be of them that scan  heedfully. Regard the world as the human body which, though at its  creation whole and perfect, hath been afflicted, through various causes,  with grave disorders and maladies. Not for one day did it gain ease, nay  its sickness waxed more severe, as it fell under the treatment of ignorant  physicians, who gave full rein to their personal desires, and have erred  grievously. And if, at one time, through the care of an able physician, a  member of that body was healed, the rest remained afflicted as before.  Thus informeth you the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.    We behold it, in this day, at the mercy of rulers so drunk with pride that  they cannot discern clearly their own best advantage, much less recognize  a Revelation so bewildering and challenging as this. And whenever any one  of them hath striven to improve its condition, his motive hath been his  own gain, whether confessedly so or not; and the unworthiness of this  motive hath limited his power to heal or cure.    That which the Lord hath ordained as the sovereign remedy and mightiest  instrument for the healing of all the world is the union of all its  peoples in one universal Cause, one common Faith. This can in no wise be  achieved except through the power of a skilled, an all-powerful and  inspired Physician. This, verily, is the truth, and all else naught but  error....            SUMMONS TO THE WORLD'S RELIGIOUS LEADERS COLLECTIVELY          \"O LEADERS of religion! Weigh not the Book of...\"      O LEADERS of religion! Weigh not the Book of God with such standards and  sciences as are current amongst you, for the Book itself is the unerring  balance established amongst men. In this most perfect balance whatsoever  the peoples and kindreds of the earth possess must be weighed, while the  measure of its weight should be tested according to its own standard, did  ye but know it.    The eye of My loving-kindness weepeth sore over you, inasmuch as ye have  failed to recognize the One upon Whom ye have been calling in the daytime  and in the night season, at even and at morn. Advance, O people, with  snow-white faces and radiant hearts, unto the blest and crimson Spot,  wherein the Sadratu'l-Muntaha is calling: 'Verily, there is none other God  beside Me,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16986"],[0,"The Seven Valleys and the Four Valleys (#7)"],[1,"the fragrance of His garment(120) blowing  from the Egypt of Baha;(121) verily He seemeth near at hand, though men  may think Him far away.(122) My soul doth smell the perfume shed by the  Beloved One; My sense is filled with the fragrance of My dear Companion.      The duty of long years of love obey    And tell the tale of happy days gone by,    That land and sky may laugh aloud today,    And it may gladden mind and heart and eye.(123)    This is the realm of full awareness, of utter self-effacement. Even love  is no pathway to this region, and longing hath no dwelling here; wherefore  is it said, \"Love is a veil betwixt the lover and the beloved.\" Here love  becometh an obstruction and a barrier, and all else save Him is but a  curtain. The wise Sana'i hath written:      Never the covetous heart shall come to the stealer of hearts,    Never the shrouded soul unite with beauty's rose.    For this is the realm of Absolute Command and is free of all the  attributes of earth.    The exalted dwellers in this mansion do wield divine authority in the  court of rapture, with utter gladness, and they do bear a kingly sceptre.  On the high seats of justice, they issue their commands, and they send  down gifts according to each man's deserving. Those who drink of this cup  abide in the high bowers of splendor above the Throne of the Ancient of  Days, and they sit in the Empyrean of Might within the Lofty Pavilion:  \"Naught shall they know of sun or piercing cold.\"(124)    Herein the high heavens are in no conflict with the lowly earth, nor do  they seek to excel it, for this is the land of mercy, not the realm of  distinction. Albeit at every moment these souls appear in a new office,  yet their condition is ever the same. Wherefore of this realm it is  written, \"No work withholdeth Him from another.\"(125) And of another state  it is said: \"Every day doth some new work employ Him.\"(126) This is the  food whose savor changeth not, whose color altereth not. If thou eatest  thereof, thou shalt verily chant this verse: \"I turn my face to Him Who  hath created the Heavens and the earth ... I am not one of those who add  gods to God.\"(127) \"And thus did we show Abraham the Kingdom of the  Heavens and of the Earth, that He might be established in knowledge.\"(128)  Wherefore, put thy hand into thy bosom, then stretch it forth with power,  and behold, thou shalt find it a light unto all the world.\"(129)    How crystal this cool water that the Cup-Bearer bringeth! How bright this  pure wine in the hands of the Beloved! How delicate this draught from the  Heavenly Cup! May it do them good, whoso drink thereof, and taste of its  sweetness and attain to its knowledge.      It is not fitting that I tell thee more,    For the stream's bed cannot hold the sea.(130)    For the mystery of this utterance is hid within the storehouse of the  Great Infallibility(131) and laid up in the treasuries of power. It is  sanctified above the jewels of explanation; it is beyond what the most  subtle of tongues can tell.    Astonishment here is highly prized, and utter poverty essential. Wherefore  hath it been said, \"Poverty is My pride.\"(132) And again: \"God hath a  people beneath the dome of glory, whom He hideth in the clothing of  radiant poverty.\"(133) These are they who see with His eyes, hear with His  ears, as it is written in the well-known tradition.    Concerning this realm, there is many a tradition and many a verse, of  broad or special relevancy, but two of these will suffice to serve as a  light for men of mind and heart.    The first is His statement: \"O My Servant! Obey Me and I shall make thee  like unto Myself. I say 'Be,' and it is, and thou shalt say 'Be,' and it  shall be.\"    And the second: \"O Son of Adam! Seek fellowship with none until thou hast  found Me, and whenever thou shalt long for Me, thou shalt find Me close to  thee.\"    Whatever high proofs and wondrous allusions are recounted herein, concern  but a single Letter, a single Point. \"Such hath been the way of God ...  and no change canst thou find in the way of God.\"(134)    I began this epistle some time ago, in thy remembrance, and since thy  letter had not reached me then, I began with some words of reproach. Now,  thy new missive hath dispelled that feeling and causeth Me to write thee.  To speak of My love for thine Eminence is needless. \"God is a sufficient  witness!\"(135) For his Eminence Shaykh Muhammad--May God the Exalted bless  him!--I shall confine Myself to the two following verses which I request be  delivered to him:      I seek thy nearness, dearer than sweet Heaven;    I see thy visage, fairer than Paradise bowers.(136)    When I entrusted this message of love to My pen, it refused the burden,  and it swooned away. Then coming to itself, it spoke and said, \"Glory be  to Thee! To Thee do I turn in penitence, and I am the first of them that  believe.\"(137) Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds!      Let us tell, some other day    This parting hurt and woe;    Let us write, some other way,    Love's secrets--better so.    Leave blood and noise and all of these,    And say no more of Shams-i-Tabriz.(138)    Peace be upon thee, and upon those who circle around thee and attain thy  meeting.    What I had written ere this hath been eaten by the flies, so sweet was the  ink. As Sa'di saith: \"I shall forbear from writing any longer, for my  sweet words have drawn the flies about me.\"    And now the hand can write no more, and pleadeth that this is enough.  Wherefore do I say, \"Far be the glory of thy Lord, the Lord of all  greatness, from what they affirm of Him.\"(139)              FOOTNOTES          1 The Manifestation.        2 Muhammad, Ahmad and Mahmud are names and titles of the Prophet,        derived from the verb \"to praise,\" \"to exalt.\"        3 Qur'an 17:110.        4 Sermon by 'Ali.        5 Qur'an 2:282.        6 Qur'an 16:71.        7 Qur'an 16:71.        8 The holy Sanctuary at Mecca.
