Brought up  as a Quaker, she had no obstacles put in the way of her education. She  had an exceptional father who was proud of his daughters' intelligence  and ability and respected their opinions and decisions. Her only real  complaint was the low salary she had been obliged to accept as a  teacher because she was a woman. She sensed a feeling of male  superiority, which she resented, in her brother-in-law, Aaron McLean,  who did not approve of women preachers and who thought it more  important for a woman to bake biscuits than to study algebra. She met  the same arrogance of sex in her Cousin Margaret's husband, but she  had not analyzed the cause, or seen the need of concerted action by  women.    Returning home for her vacation in August, she found to her surprise  that a second woman's rights convention had been held in Rochester in  the Unitarian church, that her mother, her father, and her sister  Mary, and many of their Quaker friends had not only attended, but had  signed the Declaration of Sentiments and the resolutions, and that her  cousin, Sarah Burtis Anthony, had acted as secretary. Her father  showed so much interest, as he told her about the meetings, that she  laughingly remarked, \"I think you are getting a good deal ahead of the  times.\"[29] She countered Mary's ardent defense of the convention with  good-natured ridicule. The whole family, however, continued to be so  enthusiastic over the meetings and this new movement for woman's  rights, they talked so much about Elizabeth Cady Stanton \"with her  black curls and ruddy cheeks\"[30] and about Lucretia Mott \"with her  Quaker cap and her crossed handkerchief of the finest muslin,\" both  \"speaking so grandly and looking magnificent,\" that Susan's interest  was finally aroused and she decided she would like to meet these women  and talk with them. There was no opportunity for this, however, before  she returned to Canajoharie for another year of teaching.    It proved to be a year of great sadness because of the illness of her  cousin Margaret whom she loved dearly. In addition to her teaching,  she nursed Margaret and looked after the house and children. She saw  much to discredit the belief that men were the stronger and women the  weaker sex, and impatient with Margaret's husband, she wrote her  mother that there were some drawbacks to marriage that made a woman  quite content to remain single. In explanation she added, \"Joseph had  a headache the other day and Margaret remarked that she had had one  for weeks. 'Oh,' said the husband, 'mine is the real headache, genuine  pain, yours is sort of a natural consequence.'\"[31]    Within a few weeks Margaret died. This was heart-breaking for Susan,  and without her cousin, Canajoharie offered little attraction.  Teaching had become irksome. The new principal was uncongenial, a  severe young man from the South whose father was a slaveholder. Susan  longed for a change, and as she read of the young men leaving for the  West, lured by gold in California, she envied them their adventure and  their opportunity to explore and conquer a whole new world.    [Illustration: Frederick Douglass]           *       *       *       *       *    The peaches were ripe when Susan returned to the farm. The orchard  which her father had planted, now bore abundantly. Restless and eager  for hard physical work, she discarded the stylish hoops which impeded  action, put on an old calico dress, and spent days in the warm  September sunshine picking peaches. Then while she preserved, canned,  and pickled them, there was little time to long for pioneering in the  West.    She enjoyed the active life on the farm for she was essentially a  doer, most happy when her hands and her mind were busy. As she helped  with the housework, wove rag carpet, or made shirts by hand for her  father and brothers, she dreamed of the future, of the work she might  do to make her life count for something. Teaching, she decided, was  definitely behind her. She would not allow her sister Mary's interest  in that career to persuade her otherwise, even if teaching were the  only promising and well-thought-of occupation for women. Reading the  poems of Elizabeth Barrett Browning, she was deeply stirred and looked  forward romantically to some great and useful life work.    The _Liberator_, with its fearless denunciation of Negro slavery, now  came regularly to the Anthony home, and as she pored over its pages,  its message fired her soul. Eagerly she called with her father at the  home of Frederick Douglass, who had recently settled in Rochester and  was publishing his paper, the _North Star_. Not only did she want to  show friendliness to this free Negro of whose intelligence and  eloquence she had heard so much, but she wanted to hear first-hand  from him and his wife of the needs of his people.    Almost every Sunday the antislavery Quakers met at the Anthony farm.  The Posts, the Hallowells, the De Garmos, and the Willises were sure  to be there. Sometimes they sent a wagon into the city for Frederick  Douglass and his family. Now and then famous abolitionists joined the  circle when their work brought them to western New York--William Lloyd  Garrison, looking with fatherly kindness at his friends through his  small steel-rimmed spectacles; Wendell Phillips, handsome, learned,  and impressive; black-bearded, fiery Parker Pillsbury; and the  friendly Unitarian pastor from Syracuse, the Reverend Samuel J. May.  Susan, helping her mother with dinner for fifteen or twenty, was torn  between establishing her reputation as a good cook and listening to  the interesting conversation. She heard them discuss woman's rights,  which had divided the antislavery ranks. They talked of their  antislavery campaigns and the infamous compromises made by Congress to  pacify the powerful slaveholding interests. Like William Lloyd  Garrison, all of them refused to vote, not wishing to take any part in  a government which countenanced slavery. They called the Constitution  a proslavery document, advocated \"No Union with Slaveholders,\" and  demanded immediate and unconditional emancipation. All about them and  with their help the Underground Railroad was operating, circumventing  the Fugitive Slave Law and guiding Negro refugees to Canada and  freedom. Amy and Isaac Post's barn, Susan knew, was a station on the  Underground, and the De Garmos and Frederick Douglass almost always  had a Negro hidden away. She heard of riots and mobs in Boston and  Ohio; but in Rochester not a fugitive was retaken and there were no  street battles, although the New York _Herald_ advised the city to  throw its \"nigger printing press\"[32] into Lake Ontario and banish  Douglass to Canada.    As the Society of Friends in Rochester was unfriendly to the  antislavery movement, Susan with her father and other liberal Hicksite  Quakers left it for the Unitarian church. Here for the first time they  listened to \"hireling ministry\" and to a formal church service with  music. This was a complete break with what they had always known as  worship, but the friendly Christian spirit expressed by both minister  and congregation made them soon feel at home. This new religious  fellowship put Susan in touch with the most advanced thought of the  day, broke down some of the rigid precepts drilled into her at Deborah  Moulson's seminary, and encouraged liberalism and tolerance. Although  there had been austerity in the outward forms of her Quaker training,  it had developed in her a very personal religion, a strong sense of  duty, and a high standard of ethics, which always remained with her.  It had fostered a love of mankind that reached out spontaneously to  help the needy, the unfortunate, and the oppressed, and this now  became the driving force of her life. It led her naturally to seek  ways and means to free the Negro from slavery and to turn to the  temperance movement to wipe out the evil of drunkenness.    These were the days when the reformed drunkard, John B. Gough, was  lecturing throughout the country with the zeal of an evangelist,  getting thousands to sign the total-abstinence pledge. Inspired by his  example, the Daughters of Temperance were active in Rochester. They  elected Susan their president, and not only did she plan suppers and  festivals to raise money for their work but she organized new  societies in neighboring towns. Her more ambitious plans for them were  somewhat delayed by home responsibilities which developed when her  father became an agent of the New York Life Insurance Company. This  took him away from home a great deal, and as both her brothers were  busy with work of their own and Mary was teaching, it fell to Susan to  take charge of the farm. She superintended the planting, the  harvesting, and the marketing, and enjoyed it, but she did not let it  crowd out her interest in the causes which now seemed so vital.    Horace Greeley's New York _Tribune_ came regularly to the farm, for  the Anthonys, like many others throughout the country, had come to  depend upon it for what they felt was a truthful report of the news.  In this day of few magazines, it met a real need, and Susan, poring  over its pages, not only kept in touch with current events, but found  inspiration in its earnest editorials which so often upheld the ideals  which she felt were important. She found thought-provoking news in the  full and favorable report of the national woman's rights convention  held in Worcester, Massachusetts, in October 1850. Better informed now  through her antislavery friends about this new movement for woman's  rights, she was ready to consider it seriously and she read all the  stirring speeches, noting the caliber of the men and women taking  part. Garrison, Phillips, Pillsbury, and Lucretia Mott were there, as  well as Lucy Stone, that appealing young woman of whose eloquence on"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20461"],[0,"German Culture Past and Present (#7)"],[1,"constitutions mentioned, which  bore respectively the names of the Emperors Sigismund and Friedrich.  It was in this form that the Hussite theories were absorbed by the  German mind. The hopes of the Messianists of the \"Holy Roman Empire\"  were centred at one time in the Emperor Sigismund. Later on the role  of Messiah was carried over to his successor, Friedrich III, upon whom  the hopes of the German people were cast.    _The Reformation of Kaiser Sigismund_, originally written about 1438,  went through several editions before the end of the century, and was  as many times reprinted during the opening years of Luther's movement.  Like its successor, that of Friedrich, the scheme attributed to  Sigismund proposed the abolition of the recent abuses of feudalism, of  the new lawyer class, and of the symptoms already making themselves  felt of the change from barter to money payments. It proposed, in  short, a return to primitive conditions. It was a scheme of reform on  a Biblical basis, embracing many elements of a distinctly communistic  character, as communism was then understood. It was pervaded with the  idea of equality in the spirit of the Taborite literature of the age,  from which it took its origin.    The so-called _Reformation of Kaiser Sigismund_ dealt especially with  the peasantry--the serfs and villeins of the time; that attributed to  Friedrich was mainly concerned with the rising population of the  towns. All towns and communes were to undergo a constitutional  transformation. Handicraftsmen should receive just wages; all roads  should be free; taxes, dues, and levies should be abolished; trading  capital was to be limited to a maximum of 10,000 _gulden_; all  surplus capital should fall to the Imperial authorities, who should  lend it in case of need to poor handicraftsmen at 5 per cent.;  uniformity of coinage and of weights and measures was to be decreed,  together with the abolition of the Roman and Canon law. Legists,  priests, and princes were to be severely dealt with. But, curiously  enough, the middle and lower nobility, especially the knighthood, were  more tenderly handled, being treated as themselves victims of their  feudal superiors, lay and ecclesiastic, especially the latter. In this  connection the secularization of ecclesiastical fiefs was strongly  insisted on.    As men found, however, that neither the Emperor Sigismund, nor the  Emperor Friedrich III, nor the Emperor Maximilian, upon each of whom  successively their hopes had been cast as the possible realization of  the German Messiah of earlier dreams, fulfilled their expectations,  nay, as each in succession implicitly belied these hopes, showing no  disposition whatever to act up to the views promulgated in their  names, the tradition of the Imperial deliverer gradually lost its  force and popularity. By the opening of the Lutheran Reformation the  opinion had become general that a change would not come from above,  but that the initiative must rest with the people themselves--with the  classes specially oppressed by existing conditions, political,  economic, and ecclesiastical--to effect by their own exertions such a  transformation as was shadowed forth in the spurious constitutions.  These, and similar ideas, were now everywhere taken up and elaborated,  often in a still more radical sense than the original; and they  everywhere found hearers and adherents.    The \"true inwardness\" of the change, of which the Protestant  Reformation represented the ideological side, meant the transformation  of society from a basis mainly corporative and co-operative to one  individualistic in its essential character. The whole polity of the  Middle Ages industrial, social, political, ecclesiastical, was based  on the principle of the group or the community--ranging in  hierarchical order from the trade-guild to the town corporation; from  the town corporation through the feudal orders to the Imperial throne  itself; from the single monastery to the order as a whole; and from  the order as a whole to the complete hierarchy of the Church as  represented by the papal chair. The principle of this social  organization was now breaking down. The modern and bourgeois  conception of the autonomy of the individual in all spheres of life  was beginning to affirm itself.    The most definite expression of this new principle asserted itself in  the religious sphere. The individualism which was inherent in early  Christianity, but which was present as a speculative content merely,  had not been strong enough to counteract even the remains of corporate  tendencies on the material side of things, in the decadent Roman  Empire; and infinitely less so the vigorous group-organization and  sentiment of the northern nations, with their tribal society and  communistic traditions still mainly intact. And these were the  elements out of which mediaeval society arose. Naturally enough the new  religious tendencies in revolt against the mediaeval corporate  Christianity of the Catholic Church seized upon this individualistic  element in Christianity, declaring the chief end of religion to be a  personal salvation, for the attainment of which the individual himself  was sufficing, apart from Church organization and Church tradition.  This served as a valuable destructive weapon for the iconoclasts in  their attack on ecclesiastical privilege; consequently, in religion,  this doctrine of Individualism rapidly made headway. But in more  material matters the old corporative instinct was still too strong and  the conditions were as yet too imperfectly ripe for the speedy triumph  of Individualism.    The conflict of the two tendencies is curiously exhibited in the popular  movements of the Reformation-time. As enemies of the decaying and  obstructive forms of Feudalism and Church organization, the peasant and  handicraftsman were necessarily on the side of the new Individualism. So  far as negation and destruction were concerned, they were working  apparently for the new order of things--that new order of things which  _longo intervallo_ has finally landed us in the developed capitalistic  Individualism of the twentieth century. Yet when we come to consider  their constructive programmes we find the positive demands put forward  are based either on ideal conceptions derived from reminiscences of  primitive communism, or else that they distinctly postulate a return to  a state of things--the old mark-organisation--upon which the later  feudalism had in various ways encroached, and finally superseded. Hence  they were, in these respects, not merely not in the trend of  contemporary progress, but in actual opposition to it; and therefore, as  Lassalle has justly remarked, they were necessarily and in any case  doomed to failure in the long run.    This point should not be lost sight of in considering the various  popular movements of the earlier half of the sixteenth century. The  world was still essentially mediaeval; men were still dominated by  mediaeval ways of looking at things and still immersed in mediaeval  conditions of life. It is true that out of this mediaeval soil the new  individualistic society was beginning to grow, but its manifestations  were as yet not so universally apparent as to force a recognition of  their real meaning. It was still possible to regard the various  symptoms of change, numerous as they were, and far-reaching as we now  see them to have been, as sporadic phenomena, as rank but unessential  overgrowths on the old society, which it was possible by pruning and  the application of other suitable remedies to get rid of, and thereby  to restore a state of pristine health in the body political and  social.    Biblical phrases and the notion of Divine Justice now took the place  in the popular mind formerly occupied by Church and Emperor. All the  then oppressed classes of society--the small peasant, half villein,  half free-man; the landless journeyman and town-proletarian; the  beggar by the wayside; the small master, crushed by usury or  tyrannized over by his wealthier colleague in the guild, or by the  town-patriciate; even the impoverished knight, or the soldier of  fortune defrauded of his pay; in short, all with whom times were bad,  found consolation for their wants and troubles, and at the same time  an incentive to action, in the notion of a Divine Justice which should  restore all things, and the advent of which was approaching. All had  Biblical phrases tending in the direction of their immediate  aspirations in their mouths.    As bearing on the development and propaganda of the new ideas, the  existence of a new intellectual class, rendered possible by the new  method of exchange through money (as opposed to that of barter), which  for a generation past had been in full swing in the larger towns, must  not be forgotten. Formerly land had been the essential condition of  livelihood; now it was no longer so. The \"universal equivalent,\"  money, conjoined with the printing press, was rendering a literary  class proper, for the first time, possible. In the same way the  teacher, physician, and the small lawyer were enabled to subsist as  followers of independent professions, apart from the special service  of the Church or as part of the court-retinue of some feudal  potentate. To these we must add a fresh and very important section of  the intellectual class which also now for the first time acquired an  independent existence--to wit, that of the public official or  functionary. This change, although only one of many, is itself  specially striking as indicating the transition from the barbaric  civilization of the Middle Ages to the beginnings of the civilization  of the modern world. We have, in short, before us, as already  remarked, a period in which the Middle Ages, whilst still dominant,  have their force visibly sapped by the growth of a new life.    To sum up the chief features of this new life: Industrially, "]]]
