Ek voel, as ek hier moedersiel        Alleen so by die vuurherd sit,      Wat jy nog vir ons nasie is--        En kyk, my hart kom weer in lid!        Ons nasie? ag, die mense praat:        Daar lê iets groots in woorde! Wat      Gee ons die reg om groot te wees,        Om saam te loop op so 'n pad?        Vir tagtig jare het hul hier        Gestruikel in die duister rond,      Die dyke oopgebreek, die see        Gemaak tot bobaas van die grond,        Die land gedoop met vuur en bloed,        Die klei vir elke huis deurwerk      Met trane: so 'n stad sal staan        Vir ewig--want die klei is sterk.        En elke duim van hierdie land        Is duur gekoop met suur en smart;      En elke morge is betaal        Met stukkies van 'n mensehart:        Dit gee hul reg om trots te wees,        Dit gee hul reg om nou te pronk,      Al is dit lank gelede al,        Al is die see weer in sy tronk.        En ons? ons wil 'n nasie wees!        Ook agter ons lê vuur en bloed;      Ook ons het vir ons land gestort        'n See van trane: ja, dis goed!        Maar verder--wat? 'n Nasie word        Nie somaar as die koring groot:      Dit moet deur werk, deur vlyt, deur smart,        Deur lewe ook word voortgestoot.        En as ek by die vuurherd sit        En in die vlamme kyk, dan voel      Ek in my siel, daar skort nog iets--        Nog iets? nog iets?--'n hele boel!        Daarbuite spook die wind weer hard;        Die vensters skudde: wat 'n nag!      Ou Amsterdam, ou Amsterdam,        Jy het nog oor my siel gesag!                  In die Boesmanland.          Vaal rotse rondom, met vaal sand en klei,        En boesmangras en varings, geel en groen--        Wat 'n mooi wêreld hierdie! mooi geboen      Deur die Natuur, en mooi ook deurgebrei      Met bossies en met blomme! Dis vir my,        Asof die son die wêreld self wil soen,        En ook die sterre daaraan mee wil doen      By nagtyd, as die veld sy sluier kry:      Hier was my tuiste in my woeste jaar,        Toe ek nog kind was, sonder pyn of vrees,           Want ou Paaiboelie self was toe te klein!      Al die rooi klippies het ek ingegaar,        En al die varings was vir my gewees           Maters, wat elke somer het verdwyn.                  Op die Kerkhof.        Eergister het ek na die plek gegaan,        Daar waar die aalwyn en die varkblom bloei,        Daar waar die doringboom nooit word gesnoei;      Waar elke leiklip as 'n grafsteen staan.      Dit was al laat, en om my het die maan        'n Silwerlig versprei, soos, as jy roei,        Die lang, blink sterre in die water groei.      Die kerkklok het strak agter my geslaan,      Ses, sewe, ag en neënuur, en nou        Was alles weer heel stil. Ek dag, ek hoor          Die aandgebed van elke mug en mot,      Wat in die maanlig kom vergaadring hou:        Hul sing en maak gegons, net soos 'n koor,          As lofsang aan 'n onbekende God.        As ek nou eenmaal sterwe, as ek is        'n Lyk, waarin geen asem en geen krag,        Met hande sonder voelte, sonder mag,      En met 'n oog, wat al sy glinstring mis--      As ek so lê, en self niks kan beslis,        Moet julle my nie uit die helder dag        Wegslinger in 'n eindelose nag,      Wat niks as my verwording vergewis;      Want ek wil nie tot duister kerkers keer,        Die noue graf vir ewig om my voel!          Verbrand my liewers, dat ek boontoe rys,      In vuur en vlam kan opklim tot die Heer,        Deur al die wêreld se rumoer en woel,          Tot oor die drimpel van die Paradys.                  In ou Booi se Pondok.        Outa Booi, die wind speel dapper,                  en dis bitter, bitter koud;      Kyk, daarbuite spoel die bliksem                  al die wolke geel met goud;      En jy bibber in jou bene,                  want jy is al baie oud.        Is daar plek, hier by jou vuurherd,                  waar 'n Kristenmens kan sit?      Gooi nog hout daar op die kole,                  want jou as is amper wit:      En die kou die gee jou sinkings,                  en dit trek jou been uit lid.        So! nou is ons lekker warm hier,                  Gee 'n kommetjie vir my      Vol met koffie uit die kan daar,                  outa, aan jou regtersy:      Ek hou baie van goei koffie--                  as ek dit maar nog kan kry.        Kom, vertel my uit die verte,                  toe jy nog 'n slafie was,      Toe die oubaas jou verkoop het                  vir twee perde en 'n kas--      Net soos jy nou self aan oubaas,                  vir sy looi, jou sakkie bas.        Was die mense toe so vroom al,                  as die mense is vandag?      Het die boere toe die swartvolk,                  soos 'n boerplaas maar verpag?      Het ons toe, soos nou, oor alles,                  wat belangryk is, gelag?        Was dit lekker in die dae?                  Was dit beter in die tyd?      Was die ounooi regtig ounooi                  vir haar jong en vir haar meid?      En die oubaas regtig oubaas?                  Was die wêreld al so wyd?        In die Kaap, daar lê 'n ketting--                  ja, dis oud, maar dis nog heel--      In 'n kamer, swart en donker,                  van die aaklig ou Kasteel,      Met 'n ring, wat vasgemaak was                  eertyds om 'n slaaf se keel.        Daar's 'n kats daar, en die plek nog,                  waar die galg gestaan het: ja,      Onse ouers het geweet, hoe                  om te martel en te pla,      Maar miskien ook baie beter,                  hoe om pyn en smart te dra.        Daar was reuse in die dae--                  ook al was die wêreld vaal,      En al het ook daar die duiwel                  in die donker rondgedwaal,      En so baie van die harte                  met sy nukkies opgesaal.        Daar was liefde toe, kennis--                  skoon ons nou daarmee so spot--      Elke man was groot genoeg toe                  vir sy eie siel en lot,      En ek glo nie, as 'n nasie                  was ons mense toe so vrot!        Ja, ek weet ons het gely toe--                  daar is altyd rou en pyn!      Laat jou grootste vat maar ope,                  met jou beste, soetste wyn:      Proe dit oor 'n maand, en waarlik,                  dit is amper nes asyn!        Kom daar ooit 'n kind ter wêreld,                  groei hy op en word hy droog,      Sonder dat hy ooit sy trane                  het moet wegveeg uit sy oog?      Ja, jy maak ook nie rosyntjies,                  wat sal goed bly sonder loog.        As 'n mens met vuur en vlamme                  tot sy gorrel volgeprop,      Met 'n hoop op seker uitkoms,                  waar sy hart van helder klop,      By die vuurherd sit te luister,                  op wat omgaan in sy kop,        Sonder bang te worde, sonder                  op sy hoop te struikel--staan      Penorent, kordaat en wakker,                  as die wêreld ook vergaan,      En die son word donker, duister,                  en nog donkerder die maan--        As 'n mens met ideale                  elke keer sy ideaal      Sien verbygaan voor sy oë,                  nes 'n ster, wat skiet en straal      Vir 'n oomblik in die hemel                  en dan in die see verdwaal,        Sonder vrees, vir wat sal worde,                  as die nag nog langer duur,      As die wind nog kouer warrel,                  en die naglug trek so guur,      As die lewe skyn so bitter,                  en die toekoms lyk so suur,        Sien hy nooit nie in die vuurherd,                  wat is groot en wat is klein--      Nooit tevrede met die toekoms,                  nooit versadig met die wyn,      Want die suiker is te suinig,                  en die drank smaak soos asyn.        Tog--daar is 'n toekoms altyd:                  waar vandag is opgeslaan,      Daar op Golgotha, die kruise,                  sal die mense môre staan      Rond die heiligdom van helde,                  wat alléén is voorgegaan.        Waar ons nou net bitter trane,                  klagte, sugte, smart gewaar--      Waar die koringvelde kaal staan,                  en die droogte druk so swaar,      Wys die toekoms diamante                  en die koring in die aar.        Jy was ketter nog eergister,                  en vanmôre is jy vroom!--      Laat vanaand se melk maar stil staan,                  môre kry jy tog die room!      Slaap gerus maar, slaap gerus maar,                  ja, hoe swaar ook is jou droom!        Jy was sondaar in jou sede--                  elke woord het jou gekwets:      Vir die een was jy te nuut al,                  vir die ander ouderwets!      Op jou siel is al jou smarte                  met jou lewenssuur geëts.        Jy was vyand vir jou vrinde:                  elke kêrel op die straat      Het 'n broederlik berisping                  op jou wandel afgepraat.      En die aakligste van almal,                  en die kwaaiste was--jou maat!        Ja, jou vader was 'n Boesman:                  en die volkies is nie mooi,      Met 'n agterste, wat uitloop                  as 'n afgesakte kooi;      En jyself is nie te ekstra                  as 'n spoghings, outa Booi!        Het hy ook 'n hart besit toe                  soos 'n witmens, en 'n stem?      Was dit koddig, as hy sanik                  soos 'n strandmol in die klem,      Of 'n wawiel op die hoogte,                  wat geskraap word deur die rem?        Hy was mens--miskien 'n reus ook,                  want 'n siel is nie so klein      As 'n vlees-en-bene liggaam,                  ook al is dit nog so fyn:      Ag, 'n liggaam dra maar laste,                  en 'n siel die dra mos pyn!        Wat is van jou pa geworde?                  As hy reus was, is hy nog;      As hy dwergie was--soos ons nou--                  ja, dan was hy maar 'n bog.      Hy was Boesman, skelm en deugniet--                  ja,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19734"],[0,"The Fairy Book (#7)"],[1,"door  in the wall, where was a closet with silver and gold cups and dishes  and other vessels, and baskets filled with ducats, and boxes of jewels  and precious stones. There were also charming pictures, and the most  delightful story-books he had seen in the whole course of his life.    John spent the morning looking at these things; and, when it was  mid-day, a bell rung, and his servant said, \"Will you dine alone, sir,  or with the large company?\"    \"With the large company, to be sure,\" replied John. So his servant led  him out. John, however, saw nothing but solitary halls, lighted up  with precious stones, and here and there little men and women, who  appeared to him to glide out of the clefts and fissures of the rocks.  Wondering what it was the bells rang for, he said to his servant--\"But  where is the company?\" And scarcely had he spoken when the hall they  were in opened out to a great extent, and a canopy set with diamonds  and precious stones was drawn over it. At the same moment he saw an  immense throng of nicely dressed little men and women pouring in  through several open doors: the floor opened in several places, and  tables, covered with the most beautiful ware, and the most luscious  meats, and fruits, and wines, arranged themselves in rows, and the  chairs arranged themselves along beside the tables, and then the men  and women took their seats.    The principal persons now came forward, bowed to John, and led him to  their table, where they placed him among their most beautiful maidens,  a distinction which pleased John well. The party too was very merry,  for the underground people are extremely lively and cheerful, and can  never stay long quiet. Then the most charming music sounded over their  heads; and beautiful birds, flying about, sung sweetly: these were not  real but artificial birds, which the little men make so ingeniously  that they can fly about and sing like natural ones.    The servants of both sexes, who waited at table, and handed about the  gold cups, and the silver and crystal baskets with fruit, were mortal  children, whom some misfortune had thrown among the underground  people, and who, having come down without securing any pledge, such as  John's cap, had fallen into their power. These were differently clad  from their masters. The boys and girls were dressed in snow-white  coats and jackets, and wore glass shoes, so thin that their steps  could never be heard, with blue caps on their heads, and silver belts  round their waists.    John at first pitied them, seeing how they were forced to run about  and wait on the little people; but as they looked cheerful and happy,  and were handsomely dressed, and had such rosy cheeks, he said to  himself--\"After all, they are not so badly off, and I was myself much  worse when I had to be running after the cows and bullocks. To be  sure, I am now a master here, and they are servants; but there is no  help for it: why were they so foolish as to let themselves be taken  and not get some pledge beforehand? At any rate, the time must come  when they shall be set at liberty, and they will certainly not be  longer than fifty years here.\" With these thoughts he consoled  himself, and sported and played away with his little playfellows, and  ate, and drank, and made his servant and the others tell him stories,  for he always liked to hear something strange, and to get to the  bottom of everything.    They sat at table about two hours: the principal person then rang a  little bell, and the tables and chairs all vanished in a whiff,  leaving the company standing on their feet. The birds now struck up a  most lively air, and the little people began to dance, jumping and  leaping and whirling round and round, as if the world were grown  dizzy. And the pretty little girls that sat next John caught hold of  him and whirled him about; and, without making any resistance, he  danced with them for two good hours. Every afternoon while he remained  there he used to do the same; and, to the last hour of his life, he  always spoke of it with the greatest glee.    When the music and dancing were over, it might be about four o'clock.  The little people then disappeared, and went each about their work or  their pleasure. After supper they sported and danced in the same way;  and at midnight, especially on starlight nights, they slipped out of  their hills to dance in the open air. John used then, like a good boy,  to say his prayers and go to sleep, a duty he never neglected either  in the evening or in the morning.    For the first week that John was in the glass-hill he only went from  his chamber to the great hall and back again. After then, however, he  began to walk about, making his servant show and explain everything to  him. He found that there were here most beautiful walks, in which he  might ramble along for miles, in all directions, without ever finding  an end of them, so immensely large was the hill that the little people  lived in, and yet outwardly it seemed but a little hill, with a few  bushes and trees growing on it.    He found also meadows and lanes, islands and lakes, where the birds  sang sweeter, and the flowers were more brilliant and fragrant than  anything he had ever seen on earth. There was a breeze, and yet one  did not feel the wind; it was quite clear and bright, but there was no  heat; the waves were dashing, still there was no danger; and the most  beautiful little barks and canoes came, like white swans, when one  wanted to cross the water, and went backwards and forwards of their  own accord. Whence all this came nobody knew, nor could his servant  tell anything about it.    These lovely meads and plains were, for the most part, all solitary.  Few of the underground people were to be seen upon them, and those  that were just glided across them, as if in the greatest hurry. It  very rarely happened that any of them danced out here in the open air;  sometimes about three of them did so; at the most half a dozen: John  never saw a greater number together. The meadows never seemed  cheerful, except when the earth-children, who were kept as servants,  were let out to walk. This, however, happened but twice a week, for  they were mostly kept employed in the great hall and adjoining  apartments, or at school.    For John soon found they had schools there also; he had been there  about ten months, when one day he saw something snow-white gliding  into a rock, and disappearing. \"What!\" said he to his servant, \"are  there some of you too that wear white, like the servants?\" He was  informed that there were; but they were few in number, and never  appeared at the large tables or the dances, except once a year, on the  birthday of the great Hill-king, who dwelt many thousand miles below  in the great deep. These were the oldest men among them, some being  many thousand years old; they knew all things, and could tell of the  beginning of the world, and were called the Wise. They lived all  alone, and only left their chambers to instruct the underground  children and the attendants of both sexes.    John was greatly interested by this news, and he determined to take  advantage of it: so next morning he made his servant conduct him to  the school, and was so well pleased with it that he never missed a  day. The scholars were taught reading, writing, and accounts, to  compose and relate histories and stories, and many elegant kinds of  work; so that many came out of the hills very prudent and learned. The  biggest, and those of best capacity, received instruction in natural  science and astronomy, and in poetry and riddle-making, arts highly  esteemed by the little people. John was very diligent, and soon became  a clever painter; he wrought, too, most ingeniously in gold, and  silver, and stones; and in verse and riddle-making he had no fellow.    John had spent many a happy year here without ever thinking of the  upper world, or of those he had left behind, so pleasantly passed the  time--so many an agreeable playfellow had he among the children.    Of all his playfellows there was none of whom he was so fond as of a  little fair-haired girl, named Elizabeth Krabbin. She was from his own  village, and was the daughter of Frederick Krabbe, the minister of  Rambin. She was but four years old when she was taken away, and John  had often heard tell of her. She was not, however, stolen by the  little people, but came into their power in this manner. One day in  summer, she, with other children, ran out into the fields: in their  rambles they went to the Nine-hills, where little Elizabeth fell  asleep, and was forgotten by the rest. At night, when she awoke, she  found herself under the ground among the little people. It was not  merely because she was from his own village that John was so fond of  Elizabeth, but she was a most beautiful child, with clear blue eyes  and ringlets of fair hair, and a most angelic smile.    Time flew away unperceived: John was now eighteen, and Elizabeth  sixteen. Their childish fondness was now become love, and the little  people were pleased to see it, thinking that by means of her they  might get John to renounce his power, and become their servant; for  they were fond of him, and would willingly have had him to wait upon  them; the love of dominion is their vice. But they were mistaken; John  had learned too much from his servant to be caught in that way.    John's chief delight was walking about alone with Elizabeth; for he  now knew every place so well that he could dispense with the  attendance of his servant. In these rambles he was always gay and  lively, but his companion was frequently sad and melancholy, thinking  of the land above, where men lived, and where the sun, moon, and stars  shine. Now it happened in one of their walks, that as they talked of  their love, and it was after midnight, they passed under the place  where the tops of the glass hills used to open and let the underground  "]]]
