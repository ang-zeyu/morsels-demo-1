But (c) there are also Real Propositions, whose predicates do not mean  the same as their subjects, and whose import consists in affirming or  denying one of five different kinds of matter of fact: (1) That the  subject exists, or does not; as if we say _The bison exists_, _The great  auk is extinct_. (2) Co-existence, as _Man is mortal_; that is, _the  being subject to death coinheres with the qualities on account of which  we call certain objects men_. (3) Succession, as _Night follows day_.  (4) Causation (a particular kind of Succession), as _Water rusts iron_.  (5) Resemblance, as _The colour of this geranium is like that of a  soldier's coat_, or _A = B_.    On comparing this list of real predications with the list of logical  relations given above (chap. i. Sec. 5 (a)), it will be seen that the two  differ only in this, that I have there omitted simple Existence. Nothing  simply exists, unrelated either in Nature or in knowledge. Such a  proposition as _The bison exists_ may, no doubt, be used in Logic  (subject to interpretation) for the sake of custom or for the sake of  brevity; but it means that some specimens are still to be found in N.  America, or in Zoological gardens.    Controversy as to the Import of Propositions really turns upon a  difference of opinion as to the scope of Logic and the foundations of  knowledge. Mill was dissatisfied with the \"congruity\" of concepts as the  basis of a judgment. Clearly, mere congruity does not justify belief. In  the proposition _Water rusts iron_, the concepts _water_, _rust_ and  _iron_ may be congruous, but does any one assert their connection on  that ground? In the proposition _Murderers are haunted by the ghosts of  their victims_, the concepts _victim_, _murderer_, _ghost_ have a high  degree of congruity; yet, unfortunately, I cannot believe it: there  seems to be no such cheap defence of innocence. Now, Mill held that  Logic is concerned with the grounds of belief, and that the scope of  Logic includes Induction as well as Deduction; whereas, according to  Hamilton, Induction is only Modified Logic, a mere appendix to the  theory of the \"forms of thought as thought.\" Indeed, Mill endeavoured in  his _Logic_ to probe the grounds of belief deeper than usual, and  introduced a good deal of Metaphysics--either too much or not  enough--concerning the ground of axioms. But, at any rate, his great  point was that belief, and therefore (for the most part) the Real  Proposition, is concerned not merely with the relations of words, or  even of ideas, but with matters of fact; that is, both propositions and  judgments point to something further, to the relations of things which  we can examine, not merely by thinking about them (comparing them in  thought), but by observing them with the united powers of thought and  perception. This is what convinces us that _water rusts iron_: and the  difficulty of doing this is what prevents our feeling sure that  _murderers are haunted by the ghosts of their victims_. Hence, although  Mill's definition of a proposition, given above, is adequate for  propositions in general; yet that kind of proposition (the Real) with  regard to which Logic (in Mill's view) investigates the conditions of  proof, may be more explicitly and pertinently defined as 'a predication  concerning the relation of matters of fact.'    Sec. 5. This leads to a very important distinction to which we shall often  have to refer in subsequent pages--namely, the distinction between the  Form and the Matter of a proposition or of an argument. The distinction  between Form and Matter, as it is ordinarily employed, is easily  understood. An apple growing in the orchard and a waxen apple on the  table may have the same shape or form, but they consist of different  materials; two real apples may have the same shape, but contain distinct  ounces of apple-stuff, so that after one is eaten the other remains to  be eaten. Similarly, tables may have the same shape, though one be made  of marble, another of oak, another of iron. The form is common to  several things, the matter is peculiar to each. Metaphysicians have  carried the distinction further: apples, they say, may have not only the  same outward shape, but the same inward constitution, which, therefore,  may be called the Form of apple-stuff itself--namely, a certain  pulpiness, juiciness, sweetness, etc.; qualities common to all dessert  apples: yet their Matter is different, one being here, another  there--differing in place or time, if in nothing else. The definition of  a species is the form of every specimen of it.    To apply this distinction to the things of Logic: it is easy to see how  two propositions may have the same Form but different Matter: not using  'Form' in the sense of 'shape,' but for that which is common to many  things, in contrast with that which is peculiar to each. Thus, _All male  lions are tawny_ and _All water is liquid at 50 deg. Fahrenheit_, are two  propositions that have the same form, though their matter is entirely  different. They both predicate something of the whole of their subjects,  though their subjects are different, and so are the things predicated of  them. Again, _All male lions have tufted tails_ and _All male lions have  manes_, are two propositions having the same form and, in their  subjects, the same matter, but different matter in their predicates. If,  however, we take two such propositions as these: _All male lions have  manes_ and _Some male lions have manes_, here the matter is the same in  both, but the form is different--in the first, predication is made  concerning _every_ male lion; in the second of only _some_ male lions;  the first is _universal_, the second is _particular_. Or, again, if we  take _Some tigers are man-eaters_ and _Some tigers are not man-eaters_,  here too the matter is the same, but the form is different; for the  first proposition is _affirmative_, whilst the second is _negative_.    Sec. 6. Now, according to Hamilton and Whately, pure Logic has to do only  with the Form of propositions and arguments. As to their Matter, whether  they are really true in fact, that is a question, they said, not for  Logic, but for experience, or for the special sciences. But Mill desired  so to extend logical method as to test the material truth of  propositions: he thought that he could expound a method by which  experience itself and the conclusions of the special sciences may be  examined.    To this method it may be objected, that the claim to determine Material  Truth takes for granted that the order of Nature will remain unchanged,  that (for example) water not only at present is a liquid at 50 deg.  Fahrenheit, but will always be so; whereas (although we have no reason  to expect such a thing) the order of Nature may alter--it is at least  supposable--and in that event water may freeze at such a temperature.  Any matter of fact, again, must depend on observation, either directly,  or by inference--as when something is asserted about atoms or ether. But  observation and material inference are subject to the limitations of our  faculties; and however we may aid observation by microscopes and  micrometers, it is still observation; and however we may correct our  observations by repetition, comparison and refined mathematical methods  of making allowances, the correction of error is only an approximation  to accuracy. Outside of Formal Reasoning, suspense of judgment is your  only attitude.    But such objections imply that nothing short of absolute truth has any  value; that all our discussions and investigations in science or social  affairs are without logical criteria; that Logic must be confined to  symbols, and considered entirely as mental gymnastics. In this book  prominence will be given to the character of Logic as a formal science,  and it will also be shown that Induction itself may be treated formally;  but it will be assumed that logical forms are valuable as representing  the actual relations of natural and social phenomena.    Sec. 7. Symbols are often used in Logic instead of concrete terms, not only  in Symbolic Logic where the science is treated algebraically (as by Dr.  Venn in his _Symbolic Logic_), but in ordinary manuals; so that it may  be well to explain the use of them before going further.    It is a common and convenient practice to illustrate logical doctrines  by examples: to show what is meant by a Proposition we may give _salt is  soluble_, or _water rusts iron:_ the copulative exponible is exemplified  by _salt is savoury and wholesome_; and so on. But this procedure has  some disadvantages: it is often cumbrous; and it may distract the  reader's attention from the point to be explained by exciting his  interest in the special fact of the illustration. Clearly, too, so far  as Logic is formal, no particular matter of fact can adequately  illustrate any of its doctrines. Accordingly, writers on Logic employ  letters of the alphabet instead of concrete terms, (say) _X_ instead of  _salt_ or instead of _iron_, and (say) _Y_ instead of _soluble_ or  instead of _rusted by water_; and then a proposition may be represented  by _X is Y_. It is still more usual to represent a proposition by _S is  (or is not) P, S_ being the initial of Subject and _P_ of Predicate;  though this has the drawback that if we argue--_S is P_, therefore _P is  S_, the symbols in the latter proposition no longer have the same  significance, since the former subject is now the predicate.    Again, negative terms frequently occur in Logic, such as _not-water_, or  _not-iron_, and then if _water_ or _iron_ be expressed by _X_, the  corresponding negative may be expressed by _x_; or, generally, if a  capital letter stand for a positive term, the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18444"],[0,"The Story of the Hymns and Tunes (#7)"],[1,"which placed  him among the foremost in that class of music. Invited to England, he  received the Doctor's degree at Oxford, and composed his great oratorio  of \"The Creation,\" besides his \"Twelve Grand Symphonies,\" and a long  list of minor musical works secular and sacred. His invention was  inexhaustible.    Haydn seems to have been a sincerely pious man. When writing his great  oratorio of \"The Creation\" at sixty-seven years of age, \"I knelt down  every day,\" he says, \"and prayed God to strengthen me for my work.\" This  daily spiritual preparation was similar to Handel's when he was creating  his \"Messiah.\" Change one word and it may be said of sacred music as  truly as of astronomy, \"The undevout composer is mad.\"    Near Haydn's death, in Vienna, 1809, when he heard for the last time his  magnificent chorus, \"Let there be Light!\" he exclaimed, \"Not mine, not  mine. It all came to me from above.\"      \"NOW TO THE LORD A NOBLE SONG.\"    When Watts finished this hymn he had achieved a \"noble song,\" whether he  was conscious of it or not; and it deserves a foremost place, where it  can help future worshippers in their praise as it has the past. It is  not so common in the later hymnals, but it is imperishable, and still  later collections will not forget it.        Now to the Lord a noble song,      Awake my soul, awake my tongue!      Hosanna to the Eternal Name,      And all His boundless love proclaim.        See where it shines in Jesus' face,      The brightest image of His grace!      God in the person of His Son      Has all His mightiest works outdone.    A rather finical question has occurred to some minds as to the theology  of the word \"works\" in the last line, making the second person in the  Godhead apparently a creature; and in a few hymn-books the previous line  has been made to read--        God in the _Gospel_ of His Son.    But the question is a rhetorical one, and the poet's free  expression--here as in hundreds of other cases--has never disturbed the  general confidence in his orthodoxy.    Montgomery called Watts \"the inventor of hymns in our language,\" and the  credit stands practically undisputed, for Watts made a hymn style that  no human master taught him, and his model has been the ideal one for  song worship ever since; and we can pardon the climax when Professor  Charles M. Stuart speaks of him as \"writer, scholar, thinker and saint,\"  for in addition to all the rest he was a very good man.      _THE TUNE._    Old \"Ames\" was for many years the choir favorite, and the words of the  hymn printed with it in the note-book made the association familiar. It  was, and _is_, an appropriate selection, though in later manuals George  Kingsley's \"Ware\" is evidently thought to be better suited to the  high-toned verse. Good old tunes never \"wear out,\" but they do go out of  fashion.    The composer of \"Ames,\" Sigismund Neukomm, Chevalier, was born in  Salzburg, Austria, July 10, 1778, and was a pupil of Haydn. Though not a  great genius, his talents procured him access and even intimacy in the  courts of Germany, France, Italy, Portugal and England, and for thirty  years he composed church anthems and oratorios with prodigious industry.  Neukomm's musical productions, numbering no less than one thousand, and  popular in their day, are, however, mostly forgotten, excepting his  oratorio of \"David\" and one or two hymn-tunes.    George Kingsley, author of \"Ware,\" was born in Northampton, Mass., July  7, 1811. Died in the Hospital, in the same city, March 14, 1884. He  compiled eight books of music for young people and several manuals of  church psalmody, and was for some time a music teacher in Boston, where  he played the organ at the Hollis St. church. Subsequently he became  professor of music in Girard College, Philadelphia, and music instructor  in the public schools, being employed successively as organist (on  Lord's Day) at Dr. Albert Barnes' and Arch St. churches, and finally in  Brooklyn at Dr. Storrs' Church of the Pilgrims. Returned to Northampton,  1853.      \"EARLY, MY GOD, WITHOUT DELAY.\"    This and the five following hymns, all by Watts, are placed in immediate  succession, for unity's sake--with a fuller notice of the greatest of  hymn-writers at the end of the series.        Early, my God, without delay        I haste to seek Thy face,      My thirsty spirit faints away        Without Thy cheering grace.    In the memories of very old men and women, who sang the fugue music of  Morgan's \"Montgomery,\" still lingers the second stanza and some of the  \"spirit and understanding\" with which it used to be rendered in meeting  on Sunday mornings.        So pilgrims on the scorching sand,        Beneath a burning sky,      Long for a cooling stream at hand        And they must drink or die.      _THE TUNE._    Many of the earlier pieces assigned to this hymn were either too noisy  or too tame. The best and longest-serving is \"Lanesboro,\" which, with  its expressive duet in the middle and its soaring final strain of  harmony, never fails to carry the meaning of the words. It was composed  by William Dixon, and arranged and adapted by Lowell Mason.    William Dixon, an English composer, was a music engraver and publisher,  and author also of several glees and anthems. He was born 1750, and died  about 1825.    Lowell Mason, born in Medfield, Mass., 1792, has been called, not  without reason, \"the father of American choir singing.\" Returning from  Savannah, Ga., where he spent sixteen years of his younger life as clerk  in a bank, he located in Boston (1827), being already known there as the  composer of \"The Missionary Hymn.\" He had not neglected his musical  studies while living in the South, and it was in Savannah that he made  the glorious harmony of that tune.    He became president of the Handel and Haydn Society, went abroad for  special study, was made Doctor of Music, and collected a store of themes  among the great models of song to bring home for his future work.    The Boston Academy of Music was founded by him and what he did for the  song-service of the Church in America by his singing schools, and  musical conventions, and published manuals, to form and organize the  choral branch of divine worship, has no parallel, unless it is Noah  Webster's service to the English language.    Dr. Mason died in Orange, N.J., in 1872.      \"SWEET IS THE WORK, MY GOD, MY KING.\"    This is one of the hymns that helped to give its author the title of  \"The Seraphic Watts.\"        Sweet is the work, my God, my King      To praise Thy name, give thanks and sing      To show Thy love by morning light,      And talk of all Thy truth at night.      _THE TUNE._    No nobler one, and more akin in spirit to the hymn, can be found than  \"Duke Street,\" Hatton's imperishable choral.    Little is known of the John Hatton who wrote \"Duke St.\" He was earlier  by nearly a century than John Liphot Hatton of Liverpool (born in 1809),  who wrote the opera of \"Pascal Bruno,\" the cantata of \"Robin Hood\" and  the sacred drama of \"Hezekiah.\" The biographical index of the  _Evangelical Hymnal_ says of John Hatton, the author of \"Duke St.\":  \"John, of Warrington; afterwards of St. Helens, then resident in Duke  St. in the township of Windle; composed several hymn-tunes; died in  1793.[5] His funeral sermon was preached at the Presbyterian Chapel, St.  Helens, Dec. 13.\"    [Footnote 5: Tradition says he was killed by being thrown from a  stage-coach.]      \"COME, WE THAT LOVE THE LORD.\"    Watts entitled this hymn \"Heavenly Joy on Earth.\" He could possibly,  like Madame Guyon, have written such a hymn in a dungeon, but it is no  less spiritual for its birth (as tradition will have it) amid the lovely  scenery of Southampton where he could find in nature \"glory begun  below.\"        Come, we that love the Lord,        And let our joys be known;      Join in a song with sweet accord,        And thus surround the throne.        There shall we see His face,        And never, never sin;      There, from the rivers of His grace,        Drink endless pleasures in.        Children of grace have found        Glory begun below:      Celestial fruits on earthly ground        From faith and hope may grow.    Mortality and immortality blend their charms in the next stanza. The  unfailing beauty of the vision will be dwelt upon with delight so long  as Christians sing on earth.        The hill of Sion yields        A thousand sacred sweets,      Before we reach the heavenly fields,        Or walk the golden streets.      _THE TUNE._    \"St. Thomas\" has often been the interpreter of the hymn, and still  clings to the words in the memory of thousands.    The Italian tune of \"Ain\" has more music. It is a fugue piece  (simplified in some tune-books), and the joyful traverse of its notes  along the staff in four-four time, with the momentum of a good choir, is  exhilarating in the extreme.    Corelli, the composer, was a master violinist, the greatest of his day,  and wrote a great deal of violin music; and the thought of his glad  instrument may have influenced his work when harmonizing the four voices  of \"Ain.\"    Arcangelo Corelli was born at Fusignano, in 1653. He was a sensitive  artist, and although faultless in Italian music, he was not sure of  himself in playing French scores, and once while performing with Handel  (who resented the slightest error), and once again with Scarlatti,  leading an orchestra in Naples when the king was present, he made a  mortifying mistake. He took the humiliation so much to heart that he  brooded over it till he died, in Rome, Jan. 18, 1717.    For revival meetings the modern tune set to \"Come we that love the  Lord,\" by Robert Lowry, should be mentioned. A shouting chorus is  appended to it, but it has melody and plenty of stimulating motion.    The Rev. Robert Lowry was born in Philadelphia, March 12, 1826, and  educated at Lewisburg, Pa.
