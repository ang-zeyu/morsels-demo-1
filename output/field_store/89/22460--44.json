Now without expressing any opinion as to the  truth or falsehood of the views implied by such applications of the name  of God, I cannot but regard them all as illegitimate extensions of the  term, in short as an abuse of language, and I venture to protest against  it in the interest not only of verbal accuracy but of clear thinking,  because it is apt to conceal from ourselves and others a real and very  important change of thought: in particular it may lead many to imagine  that the persons who use the name of God in one or other of these  extended senses retain certain theological opinions which they may in  fact have long abandoned. Thus the misuse of the name of God may  resemble the stratagem in war of putting up dummies to make an enemy  imagine that a fort is still held after it has been evacuated by the  garrison. I am far from alleging or insinuating that the illegitimate  extension of the divine name is deliberately employed by theologians or  others for the purpose of masking a change of front; but that it may  have that effect seems at least possible. And as we cannot use words in  wrong senses without running a serious risk of deceiving ourselves as  well as others, it appears better on all accounts to adhere strictly to  the common meaning of the name of God as signifying a powerful  supernatural and on the whole beneficent spirit, akin in nature to man;  and if any of us have ceased to believe in such a being we should  refrain from applying the old word to the new faith, and should find  some other and more appropriate term to express our meaning. At all  events, speaking for myself, I intend to use the name of God  consistently in the familiar sense, and I would beg my hearers to bear  this steadily in mind.    [Sidenote: Monotheism and polytheism.]    You will have observed that I have spoken of natural theology as a  reasoned knowledge of a God or gods. There is indeed nothing in the  definition of God which I have adopted to imply that he is unique, in  other words, that there is only one God rather than several or many  gods. It is true that modern European thinkers, bred in a monotheistic  religion, commonly overlook polytheism as a crude theory unworthy the  serious attention of philosophers; in short, the champions and the  assailants of religion in Europe alike for the most part tacitly assume  that there is either one God or none. Yet some highly civilised nations  of antiquity and of modern times, such as the ancient Egyptians, Greeks,  and Romans, and the modern Chinese and Hindoos, have accepted the  polytheistic explanation of the world, and as no reasonable man will  deny the philosophical subtlety of the Greeks and the Hindoos, to say  nothing of the rest, a theory of the universe which has commended itself  to them deserves perhaps more consideration than it has commonly  received from Western philosophers; certainly it cannot be ignored in an  historical enquiry into the origin of religion.    [Sidenote: A natural knowledge of God can only be acquired by  experience.]    If there is such a thing as natural theology, that is, a knowledge of a  God or gods acquired by our natural faculties alone without the aid of a  special revelation, it follows that it must be obtained by one or other  of the methods by which all our natural knowledge is conveyed to us.  Roughly speaking, these methods are two in number, namely, intuition and  experience. Now if we ask ourselves, Do we know God intuitively in the  same sense in which we know intuitively our own sensations and the  simplest truths of mathematics, I think most men will acknowledge that  they do not. It is true that according to Berkeley the world exists only  as it is perceived, and that our perceptions of it are produced by the  immediate action of God on our minds, so that everything we perceive  might be described, if not as an idea in the mind of the deity, at least  as a direct emanation from him. On this theory we might in a sense be  said to have an immediate knowledge of God. But Berkeley's theory has  found little acceptance, so far as I know, even among philosophers; and  even if we regarded it as true, we should still have to admit that the  knowledge of God implied by it is inferential rather than intuitive in  the strict sense of the word: we infer God to be the cause of our  perceptions rather than identify him with the perceptions themselves. On  the whole, then, I conclude that man, or at all events the ordinary man,  has, properly speaking, no immediate or intuitive knowledge of God, and  that, if he obtains, without the aid of revelation, any knowledge of him  at all, it can only be through the other natural channel of knowledge,  that is, through experience.    [Sidenote: The nature of experience.]    In experience, as distinct from intuition, we reach our conclusions not  directly through simple contemplation of the particular sensations,  emotions, or ideas of which we are at the moment conscious, but  indirectly by calling up before the imagination and comparing with each  other our memories of a variety of sensations, emotions, or ideas of  which we have been conscious in the past, and by selecting or  abstracting from the mental images so compared the points in which they  resemble each other. The points of resemblance thus selected or  abstracted from a number of particulars compose what we call an abstract  or general idea, and from a comparison of such abstract or general ideas  with each other we arrive at general conclusions, which define the  relations of the ideas to each other. Experience in general consists in  the whole body of conclusions thus deduced from a comparison of all the  particular sensations, emotions, and ideas which make up the conscious  life of the individual. Hence in order to constitute experience the mind  has to perform a more or less complex series of operations, which are  commonly referred to certain mental faculties, such as memory,  imagination, and judgment. This analysis of experience does not pretend  to be philosophically complete or exact; but perhaps it is sufficiently  accurate for the purpose of these lectures, the scope of which is not  philosophical but historical.    [Sidenote: Two kinds of experience, the experience of our own mind and  the experience of an external world.]    Now experience in the widest sense of the word may be conveniently  distinguished into two sorts, the experience of our own mind and the  experience of an external world. The distinction is indeed, like the  others with which I am dealing at present, rather practically useful  than theoretically sound; certainly it would not be granted by all  philosophers, for many of them have held that we neither have nor with  our present faculties can possibly attain to any immediate knowledge or  perception of an external world, we merely infer its existence from our  own sensations, which are as strictly a part of our mind as the ideas  and emotions of our waking life or the visions of sleep. According to  them, the existence of matter or of an external world is, so far as we  are concerned, merely an hypothesis devised to explain the order of our  sensations; it never has been perceived by any man, woman, or child who  ever lived on earth; we have and can have no immediate knowledge or  perception of anything but the states and operations of our own mind. On  this theory what we call the world, with all its supposed infinitudes of  space and time, its systems of suns and planets, its seemingly endless  forms of inorganic matter and organic life, shrivels up, on a close  inspection, into a fleeting, a momentary figment of thought. It is like  one of those glass baubles, iridescent with a thousand varied and  delicate hues, which a single touch suffices to shatter into dust. The  philosopher, like the sorcerer, has but to wave his magic wand,      \"And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,    The cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palaces,    The solemn temples, the great globe itself,    Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve    And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,    Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff    As dreams are made on, and our little life    Is rounded with a sleep.\"    [Sidenote: The distinction rather popular and convenient than  philosophically strict.]    It would be beyond my province, even if it were within my power, to  discuss these airy speculations, and thereby to descend into the arena  where for ages subtle dialecticians have battled with each other over  the reality or unreality of an external world. For my purpose it  suffices to adopt the popular and convenient distinction of mind and  matter and hence to divide experience into two sorts, an inward  experience of the acts and states of our own minds, and an outward  experience of the acts and states of that physical universe by which we  seem to be surrounded.    [Sidenote: The knowledge or conception of God has been attained both by  inward and by outward experience.]    Now if a natural knowledge of God is only possible by means of  experience, in other words, by a process of reasoning based on  observation, it will follow that such a knowledge may conceivably be  acquired either by the way of inward or of outward experience; in other  words, it may be attained either by reflecting on the processes of our  own minds or by observing the processes of external nature. In point of  fact, if we survey the history of thought, mankind appears to have  arrived at a knowledge, or at all events at a conception, of deity by  both these roads.
