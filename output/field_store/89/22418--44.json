The span of Bays were sisters, so of course  their children were cousins, and they were all very fond of each other  and of the Blind Horse, who was the uncle of the Bays and the  great-uncle of the Bay Colt and the Gray Colt.    \"I am worried about the Bay Colt,\" said his mother. \"Since he was  brought into the barn last fall and had a stall away from me, he has  gotten into bad ways. I have told him again and again that he must not  nibble the edge of the manger, yet the first thing I heard this morning  was the grating of his teeth on the wood.\"    \"Well,\" said his aunt, \"you know he is teething, and that may be the  reason.\"    \"That is no excuse,\" said his mother sternly. \"He has been teething ever  since he was five days old, and he will not cut his last tooth for three  years yet. I don't call it goodness to keep from cribbing when you don't  want to crib, and the time to stop is now. Besides, if he waits until he  has all his teeth, he won't be able to break himself of the habit when  he does try.\"    \"That is so,\" said his aunt, \"and he will ruin his teeth, too.\"    \"Pooh!\" exclaimed the Bay Colt, who had heard what they were saying. \"I  can stop whenever I want to, and they're my own teeth, anyway. It isn't  anybody else's business if I do ruin them.\"    \"There!\" said his mother to his aunt, \"you see what I mean. That is just  the way he talks all the time. Now what would you do?\"    \"Let him alone,\" snorted the Dappled Gray. \"Let him alone, and he will  get some Horse sense after he has been broken. He'll have a hard time of  it, but he'll come out all right.\"    The Bay Colt kicked against the side of the stall, he was so vexed.  \"I'll thank you to let me alone,\" said he. \"I don't see why everybody  tells me what I ought to do. Guess I know a thing or two.\"    \"I'll tell you why,\" said the Dappled Gray, in a voice that sounded as  though he were trying very hard not to lose his temper. \"It is because  you are young and we like you, and we can save you trouble if you mind  what we tell you. I had lost the black pits in my front teeth before you  were born, and when a Horse has lived long enough to lose the black pits  from his front teeth, he knows a good deal. You don't know a curb-bit  from a snaffle now, but you will learn many things when you are  broken--a very great many things.\"    The Bay Colt tossed his head and did not answer. When he was led out to  drink, the Dappled Gray spoke quickly to his friends. \"We will let him  alone,\" said he, \"as he wishes. We will not advise him until he asks us  to do so.\" They were all whinnying \"Yes\" when the Bay Colt came back.  Then it became so still that you could have heard a stem of hay drop.    For a few days after this, the Bay Colt had a very good time. Nobody  gave him any advice, and even when he gnawed at the edge of the manger,  his mother did not seem to notice it. After he found that she didn't say  anything, he didn't gnaw, or crib, so much. He was such a foolish and  contrary young fellow that when people told him not to do a thing, he  always wanted to do that thing worse than anything else in the world.  His cousin, the Gray Colt, was not at all like him. She was a gentle  little two-year-old whom everybody loved. She was full of fun and was  the gayest possible companion in the meadow, yet when the older Horses  gave her advice, she always listened and obeyed.    The Bay Colt was very fond of his cousin, but he did like to tease her,  and once in the fall, before they came to stay in the barn, he called  her a \"goody-goody\" because she wouldn't jump the fence and run away  with him. He said she wouldn't do such things because she didn't know  what fun was. Then she did show that she had a temper, for her brown  eyes snapped and her soft lips were raised until she showed all her  biting teeth. \"I'm not a 'goody-goody,'\" she cried, stamping the ground  with her pretty little hoofs, \"and I just ache to go. I feel as though  there were ropes that I couldn't see, pulling me toward that fence  every time I think of it, but I won't go! I won't go! My mother says  that she jumped a fence and ran away when she was a Colt, and that she  felt as mean as could be afterward.\"    \"I don't care,\" said her cousin, \"I'm going anyway, and you can stay at  home if you want to. Good-bye!\" He ran and leaped over the fence, and  trotted down the road with his head well up and his tail in the air. And  then how the Gray Colt did want to follow! \"I won't!\" she said again. \"I  won't do it. I'll look the other way and try to forget it, but I wish he  knew how hard it is to be good sometimes.\"    The next morning the Bay Colt was in the pasture again. The farmer and  his man had found him far away and led him back. \"I had a fine time,\" he  said to his cousin, \"and I don't feel a bit mean. I'm going again  to-day, but don't you tell.\" When his mother scolded him as he  deserved, he just switched his tail and thought about something else  until she stopped talking. Then he ran away again.    The next morning when the Gray Colt saw him, he had a queer wooden thing  around his neck, and fastened to this was a pole that stuck out ahead of  him. It tired his neck and bothered him when he wanted to run. If he had  tried to jump the fence, it would have thrown him down. When the Gray  Colt came toward him, he pretended not to see her. He might just as well  have looked squarely at her as soon as she came, because, you know, he  had to look at her sometime, but he had a mean, slinking, afraid  feeling, such as people always have when they have done something wrong  and have had time to think about it. Besides, he had changed his mind  since the wooden poke had been put on him, and somehow his running away  seemed very foolish now. He wondered how he could ever have thought it  any fun, and he was so disgusted that he couldn't keep his ears still,  but moved them restlessly when he remembered his own silliness.    The Gray Colt was too polite to say anything about his wearing the poke,  and she talked about the grass, the sky, the trees, and everything else  she could think of. Once she was about to speak of the fence, and then  she remembered and stopped short. The Bay Colt noticed this. \"You might  just as well go on,\" said he. \"You are very kind, but I know how foolish  I have been, and there's no use in keeping still. You were right, and it  doesn't pay to jump fences for a few minutes of what you think will be  fun. I feel sick all over when I think about it.\"    \"It's too bad,\" whinnied the Gray Colt. \"I'm very sorry for you.\"    \"And what do you think?\" said the Bay Colt. \"I heard the Dappled Gray  say this morning that I was like a Pig! Imagine a Colt being like a Pig!  He said that it didn't make any difference on which side of a fence Pigs  were, they always wanted to be on the other side, and that I was just as  stupid.\"    This was all in the fall, before the cold weather had sent them to live  in the barn, and while the Bay Colt was wearing the poke he could not  well forget the lesson he had learned about jumping and running away.  His mother grew quite proud of him, and the Dappled Gray had been heard  to say that he might amount to something yet. That was a great deal for  the Dappled Gray to say, for although he had a very kind heart, he did  not often praise people, and hardly ever said such things about  two-year-olds. That made it all the harder for him when the Bay Colt  became cross over being told to stop cribbing.    You know there are some Colts who learn obedience easily, and there are  others who have one hard struggle to stop jumping, and another to stop  cribbing, and another to stop kicking, and so on, all through their  Colthood. The older Horses are sorry for them and try to help them, for  they know that neither Colt nor Horse can really enjoy life until he is  trying to do right. To be sure, people sometimes do wrong even then, but  if they will take advice and keep on trying they are certain to turn out  well.    And now, when the Bay Colt seemed to have forgotten the lesson he had in  the fall, and after he had told the other Horses to let him alone, very  strange things began to happen. The farmer took him from his stall and  made him open his mouth. Then a piece of iron was slipped into it, which  lay on top of his tongue and fitted into the place on each side of his  jaw where there were no teeth. Long lines were fastened to this iron on  either side, and when he tossed his head and sidled around, these lines  were gently pulled by the farmer and the iron bit pressed down his  tongue.    The farmer was very kind, but the Bay Colt did not want the bit in his  mouth, so he acted as ugly as he knew how, and kicked, and snapped with  his jaws open, and tried to run. The farmer did not grow angry or cross,  yet whenever the Bay Colt showed his temper, the bit would press down  his tongue and stretch the corners of his mouth until he had to stop.  Once in a while the farmer would try to pat him and show him that it was  all right, but the Bay Colt would not have this, and he was a very cross  and sweaty two-year-old when he was taken back to his stall.    He missed the Gray Colt from her usual place, but soon she came in with  one of the farmer's men. She had been driven for the first time also.    \"Hallo!\" said he. \"Have you had a bit in your mouth too? Wasn't it  dreadful? I am so angry that my hoofs fairly tingle to hit that farmer.\"    \"It was hard,\" said the Gray Colt, \"but the man who drove me was very  kind and let me rest often. He patted me, too, and that helped me to be  brave. My mother says we won't mind the bit at all after we are used to  it.\"    \"Well,\" said the Bay Colt, \"I'm never going to be used to it. I won't  stand it, and that's all there is about it.\" He stamped his hoofs and  looked very important. Two-year-olds often look quite as important as  ten-year-olds, and they feel much more so.

[Illustration: 016.jpg LEAGUE BEYOND LEAGUE, THE HILLS STKETCH ON IN LOW  IGNOBLE OUTLINE. 1]         1 From a drawing by Boudier, after a photograph by Insinger,       taken in 1881.    All kinds of granite are found together in this corner of Africa. There  are the pink and red Syenites, porphyritic granite, yellow granite, grey  granite, both black granite and white, and granites veined with black  and veined with white. As soon as these disappear behind us, various  sandstones begin to crop up, allied to the coarsest _calcaire grossier_.  The hill bristle with small split blocks, with peaks half overturned,  with rough and denuded mounds. League beyond league, they stretch in low  ignoble outline. Here and there a valley opens sharply into the desert,  revealing an infinite perspective of summits and escarpments in echelon  one behind another to the furthest plane of the horizon, like motionless  caravans. The now confined river rushes on with a low, deep murmur,  accompanied night and day by the croaking of frogs and the rhythmic  creak of the sakieh.[*]         * The sakieh is made of a notch-wheel fixed vertically on a       horizontal axle, and is actuated by various cog-wheels set       in continuous motion by oxen or asses.    A long chain of       earthenware vessels brings up the water either from the       river itself, or from some little branch  canal, and       empties it into a system of troughs and reservoirs.       Thence, it flows forth to be distributed over all the       neighbouring land.    Jetties of rough stone-work, made in unknown times by an unknown people,  run out like breakwaters into midstream.    [Illustration: 018.jpg THE ENTRANCE TO THE FIRST CATARACT]    From time to time waves of sand are borne over, and drown the narrow  fields of durra and of barley. Scraps of close, aromatic pasturage,  acacias, date-palms, and dom-palms, together with a few shrivelled  sycamores, are scattered along both banks. The ruins of a crumbling  pylon mark the site of some ancient city, and, overhanging the water,  is a vertical wall of rock honeycombed with tombs. Amid these relics of  another age, miserable huts, scattered hamlets, a town or two surrounded  with little gardens are the only evidence that there is yet life in  Nubia. South of Wady Halfah, the second granite bank is broken through,  and the second cataract spreads its rapids over a length of four  leagues: the archipelago numbers more than 350 islets, of which some  sixty have houses upon them and yield harvests to their inhabitants. The  main characteristics of the first two cataracts are repeated with slight  variations in the cases of the three which follow,--at Hannek, at  Guerendid, and El-Hu-mar. It is Egypt still, but a joyless Egypt bereft  of its brightness: impoverished, disfigured, and almost desolate.    [Illustration: 020.jpg ENTRANCE TO THE SECOND CATAKACT. 1]         1 View taken from the top of the rocks of Abusir, after a       photograph by Insinger, in 1881.    There is the same double wall of hills, now closely confining the  valley, and again withdrawing from each other as though to flee into  the desert. Everywhere are moving sheets of sand, steep black banks with  their narrow strips of cultivation, villages which are scarcely visible  on account of the lowness of their huts sycamore ceases at Gebel-Barkal,  date-palms become fewer and finally disappear. The Nile alone has not  changed. And it was at Philse, so it is at Berber. Here, however, on  the right bank, 600 leagues from the sea, is its first affluent, the  Takazze, which intermittently brings to it the waters of Northern  Ethiopia. At Khartum, the single channel in which the river flowed  divides; and two other streams are opened up in a southerly direction,  each of them apparently equal in volume to the main stream. Which is  the true Nile? Is it the Blue Nile, which seems to come down from the  distant mountains? Or is it the White Nile, which has traversed the  immense plains of equatorial Africa. The old Egyptians never knew.  The river kept the secret of its source from them as obstinately as it  withheld it from us until a few years ago. Vainly did their victorious  armies follow the Nile for months together as they pursued the  tribes who dwelt upon its banks, only to find it as wide, as full, as  irresistible in its progress as ever. It was a fresh-water sea, and  sea--_iauma, ioma_--was the name by which they called it.    The Egyptians therefore never sought its source. They imagined the whole  universe to be a large box, nearly rectangular in form, whose greatest  diameter was from south to north, and its least from east to west. The  earth, with its alternate continents and seas, formed the bottom of the  box; it was a narrow, oblong, and slightly concave floor, with Egypt  in its centre. The sky stretched over it like an iron ceiling, flat  according to some, vaulted according to others. Its earthward face was  capriciously sprinkled with lamps hung from strong cables, and which,  extinguished or unperceived by day, were lighted, or became visible to  our eyes, at night.    [Illustration: 022.jpg AN ATTEMPT TO REPRESENT THE EGYPTIAN UNIVERSE.2]         2 Section taken at Hermopolis. To the left, is the bark of       the sun on the celestial river.    Since this ceiling could not remain in mid-air without support, four  columns, or rather four forked trunks of trees, similar to those which  maintained the primitive house, were supposed to uphold it. But it was  doubtless feared lest some tempest should overturn them, for they were  superseded by four lofty peaks, rising at the four cardinal points, and  connected by a continuous chain of mountains. The Egyptians knew little  of the northern peak: the Mediterranean, the \"Very Green,\" interposed  between it and Egypt, and prevented their coming near enough to see it.  The southern peak was named Apit the Horn of the Earth; that on the east  was called Bakhu, the Mountain of Birth; and the western peak was known  as Manu, sometimes as Onkhit, the Region of Life.    [Illustration: 023.jpg FOOTNOTES WITH GRAPHICS]    Bakhu was not a fictitious mountain, but the highest of those distant  summits seen from the Nile in looking towards the red Sea. In the same  way, Manu answered to some hill of the Libyan desert, whose summit  closed the horizon. When it was discovered that neither Bakhu nor Manu  were the limits of the world, the notion of upholding the celestial roof  was not on that account given up. It was only necessary to withdraw the  pillars from sight, and imagine fabulous peaks, invested with familiar  names. These were not supposed to form the actual boundary of  the universe; a great river--analogous to the Ocean-stream of the  Greeks--lay between them and its utmost limits. This river circulated  upon a kind of ledge projecting along the sides of the box a little  below the continuous mountain chain upon which the starry heavens were  sustained. On the north of the ellipse, the river was bordered by a  steep and abrupt bank, which took its rise at the peak of Manu on the  west, and soon rose high enough to form a screen between the river and  the earth. The narrow valley which it hid from view was known as  Da'it from remotest times. Eternal night enfolded that valley in thick  darkness, and filled it with dense air such as no living thing could  breathe. Towards the east the steep bank rapidly declined, and ceased  altogether a little beyond Bakhu, while the river flowed on between low  and almost level shores from east to south, and then from south to west.  The sun was a disc of fire placed upon a boat. At the same equable rate,  the river carried it round the ramparts of the world. Erom evening until  morning it disappeared within the gorges of Dait; its light did not then  reach us, and it was night. From morning until evening its rays, being  no longer intercepted by any obstacle, were freely shed abroad from one  end of the box to the other, and it was day. The Nile branched off from  the celestial river at its southern bend;[*] hence the south was  the chief cardinal point to the Egyptians, and by that they oriented  themselves, placing sunrise to their left, and sunset to their right.         * The classic writers themselves knew that, according to       Egyptian belief, the Nile flowed down from heaven. The       legend of the Nile having its source in the ocean stream was       but a Greek transposition of the Egyptian doctrine, which       represented it as an arm of the celestial river whereon the       sun sailed round the earth.    Before they passed beyond the defiles of Gebel Silsileh, they thought  that the spot whence the celestial waters left the sky was situate  between Elephantine and Philae, and that they descended in an immense  waterfall whose last leaps were at Syene. It may be that the tales about  the first cataract told by classic writers are but a far-off echo of  this tradition of a barbarous age. Conquests carried into the heart of  Africa forced the Egyptians to recognize their error, but did not weaken  their faith in the supernatural origin of the river. They only placed  its source further south, and surrounded it with greater marvels.  They told how, by going up the stream, sailors at length reached an  undetermined country, a kind of borderland between this world and the  next, a \"Land of Shades,\" whose inhabitants were dwarfs, monsters,  or spirits. Thence they passed into a sea sprinkled with mysterious  islands, like those enchanted archipelagoes which Portuguese and Breton  mariners were wont to see at times when on their voyages, and which  vanished at their approach. These islands were inhabited by serpents  with human voices, sometimes friendly and sometimes cruel to the  shipwrecked. He who went forth from the islands could never more  re-enter them: they were resolved into the"]]]
