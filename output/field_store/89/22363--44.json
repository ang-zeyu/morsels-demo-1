He turned out to be  quite an intelligent sort of fellow, and we chatted together for ten  minutes or so.    \"I had forgotten all about him when, I believe on the following night,  he reappeared in the character of a patient. He had a badly damaged  skull, and I gathered that he had had an accident with his cab and had  been pitched out into the road.    \"When I had fixed him up, he asked me to do him a small favour. From  inside his tunic he pulled out a long stiff envelope, bearing no  address but the number 30 in big red letters. It was secured at both  ends with black wax bearing the imprint of a curious and complicated  seal.    \"'A gentleman left this behind in the cab today, sir,' said the  man--'perhaps the one who was with me when I had the spill, and I've  got no means of tracing him; but he may be able to trace _me_ if he  happened to notice my number, or he may advertise. It evidently  contains something valuable.'    \"'Then why not take it to Scotland Yard?' I asked. 'Isn't that the  proper course?'    \"'It is,' he admitted; 'but here's the point: if the owner reclaims it  from Scotland Yard he's less likely to dub up handsome than if he gets  it direct from me!'    \"I laughed at that, for the soundness of the argument was beyond  dispute. 'But what on earth do you want to leave it with _me_ for?'  I asked.\"    \"'Self-protection,' was the reply. 'They can't say I meant to pinch  it! Whereas, directly there's any inquiry I can come and collect it  and get the reward; and your word will back me up if any questions are  asked; that's if you don't mind, sir.'    \"I told him I didn't mind in the least, and accordingly I sealed the  envelope in a yet larger one which I addressed to the Lost Property  Office and put into a private drawer of my bureau. 'You will have no  objection,' I said, 'to this being posted if it isn't reclaimed within  a reasonable time?'    \"He said that would be all right and departed--since which moment I  have not set eyes upon him. I now come to the sequel, or what I have  just recognized to be the sequel.\"    Stuart's agitation grew more marked and it was only by dint of a  palpable effort that he forced himself to resume.    \"On the evening of the following day a lady called professionally.  She was young, pretty, and dressed with extraordinary elegance. My  housekeeper admitted her, as I was out at the time but momentarily  expected. She awaited my return here, in this room. She came again  two days later. The name she gave was an odd one: Mademoiselle Dorian.  There is her card,\"--Stuart opened a drawer and laid a visiting-card  before Dunbar--\"no initials and no address. She travelled in a large  and handsome car. That is to say, according to my housekeeper's  account it is a large and handsome car. I personally, have had but an  imperfect glimpse of it. It does not await her in front of the house,  for some reason, but just around the corner in the side turning.  Beyond wondering why Mademoiselle Dorian had selected me as her  medical advisor I had detected nothing suspicious in her behaviour up  to the time of which I am about to speak.    \"Last night there was a singular development, and to-night matters  came to a head.\"    Thereupon Stuart related as briefly as possible the mysterious episode  of the cowled man, and finally gave an account of the last visit of  Mlle. Dorian. Inspector Dunbar did not interrupt him, but listened  attentively to the singular story.    \"And there,\" concluded Stuart, \"on the blotting-pad, lies the sealed  envelope!\"    Dunbar took it up eagerly. A small hole had been burned in one end of  the envelope and much of the surrounding paper was charred. The wax  with which Stuart had sealed it had lain uppermost, and although it  had been partly melted, the mark of his signet-ring was still  discernible upon it. Dunbar stood staring at it.    \"In the circumstances, Inspector, I think you would be justified in  opening both envelopes,\" said Stuart.    \"I am inclined to agree. But let me just be clear on one or two  points.\" He took out the bulging note-book and also a fountain-pen  with which he prepared to make entries. \"About this cabman, now. You  didn't by any chance note the number of his cab?\"    \"I did not.\"    \"What build of man was he?\"    \"Over medium height and muscular. Somewhat inclined to flesh and past  his youth, but active all the same.\"    \"Dark or fair?\"    \"Dark and streaked with grey. I noted this particularly in dressing  his skull. He wore his hair cropped close to the scalp. He had a short  beard and moustache and heavily marked eyebrows. He seemed to be very  short-sighted and kept his eyes so screwed up that it was impossible  to detect their colour, by night at any rate.\"    \"What sort of wound had he on his skull?\"    \"A short ugly gash. He had caught his head on the footboard in falling.  I may add that on the occasion of his professional visit his breath  smelled strongly of spirits, and I rather suspected that his accident  might have been traceable to his condition.\"    \"But he wasn't actually drunk?\"    \"By no means. He was perfectly sober, but he had recently been  drinking--possibly because his fall had shaken him, of course.\"    \"His hands?\"    \"Small and very muscular. Quite steady. Also very dirty.\"    \"What part of the country should you say he hailed from?\"    \"London. He had a marked cockney accent.\"    \"What make of cab was it?\"    \"I couldn't say.\"    \"An old cab?\"    \"Yes. The fittings were dilapidated, I remember, and the cab had a  very musty smell.\"    \"Ah,\" said Dunbar, making several notes. \"And now--the lady: about  what would be her age?\"    \"Difficult to say, Inspector. She had Eastern blood and may have been  much younger than she appeared to be. Judged from a European standpoint  and from her appearance and manner of dress, she might be about  twenty-three or twenty-four.\"    \"Complexion?\"    \"Wonderful. Fresh as a flower.\"    \"Eyes?\"    \"Dark. They looked black at night.\"    \"Hair?\"    \"Brown and 'fuzzy' with copper tints.\"    \"Tall?\"    \"No; slight but beautifully shaped.\"    \"Now--from her accent what should you judge her nationality to be?\"    Stuart paced up and down the room, his head lowered in reflection,  then:    \"She pronounced both English and French words with an intonation which  suggested familiarity with Arabic.\"    \"Arabic? That still leaves a fairly wide field.\"    \"It does, Inspector, but I had no means of learning more. She had  certainly lived for a long time somewhere in the Near East.\"    \"Her jewellery?\"    \"Some of it was European and some of it Oriental, but not  characteristic of any particular country of the Orient.\"    \"Did she use perfume?\"    \"Yes, but it was scarcely discernible. Jasmine--probably the Eastern  preparation.\"    \"Her ailment was imaginary?\"    \"I fear so.\"    \"H'm--and now you say that Mrs. M'Gregor saw the car?\"    \"Yes, but she has retired.\"    \"Her evidence will do to-morrow. We come to the man in the hood. Can  you give me any kind of a description of him?\"    \"He appeared to be tall, but a shadow is deceptive, and his  extraordinary costume would produce that effect, too. I can tell you  absolutely nothing further about him. Remember, I thought I was  dreaming. I could not credit my senses.\"    Inspector Dunbar glanced over the notes which he had made, then  returning the note-book and pen to his pocket, he took up the long  smoke-discoloured envelope and with a paper-knife which lay upon the  table slit one end open. Inserting two fingers, he drew out the second  envelope which the first enclosed. It was an ordinary commercial  envelope only notable by reason of the number, 30, appearing in large  red figures upon it and because it was sealed with black wax bearing  a weird-looking device:    Stuart bent over him intently as he slit this envelope in turn. Again,  he inserted two fingers--and brought forth the sole contents... a  plain piece of cardboard, roughly rectangular and obviously cut in  haste from the lid of a common cardboard box!          CHAPTER VIII    THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER'S THEORY      On the following morning Inspector Dunbar, having questioned Mrs.  M'Gregor respecting the car in which Mlle. Dorian had visited the  house and having elicited no other evidence than that it was \"a fine  luxurious concern,\" the Inspector and Dr. Stuart prepared to set out  upon gruesome business. Mrs. M'Gregor was very favourably impressed  with the Inspector. \"A grand, pairsonable body,\" she confided to  Stuart. \"He'd look bonny in the kilt.\"    To an East-End mortuary the cab bore them, and they were led by a  constable in attendance to a stone-paved, ill-lighted apartment in  which a swathed form lay upon a long deal table. The spectacle  presented, when the covering was removed, was one to have shocked  less hardened nerves than those of Stuart and Dunbar; but the duties  of a police officer, like those of a medical man, not infrequently  necessitate such inspections. The two bent over the tragic flotsam of  the Thames unmoved and critical.    \"H'm,\" said Stuart--\"he's about the build, certainly. Hair iron-grey  and close cropped and he seems to have worn a beard. Now, let us see.\"    He bent, making a close inspection of the skull; then turned and  shook his head.    \"No, Inspector,\" he said definitely. \"This is not the cabman. There is  no wound corresponding to the one which I dressed.\"    \"Right,\" answered Dunbar, covering up the ghastly face. \"That's  settled.\"    \"You were wrong, Inspector. It was not Gaston Max who left the  envelope with me.\"    \"No,\" mused Dunbar, \"so it seems.\"    \"Your theory that Max, jealously working alone, had left particulars  of his inquiries, and clues, in my hands, knowing that they would  reach Scotland Yard in the event of his death, surely collapsed when  the envelope proved to contain nothing but a bit of cardboard?\"    \"Yes--I suppose it did. But it sounded so much like"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18637"],[0,"The Constitution of the United States of America: Analysis and Interpretation (#7)"],[1,"particular, powers which they had hitherto exercised only on the  justification of war. Then when the greatest crisis in the history of  our international relations arose, he imparted to the President's  diplomatic powers new extension, now without consulting Congress, now  with Congress's approval; and when at last we entered World War II, he  endowed the precedents of both the War between the States and of World  War I with unprecedented scope.[56]    It is timely therefore to inquire whether American Constitutional Law  today affords the Court a dependable weapon with which to combat  effectively contemporary enlarged conceptions of presidential power.  Pertinent in this connection is the aforementioned recent action of the  Court in Youngstown _v._ Sawyer disallowing presidential seizure of the  steel industry. The net result of that Case is distinctly favorable to  presidential pretensions, in two respects: First, because of the failure  of the Court to traverse the President's finding of facts allegedly  justifying his action, an omission in accord with the doctrine of  Political Questions; secondly, the evident endorsement by a majority of  the Court of the doctrine that, as stated in Justice Clark's opinion:  \"The Constitution does grant to the President extensive authority in  times of grave and imperative national emergency\".[57] That the Court  would have sustained, as against the President's action, a clear-cut  manifestation of congressional action to the contrary is, on the other  hand, unquestionable. In short, if we are today looking for a check upon  the development of executive emergency government, our best reliance is  upon the powers of Congress, which can always supply needed gaps in its  legislation. The Court can only say \"no\", and there is no guarantee that  in the public interest it would wish to assume this responsibility.      IV    The Concept of Substantive Due Process of Law    A cursory examination of the pages of this volume reveals that fully a  quarter of them deal with cases in which the Court has been asked to  protect private interests of one kind or another against legislation,  most generally state legislation, which is alleged to invade \"liberty\"  or \"property\" contrary to \"due process of law\". How is this vast  proliferation of cases, and attendant expansion of the Court's  constitutional jurisdiction, to be explained? The explanation, in brief,  is to be found in the replacement of the original meaning of the due  process clause with a meaning of vastly greater scope. Judicial review  is always a function, so to speak, of the viable Constitutional Law of a  particular period.    From what has been previously said in this Introduction, it clearly  appears that the Court's interpretation of the Constitution has involved  throughout considerable lawmaking, but in no other instance has its  lawmaking been more evident than in its interpretation of the due  process clauses, and in no other instance have the state judiciaries  contributed so much to the final result. The modern concept of  substantive due process is not the achievement of any one American high  court; it is the joint achievement of several--in the end, of all.[58]    The thing which renders the due process clause an important datum of  American Constitutional Law is the role it has played first and last in  articulating certain theories of private immunity with the  Constitutional Document. The first such theory was Locke's conception of  the property right as anterior to government and hence as setting a  moral limit to its powers.[59] But while Locke's influence is seen to  pervade the Declarations and Bills of Rights which often accompanied the  revolutionary State Constitutions, yet their promise was early defeated  by the overwhelming power of the first state legislatures, especially  _vis-a-vis_ the property right. One highly impressive exhibit of early  state legislative power is afforded by the ferocious catalogue of  legislation directed against the Tories, embracing acts of confiscation,  bills of pains and penalties, even acts of attainder. A second exhibit  of the same kind is furnished by the flood of paper money laws and other  measures of like intent which the widespread debtor class forced through  the great majority of the state assemblies in the years following the  general collapse of values in 1780.    The most important reaction of the creditor interest to this course of  legislation was its energetic part in bringing about the Philadelphia  Convention. Closer, however, to our purpose is the leadership taken by  the new federal judiciary in asserting the availability against  predatory state legislation of extra-constitutional principles sounding  in Natural Law. In 1795 Justice Paterson of the new Supreme Court  admonished a Pennsylvania jury that to construe a certain state statute  in a way to bring it into conflict with plaintiff's property rights  would render it void. \"Men,\" said he, \"have a sense of property.... The  preservation of property ... is a primary object of the social  compact\".[60] Three years later, Justice Chase proclaimed from the  Supreme Bench itself, with characteristic emphasis, his rejection of the  idea that state legislative power was absolute unless its authority was  \"expressly restrained\" by the constitution of the State.[61] He too was  thinking primarily of the rights of property.    To dicta such as these constantly accrued others of like tenor from  various high state courts, the total of which had come to comprise prior  to the War between the States an impressive body of coherent doctrine  protective of vested rights but claiming little direct support from  written constitutional texts. This indeed was its weakness. For the  question early obtruded itself, whether judicial review could pretend to  operate on a merely moral basis. Both the notion that the Constitution  was an emanation from the sovereignty of the people, and the idea that  judicial review was but a special aspect of normal judicial function,  forbade the suggestion. It necessarily followed that unless judicial  protection of the property right against legislative power was to be  waived, it must be rested on some clause of the constitutional document;  and, inasmuch as the due process clause and the equivalent law of the  land clause of certain of the early state constitutions were the only  constitutional provisions which specifically mentioned property, they  were the ones selected for the purpose.    The absorptive powers of the law of the land clause, the precursor in  the original state constitutions of the historically synonymous due  process clause, was foreshadowed as early as 1819 in a dictum by  Justice William Johnson of the United States Supreme Court:         As to the words from Magna Charta ... after volumes spoken and       written with a view to their exposition, the good sense of       mankind has at length settled down to this: that they were       intended to secure the individual from the arbitrary exercise       of the powers of government, unrestrained by the established       principles of private rights and distributive justice.[62]    Thirty-eight years later, in 1857, the prophecy of these words was  realized in the famous Dred Scott Case,[63] in which Section 8 of the  Missouri Compromise, whereby slavery was excluded from the territories,  was held void under the Fifth Amendment, not on the ground that the  procedure for enforcing it was not due process of law, but because the  Court regarded it as unjust to forbid people to take their slaves, or  other property, into the territories, the common property of all the  States.    Meanwhile, in the previous year (1856) the recently established Court of  Appeals of New York had, in the landmark case of Wynehamer _v._  People,[64] set aside a state-wide prohibition law as comprising, with  regard to liquors in existence at the time of its going into effect, an  act of destruction of property not within the power of government to  perform \"even by the forms of due process of law\". The term due process  of law, in short, simply drops out of the clause, which comes to read  \"no person shall be deprived of property\", period. At the same time  Judge Comstock's opinion in the case sharply repudiates all arguments  against the statute sounding in Natural Law concepts, fundamental  principles of liberty, common reason and natural rights, and so forth.  Such theories were subversive of the necessary powers of government.  Furthermore, there was \"no process of reasoning by which it can be  demonstrated that the 'Act for the Prevention of Intemperance, Pauperism  and Crime' is void, upon principles and theories outside of the  constitution, which will not also, and by an easier induction, bring it  in direct conflict with the constitution itself.\"[65] Thus it was  foreshadowed that the law of the land and the due process of law  clauses, which were originally inserted in our constitutions to  consecrate a specific mode of trial in criminal cases, to wit, the grand  jury, petit jury process of the common law, would be transformed into a  general restraint upon substantive legislation capable of affecting  property rights detrimentally.    It is against this background that the adoption of the Fourteenth  Amendment in 1868 must be projected. Applied, as in the Dred Scott and  Wynehamer cases, the clause which forbids any State \"to deprive any  person of life, liberty or property without due process of law\"  proffered the Court, in implication, a vast new jurisdiction, but this  the Court at first manifested the greatest reluctance to enter upon. It  did not wish, it protested, to become \"a perpetual censor upon all State  legislation\"; nor did it wish, by enlarged conceptions of the rights  protected by the Amendment, to encourage Congress to take over, under  the fifth section of the Amendment, the regulation of all"]]]
