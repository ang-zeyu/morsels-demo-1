In Carinthia in the  early nineteenth century, almost every parish had its local poet, who  added new songs to the old treasury.{23} Particularly popular were the  _Hirtenlieder_ or shepherd songs, in which the peasant worshippers joined  themselves to the shepherds of Bethlehem, and sought to share their  devout |46| emotions. Often these carols are of the most rustic  character and in the broadest dialect. They breathe forth a great  kindliness and homeliness, and one could fill pages with quotations. Two  more short extracts must, however, suffice to show their quality.    How warm and hearty is their feeling for the Child:--       \"Du herzliabste Muater, gib Acht auf does Kind,      Es is ja gar frostig, thuas einfatschen gschwind.      Und du alter Voda, decks Kindlein schen zua,      Sonst hats von der Koelden und Winden kan Ruah.      Hiazt nemen mir Urlaub, o gettliches Kind,      Thua unser gedenken, verzeich unser Suend.      Es freut uns von Herzen dass d'ankomen bist;      Es haett uns ja niemand zu helfen gewist.\"[21]{24}    And what fatherly affection is here:--       \"Das Kind is in der Krippen gloegn,      So herzig und so rar!      Mei klaner Hansl war nix dgoegn,      Wenn a glei schener war.      Kolschwarz wie d'Kirchen d'Augen sein,      Sunst aber kreidenweiss;      Die Haend so huebsch recht zart und fein,      I hans angruert mit Fleiss.        Aft hats auf mi an Schmutza gmacht,      An Hoescheza darzue;      O warst du mein, hoan i gedacht,      Werst wol a munter Bue.      Dahoam in meiner Kachelstub      Liess i brav hoazen ein,      Do in den Stal kimt ueberal      Der kalte Wind herein.\"[22]{25}    |47| We have been following on German ground a mediaeval tradition that  has continued unbroken down to modern days; but we must now take a leap  backward in time, and consider the beginnings of the Christmas carol in  England.    Not till the fifteenth century is there any outburst of Christmas poetry  in English, though other forms of religious lyrics were produced in  considerable numbers in the thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries.  When the carols come at last, they appear in the least likely of all  places, at the end of a versifying of the whole duty of man, by John  Awdlay, a blind chaplain of Haghmon, in Shropshire. In red letters he  writes:--       \"I pray you, sirus, boothe moore and lase,      Sing these caroles in Cristemas,\"    and then follows a collection of twenty-five songs, some of which are  genuine Christmas carols, as one now understands the word.{26}    A carol, in the modern English sense, may perhaps be defined as a  religious song, less formal and solemn than the ordinary Church hymn--an  expression of popular and often naive devotional feeling, a thing  intended to be sung outside rather than within church walls. There still  linger about the word some echoes of its original meaning, for \"carol\"  had at first a secular or even pagan significance: in twelfth-century  France it was used to describe the amorous song-dance which hailed the  coming of spring; in Italian it meant a ring- or song-dance; while by  English writers from the thirteenth to the sixteenth century it was used  chiefly of singing joined with dancing, and had no necessary connection  with religion. Much as the mediaeval Church, with its ascetic tendencies,  disliked religious dancing, it could not always suppress it; and in  Germany, as we shall see, there was choral dancing at Christmas round the  cradle of the Christ Child. Whether Christmas carols were ever danced to  in England |48| is doubtful; many of the old airs and words have,  however, a glee and playfulness as of human nature following its natural  instincts of joy even in the celebration of the most sacred mysteries. It  is probable that some of the carols are religious parodies of love-songs,  written for the melodies of the originals, and many seem by their  structure to be indirectly derived from the choral dances of farm folk, a  notable feature being their burden or refrain, a survival of the common  outcry of the dancers as they leaped around.    Awdlay's carols are perhaps meant to be sung by \"wassailing neighbours,  who make their rounds at Christmastide to drink a cup and take a gift,  and bring good fortune upon the house\"{27}--predecessors of those  carol-singers of rural England in the nineteenth century, whom Mr. Hardy  depicts so delightfully in \"Under the Greenwood Tree.\" Carol-singing by a  band of men who go from house to house is probably a Christianization of  such heathen processions as we shall meet in less altered forms in Part  II.    It must not be supposed that the carols Awdlay gives are his own work;  and their exact date it is impossible to determine. Part of his book was  composed in 1426, but one at least of the carols was probably written in  the last half of the fourteenth century. They seem indeed to be the later  blossomings of the great springtime of English literature, the period  which produced Chaucer and Langland, an innumerable company of minstrels  and ballad-makers, and the mystical poet, Richard Rolle of Hampole.[23]    Through the fifteenth century and the first half of the sixteenth, the  flowering continued; and something like two hundred carols of this period  are known. It is impossible to attempt here anything like representative  quotation; I can only sketch in |49| roughest outline the main  characteristics of English carol literature, and refer the reader for  examples to Miss Edith Rickert's comprehensive collection, \"Ancient  English Carols, MCCCC-MDCC,\" or to the smaller but fine selection in  Messrs. E. K. Chambers and F. Sidgwick's \"Early English Lyrics.\" Many may  have been the work of _goliards_ or wandering scholars, and a common  feature is the interweaving of Latin with English words.    Some, like the exquisite \"I sing of a maiden that is makeles,\"{29} are  rather songs to or about the Virgin than strictly Christmas carols; the  Annunciation rather than the Nativity is their theme. Others again tell  the whole story of Christ's life. The feudal idea is strong in such lines  as these:--       \"Mary is quene of alle thinge,      And her sone a lovely kinge.      God graunt us alle good endinge!            _Regnat dei gracia_.\"{30}    On the whole, in spite of some mystical exceptions, the mediaeval English  carol is somewhat external in its religion; there is little deep  individual feeling; the caroller sings as a member of the human race,  whose curse is done away, whose nature is exalted by the Incarnation,  rather than as one whose soul is athirst for God:--       \"Now man is brighter than the sonne;      Now man in heven an hie shall wonne;      Blessed be God this game is begonne        And his moder emperesse of helle.\"{31}    Salvation is rather an objective external thing than an inward and  spiritual process. A man has but to pray devoutly to the dear Mother and  Child, and they will bring him to the heavenly court. It is not so much  personal sin as an evil influence in humanity, that is cured by the great  event of Christmas:--       \"It was dark, it was dim,      For men that leved in gret sin;      Lucifer was all within,        Till on the Cristmes day. |50|        There was weping, there was wo,      For every man to hell gan go.      It was litel mery tho,        Till on the Cristmes day.\"{32}    But now that Christ is born, and man redeemed, one may be blithe  indeed:--       \"Jhesus is that childes name,      Maide and moder is his dame,      And so oure sorow is turned to game.            _Gloria tibi domine._           *       *       *       *       *        Now sitte we downe upon our knee,      And pray that child that is so free;      And with gode herte now sing we            _Gloria tibi domine_.\"{33}    Sometimes the religious spirit almost vanishes, and the carol becomes  little more than a gay pastoral song:--       \"The shepard upon a hill he satt;      He had on him his tabard and his hat,      His tar-box, his pipe, and his flagat;      His name was called Joly Joly Wat,        For he was a gud herdes boy.                    Ut hoy!        For in his pipe he made so much joy.           *       *       *       *       *        Whan Wat to Bedlem cum was,      He swet, he had gone faster than a pace;      He found Jesu in a simpell place,      Betwen an ox and an asse.                    Ut hoy!        For in his pipe he made so much joy.        'Jesu, I offer to thee here my pipe,      My skirt, my tar-box, and my scripe;      Home to my felowes now will I skipe,      And also look unto my shepe.'                    Ut hoy!        For in his pipe he made so much joy.\"{34}    |51| But to others again, especially the lullabies, the hardness of the  Nativity, the shadow of the coming Passion, give a deep note of sorrow  and pathos; there is the thought of the sword that shall pierce Mary's  bosom:--       \"This endris night I saw a sight,        A maid a cradell kepe,      And ever she song and seid among        'Lullay, my child, and slepe.'        'I may not slepe, but I may wepe,        I am so wo begone;      Slepe I wold, but I am colde        And clothes have I none.           *       *       *       *       *        'Adam's gilt this man had spilt;        That sin greveth me sore.      Man, for thee here shall I be        Thirty winter and more.           *       *       *       *       *        'Here shall I be hanged on a tree,        And die as it is skill.      That I have bought lesse will I nought;        It is my fader's will.'\"{35}    The lullabies are quite the most delightful, as they are the most human,  of the carols. Here is an exquisitely musical verse from one of 1530:--       \"In a dream late as I lay,      Methought I heard a maiden say        And speak these words so mild:      'My little son, with thee I play,      And come,' she sang, 'by, lullaby.'        Thus rocked"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19103"],[0,"The Discovery of a World in the Moone (#7)"],[1," so darken the Sun, or cause  such great eclipses as have turned day into night,[1] that have  discovered the stars, and frighted the birds with such a sudden  darknesse, that they fell downe upon the earth, as it is related in  divers Histories? And therefore _Herodotus_ telling of an Eclipse which  fell in _Xerxes_ time, describes it thus:[2] +ho helios eklipon ten ek  tou ouranou hedren aphanes en+. The Sunne leaving his wonted seate in  the heavens, vanished away: all which argues such a great darknesse, as  could not have beene, if her body had beene perspicuous. Yet some there  are who interpret all these relations to bee hyperbolicall expressions,  and the noble _Tycho_ thinkes it naturally impossible, that any eclipse  should cause such darknesse, because the body of the Moone can never  totally cover the Sunne; however, in this he is singular, all other  Astronomers (if I may believe _Keplar_) being on the contrary opinion,  by reason the Diameter of the Moone does for the most part appeare  bigger to us then the Diameter of the Sunne.      [Sidenote 1: _Thucid._    _Livii._    _Plut. de fa. Lunae._]      [Sidenote 2: _Herodot. l. 7 c. 37._]    But here _Julius Caesar_[1] once more, puts in to hinder our passage. The  Moone (saith he) is not altogether opacous, because 'tis still of the  same nature with the Heavens, which are incapable of totall opacity: and  his reason is, because perspicuity is an inseparable accident of those  purer bodies, and this hee thinkes must necessarily bee granted, for hee  stops there, and proves no further; but to this I shall deferre an  answere, till hee hath made up his argument.      [Sidenote 1: _De phaenom. Lunae. c. 11._]    We may frequently see, that her body does so eclipse the Sunne, as our  earth doth the Moone; since then the like interposition of them both,  doth produce the like effect, they must necessarily be of the like  natures, that is a like opacous, which is the thing to be shewed; and  this was the reason (as the Interpreters guesse) why _Aristotle_  affirmed the Moone to be of the earths nature,[1] because of their  agreement in opacity, whereas all the other elements save that, are in  some measure perspicuous.      [Sidenote 1: _In lib. de animalib._]    But the greatest difference which may seeme to make our earth altogether  unlike the Moone, is, because the one is a bright body, and hath light  of its owne, and the other a grosse dark body which cannot shine at all.  'Tis requisite therefore, that in the next place I cleare this doubt,  and shew that the Moone hath no more light of her owne than our earth.          Proposition 5.    _That the Moone hath not any light of her owne._      Twas the fancy of some of the Jewes, and more especially of _Rabbi  Simeon_, that the Moone was nothing else but a contracted Sunne,[1] and  that both those planets at their first creation were equall both in  light and quantity, for because God did then call them both great  lights, therefore they inferred, that they must be both equall in  bignesse. But a while after (as the tradition goes) the ambitious Moone  put up her complaint to God against the Sunne, shewing, that it was not  fit there should be two such great lights in the heavens, a Monarchy  would best become the place of order and harmony. Upon this God  commanded her to contract her selfe into a narrower compasse, but she  being much discontented hereat, replies, What! because I have spoken  that which is reason and equity, must I therefore be diminished? This  sentence could not chuse but much trouble her; and for this reason was  shee in much distresse and griefe for a long space, but that her sorrow  might be some way pacified, God bid her be of good cheere, because her  priviledges and charet should be greater then the Suns, he should  appeare in the day timeonely, shee both in the day and night, but her  melancholy being not satisfied with this, shee replyed againe, that that  alas was no benefit, for in the day-time she should be either not seene,  or not noted. Wherefore, God to comfort her up, promised, that his  people the Israelites should celebrate all their feasts and holy daies  by a computation of her moneths, but this being not able to content her,  shee has looked very melancholy ever since; however shee hath still  reserved much light of her owne.      [Sidenote 1: _Tostatus in 1. Gen._    _Hieron. de 5. Hide._    _Hebraeonia l. 2. c. 4._]    Others there were, that did thinke the Moone to be a round globe, the  one halfe of whole body was of a bright substance, the other halfe being  darke, and the divers conversions of those sides towards our eyes,  caused the variety of her appearances: of this opinion was _Berosus_, as  he is cited by _Vitruvius_,[1] and St. _Austin_[2] thought it was  probable enough, but this fancy is almost equally absurd with the  former, and both of them sound rather like fables, then philosophicall  truths. You may commonly see how this latter does contradict frequent  and easie experience, for 'tis observed, that that spot which is  perceived about her middle, when she is in the increase, may be  discern'd in the same place when she is in the ful: whence it must  follow, that the same part which was before darkened, is after  inlightened, and that the one part is not alwaies darke, and the other  light of it selfe, but enough of this, I would be loth to make an enemy,  that I may afterwards overcome him, or bestow time in proving that which  is already granted. I suppose now, that neither of them hath any  patrons, and therefore need no confutation.      [Sidenote 1: _Lib. 9. Architecturae._]      [Sidenote 2: _in enarrat. Psalmorum._]    'Tis agreed upon by all sides, that this Planet receives most of her  light from the Sunne, but the chiefe controversie is, whether or no she  hath any of her owne? The greater multitude affirme this. _Cardan_  amongst the rest, is very confident of it, and he thinkes that if any of  us were in the Moone at the time of her greatest eclipse,[1]      _Lunam aspiceremus non secus ac innumeris cereis splendidissimis    accensis, atque in eas oculis defixis caecutiremus_;    \"wee should perceive so great a brightnesse of her owne, that would  blind us with the meere sight,\" and when shee is enlightened by the  Sunne, then no eagles eye if there were any there, is able to looke upon  her. This _Cardan_ saies, and hee doth but say it without bringing any  proofe for its confirmation. However, I will set downe the arguments  that are usually urged for this opinion, and they are taken either from  Scripture or reason; from Scripture is urged that place, _1 Cor. 15._  where it is said, _There is one glory of the Sunne, and another glory  of the Moone_. _Vlysses Albergettus_ urges, that in _Math. 24. 22._  +he selene ou dosei to phengos autes+, _The Moone shall not give her  light_: therefore (saies he) she hath some of her owne.      [Sidenote 1: _De Subtil. lib. 3._]    But to these wee may easily answer that the glory and light there spoken  of, may be said to be hers, though it be derived, as you may see in many  other instances.    The arguments from reason are taken either    1. From that light which is discerned in her, when there is a totall  eclipse of her owne body, or of the Sunne.    2. For the light which is discerned in the darker part of her body, when  she is but a little distant from the Sunne.    1. For when there are any totall eclipses, there appeares in her body a  great rednesse, and many times light enough to cause a remarkeable  shade, as common experience doth sufficiently manifest: but this cannot  come from the Sunne, since at such times either the earth, or her owne  body shades her from the Sun-beames, therefore it must proceede from her  owne light.    2. Two or three daies after the new Moone, wee may perceive light in her  whole body, whereas the rayes of the Sun reflect but upon a small part  of that which is visible, therefore 'tis likely that there is some light  of her owne.    In answering to these objections, I shall first shew, that this light  cannot be her owne, and then declare that which is the true reason of  it.    That it is not her own, appeares    1. From the variety of it at divers times; for 'tis commonly observed,  that sometimes 'tis of a brighter, sometimes of a darker appearance, now  redder, and at another time of a more duskish colour. The observation of  this variety in divers eclipses, you may see set downe by _Keplar_[1]  and many others, but now this could not be if that light were her owne,  that being constantly the same, and without any reason of such an  alteration: So that thus I may argue.      [Sidenote 1: _Opt. Astron. c. 7. num. 3._]    If there were any light proper to the Moone, then would that Planet  appeare brightest when she is eclipied in her Perige, being neerest to  the earth, and so consequently more obscure and duskish when she is in  her Apoge or farthest from it; the reason is, because the neerer any  enlightened body comes to the sight, by so much the more strong are the  species and the better perceived. This sequell is granted by some of our  adversaries, and they are the very words of noble _Tycho_,[1]      _Si luna genuino gauderet lumine, utique cum in umbra terrae esset,  illud non amitteret, sed eo evidentius exereret, omne enim lumen in  tenebris, plus splendet cum alio majore fulgore non praepeditur._    If the Moone had any light of her owne, then would she not lose it in  the earths shadow, but rather shine more clearely, since every light  appeares greater in the darke, when it is not hindered by a more  perspicuous brightnesse.      [Sidenote 1: _De nova stella lib. 1. c. 10._]    But now the event falls out cleane contrary, (as observation doth  manifest, and our opposites themselves doe grant)[1] the Moone appearing  with a more reddish and cleare light when she is eclipsed being in her  Apoge or farthest distance, and a more"]]]
