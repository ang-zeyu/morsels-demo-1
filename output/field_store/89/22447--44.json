The seven pictures from  the Life of David are among the best ever put into a MS. But  personification is carried to an extreme. Thus the Red Sea, the Jordan,  Rivers, Mountains, Night, Dawn, etc., are all represented as persons.  The drawings are really beautiful and the illuminated initials and  general ornament in good taste.    For other examples the reader may consult the British Museum Cat. of  Addit. MSS., 1841-5, p. 87; also Du Sommerard, _Les Arts au Moyen-âge_,  tom. v., 1846, pp. 107, 162-8, and album, 2e sér. pl. xxix., 8e sér.  pl. xii.-xvi.    It is noticeable in these Byzantine pictures that while the  figure-painting is often really excellent, the design skilful, and the  pose natural, the landscape, trees, etc., are quite symbolic and  fanciful. The painters seem to have been utterly ignorant of  perspective. Buildings, too, without any regard to relative proportion,  are coloured merely as parts of a colour scheme. They are pink, pale  green, yellow, violet, blue, just to please the eye. That the painter  had a system of colour-harmony is plain, but he paid no regard to the  facts of city life, unless, indeed, it was the practice of the mediæval  Byzantines to paint the outside of their houses in this truly brilliant  style. Possibly they did so; we have similar things in Italy even  nowadays.    No doubt the French illuminators of the thirteenth and fourteenth  centuries drew from these sources both their perspective and their  architectural colouring. As for ornamental illumination, the principal  method of decoration was a square heading,[10] perhaps including a  semicircular arch sweeping over several arcades, the corners and  wall-space being occupied either with arabesque patterns, showing them  to be after the time of Leo III., or with scrolls of line-ornament  enriched with acanthus foliages. Under this the scribe has placed his  title.    [10] It has been thought to represent the Greek {~GREEK SMALL LETTER  PI~}, and to mean {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON  WITH TONOS~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}, a  gate or door.    [Illustration:  CARVED IVORY COVER  LATIN PSALTER OF MELLISENDA  12TH CENT.  _Brit. Mus. Egert. MS. 1139_]    [Illustration:  CODEX AURENS  (GOLDEN GOSPELS OF ATHELSTAN)  C. 835  _Brit. Mus. Harl. MS. 2788, fol. 176_]    Other examples have a square frame filled with the latter kind of  scrolls and foliages, leaving a sort of open panel in the centre, in  which is placed a small scene of sacred history or perhaps of country  life. Sometimes the title, in golden letters, is surrounded with  medallions containing heads of Christ and the Virgin, apostles, and  saints. The peculiar interlacing bands of violet, yellow, rose, blue,  etc., which are still often seen in Russian ornament, are also features  of these Byzantine MSS.; but most of all is the lavish use of gold.  Perhaps the fact most to be remembered about these MSS. is that the  painters of them worked in a manner that was absolutely fixed and rigid,  the rules of which are laid down in a manual called the _Guide to  Painting_, a work which has been translated by M. Didron.    So fixed and unalterable, indeed, is the manner that there is absolutely  no difference to indicate relative antiquity between a MS. of the  eleventh century and one of the sixteenth or even later, we might almost  say, of the present day. In the matter of saint-images this is strictly  true.          CHAPTER VI    CELTIC ILLUMINATION    Early liturgical books reflect the ecclesiastical art of their  time--This feature a continuous characteristic of illumination down to  the latest times--Elements of Celtic ornament--Gospels of St.  Chad--Durham Gospels--Contrast of Celtic and Byzantine--St.  Columba--Book of Kells--Details of its decoration.      In the earlier centuries of Christianity, when liturgical books were the  chief occupation of the illuminator, it will need little pointing out to  demonstrate that the page of the illuminated manuscript, where it  contained more than the mere ornamental initial, was simply a mirror of  the architectural decoration of the church in which it was intended to  be used. Where the church enrichments consist, as on the Byzantine  basilicas, of panellings, arcades, and tympana of gilded sculpture in  wood or stone, with figures of saints, the pages of the Gospel-book bear  similar designs. Where, as in the Romanesque, they are rich in mosaics,  and fretted arcades interlacing each other, so are the illuminated Lives  of the Saints, the Menologia, Psalters, and Gospel-books. Where, as in  the Gothic cathedrals of the West--of France, Germany, or Italy--the  stained glass is the striking feature of the interior, so it is with the  illumination; it is a \"vitrail\"--a glass-painting on vellum. On this  latter point we shall have more to say when we reach the period of  Gothic illumination.    Incidentally, also, the book reflects the minor arts in vogue at the  period of its execution. Often in the illumination we may detect these  popular local industries. We see mosaic enamelling, wood-and  stone-carving, and lacquer-work, and as we approach the Renaissance,  even gem-cutting and the delicate craft of the medallist. In Venice and  the Netherlands we have the local taste for flower-culture; in Germany  we find sculpture in wood and stone; in France the productions of the  enameller and the goldsmith; until at length, in the full blaze of the  Renaissance itself, we have in almost every land the same varieties of  enrichment practised according to its own special style of work.    It has been said that the oldest Celtic illuminated MSS. show no signs  of classic, or even Byzantine, influence, yet the plan or framework of  the designs makes use both of the cross and the arch, as used in the  earliest Byzantine examples. The details, indeed, are quite different,  and manifestly derived from indigenous sources. It may be, therefore,  that the framework is merely a geometrical coincidence which could not  well be avoided. The fact that the basis of pure Irish ornament _is_  geometrical, and developed out of the prehistoric and barbarous art of  the savages who preceded the Celts in Ireland; such art as is used on  the carved shafts of spears, and oars, and staves of honour, and  afterwards on stone crosses and metal-work, may account for the  similarity of ideas in ornament developed by old Roman decorators in  their mosaic pavements, and may reconcile, in some measure, the varied  opinions of different writers who have approached the subject from  different points of view. Westwood adhered to the theory of its being  purely indigenous. Fleury, on the other hand, in his Catalogue of the  MSS. in the Library at Laon, asserts that we owe the knots and  interlacements to the influence of the painters, sculptors, and  mosaicists of Rome. \"These interlacings, cables, etc., there is no  Gallo-Roman monument which does not exhibit them, and, only to cite  local instances, the cord of four or five strands is seen in the  beautiful mosaics discovered in profusion within the last five years  (1857-62) at Blanzy, at Bazoches, at Vailly, and at Reims. It was from  them that the Franks borrowed their knots and twists and ribbons for  their belts and buckles, their rings and bracelets\" (pt. i., p. 8).    The elements, therefore, of book ornament, as used by the Celtic penmen,  are such as were employed by the prehistoric and sporadic nations in the  textile art in plaiting and handweaving, and afterwards transferred to  that of metal-work. Terminals of animal, bird, or serpent form  afterwards combine with the linear designs. The dog and dragon are  common, as may be seen in the archaic vases produced by the Greeks  before they came under the influence of ideas from Western Asia.    Among Celtic artists, as among those of later times, the practice of  working in various materials was common to the same individual, and  Dagæus (d. 586) may compare with Dunstan, Eloy, Tuotilo, and others.    To apply these observations to the style of illumination which now comes  under our notice it may be said that if we allow the cross and arch to  be copied from the Byzantine MSS. introduced from abroad, the details  are undoubtedly supplied by the wickerwork and textile netting familiar  to the everyday life of the artist. Assisted by the fertile imagination  of bardic lore in snakes, dragons, and other mythic monsters of heroic  verse, the illuminator produces a pencilled tapestry of textile fabric  or flexile metal-work as marvellous as it is unique. No amount of  description can give a true idea of what Celtic work is like; it must be  seen to be comprehended. One glance at a facsimile of such a MS. as the  Book of Kells or the Lindisfarne Gospels, or those of St. Chad at  Lichfield, or wherever, as at St. Gall, such work is to be met with,  will supersede the most laboured attempt at description. We must  therefore at once refer the reader to the facsimile. When that has been  inspected, we may proceed. In the first place it may be noted that with  these Occidental MSS. begins the importance and development of the  initial, which, indeed, as regards the illumination of Western Europe,  is the very root of the matter. It is the development of the initial  letter first into the bracket, then into the border, which forms the  great distinction of the \"Art of Paris,\" as Dante calls it, from that of  Byzantium. The latter is almost always of a squared or tabular design,  traced and painted on a ground of burnished gold. The former exhausts  itself first in fantastic lacertine forms, twisted into the shapes of  the commencing letters or words of the writing, to which the suggestion  of some Byzantine MS, perhaps occasionally adds a frame. Next come  birds, dogs, dragons,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19880"],[0,"Voice Production in Singing and Speaking (#7)"],[1,"to act when stimulated,  contract more slowly, and cease to function more tardily when the  stimulus is withdrawn.    The muscular mechanisms used by the singer and speaker are of the  skeletal variety.    If it be true that the welfare of one part of the body is bound up  with that of every other, as are the interests of one member of a firm  with those of another, in a great business, it will at once appear  that the most perfect results can follow for the voice-user only under  certain conditions. However perfect by nature the vocal mechanism, the  result in any case must be largely determined by the character of the  body as a whole. The man of fine physique generally has naturally more  to hope for than one with an ill-developed body.    In the natural working of the body the stimulus to a muscle is  nervous; hence we may appropriately, and often to advantage, speak of  _neuro-muscular_ mechanism, the nervous element being as important as  the muscular.    In a later chapter it will be shown that the work of the singer and  speaker when most successfully carried out must be largely reflex in  nature--a fact on which hang weighty considerations with regard to  many questions, among them methods of practice, the influence of  example, etc.--be he ever so much the natural artist. It will be the  writer's aim, however, to give such warnings and advice as may assist  each reader in his own best development. Many who began with a  comparatively poor physical stock in trade have surpassed the  self-satisfied ones who trusted too much to what nature gave them.  Singers as well as others would do well to believe that _Labor omnia  vincit_.      SUMMARY.    The same fundamental physiological principles apply to the lowest and  to the highest animals. To all belong certain properties or qualities.  As structure is differentiated, or as one animal differs from another  owing to greater or less complexity of form, there is a corresponding  differentiation of function, none, however, ever losing the  fundamental properties of protoplasm. Each organ comes to perform some  one function better than all others. This is specialization, and  implies advance among animals as it does in civilization.    The neuro-muscular system is of great moment to the voice-user. He is  a specialist as regards the neuro-muscular systems of the vocal  mechanism. But the same laws apply to it as to other neuro-muscular  mechanisms. It is of great theoretical and practical importance to  recognize this, and that one part of the body is related to every  other, which relationship is maintained chiefly by the nervous system,  and largely through reflex action.          CHAPTER III.    BREATHING CONSIDERED THEORETICALLY AND PRACTICALLY.      If the old orator was right in considering _delivery_ as the essence  of public speaking as an art, it may with equal truth be said of  singing, the term being always so extended in signification as to  imply what Rossini named as the essential for the singer--_voice_.    Looking at it from the physiological point of view, we may say that  the one absolutely essential thing for singers and speakers is  breathing. Without methods of breathing that are correct and adequate  there may be a perfect larynx and admirably formed resonance-chambers  above the vocal bands, with very unsatisfactory results. The more the  writer knows of singers and speakers, the more deeply does he become  convinced that singing and speaking may be resolved into the correct  use of the breathing apparatus, above all else. Not that this alone  will suffice, but it is the most important, and determines more than  any other factor the question of success or failure. Breathing is the  key-note with which we must begin, and to which we must return again  and again.    The extent to which this subject has been misunderstood,  misrepresented, and obscured in works on the voice, and its neglect by  so large a number of those who profess to understand how to teach  singing and public speaking, are truly amazing. That many should fail  to fully appreciate its importance in attaining artistic results is  not so surprising as that the process itself should have been so ill  understood, especially as it is open to any one to observe in himself,  or in our domestic animals, Nature's method of getting air into and  out of the body.    [Illustration: FIG. 9. A front view of parts of the respiratory  apparatus. (Halliburton's Physiology.)]    [Illustration: FIG. 9. A back view of the parts represented in Fig. 9.  (Halliburton's Physiology.)] [Transcriber's Note: numbered thus in  original.]    [Illustration: FIG. 10 (Spalteholz). A view of the lower part of the  trachea, dividing into the main bronchial tubes, which again branch  into a tree-like form. The air-cells are built up around the  terminations of the finest bronchial tubes, of which they are a sort  of membranous extension.]    [Illustration: FIG. 11 (Spalteholz). Shows well the relations of  heart, lungs, and diaphragm. The lungs have been drawn back, otherwise  the heart would be covered almost wholly by them. It will be noted  that the heart-covering is attached to the diaphragm. The fact that  the stomach and other important organs of the abdomen lie immediately  beneath the diaphragm is a significant one for the voice-user.  Manifestly, a full stomach and free, vigorous breathing are  incompatible.]    This misapprehension is in all probability to be traced to the  dependence of the student and teacher on tradition rather than  observation--on authority rather than rational judgment. If a great  teacher or singer makes any announcement whatever in regard to the  technique of his art, it is natural that it should be considered with  attention, but it may prove a great misfortune for the individual to  accept it without thoughtful consideration. The author will  illustrate, from time to time, the truth of the above.    In this and all other chapters of this work the student, by which term  I mean every one who is seriously interested in the use of the voice,  is recommended to give attention, before reading on any subject, to  the illustrations employed, perusing very carefully the explanatory  remarks beneath them.    The author considers the summaries at the conclusion of the chapters  of much importance. They not only furnish exact and condensed  statements of the main facts and principles involved, but afford the  reader a test of the extent to which the foregoing chapter has been  comprehended. As the author has a horror of what is termed \"cramming,\"  he expresses the hope that no student will use these synopses, which  have been prepared with much care, for so great a misuse of the mind  as cramming implies.    Breathing is essential for life. The oxygen of the air is, of all  food-stuffs, the most important. Without it a mammal will perish in  less than three minutes; hence there is no need of the body so urgent  as that of oxygen. It is also of great moment that the waste--the  carbon dioxide, or carbonic acid gas--should be got rid of rapidly;  nevertheless, it is not this gas which kills when the air-passages are  closed, though it is highly deleterious. The body is a sort of furnace  in which combustions are continually going on, and oxygen is as  essential for these as for the burning of a candle, and the products  are in each case the same.    Whether the voice-user respires, like others, to maintain the  functions of the body, or whether he employs the breathing apparatus  to produce sound, it is to be borne in mind that he uses the same  physical mechanisms, so that the way is at once clear to consider the  anatomy and physiology of the breathing organs.    It has been already pointed out that respiration is in all animals, in  the end, the same process. The one-celled animal and the muscle-cell  respire in the same way, and with the same results--oxidation,  combustion, and resulting waste products. In the animal of complicated  structure special mechanisms are necessary that the essential oxygen  be brought to the blood and the useless carbon dioxide removed. The  respiratory organs or tract include the mouth, nose, larynx, trachea,  bronchial tubes, and the lung-tissue proper or the air-cells.    The mouth, nose, and larynx, in so far as they are of special  importance in voice-production, will be considered later.    The air enters the trachea, or windpipe, through a relatively narrow  slit in the larynx, or voice-box, known as the _glottis_, or _chink of  the glottis_, which is wider when air is being taken in  (_inspiration_) than when it is being expelled (_expiration_). Life  depends on this chink being kept open. The windpipe is composed of a  series of cartilaginous or gristly rings connected together by softer  tissues. These rings are not entire, but are completed behind by soft  tissues including muscle. It follows that this tube is pliable and  extensible--a very important provision, especially when large  movements of the neck are made, during vigorous exercise, and also in  singing and speaking.    The bronchial tubes are the tree-like branches of the trachea, and  extend to the air-cells themselves, which may be considered as built  up around them in some such fashion as a toy balloon on its wooden  stem, but with many infoldings, etc. (Fig. 10). The air-cells are  composed of a membrane which may be compared to the walls of the  balloon, but we are of course dealing with living tissue supplied by  countless blood-vessels of the most minute calibre, in which the blood  is brought very near to the air which passes over them.    Throughout, the respiratory tract is lined with mucous membrane.  Mucous membranes are so named because they secrete mucus, the fluid  which moistens the nose, mouth, and all parts of the respiratory  tract. When one suffers from a cold the mucous membrane, in the early  stages, may become dry from failure of this natural"]]]
