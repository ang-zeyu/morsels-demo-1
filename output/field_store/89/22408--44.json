He wishes you to preferably select from the book \"Prayers and  Meditations\", recently published in America, suitable prayers for a small  edition.    The Guardian wishes me to express his gratification at the news of the  enrolment of three new members in the Sydney Baha'i group, and of two  others in the Auckland community. He will pray that these new believers  may continue deepening in their faith, and in their understanding of the  Teachings, and that each of them may arise and lend every assistance in  his power to the further expansion and firmer consolidation of the Faith  in that far-off continent.    The three reproductions of the Sydney Registration Certificate which you  have mailed under separate cover have been duly received, and one of them  will shortly be placed in the Mansion at Bahji.    The projected visit of Miss Martha Root to your shores next winter, the  Guardian hopes, will as on her previous journeys serve to impart a fresh  stimulus to the friends in Australia and New-Zealand and inspire them with  a renewed determination to re-consecrate themselves to the service of the  Cause. Your Assembly should extend to her a warm welcome and every support  she requires for the success of her mission. May her noble endeavours,  seconded by the energetic and diligent efforts of the believers, result in  inaugurating a new era of teaching expansion throughout the Australian  continent.    With warmest greetings from the Guardian,    Yours in His Service,  H. Rabbani.    [From the Guardian:]    Dear and valued co-workers:    The visit of our dear and cherished sister and exemplary co-worker,  Martha, to your shores is approaching and I feel confident that her  collaboration with you will lend an unprecedented impetus to the  advancement of the Faith. Laden with laurels, animated by an unquenchable  spirit, armed with a faith that none can surpass, she will, I feel sure,  contribute magnificently to the magnificent work her co-workers in  Australia and New Zealand have so valiantly achieved and are so  energetically and methodically extending. My prayers for you and for her  will continue to be offered with a heart filled with pride, joy and  gratitude.    Your true brother,  Shoghi.            LETTER OF FEBRUARY 15TH, 1939      February 15th, 1939.    Dear Miss Brooks:    Your letter of January 17th, enclosing one addressed to the Guardian by  the Sydney Spiritual Assembly, have both duly arrived, and their contents  read by him with deepest satisfaction and with feelings of unbounded  gratitude.    He is writing the Sydney Assembly separately, assuring them that Miss  Davis who is on a world tour, would be most welcome to visit the Holy  Shrines in Haifa and Bahji, but he himself is exceedingly sorry not to be  able to meet her, as he is at present away from the Holy Land, and may not  be back to Haifa before some time. He hopes, nevertheless, Miss Davis will  benefit from her close contact with the Sacred Places of the Faith, and  will gain such experiences as will stimulate still further her interest in  the Cause, and lead her gradually to fully and unreservedly embrace its  truth.    Regarding the extensive preparations made by the N.S.A. in connection with  the teaching travels of our indefatigable and highly-esteemed Baha'i  sister Miss Martha Root throughout Australia and New-Zealand; the Guardian  feels truly delighted and profoundly grateful to your Assembly for the  befitting welcome you have extended to her, and for the arrangements you  have made for her to broadcast her speeches, and to contact as many  individuals and organisations as her time and health permit. You are  certainly fully availing yourself of the opportunity of her presence in  your midst to further intensify the campaign of teaching throughout  Australia, and you can rest assured that Baha'u'llah will reinforce and  bless your endeavours for the accomplishment of so vital and so sacred a  task.    The draft for thirty pounds which you had enclosed in your letter,  representing the contribution of the believers of Australia and  New-Zealand toward the International Fund of the Cause, has been received  with grateful appreciation by our beloved Guardian, and he wishes your  Assembly to kindly convey to all the friends his deep sense of gratitude,  as well as his profound admiration, for the exemplary devotion and loyal  attachment to the Cause that has prompted them to make such generous  donations.    With renewed and heartfelt thanks for your very kind letter, and  reciprocating your greetings,    Yours in His Service,  H. Rabbani.    [From the Guardian:]    Dearly-beloved co-workers:    I am so glad and grateful for the plans you have conceived for the  reception, and organisation of the work, of Martha during her visit to  your shores. The community of the believers in Australia and New Zealand  is making remarkable progress in every phase of its activities, and  deserves the highest praise in its magnificent and incessant labours. I am  proud of the quality of its faith and the range of its achievements. May  the Beloved infuse into each one of its members a greater measure of His  power and of His spirit that will enable them to seek nobler heights in  their historic service to His Cause!    Your true and grateful brother,  Shoghi.            LETTER OF MARCH 17TH, 1939      March 17th, 1939.    Dear Miss Brooks,    Your communication of February the 12th addressed to our beloved Guardian,  informing him of Martha's safe arrival in Australia, has been received,  and he was made truly happy to know how cordially and befittingly she had  been welcomed by the friends. The wide acclamation with which you have  greeted her upon her arrival, and the kind solicitude and warm affection  you have displayed towards her by arranging for dear Dr. Bolton to give  her the necessary treatment soon after her landing in Adelaide--such  spontaneous expressions of your deep set admiration and love for this  valiant and indefatigable star-servant of the Cause must have surely  greatly warmed and touched her heart.    Your N.S.A., no less than the local assemblies of Perth and Adelaide, has  undoubtedly spared no effort to use her presence as an opportunity for  giving the Faith every publicity possible through both the radio and the  press. It is to be hoped that before long the results of this campaign of  publicity will be made apparent, and a good number of sincere and  intelligent inquirers will be led to investigate and seriously study the  Teachings, and enrol later on in the Community.    While the Guardian wishes the friends to take full advantage of Martha's  presence and invite her to speak and teach as frequently as her energies  permit, yet he would advise that they should also take great care lest her  health be seriously impaired through overwork, specially as she is already  so frail, having extensively travelled and tirelessly laboured for a whole  year throughout India. He would further entreat the believers to join him  in ardently supplicating Baha'u'llah to continue bestowing upon our  well-beloved and distinguished sister all the strength and energy that she  requires for the continuation and successful termination of her teaching  tour throughout Australia and New-Zealand.    With reference to Mr. and Mrs. Bolton's request for permission to visit  Haifa during next October or November, the Guardian wishes you to assure  them that they would be most welcome to undertake this pilgrimage through  which, he hopes, they will get refreshed spiritually and filled with  renewed vigour and added determination to labour for the further promotion  of the Faith upon their return home.    With the season's best greetings to you and all the friends,    Yours ever in His Service,  H. Rabbani.    [From the Guardian:]    Dear and valued co-worker:    How deeply I appreciate what you and your dear collaborators are achieving  for the success of Martha's work amidst you. My heart brims over with  gratitude for the manner in which you approach your task, discharge your  duties and extend the range of your local and national activities. With  your deeds you are demonstrating in that far-off continent what the power  of the Greatest Name can achieve when it operates through channels that  are pure, and receptive to its outpouring grace. My prayers are being  continually offered for you all. Rest assured and be happy.    Your true and grateful brother,  Shoghi.            LETTER OF JULY 12TH, 1939      July 12th, 1939.    Dear Miss Brooks,    On behalf of our beloved Guardian I acknowledge with thanks the receipt of  your deeply-appreciated message written on behalf of our Australian  N.S.A., and of various materials, including Assembly reports and  photographs of the Yerrinbool Summer-School, mailed under separate cover,  all of which reached him safely, and for which kindly convey his heart's  deepest gratitude to your Assembly.    He has read with great pleasure the account of Miss Root's last few weeks  in Australia, and feels exceedingly gratified and thankful at this renewed  evidence of the loving hospitality so spontaneously and generously  extended to her by all the friends in each center she visited, and wishes  me, in particular, to convey to you and to dear Mr. and Mrs. Hawthorne his  special thanks for having kindly offered to accompany our precious and  well-beloved sister throughout the last stages of her journey to Melbourne  and Tasmania. May Baha'u'llah richly reward you with His choicest  blessings for all the tender care and affection you lavished upon her all  through her teaching itinerary, and may He sustain, strengthen and guide  you in your endeavours to further enrich and consolidate the notable  teaching results she was able to accomplish in your midst during all these  months.    The Guardian was highly encouraged to hear of the news of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19275"],[0,"God Passes By (#7)"],[1,"and one attendant from  among His followers were allowed to keep Him company in those bleak and  inhospitable surroundings. All-powerful and crafty, that minister had, on  the pretext of the necessity of his master's concentrating his immediate  attention on a recent rebellion in _Kh_urasan and a revolt in Kirman,  succeeded in foiling a plan, which, had it materialized, would have had  the most serious repercussions on his own fortunes, as well as on the  immediate destinies of his government, its ruler and its people.          Chapter II: The Bab's Captivity in Adhirbayjan      The period of the Bab's banishment to the mountains of A_dh_irbayjan,  lasting no less than three years, constitutes the saddest, the most  dramatic, and in a sense the most pregnant phase of His six year ministry.  It comprises His nine months' unbroken confinement in the fortress of  Mah-Ku, and His subsequent incarceration in the fortress of _Ch_ihriq,  which was interrupted only by a brief yet memorable visit to Tabriz. It  was overshadowed throughout by the implacable and mounting hostility of  the two most powerful adversaries of the Faith, the Grand Vizir of  Muhammad _Sh_ah, Haji Mirza Aqasi, and the Amir-Nizam, the Grand Vizir of  Nasiri'd-Din _Sh_ah. It corresponds to the most critical stage of the  mission of Baha'u'llah, during His exile to Adrianople, when confronted  with the despotic Sultan 'Abdu'l-'Aziz and his ministers, 'Ali Pa_sh_a and  Fu'ad Pa_sh_a, and is paralleled by the darkest days of 'Abdu'l-Baha's  ministry in the Holy Land, under the oppressive rule of the tyrannical  'Abdu'l-Hamid and the equally tyrannical Jamal Pa_sh_a. _Sh_iraz had been  the memorable scene of the Bab's historic Declaration; Isfahan had  provided Him, however briefly, with a haven of relative peace and  security; whilst A_dh_irbayjan was destined to become the theatre of His  agony and martyrdom. These concluding years of His earthly life will go  down in history as the time when the new Dispensation attained its full  stature, when the claim of its Founder was fully and publicly asserted,  when its laws were formulated, when the Covenant of its Author was firmly  established, when its independence was proclaimed, and when the heroism of  its champions blazed forth in immortal glory. For it was during these  intensely dramatic, fate-laden years that the full implications of the  station of the Bab were disclosed to His disciples, and formally announced  by Him in the capital of A_dh_irbayjan, in the presence of the Heir to the  Throne; that the Persian Bayan, the repository of the laws ordained by the  Bab, was revealed; that the time and character of the Dispensation of \"the  One Whom God will make manifest\" were unmistakably determined; that the  Conference of Bada_sh_t proclaimed the annulment of the old order; and  that the great conflagrations of Mazindaran, of Nayriz and of Zanjan were  kindled.    And yet, the foolish and short-sighted Haji Mirza Aqasi fondly imagined  that by confounding the plan of the Bab to meet the _Sh_ah face to face in  the capital, and by relegating Him to the farthest corner of the realm, he  had stifled the Movement at its birth, and would soon conclusively triumph  over its Founder. Little did he imagine that the very isolation he was  forcing upon his Prisoner would enable Him to evolve the System designed  to incarnate the soul of His Faith, and would afford Him the opportunity  of safeguarding it from disintegration and schism, and of proclaiming  formally and unreservedly His mission. Little did he imagine that this  very confinement would induce that Prisoner's exasperated disciples and  companions to cast off the shackles of an antiquated theology, and  precipitate happenings that would call forth from them a prowess, a  courage, a self-renunciation unexampled in their country's history. Little  did he imagine that by this very act he would be instrumental in  fulfilling the authentic tradition ascribed to the Prophet of Islam  regarding the inevitability of that which should come to pass in  A_dh_irbayjan. Untaught by the example of the governor of _Sh_iraz, who,  with fear and trembling, had, at the first taste of God's avenging wrath,  fled ignominiously and relaxed his hold on his Captive, the Grand Vizir of  Muhammad _Sh_ah was, in his turn, through the orders he had issued,  storing up for himself severe and inevitable disappointment, and paving  the way for his own ultimate downfall.    His orders to 'Ali _Kh_an, the warden of the fortress of Mah-Ku, were  stringent and explicit. On His way to that fortress the Bab passed a  number of days in Tabriz, days that were marked by such an intense  excitement on the part of the populace that, except for a few persons,  neither the public nor His followers were allowed to meet Him. As He was  escorted through the streets of the city the shout of \"Allah-u-Akbar\"  resounded on every side. So great, indeed, became the clamor that the town  crier was ordered to warn the inhabitants that any one who ventured to  seek the Bab's presence would forfeit all his possessions and be  imprisoned. Upon His arrival in Mah-Ku, surnamed by Him Jabal-i-Basit (the  Open Mountain) no one was allowed to see Him for the first two weeks  except His amanuensis, Siyyid Husayn, and his brother. So grievous was His  plight while in that fortress that, in the Persian Bayan, He Himself has  stated that at night-time He did not even have a lighted lamp, and that  His solitary chamber, constructed of sun-baked bricks, lacked even a door,  while, in His Tablet to Muhammad _Sh_ah, He has complained that the  inmates of the fortress were confined to two guards and four dogs.    Secluded on the heights of a remote and dangerously situated mountain on  the frontiers of the Ottoman and Russian empires; imprisoned within the  solid walls of a four-towered fortress; cut off from His family, His  kindred and His disciples; living in the vicinity of a bigoted and  turbulent community who, by race, tradition, language and creed, differed  from the vast majority of the inhabitants of Persia; guarded by the people  of a district which, as the birthplace of the Grand Vizir, had been made  the recipient of the special favors of his administration, the Prisoner of  Mah-Ku seemed in the eyes of His adversary to be doomed to languish away  the flower of His youth, and witness, at no distant date, the complete  annihilation of His hopes. That adversary was soon to realize, however,  how gravely he had misjudged both his Prisoner and those on whom he had  lavished his favors. An unruly, a proud and unreasoning people were  gradually subdued by the gentleness of the Bab, were chastened by His  modesty, were edified by His counsels, and instructed by His wisdom. They  were so carried away by their love for Him that their first act every  morning, notwithstanding the remonstrations of the domineering 'Ali  _Kh_an, and the repeated threats of disciplinary measures received from  Tihran, was to seek a place where they could catch a glimpse of His face,  and beseech from afar His benediction upon their daily work. In cases of  dispute it was their wont to hasten to the foot of the fortress, and, with  their eyes fixed upon His abode, invoke His name, and adjure one another  to speak the truth. 'Ali _Kh_an himself, under the influence of a strange  vision, felt such mortification that he was impelled to relax the severity  of his discipline, as an atonement for his past behavior. Such became his  leniency that an increasing stream of eager and devout pilgrims began to  be admitted at the gates of the fortress. Among them was the dauntless and  indefatigable Mulla Husayn, who had walked on foot the entire way from  Ma_sh_ad in the east of Persia to Mah-Ku, the westernmost outpost of the  realm, and was able, after so arduous a journey, to celebrate the festival  of Naw-Ruz (1848) in the company of his Beloved.    Secret agents, however, charged to watch 'Ali _Kh_an, informed Haji Mirza  Aqasi of the turn events were taking, whereupon he immediately decided to  transfer the Bab to the fortress of _Ch_ihriq (about April 10, 1848),  surnamed by Him the Jabal-i-_Sh_adid (the Grievous Mountain). There He was  consigned to the keeping of Yahya _Kh_an, a brother-in-law of Muhammad  _Sh_ah. Though at the outset he acted with the utmost severity, he was  eventually compelled to yield to the fascination of his Prisoner. Nor were  the kurds, who lived in the village of _Ch_ihriq, and whose hatred of the  _Sh_i'ahs exceeded even that of the inhabitants of Mah-Ku, able to resist  the pervasive power of the Prisoner's influence. They too were to be seen  every morning, ere they started for their daily work, to approach the  fortress and prostrate themselves in adoration before its holy Inmate. \"So  great was the confluence of the people,\" is the testimony of a European  eye-witness, writing in his memoirs of the Bab, \"that the courtyard, not  being large enough to contain His hearers, the majority remained in the  street and listened with rapt attention to the verses of the new Qur'an.\"    Indeed the turmoil raised in _Ch_ihriq eclipsed the scenes which Mah-Ku  had witnessed. Siyyids of distinguished merit, eminent 'ulamas, and even  government officials were boldly and rapidly espousing the Cause of the  Prisoner. The conversion of the zealous, the famous Mirza Asadu'llah,  surnamed Dayyan, a prominent official of high literary repute, who was  endowed by the Bab with the \"hidden and preserved knowledge,\" and extolled  as the \"repository of the trust of the one true God,\" and the arrival of a  dervish, a former navvab, from India, whom the Bab in a vision had bidden  renounce wealth and position, and hasten on foot to meet Him in  A_dh_irbayjan, brought the situation to a head. Accounts of these  startling events reached Tabriz, were thence communicated to Tihran, and  forced Haji Mirza Aqasi again to intervene. "]]]
