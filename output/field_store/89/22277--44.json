My uncle being one of the  stockholders, through him my mother became acquainted with these  people, and thus we had many opportunities of seeing and knowing  something of the fraternity.    About this time I became noted in school as a reader, where before I  had only been remarkable for my arithmetic, the medal for which could  never be taken from me.  I remember on one occasion reading a scene  from Howard Payne's tragedy of \"Brutus,\" in which Brutus speaks, and  the immediate result was my elevation to the head of the class to the  evident disgust of my competitors, who grumbled out, \"No wonder she  can read, she goes to the theatre!\"  I had been before this very shy  and reserved, not to say stupid, about reading in school, afraid of  the sound of my own voice, and very unwilling to trust it; but the  greater familiarity with the theatre seemed suddenly to unloose my  tongue, and give birth as it were to a faculty which has been the  ruling passion ever since.        PLAYS LADY MACBETH, HER FIRST PART    With the Maeders I went [in 1836, when twenty years of age] to New  Orleans, and sang until, owing perhaps to my youth, to change of  climate, or to a too great strain upon the upper register of my voice,  which, as his wife's voice was a contralto, it was more to Mr.  Maeder's interest to use, than the lower one, I found my voice  suddenly failing me.  In my unhappiness I went to ask counsel and  advice of Mr. Caldwell, the manager of the chief New Orleans theatre,  He at once said to me, \"You ought to be an actress, and not a singer.\"  He advised me to study some parts, and presented me to Mr. Barton, the  tragedian of the theatre, whom he asked to hear me, and to take an  interest in me.    He was very kind, as indeed they both were; and Mr. Barton, after a  short time, was sufficiently impressed with my powers to propose to  Mr. Caldwell that I should act Lady Macbeth to his Macbeth, on the  occasion of his (Barton's) benefit.  Upon this is was decided that I  should give up singing and take to acting.  My contract with Mr.  Maeder was annulled, it being the end of the season.  So enraptured  was I with the idea of acting this part, and so fearful of anything  preventing me, that I did not tell the manager I had no dresses, until  it was too late for me to be prevented from acting it; and the day  before the performance, after rehearsal, I told him.  He immediately  sat down and wrote a note of introduction for me to the tragedienne of  the French Theatre, which then employed some of the best among French  artists for its company.  This note was to ask her to help me to  costumes for the role of Lady Macbeth, I was a tall, thin, lanky girl  at that time, about five feet six inches in height.  The Frenchwoman,  Madame Closel, was a short, fat person of not more than four feet ten  inches, her waist full twice the size of mine, with a very large bust;  but her shape did not prevent her being a very great actress.  The  ludicrousness of her clothes being made to fit me struck her at once.  She roared with laughter; but she was very good-natured, saw my  distress, and set to work to see to how she could help it.  By dint of  piecing out the skirt of one dress it was made to answer for an  underskirt, and then another dress was taken in in every direction to  do duty as an overdress, and so make up the costume.  And thus I  essayed for the first time the part of Lady Macbeth, fortunately to  the satisfaction of the audience, the manager, and all the members of  the company.        TO A YOUNG ACTRESS [PART OF A LETTER]    ...  I should advise you to get to work; all ideal study of acting,  without the trial or opportunity of trying our efforts and conceivings  upon others, is, in my mind, lost time.  Study while you act.  Your  conception of character can be formed while you read your part, and  only practice can tell you whether you are right.  You would, after a  year of study in your own room, come out unbenefited, save in as far  as self-communion ever must make us better and stronger; but this is  not what you want just now.  Action is needed.  Your vitality must in  some measure work itself off.  You must suffer, labour, and wait,  before you will be able to grasp the true and the beautiful.  You  dream of it now; the intensity of life that is in you, the spirit of  poetry which makes itself heard by you in indistinct language, needs  work to relieve itself and be made clear.  I feel diffident about  giving advice to you, for you know your own nature better than any one  else can, but I should say to you, get to work in the best way you  can.    All your country work will be wretched; you will faint by the way; but  you must rouse your great strength and struggle on, bearing patiently  your cross on the way to your crown!  God bless you and prosper your  undertakings.  I know the country theatres well enough to know how  utterly alone you will be in such companies; but keep up a good heart;  we have only to do well what is given us to do, to find heaven.    I think if you have to wait for a while it will do you no harm.  You  seem to me quite frantic for immediate work; but teach yourself quiet  and repose in the time you are waiting.  With half your strength I  could bear to wait and labour with myself to conquer fretting.  The  greatest power in the world is shown in conquest over self.  More life  will be worked out of you by fretting than all the stage-playing in  the world.  God bless you, my poor child.  You have indeed troubles  enough; but you have a strong and earnest spirit, and you have the  true religion of labour in your heart.  Therefore I have no fears for  you, let what will come.  Let me hear from you at your leisure, and be  sure you have no warmer friend than I am and wish to be,...    I was exceedingly pleased to hear such an account of your first  appearance.  You were quite right in all that was done, and I am  rejoiced at your success.  Go on; persevere.  You will be sure to do  what is right, for your heart is in the right place, your head is  sound, your reading has been good.  Your mind is so much better and  stronger than any other person's whom I have known enter the  profession, that your career is plain before you.    But I will advise you to remain in your own native town for a season,  or at least the winter.  You say you are afraid of remaining among  people who know you.  Don't have this feeling at all.  You will have  to be more particular in what you do, and the very feeling that you  cannot be indifferent to your audience will make you take more pains.  Beside this, you will be at home, which is much better for a time; for  then at first you do not have to contend with a strange home as well  as with a strange profession.  I could talk to you a volume upon this  matter, but it is difficult to write.  At all events I hope you will  take my counsel and remain at home this winter.  It is the most  wretched thing imaginable to go from home a novice into such a theatre  as any of those in the principal towns.    Only go on and work hard, and you will be sure to make a good  position.  With regard to your faults, what shall I say?  Why, that  you will try hard to overcome them.  I don't think they would be  perceived save by those who perhaps imagine that your attachment for  me has induced you to join the profession.  I have no mannerisms, I  hope; therefore any imitation of me can only be in the earnest desire  to do what you can do, as well as you can.  Write to me often; ask of  me what you will; my counsel is worth little, but you shall command it  if you need it.        TO A YOUNG MOTHER    [FROM A LETTER]    ...  All that you say about your finding your own best expression in  and through the little life which is confided to you is good and true,  and I am so happy to see how you feel on the subject.  I think a  mother who devotes herself to her child, in watching its culture and  keeping it from baleful influences, is educating and cultivating  herself at the same time.  No artist work is so high, so noble, so  grand, so enduring, so important for all time, as the making of  character in a child, You have your own work to do, the largest  possible expression.  No statue, no painting, no acting, can reach it,  and it embodies each and all the arts, Clay of God's fashioning is  given into your hands to mould to perfectness.  Is this not something  grand to think of?  No matter about yourself--only make yourself  worthy of God's sacred trust, and you will be doing His work--and that  is all that human beings ought to care to live for.  Am I right?        EARLY GRIEFS.  ART HER ONLY SPOUSE    [FROM A LETTER TO A FRIEND]    There was a time, in my life of girlhood, when I thought I had been  called upon to bear the very hardest thing that can come to a Woman.  A very short time served to show me, in the harder battle of life  Which was before me, that this had been but a spring storm, which was  simply to help me to a clearer, better, richer, and more productive  summer.  If I had been spared this early trial, I should never have  been so earnest and faithful in my art; I should have still been  casting about for the \"counterpart,\" and not given my entire self to  my work, wherein and alone I have reached any excellence I have ever  attained, and through which alone I have received my reward.  God  helped me in my art isolation, and rewarded me for recognising him and  helping myself.  This passed on; and this happened at a period in my  life when most women (or children, rather) are looking to but one end  in life--an end no doubt wisest and best for the largest number, but  which would not have been wisest and best for my work, and so for  God's work, for I know he does not fail to set me his work to do, and  helps me to do it, and helps others to help me.  (Do you see this  tracing back, and then forward, to an "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17024"],[0,"The Last Journals of David Livingstone, in Central Africa, from 1865 to His (#7)"],[1,"f: \"Catch the thief and bring him to me, one who steals a person is  a pig,\" said Mohamad. Stealing, however, began on our side, a slave  purloining a fowl, so they had good reason to enjoin honesty on us! They  think that we have come to kill them: we light on them as if from  another world: no letters come to tell who we are, or what we want. We  cannot conceive their state of isolation and helplessness, with nothing  to trust to but their charms and idols--both being bits of wood. I got a  large beetle hung up before an idol in the idol house of a deserted and  burned village; the guardian was there, but the village destroyed.    I presented the two brothers with two table cloths, four bunches of  beads, and one string of neck-beads; they were well satisfied.    A wood here when burned emits a horrid faecal smell, and one would think  the camp polluted if one fire was made of it. I had a house built for me  because the village huts are inconvenient, low in roof, and low  doorways; the men build them, and help to cultivate the soil, but the  women have to keep them well filled with firewood and supplied with  water. They carry the wood, and almost everything else in large baskets,  hung to the shoulders, like the Edinburgh fishwives. A man made a long  loud prayer to Mulungu last night after dark for rain.    The sons of Moenekuss have but little of their father's power, but they  try to behave to strangers as he did. All our people are in terror of  the Manyema, or Manyuema, man-eating fame: a woman's child had crept  into a quiet corner of the hut to eat a banana--she could not find him,  and at once concluded that the Manyuema had kidnapped him to eat him,  and with a yell she ran through the camp and screamed at the top of her  shrill voice, \"Oh, the Manyuema have stolen my child to make meat of  him! Oh, my child eaten--oh, oh!\"    _26th-28th September, 1869._--A Lunda slave-girl was sent off to be sold  for a tusk, but the Manyuema don't want slaves, as we were told in  Lunda, for they are generally thieves, and otherwise bad characters. It  is now clouded over and preparing for rain, when sun comes overhead.  Small-pox comes every three or four years, and kills many of the people.  A soko alive was believed to be a good charm for rain; so one was  caught, and the captor had the ends of two fingers and toes bitten off.  The soko or gorillah always tries to bite off these parts, and has been  known to overpower a young man and leave him without the ends of fingers  and toes. I saw the nest of one: it is a poor contrivance; no more  architectural skill shown than in the nest of our Cushat dove.    _29th September, 1869._--I visited a hot fountain, an hour west of our  camp, which has five eyes, temperature 150 deg., slightly saline taste, and  steam issues constantly. It is called Kasugwe Colambu. Earthquakes are  well known, and to the Manyuema they seem to come from the east to west;  pots rattle and fowls cackle on these occasions.    _2nd October, 1869._--A rhinoceros was shot, and party sent off to the  River Luamo to buy ivory.    _5th October, 1869._--An elephant was killed, and the entire population  went off to get meat, which was given freely at first, but after it was  known how eagerly the Manyuema sought it, six or eight goats were  demanded for a carcase and given.    _9th October, 1869._--The rite of circumcision is general among all the  Manyuema; it is performed on the young. If a headman's son is to be  operated on, it is tried on a slave first; certain times of the year are  unpropitious, as during a drought for instance; but having by this  experiment ascertained the proper time, they go into the forest, beat  drums, and feast as elsewhere: contrary to all African custom they are  not ashamed to speak about the rite, even before women.    Two very fine young men came to visit me to-day. After putting several  preparatory inquiries as to where our country lay, &c., they asked  whether people died with us, and where they went to after death. \"Who  kills them?\" \"Have you no charm (Buanga) against death?\" It is not  necessary to answer such questions save in a land never visited by  strangers. Both had the \"organs of intelligence\" largely developed. I  told them that we prayed to the Great Father, \"Mulungu,\" and He hears us  all; they thought this to be natural.    _14th October, 1869._--An elephant killed was of the small variety, and  only 5 feet 8 inches high at the withers. The forefoot was in  circumference 3 feet 9 inches, which doubled gives 7 feet 6 inches; this  shows a deviation from the usual rule \"twice round the forefoot = the  height of the animal.\" Heart 1-1/2 foot long, tusks 6 feet 8 inches in  length.    _15th October, 1869._--Fever better, and thankful. Very cold and rainy.    _18th October, 1869._--Our Hassani returned from Moene Kirumbo's; then  one of Dugumbe's party (also called Hassani) seized ten goats and ten  slaves before leaving, though great kindness had been shown: this is  genuine Suaheli or Nigger-Moslem tactics--four of his people were killed  in revenge.    A whole regiment of Soldier ants in my hut were put into a panic by a  detachment of Driver ants called Sirufu. The Chungu or black soldiers  rushed out with their eggs and young, putting them down and running for  more. A dozen Sirafu pitched on one Chungu and killed him. The Chungu  made new quarters for themselves. When the white ants cast off their  colony of winged emigrants a canopy is erected like an umbrella over the  ant-hill. As soon as the ants fly against the roof they tumble down in a  shower and their wings instantly become detached from their bodies. They  are then helpless, and are swept up in baskets to be fried, when they  make a very palatable food.    [Illustration: Catching Ants.]    _24th-25th October, 1869._--Making copper rings, as these are highly  prized by Manyuema. Mohamad's Tembe fell. It had been begun on an  unlucky day, the 26th of the moon; and on another occasion on the same  day, he had fifty slaves swept away by a sudden flood of a dry river in  the Obena country: they are great observers of lucky and unlucky days.

Our course was west and  south-west, through a country surpassingly beautiful, mountainous, and  villages perched on the talus of each great mass for the sake of quick  drainage. The streets often run east and west, in order that the bright  blazing sun may lick up the moisture quickly from off them. The dwelling  houses are generally in line, with public meeting houses at each end,  opposite the middle of the street, the roofs are low, but well thatched  with a leaf resembling the banana leaf, but more tough; it seems from  its fruit to be a species of Euphorbia. The leaf-stack has a notch made  in it of two or three inches lengthways, and this hooks on to the  rafters, which are often of the leaf-stalks of palms, split up so as to  be thin; the water runs quickly off this roof, and the walls, which are  of well-beaten clay, are screened from the weather. Inside, the  dwellings are clean and comfortable, and before the Arabs came bugs were  unknown--as I have before observed, one may know where these people have  come by the presence or absence of these nasty vermin: the human tick,  which infests all Arab and Suaheli houses, is to the Manyuema unknown.    In some cases, where the south-east rains are abundant, the Manyuema  place the back side of the houses to this quarter, and prolong the low  roof down, so that the rain does not reach the walls. These clay walls  stand for ages, and men often return to the villages they left in  infancy and build again the portions that many rains have washed away.  The country generally is of clayey soil, and suitable for building. Each  housewife has from twenty-five to thirty earthen pots slung to the  ceiling by very neat cord-swinging tressels; and often as many neatly  made baskets hung up in the same fashion, and much firewood.    _5th November, 1869._--In going we crossed the River Luela, of twenty  yards in width, five times, in a dense dripping forest. The men of one  village always refused to accompany us to the next set of hamlets, \"They  were at war, and afraid of being killed and eaten.\" They often came five  or six miles through the forests that separate the districts, but "]]]
