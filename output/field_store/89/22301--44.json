In the night a legion of field-mice came forth, whence no one  knew, and, noiselessly spreading throughout the camp of the Assyrians,  gnawed the quivers, the bowstrings, and the straps of the bucklers in  such a way that, on the morrow, the enemy, finding themselves disarmed,  fled after a mere pretence at resistance, and suffered severe losses. A  statue was long shown in the temple at Memphis portraying this Sethon:  he was represented holding a mouse in his hand, and the inscription bade  men reverence the god who had wrought this miracle.*         * The statue with which this legend has been connected, must       have represented a king offering the image of a mouse       crouching on a basket, like the cynocephalus on the       hieroglyphic sign which denotes centuries, or the frog of       the goddess Hiqit. Historians have desired to recognise in       Sethon a King Zet of the XXIIIth dynasty, or even Shabitoku       of the XXVth dynasty; Krall identified him with Satni in the       demotic story of Satni-Umois.    The disaster was a terrible one: Sennacherib's triumphant advance was  suddenly checked, and he was forced to return to Asia when the goal of  his ambition was almost reached. The loss of a single army, however much  to be deplored, was not irreparable, since Assyria could furnish her  sovereign with a second force as numerous as that which lay buried in  the desert on the road to Egypt, but it was uncertain what effect the  news of the calamity and the sight of the survivors might have on the  minds of his subjects and rivals. The latter took no immediate action,  and the secret joy which they must have experienced did not blind them  to the real facts of the case; for though the power of Assyria was  shaken, she was still stronger than any one of them severally, or even  than all of them together, and to attack her or rebel against her now,  was to court defeat with as much certainty as in past days. The Pharaoh  kept himself behind his rivers; the military science and skill which had  baffled his generals on the field of Altaku did not inspire him with any  desire to reappear on the plains of Palestine. Hezekiah, King of Judah,  had emptied his treasury to furnish his ransom, his strongholds had  capitulated one by one, and his territory, diminished by the loss of  some of the towns of the Shephelah, was little botter than a waste of  smoking ruins. He thought himself fortunate to have preserved his power  under the suzerainty of Assyria, and his sole aim for many years was  to refill his treasury, reconstitute his army, and re-establish his  kingdom. The Philistine and Nabatasan princes, and the chiefs of Moab,  Ammon, and Idumsea, had nothing to gain by war, being too feeble to have  any chance of success without the help of Judah, Tyre, and Egypt. The  Syrians maintained a peaceful attitude, which was certainly their wisest  policy; and during the following quarter of a century they loyally  obeyed their governors, and gave Sennacherib no cause to revisit them.  It was fortunate for him that they did so, for the peoples of the North  and East, the Kalda, and, above all, the Elamites, were the cause of  much trouble, and exclusively occupied his attention during several  years. The inhabitants of Bit-Yakin, urged on either by their natural  restlessness or by the news of the misfortune which had befallen their  enemy, determined once more to try the fortunes of war. Incited by  Marduk-ushezlb,* one of their princes, and by Merodach-baladan, these  people of the marshes intrigued with the courts of Babylon and Susa,  and were emboldened to turn against the Assyrian garrisons stationed  in their midst to preserve order. Sennacherib's vengeance fell first on  Marduk-ushezib, who fled from his stronghold of Bittutu after sustaining  a short siege. Merodach-baladan, deserted by his accomplice, put the  statues of his gods and his royal treasures on board his fleet, and  embarking with his followers, crossed the lagoon, and effected a landing  in the district of Nagitu, in Susian territory, beyond the mouth of  the Ulai.** Sennacherib entered Bit-Yakin without striking a blow, and  completed the destruction of the half-deserted town; he next proceeded  to demolish the other cities one after the other, carrying off into  captivity all the men and cattle who fell in his way.         * Three kings of Babylon at this period bore very similar       names--Marduk-ushezib, Nergal-ushezib, and Mushezib-marduk.       Nergal-ushezib is the elder of the two whom the texts call       Shuzub, and whom Assyriologists at first confused one with       another.         ** Nagitu was bounded by the Nar-Marratum and the Ulai,       which allows us to identify it with the territory south of       Edrisieh.    The Elamites, disconcerted by the rapidity of his action, allowed him to  crush their allies unopposed; and as they had not openly intervened, the  conqueror refrained from calling them to account for their intrigues.  Babylon paid the penalty for all: its sovereign, Belibni, who had failed  to make the sacred authority of the suzerain respected in the city, and  who, perhaps, had taken some part in the conspiracy, was with his  family deported to Nineveh, and his vacant throne was given to  Assur-nadin-shumu, a younger son of Sargon (699 B.C.).*         * Berosus, misled by the deposition of Belibni, thought that       the expedition was directed against Babylon itself; he has       likewise confounded Assur-nadin-shumu with Esar-haddon, and       he has given this latter, whom he calls Asordancs, as the       immediate successor of Belibni. The date 699 B.C. for these       events is indicated in _Pinches' Babylonian Chronicle_,       which places them in the third year of Belibni.    Order was once more restored in Karduniash, but Sennacherib felt that  its submission would be neither sincere nor permanent, so long as  Merodach-baladan was hovering on its frontier possessed of an army, a  fleet, and a supply of treasure, and prepared to enter the lists as soon  as circumstances seemed favourable to his cause. Sennacherib resolved,  therefore, to cross the head of the Persian Gulf and deal him such a  blow as would once for all end the contest; but troubles which broke out  on the Urartian frontier as soon as he returned forced, him to put off  his project. The tribes of Tumurru, who had placed their strongholds  like eyries among the peaks of Nipur, had been making frequent descents  on the plains of the Tigris, which they had ravaged unchecked by any  fear of Assyrian power. Sennacherib formed an entrenched camp at the  foot of their mountain retreat, and there left the greater part of his  army, while he set out on an adventurous expedition with a picked  body of infantry and cavalry. Over ravines and torrents, up rough and  difficult slopes, they made their way, the king himself being conveyed  in a litter, as there were no roads practicable for his royal chariot;  he even deigned to walk when the hillsides were too steep for his  bearers to carry him; he climbed like a goat, slept on the bare rocks,  drank putrid water from a leathern bottle, and after many hardships at  length came up with the enemy. He burnt their villages, and carried  off herds of cattle and troops of captives; but this exploit was more  a satisfaction of his vanity than a distinct advantage gained, for the  pillaging of the plains of the Tigris probably recommenced as soon as  the king had quitted the country. The same year he pushed as far as  Dayaini, here similar tactics were employed. Constructing a camp in the  neighbourhood of Mount Anara and Mount Uppa, he forced his way to the  capital, Ukki, traversing a complicated network of gorges and forests  which had hitherto been considered impenetrable. The king, Maniya,  fled; Ukki was taken by assault and pillaged, the spoil obtained from it  slightly exceeding that from Tumurru (699 B.C.). Shortly afterwards the  province of Tulgarimme revolted in concert with the Tabal: Sennacherib  overcame the allied forces, and led his victorious regiments through the  defiles of the Taurus.*         * The dates of and connection between these two wars are not       determined with any certainty. Some authorities assign them       both to the same year, somewhere between 699 and 696 B.C.,       while others assign them to two different years, the first       to 699 or 696 B.C., the second to 698 or 695 B.C.

Greek pirates or colonists having ventured from time to time to ravage  the seaboard, he destroyed one of their fleets near the mouth of the  Saros, and took advantage of his sojourn in this region to fortify  the two cities of Tarsus and Ankhiale, to defend his Cilician frontier  against the peoples of Asia Minor.*         * The encounter of the Assyrians with the Greeks is only       known to us from a fragment of Berosus. The foundation of       Tarsus is definitely attributed to Sennacherib in the same       passage; that of Ankhialc is referred to the fabulous       Sardanapalus, but most historians with much probability       attribute the foundation to Sennacherib.    This was a necessary precaution, for the whole of Asia Minor was just  then stirred by the inrush of new nations which were devastating the  country, and the effect of these convulsions was beginning to be felt  in the country to the south of the central plain, at the foot of the  Taurus, and on the frontiers of the Assyrian empire. Barbarian hordes,  attracted by the fame of the ancient Hittite sanctuaries in the upper  basin of the Euphrates and the Araxes, had descended now and again to  measure their strength against the advanced posts of Assyria or Urartu,  but had subsequently withdrawn and disappeared beyond the Halys.

All the Magi were not necessarily devoted to the priesthood; but  those only became apt in the execution of their functions who had been  dedicated to them from infancy, and who, having received the necessary  instruction, were duly consecrated. These adepts were divided into  several classes, of which three at least were never confounded in their  functions--the sorcerers, the interpreters of dreams, and the most  venerated sages--and from these three classes were chosen the ruling  body of the order and its supreme head. Their rule of life was  strict and austere, and was encumbered with a thousand observances  indispensable to the preservation of perfect purity in their persons,  their altars, their victims, and their sacrificial vessels and  implements. The Magi of highest rank abstained from every form of  living thing as food, and the rest only partook of meat under certain  restrictions. Their dress was unpretentious, they wore no jewels, and  observed strict fidelity to the marriage vow;* and the virtues with  which they were accredited obtained for them, from very early times,  unbounded influence over the minds of the common people as well as over  those of the nobles: the king himself boasted of being their pupil, and  took no serious step in state affairs without consulting Ahura-mazda or  the other gods by their mediation. The classical writers maintain that  the Magi often cloaked monstrous vices under their apparent strictness,  and it is possible that this was the case in later days, but even then  moral depravity was probably rather the exception than the rule among  them:*** the majority of the Magi faithfully observed the rules of  honest living and ceremonial purity enjoined on them in the books handed  down by their ancestors.         * Clement of Alexandria assures us that they were strictly       celibate, but besides the fact that married Magi are       mentioned several times, celibacy is still considered by       Zoroastrians an inferior state to that of marriage.         ** In the Greek period, a spurious epitaph of Darius, son of       Hystaspes, was quoted, in which the king says of himself, \"I       was the pupil of the Magi.\"         *** These accusations are nearly all directed against their       incestuous marriages: it seems that the classical writers       took for a refinement of debauchery what really was before       all things a religious practice.    There is reason to believe that the Magi were all-powerful among the  Medes, and that the reign of Astyages was virtually the reign of the  priestly caste; but all the Iranian states did not submit so patiently  to their authority, and the Persians at last proved openly refractory.  Their kings, lords of Susa as well as of Pasargadse, wielded all the  resources of Elam, and their military power must have equalled, if it  did not already surpass, that of their suzerain lords. Their tribes,  less devoted to the manner of living of the Assyrians and Chaldaeans,  had preserved a vigour and power of endurance which the Medes no longer  possessed; and they needed but an ambitious and capable leader, to rise  rapidly from the rank of subjects to that of rulers of Iran, and to  become in a short time masters of Asia. Such a chief they found in  Cyrus,* son of Cambyses; but although no more illustrious name than his  occurs in the list of the founders of mighty empires, the history of no  other has suffered more disfigurement from the imagination of his own  subjects or from the rancour of the nations he had conquered.**         * The original form of the name is Kuru, Kurush, with a long       _o_, which forces us to reject the proposed connection with       the name of the Indian hero Kuru, in which the _u_ is short.       Numerous etymologies of the name Cyrus have been proposed.       The Persians themselves attributed to it the sense of _the       Sun_.         ** We possess two entirely different versions of the history       of the origin of Cyrus, but one, that of Herodotus, has       reached us intact, while that of Ctesias is only known to us       in fragments from extracts made by Nicolas of Damascus, and       by Photius. Spiegel and Duncker thought to recognise in the       tradition followed by Ctesias one of the Persian accounts of       the history of Cyrus, but Bauer refuses to admit this       hypothesis, and prefers to consider it as a romance put       together by the author, according to the taste of his own       times, from facts partly different from those utilised by       Herodotus, and partly borrowed from Herodotus himself: but       it should very probably be regarded as an account of Median       origin, in which the founder of the Persian empire is       portrayed in the most unfavourable light. Or perhaps it may       be regarded as the form of the legend current among the       Pharnaspids who established themselves as satraps of       Dascylium in the time of the Achaemenids, and to whom the       royal house of Cappadocia traced its origin. It is almost       certain that the account given by Herodotus represents a       Median version of the legend, and, considering the important       part played in it by Harpagus, probably that version which       was current among the descendants of that nobleman. The       historian Dinon, as far as we can judge from the extant       fragments of his work, and from the abridgment made by       Trogus Pompeius, adopted the narrative of Ctesias, mingling       with it, however, some details taken from Herodotus and the       romance of Xenophon, the Cyropodia.    The Medes, who could not forgive him for having made them subject to  their ancient vassals, took delight in holding him up to scorn, and not  being able to deny the fact of his triumph, explained it by the adoption  of tortuous and despicable methods. They would not even allow that he  was of royal birth, but asserted that he was of ignoble origin, the son  of a female goatherd and a certain Atradates,* who, belonging to  the savage clan of the Mardians, lived by brigandage. Cyrus himself,  according to this account, spent his infancy and early youth in a  condition not far short of slavery, employed at first in sweeping out  the exterior portions of the palace, performing afterwards the same  office in the private apartments, subsequently promoted to the charge of  the lamps and torches, and finally admitted to the number of the royal  cupbearers who filled the king's goblet at table.         * According to one of the historians consulted by Strabo,       Cyrus himself, and not his father, was called Atradates.    [Illustration: 039.jpg A ROYAL HUNTING-PARTY IN HUN]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from the silver vase in the Museum       of the Hermitage.    When he was at length enrolled in the bodyguard,* he won distinction by  his skill in all military exercises, and having risen from rank to rank,  received command of an expedition against the Cadusians.         * The tradition reproduced by Dinon narrated that Cyrus had       begun by serving among the Kavasses, the three hundred       staff-bearers who accompanied the sovereign when he appeared       in public, and that he passed next into the royal body-       guard, and that once having attained this rank, he passed       rapidly through all the superior grades of the military       profession.    On the march he fell in with a Persian groom named OEbaras,* who  had been cruelly scourged for some misdeed, and was occupied in the  transportation of manure in a boat: in obedience to an oracle the two  united their fortunes, and together devised a vast scheme for liberating  their compatriots from the Median yoke.         * This OEbaras whom Ctesias makes the accomplice of Cyrus,       seems to be an antedated forestallment of theoebaras whom       the tradition followed by Herodotus knows as master of the       horse under Darius, and to whom that king owed his elevation       to the throne.    How Atradates secretly prepared the revolt of the Mardians; how Cyrus  left his camp to return to the court at Ecbatana, and obtained from  Astyages permission to repair to his native country under pretext of  offering sacrifices, but in reality to place himself at the head of the  conspirators; how, finally, the indiscretion of a woman revealed the  whole plot to a eunuch of the harem, and how he warned Astyages in the  middle of his evening banquet by means of a musician or singing-girl,  was frequently narrated by the Median bards in their epic poems, and  hence the story spread until it reached in later times even as far as  the Greeks.*         * According to Ctesias, it was a singing-girl who revealed       the existence of the plot to Astyages; according to Dinon,       it was the bard Angares. Windischmann has compared this name       with that of the Vedic guild of singers, the Angira.    Astyages, roused to action by the danger, abandons the pleasures of the  chase in which his activity had hitherto found vent, sets out on the  track of the rebel, wins a preliminary victory on the Hyrba, and kills  the father of Cyrus: some days after, he again overtakes the rebels, at  the entrance to the defiles leading to Pasargadse, and for the second  time fortune is on the point of declaring in his favour, when the  Persian women, bringing back their husbands and sons to the conflict,  urge them on to victory. The fame of their triumph having spread abroad,  the satraps and provinces successfully declared for the conqueror;  Hyrcania, first, followed by"]]]
