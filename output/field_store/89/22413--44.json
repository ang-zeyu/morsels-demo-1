Not even America, which until very recently prided itself on its  traditional policy of aloofness and the self-contained character of its  economy, the invulnerability of its institutions and the evidences of its  growing prosperity and prestige, has been able to resist the impelling  forces that have swept her into the vortex of an economic hurricane that  now threatens to impair the basis of her own industrial and economic life.  Even far-away Australia, which, owing to its remoteness from the  storm-centers of Europe, would have been expected to be immune from the  trials and torments of an ailing continent, has been caught in this  whirlpool of passion and strife, impotent to extricate herself from their  ensnaring influence.          The Signs of Impending Chaos      Never indeed have there been such widespread and basic upheavals, whether  in the social, economic or political spheres of human activity as those  now going on in different parts of the world. Never have there been so  many and varied sources of danger as those that now threaten the structure  of society. The following words of Baha'u'llah are indeed significant as  we pause to reflect upon the present state of a strangely disordered  world: \"How long will humanity persist in its waywardness? How long will  injustice continue? How long is chaos and confusion to reign amongst men?  How long will discord agitate the face of society? The winds of despair  are, alas, blowing from every direction, and the strife that divides and  afflicts the human race is daily increasing. The signs of impending  convulsions and chaos can now be discerned, inasmuch as the prevailing  order appears to be lamentably defective.\"    The disquieting influence of over thirty million souls living under  minority conditions throughout the continent of Europe; the vast and  ever-swelling army of the unemployed with its crushing burden and  demoralizing influence on governments and peoples; the wicked, unbridled  race of armaments swallowing an ever-increasing share of the substance of  already impoverished nations; the utter demoralization from which the  international financial markets are now increasingly suffering; the  onslaught of secularism invading what has hitherto been regarded as the  impregnable strongholds of Christian and Muslim orthodoxy--these stand out  as the gravest symptoms that bode ill for the future stability of the  structure of modern civilization. Little wonder if one of Europe's  preeminent thinkers, honored for his wisdom and restraint, should have  been forced to make so bold an assertion: \"The world is passing through  the gravest crisis in the history of civilization.\" \"We stand,\" writes  another, \"before either a world catastrophe, or perhaps before the dawn of  a greater era of truth and wisdom.\" \"It is in such times,\" he adds, \"that  religions have perished and are born.\"    Might we not already discern, as we scan the political horizon, the  alignment of those forces that are dividing afresh the continent of Europe  into camps of potential combatants, determined upon a contest that may  mark, unlike the last war, the end of an epoch, a vast epoch, in the  history of human evolution? Are we, the privileged custodians of a  priceless Faith, called upon to witness a cataclysmical change,  politically as fundamental and spiritually as beneficent as that which  precipitated the fall of the Roman Empire in the West? Might it not  happen--every vigilant adherent of the Faith of Baha'u'llah might well  pause to reflect--that out of this world eruption there may stream forces  of such spiritual energy as shall recall, nay eclipse, the splendor of  those signs and wonders that accompanied the establishment of the Faith of  Jesus Christ? Might there not emerge out of the agony of a shaken world a  religious revival of such scope and power as to even transcend the potency  of those world-directing forces with which the Religions of the Past have,  at fixed intervals and according to an inscrutable Wisdom, revived the  fortunes of declining ages and peoples? Might not the bankruptcy of this  present, this highly-vaunted materialistic civilization, in itself clear  away the choking weeds that now hinder the unfoldment and future  efflorescence of God's struggling Faith?    Let Baha'u'llah Himself shed the illumination of His words upon our path  as we steer our course amid the pitfalls and miseries of this troubled  age. More than fifty years ago, in a world far removed from the ills and  trials that now torment it, there flowed from His Pen these prophetic  words: \"The world is in travail and its agitation waxeth day by day. Its  face is turned towards waywardness and unbelief. Such shall be its plight  that to disclose it now would not be meet and seemly. Its perversity will  long continue. And when the appointed hour is come, there shall suddenly  appear that which shall cause the limbs of mankind to quake. Then and only  then will the Divine Standard be unfurled and the Nightingale of Paradise  warble its melody.\"          The Impotence of Statesmanship      Dearly-beloved friends! Humanity, whether viewed in the light of man's  individual conduct or in the existing relationships between organized  communities and nations, has, alas, strayed too far and suffered too great  a decline to be redeemed through the unaided efforts of the best among its  recognized rulers and statesmen--however disinterested their motives,  however concerted their action, however unsparing in their zeal and  devotion to its cause. No scheme which the calculations of the highest  statesmanship may yet devise; no doctrine which the most distinguished  exponents of economic theory may hope to advance; no principle which the  most ardent of moralists may strive to inculcate, can provide, in the last  resort, adequate foundations upon which the future of a distracted world  can be built. No appeal for mutual tolerance which the worldly-wise might  raise, however compelling and insistent, can calm its passions or help  restore its vigor. Nor would any general scheme of mere organized  international coeoperation, in whatever sphere of human activity, however  ingenious in conception, or extensive in scope, succeed in removing the  root cause of the evil that has so rudely upset the equilibrium of  present-day society. Not even, I venture to assert, would the very act of  devising the machinery required for the political and economic unification  of the world--a principle that has been increasingly advocated in recent  times--provide in itself the antidote against the poison that is steadily  undermining the vigor of organized peoples and nations. What else, might  we not confidently affirm, but the unreserved acceptance of the Divine  Program enunciated, with such simplicity and force as far back as sixty  years ago, by Baha'u'llah, embodying in its essentials God's divinely  appointed scheme for the unification of mankind in this age, coupled with  an indomitable conviction in the unfailing efficacy of each and all of its  provisions, is eventually capable of withstanding the forces of internal  disintegration which, if unchecked, must needs continue to eat into the  vitals of a despairing society. It is towards this goal--the goal of a new  World Order, Divine in origin, all-embracing in scope, equitable in  principle, challenging in its features--that a harassed humanity must  strive.    To claim to have grasped all the implications of Baha'u'llah's prodigious  scheme for world-wide human solidarity, or to have fathomed its import,  would be presumptuous on the part of even the declared supporters of His  Faith. To attempt to visualize it in all its possibilities, to estimate  its future benefits, to picture its glory, would be premature at even so  advanced a stage in the evolution of mankind.          The Guiding Principles of World Order      All we can reasonably venture to attempt is to strive to obtain a glimpse  of the first streaks of the promised Dawn that must, in the fullness of  time, chase away the gloom that has encircled humanity. All we can do is  to point out, in their broadest outlines, what appear to us to be the  guiding principles underlying the World Order of Baha'u'llah, as amplified  and enunciated by 'Abdu'l-Baha, the Center of His Covenant with all  mankind and the appointed Interpreter and Expounder of His Word.    That the unrest and suffering afflicting the mass of mankind are in no  small measure the direct consequences of the World War and are  attributable to the unwisdom and shortsightedness of the framers of the  Peace Treaties only a biased mind can refuse to admit. That the financial  obligations contracted in the course of the war, as well as the imposition  of a staggering burden of reparations upon the vanquished, have, to a very  great extent, been responsible for the maldistribution and consequent  shortage of the world's monetary gold supply, which in turn has, to a very  great measure, accentuated the phenomenal fall in prices and thereby  relentlessly increased the burdens of impoverished countries, no impartial  mind would question. That inter-governmental debts have imposed a severe  strain on the masses of the people in Europe, have upset the equilibrium  of national budgets, have crippled national industries, and led to an  increase in the number of the unemployed, is no less apparent to an  unprejudiced observer. That the spirit of vindictiveness, of suspicion, of  fear and rivalry, engendered by the war, and which the provisions of the  Peace Treaties have served to perpetuate and foster, has led to an  enormous increase of national competitive armaments, involving during the  last year the aggregate expenditure of no less than a thousand million  pounds, which in turn has accentuated the effects of the world-wide  depression, is a truth that even"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19300"],[0,"A Traveler's Narrative Written to Illustrate the Episode of the Báb (#7)"],[1," out accompanied by one of the King's messengers for  the Shrines.    Let us return, however, to our original subject. Of the Bab's writings  many remained in men's hands. Some of these were commentaries on, and  interpretations of the verses of the Qur'an; some were prayers, homilies,  and hints of [the true significance of certain] passages; others were  exhortations, admonitions, dissertations on the different branches of the  doctrine of the Divine Unity, demonstrations of the special prophetic  mission of the Lord of existing things [Muhammad], and (as it hath been  understood) encouragements to amendment of character, severance from  worldly states, and dependence on the inspirations of God. But the essence  and purport of His compositions were the praises and descriptions of that  Reality soon to appear which was His only object and aim, His darling, and  His desire.(16) For He regarded His own appearance as that of a harbinger  of good tidings, and considered His own real nature merely as a means for  the manifestation of the greater perfections of that One. And indeed He  ceased not from celebrating Him by night or day for a single instant, but  used to signify to all His followers that they should expect His arising:  in such wise that He declares in His writings, \"I am a letter out of that  most mighty book and a dewdrop from that limitless ocean, and, when He  shall appear, My true nature, My mysteries, riddles, and intimations will  become evident, and the embryo of this religion shall develop through the  grades of its being and ascent, attain to the station of 'the most comely  of forms,'(17) and become adorned with the robe of 'blessed be God, the  Best of Creators.'(18) And this event will disclose itself in the year  [A.H. one thousand two hundred and] sixty-nine,(19) which corresponds to  the number of the year of 'after a while,' and 'thou shalt see the  mountains which thou thinkest so solid passing away like the passing of  the clouds'(20) shall be fulfilled.\" In short He so described Him that, in  His own expression, He regarded approach to the divine bounty and  attainment of the highest degrees of perfection in the worlds of humanity  as dependent on love for Him, and so inflamed was He with His flame that  commemoration of Him was the bright candle of His dark nights in the  fortress of Maku, and remembrance of Him was the best of companions in the  straits of the prison of _Ch_ihriq. Thereby He obtained spiritual  enlargements; with His wine was He inebriated; and at remembrance of Him  did He rejoice. All of His followers too were in expectation of the  appearance of these signs, and each one of His intimates was seeking after  the fulfillment of these forecasts.    Now from the beginning of the manifestation of the Bab there was in Tihran  (which the Bab called the Holy Land) a Youth of the family of one of the  ministers and of noble lineage, gifted in every way, and adorned with  purity and nobility. Although He combined lofty lineage with high  connection, and although His ancestors were men of note in Persia and  universally sought after, yet He was not of a race of doctors or a family  of scholars. Now this Youth was from His earliest adolescence celebrated  amongst those of the ministerial class, both relatives and strangers, for  single-mindedness, and was from childhood pointed out as remarkable for  sagacity, and held in regard in the eyes of the wise. He did not, however,  after the fashion of His ancestors, desire elevation to lofty ranks nor  seek advancement to splendid but transient positions. His extreme aptitude  was nevertheless admitted by all, and His excessive acuteness and  intelligence were universally avowed. In the eyes of the common folk He  enjoyed a wonderful esteem, and in all gatherings and assemblies He had a  marvelous speech and delivery. Notwithstanding lack of instruction and  education such was the keenness of His penetration and the readiness of  His apprehension that when during His youthful prime He appeared in  assemblies where questions of divinity and points of metaphysic were being  discussed, and, in presence of a great concourse of doctors and scholars  loosed His tongue, all those present were amazed, accounting this as a  sort of prodigy beyond the discernment natural to the human race. From His  early years He was the hope of His kindred and the unique one of His  family and race, nay, their refuge and shelter.    However, in spite of these conditions and circumstances, as He wore a  kulah on His head and locks flowing over His shoulder, no one imagined  that He would become the source of such matters, or that the waves of His  flood would reach the zenith of this firmament.    When the question of the Bab was noised abroad signs of partiality  appeared in Him. At the first He apprised His relatives and connections,  and the children and dependents of His own circle; subsequently He  occupied His energies by day and night in inviting friends and strangers  [to embrace the new faith]. He arose with mighty resolution, engaged with  the utmost constancy in systematizing the principles and consolidating the  ethical canons of that society in every way, and strove by all means to  protect and guard these people.    When He had [thus] established the foundations in Tihran He hastened to  Mazindaran, where He displayed in assemblies, meetings, conferences, inns,  mosques, and colleges a mighty power of utterance and exposition. Whoever  beheld His open brow or heard His vivid eulogies perceived Him with the  eye of actual vision to be a patent demonstration, a latent magnetic  force, and a pervading influence. A great number both of rich and poor and  of erudite doctors were attracted by His preaching and washed their hands  of heart and life, being so enkindled that they laid down their lives  under the sword dancing [with joy].    Thus, amongst many instances, one day four learned and accomplished  scholars of the divines of Nur were present in His company, and in such  wise did He expound that all four were involuntarily constrained to  entreat Him to accept them for His service. For by dint of His eloquence,  which was like \"evident sorcery,\" He satisfied these eminent doctors that  they were in reality children engaged in the rudiments of study and the  merest tyros, and that therefore they must read the alphabet from the  beginning. Several protracted conferences were passed in expounding and  elucidating the Point and the Alif of the Absolute, wherein the doctors  present were astounded, and filled with amazement and astonishment at the  seething and roaring of the ocean of His utterance. The report of this  occurrence reached the hearing of far and near, and deep despondency fell  on the adversaries. The regions of Nur were filled with excitement and  commotion at these events, and the noise of this mischief and trouble  smote the ears of the citizens of Barfuru_sh_. The chief divine of Nur,  Mulla Muhammad, was in Qi_sh_laq. When he heard of these occurrences he  sent two of the most distinguished and profound of the doctors, who were  possessed of wondrous eloquence, effective oratorical talent,  conclusiveness of argument, and brilliant powers of demonstration, to  quench this fire, and to subdue and overcome this Young Man by force of  argument, either reducing Him to penitence, or causing Him to despair of  the successful issue of His projects. Glory be to God for His wondrous  decrees! When those two doctors entered the presence of that Young Man,  saw the waves of His utterance, and heard the force of His arguments, they  unfolded like the rose and were stirred like the multitude, and,  abandoning altar and chair, pulpit and preferment, wealth and luxury, and  evening and morning congregations, they applied themselves to the  furtherance of the objects of this Person, even inviting the chief divine  to tender his allegiance. So when this Young Man with a faculty of speech  like a rushing torrent set out for Amul and Sari He met with that  experienced doctor and that illustrious divine in Qi_sh_laq of Nur. And  the people assembled from all quarters awaiting the result. His  accomplished reverence the divine, although he was of universally  acknowledged excellence, and in science the most learned of his  contemporaries, nevertheless decided to have recourse to augury as to  [whether he should engage in] discussion and disputation. This did not  prove favorable and he therefore excused himself, deferring [the  discussion] until some other time. His incompetency and shortcoming  thereby became known and suspected, and this caused the adherence,  confirmation, and edification of many.    In brief outline the narrative is this. For some while He wandered about  in those districts. After the death of the late prince Muhammad _Sh_ah He  returned to Tihran, having in His mind [the intention of] corresponding  and entering into relations with the Bab. The medium of this  correspondence was the celebrated Mulla 'Abdu'l-Karim of Qazvin, who was  the Bab's mainstay and trusted intimate. Now since a great celebrity had  been attained for Baha'u'llah in Tihran, and the hearts of men were  disposed towards Him, He, together with Mulla 'Abdu'l-Karim, considered it  as expedient that, in face of the agitation amongst the doctors, the  aggressiveness of the greater part of [the people of] Persia, and the  irresistible power of the Amir-Nizam, whereby both the Bab and Baha'u'llah  were in great danger and liable to incur severe punishment, some measure  should be adopted to direct the thoughts of men towards some absent  person, by which means Baha'u'llah would remain protected from the  interference of all men. And since further, having regard to sundry  considerations, they did not consider an outsider as suitable, they cast  the lot of this augury to the name of Baha'u'llah's brother Mirza Yahya.
