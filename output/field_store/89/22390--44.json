(#7)"],[1,"by works are looking, not to the mortification of their  lusts, but only to the works themselves; thinking that, if they can  accomplish as many works and as great ones as possible, all is well with  them, and they are justified. Sometimes they even injure their brain,  and extinguish nature, or at least make it useless. This is enormous  folly, and ignorance of Christian life and faith, when a man seeks,  without faith, to be justified and saved by works.    To make what we have said more easily understood, let us set it forth  under a figure. The works of a Christian man, who is justified and saved  by his faith out of the pure and unbought mercy of God, ought to be  regarded in the same light as would have been those of Adam and Eve in  paradise and of all their posterity if they had not sinned. Of them it  is said, \"The Lord God took the man and put him into the garden of Eden  to dress it and to keep it\" (Gen. ii. 15). Now Adam had been created by  God just and righteous, so that he could not have needed to be justified  and made righteous by keeping the garden and working in it; but, that  he might not be unemployed, God gave him the business of keeping and  cultivating paradise. These would have indeed been works of perfect  freedom, being done for no object but that of pleasing God, and not in  order to obtain justification, which he already had to the full, and  which would have been innate in us all.    So it is with the works of a believer. Being by his faith replaced  afresh in paradise and created anew, he does not need works for his  justification, but that he may not be idle, but may exercise his own  body and preserve it. His works are to be done freely, with the sole  object of pleasing God. Only we are not yet fully created anew in  perfect faith and love; these require to be increased, not, however,  through works, but through themselves.    A bishop, when he consecrates a church, confirms children, or performs  any other duty of his office, is not consecrated as bishop by these  works; nay, unless he had been previously consecrated as bishop, not one  of those works would have any validity; they would be foolish, childish,  and ridiculous. Thus a Christian, being consecrated by his faith, does  good works; but he is not by these works made a more sacred person, or  more a Christian. That is the effect of faith alone; nay, unless he were  previously a believer and a Christian, none of his works would have any  value at all; they would really be impious and damnable sins.    True, then, are these two sayings: \"Good works do not make a good man,  but a good man does good works\"; \"Bad works do not make a bad man, but a  bad man does bad works.\" Thus it is always necessary that the substance  or person should be good before any good works can be done, and that  good works should follow and proceed from a good person. As Christ says,  \"A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree  bring forth good fruit\" (Matt. vii. 18). Now it is clear that the fruit  does not bear the tree, nor does the tree grow on the fruit; but, on the  contrary, the trees bear the fruit, and the fruit grows on the trees.    As then trees must exist before their fruit, and as the fruit does not  make the tree either good or bad, but on the contrary, a tree of either  kind produces fruit of the same kind, so must first the person of the  man be good or bad before he can do either a good or a bad work; and his  works do not make him bad or good, but he himself makes his works either  bad or good.    We may see the same thing in all handicrafts. A bad or good house does  not make a bad or good builder, but a good or bad builder makes a good  or bad house. And in general no work makes the workman such as it is  itself; but the workman makes the work such as he is himself. Such  is the case, too, with the works of men. Such as the man himself is,  whether in faith or in unbelief, such is his work: good if it be done  in faith; bad if in unbelief. But the converse is not true that, such as  the work is, such the man becomes in faith or in unbelief. For as works  do not make a believing man, so neither do they make a justified man;  but faith, as it makes a man a believer and justified, so also it makes  his works good.    Since then works justify no man, but a man must be justified before he  can do any good work, it is most evident that it is faith alone which,  by the mere mercy of God through Christ, and by means of His word,  can worthily and sufficiently justify and save the person; and that a  Christian man needs no work, no law, for his salvation; for by faith he  is free from all law, and in perfect freedom does gratuitously all that  he does, seeking nothing either of profit or of salvation--since by  the grace of God he is already saved and rich in all things through his  faith--but solely that which is well-pleasing to God.    So, too, no good work can profit an unbeliever to justification and  salvation; and, on the other hand, no evil work makes him an evil and  condemned person, but that unbelief, which makes the person and the tree  bad, makes his works evil and condemned. Wherefore, when any man is made  good or bad, this does not arise from his works, but from his faith or  unbelief, as the wise man says, \"The beginning of sin is to fall away  from God\"; that is, not to believe. Paul says, \"He that cometh to God  must believe\" (Heb. xi. 6); and Christ says the same thing: \"Either make  the tree good and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and  his fruit corrupt\" (Matt. xii. 33),--as much as to say, He who wishes to  have good fruit will begin with the tree, and plant a good one; even  so he who wishes to do good works must begin, not by working, but by  believing, since it is this which makes the person good. For nothing  makes the person good but faith, nor bad but unbelief.    It is certainly true that, in the sight of men, a man becomes good or  evil by his works; but here \"becoming\" means that it is thus shown and  recognised who is good or evil, as Christ says, \"By their fruits ye  shall know them\" (Matt. vii. 20). But all this stops at appearances and  externals; and in this matter very many deceive themselves, when they  presume to write and teach that we are to be justified by good works,  and meanwhile make no mention even of faith, walking in their own ways,  ever deceived and deceiving, going from bad to worse, blind leaders of  the blind, wearying themselves with many works, and yet never attaining  to true righteousness, of whom Paul says, \"Having a form of godliness,  but denying the power thereof, ever learning and never able to come to  the knowledge of the truth\" (2 Tim. iii. 5, 7).    He then who does not wish to go astray, with these blind ones, must look  further than to the works of the law or the doctrine of works; nay,  must turn away his sight from works, and look to the person, and to the  manner in which it may be justified. Now it is justified and saved, not  by works or laws, but by the word of God--that is, by the promise of His  grace--so that the glory may be to the Divine majesty, which has saved  us who believe, not by works of righteousness which we have done, but  according to His mercy, by the word of His grace.    From all this it is easy to perceive on what principle good works are  to be cast aside or embraced, and by what rule all teachings put forth  concerning works are to be understood. For if works are brought forward  as grounds of justification, and are done under the false persuasion  that we can pretend to be justified by them, they lay on us the yoke  of necessity, and extinguish liberty along with faith, and by this very  addition to their use they become no longer good, but really worthy of  condemnation. For such works are not free, but blaspheme the grace of  God, to which alone it belongs to justify and save through faith. Works  cannot accomplish this, and yet, with impious presumption, through  our folly, they take it on themselves to do so; and thus break in with  violence upon the office and glory of grace.    We do not then reject good works; nay, we embrace them and teach them in  the highest degree. It is not on their own account that we condemn them,  but on account of this impious addition to them and the perverse notion  of seeking justification by them. These things cause them to be only  good in outward show, but in reality not good, since by them men are  deceived and deceive others, like ravening wolves in sheep's clothing.    Now this leviathan, this perverted notion about works, is invincible  when sincere faith is wanting. For those sanctified doers of works  cannot but hold it till faith, which destroys it, comes and reigns in  the heart. Nature cannot expel it by her own power; nay, cannot even see  it for what it is, but considers it as a most holy will. And when  custom steps in besides, and strengthens this pravity of nature, as has  happened by means of impious teachers, then the evil is incurable, and  leads astray multitudes to irreparable ruin. Therefore, though it is  good to preach and write about penitence, confession, and satisfaction,  yet if we stop there, and do not go on to teach faith, such teaching  is without doubt deceitful and devilish. For Christ, speaking by His  servant John, not only said, \"Repent ye,\" but added, \"for the kingdom of  heaven is at hand\" (Matt. iii. 2).    For not one word of God only, but both, should be preached; new and old  things should be brought out of the treasury, as well the voice of  the law as the word of grace. The voice of the law should be brought  forward, that men may be terrified and brought to a knowledge of their  sins, and thence be converted to penitence and to a better manner of  life. But we must not stop here; that would be to wound only and not to  bind up, to strike and not to heal, to kill and not to make alive, to  bring down to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19115"],[0,"Roman Britain in 1914 (#7)"],[1," formula _in honorem domus  divinae_; it belongs mostly to the late second and third centuries. The  plural _Augustorum_ does not appear to refer to a plurality of reigning  Emperors, but to the whole body of Emperors dead and living who were  worshipped in the Cult of the Emperors.    The _vicani Vindolandesses_ are the members of the settlement--women and  children, traders, old soldiers, and others--which grew up outside the  fort at Chesterholm, as outside nearly all Roman forts and fortresses.  In this case they formed a small self-governing community, presumably  with its own 'parish council', which could be called by the Roman term  _vicus_, even if it was not all that a proper _vicus_ should be. This  altar was put up at the vote of their 'parish meeting' and paid for,  one imagines, out of their common funds. The term _vicus_ is applied to  similar settlements outside forts on the German Limes; thus we have the  _vicani Murrenses_ at the fort of Benningen on the Murr (CIL. xiii.  6454) and the _vicus Aurelius_ or _Aurelianus_ at Oehringen (_ibid._  6541).    _Vindolandesses_, which is merely a phonetic spelling or misspelling of  _Vindolandenses_, gives the correct name of the fort. In the Notitia  it is spelt Vindolana, in the Ravennas (431. 11) Vindolanda; and as  in general the Ravennas teems with errors and the Notitia is fairly  correct, the spelling Vindolana has always been preferred, although (as  Prof. Sir John Rhys tells me) its second part _-lana_ is an etymological  puzzle. It now appears that in this, as in some few other cases, the  Ravennas has kept the true tradition. The termination _-landa_ is a  Celtic word denoting a small defined space, akin to the Welsh 'llan',  and also to the English 'land'; I cannot, however, find any other  example in which it forms part of a place-name of Roman date. _Vindo-_  is connected either with the adjective _vindos_, 'white', or with the  personal name Vindos derived from that adjective.    I have to thank Mrs. Clayton, the owner of Chesterholm, and her foreman,  Mr. T. Hepple, for excellent photographs and squeezes. The altars are  now in the Chesters Museum.    (6) Found at Corbridge, in August 1914, fragment of a tile, 7 x 8 inches  in size, on which, before it was baked hard, some one had scratched  three lines of lettering about 1-1-1/2 inches tall; the surviving  letters form the beginnings of the lines of which the ends are broken  off. There were never more than three lines, apparently.          O M Q L      LIIND/      LEGEFEL      The inscription seems to have been a reading lesson. First the teacher  scratched two lines of letters, in no particular order and making no  particular sense; then he added the exhortation _lege feliciter_,  'read and good luck to you'. A modern teacher, even though he taught by  the aid of a slate in lieu of a soft tile, might have expressed himself  less gracefully. The tile may be compared with the well-known tile from  Silchester, on which Maunde Thompson detected a writing lesson (Eph.  Epigr. ix. 1293). A knowledge of reading and writing does not seem to  have been at all uncommon in Roman Britain or in the Roman world  generally, even among the working classes; I may refer to my  _Romanization of Roman Britain_ (ed. 3, pp. 29-34).    The imperfectly preserved letter after Q in line 1 was perhaps an  angular L or E; that after D, in line 2, may have been M or N or even A.    I am indebted to Mr. R. H. Forster for a photograph and squeeze of the  tile.    (7) Found in a peat-bog in Upper Weardale, in August 1913, two bronze  skillets or 'paterae', of the usual saucepan shape, the larger weighing  15-1/2 oz., the smaller 8-1/2 oz. Each bore a stamp on the handle;  the smaller had also a graffito on the rim of the bottom made by a  succession of little dots. An uninscribed bronze ladle was found with  the 'paterae':          (_a_) on the larger patera: P CIPE POLI        (_b_) on the smaller:       _p_OLYBI.I        (_c_) punctate:             LICINIANI      The stamps of the Campanian bronze-worker Cipius Polybius are well  known. Upwards of forty have been found, rather curiously distributed  (in the main) between Pompeii and places on or near the Rhenish and  Danubian frontiers, in northern Britain, and in German and Danish  lands outside the Roman Empire. The stamped 'paterae' of other Cipii  and other bronze-workers have a somewhat similar distribution; it  seems that the objects were made in the first century A.D., in or  near Pompeii, and were chiefly exported to or beyond the borders of the  Empire. Their exact use is still uncertain, I have discussed them in the  _Archaeological Journal_, xlix, 1892, pp. 228-31; they have since been  treated more fully by H. Willers (_Bronzeeimer von Hemmoor_, 1901, p.  213, and _Neue Untersuchungen ueber die roemische Bronzeindustrie_, 1907,  p. 69).    I have to thank Mr. W. M. Egglestone, of Stanhope, for information and  for rubbings of the stamps. The E in the first stamp seems clear on the  rubbing; all other examples have here I. or I. In the second stamp, the  conclusion might be BI.F. The _graffito_ was first read INVINDA; it is,  however, certainly as given above.    (8) Found at Holt, eight miles south of Chester (see above, p. 15), in  the autumn of 1914, built upside down into the outer wall of a kiln, a  centurial stone of the usual size and character, 10 inches long, 7-8  inches high, with letters (3/4-1 inch tall) inside a rude label          [C]CESo      NIANA      _c(enturia) C(a)esoniana_, set up by the century under Caesonius.    [Transcribers Note: The bracketed \"C\" above is printed reversed in the  original.]    Like another centurial stone found some time ago at Holt (Eph. Epigr.  ix. 1035), this was not found _in situ_; the kiln or other structure  into the wall of which it was originally inserted must have been pulled  down and its stones used up again.    The centuries mentioned would of course be units from the Twentieth  Legion at Chester.    (9) Found at Holt late in 1914, a fragment of tile (about 7 x 7 inches)  with parts of two (or three) lines of writing scratched on it.        ...LIVITILI..    ..IT TAL..    .........      I can offer no guess at the sense of this. The third line may be mere  scratches. I am indebted to Mr. Arthur Acton for sending Nos. 8 and 9 to  me for examination.    (10) Found at Lincoln in 1906, on the site of the Technical Schools  extensions (outside the east wall of the lower Roman town), a fragment  from the lower right-hand corner of an inscribed slab flanked with  foliation, 13 inches tall, 19 inches wide, with 2-inch lettering.            G | _fol_-          | _iat_-      IND | _ion_.      ____|__________      No doubt one should prefix L to IND. That is, the inscription ended with  some part of the Romano-British name of Lincoln, Lindum, or of its  adjective Lindensis. From the findspot it seems probable that the  inscription may have been sepulchral.    I am indebted to Mr. Arthur Smith, Curator of the City and County Museum  at Lincoln, for a squeeze. The stone is now in the Museum.    (11) Found in London near the General Post Office in a rubbish-pit (see  above, p. 23), two pieces of wood from the staves of a barrel which  seems to have served as lining to a pit or well. They bear faint  impressions of a metal stamp; (_a_) is repeated twice.          (_a_) [TE]C.PAGA...  _and_ ..C.PA..        (_b_) CS _or_ CB      The first stamp seems to include a name in the genitive, perhaps  _Pacati_, but I do not know what TEC means.    [Transcribers Note: The bracketed [TE] above is a \"TE\" ligature.]    (12) Found in another rubbish-pit of the same site as No. 11, a plain  gold ring with three sunk letters on the bezel:          Q.D.D      Presumably the initials of an owner. The letters were at first read  O.D.D, but the tail of the Q is discernible.    I am indebted to the Post Office authorities and to Mr. F. Lambert for  a sight of Nos. 11 and 12. The objects are preserved at the General  Post Office.    (13) I add here a note on a Roman milestone found in 1694 near Appleby  and lately refound.    Among the papers of the antiquary Richard Gough in the Bodleian  Library--more exactly, in his copy of Horsley's _Britannia_, gen. top.  128 = MS. 17653, fol. 44 _v._--is recorded the text of a milestone of  the Emperor Philip and his son, 'dug out of ye military way 1694, now  at Hangingshaw'. The entry is written in Gough's own hand on the last  page of a list of Roman and other inscriptions once belonging to  Reginald Bainbridge, who was schoolmaster in Appleby in Elizabeth's  reign and died there in 1606.[8] This list had been drawn up by one  Hayton, under-schoolmaster at Appleby, in 1722 and had been copied out  by Gough. There is, however, nothing to show whether the milestone,  found eighty-eight years after the death of Bainbridge and plainly none  of his collection, was added by Hayton, or was otherwise obtained by  Gough and copied by him on a casually blank page; there is nothing even  to connect either the stone or Hangingshaw with Appleby.    [Footnote 8: As to Bainbridge see my paper in the _Cumberland and  Westmorland Archaeological Transactions_, new series, vol. xi (1911),  pp. 343-78.]    The notice lay neglected till Huebner undertook to edit the Roman  inscriptions of Britain, which he issued in the seventh volume of the  _Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum_ in 1873. He included the milestone as  No. 1179. But, with his too frequent carelessness--a carelessness which  makes the seventh volume of the _Corpus_ far less valuable than the rest  of the series--he christened the stone, in defiance of dates, No. 17 in  Bainbridge's collection; he also added the statement (which we shall see  to be wrong) that Hangingshaw was near Old Carlisle. Fortunately, in the  autumn of 1914, Mr. Percival Ross, the Yorkshire archaeologist, sent me  a photograph of an inscription which he had come upon, built into"]]]
