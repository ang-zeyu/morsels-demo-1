Some, O my God, Thou didst, through Thy strengthening grace, enable to  approach it, while others Thou didst keep back by reason of what their  hands have wrought in Thy days. Whoso hath hasted towards it and attained  unto it hath, in his eagerness to gaze on Thy beauty, yielded his life in  Thy path, and ascended unto Thee, wholly detached from aught else except  Thyself.    I beseech Thee, O my Lord, by this Fire which blazeth and rageth in the  world of creation, to rend asunder the veils that have hindered me from  appearing before the throne of Thy majesty, and from standing at the door  of Thy gate. Do Thou ordain for me, O my Lord, every good thing Thou didst  send down in Thy Book, and suffer me not to be far removed from the  shelter of Thy mercy.    Powerful art Thou to do what pleaseth Thee. Thou art, verily, the  All-Powerful, the Most Generous.    --Baha'u'llah        \"Praise be unto Thee, O my God! I am one of...\"      Praise be unto Thee, O my God! I am one of Thy servants, who hath believed  on Thee and on Thy signs. Thou seest how I have set myself towards the  door of Thy mercy, and turned my face in the direction of Thy  loving-kindness. I beseech Thee, by Thy most excellent titles and Thy most  exalted attributes, to open to my face the portals of Thy bestowals. Aid  me, then, to do that which is good, O Thou Who art the Possessor of all  names and attributes!    I am poor, O my Lord, and Thou art the Rich. I have set my face towards  Thee, and detached myself from all but Thee. Deprive me not, I implore  Thee, of the breezes of Thy tender mercy, and withhold not from me what  Thou didst ordain for the chosen among Thy servants.    Remove the veil from mine eyes, O my Lord, that I may recognize what Thou  hast desired for Thy creatures, and discover, in all the manifestations of  Thy handiwork, the revelations of Thine almighty power. Enrapture my soul,  O my Lord, with Thy most mighty signs, and draw me out of the depths of my  corrupt and evil desires. Write down, then, for me the good of this world  and of the world to come. Potent art Thou to do what pleaseth Thee. No God  is there but Thee, the All-Glorious, Whose help is sought by all men.    I yield Thee thanks, O my Lord, that Thou hast wakened me from my sleep,  and stirred me up, and created in me the desire to perceive what most of  Thy servants have failed to apprehend. Make me able, therefore, O my Lord,  to behold, for love of Thee and for the sake of Thy pleasure, whatsoever  Thou hast desired. Thou art He to the power of Whose might and sovereignty  all things testify.    There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the Beneficent.    --Baha'u'llah        \"In the Name of thy Lord, the Creator, the Sovereign,...\"      In the Name of thy Lord, the Creator, the Sovereign, the All-Sufficing,  the Most Exalted, He Whose help is implored by all men.    Say: O my God! O Thou Who art the Maker of the heavens and of the earth, O  Lord of the Kingdom! Thou well knowest the secrets of my heart, while Thy  Being is inscrutable to all save Thyself. Thou seest whatsoever is of me,  while no one else can do this save Thee. Vouchsafe unto me, through Thy  grace, what will enable me to dispense with all except Thee, and destine  for me that which will make me independent of everyone else besides Thee.  Grant that I may reap the benefit of my life in this world and in the  next. Open to my face the portals of Thy grace, and graciously confer upon  me Thy tender mercy and bestowals.    O Thou Who art the Lord of grace abounding! Let Thy celestial aid surround  those who love Thee, and bestow upon us the gifts and the bounties Thou  dost possess. Be Thou sufficient unto us of all things, forgive our sins  and have mercy upon us. Thou art Our Lord and the Lord of all created  things. No one else do we invoke but Thee, and naught do we beseech but  Thy favors. Thou art the Lord of bounty and grace, invincible in Thy power  and the most skillful in Thy designs. No God is there but Thee, the  All-Possessing, the Most Exalted.    Confer Thy blessings, O my Lord, upon the Messengers, the holy ones and  the righteous. Verily, Thou art God, the Peerless, the All-Compelling.    --The Bab        \"O Lord! Unto Thee I repair for refuge, and...\"      O Lord! Unto Thee I repair for refuge, and toward all Thy signs I set my  heart.    O Lord! Whether traveling or at home, and in my occupation or in my work,  I place my whole trust in Thee.    Grant me then Thy sufficing help so as to make me independent of all  things, O Thou Who art unsurpassed in Thy mercy!    Bestow upon me my portion, O Lord, as Thou pleasest, and cause me to be  satisfied with whatsoever Thou hast ordained for me.    Thine is the absolute authority to command.    --The Bab        \"O God, my God! Thou art my Hope and my...\"      O God, my God! Thou art my Hope and my Beloved, my highest Aim and Desire!  With great humbleness and entire devotion I pray to Thee to make me a  minaret of Thy love in Thy land, a lamp of Thy knowledge among Thy  creatures, and a banner of divine bounty in Thy dominion.    Number me with such of Thy servants as have detached themselves from  everything but Thee, have sanctified themselves from the transitory things  of this world, and have freed themselves from the promptings of the  voicers of idle fancies.    Let my heart be dilated with joy through the spirit of confirmation from  Thy kingdom, and brighten my eyes by beholding the hosts of divine  assistance descending successively upon me from the kingdom of Thine  omnipotent glory.    Thou art, in truth, the Almighty, the All-Glorious, the All-Powerful.    --'Abdu'l-Baha        \"O God, my God! Fill up for me the cup of detachment...\"      O God, my God! Fill up for me the cup of detachment from all things, and  in the assembly of Thy splendors and bestowals, rejoice me with the wine  of loving Thee. Free me from the assaults of passion and desire, break off  from me the shackles of this nether world, draw me with rapture unto Thy  supernal realm, and refresh me amongst the handmaids with the breathings  of Thy holiness.    O Lord, brighten Thou my face with the lights of Thy bestowals, light Thou  mine eyes with beholding the signs of Thine all-subduing might; delight my  heart with the glory of Thy knowledge that encompasseth all things,  gladden Thou my soul with Thy soul-reviving tidings of great joy, O Thou  King of this world and the Kingdom above, O Thou Lord of dominion and  might, that I may spread abroad Thy signs and tokens, and proclaim Thy  Cause, and promote Thy Teachings, and serve Thy Law and exalt Thy Word.    Thou art, verily, the Powerful, the Ever-Giving, the Able, the Omnipotent.    --'Abdu'l-Baha          EVENING        \"O my God, my Master, the Goal of my desire!...\"      O my God, my Master, the Goal of my desire! This, Thy servant, seeketh to  sleep in the shelter of Thy mercy, and to repose beneath the canopy of Thy  grace, imploring Thy care and Thy protection.    I beg of Thee, O my Lord, by Thine eye that sleepeth not, to guard mine  eyes from beholding aught beside Thee. Strengthen, then, their vision that  they may discern Thy signs, and behold the Horizon of Thy Revelation. Thou  art He before the revelations of Whose omnipotence the quintessence of  power hath trembled.    No God is there but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Subduing, the  Unconditioned.    --Baha'u'llah        \"How can I choose to sleep, O God, my God,...\"      How can I choose to sleep, O God, my God, when the eyes of them that long  for Thee are wakeful because of their separation from Thee; and how can I  lie down to rest whilst the souls of Thy lovers are sore vexed in their  remoteness from Thy presence?    I have committed, O my Lord, my spirit and my entire being into the right  hand of Thy might and Thy protection, and I lay my head on my pillow  through Thy power, and lift it up according to Thy will and Thy good  pleasure. Thou art, in truth, the Preserver, the Keeper, the Almighty, the  Most Powerful.    By Thy might! I ask not, whether sleeping or waking, but that which Thou  dost desire. I am Thy servant and in Thy hands. Do Thou graciously aid me  to do what will shed forth the fragrance of Thy good pleasure. This,  truly, is my hope and the hope of them that enjoy near access to Thee.  Praised be Thou, O Lord of the worlds!    --Baha'u'llah        \"O Lord, I have turned my face unto Thy kingdom...\"      O seeker of Truth! If thou desirest that God may open thine eye, thou must  supplicate unto God, pray to and commune with Him at midnight, saying:    O Lord, I have turned my face unto Thy kingdom of oneness and am immersed  in the sea of Thy mercy. O Lord, enlighten my sight by beholding Thy  lights in this dark night, and make me happy by the wine of Thy love in  this wonderful age. O Lord, make me hear Thy call, and open before my face  the doors of Thy heaven, so that I may see the light of Thy glory and  become attracted to Thy beauty.    Verily, Thou art the Giver, the Generous, the Merciful, the Forgiving.    --'Abdu'l-Baha          FAMILIES        \"Glory be unto Thee, O Lord my God! I beg...\"      Glory be unto Thee, O Lord my God! I beg Thee to forgive me and those who  support Thy Faith. Verily, Thou art the sovereign Lord, the Forgiver, the  Most Generous. O my God! Enable such servants of Thine as are deprived of  knowledge to be admitted into Thy Cause; for once they learn of Thee, they  bear witness to the truth of the Day of Judgment and do not dispute the  revelations of Thy bounty. Send down upon them the tokens of Thy grace,  and grant them, wherever they reside, a liberal share of that which Thou  hast ordained for the pious among Thy servants. Thou art in truth the  Supreme Ruler, the All-Bounteous, the Most Benevolent.    O my God! Let the outpourings of Thy bounty and blessings descend upon  homes whose inmates have embraced Thy Faith, as a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19243"],[0,"The Advent of Divine Justice (#7)"],[1,"to inherit My earthly goods. I am restrained, however,  by the binding Law laid down in the Book, and am Myself bereft of all  worldly possessions.\" \"Know thou, of a truth,\" He significantly affirms,  \"these great oppressions that have befallen the world are preparing it for  the advent of the Most Great Justice.\" \"Say,\" He again asserts, \"He hath  appeared with that Justice wherewith mankind hath been adorned, and yet  the people are, for the most part, asleep.\" \"The light of men is Justice,\"  He moreover states, \"Quench it not with the contrary winds of oppression  and tyranny. The purpose of justice is the appearance of unity among men.\"  \"No radiance,\" He declares, \"can compare with that of justice. The  organization of the world and the tranquillity of mankind depend upon it.\"  \"O people of God!\" He exclaims, \"That which traineth the world is Justice,  for it is upheld by two pillars, reward and punishment. These two pillars  are the sources of life to the world.\" \"Justice and equity,\" is yet  another assertion, \"are two guardians for the protection of man. They have  appeared arrayed in their mighty and sacred names to maintain the world in  uprightness and protect the nations.\" \"Bestir yourselves, O people,\" is  His emphatic warning, \"in anticipation of the days of Divine justice, for  the promised hour is now come. Beware lest ye fail to apprehend its  import, and be accounted among the erring.\" \"The day is approaching,\" He  similarly has written, \"when the faithful will behold the daystar of  justice shining in its full splendor from the dayspring of glory.\" \"The  shame I was made to bear,\" He significantly remarks, \"hath uncovered the  glory with which the whole of creation had been invested, and through the  cruelties I have endured, the daystar of justice hath manifested itself,  and shed its splendor upon men.\" \"The world,\" He again has written, \"is in  great turmoil, and the minds of its people are in a state of utter  confusion. We entreat the Almighty that He may graciously illuminate them  with the glory of His Justice, and enable them to discover that which will  be profitable unto them at all times and under all conditions.\" And again,  \"There can be no doubt whatever that if the daystar of justice, which the  clouds of tyranny have obscured, were to shed its light upon men, the face  of the earth would be completely transformed.\"    \"God be praised!\" 'Abdu'l-Baha, in His turn, exclaims, \"The sun of justice  hath risen above the horizon of Baha'u'llah. For in His Tablets the  foundations of such a justice have been laid as no mind hath, from the  beginning of creation, conceived.\" \"The canopy of existence,\" He further  explains, \"resteth upon the pole of justice, and not of forgiveness, and  the life of mankind dependeth on justice and not on forgiveness.\"    Small wonder, therefore, that the Author of the Baha'i Revelation should  have chosen to associate the name and title of that House, which is to be  the crowning glory of His administrative institutions, not with  forgiveness but with justice, to have made justice the only basis and the  permanent foundation of His Most Great Peace, and to have proclaimed it in  His Hidden Words as \"the best beloved of all things\" in His sight. It is  to the American believers, particularly, that I feel urged to direct this  fervent plea to ponder in their hearts the implications of this moral  rectitude, and to uphold, with heart and soul and uncompromisingly, both  individually and collectively, this sublime standard--a standard of which  justice is so essential and potent an element.    As to a chaste and holy life, it should be regarded as no less essential a  factor that must contribute its proper share to the strengthening and  vitalization of the Baha'i community, upon which must in turn depend the  success of any Baha'i plan or enterprise. In these days when the forces of  irreligion are weakening the moral fiber, and undermining the foundations  of individual morality, the obligation of chastity and holiness must claim  an increasing share of the attention of the American believers, both in  their individual capacities and as the responsible custodians of the  interests of the Faith of Baha'u'llah. In the discharge of such an  obligation, to which the special circumstances resulting from an excessive  and enervating materialism now prevailing in their country lend particular  significance, they must play a conspicuous and predominant role. All of  them, be they men or women, must, at this threatening hour when the lights  of religion are fading out, and its restraints are one by one being  abolished, pause to examine themselves, scrutinize their conduct, and with  characteristic resolution arise to purge the life of their community of  every trace of moral laxity that might stain the name, or impair the  integrity, of so holy and precious a Faith.    A chaste and holy life must be made the controlling principle in the  behavior and conduct of all Baha'is, both in their social relations with  the members of their own community, and in their contact with the world at  large. It must adorn and reinforce the ceaseless labors and meritorious  exertions of those whose enviable position is to propagate the Message,  and to administer the affairs, of the Faith of Baha'u'llah. It must be  upheld, in all its integrity and implications, in every phase of the life  of those who fill the ranks of that Faith, whether in their homes, their  travels, their clubs, their societies, their entertainments, their  schools, and their universities. It must be accorded special consideration  in the conduct of the social activities of every Baha'i summer school and  any other occasions on which Baha'i community life is organized and  fostered. It must be closely and continually identified with the mission  of the Baha'i youth, both as an element in the life of the Baha'i  community, and as a factor in the future progress and orientation of the  youth of their own country.    Such a chaste and holy life, with its implications of modesty, purity,  temperance, decency, and clean-mindedness, involves no less than the  exercise of moderation in all that pertains to dress, language,  amusements, and all artistic and literary avocations. It demands daily  vigilance in the control of one's carnal desires and corrupt inclinations.  It calls for the abandonment of a frivolous conduct, with its excessive  attachment to trivial and often misdirected pleasures. It requires total  abstinence from all alcoholic drinks, from opium, and from similar  habit-forming drugs. It condemns the prostitution of art and of  literature, the practices of nudism and of companionate marriage,  infidelity in marital relationships, and all manner of promiscuity, of  easy familiarity, and of sexual vices. It can tolerate no compromise with  the theories, the standards, the habits, and the excesses of a decadent  age. Nay rather it seeks to demonstrate, through the dynamic force of its  example, the pernicious character of such theories, the falsity of such  standards, the hollowness of such claims, the perversity of such habits,  and the sacrilegious character of such excesses.    \"By the righteousness of God!\" writes Baha'u'llah, \"The world, its  vanities and its glory, and whatever delights it can offer, are all, in  the sight of God, as worthless as, nay even more contemptible than, dust  and ashes. Would that the hearts of men could comprehend it. Wash  yourselves thoroughly, O people of Baha, from the defilement of the world,  and of all that pertaineth unto it. God Himself beareth Me witness! The  things of the earth ill beseem you. Cast them away unto such as may desire  them, and fasten your eyes upon this most holy and effulgent Vision.\" \"O  ye My loved ones!\" He thus exhorts His followers, \"Suffer not the hem of  My sacred vesture to be smirched and mired with the things of this world,  and follow not the promptings of your evil and corrupt desires.\" And  again, \"O ye the beloved of the one true God! Pass beyond the narrow  retreats of your evil and corrupt desires, and advance into the vast  immensity of the realm of God, and abide ye in the meads of sanctity and  of detachment, that the fragrance of your deeds may lead the whole of  mankind to the ocean of God's unfading glory.\" \"Disencumber yourselves,\"  He thus commands them, \"of all attachment to this world and the vanities  thereof. Beware that ye approach them not, inasmuch as they prompt you to  walk after your own lusts and covetous desires, and hinder you from  entering the straight and glorious Path.\" \"Eschew all manner of  wickedness,\" is His commandment, \"for such things are forbidden unto you  in the Book which none touch except such as God hath cleansed from every  taint of guilt, and numbered among the purified.\" \"A race of men,\" is His  written promise, \"incomparable in character, shall be raised up which,  with the feet of detachment, will tread under all who are in heaven and on  earth, and will cast the sleeve of holiness over all that hath been  created from water and clay.\" \"The civilization,\" is His grave warning,  \"so often vaunted by the learned exponents of arts and sciences, will, if  allowed to overleap the bounds of moderation, bring great evil upon  men.... If carried to excess, civilization will prove as prolific a source  of evil as it had been of goodness when kept within the restraints of  moderation.\" \"He hath chosen out of the whole world the hearts of His  servants,\" He explains, \"and made them each a seat for the revelation of  His glory. Wherefore, sanctify them from every defilement, that the things  for which they were created may be engraven upon them. This indeed is a  token of God's bountiful favor.\" \"Say,\" He proclaims, \"He is not to be  numbered with the people of Baha who followeth his mundane desires, or  fixeth his heart on things of the earth. He is My true follower who, if he  come to a"]]]
