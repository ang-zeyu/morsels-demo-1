Ah, foolish one!  why thinkest thou that thou shalt live long,  when thou art not sure of a single day?  How many have been  deceived, and suddenly have been snatched away from the body!  How many times hast thou heard how one was slain by the sword,  another was drowned, another falling from on high broke his neck,  another died at the table, another whilst at play! One died by  fire, another by the sword, another by the pestilence, another by  the robber.  Thus cometh death to all, and the life of men  swiftly passeth away like a shadow.    8. Who will remember thee after thy death?  And who will entreat  for thee?  Work, work now, oh dearly beloved, work all that thou  canst.  For thou knowest not when thou shalt die, nor what shall  happen unto thee after death.  While thou hast time, lay up for  thyself undying riches.  Think of nought but of thy salvation;  care only for the things of God.  Make to thyself friends, by  venerating the saints of God and walking in their steps, that  when thou failest, thou mayest be received into everlasting  habitations.(2)    9. Keep thyself as a stranger and a pilgrim upon the earth, to  whom the things of the world appertain not.  Keep thine heart  free, and lifted up towards God, for here have we no continuing  city.(3)  To Him direct thy daily prayers with crying and tears,  that thy spirit may be found worthy to pass happily after death  unto its Lord.  Amen.    (1) Matthew xxiv. 44.   (2) Luke xvi. 9.   (3) Hebrews xiii. 14.      CHAPTER XXIV    Of the judgment and punishment of the wicked    In all that thou doest, remember the end, and how thou wilt stand  before a strict judge, from whom nothing is hid, who is not  bribed with gifts, nor accepteth excuses, but will judge  righteous judgment.  O most miserable and foolish sinner, who art  sometimes in fear of the countenance of an angry man, what wilt  thou answer to God, who knoweth all thy misdeeds?  Why dost thou  not provide for thyself against the day of judgment, when no man  shall be able to be excused or defended by means of another, but  each one shall bear his burden himself alone?  Now doth thy  labour bring forth fruit, now is thy weeping acceptable, thy  groaning heard, thy sorrow well pleasing to God, and cleansing to  thy soul.    2. Even here on earth the patient man findeth great occasion of  purifying his soul.  When suffering injuries he grieveth more for  the other's malice than for his own wrong; when he prayeth  heartily for those that despitefully use him, and forgiveth them  from his heart; when he is not slow to ask pardon from others;  when he is swifter to pity than to anger; when he frequently  denieth himself and striveth altogether to subdue the flesh to  the spirit.  Better is it now to purify the soul from sin, than  to cling to sins from which we must be purged hereafter.  Truly  we deceive ourselves by the inordinate love which we bear towards  the flesh.    3. What is it which that fire shall devour, save thy sins?  The  more thou sparest thyself and followest the flesh, the more heavy  shall thy punishment be, and the more fuel art thou heaping up  for the burning.  For wherein a man hath sinned, therein shall he  be the more heavily punished.  There shall the slothful be  pricked forward with burning goads, and the gluttons be tormented  with intolerable hunger and thirst.  There shall the luxurious  and the lovers of pleasure be plunged into burning pitch and  stinking brimstone, and the envious shall howl like mad dogs for  very grief.    4. No sin will there be which shall not be visited with its own  proper punishment. The proud shall be filled with utter  confusion, and the covetous shall be pinched with miserable  poverty.  An hour's pain there shall be more grievous than a  hundred years here of the bitterest penitence.  No quiet shall be  there, no comfort for the lost, though here sometimes there is  respite from pain, and enjoyment of the solace of friends.  Be  thou anxious now and sorrowful for thy sins, that in the day of  judgment thou mayest have boldness with the blessed.  For then  shall the righteous man stand in great boldness before the face  of such as have afflicted him and made no account of his  labours.(1)  Then shall he stand up to judge, he who now  submitteth himself in humility to the judgments of men.  Then  shall the poor and humble man have great confidence, while the  proud is taken with fear on every side.    5. Then shall it be seen that he was the wise man in this world  who learned to be a fool and despised for Christ.  Then shall all  tribulation patiently borne delight us, while the mouth of the  ungodly shall be stopped.  Then shall every godly man rejoice,  and every profane man shall mourn.  Then the afflicted flesh  shall more rejoice than if it had been alway nourished in  delights.  Then the humble garment shall put on beauty, and the  precious robe shall hide itself as vile.  Then the little poor  cottage shall be more commended than the gilded palace.  Then  enduring patience shall have more might than all the power of the  world.  Then simple obedience shall be more highly exalted than  all worldly wisdom.    6. Then a pure and good conscience shall more rejoice than  learned philosophy.  Then contempt of riches shall have more  weight than all the treasure of the children of this world.  Then  shalt thou find more comfort in having prayed devoutly than in  having fared sumptuously.  Then thou wilt rather rejoice in  having kept silence than in having made long speech.  Then holy  deeds shall be far stronger than many fine words.  Then a strict  life and sincere penitence shall bring deeper pleasure than all  earthly delight.  Learn now to suffer a little, that then thou  mayest be enabled to escape heavier sufferings.  Prove first  here, what thou art able to endure hereafter.  If now thou art  able to bear so little, how wilt thou be able to endure eternal  torments?  If now a little suffering maketh thee so impatient,  what shall hell-fire do then? Behold of a surety thou art not  able to have two Paradises, to take thy fill or delight here in  this world, and to reign with Christ hereafter.    7. If even unto this day thou hadst ever lived in honours and  pleasures, what would the whole profit thee if now death came to  thee in an instant?  All therefore is vanity, save to love God  and to serve Him only.  For he who loveth God with all his heart  feareth not death, nor punishment, nor judgment, nor hell,  because perfect love giveth sure access to God.  But he who still  delighteth in sin, no marvel if he is afraid of death and  judgment.  Nevertheless it is a good thing, if love as yet cannot  restrain thee from evil, that at least the fear of hell should  hold thee back.  But he who putteth aside the fear of God cannot  long continue in good, but shall quickly fall into the snares of  the devil.    (1) Wisd. v. 1.      CHAPTER XXV    Of the zealous amendment of our whole life    Be thou watchful and diligent in God's service, and bethink thee  often why thou hast renounced the world.  Was it not that thou  mightest live to God and become a spiritual man?  Be zealous,  therefore, for thy spiritual profit, for thou shalt receive  shortly the reward of thy labours, and neither fear nor sorrow  shall come any more into thy borders.  Now shalt thou labour a  little, and thou shalt find great rest, yea everlasting joy.  If  thou shalt remain faithful and zealous in labour, doubt not that  God shall be faithful and bountiful in rewarding thee.  It is thy  duty to have a good hope that thou wilt attain the victory, but  thou must not fall into security lest thou become slothful or  lifted up.    2. A certain man being in anxiety of mind, continually tossed  about between hope and fear, and being on a certain day  overwhelmed with grief, cast himself down in prayer before the  altar in a church, and meditated within himself, saying, \"Oh! if  I but knew that I should still persevere,\" and presently heard  within him a voice from God, \"And if thou didst know it, what  wouldst thou do?  Do now what thou wouldst do then, and thou  shalt be very secure.\"  And straightway being comforted and  strengthened, he committed himself to the will of God and the  perturbation of spirit ceased, neither had he a mind any more to  search curiously to know what should befall him hereafter, but  studied rather to inquire what was the good and acceptable will  of God, for the beginning and perfecting of every good work.    3. Hope in the Lord and be doing good, saith the Prophet; dwell  in the land and thou shalt be fed(1) with its riches.  One thing  there is which holdeth back many from progress and fervent  amendment, even the dread of difficulty, or the labour of the  conflict.  Nevertheless they advance above all others in virtue  who strive manfully to conquer those things which are most  grievous and contrary to them, for there a man profiteth most and  meriteth greater grace where he most overcometh himself and  mortifieth himself in spirit.    4. But all men have not the same passions to conquer and to  mortify, yet he who is diligent shall attain more profit,  although he have stronger passions, than another who is more  temperate of disposition, but is withal less fervent in the  pursuit of virtue.  Two things specially avail unto improvement  in holiness, namely firmness to withdraw ourselves from the sin  to which by nature we are most inclined, and earnest zeal for  that good in which we are most lacking.  And strive also very  earnestly to guard against and subdue those faults which  displease thee most frequently in others.    5. Gather some profit to thy soul wherever thou art, and wherever  thou seest or hearest good examples, stir thyself to follow them,  but where thou seest anything which is blameworthy, take heed  that thou do not the same; or if at any time thou hast done it,  strive "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16531"],[0,"Old St. Paul's Cathedral (#7)"],[1," north he  came to St. Edmund's Bury, and found some men who were charged with  robbing the shrine of St. Edmund, and were detected by the Saint's  miraculous interference. The bishop ordered them to be hanged; but the  uncanonical act weighed so heavily on his conscience that he performed  a lifelong penance, and as an expiation reared a splendid shrine over  the saint's body. And further, he persuaded the King to decree, in a  Witanagemote, that no one younger than fifteen should be put to death  for theft. The bishop was buried in the crypt of St. Paul's, and the  story was often told at his tomb, which was much frequented by the  citizens, of his error and his life-long sorrow.    Another bishop who had been placed in the See by Edward the Confessor,  who, it will be remembered, greatly favoured Normans, to the  indignation of the English people, was known as \"William the Norman,\"  and, unpopular as the appointment may have been, it did the English  good service. For when the Norman Conquest came the Londoners, for a  while, were in fierce antagonism, and it might have gone hard with  them. But Bishop William was known to the Conqueror, and had, in fact,  been his chaplain, and it was by his intercession that he not only  made friends with them, but gave them the charter still to be seen at  the Guildhall. His monument was in the nave, towards the west end, and  told that he was \"vir sapientia et vitae sanctitate clarus.\" He was  bishop for twenty years, and died in 1075. The following tribute on  the stone is worth preserving:--      \"Haec tibi, clare Pater, posuerunt marmora cives,    Praemia non meritis aequiparanda tuis:    Namque sibi populus te Londoniensis amicum    Sensit, et huic urbi non leve presidium:    Reddita Libertas, duce te, donataque multis,    Te duce, res fuerat publica muneribus.    Divitias, genus, et formam brevis opprimat hora,    Haec tua sed pietas et benefacta manent.\"[1]    To his shrine also an annual pilgrimage was made, and Lord Mayor  Barkham, on renewing the above inscription A.D. 1622, puts in a word  for himself:      \"This being by Barkham's thankful mind renewed,    Call it the monument of gratitude.\"    We pass on to the time of the \"second church,\" the Old St. Paul's  which is the subject of this monograph.    The importance of London had been growing without interruption ever  since its restoration by King Alfred, and it had risen to its position  as the capital city. This largely showed itself when Archbishop  Lanfranc, in 1075, held a great council in St. Paul's, \"the first full  Ecclesiastical Parliament of England,\" Dean Milman calls it. Up to  that time, secular and Church matters had been settled in the same  assembly, but this meeting, held with the King's sanction, and  simultaneously with the Witan, or Parliament, established distinct  courts for the trial of ecclesiastical causes. It decreed that no  bishop or archdeacon should sit in the shiremote or hundred-mote, and  that no layman should try causes pertaining to the cure of souls.  The same council removed some episcopal sees from villages to towns,  Selsey to Chichester, Elmham first to Thetford, then to Norwich,  Sherburn to Old Sarum, Dorchester-on-Thame to Lincoln.    Another council of the great men met in St. Paul's in the course of  the dispute between Henry I. and Anselm about the investitures, but it  ended in a deadlock, and a fresh appeal to the Pope.    In the fierce struggle between Henry II. and Archbishop Becket,  Gilbert Foliot, Bishop of London, while apparently quite honest in his  desire to uphold the rights of the Church, also remained in favour  with the King, and hoped to bring about peace. Becket regarded Foliot  as his bitter enemy, and, whilst the latter was engaged in the most  solemn service in St. Paul's (on St. Paul's Day, 1167), an emissary  from the Archbishop, who was then in self-imposed exile abroad, came  up to the altar, thrust a sentence of excommunication into his hands,  and exclaimed aloud, \"Know all men that Gilbert, Bishop of London,  is excommunicated by Thomas, Archbishop of Canterbury.\" When Becket  returned to England, December 1st, 1170, after a hollow reconciliation  with the King, he was asked to remove his sentence of excommunication  on Foliot and the Bishops of Salisbury and York, who had, as he held,  usurped his authority. He refused, unless they made acknowledgment  of their errors. The sequel we know. The King's hasty exclamation on  hearing of this brought about the Archbishop's murder on the 29th  of the same month. During the excommunication, Foliot seems to have  behaved wisely and well. He refused to accept it as valid, but  stayed away from the cathedral to avoid giving offence to sensitive  consciences. After Becket's murder, he declared his innocence of  any share in it, and the Bishop of Nevers removed the sentence of  excommunication.    It was at this period that the Deanery was occupied by the first  man of letters it had yet possessed, Ralph de Diceto. His name is  a puzzle; no one has as yet ascertained the place from which it is  taken. Very probably he was of foreign birth. When Belmeis was made  Bishop of London in 1152, Diceto succeeded him as Archdeacon of  Middlesex. His learning was great, and his chronicles (which have been  edited by Bishop Stubbs) are of great historical value. In the Becket  quarrel Diceto was loyal to Foliot, but he also remained friendly with  Becket. In 1180, he became Dean of St. Paul's. Here he displayed great  and most valuable energy; made a survey of the capitular property  (printed by the Camden Society under the editorship of Archdeacon  Hale), collected many books, which he presented to the Chapter,  built a Deanery House, and established a \"fratery,\" or guild for the  ministration to the spiritual and bodily wants of the sick and poor.  He died in 1202. He wrote against the strict views concerning the  celibacy of the clergy promulgated by Pope Gregory VII., and declared  that the doctrine and the actual practice made a great scandal to  the laity. Dean Milman suspects that he was much moved herein by the  condition of his own Chapter.    In 1191, whilst King Richard I. was in Palestine, his brother John  summoned a council to St. Paul's to denounce William de Longchamp,  Bishop of Ely, to whom Richard had entrusted the affairs of  government, of high crimes and misdemeanours. The result was that  Longchamp had to escape across sea. At length the King returned, but  the Londoners were deeply disaffected. William FitzOsbert, popularly  known as \"Longbeard,\" poured forth impassioned harangues from Paul's  Cross against the oppression of the poor, and the cathedral was  invaded by rioters. Fifty-two thousand persons bound themselves to  follow him, but Hubert, Archbishop of Canterbury, met the citizens in  the cathedral, and by his mild and persuasive eloquence persuaded them  to preserve the peace. FitzOsbert, finding himself deserted, clove the  head of the man sent to arrest him, and shut himself up in the church  of St. Mary-le-Bow. His followers kept aloof, and a three-days' siege  was ended by the church being set on fire. On his attempt to escape he  was severely wounded by the son of the man he had killed, was dragged  away, and burned alive. But his memory was long cherished by the poor.  Paul's Cross was silent for many years from that time.    In 1213, a great meeting of bishops, abbots, and barons met at St.  Paul's to consider the misgovernment and illegal acts of King John.  Archbishop Langton laid before the assembly the charter of Henry I.,  and commented on its provisions. The result was an oath, taken with  acclamation, that they would, if necessary, die for their liberties.  And this led up to Magna Charta. But it was a scene as ignominious as  the first surrender before Pandulf, when Pope Innocent accepted the  homage of King John as the price of supporting him against his barons,  and the wretched King, before the altar of St. Paul, ceded his kingdom  as a fief of the Holy See. The Archbishop of Canterbury protested both  privately and publicly against it.    Henry III. succeeded, at the age of ten years, to a crown which his  father had degraded. The Pope addressed him as \"Vassallus Noster,\" and  sent his legates, one after another, to maintain his authority. It was  in St. Paul's Cathedral that this authority was most conspicuously  asserted. Before the high altar these legates took their seat, issued  canons of doctrine and discipline, and assessed the tribute which  clergy and laity were to pay to the liege lord enthroned at the  Vatican. But the indignation of the nation had been waxing hotter and  hotter ever since King John's shameful surrender. Nevertheless, in the  first days of the boy King's reign, the Papal pretensions did good  service. The barons, in wrath at John's falseness, had invited the  intervention of France, and the Dauphin was now in power. In St.  Paul's Cathedral, half England swore allegiance to him. The Papal  legate, Gualo, by his indignant remonstrance, awoke in them the sense  of shame, and the evil was averted. Then another council was held in  the same cathedral, and the King ratified the Great Charter.    Henry III. grew to manhood, and gave himself up to the management of  foreign favourites, and in 1237, instigated by these, who were led by  Peter de la Roche, Bishop of Winchester, he invited Pope Gregory  IX. to send a Legate (Cardinal Otho \"the White\") to arrange certain  matters concerning English benefices, as well as some fresh tribute.  They called it \"promoting reforms.\" Their object was to support him in  filling all the rich preferments with the Poitevins and Gascons whom  he was bringing over in swarms. The Cardinal took his lofty seat  before the altar of S. Paul's, and the King bowed before him \"until  his head almost touched his knees.\" The Cardinal \"lifted up his voice  like a trumpet\" and preached the first sermon of which"]]]
