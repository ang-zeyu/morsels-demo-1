Since this was the first city  captured it was considered to be sacred to Jehovah. The pity of it is  that, in accordance with the standards of that day, this meant the  ruthless slaughter of every living thing within its walls, including  men, women, and little children.    =New conquests.=--In these early raids some tribes, led by the men of  Judah, went southwest and captured a few towns in the mountains west  of the Dead Sea. Others, led by the strong tribe of Ephraim, went  northwest. Throughout their later history, these were always the two  leading tribes, Judah in the south, and Ephraim in the north. After  the victories of the fighting men, the women and children and flocks  would follow.    We can imagine these rough warriors, with their untrained boys and  girls, swarming into the houses of these little towns and villages.  Most of them had never been inside a house before; and they would be  eager to look at the furniture and to know the uses of the many  strange things: for example, the jar of lye for cleaning, the perfumes  on the stand, the earthen vessels for water and milk, the lamps, the  baskets made of twigs, the pots for boiling broth, the oven for  baking, in the door yard, and the wine press on the hillside where the  grapes were trodden at the time of grape harvest.    =The right and wrong of conquest.=--One may ask, what right had the  Hebrews to attack and kill these people and seize their homes? Ideal  Christian standards develop slowly. In these days of which we speak  such standards had hardly been thought of. All weak nations were at  the mercy of their stronger neighbors, and no one ever questioned the  morality of it. It is good to know, moreover, that conquest, after  all, was not the chief method by which the Hebrews made themselves  masters of Canaan. After they had established themselves, here and  there, in certain towns, and certain sections of the country, they  gradually made friends with their Canaanite neighbors whom they had  not been able to conquer at the beginning. In time their children  intermarried with the children of the Canaanites until at last there  came to be one nation, which was known as the Hebrews, or the Children  of Israel.      STUDY TOPICS    1. Read any one of the following sections: Numbers 11. 13-14, 20, 21;  Deuteronomy 34; Joshua 1. 6.    2. Draw a map showing in a general way the movements of the Hebrews  described in this chapter.    3. Look up in the Bible dictionary, \"Manna,\" \"Spies,\" \"Kadesh,\"  \"Jericho.\"    4. Compare the conquest of Canaan with the treatment of the American  Indians by white settlers.    5. How should the natives of Africa be treated in the opening up of  Africa to civilization?          CHAPTER VII    LEARNING TO BE FARMERS      The wandering Hebrew shepherds were not savages nor barbarians. In  many ways Abraham and his friends were cultured, civilized people; but  their civilization was of a different kind from that of the settled  farmers and villagers of Canaan. So when the Hebrews crossed the  Jordan and gradually fought their way to the highland fields and  villages where they were able to settle down and live as farmers and  vineyard keepers instead of shepherds, they soon found that they had  much to learn. The only teachers to whom they could turn were the  Canaanites. Very soon, therefore, they made friends with their  Canaanite neighbors.    \"Tell us how to plant wheat,\" the Hebrews said to them, for example;  or, \"Will you please show us how to prune these grape vines?\" or,  \"Won't you give us a few lessons in driving oxen? We can't make these  young steers pull.\"      LEARNING TO RAISE AND USE CATTLE    This lesson about the training and care of cattle was one of the first  and most necessary parts of their new education. As shepherds they  knew all about sheep and goats; and this knowledge was still valuable,  for on many a Canaanite hillside goats could thrive where no other  animal could live. But as farmers they must also raise cattle, not  only because of the milk, and the beef, but because they needed the  oxen to draw their carts and plows and harrows. Oxen and asses, not  horses, were the work animals of the farmers of those days. Oxen  were more powerful than asses. Horses were seldom seen at all. They  were used chiefly in war by the great military emperors of Egypt and  Assyria.     +-------------------------------------------------------------------+   | [Illustration: EGYPTIAN PLOWING                                   |   | (Similar to Hebrew Method.)]                                      |   |                                                                   |   | [Illustration: EGYPTIANS THRESHING AND WINNOWING                  |   | (Hebrews used same methods.)]                                     |   |                                                                   |   | [Illustration: EGYPTIAN OR HEBREW THRESHING FLOOR]                |   |                                                                   |   | Cuts on this page used by permission of the Palestine Foundation  |   | Fund.                                                             |   +-------------------------------------------------------------------+    =Driving an ox team.=--So we can imagine the young Canaanites of those  days watching a Hebrew farmer taking his first lesson with a team of  oxen. There was a wooden yoke to lay on their necks; there was the  two-wheeled farm cart with its long tongue to be fastened to the yoke.  There was the goad, a long pole with a sharp point, to stick into the  animals' flanks if they should balk. And probably there were many  useful tricks to be learned; for example, words like our \"Gee\" and  \"Haw\" and \"Whoa,\" to shout at the animals when it was necessary to  turn to the left or the right or to stop altogether.    Plowing was one of the most difficult of the tasks to be done with  oxen. The furrows had to be run straight and true. And the plows were  clumsy affairs--not like our shining steel plows to-day--just a long  pole with a short diagonal crosspiece, sharpened at the lower end, or  tipped with a small bronze share.      CROPS OF ANCIENT CANAAN    The Hebrews raised the same crops as the earlier Canaanites. The  leading ones were wheat, barley, olives, grapes, and figs. The two  grain crops were, of course, the most necessary to life. They were  planted in the early spring, and harvested in the summer. The grain  was sown broadcast, by hand, just as Jesus describes in his great  parable of the sower.    =Ancient agriculture.=--Harvesting and threshing were done almost  entirely by hand. The grain was cut with sickles. Some of the old  sickles have recently been found by investigators, buried deep in the  mounds where ruined Canaanite cities lie hidden. Some of these sickles  are of metal, and others are made of the jawbones of oxen or asses,  with sharp flints driven into the tooth sockets. After the grain was  cut it was tied in bundles and carried to the threshing floor, which  was usually a wide, level space of hard ground or rock. Oxen were  driven back and forth across the grain on the floor, drawing a heavy  weight, until all or nearly all the kernels were shaken or crushed out  of the heads. It usually took several days to thresh all the grain  from an average-sized field. Then the straw was raked away, and the  grain was left mixed with chaff and dust. The next windy day the  winnowers, with large \"fans,\" or wooden shovels, came and tossed the  mingled chaff and dust and grain in the wind. The kernels of wheat  fell back and the chaff and dust were blown away. Last of all, the  good clean grain was gathered in baskets and bags, and hauled to the  farmer's house, or to the granary, which was a round brick building  standing beside or behind his house.      VINEYARDS AND OLIVES    Another new experience of the Hebrews in Canaan was the culture of  grapevines. The vineyards were often on hillsides, especially those  facing the south, and hence warmed by the early spring sunshine. The  soil on these hillsides had to be terraced so that the rain would not  wash it away. The vines had to be planted, trained on trellises, and  pruned. At the time of the grape harvest many of the grapes,  especially of the sweeter varieties, were set aside for raisins. They  were spread out on sheets in the hot sunshine until they were dry and  wrinkled. Then they were packed away in jars, where they settled into  delicious cakes. Figs were dried and packed in the same way.    =The manufacture of wine.=--Many of the grapes were used for wine. The  juice of these was trodden out in wine-presses. These were large  hollows several feet square, cut in the solid rock on the hillside.  There were always two of them, one lower than the other, with  connecting passages. The bunches of grapes were piled in great heaps  in the higher of the two, and then it was great fun for the boys and  girls and youths and maidens to jump barefooted and barelegged among  the purple clusters, and trample them until the foaming red juice ran  down into the lower of the stone chambers, where it was taken up with  gourd dippers and poured into skins. The youngsters would come home  with their legs and shirts all stained and spotted red.    =Olive orchards.=--Almost every Canaanite farm had a few olive trees  or a small olive orchard. The olives were prized for the oil which was  squeezed from them. This oil was used as we use butter, with bread and  in cooking. It was also burned in lamps. In fact, it was their chief  fuel for lighting purposes.    The olive press was a large stone with a hollow in the top. From the  bottom of the hollow, a hole was drilled through to the outside of the  stone. Across the hollow swung a wooden beam, one end riveted to a  tree or another stone, and the other end carrying weights.

No dog's voice had ever wakened the  echoes within fifty miles; but every sound of the wilderness he seemed  to know a thousand times better than I. The snapping of the smallest  stick under the stealthy tread of fox or wildcat would send him  scurrying out of sight in wild alarm; yet I watched a dozen of them  at play one night when a frightened moose went crashing through the  underbrush and plunged into the lake near by, and they did not seem to  mind it in the least.    The spot referred to was the only camping ground on the lake; so  Simmo, my Indian guide, assured me; and he knew very well. I  discovered afterward that it was the only cleared bit of land for  miles around; and this the rabbits knew very well. Right in the midst  of their best playground I pitched my tent, while Simmo built his  lean-to near by, in another little opening. We were tired that night,  after a long day's paddle in the sunshine on the river. The  after-supper chat before the camp fire--generally the most delightful  bit of the whole day, and prolonged as far as possible--was short and  sleepy; and we left the lonely woods to the bats and owls and creeping  things, and turned in for the night.    I was just asleep when I was startled by a loud thump twice repeated,  as if a man stamped on the ground, or, as I thought at the time, just  like the thump a bear gives an old log with his paw, to see if it is  hollow and contains any insects. I was wide awake in a moment, sitting  up straight to listen. A few minutes passed by in intense stillness;  then, _thump! thump! thump!_ just outside the tent among the ferns.    I crept slowly out; but beyond a slight rustle as my head appeared  outside the tent I heard nothing, though I waited several minutes and  searched about among the underbrush. But no sooner was I back in the  tent and quiet than there it was again, and repeated three or four  times, now here, now there, within the next ten minutes. I crept out  again, with no better success than before.    This time, however, I would find out about that mysterious noise  before going back. It isn't so pleasant to go to sleep until one knows  what things are prowling about, especially things that make a noise  like that. A new moon was shining down into the little clearing,  giving hardly enough light to make out the outlines of the great  evergreens. Down among the ferns things were all black and uniform.  For ten minutes I stood there in the shadow of a big spruce and  waited. Then the silence was broken by a sudden heavy thump in the  bushes just behind me. I was startled, and wheeled on the instant; as  I did so, some small animal scurried away into the underbrush.    For a moment I was puzzled. Then it flashed upon me that I was camped  upon the rabbits' playground. With the thought came a strong suspicion  that Bunny was fooling me.    Going back to the fire, I raked the coals together and threw on some  fresh fuel. Next I fastened a large piece of birch bark on two split  sticks behind the fireplace; then I sat down on an old log to wait.  The rude reflector did very well as the fire burned up. Out in front  the fern tops were dimly lighted to the edge of the clearing. As I  watched, a dark form shot suddenly above the ferns and dropped back  again. Three heavy thumps followed; then the form shot up and down  once more. This time there was no mistake. In the firelight I saw  plainly the dangle of Br'er Rabbit's long legs, and the flap of his  big ears, and the quick flash of his dark eyes in the reflected  light,--got an instantaneous photograph of him, as it were, at the top  of his comical jump.    I sat there nearly an hour before the why and the how of the little  joker's actions became quite clear. This is what happens in such a  case. Bunny comes down from the ridge for his nightly frolic in the  little clearing. While still in the ferns the big white object,  standing motionless in the middle of his playground, catches his  attention; and very much surprised, and very much frightened, but  still very curious, he crouches down close to wait and listen. But the  strange thing does not move nor see him. To get a better view he leaps  up high above the ferns two or three times. Still the big thing  remains quite still and harmless. \"Now,\" thinks Bunny, \"I'll frighten  him, and find out what he is.\" Leaping high he strikes the ground  sharply two or three times with his padded hind foot; then jumps up  quickly again to see the effect of his scare. Once he succeeded very  well, when he crept up close behind me, so close that he didn't have  to spring up to see the effect. I fancy him chuckling to himself as he  scurried off after my sudden start.    That was the first time that I ever heard Bunny's challenge. It  impressed me at the time as one of his most curious pranks; the sound  was so big and heavy for such a little fellow. Since then I have heard  it frequently; and now sometimes when I stand at night in the forest  and hear a sudden heavy thump in the underbrush, as if a big moose  were striking the ground and shaking his antlers at me, it doesn't  startle me in the least. It is only Br'er Rabbit trying to frighten  me.    The next night Bunny played us another trick. Before Simmo went to  sleep he always took off his blue overalls and put them under his head  for a pillow. That was only one of Simmo's queer ways. While he was  asleep the rabbits came into his little _commoosie_, dragged the  overalls out from under his head, and nibbled them full of holes. Not  content with this, they played with them all night; pulled them around  the clearing, as threads here and there plainly showed; then dragged  them away into the underbrush and left them.    Simmo's wrath when he at last found the precious garments was comical  to behold; when he wore them with their new polka-dot pattern, it was  still more comical. Why the rabbits did it I could never quite make  out. The overalls were very dirty, very much stained with everything  from a clean trout to tobacco crumbs; and, as there was nothing about  them for a rabbit to eat, we concluded that it was just one of Br'er  Rabbit's pranks. That night Simmo, to avenge his overalls, set a  deadfall supported by a piece of cord, which he had soaked in molasses  and salt. Which meant that Bunny would nibble the cord for the salt  that was in it, and bring the log down hard on his own back. So I had  to spring it, while Simmo slept, to save the little fellow's life and  learn more about him.    Up on the ridge above our tent was a third tiny clearing, where some  trappers had once made their winter camp. It was there that I watched  the rabbits one moonlight night from my seat on an old log, just  within the shadow at the edge of the opening. The first arrival came  in with a rush. There was a sudden scurry behind me, and over the log  he came with a flying leap that landed him on the smooth bit of ground  in the middle, where he whirled around and around with grotesque  jumps, like a kitten after its tail. Only Br'er Rabbit's tail was too  short for him ever to catch it; he seemed rather to be trying to get a  good look at it. Then he went off helter-skelter in a headlong rush  through the ferns. Before I knew what had become of him, over the log  he came again in a marvelous jump, and went tearing around the  clearing like a circus horse, varying his performance now by a high  leap, now by two or three awkward hops on his hind legs, like a  dancing bear. It was immensely entertaining.    The third time around he discovered me in the midst of one of his  antics. He was so surprised that he fell down. In a second he was up  again, sitting up very straight on his haunches just in front of me,  paws crossed, ears erect, eyes shining in fear and curiosity. \"Who are  you?\" he was saying, as plainly as ever rabbit said it. Without moving  a muscle I tried to tell him, and also that he need not be afraid.  Perhaps he began to understand, for he turned his head on one side,  just as a dog does when you talk to him. But he wasn't quite  satisfied. \"I'll try my scare on him,\" he thought; and _thump! thump!  thump!_ sounded his padded hind foot on the soft ground. It almost  made me start again, it sounded so big in the dead stillness. This  last test quite convinced him that I was harmless, and, after a  moment's watching, away he went in some astonishing jumps into the  forest.    A few minutes passed by in quiet waiting before he was back again,  this time with two or three companions. I have no doubt that he had  been watching me all the time, for I heard his challenge in the brush  just behind my log. The fun now began to grow lively. Around and  around they went, here, there, everywhere,--the woods seemed full of  rabbits, they scurried around so. Every few minutes the number  increased, as some new arrival came flying in and gyrated around like  a brown fur pinwheel. They leaped over everything in the clearing;  they leaped over each other as if playing leap-frog; they vied with  each other in the high jump. Sometimes they gathered together in the  middle of the open space and crept about close to the ground, in and  out and roundabout, like a game of fox and geese. Then they rose on  their hind legs and hopped slowly about in all the dignity of a  minuet. Right in the midst of the solemn affair some mischievous  fellow gave a squeak and a big jump; and away they all went  hurry-skurry, for all the world like a lot of boys turned loose for  recess. In a minute they were back again, quiet and sedate, and solemn  as bull-frogs. Were they chasing and chastising the mischief-maker, or  was it only the overflow of abundant spirits as the top of a kettle  blows off when the pressure below becomes resistless?    [Illustration]    Many of the rabbits saw me, I am sure, for they sometimes gave a high  jump over my foot; and one came close up beside it, and sat up  straight with his"]]]
