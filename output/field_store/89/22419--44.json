On  each side of the platform, B, which is of elliptical figure, is a  large float, seen in Fig. 3, which, by means of racks and gearing, may  be raised or lowered at will. Usually these floats are carried at a  height of a yard above the water. In calm weather, this distance is  increased, and in storms it is diminished, the object of the floats  being to keep the whole vessel on an even plane, and to prevent too  violent oscillations. In order to facilitate navigation in shallow  water, the columns, E, may be made telescopic, and operated by  hydraulic apparatus, so that they may be shortened at will. Any form  of engine or propeller may be used.    [Illustration: Fig. 3.--THE HEMI-PLUNGER ON A VOYAGE]    Besides the advantage of the vessel being unaffected by waves, since  its submerged portion travels far below them, the inventor claims that  it will meet less resistance from the water than would a vessel of  corresponding volume sailing on the surface. It will make faster  progress, because it has no waves to mount and descend; and hence it  always travels in a nearly right line. The screw being submerged at a  great depth will not tend to turn the vessel from her straight path.  The platform being easily detachable may serve as a raft in case of  injury to the submarine boat. For fast travel, on lakes, rivers, and  shallow water generally, M. Tommasi proposes to support his platform  on two floats which rest on the surface of the water. No weight,  therefore, is thrown on the submarine vessel, which need be  constructed with only just enough buoyancy to sustain itself and its  engine. In this way, the upper craft has no engine or other load than  its cargo; and as it merely rests upon the surface, the inventor  thinks that it will skim over the same like an ice boat on ice.    For war purposes, the hemi-plunger is especially adapted, because the  vulnerable portions, engines, boiler, rudder, etc., are wholly out of  the reach of shot. Guns are mounted on the platform, which thus  becomes a circular or elliptical turret, just above the water when the  vessel is in fighting trim. Instead of steel armor, M. Tommasi has a  new invention which he calls hydro-metallic plating. He reserves the  details of this for future publication; but generally the armor  consists of tubes in which liquid is forced under a pressure  equivalent to the resistance, say, of forged steel. He thinks this  will oppose shot as effectually as the solid metal, and will have the  additional advantage of superior lightness.             *       *       *       *       *    IN-SOLES saturated with salicylic acid have been introduced as a  remedy for perspiration of the feet.           *       *       *       *       *      SUPREME COURT PATENT DECISION.    A United States patent was granted May 23, 1854, to John Myers and  Robert G. Eunson for a wood-sawing machine for cutting boards into  thin stuff for making picture frame and mirror backs. One of the  principal claims was for the employment of two deflecting plates, one  on each side of the circular saw, by which both sides of the sawed  stuff, as fast as it was cut, was slightly deflected so as not to bind  upon the saw. Suit was brought by the patentee against Dunbar and  Hopper for infringement, and judgment was given in favor of the  patentees, in the United States Circuit Court, this city, the damages  awarded being $9,121. The defendants thereupon took an appeal to the  Supreme Court of the United States, which tribunal has reversed the  finding of the Circuit Court and dismissed the complaint. It was held  by the Supreme Court that, inasmuch as the use of a single deflecting  plate was old, well known, and in common use, it was simply an  exercise of ordinary mechanical skill, and not a patentable invention,  to employ a second deflecting plate, although the superiority of the  double deflectors, for certain kinds of work, appears to be conceded.           *       *       *       *       *          PLANING MILL MACHINERY.      The planing machine, next to the saw, is perhaps the most important  agent for the conversion and manipulation of wood in use; and before  proceeding to consider it, in its present form, says the author of  this article, Mr. F.H. Morse, in the _Northwestern Lumberman_, it may  not be out of place to notice briefly its origin and history.    The first man to employ power in the operation of smoothing the  surface of wood was Sir Samuel Bentham, of London, England, and to him  belongs the honor of having discovered the principle upon which all  planing machines operate. A brief personal notice of this remarkable  inventor will serve to show under what circumstances the planing  machine originated. His education was secured at the Westminster  school of London, and, as far as can be ascertained from the meager  records of his life that have come down to us, was of the most  thorough kind, both classical and scientific, that could be obtained  at that time (1770). When his education was finished, he was bound to  the master shipwright of the Woolwich dockyard, to whom he served an  apprenticeship of seven years, acquiring in that time a practical  knowledge of the methods of working in both wood and iron then in  vogue, and receiving the best scientific instruction that the  development of that period afforded. After his term of apprenticeship  had expired, he spent about two years in looking up the local  peculiarities of other shipyards whose methods of working differed in  some respects from those of the Woolwich mechanics.    In 1779 he was ordered by the government to examine into the progress  of shipbuilding in Northern Europe, and in carrying out this  commission he repaired to Russia, where he invented the first machine  for planing wood. Its mode of operation, whether reciprocating or  rotating, it is impossible to ascertain positively, but the conclusion  arrived at, after referring to the specifications of his first patent,  which was issued in 1791, is that it worked upon the former principle  by means closely analogous to the operation of planing by hand. He  seems to have made no use of his venture in Russia, though he resided  there several years and filled several important positions under the  Russian Government. He returned to his native country in 1791 and  joined his brother, Jeremy Bentham, who had at that time just received  an appointment from the government to introduce industrial prisons in  England. To utilize the unskilled labor of the convicts, the talents  of Sir Samuel were called into use, and he devised a number of new  machines, the greater part of which were for working wood. For want of  a more suitable place, these machines were constructed at the  residence of Jeremy Bentham, which was thus converted into the first  manufactory for woodworking machines. This factory was established in  1794, but was soon found to be too small for the purpose, and another  building was occupied. In a lecture before the Society of Arts, in  1853, Professor Willis, referring to the shops of the Benthams, stated  that \"there were constructed machines for all general operations in  woodwork, including planing, molding, rebating, grooving, mortising,  and sawing, both in coarse and fine work, in curved, winding, and  transverse directions, and shaping wood in complicated forms; and  further, as an example, that all parts of a highly finished window  sash are prepared, also all parts of an ornamented carriage wheel were  made so that nothing remained to be done by hand but to put the  component parts together.\"    In 1797 the Admiralty consented to the introduction of such of these  machines as could be used to advantage in the different dockyards, and  they were manufactured under the direction of Jeremy Bentham, and  forwarded from time to time to Portsmouth and Plymouth, where they  were used with good results, performing all that was claimed for them.    Bentham was joined in 1810 by another genius (formerly in the employ  of the brothers) by the name of Brunel, who had invented several  valuable machines, among which was one for shaping block shells, which  seems to have had Bentham's indorsement. As Inspector General, in  1803, Sir Samuel advised the Admiralty to introduce many of his new  machines, and also to permit the use of steam engines; accordingly,  the dockyards were fitted with engines for sawing, planing, boring,  tenoning, mortising, etc. The labor saved by their use can be inferred  from the fact that Brunel, who had assisted in their construction,  received as a premium for his inventions the amount saved in the yards  by their use in one year, which reached the respectable sum of  $80,000. In the same year the government settled with Jeremy Bentham,  after arbitration, and allowed him for machines furnished the yards  and prisons, $100,000. We learn from testimony given before the  arbitrators that \"Sir Samuel Bentham prepared a system of machinery  for the employment of men without skill, and particularly with a view  to utilizing convict labor. In 1793 patents were taken out on these  inventions to secure their exclusive use for the prisons.\" The  testimony states that no skill was required in the use of these  machines; they were introduced into the dockyards and worked by common  laborers. It was claimed that nine tenths of the labor was saved by  the use of Bentham's machines, which proves that they were at least  effective, which cannot be said in all cases of those of modern  manufacture.    The patent of Bentham, issued in 1793, is doubtless one of the most  remarkable ones ever issued, both for the importance of the inventions  it protected and the clearness with which they and the principles on  which they operated are described. Richards, in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19420"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of York (#7)"],[1,"  Albinus, should allude to a church other than the minster without giving  its name. It is, of course, just possible that Albert set up his altars  before rebuilding the cathedral, in which case Professor Willis'  contention would lose its force. It is curious that no other chronicler  mentions either the fire or the rebuilding of the church, but this  omission would be almost equally strange whether the building in  question were the minster or some important church in the diocese.    On the whole, therefore, it is perhaps most probable that the church  referred to by Flaccus Albinus was the minster. If that is so, this  church remained until it was ruined by the Danes in 1069. Then it was  certainly either wholly or partially burnt down. Thomas, the first  Norman archbishop, appointed in 1070, found the minster, the city, and  the diocese, all waste and desolate. At first he was satisfied with  roofing in what remained of the cathedral and otherwise restoring it as  best he could. Afterwards, before 1080, he began to rebuild it. It is  uncertain whether he rebuilt the whole church, or merely the nave and  transepts.    Stubbs on this point seems to give two different accounts.    \"Thomas,\" he states, \"restored the canons of the church after he had  rebuilt it as well as he could.\" Afterwards he says, \"He built the  church as it now is from its foundations.\"    Probably, this first passage refers to the immediate repairs which  Thomas found necessary in 1070, and the second to his ultimate  rebuilding of the church.    William of Malmesbury says that he began the church from its foundations  and finished it. In the face of this positive testimony it is probable  that Thomas built not only the nave but the choir. That he did so has  been doubted, because the choir of his day was undoubtedly a very small  one, and was afterwards demolished by Roger. It must, however, be  remembered that Lanfranc rebuilt Anselm's Norman choir at Canterbury in  the same way. It is very likely that Thomas was forced by necessity to  plan his work on as modest a scale as possible, and that the pride of  Roger would not allow the choir of his minster to remain one of the  smallest in the cathedrals of England.    The minster, as Thomas left it, was utterly unlike the present church.  The nave was probably shorter than the present one, and was certainly  twenty feet narrower. This was discovered after the fire of 1840, when  remains of the side aisle walls of Thomas's nave were discovered. There  are no data for the number of piers in this nave or for the position of  the west front.    The tower certainly stood on the site of the present tower, as Roman  ashlaring has been discovered on the north-west side of the north-west  tower pier, above the vault of the side aisle, and also portions of a  shaft with a base, which probably belonged to the Norman clerestory. It  will be seen that the present piers supporting the central tower contain  cores of Norman work recased in Perpendicular times.    The transepts of Thomas's church appear to have been without aisles. The  remains in the crypt show that there were two eastern apses to these  transepts close to the central tower, and Professor Willis deduces from  the position of these apses that they left no room for eastern aisles.  There is no instance in existence of a transept having western without  eastern aisles. One may therefore conclude that aisles were entirely  wanting. Professor Willis thinks it possible that an additional pair of  apses may have existed on the east side of these transepts, to the north  and south respectively of these already discovered. This was certainly  the case in St. Mary's Abbey.    As has been mentioned, considerable doubts still exist as to the size  and character of the choir of Thomas's church.    On the one hand we have positive testimony that Thomas rebuilt the whole  church; on the other, the walls of the crypt, as they existed up to the  time of Roger's choir, are a part of the Saxon church. Their masonry is  Saxon, and they mark the lines of a chancel far too narrow to have been  that of Thomas, even if we suppose that his choir was necessarily small,  from the want of funds at his command, and the wasted condition of the  diocese.    This would seem to support the theory that Thomas left the Saxon choir  as it was, and contented himself with rebuilding the ruined nave and  transepts. In that case, of course, the Saxon choir remained until the  time of Roger.    The alternate theory is that Thomas rebuilt an enlarged, but still a  small, choir, leaving the Saxon crypt as it remains to this day; and  that even this choir proved too small for the magnificent ideas of  Roger, who utterly demolished it to make room for his own great  building, leaving no trace of it above ground. This is the more probable  supposition, and it is supported by the fact that the inner wall of the  crypt is composed of fragments of masonry, buildings, etc., of early  Norman date, which might well be parts of Thomas's choir, if it was  destroyed, as we suppose. Some of the stones are covered with white  plaster, showing they are parts of the interior of a building, and they  are of the same red sandstone as the remains of the transept apse, which  was undoubtedly built by Thomas.    As has been said, the choir of the minster remained unusually small for  so important a church. The eleventh and twelfth centuries were periods  of great activity in church building, and many of the Norman architects  planned their works on a vast scale. With the examples of Durham,  Winchester, and St. Albans before them, it was natural that the  archbishops of the Metropolitan Church of York should be dissatisfied  with the size of their own choir. It fell to the lot of Roger, the rival  of Thomas a Becket, to rebuild it. The date of his nave is approximately  1154-1181. The remains of his work in the crypt show that it was in the  latest style of Norman architecture and considerably influenced by  Flambard's work at Durham, with channeled and fluted pillars. The detail  appears to have been richer and later in character even than Flambard's.  The outer wall of the crypt shows the dimensions of this choir. It was  square at the end, and had flanking towers--two bays from the  east--which served as transepts inside. The eastern transepts of the  present choir still keep the position and tradition of these towers. The  aisle probably ran round the east end as at Romsey and Byland. The two  bays east of the tower were wider than the others. Roger, it should be  said, had been Archdeacon of Canterbury, and he was therefore well  acquainted with the \"glorious Choir of Conrad\" built by Anselm. There is  much in the planning of his work to show that he was influenced by the  example of Conrad's choir.    [Illustration: The Minster (from an Old Print).]    At the end of the twelfth century the minster was utterly unlike the  present building. Except in the crypt, and in certain parts of the nave  and tower not visible to the casual observer, there are no vestiges of  the work of the earlier builders. There is now no Norman work to be seen  in the minster itself, and in 1200, nave, choir, transepts, and towers  were all Norman. Of these the transepts appear to have been the poorest  part. They were probably short, and had no aisles. The nave also was of  rude Early Norman character. The Early English architects having  determined, probably, to rebuild the nave and transepts, made a  beginning with the transepts about 1230. Roger's choir, only finished  about fifty years before, no doubt seemed to them grand enough. The  transepts were built on a totally different scale to the rest of the  church as it then stood. They were both longer and broader, and they had  aisles on each side of them. No doubt the object of this was to get a  standard for the ultimate rebuilding of the nave. The greater width of  these transepts made it difficult to join their aisles with those of the  nave and choir, and were the cause of a curious and daring expedient,  which will be described in the architectural account of the building.  The south transept was the first to be rebuilt. It is the work of Walter  de Gray, archbishop from 1216 to 1265, who was buried under an arch of  his own building, in a tomb which still remains the most beautiful,  perhaps, in the minster. The north transept seems to have been begun as  soon as the south was finished; it is said to have been the work of John  Romeyn, or the Roman, an Italian, and the treasurer of York. Walter de  Gray probably also had a large part in the building of them. These  transepts are the earliest part of the existing minster. John Romeyn  also built an Early English central tower in place of Thomas's Early  Norman tower. It remained for John Romeyn the younger, son of the  treasurer, and archbishop from 1286 to 1296, to begin the rebuilding of  the nave. It was planned on a far larger scale than the old nave, and  was wider even than the Early English transepts. The old nave had been  83 feet wide, the transepts were 95, and the new nave 103. The  difference in width between the transepts and the new nave is in the  aisles. The plan of the transepts had no influence on the plan of the  nave. The large triforium, small clerestory, and moderate-sized main  arches give way to a large clerestory, large main arches, and  practically non-existent triforium. These are unusual proportions in  English Churches of that period. At Ely, Westminster, Beverley, and many  other places, the proportions of Norman or Early English work influenced  those of the later Decorated and Perpendicular.    The records of the building of the nave are somewhat scanty. Stubbs  tells us that the foundation stone was laid on April 6, 1291, and that  it was begun on the south side towards the east. It has been supposed  that the chief object of making the new nave so much wider and loftier"]]]
