(#7)"],[1," at the same time, they had ever been  careful secretly to advertise the persons, that they might be enabled  to make their escape. This precaution was eluded by the vigilance and  despatch of Downing. He quickly seized the criminals, hurried them on  board a frigate which lay off the coast, and sent them to England. These  three men behaved with more moderation and submission than any of the  other regicides who had suffered. Okey in particular, at the place of  execution, prayed for the king, and expressed his intention, had he  lived, of submitting peaceably to the established government. He had  risen, during the wars, from being a chandler in London, to a high rank  in the army; and in all his conduct appeared to be a man of humanity  and honor. In consideration of his good character and of his dutiful  behavior, his body was given to his friends to be buried.    The attention of the public was much engaged by the trial of two  distinguished criminals, Lambert and Vane. These men, though none of the  late king's judges, had been excepted from the general indemnity,  and committed to prison. The convention parliament, however, was so  favorable to them, as to petition the king, if they should be found  guilty, to suspend their execution: but this new parliament, more  zealous for monarchy, applied for their trial and condemnation. Not to  revive disputes which were better buried in oblivion, the indictment of  Vane did not comprehend any of his actions during the war between the  king and parliament: it extended only to his behavior after the late  king's death, as member of the council of state, and secretary of the  navy, where fidelity to the trust reposed in him required his opposition  to monarchy.    Vane wanted neither courage nor capacity to avail himself of this  advantage. He urged that, if a compliance with the government at that  time established in England, and the acknowledging of its authority,  were to be regarded as criminal, the whole nation had incurred equal  guilt, and none would remain whose innocence could entitle them to try  or condemn him for his pretended treasons: that, according to these  maxims, wherever an illegal authority was established by force, a total  and universal destruction must ensue; while the usurpers proscribed  one part of the nation for disobedience, the lawful prince punished the  other for compliance: that the legislature of England, foreseeing  this violent situation, had provided for public security by the famous  statute of Henry VII.; in which it was enacted that no man, in case of  any revolution, should ever be questioned for his obedience to the king  in being: that whether the established government were a monarchy or a  commonwealth, the reason of the thing was still the same; nor ought the  expelled prince to think himself entitled to allegiance, so long as he  could not afford protection: that it belonged not to private persons,  possessed of no power, to discuss the title of their governors;  and every usurpation, even the most flagrant, would equally require  obedience with the most legal establishment: that the controversy  between the late king and his parliament was of the most delicate  nature; and men of the greatest probity had been divided in their choice  of the party which they should embrace; that the parliament, being  rendered indissoluble but by its own consent, was become a kind of  cooerdinate power with the king; and as the case was thus entirely new  and unknown to the constitution, it ought not to be tried rigidly by the  letter of the ancient laws: that for his part, all the violences which  had been put upon the parliament, and upon the person of the sovereign,  he had ever condemned; nor had he once in the house for some time before  and after the execution of the king: that, finding the whole government  thrown into disorder, he was still resolved, in every revolution,  to adhere to the commons, the root, the foundation, of all lawful  authority: that in prosecution of this principle, he had cheerfully  under gone all the violence of Cromwell's tyranny; and would now with  equal alacrity, expose himself to the rigors of perverted law and  justice: that though it was in his power, on the king's restoration, to  have escaped from his enemies, he was determined, in imitation of the  most illustrious names of antiquity, to perish in defence of liberty,  and to give testimony with his blood for that honorable cause in which  he had been enlisted; and that, besides the ties by which God and nature  had bound him to his native country, he was voluntarily engaged by the  most sacred covenant, whose obligation no earthly power should ever be  able to make him relinquish.    All the defence which Vane could make was fruitless. The court,  considering more the general opinion of his active guilt in the  beginning and prosecution of the civil wars, than the articles of  treason charged against him, took advantage of the letter of the  law, and brought him in guilty. His courage deserted him not upon his  condemnation. Though timid by nature, the persuasion of a just cause  supported him against the terrors of death, while his enthusiasm,  excited by the prospect of glory, embellished the conclusion of a life,  which through the whole course of it, had been so much disfigured by the  prevalence of that principle. Lest pity for a courageous sufferer  should make impression on the populace, drummers were placed under the  scaffold, whose noise, as he began to launch out in reflections on the  government, drowned his voice, and admonished him to temper the ardor of  his zeal. He was not astonished at this unexpected incident. In all  his behavior there appeared a firm and animated intrepidity; and he  considered death but as a passage to that eternal felicity which he  believed to be prepared for him.    This man, so celebrated for his parliamentary talents, and for his  capacity in business, has left some writings behind him: they treat, all  of them, of religious subjects, and are absolutely unintelligible: no  traces of eloquence, or even of common sense, appear in them. A strange  paradox! did we not know, that men of the greatest genius, where they  relinquish by principle the use of their reason, are only enabled,  by their vigor of mind, to work themselves the deeper into error and  absurdity. It was remarkable, that as Vane, by being the chief  instrument of Strafford's death, had first opened the way for that  destruction which overwhelmed the nation, so by his death he closed the  scene of blood. He was the last that suffered on account of the civil  wars. Lambert, though condemned, was reprieved at the bar; and the  judges declared, that if Vane's behavior had been equally dutiful and  submissive, he would have experienced like lenity in the king. Lambert  survived his condemnation near thirty years. He was confined to the Isle  of Guernsey, where he lived contented, forgetting all his past schemes  of greatness, and entirely forgotten by the nation. He died a Roman  Catholic.    However odious Vane and Lambert were to the Presbyterians, that  party had no leisure to rejoice at their condemnation. The fatal St.  Bartholomew approached; the day when the clergy were obliged, by the  late law, either to relinquish their livings, or to sign the articles  required of them. A combination had been entered into by the more  zealous of the Presbyterian ecclesiastics to refuse the subscription,  in hopes that the bishops would not venture at once to expel so great a  number of the most popular preachers. The Catholic party at court, who  desired a great rent among the Protestants, encouraged them in this  obstinacy, and gave them hopes that the king would protect them in  their refusal. The king himself, by his irresolute conduct, contributed,  either from design or accident, to increase this opinion. Above all,  the terms of subscription had been made strict and rigid, on purpose  to disgust all the zealous and scrupulous among the Presbyterians, and  deprive them of their livings. About two thousand of the clergy, in one  day, relinquished their cures; and, to the astonishment of the court,  sacrificed their interest to their religious tenets. Fortified  by society in their sufferings, they were resolved to undergo any  hardships, rather than openly renounce those principles, which, on other  occasions, they were so apt, from interest, to warp or elude. The church  enjoyed the pleasure of retaliation; and even pushed, as usual,  the vengeance farther than the offence. During the dominion of the  parliamentary party, a fifth of each living had been left to the ejected  clergyman; but this indulgence, though at first insisted on by the house  of peers, was now refused to the Presbyterians. However difficult to  conciliate peace among theologians, it was hoped by many, that some  relaxation in the terms of communion might have kept the Presbyterians  united to the church, and have cured those ecclesiastical factions which  had been so fatal, and were still so dangerous. Bishoprics were offered  to Calamy, Baxter, and Reynolds, leaders among the Presbyterians:  the last only could be prevailed on to accept. Deaneries and other  preferments were refused by many.    The next measure of the king has not had the good fortune to be  justified by any party, but is often considered, on what grounds I shall  not determine, as one of the greatest mistakes, if not blemishes, of his  reign. It is the sale of Dunkirk to the French. The parsimonious maxims  of the parliament, and the liberal, or rather careless disposition of  Charles, were ill suited to each other; and notwithstanding the supplies  voted him, his treasury was still very empty and very much indebted. He  had secretly received the sum of two hundred thousand crowns from France  for the support of Portugal, but the forces sent over to that country,  and the fleets maintained in order to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19217"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol.II. (#7)"],[1,"according to his pleasure; and the  superiority of any office in the church above that of presbyters. The  king in his instructions to the lord commissioner, consented to the  regulation of the lords of the articles, though he would not allow the  institution to be abrogated; he was contented that the act relating to  the king's supremacy should be rescinded, and that the church government  should be established in such a manner as would be most agreeable to the  inclinations of the people.          PRELACY ABOLISHED IN SCOTLAND.    On the seventeenth day of June, duke Hamilton opened the Scottish  parliament, after the convention had assumed this name, in consequence  of an act passed by his majesty's direction; but the members in general  were extremely chagrined when they found the commissioners so much  restricted in the affair of the lords of the articles, which they  considered as their chief grievance. [008] _[See note D, at the end of  this Vol.]_ The king permitted that the estates should choose the lords  by their own suffrages, and that they should be at liberty to reconsider  any subject which the said lords might reject. He afterwards indulged  the three estates with the choice of eleven delegates each, for this  committee, to be elected monthly, or oftener if they should think fit:  but even these concessions proved unsatisfactory while the institution  itself remained. Their discontents were not even appeased by the passing  of an act abolishing prelacy. Indeed their resentment was inflamed by  another consideration, namely, that of the king's having given seats  in the council to some individuals attached to the hierarchy. They  manifested their sentiments on this subject by bringing in a bill  excluding from any public trust, place, or employment under their  majesties, all such as had been concerned in the encroachments of the  late reign, or had discovered disaffection to the late happy change, or  in any way retarded or obstructed the designs of the convention. This  measure was prosecuted with great warmth; and the bill passed through  all the forms of the house, but proved ineffectual for want of the royal  assent.          DISPUTES IN THE PARLIAMENT.    Nor were they less obstinate in the affair of the judges whom the  king had ventured to appoint by virtue of his own prerogative. The  malcontents brought in a bill declaring the bench vacant, as it was at  the restoration; asserting their own right to examine and approve those  who should appointed to fill it; providing that if in time to come any  such total vacancy should occur, the nomination should be in the king or  queen, or regent for the time being, and the parliament retain the right  of approbation; and that all the clauses in the several acts relating to  the admission of the ordinary lords of session, and their qualifications  for that office, should be ratified and confirmed for perpetual  observation. Such was the interest of this party, that the bill was  carried by a great majority, notwithstanding the opposition of the  ministers, who resolved to maintain the king's nomination even in  defiance of a parliamentary resolution. The majority, exasperated at  this open violation of their privileges, forbade the judges whom the  king had appointed to open their commissions, or hold a session until  his majesty's further pleasure should be known: on the other hand they  were compelled to act by the menaces of the privy-council. The dispute  was carried on with great acrimony on both sides, and produced such a  ferment, that before the session opened, the ministry thought proper  to draw a great number of forces into the neighbourhood of Edinburgh to  support the judges in the exercise of their functions.          SCOTCH PARLIAMENT ADJOURNED.    The lord commissioner, alarmed at this scene of tumult and confusion,  adjourned the house till the eighth day of October; a step which, added  to the other unpopular measures of the court, incensed the opposition to  a violent degree. They drew up a remonstrance to the king, complaining  of this adjournment while the nation was yet unsettled, recapitulating  the several instances in which they had expressed their zeal and  affection for his majesty; explaining their reasons for dissenting from  the ministry in some articles; beseeching him to consider what they had  represented, to give his royal assent to the acts of parliament which  they had prepared, and take measures for redressing all the other  grievances of the nation. This address was presented to the king at  Hampton-court. William was so touched with the reproaches it implied, as  if he had not fulfilled the conditions on which he accepted the crown of  Scotland, that he, in his own vindication, published his instructions  to the commissioner; and by these it appeared that the duke might have  proceeded to greater lengths in obliging his countrymen. Before the  adjournment, however, the parliament had granted the revenue for life;  and raised money for maintaining a body of forces, as well as for  supporting the incidental expense of the government for some months; yet  part of the troops in that kingdom were supplied and subsisted by the  administration of England. In consequence of these disputes in the  Scottish parliament, their church was left without any settled form of  government; for, though the hierarchy was abolished, the presbyterian  discipline was not yet established, and ecclesiastical affairs were  occasionally regulated by the privy-council, deriving its authority from  that very act of supremacy, which, according to the claim of rights,  ought to have been repealed.          THE CASTLE OF EDINBURGH BESIEGED.    The session was no sooner adjourned than sir John Lanier converted the  blockade of Edinburgh castle into a regular siege, which was prosecuted  with such vigour that in a little time the fortifications were ruined,  and the works advanced at the foot of the walls, in which the besiegers  had made several large breaches. The duke of Gordon, finding his  ammunition expended, his defences destroyed, his intelligence entirely  cut off, and despairing of relief from the adherents of his master,  desired to capitulate, and obtained very favourable terms for his  garrison; but he would not stipulate any conditions for himself,  declaring that he had so much respect for all the princes descended from  king James VI. that he would not affront any of them so far as to insist  upon terms for his own particular: he therefore, on the thirteenth day  of June, surrendered the castle and himself at discretion. All the hopes  of James and his party were now concentred in the viscount Dundee, who  had assembled a body of Highlanders, and resolved to attack Mackay, on  an assurance he had received by message, that the regiment of Scottish  dragoons would desert that officer, and join him in the action. Mackay  having received intimation of this design, decamped immediately, and by  long marches retired before Dundee, until he was reinforced by Ramsey's  dragoons, and another regiment of English infantry: then he faced about,  and Dundee in his turn retreated into Lochaber. Lord Murray, son of the  marquis of Athol, assembled his vassals, to the number of twelve hundred  men, for the service of the regency; but he was betrayed by one of his  own dependents, who seized the castle of Blair for Dundee, and prevailed  upon the Athol men to disperse, rather than fight against James their  lawful sovereign.    {WILLIAM AND MARY, 1688--1701.}          KING WILLIAM'S TROOPS DEFEATED.    The viscount was by this time reduced to great difficulty and distress.  His men had not for many weeks tasted bread or salt, or any drink but  water: instead of five hundred infantry, three hundred horse, with a  supply of arms, ammunition, and provision, which James had promised to  send from Ireland, he received a reinforcement of three hundred naked  recruits; but the transports with the stores fell into the hands of the  English. Though this was a mortifying disappointment, he bore it without  repining; and, far from abandoning himself to despair, began his march  to the castle of Blair, which was threatened with a seige by general  Mackay. When he reached this fortress, he received intelligence that the  enemy had entered the pass of Killycrankie, and he resolved to give  them battle without delay. He accordingly advanced against them, and  a furious engagement ensued, though it was not of long duration. The  Highlanders having received and returned the fire of the English, fell  in among them sword in hand with such impetuosity, that the foot were  utterly broke in seven minutes. The dragoons fled at the first charge  in the utmost consternation. Dundee's horse, not exceeding one hundred,  broke through Mackay's own regiment; the earl of Dumbarton, at the  head of a few volunteers, made himself master of the artillery: twelve  hundred of Mackay's forces were killed on the spot, five hundred taken  prisoners, and the rest fled with great precipitation for some hours,  until they were rallied by their general, who was an officer of approved  courage, conduct, and experience. Nothing could be more complete or  decisive than the victory which the Highlanders obtained; yet it was  clearly purchased with the death of their beloved chieftain the viscount  Dundee, who fell by a random shot in the engagement, and his fate  produced such confusion in his army as prevented all pursuit. He  possessed an enterprising spirit, undaunted courage, inviolable  fidelity, and was peculiarly qualified to command the people who fought  under his banner. He was the life and soul of that cause which he  espoused, and after his death it daily declined into ruin and disgrace.  He was succeeded in command by colonel Cannon, who landed the  reinforcement from Ireland; but all his designs miscarried; so that the  clans, wearied with repeated misfortunes, laid "]]]
