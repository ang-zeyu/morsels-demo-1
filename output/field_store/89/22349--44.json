Another defect in the present law is that it fails to secure a  supply of good fish to the upper proprietors. There are no  provisions in it (or they are not enforced) for giving the fish a  free passage, no prohibition of nets, traps, or devices for  stopping them in their progress up the rivers. No daily or weekly  close time, but everywhere there is so short-sighted a selfishness,  that it is completely realizing the fable of the man who killed the  goose which laid the golden egg. The fisheries are declining so  rapidly, that unless something is done, and done quickly, the breed  of Salmon will be extinct in the rivers in this neighbourhood.    Again, there is no power to appoint or pay conservators, and  without their assistance there is no chance of preserving Salmon  in the spawning beds. Game-keepers are most certainly not to be  depended upon.    In pointing out the defects of the present laws I have, in fact,  given an opinion how they should be remedied. I would extend the  close time from the end of September to the end of April. I would  establish a daily close time, allowing no net, device, or engine  to be employed in taking Salmon between sunset and sunrise above  tideway in any river; and below, I would only allow nets to be set  for twelve hours per diem. I would appoint conservators, whom I  would pay by a tax on the fisheries on the whole course of the  river, which tax should be determined by a valuation of the  fisheries, and paid accordingly. I would fine every one who sold,  used, or had in his possession any potted or prepared Salmon roe  for the purpose of angling, and I would give conservators the  power of examining all mill goits and races, for the purpose of  seeing that no unfair practices were resorted to for the taking of  Salmon or Salmon fry; and I would give the upper proprietors the  power of making any alterations in mill weirs and dams which did  not impair their stability or the efficiency of the water power.  If some such enactments as these were made and properly enforced,  there is no doubt Salmon would swarm in every river, for their  fecundity is such, that a very few Salmon spawning in a river  under favourable circumstances stock it abundantly with Smolts. A  large Salmon having not less than 25,000 eggs in it, how soon,  with a little forbearance and care, would every river swarm with  this delicious fish, even to such a degree as to be a cheap food  for the poor! But to obtain such results it must be made the  interest of every person to protect them.    In reading over the evidence on the Salmon fisheries, which was  given before the House of Commons in 1825, I was exceedingly  amused by the reasons given by the tenants of some of the  fisheries in Scotland why there should be no weekly close time,  and the shifts and evasions practiced by others. One said he paid  L7,000 a year rent to the Duke of Gordon for his fishery, and if  one day in the week were allowed for close time he would lose  L1,000 a year. Another said he kept the close time, but he would  allow nobody to go and see whether he kept the free gap open or  not. Another proved that he kept open the free passage, but it was  also proved that he had a crocodile placed in the gap, painted  with very glaring colours, in order to frighten back any fish that  attempted to pass. Another sent his boats to break down the stake  nets which were set in the estuary, but acknowledged that he kept  his own nets set across the river day and night. There would be no  difficulty in stocking every suitable river in the kingdom with  Salmon, either by putting into them a few pairs of breeding fish,  or by artificially fecundating the eggs, and placing them in  artificial spawning beds. It is a plan I have frequently adopted,  and sometimes successfully; but in other experiments I have  failed, from the difficulty of choosing a suitable locality in the  river. If too rapid a stream was chosen, the eggs and gravel were  all washed away; and if too calm and still a place was selected,  the gravel was filled up with sand and mud, and the eggs rotted  instead of hatching. I am even of opinion that where there is  already a breed of Salmon fry in a river, it is not absolutely  necessary that any male Salmon should come up the river in the  spawning season, the male Par, or Penks, as we call them in the  Ribble, being sufficient to fecundate the eggs. If this is  doubted, I would ask how it happens that in the autumn they have  fluid milt in them? for as nature makes no unnecessary provisions,  for what purpose is this, if not to provide for the possibility of  a female Salmon coming alone? These Pars swarm on the Salmon  spawning beds.    * * * * *    SUGGESTIONS FOR AN ALTERATION IN THE LAWS REGARDING SALMON.    CLITHEROE, _October 12th_, 1851.    To the Editor of the \"Gardeners' Chronicle.\"    As the amusement of fly-fishing is one which holds a first place  in the opinion of every one who understands it, and as the Trout  and the Salmon are the only fish which afford genuine sport to the  angler, and as I believe that the latter in some of the southern  counties is nearly extinct, whilst the former is far from being  abundant, I wish to call the attention of such of your readers as  are possessed by the true _piscatorial furor_, to the facility  with which these fish can be bred artificially. And as many  experiments have been made under my direction, and having  witnessed the results, I unhesitatingly say that there is little  risk of failure, if due care be taken.    The experiments of Shaw and Agassiz, my own also included, have  proved that fish can be bred artificially. The experiments of  Boccius I have not yet tried, although he proposes to arrive at  the same result in another manner, and acting in the manner  recommended by them, Trout and Salmon have been bred by thousands  during the last ten years.    As the season for making the experiment will shortly be here, I  hope that those who intend to try the plan will lose no time in  looking after their supply of breeding fish.    To begin with Trout:--Catch as many as you can conveniently obtain  upon the spawning beds, [6] and examine them carefully one by one,  to see that the spawn and milt are in a fit state for exclusion;  and also to enable you to separate the males from the females. If  they are in a fit state to be operated upon (which may be known by  the facility with which the milt and the roe run from them on a  slight pressure), squeeze the milt of the males into a little  water, and when you have obtained all the milt you can get, add so  much water that the mixture remains slightly opalescent--say about  equal in colour to a tablespoonful of milk mixed in a quart of  water; pour this into a deep dish or bowl, large enough to hold  the largest of your female Trouts; take one of these and put it  into the water so prepared, and gently squeeze the roe from it  whilst the vent is immersed in the water. [7] Do this as quickly as  possible, and return the fish into fresh water, and then pour off  the water containing the impregnated roe, through a strainer,  carefully preserving it for the remaining fish, and immediately  return the roe into fresh spring or brook water. Repeat the  operation for every female Trout, and you will then have a  quantity of impregnated roe, which if properly managed will hatch  with great certainty. Have ready as many boxes as you are able to  stock with spawn (three feet long, two feet broad, and six inches  deep). Fill them to the depth of two inches of river sand, which  ought to be previously so well washed that there is not a particle  of mud left in it, and upon that put two inches of river gravel,  also exceedingly well washed, the pebbles varying in size from a  hazel nut to a pigeon or pullet's egg. These boxes must be so  placed that the water from a spring will flow into the first, and  from the surface of that into the second, and below the whole nest  of boxes there ought to be a small reservoir made--say three yards  by two and eighteen inches deep, and well gravelled at the bottom.  All these matters having been previously arranged, and the water  flowing nicely over the gravel, sprinkle the impregnated roe  equally over the surface of the gravel, say a quarter of a pint to  each box, and it will roll down into the interstices of the gravel  and find a bed in which it will remain snugly until the spring,  when, about March, if all has been properly managed, you will  find, on a careful examination, that the young Trout are coming to  life by hundreds. I am very particular in recommending spring  rather than brook water, for several reasons. In the first place,  brooks are liable to be flooded, and are sometimes so overcharged  with sand and mud that the gravel in the spawning-boxes is  completely choked with it and the spawn is lost, as I know to my  great and frequent disappointments. At other times all is washed  away together. In the second place, the gravel of brooks swarms  with water-lice (shrimps) and the larvae of aquatic insects, as  well as bull-heads and loaches, all of which prey upon the spawn  of the Trout and Salmon. In the third place, if you put your  spawning-boxes in a brook, you will find it difficult to prevent  the escape of the fry when hatched, and you are left in doubt as  to the success of your experiment. With spring water all these  inconveniences are avoided. But if your watercourse should contain  water-lice or aquatic larvae, it is a very easy matter to destroy  them before putting in your boxes, with a little salt or  quicklime. It is also desirable to cover your spawning-boxes with  a wire grating, to exclude the light, and to protect them in  severe weather from the chance of being frozen.    When they begin to hatch, open a communication between the boxes  and the little reservoir"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1831"],[0,"The Lock and Key Library: Classic Mystery and Detective Stories: Old Time (#7)"],[1," It calls to me,  for many minutes together, in an agonised manner, 'Below there!  Look out!  Look out!'  It stands waving to me.  It rings my little  bell--\"    I caught at that.  \"Did it ring your bell yesterday evening when I  was here, and you went to the door?\"    \"Twice.\"    \"Why, see,\" said I, \"how your imagination misleads you.  My eyes  were on the bell, and my ears were open to the bell, and if I am a  living man, it did NOT ring at those times.  No, nor at any other  time, except when it was rung in the natural course of physical  things by the station communicating with you.\"    He shook his head.  \"I have never made a mistake as to that yet,  sir.  I have never confused the spectre's ring with the man's.  The  ghost's ring is a strange vibration in the bell that it derives  from nothing else, and I have not asserted that the bell stirs to  the eye.  I don't wonder that you failed to hear it.  But I heard  it.\"    \"And did the spectre seem to be there, when you looked out?\"    \"It WAS there.\"    \"Both times?\"    He repeated firmly:  \"Both times.\"    \"Will you come to the door with me, and look for it now?\"    He bit his under lip as though he were somewhat unwilling, but  arose.  I opened the door, and stood on the step, while he stood in  the doorway.  There was the Danger-light.  There was the dismal  mouth of the tunnel.  There were the high, wet stone walls of the  cutting.  There were the stars above them.    \"Do you see it?\" I asked him, taking particular note of his face.  His eyes were prominent and strained, but not very much more so,  perhaps, than my own had been when I had directed them earnestly  towards the same spot.    \"No,\" he answered.  \"It is not there.\"    \"Agreed,\" said I.    We went in again, shut the door, and resumed our seats.  I was  thinking how best to improve this advantage, if it might be called  one, when he took up the conversation in such a matter-of-course  way, so assuming that there could be no serious question of fact  between us, that I felt myself placed in the weakest of positions.    \"By this time you will fully understand, sir,\" he said, \"that what  troubles me so dreadfully is the question, What does the spectre  mean?\"    I was not sure, I told him, that I did fully understand.    \"What is its warning against?\" he said, ruminating, with his eyes  on the fire, and only by times turning them on me.  \"What is the  danger?  Where is the danger?  There is danger overhanging  somewhere on the Line.  Some dreadful calamity will happen.  It is  not to be doubted this third time, after what has gone before.  But  surely this is a cruel haunting of ME.  What can I do?\"    He pulled out his handkerchief, and wiped the drops from his heated  forehead.    \"If I telegraph Danger, on either side of me, or on both, I can  give no reason for it,\" he went on, wiping the palms of his hands.  \"I should get into trouble, and do no good.  They would think I was  mad.  This is the way it would work,--Message:  'Danger!  Take  care!'  Answer:  'What Danger?  Where?'  Message:  'Don't know.  But, for God's sake, take care!'  They would displace me.  What  else could they do?\"    His pain of mind was most pitiable to see.  It was the mental  torture of a conscientious man, oppressed beyond endurance by an  unintelligible responsibility involving life.    \"When it first stood under the Danger-light,\" he went on, putting  his dark hair back from his head, and drawing his hands outward  across and across his temples in an extremity of feverish distress,  \"why not tell me where that accident was to happen,--if it must  happen?  Why not tell me how it could be averted,--if it could have  been averted?  When on its second coming it hid its face, why not  tell me, instead, 'She is going to die.  Let them keep her at  home'?  If it came, on those two occasions, only to show me that  its warnings were true, and so to prepare me for the third, why not  warn me plainly now?  And I, Lord help me!  A mere poor signal-man  on this solitary station!  Why not go to somebody with credit to be  believed, and power to act?\"    When I saw him in this state, I saw that for the poor man's sake,  as well as for the public safety, what I had to do for the time was  to compose his mind.  Therefore, setting aside all question of  reality or unreality between us, I represented to him that whoever  thoroughly discharged his duty must do well, and that at least it  was his comfort that he understood his duty, though he did not  understand these confounding Appearances.  In this effort I  succeeded far better than in the attempt to reason him out of his  conviction.  He became calm; the occupations incidental to his post  as the night advanced began to make larger demands on his  attention: and I left him at two in the morning.  I had offered to  stay through the night, but he would not hear of it.    That I more than once looked back at the red light as I ascended  the pathway, that I did not like the red light, and that I should  have slept but poorly if my bed had been under it, I see no reason  to conceal.  Nor did I like the two sequences of the accident and  the dead girl.  I see no reason to conceal that either.    But what ran most in my thoughts was the consideration how ought I  to act, having become the recipient of this disclosure?  I had  proved the man to be intelligent, vigilant, painstaking, and exact;  but how long might he remain so, in his state of mind?  Though in a  subordinate position, still he held a most important trust, and  would I (for instance) like to stake my own life on the chances of  his continuing to execute it with precision?    Unable to overcome a feeling that there would be something  treacherous in my communicating what he had told me to his  superiors in the Company, without first being plain with himself  and proposing a middle course to him, I ultimately resolved to  offer to accompany him (otherwise keeping his secret for the  present) to the wisest medical practitioner we could hear of in  those parts, and to take his opinion.  A change in his time of duty  would come round next night, he had apprised me, and he would be  off an hour or two after sunrise, and on again soon after sunset.  I had appointed to return accordingly.    Next evening was a lovely evening, and I walked out early to enjoy  it.  The sun was not yet quite down when I traversed the field-path  near the top of the deep cutting.  I would extend my walk for an  hour, I said to myself, half an hour on and half an hour back, and  it would then be time to go to my signal-man's box.    Before pursuing my stroll, I stepped to the brink, and mechanically  looked down, from the point from which I had first seen him.  I  cannot describe the thrill that seized upon me, when, close at the  mouth of the tunnel, I saw the appearance of a man, with his left  sleeve across his eyes, passionately waving his right arm.    The nameless horror that oppressed me passed in a moment, for in a  moment I saw that this appearance of a man was a man indeed, and  that there was a little group of other men, standing at a short  distance, to whom he seemed to be rehearsing the gesture he made.  The Danger-light was not yet lighted.  Against its shaft, a little  low hut, entirely new to me, had been made of some wooden supports  and tarpaulin.  It looked no bigger than a bed.    With an irresistible sense that something was wrong,--with a  flashing self-reproachful fear that fatal mischief had come of my  leaving the man there, and causing no one to be sent to overlook or  correct what he did,--I descended the notched path with all the  speed I could make.    \"What is the matter?\" I asked the men.    \"Signal-man killed this morning, sir.\"    \"Not the man belonging to that box?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Not the man I know?\"    \"You will recognise him, sir, if you knew him,\" said the man who  spoke for the others, solemnly uncovering his own head, and raising  an end of the tarpaulin, \"for his face is quite composed.\"    \"Oh, how did this happen, how did this happen?\" I asked, turning  from one to another as the hut closed in again.    \"He was cut down by an engine, sir.  No man in England knew his  work better.  But somehow he was not clear of the outer rail.  It  was just at broad day.  He had struck the light, and had the lamp  in his hand.  As the engine came out of the tunnel, his back was  towards her, and she cut him down.  That man drove her, and was  showing how it happened.  Show the gentleman, Tom.\"    The man, who wore a rough dark dress, stepped back to his former  place at the mouth of the tunnel.    \"Coming round the curve in the tunnel, sir,\" he said, \"I saw him at  the end, like as if I saw him down a perspective-glass.  There was  no time to check speed, and I knew him to be very careful.  As he  didn't seem to take heed of the whistle, I shut it off when we were  running down upon him, and called to him as loud as I could call.\"    \"What did you say?\"    \"I said, 'Below there!  Look out!  Look out!  For God's sake, clear  the way!'\"    I started.    \"Ah! it was a dreadful time, sir.  I never left off calling to him.  I put this arm before my eyes not to see, and I waved this arm to  the last; but it was no use.\"      Without prolonging the narrative to dwell on any one of its curious  circumstances more than on any other, I may, in closing it, point  out the coincidence that the warning of the Engine-Driver included,  not only the words which the unfortunate Signal-man had repeated to  me as haunting him, but also the words which I myself--not he--had  attached, and that only in my own mind, to the gesticulation he had  imitated.        Bulwer Lytton      The Haunted and the Haunters;  Or, The House and the Brain      A friend of mine, who is a man of letters and a philosopher, said  to me one day, as if between jest and earnest, \"Fancy! since we  last met I have discovered a haunted house in the midst of London.\"  "]]]
