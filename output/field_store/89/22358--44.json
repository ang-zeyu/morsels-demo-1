I am quite transported at the  thought that ere long, perhaps very soon, I shall bid an eternal adieu  to all the pains and uneasinesses, and disquietudes of this weary  life. As for the world, I despair of ever making a figure in it: I am  not formed for the bustle of the busy, nor the flutter of the gay. I  foresee that poverty and obscurity probably await me, and I am in some  measure prepared and daily preparing to meet them. I have but just  time and paper to return you my grateful thanks for the lessons of  virtue and piety you have given me, which were but too much neglected  at the time of giving them, but which, I hope, have been remembered  ere it is yet too late.\" This remarkable letter was written in the  twenty-second year of his age; it alludes to the illness which seems  to have been the companion of his youth, a nervous headache, brought  on by constant toil and anxiety; and it speaks of the melancholy which  is the common attendant of genius, and its sensibilities, aggravated  by despair of distinction. The catastrophe which happened ere this  letter was well in his father's hand, accords ill with quotations from  the Bible, and hopes fixed in heaven:--\"As we gave,\" he says, \"a  welcome carousal to the new year, the shop took fire, and burnt to  ashes, and I was left, like a true poet, not worth a sixpence.\"    This disaster was followed by one more grievous: his father was well  in years when he was married, and age and a constitution injured by  toil and disappointment, began to press him down, ere his sons had  grown up to man's estate. On all sides the clouds began to darken: the  farm was unprosperous: the speculations in flax failed; and the  landlord of Lochlea, raising a question upon the meaning of the lease,  concerning rotation of crop, pushed the matter to a lawsuit, alike  ruinous to a poor man either in its success or its failure. \"After  three years tossing and whirling,\" says Burns, \"in the vortex of  litigation, my father was just saved from the horrors of a jail by a  consumption, which, after two years' promises, kindly slept in and  carried him away to where the 'wicked cease from troubling and the  weary are at rest.' His all went among the hell-hounds that prowl in  the kennel of justice. The finishing evil which brought up the rear of  this infernal file, was my constitutional melancholy being increased  to such a degree, that for three months I was in a state of mind  scarcely to be envied by the hopeless wretches who have got their  mittimus, 'Depart from me, ye cursed.'\"    Robert Burns was now the head of his father's house. He gathered  together the little that law and misfortune had spared, and took the  farm of Mossgiel, near Mauchline, containing one hundred and eighteen  acres, at a rent of ninety pounds a year: his mother and sisters took  the domestic superintendence of home, barn, and byre; and he  associated his brother Gilbert in the labours of the land. It was made  a joint affair: the poet was young, willing, and vigorous, and  excelled in ploughing, sowing, reaping, mowing, and thrashing. His  wages were fixed at seven pounds per annum, and such for a time was  his care and frugality, that he never exceeded this small allowance.  He purchased books on farming, held conversations with the old and the  knowing; and said unto himself, \"I shall be prudent and wise, and my  shadow shall increase in the land.\" But it was not decreed that these  resolutions were to endure, and that he was to become a mighty  agriculturist in the west. Farmer Attention, as the proverb says, is a  good farmer, all the world over, and Burns was such by fits and by  starts. But he who writes an ode on the sheep he is about to shear, a  poem on the flower that he covers with the furrow, who sees visions on  his way to market, who makes rhymes on the horse he is about to yoke,  and a song on the girl who shows the whitest hands among his reapers,  has small chance of leading a market, or of being laird of the fields  he rents. The dreams of Burns were of the muses, and not of rising  markets, of golden locks rather than of yellow corn: he had other  faults. It is not known that William Burns was aware before his death  that his eldest son had sinned in rhyme; but we have Gilbert's  assurance, that his father went to the grave in ignorance of his son's  errors of a less venial kind--unwitting that he was soon to give a  two-fold proof of both in \"Rob the Rhymer's Address to his Bastard  Child\"--a poem less decorous than witty.    The dress and condition of Burns when he became a poet were not at all  poetical, in the minstrel meaning of the word. His clothes, coarse and  homely, were made from home-grown wool, shorn off his own sheeps'  backs, carded and spun at his own fireside, woven by the village  weaver, and, when not of natural hodden-gray, dyed a half-blue in the  village vat. They were shaped and sewed by the district tailor, who  usually wrought at the rate of a groat a day and his food; and as the  wool was coarse, so also was the workmanship. The linen which he wore  was home-grown, home-hackled, home-spun, home-woven, and  home-bleached, and, unless designed for Sunday use, was of coarse,  strong harn, to suit the tear and wear of barn and field. His shoes  came from rustic tanpits, for most farmers then prepared their own  leather; were armed, sole and heel, with heavy, broad-headed nails, to  endure the clod and the road: as hats were then little in use, save  among small lairds or country gentry, westland heads were commonly  covered with a coarse, broad, blue bonnet, with a stopple on its flat  crown, made in thousands at Kilmarnock, and known in all lands by the  name of scone bonnets. His plaid was a handsome red and white  check--for pride in poets, he said, was no sin--prepared of fine wool  with more than common care by the hands of his mother and sisters, and  woven with more skill than the village weaver was usually required to  exert. His dwelling was in keeping with his dress, a low, thatched  house, with a kitchen, a bedroom and closet, with floors of kneaded  clay, and ceilings of moorland turf: a few books on a shelf, thumbed  by many a thumb; a few hams drying above head in the smoke, which was  in no haste to get out at the roof--a wooden settle, some oak chairs,  chaff beds well covered with blankets, with a fire of peat and wood  burning at a distance from the gable wall, on the middle of the floor.  His food was as homely as his habitation, and consisted chiefly of  oatmeal-porridge, barley-broth, and potatoes, and milk. How the muse  happened to visit him in this clay biggin, take a fancy to a clouterly  peasant, and teach him strains of consummate beauty and elegance, must  ever be a matter of wonder to all those, and they are not few, who  hold that noble sentiments and heroic deeds are the exclusive portion  of the gently nursed and the far descended.    Of the earlier verses of Burns few are preserved: when composed, he  put them on paper, but the kept them to himself: though a poet at  sixteen, he seems not to have made even his brother his confidante  till he became a man, and his judgment had ripened. He, however, made  a little clasped paper book his treasurer, and under the head of  \"Observations, Hints, Songs, and Scraps of Poetry,\" we find many a  wayward and impassioned verse, songs rising little above the humblest  country strain, or bursting into an elegance and a beauty worthy of  the highest of minstrels. The first words noted down are the stanzas  which he composed on his fair companion of the harvest-field, out of  whose hands he loved to remove the nettle-stings and the thistles: the  prettier song, beginning \"Now westlin win's and slaughtering guns,\"  written on the lass of Kirkoswald, with whom, instead of learning  mensuration, he chose to wander under the light of the moon: a strain  better still, inspired by the charms of a neighbouring maiden, of the  name of Annie Ronald; another, of equal merit, arising out of his  nocturnal adventures among the lasses of the west; and, finally, that  crowning glory of all his lyric compositions, \"Green grow the rashes.\"  This little clasped book, however, seems not to have been made his  confidante till his twenty-third or twenty-fourth year: he probably  admitted to its pages only the strains which he loved most, or such as  had taken a place in his memory: at whatever age it was commenced, he  had then begun to estimate his own character, and intimate his  fortunes, for he calls himself in its pages \"a man who had little art  in making money, and still less in keeping it.\"    We have not been told how welcome the incense of his songs rendered  him to the rustic maidens of Kyle: women are not apt to be won by the  charms of verse; they have little sympathy with dreamers on Parnassus,  and allow themselves to be influenced by something more substantial  than the roses and lilies of the muse. Burns had other claims to their  regard then those arising from poetic skill: he was tall, young,  good-looking, with dark, bright eyes, and words and wit at will: he  had a sarcastic sally for all lads who presumed to cross his path, and  a soft, persuasive word for all lasses on whom he fixed his fancy: nor  was this all--he was adventurous and bold in love trystes and love  excursions: long, rough roads, stormy nights, flooded rivers, and  lonesome places, were no letts to him; and when the dangers or labours  of the way were braved, he was alike skilful in eluding vigilant  aunts, wakerife mothers, and envious or suspicions sisters: for rivals  he had a blow as ready us he had a word, and was familiar with snug  stack-yards, broomy glens, and nooks of hawthorn and honeysuckle, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18505"],[0,"A Popular Schoolgirl (#7)"],[1,"her settle herself. She looked her over with the  critical air that is generally bestowed on new girls, and decided that  she was particularly pretty. Bess was the image of one of the Sir Joshua  Reynolds' child angels in the National Gallery. The likeness was so  great that her mother had always cut and curled her golden-brown hair in  exact copy of the picture. She was a slim, rosy, bright-eyed, smiling  specimen of girlhood, and, though on this first morning she was  manifestly afflicted with shyness, she had the appearance of one whose  acquaintance might be worth making. Ingred decided to cultivate it at  the earliest opportunity, and spoke to the new arrival at lunch-time.  Bess replied readily to the usual questions.    \"We've only come lately to Grovebury. We used to live at Birkshaw. Yes,  I'm fairly keen on hockey, though I like tennis better. Have you asphalt  courts here, and do you play in the winter? I adore dancing, but I hate  gym. I'm learning the violin, and I'm to start oil-painting this term.\"    She seemed such a pleasant, winsome kind of girl that Ingred, who was  apt to take sudden fancies, constituted herself her cicerone, and showed  her round the school. By the time they had made the entire tour of the  buildings, Ingred began to wonder whether, without offense, it would be  possible to leave her desk, next to Verity, and sit beside Bess. There  was a great charm of voice and manner about the new-comer, and Ingred's  musical ear was sensitive to gentle voices. She discussed Bess with the  others next morning before school.    \"Yes, she's pretty, and that blue dress is simply adorable,\" conceded  Nora. \"I'm going to have an embroidered one myself next time.\"    \"Her hair is so sweet,\" commented Francie.    \"I call her ripping!\" said Ingred with enthusiasm.    \"Well, you ought to take an interest in her, Ingred, considering that  she lives at Rotherwood,\" put in Beatrice.    \"At Rotherwood!\"    \"Yes, didn't you know _that_?\"    Ingred, under pretence of distributing exercise-books, turned hastily  away. Her heart was in a sudden turmoil. This was indeed a bolt from the  blue. She, of course, knew that Rotherwood was let, but she had not  heard the name of the tenants, and, as the subject was a sore one, had  forborne to ask any questions at home. It was surely the irony of fate  that the house should be taken by people who had a daughter of her own  age, and that this daughter should come to the College, and actually be  placed in the same form as herself. She seemed a rival ready-made.  Biased by jealous prejudice, Ingred's hastily-formed judgment reversed  itself.    \"I'm thankful I didn't move away from Verity to sit next to her,\" she  thought. \"I expect she'll be ever so conceited and give herself airs,  and the other girls will truckle to her no end. I know them! I wish to  goodness she hadn't come to the College. Why didn't they send her away  to a boarding school? I'm not going to make a fuss over her, so she  needn't think it.\"    Poor Bess, quite unaware of being any cause of offence, and grateful for  the kindness shown her the day before, greeted Ingred in most friendly  fashion, and looked amazement itself at the cool reception of her  advances. She stared for a moment as if hardly believing the evidence of  her eyes and ears, then turned away with a hurt look on her pretty,  sensitive face.    Ingred shut her desk with a slam. She was feeling very uncomfortable.  She had liked Bess with a kind of love-at-first-sight, and if the latter  had come to live at any other house in the town than Rotherwood, would  have been prepared to go on liking her. Generosity whispered that her  conduct was unjust, but at this particular stage of Ingred's evolution  she did not always listen to those inner voices that act as our highest  guides. Like most of us, she had a mixed character, capable of many good  things but with certain failings. Rotherwood was what the girls called  \"the bee in her bonnet,\" and the knowledge that Bess was in possession  of the beautiful home she had lost was sufficient to check the incipient  friendship.    It was otherwise with the rest of the form. They frankly welcomed the  new-comer, and if they did not, as Ingred had bitterly prognosticated,  exactly \"truckle\" to her, they certainly began to treat her as a  favorite. She was asked at once to join the Photographic Society and the  Drawing Club, and her very superior camera, beautiful color-box, and  other up-to-date equipments were immensely admired. Ingred, on the  outside of the enthusiastic circle, preserved a stony silence. Her own  camera was three years old, and she did not possess materials for  oil-painting. She thought it quite unnecessary for Verity to want to  look at Bess's paraphernalia. Verity, who was a kind-hearted little  soul, perhaps divined the cause of her chum's glumness, for she came  presently and took Ingred's arm.    \"I've something to tell you, Ingred,\" she whispered. \"We are to have the  election on Friday afternoon, and everybody's saying you'll be chosen  warden for the form.\"    \"Don't suppose I've the remotest chance!\" grunted Ingred gloomily.    \"Nonsense! Don't be a blue-bottle! Cheery-ho! In my opinion you'll just  have an easy walk over.\"    With the removal into the new building, Miss Burd had instituted many  innovations and changes. Among the most important of these was the  College Council, which really served as a sort of House of Parliament  for the school. Each form among the seniors and intermediates was to  elect a representative called a warden, and these, with such permanent  officers as the prefects and the games captain, were to meet once a  fortnight to discuss questions of self-government. It was a new  experiment, and the head mistress hoped it would give the girls some  idea of responsibility, and train them to understand civic duties later  on. The girls themselves voted it a \"ripping\" idea. They took it up most  enthusiastically. It would be fun to have elections, and it seemed  desirable that there should be a warden to look after the interests of  each separate form.    \"When I was in the Fourth we never got a chance for the tennis courts,  and it was utterly hopeless to appeal to the prefects,\" said Ingred. \"I  always used to feel there ought to be some way of making one's voice  heard.\"    \"Well, if you're elected, you'll have a chance to make your maiden  speech!\" laughed Verity. \"By the bye, will there be a 'Strangers'  Gallery, so that we can come and listen to you? I'd be sorry to miss the  fun!\"    Friday afternoon had been fixed for the election, and a bright idea  originated in VA., circulated through the school, and finally  crystallized in the Sixth. It was nothing less than that each form  should make a special fete of the affair. Lispeth Scott, the head girl,  went boldly to Miss Burd, and asked permission for those who liked to  bring thermos flasks, cups, and bags of buns and cakes, and hold parties  in the various class-rooms.    \"It would make so much more of the whole thing,\" she urged. \"If we  simply stop for ten minutes after school and vote, I'm afraid it may  fall rather flat. But if every form has its festival to elect its own  warden, it will make the council seem a much more important business.  We'd like to be allowed to stay till about half-past five, if we may, so  that there would be time to have some fun over it. We'd promise not to  make a mess with our picnicking.\"    Miss Burd, looking rather astonished, nevertheless consented. She was a  wise woman, and believed in permitting a certain amount of liberty,  within limits.    \"You may try it this once,\" she conceded. \"But it's on the distinct  understanding that you're all on your good behavior. I shall hold you  prefects responsible for controlling the school. If you hear a great  noise, you must go into their form-rooms and stop them. I can't allow  the College to be turned into a bear-garden.\"    \"We won't! I'll put them all on their honor to behave, and I'll leave  the door of our form-room open so that I can hear what's going on. Thank  you so much, Miss Burd!\"    And Lispeth departed, fearful lest any other qualifications should be  added to temper the joy of the proceedings.    Six girls, waiting outside the door to hear the result of the  negotiations, waved signals of success to others farther down the  corridor, and, in an almost incredibly short space of time, the happy  news had spread to the remotest corners of the school.    \"But how are we hostelites going to manage our share?\" asked Ingred  anxiously.    \"Don't you worry about that,\" Jess and Francie assured her. \"Ten girls  in our form have promised to bring thermos flasks, and if we pool to tea  there'll be heaps to go round, and the same with buns and cakes. We'll  each bring a little extra to make enough. The hostel will very likely  lend you each a cup if you ask for it. That's all you'll need!\"    \"Right-o! We'll cast ourselves on the charity of the form!\" agreed  Ingred.          CHAPTER V    The Fifth-form Fete      By a general indulgence issued from head-quarters, the dismissal bell  rang at 3:45 the next Friday afternoon, instead of, as usual, at four  o'clock. The mistresses entered up the marks, put away their books, said  \"Good afternoon, girls!\" and made their exit, leaving the building for  once in the sole possession of the pupils. Miss Strong, indeed, who  disapproved of the whole business, took the precaution of locking her  desk before her departure, a proceeding which provoked indignant sniffs  from the witnesses; but, sublimely indifferent to public opinion, she  put the key in her pocket, and stalked from the room. The girls gave her  a few moments' grace to get out of earshot, then broke into a babble of  conversation.    \"Which are we having first, the election or the tea?\"    \"Oh, the tea!\"    \"No, no! Business first and pleasure afterwards.\"    \"I can't vote till I've had"]]]
