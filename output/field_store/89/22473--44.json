[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20390"],[0,"Elements of Structural and Systematic Botany (#7)"],[1,", _D_, x 300;  the others x 150.]      The sexual reproduction takes place as follows: Certain cells of a    filament become distinguished by their denser contents and by an    increase in size, becoming oval or nearly globular in form (Fig. 16,    _A_, _B_). When fully grown, the contents contract and form a naked    cell, which sometimes shows a clear area at one point on the    surface. This globular mass of protoplasm is the egg cell, or female    cell, and the cell containing it is called the \"ooegonium.\" When the    egg cell is ripe, the ooegonium opens by means of a little pore at    one side (Fig. 16, _A_).      In other cells, either of the same filament or else of the small    male plants already mentioned, small motile cells, called    spermatozoids, are formed. These are much smaller than the egg cell,    and resemble the zooespores in form, but are much smaller, and    without chlorophyll. When ripe they are discharged from the cells in    which they were formed, and enter the ooegonium. By careful    observation the student may possibly be able to follow the    spermatozoid into the ooegonium, where it enters the egg cell at the    clear spot on its surface. As a result of the entrance of the    spermatozoid (fertilization), the egg cell becomes surrounded by a    thick brown wall, and becomes a resting spore. The spore loses its    green color, and the wall becomes dark colored and differentiated    into several layers, the outer one often provided with spines    (Fig. 16, _F_). As these spores do not germinate for a long time,    the process is only known in a comparatively small number of    species, and can hardly be followed by the ordinary student.    [Illustration: FIG. 17.--_A_, plant of _Coleochaete_, x 50. _B_, a few  cells from the margin, with one of the hairs.]    Much like _OEdogonium_, but differing in being branched, is the genus  _Bulbochaete_, characterized also by hairs swollen at the base, and  prolonged into a delicate filament (Fig. 16, _G_).    The highest members of the _Confervaceae_ are those of the genus  _Coleochaete_ (Fig. 17), of which there are several species found in  the United States. These show some striking resemblances to the red  seaweeds, and possibly form a transition from the green algae to the  red. The commonest species form bright-green discs, adhering firmly  to the stems and floating leaves of water lilies and other aquatics.  In aquaria they sometimes attach themselves in large numbers to the  glass sides of the vessel.      Growing from the upper surface are numerous hairs, consisting of a    short, sheath-like base, including a very long and delicate filament    (Fig. 17, _B_). In their methods of reproduction they resemble    _OEdogonium_, but the reproductive organs are more specialized.          CHAPTER V.    GREEN ALGAE--_Continued_.      ORDER III.--POND SCUMS (_Conjugatae_).    The _Conjugatae_, while in some respects approaching the _Confervaceae_  in structure, yet differ from them to such an extent in some respects  that their close relationship is doubtful. They are very common and  familiar plants, some of them forming great floating masses upon the  surface of every stagnant pond and ditch, being commonly known as  \"pond scum.\" The commonest of these pond scums belong to the genus  _Spirogyra_, and one of these will illustrate the characteristics of  the order. When in active growth these masses are of a vivid green,  and owing to the presence of a gelatinous coating feel slimy, slipping  through the hands when one attempts to lift them from the water.  Spread out in water, the masses are seen to be composed of slender  threads, often many centimetres in length, and showing no sign of  branching.    [Illustration: FIG. 18.--_A_, a filament of a common pond scum  (_Spirogyra_) separating into two parts. _B_, a cell undergoing  division. The cell is seen in optical section, and the chlorophyll  bands are omitted, _n_, _n'_, the two nuclei. _C_, a complete cell.  _n_, nucleus. _py._ pyrenoid. _D_, _E_, successive stages in the  process of conjugation. _G_, a ripe spore. _H_, a form in which  conjugation takes place between the cells of the same filament. All  x 150.]      For microscopical examination the larger species are preferable.    When one of these is magnified (Fig. 18, _A_, _C_), the unbranched    filament is shown to be made up of perfectly cylindrical cells, with    rather delicate walls. The protoplasm is confined to a thin layer    lining the walls, except for numerous fine filaments that radiate    from the centrally placed nucleus (_n_), which thus appears    suspended in the middle of the cell. The nucleus is large and    distinct in the larger species, and has a noticeably large and    conspicuous nucleolus. The most noticeable thing about the cell is    the green spiral bands running around it. These are the    chloroplasts, which in all the _Conjugatae_ are of very peculiar    forms. The number of these bands varies much in different species of    _Spirogyra_, but is commonly two or three. These chloroplasts, like    those of other plants, are not noticeably different in structure    from the ordinary protoplasm, as is shown by extracting the    chlorophyll, which may be done by placing the plants in alcohol for    a short time. This extracts the chlorophyll, but a microscopic    examination of the decolored cells shows that the bands remain    unchanged, except for the absence of color. These bands are    flattened, with irregularly scalloped margins, and at intervals have    rounded bodies (pyrenoids) imbedded in them (Fig. 18, _C_, _py._).    The pyrenoids, especially when the plant has been exposed to the    light for some time, are surrounded by a circle of small granules,    which become bluish when iodine is applied, showing them to be    starch. (To show the effect of iodine on starch on a large scale,    mix a little flour, which is nearly all starch, with water, and add    a little iodine. The starch will immediately become colored blue,    varying in intensity with the amount of iodine.) The cells divide    much as in _Cladophora_, but the nucleus here takes part in the    process. The division naturally occurs only at night, but by    reducing the temperature at night to near the freezing point (4 deg. C.,    or a little lower), the process may be checked. The experiment is    most conveniently made when the temperature out of doors approaches    the freezing point. Then it is only necessary to keep the plants in    a warm room until about 10 P.M., when they may be put out of doors    for the night. On bringing them in in the morning, the division will    begin almost at once, and may be easily studied. The nucleus divides    into two parts, which remain for a time connected by delicate    threads (Fig. 18, _B_), that finally disappear. At first no nucleoli    are present in the daughter nuclei, but they appear before the    division is complete.      New filaments are formed by the breaking up of the old ones, this    sometimes being very rapid. As the cells break apart, the free ends    bulge strongly, showing the pressure exerted upon the cell wall by    the contents (Fig. 18, _A_).    Spores like those of _OEdogonium_ are formed, but the process is  somewhat different. It occurs in most species late in the spring, but  may sometimes be met with at other times. The masses of fruiting  plants usually appear brownish colored. If spores have been formed  they can, in the larger species at least, be seen with a hand lens,  appearing as rows of dark-colored specks.      Two filaments lying side by side send out protuberances of the cell    wall that grow toward each other until they touch (Fig. 18, _D_). At    the point of contact, the wall is absorbed, forming a continuous    channel from one cell to the other. This process usually takes place    in all the cells of the two filaments, so that the two filaments,    connected by tubes at regular intervals, have the form of a ladder.      In some species adjoining cells of the same filament become    connected, the tubes being formed at the end of the cells (Fig. 18,    _H_), and the cell in which the spore is formed enlarges.      Soon after the channel is completed, the contents of one cell flow    slowly through it into the neighboring cell, and the protoplasm of    the two fuses into one mass. (The union of the nuclei has also been    observed.) The young spore thus formed contracts somewhat, becoming    oval in form, and soon secretes a thick wall, colorless at first,    but afterwards becoming brown and more or less opaque. The    chlorophyll bands, although much crowded, are at first    distinguishable, but later lose the chlorophyll, and become    unrecognizable. Like the resting spores of _OEdogonium_ these require    a long period of rest before germinating.    [Illustration: FIG. 19.--Forms of _Zygnemaceae_. _A_, _Zygnema_. _B_,  _C_, _D_, _Mesocarpus_. All x 150.]    There are various genera of the pond scums, differing in the form of  the chloroplasts and also in the position of the spores. Of these may  be mentioned _Zygnema_ (Fig. 19, _A_), with two star-shaped  chloroplasts in each cell, and _Mesocarpus_ (Fig. 19, _B_, _D_), in  which the single chloroplast has the form of a thin median plate. (B  shows the appearance from in front, _C_ from the side, showing the  thickness of the plate.) _Mesocarpus_ and the allied genera have the  spore formed between the filaments, the contents of both the uniting  cells leaving them.    [Illustration: FIG. 20.--Forms of Desmids. _A_, _B_, _Closterium_.  _C_, _D_, _D'_, _Cosmarium_. _D_, and _D'_ show the process of  division. _E_, _F_, _Staurastrum_; _E_ seen from the side, _F_ from  the end.]    Evidently related to the pond scums, but differing in being for the  most part strictly unicellular, are the desmids (Fig. 20).

The transaction is  reported to Constantinople: here, notwithstanding the French and  English notes, &c., a Council is held, and the order to execute him  is sent off, and in fact this unfortunate person was publicly hanged  at Biligik fourteen or fifteen days ago. The effect which this event  produced on the Turkish inhabitants of the place has been such that  the Governor has been under the necessity of taking the greatest  precautions to prevent the massacre of all the inhabitants.    Inclosure 3 in No. 13.    _Sir Stratford Canning to M. Pisani_.    Sir,                              _Buyukderé, December_ 16, 1843.    It is with sentiments of deep concern that I have received  unquestionable intelligence of another religious execution, similar  in principle to that of the Armenian Avakim. In stating this  circumstance without delay to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, you  will lay before his Excellency the substance of the two accompanying  papers, which contain a relation of the principal facts. You will  express the surprise and disappointment which I feel in the  contemplation of so revolting an act, after the very distinct  communications which had recently taken place between his Excellency  and myself respecting the previous case. A full knowledge of the  sentiments entertained by Her Majesty's Government, and also by four  other leading Cabinets of Europe, has not to all appearance  prevented the Porte from again publicly outraging the principles of  humanity, and again exposing herself to the just animadversion of  those friendly Powers.    Under these circumstances, and referring to the instructions of my  Government already communicated to Rifaat Pasha, I deem it an  indispensable duty to invite the explanations of the Porte, and to  state my expectation that the Turkish Government will not only  declare its regret for the two executions in suitable terms, but  that it will accompany the declaration with an assurance, admitting  of no question for the future, that effective measures will be  immediately taken to preclude the recurrence of such unwise and  odious acts.    You will conclude by leaving with Rifaat Pasha a copy of this  instruction, and by calling upon his Excellency to lay it before the  Sultan, and to apprize you on an early day of the answer sanctioned  by His Majesty, for the information of my Government.    I am, &c.,    (Signed) STRATFORD CANNING.              No. 14.      _M. Guizot to Count Ste. Aulaire_.--(_Communicated by Count Ste.  Aulaire to the Earl of Aberdeen, January_ 13.)    (Extract.)                        _Paris, le_ 9 _Janvier_, 1844.    Malgré les promesses formelles de la Porte, et les mesures qu'elle  disait avoir prises pour empêcher le renouvellement du douloureux  scandale auquel avait donné lieu, il y a quelques mois, l'exécution  d'un Arménien supplicié pour être revenu à la religion Chrétienne  après avoir embrassé l'Islamisme, un Grec des environs de Brousse  vient encore d'être mis à mort dans des circonstances absolument  semblables. Interpellé à ce sujet par M. de Bourqueney, la Porte n'a  su alléguer pour se justifier que des malentendus et des méprises  dont les allégations même sont contradictoires. Un tel fait n'est  plus seulement un outrage à l'humanité, c'est une insulte jetée à  l'Europe civilisée par le fanatisme d'un parti que le Gouvernement  Ottoman n'a pas le courage de contenir et de réprimer, à supposer  qu'il n'en soit pas lui-même le complice dans une certaine mesure.  Ce courage, il faut le lui donner en lui faisant craindre d'encourir  le sérieux mécontentement des Puissances dont l'appui bienveillant  lui est si nécessaire.    Je vais charger M. de Bourqueney de faire à cet effet une démarche  énergique auprès de la Porte, et je ne doute pas que Lord Aberdeen  ne donne à Sir Stratford Canning des instructions analogues. Le  Gouvernement Britannique croira certainement aussi devoir se joindre  à nous pour demander le concours des autres Grandes Puissances.    (Translation.)                                      _Paris, January_ 9, 1844.    Notwithstanding the formal promises of the Porte, and the measures  which it had declared that it had taken to prevent the repetition of  the mournful scandal to which a few months ago the execution of an  Armenian who was punished for having returned to Christianity after  having embraced Islamism, gave rise, a Greek of the neighbourhood of  Brussa, has now been put to death, under circumstances precisely  similar. On being questioned on this subject by M. de Bourqueney,  the Porte could only allege in its justification misunderstandings  and mistakes the very allegations with regard to which are  contradictory. Such a transaction is no longer only an outrage to  humanity, it is an insult cast upon civilized Europe, by the  fanaticism of a party which the Ottoman Government has not the  courage to keep within bounds and repress, supposing that it is not  itself to a certain degree an accomplice in the measure. This  courage must be given to it by causing it to apprehend that it will  incur the serious displeasure of the Powers whose benevolent support  is so necessary to it.    I am about to instruct M. de Bourqueney to take an energetic step  for this purpose towards the Porte, and I doubt not that Lord  Aberdeen will furnish Sir Stratford Canning with corresponding  instructions. The British Government will likewise assuredly think  fit to unite with us in demanding the concurrence of the other Great  Powers.              No. 15.      _The Earl of Aberdeen to Sir Stratford Canning_.    Sir,                         _Foreign Office, January_ 16, 1844.    I have received your Excellency's despatch of the 17th of December,  reporting that a Greek had been executed near Brussa as an apostate  from Islamism, and inclosing a copy of the communication which you  had directed Mr. Dragoman Frederick Pisani to make to the Porte in  consequence of that transaction.    I have to state to your Excellency that Her Majesty's Government  entirely approve the promptitude with which you acted on this  occasion. But the repetition of a scene of this revolting kind so  soon after that which had, in the course of last summer, excited the  horror and indignation of Europe, evinces such total disregard, on  the part of the Porte, for the feelings and remonstrances of the  Christian Powers, that it is incumbent upon Her Majesty's Government  without loss of time to convey their sentiments on the matter still  more explicitly to the knowledge of the Porte. They take this course  singly, and without waiting for the co-operation of the other  Christian Powers, because they desire to announce to the Porte a  determination which, though it doubtless will be concurred in by  all, Great Britain is prepared to act upon alone. Her Majesty's  Government feel too that they have an especial right to require to  be listened to by the Porte on a matter of this nature, for they can  appeal to the justice and to the favour with which the vast body of  Mahomedans subject to the British rule are treated in India, in  support of their demand that all persons, subjects of the Porte and  professing Christianity, shall be exempt from cruel and arbitrary  persecution on account of their religion, and shall not be made the  victims of a barbarous law, which it may be sought to enforce for  their destruction.    Whatever may have been tolerated in former times by the weakness or  indifference of Christian Powers, those Powers will now require from  the Porte due consideration for their feelings as members of a  religious community, and interested as such in the fate of all who,  notwithstanding shades of difference, unite in a common belief in  the essential doctrines of Christianity; and they will not endure  that the Porte should insult and trample on their faith by treating  as a criminal any person who embraces it.    Her Majesty's Government require the Porte to abandon, once for all,  so revolting a principle. They have no wish to humble the Porte by  imposing upon it an unreasonable obligation; but as a Christian  Government, the protection of those who profess a common belief with  themselves, from persecution and oppression, on that account alone,  by their Mahomedan rulers, is a paramount duty with them, and one  from which they cannot recede.    Your Excellency will therefore press upon the Turkish Government  that, if the Porte has any regard for the friendship of England,--if  it has any hope that, in the hour of peril or of adversity, that  protection which has more than once saved it from destruction, will  be extended to it again, it must renounce absolutely, and without  equivocation, the barbarous practice which has called forth the  remonstrance now addressed to it. Your Excellency will require an  early answer; and you will let the Turkish Ministers understand that  if that answer does not fully correspond with the expectations which  Her Majesty's Government entertain, your Excellency is instructed to  seek an audience of the Sultan, and to explain to His Highness, in  the most forcible terms, the feelings of the British Government, and  the consequences, so injurious to Turkey, which a disregard for  those feelings will involve. Her Majesty's Government are so anxious  for the continuance of a good understanding with Turkey, and that  the Porte should entitle itself to their good offices in the hour of  need, that they wish to leave no expedient untried before they shall  be compelled to admit the conviction that all their interest and  friendship is misplaced, and that nothing remains for them but to  look forward to, if not promote the arrival of, the day when the  force of circumstances shall bring about a change which they will  have vainly hoped to procure from the prudence and humanity of the  Porte"]]]
