The Master Cat, who went always before, said the same thing  to all he met, and the King was astonished at the vast estates of my  Lord Marquis of Carabas.    Monsieur Puss came at last to a stately castle, the master of which was  an Ogre, the richest ever known; for all the lands which the King had  then passed through belonged to this castle. The Cat, who had taken care  to inform himself who this Ogre was and what he could do, asked to speak  with him, saying he could not pass so near his castle without having the  honor of paying his respects to him.    The Ogre received him as civilly as an Ogre could do, and made him sit  down.    \"I have been assured,\" said the Cat, \"that you have the gift of being  able to change yourself into all sorts of creatures you have a mind to;  that you can, for example, transform yourself into a lion, or elephant,  and the like.\"    \"That is true,\" answered the Ogre, roughly; \"and to convince you, you  shall see me now become a lion.\"    Puss was so terrified at the sight of a lion so near him that he  immediately climbed into the gutter, not without much trouble and  danger, because of his boots, which were of no use at all to him for  walking upon the tiles. A little while after, when Puss saw that the  Ogre had resumed his natural form, he came down, and owned he had been  very much frightened.    \"I have, moreover, been informed,\" said the Cat, \"but I know not how to  believe it, that; you have also the power to take on you the shape of  the smallest animals; for example, to change yourself into a rat or a  mouse, but I must own to you I take this to be impossible.\"    \"Impossible!\" cried the Ogre; \"you shall see.\" And at the same time he  changed himself into a mouse, and began to run about the floor. Puss no  sooner perceived this than he fell upon him and ate him up.    Meanwhile, the King, who saw, as he passed, this fine castle of the  Ogre's, had a mind to go into it. Puss, who heard the noise of his  Majesty's coach coming over the drawbridge, ran out, and said to the  King, \"Your Majesty is welcome to this castle of my Lord Marquis of  Carabas.\"    \"What! my Lord Marquis,\" cried the King, \"and does this castle also  belong to you? There can be nothing finer than this courtyard and all  the stately buildings which surround it; let us see the interior, if you  please.\"    The Marquis gave his hand to the young Princess, and followed the King,  who went first. They passed into the great hall, where they found a  magnificent collation, which the Ogre had prepared for his friends, who  were that very day to visit him, but dared not to enter, knowing the  King was there. His Majesty, charmed with the good qualities of my Lord  of Carabas, as was also his daughter, who had fallen violently in love  with him, and seeing the vast estate he possessed, said to him:--    \"It will be owing to yourself only, my Lord Marquis, if you are not my  son-in-law.\"    The Marquis, with low bows, accepted the honor which his Majesty  conferred upon him, and forthwith that very same day married the  Princess.    Puss became a great lord, and never ran after mice any more except for  his diversion.          RIQUET WITH THE TUFT.      Once upon a time there was a Queen who had a son so ugly and so  misshapen that it was long disputed whether he had human form. A fairy  who was at his birth said, however, that he would be very amiable for  all that, since he would have uncommon good sense. She even added that  it would be in his power, by virtue of a gift she had just then given  him, to bestow as much sense as he pleased on the person he loved the  best. All this somewhat comforted the poor Queen. It is true that this  child no sooner began to talk than he said a thousand pretty things, and  in all his actions there was an intelligence that was quite charming. I  forgot to tell you that he was born with a little tuft of hair upon his  head, which made them call him Riquet[1] with the Tuft, for Riquet was  the family name.    [Footnote 1: R[=e]k[=a].]    Seven or eight years later the Queen of a neighboring kingdom had two  daughters who were twins. The first born of these was more beautiful  than the day; whereat the Queen was so very glad that those present were  afraid that her excess of joy would do her harm. The same fairy who was  present at the birth of little Riquet with the Tuft was here also, and,  to moderate the Queen's gladness, she declared that this little Princess  should have no sense at all, but should be as stupid as she was pretty.  This mortified the Queen extremely; but afterward she had a far greater  sorrow, for the second daughter proved to be very ugly.    \"Do not afflict yourself so much, madam,\" said the fairy. \"Your daughter  shall have her recompense; she shall have so great a portion of sense  that the want of beauty will hardly be perceived.\"    \"God grant it,\" replied the Queen; \"but is there no way to make the  eldest, who is so pretty, have any sense?\"    \"I can do nothing for her, madam, as to sense,\" answered the fairy, \"but  everything as to beauty; and as there is nothing I would not do for your  satisfaction, I give her for gift that she shall have power to make  handsome the person who shall best please her.\"    As these princesses grew up, their perfections grew with them. All the  public talk was of the beauty of the elder and the rare good sense of  the younger. It is true also that their defects increased considerably  with their age. The younger visibly grew uglier and uglier, and the  elder became every day more and more stupid: she either made no answer  at all to what was asked her, or said something very silly. She was with  all this so unhandy that she could not place four pieces of china upon  the mantelpiece without breaking one of them, nor drink a glass of water  without spilling half of it upon her clothes.    Although beauty is a very great advantage in young people, the younger  sister was always the more preferred in society. People would indeed go  first to the Beauty to look upon and admire her, but turn aside soon  after to the Wit to hear a thousand most entertaining and agreeable  things; and it was amazing to see, in less than a quarter of an hour's  time, the elder with not a soul near her, and the whole company crowding  about the younger. The elder, dull as she was, could not fail to notice  this; and without the slightest regret would have given all her beauty  to have half her sister's wit. The Queen, prudent as she was, could not  help reproaching her several times for her stupidity, which almost made  the poor Princess die of grief.    One day, as she had hidden herself in a wood to bewail her misfortune,  she saw coming to her a very disagreeable little man, but most  magnificently dressed. This was the young Prince Riquet with the Tuft,  who having fallen in love with her upon seeing her picture,--many of  which were distributed all the world over,--had left his father's  kingdom to have the pleasure of seeing and talking with her. Overjoyed  to find her thus alone, he addressed himself to her with all imaginable  politeness and respect. Having observed, after he had paid her the  ordinary compliments, that she was extremely melancholy, he said to  her:--    \"I cannot comprehend, madam, how a person so beautiful as you are can be  so sorrowful as you seem to be; for though I can boast of having seen a  great number of exquisitely charming ladies, I can say that I never  beheld any one whose beauty approaches yours.\"    \"You are pleased to say so,\" answered the Princess, and here she  stopped.    \"Beauty,\" replied Riquet with the Tuft, \"is such a great advantage, that  it ought to take place of all things besides; and since you possess this  treasure, I can see nothing that can possibly very much afflict you.\"    \"I had far rather,\" cried the Princess, \"be as ugly as you are, and have  sense, than have the beauty I possess, and be as stupid as I am.\"    \"There is nothing, madam,\" returned he, \"shows more that we have good  sense than to believe we have none; and it is the nature of that  excellent quality that the more people have of it, the more they believe  they want it.\"    \"I do not know that,\" said the Princess; \"but I know very well that I  am very senseless, and that vexes me mightily.\"    \"If that be all which troubles you, madam, I can very easily put an end  to your affliction.\"    \"And how will you do that?\" cried the Princess.    \"I have the power, madam,\" replied Riquet with the Tuft, \"to give to  that person whom I love best as much good sense as can be had; and as  you, madam, are that very person, it will be your fault only if you have  not as great a share of it as any one living, provided you will be  pleased to marry me.\"    The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17211"],[0,"A School History of the Great War (#7)"],[1,"science warfare had become so  terrible that, if the nations could not arrange by agreement for its  abolition, they should at least take steps to lessen its horrors. This  was the chief reason back of the invitation for a second Hague  Conference, which was issued by the Czar at the suggestion of President  Roosevelt. Forty-seven nations--nearly all the nations of the world---  were represented when the conference assembled on June 15, 1907.    Attempts were made to reopen the questions of disarmament and compulsory  arbitration, but without success. Germany again stood firmly against  both suggestions. The conference consequently confined its efforts  almost entirely to drawing up a code of international laws--especially  those regulating the actual conduct of war--known as \"the Hague  Conventions.\" They contain rules about the laying of submarine mines,  the treatment of prisoners, the bombardment of towns, and the rights of  neutrals in time of war; they forbid, for example, the use of poison or  of weapons causing unnecessary suffering. Even on these questions  Germany stood out against certain changes which would have made war  still more humane. But her delegates took part in framing the Hague  Conventions; and Germany, like all the other powers later engaged in the  Great War, accepted those conventions by formal treaty, thus binding  herself to observe them.    RESULTS OF THE HAGUE CONFERENCES.--Leaders of the movement for  universal peace felt that in spite of the small success of the Hague  Conferences a definite beginning had been made. Many of them were very  hopeful that later conferences would lead to larger results and that  even Germany would swing into line. There were plans to hold a third  conference in 1914 or 1915. As we look back upon the years between 1907  and 1914, it seems hard to understand the general blindness of the world  to the certainty of the coming struggle. Armaments were piled up at a  faster rate than ever. Naval armaments also entered into the race. From  the point of view of bringing about permanent peace in the world we must  view the conferences at The Hague as having hopelessly failed.    They did accomplish something, however. Arbitration was accepted by the  nations of the world, in principle at least. Moreover, the conferences  helped the cause of international law by showing how easily  international agreements could be reached if all the nations were  honestly in favor of peaceful decisions. Some day when the present war  has taught the world the much needed lessons that the recognition of  international law is necessary to civilization, and that the nations  must join together in its enforcement, the work begun at The Hague in  1899 and 1907 will be taken up once more with larger hope of success.        SUGGESTIONS FOR STUDY.--1. How are ordinary laws enforced?      How is international law carried out? Why the difference? 2.      Enumerate the instances in which questions of international      law have been brought up during the present war. 3. Look up      the history of the Red Cross movement. 4. Why did the Hague      Conferences fail to attain their great objects? 5. Summarize      what was actually accomplished by the Conferences. 6. Has the      history of the Hague Conferences any lessons which will be of      value after this war?

CHAPTER V    INTERNATIONAL JEALOUSIES AND ALLIANCES      The years between 1870 and 1914 were marked by growing jealousies among  the great powers of Europe. All were growing in wealth and commerce, and  each looked with envious eyes upon the successes of its neighbors. In  this chapter we are going to consider some of the special reasons for  the growth of international jealousies during this period, and the  grouping of the great nations into alliances.    ALSACE-LORRAINE.--At the close of the Franco-Prussian War in 1871,  France was humiliated by being forced to give up to Germany a large  section of her eastern lands--Alsace and northeastern Lorraine. It was  true that these provinces had long ago belonged to Germany. All of this  territory, however, had been French for generations, and much of it for  over two hundred years; and in both provinces the population was loyal  to the French government and violently opposed to being transferred to  the rule of Germany. But defeated France had no choice in the matter,  and the provinces became part of the German Empire. France has never  forgotten or forgiven this humiliation. Lloyd George, the British prime  minister, in speaking of the Alsace-Lorraine problem (January, 1918)  said, \"This sore has poisoned the peace of Europe for half a century,  and until it is cured healthy conditions cannot be restored.\"    [Illustration: ALSACE-LORRAINE]    German rule in Alsace-Lorraine has been unwise as well as severe. The  teaching of the French language in the elementary schools of the  provinces was forbidden. Military service in the German army was made  compulsory despite the protests of the inhabitants, who felt a horror of  some day being forced to fight against the French, whom they regarded as  brothers. All important offices were filled by Germans from beyond the  Rhine. The police constantly interfered with the freedom of the people.  French newspapers were suppressed on the slightest excuse. Attempts were  made to prevent Frenchmen from visiting Alsace and Alsatians from  visiting France. German army officers stationed in the provinces openly  ignored the rights of the population and were upheld in their conduct by  the German government. As time passed the inhabitants grew more and more  dissatisfied with the strict German rule.    In France also hostility to Germany was increased by the conditions in  Alsace-Lorraine. Frenchmen could not forget that they had been robbed of  these provinces. Hope was kept alive that some day they might be won  back. In the city of Paris, in the Place de la Concorde, there are eight  large marble statues each representing a great city of France. One of  these represents Strassburg, the chief city of Alsace. Every year, on  July 14, the national holiday of France, the people of Paris have placed  a wreath of mourning on this statue. This custom expresses the sorrow of  France for the loss of her eastern provinces, as well as her hope that  some day they may be restored.    ITALIA IRREDENTA.--_Italia Irreden'ta_ in the Italian language means  \"unredeemed Italy.\" It refers to the territory adjoining Italy on the  north and northeast, occupied by Italians but not yet redeemed from  foreign rule.    [Illustration: Map of Italia Irredenta]    When in 1871 the kingdom of Italy took its present form through the  union of former Italian states (Chapter I), Italia Irredenta remained  under the rule of Austria. Italians feel, however, that Italian unity  is not complete so long as adjoining lands inhabited by Italian-speaking  people are ruled by foreign governments. So they regard these lands as  \"unredeemed.\"    Italia Irredenta consists chiefly of the Trentino (tren-tee'no), a  triangle of territory dipping down into the north of Italy, and some  land around the northern end of the Adriatic including the important  city of Trieste. Both of these regions are ruled by Austria. For many  years this situation has led to ill feeling between the two countries.  While it has not had so direct a bearing on the outbreak of the World  War as the question of Alsace-Lorraine, it nevertheless largely explains  the entrance of Italy into the war on the side of the Allies.    RUSSIA AND THE BOSPORUS.--Still another situation which in the years  before the war was the cause of international jealousies was Russia's  long-standing ambition to control Constantinople on the Bos'porus. As  Constantinople is the capital of the Turkish Empire, the continued  existence of that state, at least on the continent of Europe, was  threatened by Russia's purpose. Russia has long been in need of an  ice-free port as an outlet for her commerce. Archangel (ark'[=a]n'jel) in  the north is ice-bound most of the year. Vladivostok', her port on the  Pacific, is ice-bound for three months of the year. Russian trade by way  of the Baltic must pass through waters controlled by other countries.  Naturally she has turned toward the Bosporus and Dardanelles  (dar-da-nelz')--the straits connecting the Black Sea with the  Mediterranean--as the natural outlet for her trade, and this explains  her desire to possess Constantinople.    For centuries Russia has been so much more powerful than Turkey that she  would surely have taken possession of Constantinople if the other  nations of Europe had not interfered. On two different occasions during  the nineteenth century England came to the assistance of the Turkish  Empire and saved Constantinople from the Czar. Great Britain was led to  take this action through fear that Russian control of Constantinople  might endanger the safety of her own communications with India. In the  years immediately preceding the outbreak of the Great War the danger  from Germany made other quarrels of much less importance, and England's  disagreement with Russia over her desire for a trade outlet was  forgotten.    EUROPEAN AMBITIONS IN THE BALKANS.--Russia has always felt a strong  interest in the small nations of the Balkan peninsula. Their inhabitants  are for the most part Slavs, of the same race as the Russians  themselves, and they have naturally looked upon the great Slavic empire  of the Czars as their protector. There was, moreover, a pan-Slavic party  in Russia, i.e. a group who looked forward to a union of all the Slav  nations under the leadership of Russia. The pan-Slavic movement had its  beginning in the help"]]]
