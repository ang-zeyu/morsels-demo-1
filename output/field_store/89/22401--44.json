(#7)"],[1,"progress of the Spanish arms  northward, while Brigadier Burgoyne was detached to fall upon Valencia  d'Alcantara, on the frontiers of Spain, southward. Burgoyne carried  Valencia d'Alcantara by a _coup-de-main_, capturing a Spanish general  with all his staff, and all the magazines which Spain had there  collected for the purpose of an invasion along the Tagus, and then  retraced his steps to Pnente de Marcello. At the same time Almeida was  taken by the Spanish general, Count d'Aranda, and having garrisoned this  place, and Ciudad Rodrigo, he marched towards the Tagus, designing to  pass into the Alemtejo. When, however, he arrived at Villa Velha, on the  Tagus, he found that the passage of the river would be disputed. Lippe,  aware of his designs, had marched to Abrantes, the key of Portugal on  the Tagus, and had posted detachments under Burgoyne and the Count  de St. Jago at the adjacent passes of Alvite and at Niza. The Spanish  general obtained possession of the castle of Villa Velha, and drove  the Count de St. Jago from the pass of Alvite; but while some of the  Spaniards were pursuing the routed Portuguese forces, Burgoyne threw  a detachment across the Tagus upon Villa Velha, and while the Count  d'Abrantes was amused in front by a feigned attack from Niza, this  detachment, commanded by Colonel Lee, entered their quarters in the  rear, and began a terrible fire of musquetry. It was under cover of the  night that Lee entered the quarters of the Spanish commander, and thus  surprised, the Spaniards were routed with terrible slaughter, while  their magazines were destroyed and their guns spiked. This was a blow  from which the Spaniards could not recover; and the French invading  forces having failed in their co-operation, his provisions beginning to  fail, the autumnal rains to descend in torrents, and the peasantry to  block up the roads, the Count d'Aranda dismantled the few fortresses he  had taken, and returned to Spain. To all these losses and defeats was  added the capture of the Spanish ship, Hermione, off Cape St. Vincent,  by the English, having treasure on board that amounted to nearly  L1,000,000 sterling. The only expedition of the English which failed  during this year was that against Buenos Ayres, which was as ill  conceived as it was paltry. But this gave Spain no hope for the future.  Taught experience by reverses, the war with England became, indeed,  unpopular with the Spanish people, and their universal cry was, at  the close of this campaign, \"Peace with England, and war with all the  world!\"          DISSENSIONS IN THE CABINET.    Early in January of this year died the Czarina Elizabeth, one of the  most bitter and inveterate enemies of our ally, the King of Prussia. She  was succeeded in her empire by Peter III., who, by the month of March,  had concluded a close alliance with Frederick, placing an army of 20,000  men, which had hitherto fought against him, entirely at his disposal to  fight against Austria. This had no sooner become known to the English  cabinet, than Bute and his party proposed that no further subsidies  should be paid to Frederick; at the same time, they reminded his  Prussian majesty, that he had himself declared that if he were once  secured by the neutrality of Russia, he should have little need of  further assistance from England. But the old Duke of Newcastle would  not admit the validity of this reasoning of his colleagues. He waited  on Bute, and declared his intention to resign, unless a subsidy of  L2,000,000 was paid, and the continental war continued. Bute answered  drily, \"that if the money were granted, peace might be retarded;\" but he  never requested him to continue in office, nor said a civil word to the  aged politician. Accordingly, the Duke repaired from the minister to his  master, and resigned his office, refusing a pension which was offered  as a reward for his services, and for the large sacrifices which he had  made since he had been minister, out of his private fortunes. \"If he  could no longer be permitted to serve his country,\" he said, \"he was at  least determined not to be a burden on it: that if his private fortune  had suffered by his loyalty, it was his pleasure, his glory, and his  pride; and that he desired no reward but his majesty's approbation.\"  Horace Walpole says, that he retired from the royal presence  comparatively a poor man, to find how solitary and deserted could be the  mansion of an ex-minister. Newcastle had been more than forty-five years  in the cabinet, and this utter disregard to money-making exhibits his  patriotism in a strong light: few would have served their country so  long without well replenishing their coffers, especially at that age,  when the virtues of disinterestedness and self-abnegation were exotic  rather than indigenous to the human heart.    Bute had his reasons for answering the Duke of Newcastle coldly, and the  result answered his expectations. He succeeded the ex-minister at the  head of the treasury, \"taking the reins of government with almost as  little experience as Phaeton, and meeting with a fall almost as soon.\"  Mr. George Grenville was appointed secretary of state; but he afterwards  exchanged posts with Lord Halifax, who had recently been appointed head  of the admiralty. Lord Barrington was removed from the Exchequer in  which office he was succeeded by Sir Francis Dashwood, and he was  appointed treasurer of the navy. Soon after the Duke of Devonshire  resigned his post of lord high chamberlain, and the Earl of Hardwicke  retired from public life altogether. Many of the friends of the duke  retained their places or accepted others; but several noblemen and  commoners of distinction before the end of the year ranged themselves in  the ranks of opposition. Amongst these was the Duke of Newcastle,  who, although during the summer he had abstained from opposing the  government, at length formed a political connexion with the Duke of  Cumberland, whom he had before invariably opposed.          EVENTS IN GERMANY, ETC.    Frederick of Prussia had not only entered into an alliance with Russia,  but towards the end of May he had concluded a peace with Sweden.  Backed by these two powers he boasted that he was in possession of  more advantages than he could have derived from gaining three pitched  battles, and without waiting for the English subsidy he took the field.  He began operations in Silesia, and directed his attention to the  recovery of Schweidnitz. He was aided in his designs by his brother,  Prince Henry, who had gained an important battle near Freyburg, and thus  changed the aspect of affairs in Saxony; but while he was intent on his  plans, he was threatened with a sudden reverse of fortune. This was the  death of his new ally, the Czar Peter.    After making peace with Frederick, and sending 20,000 of his troops  to serve under him, Peter, from a spirit of admiration of the Prussian  monarch, and of enthusiasm in his cause, insisted upon introducing the  Prussian discipline, and even the Prussian uniform into his army. He  set the example by appearing in the dress of a Prussian general, and he  often observed that, if he had remained Duke of Holstein, he would have  commanded a regiment in the Prussian service, and have become personally  acquainted with Frederick. This naturally offended the national  prejudices; but he took a more fatal step for his own welfare, by  building or dedicating Protestant chapels, by ordering the removal  of painted images of saints from the churches, and by checking the  entrances of novices into convents. By these measures he therefore  gained himself many enemies both among the military and the priesthood.  Every third man he admitted into his councils or his presence, it has  been said, was a traitor. His fall, however, might have been far distant  but for the wife of his bosom. Catherine, Princess of Anhalt Zerbst,  charmed the Russians as much as Peter disgusted them, and she was,  moreover, induced to believe that he had discovered her guilty connexion  with Count Gregory Orloff, and entertained a design of divorcing her and  casting her into prison, that he might raise his own favourite mistress,  Elizabeth Countess of Woronzow, to the throne. Hence--and being also  inflamed with ambition--Catherine lent a willing ear to the complaints  of the army, clergy, and nobility, and, aided by them, she effected  another revolution in Russia. Habited in the garb of a man, and  surrounded by some of the military and nobility, she proceeded to  the church of the Virgin Mary of Casan, where a vast concourse of the  clergy, the nobles, and the soldiery hailed her on her arrival as their  deliverer. She was crowned sole empress by the Archbishop of Novogorod,  and all present took the oath of allegiance to her. From the church,  Catherine proceeded to the senate, which at once acknowledged her right,  and swore fidelity to her cause. All the adherents of her husband were  then arrested, and Peter himself was thrown into prison, where, after a  few days, he died, as some say by disease, but more probably as others  assert, by assassination.    No one was more interested in these proceedings than Frederick of  Prussia. He conceived that he might find an enemy as implacable in  Catherine as he had found in her predecessor, Elizabeth. His forebodings  were not fully realized, for while the empress recalled the Russian  troops serving under him, she restored the Prussian territories which  had been occupied by Elizabeth, and promised to observe a strict  neutrality. Thus set free from his fears, Frederick proceeded in his  campaign with his accustomed vigour. Schweidnitz and Silesia were  recovered, and the Austrians were driven into Bohemia, one part of the  Prussian army advancing to the very gates of Prague. At the same time,  the allied armies, under Prince Ferdinand and the Marquis of Granby,  reduced Cassel, expelled the French from Hesse,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19226"],[0,"The Dog's Book of Verse (#7)"],[1,"him right in the side,    So he just gave a queer little squeal    And curled up and stretched out and died.    His tail it was not very long,    He was curly and not very tall;    But he never did anything wrong--    He was just our dog, mister--that's all.        ANONYMOUS.            RAGGED ROVER        I have still a vision of him    Ragged Rover, as he lay    In the sunshine of the morning    On the door-stone worn and gray;    Where the honeysuckle trellis    Hung its tinted blossoms low,    And the well-sweep with its bucket    Swung its burden to and fro;    Where the maples were a-quiver    In the pleasant June-time breeze;    And where droned among the phloxes    Half a hundred golden bees.      Yes, I have a vision with me    Of a home upon a hill;    And my heart is sad with longing    And my eyes with tear-drops fill.    I would be the care-free urchin    That I was so long ago    When across the sun-lit meadows    Rover with me used to go    Yonder where the graceful lindens    Threw their shadows far and cool,    And the waters waited for me    In the brimming swimming pool.      I can see him drive the cattle    From the pasture through the lane    With their mellow bells a-tinkle,    Sending out a low refrain;    I can see him drive them homeward,    Speckle, Brindle, Bess and Belle;    All the herd from down the valley    As the shades of even fell.    Thus, I wander like a pilgrim--    Slow the steps that once were strong;    Back to greet him, Ragged Rover,    And my childhood's ceaseless song.        LESLIE CLARE MANCHESTER.            TO FLUSH, MY DOG        I      Loving friend, the gift of one    Who her own true faith has run    Through thy lower nature,    Be my benediction said    With my hand upon thy head,    Gentle fellow-creature!      II      Like a lady's ringlets brown,    Flow thy silken ears adown    Either side demurely    Of thy silver-suited breast,    Shining out from all the rest    Of thy body purely.      III      Darkly brown thy body is,    Till the sunshine striking this    Alchemize its dulness,    When the sleek curls manifold    Flash all over into gold    With a burnished fulness.      IV      Underneath my stroking hand.    Startled eyes of hazel bland    Kindling, growing larger,    Up thou leanest with a spring,    Full of prank and curvetting,    Leaping like a charger.      V      Leap! thy broad tail waves a light,    Leap! thy slender feet are bright,    Canopied in fringes;    Leap! those tasselled ears of thine    Flicker strangely, fair and fine    Down their gold inches.      VI      Yet, my pretty sportive friend,    Little is't to such an end    That I praise thy rareness:    Other dogs may be thy peers    Happy in these drooping ears    And this glossy fairness.      VII      But of _thee_ it shall be said,    This dog watched beside a bed    Day and night unweary,--    Watched within a curtained room    Where no sunbeam brake the gloom,    Round the sick and dreary.      VIII      Roses, gathered for a vase,    In that chamber died space,    Beam and breeze resigning:    This dog only waited on,    Knowing, that, when light is gone,    Love remains for shining.      IX      Other dogs in thymy dew    Tracked the hares, and followed through    Sunny moor or meadow:    This dog only crept and crept    Next a languid cheek that slept,    Sharing in the shadow.      X      Other dogs of loyal cheer    Bounded at the whistle clear,    Up the woodside hieing:    This dog only watched in reach    Of a faintly uttered speech,    Or a louder sighing.      XI      And if one or two quick tears    Dropped upon his glossy ears,    Or a sigh came double,    Up he sprang in eager haste,    Fawning, fondling, breathing fast,    In a tender trouble.      XII      And this dog was satisfied    If a pale, thin hand would glide    Down his dewlaps sloping,--    Which he pushed his nose within,    After,--platforming his chin    On the palm left open.      XIII      This dog, if a friendly voice    Call him now to blither choice    Than such chamber-keeping,    \"Come out!\" praying from the door,    Presseth backward as before,    Up against me leaping.      XIV      Therefore to this dog will I,    Tenderly, not scornfully,    Render praise and favor:    With my hand upon his head,    Is my benediction said    Therefore and forever.      XV      And because he loves me so,    Better than his kind will do    Often man or woman,    Give I back more love again    Than dogs often take of men,    Leaning from my human.      XVI      Blessings on thee, dog of mine,    Pretty collars make thee fine,    Sugared milk may fat thee!    Pleasures wag on in thy tail,    Hands of gentle motion fail    Nevermore to pat thee!      XVII      Downy pillow take thy head,    Silken coverlet bestead,    Sunshine help thy sleeping!    No fly's buzzing wake thee up,    No man break thy purple cup    Set for drinking deep in!      XVIII      Whiskered cats aroynted flee,    Sturdy stoppers keep from thee    Cologne distillations;    Nuts lie in thy path for stones,    And thy feast-day macaroons    Turn to daily rations!      XIX      Mock I thee, in wishing weal?    Tears are in my eyes to feel    Thou art made so straitly:    Blessings need must straiten too,--    Little canst thou joy or do    Thou who lovest _greatly_.      XX      Yet be blessed to the height    Of all good and all delight    Pervious to thy nature;    Only _loved_ beyond that line,    With a love that answers thine,    Loving fellow-creature!        ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING.            FRANCES        You were a friend, Frances, a friend,    With feeling and regard and capable of woe.    Oh, yes, I know you were a dog, but I was just a man.    I did not buy you; no, you simply came,    Lost, and squatted on my doorstep.    The place was strange--you quivered, but stayed on,    And I had need of you.    No other fellow could make you follow him,    For you had chosen me to be your pal.    My whistle was your law,    You put your paw    Upon my palm,    And in your calm, deep eyes was writ    The promise of long comradeship.    When I came home from work,    Late and ill-tempered,    Always I heard the patter of your feet upon the oaken stairs;    Your nose was at the door-crack;    And whether I'd been bad or good that day    You fawned, and loved me just the same.    It was your way to understand.    And if I struck you, my harsh hand    Was met with your caresses.    You took my leavings, crumb and bone,    And stuck by me through thick and thin--    You were my kin.    And then one day you died    And were put deep.    But though you sleep, and ever sleep,    I sense you at my heels.        RICHARD WIGHTMAN.            TO MY SETTER, SCOUT        You are a tried and loyal friend;            The end    Of life will find you leal, unweary      Of tested bonds that naught can rend,    And e'en if years be sad and dreary,      Our plighted friendship will extend.      A truer friend man never had;            'Tis sad    That 'mongst all earthly friends the fewest      Unfaithful ones should thus be clad    In canine lowliness; yet truest      They, be their treatment good or bad.      Within your eyes methinks I find            A kind    And thoughtful look of speechless feeling      That mem'ry's loosened cords unbind,    And let the dreamy past come stealing      Through your dumb, reflective mind.      Scout, my trusty friend, can it be            You see    Again, in retrospective dreaming,      The run, the woodland, and the lea,    With past autumnal sunshine streaming      O'er ev'ry frost-dyed field and tree?      Or do you see now once again            The glen    And fern, the highland, and the thistle?      And do you still remember when    We heard the bright-eyed woodcock whistle      Down by the rippling, shrub-edged fen?      I see you turn a listening ear            To hear    The quail upon the flower-pied heather;      But, doggie, wait till uplands sere,    And then the autumn's waning weather      Will bring the sport we hold so dear.      Then we will hunt the loamy swale            And trail    The snipe, their cunning wiles o'ercoming;      And oft will flush the bevied quail,    And hear the partridge slowly drumming      Dull echoes in the leaf-strewn dale.      When wooded hills with crimson light            Are bright,    We'll stroll where trees and vines are growing,      And see birds warp their southern flight    At sundown, when the Day King's throwing      Sly kisses to the Queen of Night.        FRANK H. SELDEN.            WHY STRIK'ST THOU ME?        Why dost thou strike me?--Ever faithful      In service to thee do I live;    And often when thou wert in peril      My very utmost would I give;      My life I would lay down for thee!            Why strik'st thou me?      In blustering storm and cruel Winter,      In murky night or through the day,    Obedient I have trotted by thee      And guarded thee along the way.      I've watched thee and protected thee:            Why strik'st thou me?      When flashed the robber's steel against thee,      When thou wert threatened by his arm,    And thou didst call for aid and rescue,      Who saved thee then from mortal harm?      My blood flowed on the sand for thee:            Why strik'st thou me?      When down the sheer walls of the chasm      That glooms the torrent thou didst slide,    Thou there had perished maimed and helpless      Had I not sought thee far and wide.      Myself forgetting, sought I thee:            Why strik'st thou me?      When on the furious billows drifting      Thou heldest up a beckoning hand,    And no man dared attempt to save thee,      I brought thee safely to the land.      From certain death I rescued thee:            Why strik'st thou me?      Oh doom me not to starve and perish;      The poor old Sultan do not slay!    For thee, too, will the days soon darken      In which thy strength will fade"]]]
