Consequently it belongs to the sole authority of the Sovereign  Pontiff to publish a new edition of the symbol, as do all other  matters which concern the whole Church, such as to convoke a general  council and so forth.    Reply Obj. 1: The truth of faith is sufficiently explicit in the  teaching of Christ and the apostles. But since, according to 2 Pet.  3:16, some men are so evil-minded as to pervert the apostolic  teaching and other doctrines and Scriptures to their own destruction,  it was necessary as time went on to express the faith more explicitly  against the errors which arose.    Reply Obj. 2: This prohibition and sentence of the council was  intended for private individuals, who have no business to decide  matters of faith: for this decision of the general council did not  take away from a subsequent council the power of drawing up a new  edition of the symbol, containing not indeed a new faith, but the  same faith with greater explicitness. For every council has taken  into account that a subsequent council would expound matters more  fully than the preceding council, if this became necessary through  some heresy arising. Consequently this belongs to the Sovereign  Pontiff, by whose authority the council is convoked, and its  decision confirmed.    Reply Obj. 3: Athanasius drew up a declaration of faith, not under  the form of a symbol, but rather by way of an exposition of doctrine,  as appears from his way of speaking. But since it contained briefly  the whole truth of faith, it was accepted by the authority of the  Sovereign Pontiff, so as to be considered as a rule of faith. Since  it contained briefly the whole truth of faith, it was accepted by the  authority of the Sovereign Pontiff, so as to be considered as a rule  of faith.  _______________________    QUESTION 2    OF THE ACT OF FAITH  (In Ten Articles)    We must now consider the act of faith, and (1) the internal act;  (2) the external act.    Under the first head there are ten points of inquiry:    (1) What is \"to believe,\" which is the internal act of faith?    (2) In how many ways is it expressed?    (3) Whether it is necessary for salvation to believe in anything  above natural reason?    (4) Whether it is necessary to believe those things that are  attainable by natural reason?    (5) Whether it is necessary for salvation to believe certain things  explicitly?    (6) Whether all are equally bound to explicit faith?    (7) Whether explicit faith in Christ is always necessary for  salvation?    (8) Whether it is necessary for salvation to believe in the Trinity  explicitly?    (9) Whether the act of faith is meritorious?    (10) Whether human reason diminishes the merit of faith?  _______________________    FIRST ARTICLE [II-II, Q. 2, Art. 1]    Whether to Believe Is to Think with Assent?    Objection 1: It would seem that to believe is not to think with  assent. Because the Latin word \"cogitatio\" [thought] implies a  research, for \"cogitare\" [to think] seems to be equivalent to  \"coagitare,\" i.e. \"to discuss together.\" Now Damascene says (De Fide  Orth. iv) that faith is \"an assent without research.\" Therefore  thinking has no place in the act of faith.    Obj. 2: Further, faith resides in the reason, as we shall show  further on (Q. 4, A. 2). Now to think is an act of the cogitative  power, which belongs to the sensitive faculty, as stated in the  First Part (Q. 78, A. 4). Therefore thought has nothing to do with  faith.    Obj. 3: Further, to believe is an act of the intellect, since its  object is truth. But assent seems to be an act not of the intellect,  but of the will, even as consent is, as stated above (I-II, Q. 15, A.  1, ad 3). Therefore to believe is not to think with assent.    _On the contrary,_ This is how \"to believe\" is defined by Augustine  (De Praedest. Sanct. ii).    _I answer that,_ \"To think\" can be taken in three ways. First, in a  general way for any kind of actual consideration of the intellect, as  Augustine observes (De Trin. xiv, 7): \"By understanding I mean now  the faculty whereby we understand when thinking.\" Secondly, \"to  think\" is more strictly taken for that consideration of the  intellect, which is accompanied by some kind of inquiry, and which  precedes the intellect's arrival at the stage of perfection that  comes with the certitude of sight. In this sense Augustine says (De  Trin. xv, 16) that \"the Son of God is not called the Thought, but the  Word of God. When our thought realizes what we know and takes form  therefrom, it becomes our word. Hence the Word of God must be  understood without any thinking on the part of God, for there is  nothing there that can take form, or be unformed.\" In this way  thought is, properly speaking, the movement of the mind while yet  deliberating, and not yet perfected by the clear sight of truth.  Since, however, such a movement of the mind may be one of  deliberation either about universal notions, which belongs to the  intellectual faculty, or about particular matters, which belongs to  the sensitive part, hence it is that \"to think\" is taken secondly for  an act of the deliberating intellect, and thirdly for an act of the  cogitative power.    Accordingly, if \"to think\" be understood broadly according to the  first sense, then \"to think with assent,\" does not express completely  what is meant by \"to believe\": since, in this way, a man thinks with  assent even when he considers what he knows by science [*Science is  certain knowledge of a demonstrated conclusion through its  demonstration.], or understands. If, on the other hand, \"to think\" be  understood in the second way, then this expresses completely the  nature of the act of believing. For among the acts belonging to the  intellect, some have a firm assent without any such kind of thinking,  as when a man considers the things that he knows by science, or  understands, for this consideration is already formed. But some acts  of the intellect have unformed thought devoid of a firm assent,  whether they incline to neither side, as in one who \"doubts\"; or  incline to one side rather than the other, but on account of some  slight motive, as in one who \"suspects\"; or incline to one side yet  with fear of the other, as in one who \"opines.\" But this act \"to  believe,\" cleaves firmly to one side, in which respect belief has  something in common with science and understanding; yet its knowledge  does not attain the perfection of clear sight, wherein it agrees with  doubt, suspicion and opinion. Hence it is proper to the believer to  think with assent: so that the act of believing is distinguished from  all the other acts of the intellect, which are about the true or the  false.    Reply Obj. 1: Faith has not that research of natural reason which  demonstrates what is believed, but a research into those things  whereby a man is induced to believe, for instance that such things  have been uttered by God and confirmed by miracles.    Reply Obj. 2: \"To think\" is not taken here for the act of the  cogitative power, but for an act of the intellect, as explained above.    Reply Obj. 3: The intellect of the believer is determined to one  object, not by the reason, but by the will, wherefore assent is taken  here for an act of the intellect as determined to one object by the  will.  _______________________    SECOND ARTICLE [II-II, Q. 2, Art. 2]    Whether the Act of Faith Is Suitably Distinguished As Believing God,  Believing in a God and Believing in God?    Objection 1: It would seem that the act of faith is unsuitably  distinguished as believing God, believing in a God, and believing in  God. For one habit has but one act. Now faith is one habit since it is  one virtue. Therefore it is unreasonable to say that there are three  acts of faith.    Obj. 2: Further, that which is common to all acts of faith should not  be reckoned as a particular kind of act of faith. Now \"to believe  God\" is common to all acts of faith, since faith is founded on the  First Truth. Therefore it seems unreasonable to distinguish it from  certain other acts of faith.    Obj. 3: Further, that which can be said of unbelievers, cannot be  called an act of faith. Now unbelievers can be said to believe in a  God. Therefore it should not be reckoned an act of faith.    Obj. 4: Further, movement towards the end belongs to the will, whose  object is the good and the end. Now to believe is an act, not of the  will, but of the intellect. Therefore \"to believe in God,\" which  implies movement towards an end, should not be reckoned as a species  of that act.    _On the contrary_ is the authority of Augustine who makes this  distinction (De Verb. Dom., Serm. lxi--Tract. xxix in Joan.).    _I answer that,_ The act of any power or habit depends on the relation  of that power or habit to its object. Now the object of faith can be  considered in three ways. For, since \"to believe\" is an act of the  intellect, in so far as the will moves it to assent, as stated above  (A. 1, ad 3), the object of faith can be considered either on the part  of the intellect, or on the part of the will that moves the intellect.    If it be considered on the part of the intellect, then two things can  be observed in the object of faith, as stated above (Q. 1, A. 1). One  of these is the material object of faith, and in this way an act of  faith is \"to believe in a God\"; because, as stated above (ibid.)  nothing is proposed to our belief, except in as much as it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18757"],[0,"Prince Henry the Navigator, the Hero of Portugal and of Modern Discovery, (#7)"],[1,"in Ghazneh (A.D. 1000), of Abderrahman III. in Cordova (A.D.  950), give us the history of Arabic geography.    Beginning in the latter years of the eighth century, Moslem science was  reformed and organised, in the New Empire, by the patronage of the  Caliphs of the ninth. Itineraries of victorious generals, plans and  tables prepared by governors of provinces, and a freshly acquired  knowledge of Greek and Indian and Persian thought, made up the  subject-matter of study. The barbarism of the first believers was  passing away, and Mohammed's words were recalled: \"Seek knowledge, even  in China.\" By the end of the eighth century Ptolemy's Geography and the  now lost work of Marinus of Tyre had already been translated. Almamoun  drew to his Court all the chief \"mathematicians\" or philosophers of  Islam, such as Mohammed Al-Kharizmy, Alfergany, and Solyman the  merchant. Further he built two observatories, one at Bagdad, one at  Damascus, and procured a chart fixing the latitude and longitude of  every place known to him or his savants. Al-Kharizmy interpolated the  new Arabic Ptolemy with additions from the Sanscrit, and made some use  of Indian trigonometry. Alfergany wrote the first Arab treatise on the  Astrolabe and adopted the Greek division of the seven Climates to the  new learning. Solyman, at the time of closest intercourse between  China, India, and the Caliphate, travelled in every country of the  Further East, sailed in the \"Sea of Pitchy Darkness\" on the east coast  of Asia, and by his voyages became the prototype of Sinbad the Sailor.    The impulse given by Almamoun did not die with him. About 850 Alkendy  made a fresh version of Ptolemy; as early as 840 the Caliph Vatek-Billah  sent to explore the countries of Central Asia, and his results have been  preserved by Edrisi. A few years later (_c._ 890) Ibn-Khordadbeh, \"Son  of the Magi,\" described the principal trade-routes, the Indian by the  Red Sea from Djeddah to Scinde, the Russian by the Volga and North  Caspian, the Persian by way of Balkh to China. It was by this last that  some have thought the envoys of the English King Alfred went in 883,  till they turned south to seek India and the Christians of San Thome.    The early scientific movement in Islam reached its height in Albateny  and Massoudy at the beginning of the tenth century. The former  determined, more exactly than before, various problems of astronomical  geography.[12] The latter visited every country from Further India to  Spain;--even China and Madagascar seem to have been within the compass  of his later travels; and his voyages in the Indian Ocean bring us to  the real Sinbad Saga of the tenth century.    [Footnote 12: \"The Obliquity of the Ecliptic, the Eccentricity of the  Sun, the Precession of the Equinoxes.\"]    Sinbad, as his story appears in the _Arabian Nights_, has been traced to  an original in the Indian tales of _The Seven Sages_, in the voyages of  the age of Chosroes Nushirvan or of Haroun-Al-Rashid, but the tale  appears to be an Arabic original, the real account, with a little more  of mystery and exaggeration than usual, of the ninth-and tenth-century  travellers, from Solyman to Massoudy, reproduced in form of a series of  novels.[13]    [Footnote 13: \"With the Sinbad story is connected the historical  extension of the Arab settlements in the East African coast through the  enterprise of the Emosaid family.\"]    With Massoudy begins also the formal discussion of geographical problems  affecting Islam. Was the Caspian a land-locked sea? Did it connect with  the Euxine? Did either or both of these join the Arctic Ocean? Was  Africa an island? If so, was there also an unknown Southern Continent?  What was the shape of South-Eastern Asia? Was Ptolemy's longitude to be  wholly accepted, and if not, how was it to be bettered? By a use of  Strabo and of Albateny rather than of Ptolemy, Massoudy arrived at  fairly accurate and very plausible results. His chief novelties were the  long river channel from the Sea of Azov to the North Sea, and the strait  between South Africa and the shadowy Southern Continent. On his scheme  the Indian Ocean, or Sea of Habasch, contains most of the water surface  of the world, and the Sea of Aral appears for the first time in Moslem  geography. Lastly his account of the Arab coasting voyages from the  Persian Gulf to Socotra and Madagascar proves, implicitly, that as yet  there was no use of the compass.    Massoudy cut down the girth of the world even more than Ptolemy. The  latter had left an ocean to the west of Africa: the former made the  Canaries or Fortunate Islands, the limit of the known Western world,  abut upon India, the limit of the Eastern.    The first age of Arabic geography ends with Massoudy, its greatest name,  in the middle of the tenth century. The second age is summed up in the  work of the Eastern sage Albyrouny and of Edrisi, the Arabic Ptolemy  (A.D. 1099-1154), who found a home at the Christian Court of Roger of  Sicily. In the far East and West alike, in Spain and Morocco, in  Khorassan and India, Moslem science was now driven to take refuge among  strangers on the decay of the Caliphates of Bagdad and Cordova. The  Ghaznevides Mahmoud and Massoud in the first half of the eleventh  century, attracted to their Court not only Firdusi and Avicenna, but  Albyrouny, whose \"Canon\" became a text-book of Mohammedan science, and  who, for the range of his knowledge and the trained subtlety of his  mind, stands without a rival for his time.[14] The Spanish school, as  resulting directly in Edrisi, half Moslem, half Christian, like his  teachers, is of still more interest. One of its first traces may be  found in the Latin translation of the Arab _Almanack_ made by Bishop  Harib of Cordova in 961. It was dedicated and presented to Caliph  Hakem--one of our clearest proofs of the conscious interworking of  Catholic and Mahometan philosophy in the age of Pope Sylvester II. and  of our own St. Dunstan. A century later, on the recapture of Toledo by  Alfonso VI. (1084), an observatory was built, served by Jews and  Moslems, who had been steadily producing, through the whole of the  eleventh century, astronomical and geographical tables and dictionaries.  A whole tribe of commentators on place-names, on the climates and  constellations, and on geographical instruments was at work in this last  age of the Spanish Caliphate, and their results are brought together by  Abou Hamid of Granada and by Edrisi.    [Footnote 14: The school of Persian mathematicians who produced the maps  of Alestakliry-Ibn-Hankal, the book of latitudes and longitudes,  ascribed by Abulfeda to Alfaraby the Turk, was the immediate descendant  of Albyrouny.]    Born at Ceuta in 1099, this great geographer travelled through Spain,  France, the Western Mediterranean, and North Africa before settling at  the Norman Court of Palermo. Roger, the most civilised prince in  Christendom, the final product of the great race of Robert Guiscard and  William the Conqueror, valued Edrisi at his proper worth, refused to  part with him, and employed men in every part of the world to collect  materials for his study. Thus the Moor gained, not only for the Moslem  world but for Southern Europe as well, an approximate knowledge even of  Norway, Sweden, Finland, and the coasts of the White Sea. His work,  dedicated to Roger and called after him, _Al-Rojary_, was rewarded with  a peerage, and it was as a Sicilian Count that he finished his Celestial  Sphere and Terrestrial Disc of silver, on which \"was inscribed all the  circuit of the known world and all the rivers thereof.\"    Each of his great Arabic predecessors, along with Eratosthenes, Ptolemy,  and Strabo, was welded into his system--the result of fifteen years of  abstract study, following some thirty of practical activity in  travel.[15]    [Footnote 15: The world he divided by climates in the Greek manner,  taking no account of political divisions, or of those resting on  language or religion. Each climate was further subdivided into ten  sections. In the shape of Africa he followed Ptolemy.]    A special note may be made on Edrisi's account of the voyage of the  Lisbon \"Wanderers\" (\"Maghrurins\") some time before 1147, the date of the  final Christian capture of the Portuguese capital. For this is the  earliest recorded voyage, since the rise of Islam, definitely undertaken  on the Western Ocean to learn what was on it and what were its limits.  The Wanderers, Edrisi tells us, were eight in number, all related to one  another. They built a transport boat, took on board water and provisions  for many months, and started with the first east wind. After eleven  days, they reached a sea whose thick waters exhaled a fetid odour,  concealed numerous reefs, and were but faintly lighted. Fearing for  their lives, they changed their course, steered southwards twelve days,  and so reached an island, possibly Madeira,--which they called El Ghanam  from the sheep found there, without shepherd or anyone to tend them. On  landing, they found a spring of running water and some wild figs. They  killed some sheep, but found the flesh so bitter that they could not eat  it, and only took the skins. Sailing south twelve more days, they found  an island with houses and cultivated fields, but as they neared it they  were surrounded, made prisoners, and carried in their own boats to a  city on the sea-shore, to a house where were men of tall stature and  women of great beauty. Here they stayed three days, and on the fourth  came a man, the King's interpreter, who spoke Arabic, and asked them who  they were and what they wanted. They replied they were seeking out the  wonders of the ocean and its limits. At this the King laughed heartily,  and said to the interpreter: \"Tell them my father once ordered some of  his slaves to venture out on that sea and after sailing across the  breadth of it for a month, they found themselves"]]]
