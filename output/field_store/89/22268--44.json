Forsake thine own desires, turn thy face unto thy Lord,  and walk not in the footsteps of those who have taken their corrupt  inclinations for their god, that perchance thou mayest find shelter in the  heart of existence, beneath the redeeming shadow of Him Who traineth all  names and attributes. For they who turn away from their Lord in this day  are in truth accounted amongst the dead, though to outward seeming they  may walk upon the earth, amongst the deaf, though they may hear, and  amongst the blind, though they may see, as hath been clearly stated by Him  Who is the Lord of the Day of Reckoning: \"Hearts have they with which they  understand not, and eyes have they with which they see not....\"(46) They  walk the edge of a treacherous bank and tread the brink of a fiery  abyss.(47) They partake not of the billows of this surging and  treasure-laden Ocean, but disport themselves with their own idle words.    67 In this connection We will relate unto thee that which was revealed of  old concerning \"life\", that perchance it may turn thee away from the  promptings of self, deliver thee from the narrow confines of thy prison in  this gloomy plane, and aid thee to become of them that are guided aright  in the darkness of this world.    68 He saith, and He, verily, speaketh the truth: \"Shall the dead whom We  have quickened, and for whom We have ordained a light whereby he may walk  amongst men, be like him whose likeness is in the darkness, whence he will  not come forth?\"(48) This verse was revealed with respect to Hamzih and  Abu-Jahl, the former of whom was a believer whilst the latter disbelieved.  Most of the pagan leaders mocked and derided it, were agitated, and  clamoured: \"How did Hamzih die? And how was he restored to his former  life?\" Were ye to examine carefully the verses of God, ye would find many  such statements recorded in the Book.    69 Would that pure and stainless hearts could be found, that I might  impart unto them a sprinkling from the oceans of knowledge which My Lord  hath bestowed upon Me, so that they may soar in the heavens even as they  walk upon the earth and speed over the waters even as they course the  land, and that they may take up their souls in their hands and lay them  down in the path of their Creator. Howbeit, leave hath not been granted to  divulge this mighty secret. Indeed, it hath been from everlasting a  mystery enshrined within the treasuries of His power and a secret  concealed within the repositories of His might, lest His faithful servants  forsake their own lives in the hope of attaining this most great station  in the realms of eternity. Nor shall they who wander in this oppressive  darkness ever attain unto it.    70 O My brother! At every juncture We have restated Our theme, that all  that hath been recorded in these verses may, by the leave of God, be made  clear unto thee, and that thou mayest become independent of those who are  plunged in the darkness of self and who tread the valley of arrogance and  pride, and be of them that move within the paradise of everlasting life.    71 Say: O people! The Tree of Life hath verily been planted in the heart  of the heavenly paradise and bestoweth life in every direction. How can ye  fail to perceive and recognize it? It will in truth aid thee to grasp all  that this well-assured Soul hath disclosed unto thee of the essence of the  divine mysteries. The Dove of holiness warbleth in the heaven of  immortality and admonisheth thee to array thyself with a new vesture,  wrought of steel to shield thee from the shafts of doubt concealed in the  allusions of men, saying: \"Except a man be born of water and of the  Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the  flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Marvel not  that I said unto thee, ye must be born again.\"(49)    72 Wing then thy flight unto this divine Tree and partake of its fruits.  Gather up that which hath fallen therefrom and guard it faithfully.  Meditate then upon the utterance of one of the Prophets as He intimated to  the souls of men, through veiled allusions and hidden symbols, the  glad-tidings of the One Who was to come after Him, that thou mayest know  of a certainty that their words are inscrutable to all save those who are  endued with an understanding heart. He saith: \"His eyes were as a flame of  fire\", and \"brass-like were His feet\", and \"out of His mouth goeth a  two-edged sword\".(50) How could these words be literally interpreted? Were  anyone to appear with all these signs, he would assuredly not be human.  And how could any soul seek his company? Nay, should he appear in one  city, even the inhabitants of the next would flee from him, nor would any  soul dare approach him! Yet, shouldst thou reflect upon these statements,  thou wouldst find them to be of such surpassing eloquence and clarity as  to mark the loftiest heights of utterance and the epitome of wisdom.  Methinks it is from them that the suns of eloquence have appeared and the  stars of clarity have dawned forth and shone resplendent.    73 Behold, then, the foolish ones of bygone times and those who, in this  day, await the advent of such a being! Nor would they ever bear allegiance  unto him except that he appear in the aforementioned form. And as such a  being will never appear, so too will they never believe. Such indeed is  the measure of the understanding of these perverse and ungodly souls! How  could those who fail to understand the most evident of the evident and the  most manifest of the manifest ever apprehend the abstruse realities of the  divine precepts and the essence of the mysteries of His everlasting  wisdom?    74 I shall now briefly explain the true meaning of this utterance, that  thou mayest discover its hidden mysteries and be of them that perceive.  Examine then and judge aright that which We shall reveal unto thee, that  haply thou mayest be accounted in the sight of God amongst those who are  fair-minded in these matters.    75 Know then that He who uttered these words in the realms of glory meant  to describe the attributes of the One Who is to come in such veiled and  enigmatic terms as to elude the understanding of the people of error. Now,  when He saith: \"His eyes were as a flame of fire\", He alludeth but to the  keenness of sight and acuteness of vision of the Promised One, Who with  His eyes burneth away every veil and covering, maketh known the eternal  mysteries in the contingent world, and distinguisheth the faces that are  obscured with the dust of hell from those that shine with the light of  paradise.(51) Were His eyes not made of the blazing fire of God, how could  He consume every veil and burn away all that the people possess? How could  He behold the signs of God in the Kingdom of His names and in the world of  creation? How could He see all things with the all-perceiving eye of God?  Thus have we conferred upon Him a penetrating vision in this day. Would  that ye believe in the verses of God! For, indeed, what fire is fiercer  than this flame that shineth in the Sinai of His eyes, whereby He  consumeth all that hath veiled the peoples of the world? Immeasurably  exalted shall God remain above all that hath been revealed in His unerring  Tablets concerning the mysteries of the beginning and the end until that  day when the Crier will cry out, the day whereon we shall all return unto  Him.    76 As to the words \"brass-like were His feet\", by this is meant His  constancy upon hearing the call of God that commandeth Him: \"Be thou  steadfast as thou hast been bidden.\"(52) He shall so persevere in the  Cause of God, and evince such firmness in the path of His might, that even  if all the powers of earth and heaven were to deny Him, He would not waver  in the proclamation of His Cause, nor flee from His command in the  promulgation of His Laws. Nay rather, He will stand as firm as the highest  mountains and the loftiest peaks. He will remain immovable in His  obedience to God and steadfast in revealing His Cause and proclaiming His  Word. No obstacle will hinder Him, nor will the censure of the froward  deter Him or the repudiation of the infidels cause Him to waver. All the  hatred, the rejection, the iniquity, and the unbelief that He witnesseth  serve but to strengthen His love for God, to augment the yearning of His  heart, to heighten the exultation of His soul, and to fill His breast with  passionate devotion. Hast thou ever seen in this world brass stronger, or  blade sharper, or mountain more unyielding than this? He shall verily  stand upon His feet to confront all the inhabitants of the earth, and will  fear no one, notwithstanding that which, as thou well knowest, the people  are wont to commit. Glory be to God, Who hath established Him and called  Him forth! Potent is God to do what He pleaseth. He, in truth, is the Help  in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.    77 And further He saith: \"Out of his mouth goeth a two-edged sword.\" Know  thou that since the sword is an instrument that divideth and cleaveth  asunder, and since there proceedeth from the mouth of the Prophets and the  Chosen Ones of God that which separateth the believer from the infidel and  the lover from the beloved, this term hath been so employed, and apart  from this dividing and separating no other meaning is intended. Thus, when  He Who is the Primal Point and the eternal Sun desireth, by the leave of  God, to gather together all creation, to raise them up from the graves of  their own selves, and to divide them one from another, He shall pronounce  but one verse from Him, and this verse will distinguish truth from error  from this day unto the Day of Resurrection. What sword is sharper than  this heavenly sword, what blade more trenchant than this incorruptible  steel that severeth every tie and separateth thereby the believer from the  infidel, father from son, brother from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1694"],[0,"Our Legal Heritage: The First Thousand Years: 600 - 1600 (#7)"],[1,"  mill wrights, wheelwrights, waggon wrights, iron nail makers,  potters, soap-makers, tailors, shoemakers, salters (made salt at  the \"wyches\"), bakers, cooks, and gardeners. Most men did  carpentry work. Master carpenters worked with ax, hammer, and  saw to make houses, doors, bridges, milk- buckets, wash-tubs, and  trunks. Blacksmiths made gates, huge door hinges, locks,  latches, bolts, and horseshoes. The lord loaned these people land  on which to live for their life, called a \"life estate\", in  return for their services. The loan could continue to their  children who took up the craft. Mills were usually powered by  water.    The land of some lords included fishing villages along the  coasts. Other lords had land with iron-mining industries.    Some smiths traveled for their work, for instance, stone-wrights  building arches and windows in churches, and lead-workers  putting lead roofs on churches.    Clothing for men and women was made from wool, silk, and linen  and was usually brown in color. Men also wore leather clothing,  such as neckpieces, breeches, ankle leathers, shoes, and boots;  and metal belts under which they carried knives or axes. They  could wear leather pouches for carrying items.    Water could be carried in leather bags. Leather working  preservative techniques improved so that tanning prevented  stretching or decaying.    For their meals, people had drinking cups and bottles made of  leather, and bowls, pans, and pitchers made by the potter's  wheel. Water could be boiled in pots made of iron, brass, lead,  or clay.    Some lords had markets on their land, for which they charged a  toll [like a sales tax] for participation. There were about  fifty markets in the nation. Cattle and slaves were the usual  medium of exchange. Shaking hands was symbolic of an agreement  for a sale, which was carried out in front of witnesses at the  market. People traveled to markets on roads and bridges kept in  repair by certain men who did this work as their service to the  King.    Salt was used throughout the nation to preserve meat over the  winter. Inland saltworks had an elaborate and specialized  organization. They formed little manufacturing enclaves in the  midst of agricultural land, and they were considered to be  neither manor nor appurtenant to manors. They belonged jointly  to the King and the local earl, who shared, at a proportion of  two to one, the proceeds of the tolls upon the sale of salt and  methods of carriage on the ancient salt ways according to  cartload, horse load, or man load. Horses now had horseshoes.  The sales of salt were mostly retail, but some bought to resell.  Peddlers carried salt to sell from village to village.    At seaports on the coast, goods were loaded onto vessels owned by  English merchants to be transported to other English seaports.  London was a market town on the north side of the Thames River  and the primary port and trading center for foreign merchants.  Wheat, meal, skins, hides, wool, beer, lead, cheese, salt, and  honey were exported. Wine (mostly for the church), fish, timber,  pitch, pepper, spices, copper, gems, gold, silk, dyes, oil,  brass, sulphur, glass, and elephant and walrus ivory were  imported. There was a royal levy on exports by foreigners  merchants. The other side of the river was called Southwark. It  contained sleazy docks, prisons, gaming houses, brothels, and  inns.    Guilds in London were first associations of neighbors for the  purposes of mutual assistance. They were fraternities of persons  by voluntary compact to assist each other in poverty, including  their widows or orphans and the portioning of poor maids, and to  protect each other from injury. Their essential features are and  continue to be in the future: 1) oath of initiation, 2) entrance  fee in money or in kind and a common fund, 3) annual feast and  mass, 4) meetings at least three times yearly for guild  business, 5), obligation to attend all funerals of members, to  bear the body if need be from a distance, and to provide masses  for the dead, 6) the duty of friendly help in cases of sickness,  imprisonment, house-burning, shipwreck, or robbery, 7) rules for  decent behavior at meetings, and 8) provisions for settling  disputes without recourse to the law. Both the masses and the  feast were attended by the women. Frequently the guilds also had  a religious ceremonial to affirm their bonds of fidelity. They  readily became connected with the exercise of trades and with  the training of apprentices. They promoted and took on public  purposes such as the repairing of roads and bridges, the relief  of pilgrims, the maintenance of schools and almshouses, and the  periodic performance of pageants and miracle-plays.    Many of these London guilds were known by the name of their  founding member. There were also Frith Guilds and a Knights'  Guild. The Frith Guild's main object was to put down theft.  Members contributed to a common fund, which paid a compensation  for items stolen. Members with horses were to track the thief.  Members without horses worked in the place of the absent  horseowners until their return. The Knights' Guild was composed  of thirteen military persons to whom King Edgar granted certain  waste land in the east of London, toward Aldgate, for prescribed  services performed. This concession was confirmed by Edward the  Confessor in a charter at the suit of certain burgesses of  London, the successors of these knights. But there was no  trading privilege, and the Prior of Holy Trinity, Aldgate,  became the sovereign of the Guild and the Aldermen ex officio of  Portsoken Ward. He rendered an account to the Crown of the shares  of tallage paid by the men of the Ward and presided over the  wardmoots. Every week in London there was a folkmoot. Majority  decision was a tradition. Every London merchant who had made  three long voyages on his own behalf ranked as a thegn.    Later in the towns, there were merchant guilds, which were  composed of prosperous traders, who later became landholders.  Merchant guilds grew out of charity associations whose members  were bound by oath to each other and got together for a  guild-feast every month. Many market places were dominated by a  merchant guild, which had a monopoly of the local trade. There  were also some craft guilds composed of handicraftsmen or  artisans. Escaped bonded agricultural workers, poor people, and  traders without land migrated to towns to live, but were not  citizens.    Towns were largely self-sufficient, but salt and iron came from a  distance. It was the kings' policy to establish in every shire  at least one town with a market place where purchases would be  witnessed and a mint where reliable money was coined. Almost  every village had a watermill.    Edward the Confessor, named such for his piety, was a King of 24  years who was widely respected for his intelligence,  resourcefulness, good judgment, and wisdom. His educated Queen  Edith, whom he relied on for advice and cheerful courage, was a  stabilizing influence on him. They were served by a number of  thegns, who had duties in the household, which was composed of  the hall, the courtyard, and the bedchamber. They were important  men, thegns by rank. They were landholders, often in several  areas, and held leading positions in the shires, although they  were not sheriffs. They were also priests and clerics, who  maintained the religious services and performed tasks for which  literacy was necessary.    The court was host to many of the greatest magnates and prelates  of the land at the time of great ecclesiastical festivals, when  the King held more solemn courts and feasted his vassals. These  included all the great earls, the majority of bishops, some  abbots, and a number of thegns and clerics. Edward had a witan  of wise men to advise him, but sometimes the King would speak in  the hall after dinner and listen to what comments were made from  the mead-benches. As the court moved about the country, many men  came to pay their respects and attend to local business.    The main governmental activities were: war, collection of  revenue, religious education, and administration of justice. For  war, the shires had to provide a certain number of men and the  ports quotas of ships with crews. The King was the patron of the  English church. He gave the church peace and protection. He  presided over church councils and appointed bishops. As for the  administration of justice, the public courts were almost all  under members of Edward's court, bishops, earls, and reeves.  Edward's mind was often troubled and disturbed by the threat  that law and justice would be overthrown, by the pervasiveness of  disputes and discord, by the raging of wicked presumption, by  money interfering with right and justice, and by avarice  kindling all of these. He saw it as his duty to courageously  oppose the wicked by taking good men as models, by enriching the  churches of God, by relieving those oppressed by wicked judges,  and by judging equitably between the powerful and the humble.    A King's grant of land entailed two documents: a charter giving  boundaries and conditions and a writ, usually addressed to the  shire court, listing the judicial and financial privileges  conveyed with the land. These were usually sac and soke [petty  jurisdiction over inhabitants of the estate], toll and team [a  share in the profits from trade conducted within the estate], and  infangenetheof [the authority to hang and take the chattels of a  thief caught on the property]. The writ was created by the  Chancery, which had been established by the King to draft  documents and keep records. The writ was a small piece of  parchment addressed to a royal official or dependent commanding  him to perform some task for the King. By the 1000s A.D., the  writ contained a seal: a lump of wax with the impress of the  Great Seal of England.    The town of Coventry consisted"]]]
