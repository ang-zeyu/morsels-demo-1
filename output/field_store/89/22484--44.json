Once upon a time something happened whose like never occurred  before--if it had not happened it would not be told--since the flea  had one foot shod with ninety-nine pounds of iron and jumped into the  skies to get us fairy tales.    There was once a mighty emperor and empress. Both were young and  handsome, and as they desired the blessing of children they did every  thing that was necessary to secure it, that is they went to the  witches and philosophers and asked them to read the stars to find out  whether they would have children or not. But it was all in vain.  Finally the emperor heard that a very wise old man lived in a  neighboring village, and sent for him. The messengers returned with  the answer: \"Let him who needs me come to me.\" So the emperor and  empress set out for the wise man's house, taking with them several of  their courtiers, attendants, and soldiers. When the old man saw them  in the distance, he rose, went to meet them, and said at once:    \"Welcome! But what do you want to know, oh, emperor! your wish will  bring you sorrow.\"    \"I am not here to question you about that,\" replied the emperor, \"but  to learn whether you have any plants you can give us that will bestow  the blessing of children.\"    \"I have,\" the old man answered, \"but you will possess only _one_  child. He will be a handsome, lovable boy, yet you will not be able to  keep him long.\"    After the emperor and empress had obtained the herbs they joyfully  returned to the palace. The whole empire, the courtiers, and all the  attendants rejoiced too. But when the hour of its birth came, the  child began to scream in a way no magic arts could silence. The  emperor commenced to promise it all the good things the world  contained, but it was impossible to quiet it.    \"Hush, father's pet,\" said the emperor, \"I will give you this or that  kingdom; hush, my son, I will give you this or that princess for your  wife.\" At last, when he saw the child would not stop, he added: \"Hush,  my boy, I will give you youth without age and life without death.\"    Then the prince stopped crying; the courtiers beat drums and blew  trumpets, and there were great rejoicings throughout the empire for a  whole week.    The older the boy grew, the more thoughtful and reflective he became.  He went to the schools and the philosophers and gained every kind of  learning, so that the emperor died of joy and came to life again. The  whole realm was proud of having a prince so wise and learned, a  second King Solomon. But one day, when the lad had just reached his  fifteenth year and the emperor sat at a banquet with the nobles and  grandees of the country, the handsome prince rose, saying: \"Father,  the time has come, you must now give me what you promised at my  birth!\"    When the emperor heard this he grew very sorrowful and answered: \"Why,  my son, how can I give you an impossible thing? If I promised it to  you then, it was only to hush you.\"    \"If you can't give it to me, father, I shall be obliged to wander  through the whole world till I find what was promised to me, and for  which I was born.\"    Then all the nobles and the emperor fell at his feet and besought him  not to quit the country, because, as the courtiers said, his father  was growing old, and they would place him on the throne and give him  the most beautiful princess under the sun for his wife. But it was  impossible to shake his resolution, he remained as firm as a rock.  After his father had seen and duly considered all these things, he  gave his consent and prepared to supply the prince with provisions and  whatever else he might need for his journey.    The young hero went to the imperial stables, where the finest steeds  in the whole realm were standing, to choose one of them; but when he  laid his hand on the horse's tail he knocked it down, and so they all  fell, one after another. At last, just as he was going out, he let his  eyes wander around the building once more and saw in one corner a  sick, weak horse, covered with sores. He went up to it, and when he  grasped it by the tail, the animal turned its head, saying:    \"What do you command, my master? I thank God that He has permitted a  hero's hand to touch me once more.\"    And, planting its feet firmly, it remained standing. The young prince  told it what he intended to do, and the horse replied:    \"To obtain your wish, you must ask your father for the sword, lance,  bow, quiver of arrows, and garments he wore when a youth; but you must  take care of me with your own hands for six weeks and give me oats  boiled in milk.\"    When the prince begged the emperor for the articles the horse had  advised, the monarch called the major-domo of the palace and ordered  him to open all the chests of clothing, that his son might choose what  he pleased. The young hero, after rummaging them three whole days, at  last found in the very bottom of an old trunk the weapons and garments  his father had worn in his youth, but the arms were covered with rust.  He set to work to clean them with his own hands and in six weeks,  during the time he was taking care of the horse, he succeeded in  making the weapons as bright and shining as a mirror. When the horse  heard from the handsome prince that the clothes and arms were cleaned  and ready, it shook itself once. All the sores instantly fell off and  there it stood, a strong, well-formed animal, with four wings. When  the hero saw this, he said:    \"We'll go in three days!\"    \"May you have a long life, master. From to-day I shall be at your  service,\" the horse answered.    On the morning of the third day there was great mourning throughout  the whole court and empire. The handsome prince, clad like a hero,  holding his sword in his hand and riding the horse he had chosen, took  leave of the emperor, the empress, the great nobles and lesser  grandees, the army, and all the attendants, who, with tears in their  eyes, implored him to give up the journey and not risk his life; but  setting spurs to his steed, he dashed through the gate like the wind,  followed by the carts loaded with provisions and money, and the two  hundred horsemen the emperor had commanded to accompany him.    After reaching the boundaries of his father's country and arriving at  the wilderness, the prince distributed all his property among the  escort, bade them farewell, and sent them back, keeping for himself  only as much food as the horse could carry. Then he turned toward the  east and rode for three days and three nights, till he came to a wide  plain where lay a great many human bones.    When he stopped here to rest, the horse said: \"You must know, master,  that we are on the land of a Woodpecker Fairy who is so wicked that  nobody can enter her domain without being murdered. She was once a  woman, but the curse of her parents, whom she angered by her  disobedience, turned her into a woodpecker. She is with her children  now, but you will meet her to-morrow in yonder forest; she will come  to kill you. She is terribly big, but don't be frightened; hold the  bow ready to pierce her with an arrow, and keep your sword and lance  in hand, so that you can use them in case of need.\"    Then they went to rest, taking turns in watching.    At dawn the next morning they prepared to pass through the forest; the  prince saddled and bridled the horse, drew the girths tighter than  usual, and mounted. Suddenly he heard a tremendous crashing. \"Make  ready, master,\" said the horse, \"the Woodpecker Fairy is coming.\" As  she approached, she moved so fast that she tore the trees down; but  the horse leaped upward like the wind, so that it was almost over her,  and the prince shot off one of her feet with an arrow. Just as he was  about to discharge the second arrow, she cried:    \"Stop, my young hero, I'll do you no harm.\" And seeing that he did not  believe her, she gave him the promise written with her own blood.    \"Your horse can not be killed, my young hero,\" she added, \"it is  enchanted; if it hadn't been for that, I would have roasted and eaten  you. Know that until to-day no mortal man has ventured to cross my  boundaries as far as this; a few bold wights who dared to make the  trial, reached the plain where you saw so many bones.\"    They now went to the fairy's house, where she entertained them as  guests. But while sitting at the table enjoying the banquet, the  Woodpecker Fairy moaned with pain, so the prince pulled the foot he  had shot off out of the traveling bag where he had put it, fastened it  on, and it instantly healed. The hostess, in her joy, kept open house  for three days, and begged the emperor's son to choose one of her  daughters, all three of whom were beautiful as fairies, for his wife.  He would not do that, but told her what he was seeking, and she  replied:    \"With your horse and your heroic courage, I believe you will succeed.\"    After three days had passed, the prince prepared to continue his  journey and departed. He rode on, and on, and on; the road seemed to  grow longer and longer, but when he had finally crossed the frontiers  of the Woodpecker Fairy's kingdom, he entered a beautiful meadow, one  side of which was covered with blooming plants, but the other was  scorched.    The prince asked why the grass was singed, and the horse answered:    \"We are now in the domain of the Scorpion Witch; she is the Woodpecker  Fairy's sister, but they are both so wicked that they can't live  together. Their parents' curse has fallen upon them, and so, as you  see, they have become monsters; their enmity goes beyond all bounds;  they are always trying to get possession of each other's lands. When  this one is very angry she spits fire and pitch; she must have had  some quarrel with her sister, and, to drive her out of her kingdom,  has burned the grass on which she was standing. She is even worse than  her sister, and has three heads. We will rest awhile now, and be ready"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20556"],[0,"Lamarck, the Founder of Evolution (#7)"],[1,"Intendant of the Garden was completely ignored, and  his unpopularity and inefficiency led to his resignation. But meanwhile,  in his letter to Condorcet, the perpetual Secretary of the Institute of  France, remonstrating against the proposed suppression by the Assembly  of the place of Intendant, he partially retracted his action against  Lamarck, saying that Lamarck's work, \"_peut etre utile, mais n'est pas  absolutement necessaire_.\" The Intendant, as Hamy adds, knew well the  value of the services rendered by Lamarck at the Royal Garden, and that,  as a partial recompense, he had been appointed botanist to the museum.  He also equally well knew that the author of the _Flore Francaise_ was  in a most precarious situation and supported on his paltry salary a  family of seven persons, as he was already at this time married and had  five children. \"But his own place was in peril, and he did not hesitate  to sacrifice the poor savant whom he had himself installed as keeper of  the herbarium.\" (Hamy, _l. c._, pp. 34, 35.)    [25] The first idea of the foundation of the Jardin dates from 1626, but  the actual carrying out of the conception was in 1635. The first act of  installation took place in 1640. Gui de la Brosse, in order to please  his high protectors, the first physicians of the king, named his  establishment _Jardin des Plantes Medicinales_. It was renovated by  Fagon, who was born in the Jardin, and whose mother was the niece of Gui  de la Brosse. By his disinterestedness, activity, and great scientific  capacity, he regenerated the garden, and under his administration  flourished the great professors, Duverney, Tournefort, Geoffroy the  chemist, and others (Perrier, _l. c._, p. 59). Fagon was  succeeded by Buffon, \"the new legislator and second founder.\"  His Intendancy lasted from 1739 to 1788.    [26] Three days after, August 30th, the report was ready, the discussion  began, and the foundations of the new organization were definitely laid.  \"No longer any Jardin or Cabinets, but a Museum of Natural History,  whose aim was clearly defined. No officers with unequal functions; all  are professors and all will give instruction. They elect themselves and  present to the king _a candidate for each vacant place_. _Finally, the  general administration of the Museum will be confided to the officers of  the establishment_, this implying the suppression of the Intendancy.\"  (Hamy, _l. c._, p. 37.)    [27] Hamy, _l. c._, p. 37. The Faubourg Saint Victor was a part of the  Quartier Latin, and included the Jardin des Plantes.    [28] _Devis de la Depense du Jardin National des Plantes et du Cabinet  d'Histoire Naturelle pour l'Annee 1793_, presented to the National  Convention by Citoyen Bernardin de Saint-Pierre. In it appeared a note  relative to Lamarck, which, after stating that, though full of zeal and  of knowledge of botany, his time was not entirely occupied; that for two  months he had written him in regard to the duties of his position;  referred to the statements of two of his seniors, who repeated the old  gossip as to the claim of La Billarderie that his place was useless, and  also found fault with him for not recognizing the artificial system of  Linne in the arrangement of the herbarium, added: \"However, desirous of  retaining M. La Marck, father of six children, in the position which he  needs, and not wishing to let his talents be useless, after several  conversations with the older officers of the Jardin, I have believed  that, M. Desfontaines being charged with the botanical lectures in the  school, and M. Jussieu in the neighborhood of Paris, it would be well to  send M. La Marck to herborize in some parts of the kingdom, in order to  complete the French flora, as this will be to his taste, and at the same  time very useful to the progress of botany; thus everybody will be  employed and satisfied.\"--Perrier, _Lamarck et le Transformisme Actuel_,  pp. 13, 14. (Copied from the National Archives.) \"The life of Bernardin  de St. Pierre (1737-1814) was nearly as irregular as that of his friend  and master [Rousseau]. But his character was essentially crafty and  selfish, like that of many other sentimentalists of the first order.\"  (Morley's _Rousseau_, p. 437, footnote.)    [29] Joseph Lakanal was born in 1762, and died in 1845. He was a  professor of philosophy in a college of the Oratory, and doctor of the  faculty at Angers, when in 1792 he was sent as a representative  (_depute_) to the National Convention, and being versed in educational  questions he was placed on the Committee of Public Instruction and  elected its president. He was the means, as Hamy states, of saving from  a lamentable destruction, by rejuvenizing them, the scientific  institutions of ancient France. During the Revolution he voted for the  death of Louis XVI.    Lakanal also presented a plan of organization of a National Institute,  what is now the Institut de France, and was charged with designating the  first forty-eight members, who should elect all the others. He was by  the first forty-eight thus elected. Proscribed as a regicide at the  second restoration, he sailed for the United States, where he was warmly  welcomed by Jefferson. The United States Congress voted him five hundred  acres of land. The government of Louisiana offered him the presidency of  its university, which, however, he did not accept. In 1825 he went to  live on the shores of Mobile Bay on land which he purchased from the  proceeds of the sale of the land given him by Congress. Here he became a  pioneer and planter.    In 1830 he manifested a desire to return to his native country, and  offered his services to the new government, but received no answer and  was completely ignored. But two years later, thanks to the initiative of  Geoffroy St. Hilaire, who was the means of his reelection to the French  Academy, he decided to return, and did so in 1837. He lived in  retirement in Paris, where he occupied himself until his death in 1845  in writing a book entitled _Sejour d'un Membre de l'Institut de France  aux Etats-Unis pendant vingt-deux ans_. The manuscript mysteriously  disappeared, no trace of it ever having been found. (Larousse, _Grand  Dictionnaire Universel_, Art. LAKANAL.) His bust now occupies a  prominent place among those of other great men in the French Academy of  Sciences.    [30] This is seen to be the case by the title of the pamphlet: _Memoire  sur les Cabinets d'Histoire Naturelle, et particulierement sur celui du  Jardin des Plantes_.    [31] Bourguin also adds that \"on one point Lamarck, with more foresight,  went farther than Lakanal. He had insisted on the necessity of the  appointment of four demonstrators for zooelogy. In the decree of June 10,  1793, they were even reduced to two. Afterwards they saw that this  number was insufficient, and to-day (1863) the department of zooelogy is  administered at the museum by four professors, in conformity with the  division indicated by Lamarck.\"          CHAPTER IV    PROFESSOR OF INVERTEBRATE ZOOeLOGY AT THE MUSEUM      Lamarck's career as a botanist comprised about twenty-five years. We now  come to the third stage of his life--Lamarck the zooelogist and  evolutionist. He was in his fiftieth year when he assumed the duties of  his professorship of the zooelogy of the invertebrate animals; and at a  period when many men desire rest and freedom from responsibility, with  the vigor of an intellectual giant Lamarck took upon his shoulders new  labors in an untrodden field both in pure science and philosophic  thought.    It was now the summer of 1793, and on the eve of the Reign of Terror,  when Paris, from early in October until the end of the year, was in the  deadliest throes of revolution. The dull thud of the guillotine, placed  in front of the Tuileries, in the Place de la Revolution, which is now  the Place de la Concorde, a little to the east of where the obelisk of  Luxor now stands, could almost be heard by the quiet workers in the  Museum, for sansculottism in its most aggressive and hideous forms raged  not far from the Jardin des Plantes, then just on the border of the  densest part of the Paris of the first Revolution. Lavoisier, the  founder of modern chemistry, was guillotined some months later. The Abbe  Hauey, the founder of crystallography, had been, the year previous,  rescued from prison by young Geoffroy St. Hilaire, his neck being barely  saved from the gleaming axe. Roland, the friend of science and letters,  had been so hunted down that at Rouen, in a moment of despair, on  hearing of his wife's death, he thrust his sword-cane through his heart.  Madame Roland had been beheaded, as also a cousin of her husband, and we  can well imagine that these fateful summer and autumn days were scarcely  favorable to scientific enterprises.[32] Still, however, amid the loud  alarums of this social tempest, the Museum underwent a new birth which  proved not to be untimely. The Minister of the Interior (Garat) invited  the professors of the Museum to constitute an assembly to nominate a  director and a treasurer, and he begged them to present extracts of  their deliberations for him to send to the executive council, \"under the  supervision of which the National Museum is for the future placed;\"  though in general the assembly only reported to the Minister matters  relating to the expenses, the first annual grant of the Museum being  100,000 livres.    Four days after, June 14th, the assembly met and adopted the name of the  establishment in the following terms: _Museum d'Histoire Naturelle  decrete par la Convention Nationale le 10 Juin, 1793_; and at a meeting  held on the 9th of July the assembly definitely organized the first  bureau, with Daubenton as director, Thouin treasurer, and Desfontaines  secretary. Lamarck, as the records show, was present at all these  meetings, and at the first one, June 14th, Lamarck and Fourcroy were  designated as commissioners for"]]]
