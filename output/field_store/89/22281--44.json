Yet it was he, and the  knowledge of what he was to them, that linked their souls with a common  bond.          XIV      It was the third day after their meeting. Hour by hour their intimacy  had increased. Ethel was sitting in a large wicker-chair. She restlessly  fingered her parasol, mechanically describing magic circles in the sand.  Ernest lay at her feet. With his knees clasped between his hands, he  gazed into her eyes.    \"Why are you trying so hard to make love to me?\" the woman asked, with  the half-amused smile with which the Eve near thirty receives the homage  of a boy. There is an element of insincerity in that smile, but it is a  weapon of defence against love's artillery.    Sometimes, indeed, the pleading in the boy's eyes and the cry of the  blood pierces the woman's smiling superiority. She listens, loves and  loses.    Ethel Brandenbourg was listening, but the idea of love had not yet  entered into her mind. Her interest in Ernest was due in part to his  youth and the trembling in his voice when he spoke of love. But what  probably attracted her most powerfully was the fact that he intimately  knew the man who still held her woman's heart in the hollow of his hand.  It was half in play, therefore, that she had asked him that question.    Why did he make love to her? He did not know. Perhaps it was the  irresistible desire to be petted which young poets share with  domesticated cats. But what should he tell her? Polite platitudes were  out of place between them.    Besides he knew the penalty of all tender entanglements. Women treat  love as if it were an extremely tenuous wire that can be drawn out  indefinitely. This is a very expensive process. It costs us the most  precious, the only irretrievable thing in the universe--time. And to him  time was song; for money he did not care. The Lord had hallowed his lips  with rhythmic speech; only in the intervals of his singing might he  listen to the voice of his heart--strangest of all watches, that tells  the time not by minutes and hours, but by the coming and going of love.    The woman beside him seemed to read his thoughts.    \"Child, child,\" she said, \"why will you toy with love? Like Jehovah, he  is a jealous god, and nothing but the whole heart can placate him. Woe  to the woman who takes a poet for a lover. I admit it is fascinating,  but it is playing _va banque_. In fact, it is fatal. Art or love will  come to harm. No man can minister equally to both. A genuine poet is  incapable of loving a woman.\"    \"Pshaw! You exaggerate. Of course, there is a measure of truth in what  you say, but it is only one side of the truth, and the truth, you know,  is always Janus-faced. In fact, it often has more than two faces. I can  assure you that I have cared deeply for the women to whom my love-poetry  was written. And you will not deny that it is genuine.\"    \"God forbid! Only you have been using the wrong preposition. You should  have said that it was written at them.\"    Ernest stared at her in child-like wonder.    \"By Jove! you are too devilishly clever!\" he exclaimed.    After a little silence he said not without hesitation: \"And do you apply  your theory to all artists, or only to us makers of rhyme?\"    \"To all,\" she replied.    He looked at her questioningly.    \"Yes,\" she said, with a new sadness in her voice, \"I, too, have paid the  price.\"    \"You mean?\"    \"I loved.\"    \"And art?\"    \"That was the sacrifice.\"    \"Perhaps you have chosen the better part,\" Ernest said without  conviction.    \"No,\" she replied, \"my tribute was brought in vain.\"    This she said calmly, but Ernest knew that her words were of tragic  import.    \"You love him still?\" he observed simply.    Ethel made no reply. Sadness clouded her face like a veil or like a grey  mist over the face of the waters. Her eyes went out to the sea,  following the sombre flight of the sea-mews.    In that moment he could have taken her in his arms and kissed her with  infinite tenderness.    But tenderness between man and woman is like a match in a  powder-magazine. The least provocation, and an amorous explosion will  ensue, tumbling down the card-houses of platonic affection. If he  yielded to the impulse of the moment, the wine of the springtide would  set their blood afire, and from the flames within us there is no escape.    \"Come, come,\" she said, \"you do not love me.\"    He protested.    \"Ah!\" she cried triumphantly, \"how many sonnets would you give for me?  If you were a usurer in gold instead of in rhyme, I would ask how many  dollars. But it is unjust to pay in a coin that we value little. To a  man starving in gold mines, a piece of bread weighs more than all the  treasures of the earth. To you, I warrant your poems are the standard of  appreciation. How many would you give for me? One, two, three?\"    \"More.\"    \"Because you think love would repay you with compound interest,\" she  observed merrily.    He laughed.    And when love turns to laughter the danger is passed for the moment.          XV      Thus three weeks passed without apparent change in their relations.  Ernest possessed a personal magnetism that, always emanating from him,  was felt most deeply when withdrawn. He was at all times involuntarily  exerting his power, which she ever resisted, always on the alert, always  warding off.    When at last pressure of work made his immediate departure for New York  imperative, he had not apparently gained the least ground. But Ethel  knew in her heart that she was fascinated, if not in love. The personal  fascination was supplemented by a motherly feeling toward Ernest that,  sensuous in essence, was in itself not far removed from love. She  struggled bravely and with external success against her emotions, never  losing sight of the fact that twenty and thirty are fifty.    Increasingly aware of her own weakness, she constantly attempted to  lead the conversation into impersonal channels, speaking preferably of  his work.    \"Tell me,\" she said, negligently fanning herself, \"what new inspiration  have you drawn from your stay at the seaside?\"    \"Why,\" he exclaimed enthusiastically, \"volumes and volumes of it. I  shall write the great novel of my life after I am once more quietly  installed at Riverside Drive.\"    \"The great American novel?\" she rejoined.    \"Perhaps.\"    \"Who will be your hero--Clarke?\"    There was a slight touch of malice in her words, or rather in the pause  between the penultimate word and the last. Ernest detected its presence,  and knew that her love for Reginald was dead. Stiff and cold it lay in  her heart's chamber--beside how many others?--all emboxed in the coffin  of memory.    \"No,\" he replied after a while, a little piqued by her suggestion,  \"Clarke is not the hero. What makes you think that he casts a spell on  everything I do?\"    \"Dear child,\" she replied, \"I know him. He cannot fail to impress his  powerful personality upon all with whom he comes in contact, to the  injury of their intellectual independence. Moreover, he is so brilliant  and says everything so much better than anybody else, that by his very  splendor he discourages effort in others. At best his influence will  shape your development according to the tenets of his mind--curious,  subtle and corrupted. You will become mentally distorted, like one of  those hunchback Japanese trees, infinitely wrinkled and infinitely  grotesque, whose laws of growth are not determined by nature, but by the  diseased imagination of the East.\"    \"I am no weakling,\" Ernest asserted, \"and your picture of Clarke is  altogether out of perspective. His splendid successes are to me a source  of constant inspiration. We have some things in common, but I realise  that it is along entirely different lines that success will come to me.  He has never sought to influence me, in fact, I never received the  smallest suggestion from him.\" Here the Princess Marigold seemed to peer  at him through the veil of the past, but he waved her aside. \"As for my  story,\" he continued, \"you need not go so far out of your way to find  the leading character?\"    \"Who can it be?\" Ethel remarked, with a merry twinkle, \"You?\"    \"Ethel,\" he said sulkingly, \"be serious. You know that it is you.\"    \"I am immensely flattered,\" she replied. \"Really, nothing pleases me  better than to be immortalised in print, since I have little hope  nowadays of perpetuating my name by virtue of pencil or brush. I have  been put into novels before and am consumed with curiosity to hear the  plot of yours.\"    \"If you don't mind, I had rather not tell you just yet,\" Ernest said.  \"It's going to be called Leontina--that's you. But all depends on the  treatment. You know it doesn't matter much what you say so long as you  say it well. That's what counts. At any rate, any indication of the plot  at this stage would be decidedly inadequate.\"    \"I think you are right,\" she ventured. \"By all means choose your own  time to tell me. Let's talk of something else. Have you written  anything since your delightful book of verse last spring? Surely now is  your singing season. By the time we are thirty the springs of pure lyric  passion are usually exhausted.\"    Ethel's inquiry somehow startled him. In truth, he could find no  satisfactory answer. A remark relative to his play--Clarke's play--rose  to the threshold of his lips, but he almost bit his tongue as soon as he  realised that the strange delusion which had possessed him that night  still dominated the undercurrents of his cerebration. No, he had  accomplished but little during the last few months--at least, by way of  creative literature. So he replied that he had made money. \"That is  something,\" he said. \"Besides, who can turn out a masterpiece every  week? An artist's brain is not a machine, and in the respite from  creative work I have gathered strength for the future. But,\" he added,  slightly annoyed, \"you are not listening.\"    His exclamation"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17149"],[0,"Creative Chemistry: Descriptive of Recent Achievements in the Chemical (#7)"],[1,"cyanamid  carbon    Calcium cyanamid was discovered in 1895 by Caro and Franke when they  were trying to work out a new process for making cyanide to use in  extracting gold. It looks like stone and, under the name of  lime-nitrogen, or Kalkstickstoff, or nitrolim, is sold as a fertilizer.  If it is desired to get ammonia, it is treated with superheated steam.  The reaction produces heat and pressure, so it is necessary to carry it  on in stout autoclaves or enclosed kettles. The cyanamid is completely  and quickly converted into pure ammonia and calcium carbonate, which is  the same as the limestone from which carbide was made. The reaction is:          CaCN_{2}  +  3H_{2}O   -->   CaCO_{3}  +  2NH_{3}    calcium cyanamid  water   calcium carbonate  ammonia    Another electrical furnace method, the Serpek process, uses aluminum  instead of calcium for the fixation of nitrogen. Bauxite, or impure  aluminum oxide, the ordinary mineral used in the manufacture of metallic  aluminum, is mixed with coal and heated in a revolving electrical  furnace through which nitrogen is passing. The equation is:      Al_{2}O_{3} + 3C + N_{2}   -->   2AlN  +  3CO    aluminum   carbon nitrogen    aluminum  carbon     oxide                         nitride   monoxide    Then the aluminum nitride is treated with steam under pressure, which  produces ammonia and gives back the original aluminum oxide, but in a  purer form than the mineral from which was made      2AlN  +  3H_{2}O --> 2NH_{3} + Al_{2}O_{3}    Aluminum  water     ammonia   aluminum oxide     nitride    The Serpek process is employed to some extent in France in connection  with the aluminum industry. These are the principal processes for the  fixation of nitrogen now in use, but they by no means exhaust the  possibilities. For instance, Professor John C. Bucher, of Brown  University, created a sensation in 1917 by announcing a new process  which he had worked out with admirable completeness and which has some  very attractive features. It needs no electric power or high pressure  retorts or liquid air apparatus. He simply fills a twenty-foot tube with  briquets made out of soda ash, iron and coke and passes producer gas  through the heated tube. Producer gas contains nitrogen since it is made  by passing air over hot coal. The reaction is:      2Na_{2}CO_{3} + 4C + N_{2}   =   2NaCN + 3CO    sodium       carbon  nitrogen    sodium   carbon     carbonate                        cyanide   monoxide    The iron here acts as the catalyst and converts two harmless substances,  sodium carbonate, which is common washing soda, and carbon, into two of  the most deadly compounds known to man, cyanide and carbon monoxide,  which is what kills you when you blow out the gas. Sodium cyanide is a  salt of hydrocyanic acid, which for, some curious reason is called  \"Prussic acid.\" It is so violent a poison that, as the freshman said in  a chemistry recitation, \"a single drop of it placed on the tongue of a  dog will kill a man.\"    But sodium cyanide is not only useful in itself, for the extraction of  gold and cleaning of silver, but can be converted into ammonia, and a  variety of other compounds such as urea and oxamid, which are good  fertilizers; sodium ferrocyanide, that makes Prussian blue; and oxalic  acid used in dyeing. Professor Bucher claimed that his furnace could be  set up in a day at a cost of less than $100 and could turn out 150  pounds of sodium cyanide in twenty-four hours. This process was placed  freely at the disposal of the United States Government for the war and a  10-ton plant was built at Saltville, Va., by the Ordnance Department.  But the armistice put a stop to its operations and left the future of  the process undetermined.

BURNING AIR IN A BIRKELAND-EYDE FURNACE AT THE DU PONT PLANT    An electric arc consuming about 4000 horse-power of energy is passing  between the U-shaped electrodes which are made of copper tube cooled by  an internal current of water. On the sides of the chamber are seen the  openings through which the air passes impinging directly on both sides  of the surface of the disk of flame. This flame is approximately seven  feet in diameter and appears to be continuous although an alternating  current of fifty cycles a second is used. The electric arc is spread  into this disk flame by the repellent power of an electro-magnet the  pointed pole of which is seen at bottom of the picture. Under this  intense heat a part of the nitrogen and oxygen of the air combine to  form oxides of nitrogen which when dissolved in water form the nitric  acid used in explosives.]    [Illustration: Courtesy of E.I. du Pont de Nemours Co.    A BATTERY OF BIRKELAND-EYDE FURNACES FOR THE FIXATION OF NITROGEN AT THE  DU PONT PLANT]    We might have expected that the fixation of nitrogen by passing an  electrical spark through hot air would have been an American invention,  since it was Franklin who snatched the lightning from the heavens as  well as the scepter from the tyrant and since our output of hot air is  unequaled by any other nation. But little attention was paid to the  nitrogen problem until 1916 when it became evident that we should soon  be drawn into a war \"with a first class power.\" On June 3, 1916,  Congress placed $20,000,000 at the disposal of the president for  investigation of \"the best, cheapest and most available means for the  production of nitrate and other products for munitions of war and useful  in the manufacture of fertilizers and other useful products by water  power or any other power.\" But by the time war was declared on April 6,  1917, no definite program had been approved and by the time the  armistice was signed on November 11, 1918, no plants were in active  operation. But five plants had been started and two of them were nearly  ready to begin work when they were closed by the ending of the war.  United States Nitrate Plant No. 1 was located at Sheffield, Alabama, and  was designed for the production of ammonia by \"direct action\" from  nitrogen and hydrogen according to the plans of the American Chemical  Company. Its capacity was calculated at 60,000 pounds of anhydrous  ammonia a day, half of which was to be oxidized to nitric acid. Plant  No. 2 was erected at Muscle Shoals, Alabama, to use the process of the  American Cyanamid Company. This was contracted to produce 110,000 tons  of ammonium nitrate a year and later two other cyanamid plants of half  that capacity were started at Toledo and Ancor, Ohio.    At Muscle Shoals a mushroom city of 20,000 sprang up on an Alabama  cotton field in six months. The raw material, air, was as abundant there  as anywhere and the power, water, could be obtained from the Government  hydro-electric plant on the Tennessee River, but this was not available  during the war, so steam was employed instead. The heat of the coal was  used to cool the air down to the liquefying point. The principle of this  process is simple. Everybody knows that heat expands and cold contracts,  but not everybody has realized the converse of this rule, that expansion  cools and compression heats. If air is forced into smaller space, as in  a tire pump, it heats up and if allowed to expand to ordinary pressure  it cools off again. But if the air while compressed is cooled and then  allowed to expand it must get still colder and the process can go on  till it becomes cold enough to congeal. That is, by expanding a great  deal of air, a little of it can be reduced to the liquefying point. At  Muscle Shoals the plant for liquefying air, in order to get the nitrogen  out of it, consisted of two dozen towers each capable of producing 1765  cubic feet of pure nitrogen per hour. The air was drawn in through two  pipes, a yard across, and passed through scrubbing towers to remove  impurities. The air was then compressed to 600 pounds per square inch.  Nine tenths of the air was permitted to expand to 50 pounds and this  expansion cooled down the other tenth, still under high pressure, to the  liquefying point. Rectifying towers 24 feet high were stacked with trays  of liquid air from which the nitrogen was continually bubbling off since  its boiling point is twelve degrees centigrade lower than that of  oxygen. Pure nitrogen gas collected at the top of the tower and the  residual liquid air, now about half oxygen, was allowed to escape at the  bottom.    The nitrogen was then run through pipes into the lime-nitrogen ovens.  There were 1536 of these about four feet square and each holding 1600  pounds of pulverized calcium carbide. This is at first heated by an  electrical current to start the reaction which afterwards produces  enough heat to keep it going. As the stream of nitrogen gas passes over  the finely divided carbide it is absorbed to form calcium cyanamid as  described on a previous page. This product is cooled, powdered and wet  to destroy any quicklime or carbide left unchanged. Then it is charged  into autoclaves and steam at high temperature and pressure is admitted.  The steam acting on the cyanamid sets free ammonia gas which is carried  to towers down which cold water is sprayed, giving the ammonia water,  familiar to the kitchen and the bathroom.    But since nitric acid rather than ammonia was needed for munitions, the  oxygen of the air had to be called into play. This process, as already  explained, is carried on by aid of a catalyzer, in this case platinum  wire. At Muscle Shoals there were 696 of these catalyzer boxes. The  ammonia gas, mixed with air to provide the necessary oxygen, was  admitted at the top and passed down through a sheet of platinum gauze of  80 mesh to the inch, heated to incandescence by electricity. In contact  with this the ammonia is converted"]]]
