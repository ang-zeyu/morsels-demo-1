He had a fine poetic gift and wrote odes to sing the praises of Him Whom  the world has wronged and rejected. Among them is a poem written while he  was a prisoner in the barracks at Akka, the chief couplet of which reads:    A hundred hearts Thy curling locks ensnare,  And it rains hearts when Thou dost toss Thy hair.    That free and independent soul discovered, in Ba_gh_dad, a trace of the  untraceable Beloved. He witnessed the dawning of the Daystar above the  horizon of 'Iraq, and received the bounty of that sunrise. He came under  the spell of Baha'u'llah, and was enraptured by that tender Companion.  Although he was a quiet man, one who held his peace, his very limbs were  like so many tongues crying out their message. When the retinue of  Baha'u'llah was about to leave Ba_gh_dad he implored permission to go  along as a groom. All day, he walked beside the convoy, and when night  came he would attend to the horses. He worked with all his heart. Only  after midnight would he seek his bed and lie down to rest; the bed,  however, was his mantle, and the pillow a sun-dried brick.    As he journeyed, filled with yearning love, he would sing poems. He  greatly pleased the friends. In him the name(23) bespoke the man: he was  pure candor and truth; he was love itself; he was chaste of heart, and  enamored of Baha'u'llah. In his high station, that of groom, he reigned  like a king; indeed he gloried over the sovereigns of the earth. He was  assiduous in attendance upon Baha'u'llah; in all things, upright and true.    The convoy of the lovers went on; it reached Constantinople; it passed to  Adrianople, and finally to the Akka prison. Sidq-'Ali was present  throughout, faithfully serving its Commander.    While in the barracks, Baha'u'llah set apart a special night and He  dedicated it to Darvi_sh_ Sidq-'Ali. He wrote that every year on that  night the dervishes should bedeck a meeting place, which should be in a  flower garden, and gather there to make mention of God. He went on to say  that \"dervish\" does not denote those persons who wander about, spending  their nights and days in fighting and folly; rather, He said, the term  designates those who are completely severed from all but God, who cleave  to His laws, are firm in His Faith, loyal to His Covenant, and constant in  worship. It is not a name for those who, as the Persians say, tramp about  like vagrants, are confused, unsettled in mind, a burden to others, and of  all mankind the most coarse and rude.    This eminent dervish spent his whole life-span under the sheltering favor  of God. He was completely detached from worldly things. He was attentive  in service, and waited upon the believers with all his heart. He was a  servant to all of them, and faithful at the Holy Threshold.    Then came that hour when, not far from his Lord, he stripped off the cloak  of life, and to physical eyes passed into the shadows, but to the mind's  eye betook himself to what is plain as day; and he was seated there on a  throne of lasting glory. He escaped from the prison of this world, and  pitched his tent in a wide and spacious land. May God ever keep him close  and bless him in that mystic realm with perpetual reunion and the beatific  vision; may he be wrapped in tiers of light. Upon him be the glory of God,  the All-Glorious. His grave is in Akka.            AQA MIRZA MAHMUD AND AQA RIDA      These two blessed souls, Mirza Mahmud of Ka_sh_an and Aqa Rida of  _Sh_iraz, were like two lamps lit with God's love from the oil of His  knowledge. Encompassed by Divine bestowals from childhood on, they  succeeded in rendering every kind of service for fifty-five years. Their  services were countless, beyond recording.    When the retinue of Baha'u'llah left Ba_gh_dad for Constantinople, He was  accompanied by a great crowd of people. Along the way, they met with  famine conditions. These two souls strode along on foot, ahead of the  howdah in which Baha'u'llah was riding, and covered a distance of seven or  eight farsa_kh_s every day. Wayworn and faint, they would reach the  halting-place; and yet, weary as they were, they would immediately set  about preparing and cooking the food, and seeing to the comfort of the  believers. The efforts they made were truly more than flesh can bear.  There were times when they had not more than two or three hours sleep out  of the twenty-four; because, once the friends had eaten their meal, these  two would be busy collecting and washing up the dishes and cooking  utensils; this would take them till midnight, and only then would they  rest. At daybreak they would rise, pack everything, and set out again, in  front of the howdah of Baha'u'llah. See what a vital service they were  able to render, and for what bounty they were singled out: from the start  of the journey, at Ba_gh_dad, to the arrival in Constantinople, they  walked close beside Baha'u'llah; they made every one of the friends happy;  they brought rest and comfort to all; they prepared whatever anyone asked.    Aqa Rida and Mirza Mahmud were the very essence of God's love, utterly  detached from all but God. In all that time no one ever heard either of  them raise his voice. They never hurt nor offended anyone. They were  trustworthy, loyal, true. Baha'u'llah showered blessings upon them. They  were continually entering His presence and He would be expressing His  satisfaction with them.    Mirza Mahmud was a youth when he arrived in Ba_gh_dad from Ka_sh_an. Aqa  Rida became a believer in Ba_gh_dad. The spiritual condition of the two  was indescribable. There was in Ba_gh_dad a company of seven leading  believers who lived in a single, small room, because they were destitute.  They could hardly keep body and soul together, but they were so spiritual,  so blissful, that they thought themselves in Heaven. Sometimes they would  chant prayers all night long, until the day broke. Days, they would go out  to work, and by nightfall one would have earned ten paras, another perhaps  twenty paras, others forty or fifty. These sums would be spent for the  evening meal. On a certain day one of them made twenty paras, while the  rest had nothing at all. The one with the money bought some dates, and  shared them with the others; that was dinner, for seven people. They were  perfectly content with their frugal life, supremely happy.    These two honored men devoted their days to all that is best in human  life: they had seeing eyes; they were mindful and aware; they had hearing  ears, and were fair of speech. Their sole desire was to please  Baha'u'llah. To them, nothing was a bounty at all, except service at His  Holy Threshold. After the time of the Supreme Affliction, they were  consumed with sorrow, like candles flickering away; they longed for death,  and stayed firm in the Covenant and labored hard and well to spread that  Daystar's Faith. They were close and trusted companions of 'Abdu'l-Baha,  and could be relied on in all things. They were always lowly, humble,  unassuming, evanescent. In all that long period, they never uttered a word  which had to do with self.    And at the last, during the absence of 'Abdu'l-Baha, they took their  flight to the Kingdom of unfading glory. I sorrowed much because I was not  with them when they died. Although absent in body, I was there in my  heart, and mourning over them; but to outward seeming I did not bid them  good-by; this is why I grieve.    Unto them both be salutations and praise; upon them be compassion and  glory. May God give them a home in Paradise, under the Lote-Tree's shade.  May they be immersed in tiers of light, close beside their Lord, the  Mighty, the All-Powerful.            PIDAR-JAN OF QAZVIN      The late Pidar-Jan was among those believers who emigrated to Ba_gh_dad.  He was a godly old man, enamored of the Well-Beloved; in the garden of  Divine love, he was like a rose full-blown. He arrived there, in  Ba_gh_dad, and spent his days and nights communing with God and chanting  prayers; and although he walked the earth, he traveled the heights of  Heaven.    To obey the law of God, he took up a trade, for he had nothing. He would  bundle a few pairs of socks under his arm and peddle them as he wandered  through the streets and bazars, and thieves would rob him of his  merchandise. Finally he was obliged to lay the socks across his  outstretched palms as he went along. But he would get to chanting a  prayer, and one day he was surprised to find that they had stolen the  socks, laid out on his two hands, from before his eyes. His awareness of  this world was clouded, for he journeyed through another. He dwelt in  ecstasy; he was a man drunken, bedazzled.    For some time, that is how he lived in 'Iraq. Almost daily he was admitted  to the presence of Baha'u'llah. His name was 'Abdu'llah but the friends  bestowed on him the title of Pidar-Jan--Father Dear--for he was a loving  father to them all. At last, under the sheltering care of Baha'u'llah, he  took flight to the \"seat of truth, in the presence of the potent  king.\"(24)    May God make fragrant his sepulcher with the outpouring rains of His mercy  and cast upon him the eye of Divine compassion. Salutations be unto him,  and praise.            SHAYKH SADIQ-I-YAZDI      Another of those who emigrated to Ba_gh_dad was _Sh_ay_kh_ Sadiq of Yazd,  a man esteemed, and righteous as his name, Sadiq.(25) He was a towering  palm in the groves of Heaven, a star flaming in the skies of the love of  God.    It was during the 'Iraq period that he hastened to the presence of  Baha'u'llah. His detachment from the things of this world and his  attachment to the life of the spirit are indescribable. He was love  embodied, tenderness personified. Day"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19282"],[0,"The Promised Day Is Come (#7)"],[1,"of which ye  can rightly boast? Is it on your food and your drink that ye pride  yourselves, on the riches ye lay up in your treasuries, on the diversity  and the cost of the ornaments with which ye deck yourselves? If true glory  were to consist in the possession of such perishable things, then the  earth on which ye walk must needs vaunt itself over you, because it  supplieth you, and bestoweth upon you, these very things, by the decree of  the Almighty. In its bowels are contained, according to what God hath  ordained, all that ye possess. From it, as a sign of His mercy, ye derive  your riches. Behold then your state, the thing in which ye glory! Would  that ye could perceive it! Nay! By Him Who holdeth in His grasp the  kingdom of the entire creation! Nowhere doth your true and abiding glory  reside except in your firm adherence unto the precepts of God, your  wholehearted observance of His laws, your resolution to see that they do  not remain unenforced, and to pursue steadfastly the right course....\"    And again in that same Tablet: \"Twenty years have passed, O kings, during  which We have, each day, tasted the agony of a fresh tribulation. No one  of them that were before Us hath endured the things We have endured. Would  that ye could perceive it! They that rose up against Us, have put Us to  death, have shed Our blood, have plundered Our property, and violated Our  honor. Though aware of most of Our afflictions, ye, nevertheless, have  failed to stay the hand of the aggressor. For is it not your clear duty to  restrain the tyranny of the oppressor, and to deal equitably with your  subjects, that your high sense of justice may be fully demonstrated to all  mankind?    \"God hath committed into your hands the reins of the government of the  people, that ye may rule with justice over them, safeguard the rights of  the downtrodden, and punish the wrongdoers. If ye neglect the duty  prescribed unto you by God in His Book, your names shall be numbered with  those of the unjust in His sight. Grievous, indeed, will be your error.  Cleave ye to that which your imaginations have devised, and cast behind  your backs the commandments of God, the Most Exalted, the Inaccessible,  the All-Compelling, the Almighty? Cast away the things ye possess, and  cling to that which God hath bidden you observe. Seek ye His grace, for he  that seeketh it treadeth His straight Path.    \"Consider the state in which We are, and behold ye the ills and troubles  that have tried Us. Neglect Us not, though it be for a moment, and judge  ye between Us and Our enemies with equity. This will, surely, be a  manifest advantage unto you. Thus do We relate to you Our tale, and  recount the things that have befallen Us, that ye might take off Our ills  and ease Our burden. Let him who will, relieve Us from Our trouble; and as  to him that willeth not, my Lord is assuredly the best of Helpers.    \"Warn and acquaint the people, O Servant, with the things We have sent  down unto Thee, and let the fear of no one dismay Thee, and be Thou not of  them that waver. The day is approaching when God will have exalted His  Cause and magnified His testimony in the eyes of all who are in the  heavens and all who are on the earth. Place, in all circumstances, Thy  whole trust in Thy Lord, and fix Thy gaze upon Him, and turn away from all  them that repudiate His truth. Let God, Thy Lord, be Thy sufficing  Succorer and Helper. We have pledged Ourself to secure Thy triumph upon  earth and to exalt Our Cause above all men, though no king be found who  would turn his face towards Thee....\"    In the Kitab-i-Aqdas (The Most Holy Book), that priceless treasury  enshrining for all time the brightest emanations of the mind of  Baha'u'llah, the Charter of His World Order, the chief repository of His  laws, the Harbinger of His Covenant, the Pivotal Work containing some of  His noblest exhortations, weightiest pronouncements, and portentous  prophecies, and revealed during the full tide of His tribulations, at a  time when the rulers of the earth had definitely forsaken Him--in such a  Book we read the following:    \"O kings of the earth! He Who is the sovereign Lord of all is come. The  Kingdom is God's, the omnipotent Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Worship  none but God, and, with radiant hearts, lift up your faces unto your Lord,  the Lord of all names. This is a Revelation to which whatever ye possess  can never be compared, could ye but know it. We see you rejoicing in that  which ye have amassed for others, and shutting out yourselves from the  worlds which naught except My Guarded Tablet can reckon. The treasures ye  have laid up have drawn you far away from your ultimate objective. This  ill beseemeth you, could ye but understand it. Wash your hearts from all  earthly defilements, and hasten to enter the Kingdom of your Lord, the  Creator of earth and heaven, Who caused the world to tremble, and all its  peoples to wail, except them that have renounced all things and clung to  that which the Hidden Tablet hath ordained....\"            THE MOST GREAT LAW REVEALED      And further: \"O kings of the earth! The Most Great Law hath been revealed  in this Spot, this Scene of transcendent splendor. Every hidden thing hath  been brought to light, by virtue of the Will of the Supreme Ordainer, He  Who hath ushered in the Last Hour, through Whom the Moon hath been cleft,  and every irrevocable decree expounded.    \"Ye are but vassals, O kings of the earth! He Who is the King of Kings  hath appeared, arrayed in His most wondrous glory, and is summoning you  unto Himself, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. Take heed lest pride  deter you from recognizing the Source of Revelation; lest the things of  this world shut you out as by a veil from Him Who is the Creator of  heaven. Arise, and serve Him Who is the Desire of all nations, Who hath  created you through a word from Him, and ordained you to be, for all time,  the emblems of His sovereignty.    \"By the righteousness of God! It is not Our wish to lay hands on your  kingdoms. Our mission is to seize and possess the hearts of men. Upon them  the eyes of Baha are fastened. To this testifieth the Kingdom of Names,  could ye but comprehend it. Whoso followeth his Lord, will renounce the  world and all that is therein; how much greater, then, must be the  detachment of Him Who holdeth so august a station! Forsake your palaces,  and haste ye to gain admittance into His Kingdom. This, indeed, will  profit you both in this world and in the next. To this testifieth the Lord  of the realm on high, did ye but know it.    \"How great is the blessedness that awaiteth the king who will arise to aid  My Cause in My Kingdom, who will detach himself from all else but Me! Such  a king is numbered with the companions of the Crimson Ark, the Ark which  God hath prepared for the people of Baha. All must glorify his name, must  reverence his station, and aid him to unlock the cities with the keys of  My Name, the omnipotent Protector of all that inhabit the visible and  invisible kingdoms. Such a king is the very eye of mankind, the luminous  ornament on the brow of creation, the fountainhead of blessings unto the  whole world. Offer up, O people of Baha, your substance, nay your very  lives, for his assistance.\"    And further, this evident arraignment in that same Book: \"We have asked  nothing from you. For the sake of God We, verily, exhort you, and will be  patient as We have been patient in that which hath befallen Us at your  hands, O concourse of kings!\"    Moreover, in His Tablet to Queen Victoria Baha'u'llah thus addresses all  the kings of the earth, summoning them to cleave to the Lesser Peace, as  distinct from that Most Great Peace which those who are fully conscious of  the power of His Revelation and avowedly profess the tenets of His Faith  can alone proclaim and must eventually establish:    \"O kings of the earth! We see you increasing every year your expenditures,  and laying the burden thereof on your subjects. This, verily, is wholly  and grossly unjust. Fear the sighs and tears of this Wronged One, and lay  not excessive burdens on your peoples. Do not rob them to rear palaces for  yourselves; nay rather choose for them that which ye choose for  yourselves. Thus We unfold to your eyes that which profiteth you, if ye  but perceive. Your people are your treasures. Beware lest your rule  violate the commandments of God, and ye deliver your wards to the hands of  the robber. By them ye rule, by their means ye subsist, by their aid ye  conquer. Yet, how disdainfully ye look upon them! How strange, how very  strange!    \"Now that ye have refused the Most Great Peace, hold ye fast unto this,  the Lesser Peace, that haply ye may in some degree better your own  condition and that of your dependents.    \"O rulers of the earth! Be reconciled among yourselves, that ye may need  no more armaments save in a measure to safeguard your territories and  dominions. Beware lest ye disregard the counsel of the All-Knowing, the  Faithful.    \"Be united, O kings of the earth, for thereby will the tempest of discord  be stilled amongst you, and your peoples find rest, if ye be of them that  comprehend. Should anyone among you take up arms against another, rise ye  all against him, for this is naught but manifest justice.\"    To the Christian kings Baha'u'llah, moreover, particularly directs His  words of censure, and, in a language that cannot be mistaken, He discloses  the true character of His Revelation:    \"O kings of Christendom! Heard ye not the saying of Jesus, the Spirit of  God, 'I go away, and come again unto you'? Wherefore, then, did ye fail,  when He did come again unto you in the clouds of heaven, to draw nigh unto  Him, that ye might behold His face, and be of them that attained His  Presence? In another passage He saith: 'When He, the Spirit of Truth, is  come, He will guide you into all truth.' And yet, behold how, when "]]]
