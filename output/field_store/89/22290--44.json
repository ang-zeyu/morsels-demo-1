But the imagination of the people was  really turned wayward and possessed; and no wonder if they who were  poring continually at the clouds saw shapes and figures,  representations and appearances, which had nothing in them but air and  vapor. Here they told us they saw a flaming sword held in a hand, coming  out of a cloud, with a point hanging directly over the city. There they  saw hearses and coffins in the air carrying to be buried. And there  again, heaps of dead bodies lying unburied and the like, just as the  imagination of the poor terrified people furnished them with matter to  work upon.        So hypochondriac fancies represent      Ships, armies, battles in the firmament;      Till steady eyes the exhalations solve,      And all to its first matter, cloud, resolve.    I could fill this account with the strange relations such people give  every day of what they have seen; and every one was so positive of their  having seen what they pretended to see, that there was no contradicting  them, without breach of friendship, or being accounted rude and  unmannerly on the one hand, and profane and impenetrable on the other.  One time before the plague was begun, otherwise than as I have said in  St. Giles's (I think it was in March), seeing a crowd of people in the  street, I joined with them to satisfy my curiosity, and found them all  staring up into the air to see what a woman told them appeared plain to  her, which was an angel clothed in white, with a fiery sword in his  hand, waving it or brandishing it over his head. She described every  part of the figure to the life, showed them the motion and the form, and  the poor people came into it so eagerly and with so much readiness.  \"Yes, I see it all plainly,\" says one: \"there's the sword as plain as  can be.\" Another saw the angel; one saw his very face, and cried out  what a glorious creature he was. One saw one thing, and one another. I  looked as earnestly as the rest, but perhaps not with so much  willingness to be imposed upon; and I said, indeed, that I could see  nothing but a white cloud, bright on one side, by the shining of the sun  upon the other part. The woman endeavored to show it me, but could not  make me confess that I saw it; which, indeed, if I had, I must have  lied. But the woman, turning to me, looked me in the face, and fancied I  laughed, in which her imagination deceived her too, for I really did not  laugh, but was seriously reflecting how the poor people were terrified  by the force of their own imagination. However, she turned to me, called  me profane fellow and a scoffer, told me that it was a time of God's  anger, and dreadful judgments were approaching, and that despisers such  as I should wander and perish.    The people about her seemed disgusted as well as she, and I found there  was no persuading them that I did not laugh at them, and that I should  be rather mobbed by them than be able to undeceive them. So I left them,  and this appearance passed for as real as the blazing star itself.    Another encounter I had in the open day also; and this was in going  through a narrow passage from Petty France[52] into Bishopsgate  churchyard, by a row of almshouses. There are two churchyards to  Bishopsgate Church or Parish. One we go over to pass from the place  called Petty France into Bishopsgate Street, coming out just by the  church door; the other is on the side of the narrow passage where the  almshouses are on the left, and a dwarf wall with a palisade on it on  the right hand, and the city wall on the other side more to the right.    In this narrow passage stands a man looking through the palisades into  the burying place, and as many people as the narrowness of the place  would admit to stop without hindering the passage of others; and he was  talking mighty eagerly to them, and pointing, now to one place, then to  another, and affirming that he saw a ghost walking upon such a  gravestone there. He described the shape, the posture, and the movement  of it so exactly, that it was the greatest amazement to him in the world  that everybody did not see it as well as he. On a sudden he would cry,  \"There it is! Now it comes this way!\" then, \"'Tis turned back!\" till at  length he persuaded the people into so firm a belief of it, that one  fancied he saw it; and thus he came every day, making a strange hubbub,  considering it was so narrow a passage, till Bishopsgate clock struck  eleven; and then the ghost would seem to start, and, as if he were  called away, disappeared on a sudden.    I looked earnestly every way, and at the very moment that this man  directed, but could not see the least appearance of anything. But so  positive was this poor man that he gave them vapors[53] in abundance,  and sent them away trembling and frightened, till at length few people  that knew of it cared to go through that passage, and hardly anybody by  night on any account whatever.    This ghost, as the poor man affirmed, made signs to the houses and to  the ground and to the people, plainly intimating (or else they so  understanding it) that abundance of people should come to be buried in  that churchyard, as indeed happened. But then he saw such aspects I must  acknowledge I never believed, nor could I see anything of it myself,  though I looked most earnestly to see it if possible.    Some endeavors were used to suppress the printing of such books as  terrified the people, and to frighten the dispersers of them, some of  whom were taken up, but nothing done in it, as I am informed; the  government being unwilling to exasperate the people, who were, as I may  say, all out of their wits already.    Neither can I acquit those ministers that in their sermons rather sunk  than lifted up the hearts of their hearers. Many of them, I doubt not,  did it for the strengthening the resolution of the people, and  especially for quickening them to repentance; but it certainly answered  not their end, at least not in proportion to the injury it did another  way.    One mischief always introduces another. These terrors and apprehensions  of the people led them to a thousand weak, foolish, and wicked things,  which they wanted not a sort of people really wicked to encourage them  to; and this was running about to fortune tellers, cunning men,[54] and  astrologers, to know their fortunes, or, as it is vulgarly expressed, to  have their fortunes told them, their nativities[55] calculated, and the  like. And this folly presently made the town swarm with a wicked  generation of pretenders to magic, to the \"black art,\" as they called  it, and I know not what, nay, to a thousand worse dealings with the  devil than they were really guilty of. And this trade grew so open and  so generally practiced, that it became common to have signs and  inscriptions set up at doors, \"Here lives a fortune teller,\" \"Here lives  an astrologer,\" \"Here you may have your nativity calculated,\" and the  like; and Friar Bacon's brazen head,[56] which was the usual sign of  these people's dwellings, was to be seen almost in every street, or else  the sign of Mother Shipton,[57] or of Merlin's[58] head, and the like.    With what blind, absurd, and ridiculous stuff these oracles of the devil  pleased and satisfied the people, I really know not; but certain it is,  that innumerable attendants crowded about their doors every day: and if  but a grave fellow in a velvet jacket, a band,[59] and a black cloak,  which was the habit those quack conjurers generally went in, was but  seen in the streets, the people would follow them[60] in crowds, and ask  them[60] questions as they went along.    The case of poor servants was very dismal, as I shall have occasion to  mention again by and by; for it was apparent a prodigious number of them  would be turned away. And it was so, and of them abundance perished,  and particularly those whom these false prophets flattered with hopes  that they should be kept in their services, and carried with their  masters and mistresses into the country; and had not public charity  provided for these poor creatures, whose number was exceeding great (and  in all cases of this nature must be so), they would have been in the  worst condition of any people in the city.    These things agitated the minds of the common people for many months  while the first apprehensions were upon them, and while the plague was  not, as I may say, yet broken out. But I must also not forget that the  more serious part of the inhabitants behaved after another manner. The  government encouraged their devotion, and appointed public prayers, and  days of fasting and humiliation, to make public confession of sin, and  implore the mercy of God to avert the dreadful judgment which hangs over  their heads; and it is not to be expressed with what alacrity the people  of all persuasions embraced the occasion, how they flocked to the  churches and meetings, and they were all so thronged that there was  often no coming near, even to the very doors of the largest churches.  Also there were daily prayers appointed morning and evening at several  churches, and days of private praying at other places, at all which the  people attended, I say, with an uncommon devotion. Several private  families, also, as well of one opinion as another, kept family fasts, to  which they admitted their near relations only; so that, in a word, those  people who were really serious and religious applied themselves in a  truly Christian manner to the proper work of repentance and humiliation,  as a Christian people ought to do.    Again, the public showed that they would bear their share in these  things. The very court, which was then gay and luxurious, put on a face  of just concern for the public danger. All the plays and interludes[61]  which, after the manner of the French court,[62] had been set up and  began to increase among us, were forbid to act;[63] the gaming tables,  public dancing rooms, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1723"],[0,"Cow-Country (#7)"],[1,"would be up and on his horse in the clear starlight before dawn,  with a cup of coffee swallowed to hearten him for the chilly ride after  the remuda. Even with the warmth of the coffee his teeth would chatter  just at first, and he would ride with his thin shoulders lifted and a  hand in a pocket. He could not sing or whistle to keep himself company.  He must ride in silence until he had counted every dark, moving shape  and knew that the herd was complete, then ease them quietly to camp.    On the fourth morning he rode anxiously up the valley, fearing that the  horses had been stolen in the night, yet hoping they had merely strayed  up the creek to find fresh pastures. A light breeze that carried the  keen edge of frost made his nose tingle. His horse trotted steadily  forward, as keen on the trail as Buddy himself; keener, for he would be  sure to give warning of danger. So they rounded a bend in the creek and  came upon the scattered fringe of the remuda cropping steadily at the  meadow grass there.    Bud circled them, glancing now and then at the ridge beyond the valley.  It seemed somehow unnatural--lower, with the stars showing along its  wooded crest in a row, as if there were no peaks. Then quite suddenly he  knew that the ridge was the same, and that the stars he saw were little,  breakfast camp-fires. His heart gave a jump when he realized how many  little fires there were, and knew that the dance was over. The Indians  had left the reservation and had crossed the ridge yesterday, and had  camped there to wait for the dawn.    While he gathered his horses together he guessed how old Colorou had  planned to catch the Tomahawk riders when they left camp and scattered,  two by two, on \"Circle.\" He had held his band well out of sight and  sound of the Big Creek cabin, and if the horses had not strayed up the  creek in the night he would have caught the white men off their guard.    Buddy looked often over his shoulder while he drove the horses down the  creek. It seemed stranger than luck, that he had been compelled to ride  so far on this particular morning; as if mother's steadfast faith in  prayer and the guardianship of angels was justified by actual facts.  Still, Buddy was too hard-headed to assume easily that angels had driven  the horses up the creek so that he would have to ride up there and  discover the Indian fires. If angels could do that, why hadn't they  stopped Colorou from going on the warpath? It would have been simpler,  in Buddy's opinion.    He did not mention the angel problem to his father, however. Bob Birnie  was eating breakfast with his men when Buddy rode up to the cabin and  told the news. The boys did not say anything much, but they may have  taken bigger bites by way of filling their stomachs in less time than  usual.    \"I'll go see for myself,\" said Bob Birnie. \"You boys saddle up and  be ready to start. If it's Indians, we'll head for Laramie and drive  everything before us as we go. But the lad may be wrong.\" He took the  reins from Buddy, mounted, and rode away, his booted feet hanging far  below Buddy's short stirrups.    Speedily he was back, and the scowl on his face told plainly enough that  Buddy had not been mistaken.    \"They're coming off the ridge already,\" he announced grimly. \"I heard  their horses among the rocks up there. They think to come down on us at  sunrise. There'll be too many for us to hold off, I'm thinking. Get ye a  fresh horse, Buddy, and drive the horses down the creek fast as ye can.\"    Buddy uncoiled his rope and ran with his mouth full to do as he was  told. He did not think he was scared, exactly, but he made three throws  to get the horse he wanted, blaming the poor light for his ill luck;  and then found himself in possession of a tall, uneasy brown that Dick  Grimes had broken and sometimes rode. Buddy would have turned him loose  and caught another, but the horses had sensed the suppressed excitement  of the men and were circling and snorting in the half light of dawn; so  Buddy led out the brown, pulled the saddle from the sweaty horse that  had twice made the trip up the creek, and heaved it hastily on the  brown's back. Dick Grimes called to him, to know if he wanted any help,  and Buddy yelled, \"No!\"    \"Here they come--damn 'em--turn the bunch loose and ride!\" called Bob  Birnie as a shrill, yelling war-whoop, like the yapping of many coyotes,  sounded from the cottonwoods that bordered the creek. \"Yuh all right,  Buddy?\"    \"Yeah--I'm a-comin',\" shrilled Buddy, hastily looping the latigo. Just  then the sharp staccato of rifle-shots mingled with the whooping of the  Indians. Buddy was reaching for the saddle horn when the brown horse  ducked and jerked loose. Before Buddy realized what was happening the  brown horse, the herd and all the riders were pounding away down the  valley, the men firing back at the cottonwoods.    In the dust and clamor of their departure Buddy stood perfectly still  for a minute, trying to grasp the full significance of his calamity.  Step-and-a-Half had packed hastily and departed ahead of them all. His  father and the cowboys were watching the cottonwood grove many rods to  Buddy's right and well in the background, and they would not glance his  way. Even if they did they would not see him, and if they saw him it  would be madness to ride back--though there was not a man among them who  would not have wheeled in his tracks and returned for Buddy in the very  face of Colorou and his band.    From the cottonwoods came the pound of galloping hoofs. \"Angels  NOTHING!\" Cried Buddy in deep disgust and scuttled for the cabin.    The cabin, he knew as he ran, was just then the worst place in the  world for a boy who wanted very much to go on living. Through its gaping  doorway he saw a few odds and ends of food lying on the table, but he  dared not stop long enough to get them. The Indians were thundering down  to the corral, and as he rounded the cabin's corner he glanced back  and saw the foremost riders whipping their horses on the trail of the  fleeing white men. But some, he knew, would stop. Even the prospect of  fresh scalps could not hold the greedy ones from prowling around a white  man's dwelling place. There might be tobacco or whiskey left behind,  or something with color or a shine to it. Buddy knew well the ways of  Indians.    He made for the creek, thinking at first to hide somewhere in the brush  along the bank. Then, fearing the brightening light of day and the wide  space he must cross to reach the first fringe of brush, he stopped at a  dugout cellar that had been built into the creek bank above high-water  mark. There was a pole-and-dirt roof, and because the dirt sifted down  between the poles whenever the wind blew--which was always--the place  had been crudely sealed inside with split poles overlapping one another.  The ceiling was more or less flat; the roof had a slight slope. In the  middle of the tiny attic thus formed Buddy managed to worm his body  through a hole in the gable next to the creek.    He wriggled back to the end next the cabin and lay there very flat and  very quiet, peeping out through a half-inch crack, too wise in the ways  of silence to hold his breath until he must heave a sigh to relieve  his lungs. It was hard to breathe naturally and easily after that swift  dash, but somehow he did it. An Indian had swerved and ridden behind the  cabin, and was leaning and peering in all directions to see if anyone  had remained. Perhaps he suspected an ambush; Buddy was absolutely  certain that the fellow was looking for him, personally, and that he had  seen, Buddy run toward the creek.    It was not a pleasant thought, and the fact that he knew that buck  Indian by name, and had once traded him a jackknife for a beautifully  tanned wolf skin for his mother, did not make it pleasanter.  Hides-the-face would not let past friendliness stand in the way of a  killing.    Presently Hides-the-face dismounted and tied his horse to a corner log  of the cabin, and went inside with the others to see what he could find  that could be eaten or carried off. Buddy saw fresh smoke issue from the  stone chimney, and guessed that Step-and-a-Half had left something that  could be cooked. It became evident, in the course of an hour or so, that  his presence was absolutely unsuspected, and Buddy began to watch them  more composedly, silently promising especial forms of punishment to this  one and that one whom he knew. Most of them had been to the ranch many  times, and he could have called to a dozen of them by name. They had sat  in his father's cabin or stood immobile just within the door, and had  listened while his mother played and sang for them. She had fed them  cakes--Buddy remembered the good things which mother had given these  despicable ones who were looting and gobbling and destroying like a  drove of hogs turned loose in a garden, and the thought of her wasted  kindness turned him sick with rage. Mother had believed in their  friendliness. Buddy wished that mother could see them setting fire  to the low, log stable and the corral, and swarming in and out of the  cabin.    Painted for war they were, with red stripes across their foreheads,  ribs outlined in red which, when they loosened their blankets as the  sun warmed them, gave them a fantastic likeness to the skeletons Buddy  wished they were; red stripes on their arms, the number showing their  rank in the tribe; open-seated, buckskin breeches to their knees where  they met the tightly wrapped leggings; moccasins laced snugly at the  ankle--they were picturesque enough to any eyes but Buddy's. He saw the  ghoulish greed in their eyes, heard it in their voices when they shouted  to one another; and he hated them even more than he feared them.    Much that they said he understood. They were cursing the Tomahawk  outfit, chiefly because the men had not waited there to be surprised and  killed. They cursed his"]]]
