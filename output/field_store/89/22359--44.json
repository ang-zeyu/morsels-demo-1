Fires. Cooking.  Safety and Protection. Sanitation. Camp Spirit.=      =Information=    Whether your camp is to be for one day, one week, or a longer period of  time, the first question to be decided is: \"Where shall we go?\" If you  know of no suitable spot, inquire of friends, and even if they have not  personally enjoyed the delights of camping and sleeping in the open, one  or more of them will probably know of some acquaintance who will be glad  to give the information. Write to the various newspapers, magazines,  railroads, and outdoor societies for suggestions. The Geological Survey  of the United States at Washington, D. C., will furnish maps giving  location and extent of forests and water-ways, also location and  character of roads; you can obtain the maps for almost any part of every  State. Most public automobile houses supply maps of any desired region.  Send letters of inquiry to these sources of information, and in this way  you will probably learn of many \"just the right place\" localities.  Select a number of desirable addresses, investigate them, and make your  own choice of location, remembering that the first three essentials for  a camp are good ground, water, and wood; the rest is easy, for these  three form the foundation for camping.      =Location=    Wherever you go, choose a dry spot, preferably in an open space near  wooded land. Avoid hollows where the water will run into your shelters  in wet weather; let your camp be so located that in case of rain the  water will drain down away from it. Remember this or you may find your  camp afloat upon a temporary lake or swamp should a storm arise.      =Water=    Pure drinking water you _must_ have, it is of _vital_ importance, so be  sure to pitch your camp within near walking distance of a good spring, a  securely covered well, or other supply of pure water.    Henry David Thoreau's method of obtaining clear water from a pond whose  surface was covered with leaves, etc., was to push his pail, without  tipping it in the least, straight down under the water until the top  edge was below the surface several inches, then quickly lift it out; in  doing this the overflow would carry off all leaves and twigs, leaving  the remaining water in the pail clear and good. But you must first be  sure that the pond contains pure water under the floating debris.    Always be cautious about drinking water from rivers, streams, ponds, and  lakes though they may appear ever so clear and tempting, for the purity  is by no means assured, and to drink from these sources may cause  serious illness. Unless you are absolutely sure that water is free from  impurities, _boil it_; then it will be safe to use for drinking and  cooking.    Next in importance to good water is good fire-wood and woodsy material  for shelters and beds. Bear this in mind when deciding upon the site for  your camp.      =Companions=    Because your companions can make or mar the happiness in camp, it is  safer to have in your party only those girls who will take kindly to the  camp spirit of friendly helpfulness, those always ready to laugh and  treat discomforts as jokes. This means that though fun-loving and full  of buoyancy and life, each girl will willingly do her part and assume  her share of responsibilities.      =Safeguarding=    You should also count among your companions two or more camp  directors--possibly mothers of the girls, teachers, or older friends of  whom the parents approve--who will enter heartily into all phases of  outdoor life and while really being one with you in sport and work, will  at the same time keep careful oversight and assure protection.    Avoid localities where there is a possibility of tramps or undesirable  characters of any description, and do not wander from camp alone or  unaccompanied by one of the directors. If your camp is in the forest it  will be the part of wisdom to secure also a reliable guide who knows the  forest ways.      =The Start=    The day before you leave for your camping-ground, have everything in  readiness that there may be no delay when it is time to go. Be prompt,  for you want to play fair and not keep the other girls waiting, causing  them to lose valuable time.    The stimulating exhilaration which comes with trailing through the  forests to camp, the keen delight of adventure, the charm of the  wilderness, the freedom and wonder of living in the woods, all make for  the health and happiness of the girl camper, and once experienced, ever  after with the advent of spring comes the call of the untrammelled life  in the big outdoors.      =The One-Day Camp=    Even a one-day camp fills the hours with more genuine lasting enjoyment  than girls can find in other ways; there is a charm about it which  clings in your memory, making a joy, later, of the mere thought and  telling of the event.    That every moment of the day may be filled full of enjoyment for all,  have a good programme, some definite, well-thought-out plan of  activities and sports previously prepared, and if possible let every  girl know beforehand just what she is to do when all arrive at camp.    With an older person in charge, the party could be divided, according to  its size, into different groups, and as soon as the grounds are reached  the groups should begin the fun of preparing for the camp dinner.    If the party consists of eight, two can gather fire-wood, two build the  fireplace, two unpack the outfits, placing the provisions and cooking  utensils in order conveniently near the fire, and two can bring the  drinking water and cooking water.    Provisions and cooking utensils should be divided into as many packs as  there are campers, and every camper carry a pack. Count in the outfit  for each one a tin cup, preferably with open handle for wearing over  belt.    In the one-day camp very few cooking utensils are needed; they may  consist of two tin pails, one for drinking water, the other for boiling  water, one coffee-pot for cocoa, one frying-pan for flapjacks or eggs,  one large kitchen knife for general use, and one large spoon for  stirring batter and cocoa.      =Camp Dinner=    Counting on a keen outdoor appetite for wholesome substantials, the  provision list includes only plain fare, such as: Lamb chops, or thinly  sliced bacon packed in oil-paper. Dry cocoa to which sugar has been  added, carried in can or stout paper bag. One can of condensed milk,  unsweetened, to be diluted with water according to directions on can.  Butter in baking-powder can. Dry flour mixed with salt and baking-powder  in required proportions for flapjacks, packed in strong paper bag and  carried in one of the tin pails. Bread in loaf wrapped in wax-paper.  Potatoes washed and dried ready to cook, packed in paper bag or carried  in second tin pail. Pepper and salt each sealed in separate marked  envelopes; when needed, perforate paper with big pin and use envelopes  as shakers. One egg for batter, buried in the flour to prevent breaking,  and one small can of creamy maple sugar, soft enough to spread on hot  cakes, or a can of ordinary maple syrup.      =The Clean-Up=    While resting after dinner is the time for story-telling; then, before  taking part in sports of any kind, every particle of debris, even small  bits of egg-shell and paper, should be gathered up and burned until not  a vestige remains. To be \"good sports,\" thought must be taken for the  next comers and the camping-ground left in perfect order, absolutely  free from litter or debris of any kind.    When breaking camp be _sure_ to soak the fire with water again and  again. It is criminal to leave any coals or even a spark of the fire  smouldering.    Be _positive_ that the _fire is out_.    [Illustration: A permanent camp.]      =Shelters and Tents. Lean-To=    For a fixed camp of longer or shorter duration your home will be under  the shelter of boughs, logs, or canvas. The home of green boughs is  considered by many the ideal of camp shelters. This you can make for  yourself. It is a simple little two-sided, slanting roof and back and  open-front shed, made of the material of the woods and generally known  as a lean-to, sometimes as Baker tent when of canvas.    There are three ways of erecting the front framework.    The first is to find two trees standing about seven feet apart with  convenient branches down low enough to support the horizontal top cross  pole when laid in the crotches. Lacking the proper trees, the second  method is to get two strong, straight, forked poles of green wood and  drive them down into the ground deep enough to make them stand firm and  upright by themselves the required distance apart. The third way is to  reinforce the uprights by shorter forked stakes driven firmly into the  ground and braced against the uprights, but this is not often necessary.    Having your uprights in place, extending above ground five feet or more,  lay a top pole across, fitting its ends into the forked tops of the  uprights. Against this top pole rest five or six slender poles at  regular distances apart, one end of each against the top pole and the  other end on the ground slanting outward and backward sufficiently to  give a good slope and allow sleeping space beneath. At right angles to  the slanting poles, lay across them other poles, using the natural pegs  or stumps left on the slanting poles by lopped-off branches, as braces  to hold the cross poles in place (Fig. 18).    [Illustration: 18    21 19    20    Outdoor shelters.]    When building the frame be sure to place the slanting poles so that  the little stumps left on them will turn _up_ and not down, that they  may hold the cross poles. Try to have spaces between cross poles as  regular as possible. A log may be rolled up against the ground ends of  the slanting poles to prevent their slipping, though this is rarely  necessary,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18544"],[0,"Narrative of a Mission to Central Africa Performed in the Years 1850-51, Volume (#7)"],[1,"from a distant village, with the express  object of procuring from the Taleb (Overweg) a medicine to produce  abortion: she says she has been gadding, \"barra\" (out of her mother's  house), and is frightened lest she should get a good beating. On  Overweg's refusing to give her any such medicine she burst out into a  pathetic lamentation, and talked loudly of what her parent would do to  her. Young ladies often think of their mothers a little too late under  these circumstances.    A slave of the Sultan of Aghadez arrived this morning, in six days from  the capital, to inquire after the health of En-Noor. He brings no  particular news, but says he saw Barth at Aghadez.    \"Man is to man the surest, deadliest foe,\" has been quoted from the poet  as most applicable to the moral and social state of Africa. It may truly  be said to be our case, for hitherto we have suffered little in this  town except from men. Looking also around us, the people suffer less  from the arid country which they inhabit than from the violence which  they inflict one upon another.    I learned from Yusuf yesterday evening, that for every dollar I take  from the Sfaxee, if I pay in Mourzuk, I must give two. I was greatly  afflicted at this positive declaration, but scarcely believe it; if it,  however, prove to be the case, I must by all means find money in Soudan.  It will be a hard fight, indeed, to keep down the expenses of this  expedition; however, every effort must be employed to effect this  desirable object.    Maradee, I learn, is three days west from Tesaoua; and this latter  place is two from Zinder. There is another village, called Gazawa, one  day south of Tesaoua. The inhabitants of these places are half  Mahommedans and half pagans; the latter do not offer human sacrifices;  their religious rites consist principally in worshipping trees, to which  they sacrifice at certain seasons. The Fellatahs are always at war with  the people of Maradee, but Gouber is at peace with Sakkatou. In  Maradee there is one large stone-and-mud house for the Sultan; all  the rest of the houses are bell-shaped huts. The place has a numerous  population. Tesaoua is also independent and self-governed, as are most  of the places hereabouts.    I had a visit from two itinerant schoolmasters, natives of Bornou. From  these I learned that there does exist a little education amongst the  Kailouees. There is a village near called Amurgeen, three hours from  Tintalous, where children are sent from all the places around, so that  it forms a species of college or university. It is to this college that  En-Noor sends his sons and grandsons. These itinerant pedagogues are  negroes; and it is certainly a curious circumstance that from Central  Africa instruction should migrate northwards. But the Kailouees have  little pride in this respect; although boasting of the name of Tuaricks,  and accounting themselves _white_ people, or allied with the whites,  they do not scruple to receive education from the negroes of Bornou,  whilst certainly it would be very easy to have Kailouee schoolmasters.    I heard from my friend Tibbaou that En-Noor's territory in Tesaoua is  simply a village at some distance from the medeeneh, or city, where  there is a native and independent sultan of some power. His territory in  Damerghou is also a mere village. Nevertheless, the possession of these  places extends the political influence of the Kailouees in Soudan. The  neighbourhood of Damerghou, especially the western side, seems  celebrated for a tribe, or factions of tribes, consisting of bad  Tuaricks. This race is evidently spreading in Soudan; there are great  numbers in Gouber and the countries near.    I purchased from the itinerant pedagogues of Bornou two of their  ink-bottles, which are made of small calabashes. They wrote for me some  specimens of their penmanship, a charm, _fatah_, or first chapter of the  Koran. They wrote and formed their letters sideways, as some lawyers'  clerks do in England.    Dambaba Makersee took the liberty of informing me to-day, as if I did  not know it before, that all the things of us Christians were considered  by the Kailouees generally as common property, and that whoever could  lay hold of any ought to do so without qualm or scruple; but, he added,  when you arrive in Zinder, all will be changed. Let us hope so,  _Inshallah_!    Strings of charms are worn by the men occasionally under the arm, or  suspended over the shoulders, as well as round the neck. The charm or  armlet of the Moors and Tuaricks corresponds with the _Fetish_ of the  ancient Kohlan, people of Soudan, and of the present negro races on the  western coast.    I finished the statistics of the towns and villages of Asben--after all,  a very imperfect affair. Nevertheless, it is the best which I could make  from my materials.    En-Noor paid me a visit in the morning, and stopped gossiping two hours.  From him I learnt that the Fellatah language has no relation to the  Arabic or Tuarick, but is quite a language peculiar in itself. He also  informed us that the Gouberites were still at war with the Fellatahs of  Sakkatou; that they were united with the people of Maradee, ancient  Kohlans like themselves, and that this united force had been lately  gaining their lost ground against the new Muslim powers in Soudan.  En-Noor seems to favour the re-establishment of these people against the  Fellatahs. The latter he naturally hates, on account of their attempts  on the independence of the Kailouees, and their perpetual intrigues at  Aghadez.    With regard to Tesaoua, En-Noor pretends that he founded this city. His  statement is singularly suggestive and picturesque in its simplicity. He  says that he met, on the spot where Tesaoua now stands, a forlorn man,  with only two slaves.    \"What are you doing?\" he said to the man.    \"Nothing,\" the man replied. \"What can I do, naked as I am, with myself  and two slaves?\"    \"Oh!\" rejoined En-Noor; \"stop a minute, and I will bring you a multitude  of people, and we together will make a large city.\" En-Noor kept his  word, and brought a multitude of Kailouees, Kohlans, and their slaves.  Now Tesaoua is a mighty city, and En-Noor has got a small town of his  own near it, mostly peopled by his dependants. Such is the foundation of  many African cities; these places springing up as mushrooms, and  disappearing as soon.    En-Noor also pretends, that through his father he is heir to the thrones  of the ancient Kohlans, about Kashna, Gouber, and Maradee, and that he  ought to come into possession after the death of the present occupants.  This, I should think, is incorrect; but his highness has undoubtedly  great political influence in those countries. We learn that several of  the men of Tintalous have wives and families in Damerghou and Tesaoua,  but none of them have large families--only one or two children.          CHAPTER III.

It  appears that the treaty will not be signed, nor even presented to the  Sultan. En-Noor paid me a visit, as usual, this morning. I presented to  his highness some old boxes, with which he ordered a door to be made for  his palace. His politeness does not cease, and the graciousness with  which he receives my presents is really remarkable.    The man sent after our camels brought back my poor white maharee, and  demanded ten dollars (as good as twenty to me) for his trouble. I  refused to give them, preferring to let him have the camel, which is  hardly worth ten dollars. This manner of recovering our lost or stolen  camels amounts to buying them over again. But it has been our misfortune  all along, that our friends, and those who profess to be such, and all  who attempt to aid us--every one of them, have profited by our losses,  and the disasters which have befallen us. This dispute has been referred  to En-Noor, and they have accepted five dollars, which I offered them.    I this day made out the statement of the principal items of expenditure  which the expedition has incurred from Mourzuk to Tintalous, including  the escort to Zinder. It amounts to the enormous sum of three thousand  mahboubs, or about six hundred pounds sterling!! If we do not proceed  better than this on the future part of the journey, the expedition will  at any rate be bankrupt and ruined for want of funds.    _23d._--Yusuf and I brought before Overweg this morning the necessity of  his assisting in relieving the Government from the double payment of the  sums advanced by the Sfaxee. He agreed that it was highly important to  save this money, and promised to place his goods at my disposal for sale  in Soudan.    On the departure of the caravan for Zinder and Kanou every male  inhabitant will leave Tintalous, some starting with it and others going  for salt, leaving only the women and children behind. This is considered  by the Moors as preferable to leaving a few men behind, because these  few would occasion quarrels amongst the women, and, besides, excite the  jealousy of the absent husbands.    Most of the men who go with us to Damerghou and forward to Tesaoua will  find another wife and family in both these places. This is a regular  emigration of males, not the accidental departure of fathers and  husbands. These gentlemen pass half "]]]
