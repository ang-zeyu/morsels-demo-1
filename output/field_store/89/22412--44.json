No--no I begin to think it would be imprudent--and you know  I admit you as a Lover no farther than Fashion requires.    SURFACE. True--a mere Platonic Cicisbeo, what every London wife is  entitled to.    LADY TEAZLE. Certainly one must not be out of the Fashion--however, I  have so much of my country Prejudices left--that--though Sir Peter's ill  humour may vex me ever so, it never shall provoke me to----    SURFACE. The only revenge in your Power--well I applaud your moderation.    LADY TEAZLE. Go--you are an insinuating Hypocrite--but we shall be  miss'd--let us join the company.    SURFACE. True, but we had best not return together.    LADY TEAZLE. Well don't stay--for Maria shan't come to hear any more of  your Reasoning, I promise you--         [Exit.]    SURFACE. A curious Dilemma truly my Politics have run me into. I wanted  at first only to ingratiate myself with Lady Teazle that she might not  be my enemy with Maria--and I have I don't know how--become her  serious Lover, so that I stand a chance of Committing a Crime I never  meditated--and probably of losing Maria by the Pursuit!--Sincerely I  begin to wish I had never made such a Point of gaining so very good a  character, for it has led me into so many curst Rogueries that I doubt I  shall be exposed at last.         [Exit.]          SCENE III.--At SIR PETER'S         --ROWLEY and SIR OLIVER--    SIR OLIVER. Ha! ha! ha! and so my old Friend is married, hey?--a young  wife out of the country!--ha! ha! that he should have stood Bluff to old  Bachelor so long and sink into a Husband at last!    ROWLEY. But you must not rally him on the subject Sir Oliver--'tis a  tender Point I assure you though He has been married only seven months.    SIR OLIVER. Ah then he has been just half a year on the stool  of Repentance--Poor Peter! But you say he has entirely given up  Charles--never sees him, hey?    ROWLEY. His Prejudice against him is astonishing--and I am sure greatly  increased by a jealousy of him with Lady Teazle--which he has  been industriously led into by a scandalous Society--in the  neighbourhood--who have contributed not a little to Charles's ill name.  Whereas the truth is[,] I believe[,] if the lady is partial to either of  them his Brother is the Favourite.    SIR OLIVER. Aye--I know--there are a set of malicious prating prudent  Gossips both male and Female, who murder characters to kill time, and  will rob a young Fellow of his good name before He has years to know the  value of it. . . but I am not to be prejudiced against my nephew by  such I promise you! No! no--if Charles has done nothing false or mean, I  shall compound for his extravagance.    ROWLEY. Then my life on't, you will reclaim him. Ah, Sir, it gives me  new vigour to find that your heart is not turned against him--and that  the son of my good old master has one friend however left--    SIR OLIVER. What! shall I forget Master Rowley--when I was at his  house myself--egad my Brother and I were neither of us very prudent  youths--and yet I believe you have not seen many better men than your  old master was[.]    ROWLEY. 'Tis this Reflection gives me assurance that Charles may yet be  a credit to his Family--but here comes Sir Peter----    SIR OLIVER. Egad so He does--mercy on me--He's greatly altered--and  seems to have a settled married look--one may read Husband in his Face  at this Distance.--         Enter SIR PETER    SIR PETER. Ha! Sir Oliver--my old Friend--welcome to England--a thousand  Times!    SIR OLIVER. Thank you--thank you--Sir Peter--and Efaith I am as glad to  find you well[,] believe me--    SIR PETER. Ah! 'tis a long time since we met--sixteen year I doubt Sir  Oliver--and many a cross accident in the Time--    SIR OLIVER. Aye I have had my share--but, what[!] I find you are  married--hey my old Boy--well--well it can't be help'd--and so I wish  you joy with all my heart--    SIR PETER. Thank you--thanks Sir Oliver.--Yes, I have entered into the  happy state but we'll not talk of that now.    SIR OLIVER. True true Sir Peter old Friends shouldn't begin on  grievances at first meeting. No, no--    ROWLEY. Take care pray Sir----    SIR OLIVER. Well--so one of my nephews I find is a wild Rogue--hey?    SIR PETER. Wild!--oh! my old Friend--I grieve for your disappointment  there--He's a lost young man indeed--however his Brother will make you  amends; Joseph is indeed what a youth should be--everybody in the world  speaks well of him--    SIR OLIVER. I am sorry to hear it--he has too good a character to be an  honest Fellow. Everybody speaks well of him! Psha! then He has bow'd as  low to Knaves and Fools as to the honest dignity of Virtue.    SIR PETER. What Sir Oliver do you blame him for not making Enemies?    SIR OLIVER. Yes--if He has merit enough to deserve them.    SIR PETER. Well--well--you'll be convinced when you know him--'tis  edification to hear him converse--he professes the noblest Sentiments.    SIR OLIVER. Ah plague on his Sentiments--if he salutes me with a scrap  sentence of morality in his mouth I shall be sick directly--but however  don't mistake me Sir Peter I don't mean to defend Charles's Errors--but  before I form my judgment of either of them, I intend to make a trial of  their Hearts--and my Friend Rowley and I have planned something for the  Purpose.    ROWLEY. And Sir Peter shall own he has been for once mistaken.    SIR PETER. My life on Joseph's Honour----    SIR OLIVER. Well come give us a bottle of good wine--and we'll drink the  Lads' Healths and tell you our scheme.    SIR PETER. Alons [Allons], then----    SIR OLIVER. But don't Sir Peter be so severe against your old Friend's  son.    SIR PETER. 'Tis his Vices and Follies have made me his Enemy.--    ROWLEY. Come--come--Sir Peter consider how early He was left to his own  guidance.    SIR OLIVER. Odds my Life--I am not sorry that He has run out of the  course a little--for my Part, I hate to see dry Prudence clinging to  the green juices of youth--'tis like ivy round a sapling and spoils the  growth of the Tree.         END OF THE SECOND ACT          ACT III          SCENE I.--At SIR PETER'S         SIR PETER, SIR OLIVER, and ROWLEY    SIR PETER. Well, then, we will see the Fellows first and have our wine  afterwards.--but how is this, Master Rowley--I don't see the Jet of your  scheme.    ROWLEY. Why Sir--this Mr. Stanley whom I was speaking of, is nearly  related to them by their mother. He was once a merchant in Dublin--but  has been ruined by a series of undeserved misfortunes--and now lately  coming over to solicit the assistance of his friends here--has been  flyng [flung] into prison by some of his Creditors--where he is now with  two helpless Boys.--    SIR OLIVER. Aye and a worthy Fellow too I remember him. But what is this  to lead to--?    ROWLEY. You shall hear--He has applied by letter both to Mr. Surface and  Charles--from the former he has received nothing but evasive promises  of future service, while Charles has done all that his extravagance has  left him power to do--and He is at this time endeavouring to raise a sum  of money--part of which, in the midst of his own distresses, I know He  intends for the service of poor Stanley.    SIR OLIVER. Ah! he is my Brother's Son.    SIR PETER. Well, but how is Sir Oliver personally to----    ROWLEY. Why Sir I will inform Charles and his Brother that Stanley has  obtain'd permission to apply in person to his Friends--and as they  have neither of them ever seen him[,] let Sir Oliver assume his  character--and he will have a fair opportunity of judging at least of  the Benevolence of their Dispositions.    SIR PETER. Pshaw! this will prove nothing--I make no doubt Charles is  Coxcomb and thoughtless enough to give money to poor relations if he had  it--    SIR OLIVER. Then He shall never want it--. I have brought a few Rupees  home with me Sir Peter--and I only want to be sure of bestowing them  rightly.--    ROWLEY. Then Sir believe me you will find in the youngest Brother one  who in the midst of Folly and dissipation--has still, as our immortal  Bard expresses it,--       \"a Tear for Pity and a Hand open as the day for melting Charity.\"    SIR PETER. Pish! What signifies his having an open Hand or Purse  either when He has nothing left to give!--but if you talk of humane  Sentiments--Joseph is the man--Well, well, make the trial, if you  please. But where is the fellow whom you brought for Sir Oliver to  examine, relative to Charles's affairs?    ROWLEY. Below waiting his commands, and no one can give him better  intelligence--This, Sir Oliver, is a friendly Jew, who to do him  justice, has done everything in his power to bring your nephew to a  proper sense of his extravagance.    SIR PETER. Pray let us have him in.    ROWLEY. Desire Mr. Moses to walk upstairs.         [Calls to SERVANT.]    SIR PETER. But Pray why should you suppose he will speak the truth?    ROWLEY. Oh, I have convinced him that he has no chance of recovering  certain Sums advanced to Charles but through the bounty of Sir Oliver,  who He knows is arrived; so that you may depend on his Fidelity to his  interest. I have also another evidence in my Power, one Snake, whom I  shall shortly produce to remove some of YOUR Prejudices[,] Sir Peter[,]  relative to Charles and Lady Teazle.    SIR PETER. I have heard too much on that subject.    ROWLEY. Here comes the honest Israelite.         Enter MOSES  --This is Sir Oliver.    SIR OLIVER. Sir--I understand you have lately had great dealings with my  Nephew Charles.    MOSES. Yes Sir Oliver--I have done all I could for him, but He was  ruined before He came to me for Assistance.    SIR OLIVER. That was unlucky truly--for you have had no opportunity of  showing your Talents.    MOSES. None at all--I hadn't the Pleasure of knowing his Distresses till  he was some thousands worse than nothing, till it was impossible to add  to them.    SIR OLIVER.

When you read  history critically and with a penetrating eye, it becomes evident that the  majority of the famous men have been born, reared and have done their work  in the temperate zone, while very, very few have appeared from the torrid  and frigid zones.    3 Now these sixteen Southern States of the United States are situated in  the temperate zone, and in these regions the perfections of the world of  nature have been fully revealed. For the moderation of the weather, the  beauty of the scenery and the geographical configuration of the country  display a great effect in the world of minds and thoughts. This fact is  well demonstrated through observation and experience.    4 Even the holy, divine Manifestations have had a nature in the utmost  equilibrium, the health and wholesomeness of their bodies most perfect,  their constitutions endowed with physical vigor, their powers functioning  in perfect order, and the outward sensations linked with the inward  perceptions, working together with extraordinary momentum and  coordination.    5 Therefore in these sixteen states, because they are contiguous to other  states and their climate being in the utmost of moderation, unquestionably  the divine teachings must reveal themselves with a brighter effulgence,  the breaths of the Holy Spirit must display a penetrating intensity, the  ocean of the love of God must be stirred with higher waves, the breezes of  the rose garden of the divine love be wafted with higher velocity, and the  fragrances of holiness be diffused with swiftness and rapidity.    6 Praise be to God that the divine outpourings are infinite, the melody of  the lordly principles is in the utmost efficacy, the most great Orb  shining with perfect splendor, the cohorts of the Supreme Concourse are  attacking with invincible power, the tongues are sharper than the swords,  the hearts are more brilliant than the light of electricity, the  magnanimity of the friends precedes all the magnanimities of the former  and subsequent generations, the souls are divinely attracted, and the fire  of the love of God is enkindled.    7 At this time and at this period we must avail ourselves of this most  great opportunity. We must not sit inactive for one moment; we must sever  ourselves from composure, rest, tranquillity, goods, property, life and  attachment to material things. We must sacrifice everything to His  Highness, the Possessor of existence, so that the powers of the Kingdom  may show greater penetration and the brilliant effulgence in this New  Cycle may illumine the worlds of minds and ideals.    8 It is about twenty-three years that the fragrances of God have been  diffused in America, but no adequate and befitting motion has been  realized, and no great acclamation and acceleration has been witnessed.  Now it is my hope that through the heavenly power, the fragrances of the  Merciful, the attraction of consciousness, the celestial outpourings, the  heavenly cohorts and the gushing forth of the fountain of divine love, the  believers of God may arise and in a short time the greatest good may  unveil her countenance, the Sun of Reality may shine forth with such  intensity that the darkness of the world of nature may become entirely  dispelled and driven away; from every corner a most wonderful melody may  be raised, the morning birds may break into such a song that the world of  humanity may be quickened and moved, the solid bodies may become  liquefied, and the souls who are like unto adamantine rocks may open their  wings and through the heat of the love of God fly heavenward.    9 Nearly two thousand years ago, Armenia was enveloped with impenetrable  darkness. One blessed soul from among the disciples of Christ hastened to  that part, and through his effort, erelong that province became illumined.  Thus it has become evident how the power of the Kingdom works!    10 Therefore, rest ye assured in the confirmations of the Merciful and the  assistance of the Most High; become ye sanctified above and purified from  this world and the inhabitants thereof; suffer your intentions to work for  the good of all; cut your attachment to the earth and like unto the  essence of the spirit become ye light and delicate. Then with a firm  resolution, a pure heart, a rejoiced spirit, and an eloquent tongue,  engage your time in the promulgation of the divine principles so that the  oneness of the world of humanity may pitch her canopy in the apex of  America and all the nations of the world may follow the divine policy.  This is certain, that the divine policy is justice and kindness toward all  mankind. For all the nations of the world are the sheep of God, and God is  the kind shepherd. He has created these sheep. He has protected them,  sustained and trained them. What greater kindness than this? And every  moment we must render a hundred thousand thanksgivings that, praise be to  God, we are freed from all the ignorant prejudices, are kind to all the  sheep of God, and our utmost hope is to serve each and all, and like unto  a benevolent father educate every one.    11 Upon you be greeting and praise!    Every soul who travels through the cities, villages and hamlets of these  states and is engaged in the diffusion of the fragrances of God, should  peruse this commune every morning:    O MY God! O my God! Thou seest me in my lowliness and weakness, occupied  with the greatest undertaking, determined to raise Thy word among the  masses and to spread Thy teachings among Thy peoples. How can I succeed  unless Thou assist me with the breath of the Holy Spirit, help me to  triumph by the hosts of Thy glorious kingdom, and shower upon me Thy  confirmations, which alone can change a gnat into an eagle, a drop of  water into rivers and seas, and an atom into lights and suns? O my Lord!  Assist me with Thy triumphant and effective might, so that my tongue may  utter Thy praises and attributes among all people and my soul overflow  with the wine of Thy love and knowledge.    Thou art the Omnipotent and the Doer of whatsoever Thou willest.            11: TABLET TO THE BAHA'IS OF THE CENTRAL STATES      _Revealed on February 8, 1917, in Baha'u'llah's room at the house of Abbud  in Akka, and addressed to the Baha'is of the twelve Central States of the  United States: Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Minnesota,  Iowa, Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas. _    1                                   _He is God!_    O ye old believers and intimate friends:    2 God says in the great Qur'an: \"He specializes for His Mercy whomsoever  He willeth.\"(16)    3 These twelve Central States of the United States are like unto the heart  of America, and the heart is connected with all the organs and parts of  man. If the heart is strengthened, all the organs of the body are  reinforced, and if the heart is weak all the physical elements are  subjected to feebleness.    4 Now praise be to God that Chicago and its environs from the beginning of  the diffusion of the fragrances of God have been a strong heart.  Therefore, through divine bounty and providence it has become confirmed in  certain great matters.    5 First: The call of the Kingdom was in the very beginning raised from  Chicago. This is indeed a great privilege, for in future centuries and  cycles, it will be as an axis around which the honor of Chicago will  revolve.    6 Second: A number of souls with the utmost firmness and steadfastness  arose in that blessed spot in the promotion of the Word of God and even to  the present moment, having purified and sanctified the heart from every  thought, they are occupied with the promulgation of the teachings of God.  Hence the call of praise is raised uninterruptedly from the Supreme  Concourse.    7 Third: During the American journey 'Abdu'l-Baha several times passed  through Chicago and associated with the friends of God. For some time he  sojourned in that city. Day and night he was occupied with the mention of  the True One and summoned the people to the Kingdom of God.    8 Fourth: Up to the present time, every movement initiated in Chicago, its  effect was spread to all parts and to all directions, just as everything  that appears in and manifests from the heart influences all the organs and  limbs of the body.    9 Fifth: The first Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar in America was instituted in  Chicago, and this honor and distinction is infinite in value. Out of this  Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar, without doubt, thousands of Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kars  will be born.    10 Likewise (were instituted in Chicago) the general Annual Conventions,  the foundation of the Star of the West, the Publishing Society for the  publication of books and Tablets and their circulation in all parts of  America, and the preparations now under way for the celebration of the  Golden Centenary Anniversary of the Kingdom of God. I hope that this  Jubilee and this Exhibition may be celebrated in the utmost perfection so  that the call to the world of unity, \"There is no God but One God, and all  the Messengers, from the beginning to the Seal of the Prophets (Muhammad)  were sent on the part of the True One!\" may be raised; the flag of the  oneness of the world of humanity be unfurled, the melody of universal  peace may reach the ears of the East and the West, all the paths may be  cleared and straightened, "]]]
