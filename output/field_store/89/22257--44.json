Climbers and young  trees melted before them like a cloud before the sun! Many more would  have worked than we employed, but we used the precaution of taking  the names of those engaged. The tall men became exhausted soonest,  while the shorter men worked vigorously still--but a couple of days'  hard work seemed to tell on the best of them. It is doubtful if any  but meat-eating people can stand long-continued labour without  exhaustion: the Chinese may be an exception. When French navvies were  first employed they could not do a tithe of the work of our English  ones; but when the French were fed in the same style as the English,  they performed equally well. Here the Makonde have rarely the chance  of a good feed of meat: it is only when one of them is fortunate  enough to spear a wild hog or an antelope that they know this luxury;  if a fowl is eaten they get but a taste of it with their porridge.    _13th April, 1866._--We now began to descend the northern slope down  to the Rovuma, and a glimpse could occasionally be had of the country;  it seemed covered with great masses of dark green forest, but the  undulations occasionally looked like hills, and here and there a  Sterculia had put on yellow foliage in anticipation of the coming  winter. More frequently our vision was circumscribed to a few yards  till our merry woodcutters made for us the pleasant scene of a long  vista fit for camels to pass: as a whole, the jungle would have made  the authors of the natty little hints to travellers smile at their own  productions, good enough, perhaps, where one has an open country with  trees and hills; by which to take bearings, estimate distances, see  that one point is on the same latitude, another on the same longitude  with such another, and all to be laid down fair and square with  protractor and compass, but so long as we remained within the  vegetation, that is fed by the moisture from the Indian Ocean, the  steamy, smothering air, and dank, rank, luxuriant vegetation made me  feel, like it, struggling for existence,--and no more capable of  taking bearings than if I had been in a hogshead and observing through  the bunghole!    An old Monyinko headman presented a goat and asked if the sepoys  wished to cut its throat: the Johannees, being of a different sect of  Mahometans, wanted to cut it in some other way than their Indian  co-religionists: then ensued a fierce dispute as to who was of the  right sort of Moslem! It was interesting to see that not Christians  alone, but other nations feel keenly on religious subjects.    I saw rocks of grey sandstone (like that which overlies coal) and the  Rovuma in the distance. Didi is the name of a village whose headsman,  Chombokea, is said to be a doctor; all the headmen pretend or are  really doctors; however one, Fundindomba, came after me for medicine  for himself.    _14th April, 1866._--To-day we succeeded in reaching the Rovuma, where  some very red cliffs appear on the opposite heights, and close by  where it is marked on the map that the _Pioneer_ turned back in 1861.  Here we rested on Sunday 15th.    _16th April, 1866._--Our course now lay westwards, along the side of  that ragged outline of table-land, which we had formerly seen from the  river as flanking both sides. There it appeared a range of hills  shutting in Rovuma, here we had spurs jutting out towards the river,  and valleys retiring from a mile to three miles inland. Sometimes we  wended our way round them, sometimes rose over and descended their  western sides, and then a great deal of wood-cutting was required. The  path is not straight, but from one village to another. We came  perpetually on gardens, and remarked that rice was sown among the  other grain; there must be a good deal of moisture at other times to  admit of this succeeding: at present the crops were suffering for want  of rain. We could purchase plenty of rice for the sepoys, and well it  was so, for the supply which was to last till we arrived at Ngomano  was finished on the 13th. An old doctor, with our food awaiting,  presented me with two large bags of rice and his wife husked it for  us.    _17th April, 1866._--I had to leave the camels in the hands of the  sepoys: I ordered them to bring as little luggage as possible, and the  Havildar assured me that two buffaloes were amply sufficient to carry  all they would bring. I now find that they have more than full loads  for two buffaloes, two mules, and two donkeys; but when these animals  fall down under them, they assure me with so much positiveness that  they are not overloaded, that I have to be silent, or only, as I have  several times done before, express the opinion that they will kill  these animals. This observation on my part leads them to hide their  things in the packs of the camels, which also are over-burdened. I  fear that my experiment with the tsetse will be vitiated, but no  symptoms yet occur in any of the camels except weariness.[6] The sun  is very sharp; it scorches. Nearly all the sepoys had fever, but it is  easily cured; they never required to stop marching, and we cannot make  over four or five miles a day, which movement aids in the cure. In all  cases of fever removal from the spot of attack should be made: after  the fever among the sepoys, the Nassick boys took their turn along  with the Johannees.    _18th April, 1866._--Ben Ali misled us away up to the north in spite  of my protest, when we turned in that direction; he declared that was  the proper path. We had much wood-cutting, and found that our course  that day and next was to enable him to visit and return from one of  his wives--a comely Makonde woman! He brought her to call on me, and I  had to be polite to the lady, though we lost a day by the zigzag. This  is one way by which the Arabs gain influence; a great many very  light-coloured people are strewed among the Makonde, but only one of  these had the Arab hair. On asking Ali whether any attempts had been  made by Arabs to convert those with whom they enter into such intimate  relationships, he replied that the Makonde had no idea of a Deity--no  one could teach them, though Makonde slaves when taken to the coast  and elsewhere were made Mahometans. Since the slave-trade was  introduced this tribe has much diminished in numbers, and one village  makes war upon another and kidnaps, but no religious teaching has been  attempted. The Arabs come down to the native ways, and make no efforts  to raise the natives to theirs; it is better that it is so, for the  coast Arab's manners and morals would be no improvement on the pagan  African!    _19th April, 1866._--We were led up over a hill again, and on to the  level of the plateau (where the evaporation is greater than in the  valley), and tasted water of an agreeable coldness for the first time  this journey. The people, especially the women, are very rude, and the  men very eager to be employed as woodcutters. Very merry they are at  it, and every now and then one raises a cheerful shout, in which all  join. I suppose they are urged on by a desire to please their wives  with a little clothing. The higher up the Rovuma we ascend the people  are more and more tattooed on the face, and on all parts of the body.  The teeth are filed to points, and huge lip-rings are worn by the  women; some few Mabeha men from the south side of the river have  lip-rings too.    _20th April, 1866._--A Johanna man allowed the camels to trespass and  destroy a man's tobacco patch: the owner would not allow us after this  to pass through his rice-field, in which the route lay. I examined the  damage, and made the Johanna man pay a yard of calico for it, which  set matters all right.    Tsetse are biting the buffaloes again. Elephants, hippopotami, and  pigs are the only game here, but we see none: the tsetse feed on  them. In the low meadow land, from one to three miles broad, which  lies along both banks, we have brackish pools, and one, a large one,  which we passed, called Wrongwe, had much fish, and salt is got from  it.    _21st April, 1866._--After a great deal of cutting we reached the  valley of Mehambwe to spend Sunday, all glad that it had come round  again. Here some men came to our camp from Ndonde, who report that an  invasion of Mazitu had three months ago swept away all the food out of  the country, and they are now obliged to send in every direction for  provisions. When saluting, they catch each other's hands and say, \"Ai!  Ai!\" but the general mode (introduced, probably by the Arabs) is to  take hold of the right hand, and say, \"Marhaba\" (welcome).    A wall-eyed ill-looking fellow, who helped to urge on the attack on  our first visit in 1861, and the man to whom I gave cloth to prevent a  collision, came about us disguised in a jacket. I knew him well, but  said nothing to him.[7]    _23rd April, 1866._--When we marched this morning we passed the spot  where an animal had been burned in the fire, and on enquiry I found  that it is the custom when a leopard is killed to take off the skin  and consume the carcase thus, because the Makonde do not eat it. The  reason they gave for not eating flesh which is freely eaten by other  tribes, is that the leopard devours men; this shows the opposite of an  inclination to cannibalism.    All the rocks we had seen showed that the plateau consists of grey  sandstone, capped by a ferruginous sandy conglomerate. We now came to  blocks of silicified wood lying on the surface; it is so like recent  wood, that no one who has not handled it would conceive it to be  stone and not wood: the outer surface preserves the grain or woody  fibre, the inner is generally silica.    Buffaloes bitten by tsetse again show no bad effects from it: one mule  is, however, dull and out of health; I thought that this might be the  effect of the bite till I found that his "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16679"],[0,"The History of England (#7)"],[1,"as his representative. The  strong water defences of the rebel city on the south made it  unadvisable for them to take the direct route towards it. Their army  descended the Trent to Torksey, where it rested the night of May 19.  Early next day, the eve of Trinity Sunday, it marched in four \"battles\"  to relieve Lincoln Castle.    There were more than 600 knights besieging the castle and holding the  town, and the relieving army only numbered 400 knights and 300  cross-bowmen. But the barons dared not risk a combat that might have  involved them in the fate of Stephen in 1141. They retreated within the  city and allowed the marshal to open up communications with the castle.  The marshal's plan of battle was arranged by Peter des Roches, who was  more at home in the field than in the church. The cross-bowmen under  Falkes de Breaute were thrown into the castle, and joined with the  garrison in making a sally from its east gate into the streets of the  town. While the barons were thus distracted, the marshal burst through  the badly defended north gate. The barons taken in front and flank  fought desperately, but with no success. Falkes' cross-bowmen shot down  their horses, and the dismounted knights soon failed to hold their own  in the open ground about the cathedral. The Count of Perche was slain  by a sword-thrust through the eyehole of his helmet. The royalists  chased the barons down the steep lanes which connect the upper with the  lower town. When they reached level ground the baronial troops rallied,  and once more strove to reascend the hill. But the town was assailed on  every side, and its land defences yielded with little difficulty. The  Earl of Chester poured his vassals through one of the eastern gates,  and took the barons in flank. Once more they broke, and this time they  rallied not again, but fled through the Wigford suburb seeking any  means of escape. Some obstruction in the Bar-gate, the southern exit  from the city, retarded their flight, and many of the leaders were  captured. The remnant fled to London, thinking that \"every bush was  full of marshals,\" and suffering severely from the hostility of the  peasantry. Only three persons were slain in the battle, but there was a  cruel massacre of the defenceless citizens after its close. So vast was  the booty won by the victors that in scorn they called the fight the  Fair of Lincoln![1]        [1] For a discussion of the battle, see _English Hist. Review_,      xviii. (1903), 240-65.    Louis' prospects were still not desperate. The victorious army  scattered, each man to his own house, so that the marshal was in no  position to press matters to extremities. But there was a great rush to  make terms with the victor, and Louis thought it prudent to abandon the  hopeless siege of Dover, and take refuge with his partisans, the  Londoners. Meanwhile the marshal hovered round London, hoping  eventually to shut up the enemy in the capital. On June 12, the  Archbishop of Tyre and three Cistercian abbots, who had come to England  to preach the Crusade, persuaded both parties to accept provisional  articles of peace. Louis stipulated for a complete amnesty to all his  partisans; but the legate declined to grant pardon to the rebellious  clerks who had refused to obey the interdict, conspicuous among whom  was the firebrand Simon Langton, brother of the archbishop. Finding no  compromise possible, Louis broke off the negotiations rather than  abandon his friends. Gualo urged a siege of London, but the marshal saw  that his resources were not adequate for such a step. Again many of his  followers went home, and the court abode first at Oxford and afterwards  at Gloucester. It seemed as if the war might go on for ever.    Blanche of Castile, Louis' wife, redoubled her efforts on his behalf. In  response to her entreaties a hundred knights and several hundred  men-at-arms took ship for England. Among the knights was the famous  William des Barres, one of the heroes of Bouvines, and Theobald, Count  of Blois. Eustace the Monk, a renegade clerk turned pirate, and a hero  of later romance, took command of the fleet. On the eve of St.  Bartholomew, August 23, Eustace sailed from Calais towards the mouth of  the Thames. Kent had become royalist; the marshal and Hubert de Burgh  held Sandwich, so that the long voyage up the Thames was the only way of  taking succour to Louis. Next day the old earl remained on shore, but  sent out Hubert with the fleet. The English let the French pass by,  and then, manoeuvring for the weather gage, tacked and assailed them  from behind.[1] The fight raged round the great ship of Eustace, on  which the chief French knights were embarked. Laden with stores, horses,  and a ponderous _trebuchet_, it was too low in the water to manoeuvre or  escape. Hubert easily laid his own vessel alongside it. The English, who  were better used to fighting at sea than the French, threw powdered lime  into the faces of the enemy, swept the decks with their crossbow bolts  and then boarded the ship, which was taken after a fierce fight. The  crowd of cargo boats could offer little resistance as they beat up  against the wind in their retreat to Calais; the ships containing the  soldiers were more fortunate in escaping. Eustace was beheaded, and his  head paraded on a pole through the streets of Canterbury.        [1] This successful attempt of the English fleet to manoeuvre      for the weather gage, that is to secure a position to the      windward of their opponents, is the first recorded instance of      what became the favourite tactics of British admirals. For the      legend of Eustace see _Witasse le Moine_, ed. Foerster (1891).    The battle of St. Bartholomew's Day, like that of Lincoln a triumph of  skill over numbers, proved decisive for the fortunes of Louis. The  English won absolute control of the narrow seas, and cut off from Louis  all hope of fighting his way back to France. As soon as he heard of the  defeat of Eustace, he reopened negotiations with the marshal. On the  29th there was a meeting between Louis and the Earl at the gates of  London. The regent had to check the ardour of his own partisans, and it  was only after anxious days of deliberation that the party of  moderation prevailed. On September 5 a formal conference was held on an  island of the Thames near Kingston. On the 11th a definitive treaty was  signed at the archbishop's house at Lambeth.    The Treaty of Lambeth repeated with little alteration the terms  rejected by Louis three months before. The French prince surrendered  his castles, released his partisans from their oaths to him, and  exhorted all his allies, including the King of Scots and the Prince of  Gwynedd, to lay down their arms. In return Henry promised that no  layman should lose his inheritance by reason of his adherence to Louis,  and that the baronial prisoners should be released without further  payment of ransom. London, despite its pertinacity in rebellion, was to  retain its ancient franchises. The marshal bound himself personally to  pay Louis 10,000 marks, nominally as expenses, really as a bribe to  accept these terms. A few days later Louis and his French barons  appeared before the legate, barefoot and in the white garb of  penitents, and were reconciled to the Church. They were then escorted  to Dover, whence they took ship for France. Only on the rebellious  clergy did Gualo's wrath fall. The canons of St. Paul's were turned out  in a body; ringleaders like Simon Langton were driven into exile, and  agents of the legate traversed the country punishing clerks who had  disregarded the interdict. But Honorius was more merciful than Gualo,  and within a year even Simon received his pardon. The laymen of both  camps forgot their differences, when Randolph of Chester and William of  Ferrars fought in the crusade of Damietta, side by side with Saer of  Winchester and Robert FitzWalter. The reconciliation of parties was  further shown in the marriage of Hubert de Burgh to John's divorced  wife, Isabella of Gloucester, a widow by the death of the Earl of  Essex, and still the foremost English heiress. On November 6 the  pacification was completed by the reissue of the Great Charter in what  was substantially its final form. The forest clauses of the earlier  issues were published in a much enlarged shape as a separate Forest  Charter, which laid down the great principle that no man was to lose  life or limb for hindering the king's hunting.    It is tempting to regard the defeat of Louis as a triumph of English  patriotism. But it is an anachronism to read the ideals of later ages  into the doings of the men of the early thirteenth century. So far as  there was national feeling in England, it was arrayed against Henry. To  the last the most fervently English of the barons were steadfast on the  French prince's side, and the triumph of the little king had largely  been procured by John's foreigners. To contemporary eyes the rebels  were factious assertors of class privileges and feudal immunities.  Their revolt against their natural lord brought them into conflict with  the sentiment of feudal duty which was still so strong in faithful  minds. And against them was a stronger force than feudal loyally. From  this religious standpoint the Canon of Barnwell best sums up the  situation: \"It was a miracle that the heir of France, who had won so  large a part of the kingdom, was constrained to abandon the realm  without hope of recovering it. It was because the hand of God was not  with him. He came to England in spite of the prohibition of the Holy  Roman Church, and he remained there regardless of its anathema.\"    The young king never forgot that he owed his throne to the pope and his  legate. \"When we were bereft of our father in tender years,\" he declared  long afterwards, \"when our subjects were turned against us, it was our  mother, the Holy Roman Church, that brought back our"]]]
