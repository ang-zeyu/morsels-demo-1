From this bank ye will better become  acquainted with the acts and countenances of all of them, than  received among them on the level below. He who sits highest and  has the semblance of having neglected what he should have done,  and who moves not his mouth to the others' songs, was Rudolph the  Emperor, who might have healed the wounds that have slain Italy,  so that slowly by another she is revived.[2] The next, who in  appearance comforts him, ruled the land where the water rises  that Moldau bears to Elbe, and Elbe to the sea. Ottocar was his  name,[3] and in his swaddling clothes he was better far than  bearded Wenceslaus, his son, whom luxury and idleness feed.[4]  And that small-nosed one, who seems close in counsel with him who  has so benign an aspect, died in flight and disflowering the  lily;[5]  look there how he beats his breast. See the next who,  sighing, has made a bed for his cheek with his hand.[6] Father  and father-in-law are they of the harm of France; they know his  vicious and foul life, and thence comes the grief that so pierces  them. He who looks so large-limbed,[7] and who accords in singing  with him of the masculine nose,[8] wore girt the cord of every  worth, and if the youth that is sitting behind him had followed  him as king, truly had worth gone from vase to vase, which cannot  be said of the other heirs: James and Frederick hold the realms;  [9] the better heritage no one possesses. Rarely doth human  goodness rise through the branches, and this He wills who gives  it, in order that it may be asked from Him. To the large-nosed  one also my words apply not less than to the other, Peter, who is  singing with him; wherefore Apulia and Provence are grieving  now.[10] The plant is as inferior to its seed, as, more than  Beatrice and Margaret, Constance still boasts of her husband.[11]  See the King of the simple life sitting there alone, Henry of  England; he in his branches hath a better issue.[12] That one who  lowest among them sits on the ground, looking upward, is William  the marquis,[13] for whom Alessandria and her war make Montferrat  and the Canavese mourn.\"    [1] The beginning of a Church hymn to the Virgin, sung after  vespers, of which the first verses are:--   Salve, Regina, mater misericordiae!    Vita, dulcedo et spes nostra, salve!    Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevae;    Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes    In hac lacrymarum valle.    [2] The neglect of Italy by the Emperor Rudolph (see the  preceding Canto) was not to be repaired by the vain efforts of  Henry VII.    [3] Ottocar, King of Bohemia and Duke of Austria, had been slain  in battle against Rudolph, on the Marchfeld by the Donau, in  1278; \"whereby Austria fell to Rudolph.\" See Carlyle's Frederick  the Great, book ii. ch. 7.    [4] Dante repeats his harsh judgment of Wenceslaus in the  nineteenth Canto of Paradise. His first wife was the daughter of  Rudolph of Hapsburg. He died in 1305.    [5] This is Philip the Bold of France, 1270-1285. Having invaded  Catalonia, in a war with Peter the Third of Aragon, he was driven  back, and died on the retreat at Perpignan.    [6] Henry of Navarre, the brother of Thibault, the poet-king  (Hell, Canto XXII.). His daughter Joan married Philip the Fair,  \"the harm of France,\" the son of Philip the Bold.    [7] Peter of Aragon (died 1285), the husband of Constance,  daughter of Manfred (see Canto III.); the youth who is seated  behind him is his son Alphonso, who died in 1291.    [8] Charles of Anjou.    [9] The kingdoms of Aragon and Sicily; both James and Frederick  were living when Dante thus wrote of them. The \"better heritage\"  was the virtue of their father.    [10] Apulia and Provence were grieving under the rule of Charles  II., the degenerate son of Charles of Anjou, who died in 1309.    [11] The meaning is doubtful; perhaps it is, that the children of  Charles of Anjou and of Peter of Aragon are as inferior to their  fathers, as Charles himself, the husband first of Beatrice of  Provence and then of Margaret of Nevers, was inferior to Peter,  the husband of Constance.    [12] Henry III., father of Edward I.    [13] William Spadalunga was Marquis of Montferrat and Canavese,  the Piedmontese highlands and plain north of the Po. He was  Imperial vicar, and the bead of the Ghibellines in this region.  In a war with the Guelphs, who had risen in revolt in 1290, he  was taken captive at Alessandria, and for two years, till his  death, was kept in an iron cage. Dante refers to him in the  Convito, iv. 11, as \"the good marquis of Montferrat.\"        CANTO VIII. Valley of the Princes.--Two Guardian Angels.--Kino  Visconti.--The Serpent.--Corrado Malaspina.      It was now the hour that turns back desire in those that sail the  sea, and softens their hearts, the day when they have said to  their sweet friends farewell, and which pierces the new pilgrim  with love, if he hears from afar a bell that seems to deplore the  dying day,--when I began to render hearing vain, and to look at  one of the souls who, uprisen, besought attention with its hand.  It joined and raised both its palms, fixing its eyes toward the  orient, as if it said to God, \"For aught else I care not.\" \"Te  lucis ante\"[1] so devoutly issued from his mouth and with such  sweet notes that it made me issue forth from my own mind. And  then the others sweetly and devoutly accompanied it through all  the hymn to the end, having their eyes upon the supernal wheels.  Here, reader, sharpen well thine eyes for the truth, for the veil  is now indeed so thin that surely passing through within is  easy.[2]    [1] The opening words of a hymn sung at Complines, the last  service of the day:     Te locis ante terminum,    Rerom Creator poscimus,    Ut tus pro clementia    Sis presul et custodia:--    \"Before the close of light, we pray thee, O Creator, that through  thy clemency, thou be our watch and guard.\"    [2] The allegory seems to be, that the soul which has entered  upon the way of repentance and purification, but which is not yet  securely advanced therein, is still exposed to temptation,  especially when the light of the supernal grace does not shine  directly upon it. But if the soul have steadfast purpose to  resist temptation, and seek aid from God, that aid will not be  wanting. The prayer of the Church which is recited after the hymn  just cited has these words: \"Visit, we pray thee, O Lord, this  abode, and drive far from it the snares of the enemy. Let thy  holy Angels bide in it, and guard us in peace.\" Pallid with self  distrust, humble with the sense of need, the soul awaits the  fulfilment of its prayer. The angels are clad in green, the  symbolic color of hope. Their swords are truncated, because  needed only for defence.      I saw that army of the gentle-born silently thereafter gazing  upward as if in expectation, pallid and humble; and I saw issuing  from on high and descending two angels, with two fiery swords  truncated and deprived of their points. Green as leaflets just  now born were their garments, which, beaten and blown by their  green pinions, they trailed behind. One came to stand a little  above us, and the other descended on the opposite bank, so that  the people were contained between them. I clearly discerned in  them their blond heads, but on their faces the eye was dazzled,  as a faculty which is confounded by excess. \"Both come from the  bosom of Mary,\" said Sordello, \"for guard of the valley, because  of the serpent that will come straightway.\" Whereat I, who knew  not by what path, turned me round, and all chilled drew me close  to the trusty shoulders.    And Sordello again, \"Now let us go down into the valley among the  great shades, and we will speak to them; well pleasing will it be  to them to see you.\" Only three steps I think I had descended and  I was below; and I saw one who was gazing only at me as if he  wished to know me. It was now the time when the air was  darkening, but not so that between his eyes and mine it did not  reveal that which it locked up before.[1] Towards me he moved,  and I moved towards him. Gentle Judge Nino,[2] how much it  pleased me when I saw that thou wast not among the damned! No  fair salutation was silent between us; then he asked, \"How long  is it since thou camest to the foot of the mountain across the  far waters?\"    [1] It was not yet so dark that recognition of one near at hand  was difficult, though at a distance it had been impossible.    [2] Nino (Ugolino) de' Visconti of Pisa was the grandson of Count  Ugolino, and as the leader of the Pisan Guelphs became his bitter  opponent. Sardinia was under the dominion of Pisa, and was  divided into four districts, each of which was governed by one of  the Pisan nobles, under the title of Judge. Nino had held the  judicature of Gallura, where Frate Gomita (see Hell, Canto XXII.)  had been his vicar. Nino died in 1296.      \"Oh,\" said I to him, \"from within the dismal places I came this  morning, and I am in the first life, albeit in going thus, I may  gain the other.\" And when my answer was heard, Sordello[1] and he  drew themselves back like folk suddenly bewildered, the one to  Virgil, and the other turned to one who was seated there, crying,  \"Up, Corrado,[2] come to see what God through grace hath willed.\"  Then, turning to me, \"By that singular gratitude thou owest unto  Him who so hides His own first wherefore[3] that there is no ford  to it, when thou shalt be beyond the wide waves, say to my Joan,  that for me she cry there where answer is given to the innocent.  I do not think her mother[4] loves me longer, since she changed  her white wimples,[5] which she, wretched, needs must desire  again. Through her easily enough is comprehended how long the  fire of love"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1997"],[0,"The Divine Comedy, Volume 3, Paradise (#7)"],[1,"rt, may be called created, even  as they are, in their entire being; but the elements which thou  hast named, and those things which are made of them, are informed  by a created power.[2] The matter of which they consist was  created; the informing power in these stars which go round about  them was created. The ray and the motion of the holy lights draw  out from its potential elements[3] the soul of every brute and of  the plants; but the Supreme Benignity inspires your life without  intermediary, and enamors it of Itself so that ever after it  desires It. And hence[4] thou canst argue further your  resurrection, if thou refleetest bow the human flesh was made  when the first parents were both made.\"    [1] Sincere is here used in the sense of incorruptible, or  perhaps unspoiled,--the quality of the Heavens as contrasted with  the Earth.    [2] The elements axe informed, that is, receive their specific  being not immediately from Goa, but mediately through the  informing Intelligences.    [3] Literally, \"from the potentiate mingling,\" that is, from the  matter endowed with the potentiality of becoming informed by the  vegetative and the sensitive soul.    [4] From the principle that what proceeds immediately from Goa is  immortal.        CANTO VIII. Ascent to the Heaven of Venus.--Spirits of Lovers,  Source of the order and the varieties in mortal things.    The world in its peril[1] was wont to believe that the beautiful  Cypriote[2] revolving in the third epicycle rayed out mad love;  wherefore the ancient people in their ancient error not only unto  her did honor with sacrifice and with votive cry, but they  honored Dione[3] also and Cupid, the one as her mother, the other  as her son, and they said that he had sat in Dido's lap[4] And  from her, from whom I take my beginning, they took the name of  the star which the sun wooes, now at her back now at her  front.[5] I was not aware of the ascent to it; but of being in  it, my Lady, whom I saw become more beautiful, gave me full  assurance.    [1] In heathen times.    [2] Venus, so called from her birth in Cyprus.    [3] Dione, daughter of Oceanus and Thetis, mother of Venus.    [4] Under the form of Ascanius, as Virgil tells in the first book  of the Aeneid.    [5] According as it is morning or evening star.      And even as in a flame a spark is seen, and as voice from voice  is distinguished when one is steady and the other goes and  returns, I saw in that light other lamps moving in a circle more  and less rapidly, in the measure, I believe, of their inward  vision. From a cold cloud winds never descended, or visible or  not, go swift, that they would not seem impeded and slow to him  who had seen these divine lights coming to us, leaving the  circling begun first among the high Seraphim. And within those  who appeared most in front was sounding HOSANNA, so that never  since have I been without desire of hearing it again. Then one  came nearer to us, and alone began, \"We all are ready to thy  pleasure, that thou mayest joy in us. With one circle, with one  circling, and with one thirst,[1] we revolve with the celestial  Princes,[2] to whom thou in the world once said: 'Ye who  intelligent move the third heaven;' and we are so full of love  that, to please thee, a little quiet will not be less sweet to  us.\"    [1] One circle in space, one circling in eternity, one thirst for  the vision of God.    [2] The third in ascending order of the hierarchy of the Angels,  corresponding with the heaven of Venus.      After my eyes had offered themselves reverently to my Lady, and  she had of herself made them contented and assured, they turned  again to the light which had promised so much; and, \"Tell who ye  are,\" was my utterance, stamped with great affection. And how  much greater alike in quantity and quality did I see it become,  through the new gladness which was added to its gladnesses when I  spoke! Become thus, it said to me,[1] \"The world had me below  short while; and had it been longer much evil had not been which  will be. My joy which rays around me, and hides me like a  creature swathed in its own silk, holds me concealed from thee.  Much didst thou love me, and thou hadst good reason; for had I  stayed below I had showed thee of my love far more than the  leaves. That left bank which is bathed by the Rhone, after it has  mingled with the Sorgue, awaited me in due time for its lord;[2]  and that born of Ansonia[3] which is towned with Bari, with  Gaeta, and with Catona,[4] whence the Tronto and the Verde  disgorge into the sea. Already was shining on my brow the crown  of that land which the Danube waters after it abandons its German  banks;[5] and the fair Trinacria[6] (which is darkened, not by  Typhoeus but by nascent sulphur, on the gulf between Pachynus and  Pelorus which receives greatest annoy from Eurus[7]) would be  still awaiting its kings descended through me from Charles and  Rudolph,[8] if evil rule, which always embitters the subject  people, had not moved Palermo to shout, 'Die! Die!'[9] And if my  brother had taken note of this,[10] he would already put to  flight the greedy poverty of Catalonia, in order that it might  not do him harm: for truly there is need for him or for some  other to look to it, so that on his laden bark more load be not  put. His own nature, which descended niggardly from a liberal  one, would have need of such a soldiery as should not care to put  into a chest.\"[11]    [1] It is Charles Martel, son of Charles II. of Naples, who  speaks. He was born about 1270, and in 1294 he was at Florence  for more than twenty days, and at this time may have become  acquainted with Dante. Great honor was done him by the  Florentines, and he showed great love to them, so that he won  favor from everybody, says Villani. He died in 1295.    [2] Charles of Anjou, grandfather of Charles Martel, had received  this part of Provence as dowry of his wife Beatrice, the youngest  daughter of Raymond Berenger.    [3] A name for Italy, used only by the poets.    [4] Bari on the Adriatic, Gaeta on the Mediterranean, and Catons  at the too of Italy, together with the two rivers named, give  roughly the boundaries of the Kingdom of Naples.    [5] The mother of Charles Martel was sister of Ladislaus IV.,  King of Hungary. He died without offspring, and Charles II.  claimed the kingdom by right of his wife.    [6] Sicily; the gulf darkened by sulphurous fumes is the Bay of  Calabria, which lies exposed to Eurus, that is, to winds from the  south-east.    [7] The sea between Cape Pachynus, the extreme southeastern  point of the island, and Cape Pelorus, the extreme northeastern,  lies exposed to the violence of Eurus or the East wind. Clouds of  smoke from Etna sometimes darken it. The eruptions of Etna were  ascribed by Ovid (Metam. v., 346-353) to the struggles of  Typhoeus, one of the rebellious Giants. Ovid's verses suggested  this description.    [8] From his father, Charles H., or his grandfather, Charles of  Anjou, and from the Emperor Rudolph of Hapsburg, who was the  father of Clemence, Charles Martel's wife.    [9] By the insurrection which began at Palermo in 1282,--the  famous Sicilian Vespers,--the French were driven from the island.    [10] This brother was Robert, the third son of Charles II. He had  been kept as a hostage in Catalonia from 1288 to 1295, and when  he became King of Naples in 1309 he introduced into his service  many Catalonian officials. The words of Charles Martel are  prophetic of the evils wrought by their greed.    [11] Officials who would not, by oppression of the subjects, seek  their private gain.      \"Because I believe that the deep joy which thy speech, my lord,  infuses in me is seen by thee there where every good ends and  begins[1] even as I see it in myself, it is the more grateful to  me; and this also I hold dear, that thou discernest it, gazing  upon God.[2] Thou hast made me glad; and in like wise do thou  make clear to me (since in speaking thou bast moved me to doubt)  how bitter can issue from sweet seed.\" This I to him; and he to  me, \"If I am able to show to thee a truth, thou wilt hold thy  face to that which thou askest, as thou dost hold thy back. The  Good which turns and contents all the realm which thou ascendest,  makes its providence to be a power in these great bodies.[3] And  not the natures only are foreseen in the Mind which by itself is  perfect, but they together with their salvation.[4] For  whatsoever this bow shoots falls disposed to its foreseen end,  even as a thing directed to its aim. Were this not so, the  heavens through which thou journeyest would produce  their effects in such wise that they would not be works of art  but ruins; and that cannot be, if the Intelligences which move  these stars are not defective, and defective also the prime  Intelligence which has not made them perfect.[5] Dost thou wish  that this truth be made still clearer to thee?\" And I, \"No,  truly; because I see it to be impossible that Nature should weary  in that which is needful.\"[6] Whereupon he again, \"Now say, would  it be worse for man on earth if he were not a citizen?\"[7] \"Yes,\"  answered I, \"and here I ask not the reason.\"[8] \"And can he be  so, unless he live there below in divers manner through divers  offices?[9] No; if your master[10] writes well of this.\" So he  went on deducing far as here; then he concluded, \"Hence it  behoves that the roots of your works must be diverse.[11]  Wherefore one is born Solon, and another Xerxes, another  Melchisedech, and another he who, flying through the air, lost  his son. The revolving nature, which is the seal of the mortal  wax, performs its art well, but does not distinguish one inn from  another.[12] Hence it happens that Esau differs in seed from  Jacob, and Quirinus comes from so mean a father that he is  ascribed to Mars. The generated nature would always make its path  like its progenitors, if the divine foresight did not conquer."]]]
