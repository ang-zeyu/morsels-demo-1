There was Domiduca, who brought the  bride to the bridegroom's house, Iterduca, who looked after her on the  transit, Unxia, who anointed her, Cinxia, who bound and unbound her  girdle, and many others.    This sketch of the household worship of the Romans will, I hope, have  justified my contention that there was in it an element more truly  'religious' than anything we should gather from the ceremonies of the  state. The ideas are simpler, the _numina_ seem less cold and more  protective, the worshippers more sensible of divine aid. When we have  looked at the companion picture of the farmer in the fields, we shall  go on to see how the worship of the agricultural household is the  prototype and basis of the state-cult, but first we must consider  briefly the very difficult question of the relation of the living to  the dead.    =3. Relation of the Living and the Dead.=--The worship of the spirits  of dead ancestors is so common a feature in most primitive religions  that it may seem strange even to doubt whether it existed among the  Romans, but, although the question is one of extreme difficulty, and  the evidence very insufficient, I am inclined to believe that, though  the living were always conscious of their continued relation to the  dead, and sensitive of the influence of the powers of the underworld,  yet there was not, strictly speaking, any cult of the dead. Let us  attempt briefly to collect the salient features in ritual, and see to  what conclusion they point as to the underlying belief.    One of the most remarkable facts in domestic worship is that, whereas  the moment of birth and the other great occasions of life are  surrounded with religious ceremony and belief, the moment of death  passes without any trace of religious accompaniment: it is as though  the dying man went out into another world where the ceremonials of this  life can no more avail him, nor its gods protect him. As to his state  after death, opinion varied at different times under different  influences, but the simple early notion, connected especially with the  practice of burial as opposed to cremation,[6] was that his spirit just  sank into the earth, where it rested and returned from time to time to  the upper world through certain openings in the ground (_mundi_), whose  solemn uncovering was one of the regular observances of the festal  calendar: later, no doubt, a more spiritual notion prevailed, though it  never reached definiteness or universality. One idea, however, seems  always to be prominent, that the happiness of the dead could be much  affected by the due performance of the funeral rites; hence it was the  most solemn duty of the heir to perform the _iusta_ for the dead, and  if he failed in any respect to carry them out, he could only atone for  his omission by the annual sacrifice of a sow (_porca praecidanea_) to  Ceres and Tellus--to the divinities of the earth, be it noticed, and  not to the dead themselves. The actual funeral was not a religious  ceremony; a procession was formed (originally at night) of the family  and friends, in which the body of the dead was carried--accompanied by  the busts (_imagines_) of his ancestors--to a tomb outside the town,  and was there laid in the grave. The family on their return proceeded  at once to rites of purification from the contamination which had  overtaken them owing to the presence of a dead body. Two ceremonies  were performed, one for the purification of the house by the sacrifice  of a sow (_porca praesentanea_) to Ceres accompanied by a solemn  sweeping out of refuse (_exverrae_), the other the lustration of their  own persons by fire and water. This done, they sat down with their  friends to a funeral feast (_silicernium_), which, Cicero tells us, was  regarded as an honour rather to the surviving members of the family  than to the dead, so that mourning was not worn. Two other ceremonies  within the following week, the _feriae denicales_ and the _novendiale  sacrum_, brought the religious mourning to a close. Not that the dead  were forgotten after the funeral: year by year, on the anniversaries of  death and burial, and on certain fixed occasions known by such  suggestive titles as 'the day of roses' and 'the day of violets,' the  family would revisit the tomb and make simple offerings of salt cake  (_mola salsa_), of bread soaked in wine, or garlands of flowers: there  is some trace, on such occasions, of prayer, but it would seem to be  rather the repetition of general religious formulae than a petition to  the dead for definite blessings.    Such are the principal features of the family ritual in relation to  their dead; but if we are to form any just notion of belief, we must  supplement them by reference to the ceremonies of the state, which  here, as elsewhere, are very clearly the household-cult 'writ large.'  In the Calendars we find two obvious celebrations in connection with  the dead, taking place at different seasons of the year, and consisting  of ceremonies markedly different in character. In the gloomy month of  February--associated with solemn lustrations--occurs the festival known  popularly (though not in the Calendars) as the Parentalia or dies  Parentales, that is, the days of sacrifice in connection with the dead  members of the family (_parentes_, _parentare_). It begins with the  note on February 13, _Virgo Vestalis parentat_, and continues till the  climax, _Feralia_, on February 21. During these days the magistrates  laid aside the insignia of their offices, the temples were shut,  marriages were forbidden, and every family carried out at the tombs of  its relatives ceremonies resembling those of the _sacra privata_. The  whole season closed on February 22 with the festival of the Caristia or  _cara cognatio_, a family reunion of the survivors in a kind of  'love-feast,' which centred in the worship of the Lar Familiaris. Here  we seem to have simply, as in the family rites, a peaceful and solemn  acknowledgment by the community as a whole of the still subsisting  relation of the living and the dead. On the 9th, 11th, and 13th of May  occurs the Lemuria, a ceremony of a strikingly different order. Once  again temples are shut and marriages forbidden, but the ritual is of a  very different nature. The _Lemures_ or _Larvae_--for there seems to be  little distinction between the two names--are regarded no longer as  members of the family to be welcomed back to their place, but as  hostile spirits to be exorcised.[7] The head of the house rises from  bed at midnight, washes, and walks barefoot through the house, making  signs for the aversion of evil spirits. In his mouth he carries black  beans--always a chthonic symbol--which he spits out nine times without  looking round, saying, as he does so, 'With these I redeem me and  mine': he washes again, and clanks brass vessels together; nine times  he repeats the formula, 'depart, Manes of our fathers' (no doubt using  the dignified title Manes euphemistically), and then finally turns  round. Here we have in a quite unmistakeable manner the feeling of the  hostility of the spirits of the dead: they must be given their  appropriate food and got out of the place as quickly as possible. Some  scholars have attempted to explain the difference between these two  festivals on the assumption that the Parentalia represents the  commemoration of the duly buried dead, the Lemuria the apotropaic right  for the aversion of the unburied, and therefore hostile spirits; but  Ovid has given a far more significant hint, when he tells us that the  Lemuria was the more ancient festival of the two.    So far we have had no indication of anything approaching divinity in  connection with the dead or the underworld as distinct from the  earth-goddesses, but the evidence for it, though vague and shadowy, is  not wanting. Certain mysterious female deities, Tarpeia, Acca Larentia,  Carna, and Laverna, of whom late aetiological myth had its own  explanation, have, in all probability, been rightly interpreted by  Mommsen as divinities of the lower world: the commemorative 'sacrifice  at the tomb,' which we hear of in connection with the first two, was in  reality, we may suppose, an offering to a chthonic deity at a _mundus_.  A rather more tangible personality is Vediovis, who three times a year  has his celebration (_Agonia_ not _feriae_) in the Calendar: he, as his  name denotes, must be the 'opposite of Iove,' that is, probably, his  chthonic counterpart, a notion sufficiently borne out by his subsequent  identification with the Greek Pluto. Finally, of course, there is that  vague body, the Di Manes, 'the good gods,' the principal deities of the  world of the dead; to them invocations are addressed, and they have  their place in the formulae of the _parentalia_ and the opening of the  _mundi_.[8] In connection with them, acting as a link with the female  deities, we have the strange goddess Genita Mana, the 'spirit of birth  and death.'    Controversy is acute as to the interpretation of these facts,  especially in regard to the question whether or no the spirits of the  dead were actually worshipped. I would hazard the following  reconstruction of history as consistent with what we otherwise know of  Roman religion, and with the evidence before us. From the earliest  times the Roman looked upon his dead relations as in some sense living,  lying beneath the earth, but capable alike of returning to the world  above and of influencing in some vague way the fortunes of the living,  especially in relation to the crops which sprung from the ground in  which they lay.

Then they put to sea. When they sailed the weather was favorable, but  after they came out upon the high-seas the fair wind failed, and there  came great gales, and they lost their way, and had a very tedious voyage  that summer. Then illness appeared among their people, and Orm and his  wife Halldis died, and the half of their company. The sea began to run  high, and they had a very wearisome and wretched voyage in many ways, but  arrived, nevertheless, at Heriolfsness in Greenland, on the very eve of  winter.[20-1] At Heriolfsness lived a man named Thorkel. He was a man of  ability and an excellent husbandman. He received Thorbiorn and all of his  ship's company, and entertained them well during the winter. At that time  there was a season of great dearth in Greenland; those who had been at  the fisheries had had poor hauls, and some had not returned. There was a  certain woman there in the settlement, whose name was Thorbiorg. She was  a prophetess, and was called Little Sibyl. She had had nine sisters, all  of whom were prophetesses, but she was the only one left alive. It was  Thorbiorg's custom in the winters, to go to entertainments, and she was  especially sought after at the homes of those who were curious to know  their fate, or what manner of season might be in store for them; and  inasmuch as Thorkel was the chief yeoman in the neighborhood, it was  thought to devolve upon him to find out when the evil time, which was  upon them, would cease. Thorkel invited the prophetess to his home, and  careful preparations were made for her reception, according to the custom  which prevailed, when women of her kind were to be entertained. A high  seat was prepared for her, in which a cushion filled with poultry  feathers was placed. When she came in the evening, with the man who had  been sent to meet her, she was clad in a dark-blue cloak, fastened with a  strap, and set with stones quite down to the hem. She wore glass beads  around her neck, and upon her head a black lamb-skin hood, lined with  white cat-skin. In her hands she carried a staff, upon which there was a  knob, which was ornamented with brass, and set with stones up about the  knob. Circling her waist she wore a girdle of touch-wood, and attached to  it a great skin pouch, in which she kept the charms which she used when  she was practising her sorcery. She wore upon her feet shaggy calf-skin  shoes, with long, tough latchets, upon the ends of which there were large  brass buttons. She had cat-skin gloves upon her hands, which were white  inside and lined with fur. When she entered, all of the folk felt it to  be their duty to offer her becoming greetings. She received the  salutations of each individual according as he pleased her. Yeoman  Thorkel took the sibyl by the hand, and led her to the seat which had  been made ready for her. Thorkel bade her run her eyes over man and beast  and home. She had little to say concerning all these. The tables were  brought forth in the evening, and it remains to be told what manner of  food was prepared for the prophetess. A porridge of goat's beestings was  made for her, and for meat there were dressed the hearts of every kind of  beast, which could be obtained there. She had a brass spoon, and a knife  with a handle of walrus tusk, with a double hasp of brass around the  haft, and from this the point was broken. And when the tables were  removed, Yeoman Thorkel approaches Thorbiorg, and asks how she is pleased  with the home, and the character of the folk, and how speedily she would  be likely to become aware of that concerning which he had questioned her,  and which the people were anxious to know. She replied that she could not  give an opinion in this matter before the morrow, after that she had  slept there through the night. And on the morrow, when the day was far  spent, such preparations were made as were necessary to enable her to  accomplish her soothsaying. She bade them bring her those women, who knew  the incantation, which she required to work her spells, and which she  called Warlocks; but such women were not to be found. Thereupon a search  was made throughout the house, to see whether any one knew this  [incantation]. Then says Gudrid: \"Although I am neither skilled in the  black art nor a sibyl, yet my foster-mother, Halldis, taught me in  Iceland that spell-song, which she called Warlocks.\" Thorbiorg answered:  \"Then art thou wise in season!\" Gudrid replies: \"This is an incantation  and ceremony of such a kind, that I do not mean to lend it any aid, for  that I am a Christian woman.\" Thorbiorg answers: \"It might so be that  thou couldst give thy help to the company here, and still be no worse  woman than before; however I leave it with Thorkel to provide for my  needs.\" Thorkel now so urged Gudrid, that she said she must needs comply  with his wishes. The women then made a ring round about, while Thorbiorg  sat up on the spell-dais. Gudrid then sang the song, so sweet and well,  that no one remembered ever before to have heard the melody sung with so  fair a voice as this. The sorceress thanked her for the song, and said:  \"She has indeed lured many spirits hither, who think it pleasant to hear  this song, those who were wont to forsake us hitherto and refuse to  submit themselves to us. Many things are now revealed to me, which  hitherto have been hidden, both from me and from others. And I am able to  announce that this period of famine will not endure longer, but the  season will mend as spring approaches. The visitation of disease, which  has been so long upon you, will disappear sooner than expected. And thee,  Gudrid, I shall reward out of hand, for the assistance, which thou hast  vouchsafed us, since the fate in store for thee is now all made manifest  to me. Thou shalt make a most worthy match here in Greenland, but it  shall not be of long duration for thee, for thy future path leads out to  Iceland, and a lineage both great and goodly shall spring from thee, and  above thy line brighter rays of light shall shine, than I have power  clearly to unfold. And now fare well and health to thee, my daughter!\"  After this the folk advanced to the sibyl, and each besought information  concerning that about which he was most curious. She was very ready in  her responses, and little of that which she foretold failed of  fulfilment. After this they came for her from a neighboring farmstead,  and she thereupon set out thither. Thorbiorn was then sent for, since he  had not been willing to remain at home while such heathen rites were  practising. The weather improved speedily, when the spring opened, even  as Thorbiorg had prophesied. Thorbiorn equipped his ship and sailed away,  until he arrived at Brattahlid.[23-1] Eric received him with open arms,  and said that it was well that he had come thither. Thorbiorn and his  household remained with him during the winter, while quarters were  provided for the crew among the farmers. And the following spring Eric  gave Thorbiorn land on Stokkaness, where a goodly farmstead was founded,  and there he lived thenceforward.    _Concerning Leif the Lucky and the Introduction of Christianity into  Greenland._--Eric was married to a woman named Thorhild, and had two sons;  one of these was named Thorstein, and the other Leif. They were both  promising men. Thorstein lived at home with his father, and there was not  at that time a man in Greenland who was accounted of so great promise as  he. Leif had sailed to Norway,[24-1] where he was at the court of King  Olaf Tryggvason. When Leif sailed from Greenland, in the summer, they were  driven out of their course to the Hebrides. It was late before they got  fair winds thence, and they remained there far into the summer. Leif  became enamored of a certain woman, whose name was Thorgunna. She was a  woman of fine family, and Leif observed that she was possessed of rare  intelligence. When Leif was preparing for his departure Thorgunna asked to  be permitted to accompany him. Leif inquired whether she had in this the  approval of her kinsmen. She replied that she did not care for it. Leif  responded that he did not deem it the part of wisdom to abduct so  high-born a woman in a strange country, \"and we so few in number.\" \"It is  by no means certain that thou shalt find this to be the better decision,\"  said Thorgunna. \"I shall put it to the proof, notwithstanding,\" said Leif.  \"Then I tell thee,\" said Thorgunna, \"that I am no longer a lone woman, for  I am pregnant, and upon thee I charge it. I foresee that I shall give  birth to a male child. And though thou give this no heed, yet will I rear  the boy, and send him to thee in Greenland, when he shall be fit to take  his place with other men. And I foresee that thou wilt get as much profit  of this son as is thy due from this our parting; moreover, I mean to come  to Greenland myself before the end comes.\" Leif gave her a gold  finger-ring, a Greenland wadmal mantle, and a belt of walrus-tusk. This  boy came to Greenland, and was called Thorgils. Leif acknowledged his  paternity, and some men will have it that this Thorgils came to Iceland in  the summer before the Froda-wonder.[24-2] However, this Thorgils was  afterwards in Greenland, and there seemed to be something not altogether  natural about him before the end came. Leif and his companions sailed  away from the Hebrides, and arrived in Norway in the autumn.[25-1] Leif  went to the court of King Olaf Tryggvason.[25-2] He was well received by  the king, who felt that he could see that Leif was a man of great  accomplishments. Upon one occasion the king came to speech with Leif, and  asks him, \"Is it thy purpose to sail to Greenland in the summer?\" \"It is  my purpose,\" said Leif, \"if it be your will.\" \"I believe it will be well,\"  answers the king, \"and thither thou shalt go upon my errand, to proclaim  Christianity "]]]
