Dupleix now changed his  tactics, and regardless of the injunction which he himself had  obtained from the nawab, he determined to crush the English at Madras.  He supplied the fleet with men and money, and ordered the admiral to  sail for Madras. The fleet arrived before the town on the 14th of  September; landed a portion of its troops, six hundred in number, with  two guns, a short distance along the coast; and on the following day  disembarked the rest, consisting of a thousand French troops, four  hundred Sepoys, and three hundred African troops, and summoned Madras  to surrender.    \"Madras was in no position to offer any effectual resistance. The fort  was weak and indefensible. The English inhabitants consisted only of a  hundred civilians, and two hundred soldiers. Governor Morse  endeavoured to obtain, from the nawab, the protection which he had  before granted to Dupleix, a demand which the nawab at once refused.    \"I was there at the time, and quite agreed with the governor that it  was useless to attempt resistance to the force brought against us. The  governor, therefore, surrendered on the 21st. The garrison, and all  the civilians in the place not in the service of the Company, were to  become prisoners of war; while those in the regular service of the  Company were free to depart, engaging only not to carry arms against  the French until exchanged. These were the official conditions; but La  Bourdonnais, influenced by jealousy of Dupleix, and by the promise of  a bribe of forty thousand pounds, made a secret condition with Mr.  Morse, by which he bound himself to restore Madras in the future, upon  the payment of a large sum of money. This agreement Dupleix, whose  heart was set upon the total expulsion of the English, refused to  ratify.    \"A good many of us considered that, by this breach of the agreement,  we were released from our parole not to carry arms against the French;  and a dozen or so of us, in various disguises, escaped from Madras and  made our way to Fort Saint David, a small English settlement twelve  miles south of Pondicherry. I made the journey with a young fellow  named Clive, who had come out as a writer about two years before. He  was a fine young fellow; as unfitted as you are, I should think,  Marryat, for the dull life of a writer, but full of energy and  courage.    \"At Fort Saint David we found two hundred English soldiers, and a  hundred Sepoys, and a number of us, having nothing to do at our own  work, volunteered to aid in the defence.    \"After Dupleix had conquered Madras, the nawab awoke to the fact of  the danger of allowing the French to become all-powerful, by the  destruction of the English, and ordered Dupleix to restore the place.  Dupleix refused, and the nawab sent his son Maphuz Khan to invest the  town. Dupleix at once despatched a detachment of two hundred and  thirty French, and seven hundred Sepoys, commanded by an engineer  officer named Paradis, to raise the siege.    \"On the 2nd of November, the garrison of Madras sallied out and drove  away the cavalry of Maphuz Khan; and on the 4th, Paradis attacked his  army, and totally defeated it.    \"This, lads, was a memorable battle. It is the first time that  European and Indian soldiers have come into contest, and it shows how  immense is the superiority of Europeans. What Paradis did then opens  all sorts of possibilities for the future; and it may be that either  we or the French are destined to rise, from mere trading companies, to  be rulers of Indian states.    \"Such, I know, is the opinion of young Clive, who is a very  long-headed and ambitious young fellow. I remember his saying to me  one night, when we were, with difficulty, holding our own in the  trenches, that if we had but a man of energy and intelligence at the  head of our affairs in Southern India, we might, ere many years  passed, be masters of the Carnatic. I own that it appears to me more  likely that the French will be in that position, and that we shall not  have a single establishment left there; but time will show.    \"Having defeated Maphuz Khan, Dupleix resolved to make a great effort  to expel us from Fort Saint David, our sole footing left in Southern  India; and he despatched an army of nine hundred Frenchmen, six  hundred Sepoys, and a hundred Africans, with six guns and mortars,  against us. They were four to one against us, and we had hot work, I  can tell you. Four times they tried to storm the place, and each time  we drove them back; till at last they gave it up in disgust, at the  end of June, having besieged us for six months.    \"Soon after this Admiral Boscawen, with a great fleet and an army,  arrived from England; and on 19th of August besieged Pondicherry. The  besieging army was six thousand strong; of whom three thousand, seven  hundred and twenty were English. But Pondicherry resisted bravely, and  after two months the besiegers were forced to retire, having lost, in  attacks or by fever, one thousand and sixty-five men.    \"At the end of the siege, in which I had served as a medical officer,  I returned to England. A few months after I left, peace was made  between England and France, and by its terms Dupleix had to restore  Madras to the English. I hear that fighting has been going on ever  since, the English and French engaging as auxiliaries to rival native  princes; and especially that there was some hot fighting round  Devikota. However, we shall hear about that when we get there.\"    \"And what do you think will be the result of it all, Doctor Rae?\"    \"I think that undoubtedly, sooner or later, either the French or  ourselves will be driven out. Which it will be remains to be seen. If  we are expelled, the effect of our defeat is likely to operate  disastrously at Calcutta, if not at Bombay. The French will be  regarded as a powerful people, whom it is necessary to conciliate,  while we shall be treated as a nation of whom they need have no fear,  and whom they can oppress accordingly.    \"If we are successful, and absolutely obtain possession of the  Carnatic, our trade will vastly increase, fresh posts and commands of  all sorts will be established, and there will be a fine career open to  you young fellows, in the service of the Company.\"    After rounding the Cape of Good Hope, the ship encountered a series of  very heavy gales, which drove her far out of her course up the eastern  coast of Africa. In the last gale her foremast was carried away, and  she put in to a small island to refit. She had also sprung a leak, and  a number of stores were landed, to enable her to be taken up into  shallow water and heeled over, in order that the leak might be got at.    The captain hurried on the work with all speed.    \"Had it not been for this,\" Charlie heard him say to Mr. Ashmead, \"I  would have rigged a jury-mast and proceeded; but I can't stop the leak  from the inside, without shifting a great portion of the cargo, and  our hold is so full that this would be difficult in the extreme. But I  own that I do not like delaying a day longer than necessary, here. The  natives have a very bad reputation, besides which it is suspected that  one, if not more, pirates have their rendezvous in these seas. Several  of our merchantmen have mysteriously disappeared, without any gale  having taken place which would account for their loss.    \"The captain of a ship which reached England, two or three days before  we sailed, brought news that when she was within a fortnight's sail of  the Cape, the sound of guns was heard one night, and that afterwards a  ship was seen on fire, low down on the horizon. He reached the spot  soon after daybreak, and found charred spars and other wreckage; but  though he cruised about all day, he could find no signs of any boats.  Complaints have been made to government, and I hear that there is an  intention of sending two or three sloops out here to hunt the pirates  up. But that will be of no use to us.\"    Upon the day of their arrival at the island, a native sailing boat was  seen to pass across the mouth of the bay. When half across, she  suddenly tacked round and sailed back in the direction from which she  had come.    Before proceeding to lighten the ship, the captain had taken steps to  put himself in a position of defence. For some distance along the  centre of the bay the ground rose abruptly, at a distance of some  thirty yards from the shore, forming a sort of natural terrace. Behind  this a steep hill rose. The terrace, which was forty feet above the  water level, extended for about a hundred yards, when the ground on  either side of the plateau dropped away, as steeply as in front.    The guns were the first things taken out of the ship, and, regardless  of the remonstrances of the passengers at what they considered to be a  waste of time, Captain Thompson had the whole of them taken up on the  terrace. A small battery was thrown up by the sailors, at the two  corners, and in each of these two of the thirty-two pounders were  placed. The broadside guns were ranged in line along the centre of the  terrace.    \"Now,\" the captain said when, at the end of the second day, the  preparations were completed by the transport of a quantity of  ammunition from the ship's magazine to the terrace, \"I feel  comfortable. We can defend ourselves here against all the pirates of  the South Seas. If they don't come, we shall only have lost our two  days' work, and shall have easy minds for the remainder of our stay  here; which we should not have had, if we had been at the mercy of the  first of those scoundrels who happened to hear of our being laid up.\"    The next morning the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18837"],[0,"Commentarii de Bello Gallico (#7)"],[1,"numero potitur. Quibus rebus  coacti Menapii legatos ad eum pacis petendae causa mittunt. Ille  obsidibus acceptis hostium se habiturum numero confirmat, si aut  Ambiorigem aut eius legatos finibus suis recepissent. His confirmatis  rebus Commium Atrebatem cum equitatu custodis loco in Menapiis  relinquit; ipse in Treveros proficiscitur.      7    Dum haec a Caesare geruntur, Treveri magnis coactis peditatus  equitatusque copiis Labienum cum una legione, quae in eorum finibus  hiemaverat, adoriri parabant, iamque ab eo non longius bidui via  aberant, cum duas venisse legiones missu Caesaris cognoscunt. Positis  castris a milibus passuum XV auxilia Germanorum esspectare constituunt.  Labienus hostium cognito consilio sperans temeritate eorum fore aliquam  dimicandi facultatem praesidio quinque cohortium impedimentis relicto  cum viginti quinque cohortibus magnoque equitatu contra hostem  proficiscitur et mille passuum intermisso spatio castra communit. Erat  inter Labienum atque hostem difficili transitu flumen ripisque  praeruptis. Hoc neque ipse transire habebat in animo neque hostes  transituros existi mabat. Augebatur auxiliorum cotidie spes. Loquitur in  concilio palam, quoniam Germani appropinquare dicantur, sese suas  exercitusque fortunas in dubium non devocaturum et postero die prima  luce castra moturum. Celeriter haec ad hostes deferuntur, ut ex magno  Gallorum equitum numero nonnullos Gallicis rebus favere natura cogebat.  Labienus noctu tribunis militum primisque ordinibus convocatis, quid sui  sit consili proponit et, quo facilius hostibus timoris det suspicionem,  maiore strepitu et tumultu, quam populi Romani fert consuetudo castra  moveri iubet. His rebus fugae similem profectionem effecit. Haec quoque  per exploratores ante lucem in tanta propinquitate castrorum ad hostes  deferuntur.      8    Vix agmen novissimum extra munitiones processerat, cum Galli cohortati  inter se, ne speratam praedam ex manibus dimitterent--longum esse per  territis Romanis Germanorum auxilium exspectare, neque suam pati  dignitatem ut tantis copiis tam exiguam manum praesertim fugientem atque  impeditam adoriri non audeant--flumen transire et iniquo loco committere  proelium non dubitant. Quae fore suspicatus Labienus, ut omnes citra  flumen eliceret, eadem usus simulatione itineris placide progrediebatur.  Tum praemissis paulum impedimentis atque in tumulo quodam collocatis  \"Habetis,\" inquit, \"milites, quam petistis facultatem: hostem impedito  atque iniquo loco tenetis: praestate eandem nobis ducibus virtutem, quam  saepe numero imperatori praestitistis, atque illum adesse et haec coram  cernere existimate.\" Simul signa ad hostem converti aciemque dirigi  iubet, et paucis turmis praesidio ad impedimenta dimissis reliquos  equites ad latera disponit. Celeriter nostri clamore sublato pila in  hostes immittunt. Illi, ubi praeter spem quos fugere credebant infestis  signis ad se ire viderunt, impetum modo ferre non potuerunt ac primo  concursu in fugam coniecti proximas silvas petierunt. Quos Labienus  equitatu consectatus, magno numero interfecto, compluribus captis,  paucis post diebus civitatem recepit. Nam Germani qui auxilio veniebant  percepta Treverorum fuga sese domum receperunt. Cum his propinqui  Indutiomari, qui defectionis auctores fuerant, comitati eos ex civitate  excesserunt. Cingetorigi, quem ab initio permansisse in officio  demonstravimus, principatus atque imperium est traditum.      9    Caesar, postquam ex Menapiis in Treveros venit, duabus de causis Rhenum  transire constituit; quarum una erat, quod auxilia contra se Treveris  miseraut, altera, ne ad eos Ambiorix receptum haberet. His constitutis  rebus paulum supra eum locum quo ante exercitum traduxerat facere pontem  instituit. Nota atque instituta ratione magno militum studio paucis  diebus opus efficitur. Firmo in Treveris ad pontem praesidio relicto, ne  quis ab his subito motus oreretur, reliquas copias equitatumque  traducit. Vbii, qui ante obsides dederant atque in deditionem venerant,  purgandi sui causa ad eum legatos mittunt, qui doceant neque auxilia ex  sua civitate in Treveros missa neque ab se fidem laesam: petunt atque  orant ut sibi parcat, ne communi odio Germanorum innocentes pro  nocentibus poenas pendant; si amplius obsidum vellet, dare pollicentur.  Cognita Caesar causa reperit ab Suebis auxilia missa esse; Vbiorum  satisfactionem accipit, aditus viasque in Suebos perquirit.      10    Interim paucis post diebus fit ab Vbiis certior Suebos omnes in unum  locum copias cogere atque eis nationibus quae sub eorum sint imperio  denuntiare, ut auxilia peditatus equitatusque mittant. His cognitis  rebus rem frumentariam providet, castris idoneum locum deligit; Vbiis  imperat ut pecora deducant suaque omnia ex agris in oppida conferant,  sperans barbaros atque imperitos homines inopia cibariorum adductos ad  iniquam pugnandi condicionem posse deduci; mandat, ut crebros  exploratores in Suebos mittant quaeque apud eos gerantur cognoscant.  Illi imperata faciunt et paucis diebus intermissis referunt: Suebos  omnes, posteaquam certiores nuntii de exercitu Romanorum venerint, cum  omnibus suis sociorumque copiis, quas coegissent, penitus ad extremos  fines se recepisse: silvam esse ibi infinita magnitudine, quae  appellatur Bacenis; hanc longe introrsus pertinere et pro nativo muro  obiectam Cheruscos ab Suebis Suebosque ab Cheruscis iniuriis  incursionibusque prohibere: ad eius initium silvae Suebos adventum  Romanorum exspectare constituisse.      11    Quoniam ad hunc locum perventum est, non alienum esse videtur de Galliae  Germaniaeque moribus et quo differant hae nationes inter sese proponere.  In Gallia non solum in omnibus civitatibus atque in omnibus pagis  partibusque, sed paene etiam in singulis domibus factiones sunt,  earumque factionum principes sunt qui summam auctoritatem eorum iudicio  habere existimantur, quorum ad arbitrium iudiciumque summa omnium rerum  consiliorumque redeat. Itaque eius rei causa antiquitus institutum  videtur, ne quis ex plebe contra potentio rem auxili egeret: suos enim  quisque opprimi et circumveniri non patitur, neque, aliter si faciat,  ullam inter suos habet auctoritatem. Haec eadem ratio est in summa  totius Galliae: namque omnes civitates in partes divisae sunt duas.      12    Cum Caesar in Galliam venit, alterius factionis principes erant Aedui,  alterius Sequani. Hi cum per se minus valerent, quod summa auctoritas  antiquitus erat in Aeduis magnaeque eorum erant clientelae, Germanos  atque Ariovistum sibi adiunxerant eosque ad se magnis iacturis  pollicitationibusque perduxerant. Proeliis vero compluribus factis  secundis atque omni nobilitate Aeduorum interfecta tantum potentia  antecesserant, ut magnam partem clientium ab Aeduis ad se traducerent  obsidesque ab eis principum filios acciperent et publice iurare cogerent  nihil se contra Sequanos consili inituros et partem finitimi agri per  vim occupatam possiderent Galliaeque totius principatum obtinerent. Qua  necessitate adductus Diviciacus auxili petendi causa Romam ad senatum  profectus infecta re redierat. Adventu Caesaris facta commutatione  rerum, obsidibus Aeduis redditis, veteribus clientelis restitutis, novis  per Caesarem comparatis, quod hi, qui se ad eorum amicitiam  adgregaverant, meliore condicione atque aequiore imperio se uti  videbant, reliquis rebus eorum gratia dignitateque amplificata Sequani  principatum dimiserant. In eorum locum Remi successerant: quos quod  adaequare apud Caesarem gratia intellegebatur, ei, qui propter veteres  inimicitias nullo modo cum Aeduis coniungi poterant, se Remis in  clientelam dicabant. Hos illi diligenter tuebantur: ita et novam et  repente collectam auctoritatem tene bant. Eo tum statu res erat, ut  longe principes haberentur Aedui, secundum locum dignitatis Remi  obtinerent.      13    In omni Gallia eorum hominum, qui aliquo sunt numero atque honore,  genera sunt duo. Nam plebes paene servorum habetur loco, quae nihil  audet per se, nullo adhibetur consilio. Plerique, cum aut aere alieno  aut magnitudine tributorum aut iniuria potentiorum premuntur, sese in  servitutem dicant nobilibus: in hos eadem omnia sunt iura, quae dominis  in servos. Sed de his duobus generibus alterum est druidum, alterum  equitum. Illi rebus divinis intersunt, sacrificia publica ac privata  procurant, religiones interpretantur: ad hos magnus adulescentium  numerus disciplinae causa concurrit, magnoque hi sunt apud eos honore.  Nam fere de omnibus controversiis publicis privatisque constituunt, et,  si quod est admissum facinus, si caedes facta, si de hereditate, de  finibus controversia est, idem decernunt, praemia poenasque constituunt;  si qui aut privatus aut populus eorum decreto non stetit, sacrificiis  interdicunt. Haec poena apud eos est gravissima. Quibus ita est  interdictum, hi numero impiorum ac sceleratorum habentur, his omnes  decedunt, aditum sermonemque defugiunt, ne quid ex contagione incommodi  accipiant, neque his petentibus ius redditur neque honos ullus  communicatur. His autem omnibus druidibus praeest unus, qui summam inter  eos habet auctoritatem. Hoc mortuo aut si qui ex reliquis excellit  dignitate succedit, aut, si sunt plures pares, suffragio druidum,  nonnumquam etiam armis de principatu contendunt. Hi certo anni tempore  in finibus Carnutum, quae regio totius Galliae media habetur, considunt  in loco consecrato. Huc omnes undique, qui controversias habent,  conveniunt eorumque decretis iudiciisque parent. Disciplina in Britannia  reperta atque inde in Galliam translata esse existimatur, et nunc, qui  diligentius eam rem cognoscere volunt, plerumque illo discendi causa  proficiscuntur.      14    Druides a bello abesse consuerunt neque tributa una cum reliquis  pendunt; militiae vacationem omniumque rerum habent immunitatem. Tantis  excitati praemiis et sua sponte multi in disciplinam conveniunt et a  parentibus propinquisque mittuntur. Magnum ibi numerum versuum"]]]
