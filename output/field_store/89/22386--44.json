In the Tro-Cortesianus frogs are  not uncommon. In 31a there are four (Pl. 7, fig. 1) with water coming  from their mouths. They are characterized by their stout tailless  bodies, flattened heads and toothless mouths. In 101d (Pl. 7, figs. 2,  3) there are two, the first painted blue with spots of darker blue and  the second white and represented as broken in two in the middle. The  signs of death above the latter clearly show that a dead animal is  indicated. Pl. 7, fig. 6, shows the end of Altar O from Copan on which a  frog and a fish are pictured, the former in dorsal view, the latter in  lateral aspect. The peculiar pointed snout of this frog is similar to  that of the frog shown in Pl. 7, fig. 7, also in dorsal view. A somewhat  similar creature (Pl. 29, fig. 6) we have included and though it may  represent an opossum it has little to distinguish it from the figures of  frogs.[309-*]    God B in Tro-Cortesianus 12b should be associated with the frog. His  legs are those of a frog and he appears as if swimming in the water.  Frog in Maya is _Uo_ which is also the name of the second month of the  Maya year. The first day of this month, according to Landa, corresponds  to August 5 of our year and this is the height of the rainy season in  the Maya region. The sign for _Uo_ does not, however, resemble a frog in  any way. The frog above one of the figures in the Lower Chamber of the  Temple of the Tigers at Chichen Itza (Pl. 7, fig. 7) has clearly some  relation to the name or totem of the warrior. The Nahua custom is seen  here.    Toads are probably intended in Pl. 7, figs. 4, 5. In these the great  breadth of the head and mouth together with the short inflated body  combine to produce a very toad-like appearance. It is not unlikely that  they represent the huge marine toad, _Bufo marinus_, common from  southern Mexico to Brazil and in the West Indies. There seems to be no  distinction in the treatment of frogs and toads in the codices.    TREE-TOAD (_Hyla eximia_). Of great interest are the figures in  Tro-Cortesianus 26a and b (Pl. 8, figs. 1, 3), showing a god with  expanded finger tips and characterized further by the presence of two  parallel black stripes from the hinder and lower margins of the eye  respectively. The knob-like finger tips at once suggest one of the  tree-toads, and the presence of the two lines seems to indicate _Hyla  eximia_ as the species represented. In this tree-toad there is a long  black lateral line running posteriorly from the tympanum and above it a  shorter line just as in the drawings. It appears to be a common species  in the valley of Mexico though but little seems to have been written of  its habits. At the beginning of the rainy season it repairs to pools of  water to breed and is then very noticeable from its loud voice. No doubt  its importance in the Maya economy was from its conspicuousness at the  beginning of the rainy period. This fact is brought out more strongly  when we consider that these gods representing the tree-toad are  associated with agriculture and the sowing of grain at the beginning of  the rainy season. Foerstemann (1902, p. 35) identifies these figures as  god F. They are quite unlike the usual representation of this god and  are clearly god P as Schellhas (1904, p. 39) indicates. It is  interesting to note that the two black lines behind the eye are also  seen in the other gods shown in Tro-Cortesianus 26a and b although the  knob-like finger tips are lacking. The glyph for this tree-toad god is  recognized in the fifth place at the top of the same page (Pl. 8, fig.  2) by the same two black lines under and behind the eye.      REPTILIA    SERPENT. It would be impossible in the present paper to enter into any  lengthy discussion of the use of the serpent (Maya _kan_) in Mexico and  Central America. It seems to be one of the main elements in the religion  and consequently in the art of the Mayas and Mexican peoples. It is  represented again and again in many forms and varied combinations. It  underlies the whole general trend of Maya art. The serpent is often  associated with feathers. The culture hero of the Nahuas,  _Quetzalcoatl_ (feathered serpent) corresponds to a similar god among  the Mayas, _Kukulcan_ (also meaning feathered serpent). The feathers of  the quetzal are the ones commonly used in connection with the serpent.    Any attempt at identification of the species represented is beset by  grave difficulties for so conventionalized have the figures often become  that, except in the case of the rattlesnake with its rattles, there are  no characteristic marks by which the species may be known. It is natural  to suppose that the species used for artistic purposes would be those  that are most noteworthy because of their size, coloring, or venomous  qualities. No doubt a number of harmless species were also used in the  religious ceremonies.[311-*] Such may be those used as hair ornaments in  many of the figures (Pl. 8, figs. 7-13, 15) and in which no indication  of a rattle is to be seen. The fierce eye of these reptiles is shown by  means of an exaggerated overhanging brow occasionally embellished by  recurved crests (Pl. 8, figs. 10, 11, 13, 15). These crests are  sometimes shown as two or three stalked knobs (Pl. 10, fig. 7) that  Stempell was misled into identifying as the eyes of snails. Various  heads of snakes usually with fangs exposed and tongue protruding are  pictured in Pl. 8, figs. 4, 6; Pl. 9, figs. 2, 4-6: one snake with a  spiny back is shown in Pl. 8, fig. 5, but obviously it represents merely  the artist's endeavor to present as terrifying a creature as possible.    Various types of rattlesnakes are shown in Pl. 9. The presence of the  rattle is of course the characteristic, and this portion alone is  likewise used, in one case, at least, as a glyph (Pl. 9, fig. 7). It  cannot be denied, however, that some or most of the snakes in which no  rattles appear, are nevertheless intended for rattlers. It may have been  that the figures were so well understood that the addition of rattles in  the drawings was quite unnecessary. This, however, is quite conjectural.  The species of rattlesnake is probably _Crotalus basiliscus_ or _C.  terrificus_ of southern Mexico and adjacent regions, not _C. horridus_  or _adamanteus_ as supposed by Stempell since these two species are  confined to the United States. Among the figures shown on Pl. 9, it is  noteworthy that five of the rattlesnakes show no fangs. Some are  spotted, but in a wholly arbitrary manner. Three are unmarked. One is  shown coiled about the base of a tree (Pl. 9, fig. 5), another coiled  ready to strike though the rattle is pictured trailing on the ground  instead of being held erect in the center of the coil as usually is done  (Pl. 9, fig. 9). A rattlesnake is shown held in the hand of a man in Pl.  9, fig. 8.    In Pl. 10, fig. 1, is shown a rattle-less snake with prominent fang,  coiled about the top of an altar which may represent a tree or bush.  From the latter fact, it might be concluded that it was a tree or  bush-inhabiting species, possibly the deadly \"bush-master\" (_Lachesis  lanceolatus_). Other figures (Pl. 10, figs. 3, 7; Pl. 11, figs. 1, 2)  are introduced here as examples of the curious head ornamentation  frequently found in the drawings. The two first are merely serpents with  the jaws extended to the utmost, and with a characteristic head  decoration. The last is provided with an elaborate crest. The size and  markings of the two serpents shown in Pl. 11, as well as their want of  rattles suggest that they may represent some species of large _Boidae_  as _Loxocemus bicolor_ or _Boa_ (sp?).    After having commented upon the various serpents occurring in the  codices and in several other places, we will now take up the manner and  connection in which the various figures occur. We shall pass over  completely the use of the \"serpent column\" at Chichen Itza, the  importance of the serpent motive in the development of the masked panel  as worked out by Spinden, and the countless representations of the  plumed serpent in the whole field of Maya design and decoration. In the  single Temple of the Tigers at Chichen Itza, the feathered serpent  occurs in the round as a column decoration supporting the portico, as  carved on the wooden lintel at the entrance to the Painted Chamber,  again and again on the frescoes of this room,[313-*] in the Lower  Chamber as dividing the bas-relief into zones or panels, and, finally,  as the center of the whole composition of this bas-relief. It will be  seen, therefore, that it will be necessary in a short paper, to limit  ourselves to the representations of the serpent in the Maya codices.    The serpent is most frequently associated with god B. Schellhas (1904,  p. 17), Fewkes (1894), Foerstemann (1906), and Thomas (1882), seem to  agree that god B is to be identified as _Kukulcan_, the most important  of the deities of the Mayas and, as pointed out before, appearing in the  Nahua mythology, as _Quetzalcoatl_, and in the Quiche myths as  _Gucumatz_. It was also noted that the name means both in Maya and in  Nahuatl, the \"feathered serpent\" or the \"bird serpent.\" Other  authorities consider god B as _Itzamna_, another of the main gods of the  Mayas. Seler interprets god B as the counterpart of the Nahua rain god,  _Tlaloc_. It is certain that when god B and the serpent are associated  together water and rain are usually indicated. God H, \"the _Chicchan_  god,\" also has some relation to the serpent. As pointed out by Schellhas  (1904, pp. 28-30), this god often appears characterized by a skin-spot  or a scale of the serpent on his temple of the same shape as the  hieroglyph of the day _Chicchan_ (serpent). The glyph belonging to this  deity also shows the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1906"],[0,"Erewhon; Or, Over the Range (#7)"],[1,"rouble, though I eventually managed to avoid it.  By about three or  four o'clock I found myself on the river-bed.    From calculations which I made as to the height of the valley on the  other side the saddle over which I had come, I concluded that the saddle  itself could not be less than nine thousand feet high; and I should think  that the river-bed, on to which I now descended, was three thousand feet  above the sea-level.  The water had a terrific current, with a fall of  not less than forty to fifty feet per mile.  It was certainly the river  next to the northward of that which flowed past my master's run, and  would have to go through an impassable gorge (as is commonly the case  with the rivers of that country) before it came upon known parts.  It was  reckoned to be nearly two thousand feet above the sea-level where it came  out of the gorge on to the plains.    As soon as I got to the river side I liked it even less than I thought I  should.  It was muddy, being near its parent glaciers.  The stream was  wide, rapid, and rough, and I could hear the smaller stones knocking  against each other under the rage of the waters, as upon a seashore.  Fording was out of the question.  I could not swim and carry my swag, and  I dared not leave my swag behind me.  My only chance was to make a small  raft; and that would be difficult to make, and not at all safe when it  was made,--not for one man in such a current.    As it was too late to do much that afternoon, I spent the rest of it in  going up and down the river side, and seeing where I should find the most  favourable crossing.  Then I camped early, and had a quiet comfortable  night with no more music, for which I was thankful, as it had haunted me  all day, although I perfectly well knew that it had been nothing but my  own fancy, brought on by the reminiscence of what I had heard from  Chowbok and by the over-excitement of the preceding evening.    Next day I began gathering the dry bloom stalks of a kind of flag or iris-  looking plant, which was abundant, and whose leaves, when torn into  strips, were as strong as the strongest string.  I brought them to the  waterside, and fell to making myself a kind of rough platform, which  should suffice for myself and my swag if I could only stick to it.  The  stalks were ten or twelve feet long, and very strong, but light and  hollow.  I made my raft entirely of them, binding bundles of them at  right angles to each other, neatly and strongly, with strips from the  leaves of the same plant, and tying other rods across.  It took me all  day till nearly four o'clock to finish the raft, but I had still enough  daylight for crossing, and resolved on doing so at once.    I had selected a place where the river was broad and comparatively still,  some seventy or eighty yards above a furious rapid.  At this spot I had  built my raft.  I now launched it, made my swag fast to the middle, and  got on to it myself, keeping in my hand one of the longest blossom  stalks, so that I might punt myself across as long as the water was  shallow enough to let me do so.  I got on pretty well for twenty or  thirty yards from the shore, but even in this short space I nearly upset  my raft by shifting too rapidly from one side to the other.  The water  then became much deeper, and I leaned over so far in order to get the  bloom rod to the bottom that I had to stay still, leaning on the rod for  a few seconds.  Then, when I lifted up the rod from the ground, the  current was too much for me and I found myself being carried down the  rapid.  Everything in a second flew past me, and I had no more control  over the raft; neither can I remember anything except hurry, and noise,  and waters which in the end upset me.  But it all came right, and I found  myself near the shore, not more than up to my knees in water and pulling  my raft to land, fortunately upon the left bank of the river, which was  the one I wanted.  When I had landed I found that I was about a mile, or  perhaps a little less, below the point from which I started.  My swag was  wet upon the outside, and I was myself dripping; but I had gained my  point, and knew that my difficulties were for a time over.  I then lit my  fire and dried myself; having done so I caught some of the young ducks  and sea-gulls, which were abundant on and near the river-bed, so that I  had not only a good meal, of which I was in great want, having had an  insufficient diet from the time that Chowbok left me, but was also well  provided for the morrow.    I thought of Chowbok, and felt how useful he had been to me, and in how  many ways I was the loser by his absence, having now to do all sorts of  things for myself which he had hitherto done for me, and could do  infinitely better than I could.  Moreover, I had set my heart upon making  him a real convert to the Christian religion, which he had already  embraced outwardly, though I cannot think that it had taken deep root in  his impenetrably stupid nature.  I used to catechise him by our camp  fire, and explain to him the mysteries of the Trinity and of original  sin, with which I was myself familiar, having been the grandson of an  archdeacon by my mother's side, to say nothing of the fact that my father  was a clergyman of the English Church.  I was therefore sufficiently  qualified for the task, and was the more inclined to it, over and above  my real desire to save the unhappy creature from an eternity of torture,  by recollecting the promise of St. James, that if any one converted a  sinner (which Chowbok surely was) he should hide a multitude of sins.  I  reflected, therefore, that the conversion of Chowbok might in some degree  compensate for irregularities and short-comings in my own previous life,  the remembrance of which had been more than once unpleasant to me during  my recent experiences.    Indeed, on one occasion I had even gone so far as to baptize him, as well  as I could, having ascertained that he had certainly not been both  christened and baptized, and gathering (from his telling me that he had  received the name William from the missionary) that it was probably the  first-mentioned rite to which he had been subjected.  I thought it great  carelessness on the part of the missionary to have omitted the second,  and certainly more important, ceremony which I have always understood  precedes christening both in the case of infants and of adult converts;  and when I thought of the risks we were both incurring I determined that  there should be no further delay.  Fortunately it was not yet twelve  o'clock, so I baptized him at once from one of the pannikins (the only  vessels I had) reverently, and, I trust, efficiently.  I then set myself  to work to instruct him in the deeper mysteries of our belief, and to  make him, not only in name, but in heart a Christian.    It is true that I might not have succeeded, for Chowbok was very hard to  teach.  Indeed, on the evening of the same day that I baptized him he  tried for the twentieth time to steal the brandy, which made me rather  unhappy as to whether I could have baptized him rightly.  He had a prayer-  book--more than twenty years old--which had been given him by the  missionaries, but the only thing in it which had taken any living hold  upon him was the title of Adelaide the Queen Dowager, which he would  repeat whenever strongly moved or touched, and which did really seem to  have some deep spiritual significance to him, though he could never  completely separate her individuality from that of Mary Magdalene, whose  name had also fascinated him, though in a less degree.    He was indeed stony ground, but by digging about him I might have at any  rate deprived him of all faith in the religion of his tribe, which would  have been half way towards making him a sincere Christian; and now all  this was cut off from me, and I could neither be of further spiritual  assistance to him nor he of bodily profit to myself: besides, any company  was better than being quite alone.    I got very melancholy as these reflections crossed me, but when I had  boiled the ducks and eaten them I was much better.  I had a little tea  left and about a pound of tobacco, which should last me for another  fortnight with moderate smoking.  I had also eight ship biscuits, and,  most precious of all, about six ounces of brandy, which I presently  reduced to four, for the night was cold.    I rose with early dawn, and in an hour I was on my way, feeling strange,  not to say weak, from the burden of solitude, but full of hope when I  considered how many dangers I had overcome, and that this day should see  me at the summit of the dividing range.    After a slow but steady climb of between three and four hours, during  which I met with no serious hindrance, I found myself upon a tableland,  and close to a glacier which I recognised as marking the summit of the  pass.  Above it towered a succession of rugged precipices and snowy  mountain sides.  The solitude was greater than I could bear; the mountain  upon my master's sheep-run was a crowded thoroughfare in comparison with  this sombre sullen place.  The air, moreover, was dark and heavy, which  made the loneliness even more oppressive.  There was an inky gloom over  all that was not covered with snow and ice.  Grass there was none.    Each moment I felt increasing upon me that dreadful doubt as to my own  identity--as to the continuity of my past and present existence--which is  the first sign of that distraction which comes on those who have lost  themselves in the bush.  I had fought against this feeling hitherto, and  had conquered it; but the intense silence and gloom of this rocky  wilderness were too much for me, and I felt that my power of collecting  myself was beginning to be impaired.    I rested for a little while, and then advanced over very rough ground,  until I reached the lower end of the glacier.  Then I saw another  glacier, descending"]]]
