A new party, the Christian Socialists, took their place; force gave  way to union and co-operation. A new champion, Charles Kingsley, or  'Parson Lot,' stood forth as the Chartist leader.    The hard winter and general distress of the year 1848 nearly provoked  another rising, and in his novel entitled _Yeast_ Kingsley pictures  the 'condition of England' question as it appeared to one who knew  it from the seamy side. Especially did he blame the Church, which,  he said, offered a religion for \"Jacob, the smooth man,\" and was not  suited for \"poor Esau.\" This was indeed most true as regards the  agricultural classes, where the want was felt of a real religion  which should gain a hold upon a population which year by year was  fast drifting loose from all ties of morality and Christianity.    The peasantry, once the mainstay of England and now trodden down and  neglected, cannot rise alone and without help from those above them.  \"What right have we to keep them down? . . . What right have we to  say that they shall know no higher recreation than the hogs, because,  forsooth, if we raised them they might refuse to work--_for us_? Are  _we_ to fix how far their minds may be developed? Has not God fixed  it for us, when He gave them the same passions, talents, tastes, as  our own?\"    The farm labourer, unlike his brothers in the North, had no spirit  left to strike. His sole enjoyment--such as it was--consisted in  recalling \"'the glorious times before the war . . . when there was  more food than there were mouths, and more work than were hands.'    \"'I say, vather,' drawled out some one, 'they say there's a sight  more money in England now than there was afore the war-time.'    \"'Ees, booy,' said the old man, 'but _it's got into too few hands_.'\"    The system of 'sweating' among the London tailors had grown to such  an extent that Kingsley was determined, if possible, to put an end  to it, and with this purpose in view he wrote _Cheap Clothes and  Nasty_.    The Government itself, he declares, does nothing to prevent  sweating; the workmen declare that \"Government contract work is the  worst of all, and the starved-out and sweated-out tailor's last  resource . . . there are more clergymen among the customers than any  other class; and often we have to work at home upon the Sunday at  their clothes in order to get a living.\"    He followed this up with _Alton Locke_, dealing especially with the  life and conditions of work of the journeymen tailors, and the  Chartist riots. Both sides receive some hard knocks, for Kingsley  was a born fighter, and his courage and fearlessness won him many  friends, even among the most violent of the Chartists.    The character of Alton Locke was probably drawn from life, and was  intended to be William Lovett, at one time a leader in the Chartist  ranks. After a long fight with poverty, when he frequently went  without a meal in order to save the money necessary for his education,  he rose to a position of some influence. He was one of the first to  propose that museums and public galleries should be opened on Sundays,  for he declared that most of the intemperance and vice was owing to  the want of wholesome and rational recreation. He insisted that it  was necessary to create a moral, sober, and thinking working-class  in order to enable them to carry through the reforms for which they  were struggling. Disgust with the violent methods of many of his  associates caused him at last to withdraw from their ranks.    Kingsley looked up to Carlyle as his master, to whom he owed more  than to any other man. \"Of the general effect,\" he said, \"which his  works had upon me, I shall say nothing: it was the same as they have  had, thank God, on thousands of my class and every other.\"    When, finally, violent methods proved of no avail and the Chartist  party dissolved, the democratic movement took a fresh lease of life.  As Carlyle had already pointed out, the question of the people was  a 'knife and fork' question--that is to say, so long as taxes were  levied upon the necessities of life, the poorer classes, who could  least of all afford to pay, would become poorer.    Sir Robert Peel was the first to remove this injustice, by  substituting a tax upon income for the hundred and one taxes which  had pressed so heavily upon the poor. Manufacturers were now able  to buy their raw materials at a lower price, and need no longer pay  such low wages to keep up their profits.    In 1845 Peel went a step farther, and in order to relieve the famine  in Ireland, he removed the duty on corn. Thus, since corn could now  be imported free, bread became cheaper.    The Corn Law Repealers had fought for years to bring this about. Their  leader and poet, Ebenezer Elliott, declared that \"what they wanted  was bread in exchange for their cottons, woollens, and hardware, and  no other thing can supply the want of that one thing, any more than  water could supply the want of air in the Black Hole of Calcutta.\"  Bad government          Is the deadly will that takes      What Labour ought to keep,      It is the deadly power that makes      Bread dear and Labour cheap.    It was not until there had been many riots and much bloodshed that  the Irish Famine forced Peel at last to give way.    A third party of reformers were working for the same end. This was  the 'Young England' party, whose leader was Disraeli, a rising young  politician. By birth a Jew, he had joined the English Church and the  ranks of the Tory party. His early works are chiefly sketches of  social and political life and are not concerned with the 'question  of the People.' He took as his motto the words Shakespeare puts into  Ancient Pistol's mouth,        Why, then the world's mine oyster,      Which I with sword will open,    thus showing at an early age that he had a firm belief in his own  powers. From the beginning of his career he never hesitated in  championing the cause of the People, and declared that \"he was not  afraid or ashamed to say that he wished more sympathy had been shown  on both sides towards the Chartists.\"    The people had begun to look upon the upper classes as their  oppressors, who were living in comfort upon the profits wrung from  their poorer brethren.    Thomas Cooper in his Autobiography describes the reckless and  irreligious spirit which continued poverty was creating among the  half-starved weavers:    \"'Let us be patient a little longer, lads, surely God Almighty will  help us.' 'Talk no more about thy Goddle Mighty,' was the sneering  reply; 'there isn't one. If there _was_ one, He wouldn't let us suffer  as we do.'\"    The Chartists were opposed to the Anti-Corn Law party, for they  thought that the cry of 'cheap bread' meant simply 'low wages,' and  was a trap set to catch them unawares.    The Young England party believed in themselves as the leaders of a  movement which should save England through its youth. They were,  however, known in Parliament in their early days as \"young gentlemen  who wore white waistcoats and wrote spoony poetry.\"    'Young England' wished for a return of the feudal relations between  the nobility and their vassals; the nobles and the Church, as in olden  days, were to stretch out a helping hand to the poor, to feed the  hungry, and succour the distressed. National customs were to be  revived, commerce and art were to be fostered by wealthy patrons.  The Crown was once more to be in touch with the people. \"If Royalty  did but condescend to lower itself to a familiarity with the people,  it is curious that they will raise, exalt, and adore it, sometimes  even invest it with divine and mysterious attributes. If, on the  contrary, it shuts itself up in an august seclusion, it will be mocked  and caricatured . . . if the great only knew what stress the poor  lay by the few forms that remain, to join them they would make many  sacrifices for their maintenance and preservation.\"[6]    [Footnote 6: George Smythe, Viscount Strangford, _Historic  Fancies_.]    It was to lay the views of his party and himself before the public  that Disraeli published the three novels, _Coningsby_, _Sybil_, and  _Tancred_. _Coningsby_ deals with the political parties of that time,  and is full of thinly-disguised portraits of people then living;  _Sybil_, from which a quotation is given elsewhere, is a study of  life among the working-classes; _Tancred_ discusses what part the  Church should take in the government of the people.    Though the life of the 'Young England' party was short, it succeeded  by means of agitation in and out of Parliament in calling public  attention to the harshness of the New Poor Law and the need for social  reform.    Carlyle was again the writer who influenced the young Disraeli, for  the latter saw that to accomplish anything of real value he must form  his own party and break loose from the worn-out beliefs and  prejudices of both political parties. Though in later days he will  be remembered as a statesman rather than as a novelist, it is  necessary to study those three books in order to understand what  England and the English were in Victoria's early years.    Each of these Reform parties had rendered signal service in their  own fashion: Church, Government, and People were no longer disunited,  distinctions of class had been broken down, and with their  disappearance Chartism came to an end. The failure of the \"physical  force\" Chartists in 1848 had served to enforce the lesson taught by  Carlyle and Kingsley, that the way to gain reform was not through  deeds of violence and bloodshed. Each man must learn to fit himself  for his part in the great movement toward Reform. Intelligence, not  force, must be their weapon.    After years of bitter strife between the Two Nations, England a last  enjoyed peace within her own borders--that peace which a patriot poet,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16972"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 711, August 17, 1889 (#7)"],[1," of the same section  varies with the rapidity of current changes, owing to the conduction  being uneven.    The uneven distribution of current, or its tendency to flow on the  outer parts of a conductor when the rate of variation or alternation  is made great, is in itself a consequence of the fact that less energy  is transferred into magnetism in this case than when the current flows  uniformly over the section, or is concentrated at the center. In other  words, when a uniform current traverses a conductor of the same  section, the circular magnetism, or surrounding magnetic lines, are to  be found not only outside the conductor, but also beneath its  exterior. Since in forming these lines on passage of current the  middle of section would be surrounded by more lines than any other  part of the conductor, the current tends to keep out of that part and  move nearer the exterior in greater amount. Hence, in rapidly  alternating currents the conductor section is practically lessened,  being restricted largely to the outer metal of the conductor. If the  round conductor, Fig. 2, were made of iron, the magnetism interior to  it and set up by a current in it would be very much greater, the  section of the conductor being filled with magnetic circuits or lines  around the center. The total magnetism, external and internal, would  be much greater in this case for a given current flow, and the energy  absorbed and given out in formation and loss of field or the  self-induction would be much increased. This could, however, be  greatly diminished by slitting the conductor radially or making it of  a number of separate wires out of lateral magnetic contact one with  the other, Fig. 3. In these cases the resistance of the interior  magnetic circuits would be increased, as there would be several breaks  in the continuity around the center of the conductor. The total  magnetism which could be set up by a current would be lessened, and  the self-induction, therefore, lessened.    [Illustration: Fig. 2.]    [Illustration: Fig. 3.]    The moment we begin the bringing of iron into proximity with an  electric conductor conveying current, we provide a better medium for  the flow or development of magnetic lines or circuits. In other words,  the lines may then be longer, yet equally intense, or more lines may  be crowded into a section of this metal than in air or space. Figs.  4a, 4b, 4c show the effect brought about by bringing iron of  different forms near to the conductor.    [Illustration: Fig. 4a.]    [Illustration: Fig. 4b.]    [Illustration: Fig. 4c.]    It shows, in other words, the development of the ordinary  electro-magnet of the horseshoe form, and the concentration of the  lines in the better medium. The lines also tend to shorten and  diminish the resistance to their passage, so that attraction of the  iron to the conductor takes place, and if there is more than one piece  of iron, they tend to string themselves around the conductor in  magnetic contact with one another.    When copper bars of 1 inch diameter are traversed by currents of  40,000 to 60,000 amperes, as in welding them, the magnetic forces just  referred to become so enormous that very heavy masses of iron brought  up to the bar are firmly held, even though the current be of an  alternating character, changing direction many times a second.    [Illustration: Fig. 5]    [Illustration: Fig. 6]    When a conductor is surrounded by a cast iron ring, as in Fig. 5, the  current in such conductor has an excellent magnetic medium surrounding  it. A large amount of energy is then abstracted on the first impulse  of current, which goes to develop strong and dense magnetic lines  through the iron ring and across the gap in it. On taking off the  current the energy is returned as extra current, and its force is many  times what would be found with air alone surrounding the conductor. We  have then greatly increased the self-induction, the storing of energy  and opposition to current flow at the beginning, the giving back of  energy and assistance to the current flow on attempting to remove or  stop the current. Let us now complete the ring, by making it of iron,  endless, Fig. 6, with the conductor in the middle.    We now find that on passing current through the conductor it meets  with a very strong opposing effect or counter potential. The evolution  of magnetic lines, or the opening out of magnetic circuits, goes on at  a very rapid rate. Each line or magnetic circuit evolved, and cutting  the conductor, flies at once outward, and locates itself in the iron  ring. This ring can carry innumerable lines, and they do not crowd one  another. It permits the lines even to lengthen in reaching it, and  yet, on account of its low resistance to their passage, the  lengthening is equivalent to their having shortened in other media. We  will suppose the current not sufficient to exhaust this peculiar  capacity for lines which the iron has. Equilibrium is reached, the  conductor has opened up innumerable closed circuits, and caused them  to exist in the ring still closed; but in iron, not space or ether  merely. The current passing has continued its action and storage of  energy until to emit another line in view of the resistance now found  in the crowded iron ring is impossible.    Now let us cut off the current. We are surprised to find a very weak  extra current, a practical absence of self-induction on breaking, or,  at least, a giving out of energy in nowise comparable to that on  making. Let us put on the current as it was before. Another curious  result. But little self-induction now on making energy not absorbed.    Now cut off the current again. Same effect as before. Now let us put  on the current reversed in direction. At once we find a very strong  counter potential or opposing self-induction developed.    The ring had been polarized, or retained its magnetic energy, and we  are now taking out one set of lines and putting in reversely polarized  lines of force. This done, we break the reversed current without much  effect of self-induction. The ring remains polarized and inert until  an opposite flow of current be sent through. Iron is then a different  medium from the ether.    The ring once magnetized must, in losing its magnetism, permit a  closure of the lines by shortening. This involves their passage from  the iron across the space in the center of the ring, notwithstanding  its great resistance to the lines of force. As passage from iron to  air is equivalent to lengthening of the lines, it is readily seen that  such lengthening may oppose more effect than a slight shortening due  to leaving iron, for air or space may give in provoking a closure and  disappearance of the lines. Looked at from another standpoint, the  lines on the iron may actually require a small amount of initial  energy to dislodge them therefrom, so that after being dislodged they  may collapse and yield whatever energy they represent.    I must reserve for the future further consideration of the iron ring,  but in thinking upon this matter I am led to think that the production  of a magnetic line in an iron ring around a conductor may represent a  sort of wave of energy, an absorption of energy on the evolution of  the line from the conductor, and a slight giving out of energy on the  line reaching that position of proximity to the iron ring, that its  passage thereto may be said to be a shortening process or a lessening  of its resistance.    The magnetism in air, gases, and non-magnetic bodies, being assumed to  be that of the ether, this medium shows no such effects as those we  get with the ring. It does not become permanently polarized, as does  even soft iron under the condition of a closed ring. The iron  possesses coercive force, or magnetic rigidity, and a steel ring would  show more of it. The molecules of the iron or steel take a set. If we  were to cut the soft iron ring, or separate it in any way, this  introduction of resistance of air for ether in the magnetic circuit  would cause the lines to collapse and set up a current in the  conductor. The energy of the ring would have been restored to the  latter. The curious thing is that physically the polarized ring does  not present any different appearance or ordinary properties different  from those of a plain ring, and will not deflect a compass needle. Its  condition is discoverable, however, by the test of self-induction to  currents of different direction. As a practical consideration, we may  mention in this connection that a self-inductive coil for currents of  one direction must be constructed differently from one to be used with  alternating currents. The former must have in its magnetic circuit a  section of air or the like, or be an imperfectly closed circuit, as it  were. The latter should have as perfectly closed a magnetic circuit as  can be made. We see here also the futility of constructing a Ruhmkorff  core coil on the closed iron magnetic circuit plan, because the  currents in the primary are interrupted, not reversed.    The considerations just put forward in relation to the closed iron  ring, and its passive character under the condition of becoming  polarized, are more important than at first appears. It has been found  that the secondary current wave of a closed iron circuit induction  coil or transformer, whose primary circuit receives alternating  current, is lagged from its theoretical position of 90 degrees behind  the primary wave an additional 90 degrees, so that the phases of the  two currents are directly opposed; or the secondary current working  lamps only in its circuit is one half a wave length behind a primary,  instead of a quarter wave length, as might have been expected.    But when it is understood that the iron core polarized in one  direction by the primary impulse does not begin to lose its magnetism  when that impulse simply weakens, but waits until an actual reversal  of"]]]
