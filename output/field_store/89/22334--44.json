The heads of _Sporobolus cryptandrus strictus_  are retained to a great extent within the leaf sheaths. This  necessitates the cutting of the stems into suitable lengths for  carrying, and the stored material appears to be merely cut sections of  the stems. Close examination, however, discloses the heads within, and  shows that as in other instances seed storage is the end sought. These  pieces are packed beautifully parallel like so many matches, and vary  from a minimum length of 20 to a maximum of 37 millimeters, averaging  about 30. Count of 2 grams of the above _Sporobolus_ material shows that  there are 125 separate cut sections per gram, or a total of  approximately 680,000 pieces in this one lot of storage, indicating a  remarkable activity on the part of the individual rat (Pl. VIII, Fig.  1).      [Illustration: PLATE VII.
