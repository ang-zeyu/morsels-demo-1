Serve with strawberry, orange or  pineapple marmalade.      SALLY LUNNS    Sally Lunns are made from a drop batter and are usually baked in deep  layer-cake pans. To serve cut in wedge-shaped pieces--like pie--and  then split and butter and cover with a napkin. Serve at once.    Place in a bowl      One-half cupful sugar,    Four tablespoonfuls shortening.

SOUTHERN SPOON BREAD    The success of making and baking this delicacy depends entirely upon  a thorough beating of the batter and a hot oven. The southern mammy  invariably uses the coarse white oatmeal, but you may use the yellow  and obtain just as good results.    Place one quart of boiling water in a saucepan and then add one  teaspoonful of salt, two tablespoonfuls of shortening and one and  one-half cupfuls of cornmeal. Pour the meal in slowly, and just as  soon as it boils remove from the fire and let cool.

SCONES    Scones are delicious hot breads that are served for breakfast in the  British Isles; they replace the American pancake and for tea replace  our hot biscuits. Many varieties of scones are made in Scotland.  Currants, citron and raisins are used in the dough, while in other  parts of the United Kingdom these cakes are split, buttered and served  with marmalade or gooseberry jam.      DELICIOUS ENGLISH SCONES    Place in a mixing bowl      Four cups of sifted flour,    Two tablespoons of baking powder,    Two level tablespoons of sugar,    One-half teaspoon of salt.    Rub between the hands to thoroughly mix and then rub into the flour  five level tablespoonfuls of shortening. Now beat up an egg and then  add one-half of the beaten egg to one and one-fourth cups of milk.  Beat to mix. Use this to make a soft dough. Turn on a lightly floured  baking board and knead for three minutes. Now divide into five pieces  and mould each piece round like a saucer, and cut each way, making  four wedge-shaped pieces; place on a well-greased baking sheet and  brush with the remaining half of the egg, and bake in a hot oven for  fifteen minutes.      SCOTCH SCONES    Place in a mixing bowl      Five cups of flour,    One and one-half teaspoons salt,    Three level tablespoons baking powder,    One-half cup of sugar.

Divide into six pieces and then roll out the size of a saucer and  about three-quarters of an inch thick. Make two cuts forming a cross,  dividing the dough into four wedge-shaped pieces. Brush with beaten  egg and bake for fifteen minutes in a hot oven. This amount will make  twenty-four scones. To serve, split and fill with jam and then pile on  a wicker basket, cover with a napkin and serve with tea.      IRISH SCONES      Three cups of mashed potatoes,    Three cups of sifted flour,    Two teaspoons of salt,    Two level teaspoons of baking powder,    Three level teaspoons of shortening.    Now place in a bowl      One-half cup of milk,    One egg.    Beat. Use about two-thirds of the egg and milk mixture to form a  dough. Knead the dough to a smooth mixture and then divide into four  parts. Pat or roll out like a saucer and then make two cuts to form  the cross, cutting into four pieces. Brush with part of egg and milk  mixture and then place on a baking sheet and bake in a hot oven for  eighteen minutes."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17440"],[0,"Amadis of Gaul, an opera (#7)"],[1,"Italic and Roman type; in this  e-text, longer passages were left unmarked to minimize confusion.
