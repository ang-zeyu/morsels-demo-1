But they say that the Orang is more than a  match for his enemy, and beats him to death, or rips up his throat by  pulling the jaws asunder!    Much of what has been here stated was probably derived by Dr. Mueller  from the reports of his Dyak hunters; but a large male, four feet  high, lived in captivity under his observation for a month, and  receives a very bad character.    \"He was a very wild beast,\" says Mueller, \"of prodigious strength, and  false and wicked to the last degree. If any one approached he rose up  slowly with a low growl, fixed his eyes in the direction in which he  meant to make his attack, slowly passed his hand between the bars of  his cage, and then, extending his long arm, gave a sudden  grip--usually at the face.\" He never tried to bite (though Orangs will  bite one another), his great weapons of offence and defence being his  hands.    His intelligence was very great; and Mueller remarks that, though the  faculties of the Orang have been estimated too highly, yet Cuvier, had  he seen this specimen, would not have considered its intelligence to  be only a little higher than that of a dog.    His hearing was very acute, but the sense of vision seemed to be less  perfect. The under lip was the great organ of touch, and played a very  important part in drinking, being thrust out like a trough, so as  either to catch the falling rain or to receive the contents of the  half cocoanut shell full of water with which the Orang was supplied,  and which, in drinking, he poured into the trough thus formed.    In Borneo, the Orang-Utan of the Malays goes by the name of \"_Mias_\"  among the Dyaks, who distinguish several kinds as _Mias Pappan_, or  _Zimo_, _Mias Kassu_, and _Mias Rambi_. Whether these are distinct  species, however, or whether they are mere races, and how far any of  them are identical with the Sumatran Orang, as Mr. Wallace thinks the  Mias Pappan to be, are problems which are at present undecided; and  the variability of these great apes is so extensive that the  settlement of the question is a matter of great difficulty. Of the  form called \"Mias Pappan,\" Mr. Wallace observes: \"It is known by its  large size, and by the lateral expansion of the face into fatty  protuberances, or ridges, over the temporal muscles, which have been  mistermed callosites, as they are perfectly soft, smooth, and  flexible. Five of this form, measured by me, varied only from 4 feet  1 inch to 4 feet 2 inches in height, from the heel to the crown of the  head, the girth of the body from 3 feet to 3 feet 71/2 inches, and the  extent of the outstretched arms from 7 feet 2 inches to 7 feet  6 inches; the width of the face from 10 to 131/4 inches. The color and  length of the hair varied in different individuals, and in different  parts of the same individual; some possessed a rudimentary nail on the  great toe, others none at all; but they otherwise present no external  differences on which to establish even varieties of a species.    \"Yet, when we examine the crania of these individuals, we find  remarkable differences of form, proportion, and dimension, no two  being exactly alike. The slope of the profile, and the projection of  the muzzle, together with the size of the cranium, offer differences  as decided as those existing between the most strongly marked forms of  the Caucasian and African crania in the human species. The orbits vary  in width and height, the cranial ridge is either single or double,  either much or little developed, and the zygomatic aperture varies  considerably in size. This variation in the proportions of the crania  enables us satisfactorily to explain the marked difference presented  by the single-crested and double-crested skulls, which have been  thought to prove the existence of two large species of Orang. The  external surface of the skull varies considerably in size, as do also  the zygomatic aperture and the temporal muscle: but they bear no  necessary relation to each other, a small muscle often existing with a  large cranial surface, and vice versa. Now those skulls which have the  largest and strongest jaws, and the widest zygomatic aperture, have  the muscles so large that they meet on the crown of the skull, and  deposit the bony ridge which separates them, and which is the highest  in that which has the smallest cranial surface. In those which combine  a large surface with comparatively weak jaws, and small zygomatic  aperture, the muscles, on each side, do not extend to the crown, a  space of from 1 to 2 inches remaining between them, and along their  margins small ridges are formed. Intermediate forms are found, in  which the ridges meet only in the hinder part of the skull. The form  and size of the ridges are therefore independent of age, being  sometimes more strongly developed in the less aged animal. Professor  Temminck states that the series of skulls in the Leyden Museum shows  the same result.\"    Mr. Wallace observed two male adult Orangs (Mias Kassu of the Dyaks),  however, so very different from any of these that he concludes them to  be specially distinct; they were respectively 3 feet 81/2 inches and  3 feet 91/2 inches high, and possessed no sign of the cheek excrescences,  but otherwise resembled the larger kinds. The skull has no crest, but  two bony ridges, 13/4 to 2 inches apart, as in the _Simia morio_ of  Professor Owen. The teeth, however, are immense, equalling or  surpassing those of the other species. The females of both these  kinds, according to Mr. Wallace, are devoid of excrescences, and  resemble the smaller males, but are shorter by 11/2 to 3 inches, and  their canine teeth are comparatively small, subtruncated and dilated  at the base, as in the so-called _Simia morio_, which is, in all  probability, the skull of a female of the same species as the smaller  males. Both males and females of this smaller species are  distinguishable, according to Mr. Wallace, by the comparatively large  size of the middle incisors of the upper jaw.    So far as I am aware, no one has attempted to dispute the accuracy of  the statements which I have just quoted regarding the habits of the  two Asiatic man-like Apes; and if true, they must be admitted as  evidence that such an ape--    1stly, May readily move along the ground in the erect, or semi-erect,  position, and without direct support from its arms.    2dly, That it may possess an extremely loud voice--so loud as to be  readily heard one or two miles.    3dly, That it may be capable of great viciousness and violence when  irritated; and this is especially true of adult males.    4thly, That it may build a nest to sleep in.    Such being well-established facts respecting the Asiatic anthropoids,  analogy alone might justify us in expecting the African species to  offer similar peculiarities, separately or combined; or, at any rate,  would destroy the force of any attempted _a priori_ argument against  such direct testimony as might be adduced in favor of their existence.  And if the organization of any of the African apes could be  demonstrated to fit it better than either of its Asiatic allies for  the erect position and for efficient attack, there would be still less  reason for doubting its occasional adoption of the upright attitude,  or of aggressive proceedings.    [Illustration: HEAD OF CHIMPANZEE.]    From the time of Tyson and Tulpius downward the habits of the young  Chimpanzee in a state of captivity have been abundantly reported and  commented upon. But trustworthy evidence as to the manners and customs  of adult anthropoids of this species, in their native woods, was  almost wanting up to the time of the publication of the paper by Dr.  Savage, to which I have already referred, containing notes of the  observations which he made, and of the information which he collected  from sources which he considered trustworthy, while resident at Cape  Palmas, at the north-western limit of the Bight of Benin.    The adult Chimpanzees, measured by Dr. Savage, never exceeded, though  the males may almost attain, five feet in height.    \"When at rest, the sitting posture is that generally assumed. They are  sometimes seen standing and walking, but when thus detected, they  immediately take to all fours and flee from the presence of the  observer. Such is their organization that they cannot stand erect, but  lean forward. Hence they are seen, when standing, with the hands  clasped over the occiput, or the lumbar region, which would seem  necessary to balance or ease of posture.    \"The toes of the adult are strongly flexed and turned inward, and  cannot be perfectly straightened. In the attempt the skin gathers into  thick folds on the back, showing that the full expansion of the foot,  as is necessary in walking, is unnatural. The natural position is on  all fours, the body anteriorly resting upon the knuckles. These are  greatly enlarged, with the skin protuberant and thickened like the  sole of the foot.    \"They are expert climbers, as one would suppose from their  organization. In their gambols they swing from limb to limb at a great  distance, and leap with astonishing agility. It is not unusual to see  the 'old folks' (in the language of an observer) sitting under a tree  regaling themselves with fruit and friendly chat, while their  'children' are leaping around them, and swinging from tree to tree  with boisterous merriment.    \"As seen here, they cannot be called _gregarious_, seldom more than  five, or ten at most, being found together. It has been said, on good  authority, that they occasionally assemble in large numbers, in  gambols. My informant asserts that he saw once not less than fifty so  engaged, hooting, screaming, and drumming with sticks upon old logs,  which is done in the latter case with equal facility by the four  extremities. They do not appear ever to act on the offensive, and,  seldom, if ever, really on the defensive. When about to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18281"],[0,"An Account of the Proceedings on the Trial of Susan B. Anthony, on the Charge of (#7)"],[1,"opinions  on that question, and, so far as I am informed, there has been no  authoritative adjudication upon it; or, at all events, none upon which  the public mind has been content to rest as conclusive. I proceed,  therefore, to offer such suggestions as occur to me, and to refer to  such authorities bearing upon the question, as have fallen under my  observation, hoping to satisfy your honor, not only that my client has  committed no criminal offense, but that she has done nothing which she  had not a legal and constitutional right to do.    It is not claimed that, under our State constitution and the laws made  in pursuance of it, women are authorized to vote at elections, other  than those of private corporations, and, consequently, the right of Miss  Anthony to vote at the election in question, can only be established by  reference to an authority superior to and sufficient to overcome the  provisions of our State constitution. Such authority can only be found,  and I claim that it is found in the constitution of the United States.  For convenience I beg leave to bring together the various provisions of  that constitution which bear more or less directly upon the question:    ARTICLE I, Section 2. \"The House of Representatives shall be composed of  members chosen every second year, by the people of the several States;  and the electors in each State shall have the qualifications for  electors of the most numerous branch of the State legislature.\"    The same Article, Section 3, \"The Senate of the United States shall be  composed of two senators from each State, chosen by the legislature  thereof for six years; and each senator shall have one vote.\"    ARTICLE II, Section 1. \"Each State shall appoint in such manner as the  legislature thereof may direct, a number of electors equal to the whole  number of senators and representatives to which the State may be  entitled in the Congress.\"    ARTICLE IV, Section 2. \"The citizens of each State shall be entitled to  all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States.\"    Same Article, Section 4. \"The United States shall guarantee to every  State in the union a republican form of government.\"      THIRTEENTH AMENDMENT.    DECEMBER 18, 1865.    \"1. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment  for crime, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist  within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.\"    \"2. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate  legislation.\"      FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT.    JULY 28, 1868.    Section 1. \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and  subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States  and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any  law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the  United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty  or property, without due process of law, nor deny to any person within  its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\"    Section 2. \"Representatives shall be apportioned among the several  States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number  of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed. But when the  right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President  and Vice-President of the United States, Representatives in Congress,  the Executive and Judicial officers of a State, or the members of the  Legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such  State, being twenty-one years of age, and citizens of the United States,  or in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion or other  crime, the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the  proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the  whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Section 5. \"The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate  legislation, the provisions of this article.\"      FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT.    Section 1. \"The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not  be denied or abridged by the United States, or by any State, on account  of race, color or previous condition of servitude.\"    Section 2. \"The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by  appropriate legislation.\"      By reference to the provisions of the original Constitution, here  recited, it appears that prior to the thirteenth, if not until the  fourteenth, amendment, the whole power over the elective franchise, even  in the choice of Federal officers, rested with the States. The  Constitution contains no definition of the term \"citizen,\" either of the  United States, or of the several States, but contents itself with the  provision that \"the citizens of each State shall be entitled to all the  privileges and immunities of citizens of the several States.\" The States  were thus left free to place such restrictions and limitations upon the  \"privileges and immunities\" of citizens as they saw fit, so far as is  consistent with a republican form of government, subject only to the  condition that no State could place restrictions upon the \"privileges or  immunities\" of the citizens of any other State, which would not be  applicable to its own citizens under like circumstances.    It will be seen, therefore, that the whole subject, as to what should  constitute the \"privileges and immunities\" of the citizen being left to  the States, no question, such as we now present, could have arisen under  the original constitution of the United States.    But now, by the fourteenth amendment, the United States have not only  declared what constitutes citizenship, both in the United States and in  the several States, securing the rights of citizens to \"all persons born  or naturalized in the United States;\" but have absolutely prohibited the  States from making or enforcing \"_any law which shall abridge the  privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States_.\"    By virtue of this provision, I insist that the act of Miss Anthony in  voting was lawful.    It has never, since the adoption of the fourteenth amendment, been  questioned, and cannot be questioned, that women as well as men are  included in the terms of its first section, nor that the same  \"privileges and immunities of citizens\" are equally secured to both.    What, then, are the \"privileges and immunities of citizens of the United  States\" which are secured against such abridgement, by this section? I  claim that these terms not only include the right of voting for public  officers, but that they include that right as pre-eminently the most  important of all the privileges and immunities to which the section  refers. Among these privileges and immunities may doubtless be classed  the right to life and liberty, to the acquisition and enjoyment of  property, and to the free pursuit of one's own welfare, so far as such  pursuit does not interfere with the rights and welfare of others; but  what security has any one for the enjoyment of these rights when denied  any voice in the making of the laws, or in the choice of those who make,  and those who administer them? The possession of this voice, in the  making and administration of the laws--this _political_ right--is what  gives security and value to the other rights, which are merely personal,  not political. A person deprived of political rights is essentially a  slave, because he holds his personal rights subject to the will of those  who possess the political power. This principle constitutes the very  corner-stone of our government--indeed, of all republican government.  Upon that basis our separation from Great Britain was justified.  \"Taxation without representation is tyranny.\" This famous aphorism of  James Otis, although sufficient for the occasion when it was put forth,  expresses but a fragment of the principle, because government can be  oppressive through means of many appliances besides that of taxation.  The true principle is, that all government over persons deprived of any  voice in such government, is tyranny. That is the principle of the  declaration of independence. We were slow in allowing its application to  the African race, and have been still slower in allowing its application  to women; but it has been done by the fourteenth amendment, rightly  construed, by a definition of \"citizenship,\" which includes women as  well as men, and in the declaration that \"the privileges and immunities  of citizens shall not be abridged.\" If there is any privilege of the  citizen which is paramount to all others, it is the right of suffrage;  and in a constitutional provision, designed to secure the most valuable  rights of the citizen, the declaration that the privileges and  immunities of the citizen shall not be abridged, must, as I conceive, be  held to secure that right before all others. It is obvious, when the  entire language of the section is examined, not only that this  declaration was designed to secure to the citizen this _political_  right, but that such was its principal, if not its sole object, those  provisions of the section which follow it being devoted to securing the  _personal_ rights of \"life, liberty, property, and the equal protection  of the laws.\" The clause on which we rely, to wit:--\"No State shall make  or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of  citizens of the United States,\" might be stricken out of the section,  and the residue would secure to the citizen every right which is now  secured, excepting the political rights of voting and holding office.  _If the clause in question does not secure those political rights, it is  entirely nugatory, and might as well have been omitted._    If we go to the lexicographers and to the writers upon law, to learn  what are the privileges and immunities of the \"citizen"]]]
