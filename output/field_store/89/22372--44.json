Good night, Carley.\"    Flo stood an instant at the foot of the dark stairway where the light  from the lamp fell upon her face. It seemed sweet and earnest to Carley.  It expressed unconscious longing, but no envy. Then she ran up the  stairs to disappear.    \"Glenn, is that girl in love with you?\" asked Carley, bluntly.    To her amaze, Glenn laughed. When had she heard him laugh? It thrilled  her, yet nettled her a little.    \"If that isn't like you!\" he ejaculated. \"Your very first words after we  are left alone! It brings back the East, Carley.\"    \"Probably recall to memory will be good for you,\" returned Carley. \"But  tell me. Is she in love with you?\"    \"Why, no, certainly not!\" replied Glenn. \"Anyway, how could I answer  such a question? It just made me laugh, that's all.\"    \"Humph! I can remember when you were not above making love to a pretty  girl. You certainly had me worn to a frazzle--before we became engaged,\"  said Carley.    \"Old times! How long ago they seem!... Carley, it's sure wonderful to  see you.\"    \"How do you like my gown?\" asked Carley, pirouetting for his benefit.    \"Well, what little there is of it is beautiful,\" he replied, with a slow  smile. \"I always liked you best in white. Did you remember?\"    \"Yes. I got the gown for you. And I'll never wear it except for you.\"    \"Same old coquette--same old eternal feminine,\" he said, half sadly.  \"You know when you look stunning.... But, Carley, the cut of that--or  rather the abbreviation of it--inclines me to think that style for  women's clothes has not changed for the better. In fact, it's worse than  two years ago in Paris and later in New York. Where will you women draw  the line?\"    \"Women are slaves to the prevailing mode,\" rejoined Carley. \"I don't  imagine women who dress would ever draw a line, if fashion went on  dictating.\"    \"But would they care so much--if they had to work--plenty of work--and  children?\" inquired Glenn, wistfully.    \"Glenn! Work and children for modern women? Why, you are dreaming!\" said  Carley, with a laugh.    She saw him gaze thoughtfully into the glowing embers of the fire, and  as she watched him her quick intuition grasped a subtle change in his  mood. It brought a sternness to his face. She could hardly realize she  was looking at the Glenn Kilbourne of old.    \"Come close to the fire,\" he said, and pulled up a chair for her. Then  he threw more wood upon the red coals. \"You must be careful not to catch  cold out here. The altitude makes a cold dangerous. And that gown is no  protection.\"    \"Glenn, one chair used to be enough for us,\" she said, archly, standing  beside him.    But he did not respond to her hint, and, a little affronted, she  accepted the proffered chair. Then he began to ask questions rapidly. He  was eager for news from home--from his people--from old friends. However  he did not inquire of Carley about her friends. She talked unremittingly  for an hour, before she satisfied his hunger. But when her turn came to  ask questions she found him reticent.    He had fallen upon rather hard days at first out here in the West; then  his health had begun to improve; and as soon as he was able to work his  condition rapidly changed for the better; and now he was getting along  pretty well. Carley felt hurt at his apparent disinclination to confide  in her. The strong cast of his face, as if it had been chiseled in  bronze; the stern set of his lips and the jaw that protruded lean and  square cut; the quiet masked light of his eyes; the coarse roughness  of his brown hands, mute evidence of strenuous labors--these all gave a  different impression from his brief remarks about himself. Lastly there  was a little gray in the light-brown hair over his temples. Glenn was  only twenty-seven, yet he looked ten years older. Studying him so, with  the memory of earlier years in her mind, she was forced to admit that  she liked him infinitely more as he was now. He seemed proven. Something  had made him a man. Had it been his love for her, or the army service,  or the war in France, or the struggle for life and health afterwards? Or  had it been this rugged, uncouth West? Carley felt insidious jealousy of  this last possibility. She feared this West. She was going to hate it.  She had womanly intuition enough to see in Flo Hutter a girl somehow to  be reckoned with. Still, Carley would not acknowledge to herself that  his simple, unsophisticated Western girl could possibly be a rival.  Carley did not need to consider the fact that she had been spoiled by  the attention of men. It was not her vanity that precluded Flo Hutter as  a rival.    Gradually the conversation drew to a lapse, and it suited Carley to  let it be so. She watched Glenn as he gazed thoughtfully into the  amber depths of the fire. What was going on in his mind? Carley's old  perplexity suddenly had rebirth. And with it came an unfamiliar fear  which she could not smother. Every moment that she sat there beside  Glenn she was realizing more and more a yearning, passionate love for  him. The unmistakable manifestation of his joy at sight of her,  the strong, almost rude expression of his love, had called to some  responsive, but hitherto unplumbed deeps of her. If it had not been  for these undeniable facts Carley would have been panic-stricken. They  reassured her, yet only made her state of mind more dissatisfied.    \"Carley, do you still go in for dancing?\" Glenn asked, presently, with  his thoughtful eyes turning to her.    \"Of course. I like dancing, and it's about all the exercise I get,\" she  replied.    \"Have the dances changed--again?\"    \"It's the music, perhaps, that changes the dancing. Jazz is becoming  popular. And about all the crowd dances now is an infinite variation of  fox-trot.\"    \"No waltzing?\"    \"I don't believe I waltzed once this winter.\"    \"Jazz? That's a sort of tinpanning, jiggly stuff, isn't it?\"    \"Glenn, it's the fever of the public pulse,\" replied Carley. \"The  graceful waltz, like the stately minuet, flourished back in the days  when people rested rather than raced.\"    \"More's the pity,\" said Glenn. Then after a moment, in which his gaze  returned to the fire, he inquired rather too casually, \"Does Morrison  still chase after you?\"    \"Glenn, I'm neither old--nor married,\" she replied, laughing.    \"No, that's true. But if you were married it wouldn't make any  difference to Morrison.\"    Carley could not detect bitterness or jealousy in his voice. She would  not have been averse to hearing either. She gathered from his remark,  however, that he was going to be harder than ever to understand.  What had she said or done to make him retreat within himself, aloof,  impersonal, unfamiliar? He did not impress her as loverlike. What  irony of fate was this that held her there yearning for his kisses and  caresses as never before, while he watched the fire, and talked as to  a mere acquaintance, and seemed sad and far away? Or did she merely  imagine that? Only one thing could she be sure of at that moment, and it  was that pride would never be her ally.    \"Glenn, look here,\" she said, sliding her chair close to his and holding  out her left hand, slim and white, with its glittering diamond on the  third finger.    He took her hand in his and pressed it, and smiled at her. \"Yes, Carley,  it's a beautiful, soft little hand. But I think I'd like it better if it  were strong and brown, and coarse on the inside--from useful work.\"    \"Like Flo Hutter's?\" queried Carley.    \"Yes.\"    Carley looked proudly into his eyes. \"People are born in different  stations. I respect your little Western friend, Glenn, but could I wash  and sweep, milk cows and chop wood, and all that sort of thing?\"    \"I suppose you couldn't,\" he admitted, with a blunt little laugh.    \"Would you want me to?\" she asked.    \"Well, that's hard to say,\" he replied, knitting his brows. \"I hardly  know. I think it depends on you.... But if you did do such work wouldn't  you be happier?\"    \"Happier! Why Glenn, I'd be miserable!... But listen. It wasn't my  beautiful and useless hand I wanted you to see. It was my engagement  ring.\"    \"Oh!--Well?\" he went on, slowly.    \"I've never had it off since you left New York,\" she said, softly.  \"You gave it to me four years ago. Do you remember? It was on my  twenty-second birthday. You said it would take two months' salary to pay  the bill.\"    \"It sure did,\" he retorted, with a hint of humor.    \"Glenn, during the war it was not so--so very hard to wear this ring as  an engagement ring should be worn,\" said Carley, growing more earnest.  \"But after the war--especially after your departure West it was terribly  hard to be true to the significance of this betrothal ring. There was a  let-down in all women. Oh, no one need tell me! There was. And men were  affected by that and the chaotic condition of the times. New York was  wild during the year of your absence. Prohibition was a joke.--Well, I  gadded, danced, dressed, drank, smoked, motored, just the same as  the other women in our crowd. Something drove me to. I never rested.  Excitement seemed to be happiness--Glenn, I am not making any plea  to excuse all that. But I want you to know--how under trying  circumstances--I was absolutely true to you. Understand me. I mean true  as regards love. Through it all I loved you just the same. And now I'm  with you, it seems, oh, so much more!... Your last letter hurt me. I  don't know just how. But I came West to see you--to tell you this--and  to ask you.... Do you want this ring back?\"    \"Certainly not,\" he replied, forcibly, with a dark flush spreading over  his face.    \"Then--you love me?\" she whispered.    \"Yes--I love you,\" he returned, deliberately. \"And in spite of all you  say--very probably more than you love me.... But you, like all women,  make love and its expression the sole object of life. Carley, I have  been concerned with keeping my body from "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18828"],[0,"Selections From the Writings of the Báb (#7)"],[1,",  were all the inhabitants of heaven and earth and whatever existeth between  them to assemble together, they would utterly fail and be powerless to  produce such a book, even though We made them masters of eloquence and  learning on earth. Since thou dost adduce proofs from the Qur'an, God  shall, with proofs from that self-same Book, vindicate Himself in the  Bayan. This is none other than a decree of God; He is truly the  All-Knowing, the All-Powerful.    If thou art of them that truly believe, thou hast no other alternative  than to bear allegiance unto it. This is the Way of God for all the  inhabitants of earth and heaven and all that lieth betwixt them. No God is  there but Me, the Almighty, the Inaccessible, the Most Exalted.    From this land We then proceeded to the sacred House, and on Our return  journey We landed once again at this spot, when We perceived that thou  hadst heeded not that which We sent thee, nor art thou of them that truly  believe. Although We had created thee to behold Our countenance, and We  did actually alight in thy locality, yet thou didst fail to attain the  object of thy creation, and this despite thy worshipping God all thy life.  Wherefore vain shall be the deeds thou hast wrought, by reason of thy  being shut out as by a veil from Our presence and from Our Writings. This  is an irrevocable decree ordained by Us. Verily We are equitable in Our  judgement.    Hadst thou observed the contents of the Epistle We sent unto thee, it  would have been far more profitable to thee than worshipping thy Lord from  the beginning that hath no beginning until this day, and indeed more  meritorious than proving thyself wholly devoted in thine acts of worship.  And hadst thou attained the presence of thy Lord in this land, and been of  them that truly believe that the Face of God is beheld in the person of  the Primal Point, it would have been far more advantageous than  prostrating thyself in adoration from the beginning that hath no beginning  until the present time....    In truth We tested thee and found that thou wert not of them that are  endowed with understanding, wherefore We passed upon thee the sentence of  negation, as a token of justice from Our presence; and verily We are  equitable.    However, shouldst thou return unto Us, We would convert thy negation into  affirmation. Verily We are the One Who is of immense bounteousness. But  should the Primal Point cease to be with you, then the judgement given in  the Words of God shall be final and unalterable and every one will  assuredly uphold it.    Wert thou to address a letter to Him Whom God shall make manifest, begging  that it be delivered unto His presence, perchance He would graciously  forgive thee and, at His behest, turn thy negation into affirmation. He is  in truth the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous, He Whose grace is infinite.  Otherwise, no way shalt thou find open unto thee and no benefit shalt thou  gain from the deeds thou hast wrought, by reason of thy failure to respond  'yea, here am I'. Verily We have reduced thee and thy works to naught, as  though thou hadst never come into existence nor ever been of them that do  good works, that this may serve as a lesson for those unto whom the Bayan  is given, that they may take good heed when the sacred Writings of Him  Whom God shall make manifest will reach them and perchance, by pondering  upon them, may be enabled to save their own souls.    Our grace assuredly pervadeth all that dwell in the kingdoms of earth and  heaven and in whatever lieth between them, and beyond them all mankind.  However, souls that have shut themselves out as by a veil can never  partake of the outpourings of the grace of God.            2: EXCERPTS FROM THE QAYYUMU'L-ASMA          \"All praise be to God Who hath, through the ...\"      All praise be to God Who hath, through the power of Truth, sent down this  Book unto His servant, that it may serve as a shining light for all  mankind... Verily this is none other than the sovereign Truth; it is the  Path which God hath laid out for all that are in heaven and on earth. Let  him then who will, take for himself the right path unto his Lord. Verily  this is the true Faith of God, and sufficient witness are God and such as  are endowed with the knowledge of the Book. This is indeed the eternal  Truth which God, the Ancient of Days, hath revealed unto His omnipotent  Word--He Who hath been raised up from the midst of the Burning Bush. This  is the Mystery which hath been hidden from all that are in heaven and on  earth, and in this wondrous Revelation it hath, in very truth, been set  forth in the Mother Book by the hand of God, the Exalted...    O concourse of kings and of the sons of kings! Lay aside, one and all,  your dominion which belongeth unto God...    Let not thy sovereignty deceive thee, O _Sh_ah, for 'every soul shall  taste of death,'(9) and this, in very truth, hath been written down as a  decree of God. _Chapter I._          \"O King of Islam! Aid thou, with the truth, after having ...\"      O King of Islam! Aid thou, with the truth, after having aided the Book,  Him Who is Our Most Great Remembrance, for God hath, in very truth,  destined for thee, and for such as circle round thee, on the Day of  Judgement, a responsible position in His Path. I swear by God, O _Sh_ah!  If thou showest enmity unto Him Who is His Remembrance, God will, on the  Day of Resurrection, condemn thee, before the kings, unto hell-fire, and  thou shalt not, in very truth, find on that Day any helper except God, the  Exalted. Purge thou, O _Sh_ah, the Sacred Land [Tihran] from such as have  repudiated the Book, ere the day whereon the Remembrance of God cometh,  terribly and of a sudden, with His potent Cause, by the leave of God, the  Most High. God, verily, hath prescribed to thee to submit unto Him Who is  His Remembrance, and unto His Cause, and to subdue, with the truth and by  His leave, the countries, for in this world thou hast been mercifully  invested with sovereignty, and wilt, in the next, dwell, nigh unto the  Seat of Holiness, with the inmates of the Paradise of His good-pleasure...    By God! If ye do well, to your own behoof will ye do well; and if ye deny  God and His signs, We, in very truth, having God, can well dispense with  all creatures and all earthly dominion. _Chapter I._          \"Be thou content with the commandment of God, the ...\"      Be thou content with the commandment of God, the True One, inasmuch as  sovereignty, as recorded in the Mother Book by the hand of God, is surely  invested in Him Who is His Remembrance...    O Minister of the _Sh_ah! Fear thou God, besides Whom there is none other  God but Him, the Sovereign Truth, the Just, and lay aside thy dominion,  for We, by the leave of God, the All-Wise, inherit the earth and all who  are upon it,(10) and He shall rightfully be a witness unto thee and unto  the _Sh_ah. Were ye to obey the Remembrance of God with absolute  sincerity, We guarantee, by the leave of God, that on the Day of  Resurrection, a vast dominion shall be yours in His eternal Paradise.    Vain indeed is your dominion, for God hath set aside earthly possessions  for such as have denied Him; for unto Him Who is your Lord shall be the  most excellent abode, He Who is, in truth, the Ancient of Days....    O concourse of kings! Deliver with truth and in all haste the verses sent  down by Us to the peoples of Turkey and of India, and beyond them, with  power and with truth, to lands in both the East and the West.... And know  that if ye aid God, He will, on the Day of Resurrection, graciously aid  you, upon the Bridge, through Him Who is His Most Great Remembrance...    O people of the earth! Whoso obeyeth the Remembrance of God and His Book  hath in truth obeyed God and His chosen ones and he will, in the life to  come, be reckoned in the presence of God among the inmates of the Paradise  of His good-pleasure. _Chapter I._          \"Verily We made the revelation of verses to be a testimony ...\"      Verily We made the revelation of verses to be a testimony for Our message  unto you. Can ye produce a single letter to match these verses? Bring  forth, then, your proofs, if ye be of those who can discern the one true  God. I solemnly affirm before God, should all men and spirits combine to  compose the like of one chapter of this Book, they would surely fail, even  though they were to assist one another.(11)    O concourse of divines! Fear God from this day onwards in the views ye  advance, for He Who is Our Remembrance in your midst, and Who cometh from  Us, is, in very truth, the Judge and Witness. Turn away from that which ye  lay hold of, and which the Book of God, the True One, hath not sanctioned,  for on the Day of Resurrection ye shall, upon the Bridge, be, in very  truth, held answerable for the position ye occupied.... And unto you We  have sent down this Book which truly none can mistake...    O concourse of the people of the Book! Fear ye God and pride not  yourselves in your learning. Follow ye the Book which His Remembrance hath  revealed in praise of God, the True One. He Who is the Eternal Truth  beareth me witness, whoso followeth this Book hath indeed followed all the  past Scriptures which have been sent down from heaven by God, the  Sovereign Truth. Verily, He is well informed of what ye do... Such as are  the true followers of Islam would say: 'O Lord our God! We have hearkened  to the call of Thy Remembrance and obeyed Him. Forgive us our sins. Thou  art, verily, the Eternal Truth, and unto Thee, our infallible Retreat,  must we all return.'(12) _Chapter II._          \"As to those who deny Him Who is the Sublime Gate of ...\"      As to those who deny Him Who is the Sublime Gate of God, for them We have  prepared, as justly decreed by God, a sore torment.
