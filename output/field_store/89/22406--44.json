The efficient manner in which you have carried out my humble suggestions  has been a source of great encouragement to me and has revived confidence  in my heart. I have read and re-read the reports of your activities, have  studied minutely all the steps you have taken to consolidate the  foundations of the Movement in America, and have learned with a keen sense  of satisfaction the plans you contemplate for the further rise and spread  of the Cause in your great country. I very highly approve of the  arrangements you have made for centralizing the work in your hands and of  distributing it to the various committees, who each in its own sphere,  have so efficiently and thoroughly undertaken the management of their own  affairs.    What has given me still greater pleasure is to learn that the members of  this Central Body which has assumed so grave a responsibility and is  facing such delicate and difficult tasks, command individually and  collectively not only the sympathy of their spiritual brethren and sisters  but who also can confidently rely on their active and whole-hearted  support in the campaign of service to the Cause of Baha'u'llah. It is  indeed as it should be, for if genuine and sustained cooperation and  mutual confidence cease to exist between individual friends and their  local and national assemblies, the all-beneficent work of the Cause must  cease and nothing else can enable it to function harmoniously and  effectively in future.    True, the Cause as every other movement has its own obstacles,  complications and unforeseen difficulties, but unlike any other human  organization it inspires a spirit of Faith and Devotion which can never  fail to induce us to make sincere and renewed efforts to face these  difficulties and smooth any differences that may and must arise.    I look forward with fervent hope to hear of these renewed efforts on your  part and of the strong determination which you will never suffer to  slacken, to maintain at any cost the unity, the effectiveness and the  dignity of the Cause.    May I through you express my heartfelt gratitude to the members of the  Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar Building Committee, Mr. Alfred E. Lunt, Mrs. Corinne  True, Dr. Zia Bagdadi, Mr. Charles Mason Remey, Mr. Louis Bourgeois, Mr.  Leo Perron for their incessant labors in speeding the work of this noble  Edifice which when raised and completed will prove to be the most powerful  factor in the promulgation of the Cause in America.    Will you also extend to the members of the Publishing and Reviewing  Committees, Mr. William H. Randall, Mr. Mountfort Mills, Mr. Roy C.  Wilhelm, Mr. Albert R. Vail, Miss Edna True, Mrs. Marjory Morten and Mr.  Alfred E. Lunt, my high appreciation for the very efficient management of  their departments and their devotion to a work which if consistently  maintained cannot fail to impress and attract a vast number of the  enlightened public. Regarding the Star of the West, I wish to congratulate  in particular the members of the Publishing Committee on the quality of  their work. I have perused with particular interest the last numbers of  the Magazine and am glad to note an encouraging improvement in its  management, its style, its general presentation and the nature and number  of its articles.    To the members of the Teaching Committee, Mr. William Randall, Mrs. Agnes  S. Parsons, Mr. Albert Vail, Mr. Louis G. Gregory and Mrs. Mariam Haney I  offer my very best wishes and assure them of my constant prayers on their  behalf, that their services to such a vital department in the affairs of  the Cause, so primary and immediate in its importance, may be crowned with  brilliant success.    For the members of the Children's Educational Work Committee, Mrs. Grace  Ober, Mrs. Louise Boyle, Mrs. Victoria Bedikian, Mrs. Hebe Struven, Mrs.  Grace Foster, Mr. Stanwood Cobb and Mr. Allen McDaniel, I supplicate  Divine Assistance, that He may graciously aid them in a work which was so  near and dear to the Master's heart and enable them to assist in the rise  of future devoted and efficient servants to the Cause of God.    On behalf of all the members of these Committees, I shall pray at the  Three Hallowed Shrines, that they may become purified channels of His  Grace and instruments of His Divine Plan for this world. For my part, I  shall not fail to offer my humble share of help and assistance to every  one of them in their respective work and would welcome from each a special  report on their present activities and of their plans for the future.    Awaiting from you all the joyous news of the deepening as well as the  spreading of the Cause for which our beloved Master has given His time,  His life, His all, and remembering your labors of love and service every  time I lay my head upon the Sacred Thresholds,    I am, as ever, your brother in His Service,  SHOGHI.    Haifa, Palestine,  December 23rd, 1922.    P.S. I would be pleased and gratified if you could inform all the various  local spiritual assemblies of my wish and desire to receive as soon as  possible from every local assembly a detailed and official report on their  spiritual activities, the character and organization of their respective  assemblies, accounts of their public and private gatherings, of the actual  position of the Cause in their province, and of their plans and  arrangements for the future. Pray convey to all of them my best wishes and  the assurance of my hearty assistance in their noble work of service to  mankind.    SHOGHI.          Letter of January 12, 1923      To the members of the National Spiritual Assembly.    Beloved co-workers in the Cause of God!    In the midst of your unceasing labors for the progress of the Movement in  that country, I am sure you would welcome every now and then such news as  shall breathe a fresh spirit into your activities and stimulate you to  further effort for the promotion of His Cause.    Only the other day, in the course of my study of various Baha'i documents,  I came, as if by mere chance, across a very important message from our  beloved 'Abdu'l-Baha, bearing no date, and revealing no sign as to exactly  where, how and to whom it was given, written in the Master's own  handwriting upon a leaflet that seemed ordinary and ill-preserved in  appearance but which on close study proved of the profoundest interest to  all believers in the East as well as in the West. As to the authenticity  of these remarkable words, so clearly and forcibly written, there is no  doubt whatsoever, and the measure of assurance it shall inspire in the  loved ones of Persia and the spirit of hopeful encouragement it shall  breathe in the friends of the West, have urged me to communicate it to  you, that subject to your consideration and consent, it may be  published(3) amongst the friends and redouble their confidence in the very  remarkable share the West is destined to contribute to the immediate  spread of the Movement throughout the world.    Recently, I have rendered it myself into English and enclosed is a copy of  the full translation.          Star of the West      May I also mention in passing the fact that since my return to the Holy  Land I have directed and emphatically urged in my letters, the friends in  Persia, Turkestan, Caucasus, Great Britain, India, Egypt and Syria to  subscribe, through their respective Assemblies, to the Star of the West,  report regularly to that paper and through their Assemblies the news of  their activity and contribute every now and then carefully written  articles approved and sanctioned by the same Assemblies.    I trust that this measure will react favorably on the Star of the West and  will serve to stimulate the members of the Publishing Committee to further  activity in their sphere of service to the Cause.    Awaiting eagerly your letters and wishing you the fullest success in your  very arduous duties,    I am your devoted brother,  SHOGHI.    Haifa, Palestine,  January 12, 1923.          Letter of January 16, 1923.      The beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the Merciful throughout the  United States and Canada.    Beloved brothers and sisters in 'Abdu'l-Baha:    Our dear friend, Jinab-i-Fadil-i-Mazindarani, accompanied by his family,  has gladly and gratefully responded to the kind invitation of the American  friends to visit them once more and extend his helping hand to the many  friends who are so faithfully laboring throughout that continent for the  Cause of Baha'u'llah.    Deeply appreciative of the sentiments of warm and abiding affection which  his co-workers of that land have abundantly shown him in the past, fired  with the zeal of service which the passing of our Beloved has kindled in  every heart and hopeful of the immediate future of the Cause in those  regions, he is proceeding to America with the sole purpose of promoting  far and wide and with greater efficiency and vigor the all-important work  of teaching.    As to the extent of his sojourn, the details of his travel, his plan for  visiting the various spiritual centers and all other matters related to  his visit, I have left them all to his own discretion, that he may, after  consultation with the various Spiritual Assemblies, do as he deems best  and most serviceable to the interests of the Cause in that land.    That all the friends may realize more fully the urgent and supreme  necessity of teaching the Cause in these days; that they may arise to  inaugurate a more strenuous, systematized and extensive campaign of  service--these are the high aims he has set before himself and which he  intends, with the unfailing help and wholehearted support of every  believer in America, to achieve in the immediate future.    May his second visit to your shores mark, in its character and results, a  new and memorable era in the history of the Cause in that great country!    Your brother "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19254"],[0,"Citadel of Faith (#7)"],[1,"energies of that Faith can be diffused  to neighboring territories in the course of the unfoldment of the Plan.  The nuclei that are now being formed, and the groups that are beginning to  emerge, must be speedily and systematically reinforced, not only through  the dispatch and settlement of pioneers and the visits paid them by  itinerant teachers, but also through the progressive development of the  teaching work which the pioneers themselves must initiate and foster among  the native population in those countries. Any artificially created  assembly, consisting of settlers from abroad, can at best be considered as  temporary and insecure, and should, if the second stage of the European  enterprise is to be commenced without undue delay in the future, be  supplanted by broad-based, securely grounded, efficiently functioning  assemblies, composed primarily of the people of the countries themselves,  who are firm in faith, unimpeachable in their loyalty and whole-hearted in  their support of the Administrative Order of the Faith. The twenty-five  pioneers that have already proceeded to Scandinavia and the Low Countries,  to the Iberian Peninsula, to Switzerland and Italy, should, in the course  of this current year, and while the process of teaching the native  population is being inaugurated, be reinforced by as many additional  pioneers as possible, and particularly by those who, possessed of  independent means, can, either themselves or through their appointed  deputies, swell the number of the valiant workers already laboring with  such devotion in those fields.    The translation, the publication and dissemination of Baha'i literature,  whether in the form of leaflets, pamphlets or books, in the nine selected  languages, should, as the work progresses and the demand is  correspondingly increased, be strenuously carried out, as a preliminary to  its free distribution among the public on certain occasions, and its  presentation to both the leaders of public thought and the numerous and  famous libraries established in those countries. No time should be lost in  establishing, on however small a scale, initial contact with the press and  other agencies designed to invite greater attention on the part of the  masses to the historic work now being initiated in their respective  countries.    No opportunity, in view of the necessity of insuring the harmonious  development of the Faith, should be ignored, which its potential enemies,  whether ecclesiastical or otherwise, may offer, to set forth, in a  restrained and unprovocative language, its aims and tenets, to defend its  interests, to proclaim its universality, to assert the supernatural, the  supra-national and non-political character of its institutions, and its  acceptance of the divine origin of the Faiths which have preceded it. Nor  should any chance be missed of associating the Faith, as distinct from  affiliating it, with all progressive, non-political, non-ecclesiastical  institutions, whether social, educational, or charitable, whose objectives  harmonize with some of its tenets, and amongst whose members and  supporters individuals may be found who will eventually embrace its truth.  Particular attention should, moreover, be paid to attendance at congresses  and conferences, and to any contacts that can be made with colleges and  universities which offer a fertile field for the scattering of the seeds  of the Faith, and afford opportunities for broadcasting its message, and  for winning fresh recruits to its strength.    Nor should any occasion be neglected by the pioneers of attending, if  their personal circumstances permit, either the British or German Baha'i  summer schools, and of forging such links with these institutions as will  not only assist them in the discharge of their duties, but enable them to  initiate, when the time is ripe, an institution of a similar character,  under the auspices of the European Teaching Committee--an institution which  will be the forerunner of the summer schools that will have to be founded  separately by the future assemblies in their respective countries. Above  all, any assistance which the two national spiritual assemblies, already  established on that continent, and their auxiliary committees, and  particularly their publishing agencies, can extend should be gratefully  welcomed and utilized to the full, until such time as the institutions  destined to evolve in these countries can assume independently the conduct  of their own affairs.    A constant interchange of news between the centers, through the medium of  the Geneva Bulletin, whose scope must be steadily enlarged, and close  contact with each other through the European office of the European  Teaching Committee, functioning as an adjunct to the International Baha'i  Bureau, should, furthermore, be maintained and reinforced, whenever  circumstances are favorable, by the convening of conferences, which will  bring together as many pioneers laboring in these ten countries, and newly  converted believers, as possible, enabling them to jointly consider their  plans, problems and activities, concert measures for the progress of the  Faith in that continent, and pave the way for the future formation of  regional national spiritual assemblies, which must precede the  constitution of separate independent national institutions in each of  these countries. Such summer schools and conferences, initiated and  conducted by one of the most important agencies of the highest  administrative institution in the North American Baha'i Community,  gathering together as they will Baha'i representatives of various races  and nations on the continent of Europe, will, by reason of their  unprecedented character in the evolution of the Faith, since its  inception, constitute a historic landmark in the development of the  organic world-wide Baha'i community, and will be the harbinger of those  epoch-making world conferences, at which the representatives of the  nations and races within the Baha'i fold will convene for the  strengthening of the spiritual and administrative bonds that unite its  members.            INITIATING NATIONAL HEADQUARTERS AND ADAPTING TEACHING METHODS      A beginning, however limited in scope, should be made, ere the present  stage of the Divine Plan draws to a close, in the direction of  establishing befitting administrative headquarters for the rising  communities and their projected assemblies in the capital cities of  Stockholm, of Oslo, of Copenhagen, of The Hague, of Brussels, of  Luxembourg, of Madrid, of Lisbon, of Rome and of Bern, through the rental  of suitable quarters which, in the course of time, must lead to either the  construction or the purchase in each of these capitals of a national  Haziratu'l-Quds, as a future seat for independent, elected national  spiritual assemblies.    A tentative start, though strictly speaking excluded from the scope of the  present Plan, should, I feel, be made, ere the six remaining years have  run their course, aiming at the formation, in each of the ten designated  countries, of a number of nuclei, however few, however unstable, which  will proclaim to the entire Baha'i world the ability of the prosecutors of  the Plan to exceed their allocated task, even as they surpassed, in the  Latin American field, the goals which they had originally set before them.  Such a feat, if accomplished, would impart to my overburdened heart a joy  that would equal the many consolations which a dearly loved community has  showered upon me, in the past, by its signal acts, both within its  homeland and abroad, since the passing of 'Abdu'l-Baha.    Nor should any of the pioneers, at this early stage in the upbuilding of  Baha'i national communities, overlook the fundamental prerequisite for any  successful teaching enterprise, which is to adapt the presentation of the  fundamental principles of their Faith to the cultural and religious  backgrounds, the ideologies, and the temperament of the divers races and  nations whom they are called upon to enlighten and attract. The  susceptibilities of these races and nations, from both the northern and  southern climes, springing from either the Germanic or Latin stock,  belonging to either the Catholic or Protestant communion, some democratic,  others totalitarian in outlook, some socialistic, others capitalistic in  their tendencies, differing widely in their customs and standards of  living, should at all times be carefully considered, and under no  circumstances neglected.    These pioneers, in their contact with the members of divers creeds, races  and nations, covering a range which offers no parallel in either the north  or south continents, must neither antagonize them nor compromise with  their own essential principles. They must be neither provocative nor  supine, neither fanatical nor excessively liberal, in their exposition of  the fundamental and distinguishing features of their Faith. They must be  either wary or bold, they must act swiftly or mark time, they must use the  direct or indirect method, they must be challenging or conciliatory, in  strict accordance with the spiritual receptivity of the soul with whom  they come in contact, whether he be a nobleman or a commoner, a northerner  or a southerner, a layman or a priest, a capitalist or a socialist, a  statesman or a prince, an artisan or a beggar. In their presentation of  the Message of Baha'u'llah they must neither hesitate nor falter. They  must be neither contemptuous of the poor nor timid before the great. In  their exposition of its verities they must neither overstress nor whittle  down the truth which they champion, whether their hearer belong to  royalty, or be a prince of the church, or a politician, or a tradesman, or  a man of the street. To all alike, high or low, rich or poor, they must  proffer, with open hands, with a radiant heart, with an eloquent tongue,  with infinite patience, with"]]]
