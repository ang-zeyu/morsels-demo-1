Great were the surprise and indignation of the assembly: the bishop of  Worcester exclaimed, that he would lose his life rather than comply: the  bishop of London said, that the pope and king were more powerful than  he; but if his mitre were taken off his head, he would clap on a helmet  in its place.[*] The legate was no less violent on the other hand; and  he told the assembly, in plain terms, that all ecclesiastical benefices  were the property of the pope, and he might dispose of them, either  in whole or in part, as he saw proper.[**] In the end, the bishops and  abbots, being threatened with excommunication, which made all their  revenues fall into the king's hands, were obliged to submit to the  exaction; and the only mitigation which the legate allowed them was,  that the tenths already granted should be accepted as a partial payment  of the bills. But the money was still insufficient for the pope's  purpose: the conquest of Sicily was as remote as ever: the demands which  came from Rome were endless: Pope Alexander became so urgent a creditor,  that he sent over a legate to England, threatening the kingdom with an  interdict, and the king with excommunication, if the arrears, which he  pretended to be due to him, were not instantly remitted;[***] and at  last Henry, sensible of the cheat, began to think of breaking off the  agreement, and of resigning into the pope's hands that crown which  it was not intended by Alexander that he or his family should ever  enjoy.[****]         * M.

The earl of Cornwall had now reason to value himself on his foresight,  in refusing the fraudulent bargain with Rome, and in preferring the  solid honors of an opulent and powerful prince of the blood of England,  to the empty and precarious glory of a foreign dignity. But he had not  always firmness sufficient to adhere to this resolution: his vanity and  ambition prevailed at last over his prudence and his avarice; and he was  engaged in an enterprise no less expensive and vexatious than that of  his brother, and not attended with much greater probability of success.  The immense opulence of Richard having made the German princes cast  their eye on him as a candidate for the empire, he was tempted to expend  vast sums of money on his election; and he succeeded so far as to be  chosen king of the Romans, which seemed to render his succession  infallible to the imperial throne. He went over to Germany, and carried  out of the kingdom no less a sum than seven hundred thousand marks, if  we may credit the account given by some ancient authors,[*] which is  probably much exaggerated.[**] His money, while it lasted, procured him  friends and partisans; but it was soon drained from him by the avidity  of the German princes; and, having no personal or family connections in  that country, and no solid foundation of power, he found, at last, that  he had lavished away the frugality of a whole life in order to procure  a splendid title; and that his absence from England, joined to the  weakness of his brother's government, gave reins to the factious and  turbulent dispositions of the English barons, and involved his own  country and family in great calamities.         * M. Paris, p. 638. The same author, a few pages before,       makes Richard's treasures amount to little more than half       the sum, (p. 634.) The king's dissipations and expenses,       throughout this whole reign, according to the same author,       had amounted only to about nine hundred and forty thousand       marks, (p. 638.)         ** The sums mentioned by ancient authors, who were almost all       monks, are often improbable, and never consistent. But we       know from an infallible authority, the public remonstrance       to the council of Lyons, that the king's revenues were below       sixty thousand marks a year: his brother, therefore, could       never have been master of seven hundred thousand marks;       especially as he did not sell his estates in England, as we       learn from the same author; and we hear afterwards of his       ordering all his woods to be cut, in order to satisfy the       rapacity of the German princes: his son succeeded to the       earldom of Cornwall and his other revenues.    The successful revolt of the nobility from King John, and their imposing  on him and his successors limitations of their royal power, had made  them feel their own weight and importance, had set a dangerous precedent  of resistance, and being followed by a long minority, had impoverished  as well as weakened that crown which they were at last induced, from the  fear of worse consequences, to replace on the head of young Henry. In  the king's situation, either great abilities and vigor were requisite  to overawe the barons, or great caution and reserve to give them no  pretence for complaints; and it must be confessed, that this prince was  possessed of neither of these talents. He had not prudence to choose  right measures; he wanted even that constancy which sometimes gives  weight to wrong ones; he was entirely devoted to his favorites, who  were always foreigners; he lavished on them, without discretion,  his diminished revenue; and finding that his barons indulged their  disposition towards tyranny, and observed not to their own vassals  the same rules which they had imposed on the crown, he was apt, in  his administration, to neglect all the salutary articles of the Great  Charter; which he remarked to be so little regarded by his nobility.  This conduct had extremely lessened his authority in the kingdom; had  multiplied complaints against him; and had frequently exposed him to  affronts, and even to dangerous attempts upon his prerogative. In  the year 1244, when he desired a supply from parliament, the barons,  complaining of the frequent breaches of the Great Charter, and of the  many fruitless applications which they had formerly made for the redress  of this and other grievances, demanded in return, that he should give  them the nomination of the great justiciary and of the chancellor, to  whose hands chiefly the administration of justice was committed: and,  if we may credit the historian,[*] they had formed the plan of other  limitations, as well as of associations to maintain them, which would  have reduced the king to be an absolute cipher, and have held the crown  in perpetual pupillage and dependence. The king, to satisfy them, would  agree to nothing but a renewal of the charter, and a general permission  to excommunicate all the violators of it; and he received no supply,  except a scutage of twenty shillings on each knight's fee for the  marriage of his eldest daughter to the king of Scotland; a burden which  was expressly annexed to their feudal tenures.         * M. Paris, p. 432.    Four years after, in a full parliament, when Henry demanded a new  supply, he was openly reproached with the breach of his word, and the  frequent violations of the charter. He was asked whether he did not  blush to desire any aid from his people, whom he professedly hated and  despised; to whom on all occasions he preferred aliens and foreigners,  and who groaned under the oppressions which he either permitted or  exercised over them. He was told that, besides disparaging his nobility  by forcing them to contract unequal and mean marriages with strangers,  no rank of men was so low as to escape vexations from him or his  ministers; that even the victuals consumed in his household, the clothes  which himself and his servants wore, still more the wine which they  used, were all taken by violence from the lawful owners, and no  compensation was ever made them for the injury; that foreign merchants,  to the great prejudice and infamy of the kingdom shunned the English  harbors as if they were possessed by pirates, and the commerce with all  nations was thus cut off by these acts of violence; that loss was  added to loss, and injury to injury, while the merchants, who had been  despoiled of their goods, were also obliged to carry them at their own  charge to whatever place the king was pleased to appoint them; that even  the poor fishermen on the coast could not escape his oppressions and  those of his courtiers; and finding that they had not full liberty to  dispose of their commodities in the English market, were frequently  constrained to carry them to foreign ports, and to hazard all the perils  of the ocean, rather than those which awaited them from his oppressive  emissaries; and that his very religion was a ground of complaint to his  subjects, while they observed, that the waxen tapers and splendid silks,  employed in so many useless processions, were the spoils which he had  forcibly ravished from the true owners.[*] Throughout this remonstrance,  in which the complaints derived from an abuse of the ancient right of  purveyance may be supposed to be somewhat exaggerated, there appears a  strange mixture of regal tyranny in the practices which gave rise to  it, and of aristocratical liberty, or rather licentiousness, in the  expressions employed by the parliament. But a mixture of this kind  is observable in all the ancient feudal governments, and both of them  proved equally hurtful to the people.    As the king, in answer to their remonstrance, gave the parliament only  good words and fair promises, attended with the most humble submissions,  which they had often found deceitful, he obtained at that time no  supply; and therefore, in the year 1253, when he found himself again  under the necessity of applying to parliament, he had provided a new  pretence, which he deemed infallible, and taking the vow of a crusade,  he demanded their"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19213"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol. I., Part C. (#7)"],[1," the king. He clearly saw that France had  entertained the view of subduing Brittany; but he also perceived, that  she would meet with great, and, as he thought, insuperable difficulties  in the execution of her project. The native force of that duchy, he  knew, had always been considerable, and had often, without any foreign  assistance, resisted the power of France; the natural temper of  the French nation, he imagined, would make them easily abandon any  enterprise which required perseverance; and as the heir of the crown  was confederated with the duke of Brittany, the ministers would be  still more remiss in prosecuting a scheme which must draw on them his  resentment and displeasure. Should even these internal obstructions be  removed, Maximilian, whose enmity to France was well known, and who now  paid his addresses to the heiress of Brittany, would be able to make a  diversion on the side of Flanders; nor could it be expected that France,  if she prosecuted such ambitious projects, would be allowed to remain in  tranquillity by Ferdinand and Isabella. Above all, he thought the French  court could never expect that England, so deeply interested to preserve  the independency of Brittany, so able by her power and situation to give  effectual and prompt assistance, would permit such an accession of force  to her rival. He imagined, therefore, that the ministers of France,  convinced of the impracticability of their scheme, would at last embrace  pacific views, and would abandon an enterprise so obnoxious to all the  potentates of Europe.    This reasoning of Henry was solid, and might justly engage him in  dilatory and cautious measures: but there entered into his conduct  another motive, which was apt to draw him beyond the just bounds,  because founded on a ruling passion. His frugality, which by degrees  degenerated into avarice, made him averse to all warlike enterprises and  distant expeditions, and engaged him previously to try the expedient  of negotiation. He despatched Urswic, his almoner, a man of address and  abilities, to make offer of his mediation to the contending parties;  an offer which, he thought, if accepted by France, would soon lead to  a composure of all differences; if refused or eluded, would at least  discover the perseverance of that court in her ambitious projects.  Urswic found the lady of Beaujeu, now duchess of Bourbon, engaged in the  siege of Nantz, and had the satisfaction to find that his master's  offer of mediation was readily embraced and with many expressions of  confidence and moderation. That able princess concluded, that the duke  of Orleans, who governed the court of Brittany, foreseeing that every  accommodation must be made at his expense, would use all his interest to  have Henry's proposal rejected; and would by that means make an apology  for the French measures, and draw on the Bretons the reproach of  obstinacy and injustice. The event justified her prudence. When the  English ambassador made the same offer to the duke of Brittany, he  received for answer, in the name of that prince, that having so long  acted the part of protector and guardian to Henry during his youth and  adverse fortune, he had expected from a monarch of such virtue more  effectual assistance in his present distresses than a barren offer of  mediation, which suspended not the progress of the French arms: that if  Henry's gratitude were not sufficient to engage him in such a measure,  his prudence, as king of England, should discover to him the pernicious  consequences attending the conquest of Brittany, and its annexation to  the crown of France: that that kingdom, already too powerful, would be  enabled, by so great an accession of force, to display, to the ruin of  England, that hostile disposition which had always subsisted between  those rival nations: that Brittany, so useful an ally, which, by its  situation, gave the English an entrance into the heart of France, being  annexed to that kingdom, would be equally enabled from its situation to  disturb, either by piracies or naval armaments, the commerce and  peace cf England: and that if the duke rejected Henry's mediation, it  proceeded neither from an inclination to a war, which he experienced to  be ruinous to him, nor from a confidence in his own force, which he knew  to be much inferior to that of the enemy; but, on the contrary, from a  sense of his present necessities, which must engage the king to act the  part of his confederate, not that of a mediator.    When this answer was reported to the king, he abandoned not the plan  which he had formed; he only concluded that some more time was requisite  to quell the obstinacy of the Bretons, and make them submit to reason.  And when he learned that the people of Brittany, anxious for their  duke's safety, had formed a tumultuary army of sixty thousand men, and  had obliged the French to raise the siege of Nantz, he fortified himself  the more in his opinion, that the court of France would at last be  reduced, by multiplied obstacles and difficulties, to abandon the  project of reducing Brittany to subjection. He continued, therefore, his  scheme of negotiation, and thereby exposed himself to be deceived by  the artifices of the French ministry; who, still pretending pacific  intentions, sent Lord Bernard Daubigni, a Scotchman of quality,  to London, and pressed Henry not to be discouraged in offering his  mediation to the court of Brittany. The king, on his part, despatched  another embassy, consisting of Urswic, the abbot of Abingdon, and Sir  Richard Tonstal, who carried new proposals for an amicable treaty. No  effectual succors, meanwhile, were provided for the distressed Bretons.  Lord Woodville, brother to the queen dowager, having asked leave  to raise underhand a body of volunteers, and to transport them into  Brittany, met with a refusal from the king, who was desirous of  preserving the appearance of a strict neutrality. That nobleman,  however, still persisted in his purpose. He went over to the Isle of  Wight, of which he was governor, levied a body of four hundred men; and  having at last obtained, as is supposed, the secret permission of  Henry, sailed with them to Brittany. This enterprise proved fatal to the  leader, and brought small relief to the unhappy duke. The Bretons rashly  engaged in a general action with the French at St. Aubin, and were  discomfited. Woodville and all the English were put to the sword,  together with a body of Bretons, who had been accoutred in the garb of  Englishmen in order to strike a greater terror into the French, to whom  the martial prowess of that nation was always formidable.[*] The duke of  Orleans the prince of Orange, and many other persons of rank were taken  prisoners; and the military force of Brittany was totally broken. The  death of the duke, which followed soon after, threw affairs into  still greater confusion, and seemed to threaten the state with a final  subjection.    Though the king did not prepare against these events, so hurtful to the  interests of England, with sufficient vigor and precaution, he had not  altogether overlooked them. Determined to maintain a pacific conduct,  as far as the situation of affairs would permit, he yet knew the warlike  temper of his subjects, and observed that their ancient and inveterate  animosity to France was now revived by the prospect of this great  accession to her power and grandeur. He resolved, therefore to make  advantage of this disposition, and draw some supplies from the people,  on pretence of giving assistance to the duke of Brittany. He had  summoned a parliament at Westminster;[**] and he soon persuaded them  to grant him a considerable subsidy.[***] But this supply, though  voted by parliament, involved the king in unexpected difficulties.  The counties of Durham and York, always discontented with Henry's  government, and further provoked by the late oppressions under which  they had labored, after the suppression of Simnel's rebellion, resisted  the commissioners who were appointed to levy the tax. The commissioners,  terrified with this appearance of sedition, made application to the  earl of Northumberland, and desired of him advice and assistance in  the execution of their office. That nobleman thought the matter of  importance enough to consult the king; who, unwilling to yield to  the humors of a discontented populace, and foreseeing the pernicious  consequence of such a precedent, renewed his orders for strictly levying  the imposition. Northumberland summoned together the justices and chief  freeholders, and delivered the king's commands in the most imperious  terms which, he thought, would enforce obedience, but which tended only  to provoke the people, and make them believe him the adviser of those  orders which he delivered to them.

(p 579) says, that this imposition was a       capitation tax; the other historians say, it was a tax of       two shillings in the pound.         **** Bacon, p. 595.    They flew to arms, attacked Northumberland in his house, and put him to  death. Having incurred such deep guilt, their mutinous humor prompted  them to declare against the king himself; and being instigated by John  Achamber, a seditious fellow of low birth, they chose Sir John Egremond  their leader, and prepared themselves for a vigorous resistance. Henry  was not dismayed with an insurrection so precipitate and ill supported.  He immediately levied a force, which he put under the command of the  earl of Surrey, whom he had freed from confinement and received into  favor. His intention was to send down these troops, in order to check  the progress of the rebels; while he himself should follow with a  greater body, which would absolutely insure success. But Surrey thought  himself strong enough to encounter alone a raw and unarmed multitude;  "]]]
