The nocturnal habits of the cat, its love of  prowling about during moonlight hours, and the spectacle of its two  round, gleaming eyes, may, of course, as Plutarch seems to have thought,  have suggested to the Egyptians human influence and analogy, and thus  the presence of its effigy in temples to Isis would be partially, at all  events, accounted for; though, as before, I am inclined to think there  is another and rather more subtle reason.    \"From endless experiments made in haunted houses, I have proved to my  own satisfaction, at least, that the cat acts as a thoroughly reliable  psychic barometer.    \"The dog is sometimes unaware of the proximity of the Unknown. When the  ghost materializes or in some other way demonstrates its advent, the  dog, occasionally, is wholly undisturbed--the cat never. I have never  yet had a cat with me that has not shown the most obvious signs of  terror and uneasiness both before and during a superphysical  manifestation.    \"Now, although I won't go so far as to say that ghostly demonstrations  are actually dependent on the moon--that they occur only on nights when  the moon is visible--experience has led me to believe that the moon most  certainly does influence them--that moonlight nights are much more  favourable to ghostly appearances than other nights. Hence--there is  this much in common between the moon and cats--the one influences and  the other is influenced by psychic phenomena--a fact that could scarcely  have failed to be recognized by so keen observers of the occult as the  Ancient Egyptians.    \"The presence of the cat's effigy in the temples of Isis might thus be  explained. Over and over again we come across the cat in the land of the  Pharaohs. It seems to be inseparable from the esoteric side of Egyptian  life. The goddess Bast is depicted with a cat's head, holding the  sistrum, i.e. the symbol of the world's harmony, in her hand.    \"One of the most ancient symbols of the cat is to be found in the  Necropolis of Thebes, which contains the tomb of Hana (who probably  belonged to the Eleventh Dynasty). There, Hana is depicted standing  erect, proud and kingly, with his favourite cat Borehaki--Borehaki, the  picture of all things strange and psychic, and from whom one cannot help  supposing he may have chosen his occult inspiration--at his feet. So  sure were the Egyptians that the cat possessed a soul that they deemed  it worthy of the same funeral rites they bestowed on man. Cats were  embalmed, and innumerable cat mummies have been discovered in wooden  coffins at Bubastis, Speos, Artemidos and Thebes. When a cat died the  Egyptians shaved their eyebrows, not only to show grief at the loss of  their loved one, but to avert subsequent misfortune.    \"So long as a cat was in his house the Egyptian felt safe from inimical  supernatural influences, but if there was no cat in the house at night,  then any undesirable from the occult world might visit him. Indeed, in  such high esteem did the Egyptians hold the cat, that they voluntarily  incurred the gravest risks when its life was in peril. No one of them  appreciated the cat and set a higher value on its mystic properties than  the Sultan El-Daher-Beybas, who reigned in A.D. 1260, and has been  compared with William of Tripoli for his courage, and with Nero for his  cruelty. El-Daher-Beybas kept his palace swarming with cats, and--if we  may give credence to tradition--was seldom to be seen unaccompanied by  one of these animals. When he died, he left the proceeds from the  product of a garden to support his feline friends--an example that found  many subsequent imitators. Indeed, until comparatively recently in  Cairo, cats were regularly fed, between noon and sunset, in the outer  court of the Mehkemeh.    \"In Geneva, Rome and Constantinople, though cats were generally deemed  to have souls and to possess psychic properties, they were thought to  derive them from evil sources, and so strong was the prejudice against  these unfortunate animals on this account, that all through the Middle  Ages we find them suffering such barbaric torture as only the perverted  minds of a fanatical, priest-ridden people could devise (which  treatment, no doubt, partly, at all events, accounts for the many  palaces, houses, etc., in those particular countries, stated to have  been haunted by the spirits of cats).    \"The devil was popularly supposed to appear in the shape of a black Tom  in preference to assuming any other guise, and the bare fact of an old  woman being seen, once or twice, with a black cat by her side was quite  sufficient to earn for her the reputation of a witch. It would be idle,  of course, to expect people in these unmeditative times to believe there  was ever the remotest truth underlying these so-called phantastic  suppositions of the past; yet, according to reliable testimony, there  are, at the present moment, many houses in England haunted by phantasms  in the form of black cats, of so sinister and hostile an appearance,  that one can only assume that unless they are the actual spirits of  cats, earthbound through cruel and vicious propensities, they must be  vice-elementals, i.e. spirits that have never inhabited any material  body, and which have either been generated by vicious thoughts, or else  have been attracted elsewhere to a spot by some crime or vicious act  once perpetrated there. Vice-elemental is merely the modern name for  fiend or demon.    \"Apart from his luciferan qualities, the cat was awarded all sorts of  other qualities, not the least important of which was its prophetic  capability. If a cat washed its face, rainy weather was regarded as  inevitable; if a cat frolicked on the deck of a ship, it was a sure sign  of a storm; whilst if a live ember fell on a cat, an earthquake shock  would speedily be felt. Cats, too, were reputed the harbingers of good  and bad fortune. Not a person in Normandy but believed, at one time,  that the spectacle of a tortoiseshell cat, climbing a tree, foretold  death from accident, and that a black cat crossing one's path, in the  moonlight, presaged death from an epidemic. Two black cats viewed in the  open between 4 and 7 a.m. were generally believed to predict a death;  whereas a strange white cat, heard mewing on a doorstep, was loudly  welcomed as the indication of an approaching marriage. According to  tradition, one learns that cats were occasionally made use of in  medicine; to cure peasants of skin diseases, French sorcerers sprinkling  the afflicted parts with three drops of blood drawn from the vein under  a cat's tail; whilst blindness was treated by blowing into the  patient's eyes, three times a day, the dust made from ashes of the head  of a black cat that had been burned alive.    \"Talking of burning cats reminds me of a horrible practice that was  prevalent in the Hebrides as late as 1750. It was firmly believed there  that cats were extraordinarily psychic, and that a sure means of getting  in close touch with occult powers, and of obtaining from them the  faculty of second sight--such as the cat possessed--was to offer up as  sacrifices innumerable black cats. The process was very simple. A black  cat was fastened to a spit before a slow fire, and as soon as the  wretched animal was well roasted, another took its place; victims being  supplied without intermission, until their vociferous screams brought to  the scene a number of ghostly cats who joined in the chorus. The desired  climax was reached, when an enormous phantom cat suddenly appeared, and  informed the operator that it was willing to grant him any one request  if he would only refrain from his cruel persecution. The operator at  once demanded the faculty of second sight--a power more highly prized in  the Hebrides than any other--and the moment it was bestowed on him, set  free the remaining cats. Had all races been as barbarously disposed as  these occult-hungering Westerners, cats would soon have become extinct;  but it is comforting to think that in some parts of the world a very  different value was set on their psychic properties.    \"In various parts of Europe (some districts of England included) white  cats were thought to attract benevolently disposed fairies, and a  peasant would as soon have thought of cutting off his fingers, or  otherwise maltreating himself, as being unkind to an animal of this  species. In the fairy lore of half Europe we have instances of  luck-bringing cats--each country producing its own version of Puss in  Boots, Dame Mitchell and her cat, the White Cat, Dick Whittington and  his cat, etc. It is the same in Asia, too; for nowhere are such stories  more prolific than in China and Persia.    \"To sum up--in all climes and in all periods of past history, the cat  was credited with many propensities that brought it into affinity and  sympathy with the supernatural--or to quote the up-to-date  term--superphysical world. Let us review the cat to-day, and see to what  extent this past regard of it is justified.    \"Firstly, with respect to it as the harbinger of fortune. Has a cat  insight into the future? Can it presage wealth or death? I am inclined  to believe that certain cats can at all events foresee the advent of the  latter; and that they do this in the same manner as the shark, crow,  owl, jackal, hyena, etc., viz. by their abnormally developed sense of  smell. My own and other people's experience has led me to believe that  when a person is about to die, some kind of phantom, maybe, a spirit  whose special function it is to be present on such occasions, is in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18237"],[0,"A Bird Calendar for Northern India (#7)"],[1,"the hills. The solitary denizen of the plains--the little minivet  (_Pericrocotus peregrinus_)--is the least resplendent of them all. Its  prevailing hue is slaty grey, but the cock has a red breast and some  red on the back. The nest is a cup so small as either to be invisible  from below or to present the appearance of a knot or thickening in the  branch on which it is placed. Sometimes two broods are reared in the  course of the year--one in March, April or May and the other during  the rainy season.    The cuckoo-shrike (_Grauculus macii_) is not nearly related to the  cuckoo, nor has it the parasitic habits of the latter. Its grey  plumage is barred like that of the common cuckoo, hence the adjective.  The cuckoo-shrike is nearly as big as a dove. It utters constantly a  curious harsh call. It keeps much to the higher branches of trees in  which it conceals, with great care, its saucer-like nest.    As we have seen, some coppersmiths and pied woodpeckers began nesting  operations in February, but the great majority do not lay eggs until  March.    The green barbet (_Thereoceryx zeylonicus_) and the golden-backed  woodpecker (_Brachypternus aurantius_) are now busy excavating their  nests, which are so similar to those of their respective cousins--the  coppersmith and the pied woodpecker--as to require no description. It  is not necessary to state that the harsh laugh, followed by the  _kutur_, _kutur_, _kuturuk_, of the green barbet and the eternal  _tonk_, _tonk_, _tonk_ of the coppersmith are now more vehement than  ever, and will continue with unabated vigour until the rains have  fairly set in.    By the end of the month many of the noisy rollers have found holes in  decayed trees in which the hens can lay their eggs. The vociferous  nightjars likewise have laid upon the bare ground their salmon-pink  eggs with strawberry-coloured markings.    The noisy spotted owlets (_Athene brama_) and the rose-ringed  paroquets (_Palaeornis torquatus_) are already the happy possessors of  clutches of white eggs hidden away in cavities of decayed trees or  buildings.    The swifts (_Cypselus indicus_) also are busy with their nests. These  are saucer-shaped structures, composed of feathers, straw and other  materials made to adhere together, and to the beam or stone to which  the nest is attached, by the glutinous saliva of the swifts. Deserted  buildings, outhouses and verandahs of bungalows are the usual nesting  sites of these birds. At this season swifts are very noisy. Throughout  the day and at frequent intervals during the night they emit loud  shivering screams. At sunset they hold high carnival, playing, at  breakneck speed and to the accompaniment of much screaming, a game of  \"follow the man from Cook's.\"    The swifts are not the only birds engaged in rearing up young in our  verandahs. Sparrows and doves are so employed, as are the wire-tailed  swallows (_Hirundo smithii_). These last are steel-blue birds with red  heads and white under plumage. They derive the name \"wire-tailed\" from  the fact that the thin shafts of the outer pair of tail feathers are  prolonged five inches beyond the others and look like wires.  Wire-tailed swallows occasionally build in verandahs, but they prefer  to attach their saucer-shaped mud nests to the arches of bridges and  culverts.    With a nest in such a situation the parent birds are not obliged to go  far for the mud with which the nest is made, or for the insects,  caught over the surface of water, on which the offspring are fed.    The nesting season of wire-tailed swallows is a long one. According to  Hume these beautiful birds breed chiefly in February and March and  again in July, August and September. However, he states that he has  seen eggs as early as January and as late as November. In the  Himalayas he has obtained the eggs in April, May and June.    The present writer's experience does not agree with that of Hume. In  Lahore, Saharanpur and Pilibhit, May and June are the months in which  most nests of this species are likely to be seen. The writer has found  nests with eggs or young on the following dates in the above-mentioned  places: May 13th, 15th, 16th, 17th; June 6th and 28th.    The nest of June 28th was attached to a rafter of the front verandah  of a bungalow at Lahore. The owner of the house stated that the  swallows in question had already reared one brood that year, and that  the birds in question had nested in his verandah for some years. There  is no doubt that some wire-tailed swallows bring up two broods. Such  would seem to breed, as Hume says, in February and March and again in  July and August. But, as many nests containing eggs are found in May,  some individuals appear to have one brood only, which hatches out in  May or June.    Those useful but ugly fowls, the white scavenger vultures (_Neophron  ginginianus_), depart from the ways of their brethren in that they  nidificate in March and April instead of in January and February. The  nest is an evil-smelling pile of sticks, rags and rubbish. It is  placed on some building or in a tree.    The handsome brahminy kites (_Haliastur indicus_), attired in chestnut  and white, are now busily occupied, either in seeking for sites or in  actually building their nests, which resemble those of the common  kite.    In the open plains the pipits (_Anthus rufulus_) and the crested larks  (_Galerita cristata_) are keeping the nesting finch-larks company.    All three species build the same kind of nest--a cup of grass or  fibres (often a deep cup in the case of the crested lark) placed on  the ground in a hole or a depression, or protected by a tussock of  grass or a small bush.    On the churs and sand islets in the large Indian rivers the terns are  busy with their eggs, which are deposited on the bare sand. They breed  in colonies. On the same islet are to be seen the eggs of the Indian  river tern, the black-bellied tern, the swallow-plover, the  spur-winged plover and the Indian skimmer.    The eggs of all the above species are of similar appearance, the  ground colour being greenish, or buff, or the hue of stone or cream,  with reddish or brownish blotches. Three is the full complement of  eggs. The bare white glittering sands on which these eggs are  deposited are often at noon so hot as to be painful to touch;  accordingly during the daytime there is no need for the birds to sit  on the eggs in order to keep them warm. Indeed, it has always been a  mystery to the writer why terns' eggs laid in March in northern India  do not get cooked. Mr. A. J. Currie recently came across some eggs of  the black-bellied tern that had had water sprinkled over them. He is  of opinion that the incubating birds treat the eggs thus in order to  prevent their getting sun-baked. This theory should be borne in mind  by those who visit sandbanks in March. Whether it be true or not,  there is certainly no need for the adult birds to keep the eggs warm  in the daytime, and they spend much of their time in wheeling  gracefully overhead or in sleeping on the sand. By nightfall all the  eggs are covered by parent birds, which are said to sit so closely  that it is possible to catch them by means of a butterfly net. The  terns, although they do not sit much on their eggs during the day,  ever keep a close watch on them, so that, when a human being lands on  a nest-laden sandbank, the parent birds fly round his head, uttering  loud screams.    The swallow-plovers go farther. They become so excited that they  flutter about on the sand, with dragging wings and limping legs, as if  badly wounded. Sometimes they perform somersaults in their intense  excitement. The nearer the intruder approaches their eggs the more  vigorous do their antics become.    Every lover of the winged folk should make a point of visiting, late  in March or early in April, an islet on which these birds nest. He  will find much to interest him there. In April many of the young birds  will be hatched out. A baby tern is an amusing object. It is covered  with soft sand-coloured down. When a human being approaches it  crouches on the sand, half burying its head in its shoulders, and  remains thus perfectly motionless. If picked up it usually remains  limply in the hand, so that, but for its warmth, it might be deemed  lifeless. After it has been set down again on the sand, it will remain  motionless until the intruder's back is turned, when it will run to  the water as fast as its little legs can carry it. It swims as easily  as a duck. Needless to state, the parent birds make a great noise  while their young are being handled.    Birds decline to be fettered by the calendar. Many of the species  which do not ordinarily nest until April or May occasionally begin  operations in March, hence nests of the following species, which are  dealt with next month, may occur in the present one:--the tree-pie,  tailor-bird, common myna, bank-myna, brown rock-chat, brown-backed  robin, pied wagtail, red-winged bush-lark, shikra, red-wattled  lapwing, yellow-throated sparrow, bee-eater, blue rock-pigeon, green  pigeon and grey partridge.    March the 15th marks the beginning of the close season for game birds  in all the reserved forests of Northern India. This is none too soon,  as some individuals begin breeding at the end of the month.          APRIL      The breeze moves slow with thick perfume      From every mango grove;    From coral tree to parrot bloom      The black bees questing rove,    The koil wakes the early dawn.
