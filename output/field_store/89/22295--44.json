There is time to spend an hour  in the company of Shen-Yan's opium friends.\"    Weymouth raised his eyebrows.    \"It might be risky.  What about an official visit?\"    Nayland Smith laughed.    \"Worse than useless!  By your own showing, the place is open to  inspection.  No; guile against guile!  We are dealing with a Chinaman,  with the incarnate essence of Eastern subtlety, with the most  stupendous genius that the modern Orient has produced.\"    \"I don't believe in disguises,\" said Weymouth, with a certain  truculence.  \"It's mostly played out, that game, and generally leads to  failure.  Still, if you're determined, sir, there's an end of it.  Foster will make your face up.  What disguise do you propose to adopt?\"    \"A sort of Dago seaman, I think; something like poor Cadby.  I can rely  on my knowledge of the brutes, if I am sure of my disguise.\"    \"You are forgetting me, Smith,\" I said.    He turned to me quickly.    \"Petrie,\" he replied, \"it is MY business, unfortunately, but it is no  sort of hobby.\"    \"You mean that you can no longer rely upon me?\" I said angrily.    Smith grasped my hand, and met my rather frigid stare with a look of  real concern on his gaunt, bronzed face.    \"My dear old chap,\" he answered, \"that was really unkind.  You know  that I meant something totally different.\"    \"It's all right, Smith;\" I said, immediately ashamed of my choler, and  wrung his hand heartily.  \"I can pretend to smoke opium as well as  another.  I shall be going, too, Inspector.\"    As a result of this little passage of words, some twenty minutes later  two dangerous-looking seafaring ruffians entered a waiting cab,  accompanied by Inspector Weymouth, and were driven off into the  wilderness of London's night.  In this theatrical business there was,  to my mind, something ridiculous--almost childish--and I could have  laughed heartily had it not been that grim tragedy lurked so near to  farce.    The mere recollection that somewhere at our journey's end Fu-Manchu  awaited us was sufficient to sober my reflections--Fu-Manchu, who, with  all the powers represented by Nayland Smith pitted against him, pursued  his dark schemes triumphantly, and lurked in hiding within this very  area which was so sedulously patrolled--Fu-Manchu, whom I had never  seen, but whose name stood for horrors indefinable!  Perhaps I was  destined to meet the terrible Chinese doctor to-night.    I ceased to pursue a train of thought which promised to lead to morbid  depths, and directed my attention to what Smith was saying.    \"We will drop down from Wapping and reconnoiter, as you say the place  is close to the riverside.  Then you can put us ashore somewhere below.  Ryman can keep the launch close to the back of the premises, and your  fellows will be hanging about near the front, near enough to hear the  whistle.\"    \"Yes,\" assented Weymouth; \"I've arranged for that.  If you are  suspected, you shall give the alarm?\"    \"I don't know,\" said Smith thoughtfully.  \"Even in that event I might  wait awhile.\"    \"Don't wait too long,\" advised the Inspector.  \"We shouldn't be much  wiser if your next appearance was on the end of a grapnel, somewhere  down Greenwich Reach, with half your fingers missing.\"    The cab pulled up outside the river police depot, and Smith and I  entered without delay, four shabby-looking fellows who had been seated  in the office springing up to salute the Inspector, who followed us in.    \"Guthrie and Lisle,\" he said briskly, \"get along and find a dark corner  which commands the door of Singapore Charlie's off the old Highway.  You look the dirtiest of the troupe, Guthrie; you might drop asleep on  the pavement, and Lisle can argue with you about getting home.  Don't  move till you hear the whistle inside or have my orders, and note  everybody that goes in and comes out.  You other two belong to this  division?\"    The C.I.D. men having departed, the remaining pair saluted again.    \"Well, you're on special duty to-night. You've been prompt, but don't  stick your chests out so much.  Do you know of a back way to  Shen-Yan's?\"    The men looked at one another, and both shook their heads.    \"There's an empty shop nearly opposite, sir,\" replied one of them.  \"I  know a broken window at the back where we could climb in.  Then we  could get through to the front and watch from there.\"    \"Good!\" cried the Inspector.  \"See you are not spotted, though; and if  you hear the whistle, don't mind doing a bit of damage, but be inside  Shen-Yan's like lightning.  Otherwise, wait for orders.\"    Inspector Ryman came in, glancing at the clock.    \"Launch is waiting,\" he said.    \"Right,\" replied Smith thoughtfully.  \"I am half afraid, though, that  the recent alarms may have scared our quarry--your man, Mason, and then  Cadby.  Against which we have that, so far as he is likely to know,  there has been no clew pointing to this opium den.  Remember, he thinks  Cadby's notes are destroyed.\"    \"The whole business is an utter mystery to me,\" confessed Ryman.  \"I'm  told that there's some dangerous Chinese devil hiding somewhere in  London, and that you expect to find him at Shen-Yan's. Supposing he  uses that place, which is possible, how do you know he's there  to-night?\"    \"I don't,\" said Smith; \"but it is the first clew we have had pointing  to one of his haunts, and time means precious lives where Dr. Fu-Manchu  is concerned.\"    \"Who is he, sir, exactly, this Dr. Fu-Manchu?\"    \"I have only the vaguest idea, Inspector; but he is no ordinary  criminal.  He is the greatest genius which the powers of evil have put  on earth for centuries.  He has the backing of a political group whose  wealth is enormous, and his mission in Europe is to PAVE THE WAY!  Do  you follow me?  He is the advance-agent of a movement so epoch-making  that not one Britisher, and not one American, in fifty thousand has  ever dreamed of it.\"    Ryman stared, but made no reply, and we went out, passing down to the  breakwater and boarding the waiting launch.  With her crew of three,  the party numbered seven that swung out into the Pool, and, clearing  the pier, drew in again and hugged the murky shore.    The night had been clear enough hitherto, but now came scudding  rainbanks to curtain the crescent moon, and anon to unveil her again  and show the muddy swirls about us.  The view was not extensive from  the launch.  Sometimes a deepening of the near shadows would tell of a  moored barge, or lights high above our heads mark the deck of a large  vessel.  In the floods of moonlight gaunt shapes towered above; in the  ensuing darkness only the oily glitter of the tide occupied the  foreground of the night-piece.    The Surrey shore was a broken wall of blackness, patched with lights  about which moved hazy suggestions of human activity.  The bank we were  following offered a prospect even more gloomy--a dense, dark mass, amid  which, sometimes, mysterious half-tones told of a dock gate, or sudden  high lights leapt flaring to the eye.    Then, out of the mystery ahead, a green light grew and crept down upon  us.  A giant shape loomed up, and frowned crushingly upon the little  craft.  A blaze of light, the jangle of a bell, and it was past.  We  were dancing in the wash of one of the Scotch steamers, and the murk  had fallen again.    Discords of remote activity rose above the more intimate throbbing of  our screw, and we seemed a pigmy company floating past the workshops of  Brobdingnagian toilers.  The chill of the near water communicated  itself to me, and I felt the protection of my shabby garments  inadequate against it.    Far over on the Surrey shore a blue light--vaporous,  mysterious--flicked translucent tongues against the night's curtain.  It was a weird, elusive flame, leaping, wavering, magically changing  from blue to a yellowed violet, rising, falling.    \"Only a gasworks,\" came Smith's voice, and I knew that he, too, had  been watching those elfin fires.  \"But it always reminds me of a  Mexican teocalli, and the altar of sacrifice.\"    The simile was apt, but gruesome.  I thought of Dr. Fu-Manchu and the  severed fingers, and could not repress a shudder.    \"On your left, past the wooden pier!  Not where the lamp is--beyond  that; next to the dark, square building--Shen-Yan's.\"    It was Inspector Ryman speaking.    \"Drop us somewhere handy, then,\" replied Smith, \"and lie close in, with  your ears wide open.  We may have to run for it, so don't go far away.\"    From the tone of his voice I knew that the night mystery of the Thames  had claimed at least one other victim.    \"Dead slow,\" came Ryman's order.  \"We'll put in to the Stone Stairs.\"        CHAPTER VI      A SEEMINGLY drunken voice was droning from a neighboring alleyway as  Smith lurched in hulking fashion to the door of a little shop above  which, crudely painted, were the words:      \"SHEN-YAN, Barber.\"      I shuffled along behind him, and had time to note the box of studs,  German shaving tackle and rolls of twist which lay untidily in the  window ere Smith kicked the door open, clattered down three wooden  steps, and pulled himself up with a jerk, seizing my arm for support.    We stood in a bare and very dirty room, which could only claim kinship  with a civilized shaving-saloon by virtue of the grimy towel thrown  across the back of the solitary chair.  A Yiddish theatrical bill of  some kind, illustrated, adorned one of the walls, and another bill, in  what may have been Chinese, completed the decorations.  From behind a  curtain heavily brocaded with filth a little Chinaman appeared, dressed  in a loose smock, black trousers and thick-soled slippers, and,  advancing, shook his head vigorously.    \"No shavee--no shavee,\" he chattered, simian fashion,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17306"],[0,"The Condition of the Working-Class in England in 1844 (#7)"],[1,"than 5,000,000 tons for shipping, and employ from 40 to  50,000 men.  According to the Durham _Chronicle_, there were worked in  these two counties: In 1753, 14 mines; in 1800, 40 mines; in 1836, 76  mines; in 1843, 130 mines.  Moreover, all mines are now much more  energetically worked than formerly.  A similarly increased activity was  applied to the working of tin, copper, and lead, and alongside of the  extension of glass manufacture arose a new branch of industry in the  production of pottery, rendered important by the efforts of Josiah  Wedgewood, about 1763.  This inventor placed the whole manufacture of  stoneware on a scientific basis, introduced better taste, and founded the  potteries of North Staffordshire, a district of eight English miles  square, which, formerly a desert waste, is now sown with works and  dwellings, and supports more than 60,000 people.    Into this universal whirl of activity everything was drawn.  Agriculture  made a corresponding advance.  Not only did landed property pass, as we  have already seen, into the hands of new owners and cultivators,  agriculture was affected in still another way.  The great holders applied  capital to the improvement of the soil, tore down needless fences,  drained, manured, employed better tools, and applied a rotation of crops.  The progress of science came to their assistance also; Sir Humphrey Davy  applied chemistry to agriculture with success, and the development of  mechanical science bestowed a multitude of advantages upon the large  farmer.  Further, in consequence of the increase of population, the  demand for agricultural products increased in such measure that from 1760  to 1834, 6,840,540 acres of waste land were reclaimed; and, in spite of  this, England was transformed from a grain exporting to a grain importing  country.    The same activity was developed in the establishment of communication.  From 1818 to 1829, there were built in England and Wales, 1,000 English  miles of roadway of the width prescribed by law, 60 feet, and nearly all  the old roads were reconstructed on the new system of M'Adam.  In  Scotland, the Department of Public Works built since 1803 nearly 900  miles of roadway and more than 1,000 bridges, by which the population of  the Highlands was suddenly placed within reach of civilisation.  The  Highlanders had hitherto been chiefly poachers and smugglers; they now  became farmers and hand-workers.  And, though Gaelic schools were  organised for the purpose of maintaining the Gaelic language, yet Gaelic-  Celtic customs and speech are rapidly vanishing before the approach of  English civilisation.  So, too, in Ireland; between the counties of Cork,  Limerick, and Kerry, lay hitherto a wilderness wholly without passable  roads, and serving, by reason of its inaccessibility, as the refuge of  all criminals and the chief protection of the Celtic Irish nationality in  the South of Ireland.  It has now been cut through by public roads, and  civilisation has thus gained admission even to this savage region.  The  whole British Empire, and especially England, which, sixty years ago, had  as bad roads as Germany or France then had, is now covered by a network  of the finest roadways; and these, too, like almost everything else in  England, are the work of private enterprise, the State having done very  little in this direction.    Before 1755 England possessed almost no canals.  In that year a canal was  built in Lancashire from Sankey Brook to St Helen's; and in 1759, James  Brindley built the first important one, the Duke of Bridgewater's canal  from Manchester, and the coal mines of the district to the mouth of the  Mersey passing, near Barton, by aqueduct, over the river Irwell.  From  this achievement dates the canal building of England, to which Brindley  first gave importance.  Canals were now built, and rivers made navigable  in all directions.  In England alone, there are 2,200 miles of canals and  1,800 miles of navigable river.  In Scotland, the Caledonian Canal was  cut directly across the country, and in Ireland several canals were  built.  These improvements, too, like the railroads and roadways, are  nearly all the work of private individuals and companies.    The railroads have been only recently built.  The first great one was  opened from Liverpool to Manchester in 1830, since which all the great  cities have been connected by rail.  London with Southampton, Brighton,  Dover, Colchester, Exeter, and Birmingham; Birmingham with Gloucester,  Liverpool, Lancaster (via Newton and Wigan, and via Manchester and  Bolton); also with Leeds (via Manchester and Halifax, and via Leicester,  Derby, and Sheffield); Leeds with Hull and Newcastle (via York).  There  are also many minor lines building or projected, which will soon make it  possible to travel from Edinburgh to London in one day.    As it had transformed the means of communication by land, so did the  introduction of steam revolutionise travel by sea.  The first steamboat  was launched in 1807, in the Hudson, in North America; the first in the  British empire, in 1811, on the Clyde.  Since then, more than 600 have  been built in England; and in 1836 more than 500 were plying to and from  British ports.    Such, in brief, is the history of English industrial development in the  past sixty years, a history which has no counterpart in the annals of  humanity.  Sixty, eighty years ago, England was a country like every  other, with small towns, few and simple industries, and a thin but  _proportionally_ large agricultural population.  To-day it is a country  like _no_ other, with a capital of two and a half million inhabitants;  with vast manufacturing cities; with an industry that supplies the world,  and produces almost everything by means of the most complex machinery;  with an industrious, intelligent, dense population, of which two-thirds  are employed in trade and commerce, and composed of classes wholly  different; forming, in fact, with other customs and other needs, a  different nation from the England of those days.  The industrial  revolution is of the same importance for England as the political  revolution for France, and the philosophical revolution for Germany; and  the difference between England in 1760 and in 1844 is at least as great  as that between France, under the _ancien regime_ and during the  revolution of July.  But the mightiest result of this industrial  transformation is the English proletariat.    We have already seen how the proletariat was called into existence by the  introduction of machinery.  The rapid extension of manufacture demanded  hands, wages rose, and troops of workmen migrated from the agricultural  districts to the towns.  Population multiplied enormously, and nearly all  the increase took place in the proletariat.  Further, Ireland had entered  upon an orderly development only since the beginning of the eighteenth  century.  There, too, the population, more than decimated by English  cruelty in earlier disturbances, now rapidly multiplied, especially after  the advance in manufacture began to draw masses of Irishmen towards  England.  Thus arose the great manufacturing and commercial cities of the  British Empire, in which at least three-fourths of the population belong  to the working-class, while the lower middle-class consists only of small  shopkeepers, and very very few handicraftsmen.  For, though the rising  manufacture first attained importance by transforming tools into  machines, workrooms into factories, and consequently, the toiling lower  middle-class into the toiling proletariat, and the former large merchants  into manufacturers, though the lower middle-class was thus early crushed  out, and the population reduced to the two opposing elements, workers and  capitalists, this happened outside of the domain of manufacture proper,  in the province of handicraft and retail trade as well.  In the place of  the former masters and apprentices, came great capitalists and working-  men who had no prospect of rising above their class.  Hand-work was  carried on after the fashion of factory work, the division of labour was  strictly applied, and small employers who could not compete with great  establishments were forced down into the proletariat.  At the same time  the destruction of the former organisation of hand-work, and the  disappearance of the lower middle-class deprived the working-man of all  possibility of rising into the middle-class himself.  Hitherto he had  always had the prospect of establishing himself somewhere as master  artificer, perhaps employing journeymen and apprentices; but now, when  master artificers were crowded out by manufacturers, when large capital  had become necessary for carrying on work independently, the  working-class became, for the first time, an integral, permanent class of  the population, whereas it had formerly often been merely a transition  leading to the bourgeoisie.  Now, he who was born to toil had no other  prospect than that of remaining a toiler all his life.  Now, for the  first time, therefore, the proletariat was in a position to undertake an  independent movement.    In this way were brought together those vast masses of working-men who  now fill the whole British Empire, whose social condition forces itself  every day more and more upon the attention of the civilised world.  The  condition of the working-class is the condition of the vast majority of  the English people.  The question: What is to become of those destitute  millions, who consume to-day what they earned yesterday; who have created  the greatness of England by their inventions and their toil; who become  with every passing day more conscious of their might, and demand, with  daily increasing urgency, their share of the advantages of society?--This,  since the Reform Bill, has become the national question.  All  Parliamentary debates, of any importance, may be reduced to this; and,"]]]
