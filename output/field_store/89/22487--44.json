Skilled journalists in the black press and  counselors and lobbyists presenting such groups as the National  Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the  National Urban League, and the National Negro Congress took the lead  in the fight for racial justice in the United States. They represented  a black community that for the most part lacked the cohesion,  political awareness, and economic strength which would characterize it  in the decades to come. Nevertheless, Negroes had already become a  recognizable political force in some parts of the country. Both the  New Deal politicians and their opponents openly courted the black vote  in the 1940 presidential election.                       [Footnote 1-14: This discussion of civil rights in                     the pre-World War II period draws not only on Lee's                     _Employment of Negro Troops_, but also on Lee                     Finkle, _Forum for Protest: The Black Press During                     World War II_ (Cranbury: Fairleigh Dickinson                     University Press, 1975); Harvard Sitkoff, \"Racial                     Militancy and Interracial Violence in the Second                     World War,\" _Journal of American History_ 58                     (December 1971):661-81; Reinhold Schumann, \"The                     Role of the National Association for the                     Advancement of Colored People in the Integration of                     the Armed Forces According to the NAACP Collection                     in the Library of Congress\" (1971), in CMH; Richard                     M.

In large areas of  the country where lynchings and beatings were commonplace, white  supremacy had existed as a literal fact of life and death.[1-15] More  insidious than the Jim Crow laws were the economic deprivation and  dearth of educational opportunity associated with racial  discrimination. Traditionally the last hired, first fired, Negroes  suffered all the handicaps that came from unemployment and poor jobs,  a condition further aggravated by the Great Depression. The \"separate  but equal\" educational system dictated by law and the realities of  black life in both urban and rural areas, north and south, had proved  anything but equal and thus closed to Negroes a traditional avenue to  advancement in American society.                       [Footnote 1-15: The Jim Crow era is especially well                     described in Rayford W. Logan's _The Negro in                     American Life and Thought: The Nadir, 1877-1901_                     (New York: Dial, 1954) and C. Vann Woodward's _The                     Strange Career of Jim Crow_, 3d ed. rev. (New York:                     Oxford University Press, 1974)]    In these circumstances, the economic and humanitarian programs of the  New Deal had a special appeal for black America. Encouraged by these  programs and heartened by Eleanor Roosevelt's public support of civil  rights, black voters defected from their traditional allegiance to the  Republican Party in overwhelming numbers. But the civil rights leaders  were already aware, if the average black citizen was not, that despite  having made some considerable improvements Franklin Roosevelt never,  in one biographer's words, \"sufficiently challenged Southern       (p. 009)  traditions of white supremacy to create problems for himself.\"[1-16]  Negroes, in short, might benefit materially from the New Deal, but  they would have to look elsewhere for advancement of their civil  rights.                       [Footnote 1-16: Frank Freidel, _F.D.R. and the South_                     (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press,                     1965), pp. 71-102. See also Bayard Rustin,                     _Strategies for Freedom: The Changing Patterns of                     Black Protest_ (New York: Columbia University                     Press, 1976), p. 16.]    Men like Walter F. White of the NAACP and the National Urban League's  T. Arnold Hill sought to use World War II to expand opportunities for  the black American. From the start they tried to translate the  idealistic sentiment for democracy stimulated by the war and expressed  in the Atlantic Charter into widespread support for civil rights in  the United States. At the same time, in sharp contrast to many of  their World War I predecessors, they placed a price on black support  for the war effort: no longer could the White House expect this  sizable minority to submit to injustice and yet close ranks with other  Americans to defeat a common enemy. It was readily apparent to the  Negro, if not to his white supporter or his enemy, that winning  equality at home was just as important as advancing the cause of  freedom abroad. As George S. Schuyler, a widely quoted black  columnist, put it: \"If nothing more comes out of this emergency than  the widespread understanding among white leaders that the Negro's  loyalty is conditional, we shall not have suffered in vain.\"[1-17] The  NAACP spelled out the challenge even more clearly in its monthly  publication, _The Crisis_, which declared itself \"sorry for brutality,  blood, and death among the peoples of Europe, just as we were sorry  for China and Ethiopia. But the hysterical cries of the preachers of  democracy for Europe leave us cold. We want democracy in Alabama,  Arkansas, in Mississippi and Michigan, in the District of Columbia--in  the _Senate of the United States_.\"[1-18]                       [Footnote 1-17: Pittsburgh _Courier_, December 21,                     1940.]                       [Footnote 1-18: _The Crisis_ 47 (July 1940):209.]    This sentiment crystallized in the black press's Double V campaign, a  call for simultaneous victories over Jim Crow at home and fascism  abroad. Nor was the Double V campaign limited to a small group of  civil rights spokesmen; rather, it reflected a new mood that, as  Myrdal pointed out, was permeating all classes of black society.[1-19]  The quickening of the black masses in the cause of equal treatment and  opportunity in the pre-World War II period and the willingness of  Negroes to adopt a more militant course to achieve this end might well  mark the beginning of the modern civil rights movement.                       [Footnote 1-19: Myrdal, _American Dilemma_, p. 744.]    [Illustration: INTEGRATION IN THE ARMY OF 1888. _The Army Band at Fort  Duchesne, Utah, composed of soldiers from the black 9th Cavalry and  the white 21st Infantry._]    Historian Lee Finkle has suggested that the militancy advocated by  most of the civil rights leaders in the World War II era was merely a  rhetorical device; that for the most part they sought to avoid  violence over segregation, concentrating as before on traditional  methods of protest.[1-20] This reliance on traditional methods was  apparent when the leaders tried to focus the new sentiment among  Negroes on two war-related goals: equality of treatment in the armed  forces and equality of job opportunity in the expanding defense  industries. In 1938 the Pittsburgh _Courier_, the largest and one  (p. 010)  of the most influential of the nation's black papers, called upon the  President to open the services to Negroes and organized the Committee  for Negro Participation in the National Defense Program. These moves  led to an extensive lobbying effort that in time spread to many other  newspapers and local civil rights groups. The black press and its  satellites also attracted the support of several national  organizations that were promoting preparedness for war, and these  groups, in turn, began to demand equal treatment and opportunity in  the armed forces.[1-21]                       [Footnote 1-20: Lee Finkle, \"The Conservative Aims of                     Militant Rhetoric: Black Protest During World War                     II,\" _Journal of American History_ 60 (December                     1973):693.]                       [Footnote 1-21: Some impression of the extent of this                     campaign and its effect on the War Department can                     be gained from the volume of correspondence                     produced by the Pittsburgh _Courier_ campaign and                     filed in AG 322.99 (2-23-38)(1).]    The government began to respond to these pressures before the United  States entered World War II. At the urging of the White House the Army  announced plans for the mobilization of Negroes, and Congress amended  several mobilization measures to define and increase the military  training opportunities for Negroes.[1-22] The most important of these  legislative amendments in terms of influence on future race relations  in the United States were made to the Selective Service Act of 1940.  The matter of race played only a small part in the debate on this  highly controversial legislation, but during congressional hearings on  the bill black spokesmen testified on discrimination against Negroes  in the services.[1-23] These witnesses concluded that if the draft law  did not provide specific guarantees against it, discrimination would  prevail.                       [Footnote 1-22: The Army's plans and amendments are                     treated in great detail in Lee, _Employment of                     Negro Troops_.]                       [Footnote 1-23: Hearings Before the Committee on                     Military Affairs.

This impending gloom  corresponded with their malignant dispositions; but when the sun began to  break through the clouds they ordered a pavilion to be raised, as a  screen from the intrusion of his beams.  The Caliph, overcome with  fatigue, sought refreshment from repose, at the same time hoping that  significant dreams might attend on his slumbers; whilst the indefatigable  Carathis, followed by a party of her mutes, descended to prepare whatever  she judged proper for the oblation of the approaching night.    By secret stairs, known only to herself and to her son, she first  repaired to the mysterious recesses in which were deposited the mummies  that had been brought from the catacombs of the ancient Pharaohs; of  these she ordered several to be taken.  From thence she resorted to a  gallery where, under the guard of fifty female negroes, mute and blind of  the right eye, were preserved the oil of the most venomous serpents,  rhinoceros' horns, and woods of a subtle and penetrating odour procured  from the interior of the Indies, together with a thousand other horrible  rarities.  This collection had been formed for a purpose like the present  by Carathis herself, from a presentment that she might one day enjoy some  intercourse with the infernal powers to whom she had ever been  passionately attached, and to whose taste she was no stranger.    To familiarise herself the better with the horrors in view, the princess  remained in the company of her negresses, who squinted in the most  amiable manner from the only eye they had, and leered with exquisite  delight at the skulls and skeletons which Carathis had drawn forth from  her cabinets, whose key she entrusted to no one; all of them making  contortions, and uttering a frightful jargon, but very amusing to the  princess; till at last, being stunned by their gibbering, and suffocated  by the potency of their exhalations, she was forced to quit the gallery,  after stripping it of a part of its treasures.    Whilst she was thus occupied, the Caliph, who, instead of the visions he  expected, had acquired in these insubstantial regions a voracious  appetite, was greatly provoked at the negresses; for, having totally  forgotten their deafness, he had impatiently asked them for food, and  seeing them regardless of his demand, he began to cuff, pinch, and push  them, till Carathis arrived to terminate a scene so indecent, to the  great content of these miserable creatures, who, having been brought up  by her, understood all her signs, and communicated in the same way their  thoughts in return.    \"Son! what means all this?\" said she, panting for breath.  \"I thought I  heard as I came up the shrieks of a thousand bats tearing from their  crannies in the recesses of a cavern; and it was the outcry only of these  poor mutes, whom you were so unmercifully abusing.  In truth you but ill  deserve the admirable provision I have brought you.\"    \"Give it me instantly,\" exclaimed the Caliph; \"I am perishing for  hunger!\"    \"As to that,\" answered she, \"you must have an excellent stomach if it can  digest what I have been preparing.\"    \"Be quick,\" replied the Caliph; \"but, oh, heavens! what horrors! what do  you intend?\"    \"Come, come,\" returned Carathis, \"be not so squeamish, but help me to  arrange everything properly, and you shall see that what you reject with  such symptoms of disgust will soon complete your felicity.  Let us get  ready the pile for the sacrifice of to-night, and think not of eating  till that is performed; know you not that all solemn rites are preceded  by a rigorous abstinence?\"    The Caliph, not daring to object, abandoned himself to grief and the wind  that ravaged his entrails, whilst his mother went forward with the  requisite operations.  Phials of serpents' oil, mummies, and bones were  soon set in order on the balustrade of the tower; the pile began to rise,  and in three hours was as many cubits high.  At length darkness  approached, and Carathis, having stripped herself to her inmost garment,  clapped her hands in an impulse of ecstasy and struck light with all her  force.  The mutes followed her example; but Vathek, extenuated with  hunger and impatience, was unable to support himself, and fell down in a  swoon.  The sparks had already kindled the dry wood, the venomous oil  burst into a thousand blue flames, the mummies dissolving emitted a thick  dun vapour, and the rhinoceros' horns beginning to consume, all together  diffused such a stench, that the Caliph, recovering, started from his  trance, and gazed wildly on the scene in full blaze around him.  The oil  gushed forth in a plenitude of streams; and the negresses, who supplied  it without intermission, united their cries to those of the princess.  At  last the fire became so violent, and the flames reflected from the  polished marble so dazzling, that the Caliph, unable to withstand the  heat and the blaze, effected his escape, and clambered up the imperial  standard.    In the meantime the inhabitants of Samarah, scared at the light which  shone over the city, arose in haste, ascended their roofs, beheld the  tower on fire, and hurried half naked to the square.  Their love to their  sovereign immediately awoke; and, apprehending him in danger of perishing  in his tower, their whole thoughts were occupied with the means of his  safety.  Morakanabad flew from his retirement, wiped away his tears, and  cried out for water like the rest.  Bababalouk, whose olfactory nerves  were more familiarised to magical odours, readily conjecturing that  Carathis was engaged in her favourite amusements, strenuously exhorted  them not to be alarmed.  Him, however, they treated as an old poltroon,  and forbore not to style him a rascally traitor.  The camels and  dromedaries were advancing with water, but no one knew by which way to  enter the tower.  Whilst the populace was obstinate in forcing the doors  a violent east wind drove such a volume of flame against them, as at  first forced them off, but afterwards re-kindled their zeal; at the same  time the stench of the horns and mummies increasing, most of the crowd  fell backward in a state of suffocation; those that kept their feet  mutually wondered at the cause of the smell, and admonished each other to  retire.  Morakanabad, more sick than the rest, remained in a piteous  condition; holding his nose with one hand, he persisted in his efforts  with the other to burst open the doors and obtain admission.  A hundred  and forty of the strongest and most resolute at length accomplished their  purpose; having gained the staircase by their violent exertions, they  attained a great height in a quarter of an hour.    Carathis, alarmed at the signs of her mutes, advanced to the staircase,  went down a few steps, and heard several voices calling out from below:  \"You shall in a moment have water!\"  Being rather alert, considering her  age, she presently regained the top of the tower, and bade her son  suspend the sacrifice for some minutes, adding: \"We shall soon be enabled  to render it more grateful; certain dolts of your subjects, imagining no  doubt that we were on fire, have been rash enough to break through those  doors which had hitherto remained inviolate, for the sake of bringing up  water; they are very kind, you must allow, so soon to forget the wrongs  you have done them, but that is of little moment.  Let us offer them to  the Giaour; let them come up; our mutes, who neither want strength nor  experience, will soon despatch them, exhausted as they are with fatigue.\"    \"Be it so,\" answered the Caliph, \"provided we finish and I dine.\"    In fact, these good people, out of breath from ascending eleven thousand  stairs in such haste, and chagrined at having spilt by the way the water  they had taken, were no sooner arrived at the top than the blaze of the  flames and the fumes of the mummies at once overpowered their senses.  It  was a pity; for they beheld not the agreeable smile with which the mutes  and the negresses adjusted the cord to their necks; these amiable  personages rejoiced, however, no less at the scene; never before had the  ceremony of strangling been performed with so much facility; they all  fell without the least resistance or struggle, so that Vathek in the  space of a few moments found himself surrounded by the dead bodies of his  faithfullest subjects, all which were thrown on the top of the pile.    Carathis, whose presence of mind never forsook her, perceiving that she  had carcases sufficient to complete her oblation, commanded the chains to  be stretched across the staircase, and the iron doors barricaded, that no  more might come up.    No sooner were these orders obeyed than the tower shook, the dead bodies  vanished in the flames, which at once changed from a swarthy crimson to a  bright rose colour; an ambient vapour emitted the most exquisite  fragrance, the marble columns rang with harmonious sounds, and the  liquefied horns diffused a delicious perfume.  Carathis, in transports,  anticipated the success of her enterprise, whilst her mutes and  negresses, to whom these sweets had given the colic, retired to their  cells grumbling.    Scarcely were they gone when, instead of the pile, horns, mummies, and  ashes, the Caliph both saw and felt, with a degree of pleasure which he  could not express, a table covered with the most magnificent repast;  flagons of wine and vases of exquisite sherbet floating on snow.  He  availed himself without scruple of such an entertainment and had already  laid hands on a lamb stuffed with pistachios, whilst Carathis was  privately drawing from a filigree urn a parchment that seemed to be  endless, and which had escaped the notice of her son; totally occupied in  gratifying an importunate appetite he left her to peruse it without  interruption,"]]]
