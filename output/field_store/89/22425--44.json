The porch  itself is vaulted in two bays, the vaulting springing from slender  shafts of Purbeck marble which rest on the stone seats on either side of  the porch. The bosses in which the ribs meet are carved with foliage.  Over the porch is a small room to which no staircase now leads; one  which formerly led to it was removed in the seventeenth century. This  room is lighted by a small two-light Decorated window facing north.    [Illustration: THE INTERIOR, LOOKING EAST.]    The two #Aisles# are of the same length as the nave, and are  divided from it by an arcading on either side, each containing six  pointed arches. The easternmost arches consist of two plain orders, and  are much narrower than the rest. These arches spring on the east side  from brackets on the western face of the tower piers: the bracket on the  north side is plain, that on the south side is ornamented with a kind of  scale carving. These bays were probably of the same date as the tower,  and it is not unlikely that the arches were at first like those of the  tower, of the usual round-headed form. If they were altered when the  remainder of the nave was built, the wall above was not removed. The  piers which support the western side of these arches consist each of a  semi-cylindrical pillar set against a rectangular pier, on the other  side of which another semi-cylindrical shaft is set to support the next  arch; the next two pillars on each side are cylindrical, perfectly plain  in the shafts with very simple bases and capitals. The latter may be  seen in the illustrations, the former are concealed by the pews. It  will be noticed as a peculiar feature that a little piece of the outer  moulding, facing the nave, of the first large arch on the south side is  differently carved from all the rest: first, counting from the bottom  upwards, are three eight-leaved flowers--these are succeeded by three  four-leaved flowers, all on a chamfered edge; above this the moulding  is not chamfered, and the outer face is decorated with shallow zig-zag  carving. The second member of the moulding consists of chevron work  somewhat irregularly carved, the projecting tooth-like points not being  all of the same size; in the centre is a roll moulding, from each side  of which chevron ornamentation projects, the points directed outward  perpendicular to the plane of the arch. These pillars and arches are  noteworthy in that the piers are of considerable size, and above them  are pointed arches. This would indicate a rather late date in the Norman  period for this portion of the church; probably it was built at some  time during the last quarter of the twelfth century. With the third wide  bay the twelfth-century church terminated, the two arches to the west  of these being characterised by ornamentation of the Decorated period.  At this time, as has been already explained (p. 10), the aisles were  widened and the inner edges of the roofs raised above the clerestory  windows of the Norman church. Four such windows, round-headed, each  placed over the point of an arch, may be seen on either side of the  nave; but the eastern one on each side differs from the other three  in being of heavier character and rougher workmanship. The external  mouldings of these can be well seen from the aisles: towards the nave  they are splayed and plain. The wall above the fourteenth-century arches  does not contain any windows on the same level as those of the old  Norman clerestory; but above them, stretching all along each side of  the nave, may be seen the windows of the present clerestory. These are  Perpendicular in style, and are five in number on each side, each window  being placed over one of the piers of the nave arcading. These windows  are square-headed, and have at the bottom three lights, each light being  sub-divided into two at the top. It is believed that this clerestory  was formed when the walls were raised, at the same time as the western  tower was erected--namely, at the end of the fifteenth century. But  to return to the Decorated arches at the west end of the nave. The  pier at the eastern side of the easternmost of these consists of the  semi-cylindrical respond of Norman date, a piece of masonry which was  part of the west wall of the Norman church; and then on the western  side of this an added semi-cylinder, on the capitals of which may be  seen the ball-flower ornament. The pier on either side, between the two  fourteenth-century arches, is octagonal, with a very plain capital (one  of these is shown in the illustration on page 57); the arches themselves  are also plain, consisting of two members with chamfered edges. The half  pillars at the western side of the western arch have been imbedded in  the octagonal buttresses of the west tower, which project into the  church.    [Illustration: PIER AND ARCH-SPRING IN THE SOUTH ARCADE.]    [Illustration: DECORATED ARCH IN THE NAVE.]    The height of the nave roof appears to have been altered on several  occasions. There may be seen from the interior of the nave, on the  west wall of the lantern tower, two lines running from the level of  the tops of the Norman clerestory windows: these make an angle of about  forty-five degrees with the horizontal, and, no doubt, are traces of the  weather mouldings marking the position of the exterior of the roof of  the nave in Norman times. Probably the roof visible from the interior  was flat and formed of wood, and ran across in the line of the string  course above the tower arch, at a level slightly above the heads of the  clerestory windows. A round-headed opening above this string course  probably gave admission to the space between the outer and inner roofs.  At a somewhat higher level, we have a slight trace which probably marks  the junction of the fifteenth-century roof with the tower. This roof  was of oak and very plain--at the restoration the pitch of the roof was  raised and carried up to such an extent as to cut off the bases of the  clerestory windows of the lantern tower; the inner roof itself is of  pitch-pine, with hammer-beams of the character which finds such favour  with nineteenth-century architects.    [Illustration: CLERESTORY STAGE OF THE CENTRAL TOWER.]    The #Central Tower#, the oldest and probably most interesting part  of the church, consists of four stages, of which the three lower ones  are open to the church. The lowest of these was undoubtedly part of the  original Norman church; the second or triforium was soon added. Above  this comes the clerestory, the pointed arch between the round-headed  windows indicating a somewhat later date; and above this there is a  chamber perfectly plain within, and not open to the church below. The  outside of this is decorated with an arcading of intersecting arches,  which indicates a somewhat later date. These intersecting arches form  seven pointed arches on each side--five of these were originally open to  allow the sound of the bells, which were formerly hung in the tower, to  pass out; but to add strength to the walls all but the middle ones on  the east face were at various periods walled up. At one time the tower  was surmounted by a spire, possibly of wood covered with lead; this is  supposed to have been erected by John de Berwick, who was dean of the  minster from 1286 to 1312. The squinches which supported this spire may  still be seen in the upper stage just described. Descending from this  stage by a spiral staircase in the north-west angle, we find ourselves  in the clerestory already mentioned. In each face there are two  round-headed windows widely splayed on the interior, with shafts in  the jambs; between each pair of windows is a pointed arch, in each  angle of the tower is a slender shaft encircled by three bands at about  equidistant intervals: a passage cut in the thickness of the wall runs  round this stage. Again descending, we reach the triforium level. Each  of the walls of this stage has two pointed sustaining arches built into  the wall to support the weight of the superincumbent masonry; each of  these encloses four semi-circular headed arches with shafts of Purbeck  marble. The capitals of these are rudely carved, and between the  relieving pointed arches are carved heads, that on the north side being  the most noteworthy. The passage behind the arches is very narrow, the  total thickness of the walls being only 4 feet 6 inches. At the centre  of each face are the openings which formerly led into the spaces between  the roofs and ceilings of the nave, transepts, and choir of the Norman  church. That on the north side now leads into a stone gallery, erected  in 1891 in the place of a dilapidated wooden structure, which runs first  westward to the angle between the tower and north transept, then along  the west face of the transept until it reaches a door leading into the  stair turret, which may be seen from the exterior. At the bottom of this  is a door opening into the transept. This stair turret projects slightly  into the transept. The lowest stage of the tower consists of four arches  and four massive piers. The arches have two plain orders. The piers have  double shafts supporting the central order, and single shafts supporting  the outer orders. The four arches are not of the same width, those on  the east and west being wider than those on the north and south. In  order to get the arches to spring from the same level and also to reach  the same height at their heads, the wider arches are of the shape known  as \"depressed,\" while the narrower ones are of the \"horse-shoe\" type.  The choir being somewhat narrower than the nave, the walls on each side  take the place of the shaft which would have supported the outer order  of the eastern arch. The capitals and bases of these arches are very  plain, in fact nowhere in this church can the elaborately-carved  capitals so often met with in late Norman work be found. This central  tower was undoubtedly "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19529"],[0,"Nala and Damayanti and Other Poems (#7)"],[1," that fell king of beasts      Go towards the crystal river--flowing downward to the sea.'--      To this mountain then the holy--crowned with many a lofty peak,      In its soul-exalting splendour--rising, many-hued, to heaven;      Full within of precious metal--rich with many a glowing gem,      Rising o'er the spreading forest--like a banner broad and high,      Ranged by elephants and lions--tigers, bears, and boars, and stags;      And of many birds the voices--sweetly sound o'er all its cliffs;      All the trees of richest foliage[76]--all the trees of stateliest height,      All the flowers and golden fruitage--on its crested summits wave,      Down its peaks in many a streamlet--dip the water-birds their wings:      This, the monarch of all mountains--ask I of the king of men;      'O, all-honoured Prince of Mountains, with thy heaven-ward soaring peaks,      Refuge of the lost, most noble--thee, O Mountain, I salute;      I salute thee, lowly bowing--I, the daughter of a king;      Of a king the royal consort--of a king's son I the bride.

Damayanti then set forward--toward the region of the north.      Three days long, three nights she wandered--then that noble woman saw,      The unrivalled wood of hermits--like to a celestial grove.      To the ancient famous hermits[81]--equal was that sacred crew;      Self-denying, strict in diet[82]--temperate, and undefiled;      Water-drinking, air inhaling--and the leaves their simple food;      Mortified, for ever blessed--seeking the right way to heaven;      Bark for vests and skins for raiment--wore those hermits, sense-subdued.      She beheld the pleasant circle--of those hermits' lonely cells;      Round them flocks of beasts were grazing--wantoned there the monkey tribes.      When she saw those holy dwellings--all her courage was revived.      Lovely browed, and lovely tressed--lovely bosom'd, lovely lipp'd,[83]      In her brightness, in her glory--with her large dark beauteous eyes,      Entered she those hermit dwellings--wife of Virasena's son;      Pearl of women, ever blessed-Damayanti the devout,      She those holy men saluting--stood with modest form half bent.      \"Hail, and welcome!\" thus those hermits--instant with one voice exclaimed.      And those sacred men no sooner--had the fitting homage paid,      \"Take thy seat,\" they said, \"oh lady[84]--and command what we must do.\"      Thus replied the slender waisted--\"Blessed are ye, holy men.      In your sacred fires, your worship[85]--blameless, with your beasts and          birds.[86]      Doth the grace of heaven attend you--in your duties, in your deeds?\"      Answered they, \"The grace of heaven--ever blesses all our deeds.      But say thou, of form so beauteous--who thou art, and what thou would'st?      As thy noble form we gaze on--on thy brightness as we gaze,      In amaze we stand and wonder--cheer thee up, and mourn no more.      Of the wood art thou the goddess--or the mountain goddess thou;      Or the goddess of the river?--Blessed Spirit, speak the truth.      Nor the sylvan goddess am I,\"--to the Wise she thus replied;      \"Neither of the mountain, Brahmins--nor the river nymph am I.      Know me but a mortal being--O, ye rich in holiness!      All my tale at length, I'll tell ye--if meet audience ye will give.      In Vidarbha, mighty guardian--Bhima, dwells the lord of earth;      Of that noble king the daughter--twice-born Sages, know ye me.[87]      And the monarch of Nishadha--Nala named, the great in fame;      Brave in battle, conqueror, prudent--is my lord, the peasants' king;      To the gods devout in worship--friendly to the Brahmin race,      Of Nishadha's race the guardian--great in glory, great in might,      True in word, and skilled in duty--and the slayer of his foes.      Pious, heaven-devoted, prosperous--conqueror of hostile towns;      Nala named, the best of sovereigns--splendid as the king of gods.

He to some most evil minded--unrespected, wicked men,      After many a challenge, studious--he of virtue and of truth,      To these skilful gamesters, fraudful--lost his kingdom and his wealth.      Know ye me the hapless consort--of that noble king of kings,      Damayanti, so they name me--yearning for my husband's sight.      I through forests, over mountains--stagnant marsh and river broad,      Lake with wide pellucid surface--through the long and trackless wood,      Ever seeking for my husband--Nala, skilful in the fight.      Mighty in the use of weapons--wander desolate and sad.      Tell me, to this pleasant sojourn--sacred to these holy men,      Hath he come, the royal Nala?--hath Nishadha's monarch come?      For whose sake through ways all trackless--terrible, have I set forth,      In this drear, appalling forest--where the lynx and tiger range,      If I see not noble Nala--ere few days, few nights are o'er,      I to happiness will join me--from this mortal frame set free.      Reft of him, my princely husband--what have I to do with life--      How endure existence longer--for my husband thus distressed.\"      To the lady thus complaining--lonely in the savage wood,      Answered thus those holy hermits--spake the gifted seers the truth:--      \"There will be a time hereafter--beautiful, the time will come,      Through devotion now we see him[88]--and thou too wilt see him soon;      That good monarch of Nishadha--Nala, slayer of his foes;      That dispenser of strict justice--Bhima's daughter! free from grief,      From all sin released, thou'lt see him--glittering in his royal gems,      Governing that noble city--o'er his enemies supreme.      To his foemen causing terror--to his friends allaying grief,      Thou, oh noble, shalt thy husband--see, that king of noble race.\"      To the much-loved wife of Nala--to the princess speaking thus,      Vanished then those holy hermits--with their sacred fires, their cells.      As she gazed upon the wonder--wrapt in mute amaze she stood;      Damayanti, fair-limbed princess--wife of Virasena's son;      \"Have I only seen a vision--what hath been this wondrous chance?      Where are all those holy hermits--where the circle of their cells?      Where that pure and pleasant river--haunted by the dipping birds?      Where those trees with grateful umbrage--with their pendant fruits and          flowers?\"      Long within her heart she pondered--Damayanti with sweet smile,      For her lord, to grief abandoned--miserable, pale of hue;      To another region passed she--there with voice by weeping choked,      Mourns she, till with eyes o'erflowing--an Asoca tree she saw.      Best of trees, the Asoca blooming[89]--in the forest she approached,      Gemmed all o'er with glowing fruitage--vocal with the songs of birds.        \"Ah, behold amid the forest--flourishes this happy tree,      With its leafy garlands radiant--as the joyous mountain king.      O thou tree with pleasant aspect--from my sorrow set me free.      Vitasoca, hast thou seen him--hast the fearless raja seen,      Nala, of his foes the slayer--Damayanti's lord beloved?      Hast thou seen Nishadha's monarch--hast thou seen mine only love,      Clad in half a single garment--with his soft and delicate skin;      Hast thou seen th' afflicted hero--wandering in the forest lone.
