[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1825"],[0,"The Adventures of Reddy Fox (#7)"],[1,"ause, you know, old Granny Fox had slipped  away through the hollow tree trunk.    Granny Fox grinned as she listened to the terrible fuss Bowser was  making. Then, when she had rested a little, she stole up on the hill  where she could look down and see the entrance to the old deserted  house. She watched Bowser digging and barking. After a while a worried  look crept into the face of old Granny Fox.    \"Where's Farmer Brown's boy? I thought surely he would follow Bowser the  Hound,\" she muttered.          XXI. Reddy Fox Disobeys    When old Granny Fox had sent Reddy Fox into the house and told him to  stay there until she returned home, he had not wanted to mind, but he  knew that Granny Fox meant just what she said, and so he had crawled  slowly down the long hall to the bedroom, way underground.    Pretty soon Reddy Fox heard a voice. It was very faint, for you know  Reddy was in his bedroom way underground, but he knew it. He pricked up  his ears and listened. It was the voice of Bowser the Hound, and Reddy  knew by the sound that Bowser was chasing Granny Fox.    Reddy grinned. He wasn't at all worried about Granny Fox, not the least  little bit. He knew how smart she was and that whenever she wanted to,  she could get rid of Bowser the Hound. Then a sudden thought popped into  Reddy's head, and he grew sober.    \"Granny did feel trouble coming, just as she said,\" he thought.    Then Reddy Fox curled himself up and tried to sleep. He intended to mind  and not put his little black nose outside until old Granny Fox returned.  But somehow Reddy couldn't get to sleep. His bedroom was small, and he  was so stiff and sore that he could not get comfortable. He twisted and  turned and fidgeted. The more he fidgeted, the more uncomfortable he  grew. He thought of the warm sunshine outside and how comfortable he  would be, stretched out full length on the doorstep. It would take the  soreness out of his legs. Something must have happened to Granny to keep  her so long. If she had known that she was going to be gone such a long  time, she wouldn't have told him to stay until she came back, thought  Reddy.    By and by Reddy Fox crept a little way up the long, dark hall. He could  just see the sunlight on the doorstep. Pretty soon he went a little bit  nearer. He wasn't going to disobey old Granny Fox. Oh, no! No, indeed!  She had told him to stay in the house until she returned. She hadn't  said that he couldn't look out! Reddy crawled a little nearer to the  open door and the sunlight.    \"Granny Fox is getting old and timid. Just as if my eyes aren't as sharp  as hers! I'd like to see Farmer Brown's boy get near me when I am really  on the watch,\" said Reddy Fox to himself. And then he crept a little  nearer to the open door.    How bright and warm and pleasant it did look outside! Reddy just knew  that he would feel ever and ever so much better if he could stretch  out on the doorstep. He could hear Jenny Wren fussing and scolding at  someone or something, and he wondered what it could be. He crept just a  wee bit nearer. He could hear Bowser's voice, but it was so faint that  he had to prick up his sharp little ears and listen with all his might  to hear it at all.    \"Granny's led them way off on the mountain. Good old Granny!\" thought  Reddy Fox. Then he crawled right up to the very doorway. He could still  hear Jenny Wren scolding and fussing.    \"What does ail her?          \"If it's hot or if it's cold,        Jenny Wren will always scold.        From morn till night the whole day long        Her limber tongue is going strong.    \"I'm going to find out what it means,\" said Reddy, talking to himself.    Reddy Fox poked his head out and--looked straight into the freckled face  of Farmer Brown's boy and the muzzle of that dreadful gun!          XXII. Ol' Mistah Buzzard's Keen Sight    Old Granny Fox had thought that when she fooled Bowser the Hound up  in the old pasture on the edge of the mountain she could take her time  going home. She was tired and hot, and she had planned to pick out the  shadiest paths going back. She had thought that Farmer Brown's boy would  soon join Bowser the Hound, when Bowser made such a fuss about having  found the old house into which Granny Fox had run.    But Farmer Brown's boy had not yet appeared, and Granny Fox was getting  worried. Could it be that he had not followed Bowser the Hound, after  all? Granny Fox went out on a high point and looked, but she could see  nothing of Farmer Brown's boy and his gun. Just then Ol' Mistah Buzzard  came sailing down out of the blue, blue sky and settled himself on a  tall, dead tree. Now Granny Fox hadn't forgotten how Ol' Mistah Buzzard  had warned Peter Rabbit just as she was about to pounce on him, but she  suddenly thought that Ol' Mistah Buzzard might be of use to her.    So old Granny Fox smoothed out her skirts and walked over to the foot of  the tree where Ol' Mistah Buzzard sat.    \"How do you do today, neighbor Buzzard?\" inquired Granny Fox, smiling up  at Ol' Mistah Buzzard.    \"Ah'm so as to be up and about, thank yo',\" replied Ol' Mistah Buzzard,  spreading his wings out so that air could blow under them.    \"My!\" exclaimed old Granny Fox, \"what splendid great wings you have,  Mistah Buzzard! It must be grand to be able to fly. I suppose you  can see a great deal from way up there in the blue, blue sky, Mistah  Buzzard.\"    Ol' Mistah Buzzard felt flattered. \"Yes,\" said he, \"Ah can see all  that's going on on the Green Meadows and in the Green Forest.\"    \"Oh, Mistah Buzzard, you don't really mean that!\" exclaimed old Granny  Fox, just as if she wanted to believe it, but couldn't.    \"Yes, Ah can!\" replied Ol' Mistah Buzzard.    \"Really, Mistah Buzzard? Really? Oh, I can't believe that your eyes are  so sharp as all that! Now I know where Bowser the Hound is and where  Farmer Brown's boy is, but I don't believe you can see them,\" said  Granny Fox.    Ol' Mistah Buzzard never said a word but spread his broad wings and in  a few minutes he had sailed up, up, up until he looked like just a tiny  speck to old Granny Fox. Now old Granny Fox had not told the truth when  she said she knew where Farmer Brown's boy was. She thought she would  trick Ol' Mistah Buzzard into telling her.    In a few minutes down came Ol' Mistah Buzzard. \"Bowser the Hound is up  in the old back pasture,\" said he.    \"Right!\" cried old Granny Fox, clapping her hands. \"And where is Farmer  Brown's boy?\"    \"Farmer Brown's boy is...\" Ol' Mistah Buzzard paused.    \"Where? Where?\" asked Granny Fox, so eagerly that Ol' Mistah Buzzard  looked at her sharply.    \"Yo' said you knew, so what's the use of telling yo'?\" said Ol' Mistah  Buzzard. Then he added: \"But if Ah was yo', Ah cert'nly would get home  right smart soon.\"    \"Why? Do, do tell me what you saw, Mistah Buzzard!\" begged Granny Fox.    But Ol' Mistah Buzzard wouldn't say another word, so old Granny Fox  started for home as fast as she could run.    \"Oh dear, I do hope Reddy Fox minded me and stayed in the house,\" she  muttered.          XXIII. Granny Fox Has a Terrible Scare    Old Granny Fox felt her heart sink way down to her toes, for she felt  sure Ol' Mistah Buzzard had seen Farmer Brown's boy and his gun over  near the house where Reddy Fox was nursing his wounds, or he wouldn't  have advised her to hurry home. She was already very tired and hot from  the long run to lead Bowser the Hound away from the Green Meadows. She  had thought to walk home along shady paths and cool off, but now she  must run faster than ever, for she must know if Farmer Brown's boy had  found her house.    \"It's lucky I told Reddy Fox to go inside and not come out till I  returned; it's very lucky I did that,\" thought Granny Fox as she ran.  Presently she heard voices singing. They seemed to be in the treetops  over her head.          \"Happily we dance and play        All the livelong sunny day!        Happily we run and race        And win or lose with smiling face!\"    Granny Fox knew the voices, and she looked up. Just as she expected, she  saw the Merry Little Breezes of Old Mother West Wind playing among the  leaves. Just then one of them looked down and saw her.    \"There's old Granny Fox! Just see how hot and tired she looks. Let's go  down and cool her off!\" shouted the Merry Little Breeze.    In a flash they were all down out of the treetops and dancing around  old Granny Fox, cooling her off. Of course, Granny Fox kept right on  running. She was too worried not to. But the Merry Little Breezes kept  right beside her, and it was not nearly as hard running now as it had  been.    \"Have you seen Farmer Brown's boy?\" panted Granny Fox.    \"Oh, yes! We saw him just a little while ago over near your house,  Granny Fox. We pulled his hat off, just to hear him scold,\" shouted the  Merry Little Breezes, and then they tickled and laughed as if they had  had a good time with Farmer Brown's boy.    But old Granny Fox didn't laugh--oh, my, no, indeed! Her heart went  lower still, and she did her best to run faster. Pretty soon she came  out on the top of the hill where she could look, and then it seemed as  if her heart came right up in her mouth and stopped beating. Her eyes  popped almost out of her head. There was Farmer Brown's boy standing  right in front of the door of her home. And while she was watching, what  should Reddy Fox do but stick his head out the door.    Old Granny Fox saw the gun of Farmer Brown's boy pointed right at Reddy  and she clapped both hands over her eyes to shut out the dreadful sight.  Then she waited for the bang of the gun. It didn't come. Then Granny  peeped through her fingers. Farmer Brown's boy was still there, but  Reddy Fox had disappeared inside the house.    Granny Fox sighed in relief. It had been a terrible scare, the worst she  could remember.          XXIV. Granny and Reddy Have To Move    \"I don't want to move,\" whined Reddy Fox. \"I'm too sore to walk.\"    Old Granny Fox"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18253"],[0,"Discovery of Witches (#7)"],[1,"           \"As him      Who did the saintship sever      From the opinion; this fails, that shall never,      Chymist of Truth and Gospel;\"--    are, also, evidently Webster's, and their quality is not such as to  make us unreasonably impatient for any further manifestations of his  poetical skill. In the year 1654 he published another tract of  singular interest and curiosity, in which he attacks the Universities  and the received system of education there, always with vigour and  various learning, and frequently with success. It is entitled  \"Academiarum Examen, or the Examination of Academies; wherein is  discussed and examined the matter, method, and customes of academick  and scholastic learning, and the insufficiency thereof discovered and  laid open; as also some expedients proposed for the reforming of  schools, and the perfecting and promoting of all kind of science;  offered to the judgment of all those that love the proficiencie of  arts and sciences and the advancement of learning. By Jo. Webster. In  moribus et institutis academiarum, collegiorum et similium conventium  quo ad doctorum hominum sedes et operas mutuas destinata sunt, omnia  progressui scientiarum in ulterius adversa inveniri. Franc. Bacon de  Verulamio lib. de cogitat. et vis. pag. mihi. 14. London: Printed for  Giles Calvert, and are to be sold at the sign of the Black  Spread-Eagle, at the west end of Paul's. 1654.\" 4to. In this tract,  which, like some other attacks upon the seats of learning, displays  more power in objection than in substitution, in pulling down than in  building up again, he shews the same fondness for the philosophers of  the Hermetic school, for Paracelsus, Dee, Fludd and Van Helmont, and  the same adhesion to planetary sigils, astrology, and the doctrine of  sympathies and primaeval signatures, which is perceptible in the  deliberate performance of his old age. Of himself he observes: \"I owe  little to the advantages of those things called the goods of fortune,  but most (next under the goodness of God) to industry: however, I am a  free born Englishman, a citizen of the world and a seeker of  knowledge, and am willing to teach what I know, and learn what I know  not.\" No one can read the _Academiarum Examen_ without feeling that it  is the production of a vigorous and powerful mind, which had \"tasted,\"  and that not scantily, of the \"sweet fruit of far fetched and dear  bought science.\" Yet it still remains a literary problem rather  difficult of solution, how a performance so clear, well digested, and  rational, could proceed, and that contemporaneously, from the same  author as the cloudy and fanatical \"Judgment Set and Books Opened.\" On  behalf of the Universities, answerers started up in the persons of  Ward and Wilkins, both afterwards bishops, and the part taken by the  first of them in the controversy was considered of sufficient  importance to form matter of commemoration in his monumental  inscription. Two opponents so famous, might almost seem to threaten  extinction to one, of whom it could only be said, that he had been an  obscure country schoolmaster, and whose acquirements, whatever they  were, were mainly the result of his own unassisted study. In the joint  answer, the title of which is \"Vindiciae Academiarum, containing some  briefe animadversions upon Mr. Webster's book entitled the  'Examination of Academies,' together with an appendix concerning what  Mr. Hobbes and Mr. Dell have published in this argument, Oxford,  1654,\" 4to., there is no want of bitterness nor of controversial  skill, but though, particularly in the limited arena of the prescribed  course of academical study, the knowledge displayed in it is more  exact, there is neither visible in it the same power of mind, nor the  same breadth of views, nor even the same variety of learning, as is  conspicuous in the original tract. This, with the two fanatical pieces  which Webster published contemporaneously with it, were entirely  unknown to his biographer, Dr. Whitaker, who has ceded him a place  amongst the distinguished natives and residents of the parish of  Whalley, in the full confidence \"that there is no puritanical taint in  his writings, and that his taste had evidently been formed upon better  models.[27]\" Had these early theological and literary delinquencies  of the physician of Clitheroe been communicated to his historian, it  may be questioned whether the portals of his provincial temple of fame  would have opened to receive so heinous a transgressor. But Dr.  Whitaker's deduction would have been perhaps perfectly warrantable,  had Webster left no remains but his _History of Metals_, and  _Displaying of Witchcraft_--so little do an author's latest works  afford a clue to the character of his earliest. From 1654 to 1671,  when he published his _History of Metals_, little is known of  Webster's course of life. He appears to have retired into the country  and devoted himself to medical practice and study, and to have taken  up his residence in or near Clitheroe. He complains, that in the year  1658 all his books and papers were taken from him, an abstraction  which, so far as his manuscripts are concerned, posterity is not  called upon to lament, if they all resembled his _Judgment Set and  Books Opened_. But his capacious and acute understanding was gradually  unfolding new resources, supplying the defects, and overcoming the  disadvantages of his imperfect education and desultory and irregular  studies, while his matured and enlightened judgment had abandoned and  discarded the fanatical pravities and erroneous tenets, which his  ardent enthusiasm had too hastily imbibed. When he again became a  candidate for the honours of authorship, it was evident that he knew  well how to apply those quarries of learning into which, during his  long recess, he had been digging so indefatigably, to furnish  materials for solid and durable structures, rising in honourable and  gratifying contrast to the fabrics which had preceded them. In 1671  came forth his \"Metallographia, or History of Metals,\"[28] in which  all that recondite learning and extensive observation could bring  together, on a subject which experiment had scarcely yet placed upon a  rational basis, is collected. He styles himself on the Title page,  \"Practitioner in Physic and Chirurgery.\" In 1677, he published his  great work. Its Title is \"The Displaying of supposed Witchcraft.  Wherein is affirmed that there are many sorts of Deceivers and  Impostors. And Divers persons under a passive Delusion of Melancholy  and Fancy. But that there is a Corporeal League made betwixt the Devil  and the Witch, Or that he sucks on the Witches Body, has Carnal  Copulation, or that Witches are turned into Cats, Dogs, raise  Tempests, or the like, is utterly denied and disproved. Wherein also  is handled, the Existence of Angels and Spirits, the truth of  Apparitions, the Nature of Astral and Sydereal Spirits, the force of  Charms and Philters; with other abstruse matters. By John Webster,  Practitioner in Physic. Falsae etenim opiniones Hominum praeoccupantes,  non solum surdos, sed et caecos faciunt, ita ut videre nequeant, quae  aliis perspicua apparent. Galen, lib. 8. de Comp. Med. London, Printed  by J.M. and are to be sold by the Booksellers in London. 1677,\" (fol.)  In this memorable book he exhausts the subject, as far as it is  possible to do so, by powerful ridicule, cogent arguments, and the  most various and well applied learning, leaving to Hutchinson, and  others who have since followed in his track, little further necessary  than to reproduce his facts and reasonings in a more popular, it can  scarcely be said, in a more effective, form.[29] Those who love  literary parallels may compare Webster, as he appears in this his  last and most characteristic performance, with two famous medical  contemporaries, Sir Thomas Browne, and Thomas Bartholinus the Dane,  whom he strongly resembled in the character of his mind, in the  complexion and variety of his studies, in grave simplicity, in  exactness of observation, in general philosophical incredulity with  some startling reserves, in elaborate and massive ratiocination, and  in the enthusiasm, subdued but not extinguished, which gives zest to  his speculations and poignancy and colouring to his style. He who  seeks to measure great men in their strength and in their weakness,  and what operation of literary analysis is more instructive or  delightful, will find ample employment for collation and comparison  in this extraordinary book, in which, keen as is the penetration  displayed on almost every subject of imposition and delusion, he  appears still to cling, with the obstinacy of a veteran, to some of  the darling Dalilahs of his youth, \"to the admirable and  soul-ravishing knowledge of the three great Hypostatical principles of  nature, salt, sulphur, and mercury,\" and, _proh pudor!_ to alchemy and  astrology--and those seraphic doctors and professors, Crollius,  Libavius, and Van Helmont. He closed his literary performances with  this noble fabric of logic and learning, not the less striking, and  scarcely less useful, because it is chequered by some of the mosaic  work of human imperfection,--a performance which may be said to have  grown up under the umbrage of Pendle, and which he might have  bequeathed to its future Demdikes and Chattox's as an amulet of  irresistible power.[30]    [Footnote 27: What would Dr. Whitaker have thought of the following  explosion, in which Webster sounds the tocsin with a vehemence and  vigour which no Macbriar or Kettledrumle of the period could have  surpassed. The extract is from his _Judgment Set and Books Opened_:--    \"All those that claim an Ordination by Man, or from Man, that speak  from the Spirit of the World, from Wit, Learning and Humane Reason,  who Preach for Hire, and make Merchandize of the Souls of Men; I  witness they are all Baal's Priests and Idol-Shepherds,"]]]
