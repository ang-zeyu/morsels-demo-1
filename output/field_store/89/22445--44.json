The children of the wealthier class were generally  educated abroad. The American institution of Robert College on the Bosporus  rendered an invaluable service to the newly created state by providing it  with a number of well-educated young men fitted for positions of  responsibility. In 1878, after the liberation of the country, there were  1658 schools in the towns and villages. Primary education was declared  obligatory from the first, but the scarcity of properly qualified teachers  and the lack of all requisites proved serious impediments to educational  organization. The government has made great efforts and incurred heavy  expenditure for the spread of education; the satisfactory results obtained  are largely due to the keen desire for learning which exists among the  people. The present educational system dates from 1891. Almost all the  villages now possess \"national\" (_narodni_) primary schools, maintained by  the communes with the aid of a state subvention and supervised by  departmental and district inspectors. The state also assists a large number  of Turkish primary schools. The penalties for non-attendance are not very  rigidly enforced, and it has been found necessary to close the schools in  the rural districts during the summer, the children being required for  labour in the fields.    The age for primary instruction is six to ten years; in 1890, 47.01% of the  boys and 16.11% of the girls attended the primary schools; in 1898, 85% of  the boys and 40% of the girls. In 1904 there were 4344 primary schools, of  which 3060 were \"national,\" or communal, and 1284 denominational (Turkish,  Greek, Jewish, &c.), attended by 340,668 pupils, representing a proportion  of 9.1 per hundred inhabitants. In addition to the primary schools, 40  infant schools for children of 3 to 6 years of age were attended by 2707  pupils. In 1888 only 327,766 persons, or 11% of the population, were  literate; in 1893 the proportion rose to 19.88%; in 1901 to 23.9%.    In the system of secondary education the distinction between the classical  and \"real\" or special course of study is maintained as in most European  countries; in 1904 there were 175 secondary schools and 18 gymnasia (10 for  boys and 8 for girls). In addition to these there are 6 technical and 3  agricultural schools; 5 of pedagogy, 1 theological, 1 commercial, 1 of  forestry, 1 of design, 1 for surgeons' assistants, and a large military  school at Sofia. Government aid is given to students of limited means, both  for secondary education and the completion of their studies abroad. The  university of Sofia, formerly known as the \"high school,\" was reorganized  in 1904; it comprises 3 faculties (philology, mathematics and law), and  possesses a staff of 17 professors and 25 lecturers. The number of students  in 1905 was 943.    POLITICAL HISTORY    The ancient Thraco-Illyrian race which inhabited the district between the  Danube and the Aegean was expelled, or more probably absorbed, by the great  Slavonic immigration which took place at various intervals between the end  of the 3rd century after Christ and the beginning of the 6th. The numerous  tumuli which are found in all parts of the country (see Herodotus v. 8) and  some stone tablets with bas-reliefs remain as monuments of the aboriginal  population; and certain structural peculiarities, which are common to the  Bulgarian and Rumanian languages, may conceivably be traced to the  influence of the primitive Illyrian speech, now probably represented by the  Albanian. The Slavs, an agricultural people, were governed, even in those  remote times, by the democratic local institutions to which they are still  attached; they possessed no national leaders or central organization, and  their only political unit was the _pleme_, or tribe. They were considerably  influenced by contact with Roman civilization. It was reserved for a  foreign race, altogether distinct in origin, religion and customs, to give  unity and coherence to the scattered Slavonic groups, and to weld them into  a compact and powerful state which for some centuries played an important  part in the history of eastern Europe and threatened the existence of the  Byzantine empire.    _The Bulgars._--The Bulgars, a Turanian race akin to the Tatars, Huns,  Avars, Petchenegs and Finns, made their appearance on the banks of the  Pruth in the latter part of the 7th century. They were a horde of wild  horsemen, fierce and barbarous, practising polygamy, and governed  despotically by their _khans_ (chiefs) and _boyars_ or _bolyars_ (nobles).  Their original abode was the tract between the Ural mountains and the  Volga, where the kingdom of Great (or Black) Bolgary existed down to the  13th century. In 679, under their khan Asparukh (or Isperikh), they crossed  the Danube, and, after subjugating the Slavonic population of Moesia,  advanced to the gates of Constantinople and Salonica. The East Roman  emperors were compelled to cede to them the province of Moesia and to pay  them an annual tribute. The invading horde was not numerous, and during the  next two centuries it became gradually merged in the Slavonic population.  Like the Franks in Gaul the Bulgars gave their name and a political  organization to the more civilized race which they conquered, but adopted  its language, customs and local institutions. Not a trace of the Ugrian or  Finnish element is to be found in the Bulgarian speech. This complete  assimilation of a conquering race may be illustrated by many parallels.    _Early Dynasties._--The history of the early Bulgarian dynasties is little  else than a record of continuous conflicts with the Byzantine emperors. The  tribute first imposed on the Greeks by Asparukh was again exacted by Kardam  (791-797) and Krum (802-815), a sovereign noted alike for his cruelty and  his military and political capacity. Under his rule the Bulgarian realm  extended from the Carpathians to the neighbourhood of Adrianople; Serdica  (the present Sofia) was taken, and the valley of the Struma conquered.  Preslav, the Bulgarian capital, was attacked and burned by the emperor  Nicephorus, but the Greek army on its return was annihilated in one of the  Balkan passes; the emperor was slain, and his skull was converted by Krum  into a goblet. The reign of Boris (852-884) is memorable [v.04 p.0780] for  the introduction of Christianity into Bulgaria. Two monks of Salonica, SS.  Cyril and Methodius, are generally reverenced as the national apostles; the  scene of their labours, however, was among the Slavs of Moravia, and the  Bulgars were evangelized by their disciples. Boris, finding himself  surrounded by Christian states, decided from political motives to abandon  paganism. He was baptized in 864, the emperor Michael III. acting as his  sponsor. It was at this time that the controversies broke out which ended  in the schism between the Churches of the East and West. Boris long wavered  between Constantinople and Rome, but the refusal of the pope to recognize  an autocephalous Bulgarian church determined him to offer his allegiance to  the Greek patriarch. The decision was fraught with momentous consequences  for the future of the race. The nation altered its religion in obedience to  its sovereign, and some of the boyars who resisted the change paid with  their lives for their fidelity to the ancient belief. The independence of  the Bulgarian church was recognized by the patriarchate, a fact much dwelt  upon in recent controversies. The Bulgarian primates subsequently received  the title of patriarch; their see was transferred from Preslav to Sofia,  Voden and Prespa successively, and finally to Ochrida.    _The First Empire._--The national power reached its zenith under Simeon  (893-927), a monarch distinguished in the arts of war and peace. In his  reign, says Gibbon, \"Bulgaria assumed a rank among the civilized powers of  the earth.\" His dominions extended from the Black Sea to the Adriatic, and  from the borders of Thessaly to the Save and the Carpathians. Having become  the most powerful monarch in eastern Europe, Simeon assumed the style of  \"Emperor and Autocrat of all the Bulgars and Greeks\" (_tsar i samodrzhetz  vsem Blgarom i Grkom_), a title which was recognized by Pope Formosus.  During the latter years of his reign, which were spent in peace, his people  made great progress in civilization, literature nourished, and Preslav,  according to contemporary chroniclers, rivalled Constantinople in  magnificence. After the death of Simeon the Bulgarian power declined owing  to internal dissensions; the land was distracted by the Bogomil heresy (see  BOGOMILS), and a separate or western empire, including Albania and  Macedonia, was founded at Ochrida by Shishman, a boyar from Trnovo. A  notable event took place in 967, when the Russians, under Sviatoslav, made  their first appearance in Bulgaria. The Bulgarian tsar, Boris II., with the  aid of the emperor John Zimisces, expelled the invaders, but the Greeks  took advantage of their victory to dethrone Boris, and the first Bulgarian  empire thus came to an end after an existence of three centuries. The  empire at Ochrida, however, rose to considerable importance under Samuel,  the son of Shishman (976-1014), who conquered the greater part of the  Peninsula, and ruled from the Danube to the Morea. After a series of  campaigns this redoubtable warrior was defeated at Belasitza by the emperor  Basil II., surnamed Bulgaroktonos, who put out the eyes of 15,000 prisoners  taken in the fight, and sent them into the camp of his adversary. The  Bulgarian tsar was so overpowered by the spectacle that he died of grief. A  few years later his dynasty finally disappeared, and for more than a  century and a half (1018-1186) the Bulgarian race remained subject to the  Byzantine emperors.    _The Second Empire._--In 1186, after a general insurrection of Vlachs and  Bulgars under the brothers Ivan and Peter Asen of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19850"],[0,"The Human Side of Animals (#7)"],[1,"animal children grow up, and stop playing to a certain extent as age  advances, precisely as human children do. Each settles down into a more  practical condition of life. They dislike to have their games and play  disturbed, and if the mother dog growls because her playful son has  continuously tumbled over her while she was sleeping, or the cat-mother  slaps her kitten because he plays with her tail--it is a display of the  same kind of emotion that prompts a human mother to rebuke her child in  the nursery for making too much noise, or for throwing toys out of the  window. Animals, like ourselves, feel every sensation of joy, happiness,  surprise, disappointment, love, hope, ambition, and through their  youthful games an entire index of their future lives may be obtained.    This play has much to do with the physical and mental development of the  animals; and it is strange indeed that so few writers have considered  the subject of play in the animal world. Most of those who have noticed  the subject at all, drop it with a few remarks, to the effect that it is  \"highly amusing,\" or \"very funny,\" or \"unbelievable,\" or \"so like the  play of children,\" without even a word of explanation of the whys and  wherefores of it.    All animals have some kinds of play. Plutarch speaks of a trained  elephant that often practised her steps when she thought no one was  looking. No one who has ever visited a zoological park and seen the  crowded monkey and baboon cages can have failed to note the wonderful  play of these animals. Seals seem never to tire of chasing one another  through the water; while even the clumsy hippopotamuses have diving  games.    Kittens begin to tumble and play before they are two weeks old. They  will roll and toss a ball, hunting it from the dark corners, lay in  silent wait for each other, and suddenly spring upon an unsuspecting  fellow-cat-baby's back, just as they will do later in life, when seeking  their prey. I have seen them play with a catnip mouse for hours at a  time, just as the mother cat plays with a real mouse.    Brehm says that this is noticed in their earliest kittenhood, and that  the mother cat encourages it in all ways possible, even to becoming a  child with her children from love of them, as a human mother does in the  nursery with her child. The mother cat begins the play by slowly moving  her tail. Gesner considered her tail as the indicator of her moods. The  kittens, while they may not understand what this means, are greatly  excited by the movement, their eyes sparkle, their ears stand erect, and  slowly one after another clutches after the moving tail. Suddenly,  one springs over the mother's back, another grabs at her feet, while a  third playfully slaps her in the face with his tiny, soft, cushioned  paw. She, patiently and mother-like, lovingly submits to all this  treatment, as it is only play.    [Illustration: _American Museum of Natural History, New York_    DRYPTOSAURUS. THE PREHISTORIC ANIMALS, TOO, UNDOUBTEDLY HAD THEIR PLAY  TIME, WITH GAMES AND \"SETTING UP\" EXERCISES.]    [Illustration: _American Museum of Natural History, New York_    A HAPPY FAMILY OF POLAR BEARS. THE YOUNG CUBS WRESTLE AND TUMBLE, AS  PLAYFULLY AS TWO PUPPIES. THIS PLAY HAS MUCH TO DO WITH THEIR PHYSICAL  AND MENTAL DEVELOPMENT.]    Many scientists have claimed that this so-called instinct should not be  classed as real play. However, such an authority as Darwin thought it  was play, and Scheitlin said that the cat let the mouse loose many times  in order that she might have the experience of catching it each time. No  mercy is shown the helpless mouse, which is the same to her as the toy  ball--in the same way as a real beetle and a toy beetle are the same to  a small child. Evidently the cat does not play with the mouse for the  delight in torturing it, but purely for practice that she may become  skilled in the art of catching it. The cat also exercises in springing  movements, and by studying the mouse's probable movements, learns to  acquire a knowledge and skill in mouse-ways otherwise impossible.    The same cruel practice is found among leopards, panthers, and wild  cats. Brehm verifies the observation that many members of the cat family  practise torturing their victims in a horrible manner, pretending to  liberate them, until the poor creatures at last die from their wounds.  Lenz tells of a marten that would play with its prey for hours when not  hungry. Especially was this true when marmots chanced to be his victims,  and around these he would leap and spring, dealing them terrific blows  first with one paw and then with the other. When hungry, however, he  proceeded differently, devouring them at once from teeth to tail.    All the cat family, it seems, are fond of human companionship, and take  almost as much delight in playing with human beings as with their own  kind. This is especially true of the puma. Brehm tells of a tame one  that delighted in hiding at the approach of his master and springing out  unexpectedly, just as the lion does. Hudson claimed that the puma, with  the exception of the monkey, was possibly the most playful of all  animals. Travellers tell many interesting tales of the play of these  animals, especially on the Pampas of South America.    Gross relates the experience of an Englishman who was compelled to spend  the night outdoors on the Pampas of the La Plata. At about nine o'clock,  on a bright moonlight night, he saw four pumas coming toward him, two  adult animals and two young ones. He well knew that these animals would  not attack him, so he quietly waited. In a short time they approached  him, chasing one another and playing hide-and-seek like little kittens;  and finally leaped directly over the man several times. The mother cat  would run ahead, calling to the little ones to follow her. But she never  disturbed him.    At times an animal at play with another uses the same tactics and  methods employed on its prey. Of course, the value of such practice for  the tasks of later-life is evident. Dogs play hide-and-seek, tag, and  various chasing games for hours without resting. Among the negroes of  the South it is not uncommon to see a hound playing hide-and-seek with  the little pickaninnies. I have seen a hound peeping in and out among a  pile of brush to discover where the little ones were hiding, and at the  first sight of a little black face, he would lay low in anticipation of  a playful spring, or a sudden dash-away, with the expectation of being  chased by his friends. At times he would suddenly disappear toward his  home, and slyly slip around and approach the playground from an opposite  direction.    Every one who has owned fox terriers knows how they will crouch in the  open grass and remain motionless, with quivering expectation for the  other playfellow to arrive, and when the one in ambush sees the other  coming he springs toward him, as though he were going to destroy him!  And when the two come together, they attempt to seize each other by the  necks, as they would do in a real conflict. A wrestle and tussle ensues  and when utterly exhausted from this play, the tired dogs, like two  fatigued children, run to their homes.    Dogs are fond of playing ball, and will readily bring a ball or stick to  their master when he has thrown it. They will also go into the water to  bring out sticks that may have been tossed in for amusement. Eugene  Zimmerman had a young fox terrier that would set a ball in motion, when  there was no one to pitch it for him, by seizing it in his mouth and  tossing it up in the air. Monkeys and jaguars will also play ball, and  tame bears take great delight in wrestling, playing ball, and fighting  mock battles.    [Illustration: _American Museum of Natural History, New York_    THE MOTHER OPOSSUM IS NEVER HAPPIER THAN WHEN SHE HAS HER LITTLE ONES  PLAYING HIDE-AND-SEEK OVER HER BACK.]    [Illustration: THIS YOUNG FOX CAME FROM HIS HOME IN THE WOODS DAILY TO  PLAY WITH A YOUNG FOX-TERRIER. HE IS NOW RESTING AFTER A ROMP.]    Beckmann wonderfully describes the play of a badger, whose only playmate  was an exceptionally clever dog, who from his earliest youth had been  taught to live with different kinds of animals. \"Together they went  through a series of gymnastic exercises on pleasant afternoons, and  their four-footed friends came from far and near to witness the  performance. The essentials of the game were that the badger, roaring  and shaking his head like a wild boar, should charge upon the dog, as  it stood about fifteen paces off, and strike him in the side with its  head; the dog, leaping dexterously entirely over the badger, awaited a  second and third attack, and then made his antagonist chase him all  round the garden. If the badger managed to snap the dog's hindquarters,  an angry tussle ensued, but never resulted in a real fight. If Caspar,  the badger, lost his temper, he drew off without turning round, and got  up snorting and shaking and with bristling hair, and strutted about like  an inflated turkey-cock. After a few moments his hair would smooth down,  and with some head-shaking and good-natured grunts the mad play would  begin again.\"    Young animals are strikingly like children in their craving for  amusement. A young bear will lie on his back and play with his feet and  toes by the hour, while a young pup can have a great game with only a  dry bone, or by chasing his shadow on the wall. Rabbits come out in  evenings on the sand-hills to play hide-and-seek with their young, and  squirrels never weary of this universally popular game. I know of a  young fox that used to come from a nearby woods every evening to play  with a young fox-terrier. They became great friends and were often seen  in the woods together.    A friend who owns a ranch in Texas once raised two young wolves that  romped and played with the neighbour's dogs just as if they were dogs  themselves. There are"]]]
