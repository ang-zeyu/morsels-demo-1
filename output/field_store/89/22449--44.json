At the commencement of the Jewish Sabbath, half an hour before sunset  on Friday, every Jew was bound to have his lamp lighted, though he  should beg the oil. The women were required to light the lamps in  memory of Eve, who by her disobedience extinguished the light of the  world. Every Hebrew was obliged to pare his nails on Friday, beginning  with the little finger of the left hand, and then going to the middle  finger, after which he returned to the fourth finger, and then to the  thumb and fore finger. In cutting the nails of the fingers of the  right hand, he began with the middle finger, then proceeded to the  thumb, and after that took the fore finger, the middle and fourth  fingers, in the order stated. The parings were either buried or  burned. The Hebrews believed that the sounding of a consecrated horn  drove away the devil.    A curious custom prevailed among them in early times. The father of a  family took a white cock, and each of his wives selected a hen, but  such of them as were expectant mothers took both a cock and a hen.  With these fowls they struck their heads twice, and at every blow the  head of the family said, \"Let this cock stand in my room; he shall  die, but I shall live.\" Having said this, the neck of the fowl was  drawn and its throat cut; and either the dead fowl, or its value in  money, was given to the poor. In the evening previous to the feast of  expiation, a man wishing to pry into futurity carried a lighted candle  to the synagogue, and from particular appearances of the flame he  prognosticated whether good was to follow him and his, or whether he  and his family were to be overtaken by evil.    At their great feasts of tents or tabernacles (observed in memory of  their living in tents in the wilderness) the Israelites went from  their tents to the synagogue every day during the feast, bearing in  their right hands branches of palms, myrtle, and willows, and in their  left hands branches of citron. When they reached the synagogue, they  turned the branches first to the east, then to the south, next to the  west, and lastly to the north. These ceremonies were allegorical: the  palm was an emblem of hypocrisy, the myrtle pointed to good works, the  willow represented the wicked, and the citron the righteous. At  marriages, while the young persons present held torches in their hands  and sang the marriage song, the bride walked three times round the  bridegroom, and he in turn walked thrice round her. In some  countries--Germany and Holland, for instance--the guests threw  handfuls of corn at the young wedded pair, telling them to \"increase  and multiply.\" The newly married people drank a little wine, and then  emptied the cup on the floor. At the wedding repast a roasted hen and  an egg were presented to the bride, who, after partaking of them,  distributed the remainder to the guests. The hen had reference to the  fruitfulness of the bride, and her delivery in childbirth.    The thumbs of a dead Jew were tied down close to the palms of his  hands, to preserve the deceased from the devil's clutches. While the  body was being washed, an egg was put into a glass of wine, and the  deceased's head anointed with the mixture. Those who were not  reconciled to the departed, before his death, kissed his great toe and  asked pardon, lest he should accuse them at the great tribunal before  the Most High. When the body was carried away for interment, a person,  who remained behind, threw a brick after it, as a sign that all sorrow  was past. The nearest friends or relations walked seven times round  the grave, after each of them had driven a nail into the coffin. Hence  the saying in our own time, when one signifies his willingness to do a  friend a favour or kindness, \"I will drive a nail into your coffin.\"  When the body was put into the grave, every person present threw a  handful of earth in after it.    On important occasions the Hebrews, like Pagans, consulted diviners,  who had recourse to various ways of divination. In the days of Joseph  there was divination by cups, one particular manner of proceeding  being to observe how their wine sparkled when poured out. Casting or  drawing of lots was a favourite method of divination, not only among  the Jews, but among all nations. Mention is made of divination by  means of household gods or images in human shape, prepared by  astrologers under particular constellations, and made capable of the  heavenly influences. The rabbis, in making some of these images,  killed a man who was a first-born son, wrung off his head, seasoned it  with salt, spices, etc., and then put a gold plate, bearing the name  of an unclean spirit, under the head, which was fixed to a wall, and  had candles burning beside it. The images were consulted as oracles  concerning things accomplished but unknown, and regarding events in  the future.    Among the Jews there were observers of times who laid great stress on  certain seasons and critical moments, which they supposed depended on  particular positions of the heavenly bodies. A learned rabbi expressed  the opinion that the celestial bodies rewarded persons who put  confidence in them, and that consequently men acted wisely to  reverence the stars and implore their assistance. Guesses at  futurities were made from the falling of a crumb of bread out of one's  mouth or a staff from a man's hand, from a person sneezing, or the  breaking of a shoe-latchet.    The Hebrew witches were supposed to possess the power of doing  mischief to man and beast by their occult science, and of changing the  form of things. Witches used their wicked skill to allure maidens.  Through magical operations, a Jew endeavoured long ago to procure the  love of a Christian woman, but she was preserved from the power of his  craft by sealing herself with the sign of the cross. It was an ancient  way of enchantment, to bring, by the power of magic, various kinds of  beasts together into one place, which were designated as the \"great  congregation\" and the \"little congregation.\" The great congregation  consisted of many of the larger animals, and the lesser was made up of  numerous smaller creatures, such as serpents, scorpions, and the like.  Wizards were famous fortune tellers; they pretended to be the  interpreters of all the most important occurrences of the world.  According to the Hebrew laws, the deceivers, and those who consulted  them, were liable to be stoned. Necromancers obtained a footing among  the Jews. Such wicked people were accustomed to fast, go to  burying-places, and there lie down, fall asleep, and pretend that the  dead appeared to them in dreams or otherwise, and told them what was  desired. They also pretended to call up the dead by means of certain  fumes and particular words. In cases where the spirits of dead men  were obstinate and refused to appear or answer when summoned in the  more simple form, recourse was had to the burning of portions of black  cats, or the still more cruel method of cutting up young boys and  virgins.

Every person who has read the Old Testament, knows that the Hebrews  had among them extraordinary men really endowed with prophetic  spirits. The Jews were forbidden to consult the oracles of the heathen  nations round about them, but they were permitted to consult their own  true prophets concerning that which was concealed from ordinary  persons. There was a constant succession of prophets, and there were  schools where young persons aspiring to the office of a seer were  instructed. Over each of these institutions a venerable prophet  presided. At first the scholars were not inspired, but received  prophecies from the mouth of their master or president. At Jerusalem  there was one of these schools within the second wall of the city. So  great respect was paid to the prophetic character, that none were  suffered to be buried in Jerusalem but kings, descendants of David,  and prophets. Though old prophets could not inspire their young  students, they improved their natural faculties, and taught them how  to subdue irregular emotions that hindered inspiration. That the minds  of the prophets might be the better disposed to receive the proper  impulses, instrumental music was used in their devotions; and it is  reported that at certain of their musical meetings the young men  became so elated, that they manifested poetical genius as well as a  prophetic spirit. When a young prophet gave unequivocal evidence of  being inspired, he was installed into office by having the prophetic  mantle (made of lamb's skin) thrown over his shoulders. Subsequent to  inauguration, a prophet wore hair-cloth next his skin, and had a  leather girdle round his loins.    The general way through which revelations were made to them was in  dreams and visions, or by immediate inspiration. "]]]
