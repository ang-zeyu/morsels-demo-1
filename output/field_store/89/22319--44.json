A man cannot dispense with  sleep, and it is cruel to rob a friend of what is almost his life and  health. But, if any one of your party requires more sleep than the  others, he ought to contrive to \"turn in\" earlier, and so rise with the  company.    You have already been advised to take all the rest you can at the halts.  Unsling the knapsack, or take off your pack (unless you lie down upon  it), and make yourself as comfortable as you can. Avoid sitting in a  draught of air, or wherever it chills you.    If you feel on the second morning as if you could never reach your  journey's end, start off easily, and you will limber up after a while.    The great trouble with young people is, that they are ashamed to own  their fatigue, and will not do any thing that looks like a confession.  But these rules about resting, and \"taking it easy,\" are the same in  principle as those by which a horse is driven on a long journey; and it  seems reasonable that young men should be favored as much as horses.    Try to be civil and gentlemanly to every one. You will find many who  wish to make money out of you, especially around the summer hotels and  boarding-houses. Avoid them if you can. Make your prices, where  possible, before you engage.    Do not be saucy to the farmers, nor treat them as \"country greenhorns.\"  There is not a class of people in the country of more importance to you  in your travels; and you are in honor bound to be respectful to them.  Avoid stealing their apples, or disturbing any thing; and when you wish  to camp near a house, or on cultivated land, obtain permission from the  owner, and do not make any unreasonable request, such as asking to camp  in a man's front-yard, or to make a fire in dry grass or within a  hundred yards of his buildings. Do not ask him to wait on you without  offering to pay him. Most farmers object to having people sleep on their  hay-mows; and all who permit it will insist upon the rule, \"No smoking  allowed here.\" When you break camp in the morning, be sure to put out  the fires wherever you are; and, if you have camped on cleared land, see  that the fences and gates are as you found them, and do not leave a mass  of rubbish behind for the farmer to clear up.      MOUNTAIN CLIMBING.    When you climb a mountain, make up your mind for hard work, unless there  is a carriage-road, or the mountain is low and of gentle ascent. If  possible, make your plans so that you will not have to carry much up and  down the steep parts. It is best to camp at the foot of the mountain, or  a part way up, and, leaving the most of your baggage there, to take an  early start next morning so as to go up and down the same day. This is  not a necessity, however; but if you camp on the mountain-top you run  more risk from cold, fog, (clouds), and showers, and you need a warmer  camp and more clothing than down below.    Often there is no water near the top: therefore, to be on the safe side,  it is best to carry a canteen. After wet weather, and early in the  summer, you can often squeeze a little water from the moss that grows on  mountain-tops.    It is so apt to be chilly, cloudy, or showery at the summit, that you  should take a rubber blanket and some other article of clothing to put  on if needed. Although a man may sometimes ascend a mountain, and stay  on the top for hours, in his shirt-sleeves, it is never advisable to go  so thinly clad; oftener there is need of an overcoat, while the air in  the valley is uncomfortably warm.    Do not wear the extra clothing in ascending, but keep it to put on when  you need it. This rule is general for all extra clothing: you will find  it much better to carry than to wear it.    Remember that mountain-climbing is excessively fatiguing: hence go  slowly, make short rests _very_ often, eat nothing between meals, and  drink sparingly.    There are few mountains that it is advisable for ladies to try to climb.  Where there is a road, or the way is open and not too steep, they may  attempt it; but to climb over loose rocks and through scrub-spruce for  miles, is too difficult for them.    FOOTNOTES:    [7] Some of the questions which properly belong under this heading are  discussed elsewhere, and can be found by referring to the index.    [8] This advice also differs from that generally given to soldiers; the  army rule is as follows: \"Drink well in the morning before starting, and  nothing till the halt; keep the mouth shut; chew a straw or leaf, or  keep the mouth covered with a cloth: all these prevent suffering from  extreme thirst. Tying a handkerchief well wetted with salt water around  the neck, allays thirst for a considerable time.\"--CRAGHILL'S _Pocket  Companion_: Van Nostrand, N.Y.          CHAPTER VIII.    THE CAMP.      It pays well to take some time to find a good spot for a camp. If you  are only to stop one night, it matters not so much; but even then you  should camp on a dry spot near wood and water, and where your horse, if  you have one, can be well cared for. Look out for rotten trees that may  fall; see that a sudden rain will not drown you out; and do not put your  tent near the road, as it frightens horses.    For a permanent camp a good prospect is very desirable; yet I would not  sacrifice all other things to this.    If you have to carry your baggage any distance by hand, you will find it  convenient to use two poles (tent-poles will serve) as a hand-barrow  upon which to pile and carry your stuff.    A floor to the tent is a luxury in which some indulge when in permanent  camp. It is not a necessity, of course; but, in a tent occupied by  ladies or children, it adds much to their comfort to have a few boards,  an old door, or something of that sort, to step on when dressing. Boards  or stepping-stones at the door of the tent partly prevent your bringing  mud inside.    If you are on a hillside, pitch your tent so that when you sleep, if you  are to sleep on the ground, your feet will be lower than your head: you  will roll all night, and perhaps roll out of the tent if you lie across  the line running down hill.    As soon as you have pitched your tent, stretch a stout line from the  front pole to the back one, near the top, upon which to hang your  clothes. You can tighten this line by pulling inwards the foot of one  pole before tying the line, and then lifting it back.    Do not put your clothes and bedding upon the bare ground: they grow damp  very quickly. See, too, that the food is where ants will not get at it.    Do not forget to take two or three candles, and replenish your stock if  you burn them: they sometimes are a prime necessity. Also do not pack  them where you cannot easily find them in the dark. In a permanent camp  you may be tempted to use a lantern with oil, and perhaps you will like  it better than candles; but, when moving about, the lantern-lamp and  oil-can will give you trouble. If you have no candlestick handy, you can  use your pocket-knife, putting one blade in the bottom or side of the  candle, and another blade into the ground or tent-pole. You can quickly  cut a candlestick out of a potato, or can drive four nails in a block of  wood.    If your candles get crushed, or if you have no candles, but have grease  without salt in it, you can easily make a \"slut\" by putting the grease  in a small shallow pan or saucer with a piece of wicking or cotton rag,  one end of which shall be in the grease, and the other, which you light,  held out of it. This is a poor substitute for daylight, and I advise you  to rise and retire early (or \"_turn in_\" and \"_turn out_\" if you  prefer): you will then have more daylight than you need.      BEDS.    Time used in making a bed is well spent. Never let yourself be persuaded  that humps and hollows are good enough for a tired man. If you cut  boughs, do not let large sticks go into the bed: only put in the smaller  twigs and leaves. Try your bed before you \"turn in,\" and see if it is  comfortable. In a permanent camp you ought to take time enough to keep  the bed soft; and I like best for this purpose to carry a mattress when  I can, or to take a sack and fill it with straw, shavings, boughs, or  what not. This makes a much better bed, and can be taken out daily to  the air and sun. By this I avoid the clutter there always is inside a  tent filled with boughs; and, more than all, the ground or floor does  not mould in damp weather, from the accumulation of rubbish on it.    It is better to sleep off the ground if you can, especially if you are  rheumatic. For this purpose build some sort of a platform ten inches or  more high, that will do for a seat in daytime. You can make a sort of  spring bottom affair if you can find the poles for it, and have a little  ingenuity and patience; or you can more quickly drive four large stakes,  and nail a framework to them, to which you can nail boards or  barrel-staves.[9] All this kind of work must be strong, or you can have  no rough-and-tumble sport on it. We used to see in the army sometimes, a  mattress with a bottom of rubber cloth, and a top of heavy drilling,  with rather more cotton quilted[10] between them than is put into a  thick comforter. Such a mattress is a fine thing to carry in a wagon  when you are on the march; but you can make a softer bed than this if  you are in a permanent camp.      SLEEPING.    \"Turn in\" early, so as to be up with the sun. You may be tempted to  sleep in your clothes; but if you wish to know what luxury is, take them  off as you do at home, and sleep in a sheet, having first taken a bath,  or at least washed the feet and limbs. Not many care to do this,  particularly if the evening air is chilly; but it is a comfort of no  mean order.    If you are short of bedclothes, as when on the march, you can place over  you the clothes you take off (see p. 19); but in that case it is still  more"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17579"],[0,"The History of Napoleon Buonaparte (#7)"],[1,"of every kind,[8] in clothing and even in food; and  watched by an enemy greatly more numerous. It was under such  circumstances that he at once avowed the daring scheme of forcing a  passage to Italy, and converting the richest territory of the enemy  himself into the theatre of the war. \"Soldiers,\" said he, \"you are  hungry and naked; the Republic owes you much, but she has not the means  to pay her debts. I am come to lead you into the most fertile plains  that the sun beholds. Rich provinces, opulent towns, all shall be at  your disposal. Soldiers! with such a prospect before you, can you fail  in courage and constancy?\" This was his first address to his army. The  sinking hearts of the men beat high with hope and confidence when they  heard the voice of the young and fearless leader; and Augereau, Massena,  Serrurier, Joubert, Lannes--distinguished officers might themselves  have aspired to the chief command--felt, from the moment they began to  understand his character and system, that the true road to glory would  be to follow the star of Napoleon.    He perceived that the time was come for turning a new leaf in the  history of war. With such numbers of troops as the infant Republic could  afford him, he saw that no considerable advantages could be obtained  against the vast and highly-disciplined armies of Austria and her  allies, unless the established rules and etiquettes of strategy were  abandoned. It was only by such rapidity of motion as should utterly  transcend the suspicion of his adversaries, that he could hope to  concentrate the whole pith and energy of a small force upon some one  point of a much greater force opposed to it, and thus _rob_ them  (according to his own favourite phrase) of the victory. To effect such  rapid marches, it was necessary that the soldiery should make up their  minds to consider tents and baggage as idle luxuries; and that, instead  of a long and complicated chain of reserves and stores, they should dare  to rely wholly for the means of subsistence on the resources of the  countries into which their leader might conduct them. They must be  contented to conquer at whatever hazard; to consider no sacrifices or  hardships as worthy of a thought. The risk of destroying the character  and discipline of the men, by accustoming them to pillage, was obvious.  Buonaparte trusted to victory, the high natural spirit of the nation,  and the influence of his own genius, for the means of avoiding this  danger; and many years, it must be admitted, elapsed, before he found  much reason personally to repent of the system which he adopted. Against  the enemies of the Republic its success was splendid, even beyond his  hopes.    The objects of the approaching expedition were three: first, to compel  the King of Sardinia, who had already lost Savoy and Nice, but still  maintained a powerful army on the frontiers of Piedmont, to abandon the  alliance of Austria: secondly, to compel the Emperor, by a bold invasion  of Lombardy, to make such exertions in that quarter as might weaken  those armies which had so long hovered on the Rhine; and, if possible,  to stir up the Italian subjects of that crown to adopt the revolutionary  system and emancipate themselves for ever from its yoke. The third  object, though more distant, was not less important. The influence of  the Romish Church was considered by the Directory as the chief, though  secret, support of the cause of royalism within their own territory; and  to reduce the Vatican into insignificance, or at least force it to  submission and quiescence, appeared indispensable to the internal  tranquillity of France. The Revolutionary Government, besides this  general cause of hatred and suspicion, had a distinct injury to avenge.  Their agent, Basseville, had three years before been assassinated in a  popular tumult at Rome: the Papal troops had not interfered to protect  him, nor the Pope to punish his murderers; and the haughty Republic  considered this as an insult which could only be washed out with a sea  of blood.    Napoleon's plan for gaining access to the fair regions of Italy differed  from that of all former conquerors: they had uniformly penetrated the  Alps at some point or other of that mighty range of mountains: he judged  that the same end might be accomplished more easily by advancing along  the narrow strip of comparatively level country which intervenes between  those enormous barriers and the Mediterranean Sea, and forcing a passage  at the point where the last of the Alps melt, as it were, into the first  and lowest of the Apennine range. No sooner did he begin to concentrate  his troops towards this region, than the Austrian general, Beaulieu,  took measures for protecting Genoa, and the entrance of Italy. He  himself took post with one column of his army at Voltri, a town within  ten miles of Genoa: he placed D'Argenteau with another Austrian column  at Monte Notte, a strong height further to the westward; and the  Sardinians, under Colli, occupied Ceva--which thus formed the extreme  right of the whole line of the allied army. The French could not advance  towards Genoa but by confronting some one of the three armies thus  strongly posted, and sufficiently, as Beaulieu supposed, in  communication with each other.    It was now that Buonaparte made his first effort to baffle the science  of those who fancied there was nothing new to be done in warfare. On the  10th of April, D'Argenteau came down upon Monte Notte, and attacked some  French redoubts, in front of that mountain and the villages which bear  its name, at Montelegino. At the same time General Cervoni and the  French van were attacked by Beaulieu near Voltri, and compelled to  retreat. The determined valour of Colonel Rampon, who commanded at  Montelegino, held D'Argenteau at bay during the 10th and 11th: and  Buonaparte, contenting himself with watching Beaulieu, determined to  strike his effectual blow at the centre of the enemy's line. During the  night of the 11th various columns were marched upon Montelegino, that of  Cervoni and that of Laharpe from the van of the French line, those of  Augereau and Massena from its rear. On the morning of the 12th,  D'Argenteau, preparing to renew his attack on the redoubts of  Montelegino, found he had no longer Rampon only and his brave band to  deal with; that French columns were in his rear, on his flank, and drawn  up also behind the works at Montelegino; in a word, that he was  surrounded. He was compelled to retreat among the mountains; he left his  colours and cannon behind him, 1000 killed, and 2000 prisoners. The  centre of the allied army had been utterly routed, before either the  Commander-in-Chief at the left, or General Colli at the right of the  line, had any notion that a battle was going on.    Such was the battle of Monte Notte, the first of Napoleon's fields.  Beaulieu, in order that he might re-establish his communication with  Colli (much endangered by the defeat of D'Argenteau) was obliged to  retreat upon Dego; the Sardinian, with the same purpose in view, fell  back also, and took post at Millesimo; while D'Argenteau was striving to  re-organise his dispirited troops in the difficult country between. It  was their object to keep fast in these positions until succours could  come up from Lombardy; but Napoleon had no mind to give them such  respite.    The very next day after this victory he commanded a general assault on  the Austrian line. Augereau, with a fresh division, marched at the left  upon Millesimo; Massena led the centre towards Dego; and Laharpe, with  the French right wing, manoeuvred to turn the left flank of Beaulieu.    Augereau rushed upon the outposts of Millesimo, seized and retained the  gorge which defends that place, and cut off Provera with two thousand  Austrians, who occupied an eminence called Cossaria, from the main body  of Colli's army. Next morning Buonaparte himself arrived at that scene  of the operations. He forced Colli to accept battle, utterly broke and  scattered him, and Provera, thus abandoned, was obliged to yield at  discretion.    Meanwhile Massena on the same day had assaulted the heights of Biastro,  and carrying them at the point of the bayonet, cut off Beaulieu's  communication with Colli; then Laparpe came in front and in flank also  upon the village of Dego, and after a most desperate conflict, drove the  Austrian commander-in-chief from his post. From this moment Colli and  Beaulieu were entirely separated. After the affairs of Dego and  Millesimo, the former retreated in disorder upon Ceva; the latter, hotly  pursued, upon Aqui; Colli, of course, being eager to cover Turin, while  the Austrian had his anxious thoughts already upon Milan. Colli was  again defeated at Mondovi in his disastrous retreat; he there lost his  cannon, his baggage, and the best part of his troops. The Sardinian army  might be said to be annihilated. The conqueror took possession of  Cherasco, within 10 miles of Turin, and there dictated the terms on  which the King of Sardinia was to be permitted to retain any shadow of  sovereign power.    Thus, in less than a month, did Napoleon lay the gates of Italy open  before him. He had defeated in three battles forces much superior to his  own; inflicted on them in killed, wounded and prisoners, a loss of  25,000 men; taken eighty guns and twenty-one standards; reduced the  Austrians to inaction; utterly destroyed the Sardinian king's army; and  lastly, wrested from his hands Coni and Tortona, the two great  fortresses called \"the keys of the Alps,\"--and indeed, except Turin  itself, every place of any consequence in his dominions. This  unfortunate prince did not long survive such humiliation. He was  father-in-law to both of the brothers of Louis XVI., and, considering  their cause and his own dignity as equally at an end, died of a broken  heart, within a few days after he had signed the treaty of Cherasco."]]]
