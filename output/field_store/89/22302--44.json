He treated the first in the land in an  inconsiderate and despotic manner, removed the most deserving from their  command, and trusted himself alone. This same man, who had climbed the  path to greatness with so much foresight, self-command, energy, and  statesmanship, seemed now, the nearer he grew to the summit of his  ambition, to lose all clearness of sight and moderation, which traits  alone could help him to take this last and dangerous step. He had the  advantage of tried troops, the elephants of Alexander, and the fleet  under the command of his brother-in-law was near the mouth of the Nile;  but he had overstepped the mark.    Just at this time, the news reached him from Asia Minor that Eumenes had  conquered Neoptolemas, the governor of Armenia, who had taken the side  of Ptolemy.    With all the more hope, Perdiccas went to meet the enemy. He reached  Pelusium undisturbed. It was highly necessary that the army should  cross to the Pelusaic side of the Nile, for there were several secure  places there, which, if allowed to remain in the hands of the enemy,  would endanger the forward movement.    [Illustration: 040.jpg A SILHOUETTE ON THE NILE]    There were also plentiful supplies of provisions within the Delta,  whilst the way through the so-called Arabia was sparsely inhabited.    If he did not find the Egyptians there, Perdiccas would install himself  within one of the fortresses on that side, and thence conduct operations  against them, and, at the same time, remain in connection with his  fleet, on which he could fall back in case of need. To enable the  crossing to be accomplished as easily as possible, Perdiccas ordered the  cleaning out of an old and filled-in canal, that led up from the Nile.  The work was evidently begun without much thought, for the fact had not  been considered that, at the rising of the Nile, the canal would want  a much deeper bed than the present stream required. The canal had  only just been opened up, when the water rose with unusual force and  rapidity; the dam was completely destroyed, and many workers lost their  lives. During the disturbance, many officers and men left the camp and  hurried to Ptolemy. This was the beginning of the Egyptian war. The  desertion of so many important men made Perdiccas think seriously.  He summoned the officers of the army, spoke to them with much  condescension, gave presents to some, honoured others with promotion,  and begged them, for the sake of their honour and for the cause of their  kings, to fight their hardest against this rebel, and with the order to  hold their men in-readiness, he left them. The army was only told in the  evening, at the signal for starting, where they were to march. Perdiccas  feared, on account of the desertion that was taking place in his army,  that his march might be discovered by the enemy. They marched with great  speed through the night, and camped at last on the side of the river.  At daybreak, after the troops had rested, Perdiccas gave the order  to cross. First came the elephants, then the light infantry, next the  storming party with ladders, and lastly, the pick of the cavalry, who,  if the enemy should burst out during the storming, could easily drive  them back. Perdiccas hoped, if he could only get a firm footing on  that side of the river, to annihilate the Egyptian army easily with his  superior force. He was right in feeling that his Macedonian troops, when  face to face with the enemy, would forget their antipathy to him,  and think only of their military honour. When about half the army had  crossed, and just as the elephants were moving towards the fortress, the  enemy were seen hurrying thither with great speed; their trumpet-calls  and war-cries even were heard. They reached the fort before the  Macedonians, and withdrew into the shelter of its walls. Not discouraged  by this, the infantry stormed the fort. Ladders were placed against  the walls, the elephants driven forward, and palisades taken from their  backs to attack the ramparts.    Ptolemy, in the dress of a Macedonian soldier, stood on the wall  surrounded by a few selected men. He was first in the fight. From where  he stood he pierced with his lance the eyes of the leading elephant, and  stabbed the Indian on its back, and he wounded many and killed numbers  of the storming party. His officers and men fought with the greatest  spirit; the driver of the second elephant was killed and the infantry  were driven back.    Perdiccas led new troops to the attack, wishing to take the fortress at  all costs. By word and deed, Ptolemy urged on his men, who fought with  marvellous endurance. The dreadful battle waged the whole day; many were  killed and wounded; evening came on and nothing was decided. Perdiccas  ordered a retreat and returned to his camp.    In the middle of the night he again started with his army, hoping that  Ptolemy would stay in the fort with his troops, and that, after a trying  march of some miles up-stream, he (Perdiccas) would be able to cross the  river more easily. At daybreak he found himself opposite one of the many  islands of the Nile; it was large enough for the camp of a great army.  In spite of the difficulties of crossing, he decided to encamp his army  there. The water reached up to the soldiers' knees, and it was with the  greatest difficulty that they kept their footing against the force  of the current. In order to break this current, Perdiccas ordered the  elephants into the river to stand up-stream to the left of the fording  party; he ordered the horsemen to stand at the other end to help those  across that were driven down by the current. Some had, with great  difficulty, managed to get across; others were still in the stream when  it was noticed that the water was becoming deeper; the heavily armed men  sank, and the elephants and horses stood deeper and deeper in the water.  A fearful panic seized the army. They called out that the enemy had  closed in the canals up-stream, and that the gods had destined bad  weather in the upper provinces, on account of which the river was  swollen. Those who understood saw that the bed of the river had become  deepened by the crossing of so great a cavalcade. It was impossible for  the remainder to cross or for those on the island to return. They were  completely cut off and were at the mercy of the enemy, who were already  seen approaching. There was nothing left but to order them to get back  as well as they could; lucky indeed were those who could swim, and had  sufficient strength to bring them across the broad expanse of water.    [Illustration: 044.jpg CROCODILES BASKING IN THE SUN]    Many saved themselves in this way. They came without weapons, worn out  and desperate, to the shore; others were drowned or eaten by crocodiles.  Some were carried down-stream, and reached the shore where the enemy  stood. Two thousand men were missing, many officers among them. The camp  of the Egyptians was situated on the other side, and they could be seen  helping the men in the water and burning logs of wood to show honour  to the dead. On this side of the river there was sad silence; each man  sought his comrade, or officer, and sought in vain. Food was scarce, and  there was no means of overcoming this dreadful state of affairs; night  came on, and curses and complaints were heard on all sides. The lives of  so many brave men had been sacrificed for nothing; it was bad enough to  lose the \"honour of their arms,\" but now, through the stupidity of their  leader, their lives had been lost, and to be swallowed by crocodiles was  now the distinguished death of Macedonian warriors. Many of the officers  went to the tent of the regent, and told him openly that he was the  cause of this calamity. Outside the tent the Macedonians yelled, beside  themselves with rage. About a hundred of the officers, headed by the  satrap Python, refused to share further responsibility, resigned their  commissions, and left the tent. The excitement grew intense. The troops,  in ungovernable rage, entered the regent's tent and threw themselves  upon him. Antigonus struck the first blow, others followed, and, after  a desperate but short struggle, Perdiccas fell to the ground covered  with wounds.    Thus died Perdiccas, in the third year of his regency. His great idea,  the unity of the kingdom entrusted to his care, should have made him  worthy of more success had he given himself up to this idea with more  conscientiousness. Unfortunately, with growing power, he became  despotic and unjust. He was not great enough to become the successor of  Alexander, to be another \"ruler of the world.\" This last step, the one  which was to lead him to his long-coveted goal, led him instead to his  death.    Ptolemy soon heard the news, and the next morning he crossed the river  and came to the camp. He asked to be taken to the kings, presented them  and some of the nobles with gifts; was kind and considerate to all, and  was greeted with great joy. Then he called the troops together and spoke  to them. He told the Macedonians that it was only stern necessity that  caused him to take up arms against his old comrades. No man regretted  more than he the untimely death of so many heroes. Perdiccas was the  cause of this calamity; he had but received his just punishment. Now all  enmity was to be ended. He had saved as many as he could from death in  the water, and the corpses which the river had brought to the shore he  had buried with all honour; and finally he told them that he had given  orders for the immediate alleviation of the want which he knew was being  felt in the camp. His speech was received with loud cheers. He stood  there unhurt and admired before the Macedonians, who but a few hours  earlier had been his bitterest foes. Now they looked upon him as their  saviour; they all"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17331"],[0,"History of Egypt From 330 B.C. To the Present Time, Volume 11 (of 12) (#7)"],[1,"second is situate on a mountain at a distance of one day's  journey from the last; the third is at a second Hydreuma, distant from  Koptos ninety-five miles; the fourth is on a mountain; the next to that  is another Hydreuma, that of Apollo, and is distant from Koptos one  hundred and eighty-four miles; after which there is another on a  mountain; there is then another station at a place called the New  Hydreuma, distant from Koptos two hundred and thirty miles; and next  to it there is another called the Old Hydreuma, where a detachment  is always on guard, with a caravansary that affords lodging for two  thousand persons. The last is distant from the New Hydreuma seven  miles. After leaving it, we come to the city of Berenice, situate upon  a harbour of the Red Sea, and distant from Koptos two hundred and  fifty-seven miles. The greater part of this distance is generally  travelled by night, on account of the extreme heat, the day being spent  at the stations; in consequence of which it takes twelve days to perform  the whole journey from Koptos to Berenice.    \"Passengers generally set sail at midsummer before the rising of the  Dog-star, or else immediately after, and in about thirty days arrive  at Ocelis in Arabia, or else at Cane, in the region which bears  frankincense. To those who are bound for India, Ocelis is the best place  for embarkation. If the wind called Hippolus happens to be blowing,  it is possible to arrive in forty days at the nearest mart of India,  Muziris by name [the modern Mangalore]. This, however, is not a very  desirable place for disembarkation, on account of the pirates which  frequent its vicinity, where they occupy a place, Mtrias; nor, in fact,  is it very rich in articles of merchandise. Besides, the roadstead for  shipping is a considerable distance from the shore, and the cargoes  have to be conveyed in boats, either for loading or discharging. At the  moment that I am writing these pages,\" continues Pliny, \"the name of  the king of the place is Caelobotras. Another part, and a much more  convenient one, is that which lies in the territory of the people called  Neacyndi, Barace by name. Here King Pandian used to reign, dwelling at a  considerable distance from the mart in the interior, at a city known  as Modiera. The district from which pepper is carried down to Barace  in boats hollowed out of a single tree, is known as Cottonara. None of  these names of nations, ports, and cities are to be found in any of  the former writers, from which circumstance it would appear that the  localities have since changed their names. Travellers set sail from  India on their return to Europe, at the beginning of the Egyptian month  Tybus, which is our December, or, at all events, before the sixth day of  the Egyptian month Mechir, the same as our ides of January: if they do  this, they can go and return in the same year. They set sail from  India with a south-east wind, and, upon entering the Red Sea, catch the  south-west or south.\"    The places on the Indian coast which the Egyptian merchant vessels then  reached are verified from the coins found there; and as we know the  course of the trade-wind by which they arrived, we also know the part of  Africa where they left the shore and braved the dangers of the ocean.  A hoard of Roman gold coins of these reigns has been dug up in our own  days near Calicut, under the roots of a banyan-tree. It had been there  buried by an Alexandrian merchant on his arrival from this voyage, and  left safe under the cover of the sacred tree to await his return from a  second journey. But he died before his return, and his secret died with  him. The products of the Indian trade were chiefly silk, diamonds, and  other precious stones, ginger, spices, and some scents. The state of  Ethiopia was then such that no trade came down the Nile to Syene;  and the produce of southern Africa was brought by coasting vessels to  Berenice. These products were ivory, rhinoceros teeth, hippopotamus  skins, tortoise shell, apes, monkeys, and slaves, a list which throws  a sidelight both on the pursuits of the natives and the tastes of the  ultimate purchasers.    [Illustration: 047.jpg AN ARAB GIRL]    The Romans in most cases collected the revenues of a province by means  of a publican or farmer, to whom the taxes were let by auction; but such  was the importance of Egypt that the same jealousy which made them think  its government too great to be trusted to a man of high rank, made them  think its revenues too large to be trusted to one farmer. The smaller  branches of the Egyptian revenue were, however, let out as usual, and  even the collection of the customs of the whole of the Red Sea was not  thought too much to trust to one citizen. Annius Plocamus, who farmed  them in this reign, had a little fleet under his command to collect them  with; and, tempted either by trade or plunder, his ships were sometimes  as far out as the south coast of Arabia. On one occasion one of his  freedmen in the command of a vessel was carried by a north wind into  the open ocean, and after being fifteen days at sea found himself on the  coast of Ceylon. This island was not then wholly new to the geographers  of Egypt and Europe. It had been heard of by the pilots in the voyage of  Alexander the Great; Eratosthenes had given it a place in his map; and  it had often been reached from Africa by the sailors of the Red Sea in  wickerwork boats made of papyrus; but this was the first time it had  been visited by a European.    In the neighbourhood of the above-mentioned road from Koptos to Berenice  were the porphyritic quarries and the emerald mines, which were briskly  worked under the Emperor Claudius. The mountain was now named the  Claudian Mountain.    As this route for trade became known, the geographers began to  understand the wide space that separates India from Africa. Hitherto,  notwithstanding a few voyages of discovery, it had been the common  opinion that Persia was in the neighbourhood of Ethiopia. The Greeks had  thought that the Nile rose in India, in opposition to the Jews, who said  that it was the river Gibon of the garden of Eden, which made a circuit  round the whole of the land of Cush, or Ethiopia. The names of these  countries got misused accordingly; and even after the mistake was  cleared up we sometimes find Ethiopia called India.    The Egyptian chemists were able to produce very bright dyes by methods  then unknown to Greece or Rome. They dipped the cloth first into a  liquid of one colour, called a mordant, to prepare it, and then into  a liquid of a second colour; and it came out dyed of a third colour,  unlike either of the former. The ink with which they wrote the name of  a deceased person on the mummy-cloth, like our own marking-ink, was made  with nitrate of silver. Their knowledge of chemistry was far greater  than that of their neighbours, and the science is even now named from  the country of its birth. The later Arabs called it Alchemia, _the  Egyptian art_, and hence our words alchemy and chemistry. So also  Naphtha, or _rock oil_, from the coast of the Red Sea; and Anthracite,  or _rock fuel_, from the coast of Syria, both bear Egyptian names.  To some Egyptian stones the Romans gave their own names; as the black  glassy obsidian from Nubia they called after Obsidius, who found it;  the black Tiberian marble with white spots, and the Augustan marble with  regular wavy veins, were both named after the emperors. Porphyry was  now used for statues for the first time, and sometimes to make a kind of  patchwork figure, in which the clothed parts were of the coloured stone,  while the head, hands, and feet were of white marble. And it was thought  that diamonds were nowhere to be found but in the Ethiopian gold mines.    Several kinds of wine were made in Egypt; some in the Arsinoite nome on  the banks of the lake Mceris; and a poor Libyan wine at Antiplme on the  coast, a hundred miles from Alexandria. Wine had also been made in  Upper Egypt in small quantities a very long time, as we learn from the  monuments; but it was produced with difficulty and cost and was not  good; it was not valued by the Greeks. It was poor and thin, and drunk  only by those who were feverish and afraid of anything stronger. That  of Anthylla, to the east of Alexandria, was very much better. But better  still were the thick luscious Taeniotic and the mild delicate Mareotic  wines. This last was first grown at Plinthine, but afterwards on all the  banks of the lake Mareotis. The Mareotic wine was white and sweet and  thin, and very little heating or intoxicating. Horace had carelessly  said of Cleopatra that she was drunk with Mareotic wine; but Lucan, who  better knew its quality, says that the headstrong lady drank wine far  stronger than the Mareotic. Near Sebennytus three kinds of wine were  made; one bitter named Peuce, a second sparkling named AEthalon, and  the third Thasian, from a vine imported from Thasus. But none of these  Egyptian wines was thought equal to those of Greece and Italy. Nor were  they made in quantities large enough or cheap enough for the poor; and  here, as in other countries, the common people for their intoxicating  drink used beer or spirits made from barley.    [Illustration: 051.jpg FARMING IN EGYPT]    The Egyptian sour wine, however, made very good vinegar, and it was then  exported for sale in Rome. During this half-century that great national  work, the lake of Moeris, by which thousands of acres had been flooded  and made fertile, and the watering of the lower country regulated, was,  through the neglect of the embankments, at once destroyed. The latest  traveller who mentions it is Strabo, and the latest geographer Pomponius  Mela. By its means the province of Arsinoe was made one of the most  fruitful and beautiful spots in Egypt. Here only does the olive grow  wild. Here the vine will grow. And by the help of this embanked lake"]]]
