Other knowledges We do as  well possess, not a single letter of which We can disclose, nor do We find  humanity able to hear even the barest reference to their meaning. Thus  have We informed you of the knowledge of God, the All-Knowing, the  All-Wise. Were We to find worthy vessels, We would deposit within them the  treasures of hidden meanings and impart unto them a knowledge, one letter  of which would encompass all created things.    67 O Inmost Heart of this Temple! We have made thee the dawning-place of  Our knowledge and the dayspring of Our wisdom unto all who are in heaven  and on earth. From thee have We caused all sciences to appear, and unto  thee shall We cause them to return. And from thee shall We bring them  forth a second time. Such, indeed, is Our promise, and potent are We to  effect Our purpose. Erelong shall We bring into being through thee  exponents of new and wondrous sciences, of potent and effective crafts,  and shall make manifest through them that which the heart of none of Our  servants hath yet conceived. Thus do We bestow upon whom We will  whatsoever We desire, and thus do We withdraw from whom We will what We  had once bestowed. Even so do We ordain whatsoever We please through Our  behest.    68 Say: Should We choose, at one time, to shed the radiance of Our loving  providence upon the mirrors of all things, and, at another, to withhold  from them the splendours of Our light, this verily lieth within Our power,  and none hath the right to ask \"why\" or \"wherefore\". For We are potent  indeed to achieve Our purpose, and render no account for that which We  bring to pass; and none can dispute this save those who join partners with  God and doubt His Truth. Say: Nothing can withstand the power of Our might  or interrupt the course of Our command. We exalt whomsoever We please unto  the Realm of supernal might and glory, and, should We so desire, cause the  same to sink into the lowest abyss of degradation.    69 O dwellers of the earth! Would ye contend that if We raise up a soul  unto the Sadratu'l-Muntaha,(8) it shall then cease to be subject to the  power of Our sovereignty and dominion? Nay, by Mine own Self! Should it be  Our wish, We would return it to the dust in less than the twinkling of an  eye. Consider a tree: Behold how We plant it in a garden, and nourish it  with the waters of Our loving care; and how, when it hath grown tall and  mature, and brought forth verdant leaves and goodly fruits, We send forth  the tempestuous gales of Our decree, tear it up by its roots, and lay it  prostrate upon the face of the earth. So hath it been Our way with all  things, and so shall it be in this day. Such, in truth, are the matchless  wonders of Our immutable method--a method which hath ever governed, and  shall continue to govern, all things, if ye be of them that perceive.  None, however, knoweth the wisdom thereof save God, the All-Powerful, the  Almighty, the All-Wise.    70 Would ye gainsay, O people, the very thing that your eyes behold? Woe  unto you, O assemblage of deniers! That which alone is exempt from change  is His own Self, the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate, were ye to gaze  with the eye of insight, while all else beside Him can be altered by an  act of His Will. He, verily, is the All-Powerful, the Almighty, the  All-Wise.    71 O people! Dispute not concerning My Cause, for ye shall never fathom  the manifold wisdom of your Lord, nor shall ye ever gauge the knowledge of  Him Who is the All-Glorious, the All-Pervading. Whosoever layeth claim to  have known His Essence is without doubt among the most ignorant of all  people. Every atom in the universe would charge such a man with imposture,  and to this beareth witness My tongue which speaketh naught but the truth.  Magnify My Cause and promulgate My teachings and commandments, for none  other course beside this shall beseem you, and no other path shall ever  lead unto Him. Would that ye might heed Our counsel!    72 O Living Temple! We have made Thee the Dayspring of each one of Our  most excellent titles, the Dawning-Place of each one of Our most august  attributes, and the Fountainhead of each one of Our manifold virtues unto  the denizens of earth and heaven. Thereafter have We raised Thee up in Our  own image betwixt the heavens and the earth, and ordained Thee to be the  sign of Our glory unto all who are in the realms of revelation and  creation, that My servants may follow in Thy footsteps, and be of them who  are guided aright. We have appointed Thee the Tree of grace and bounty  unto the dwellers of both the heavens and the earth. Well is it with them  who seek the shelter of Thy shade and who draw nigh unto Thy Self, the  omnipotent Protector of the worlds.    73 Say: We have made each one of Our Names a wellspring from which We have  caused the streams of divine wisdom and understanding to gush forth and  flow in the garden of Our Cause--streams whose number none can reckon save  Thy Lord, the Most Holy, the Omnipotent, the Omniscient, the All-Wise.  Say: We have generated all Letters from the Point and have caused them to  return unto It, and We have sent It down again in the form of a human  temple. All glory be unto the Author of this incomparable and wondrous  handiwork! Erelong shall We unfold and expound It again, in Our name, the  All-Glorious. This is indeed a token of Our grace, and I, truly, am the  Most Bountiful, the Ancient of Days.    74 We have brought forth all Lights from the Orb of Our name, the True  One, have caused them to return unto It, and have again made them manifest  in the form of a human temple. All glory be unto the Lord of strength,  might, and power! None can withstand the operation of My will or the  exercise of My might. I am He Who hath raised up all creatures through a  word of My mouth, and My power is, in truth, equal to My purpose.    75 Say: It is in Our power, should We wish it, to cause all created things  to expire in an instant, and, with the next, to endue them again with  life. The knowledge thereof, however, is with God alone, the All-Knowing,  the All-Informed. It is in Our power, should We wish it, to enable a speck  of floating dust to generate, in less than the twinkling of an eye, suns  of infinite, of unimaginable splendour, to cause a dewdrop to develop into  vast and numberless oceans, to infuse into every letter such a force as to  empower it to unfold all the knowledge of past and future ages. This, in  truth, is a matter simple of accomplishment. Such have been the evidences  of My power from the beginning that hath no beginning until the end that  hath no end. My creatures, however, have been oblivious of My power, have  repudiated My sovereignty, and contended with Mine own Self, the  All-Knowing, the All-Wise.    76 Say: Of all that lieth between heaven and earth, naught can stir except  by My leave, and unto My Kingdom none can ascend save at My behest. My  creatures, however, have remained veiled from My might and My sovereignty,  and are numbered with the heedless. Say: Naught is seen in My revelation  but the Revelation of God, and in My might but His Might, could ye but  know it. Say: My creatures are even as the leaves of a tree. They proceed  from the tree, and depend upon it for their existence, yet remain  oblivious of their root and origin. We draw such similitudes for the sake  of Our discerning servants that perchance they may transcend a mere  plant-like level of existence and attain unto true maturity in this  resistless and immovable Cause. Say: My creatures are even as the fish of  the deep. Their life dependeth upon the water, and yet they remain unaware  of that which, by the grace of an omniscient and omnipotent Lord,  sustaineth their very existence. Indeed, their heedlessness is such that  were they asked concerning the water and its properties, they would prove  entirely ignorant. Thus do We set forth comparisons and similitudes, that  perchance the people may turn unto Him Who is the Object of the adoration  of the entire creation.    77 O people! Fear God, and disbelieve not in Him Whose grace hath  surrounded all things, Whose mercy hath pervaded the contingent world, and  the sovereign potency of Whose Cause hath encompassed both your inner and  your outer beings, both your beginning and your end. Stand ye in awe of  the Lord, and be of them that act uprightly. Beware lest ye be accounted  among those who allow the verses of their Lord to pass them by unheard and  unrecognized; these, truly, are of the wayward.    78 Say: Would ye worship him who neither heareth nor seeth, and who is of  a truth the most abject and wretched of all God's servants? Wherefore have  ye failed to follow the One Who hath come unto you from the Source of  Divine Command bearing the tidings of God, the Most Exalted, the Most  Great? O people! Be not like unto those who presented themselves before  Our throne, and yet failed to perceive or comprehend; these are indeed a  contemptible people. We recited unto them verses that would enrapture the  dwellers of the heavenly Dominion and the inmates of the Kingdom on high,  and yet they departed veiled therefrom, and hearkened rather unto the  voice of him who is but a servant of God and a mere creation of His Will.  Thus do We impart unto you that which shall guide you towards the path of  God's favoured ones.    79 How many those who entered within the Abode of Paradise, the Seat  wherein the throne of God had been established, and stood before their  Lord, the Most Exalted, the Most Great, only to inquire about the four  Gates or of some Imam of the Islamic Faith!(9) Such was the state of these  souls, if ye be of them that comprehend. It is even as ye witness in the  present day: those who have disbelieved in God and joined partners with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17310"],[0,"Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas (#7)"],[1,"be attained save by recognizing Him Who is  the Bearer of the Most Great Name. He is, in truth, the Speaker on Sinai  Who is now seated upon the throne of Revelation. He is the Hidden Mystery  and the Treasured Symbol. All the former and latter Books of God are  adorned with His praise and extol His glory. Through Him the standard of  knowledge hath been planted in the world and the ensign of the oneness of  God hath been unfurled amidst all peoples. Attainment unto the Divine  Presence can be realized solely by attaining His presence. Through His  potency everything that hath, from time immemorial, been veiled and  hidden, is now revealed. He is made manifest through the power of Truth  and hath uttered a Word whereby all that are in the heavens and on the  earth have been dumbfounded, except those whom the Almighty was pleased to  exempt. True belief in God and recognition of Him cannot be complete save  by acceptance of that which He hath revealed and by observance of  whatsoever hath been decreed by Him and set down in the Book by the Pen of  Glory.    They that immerse themselves in the ocean of His utterances should at all  times have the utmost regard for the divinely-revealed ordinances and  prohibitions. Indeed His ordinances constitute the mightiest stronghold  for the protection of the world and the safeguarding of its peoples--a  light upon those who acknowledge and recognize the truth, and a fire unto  such as turn away and deny.    The second Tajalli is to remain steadfast in the Cause of God--exalted be  His glory--and to be unswerving in His love. And this can in no wise be  attained except through full recognition of Him; and full recognition  cannot be obtained save by faith in the blessed words: 'He doeth  whatsoever He willeth.' Whoso tenaciously cleaveth unto this sublime word  and drinketh deep from the living waters of utterance which are inherent  therein, will be imbued with such a constancy that all the books of the  world will be powerless to deter him from the Mother Book. O how glorious  is this sublime station, this exalted rank, this ultimate purpose!    O 'Ali-Akbar! Consider how abject is the state of the disbelievers. They  all give utterance to the words: 'Verily He is to be praised in His deeds  and is to be obeyed in His behest.' Nevertheless if We reveal aught which,  even to the extent of a needle's eye, runneth counter to their selfish  ways and desires, they will disdainfully reject it. Say, none can ever  fathom the manifold exigencies of God's consummate wisdom. In truth, were  He to pronounce the earth to be heaven, no one hath the right to question  His authority. This is that whereunto the Point of the Bayan hath  testified in all that was sent down unto Him with truth at the behest of  God, He Who hath caused the Dawn to break.    The third Tajalli is concerning arts, crafts and sciences. Knowledge is as  wings to man's life, and a ladder for his ascent. Its acquisition is  incumbent upon everyone. The knowledge of such sciences, however, should  be acquired as can profit the peoples of the earth, and not those which  begin with words and end with words. Great indeed is the claim of  scientists and craftsmen on the peoples of the world. Unto this beareth  witness the Mother Book on the day of His return. Happy are those  possessed of a hearing ear. In truth, knowledge is a veritable treasure  for man, and a source of glory, of bounty, of joy, of exaltation, of cheer  and gladness unto him. Thus hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken in this  Most Great Prison.    The fourth Tajalli is concerning Divinity, Godhead and the like. Were a  man of insight to direct his gaze towards the blessed, the manifest  Lote-Tree and its fruits, he would be so enriched thereby as to be  independent of aught else and to acknowledge his belief in that which the  Speaker on Sinai hath uttered from the throne of Revelation.    O 'Ali-Akbar! Acquaint the people with the holy verses of thy Lord and  make known unto them His straight Path, His mighty Announcement.    Say: O people, if ye judge fairly and equitably, ye will testify to the  truth of whatsoever hath streamed forth from the Most Exalted Pen. If ye  be of the people of the Bayan, the Persian Bayan will guide you aright and  will prove a sufficient testimony unto you; and if ye be of the people of  the Qur'an, ponder ye upon the Revelation on Sinai and the Voice from the  Bush which came unto the Son of 'Imran [Moses].    Gracious God! It was intended that at the time of the manifestation of the  One true God the faculty of recognizing Him would have been developed and  matured and would have reached its culmination. However, it is now clearly  demonstrated that in the disbelievers this faculty hath remained  undeveloped and hath, indeed, degenerated.    O 'Ali! That which they accepted from the Bush they now refuse to accept  from Him Who is the Tree of the world of existence. Say, O people of the  Bayan, speak not according to the dictates of passion and selfish desire.  Most of the peoples of the earth attest the truth of the blessed Word  which hath come forth from the Bush.    By the righteousness of God! But for the anthem of praise voiced by Him  Who heralded the divine Revelation, this Wronged One would never have  breathed a word which might have struck terror into the hearts of the  ignorant and caused them to perish. Dwelling on the glorification of Him  Whom God shall make manifest--exalted be His Manifestation--the Bab in the  beginning of the Bayan saith: 'He is the One Who shall proclaim under all  conditions, \"Verily, verily, I am God, no God is there but Me, the Lord of  all created things. In truth all others except Me are My creatures. O, My  creatures! Me alone do ye worship.\"' Likewise in another instance He,  magnifying the Name of Him Who shall be made manifest, saith: 'I would be  the first to adore Him.' Now it behoveth one to reflect upon the  significance of the 'Adorer' and the 'Adored One', that perchance the  people of the earth may partake of a dewdrop from the ocean of divine  knowledge and may be enabled to perceive the greatness of this Revelation.  Verily, He hath appeared and hath unloosed His tongue to proclaim the  Truth. Well is it with him who doth acknowledge and recognize the truth,  and woe betide the froward and the wayward.    O kindreds of the earth! Incline your ears unto the Voice from the divine  Lote-Tree which overshadoweth the world and be not of the people of  tyranny on earth--men who have repudiated the Manifestation of God and His  invincible authority and have renounced His favours--they in truth are  reckoned with the contemptible in the Book of God, the Lord of all  mankind.    The Glory which hath dawned above the horizon of My tender mercy rest upon  thee and upon whosoever is with thee and giveth ear to thy words  concerning the Cause of God, the Almighty, the All-Praised.                            KALIMAT-I-FIRDAWSIYYIH (WORDS OF PARADISE)      He is the One Who speaketh through the power of Truth in the Kingdom of  Utterance    O YE the embodiments of justice and equity and the manifestations of  uprightness and of heavenly bounties! In tears and lamenting, this Wronged  One calleth aloud and saith: O God, my God! Adorn the heads of Thy loved  ones with the crown of detachment and attire their temples with the  raiment of righteousness.    It behoveth the people of Baha to render the Lord victorious through the  power of their utterance and to admonish the people by their goodly deeds  and character, inasmuch as deeds exert greater influence than words.    O Haydar-'Ali!(11) Upon thee be the praise of God and His glory. Say:  Honesty, virtue, wisdom and a saintly character redound to the exaltation  of man, while dishonesty, imposture, ignorance and hypocrisy lead to his  abasement. By My life! Man's distinction lieth not in ornaments or wealth,  but rather in virtuous behaviour and true understanding. Most of the  people in Persia are steeped in deception and idle fancy. How great the  difference between the condition of these people and the station of such  valiant souls as have passed beyond the sea of names and pitched their  tents upon the shores of the ocean of detachment. Indeed none but a few of  the existing generation hath yet earned the merit of hearkening unto the  warblings of the doves of the all-highest Paradise. 'Few of My servants  are truly thankful.'(12) People for the most part delight in  superstitions. They regard a single drop of the sea of delusion as  preferable to an ocean of certitude. By holding fast unto names they  deprive themselves of the inner reality and by clinging to vain imaginings  they are kept back from the Dayspring of heavenly signs. God grant you may  be graciously aided under all conditions to shatter the idols of  superstition and to tear away the veils of the imaginations of men.  Authority lieth in the grasp of God, the Fountainhead of revelation and  inspiration and the Lord of the Day of Resurrection.    We heard that which the person in question hath mentioned regarding  certain teachers of the Faith. Indeed he hath spoken truly. Some heedless  souls roam the lands in the name of God, actively engaged in ruining His  Cause, and call it promoting and teaching the Word of God; and this  notwithstanding that the qualifications of the teachers of the Faith, like  unto stars, shine resplendent throughout the heavens of the divine  Tablets. Every fair-minded person testifieth and every man of insight is  well aware that the One true God--exalted be His glory--hath unceasingly set  forth and expounded that which will elevate the station and will exalt the  rank of the children of men.    The people of Baha burn brightly amidst the gatherings even as a candle  and hold fast unto that which God hath purposed. This station standeth  supreme above all stations. Well is it with him who hath cast away the  things that the"]]]
