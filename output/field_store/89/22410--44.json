Do not allow difference of opinion, or diversity of thought to separate  you from your fellow-men, or to be the cause of dispute, hatred and strife  in your hearts.    Rather, search diligently for the truth and make all men your friends.    Every edifice is made of many different stones, yet each depends on the  other to such an extent that if one were displaced the whole building  would suffer; if one is faulty the structure is imperfect.    Baha'u'llah has drawn the circle of unity, He has made a design for the  uniting of all the peoples, and for the gathering of them all under the  shelter of the tent of universal unity. This is the work of the Divine  Bounty, and we must all strive with heart and soul until we have the  reality of unity in our midst, and as we work, so will strength be given  unto us. Leave all thought of self, and strive only to be obedient and  submissive to the Will of God. In this way only shall we become citizens  of the Kingdom of God, and attain unto life everlasting.          THE TRUE MEANING OF THE PROPHECIES CONCERNING THE COMING OF CHRIST      October 30th    In the Bible there are prophecies of the coming of Christ. The Jews still  await the coming of the Messiah, and pray to God day and night to hasten  His advent.    When Christ came they denounced and slew Him, saying: 'This is not the One  for whom we wait. Behold when the Messiah shall come, signs and wonders  shall testify that He is in truth the Christ. We know the signs and  conditions, and they have not appeared. The Messiah will arise out of an  unknown city. He shall sit upon the throne of David, and behold, He shall  come with a sword of steel, and with a sceptre of iron shall He rule! He  shall fulfil the law of the Prophets, He shall conquer the East and the  West, and shall glorify His chosen people the Jews. He shall bring with  Him a reign of peace, during which even the animals shall cease to be at  enmity with man. For behold the wolf and the lamb shall drink from the  same spring, and the lion and the doe shall lie down in the same pasture,  the serpent and the mouse shall share the same nest, and all God's  creatures shall be at rest'.    According to the Jews, Jesus the Christ fulfilled none of these  conditions, for their eyes were holden and they could not see.    He came from Nazareth, no unknown place. He carried no sword in His hand,  nor even a stick. He did not sit upon the Throne of David, He was a poor  man. He reformed the Law of Moses, and broke the Sabbath Day. He did not  conquer the East and the West, but was Himself subject to the Roman Law.  He did not exalt the Jews, but taught equality and brotherhood, and  rebuked the Scribes and Pharisees. He brought in no reign of peace, for  during His lifetime injustice and cruelty reached such a height that even  He Himself fell a victim to it, and died a shameful death upon the cross.    Thus the Jews thought and spoke, for they did not understand the  Scriptures nor the glorious truths that were contained in them. The letter  they knew by heart, but of the life-giving spirit they understood not a  word.    Hearken, and I will show you the meaning thereof. Although He came from  Nazareth, which was a known place, He also came from Heaven. His body was  born of Mary, but His Spirit came from Heaven. The sword He carried was  the sword of His tongue, with which He divided the good from the evil, the  true from the false, the faithful from the unfaithful, and the light from  the darkness. His Word was indeed a sharp sword! The Throne upon which He  sat is the Eternal Throne from which Christ reigns for ever, a heavenly  throne, not an earthly one, for the things of earth pass away but heavenly  things pass not away. He re-interpreted and completed the Law of Moses and  fulfilled the Law of the Prophets. His word conquered the East and the  West. His Kingdom is everlasting. He exalted those Jews who recognized  Him. They were men and women of humble birth, but contact with Him made  them great and gave them everlasting dignity. The animals who were to live  with one another signified the different sects and races, who, once having  been at war, were now to dwell in love and charity, drinking together the  water of life from Christ the Eternal Spring.    Thus, all the spiritual prophecies concerning the coming of Christ were  fulfilled, but the Jews shut their eyes that they should not see, and  their ears that they should not hear, and the Divine Reality of Christ  passed through their midst unheard, unloved and unrecognized.    It is easy to read the Holy Scriptures, but it is only with a clean heart  and a pure mind that one may understand their true meaning. Let us ask  God's help to enable us to understand the Holy Books. Let us pray for eyes  to see and ears to hear, and for hearts that long for peace.    God's eternal Mercy is immeasurable. He has always chosen certain souls  upon whom He has shed the Divine Bounty of His heart, whose minds He has  illumined with celestial light, to whom He has revealed the sacred  mysteries, and kept clear before their sight the Mirror of Truth. These  are the disciples of God, and His goodness has no bounds. You who are  servants of the Most High may be disciples also. The treasuries of God are  limitless.    The Spirit breathing through the Holy Scriptures is food for all who  hunger. God Who has given the revelation to His Prophets will surely give  of His abundance daily bread to all those who ask Him faithfully.          THE HOLY SPIRIT, THE INTERMEDIARY POWER BETWEEN GOD AND MAN      4 Avenue de Camoeens,  October 31st    The Divine Reality is Unthinkable, Limitless, Eternal, Immortal and  Invisible.    The world of creation is bound by natural law, finite and mortal.    The Infinite Reality cannot be said to ascend or descend. It is beyond the  understanding of man, and cannot be described in terms which apply to the  phenomenal sphere of the created world.    Man, then, is in extreme need of the only Power by which he is able to  receive help from the Divine Reality, that Power alone bringing him into  contact with the Source of all life.    An intermediary is needed to bring two extremes into relation with each  other. Riches and poverty, plenty and need: without an intermediary power  there could be no relation between these pairs of opposites.    So we can say there must be a Mediator between God and Man, and this is  none other than the Holy Spirit, which brings the created earth into  relation with the 'Unthinkable One', the Divine Reality.    The Divine Reality may be likened to the sun and the Holy Spirit to the  rays of the sun. As the rays of the sun bring the light and warmth of the  sun to the earth, giving life to all created beings, so do the  'Manifestations'(5) bring the power of the Holy Spirit from the Divine Sun  of Reality to give light and life to the souls of men.    Behold, there is an intermediary necessary between the sun and the earth;  the sun does not descend to the earth, neither does the earth ascend to  the sun. This contact is made by the rays of the sun which bring light and  warmth and heat.    The Holy Spirit is the Light from the Sun of Truth bringing, by its  infinite power, life and illumination to all mankind, flooding all souls  with Divine Radiance, conveying the blessings of God's Mercy to the whole  world. The earth, without the medium of the warmth and light of the rays  of the sun, could receive no benefits from the sun.    Likewise the Holy Spirit is the very cause of the life of man; without the  Holy Spirit he would have no intellect, he would be unable to acquire his  scientific knowledge by which his great influence over the rest of  creation is gained. The illumination of the Holy Spirit gives to man the  power of thought, and enables him to make discoveries by which he bends  the laws of nature to his will.    The Holy Spirit it is which, through the mediation of the Prophets of God,  teaches spiritual virtues to man and enables him to attain Eternal Life.    All these blessings are brought to man by the Holy Spirit; therefore we  can understand that the Holy Spirit is the Intermediary between the  Creator and the created. The light and heat of the sun cause the earth to  be fruitful, and create life in all things that grow; and the Holy Spirit  quickens the souls of men.    The two great apostles, St Peter and St John the Evangelist, were once  simple, humble workmen, toiling for their daily bread. By the Power of the  Holy Spirit their souls were illumined, and they received the eternal  blessings of the Lord Christ.          THE TWO NATURES IN MAN      November 1st    Today is a day of rejoicing in Paris! They are celebrating the Festival of  'All Saints'. Why do you think that these people were called 'Saints'? The  word has a very real meaning. A saint is one who leads a life of purity,  one who has freed himself from all human weaknesses and imperfections.    In man there are two natures; his spiritual or higher nature and his  material or lower nature. In one he approaches God, in the other he lives  for the world alone. Signs of both these natures are to be found in men.  In his material aspect he expresses untruth, cruelty and injustice; all  these are the outcome of his lower nature. The attributes of his Divine  nature are shown forth in love, mercy, kindness, truth and justice, one  and all being expressions of his higher nature. Every good habit, every  noble quality belongs to man's spiritual nature, whereas all his  imperfections and sinful actions are born of his material nature. If a  man's Divine nature dominates his human nature, we have a saint.    Man has the power both to do good and to do evil; if his power for good  predominates and his inclinations to do wrong are conquered, then man in  truth may be called a saint. But if, on the contrary, he rejects the  things of God and allows his evil"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19285"],[0,"The Promulgation of Universal Peace (#7)"],[1,"outside, etc. This, they say, is a fixed mathematical law of  perception and deduction, the operation of which admits of no doubt  whatever; for inasmuch as the universe is subject to our sensing, the  proof is self-evident that our knowledge of it must be gained through the  avenues of the senses. That is to say, the materialists announce that the  criterion and standard of human knowledge is sense perception. Among the  Greeks and Romans the criterion of knowledge was reason--that whatever is  provable and acceptable by reason must necessarily be admitted as true. A  third standard or criterion is the opinion held by theologians that  traditions or prophetic statement and interpretations constitute the basis  of human knowing. There is still another, a fourth criterion, upheld by  religionists and metaphysicians who say that the source and channel of all  human penetration into the unknown is through inspiration. Briefly then,  these four criteria according to the declarations of men are: first, sense  perception; second, reason; third, traditions; fourth, inspiration.    In Europe I told the philosophers and scientists of materialism that the  criterion of the senses is not reliable. For instance, consider a mirror  and the images reflected in it. These images have no actual corporeal  existence. Yet if you had never seen a mirror, you would firmly insist and  believe that they were real. The eye sees a mirage upon the desert as a  lake of water, but there is no reality in it. As we stand upon the deck of  a steamer, the shore appears to be moving, yet we know the land is  stationary and we are moving. The earth was believed to be fixed and the  sun revolving about it, but although this appears to be so, the reverse is  now known to be true. A whirling torch makes a circle of fire appear  before the eye, yet we realize there is but one point of light. We behold  a shadow moving upon the ground, but it has no material existence, no  substance. In deserts the atmospheric effects are particularly productive  of illusions which deceive the eye. Once I saw a mirage in which a whole  caravan appeared traveling upward into the sky. In the far North other  deceptive phenomena appear and baffle human vision. Sometimes three or  four suns, called by scientists mock suns, will be shining at the same  time, whereas we know that the great solar orb is one and that it remains  fixed and single. In brief, the senses are continually deceived, and we  are unable to separate that which is reality from that which is not.    As to the second criterion--reason--this likewise is unreliable and not to  be depended upon. This human world is an ocean of varying opinions. If  reason is the perfect standard and criterion of knowledge, why are  opinions at variance and why do philosophers disagree so completely with  each other? This is a clear proof that human reason is not to be relied  upon as an infallible criterion. For instance, great discoveries and  announcements of former centuries are continually upset and discarded by  the wise men of today. Mathematicians, astronomers, chemical scientists  continually disprove and reject the conclusions of the ancients; nothing  is fixed, nothing final; everything is continually changing because human  reason is progressing along new roads of investigation and arriving at new  conclusions every day. In the future much that is announced and accepted  as true now will be rejected and disproved. And so it will continue ad  infinitum.    When we consider the third criterion--traditions--upheld by theologians as  the avenue and standard of knowledge, we find this source equally  unreliable and unworthy of dependence. For religious traditions are the  report and record of understanding and interpretation of the Book. By what  means has this understanding, this interpretation been reached? By the  analysis of human reason. When we read the Book of God, the faculty of  comprehension by which we form conclusions is reason. Reason is mind. If  we are not endowed with perfect reason, how can we comprehend the meanings  of the Word of God? Therefore, human reason, as already pointed out, is by  its very nature finite and faulty in conclusions. It cannot surround the  Reality Itself, the Infinite Word. Inasmuch as the source of traditions  and interpretations is human reason, and human reason is faulty, how can  we depend upon its findings for real knowledge?    The fourth criterion I have named is inspiration through which it is  claimed the reality of knowledge is attainable. What is inspiration? It is  the influx of the human heart. But what are satanic promptings which  afflict mankind? They are the influx of the heart also. How shall we  differentiate between them? The question arises: How shall we know whether  we are following inspiration from God or satanic promptings of the human  soul? Briefly, the point is that in the human material world of phenomena  these four are the only existing criteria or avenues of knowledge, and all  of them are faulty and unreliable. What then remains? How shall we attain  the reality of knowledge? By the breaths and promptings of the Holy  Spirit, which is light and knowledge itself. Through it the human mind is  quickened and fortified into true conclusions and perfect knowledge. This  is conclusive argument showing that all available human criteria are  erroneous and defective, but the divine standard of knowledge is  infallible. Therefore, man is not justified in saying, \"I know because I  perceive through my senses,\" or \"I know because it is proved through my  faculty of reason,\" or \"I know because it is according to tradition and  interpretation of the Holy Book,\" or \"I know because I am inspired.\" All  human standards of judgment are faulty, finite.          17 April 1912  Talk at Home of Mr. and Mrs. Edward B. Kinney  780 West End Avenue, New York      Notes by John G. Grundy    In the Holy Books it is recorded that when the Sun of Truth dawns, it will  appear in the East, and its light will be reflected in the West. Already  its dawning has taken place in the East, and its signs are appearing in  the West. Its illumination shall spread rapidly and widely in the  Occident. The Sun of Truth has risen in Persia, and its effulgence is now  manifest here in America. This is the greatest proof of its appearance in  the horizon of the world, as recorded in the heavenly Books. Praise be to  God! That which is prophesied in the Holy Books has been fulfilled.    On Sunday last at Carnegie Hall the revered soul who introduced  'Abdu'l-Baha gave voice to the statement that according to tradition  demons would appear from the land of the sunrise, but now we find angels  appearing instead. At the time this statement was made a reply was not  possible, but today we will speak of it. The great spiritual lights have  always appeared in the East. The Blessed Perfection, Baha'u'llah, appeared  in the East. Jesus Christ dawned upon the horizon of the East. Moses,  Aaron, Joseph and all the Israelitish prophets such as Jeremiah, Ezekiel,  Isaiah and others appeared from the Orient. The lights of Muhammad and the  Bab shone from the East. The eastern horizon has been flooded with the  effulgence of these great lights, and only from the East have they risen  to shine upon the West. Now--praise be to God!--you are living in the dawn  of a cycle when the Sun of Truth is again shining forth from the East,  illumining all regions.    The world has become a new world. The darkness of night which has  enveloped humanity is passing. A new day has dawned. Divine  susceptibilities and heavenly capacities are developing in human souls  under the training of the Sun of Truth. The capacities of souls are  different. Their conditions are various. For example, certain minerals  come from the stony regions of the earth. All are minerals, all are  produced by the same sun, but one remains a stone while another develops  the capacity of a glittering gem or jewel. From one plot of land tulips  and hyacinths grow; from another, thorns and thistles. Each plot receives  the bounty of the sunshine, but the capacity to receive it is not the  same. Therefore, it is requisite that we must develop capacity and divine  susceptibility in order that the merciful bounty of the Sun of Truth  intended for this age and time in which we are living may reflect from us  as light from pure crystals.    The bounties of the Blessed Perfection are infinite. We must endeavor to  increase our capacity daily, to strengthen and enlarge our capabilities  for receiving them, to become as perfect mirrors. The more polished and  clean the mirror, the more effulgent is its reflection of the lights of  the Sun of Truth. Be like a well-cultivated garden wherein the roses and  variegated flowers of heaven are growing in fragrance and beauty. It is my  hope that your hearts may become as ready ground, carefully tilled and  prepared, upon which the divine showers of the bounties of the Blessed  Perfection may descend and the zephyrs of this divine springtime may blow  with quickening breath. Then will the garden of your hearts bring forth  its flowers of delightful fragrance to refresh the nostril of the heavenly  Gardener. Let your hearts reflect the glories of the Sun of Truth in their  many colors to gladden the eye of the divine Cultivator Who has nourished  them. Day by day become more closely attracted in order that the love of  God may illumine all those with whom you come in contact. Be as one  spirit, one soul, leaves of one tree, flowers of one garden, waves of one  ocean.    As difference in degree of capacity exists among human souls, as  difference in capability is found, therefore, individualities will differ  one from another. But in reality this is a reason for unity and not for  discord and enmity. If the flowers of a garden were all of one color, the  effect would be monotonous to the eye; but if the"]]]
