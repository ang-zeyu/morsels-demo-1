We need, indeed, to make allowance for the intense  animosity of sectarian strife among the various Catholic orders in which  the charges against the society were engendered and unrelentingly  prosecuted; but after all deductions it is not credible that the almost  universal odium in which it was held was provoked solely by its virtues.  Among the accusations against the society which seem most clearly  substantiated these two are likely to be concerned in that \"brand of  ultimate failure which has invariably been stamped on all its most  promising schemes and efforts\":[26:1] first, a disposition to compromise  the essential principles of Christianity by politic concessions to  heathenism, so that the successes of the Jesuit missions are magnified  by reports of alleged conversions that are conversions only in name and  outward form; second, a constantly besetting propensity to political  intrigue.[27:1] It is hardly to be doubted that both had their part in  the prodigious failure of the French Catholic missions and settlements  within the present boundaries of the United States.    4. The conditions which favored the swift and magnificent expansion of  the French occupation were unfavorable to the healthy natural growth of  permanent settlements. A post of soldiers, a group of cabins of trappers  and fur-traders, and a mission of nuns and celibate priests, all  together give small promise of rapid increase of population. It is  rather to the fact that the French settlements, except at the seaboard,  were constituted so largely of these elements, than to any alleged  sterility of the French stock, that the fatal weakness of the French  occupation is to be ascribed. The lack of French America was men. The  population of Canada in 1759, according to census, was about eighty-two  thousand;[27:2] that of New England in 1754 is estimated at four hundred  and twenty-five thousand. \"The white population of five, or perhaps even  of six, of the American provinces was greater singly than that of all  Canada, and the aggregate in America exceeded that in Canada  fourteenfold.\"[27:3] The same sign of weakness is recognized at the  other extremity of the cordon of French settlements. The vast region of  Louisiana is estimated, at fifty years from its colonization, at one  tenth of the strength of the coeval province of Pennsylvania.[27:4]    Under these hopeless conditions the French colonies had not even the  alternative of keeping the peace. The state of war was forced by the  mother countries. There was no recourse for Canada except to her savage  allies, won for her through the influence of the missionaries.    It is justly claimed that in the mind of such early leaders as Champlain  the dominant motive of the French colonization was religious; but in the  cruel position into which the colony was forced it was almost inevitable  that the missions should become political. It was boasted in their  behalf that they had taught the Indians \"to mingle Jesus Christ and  France together in their affections.\"[28:1] The cross and the lilies  were blazoned together as the sign of French dominion. The missionary  became frequently, and sometimes quite undisguisedly, a political agent.  It was from the missions that the horrible murderous forays upon  defenseless villages proceeded, which so often marked the frontier line  of New England and New York with fire and blood. It is one of the most  unhappy of the results of that savage warfare that in the minds of the  communities that suffered from it the Jesuit missionary came to be  looked upon as accessory to these abhorrent crimes. Deeply is it to be  lamented that men with such eminent claims on our admiration and  reverence should not be triumphantly clear of all suspicion of such  complicity. We gladly concede the claim[28:2] that the proof of the  complicity is not complete; we could welcome some clear evidence in  disproof of it--some sign of a bold and indignant protest against these  crimes; we could wish that the Jesuit historian had not boasted of these  atrocities as proceeding from the fine work of his brethren,[29:1] and  that the antecedents of the Jesuits as a body, and their declared  principles of \"moral theology,\" were such as raise no presumption  against them even in unfriendly minds. But we must be content with  thankfully acknowledging that divine change which has made it impossible  longer to boast of or even justify such deeds, and which leaves no  ground among neighbor Christians of the present day for harboring mutual  suspicions which, to the Christian ministers of French and English  America of two hundred years ago and less, it was impossible to repress.    I have spoken of the complete extinction within the present domain of  the United States of the magnificent beginnings of the projected French  Catholic Church and empire. It is only in the most recent years, since  the Civil War, that the results of the work inaugurated in America by  Champlain begin to reappear in the field of the ecclesiastical history  of the United States. The immigration of Canadian French Catholics into  the northern tier of States has already grown to considerable volume,  and is still growing in numbers and in stability and strength, and adds  a new and interesting element to the many factors that go to make up the  American church.

Its population may have been five thousand  whites and half that number of blacks. Louis XIV. had fostered it with  pride and liberal expenditures; an opulent merchant, famed for his  successful enterprise, assumed its direction; the Company of the  Mississippi, aided by boundless but transient credit, had made it the  foundation of their hopes; and, again, Fleury and Louis XV. had sought  to advance its fortunes. Priests and friars, dispersed through nations  from Biloxi to the Dahcotas, propitiated the favor of the savages; but  still the valley of the Mississippi was nearly a wilderness. All its  patrons--though among them it counted kings and ministers of state--had  not accomplished for it in half a century a tithe of the prosperity  which within the same period sprang naturally from the benevolence of  William Penn to the peaceful settlers on the Delaware\" (vol. iii., p.  369).

ANTECEDENTS OF PERMANENT CHRISTIAN COLONIZATION--THE DISINTEGRATION OF  CHRISTENDOM--CONTROVERSIES--PERSECUTIONS.      We have briefly reviewed the history of two magnificent schemes of  secular and spiritual empire, which, conceived in the minds of great  statesmen and churchmen, sustained by the resources of the mightiest  kingdoms of that age, inaugurated by soldiers of admirable prowess,  explorers of unsurpassed boldness and persistence, and missionaries  whose heroic faith has canonized them in the veneration of Christendom,  have nevertheless come to naught.    We turn now to observe the beginnings, coinciding in time with those of  the French enterprise, of a series of disconnected plantations along the  Atlantic seaboard, established as if at haphazard, without plan or  mutual preconcert, of different languages and widely diverse Christian  creeds, depending on scanty private resources, unsustained by  governmental arms or treasuries, but destined, in a course of events  which no human foresight could have calculated, to come under the  plastic influence of a single European power, to be molded according to  the general type of English polity, and to become heir to English  traditions, literature, and language. These mutually alien and even  antagonistic communities were to be constrained, by forces superior to  human control, first into confederation and then into union, and to  occupy the breadth of the new continent as a solid and independent  nation. The history reads like a fulfillment of the apocalyptic imagery  of a rock hewn from the mountain without hands, moving on to fill the  earth.    Looking back after the event, we find it easy to trace the providential  preparations for this great result. There were few important events in  the course of the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries that did not  have to do with it; but the most obvious of these antecedents are to be  found in _controversies_ and _persecutions_.    The protest of northern Europe against the abuses and corruptions  prevailing in the Roman Church was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2017"],[0,"Dhammapada, a Collection of Verses; Being One of the Canonical Books of the (#7)"],[1,"heedlessness have to  swallow the iron ball (in hell), and that thou mayest not cry out when  burning, `This is pain.'    372. Without knowledge there is no meditation, without meditation  there is no knowledge: he who has knowledge and meditation is near unto  Nirvana.    373. A Bhikshu who has entered his empty house, and whose mind is  tranquil, feels a more than human delight when he sees the law clearly.    374. As soon as he has considered the origin and destruction of the  elements (khandha) of the body, he finds happiness and joy which belong  to those who know the immortal (Nirvana).    375. And this is the beginning here for a wise Bhikshu: watchfulness  over the senses, contentedness, restraint under the law; keep noble  friends whose life is pure, and who are not slothful.    376. Let him live in charity, let him be perfect in his duties; then in  the fulness of delight he will make an end of suffering.    377. As the Vassika plant sheds its withered flowers, men should shed  passion and hatred, O ye Bhikshus!    378. The Bhikshu whose body and tongue and mind are quieted, who is  collected, and has rejected the baits of the world, he is called quiet.    379. Rouse thyself by thyself, examine thyself by thyself, thus  self-protected and attentive wilt thou live happily, O Bhikshu!    380. For self is the lord of self, self is the refuge of self; therefore  curb thyself as the merchant curbs a good horse.    381. The Bhikshu, full of delight, who is calm in the doctrine of Buddha  will reach the quiet place (Nirvana), cessation of natural desires, and  happiness.    382. He who, even as a young Bhikshu, applies himself to the doctrine of  Buddha, brightens up this world, like the moon when free from clouds.          Chapter XXVI. The Brahmana (Arhat)    383. Stop the stream valiantly, drive away the desires, O Brahmana!  When you have understood the destruction of all that was made, you will  understand that which was not made.    384. If the Brahmana has reached the other shore in both laws (in  restraint and contemplation), all bonds vanish from him who has obtained  knowledge.    385. He for whom there is neither this nor that shore, nor both, him,  the fearless and unshackled, I call indeed a Brahmana.    386. He who is thoughtful, blameless, settled, dutiful, without  passions, and who has attained the highest end, him I call indeed a  Brahmana.    387. The sun is bright by day, the moon shines by night, the warrior  is bright in his armour, the Brahmana is bright in his meditation; but  Buddha, the Awakened, is bright with splendour day and night.    388. Because a man is rid of evil, therefore he is called Brahmana;  because he walks quietly, therefore he is called Samana; because he  has sent away his own impurities, therefore he is called Pravragita  (Pabbagita, a pilgrim).    389. No one should attack a Brahmana, but no Brahmana (if attacked)  should let himself fly at his aggressor! Woe to him who strikes a  Brahmana, more woe to him who flies at his aggressor!    390. It advantages a Brahmana not a little if he holds his mind back  from the pleasures of life; when all wish to injure has vanished, pain  will cease.    391. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who does not offend by body, word, or  thought, and is controlled on these three points.    392. After a man has once understood the law as taught by the  Well-awakened (Buddha), let him worship it carefully, as the Brahmana  worships the sacrificial fire.    393. A man does not become a Brahmana by his platted hair, by his  family, or by birth; in whom there is truth and righteousness, he is  blessed, he is a Brahmana.    394. What is the use of platted hair, O fool! what of the raiment of  goat-skins? Within thee there is ravening, but the outside thou makest  clean.    395. The man who wears dirty raiments, who is emaciated and covered with  veins, who lives alone in the forest, and meditates, him I call indeed a  Brahmana.    396. I do not call a man a Brahmana because of his origin or of his  mother. He is indeed arrogant, and he is wealthy: but the poor, who is  free from all attachments, him I call indeed a Brahmana.    397. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who has cut all fetters, who never  trembles, is independent and unshackled.    398. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who has cut the strap and the thong,  the chain with all that pertains to it, who has burst the bar, and is  awakened.    399. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who, though he has committed no  offence, endures reproach, bonds, and stripes, who has endurance for his  force, and strength for his army.    400. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who is free from anger, dutiful,  virtuous, without appetite, who is subdued, and has received his last  body.    401. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who does not cling to pleasures, like  water on a lotus leaf, like a mustard seed on the point of a needle.    402. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who, even here, knows the end of his  suffering, has put down his burden, and is unshackled.    403. Him I call indeed a Brahmana whose knowledge is deep, who possesses  wisdom, who knows the right way and the wrong, and has attained the  highest end.    404. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who keeps aloof both from laymen and  from mendicants, who frequents no houses, and has but few desires.    405. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who finds no fault with other beings,  whether feeble or strong, and does not kill nor cause slaughter.    406. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who is tolerant with the intolerant,  mild with fault-finders, and free from passion among the passionate.    407. Him I call indeed a Brahmana from whom anger and hatred, pride and  envy have dropt like a mustard seed from the point of a needle.    408. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who utters true speech, instructive  and free from harshness, so that he offend no one.    409. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who takes nothing in the world that is  not given him, be it long or short, small or large, good or bad.    410. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who fosters no desires for this world  or for the next, has no inclinations, and is unshackled.    411. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who has no interests, and when he has  understood (the truth), does not say How, how? and who has reached the  depth of the Immortal.    412. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who in this world is above good and  evil, above the bondage of both, free from grief from sin, and from  impurity.    413. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who is bright like the moon, pure,  serene, undisturbed, and in whom all gaiety is extinct.    414. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who has traversed this miry road, the  impassable world and its vanity, who has gone through, and reached  the other shore, is thoughtful, guileless, free from doubts, free from  attachment, and content.    415. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who in this world, leaving all  desires, travels about without a home, and in whom all concupiscence is  extinct.    416. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who, leaving all longings, travels  about without a home, and in whom all covetousness is extinct.    417. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who, after leaving all bondage to men,  has risen above all bondage to the gods, and is free from all and every  bondage.    418. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who has left what gives pleasure and  what gives pain, who is cold, and free from all germs (of renewed life),  the hero who has conquered all the worlds.    419. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who knows the destruction and the  return of beings everywhere, who is free from bondage, welfaring  (Sugata), and awakened (Buddha).    420. Him I call indeed a Brahmana whose path the gods do not know, nor  spirits (Gandharvas), nor men, whose passions are extinct, and who is an  Arhat (venerable).    421. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who calls nothing his own, whether it  be before, behind, or between, who is poor, and free from the love of  the world.    422. Him I call indeed a Brahmana, the manly, the noble, the hero,  the great sage, the conqueror, the impassible, the accomplished, the  awakened.    423. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who knows his former abodes, who sees  heaven and hell, has reached the end of births, is perfect in knowledge,  a sage, and whose perfections are all perfect."]]]
