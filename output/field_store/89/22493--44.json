The remainder of the obverse is mutilated, but gave the names of Nebo  in Sumerian, and apparently also of Tasmetum, his consort. The  beginning of the reverse also is mutilated, but seems to have given  the names of the sun-god, Samas, and his consort, followed by those of  Kittu and Mesarum, \"justice and righteousness,\" his attendants.

Four non-Semitic names of Gula follow, of which that in line 31 is the  most interesting:--     31. Gasan-ti-dibba      Nin-tin-guua        Gula                \"the lady saving from death.\"   33.

Gasan-gu-edina      Nin-gu-edina                            (apparently the consort of Amurru).    In all probability this list is one of comparatively late date, though  its chronological position with regard to the others is wholly  uncertain--it may not be later, and may even be earlier, than those  beginning with Anu, the god of the heavens. The important thing about  it is, that it begins with /ilu/, god, in general, which is written,  in the standard dialect (that of the second column) with the same  character as that used for the name of Anu. After this comes Aa or Ea,  the god of the earth, and his consort, followed by En-lilla, the older  Bel--Illinos in Damascius. The name of Ea is repeated again in line 43  and following, where he is apparently re-introduced as the father of  Merodach, whose names immediately follow. This peculiarity is also  found in other lists of gods and is undoubtedly a reflection of the  history of the Babylonian religion. As this list replaces Anu by  /ilu/, it indicates the rule of Enki or Ea, followed by that of  Merodach, who, as has been shown, became the chief divinity of the  Babylonian pantheon in consequence of Babylon having become the  capital of the country.                                      CHAPTER IV             THE PRINCIPAL GODS OF THE BABYLONIANS AND ASSYRIANS                                       Anu.    The name of this divinity is derived from the Sumero-Akkadian /ana/,  \"heaven,\" of which he was the principal deity. He is called the father  of the great gods, though, in the creation-story, he seems to be  described as the son of Ansar and Kisar. In early names he is  described as the father, creator, and god, probably meaning the  supreme being. His consort was Anatu, and the pair are regarded in the  lists as the same as the Lahmu and Lahame of the creation-story, who,  with other deities, are also described as gods of the heavens. Anu was  worshipped at Erech, along with Istar.                                       Ea.    Is given as if it were the /Semitic/ equivalent of /Enki/, \"the lord  of the earth,\" but it would seem to be really a Sumerian word, later  written /Ae/, and certain inscriptions suggest that the true reading  was /Aa/. His titles are \"king of the Abyss, creator of everything,  lord of all,\" the first being seemingly due to the fact that Aa is a  word which may, in its reduplicate form, mean \"waters,\" or if read  /Ea/, \"house of water.\" He also, like Anu, is called \"father of the  gods.\" As this god was likewise \"lord of deep wisdom,\" it was to him  that his son Merodach went for advice whenever he was in doubt. On  account of his knowledge, he was the god of artisans in general--potters,  blacksmiths, sailors, builders, stone-cutters, gardeners,  seers, barbers, farmers, etc. This is the Aos (a form which confirms  the reading Aa) of Damascius, and the Oannes of the extracts from  Berosus, who states that he was \"a creature endowed with reason, with  a body like that of a fish, and under the fish's head another head,  with feet below, like those of a man, with a fish's tail.\" This  description applies fairly well to certain bas-reliefs from Nimroud in  the British Museum. The creature described by Berosus lived in the  Persian Gulf, landing during the day to teach the inhabitants the  building of houses and temples, the cultivation of useful plants, the  gathering of fruits, and also geometry, law, and letters. From him,  too, came the account of the beginning of things referred to in  chapter III. which, in the original Greek, is preceded by a  description of the composite monsters said to have existed before  Merodach assumed the rule of the universe.    The name of his consort, Damkina or Dawkina, probably means \"the  eternal spouse,\" and her other names, /Gasan-ki/ (Sumerian dialectic)  and /Nin-ki/ (non-dialectic), \"Lady of the earth,\" sufficiently  indicates her province. She is often mentioned in the incantations  with Ea.    The forsaking of the worship of Ea as chief god for that of Merodach  seems to have caused considerable heartburning in Babylonia, if we may  judge from the story of the Flood, for it was on account of his  faithfulness that Utnipistim, the Babylonian Noah, attained to  salvation from the Flood and immortality afterwards. All through this  adventure it was the god Ea who favoured him, and afterwards gave him  immortality like that of the gods. There is an interesting Sumerian  text in which the ship of Ea seems to be described, the woods of which  its various parts were formed being named, and in it, apparently, were  Enki (Ea), Damgal-nunna (Damkina), his consort, Asari-lu-duga  (Merodach), In-ab (or Ines), the pilot of Eridu (Ea's city), and  Nin-igi-nagar-sir, \"the great architect of heaven\":--      \"May the ship before thee bring fertility,    May the ship after thee bring joy,    In thy heart may it make joy of heart . . . .\"    Ea was the god of fertility, hence this ending to the poetical  description of the ship of Ea.                                       Bel.    The deity who is mentioned next in order in the list given above is  the \"older Bel,\" so called to distinguish him from Bel-Merodach. His  principal names were /Mullil/ (dialectic) or /En-lilla/[1] (standard  speech), the /Illinos/ of Damascius. His name is generally translated  \"lord of mist,\" so-called as god of the underworld, his consort being  /Gasan-lil/ or /Nan-lilla/, \"the lady of the mist,\" in Semitic  Babylonian /Beltu/, \"the Lady,\" par excellence. Bel, whose name means  \"the lord,\" was so called because he was regarded as chief of the  gods. As there was considerable confusion in consequence of the title  Bel having been given to Merodach, Tiglath-pileser I. (about 1200  B.C.) refers to him as the \"older Bel\" in describing the temple which  he built for him at Assur. Numerous names of men compounded with his  occur until the latest times, implying that, though the favourite god  was Merodach, the worship of Bel was not forgotten, even at Babylon--that  he should have been adored at his own city, Niffur, and at  Dur-Kuri-galzu, where Kuri-galzu I. built a temple for \"Bel, the lord of  the lands,\" was naturally to be expected. Being, like Ea, a god of the  earth, he is regarded as having formed a trinity with Anu, the god of  heaven, and Ea, the god of the deep, and prayer to these three was as  good as invoking all the gods of the universe. Classification of the  gods according to the domain of their power would naturally take place  in a religious system in which they were all identified with each  other, and this classification indicates, as Jastrow says, a deep  knowledge of the powers of nature, and a more than average  intelligence among the Babylonians--indeed, he holds it as a proof  that, at the period of the older empire, there were schools and  students who had devoted themselves to religious speculation upon this  point. He also conjectures that the third commandment of the Law of  Moses was directed against this doctrine held by the Babylonians.    [1] Ordinarily pronounced /Illila/, as certain glosses and Damascius's      /Illinos/ (for /Illilos/) show.                                     Beltis.    This goddess was properly only the spouse of the older Bel, but as  /Beltu/, her Babylonian name, simply meant \"lady\" in general (just as  /Bel/ or /belu/ meant \"lord\"), it became a title which could be given  to any goddess, and was in fact borne by Zer-panitum, Istar, Nanaa,  and others. It was therefore often needful to add the name of the city  over which the special /Beltu/ presided, in order to make clear which  of them was meant. Besides being the title of the spouse of the older  Bel, having her earthly seat with "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/207"],[0,"The Spell of the Yukon and Other Verses (#7)"],[1,"-- we're the men who had to pay.     We're the men who paid the blood-price.  Shall the grave be all our gain?      You owe us.  Long and heavy is the score.     Then cheer us for our glory now, and cheer us for our pain,      And cheer us as ye never cheered before.\"       The folks were white and stricken, and each tongue seemed weighted with lead;      Each heart was clutched in hollow hand of ice;     And every eye was staring at the horror of the dead,      The pity of the men who paid the price.     They were come, were come to mock us, in the first flush of our peace;      Through writhing lips their teeth were all agleam;     They were coming in their thousands -- oh, would they never cease!      I closed my eyes, and then -- it was a dream.       There was triumph, triumph, triumph down the scarlet gleaming street;      The town was mad; a man was like a boy.     A thousand flags were flaming where the sky and city meet;      A thousand bells were thundering the joy.     There was music, mirth and sunshine; but some eyes shone with regret;      And while we stun with cheers our homing braves,     O God, in Thy great mercy, let us nevermore forget      The graves they left behind, the bitter graves.          \"Fighting Mac\"       A Life Tragedy           A pistol shot rings round and round the world;      In pitiful defeat a warrior lies.     A last defiance to dark Death is hurled,      A last wild challenge shocks the sunlit skies.      Alone he falls, with wide, wan, woeful eyes:     Eyes that could smile at death -- could not face shame.       Alone, alone he paced his narrow room,      In the bright sunshine of that Paris day;     Saw in his thought the awful hand of doom;      Saw in his dream his glory pass away;      Tried in his heart, his weary heart, to pray:     \"O God! who made me, give me strength to face     The spectre of this bitter, black disgrace.\"            *    *    *    *    *       The burn brawls darkly down the shaggy glen;      The bee-kissed heather blooms around the door;     He sees himself a barefoot boy again,      Bending o'er page of legendary lore.      He hears the pibroch, grips the red claymore,     Runs with the Fiery Cross, a clansman true,     Sworn kinsman of Rob Roy and Roderick Dhu.       Eating his heart out with a wild desire,      One day, behind his counter trim and neat,     He hears a sound that sets his brain afire --      The Highlanders are marching down the street.      Oh, how the pipes shrill out, the mad drums beat!     \"On to the gates of Hell, my Gordons gay!\"     He flings his hated yardstick away.       He sees the sullen pass, high-crowned with snow,      Where Afghans cower with eyes of gleaming hate.     He hurls himself against the hidden foe.      They try to rally -- ah, too late, too late!      Again, defenseless, with fierce eyes that wait     For death, he stands, like baited bull at bay,     And flouts the Boers, that mad Majuba day.       He sees again the murderous Soudan,      Blood-slaked and rapine-swept.  He seems to stand     Upon the gory plain of Omdurman.      Then Magersfontein, and supreme command      Over his Highlanders.  To shake his hand     A King is proud, and princes call him friend.     And glory crowns his life -- and now the end,       The awful end.  His eyes are dark with doom;      He hears the shrapnel shrieking overhead;     He sees the ravaged ranks, the flame-stabbed gloom.      Oh, to have fallen! -- the battle-field his bed,      With Wauchope and his glorious brother-dead.     Why was he saved for this, for this?  And now     He raises the revolver to his brow.            *    *    *    *    *       In many a Highland home, framed with rude art,      You'll find his portrait, rough-hewn, stern and square;     It's graven in the Fuyam fellah's heart;      The Ghurka reads it at his evening prayer;      The raw lands know it, where the fierce suns glare;     The Dervish fears it.  Honor to his name     Who holds aloft the shield of England's fame.       Mourn for our hero, men of Northern race!      We do not know his sin; we only know     His sword was keen.  He laughed death in the face,      And struck, for Empire's sake, a giant blow.      His arm was strong.  Ah! well they learnt, the foe     The echo of his deeds is ringing yet --     Will ring for aye.  All else... let us forget.          The Woman and the Angel           An angel was tired of heaven, as he lounged in the golden street;     His halo was tilted sideways, and his harp lay mute at his feet;     So the Master stooped in His pity, and gave him a pass to go,     For the space of a moon, to the earth-world, to mix with the men below.       He doffed his celestial garments, scarce waiting to lay them straight;     He bade good by to Peter, who stood by the golden gate;     The sexless singers of heaven chanted a fond farewell,     And the imps looked up as they pattered on the red-hot flags of hell.       Never was seen such an angel -- eyes of heavenly blue,     Features that shamed Apollo, hair of a golden hue;     The women simply adored him; his lips were like Cupid's bow;     But he never ventured to use them -- and so they voted him slow.       Till at last there came One Woman, a marvel of loveliness,     And she whispered to him:  \"Do you love me?\"       And he answered that woman, \"Yes.\"     And she said:  \"Put your arms around me, and kiss me, and hold me -- so --\"     But fiercely he drew back, saying:  \"This thing is wrong, and I know.\"       Then sweetly she mocked his scruples, and softly she him beguiled:     \"You, who are verily man among men, speak with the tongue of a child.     We have outlived the old standards; we have burst, like an over-tight thong,     The ancient, outworn, Puritanic traditions of Right and Wrong.\"       Then the Master feared for His angel, and called him again to His side,     For oh, the woman was wondrous, and oh, the angel was tried!     And deep in his hell sang the Devil, and this was the strain of his song:     \"The ancient, outworn, Puritanic traditions of Right and Wrong.\"          The Rhyme of the Restless Ones           We couldn't sit and study for the law;      The stagnation of a bank we couldn't stand;     For our riot blood was surging, and we didn't need much urging      To excitements and excesses that are banned.     So we took to wine and drink and other things,      And the devil in us struggled to be free;     Till our friends rose up in wrath, and they pointed out the path,      And they paid our debts and packed us o'er the sea.       Oh, they shook us off and shipped us o'er the foam,     To the larger lands that lure a man to roam;      And we took the chance they gave      Of a far and foreign grave,     And we bade good-by for evermore to home.       And some of us are climbing on the peak,      And some of us are camping on the plain;     By pine and palm you'll find us, with never claim to bind us,      By track and trail you'll meet us once again.       We are the fated serfs to freedom -- sky and sea;      We have failed where slummy cities overflow;     But the stranger ways of earth know our pride and know our worth,      And we go into the dark as fighters go.       Yes, we go into the night as brave men go,     Though our faces they be often streaked with woe;      Yet we're hard as cats to kill,      And our hearts are reckless still,     And we've danced with death a dozen times or so.       And you'll find us in Alaska after gold,      And you'll find us herding cattle in the South.     We like strong drink and fun, and, when the race is run,      We often die with curses in our mouth.     We are wild as colts unbroke, but never mean.      Of our sins we've shoulders broad to bear the blame;     But we'll never stay in town and we'll never settle down,      And we'll never have an object or an aim.       No, there's that in us that time can never tame;     And life will always seem a careless game;      And they'd better far forget --      Those who say they love us yet --     Forget, blot out with bitterness our name.          New Year's Eve           It's cruel cold on the water-front, silent and dark and drear;      Only the black tide weltering, only the hissing snow;     And I, alone, like a storm-tossed wreck, on this night of the glad New Year,      Shuffling along in the icy wind, ghastly and gaunt and slow.       They're playing a tune in McGuffy's saloon,       and it's cheery and bright in there      (God! but I'm weak -- since the bitter dawn, and never a bite of food);     I'll just go over and slip inside -- I mustn't give way to despair --      Perhaps I can bum a little booze if the boys are feeling good.       They'll jeer at me, and they'll sneer at me,       and they'll call me a whiskey soak;      (\"Have a drink?  Well, thankee kindly, sir, I don't mind if I do.\")     A drivelling, dirty, gin-joint fiend, the butt of the bar-room joke;      Sunk and sodden and hopeless -- \"Another?  Well, here's to you!\"       McGuffy is showing a bunch of the boys how Bob Fitzsimmons hit;      The barman is talking of Tammany Hall, and why the ward boss got fired.     I'll just sneak into a corner and they'll let me alone a bit;      The room is reeling round and round...        O God! but I'm tired, I'm tired....            *    *    *    *    *       Roses she wore on her breast that night.  Oh, but their scent was sweet!      Alone we sat on the balcony, and the fan-palms arched above;     The witching strain of a waltz by Strauss came up to our cool retreat,      And I prisoned her little hand in mine, and I whispered my plea of love.       Then sudden the laughter died on her lips, and lowly she bent her head;      And oh, there came in the deep, dark eyes a look that was heaven to see;     And the moments went, and I waited there, and never a word was said,      And she plucked from her bosom a rose of red and shyly gave it to me.       Then "]]]
