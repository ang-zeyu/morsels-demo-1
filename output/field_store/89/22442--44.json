And who cannot excuse the honest pride of the       old man--the stout old man?    In the interval the war had ended, and Napoleon had departed for St.  Helena. Peace had led to the pensioning of militia officers, or reducing  to half-pay of the juniors. The elder Borrow had settled in Norwich.  George was set to study at the Grammar School there, while his brother  worked in Old Crome's studio, for here was a moment when Norwich had its  interesting Renaissance, and John Borrow was bent on being an artist. He  had worked with Crome once before--during the brief interval that  Napoleon was at Elba--but now he set to in real earnest, and we have  evidence of a score of pictures by him that were catalogued In the  exhibitions of the Norwich Society of Artists between the years 1817 and  1824. They include one portrait of the artist's father, and two of his  brother George.[15] Old Crome died in 1821, and then John went to London  to study under Haydon. Borrow declares that his brother had real taste  for painting, and that 'if circumstances had not eventually diverted his  mind from the pursuit, he would have attained excellence, and left  behind him some enduring monument of his powers,' 'He lacked, however,'  he tells us, 'one thing, the want of which is but too often fatal to the  sons of genius, and without which genius is little more than a splendid  toy in the hands of the possessor--perseverance, dogged perseverance.'  It is when he is thus commenting on his brother's characteristics that  Borrow gives his own fine if narrow eulogy of Old Crome. John Borrow  seems to have continued his studies in London under Haydon for a year,  and then to have gone to Paris to copy pictures at the Louvre. He  mentions a particular copy that he made of a celebrated picture by one  of the Italian masters, for which a Hungarian nobleman paid him well.  His three years' absence was brought to an abrupt termination by news of  his father's illness. He returned to Norwich in time to stand by that  father's bedside when he died. The elder Borrow died, as we have seen,  in February 1824. The little home in King's Court was kept on for the  mother, and as John was making money by his pictures it was understood  that he should stay with her. On the 1st April, however, George started  for London, carrying the manuscript of _Romantic Ballads from the  Danish_ to Sir Richard Phillips, the publisher. On the 29th of the same  month he was joined by his brother John. John had come to London at his  own expense, but in the interests of the Norwich Town Council. The  council wanted a portrait of one of its mayors for St. Andrew's  Hall--that Valhalla of Norwich municipal worthies which still strikes  the stranger as well-nigh unique in the city life of England. The  municipality would fain have encouraged a fellow-citizen, and John  Borrow had been invited to paint the portrait. 'Why,' it was asked,  'should the money go into a stranger's pocket and be spent in London?'  John, however, felt diffident of his ability and declined, and this in  spite of the fact that the L100 offered for the portrait must have been  very tempting. 'What a pity it was,' he said, 'that Crome was dead.'  'Crome,' said the orator of the deputation that had called on John  Borrow,         'Crome; yes, he was a clever man, a very clever man, in his       way; he was good at painting landscapes and farm-houses, but he       would not do in the present instance, were he alive. He had no       conception of the heroic, sir. We want some person capable of       representing our mayor standing under the Norman arch of the       cathedral.'[16]    At the mention of the heroic John bethought himself of Haydon, and  suggested his name; hence his visit to London, and his proposed  interview with Haydon. The two brothers went together to call upon the  'painter of the heroic' at his studio in Connaught Terrace, Hyde Park.  There was some difficulty about their admission, and it turned out  afterwards that Haydon thought they might be duns, as he was very hard  up at the time. His eyes glistened at the mention of the L100. 'I am not  very fond of painting portraits,' he said, 'but a mayor is a mayor, and  there is something grand in that idea of the Norman arch.' And thus  Mayor Hawkes came to be painted by Benjamin Haydon, and his portrait may  be found, not without diligent search, among the many municipal worthies  that figure on the walls of that most picturesque old Hall in Norwich.  Here is Borrow's description of the painting:         The original mayor was a mighty, portly man, with a bull's       head, black hair, body like that of a dray horse, and legs and       thighs corresponding; a man six foot high at the least. To his       bull's head, black hair, and body the painter had done justice;       there was one point, however, in which the portrait did not       correspond with the original--the legs were disproportionably       short, the painter having substituted his own legs for those of       the mayor.    John Borrow described Robert Hawkes to his brother as a person of many  qualifications:         --big and portly, with a voice like Boanerges; a religious man,       the possessor of an immense pew; loyal, so much so that I once       heard him say that he would at any time go three miles to hear       any one sing 'God save the King'; moreover, a giver of       excellent dinners. Such is our present mayor, who, owing to       his loyalty, his religion, and a little, perhaps, to his       dinners, is a mighty favourite.    Haydon, who makes no mention of the Borrows in his _Correspondence_ or  _Autobiography_, although there is one letter of George Borrow's to him  in the latter work, had been in jail for debt three years prior to the  visit of the Borrows. He was then at work on his greatest success in  'the heroic'--_The Raising of Lazarus_, a canvas nineteen feet long by  fifteen high. The debt was one to house decorators, for the artist had  ever large ideas. The bailiff, he tells us,[17] was so agitated at the  sight of the painting of Lazarus in the studio that he cried out, 'Oh,  my God! Sir, I won't arrest you. Give me your word to meet me at twelve  at the attorney's, and I'll take it.' In 1821 Haydon married, and a  little later we find him again 'without a single shilling in the  world--with a large picture before me not half done.' In April 1822 he  is arrested at the instance of his colourman, 'with whom I had dealt for  fifteen years,' and in November of the same year he is arrested again at  the instance of 'a miserable apothecary.' In April 1823 we find him in  the King's Bench Prison, from which he was released in July. _The  Raising of Lazarus_ meanwhile had gone to pay his upholsterer L300, and  his _Christ's Entry into Jerusalem_ had been sold for L240, although it  had brought him L3000 in receipts at exhibitions. Clearly heroic  pictures did not pay, and Haydon here took up 'the torment of  portrait-painting' as he called it.    [Illustration: ROBERT HAWKES, MAYOR OF NORWICH IN 1824    From the painting by Benjamin Haydon in St. Andrew's Hall, Norwich. This  portrait has its association with Borrow in that his brother John was  sent to London to request Haydon to paint it, and Borrow describes the  picture in _Lavengro_.]         'Can you wonder,' he wrote in July 1825, 'that I nauseate       portraits, except portraits of clever people. I feel quite       convinced that every portrait-painter, if there be purgatory,       will leap at once to heaven, without this previous       purification.'    Perhaps it was Mayor Hawkes who helped to inspire this feeling.[18] Yet  the hundred pounds that John Borrow was able to procure must have been a  godsend, for shortly before this we find him writing in his diary of the  desperation that caused him to sell his books. 'Books that had cost me  L20 I got only L3 for. But it was better than starvation.' Indeed it was  in April of this year that the very baker was 'insolent,' and so in May  1824, as we learn from Tom Taylor's _Life_, he produced 'a full-length  portrait of Mr. Hawkes, a late Mayor of Norwich, painted for St.  Andrew's Hall in that city.' But I must leave Haydon's troubled career,  which closes so far as the two brothers are concerned with a letter from  George to Haydon written the following year from 26 Bryanston Street,  Portman Square:         DEAR SIR,--I should feel extremely obliged if you would allow       me to sit to you as soon as possible. I am going to the south       of France in little better than a fortnight, and I would sooner       lose a thousand pounds than not have the honour of appearing in       the picture.--Yours sincerely,                    GEORGE BORROW.[19]    As Borrow was at the time in a most impoverished condition, it is not  easy to believe that he would have wished to be taken at his word. He  certainly had not a thousand pounds to lose. But he did undoubtedly, as  we shall see, take that journey on foot through the south of France,  after the manner of an earlier vagabond of literature--Oliver Goldsmith.  Haydon was to be far too much taken up with his own troubles during the  coming months to think any more about the Borrows when he had once  completed the portrait of the mayor, which he had done by July of this  year. Borrow's letter to him is, however, an obvious outcome of a remark  dropped by the painter on the occasion of his one visit to his studio  when the following conversation took place:         'I'll stick to the heroic,' said the painter; 'I now and then       dabble in the comic, but what I do gives me no pleasure, the       comic is so low; there is nothing like the heroic. I am"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1980"],[0,"Stories (#7)"],[1,"ation; and we very nearly all drank hard, and  those who didn't drink hard took more than was good for them.    I don't know exactly what induced me to go out there. I was young  for one thing, the country was unknown, the berth was vacant, and the  conditions of it easy.    Imagine a high rocky point or headland, stretching out sideways into  the sea, and at its base a small river winding into a country that  was seemingly a blank in regard to inhabitants or cultivation; a land  continuing for miles and miles, as far as the eye could see, one expanse  of long yellow grass, dotted here and there with groups of bastard  palms. In front of the headland rolled the lonely South Atlantic; and,  as if such conditions were not dispiriting enough to existence upon the  Point, there was yet another feature which at times gave the place a  still more ghastly look. A long way off the shore, the heaving surface  of the ocean began, in anything like bad weather, to break upon the  shoals of the coast. Viewed from the top of the rock, the sea at such  times looked, for at least two miles out, as if it were scored over with  lines of white foam; but lower down, near the beach, each roller could  be distinctly seen, and each roller had a curve of many feet, and was an  enormous mass of water that hurled itself shoreward until it curled and  broke.    When I first arrived on the Point there was, I may say, only one house  upon it, and that belonged to Messrs. Flint Brothers, of Liverpool. It  was occupied by one solitary man named Jackson; he had had an assistant,  but the assistant had died of fever, and I was sent to replace him.  Jackson was a man of fifty at least, who had been a sailor before he  had become an African trader. His face bore testimony to the winds  and weather it had encountered, and wore habitually a grave, if not  melancholy, expression. He was rough but kind to me, and though strict  was just, which was no common feature in an old African hand to one who  had just arrived on the coast.    He kept the factory--we called all houses on the coast factories--as  neat and clean as if it had been a ship. He had the floor of the portion  we dwelt in holystoned every week; and numberless little racks and  shelves were fitted up all over the house. The outside walls glittered  with paint, and the yard was swept clean every morning; and every  Sunday, at eight o'clock and sunset, the ensign was hoisted and lowered,  and an old cannon fired at the word of command. Order and rule were with  Jackson observed from habit, and were strictly enforced by him on all  the natives employed in the factory.    Although I have said the country looked as if uninhabited, there were  numerous villages hidden away in the long grass and brushwood, invisible  at a distance, being huts of thatch or mud, and not so high as the  grass among which they were placed. From these villages came most of our  servants, and also the middlemen, who acted as brokers between us, the  white men, and the negroes who brought ivory and gum and india-rubber  from the far interior for sale. Our trade was principally in ivory,  and when an unusually large number of elephants' tusks arrived upon the  Point for sale, it would be crowded with Bushmen, strange and uncouth,  and hideously ugly, and armed, and then we would be very busy; for  sometimes as many as two hundred tusks would be brought to us at the  same time, and each of these had to be bargained for and paid for by  exchange of cotton cloths, guns, knives, powder, and a host of small  wares.    For some time after my arrival our factory, along with the others on  the coast belonging to Messrs. Flint Brothers, was very well supplied  by them with goods for the trade; but by degrees their shipments became  less frequent, and small when they did come. In spite of repeated  letters we could gain no reason from the firm for this fact, nor could  the other factories, and gradually we found ourselves with an empty  storehouse, and nearly all our goods gone. Then followed a weary  interval, during which we had nothing whatever to do, and day succeeded  day through the long hot season. It was now that I began to feel that  Jackson had become of late more silent and reserved with me than ever  he had been. I noticed, too, that he had contracted a habit of wandering  out to the extreme end of the Point, where he would sit for hours gazing  upon the ocean before him. In addition to this, he grew morose and  uncertain in his temper toward the natives, and sometimes he would fall  asleep in the evenings on a sofa, and talk to himself at such a rate  while asleep that I would grow frightened and wake him, when he would  stare about him for a little until he gathered consciousness, and then  he would stagger off to bed to fall asleep again almost immediately.  Also, his hands trembled much, and he began to lose flesh. All this  troubled me, for his own sake as well as my own, and I resolved to ask  him to see the doctor of the next mail-steamer that came. With this  idea I went one day to the end of the Point, and found him in his usual  attitude, seated on the long grass, looking seaward. He did not hear me  approach, and when I spoke he started to his feet, and demanded fiercely  why I disturbed him. I replied, as mildly as I could, for I was rather  afraid of the glittering look that was in his eyes, that I wished to ask  him if he did not feel ill.    He regarded me with a steady but softened glance for a little, and then  said:    \"My lad, I thank you for your trouble; but I want no doctor. Do you  think I'm looking ill?\"    \"Indeed you are,\" I answered, \"ill and thin; and, do you know, I hear  you talk to yourself in your sleep nearly every night.\"    \"What do I say?\" he asked eagerly.    \"That I cannot tell,\" I replied. \"It is all rambling talk; the same  things over and over again, and nearly all about one person--Lucy.\"    \"Boy!\" he cried out, as if in pain, or as if something had touched him  to the quick, \"sit you down, and I'll tell you why I think of her--she  was my wife.\"    He moved nearer to the edge of the cliff, and we sat down, almost over  the restless sea beneath us.    \"She lives in my memory,\" he continued, speaking more to himself than  to me, and looking far out to the horizon, beneath which the setting  sun had begun to sink, \"in spite of all I can do or think of to make  her appear base in my eyes. For she left me to go with another man--a  scoundrel. This was how it was,\" he added, quickly: \"I married her, and  thought her as pure as a flower; but I could not take her to sea with  me because I was only the mate of a vessel, so I left her among her  own friends, in the village where she was born. In a little cottage by  herself I settled her, comfortable and happy as I thought. God! how  she hung round my neck and sobbed when I went away the first time!  and yet--yet--within a year she left me.\" And he stopped for several  minutes, resting his head upon his hands. \"At first I could get no trace  of her,\" he resumed. \"Her friends knew nothing more of her than that  she had left the village suddenly. Gradually I found out the name of the  scoundrel who had seduced her away. He had bribed her friends so that  they were silent; but I overbribed them with the last money I had, and  I followed him and my wife on foot. I never found them, nor did I ever  know why she had deserted me for him. If I had only known the reason; if  I could have been told of my fault; if she had only written to say that  she was tired of me; that I was too old, too rough for her soft ways,--I  think I could have borne the heavy stroke the villain had dealt me  better. The end of my search was that I dropped down in the streets of  Liverpool, whither I thought I had tracked them, and was carried to  the hospital with brain-fever upon me. Two months afterward I came out  cured, and the sense of my loss was deadened within me, so that I  could go to sea again, which I did, before the mast, under the name of  Jackson, in a bark that traded to this coast here.\" And the old sailor  rose to his feet and turned abruptly away, leaving me sitting alone.    I saw that he did not wish to be followed, so I stayed where I was and  watched the gray twilight creep over the face of the sea, and the night  quickly succeed to it. Not a cloud had been in the sky all day long, and  as the darkness increased the stars came out, until the whole heavens  were studded with glittering gems.    Suddenly, low down, close to the sea, a point of light flickered and  disappeared, shone again for a moment, wavered and went out, only to  reappear and shine steadily. \"A steamer's masthead light,\" I thought,  and ran to the house to give the news; but Jackson had already seen  the light, and pronounced that she had anchored until the morning. At  daybreak there she was, dipping her sides to the swell of the sea as  it rolled beneath her. It was my duty to go off to her in one of the  surf-boats belonging to the factory; and so I scrambled down the cliff  to the little strip of smooth beach that served us for a landing-place.    When I arrived there I found that the white-crested breakers were  heavier than I had thought they would be. However, there was the boat  lying on the beach with its prow toward the waves, and round it were the  boat-boys with their loincloths girded, ready to start; so I clambered  into the stern, or rather--for the boat was shaped alike at stem and  stern--the end from which the steersman, or _patrao_, used his long oar.  With a shout the boys laid hold of the sides of the boat, and the next  moment it was dancing on the spent waves next to the beach. The patrao  kept its head steady, and the boys jumped in and seized the oars, and  began pulling with a will, standing up to their stroke. Slowly the  heavy craft gathered way, and approached a dark and unbroken roller that  hastened toward the beach. Then the patrao shouted"]]]
