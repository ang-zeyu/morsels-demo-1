[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17408"],[0,"The Florentine Painters of the Renaissance (#7)"],[1," in landscape by Baldovinetti,  Pollaiuolo, and Verrocchio--that the great advances of this generation  of Florentine painters were made.      VIII.    [Page heading: REPRESENTATION OF MOVEMENT]    Turning our attention first to movement--which, by the way, is not the  same as motion, mere change of place--we find that we realise it just as  we realise objects, by the stimulation of our tactile imagination, only  that here touch retires to a second place before the muscular feelings  of varying pressure and strain. I see (to take an example) two men  wrestling, but unless my retinal impressions are immediately translated  into images of strain and pressure in my muscles, of resistance to my  weight, of touch all over my body, it means nothing to me in terms of  vivid experience--not more, perhaps, than if I heard some one say \"Two  men are wrestling.\" Although a wrestling match may, in fact, contain  many genuinely artistic elements, our enjoyment of it can never be quite  artistic; we are prevented from completely realising it not only by our  dramatic interest in the game, but also, granting the possibility of  being devoid of dramatic interest, by the succession of movements being  too rapid for us to realise each completely, and too fatiguing, even if  realisable. Now if a way could be found of conveying to us the  realisation of movement without the confusion and the fatigue of the  actuality, we should be getting out of the wrestlers more than they  themselves can give us--the heightening of vitality which comes to us  whenever we keenly realise life, such as the actuality itself would give  us, _plus_ the greater effectiveness of the heightening brought about by  the clearer, intenser, and less fatiguing realisation. This is precisely  what the artist who succeeds in representing movement achieves: making  us realise it as we never can actually, he gives us a heightened sense  of capacity, and whatever is in the actuality enjoyable, he allows us to  enjoy at our leisure. In words already familiar to us, he _extracts the  significance of movements_, just as, in rendering tactile values, the  artist extracts the corporeal significance of objects. His task is,  however, far more difficult, although less indispensable:--it is not  enough that he should extract the values of what at any given moment is  an actuality, as is an object, but what at no moment really is--namely  movement. He can accomplish his task in only one way, and that is by so  rendering the one particular movement that we shall be able to realise  all other movements that the same figure may make. \"He is grappling with  his enemy now,\" I say of my wrestler. \"What a pleasure to be able to  realise in my own muscles, on my own chest, with my own arms and legs,  the life that is in him as he is making his supreme effort! What a  pleasure, as I look away from the representation, to realise in the same  manner, how after the contest his muscles will relax, and rest trickle  like a refreshing stream through his nerves!\" All this I shall be made  to enjoy by the artist who, in representing any one movement, can give  me the logical sequence of visible strain and pressure in the parts and  muscles.    It is just here that the scientific spirit of the Florentine naturalists  was of immense service to art. This logic of sequence is to be attained  only by great, although not necessarily more than empiric, knowledge of  anatomy, such perhaps as the artist pure would never be inclined to work  out for himself, but just such as would be of absorbing interest to  those scientists by temperament and artists by profession whom we have  in Pollaiuolo and, to a less extent, in Verrocchio. We remember how  Giotto contrived to render tactile values. Of all the possible outlines,  of all the possible variations of light and shade that a figure may  have, he selected those that we must isolate for special attention when  we are actually realising it. If instead of figure, we say figure in  movement, the same statement applies to the way Pollaiuolo rendered  movement--with this difference, however, that he had to render what in  actuality we never can perfectly isolate, the line and light and shade  most significant of any given action. This the artist must construct  himself out of his dramatic feeling for pressure and strain and his  ability to articulate the figure in all its logical sequences, for, if  he would convey a sense of movement, he must give the line and the  light and shade which will best render not tactile values alone, but the  sequences of articulations.    [Page heading: \"BATTLE OF THE NUDES\"]    It would be difficult to find more effective illustration of all that  has just been said about movement than one or two of Pollaiuolo's own  works, which, in contrast to most of his achievements, where little more  than effort and research are visible, are really masterpieces of  life-communicating art. Let us look first at his engraving known as the  \"Battle of the Nudes.\" What is it that makes us return to this sheet  with ever renewed, ever increased pleasure? Surely it is not the hideous  faces of most of the figures and their scarcely less hideous bodies. Nor  is it the pattern as decorative design, which is of great beauty indeed,  but not at all in proportion to the spell exerted upon us. Least of all  is it--for most of us--an interest in the technique or history of  engraving. No, the pleasure we take in these savagely battling forms  arises from their power to directly communicate life, to immensely  heighten our sense of vitality. Look at the combatant prostrate on the  ground and his assailant bending over, each intent on stabbing the  other. See how the prostrate man plants his foot on the thigh of his  enemy, and note the tremendous energy he exerts to keep off the foe,  who, turning as upon a pivot, with his grip on the other's head, exerts  no less force to keep the advantage gained. The significance of all  these muscular strains and pressures is so rendered that we cannot help  realising them; we imagine ourselves imitating all the movements, and  exerting the force required for them--and all without the least effort  on our side. If all this without moving a muscle, what should we feel if  we too had exerted ourselves! And thus while under the spell of this  illusion--this hyperaesthesia not bought with drugs, and not paid for  with cheques drawn on our vitality--we feel as if the elixir of life,  not our own sluggish blood, were coursing through our veins.    [Page heading: \"HERCULES STRANGLING DAVID\"]    Let us look now at an even greater triumph of movement than the Nudes,  Pollaiuolo's \"Hercules Strangling Antaeus.\" As you realise the suction of  Hercules' grip on the earth, the swelling of his calves with the pressure  that falls on them, the violent throwing back of his chest, the stifling  force of his embrace; as you realise the supreme effort of Antaeus, with  one hand crushing down upon the head and the other tearing at the arm of  Hercules, you feel as if a fountain of energy had sprung up under your  feet and were playing through your veins. I cannot refrain from  mentioning still another masterpiece, this time not only of movement, but  of tactile values and personal beauty as well--Pollaiuolo's \"David\" at  Berlin. The young warrior has sped his stone, cut off the giant's head,  and now he strides over it, his graceful, slender figure still vibrating  with the rapidity of his triumph, expectant, as if fearing the ease of  it. What lightness, what buoyancy we feel as we realise the movement of  this wonderful youth!      IX.    [Page heading: VERROCCHIO AND LANDSCAPE]    In all that concerns movement, Verrocchio was a learner from Pollaiuolo,  rather than an initiator, and he probably never attained his master's  proficiency. We have unfortunately but few terms for comparison, as the  only paintings which can be with certainty ascribed to Verrocchio are  not pictures of action. A drawing however like that of his angel, in the  British Museum, which attempts as much movement as the Hercules by  Pollaiuolo, in the same collection, is of obviously inferior quality.  Yet in sculpture, along with works which are valuable as harbingers of  Leonardo rather than for any intrinsic perfection, he created two such  masterpieces of movement as the \"Child with the Dolphin\" in the  courtyard of the Palazzo Vecchio, and the Colleoni monument at  Venice--the latter sinning, if at all, by an over-exuberance of  movement, by a step and swing too suggestive of drums and trumpets. But  in landscape Verrocchio was a decided innovator. To understand what new  elements he introduced, we must at this point carry out our  determination to enquire into the source of our pleasure in landscape  painting; or rather--to avoid a subject of vast extent for which this is  not the place--of landscape painting as practised by the Florentines.    [Page heading: LANDSCAPE PAINTING]    Before Verrocchio, his precursors, first Alessio Baldovinetti and then  Pollaiuolo, had attempted to treat landscape as naturalistically as  painting would permit. Their ideal was to note it down with absolute  correctness from a given point of view; their subject almost invariably  the Valdarno; their achievement, a bird's-eye view of this Tuscan  paradise. Nor can it be denied that this gives pleasure, but the  pleasure is only such as is conveyed by tactile values. Instead of  having the difficulty we should have in nature to distinguish clearly  points near the horizon's edge, we here see them perfectly and without  an effort, and in consequence feel great confirmation of capacity for  life. Now if landscape were, as most people vaguely believe, a pleasure  coming through the eyes alone, then the Pollaiuolesque treatment could  be equalled by none that has followed, and surpassed only by Rogier van  der Weyden, or by the quaint German \"Master of the Lyversberg Passion,\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17412"],[0,"The Bobbsey Twins (#7)"],[1," a  real battle.\"    \"Only the band didn't play,\" put in Freddie disappointedly. \"Real  soldiers have a band. They don't play fish-horns.\"    \"Oh, Freddie!\" cried Flossie. \"They weren't fish-horns. They were  Christmas horns.\"    \"It's all the same. I like a band, with a big, fat bass-drum.\"    \"We'll have the band next time--just for your benefit, Freddie,\" said  Bert.    He was tired out and glad to rest when they got home. More than this,  some of the snow had gotten down his back, so he had to dry himself by  sitting with his back to the sitting-room heater.    \"Danny Rugg was terribly angry that we captured the fort,\" said he. \"He  is looking for the boys who threw him on his face.\"    \"It served him right,\" answered Nan, remembering the trouble over the  broken show window.    The second fall of snow was followed by steady cold weather and it was  not long before the greater part of Lake Metoka was frozen over. As soon  as this happened nearly all of the boys and girls took to skating, so  that sledding and snowballing were, for the time being, forgotten.    Both Nan and Bert had new skates, given to them the Christmas before,  and each was impatient to go on the ice, but Mrs. Bobbsey held them back  until she thought it would be safe.    \"You must not go too far from shore,\" said she. \"I understand the ice in  the middle of the lake, and at the lower end, is not as firm as it might  be.\"    Freddie and Flossie wanted to watch the skating, and Nan took them to  their father's lumber yard. Here was a small office directly on the lake  front, where they could see much that was going on and still be under  the care of an old workman around the yards.    Nan could not skate very well, but Bert could get along nicely, and he  took hold of his twin sister's hand, and away they went gliding over the  smooth ice much to their combined delight.    \"Some day I am going to learn how to do fancy skating,\" said Bert. \"The  Dutch roll, and spread the eagle, and all that.\"    \"There is Mr. Gifford,\" said Nan. \"Let us watch him.\"    The gentleman mentioned was a fine skater and had once won a medal for  making fancy figures on the ice. They watched him for a long while and  so did many of the others present.    \"It's beautiful to skate like that,\" cried Nan, when they skated away.  \"It's just like knowing how to dance everything.\"    \"Only better,\" said Bert, who did not care for dancing at all.    Presently Nan found some girls to skate with and then Bert went off  among the boys. The girls played tag and had great fun, shrieking at the  top of their lungs as first one was \"it\" and then another. It was hard  work for Nan to catch the older girls, who could skate better, but easy  enough to catch those of her own age and experience on the ice.    The boys played tag, too, and \"snapped the whip,\" as it is termed. All  of the boys would join hands in a long line and then skate off as fast  as they could. Then the boy on one end, called the snapper, would stop  and pull the others around in a big curve. This would make the boys on  the end of the line skate very fast, and sometimes they would go down,  to roll over and over on the ice. Once Bert was at the end and down he  went, to slide a long distance, when he bumped into a gentleman who was  skating backwards and over went the man with a crash that could be heard  a long distance off.    \"Hi! you young rascal!\" roared the man, trying to scramble up. \"What do  you mean by bowling me over like that?\"    \"Excuse me, but I didn't mean to do it,\" answered Bert, and lost no time  in getting out of the gentleman's way. The gentleman was very angry and  left the ice, grumbling loudly to himself.    Down near the lower end of Mr. Bobbsey's lumber yard some young men were  building an ice-boat. Bert and Charley Mason watched this work with  interest. \"Let us make an ice-boat,\" said Charley. \"I can get an old  bed-sheet for a sail, if you will get your father to give you the  lumber.\"    \"I'll try,\" answered Bert, and it was agreed that the ice-boat should be  built during the following week, after school.          CHAPTER IX    FREDDIE LOSES HIMSELF      Christmas was now but four weeks away, and the stores of Lakeport had  their windows filled with all sort of nice things for presents. Nan and  Bert had gazed into the windows a number of times, and even walked  through the one big department store of which the town boasted, and they  had told Freddie and Flossie of many of the things to be seen.    \"Oh, I want to see them, too!\" cried Flossie, and begged her mother to  take her along the next time she went out.    \"I want to go, too,\" put in Freddie. \"Bert says there are _sixteen_  rocking horses all in a row, with white and black tails. I want to see  them.\"    \"I am going to the stores to-morrow,\" answered Mrs. Bobbsey. \"You can go  with me, after school. It will be better to go now than later on, when  the places are filled with Christmas shoppers.\"    The twins were in high glee, and Freddie said he was going to spend the  twenty-five cents he had been saving up for several months.    \"Let us buy mamma something for Christmas,\" said Flossie, who had the  same amount of money.    \"What shall we buy?\"    That question was a puzzling one. Flossie thought a nice doll would be  the right thing, while Freddie thought an automobile that could be wound  up and made to run around the floor would be better. At last both  consulted Nan.    \"Oh, mamma doesn't want a doll,\" said Nan. \"And she ought to have a real  automobile, not a tin one.\"    \"Can't buy a real auto'bile,\" said Freddie. \"Real auto'biles cost ten  dollars, or more.\"    \"I'll tell you what to do,\" went on Nan. \"You buy her a little bottle of  cologne, Freddie, and you, Flossie, can buy her a nice handkerchief.\"    \"I'll buy her a big bottle of cologne,\" said Freddie. \"That big!\" and  he placed his hands about a foot apart.    \"And I'll get a real lace handkerchief,\" added Flossie.    \"You'll have to do the best you can,\" said practical Nan, and so it was  agreed.    When they left home each child had the money tucked away in a pocket.  They went in the family sleigh, with Sam as a driver. The first stop was  at Mr. Ringley's shoe store, where Mrs. Bobbsey purchased each of the  twins a pair of shoes. It may be added here, that the broken window  glass had long since been replaced by the shoe dealer, and his show  window looked as attractive as ever.    \"I heard you had a window broken not long ago,\" said Mrs. Bobbsey, when  paying for her purchases.    \"Yes, two bad boys broke the window,\" answered the shoe dealer.    \"Who were they?\"    \"I couldn't find out. But perhaps I'll learn some day, and then I mean  to have them arrested,\" said Mr. Ringley. \"The broken glass ruined  several pairs of shoes that were in the window.\" And then he turned  away to wait on another customer.    Soon the large department store was reached and Mrs. Bobbsey let Freddie  and Flossie take their time in looking into the several windows. One was  full of dolls, which made the little girl gape in wonder and delight.    \"Oh, mamma, what a flock of dolls!\" she cried. \"Must be 'bout ten  millions of them, don't you think so?\"    \"Hardly that many, Flossie; but there are a good many.\"    \"And, oh, mamma, what pretty dresses! I wish I had that doll with the  pink silk and the big lace hat,\" added the little girl.    \"Do you think that is the nicest, Flossie?\"    \"Indeed, indeed I do,\" answered the little miss. \"It's too lovely for  anything. Can't we get it and take it home?\"    \"No, dear; but you had better ask Santa Claus to send it to you,\"  continued her mother with a smile.    Some wooden soldiers and building blocks caught Freddie's eye, and for  the time being his favorite fire engines were forgotten.    \"I want wooden soldiers,\" he said. \"Can set 'em up in a row, with the  sword-man in front, an' the man with the drum.\"    \"Perhaps Santa Claus will bring you some soldiers in your stocking,  Freddie.\"    \"Stocking ain't big enough--want big ones, like that,\" and he pointed  with his chubby hand.    \"Well, let us wait and see what Santa Claus can do,\" said Mrs. Bobbsey.    Inside of the store was a candy counter near the doorway, and there was  no peace for Mrs. Bobbsey until she had purchased some chocolate drops  for Flossie, and a long peppermint cane for Freddie. Then they walked  around, down one aisle and up another, admiring the many things which  were displayed.    \"Bert said they had a lavater,\" said Freddie presently. \"Mamma, I want  to go in the lavater.\"    \"Lavater?\" repeated Mrs. Bobbsey, with a puzzled look. \"Why, Freddie,  what do you mean?\"    \"He means the stairs that runs up and down on a big rope,\" put in  Flossie.    \"Oh, the elevator,\" said the mother. \"Very well, you shall both ride in  the elevator.\"    It was great sport to ride to the third story of the store, although the  swift way in which the elevator moved made the twins gasp a little.    \"Let us go down again,\" said Freddie. \"It's ever so much nicer than  climbing the stairs.\"    \"I wish to make a few purchases first,\" answered the mother.    She had come to buy a rug for the front hallway, and while she was busy  in the rug and carpet department she allowed the twins to look at a  number of toys which were located at the other end of the floor.    For a while Freddie and Flossie kept close together, for there was quite  a crowd present and they felt a little afraid. But then Flossie  discovered a counter where all sorts of things for dolls were on sale  and she lingered there, to look at the dresses, and hats, and underwear,  and shoes and stockings, and chairs, trunks, combs and brushes, and  other goods.    \"Oh, my, I must have some of those things for my dolls,\" she said, half  aloud. There was a trunk she thought perfectly lovely and it was marked  39 cents. \"Not so very much,\" she thought.    When Freddie got around to where the elevator was, it was just"]]]
