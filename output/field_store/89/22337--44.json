Even previous to the interview at  Erfurt, after Sebastiani's return from Constantinople, although Napoleon  still seemed to adhere to the idea of dismembering Turkey in Europe, he  had admitted the correctness of his ambassador's reasoning: \"That in  this partition, the advantages would be all against him; that Russia and  Austria would acquire contiguous provinces, which would make their  dominions more complete, while we should be obliged to keep 80,000 men  continually in Greece to retain it in subjection; that such an army,  from the distance and losses it would sustain from long marches, and the  novelty and unhealthiness of the climate, would require 30,000 recruits  annually, a number which would quite drain France: that a line of  operation extending from Athens to Paris, was out of all proportion;  that besides, it was strangled in its passage at Trieste, at which point  only two marches would enable the Austrians to place themselves across  it, and thereby cut off our army of observation in Greece from all  communication with Italy and France.\"    Here Napoleon exclaimed, \"that Austria certainly complicated every  thing; that she was there like a dead weight; that she must be got rid  off; and Europe must be divided into two empires: that the Danube, from  the Black Sea to Passau, the mountains of Bohemia to Koenigsgratz, and  the Elbe to the Baltic, should be their lines of demarcation. Alexander  should become the emperor of the north, and he of the south of Europe.\"  Abandoning, subsequently, these lofty ideas, and reverting to  Sebastiani's observations on the partition of European Turkey, he  terminated the conferences, which had lasted three days, with these  words: \"You are right, and no answer can be given to that! I give it up.  Besides, that accords with my views on Spain, which I am going to unite  to France.\"--\"What do I hear?\" exclaimed Sebastiani, astonished, \"unite  it! And your brother!\"--\"What signifies my brother?\" retorted Napoleon;  \"does one give away a kingdom like Spain? I am determined to unite it to  France. I will give that nation a great national representation. I will  make the emperor Alexander consent to it, by allowing him to take  possession of Turkey to the Danube, and I will evacuate Berlin. As to  Joseph, I will indemnify him.\"    The congress at Erfurt took place just after this. He could have no  motive at that time for supporting the rights of the Turks. The French  army, which had advanced imprudently into the very heart of Spain, had  met with reverses. The presence of its leader, and that of his armies of  the Rhine and the Elbe, became there every day more and more necessary,  and Austria had availed herself of the opportunity to take up arms.  Uneasy respecting the state of Germany, Napoleon was therefore anxious  to make sure of the dispositions of Alexander, to conclude an alliance  offensive and defensive with him, and even to engage him in a war. Such  were the reasons which induced him to abandon Turkey as far as the  Danube to that emperor.    The Porte therefore had very soon reason to reproach us for the war  which was renewed between it and Russia. Notwithstanding, in July, 1808,  when Mustapha was dethroned, and succeeded by Mahmoud, the latter  announced his accession to the French emperor; but Napoleon had then to  keep upon terms with Alexander, and felt too much regret at the death of  Selim, detestation of the barbarity of the Mussulmans, and contempt for  their unstable government, to allow him to notice the communication. For  three years he had returned no reply to the sultan, and his silence  might be interpreted into a refusal to acknowledge him.    He was in this ambiguous position with the Turks, when all of a sudden,  on the 21st of March, 1812, only six weeks before the war with Russia  commenced, he solicited an alliance with Mahmoud: he demanded that,  within five days from the period of the communication, all negotiation  between the Turks and Russians should be broken off; and that an army of  100,000 men, commanded by the sultan himself, should march to the Danube  within nine days. The return which he proposed to make for this  assistance was, to put the Porte in possession of the very same Moldavia  and Wallachia, which, under the circumstances, the Russians were but too  happy to restore as the price of a speedy peace; and the promise of  procuring the restoration of the Crimea, which he had made six years  before to Selim, was again renewed.    We know not whether the time which this despatch would take to arrive at  Constantinople had been badly calculated, whether Napoleon believed the  Turkish army to be stronger than it really was, or whether he had  flattered himself with surprising and captivating the determination of  the divan by so sudden and advantageous a proposition. It can hardly be  supposed that he was ignorant of the long invariable custom of the  Mussulmans, which prevented the grand signor from ever appearing in  person at the head of his army.    It appears as if the genius of Napoleon could not stoop so low as to  impute to the divan the brutish ignorance which it exhibited of its real  interests. After the manner in which he had abandoned the interests of  Turkey in 1807, perhaps he did not make sufficient allowance for the  distrust which the Mussulmans were likely to entertain of his new  promises; he forgot that they were too ignorant to appreciate the change  which recent circumstances had effected in his political views; and that  barbarians like them could still less comprehend the feelings of dislike  with which they had inspired him, by their deposition and murder of  Selim, to whom he was attached, and in conjunction with whom he had  hoped to make European Turkey a military power capable of coping with  Russia.    Perhaps he might still have gained over Mahmoud to his cause, if he had  sooner made use of more potent arguments; but, as he has since expressed  himself, it revolted his pride to make use of corruption. We shall  besides shortly see him hesitating about beginning a war with Alexander,  or laying too much stress on the alarm with which his immense  preparations would inspire that monarch. It is also possible, that the  last propositions which he made to the Turks, being tantamount to a  declaration of war against the Russians, were delayed for the express  purpose of deceiving the Czar as to the period of his invasion. Finally,  whether it was from all these causes, from a confidence founded on the  mutual hatred of the two nations, and on his treaty of alliance with  Austria, which had just guaranteed Moldavia and Wallachia to the Turks,  he detained the ambassador whom he sent to them on his road, and waited,  as we have just seen, to the very last moment.    But the divan was surrounded by the Russian, English, Austrian, and  Swedish envoys, who with one voice represented to it, \"that the Turks  were indebted for their existence in Europe solely to the divisions  which existed among the Christian monarchs; that the moment these were  united under one influence, the Mahometans in Europe would be  overwhelmed; and that as the French emperor was advancing rapidly to the  attainment of universal empire, it was him whom the Turks had most  reason to dread.\"    To these representations were added the intrigues of the two Greek  princes Morozi. They were of the same religion with Alexander, and they  looked to him for the possession of Moldavia and Wallachia. Grown rich  by his favours and by the gold of England, these dragomans enlightened  the unsuspecting ignorance of the Turks, as to the occupation and  military surveys of the Ottoman frontiers by the French. They did a  great deal more; the first of them influenced the dispositions of the  divan and the capital, and the second those of the grand vizir and the  army; and as the proud Mahmoud resisted, and would only accept an  honourable peace, these treacherous Greeks contrived to disband his  army, and compelled him, by insurrections, to sign the degrading treaty  of Bucharest with the Russians.    Such is the power of intrigue in the seraglio; two Greeks whom the Turks  despised, there decided the fate of Turkey, in spite of the sultan  himself. As the latter depended for his existence on the intrigues of  his palace, he was, like all despots who shut themselves up in them,  obliged to yield: the Morozi carried the day; but afterwards he had them  both beheaded.          CHAP. IV.      In this manner did we lose the support of Turkey; but Sweden still  remained to us; her monarch had sprung from our ranks; a soldier of our  army, it was to that he owed his glory and his throne: was it likely  that he would desert our cause on the first opportunity he had of  showing his gratitude? It was impossible to anticipate such ingratitude;  still less, that he would sacrifice the real and permanent interests of  Sweden to his former jealousy of Napoleon, and perhaps to a weakness too  common among the upstart favourites of fortune; unless it be that the  submission of men who have newly attained to greatness to those who  boast of a transmitted rank, is a necessity of their position rather  than an error of their self-love.    In this great contest between aristocracy and democracy, the ranks of  the former had been joined by one of its most determined enemies.  Bernadotte being thrown almost singly among the ancient courts and  nobility, did"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18127"],[0,"The Beginner's American History (#7)"],[1," visit them. What puzzled them,  however, was that he had such a pale face instead of having a red  one like themselves.    At the end of the feast Hudson rose to go, but the Indians begged  him to stay all night. Then one of them got up, gathered all the arrows,  broke them to pieces, and threw them into the fire, in order to show  the captain that he need not be afraid to stop with them.    [Footnote 2: Palisades: this name is given to the wall of rock on  the Hudson, because, when seen near by, it somewhat resembles a  palisade, or high fence made of stakes or posts set close together,  upright in the ground.]      57. Captain Hudson reaches the end of his voyage and turns back;  trouble with the Indians.--But Captain Hudson made up his mind that  he must now go on with his voyage. He went back to his ship and kept  on up the river until he had reached a point about a hundred and fifty  miles from its mouth. Here the city of Albany now stands. He found  that the water was growing shallow, and he feared that if the _Half  Moon_ went further she would get aground. It was clear to him, too,  that wherever the river might lead, he was not likely to find it a  short road to China.    On the way down stream a thievish Indian, who had come out in a canoe,  managed to steal something from the ship. One of the crew chanced  to see the Indian as he was slyly slipping off, and picking up a gun  he fired and killed him. After that Hudson's men had several fights  with the Indians.    [Illustration: CAPTAIN HUDSON ON THE GREAT RIVER.]      58. Hudson returns to Europe; the \"Great River\" is called by his name;  his death.--Early in October the captain set sail for Europe. Ever  since that time the beautiful river which he explored has been called  the Hudson in his honor.    The next year Captain Hudson made another voyage, and entered that  immense bay in the northern part of America which we now know as  Hudson Bay. There he got into trouble with his men. Some of them  seized him and set him adrift with a few others in an open boat.  Nothing more was ever heard of the brave English sailor. The bay which  bears his name is probably his grave.      59. The Dutch take possession of the land on the Hudson and call it  New Netherland; how New Netherland became New York.--As soon as the  Dutch in Holland heard that Captain Hudson had found a country where  the Indians had plenty of rich furs to sell, they sent out people  to trade with them. Holland is sometimes called the Netherlands; that  is, the Low Lands. When the Dutch took possession of the country on  the Hudson (1614), they gave it the name of New Netherland,[3] for  the same reason that the English called one part of their possessions  in America New England. In the course of a few years the Dutch built  (1615) a fort and some log cabins on the lower end of Manhattan Island.  After a time they named this little settlement New Amsterdam, in  remembrance of the port of Amsterdam in Holland from which Hudson  sailed.    After the Dutch had held the country of New Netherland about fifty  years, the English (1664) seized it. They changed its name to New  York, in honor of the Duke of York, who was brother to the king. The  English also changed the name of New Amsterdam to that of New York  City.    [Footnote 3: New Netherland: this is often incorrectly printed New  Netherlands.]      60. The New York \"Sons of Liberty\" in the Revolution; what Henry  Hudson would say of the city now.--More than a hundred years after  this the young men of New York, the \"Sons of Liberty,\" as they called  themselves, made ready with the \"Sons of Liberty\" in other states  to do their full part, under the lead of General Washington, in the  great war of the Revolution,--that war by which we gained our freedom  from the rule of the king of England, and became the United States  of America.    The silent harbor where Henry Hudson saw a few Indian canoes is now  one of the busiest seaports in the world. The great statue of Liberty  stands at its entrance.[4] To it a fleet of ships and steamers is  constantly coming from all parts of the globe; from it another fleet  is constantly going. If Captain Hudson could see the river which  bears his name, and Manhattan Island now covered with miles of  buildings which make the largest and wealthiest city in America, he  would say: There is no need of my looking any further for the riches  of China and the Indies, for I have found them here.    [Footnote 4: In her right hand Liberty holds a torch to guide vessels  at night.]      61. Summary.--In 1609 Henry Hudson, an English sea-captain, then in  the employ of the Dutch, discovered the river now called by his name.  The Dutch took possession of the country on the river, named it New  Netherland, and built a small settlement on Manhattan Island. Many  years later the English seized the country and named it New York.  The settlement on Manhattan Island then became New York City; it is  now the largest and wealthiest city in the United States.      Who was Henry Hudson? What did he try to find?

The English Pilgrims in Holland; why they left England.--When  the news of Henry Hudson's discovery of the Hudson River reached  Holland, many Englishmen were living in the Dutch city of Leyden.[2]  These people were mostly farmers who had fled from Scrooby[3] and  neighboring villages in the northeast of England. They called  themselves Pilgrims, because they were wanderers from their old  homes.    The Pilgrims left England because King James would not let them hold  their religious meetings in peace. He thought, as all kings then did,  that everybody in England should belong to the same church and  worship God in the same way that he did.[4] He was afraid that if  people were allowed to go to whatever church they thought best that  it would lead to disputes and quarrels, which would end by breaking  his kingdom to pieces. Quite a number of Englishmen, seeing that they  could not have religious liberty at home, escaped with their wives  and children to Holland; for there the Dutch were willing to let them  have such a church as they wanted.    [Illustration: Map of England and Holland]    [Footnote 1: Myles (Miles): Standish himself wrote it Myles.]    [Footnote 2: Leyden (Li'den): see map in this paragraph.]    [Footnote 3: Scrooby (Skroo'bi): see map in this paragraph.]    [Footnote 4: There were some people in England who thought much as  the Pilgrims did in regard to religion, but who did not then leave  the Church of England (as the Pilgrims did). They were called  Puritans because they insisted on making certain changes in the  English mode of worship, or, as they said, they wished to _purify_  it. Many Puritans came to New England with Governor Winthrop in 1630;  after they settled in America they established independent churches  like the Pilgrims.]      63. Why the Pilgrims wished to leave Holland and go to America.--But  the Pilgrims were not contented in Holland. They saw that if they  staid in that country their children would grow up to be more Dutch  than English. They saw, too, that they could not hope to get land  in Holland. They resolved therefore to go to America, where they  could get farms for nothing, and where their children would never  forget the English language or the good old English customs and laws.  In the wilderness they would not only enjoy entire religious freedom,  but they could build up a settlement which would be certainly their  own.      64. The Pilgrims, with Captain Myles Standish, sail for England and  then for America; they reach Cape Cod, and choose a governor  there.--In 1620 a company of Pilgrims sailed for England on their  way to America. Captain Myles Standish, an English soldier, who had  fought in Holland, joined them. He did not belong to the Pilgrim  church, but he had become a great friend to those who did.    About a hundred of these people sailed from Plymouth,[5] England,  for the New World, in the ship _Mayflower_. Many of those who went  were children and young people. The Pilgrims had a long, rough  passage across the Atlantic. Toward the last of November (1620) they  saw land. It was Cape Cod, that narrow strip of sand, more than sixty  miles long, which looks like an arm bent at the elbow, with a hand  like a half-shut fist.    [Illustration: Map of Cape Cod and part of New England.]    Finding that it would be difficult to go further, the Pilgrims  decided to land and explore the cape; so the _Mayflower_ entered Cape  Cod Harbor, inside the half-shut fist, and then came to anchor.    Before they landed, the Pilgrims held a meeting in the cabin, and  drew up an agreement in writing for the government of the settlement.  They signed the agreement, and then chose John Carver for governor.    [Footnote 5: Plymouth (Plim'uth).]      65. Washing-day; what Standish and his men found on the Cape.--On  the first Monday after they had reached the cape, all the women went  on shore to wash, and so Monday has been kept as washing-day in New  England ever since. Shortly after that, Captain Myles Standish, with  a number of men, started off to see the country. They found some  Indian corn buried in the sand; and a little further on a young man  named William Bradford, who afterward became governor, stepped "]]]
