We were passing over the shades whom the heavy rain subdues, and  were setting our feet upon their vain show that seems a body.  They all of them lay upon the ground, except one who raised  himself to sit, quickly as he saw us passing before him. \"O thou  who art led through this Hell,\" he said to me, \"recognize me, if  thou canst; thou wast made before I was unmade.\" And I to him,  \"The anguish which thou hast perchance withdraws thee from my  memory, so that it seems not that I ever saw thee. But tell me  who thou art, that in a place so woeful art set, and with such a  punishment, that if any other is greater none is so displeasing.\"  And he to me, \"Thy city which is so full of envy, that already  the sack runs over, held me in it, in the serene life. You  citizens called me Ciacco; [1] for the damnable sin of gluttony,  as thou seest, I am broken by the rain. And I, wretched soul, am  not alone, for all these endure like punishment, for like sin,\"  and more he said not. I answered him, \"Ciacco, thy trouble so  weighs upon me, that it invites me to weeping; but tell me, if  thou canst, to what will come the citizens of the divided city;  if any one in it is just; and tell me the reason why such great  discord has assailed it.\"    [1] Ciacco, in popular speech, signifies a hog.      And he to me, \"After long contention they will come to blood, and  the savage party will chase out the other with great injury.  Thereafter within three suns it behoves this to fall, and the  other to surmount through the force of one who even now is  tacking. It will hold high its front long time, keeping the other  under heavy burdens, however it may lament and be shamed thereat.  Two men are just, but there they are not heeded; Pride, Envy,  Avarice are the three sparks that have inflamed their hearts.\"[1]    Here he set end unto the lamentable sound.    [1] This prophecy relates to the dissensions and violence of the  parties of the Whites and the Blacks by which Florence was rent.  The \"savage party\" was that of the Whites, who were mainly  Ghibellines. The \"one who even now is tacking\" was the Pope,  Boniface VIII., who was playing fast and loose with both. Who the  \"two just men\" were is unknown.      And I to him, \"Still I would that thou teach me, and that of more  speech thou make a gift to me. Farinata and the Tegghiaio who  were so worthy, Jacopo Rusticucci, Arrigo, and the Mosca, and the  rest who set their minds on well-doing, tell me where they are,  and cause that I may know them, for great desire constrains me to  learn if Heaven sweeten them, or Hell envenom.    And he, \"They are among the blacker souls: a different sin weighs  them down to the bottom; if thou so far descendest, thou canst  see them. But when thou shalt be in the sweet world I pray thee  that thou bring me to the memory of others. More I say not to  thee, and more I answer thee not.\" His straight eyes he twisted  then awry, looked at me a little, and then bent his head, and  fell with it level with the other blind.    And the Leader said to me, \"He wakes no more this side the sound  of the angelic trump. When the hostile Sovereign shall come, each  one will find again his dismal tomb, will take again his flesh  and his shape, will hear that which through eternity reechoes.\"    Thus we passed along with slow steps through the foul mixture of  the shades and of the rain, touching a little on the future life.  Wherefore I said, \"Master, these torments will they increase  after the great sentence, or will they become less, or will they  be just as burning?\" And he to me, \"Return to thy science, which  declares that the more perfect a thing is the more it feels the  good, and so the pain. Though this accursed people never can  attain to true perfection, it expects thereafter to be more than  now.\"    We took a circling course along that road, speaking far more than  I repeat; and came to the point where the descent is. Here we  found Pluto,[1] the great enemy.    [1] Pluto appears here not as Hades, the god of the lower world,  but in his character as the giver of wealth.        CANTO VII. The Fourth Circle, that of the Avaricious and the  Prodigal.--Pluto.--Fortune.--The Styx.--The Fifth Circle, that of  the Wrathful and the Sullen.    \"Pape Satan, pape Satan aleppe,\"--began Pluto with his clucking  voice. And that gentle Sage, who knew everything, said to comfort  me, \"Let not thy fear hurt thee; for whatso power he have shall  not take from thee the descent of this rock.\" Then he turned to  that swollen lip and said, \"Be silent, accursed wolf! inwardly  consume thyself with thine own rage: not without cause is this  going to the abyss; it is willed on high, there where Michael did  vengeance on the proud adultery.\"[1] As sails swollen by the wind  fall in a heap when the mast snaps, so fell to earth the cruel  beast.    [1] Adultery, in the sense of infidelity to God.      Thus we descended into the fourth hollow, taking more of the  woeful bank that gathers in the evil of the whole universe. Ah,  Justice of God! Who heapeth up so many new travails and penalties  as I saw? And why doth our sin so waste us? As doth the wave,  yonder upon Charybdis, which is broken on that which it  encounters, so it behoves that here the people counterdance.    Here saw I people more than elsewhere many, and from one side and  the other with great howls rolling weights by force of chest.  They struck against each other, and then just there each turned,  rolling backward, crying, \"Why keepest thou?\" and \"Why flingest  thou away?\" Thus they turned through the dark circle on either  hand to the opposite point, still crying out their opprobrious  verse; then each, when he had come through his half circle,  wheeled round to the other joust.    And I, who had my heart well-nigh pierced through, said, \"My  Master, now declare to me what folk is this, and if all these  tonsured ones on our left were clerks.\"    And he to me, \"All of these were so asquint in mind in the first  life that they made no spending there with measure. Clearly  enough their voices bay it out, when they come to the two points  of the circle where the contrary sin divides them. These were  clerks who have no hairy covering on their head, and Popes and  Cardinals, in whom avarice practices its excess.\"    And I, \"Master, among such as these I ought surely to recognize  some who were polluted with these evils.\"    And he to me, \"Vain thought thou harborest; the undiscerning life  that made them foul, to all recognition now makes them dim.  Forever will they come to the two buttings; these will rise from  the sepulchre with closed fist, and these with shorn hair.  Ill-giving and ill-keeping have taken from them the fair world,  and set them to this scuffle; such as it is, I adorn not words  for it. Now canst thou, son, see the brief jest of the goods that  are committed unto Fortune, for which the human race so scramble;  for all the gold that is beneath the moon, or that ever was, of  these weary souls could not make a single one repose.\"    \"Master,\" said I to him, \"now tell me further; this Fortune, on  which thou touchest for me, what is it, that hath the goods of  the world so in its clutches?\"    And he to me, \"O creatures foolish, how great is that ignorance  that harms you! I would have thee now take in my judgment of her.  He whose wisdom transcendeth all made the heavens, and gave them  their guides, so that every part on every part doth shine,  equally distributing the light. In like wise for the splendors of  the world, He ordained a general ministress and guide, who should  ever and anon transfer the vain goods from race to race, and from  one blood to another, beyond the resistance of human wit.  Wherefore one race rules, and the other languishes, pursuant to  her judgment, which is occult as the snake in the grass. Your  wisdom hath no withstanding of her: she provides, judges and  maintains her realm, as theirs the other gods. Her permutations  have no truce; necessity compels her to be swift, so often cometh  he who obtains a turn. This is she who is so set upon the cross,  even by those who ought to give her praise, giving her blame  amiss and ill report. But she is blessed and hears this not. With  the other Primal Creatures glad she turns her sphere, and blessed  she rejoices. But now let us descend to greater woe. Already  every star sinks that was rising when I set out, and too long  stay is forbidden.\"    We crossed the circle to the other bank, above a fount that boils  and pours down through a cleft that proceeds from it. The water  was far darker than perse;[1] and we, in company with the dusky  waves, entered down through a strange way. A marsh it makes, that  is named Styx, this dismal little stream, when it has descended  to the foot of the malign gray slopes. And I, who stood intent to  gaze, saw muddy people in that swamp, all naked and with look of  hurt. They were smiting each other, not only with hands, but with  head, and with chest, and with feet, mangling one another  piecemeal with their teeth.    [1] Purple-black.      The good Master said, \"Son, now thou seest the souls of those  whom anger overcame; and likewise I would have thee believe for  certain that beneath the water are folk who sigh, and make this  water bubble at the surface, as thine eye tells thee wherever it  turns. Fixed in the slime, they say, 'Sullen were we in the sweet  air that by the Sun is gladdened, bearing within ourselves the  sluggish fume; now we are sullen in the black mire.' This hymn  they gurgle in their throats, for they cannot speak with entire  words.\"[1]    [1] The sin here punished is that known to the Middle Ages as  acedia, or accidie,--slackness in good works, and spiritual gloom  and despondency. In the Parson's Tale Chaucer says: \"En"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19950"],[0,"Summa Theologica, Part III (Tertia Pars) (#7)"],[1," and  perfection of that thing to exist by itself (which is understood by  the word \"person\"). Now it is a greater dignity to exist in something  nobler than oneself than to exist by oneself. Hence the human nature  of Christ has a greater dignity than ours, from this very fact that  in us, being existent by itself, it has its own personality, but in  Christ it exists in the Person of the Word. Thus to perfect the  species belongs to the dignity of a form, yet the sensitive part in  man, on account of its union with the nobler form which perfects the  species, is more noble than in brutes, where it is itself the form  which perfects.    Reply Obj. 3: The Word of God \"did not assume human nature in  general, but _in atomo_\"--that is, in an individual--as Damascene  says (De Fide Orth. iii, 11) otherwise every man would be the Word of  God, even as Christ was. Yet we must bear in mind that not every  individual in the genus of substance, even in rational nature, is a  person, but that alone which exists by itself, and not that which  exists in some more perfect thing. Hence the hand of Socrates,  although it is a kind of individual, is not a person, because it does  not exist by itself, but in something more perfect, viz. in the  whole. And hence, too, this is signified by a \"person\" being defined  as \"an individual substance,\" for the hand is not a complete  substance, but part of a substance. Therefore, although this human  nature is a kind of individual in the genus of substance, it has not  its own personality, because it does not exist separately, but in  something more perfect, viz. in the Person of the Word. Therefore the  union took place in the person.  _______________________    THIRD ARTICLE [III, Q. 2, Art. 3]    Whether the Union of the Word Incarnate Took Place in the Suppositum  or Hypostasis?    Objection 1: It would seem that the union of the Word Incarnate did  not take place in the suppositum or hypostasis. For Augustine says  (Enchiridion xxxv, xxxviii): \"Both the Divine and human substance are  one Son of God, but they are one thing (_aliud_) by reason of the  Word and another thing (_aliud_) by reason of the man.\" And Pope Leo  says in his letter to Flavian (Ep. xxviii): \"One of these is glorious  with miracles, the other succumbs under injuries.\" But \"one\"  (_aliud_) and \"the other\" (_aliud_) differ in suppositum. Therefore  the union of the Word Incarnate did not take place in the suppositum.    Obj. 2: Further, hypostasis is nothing more than a \"particular  substance,\" as Boethius says (De Duab. Nat.). But it is plain that in  Christ there is another particular substance beyond the hypostasis of  the Word, viz. the body and the soul and the resultant of these.  Therefore there is another hypostasis in Him besides the hypostasis  of the Word.    Obj. 3: Further, the hypostasis of the Word is not included in any  genus or species, as is plain from the First Part (Q. 3, A. 5). But  Christ, inasmuch as He is made man, is contained under the species of  man; for Dionysius says (Div. Nom. 1): \"Within the limits of our  nature He came, Who far surpasses the whole order of nature  supersubstantially.\" Now nothing is contained under the human species  unless it be a hypostasis of the human species. Therefore in Christ  there is another hypostasis besides the hypostasis of the Word of  God; and hence the same conclusion follows as above.    _On the contrary,_ Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii, 3, 4, 5): \"In  our Lord Jesus Christ we acknowledge two natures and one hypostasis.\"    _I answer that,_ Some who did not know the relation of hypostasis to  person, although granting that there is but one person in Christ,  held, nevertheless, that there is one hypostasis of God and another  of man, and hence that the union took place in the person and not in  the hypostasis. Now this, for three reasons, is clearly erroneous.  First, because person only adds to hypostasis a determinate nature,  viz. rational, according to what Boethius says (De Duab. Nat.), \"a  person is an individual substance of rational nature\"; and hence it  is the same to attribute to the human nature in Christ a proper  hypostasis and a proper person. And the holy Fathers, seeing this,  condemned both in the Fifth Council held at Constantinople, saying:  \"If anyone seeks to introduce into the mystery of the Incarnation two  subsistences or two persons, let him be anathema. For by the  incarnation of one of the Holy Trinity, God the Word, the Holy  Trinity received no augment of person or subsistence.\" Now  \"subsistence\" is the same as the subsisting thing, which is proper to  hypostasis, as is plain from Boethius (De Duab. Nat.). Secondly,  because if it is granted that person adds to hypostasis something in  which the union can take place, this something is nothing else than a  property pertaining to dignity; according as it is said by some that  a person is a \"hypostasis distinguished by a property pertaining to  dignity.\" If, therefore, the union took place in the person and not  in the hypostasis, it follows that the union only took place in  regard to some dignity. And this is what Cyril, with the approval of  the Council of Ephesus (part iii, can. 3), condemned in these terms:  \"If anyone after the uniting divides the subsistences in the one  Christ, only joining them in a union of dignity or authority or  power, and not rather in a concourse of natural union, let him be  anathema.\" Thirdly, because to the hypostasis alone are attributed  the operations and the natural properties, and whatever belongs to  the nature in the concrete; for we say that this man reasons, and is  risible, and is a rational animal. So likewise this man is said to be  a suppositum, because he underlies (_supponitur_) whatever belongs to  man and receives its predication. Therefore, if there is any  hypostasis in Christ besides the hypostasis of the Word, it follows  that whatever pertains to man is verified of some other than the  Word, e.g. that He was born of a Virgin, suffered, was crucified, was  buried. And this, too, was condemned with the approval of the Council  of Ephesus (part iii, can. 4) in these words: \"If anyone ascribes to  two persons or subsistences such words as are in the evangelical and  apostolic Scriptures, or have been said of Christ by the saints, or  by Himself of Himself, and, moreover, applies some of them to the  man, taken as distinct from the Word of God, and some of them (as if  they could be used of God alone) only to the Word of God the Father,  let him be anathema.\" Therefore it is plainly a heresy condemned long  since by the Church to say that in Christ there are two hypostases,  or two supposita, or that the union did not take place in the  hypostasis or suppositum. Hence in the same Synod (can. 2) it is  said: \"If anyone does not confess that the Word was united to flesh  in subsistence, and that Christ with His flesh is both--to wit, God  and man--let him be anathema.\"    Reply Obj. 1: As accidental difference makes a thing \"other\"  (_alterum_), so essential difference makes \"another thing\" (_aliud_).  Now it is plain that the \"otherness\" which springs from accidental  difference may pertain to the same hypostasis or suppositum in  created things, since the same thing numerically can underlie  different accidents. But it does not happen in created things that  the same numerically can subsist in divers essences or natures. Hence  just as when we speak of \"otherness\" in regard to creatures we do not  signify diversity of suppositum, but only diversity of accidental  forms, so likewise when Christ is said to be one thing or another  thing, we do not imply diversity of suppositum or hypostasis, but  diversity of nature. Hence Gregory Nazianzen says in a letter to  Chelidonius (Ep. ci): \"In the Saviour we may find one thing and  another, yet He is not one person and another. And I say 'one thing  and another'; whereas, on the contrary, in the Trinity we say one  Person and another (so as not to confuse the subsistences), but not  one thing and another.\"    Reply Obj. 2: Hypostasis signifies a particular substance, not in  every way, but as it is in its complement. Yet as it is in union with  something more complete, it is not said to be a hypostasis, as a hand  or a foot. So likewise the human nature in Christ, although it is a  particular substance, nevertheless cannot be called a hypostasis or  suppositum, seeing that it is in union with a completed thing, viz.  the whole Christ, as He is God and man. But the complete being with  which it concurs is said to be a hypostasis or suppositum.    Reply Obj. 3: In created things a singular thing is placed in a genus  or species, not on account of what belongs to its individuation, but  on account of its nature, which springs from its form, and in  composite things individuation is taken more from matter. Hence we  say that Christ is in the human species by reason of the nature  assumed, and not by reason of the hypostasis.  _______________________    FOURTH ARTICLE [III, Q. 2, Art. 4]    Whether After the Incarnation the Person or Hypostasis of Christ Is  Composite?    Objection 1: It would seem that the Person of Christ is not  composite. For the Person of Christ is naught else than the Person or  hypostasis of the Word, as appears from what has been said (A. 2).  But in the Word, Person and Nature do not differ, as appears from  First Part (Q. 39, A. 1). Therefore since the Nature of the Word is  simple, as was shown above (I, Q. 3, A. 7), it is impossible that the  Person of Christ be composite.    Obj. 2: Further, all composition requires parts. But the Divine  Nature is incompatible with the notion of a part, for every part  implicates the notion of imperfection. Therefore it is impossible  that the Person of Christ be composed of two natures.    Obj. 3: Further, what is composed of others would seem to be  homogeneous with them, as from bodies only a body can be"]]]
