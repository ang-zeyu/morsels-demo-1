They were to keep on  praying; asking God for such things as were right, and trusting that  He would preserve them amidst all their enemies; and in His own way  make them to triumph over their foes. Whatever is best for His people,  God will give them. He cares for the sparrows, and, even more, for  those who love Him.    [Illustration: THE UNJUST JUDGE.]          THE PHARISEE AND THE TAX-GATHERER.      The tax-gatherers in those days were called Publicans. They were  reputed to be very unjust, exacting from people more than the law  required them to pay, and other wickedness was charged against them.  Of course, there were good men among them; St. Matthew was a  tax-gatherer before Jesus called him to follow Him. The Pharisees  studied the Scriptures and explained them to the people, but they did  not follow the teachings of Scripture. They were proud, and pretended  they were more religious than other men, but it was _only_ pretense.  Jesus compared them to whited sepulchres, and said they were  hypocrites, who led the people astray.    A Pharisee and a Publican went up into the Temple to pray. The  Pharisee stood in a part of the Temple where all could see him, and  prayed thus: \"O God, I thank Thee that I am not like other men, who  are unjust, and who take more than belongs to them. I thank Thee that  I am not like this Publican. I fast twice a week; I give to the  priests and Levites a tenth part of all I possess.\" But the Publican,  who knew that he was wicked, and felt sorry for it, stood afar off in  a quiet part of the Temple where none would see him. He bowed his head  and beat upon his breast, saying, \"God be merciful to me a sinner.\"    Jesus said that this Publican went to his home more forgiven than the  Pharisee, for every one that is proud and thinks much of himself shall  be put down, and he that humbleth himself and is sorry for his sins,  shall be exalted. \"Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the  earth,\" says Jesus.    [Illustration: THE PHARISEE AND THE TAX-GATHERER.]          THE LABOURERS IN THE VINEYARD.          \"Go, work within my vineyard's bound,      At eve your 'penny'[1] shall be found:\"      So spake the vineyard's lord, and they      Began to toil at break of day.        For hours the sun had shown his face,      When idlers in the market-place      Once and again were sent within      The vineyard's wall their wage to win.        Nay, when but one short hour remains      Before the sun its goal attains,      More loiterers hear the Lord's command      And set to work with willing hand.        The steward came at close of day      Their wage to reckon and to pay;      And they whose toil could scarcely tire,      Received a penny for their hire.        But they who the day's burden bore      And noonday heat, expected more:      And murmur'd that the generous lord      To all one penny should accord.        But he replied, \"I wrong not you;      I give you the full wages due;      And why should you my bounty blame,      In paying these beyond their claim?\"        Lord, to Thy vineyard Thou dost call      The least, the youngest of us all:      To each Thou dost assign a task,      From each some service Thou dost ask.        How kind such feeble hands to use;      Such pleasant work I needs must choose:      I ask no wages, Lord, from thee,      For Thou hast given Thyself for me.        When I remember all Thy grace,      I cannot loiter in my place:      And when I think of all my sin,      What wages can I hope to win?        Thanks, Lord, if yet my years are few,      And I retain the early dew:      Oh, keep me through the noonday heat,      And cheer me with Thy presence sweet.        For if I have Thy presence, Lord,      'Tis an exceeding great reward;      And if at last I see Thy face,      'Tis not of merit, but of grace.        And, oh, what will that \"penny\" be      Which Thou wilt then bestow on me?      A glorious image it will bear,      Thy own dear Self, Lord, will be there!            RICHARD WILTON, M.A.           *       *       *       *       *    FOOTNOTES:    [1] The penny, or _denarius_, was a silver coin, stamped with  the image of the Roman Emperor, and worth about 16 cents of our money.  It was a full ordinary day's wage at that time.    [Illustration: THE LABOURERS IN THE VINEYARD.]          THE BARREN FIG-TREE.      In the morning, when Jesus had left Bethany and was coming towards  Jerusalem, He was hungry. Seeing a fig-tree afar off, covered with  leaves, He came to it, hoping to find some fruit on it. But the tree  was a young one, and had not yet commenced to bear fruit. And He found  thereon nothing but leaves. Then He said unto it, \"Let no fruit grow  on thee henceforward for ever.\" And the fig-tree withered away and was  dead from the roots. When the disciples saw it, they marvelled,  saying, \"How soon the fig-tree is withered away!\"    Jesus answered, and said unto them, \"Verily I say unto you, if ye have  faith and doubt not, ye shall not only do as I have done to this  fig-tree, but, also, if ye shall say unto this mountain, 'Be thou  removed and be cast into the sea,' it shall be done. And all things,  whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believe that ye will receive them,  and ye shall have them. And when ye are praying, forgive any that have  injured you, that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you  your trespasses against Him. But if ye do not forgive, neither will  your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses.\"    How strange it seems that Jesus, who was gentle and kind, should  pronounce a curse on this fig-tree, and cause it to wither away. Why  did He do so? Because He wished to impress upon His disciples the  terrible danger of unfruitfulness. If we are the disciples of Jesus,  we must bear good fruit; we must be loving, kind, and gentle, and try,  like Him, to be always doing good.    [Illustration: THE BARREN FIG-TREE.]          THE WICKED HUSBANDMEN.      One day when the priests and elders of the Temple were asking  questions of Jesus, He told them this parable.    There was a certain man who had a vineyard which was hedged or walled  round, and had a tower. But he was going away into a country far off,  so he let the vineyard to a number of husbandmen, or labourers, who  were to give him part of the fruit of the vines. When the time had  come that the fruit was ripe, he sent his servants to the husbandmen  that he might receive his share. But the wicked husbandmen took his  servants, and slew one, and beat another, and stoned the third. Then  he sent other servants, more than before, but the husbandmen served  them as they had done the others. Last of all he sent his own son,  saying, \"They will reverence my son.\" But when those wicked men saw  him coming, they said among themselves, \"This is the heir to all the  vineyard; come, let us kill him and seize on his inheritance.\" So they  caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him.    Then Jesus said to the priests and elders, \"When the Lord of the  vineyard cometh, what will he do unto these husbandmen?\" And they  answered, \"He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let  out his vineyard to others, who shall render him the fruits in their  season.\"    In this parable the owner of the vineyard means God; the vineyard  Canaan, and the husbandmen are the Jews, who had promised to obey Him,  but had not done so. He had sent His prophets among them, to warn  them, but these had been killed. At last He sent His only Son, but  they would not own Him as such, and soon they would kill Him. When the  priests heard this they knew it referred to them, and they were very  angry and would have taken Him and killed Him, but they were afraid of  the people, who took Jesus to be a prophet.    [Illustration: THE WICKED HUSBANDMEN.]          THE WEDDING GARMENT.      There was a certain King who gave a great feast upon the occasion of  his son's wedding. And he sent out his servants to bring in those that  had been invited, but they would not come. Then he sent forth other  servants, saying, \"Tell them which were bidden, 'Behold, I have  prepared my dinner; my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things  are ready. Come unto the feast.'\" But they made light of the message  and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his warehouse; others  took the servants and slew them.    When the King heard what had been done, he was very angry, and sent  out his army to destroy the murderers, and burn up their city. Then  said he to the servants, \"The wedding is ready, but they which were  bidden were not worthy. Go ye therefore into the highways, and all ye  shall find, bid them come to the marriage.\" So they gathered together  as many as they could find. And upon each one, as he entered the  house, was put a beautiful marriage garment, which the King had  prepared. But when the people were all seated, and the King had  entered the house, he saw there a man that had not on a wedding  garment, and he said unto him, \"Friend, how camest thou in hither  without a wedding garment?\" And the man was speechless, for the  garment had been offered to him at first, but he had refused it. Then  said the King to the servants, \"Bind him hand and foot, and take him  away and cast him into outer darkness.\"    In this parable, the King means God, who gave the feast for His Son,  Jesus Christ. Those who were first asked were the Jews, who refused to  believe in Christ. Those who were afterwards brought in, signify the  people who have since listened to His Word, and believed in Him.

Starting afterwards about nine, we soon left the  Castle of Gharian behind, and continued our course in a direction about  south-west, amongst olive-woods and groves of fig-trees. The country was  varied enough in appearance as we proceeded. Great masses of rock and  cultivated slopes alternated. The vegetation seemed all fresh, and  sometimes vigorous. Few birds, except wild pigeons, appeared. Many of  the heights which we passed were crowned with ruined castles, mementoes  of the past dominion of the Arabs. We saw some of the Troglodytes coming  from underground now and then, and pausing to look at us. Their dress is  a simple barracan, or blanket-mantle, thrown around them; few indulge in  the luxury of a shirt; and they go armed with a great thick stick  terminating in a hook. They look cleanly and healthy in spite of their  burrowing life, but are fox-like in character as in manners, and bear a  reputation for dishonesty.    A little after mid-day we descried afar off the village of Kaleebah,  which is built above-ground, and occupies a most commanding position on  a bold mountain-top. It remained in sight ahead a long time, cheating us  with an appearance of nearness. The inhabitants resemble, in all  respects, their mole-brethren, and occupy themselves chiefly in  cultivating olives and barley. Government exacts from them two  imposts--one special, of a hundred and fifty mahboubs on the  olive-crops; and one general, of five hundred mahboubs. We passed the  village at length, and encamped an hour beyond. Here were the last  olive-groves which were to cheer our eyes for many a long month--many a  long year, maybe. Their dark masses covered the swells right and left,  and near at hand isolated trees formed pleasant patches of shadow.    We left our camping-ground at length next day, having overcome the  obstinate sluggishness of the blacks, and marched nearly nine hours. The  barren forms of the desert begin now to appear, the ground being broken  up into huge hills that run mostly in circles, and groups, and broad  stony valleys. The formation is limestone, often containing flints, with  a little sandstone. Patches of barley here and there splashed this arid  surface with green. At a great distance we saw two or three Arab tents,  and one flock of sheep. Towards evening began to appear a number of  beautiful bushy trees, somewhat resembling our oak in size and  appearance. The Arabs call them \"Batoum.\" They do not seem to have yet  received their proper botanical classification. Desfontaines describes  the tree as the _Pistacia Atlanticis_. It greatly resembles the  _Pistacia lentiscus_ of Linnaeus. A few solitary birds, a flight of  crows, lizards and beetles on the ground; no other signs of life.    The next day the country became more barren still, and the batoum  disappeared. The patches of barley likewise ceased to cheer the eye; and  little pools of water no longer sparkled in the rocky bottoms, as near  Kaleebah. The geological formation was nearly the same as yesterday; but  pieces of crystalline gypsum covered the ground, and the limestone here  and there took the form of alabaster. Some of the hills that close in  the huge basin-like valleys are of considerable elevation, and have  conic volcanic forms. All was dreary, and desolate, and sad, except that  some ground-larks whirled about; lizards and beetles still kept crossing  our path; and a single chameleon did not fade into sand-colour in time  to escape notice. No animals of the chase were seen; but our blacks  picked up the dung of the ostrich, and a horn of the aoudad. Here and  there we observed the broken columns of Roman milestones, some of them  covered with illegible inscriptions. The sockets generally remain  perfect. We saluted the memory of the sublime road-makers.    About noon, as we were traversing these solitudes in our usual irregular  order of march, a crowd of moving things came in sight. It proved to be  a slave-caravan, entirely composed of young girls. The Gadamsee  merchants who owned them recognised me, and shook me by the hand. Our  old black woman was soon surrounded by a troop of the poor slave-girls;  and when she related to them how she was returning free to her country  under the protection of the English, and wished them all the same  happiness, they fell round her weeping and kissing her feet. One poor  naked girl had slung at her back a child, with a strange look of  intelligence. I was about to give her a piece of money, but could not;  for, the tears bursting to my eyes, I was obliged to turn away. The  sight of these fragments of families stolen away to become drudges or  victims of brutal passion in a foreign land, invariably produced this  effect upon me. This caravan consisted of some thirty girls and twenty  camel-loads of elephants' teeth. They had been seventy days on their way  from Ghat, including, however, thirty-four days of rest. Most of these  poor wretches had performed journeys on their way to bondage which would  invest me with imperishable renown as a traveller could I accomplish  them.    The caravan was soon lost to view as it wound along the track by which  we had come. This day was exceedingly hot, whereas the previous days had  reminded us of a cool summer in England. The nights have hitherto been  clear, and the zodiacal light is always brilliant. Our blacks keep up  pretty well. There are now nine of them; five men, three women, and a  boy. They eat barley-meal and oil, and now and then get a cup of coffee.  I also feed the Fezzanee marabout, besides those specially attached to  the expedition. As to the camel-drivers, they are an ill-bred,  disobliging set, and I give them nothing extra. How different are our  negroes! They are most cheerful. As we proceed, they run hither and  thither collecting edible herbs; and, like children, making the way more  long in their sport. Sometimes their amusements are less pleasant, and  they seem systematically to take refuge from _ennui_, in a quarrel. Two  of them began to pelt each other with stones to-day; allies dropped in  on either side; laughter was succeeded by execrations; and the whole  caravan at length came to loggerheads.    The sidr, or lote-tree, is abundant in these parts, and it is curious to  notice how in the spring season the green leaves sprout out all over the  white burnt-up shrub. All vegetation in the desert that is not perfectly  new seems utterly withered by time. There is scarcely any medium between  the bud and the dead leaf. Infancy is scorched at once into old age.    As we advanced, the country appeared to put on sterner forms, until  suddenly, in the afternoon, the rocks opened to disclose the Wady  Esh-Shrab nestling amidst limestone hills, and containing the pleasant  oasis of Mizdah. Its beauties consist, in reality, but of a few patches  of green barley and scanty palm-groves; but, in contrast to the sultry  desert, the scene appeared really enchanting.    We have now left the Troglodytes behind us. Mizdah (eight summer and ten  winter days from Ghadamez, three short days from Gharian, and the same  from Benioleed) is built above-ground, and consists of a double village,  or rather two contiguous villages, inhabited by people of the Arab race.  Each division is fortified after a fashion, with walls now crumbling,  and with round crenulated towers. One large tower, some fifty feet high,  has stood, they say, four hundred years. I asked, What was the use of  these fortifications? and was naively told they were for the purposes of  _shamatah_, \"war,\" or rather \"rows.\" And true enough, before the Turks  extended their power so far, these two beggarly villages, fifty miles  from any neighbours, were in constant hostility one with the other. Each  had its great tower, a giant among all the little towers--a kind of  keep, to which the defeated party retired to recruit its strength or  escape utter destruction. This is likewise the case with many other  double towns of the Sahara, and seems to prove that war is the native  passion and trade of man. At any rate, punishment for such turbulence  has not been wanting; for in this, as in so many other cases, whilst  these poor wretches were engaged in cutting one another's throats, the  conqueror has come and established his tyranny. They are now paying the  penalty of their love of shamatah in the shape of an impost of four  hundred mahboubs per annum, and in numbers are reduced to about a  hundred and thirty heads of families.    We had some additional camel-drivers from Kaleebah, who, of course,  endeavoured to extort more than they had agreed for. When we had  squabbled with them a little, we had the honour of receiving Sheikh  Omer, of Mizdah, in the tent. He came with about thirty notables of the  place, the greater part of whom sat outside the doorway, whilst he  stroked his beard within, indulging in a touch of eau de Cologne and a  cup of coffee. We read him the circular-letter of Izhet Pasha, and  received all manner of civilities. The next day, indeed, he came to us  to serve as guide through the country over which he wields delegated  dominion. He had not far to go. His empire is a mere pocket one. The  palm-trees are about three hundred in number, and there are but  half-a-dozen diminutive fields of barley ripening in the ear, fed by  irrigation from several wells which supply tolerably sweet water. A few  onion-beds occur in the little gardens, which are partially shaded by  some small trees.    Sheikh Omer supplied us with copious bowls of milk; the most refreshing  thing, after all, that can be drank in the heat of the day. We were,  however, impatient to get off, but had to wait for a blacksmith to shoe  the horses of our chaouch. The only knowing man in this department was  away at some neighbouring village, and it was necessary to send  messengers to find him. There being nothing better to do, the day,"]]]
