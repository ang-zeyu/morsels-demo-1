[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/172"],[0,"The Haunted Bookshop (#7)"],[1," papers and magazines, the ads of  Meredith's shop and others, and then they come to me to buy them.  I  believe in advertising, but I believe in letting someone else pay for  it.    MIFFLIN--I guess perhaps I can afford to go on riding on Meredith's  ads.  I hadn't thought of that.  But I think I shall put a little  notice in one of the papers some day, just a little card saying                               PARNASSUS AT HOME                           GOOD BOOKS BOUGHT                               AND SOLD                         THIS SHOP IS HAUNTED      It will be fun to see what come-back I get.    QUINCY--The book section of a department store doesn't get much chance  to enjoy that tangential advertising, as Fruehling calls it.  Why, when  our interior decorating shark puts a few volumes of a pirated Kipling  bound in crushed oilcloth or a copy of \"Knock-kneed Stories,\" into the  window to show off a Louis XVIII boudoir suite, display space is  charged up against my department!  Last summer he asked me for  \"something by that Ring fellow, I forget the name,\" to put a punchy  finish on a layout of porch furniture.  I thought perhaps he meant  Wagner's Nibelungen operas, and began to dig them out.  Then I found he  meant Ring Lardner.    GLADFIST--There you are.  I keep telling you bookselling is an  impossible job for a man who loves literature.  When did a bookseller  ever make any real contribution to the world's happiness?    MIFFLIN--Dr. Johnson's father was a bookseller.    GLADFIST--Yes, and couldn't afford to pay for Sam's education.    FRUEHLING--There's another kind of tangential advertising that  interests me.  Take, for instance, a Coles Phillips painting for some  brand of silk stockings.  Of course the high lights of the picture are  cunningly focussed on the stockings of the eminently beautiful lady;  but there is always something else in the picture--an automobile or a  country house or a Morris chair or a parasol--which makes it just as  effective an ad for those goods as it is for the stockings.  Every now  and then Phillips sticks a book into his paintings, and I expect the  Fifth Avenue book trade benefits by it.  A book that fits the mind as  well as a silk stocking does the ankle will be sure to sell.    MIFFLIN--You are all crass materialists.  I tell you, books are the  depositories of the human spirit, which is the only thing in this world  that endures.  What was it Shakespeare said--           Not marble nor the gilded monuments       Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme--      By the bones of the Hohenzollerns, he was right!  And wait a minute!  There's something in Carlyle's Cromwell that comes back to me.    He ran excitedly out of the room, and the members of the Corn Cob  fraternity grinned at each other.  Gladfist cleaned his pipe and poured  out some more cider.  \"He's off on his hobby,\" he chuckled.  \"I love  baiting him.\"    \"Speaking of Carlyle's Cromwell,\" said Fruehling, \"that's a book I  don't often hear asked for.  But a fellow came in the other day hunting  for a copy, and to my chagrin I didn't have one.  I rather pride myself  on keeping that sort of thing in stock.  So I called up Brentano's to  see if I could pick one up, and they told me they had just sold the  only copy they had.  Somebody must have been boosting Thomas!  Maybe  he's quoted in Tarzan, or somebody has bought up the film rights.\"    Mifflin came in, looking rather annoyed.    \"Here's an odd thing,\" he said.  \"I know damn well that copy of  Cromwell was on the shelf because I saw it there last night.  It's not  there now.\"    \"That's nothing,\" said Quincy.  \"You know how people come into a  second-hand store, see a book they take a fancy to but don't feel like  buying just then, and tuck it away out of sight or on some other shelf  where they think no one else will spot it, but they'll be able to find  it when they can afford it.  Probably someone's done that with your  Cromwell.\"    \"Maybe, but I doubt it,\" said Mifflin.  \"Mrs. Mifflin says she didn't  sell it this evening.  I woke her up to ask her.  She was dozing over  her knitting at the desk.  I guess she's tired after her trip.\"    \"I'm sorry to miss the Carlyle quotation,\" said Benson.  \"What was the  gist?\"    \"I think I've got it jotted down in a notebook,\" said Roger, hunting  along a shelf.  \"Yes, here it is.\"  He read aloud:      \"The works of a man, bury them under what guano-mountains and obscene  owl-droppings you will, do not perish, cannot perish.  What of Heroism,  what of Eternal Light was in a Man and his Life, is with very great  exactness added to the Eternities, remains forever a new divine portion  of the Sum of Things.      \"Now, my friends, the bookseller is one of the keys in that universal  adding machine, because he aids in the cross-fertilization of men and  books.  His delight in his calling doesn't need to be stimulated even  by the bright shanks of a Coles Phillips picture.    \"Roger, my boy,\" said Gladfist, \"your innocent enthusiasm makes me  think of Tom Daly's favourite story about the Irish priest who was  rebuking his flock for their love of whisky.  'Whisky,' he said, 'is  the bane of this congregation.  Whisky, that steals away a man's  brains.  Whisky, that makes you shoot at landlords--and not hit them!'  Even so, my dear Roger, your enthusiasm makes you shoot at truth and  never come anywhere near it.\"    \"Jerry,\" said Roger, \"you are a upas tree.  Your shadow is poisonous!\"    \"Well, gentlemen,\" said Mr. Chapman, \"I know Mrs. Mifflin wants to be  relieved of her post.  I vote we adjourn early.  Your conversation is  always delightful, though I am sometimes a bit uncertain as to the  conclusions.  My daughter is going to be a bookseller, and I shall look  forward to hearing her views on the business.\"    As the guests made their way out through the shop, Mr. Chapman drew  Roger aside.  \"It's perfectly all right about sending Titania?\" he  asked.    \"Absolutely,\" said Roger.  \"When does she want to come?\"    \"Is to-morrow too soon?\"    \"The sooner the better.  We've got a little spare room upstairs that  she can have.  I've got some ideas of my own about furnishing it for  her.  Send her round to-morrow afternoon.\"        Chapter III    Titania Arrives      The first pipe after breakfast is a rite of some importance to seasoned  smokers, and Roger applied the flame to the bowl as he stood at the  bottom of the stairs.  He blew a great gush of strong blue reek that  eddied behind him as he ran up the flight, his mind eagerly meditating  the congenial task of arranging the little spare room for the coming  employee.  Then, at the top of the steps, he found that his pipe had  already gone out.  \"What with filling my pipe and emptying it, lighting  it and relighting it,\" he thought, \"I don't seem to get much time for  the serious concerns of life.  Come to think of it, smoking, soiling  dishes and washing them, talking and listening to other people talk,  take up most of life anyway.\"    This theory rather pleased him, so he ran downstairs again to tell it  to Mrs. Mifflin.    \"Go along and get that room fixed up,\" she said, \"and don't try to palm  off any bogus doctrines on me so early in the morning.  Housewives have  no time for philosophy after breakfast.\"    Roger thoroughly enjoyed himself in the task of preparing the  guest-room for the new assistant.  It was a small chamber at the back  of the second storey, opening on to a narrow passage that connected  through a door with the gallery of the bookshop.  Two small windows  commanded a view of the modest roofs of that quarter of Brooklyn, roofs  that conceal so many brave hearts, so many baby carriages, so many cups  of bad coffee, and so many cartons of the Chapman prunes.    \"By the way,\" he called downstairs, \"better have some of the prunes for  supper to-night, just as a compliment to Miss Chapman.\"    Mrs. Mifflin preserved a humorous silence.    Over these noncommittal summits the bright eye of the bookseller, as he  tacked up the freshly ironed muslin curtains Mrs. Mifflin had allotted,  could discern a glimpse of the bay and the leviathan ferries that link  Staten Island with civilization.  \"Just a touch of romance in the  outlook,\" he thought to himself.  \"It will suffice to keep a blasee  young girl aware of the excitements of existence.\"    The room, as might be expected in a house presided over by Helen  Mifflin, was in perfect order to receive any occupant, but Roger had  volunteered to psychologize it in such a fashion as (he thought) would  convey favourable influences to the misguided young spirit that was to  be its tenant.  Incurable idealist, he had taken quite gravely his  responsibility as landlord and employer of Mr. Chapman's daughter.  No  chambered nautilus was to have better opportunity to expand the tender  mansions of its soul.    Beside the bed was a bookshelf with a reading lamp.  The problem Roger  was discussing was what books and pictures might be the best preachers  to this congregation of one.  To Mrs. Mifflin's secret amusement he had  taken down the picture of Sir Galahad which he had once hung there,  because (as he had said) if Sir Galahad were living to-day he would be  a bookseller.  \"We don't want her feasting her imagination on young  Galahads,\" he had remarked at breakfast.  \"That way lies premature  matrimony.  What I want to do is put up in her room one or two good  prints representing actual men who were so delightful in their day that  all the young men she is likely to see now will seem tepid and  prehensile.  Thus she will become disgusted with the present generation  of youths and there will be some chance of her really putting her mind  on the book business.\"    Accordingly he had spent some time in going through a bin where he kept  photos and drawings of authors that the publishers' \"publicity men\"  were always showering upon him.

CONFESSION OF ISABEL BECQUET.    _Isabel_, wife of _Jean le Moygne_, having been put to the question,  at once confessed that she was a Witch: and that upon her getting into  a quarrel with the woman _Girarde_, who was her sister-in-law: the  Devil, in the form of a hare, took occasion to tempt her: appearing to  her in broad daylight in a road near her house: and persuading and  inciting her to give herself to him: and that he would help her to  avenge herself on the said _Girarde_, and everybody else: to which  persuasion she would not at the moment condescend to yield: so he at  once disappeared: but very soon he came again to her in the same road,  and pursuing his previous argument: exhorted her in the same terms as  above: that done, he left her and went away, after having previously  put her a sackful of parsnips; she then took a certain black powder  wrapped in a cloth which he placed; which powder she kept by her. He  appeared to her another time under the same form in the town district,  inciting her anew to give herself to him, but she not wishing to  comply, he next made a request to her to give him some living animal:  whereupon she returned to her dwelling and fetched a chicken, which  she carried to him to the same place where she had left him, and he  took it: and after having thanked her he made an appointment for her  to be present the next morning before daylight at the Sabbath,  promising that he would send for her: according to which promise,  during the ensuing night, the old woman _Collette du Mont_, came to  fetch her, and gave her some black ointment, which she had had from  the Devil; with this (after having stripped herself) she anointed her  back and belly, then having dressed herself again she went out of her  house door: when she was instantly caught up: and carried across  hedges and bushes to the bank on the sea shore, in the neighbourhood  of Rocquaine Castle, the usual place where the Devil kept his Sabbath;  no sooner had she arrived there than the Devil came to her in the  form of a dog, with two great horns sticking up: and with one of his  paws (which seemed to her like hands) took her by the hand: and  calling her by her name told her that she was welcome: then  immediately the Devil made her kneel down: while he himself stood up  on his hind legs; he then made her express detestation of the Eternal  in these words: _I renounce God the Father, God the Son, and God the  Holy Ghost_; and then caused her to worship and invoke himself in  these terms: _Our Great Master, help us!_ with a special compact to be  faithful to him; and when this was done he had connection with her in  the aforesaid form of a dog, but a little larger: then she and the  others danced with him back to back: after having danced, the Devil  poured out of a jug some black wine, which he presented to them in a  wooden bowl, from which she drank, but it did not seem to her so good  as the wine which is usually drunk: there was also bread--but she did  not eat any: confessed that she gave herself to him for a month: they  returned from the Sabbath in the same manner that they went there.    The second time she was at the Sabbath was after the old woman  _Collette_ had been to fetch her, and she anointed herself with the  ointment as above stated;--declared, that on entering the Sabbath, she  again had connection with the Devil and danced with him; after having  danced, and upon his solicitation to prolong the time, she gave  herself to him for three years; at the Sabbath the Devil used to  summon the Wizards and Witches in regular order (she remembered very  well having heard him call the old woman _Collette_ the first, in  these terms: _Madame the Old Woman Becquette_): then the woman  _Fallaise_; and afterwards the woman _Hardie_. Item, he also called  _Marie_, wife of _Massy_, and daughter of the said _Collette_. Said  that after them, she herself was called by the Devil: in these terms:  _The Little Becquette_: she also heard him call there _Collas  Becquet_, son of the said old woman (who [_Collas_] held her by the  hand in dancing, and someone [a woman] whom she did not know, held her  by the other hand): there were about six others there she did not  know: the said old woman was always the nearest to the Devil:  occasionally while some were dancing, others were having connection  with the Devils in the form of dogs; they remained at the Sabbath  about three or four hours, not more.    While at the Sabbath the Devil marked her at the upper part of the  thigh: which mark having been examined by the midwives, they reported  that they had stuck a small pin deeply into it, and that she had not  felt it, and that no blood had issued: she did not know in what part  the Devil had marked the others: those who came first to the place of  the Sabbath, waited for the others; and all the Wizards and Witches  appeared in their proper forms: but blackened and disfigured so that  they could not be recognised.    The Devil appeared sometimes in the form of a goat at the Sabbath;  never saw him in other forms: on their departure he made them kiss him  behind, and asked them when they would come again: he exhorted them  always to be true to him: and to do evil deeds, and to this end he  gave them certain black powders, wrapped in a cloth, for them to throw  upon those whom they wished to bewitch: on leaving the Sabbath, the  Devil went away in one direction and they in the other: after he had  taken them all by the hand: At the instigation of the Devil she threw  some of the powder over several persons and cattle: notably over  _Jean Jehan_, when he came to her house to look for a pig. Item, over  the child of _James Gallienne_, and over others. Item, over the cattle  of _Brouart_, and of others.    It was the Devil that was seen at the said _Gallienne's_ house in the  form of a rat and a weazle, she herself being then in the  neighbourhood of _Gallienne's_ house, and he [the Devil] came to her  in the form of a man, and struck her several blows on the face and  head: by which she was bruised and torn in the way that she was seen  the next day by _Thomas Sohier_. And she believed that the cause of  this maltreatment was because she would not go with the Devil to the  house of the said _Gallienne_.    She never went to the Sabbath except when her husband remained all  night fishing at sea.    Whenever she wanted to bewitch anyone and her powder happened to have  been all used up, the Devil appeared to her and told her to go to such  a place, which he named, for some more, and when she did so, she never  failed to find it there.
