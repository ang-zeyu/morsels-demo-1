The British  and Germans stood their ground stubbornly, while the New England farmers  rushed up to within eight yards of the cannon, and picked off the  men who manned the guns. Stark himself was in the midst of the fray,  fighting with his soldiers, and came out of the conflict so blackened  with powder and smoke that he could hardly be recognized. One desperate  assault succeeded another, while the firing on both sides was so  incessant as to make, in Stark's own words, a \"continuous roar.\" At the  end of two hours the Americans finally swarmed over the intrenchments,  beating down the soldiers with their clubbed muskets. Baum ordered his  infantry with the bayonet and the dragoons with their sabers to force  their way through, but the Americans repulsed this final charge, and  Baum himself fell mortally wounded. All was then over, and the British  forces surrendered.    It was only just in time, for Breymann, who had taken thirty hours to  march some twenty-four miles, came up just after Baum's men had laid  down their arms. It seemed for a moment as if all that had been gained  might be lost. The Americans, attacked by this fresh foe, wavered; but  Stark rallied his line, and putting in Warner, with one hundred and  fifty Vermont men who had just come on the field, stopped Breymann's  advance, and finally forced him to retreat with a loss of nearly one  half his men. The Americans lost in killed and wounded some seventy men,  and the Germans and British about twice as many, but the Americans took  about seven hundred prisoners, and completely wrecked the forces of Baum  and Breymann.    The blow was a severe one, and Burgoyne's army never recovered from  it. Not only had he lost nearly a thousand of his best troops, besides  cannon, arms, and munitions of war, but the defeat affected the spirits  of his army and destroyed his hold over his Indian allies, who began  to desert in large numbers. Bennington, in fact, was one of the most  important fights of the Revolution, contributing as it did so largely to  the final surrender of Burgoyne's whole army at Saratoga, and the utter  ruin of the British invasion from the North. It is also interesting as  an extremely gallant bit of fighting. As has been said, there was no  strategy displayed, and there were no military operations of the higher  kind. There stood the enemy strongly intrenched on a hill, and Stark,  calling his undisciplined levies about him, went at them. He himself was  a man of the highest courage and a reckless fighter. It was Stark who  held the railfence at Bunker Hill, and who led the van when Sullivan's  division poured into Trenton from the river road. He was admirably  adapted for the precise work which was necessary at Bennington, and he  and his men fought well their hand-to-hand fight on that hot August day,  and carried the intrenchments filled with regular troops and defended by  artillery. It was a daring feat of arms, as well as a battle which had  an important effect upon the course of history and upon the fate of the  British empire in America.          KING'S MOUNTAIN         Our fortress is the good greenwood,        Our tent the cypress tree;       We know the forest round us        As seamen know the sea.       We know its walls of thorny vines,        Its glades of reedy grass,       Its safe and silent islands        Within the dark morass.                      --Bryant.      The close of the year 1780 was, in the Southern States, the darkest time  of the Revolutionary struggle. Cornwallis had just destroyed the army of  Gates at Camden, and his two formidable lieutenants, Tarlton the light  horseman, and Ferguson the skilled rifleman, had destroyed or scattered  all the smaller bands that had been fighting for the patriot cause. The  red dragoons rode hither and thither, and all through Georgia and  South Carolina none dared lift their heads to oppose them, while North  Carolina lay at the feet of Cornwallis, as he started through it with  his army to march into Virginia. There was no organized force against  him, and the cause of the patriots seemed hopeless. It was at this hour  that the wild backwoodsmen of the western border gathered to strike a  blow for liberty.    When Cornwallis invaded North Carolina he sent Ferguson into the western  part of the State to crush out any of the patriot forces that might  still be lingering among the foot-hills. Ferguson was a very gallant and  able officer, and a man of much influence with the people wherever  he went, so that he was peculiarly fitted for this scrambling border  warfare. He had under him a battalion of regular troops and several  other battalions of Tory militia, in all eleven or twelve hundred men.  He shattered and drove the small bands of Whigs that were yet in arms,  and finally pushed to the foot of the mountain wall, till he could see  in his front the high ranges of the Great Smokies. Here he learned for  the first time that beyond the mountains there lay a few hamlets of  frontiersmen, whose homes were on what were then called the Western  Waters, that is, the waters which flowed into the Mississippi. To these  he sent word that if they did not prove loyal to the king, he would  cross their mountains, hang their leaders, and burn their villages.    Beyond the, mountains, in the valleys of the Holston and Watauga, dwelt  men who were stout of heart and mighty in battle, and when they heard  the threats of Ferguson they burned with a sullen flame of anger.  Hitherto the foes against whom they had warred had been not the British,  but the Indian allies of the British, Creek, and Cherokee, and Shawnee.  Now that the army of the king had come to their thresholds, they turned  to meet it as fiercely as they had met his Indian allies. Among the  backwoodsmen of this region there were at that time three men of special  note: Sevier, who afterward became governor of Tennessee; Shelby, who  afterward became governor of Kentucky; and Campbell, the Virginian, who  died in the Revolutionary War. Sevier had given a great barbecue, where  oxen and deer were roasted whole, while horseraces were run, and the  backwoodsmen tried their skill as marksmen and wrestlers. In the midst  of the feasting Shelby appeared, hot with hard riding, to tell of the  approach of Ferguson and the British. Immediately the feasting was  stopped, and the feasters made ready for war. Sevier and Shelby sent  word to Campbell to rouse the men of his own district and come without  delay, and they sent messengers to and fro in their own neighborhood to  summon the settlers from their log huts on the stump-dotted clearings  and the hunters from their smoky cabins in the deep woods.    The meeting-place was at the Sycamore Shoals. On the appointed day the  backwoodsmen gathered sixteen hundred strong, each man carrying a long  rifle, and mounted on a tough, shaggy horse. They were a wild and fierce  people, accustomed to the chase and to warfare with the Indians. Their  hunting-shirts of buckskin or homespun were girded in by bead-worked  belts, and the trappings of their horses were stained red and yellow.  At the gathering there was a black-frocked Presbyterian preacher, and  before they started he addressed the tall riflemen in words of burning  zeal, urging them to stand stoutly in the battle, and to smite with the  sword of the Lord and of Gideon. Then the army started, the backwoods  colonels riding in front. Two or three days later, word was brought to  Ferguson that the Back-water men had come over the mountains; that the  Indian-fighters of the frontier, leaving unguarded their homes on the  Western Waters, had crossed by wooded and precipitous defiles to the  help of the beaten men of the plains. Ferguson at once fell back,  sending out messengers for help. When he came to King's Mountain,  a wooded, hog-back hill on the border line between North and South  Carolina, he camped on its top, deeming that there he was safe, for he  supposed that before the backwoodsmen could come near enough to attack  him help would reach him. But the backwoods leaders felt as keenly as  he the need of haste, and choosing out nine hundred picked men, the best  warriors of their force, and the best mounted and armed, they made a  long forced march to assail Ferguson before help could come to him. All  night long they rode the dim forest trails and splashed across the fords  of the rushing rivers. All the next day, October 16, they rode, until in  mid-afternoon, just as a heavy shower cleared away, they came in sight  of King's Mountain. The little armies were about equal in numbers.  Ferguson's regulars were armed with the bayonet, and so were some of his  Tory militia, whereas the Americans had not a bayonet among them; but  they were picked men, confident in their skill as riflemen, and they  were so sure of victory that their aim was not only to defeat the  British but to capture their whole force. The backwoods colonels,  counseling together as they rode at the head of the column, decided to  surround the mountain and assail it on all sides. Accordingly the bands  of frontiersmen split one from the other, and soon circled the craggy  hill where Ferguson's forces were encamped. They left their horses in  the rear and immediately began the battle, swarming forward on foot,  their commanders leading the attack.    The march had been so quick and the attack so sudden that Ferguson had  barely time to marshal his men before the assault was made. Most of  his militia he scattered around the top of the hill to fire down at the  Americans as they came up, while with his regulars and with a few picked  militia he charged with the bayonet in person, first down one side of  the mountain and then down the other. Sevier, Shelby, Campbell, and  the other colonels of the frontiersmen, led each his force of riflemen  straight toward the summit. Each body in turn when charged by the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18647"],[0,"Peeps at Many Lands: Egypt (#7)"],[1,"5 feet high,  erected at the end of the water channel to be supplied; 6 feet or more  below it is the pool or basin cut in the river-bank, and which is kept  supplied with water by a little channel from the river. One end of the  pole is weighted by a big lump of mud; from the other a leather bucket  is suspended by means of a rope of straw, or a second and lighter  pole. In order to raise the water, the shaduf worker, bending his  weight upon the rope, lowers the bucket into the basin below, which,  when filled, is easily raised by the balancing weight, and is emptied  into the channel above. As the river falls the basin can no longer be  fed by the river, so a second \"shaduf\" is erected in order to keep  the first supplied, and in low Nile it is quite a common sight to see  four of these \"shadufs,\" one above the other, employed in raising  the water from the river-level to the high bank above. This work is,  perhaps, the most arduous of any farm labour, and the workers are  almost entirely naked as they toil in the sun, while a screen of  cornstalks is often placed to protect them from the cold north wind.  The water-wheels, or \"sakia,\" as they are called, are of two kinds,  and both ingenious. Each consists of a large wheel placed  horizontally, which is turned by one or more bullocks; the spokes of  this wheel project as cogs, so as to turn another wheel placed below  it at right angles. When used in the fields, the rim of this second  wheel is hollow and divided into segments, each with a mouth or  opening. As the wheel revolves its lower rim is submerged in the well,  filling its segments with water, which, as they reach the top, empty  their contents sideways into a trough, which carries the water to the  little \"genena,\" or watercourse, which supplies the fields. Those used  on the river-bank, however, are too far from the water for such a  wheel to be of use, so in place of the hollow rim the second wheel  also has cogs, on which revolves an endless chain of rope to which  earthen pots are attached, and whose length may be altered to suit the  varying levels of the river. Some of these \"sakias\" are very pretty,  as they are nearly always shaded by trees of some kind as a protection  to the oxen who work them.    [Footnote 5: \"A gift.\"]    [Illustration: A WATERING-PLACE.]    One of the prettiest incidents of all, however, is the village  watering-place, where morning and evening the women and children of  the town congregate to fill their water-pots, wash their clothing or  utensils, and enjoy a chat. It is pretty to watch them as they come  and go; often desperately poor, they wear their ragged, dust-soiled  clothing with a queenly grace, for their lifelong habit of carrying  burdens upon their heads, and their freedom from confining garments,  have given them a carriage which women in this country might well  envy. Though generally dark-skinned and toil-worn, many of the younger  women are beautiful, while all have shapely and delicately-formed  limbs, and eyes and teeth of great beauty. At the water's edge the  children are engaged in scrubbing cooking-pots and other utensils,  while their elders are employed in washing their clothing or domestic  linen, when, after perhaps enjoying a bathe themselves, their  water-pots are filled, and, struggling up the steep bank, they  disappear towards the village. These water-pots, by the way, are  two-handled, and pretty in shape, and are always slightly conical at  the base, so that they are able to stand on the shelving river-banks  without falling, and for the same reason are nearly always carried  slightly sideways on the head. It is pretty to see the wonderful sense  of balance these girls display in carrying their water-pots, which  they seldom touch with their hand, and it is surprising also what  great weights even young girls are able to support, for a \"balass\"  filled with water is often a load too heavy for her to raise to her  head without the assistance of another. Like all the poor, they are  always obliging to each other, and I recently witnessed a pathetic  sight at one of these village watering-places, when an old woman, too  infirm to carry her \"balass\" herself, was with difficulty struggling  down the bank and leading a blind man, who bore her burden for her.          CHAPTER VI    THE NILE--II      The Nile varies considerably in width, from a quarter of a mile, as in  the deep channel before Cairo, to two miles or more higher up, where  the wide space between its high banks, filled to the brim during high  Nile, has almost the appearance of a sea; but as the river falls it is  studded with islands, many of them of considerable extent, and often  under permanent cultivation. The navigable channel is close under one  bank or other, though the shallow water which covers the shoals gives  the river the appearance of being considerably larger than it really  is. In character the scenery is generally placid, and the smooth  water, shimmering under the warm sun which edges the sand-banks with a  gleaming line of silver, is hardly broken by a ripple. I always think  the river prettiest when the Nile is low and the sand-banks appear. In  the shallows pelicans, ibis, heron, and stork are fishing together  without interfering with each other, while large flights of wild-duck  rise splashing from the stream. Eagles soar aloft, or, with the  vultures, alight upon a sand-bank to dispute the possession of some  carcass with the jackals and the foxes. Water wag-tails flit along the  shore, or in the most friendly manner board your steamer to feed on  the crumbs from your tea-table, while large numbers of gay-plumaged  king-fishers dart in and out from their nests tunnelled far into the  precipitous face of the river-bank.    On either side are the eternal hills, beautiful under any effect of  light.    It is astonishing how infinitely varied the Nile scenery is according  to the time of day. In the early morning, mists often hang upon the  water, and the air is bitterly cold, for these sandy wastes which abut  upon the Nile retain little heat by night. Above the cool green of the  banks the high hills rise mysteriously purple against the sunrise, or  catch the first gleam of gold on their rugged bluffs.    As the sun mounts higher a delicate pink tinge suffuses all, and the  hanging mists are dispersed by the growing heat to form little flecks  of white which float in the deep blue of the sky above you. Meanwhile  the life of the river and the fields has recommenced, and the banks  again become animated, and innumerable Nile boats dot the surface of  the stream.    At midday the landscape is enveloped in a white heat, while the bluffs  and buttresses of the rocks cast deep purple shadows on the sweeping  sand-drifts which lie against their base. It is a drowsy effect of  silver and grey, when Nature seems asleep and man and beast alike are  inclined to slumber.    Towards evening, glorified by the warm lights, how rich in colour the  scenery becomes! The western banks, crowned by dense masses of  foliage, whose green appears almost black against the sunset, are  reflected in the water below, its dark surface broken by an  occasional ripple and little masses of foam which have drifted down  from the cataract hundreds of miles away. Beyond the belt of trees the  minarets of some distant village are clear cut against the sky, for  the air is so pure that distance seems to be annihilated. Looking  east, the bold cliffs face the full glory of the sunset, and display a  wonderful transformation of colour, as the white or biscuit-coloured  rocks reflect the slowly changing colour of the light. They gradually  become enveloped in a ruddy glow, in which the shadows of projections  appear an aerial blue, and seem to melt imperceptibly into the glowing  sky above them. Gradually a pearly shadow creeps along the base of the  cliffs or covers the whole range, and one would suppose that the glory  of the sunset was past. In about a quarter of an hour, however,  commences the most beautiful transformation of all, and one which I  think is peculiar to the Nile Valley, for a second glow, more  beautiful and more ethereal than the first, overspreads the hills,  which shine like things translucent against the purple earth-shadow  which slowly mounts in the eastern sky. The sails of the boats on the  river meanwhile have taken on a tint like old ivory, while perhaps a  full moon appears above the hill-tops, and in twisting bars of silver  is reflected in the gently moving water at your feet.    The Nile is not always in so gentle a mood as this, however, for on  most days a strong north wind disturbs the water, and changes the  placid river into one of sparkling animation. The strong wind,  meeting the current of the stream, breaks the water into waves which  are foam-flecked and dash against the muddy cliffs and sand-banks,  while the quickly sailing boats bend to the wind, and from their bluff  and brightly-painted bows toss the sprays high into the air, or turn  the water from their sides in a creamy cataract. The sky also is  flecked with rounded little wind-clouds, whose undersides are  alternately grey or orange as they pass over the cultivated land or  desert rock, whose colour they partially reflect. The colour of the  water also becomes very varied, for the turn of each wave reflects  something of the blue sky above, and the sun shines orange through the  muddy water as it curls, while further variety of tint is given by the  passing cloud-shadows and the intense blueness of the smoother patches  which lie upon the partially covered sand-spits. This always forms a  gay scene, for the river is crowded with vessels which sail quickly,  and take every advantage of the favourable wind. Sometimes the north  wind becomes dangerous in its energy, and wrecks are not infrequent,  while from the south-west, at certain periods of the year, comes the  hot \"khamsin\" wind,"]]]
