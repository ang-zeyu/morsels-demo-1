[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20470"],[0,"Etiquette (#7)"],[1,"ncluded, the  officiating clergyman congratulates the couple, but does not kiss the  bride as formerly.  In the Episcopal Church, and any other churches  where it is the duty of the contracting parties to sign the parish  register, the clergyman, the newly wedded pair, and their witnesses,  now retire to the sacristry for this purpose.  On their return to the  chancel, the organ peals forth the Wedding March; the bride and groom  lead the bridal party in returning down the aisle, the bridesmaids and  ushers following in due order, and after them the nearest relatives;  and all, entering their carriages, are driven at once to the home of  the bride's parents.    After a morning, or \"high noon\" wedding, a \"breakfast\" is usually  served.  If the ceremony has been a nuptial mass, in the Catholic or  High Church ritual, the bridal party have--presumably--observed the  fast, before the mass; therefore, the \"breakfast\" is really a  breakfast.  However, the term is popularly used by non-ritualists, when  the ceremony bears no relation to the mass; and regardless of the fact  that the real breakfast has been taken at the usual hour.    A bride may wear full dress at any hour, day or evening; but  _decollete_ dress is not good form at a church wedding, nor is it  allowed in the Catholic church.  White is the preferred color for a  young bride.  A widow-bride, on the contrary, should choose some other  color; and she wears neither veil nor orange-blossoms.    Details of fashion vary so constantly that specific directions cannot  be given with any assumption of final authority.  A fashionable modiste  should be consulted in the emergency.    The dress worn by a guest at a wedding may be as rich as desired, but  should not have a bridal appearance.  Sometimes a recent bride wears  her own wedding gown at a friend's wedding; but it is in better taste  not to do so, nor in any other way to invite comparisons.  The bride  should be permitted to be the conspicuous figure at her own wedding,  and while her friends may pay her the compliment of wearing handsome  toilettes on that occasion, still, other women should dress just a  little less elaborately, rather than commit the solecism of  \"out-dressing the bride.\"  Fortunately, one may show all delicate  consideration in this matter, and yet be beautifully and becomingly  dressed.          THE ETHICS OF HOSPITALITY    Hospitality shares what it has.  It does not attempt to _give_ what it  _has not_.  The finest hospitality is that which welcomes you to the  fireside and permits you to look upon the picture of a home-life so  little disturbed by your coming that you are at once made to feel  yourself a part of the little symphony--the rare bit of color just  needed to complete the harmonic combination.  With this flattering fact  impressed upon your glowing memory you will hardly be able to recall  the material adjuncts of the occasion.  It is a sign of a gross nature  to measure hospitality by the loaves and fishes, forgetting the miracle  that goes with them.  And it is equally a mistake for a host to be  afraid to offer humble entertainment when richer offers are beyond his  means.  To a refined perception \"the life is more than the meat,\" and  the personality of the host, not the condition of his larder, decides  whether or not it is an honor to be his guest.  Delightful though it be  to be able to afford one's guest a rare and beautiful entertainment,  one must dismiss the idea that a graceful and acceptable hospitality  depends on material things.  Sir Launfal, sharing his crust with the  beggar at the gate, was still Sir Launfal.  The impoverished hostess  may preside at her frugal board with the spirit and the manner of a  queen, whereas the coarse-fibred vulgarian vainly heaps his platters  with choicest game and rarest fruit, the while he serves the banquet  like the churl that he is.    Whatever your entertainment, rich or poor, remember, first of all, to  give _yourself_ to your guest; then, if he is appreciative, he will not  criticise your simple dinner, nor grumble at the flavor of your wine.  One of the wits of the day has gravely reported that at a banquet in  the Athens of America, \"the _menu_ consisted of two baked beans and  readings from Emerson.\"  Despite its grotesque exaggeration, the _mot_  contains the kernel of a dignified truth: that material things are of  secondary importance on all social occasions worthy of the name.    The most expensive entertainment given by any one should be merely an  incidental illustration of his already recognized financial means.  It  should never be so beyond his usual ability as to arouse among his  neighbors the wonder, how he could afford it?  When people who are  known to have only a moderate income give \"spreads\" disproportionate to  their daily mode of living, the thoughtful observer instinctively  questions their taste and good sense.  Usually such ostentatious  display brings more or less derision on the ones who are foolish enough  to spend more money to make their neighbors stare for a day than they  use to make themselves comfortable for a year.  No matter how elaborate  the entertainment the guests should not be allowed to suspect that  their host has exhausted his resources, or that he might not be able to  do this same thing at any time that he chose.    As already suggested, the character of the entertainment in a private  house should never be such as to involve a total departure from the  habitual customs of the household.  It is granted that provision must  be made on a grander scale for larger numbers; the _quantity_ of things  will necessarily be augmented, and mere bulk wears a certain air of the  imposing, and when to this is added the vital element--the magnetism of  a brilliant company--the participant will seem to breathe a rarified  atmosphere, and to an extent to be exalted above the level of everyday  life.  Yet that level should not be lost to sight nor cease to be the  basis of measurement.  The quality of elegant serving and mannerly  eating should be just what is every day observed at the family dinner  of the same household.  The guest should get a correct idea of the home  atmosphere of the house, even though it be slightly congealed by the  formality and reserve which the presence of strangers naturally  inspires.    When people assume to entertain socially they should not give a false  showing of themselves or of their means.  The proudest spirit  acknowledges the limitations of poverty with dignified truthfulness; it  is the moral coward who seeks to hide these limitations by a greater  display than his circumstances warrant.  And he reaps as he sows.  His  \"entertainments\" fill an idle hour for the class of visitors who  gravitate mainly to the supper-room, while the giver of the feast,  under the tension of this social effort, suffers a weariness of the  spirit as well as of the flesh, and gives a sigh of relief when the  door closes upon the last guest, and the pitiful farce is declared  \"over.\"  We wonder \"Why do they thus spend their strength for that  which profiteth not?\"  Surely, few things in the course of a misspent  life are less profitable than such over-strained efforts at showy  entertainment.  The \"banquet hall deserted\" presents on the following  day a grim reminder of the petty economies that for weeks hence must  secretly be contrived in order to restore the balance of an overdrawn  bank account.  The folly of _living_ beyond one's means may have this  extenuating feature, that it is often an error due to generous, though  indiscreet impulse, or to inexperience; but the folly of spending money  lavishly on a few ostentatious \"spreads\" that are \"beyond one's means\"  has no redeeming points.  The deception seldom long deceives.  It is a  social blunder, the effect of which is to depreciate rather than to  enhance the social importance of the family thus entertaining.    It will be understood that this refers to cases when the motive of  extravagance is to gratify vanity.  It does not mean to imply that the  Christmas dinner, or the birthday party, or the wedding anniversary may  not be a time when all the energies of a poor and usually frugal  household may be concentrated to prepare for one occasion of feasting  and rejoicing.  The Cratchetts may have their roast goose; even the  Micawbers may be indulged in their occasional banquet.  And the  carefully planned birthday party may be all the more gratefully  appreciated by the honored one when it is known that every choice  provision for the occasion represents some thoughtful contriving and  some self-sacrifice prompted by affection.  Such occasions are  \"red-letter days\" in the homes of people of limited means; and pathos  is never more delicately suggested than when the poor man forgets his  poverty in the wealth of a home-gathering and a feast of remembrance.  \"Let not a stranger intermeddle with their joy.\"    In the two cases the financial conditions may seem to be parallel, but  in essential spirit there is no resemblance.  What is done from  sentiment and affection is above commercial measurement.  What is done  for the sake of ostentation is, by its own act, made a legitimate  object of popular criticism.    Another point of good taste in entertaining is that one who is  wealthier than others of his social circle should not conspicuously  outshine his neighbors by giving them a kind and degree of  entertainment which will make their return of civilities seem poor and  mean by comparison.  Unless the rich man is so greatly beyond others in  the scale of wealth that comparisons cease to be odious, it is more  considerate for him to keep within the degree of expense and display  possible to the average of his associates.    There is still another reason why the very rich should be chary of  giving magnificent entertainments.

It's a boy with  a note.\"    Anne looked frightened as she opened a soiled looking envelope the boy  handed her.    \"Is anything the matter?\" asked Jessica, seeing the expression of fear  on her face.    \"No--yes----,\" answered poor little Anne, undecidedly. \"I must go home,  or rather I mustn't go the way I came. Don't you think I could leave at  a side entrance? I don't want to see the person who is waiting for me in  front.\"    \"Of course, child,\" spoke up Grace. \"We'll see you home ourselves. Won't  we, girls!\"    \"Wait until I lock up my motor cycle and I'll go along,\" called David.  \"We'll all protect Miss Anne.\"    \"Tell him,\" said Anne to the boy, putting the note back in the envelope  and giving it to him, \"that what he asks is impossible.\"    \"Couldn't you squeeze us into the carriage, mother?\" asked David,  returning presently with his hat.    \"I have invited Miss Leece to drive home with us, mother,\" interrupted  Miriam, giving her brother a blighting glance. \"There is room for only  one more person. Perhaps Jessica will take it.\"    \"You are very kind,\" said Jessica coldly, \"but I prefer to walk with the  girls.\"    \"_You'd_ better walk, too, cross-patch, and learn a few manners from  your friends,\" was David's parting advice to his sister.    \"Children, children!\" exclaimed Mrs. Nesbit, \"don't, I beg of you,  quarrel in public.\"    Presently the five young people had slipped out of a side door of the  gymnasium and started down a back street in the direction of Anne's  house. They had not gone far, however, before they became aware that  they were being followed. Grace was the first to call the attention of  Nora and Jessica to a long, slim figure stealing after them in the  shadows.    \"Here he comes,\" whispered Jessica. \"What in the world do you suppose he  wants with our poor little Anne?\"    \"I believe he's going to stop us,\" returned Grace. \"He is coming nearer  and nearer.\"    \"Anne, I command you to wait!\" called a voice from behind them.    They all stopped suddenly and Anne jumped as though she had received a  shock.    A tall, theatrical-looking individual had come up to them. He wore a  shabby frock coat and a black slouch hat, which he raised with an  elaborate flourish when he saw the young girls.    \"Pardon me, ladies,\" he said, \"but I wish to speak with my daughter.\"    Anne controlled herself with an effort.    \"I cannot see you now, father,\" she said. \"It is quite late and I must  get back.\"    \"You shall not only speak to me but you shall come with me,\" exclaimed  the man, with a sudden flare of anger. \"I will not submit to  disobedience again. Come at once!\"    \"Father, I cannot go with you,\" cried Anne, clinging to her friends. \"I  would rather be with mother and Mary. They need me more than you do and  I want to go to school and study to be a teacher.\"    The man was now beside himself with theatrical rage.    \"Miserable child!\" he cried, waving his arms wildly. \"I shall take you  if I must by force.\" Breaking through the group, he seized the hand of  his daughter and dragged her after him.    \"Oh, save me!\" cried the poor girl, struggling to release herself.    \"I can't stand this! If she doesn't want to go with him, she shan't,  father or no father,\" growled David, dashing after the pair.    \"Stop, sir!\" he cried, seizing Anne's other hand. \"I must ask you to  release this young lady at once.\"    \"Insolent boy!\" cried the other, giving each word an oratorical  flourish, \"are you not aware that this young lady, as you call her, is  merely a child, and that she happens to be my daughter? I cannot see  that you have a right to interfere in a family matter.\"    \"But I have no proof that Miss Pierson is your daughter,\" retorted  David. \"It is enough that she doesn't want to go with you. I undertook  to see her safely to her own home, this evening, and I mean to do it.  After that you may settle your difficulties as you please.\"    \"Miserable upstart!\" cried the man, now so thoroughly angry that he let  go Anne's hand, \"I have a good mind to give you what you deserve. As for  you, undutiful, wretched girl,\" he added, his voice rising to an  emotional tremolo, \"you shall be well punished for this!\"    \"Don't wait,\" whispered Anne. \"If we run, we can get away, now, while he  is so angry.\" At that they all took to their heels, David following  after them, much relieved to have given Anne's father the slip without  further disagreeable argument.    No one spoke until they had reached the Pierson cottage and had seen  Anne safely to the front door.    \"I'm so sorry!\" she exclaimed at last, trying not to cry. \"I wouldn't  for anything have had it happen, and just when you were all beginning to  like me a little. Will you forgive me?\"    \"Forgive you, Anne!\" cried Grace. \"It wasn't your fault. We are only  awfully sorry for you.\"    \"We will just forget all about it, and never speak of it to anyone,\"  promised Jessica, taking the girl's hand kindly.    \"But I want you to understand that I was right in not going,\" protested  Anne. \"Some day I will explain.\"    \"Of course you were right,\" said David, \"and I hope you will never be  persuaded to go.\"    \"Thank you, all, a thousand times!\" came gratefully from Anne; \"and good  night.\" Then she disappeared into the cottage.    \"Well, this was a night's adventure,\" observed Grace, as they started  homeward.    \"I am afraid Anne's father is a night's adventurer,\" muttered David. \"He  looks mightily like one of those strolling actors who go barnstorming  through country towns.\"    \"Poor Anne! Do you suppose he wants her to barnstorm?\" asked Nora.    \"I haven't a doubt of it,\" replied the young man. \"I think you girls had  better adopt that poor child and look after her.\"    \"We have already,\" answered Grace. \"Didn't Miriam tell you about it?\"    \"Miriam? No; she never tells me anything. Besides, what has she to do  with it?\"    The girls were silent.    \"By the way,\" continued Grace, \"speaking of barnstorming, we want to ask  your advice, David. The sophomores played a mean trick on us the other  day at the old Omnibus House.\"    \"I heard something about the Black Monks of Asia,\" answered David,  laughing.    \"Can't your inventive brain devise a scheme of revenge?\" went on Grace.  \"If we don't get even with them soon, the story will be all over town.\"    \"Well,\" replied David, \"I can tell you a secret I happened to have  overheard when one of the sophomores was calling on Miriam. I was an  eavesdropper entirely by accident, but what I heard might help some. The  sophomores are going to give an initiation mask ball a week from  Saturday night. Only the class and a few outsiders, among them Miriam,  are to be present. Everybody is to be in fancy dress, and disguised out  of all recognition. Can't you work up a scheme with that to go upon,  girls?\"    \"We certainly can,\" cried Nora. \"It's the chance of a lifetime.\"    \"Just wait and see!\" exclaimed Grace.    \"By the way, David, you didn't happen to overhear the password, did  you?\" asked Jessica.    \"I did,\" he replied. \"Nothing escaped me, for I was caught in a trap.  You know I don't care for that large, husky young damsel who leads the  sophomores, and if I had made my presence behind the screen known, I  should have had to speak to her. So I just sat still and said nothing.  The password is 'Asia.'\"    \"They are trying to rub it in, I suppose,\" cried Grace. \"But I think  they won't be so ready to use that word after their old ball is over.\"    \"If you want any help,\" offered David as he left Grace at her front  door, \"you know where to come for it, don't you?\"    \"You're a true brick, David!\" said Grace. \"Good night.\"          CHAPTER VI    THE SOPHOMORE BALL      There was an undercurrent of excitement in the air on the day of the  sophomore ball.    The sophomores themselves were full of secrets, whispering around in  groups, their faces grave with self-important expressions. This was to  be their annual Initiation Ball, and many new members, after receiving  initiation into the various sophomore societies, were to be invited to  the gymnasium, which had been turned over to the class for the evening.    There was no end to the fun of these balls, according to feminine  gossip, for no male was ever admitted and only three invitations were  issued to girls of other classes. It was, in fact, to be nothing but fun  and frolic, and every costume had been planned weeks ahead.    One teacher was asked to be present to keep order in case of intrusion,  for the gymnasium door, on that famous night, was always besieged by  youths from the Boys' High School, who roared and jeered as each cloaked  and masked figure rushed under the archway and disappeared.    The freshmen, all through the day, were unusually quiet. They kept to  themselves and had little to say. Miriam and her three particular  friends were carefully avoided by their classmates. Miriam, herself,  felt the snub at once. Had she, after all, made a mistake, and was she  losing ground in the class? But her vanity was like a life buoy to her  sinking hopes. She refused to see that the other girls regarded her with  growing dislike.    When school was over, that afternoon, six girls strolled down the High  School walk arm in arm. They were Grace and her three chums and two  other girls who were popular in the freshman class.    Anne's small figure seemed almost dwarfed next to Grace, who towered  half a foot above her. Ever since Anne's trying scene with her father,  Grace had been doubly tender and kind to her, until the young girl  seemed to expand under the"]]]
