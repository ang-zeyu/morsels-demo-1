[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17388"],[0,"Andrew Marvell (#7)"],[1,"lawyer and  genealogist of the family, lived at no great distance with no less than  fourteen children. There were also sisters of Lord Fairfax, with  families of their own, all settled in the same part of the county.    Such were the agreeable surroundings of our poet for two years,  1650-1652. I must leave it to the imaginations of my readers to fill up  the picture, for excepting the poems, which we may safely assume were  written at Nunappleton House, and--who can doubt it?--read aloud to its  inmates, there is nothing more to be said.    Before considering the Nunappleton poetry, a word must be got in of  bibliography. College exercises and complimentary verses excepted,  Marvell printed none of his verse under his own name in his lifetime. So  far as his themes were political there is no need to wonder at this.  Indeed, the wonder is how, despite their anonymity, their author kept  his ears; but why the Nunappleton verse should have remained in  manuscript for more than thirty years is hard to explain.    Until Pope took his muse to market, poetry, apart from the drama, had no  direct commercial value, or one too small to be ranked as a motive for  publication. None the less, the age loved distinction and appreciated  wit, and to be known as a poet whose verses \"numbered good intellects\"  was to gain the _entree_ to the society of men both of intellect and  fashion, and also, not infrequently, snug berths in the public service,  and secretaryships to foreign missions and embassies. Thus there was  always, in addition to natural vanity, a strong motive for a  seventeenth-century poet to publish his poems. To-day one would hesitate  to recommend a young man who wanted to get on in the world to publish a  volume of verse; but the age of \"wit\" and \"parts\" is over.    It was not till 1681--three years after Marvell's death--that the small  folio appeared with a fine portrait, still dear to the collector, which  contains for the first time what may be called the \"garden-poetry\" of  our author, together with some specimens of his political and satirical  versification.    Marvell's most famous poem--_The Ode upon Cromwell's Return from  Ireland_--is not included in the 1681 volume, and remained in manuscript  until 1776, as also did the poem upon Cromwell's death.    The remainder of the political poems, which had made their first  appearance as broadsheets, were reprinted after the Revolution in the  well-known _Collection of Poems on Affairs of State_.[35:1] These verses  were never owned by Marvell, and it is probable that some of them,  though attributed to him, are not his at all. We have only tradition to  go by. In the case of political satires, squibs, epigrams, rough popular  occasional rhymes flung off both in haste and heat to be sold with old  ballads in the market-place, we need not seek for better evidence than  tradition, which indeed is often the only external evidence we have for  the authorship of much more important things.    Now to return to the Nunappleton poetry.    In a poem of 776 lines Marvell tells the story and describes the charms  of the house which Lord Fairfax built for himself during the war, and to  which, as just narrated, he retired in the summer of 1650. The story is  only too familiar a one, being writ large over many a fine property.  Appleton House was Church loot. In the time of Henry, \"the majestic lord  that burst the bonds of Rome,\" the old house at Nunappleton was a  Cistercian nunnery, a religious house. In 1542 the community was  suppressed and its property appropriated by the great-grandfather of the  Lord-General--one Sir Thomas Fairfax. The religious buildings were  pulled down and a new secular house rose in their place. In these bare  and sordid facts there is not much room for poetry, but there is a story  thrown in. Shortly before 1518 a Yorkshire heiress, bearing the  unromantic name of Isabella Thwaites, was living in the Cistercian  abbey, under the guardianship of the abbess, the Lady Anna Langton.  Property under the care of the Church is always supposed to be in  danger, and the Lady Anna was freely credited with the desire to make a  nun of her ward, and so keep her broad acres in Wharfedale and her  messuages in York for the use of Mother Church. None the less, the young  lady was allowed to go about and visit her neighbours, and whilst so  doing she fell in love with Sir William Fairfax, or he fell in love with  her or with her estates. Thereupon, so the story proceeds, the abbess  kept her ward a close prisoner within the nunnery walls. Legal  proceedings were taken, but in the end the privacy of the nunnery was  invaded, and Miss Thwaites was abducted and married to Sir William  Fairfax at the church of Bolton Percy. The lady abbess had to submit to  _vis major_, but worse days were in front of her, for she lived on to  see the nunnery itself despoiled, and the fair domains she had during a  long life preserved and maintained for religious uses handed over to the  son of her former ward, Isabella Thwaites.    Our poet begins by referring to the modest dimensions of the house, and  the natural charms of its surroundings:--        \"The house was built upon the place,      Only as for a mark of grace,      And for an inn to entertain      Its Lord awhile, but not remain.      Him Bishop's-hill or Denton may,      Or Billborow, better hold than they:      But Nature here hath been so free,      As if she said, 'Leave this to me.'      Art would more neatly have defac'd      What she had laid so sweetly waste      In fragrant gardens, shady woods,      Deep meadows, and transparent floods.\"    And then starts the story:--        \"While, with slow eyes, we these survey,      And on each pleasant footstep stay,      We opportunely may relate      The progress of this house's fate.      A nunnery first gave it birth,      (For virgin buildings oft brought forth)      And all that neighbour-ruin shows      The quarries whence this dwelling rose.      Near to this gloomy cloister's gates,      There dwelt the blooming virgin Thwaites,      Fair beyond measure, and an heir,      Which might deformity make fair;      And oft she spent the summer's suns      Discoursing with the subtle Nuns,      Whence, in these words, one to her weav'd,      As 'twere by chance, thoughts long conceiv'd:      'Within this holy leisure, we      Live innocently, as you see.      These walls restrain the world without,      But hedge our liberty about;      These bars inclose that wilder den      Of those wild creatures, called men,      The cloister outward shuts its gates,      And, from us, locks on them the grates.      Here we, in shining armour white,      Like virgin amazons do fight,      And our chaste lamps we hourly trim,      Lest the great Bridegroom find them dim.      Our orient breaths perfumed are      With incense of incessant prayer;      And holy-water of our tears      Most strangely our complexion clears;      Not tears of grief, but such as those      With which calm pleasure overflows;      Or pity, when we look on you      That live without this happy vow.      How should we grieve that must be seen      Each one a spouse, and each a queen,      And can in heaven hence behold      Our brighter robes and crowns of gold!      When we have prayed all our beads,      Some one the holy Legend reads,      While all the rest with needles paint      The face and graces of the Saint;      Some of your features, as we sewed,      Through every shrine should be bestowed,      And in one beauty we would take      Enough a thousand Saints to make.      And (for I dare not quench the fire      That me does for your good inspire)      'Twere sacrilege a man to admit      To holy things for heaven fit.      I see the angels in a crown      On you the lilies showering down;      And round about you glory breaks,      That something more than human speaks.      All beauty when at such a height,      Is so already consecrate.      Fairfax I know, and long ere this      Have marked the youth, and what he is;      But can he such a rival seem,      For whom you heaven should disesteem?      Ah, no! and 'twould more honour prove      He your devoto were than Love.      Here live beloved and obeyed,      Each one your sister, each your maid,      And, if our rule seem strictly penned,      The rule itself to you shall bend.      Our Abbess, too, now far in age,      Doth your succession near presage.      How soft the yoke on us would lie,      Might such fair hands as yours it tie!      Your voice, the sweetest of the choir,      Shall draw heaven nearer, raise us higher,      And your example, if our head,      Will soon us to perfection lead.      Those virtues to us all so dear,      Will straight grow sanctity when here;      And that, once sprung, increase so fast,      Till miracles it work at last.'\"    What reply was given by the heiress to these arguments, and others of a  still more seductive hue, the poet does not tell, but turns to the eager  lover who asks, What should he do? He hints that a nunnery is no place  for a virtuous maid, and that the nuns (unlike himself, I hope) are only  thinking of her property. He complains that though the Court has  authorised him to use either peace or force, the nuns still stand upon  their guard.        \"Ill-counselled women, do you know      Whom you resist or what you do?\"    Using a most remarkable poetic licence, the poet refers to the fact that  this barred-out lover is to be the progenitor of the great Lord Fairfax.        \"Is not this he, whose offspring fierce      Shall fight through all the universe;      And with successive valour try      France, Poland, either Germany,      Till one, as long since prophesied,      His horse through conquered Britain ride?\"    The lover determines to take the place by assault. It was not a very  heroic enterprise, as Marvell describes it.        \"Some to the breach, against"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17396"],[0,"The Secret Garden (#7)"],[1,"of the things which made her  feel sour and cross. She seemed to find it out when the robin looked at  her and she looked at the robin.    The old gardener pushed his cap back on his bald head and stared at her  a minute.    \"Art tha' th' little wench from India?\" he asked.    Mary nodded.    \"Then no wonder tha'rt lonely. Tha'lt be lonelier before tha's done,\" he  said.    He began to dig again, driving his spade deep into the rich black garden  soil while the robin hopped about very busily employed.    \"What is your name?\" Mary inquired.    He stood up to answer her.    \"Ben Weatherstaff,\" he answered, and then he added with a surly chuckle,  \"I'm lonely mysel' except when he's with me,\" and he jerked his thumb  toward the robin. \"He's th' only friend I've got.\"    \"I have no friends at all,\" said Mary. \"I never had. My Ayah didn't like  me and I never played with any one.\"    It is a Yorkshire habit to say what you think with blunt frankness, and  old Ben Weatherstaff was a Yorkshire moor man.    \"Tha' an' me are a good bit alike,\" he said. \"We was wove out of th'  same cloth. We're neither of us good lookin' an' we're both of us as  sour as we look. We've got the same nasty tempers, both of us, I'll  warrant.\"    This was plain speaking, and Mary Lennox had never heard the truth about  herself in her life. Native servants always salaamed and submitted to  you, whatever you did. She had never thought much about her looks, but  she wondered if she was as unattractive as Ben Weatherstaff and she also  wondered if she looked as sour as he had looked before the robin came.  She actually began to wonder also if she was \"nasty tempered.\" She felt  uncomfortable.    Suddenly a clear rippling little sound broke out near her and she turned  round. She was standing a few feet from a young apple-tree and the robin  had flown on to one of its branches and had burst out into a scrap of a  song. Ben Weatherstaff laughed outright.    \"What did he do that for?\" asked Mary.    \"He's made up his mind to make friends with thee,\" replied Ben. \"Dang me  if he hasn't took a fancy to thee.\"    \"To me?\" said Mary, and she moved toward the little tree softly and  looked up.    \"Would you make friends with me?\" she said to the robin just as if she  was speaking to a person. \"Would you?\" And she did not say it either in  her hard little voice or in her imperious Indian voice, but in a tone so  soft and eager and coaxing that Ben Weatherstaff was as surprised as she  had been when she heard him whistle.    \"Why,\" he cried out, \"tha' said that as nice an' human as if tha' was a  real child instead of a sharp old woman. Tha' said it almost like Dickon  talks to his wild things on th' moor.\"    \"Do you know Dickon?\" Mary asked, turning round rather in a hurry.    \"Everybody knows him. Dickon's wanderin' about everywhere. Th' very  blackberries an' heather-bells knows him. I warrant th' foxes shows him  where their cubs lies an' th' skylarks doesn't hide their nests from  him.\"    Mary would have liked to ask some more questions. She was almost as  curious about Dickon as she was about the deserted garden. But just that  moment the robin, who had ended his song, gave a little shake of his  wings, spread them and flew away. He had made his visit and had other  things to do.    \"He has flown over the wall!\" Mary cried out, watching him. \"He has  flown into the orchard--he has flown across the other wall--into the  garden where there is no door!\"    \"He lives there,\" said old Ben. \"He came out o' th' egg there. If he's  courtin', he's makin' up to some young madam of a robin that lives among  th' old rose-trees there.\"    \"Rose-trees,\" said Mary. \"Are there rose-trees?\"    Ben Weatherstaff took up his spade again and began to dig.    \"There was ten year' ago,\" he mumbled.    \"I should like to see them,\" said Mary. \"Where is the green door? There  must be a door somewhere.\"    Ben drove his spade deep and looked as uncompanionable as he had looked  when she first saw him.    \"There was ten year' ago, but there isn't now,\" he said.    \"No door!\" cried Mary. \"There must be.\"    \"None as any one can find, an' none as is any one's business. Don't you  be a meddlesome wench an' poke your nose where it's no cause to go.  Here, I must go on with my work. Get you gone an' play you. I've no more  time.\"    And he actually stopped digging, threw his spade over his shoulder and  walked off, without even glancing at her or saying good-by.          CHAPTER V    THE CRY IN THE CORRIDOR      At first each day which passed by for Mary Lennox was exactly like the  others. Every morning she awoke in her tapestried room and found Martha  kneeling upon the hearth building her fire; every morning she ate her  breakfast in the nursery which had nothing amusing in it; and after each  breakfast she gazed out of the window across to the huge moor which  seemed to spread out on all sides and climb up to the sky, and after she  had stared for a while she realized that if she did not go out she would  have to stay in and do nothing--and so she went out. She did not know  that this was the best thing she could have done, and she did not know  that, when she began to walk quickly or even run along the paths and  down the avenue, she was stirring her slow blood and making herself  stronger by fighting with the wind which swept down from the moor. She  ran only to make herself warm, and she hated the wind which rushed at  her face and roared and held her back as if it were some giant she could  not see. But the big breaths of rough fresh air blown over the heather  filled her lungs with something which was good for her whole thin body  and whipped some red color into her cheeks and brightened her dull eyes  when she did not know anything about it.    But after a few days spent almost entirely out of doors she wakened one  morning knowing what it was to be hungry, and when she sat down to her  breakfast she did not glance disdainfully at her porridge and push it  away, but took up her spoon and began to eat it and went on eating it  until her bowl was empty.    \"Tha' got on well enough with that this mornin', didn't tha'?\" said  Martha.    \"It tastes nice to-day,\" said Mary, feeling a little surprised herself.    \"It's th' air of th' moor that's givin' thee stomach for tha' victuals,\"  answered Martha. \"It's lucky for thee that tha's got victuals as well as  appetite. There's been twelve in our cottage as had th' stomach an'  nothin' to put in it. You go on playin' you out o' doors every day an'  you'll get some flesh on your bones an' you won't be so yeller.\"    \"I don't play,\" said Mary. \"I have nothing to play with.\"    \"Nothin' to play with!\" exclaimed Martha. \"Our children plays with  sticks and stones. They just runs about an' shouts an' looks at things.\"    Mary did not shout, but she looked at things. There was nothing else to  do. She walked round and round the gardens and wandered about the paths  in the park. Sometimes she looked for Ben Weatherstaff, but though  several times she saw him at work he was too busy to look at her or was  too surly. Once when she was walking toward him he picked up his spade  and turned away as if he did it on purpose.    One place she went to oftener than to any other. It was the long walk  outside the gardens with the walls round them. There were bare  flower-beds on either side of it and against the walls ivy grew thickly.  There was one part of the wall where the creeping dark green leaves were  more bushy than elsewhere. It seemed as if for a long time that part had  been neglected. The rest of it had been clipped and made to look neat,  but at this lower end of the walk it had not been trimmed at all.    A few days after she had talked to Ben Weatherstaff Mary stopped to  notice this and wondered why it was so. She had just paused and was  looking up at a long spray of ivy swinging in the wind when she saw a  gleam of scarlet and heard a brilliant chirp, and there, on the top of  the wall, perched Ben Weatherstaff's robin redbreast, tilting forward  to look at her with his small head on one side.    \"Oh!\" she cried out, \"is it you--is it you?\" And it did not seem at all  queer to her that she spoke to him as if she was sure that he would  understand and answer her.    He did answer. He twittered and chirped and hopped along the wall as if  he were telling her all sorts of things. It seemed to Mistress Mary as  if she understood him, too, though he was not speaking in words. It was  as if he said:    \"Good morning! Isn't the wind nice? Isn't the sun nice? Isn't everything  nice? Let us both chirp and hop and twitter. Come on! Come on!\"    Mary began to laugh, and as he hopped and took little flights along the  wall she ran after him. Poor little thin, sallow, ugly Mary--she  actually looked almost pretty for a moment.    \"I like you! I like you!\" she cried out, pattering down the walk; and  she chirped and tried to whistle, which last she did not know how to do  in the least. But the robin seemed to be quite satisfied and chirped and  whistled back at her. At last he spread his wings and made a darting  flight to the top of a tree, where he perched and sang loudly.    That reminded Mary of the first time she had seen him. He had been  swinging on a tree-top then and she had been standing in the orchard.  Now she was on the other side of the orchard and standing in the path  outside a wall--much lower down--and there was the same tree inside.    \"It's in the garden no one can go into,\" she said to herself. \"It's the  garden without a door. He lives in there. How I wish I could see what it  is like!\"    She ran up the walk to the green door she had entered the first morning.  Then she ran down the path through the other door and then into the  orchard, and when she stood and looked up there was the tree on the  other side of the wall, and there was the robin just finishing his song  and beginning to preen his feathers with"]]]
