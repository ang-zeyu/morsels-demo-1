Publishers vied with each other in  producing his works, and their performance was greeted with great  audiences and enthusiastic applause. His last ten years were a peaceful  and beautiful ending of a stormy career.      VIII.    Thought lingers pleasantly over this sunset period. Handel throughout  life was so wedded to his art, that he cared nothing for the delights of  woman's love. His recreations were simple--rowing, walking, visiting his  friends, and playing on the organ. He would sometimes try to play the  people out at St. Paul's Cathedral, and hold them indefinitely. He would  resort at night to his favorite tavern, the \"Queen's Head,\" where  he would smoke and drink beer with his chosen friends. Here he would  indulge in roaring conviviality and fun, and delight his friends with  sparkling satire and pungent humor, of which he was a great master,  helped by his amusing compound of English, Italian, and German. Often  he would visit the picture galleries, of which he was passionately fond.  His clumsy but noble figure could be seen almost any morning rolling  through Charing Cross; and every one who met old Father Handel treated  him with the deepest reverence.    The following graphic narrative, taken from the \"Somerset House  Gazette,\" offers a vivid portraiture. Schoelcher, in his \"Life of  Handel,\" says that \"its author had a relative, Zachary Hardcastle,  a retired merchant, who was intimately acquainted with all the  most distinguished men of his time, artists, poets, musicians, and  physicians.\" This old gentleman, who lived at Paper Buildings, was  accustomed to take his morning walk in the garden of Somerset House,  where he happened to meet with another old man, Colley Cibber, and  proposed to him to go and hear a competition which was to take place  at midday for the post of organist to the Temple, and he invited him to  breakfast, telling him at the same time that Dr. Pepusch and Dr.  Arne were to be with him at nine o'clock. They go in; Pepusch arrives  punctually at the stroke of nine; presently there is a knock, the door  is opened, and Handel unexpectedly presents himself. Then follows the  scene:    \"Handel: 'Vat! mein dear friend Hardgasdle--vat! you are merry py  dimes! Vat! and Misder Golley Cibbers too! ay, and Togder Peepbush  as veil! Vell, dat is gomigal. Veil, mein friendts, andt how vags the  vorldt wid you, mein tdears? Bray, bray, do let me sit town a momend.'    \"Pepusch took the great man's hat, Colley Cibber took his stick, and my  great-uncle wheeled round his reading-chair, which was somewhat about  the dimensions of that in which our kings and queens are crowned; and  then the great man sat him down.    \"'Vell, I thank you, gentlemen; now I am at mein ease vonce more. Upon  mein vord, dat is a picture of a ham. It is very pold of me to gome  to preak my fastd wid you uninvided; and I have brought along wid me  a nodable abbetite; for the wader of old Fader Dems is it not a fine  pracer of the stomach?'    \"'You do me great honor, Mr. Handel,' said my great-uncle. 'I take this  early visit as a great kindness.'    \"'A delightful morning for the water,' said Colley Cibber.    \"'Pray, did you come with oars or scullers, Mr. Handel?' said Pepusch.    \"'Now, how gan you demand of me dat zilly question, you who are a  musician and a man of science, Togder Peepbush? Vat gan it concern you  whether I have one votdermans or two votd-ermans--whether I bull out  mine burce for to pay von shilling or two? Diavolo! I gannot go here, or  I gannot go dere, but some one shall send it to some newsbaber, as  how Misder Chorge Vreder-ick Handel did go somedimes last week in a  votderman's wherry, to preak his fastd wid Misder Zac. Hardgasdle; but  it shall be all the fault wid himself, if it shall be but in print,  whether I was rowed by one votdermans or by two votdermans. So, Togder  Peepbush, you will blease to excuse me from dat.'    \"Poor Dr. Pepusch was for a moment disconcerted, but it was soon  forgotten in the first dish of coffee.    \"'Well, gentlemen,' said my great-uncle Zachary, looking at his tompion,  'it is ten minutes past nine. Shall we wait more for Dr. Arne?\"    \"'Let us give him another five minutes' chance, Master Hardcastle,' said  Colley Cibber; 'he is too great a genius to keep time.'    \"'Let us put it to the vote,' said Dr. Pepusch, smiling. 'Who holds up  hands?'    \"'I will segond your motion wid all mine heardt,' said Handel. 'I will  hold up mine feeble hands for mine oldt friendt Custos (Arne's name was  Augustine), for I know not who I wouldt waidt for, over andt above mine  oldt rival, Master Dom (meaning Pepusch). Only by your bermission, I  vill dake a snag of your ham, andt a slice of French roll, or a modicum  of chicken; for to dell you the honest fagd, I am all pote famished,  for I laid me down on mine billow in bed the lastd nightd widout  mine supper, at the instance of mine physician, for which I am not  altogeddere inglined to extend mine fastd no longer.' Then, laughing:  'Berhaps, Mister Golley Cibbers, you may like to pote this to the vote?  But I shall not segond the motion, nor shall I holdt up mine hand, as I  will, by bermission, embloy it some dime in a better office. So, if you  blease, do me the kindness for to gut me a small slice of ham.'    \"At this instant a hasty footstep was heard on the stairs, accompanied  by the humming of an air, all as gay as the morning, which was beautiful  and bright. It was the month of May.    \"'Bresto! be quick,' said Handel; he knew it was Arne; 'fifteen minutes  of dime is butty well for an _ad libitum_.'    \"'Mr. Arne,' said my great-uncle's man.    \"A chair was placed, and the social party commenced their dejeuner.    \"'Well, and how do you find yourself, my dear sir?' inquired Arne, with  friendly warmth.    \"'Why, by the mercy of Heaven, and the waders of Aix-la-Chapelle, andt  the addentions of mine togders andt physicians, and oggulists, of lade  years, under Providence, I am surbrizingly pedder--thank you kindly,  Misder Custos. Andt you have also been doing well of lade, as I am  bleased to hear. You see, sir,' pointing to his plate, 'you see, sir,  dat I am in the way for to regruit mine flesh wid the good viands of  Misder Zachary Hardgasdle.'    \"'So, sir, I presume you are come to witness the trial of skill at  the old round church? I understand the amateurs expect a pretty sharp  contest,' said Arne.    \"'Gondest,' echoed Handel, laying down his knife and fork. 'Yes, no  doubt; your amadeurs have a bassion for gondest. Not vot it vos in our  remembrance. Hey, mine friendt? Ha, ha, ha!'    \"'No, sir, I am happy to say those days of envy and bickering, and party  feeling, are gone and past. To be sure we had enough of such disgraceful  warfare: it lasted too long.'    \"'Why, yes; it tid last too long, it bereft me of mine poor limbs: it  tid bereave of that vot is the most blessed gift of Him vot made us,  andt not wee ourselves. And for vot? Vy, for nod-ing in the vorldt pode  the bleasure and bastime of them who, having no widt, nor no want, set  at loggerheads such men as live by their widts, to worry and destroy  one andt anodere as wild beasts in the Golloseum in the dimes of the  Romans.'    \"Poor Dr. Pepusch during this conversation, as my great-uncle observed,  was sitting on thorns; he was in the confederacy professionally only.    \"'I hope, sir,' observed the doctor, 'you do not include me among those  who did injustice to your talents?'    \"'Nod at all, nod at all, God forbid! I am a great admirer of the airs  of the 'Peggar's Obera,' andt every professional gendtleman must do  his best for to live.'    \"This mild return, couched under an apparent compliment, was well  received; but Handel, who had a talent for sarcastic drolling, added:    \"'Pute why blay the Peggar yourself, togder, andt adapt oldt pallad  humsdrum, ven, as a man of science, you could gombose original airs of  your own? Here is mine friendt, Custos Arne, who has made a road for  himself, for to drive along his own genius to the demple of fame.' Then,  turning to our illustrious Arne, he continued, 'Min friendt Custos,  you and I must meed togeder some dimes before it is long, and hold a  _tede-a-tede_ of old days vat is gone; ha, ha! Oh! it is gomigal now dat  id is all gone by.

Next, again, mine some-dimes  nodtable rival Bononcini, and old Borbora? Ha, ha, ha! all at war wid  me, andt all at war wid themselves. Such a gonfusion of rivalshibs, andt  double-facedness, andt hybocrisy, and malice, vot would make a gomigal  subject for a boem in rhymes, or a biece for the stage, as I hopes to be  saved.'\"      IX.    We now turn from the man to his music. In his daily life with the world  we get a spectacle of a quick, passionate temper, incased in a  great burly frame, and raging into whirlwinds of excitement at small  provocation; a gourmand devoted to the pleasure of the table, sometimes  indeed gratifying his appetite in no seemly fashion, resembling his  friend Dr. Samuel Johnson in many notable ways. Handel as a man was  of the earth, earthy, in the extreme, and marked by many whimsical and  disagreeable faults. But in his art we recognize a genius so colossal,  massive, and self-poised as to raise admiration to its superlative of  awe. When Handel had disencumbered himself of tradition, convention,  the trappings of time and circumstance, he attained a place in musical  creation, solitary and unique. His genius found expression in forms "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17474"],[0,"How to Listen to Music, 7th ed. (#7)"],[1,"compositions which make a frank effort to depict  scenes, incidents, or emotional processes to which the composer  himself gives the clew either by means of a descriptive title or a  verbal motto. It is unfortunate that the term has come to be loosely  used. In a high sense the purest and best music in the world is  programmatic, its programme being, as I have said, that \"high ideal of  goodness, truthfulness, and beauty\" which is the content of all true  art. But the origin of the term was vulgar, and the most contemptible  piece of tonal imitation now claims kinship in the popular mind with  the exquisitely poetical creations of Schumann and the \"Pastoral\"  symphony of Beethoven; and so it is become necessary to defend it in  the case of noble compositions. A programme is not necessarily, as  Ambros asserts, a certificate of poverty and an admission on the part  of the composer that his art has got beyond its natural bounds.  Whether it be merely a suggestive title, as in the case of some of the  compositions of Beethoven, Schumann, and Mendelssohn, or an extended  commentary, as in the symphonic poems of Liszt and the symphonies of  Berlioz and Raff, the programme has a distinct value to the composer  as well as the hearer. It can make the perceptive sense more  impressible to the influence of the music; it can quicken the fancy,  and fire the imagination; it can prevent a gross misconception of the  intentions of a composer and the character of his composition.  Nevertheless, in determining the artistic value of the work, the  question goes not to the ingenuity of the programme or the clearness  with which its suggestions have been carried out, but to the beauty of  the music itself irrespective of the verbal commentary accompanying  it. This rule must be maintained in order to prevent a degradation of  the object of musical expression. The vile, the ugly, the painful are  not fit subjects for music; music renounces, contravenes, negatives  itself when it attempts their delineation.    A classification of Programme music might be made on these lines:    [Sidenote: _Kinds of Programme music._]    I. Descriptive pieces which rest on imitation or suggestion of natural  sounds.    II. Pieces whose contents are purely musical, but the mood of which is  suggested by a poetical title.    III. Pieces in which the influence which determined their form and  development is indicated not only by a title but also by a motto which  is relied upon to mark out a train of thought for the listener which  will bring his fancy into union with that of the composer. The motto  may be verbal or pictorial.    IV. Symphonies or other composite works which have a title to indicate  their general character, supplemented by explanatory superscriptions  for each portion.    [Sidenote: _Imitation of natural sounds._]    [Sidenote: _The nightingale._]    [Sidenote: _The cat._]    [Sidenote: _The cuckoo._]    The first of these divisions rests upon the employment of the lowest  form of conventional musical idiom. The material which the natural  world provides for imitation by the musician is exceedingly scant.  Unless we descend to mere noise, as in the descriptions of storms and  battles (the shrieking of the wind, the crashing of thunder, and the  roar of artillery--invaluable aids to the cheap descriptive writer),  we have little else than the calls of a few birds. Nearly thirty years  ago Wilhelm Tappert wrote an essay which he called \"Zooplastik in  Toenen.\" He ransacked the musical literature of centuries, but in all  his examples the only animals the voices of which are unmistakable are  four fowls--the cuckoo, quail (that is the German bird, not the  American, which has a different call), the cock, and the hen. He has  many descriptive sounds which suggest other birds and beasts, but only  by association of idea; separated from title or text they suggest  merely what they are--musical phrases. A reiteration of the rhythmical  figure called the \"Scotch snap,\" breaking gradually into a trill, is  the common symbol of the nightingale's song, but it is not a copy of  that song; three or four tones descending chromatically are given as  the cat's mew, but they are made to be such only by placing the  syllables _Mi-au_ (taken from the vocabulary of the German cat) under  them. Instances of this kind might be called characterization, or  description by suggestion, and some of the best composers have made  use of them, as will appear in these pages presently. The list being  so small, and the lesson taught so large, it may be well to give a few  striking instances of absolutely imitative music. The first bird to  collaborate with a composer seems to have been the cuckoo, whose notes    [Music illustration: Cuck-oo!]    had sounded in many a folk-song ere Beethoven thought of enlisting the  little solo performer in his \"Pastoral\" symphony. It is to be borne in  mind, however, as a fact having some bearing on the artistic value of  Programme music, that Beethoven's cuckoo changes his note to please  the musician, and, instead of singing a minor third, he sings a major  third thus:    [Music illustration: Cuck-oo!]    [Sidenote: _Cock and hen._]    As long ago as 1688 Jacob Walter wrote a musical piece entitled  \"Gallina et Gallo,\" in which the hen was delineated in this theme:    [Music illustration: _Gallina._]    while the cock had the upper voice in the following example, his clear  challenge sounding above the cackling of his mate:    [Music illustration: _Gallo._]    The most effective use yet made of the song of the hen, however, is in  \"La Poule,\" one of Rameau's \"Pieces de Clavecin,\" printed in 1736, a  delightful composition with this subject:    [Music illustration: Co co co co co co co dai, etc.]    [Sidenote: _The quail._]    The quail's song is merely a monotonic rhythmical figure to which  German fancy has fitted words of pious admonition:    [Music illustration: Fuerch-te Gott! Lo-be Gott!]    [Sidenote: _Conventional idioms._]    [Sidenote: _Association of ideas._]    [Sidenote: _Fancy and imagination._]    [Sidenote: _Harmony and emotionality._]    The paucity of examples in this department is a demonstration of the  statement made elsewhere that nature does not provide music with  models for imitation as it does painting and sculpture. The fact that,  nevertheless, we have come to recognize a large number of idioms based  on association of ideas stands the composer in good stead whenever he  ventures into the domain of delineative or descriptive music, and this  he can do without becoming crudely imitative. Repeated experiences  have taught us to recognize resemblances between sequences or  combinations of tones and things or ideas, and on these analogies,  even though they be purely conventional (that is agreed upon, as we  have agreed that a nod of the head shall convey assent, a shake of the  head dissent, and a shrug of the shoulders doubt or indifference), the  composers have built up a voluminous vocabulary of idioms which need  only to be helped out by a suggestion to the mind to be eloquently  illustrative. \"Sometimes hearing a melody or harmony arouses an  emotion like that aroused by the contemplation of a thing. Minor  harmonies, slow movements, dark tonal colorings, combine directly to  put a musically susceptible person in a mood congenial to thoughts of  sorrow and death; and, inversely, the experience of sorrow, or the  contemplation of death, creates affinity for minor harmonies, slow  movements, and dark tonal colorings. Or we recognize attributes in  music possessed also by things, and we consort the music and the  things, external attributes bringing descriptive music into play,  which excites the fancy, internal attributes calling for an exercise  of the loftier faculty, imagination, to discern their meaning.\"[B] The  latter kind is delineative music of the higher order, the kind that I  have called idealized programme music, for it is the imagination  which, as Ruskin has said, \"sees the heart and inner nature and makes  them felt, but is often obscure, mysterious, and interrupted in its  giving out of outer detail,\" which is \"a seer in the prophetic sense,  calling the things that are not as though they were, and forever  delighting to dwell on that which is not tangibly present.\" In this  kind of music, harmony, the real seat of emotionality in music, is an  eloquent factor, and, indeed, there is no greater mystery in the art,  which is full of mystery, than the fact that the lowering of the  second tone in the chord, which is the starting-point of harmony,  should change an expression of satisfaction, energetic action, or  jubilation into an accent of pain or sorrow. The major mode is \"to  do,\" the minor, \"to suffer:\"    [Sidenote: _Major and minor._]    [Music illustration: Hur-rah! A-las!]    [Sidenote: _Music and movement._]    How near a large number of suggestions, which are based wholly upon  experience or association of ideas, lie to the popular fancy, might be  illustrated by scores of examples. Thoughts of religious functions  arise in us the moment we hear the trombones intone a solemn phrase in  full harmony; an oboe melody in sixth-eighth time over a drone bass  brings up a pastoral picture of a shepherd playing upon his pipe;  trumpets and drums suggest war, and so on. The delineation of  movement is easier to the musician than it is to the poet. Handel, who  has conveyed the sensation of a \"darkness which might be felt,\" in a  chorus of his \"Israel in Egypt,\" by means which appeal solely to the  imagination stirred by feelings, has in the same work pictured the  plague of frogs with a frank _naivete_ which almost upsets our  seriousness of demeanor, by suggesting the characteristic movement of  the creatures in the instrumental accompaniment to the arioso, \"Their  land brought forth frogs,\" which begins thus:    [Sidenote: _Handel's frogs._]    [Music illustration]    [Sideno"]]]
