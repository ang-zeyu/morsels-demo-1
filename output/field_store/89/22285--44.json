Em muitos _torques_ as duas extremidades da peça metalica não  estão soldadas, porém o metal offerece bastante flexibilidade para  facilitar mettel-as nos punhos, podendo-se unir ou abrir,  independentemente do fecho; outros _torques_ não apresentam nenhuma  d'estas formas.    [Figura 19]    Appareceram tambem chapas de ouro bastante delgadas com feitio de  meias-luas, porém cujas pontas estavam arqueadas de modo a formarem  circulo quasi perfeito. Vêem-se, aos lados e nas extremidades de algumas  d'estas peças, festões e molduras.    [Figura 20]    O pequeno intervallo que separa as duas pontas do crescente não nos faz  suppôr que este enfeite servisse para se trazer em volta do collo;  provavelmente ficava suspenso por uma corrente.    Alguns instrumentos achados por varias vezes nos sepulchros, ou junto  dos dolmens, em França e mais frequentemente na Irlanda, consistiam em  hastea de ouro arqueada tendo nas duas extremidades um disco, em alguns  chato, em outros levemente concavo.    [Figura 21]    Ignora-se absolutamente para que uso seriam destinados.    Finalmente, o objecto seguinte, uma especie de _gargantilha_ formada de  uma folha de ouro mui delgada, foi achado em França em diversas  localidades.    [Figura 22: Collar de ouro descoberto em França]    As _moedas_ chamadas _celticas_ são provavelmente em parte  contemporaneas dos ornamentos ou enfeites que descrevemos acima.      *Objectos de barro*    São tanto mais difficeis de se distinguirem os _objectos de barro  celticos_, com excepção dos que se tem encontrado nos _tumulos_, quanto  em algumas partes estão muitas vezes misturados com outros similhantes  aos do tempo dos romanos; visto que os mesmos sitios foram habitados  antes e depois da conquista de Cezar na Peninsula.    [Figura 23]    Os objectos de barro descobertos nos _tumulos_, são formados de terra  preta, mal preparada e com pequenos seixos, o que produziu massa pouco  solida. Os seus fragmentos são frageis, e não foram cozidos  sufficientemente; a parte quebrada não mostra arestas vivas, mas sempre  cheias de cavidades. As superficies d'essas peças, tanto na parte  interna, como na externa, tem côr quasi egual á do ferro ferrugento;  porém na parte interna é de negro carregado. Expostas á acção do lume  tomam exteriormente a côr avermelhada do tijolo; em quanto no interior  ficam negras, e mais frageis depois d'esta operação.    [Figura 24: Vasos achados nos tumulos de Inglaterra, Hollanda e outros  paizes]    Esses vasos não parece terem sido feitos com auxilio do torno, e não  apresentam nenhum moldado ou borda; foram unicamente alisados na parte  exterior com um objecto qualquer, que lhes deu lustro irregularmente, de  maneira que mostram na superficie altos e baixos, mais ou menos lisos,  conforme vai indicado na gravura junta.    Os que foram encontrados nas cidades _lacustras_, mostram inteira  similhança e caracter no fabrico. A massa não está solidamente ligada,  por ter algumas partes de pederneira; a côr é preta ou cinzento escuro.  Esta massa tem pouca consistencia; quando está secca quebra-se  facilmente, e pode-se desfazer entre os dedos; se a molharmos,  dar-nos-ha a apparencia de bocados de cortiça velha que estivesse por  muito tempo exposta á chuva. As suas formas indicam a infancia da arte,  excepto os fragmentos onde se descobre o uso do torno; os demais  pertenceram a objectos que parece foram vasados em moldes e polidos á  mão, ou lavrados com algum instrumento. Reconhece-se na superficie  exterior de alguns fragmentos o trabalho de uma especie de plaina. Os  ornamentos compôem-se de filetes imperfeitos, e em pequenos riscos junto  á borda do orificio.    [Figura 25: Outros vasos achados nos tumulos]    Entre os objectos de arte que enumeramos, só vemos os instrumentos cuja  materia unicamente podia resistir á acção do tempo; os moveis de madeira  que teriam as habitações gaulezas não conseguiram chegar até os nossos  dias. Os lagos de certo conservaram-nos muitos objectos, e até pedaços  de tecidos que recentemente nos esclareceram alguns pontos relativos á  industria d'esses povos, antes da occupação do territorio da Gallia  pelos romanos, porém são ainda dados incompletos para se formar cabal  idéa do estado da industria.

For five long hours this unequal contest was kept up. It might have  reminded one of a man with a slender rod and a long, delicate line, who  had hooked a big salmon. The man could not pull in the salmon, but, on  the other hand, the salmon could not hurt the man, and in the course of  time the big fish would be tired out, and the man would get out his  landing-net and scoop him in.    Now Bartholemy thought he could scoop in the Spanish vessel. So many of  her men had been shot that the two crews would be more nearly equal. So,  boldly, he ran his vessel alongside the big ship and again boarded her.  Now there was another great fight on the decks. The Spaniards had ceased  to be triumphant, but they had become desperate, and in the furious  combat ten of the pirates were killed and four wounded. But the  Spaniards fared worse than that; more than half of the men who had not  been shot by the pirates went down before their cutlasses and pistols,  and it was not long before Bartholemy had captured the great Spanish  ship.    It was a fearful and a bloody victory he had gained. A great part of his  own men were lying dead or helpless on the deck, and of the Spaniards  only forty were left alive, and these, it appears from the accounts,  must have been nearly all wounded or disabled.    It was a common habit among the buccaneers, as well as among the  Spaniards, to kill all prisoners who were not able to work for them, but  Bartholemy does not seem to have arrived at the stage of depravity  necessary for this. So he determined not to kill his prisoners, but he  put them all into a boat and let them go where they pleased; while he  was left with fifteen men to work a great vessel which required a crew  of five times that number.    But the men who could conquer and capture a ship against such enormous  odds, felt themselves fully capable of working her, even with their  little crew. Before doing anything in the way of navigation they cleared  the decks of the dead bodies, taking from them all watches, trinkets,  and money, and then went below to see what sort of a prize they had  gained. They found it a very good one indeed. There were seventy-five  thousand crowns in money, besides a cargo of cocoa worth five thousand  more, and this, combined with the value of the ship and all its  fittings, was a great fortune for those days.    When the victorious pirates had counted their gains and had mended the  sails and rigging of their new ship, they took what they wanted out of  their own vessel, and left her to sink or to float as she pleased, and  then they sailed away in the direction of the island of Jamaica. But the  winds did not suit them, and, as their crew was so very small, they  could not take advantage of light breezes as they could have done if  they had had men enough. Consequently they were obliged to stop to get  water before they reached the friendly vicinity of Jamaica.    They cast anchor at Cape St. Anthony on the west end of Cuba. After a  considerable delay at this place they started out again to resume their  voyage, but it was not long before they perceived, to their horror,  three Spanish vessels coming towards them. It was impossible for a very  large ship, manned by an extremely small crew, to sail away from those  fully equipped vessels, and as to attempting to defend themselves  against the overwhelming power of the antagonists, that was too absurd  to be thought of even by such a reckless fellow as Bartholemy. So, when  the ship was hailed by the Spanish vessels he lay to and waited until a  boat's crew boarded him. With the eye of a nautical man the Spanish  captain of one of the ships perceived that something was the matter with  this vessel, for its sails and rigging were terribly cut up in the long  fight through which it had passed, and of course he wanted to know what  had happened. When he found that the great ship was in the possession of  a very small body of pirates, Bartholemy and his men were immediately  made prisoners, taken on board the Spanish ship, stripped of everything  they possessed, even their clothes, and shut up in the hold. A crew from  the Spanish ships was sent to man the vessel which had been captured,  and then the little fleet set sail for San Francisco in Campeachy.    An hour had worked a very great change in the fortunes of Bartholemy and  his men; in the fine cabin of their grand prize they had feasted and  sung, and had gloried over their wonderful success, and now, in the  vessel of their captor, they were shut up in the dark, to be enslaved or  perhaps executed.    But it is not likely that any one of them either despaired or repented;  these are sentiments very little in use by pirates.          Chapter VII    The Pirate who could not Swim      When the little fleet of Spanish vessels, including the one which had  been captured by Bartholemy Portuguez and his men, were on their way to  Campeachy, they met with very stormy weather so that they were  separated, and the ship which contained Bartholemy and his companions  arrived first at the port for which they were bound.    The captain, who had Bartholemy and the others in charge, did not know  what an important capture he had made; he supposed that these pirates  were ordinary buccaneers, and it appears that it was his intention to  keep them as his own private prisoners, for, as they were all very  able-bodied men, they would be extremely useful on a ship. But when his  vessel was safely moored, and it became known in the town that he had a  company of pirates on board, a great many people came from shore to see  these savage men, who were probably looked upon very much as if they  were a menagerie of wild beasts brought from foreign lands.    Among the sightseers who came to the ship was a merchant of the town who  had seen Bartholemy before, and who had heard of his various exploits.  He therefore went to the captain of the vessel and informed him that he  had on board one of the very worst pirates in the whole world, whose  wicked deeds were well known in various parts of the West Indies, and  who ought immediately to be delivered up to the civil authorities. This  proposal, however, met with no favor from the Spanish captain, who had  found Bartholemy a very quiet man, and could see that he was a very  strong one, and he did not at all desire to give up such a valuable  addition to his crew. But the merchant grew very angry, for he knew that  Bartholemy had inflicted great injury on Spanish commerce, and as the  captain would not listen to him, he went to the Governor of the town and  reported the case. When this dignitary heard the story he immediately  sent a party of officers to the ship, and commanded the captain to  deliver the pirate leader into their charge. The other men were left  where they were, but Bartholemy was taken away and confined in another  ship. The merchant, who seemed to know a great deal about him, informed  the authorities that this terrible pirate had been captured several  times, but that he had always managed to escape, and, therefore, he was  put in irons, and preparations were made to execute him on the next day;  for, from what he had heard, the Governor considered that this pirate  was no better than a wild beast, and that he should be put to death  without even the formality of a trial.    But there was a Spanish soldier on board the ship who seemed to have had  some pity, or perhaps some admiration, for the daring pirate, and he  thought that if he were to be hung the next day it was no more than  right to let him know it, so that when he went in to take some food to  Bartholemy he told him what was to happen.    Now this pirate captain was a man who always wanted to have a share in  what was to happen, and he immediately racked his brain to find out what  he could do in this case. He had never been in a more desperate  situation, but he did not lose heart, and immediately set to work to  free himself from his irons, which were probably very clumsy affairs. At  last, caring little how much he scratched and tore his skin, he  succeeded in getting rid of his fetters, and could move about as freely  as a tiger in a cage. To get out of this cage was Bartholemy's first  object. It would be comparatively easy, because in the course of time  some one would come into the hold, and the athletic buccaneer thought  that he could easily get the better of whoever might open the hatch.  But the next act in this truly melodramatic performance would be a great  deal more difficult; for in order to escape from the ship it would be  absolutely necessary for Bartholemy to swim to shore, and he did not  know how to swim, which seems a strange failing in a hardy sailor with  so many other nautical accomplishments. In the rough hold where he was  shut up, our pirate, peering about, anxious and earnest, discovered two  large, earthen jars in which wine had been brought from Spain, and with  these he determined to make a sort of life-preserver. He found some  pieces of oiled cloth, which he tied tightly over the open mouths of the  jars and fastened them with cords. He was satisfied that this unwieldy  contrivance would support him in the water.    Among other things he had found in his rummagings about the hold was an  old knife, and with this in his hand he now sat waiting for a good  opportunity to attack his sentinel.    This came soon after nightfall. A man descended with a lantern to see  that the prisoner was still secure,--let us hope that it was not the  soldier who had kindly informed him of his fate,--and as soon as he was  fairly in the hold Bartholemy sprang upon him. There was a fierce  struggle, but the pirate was quick and powerful, and the sentinel was  soon dead. Then, carrying his two jars, Bartholemy "]]]
