Now this was  forbidden as it was considered an insult to the Germans. Even the Red  Cross flag was forbidden except on the German military hospitals, and I  thought Brussels looked indeed a melancholy city as we came in from  Charleroi that morning in torrents of rain in the Red Cross car.    My first business was to go round and visit all my nurses. I found most  of them very unhappy because they had no work. All the patients had been  removed from the fire-station hospital and nearly all the private  hospitals and ambulances were empty too. It was said that Germans would  rather have all their wounded die than be looked after by Englishwomen,  and there were dreadful stories afloat which I cannot think any German  believed, of English nurses putting out the eyes of the German wounded.  Altogether there were a good many English Sisters and doctors in  Brussels--three contingents sent out by the Order of St. John of  Jerusalem, to which we belonged, a large unit sent by the British Red  Cross Society, and a good many sent out privately. It certainly was not  worth while for more than a hundred English nurses to remain idle in  Brussels, and the only thing to do now was to get them back to England  as soon as possible. In the meantime a few of them took the law into  their own hands, and slipped away without a passport, and got back to  England safely by unofficial means.    The second afternoon I was in Brussels I received a note from one of my  nurses who had been sent to Tirlemont in my absence by the Belgian Red  Cross Society. The contents of the note made me very anxious about her,  and I determined to go and see her if possible. I had some Belgian  acquaintances who had come from that direction a few days before, and I  went to ask their advice as to how I should set about it. They told me  the best way, though rather the longest, was to go first to Malines and  then on to Tirlemont from there, and the only possible way of getting  there was to walk, as they had done a few days previously, and trust to  getting lifts in carts. There had been no fighting going on when they  had passed, and they thought I should get through all right.    So I set out very early in the morning accompanied by another Sister,  carrying a little basket with things for one or two nights. I did not  ask for any _laissez-passer_, knowing well enough that it would not be  granted. We were lucky enough to get a tram the first part of the way,  laden with peasants who had been in to Brussels to sell country produce  to the German army, and then we set out on our long walk. It was a  lovely late September morning, and the country looked so peaceful one  could hardly believe that a devastating war was going on. Our way led  first through a park, then through a high-banked lane all blue with  scabious, and then at last we got on to a main road, when the owner of a  potato cart crawling slowly along, most kindly gave us a long lift on  our way.    We then walked straight along the Malines road, and I was just remarking  to my companion that it was odd we should not have met a single German  soldier, when we came into a village that was certainly full of them. It  was about 11 o'clock and apparently their dinner hour, for they were all  hurrying out of a door with cans full of appetizing stew in their hands.  They took no notice of us and we walked on, but very soon came to a  sandy piece of ground where a good many soldiers were entrenched and  where others were busily putting up barbed-wire entanglements. They  looked at us rather curiously but did not stop us, and we went on.  Suddenly we came to a village where a hot skirmish was going on, two  Belgian and German outposts had met. Some mitrailleuses were there in  the field beside us, and the sound of rifle fire was crackling in the  still autumn air. There was nothing to do but to go forward, so we went  on through the village, and presently saw four German soldiers running  up the street. It is not a pretty sight to see men running away. These  men were livid with terror and gasping with deep breaths as they ran.  One almost brushed against me as he passed, and then stopped for a  moment, and I thought he was going to shoot us. But in a minute they  went on towards the barbed-wire barricades and we made our way up the  village street. Bullets were whistling past now, and every one was  closing their shops and putting up their shutters. Several people were  taking refuge behind a manure heap, and we went to join them, but the  proprietor came out and said we must not stay there as it was dangerous  for him. He advised us to go to the hotel, so we went along the street  until we reached it, but it was not a very pleasant walk, as bullets  were flying freely and the mitrailleuse never stopped going pom-pom-pom.    We found the hotel closed when we got to it, and the people absolutely  refused to let us come in, so we stood in the road for a few minutes,  not knowing which way to go. Then a Red Cross doctor saw us, and came  and told us to get under cover at once. We explained that we desired  nothing better, but that the hotel was shut, so he very kindly took us  to a convent near by. It was a convent of French nuns who had been  expelled from France and come to settle in this little village, and when  they heard who we were they were perfectly charming to us, bringing  beautiful pears from their garden and offering to keep us for the night.  We could not do that, however, it might have brought trouble on them;  but we rested half an hour and then made up our minds to return to  Brussels. We could not go forward as the Malines road was blocked with  soldiers, and we were afraid we could not get back the way we had come,  past the barbed-wire barricades, but the nuns told us of a little lane  at the back of their convent which led to the high road to Brussels,  about fifteen miles distant. We went down this lane for about an hour,  and then came to a road where four roads met, just as the nuns had said.  I did not know which road to take, so asked a woman working outside the  farm. She spoke Flemish, of which I only know a few words, and either I  misunderstood her, or she thought we were German Sisters, for she  pointed to another lane at the left which we had not noticed, and we  thought it was another short cut to Brussels.    We had only gone a few yards down this lane when we met a German sentry  who said \"Halt!\" We were so accustomed to them that we did not take much  notice, and I just showed my Red Cross brassard as I had been accustomed  to do in Charleroi when stopped. This had the German eagle stamped on it  as well as the Belgian Red Cross stamp. The man saluted and let us pass.  _Now_ I realize that he too thought we were German Sisters.    We went on calmly down the lane and in two minutes we fell into a whole  German camp. There were tents and wagons and cannon and camp fires, and  thousands of soldiers. I saw some carts there which they must have  captured from the English bearing the familiar names of \"Lyons' Tea\" and  \"Pickford\" vans! An officer came up and asked in German what we wanted.  I replied in French that we were two Sisters on our way to Brussels.  Fortunately I could produce my Belgian Carte d'Identite, which had also  been stamped with the German stamp. The only hope was to let him think  we were Belgians. Had they known we were English I don't think anything  would have saved us from being shot as spies. The officer had us  searched, but found nothing contraband on us and let us go, though he  did not seem quite satisfied. He really thought he had found something  suspicious when he spied in my basket a small metal case. It contained  nothing more compromising, however, than a piece of Vinolia soap. We had  not the least idea which way to go when we were released, and went wrong  first, and had to come back through that horrible camp again. Seven  times we were stopped and searched, and each time I pointed to my German  brassard and produced my Belgian Carte d'Identite. Sister did not speak  French or German, but she was very good and did not lose her head, or  give us away by speaking English to me. And at last--it seemed hours to  us--we got safely past the last sentry. Footsore and weary, but very  thankful, we trudged back to Brussels.    But that was not quite the end of our adventure, for just as we were  getting into Brussels an officer galloped after us, and dismounted as  soon as he got near us. He began asking in broken French the most  searching questions as to our movements. I could not keep it up and had  to tell him that we were English. He really nearly fell down with  surprise, and wanted to know, naturally enough, what we were doing  there. I told him the exact truth--how we had started out for Malines,  were unable to get there and so were returning to Brussels. \"But,\" he  said at once, \"you are not on the Malines road.\" He had us there, but I  explained that we had rested at a convent and that the nuns had shown us  a short cut, and that we had got on to the wrong road quite by mistake.  He asked a thousand questions, and wanted the whole history of our lives  from babyhood up. Eventually I satisfied him apparently, for he saluted,  and said in English as good as mine, \"Truly the English are a wonderful  nation,\" mounted his horse and rode away.    I did not try any more excursions to Tirlemont after that, but heard  later on that my nurse was safe and in good hands.           *       *       *       *       *    My business in Brussels was now finished, and I wanted to return to my  hospital at M. The German authorities met my request with a blank  refusal. I was not at all prepared for this. I had only come in for two  days and had left all my luggage behind me. Also one cannot leave one's  hospital in this kind of way without a word of explanation "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17594"],[0,"Lectures on Language, as Particularly Connected with English Grammar. (#7)"],[1,"ction, their difference from other fruit, where  found, when, and by whom. Here! look again. What do you see?  A-P-P-L-E--_Apple_. What is that? The representation of the idea  produced in the mind by a certain object you saw a little while ago.  Here then you have the spoken and written signs of this single object I  now again present to your vision. This idea may also be called up by the  sense of feeling, smelling, or tasting, under certain restrictions. Here  you would be no more liable to be mistaken than by seeing. We can indeed  imagine things which would feel, and smell, and taste, and look some  like an apple, but it falls to the lot of more abstruse reasoners to  make their suppositions, and then account for them--to imagine things,  and then treat of them as realities. We are content with the knowledge  of things as they do exist, and think there is little danger of  mistaking a potato for an apple, or a squash for a pear. Tho in the dark  we may lay hold of the Frenchman's _pomme de terre_--apple of the earth,  the first bite will satisfy us of our mistake if we are not too  metaphysical.    The same idea may be called up in your minds by a picture of the apple  presented to your sight. On this ground the picture writing of the  ancients may be accounted for; and after that, the hieroglyphics of  Egypt and other countries, which was but a step from picture writing  towards the use of the alphabet. But these signs or vehicles for the  conveyance or transmission of their thoughts, compared with the present  perfect state of language, were as aukward and uncomly as the carriages  employed for the conveyance of their bodies were compared with those now  in use. They were like ox carts drawn by mules, compared with the most  splendid barouches drawn by elegant dapple-greys.    A similar mode would be adopted now by those unacquainted with  alphabetical writing. It was so with the merchant who could not write.  He sold his neighbor a grindstone, on trust. Lest he should forget  it--lest the _idea_ of it should be obliterated from the mind--he, in  the absence of his clerk, took his book and a pen and drew out a _round  picture_ to represent it. Some months after, he dunned his neighbor for  his pay for a cheese. \"I have bought no cheese of you,\" was the reply.  Yes, you have, for I have it charged. \"You must be mistaken, for I never  bought a cheese. We always make our own.\" How then should I have one  charged to you? \"I cannot tell. I have never had any thing here on  credit except a grindstone.\" Ah! that's it, that's it, only I forgot to  make a hole through it!\"    Ideas may also be exchanged by actions. This is the first and strongest  language of nature. It may be employed, when words have failed, in the  most effectual manner. The angry man, choked with rage, unable to speak,  tells the violent passions, burning in his bosom, in a language which  can not be mistaken. The actions of a friend are a surer test of  friendship than all the honied words he may utter. Actions speak louder  than words. The first impressions of maternal affection are produced in  the infant mind by the soothing attentions of the mother. In the same  way we may understand the language of the deaf and dumb. Certain motions  express certain ideas. These being duly arranged and conformed to our  alphabetic signs, and well understood, the pupil may become acquainted  with book knowledge as well as we. They go by sight and not by sound. A  different method is adopted with the blind. Letters with them are so  arranged that they can _feel_ them. The signs thus felt correspond with  the sounds they hear. Here they must stop. They cannot see to describe.  Those who are so unfortunate as to be blind and deaf, can have but a  faint knowledge of language, or the ideas of others.    On similar principles we may explain the pantomime plays sometimes  performed, where the most entertaining scenes of love and murder are  represented, but not a word spoken.    Three things are always to be born in mind in the use and study of all  language: 1st, the thing signified; 2d, the idea of the thing; and 3d,  the word or sign chosen to represent it.    _Things_ exist.    Thinking beings conceive _ideas of things_.    Those who employ language adopt _sounds or signs to convey those ideas_  to others.    On these obvious principles rest the whole superstructure of all  language, spoken or written. Objects are presented to the mind,  impressions are there made, which, retained, constitute the idea, and,  by agreement, certain words are employed as the future signs or  representations of those ideas. If we saw an object in early life and  knew its _name_, the mention of that name will recal afresh the idea  which had long lain dormant in the memory, (if I may so speak,) and we  can converse about it as correctly as when we first saw it.    These principles, I have said, hold good in all languages. Proof of this  may not improperly be offered here, provided it be not too prolix. I  will endeavor to be brief.    In an open area of sufficient dimensions is congregated a delegation  from every language under heaven. All are so arranged as to face a  common center. A white horse is led into that spot and all look at the  living animal which stands before them. The same impression must be made  on all minds so far as a single animal is concerned. But as the whole is  made up of parts, so their minds will soon diverge from a single idea,  and one will think of his size, compared with other horses; another of  his form; another of his color. Some will think of his noble appearance,  others of his ability to travel, or (in jockey phrase) his _speed_. The  farrier will look for his blemishes, to see if he is _sound_, and the  jockey at his teeth, to _guess_ at his _age_. The anatomist will, in  thought, dissect him into parts and see every bone, sinew, cartilage,  blood vessel, his stomach, lungs, liver, heart, entrails; every part  will be laid open; and while the thoughtless urchin sees a single  object--a white horse--others will, at a single glance, read volumes of  instruction. Oh! the importance of knowledge! how little is it  regarded! What funds of instruction might be gathered from the lessons  every where presented to the mind!    One impression would be made on all minds in reference to the single  tangible object before them; no matter how learned or ignorant. There  stands an animal obvious to all. Let him be removed out of sight, and a  very exact picture of him suspended in his place. All again agree. Here  then is the proof of our first general principle, viz. all language  depends on the fixed and unvarying laws of nature.    Let the picture be removed and a man step forth and pronounce the word,  _ippos_. The Greek starts up and says, \"Yes, it is so.\" The rest do not  comprehend him. He then writes out distinctly, [Greek: IPPOS]. They are  in the dark as to the meaning. They know not whether a horse, a man, or  a goose is named. All the Greeks, however, understand the meaning the  same as when the horse or picture was before them, for they had _agreed_  that _ippos_ should represent the _idea_ of that animal.    Forth steps another, and pronounces the word _cheval_. Every Frenchman  is aroused: Oui, monsieur? Yes, sir. Comprenez vous? Do you understand?  he says to the rest. But they are dumb. He then writes C-H-E-V-A-L. All  are as ignorant as before, save the Frenchmen who had agreed that  _cheval_ should be the name for horse.    Next go yourself, thinking all will understand you, and say, _horse_;  but, lo! none unacquainted with your language are the wiser for the  sound you utter, or the sign you suspended before them; save, perhaps, a  little old Saxon, who, at first looks deceived by the similarity of  sound, but, seeing the sign, is as demure as ever, for he omits the _e_,  and pronounces it shorter than we do, more like a yorkshire man. But  why are you not understood? Because others have not entered into an  _agreement_ with you that _h-o-r-s-e_, spoken or written, shall  represent that animal.    Take another example. Place the living animal called man before them.  Less trouble will be found in this case than in the former, for there is  a nearer agreement than before in regard to the signs which shall be  employed to express the idea. This word occurs with very little  variation in the modern languages, derived undoubtedly from the  Teutonic, with a little change in the spelling, as Saxon _mann_ or  _mon_, Gothic _manna_, German, Danish, Dutch, Swedish and Icelandic  like ours. In the south of Europe, however, this word varies as well as  others.    Our language is derived more directly from the old Saxon than from any  other, but has a great similarity to the French and Latin, and a kind of  cousin-german to all the languages of Europe, ancient and modern. Ours,  indeed, is a compound from most other languages, retaining some of their  beauties and many of their defects. We can boast little distinctive  character of our own. As England was possessed by different nations at  different periods, so different dialects were introduced, and we can  trace our language to as many sources, German, Danish, Saxon, French,  and Roman, which were the different nations amalgamated into the British  empire. We retain little of the real old english--few words which may  not be traced to a foreign extraction. Different people settling in a  country would of course carry their ideas and manner of expressing them;  and from the whole compound a general agreement would, in process of  time, take place, and a uniform language be established. Such is the  origin and condition of our language, as well as every other modern  tongue of which we have any knowledge.    There is one practice of which our savans are guilty, at which I do most  seriously demur--the extravagant introduction of exotic words into our  vocabulary, apparently for no other object"]]]
