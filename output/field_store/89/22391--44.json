It is  produced by the complete lowering of the pillars of the fauces, while  the softest point of the palate--behind the nose--is thrown up very  high, seemingly, almost into the head; in the highest position, as it  were, above the head.    The rear of the tongue stands high, but is formed into a furrow, in  order that the mass of the tongue may not be in the way, either in the  throat or in the mouth. In the very highest falsetto and head tones  the furrow is pretty well filled out, and then no more breath at all  reaches the palatal resonance.    The larynx stands high--mine leans over to one side. (See plates of  larynx.)    [Illustration:    A    Normal position of the larynx.    B    The position of my larynx in the high range.]    The vocal cords, which we cannot feel, now approach very near each  other. The pupil should not read about them until he has learned to  hear correctly. I do not intend to write a physiological work, but  simply to attempt to examine certain infallible vocal sensations of  the singer; point out ways to cure evils, and show how to gain a  correct understanding of that which we lack.    Up to a certain pitch, with tenors as well as with sopranos, the head  tones should be mixed with palatal resonance. With tenors this will be  a matter of course, though with them the chest tones are much abused;  with sopranos, however, a judicious mixture may be recommended because  more expression is required (since the influence of Wagner has become  paramount in interpreting the meaning of a composition, especially of  the words) than in the brilliant fireworks of former times. The head  voice, too, must not be regarded as a definite register of its own,  which is generally produced in the middle range through too long a  persistence in the use of the palatal and nasal resonance. If it is  suddenly heard alone, after forcing tones that have preceded it, which  is not possible under other circumstances, it is of course noticeably  thin, and stands out to its disadvantage--like every other sharply  defined register--from the middle tones. In the formation of the voice  no \"register\" should exist or be created; the voice must be made even  throughout its entire range. I do not mean by this that I should sing  neither with chest tones nor with head tones. On the contrary, the  practised artist should have at his command all manner of different  means of expression, that he may be able to use his single tones,  according to the expression required, with widely diverse qualities of  resonance. This, too, must be cared for in his studies. But these  studies, because they must fit each individual case, according to the  genius or talent of the individual, can be imparted and directed only  by a good teacher.    The head voice, when its value is properly appreciated, is the most  valuable possession of all singers, male and female. It should not be  treated as a Cinderella, or as a last resort,--as is often done too  late, and so without results, because too much time is needed to  regain it, when once lost,--but should be cherished and cultivated as  a guardian angel and guide, like no other. Without its aid all voices  lack brilliancy and carrying power; they are like a head without a  brain. Only by constantly summoning it to the aid of all other  registers is the singer able to keep his voice fresh and youthful.  Only by a careful application of it do we gain that power of endurance  which enables us to meet the most fatiguing demands. By it alone can  we effect a complete equalization of the whole compass of all voices,  and extend that compass.    This is the great secret of those singers who keep their voices young  till they reach an advanced age. Without it all voices of which great  exertions are demanded infallibly meet disaster. Therefore, the motto  must be always, practice, and again, practice, to keep one's powers  uninjured; practice brings freshness to the voice, strengthens the  muscles, and is, for the singer, far more interesting than any musical  composition.    If in my explanations I frequently repeat myself, it is done not  unintentionally, but deliberately, because of the difficulty of the  subject, as well as of the superficiality and negligence of so many  singers who, after once hastily glancing through such a treatise,--if  they consider it worth their while at all to inform themselves on the  subject,--think they have done enough with it.    One must read continually, study constantly by one's self, to gain  even a faint idea of the difficulty of the art of singing, of managing  the voice, and even of one's own organs and mistakes, which are one's  second self. The phenomenon of the voice is an elaborate complication  of manifold functions which are united in an extremely limited space,  to produce a single tone; functions which can only be heard, scarcely  felt--indeed, should be felt as little as possible. Thus, in spite of  ourselves, we can only come back again to the point from which we  started, as in an eddy, repeating the explanations of the single  functions, and relating them to each other.    Since in singing we sense none of the various activities of the  cartilage, muscles, ligaments, and tendons that belong to the vocal  apparatus, feel them only in their cooeperation, and can judge of the  correctness of their workings only through the ear, it would be absurd  to think of them while singing. We are compelled, in spite of  scientific knowledge, to direct our attention while practising, to the  sensations of the voice, which are the only ones we can become aware  of,--sensations which are confined to the very palpable functions of  the organs of breathing, the position of the larynx, of the tongue,  and of the palate, and finally, to the sensation of the resonance of  the head cavities. The perfect tone results from the combined  operations of all these functions, the sensations of which I undertake  to explain, and the control of which the ear alone can undertake.    This is the reason why it is so important to learn to hear one's self,  and to sing in such a way that one can always so hear.    Even in the greatest stress of emotion the power of self-control must  never be lost; you must never allow yourself to sing in a slovenly,  that is, in a heedless, way, or to exceed your powers, or even to  reach their extreme limit. That would be synonymous with roughness,  which should be excluded from every art, especially in the art of  song. The listener must gain a pleasing impression from every tone,  every expression of the singer; much more may be given if desired.    Strength must not be confounded with roughness; and the two must not  go hand in hand together. Phenomenal beings may perhaps be permitted  to go beyond the strength of others; but to the others this must  remain forbidden. It cannot become a regular practice, and is best  limited to the single phenomenon. We should otherwise soon reach the  point of crudest realism, from which at best we are not far removed.  Roughness will never attain artistic justification, not even in the  case of the greatest individual singers, because it is an offence.    The public should witness from interpretative art only what is good  and noble on which to form its taste; there should be nothing crude or  commonplace put before it, which it might consider itself justified in  taking as an example.    Of the breath sensation I have already spoken at length. I must add  that it is often very desirable in singing to breathe through the  nose with the mouth closed; although when this is done, the raising of  the palate becomes less certain, as it happens somewhat later than  when the breath is taken with the mouth open. It has, however, this  disadvantage, that neither cold air nor dust is drawn into the larynx  and air passages. I take pleasure in doing it very often. At all  events, the singer should often avail himself of it.    We feel the larynx when the epiglottis springs up (\"stroke of the  glottis,\" if the tone is taken from below upward). We can judge  whether the epiglottis springs up quickly enough if the breath comes  out in a full enough stream to give the tone the necessary resonance.  The low position of the larynx can easily be secured by pronouncing  the vowel _oo_; the high, by pronouncing the vowel _[=a]_. Often  merely thinking of one or the other is enough to put the larynx,  tongue, and palate in the right relations to each other. Whenever I  sing in a high vocal range, I can plainly feel the larynx rise and  take a diagonal position. (See plate.)    The movement is, of course, very slight. Yet I have the feeling in my  throat as if everything in it was stretching. I feel the pliability of  my organs plainly as soon as I sing higher.          SECTION X    SENSATION AND POSITION OF THE TONGUE      We feel the placing of its tip against or beneath the front teeth; and  place the tip very low, so that it really curves over in front. (See  plate.)    Its hinder part must be drawn back toward the palate, in the  pronunciation of every letter.    Furthermore, by looking in the mirror we can _see_ that the sides of  the tongue are raised as soon as we wish to form a furrow in it; that  is, as we _must_ do to produce the palatal resonance. (Only in the  head tone--that is, the use of the resonance of the head cavities  without the added palatal resonance--has the tongue no furrow; it  must, however, lie very high, since otherwise its mass, when it lies  flat, presses against the larynx and produces pinched or otherwise  disagreeable tones.)    The best way is to get the mass of the tongue out of the way by  forming the furrow in it. In high notes, when the larynx must stand as  high as possible, the back of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19138"],[0,"Resonance in Singing and Speaking (#7)"],[1,"deep, the expiration sudden and complete_. Practise  this preliminary exercise for not more than ten minutes each morning  for a week. The second week hold the breath six seconds, instead of  four, and gradually increase the time, without overdoing.    While, for a novice, the exercises may be taken at first in bed, this  is but a preliminary to their practise standing in easy poise as  directed in the preceding section.      Exercise II    SLOW INHALATION WITH SUDDEN EXPULSION    Inhale as in I; hold the breath four counts (seconds) or more; then  expel the air vigorously in one breath through the wide open mouth.  The beginner is often helped in acquiring a deep breath by slowly  sipping breath. Therefore as a variant to Exercise II practise:      Exercise III    SIPPING THE BREATH, WITH QUICK EXHALATION    Through the smallest possible opening of the lips, while mentally  counting, inhale very slowly and steadily; hold two to four counts,  then expel the air all at once through the wide open mouth.      Exercise IV    FOR RIB EXPANSION    To more completely arouse dormant muscles that should play an  important part in breathing, place the hands against the sides, thumbs  well back, take, through the nostrils or the slightly parted lips,  six short catch-breaths, moving the ribs _out at the side_ with each  catch-breath. Hold the breath two counts, and exhale through the mouth  with six short expiratory puffs, drawing the ribs _in at the side_  with each puff.      Exercise V    SLOW INHALATION WITH SLOW EXPIRATION    Inhale as in I, while mentally counting one, two, three, four, etc.,  until the inhalation seems complete. Hold the breath four or more  counts; then exhale through the nostrils slowly and evenly while  mentally counting to the number reached in the inspiration. With  practice the number of counts will gradually increase. Do not,  however, force the increase. The muscles that control inspiration are  powerful; do not, therefore, make the mistake of seeking to control  expiration by contraction of the glottis. Practise these exercises  with an open throat and depend on the breathing muscles for control of  the outgoing air. Remember that _singing is control of breath in  exit_.      Exercise VI    RAPID INSPIRATION WITH SLOW EXPIRATION    Inhale through the nostrils quickly, deeply, and forcefully (one  count); hold two counts; exhale through the nostrils evenly, steadily,  and as slowly as possible while mentally counting one, two, three,  four, etc. With practice gradually increase the number of counts for  the exhalation.      Exercise VII    FARINELLI'S GREAT EXERCISE    The Cavalier, Don Carlo Broschi, better known as Farinelli  (1705-1782), the world's greatest singer in bravura and coloratura,  was a pupil of Porpora and Bernacchi. There was no branch of the art  which he did not carry to the highest perfection, and the successes of  his youth did not prevent him from continuing his study, or, when his  name was famous, from acquiring by much perseverance another style  and a superior method. His breath control was considered so marvelous  in that day of great singers, it is said, that the art of taking and  keeping the breath so softly and easily that no one could perceive it  began and died with him. He is said to have spent several hours daily  in practising the following exercise:    As in Exercise III, sip the breath slowly and steadily through the  smallest possible opening of the lips; hold it a few counts, then  exhale very slowly and steadily through the smallest possible opening  of the lips.    Farinelli's exercise is not for beginners.      Exercise VIII    THE CLEANSING BREATH    For ventilating and sweeping the lungs, for quick refreshment after  fatigue, and for use always at the close of your exercises, inhale  through the nostrils slowly a complete breath; hold two to four  counts, purse the lips tightly and expel through them a small puff of  air, hold two counts, puff one, hold two counts, puff one, and so on  until the exhalation is complete. A few trials should convince you  that this simple exercise is of great value.      HALF-BREATH    In both singing and speaking, the sustained delivery of long phrases  or sentences sometimes makes unusual demands on the breath supply. It  is a law of good singing that every phrase should end with the breath  unexhausted. When the flow of text and music forbid the taking of a  full breath, half-breaths must be quietly taken at convenient points.  Instead of letting the whole reservoir of motive power exhaust itself  and then completely refill it, we should, by taking these  half-breaths, maintain a reserve. A notable advocate of the use of the  half-breath in singing is that past mistress of sustained and smooth  delivery, Marcella Sembrich.          CHAPTER V    REGISTERS      The subject of registers has always been the _bete noire_ of  vocalists, a source of controversy and confusion. The term \"register,\"  as commonly used, means a series of tones of a characteristic clang or  quality, produced by the same mechanism. The term \"break\" is generally  used to indicate the point at which a new register with sudden change  appears.    The advocates of registers lay stress either on the changes in  laryngeal action, or the changes in tone quality. Before the days of  the laryngoscope, registers were treated simply as different qualities  of tone, characterizing a certain portion of the voice's compass.    Those who encourage the cultivation of register consciousness claim to  do so for the sake of the differences in tone-color which they  associate with the different \"registers.\" The purpose of the following  chapters is to show that the quality or color of a tone is altogether  a matter of resonance, and _not_ a question of laryngeal action.    Moreover, the mechanism of the larynx is not voluntary in its action,  but automatic, and even if a singer knew how the vocal cords should  act it would not help him in the least to govern their action. The  fact is that the results of laryngoscopic study of the vocal cords  have been disappointing and contradictory and investigators have  failed to define what correct laryngeal action is. There are those who  even deny that the vocal cords govern the pitch of the voice.    In her thoughtful _Philosophy of Singing_, Clara Kathleen Rogers,  while upholding \"registers,\" says that considered physiologically \"the  different registers of the voice should be regarded by the singer as  only so many _modifications in the quality of tone_, which  modifications are inherent in the voice itself.\" She then adds  significantly: \"These modifications are not brought about by conscious  adjustments of the parts employed, as any interference with the parts  will produce that obstacle to quality we call a 'break.'\"    One of the greatest of modern singers, Mme. Lilli Lehmann, in her  interesting work, _How to Sing_, says: \"Do registers exist by nature?  No. It may be said that they are created through long years of  speaking in the vocal range that is easiest to the person, or in one  adopted by imitation.\" She speaks of three ranges of the voice, or,  rather, three sections of the vocal range, as chest, middle, and head,  saying, \"All three form registers _when exaggerated_.\" After speaking  of the hopeless confusion that results from clinging to the  appellations of chest, middle, and head _register_, confounding voice  with register, she concludes:    \"As long as the word 'register' is kept in use the registers will not  disappear, and yet the register question must be swept away, to give  place to another class of ideas, sounder views on the part of  teachers, and a truer conception on the part of singers and pupils.\"    The trend of recent thought on this subject is further shown in  Ffrangcon-Davies' important work, _The Singing of the Future_, where,  having in mind \"the useless torture to which thousands of students  have been subjected,\" he characterizes \"breaks\" and \"registers\" as  \"paraphernalia supplied by credulity to charlatanism\"; and adds: \"How  many a poor pupil has become a practical monomaniac on the subject of  _that break in my voice between D and D sharp_!\"    My own studies convince me that there is but one register, or, rather,  no such thing as register, save as it applies to the compass of the  voice; and that chest, middle, head, and all other registers are  creations of false education. Training based upon the theory of many  registers results in an artificial and unnatural division of the  voice.      THE VOICE AND INSTRUMENTS COMPARED    The organ of the voice has long been considered the analogue of every  other instrument except in regard to registers. Investigation  indicates that it is analogous in this respect also. Compare the voice  instrument with the pianoforte, violin, and organ and the similarity  will plainly appear. The artificial instruments undergo no change when  making a tone of higher or lower pitch other than the attuning of the  vibrator to the pitch desired. All other parts remain the same. So  when the voice is correctly focused and delivered, the only change  incident to altered pitch is that made in the vibrator so as to give  the proper number of vibrations for the pitch required. If the scale  is sung down, using the same vowel sound for the whole scale, the  comparison will be appreciated; the pupil will not be conscious of any  change in the vocal organ or experience any difficulty in descending  the scale. Faithful advocates of the theory of many registers say:  \"Whenever in doubt about the production of a tone, sing _down_ to it  from some tone above it, never _upward_ from a tone below,\" for they  find that singing down \"blends the registers.\" This we believe is  because in singing down muscular and nerve tension is gradually  relaxed and consequently there is no \"register\" change in the voice.    A study of the church organ will, I think, make"]]]
