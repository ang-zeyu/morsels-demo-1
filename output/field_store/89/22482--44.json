BULGARIA AND KULTUR.    _In the semi-official Servian daily, Samouprava, published in Belgrade  and now at Nish, the following editorial article appeared early in the  first week of October, 1914:_    The Bulgarians are a queer people. Those of the foreigners who  sympathize with them are apt to call them realists, positivists, and  calculants, but we Servians, knowing them, understand that such  definitions applied to them are flattering euphemisms and nothing  more. The Bulgarian people are really laborious and thrifty.  Unfortunately the cultured members of Bulgarian society, who studied  abroad, bear in their social and political life the fundamental  characteristics of the German intellect.    The cultured Bulgarians have absorbed the German Kultur, although they  do not owe Germany even the hundredth part of what they owe to Russia.    All these are facts that need not proofs. Bulgaria, therefore, could  not more wantonly accuse Servia than by saying that we allied  ourselves with the enemies of Slavdom. The cynicism of these  accusations is proved by the following officially registered Bulgarian  actions:    The Stoilof Ministry has concluded an alliance with Servia and also an  understanding which the Bulgarians sold to Turkey for eight Bishoprics  in Macedonia.    During the crisis which followed the annexation of Servian Bosnia and  Herzegovina to Austria, and when Russia was mortally insulted,  Bulgaria, in common understanding with Austria, proclaimed her  independence and definitely annexed Oriental Rumelia. These profits  Bulgaria secured to the detriment of Servian interests.    During the Balkan war, and notwithstanding all that Servia had done  for Bulgaria, the Bulgarian attitude was once more treacherous,  culminating in the wanton attack upon her allies at the instigation of  Austria.    Today, when Russia fights a life-and-death struggle, Bulgaria is  keeping neutral, and every one knows what kind of neutrality is this  when such a multitude of Germans is passing through Bulgarian  territory in order to arm and lead the Turks against Russia. And, last  but not least, immediately after the present war between Austria and  Servia, the Bulgarians proposed an alliance to Rumania.    After all this it is a wonder how the Bulgarians dare to invoke Slav  sympathies, which they always sold to Austria, and which the Bulgarian  press is now trying to sell at auction. Lucky he who buys them.

Prince Leopold, Eldest Son of the King of the Belgians.    (_Photo from Underwood & Underwood._)]      AFTER FIVE MONTHS' FIGHTING.    _On Dec. 17, (30, New Style,) 1914, Crown Prince Alexander of Servia,  in his quality of Commander in Chief of the Army, issued the following  order of the day to his troops:_    Soldiers! It is now five months since the day when the enemy attacked  our beloved country. Notwithstanding the fact that we had suffered  the trials of two heroic but hard wars, nevertheless firm and  undaunted we have stood the attack. Having routed the enemy in Tchar  and Zadar we gave him, after heroic and sanguinary battles, the  biggest blow of all.    Thousands of prisoners, hundreds of guns, a quantity of war booty,  which came to our hands, are witnesses of his defeat and our glory.    Soldiers! I feel proud in announcing to you that not a single enemy  remains on the soil of the Servian Kingdom. We cast him out with great  losses.    At this sacred moment, when on the heroic City of Belgrade anew waves  the victorious Servian flag, I desire to fulfill a great duty of  gratitude. In our ranks, in this third war, are fighting our brothers  which we have liberated from the Turkish yoke. The soldiers of  Kossovo, of Vardar, of Hekligovatz, of Bregalnitsa, of Bitolie, and of  Porets, have shown themselves worthy of their brothers of Shumadia and  the Danube, of Poutrin and Morava, of Timok and Usjitsa.    They have shown themselves worthy of the heroes Milaten and Dughan,  who for long have carried the glory and the good name of the Servian  arms.    I want to give to these new soldiers of ours conspicuous proofs of the  gratitude of the fatherland. In the face of the undeniable proof of  their fulfillment of their duty, in the face of their enthusiasm I  declare that these soldiers shall have the political and  constitutional rights of Servia, their liberatrix! The Skuptschina, in  its first sitting after peace is signed, will take all the necessary  measures in order that full liberties be given to our brethren.    Soldiers! The iron ring of our powerful allies is fastening tighter  every day around our common enemy. And he, (the enemy,) feeling that  his defeat is well nigh at hand and dreading its dire consequences,  fights desperately and strenuously. But in vain. The number of their  soldiers is diminishing daily, and our allies are strengthened with  new troops on the fields of battle.    The end of this gigantic struggle is from now known, although not yet  accomplished. We must, therefore, for some time to come, fulfill our  difficult duty and stay by the side of our big and powerful allies,  who are fighting for us, till our enemy is annihilated on the  battlefield.    And then peace will come to crown worthily those who have been  sacrificed for our great fatherland, and then our country will be much  enlarged, much stronger, and much happier than she ever has been. And  for this, oh, my heroic Servia will be grateful to you.      RUSSIAN CONGRATULATIONS.    _On Dec. 18, 1914, the new Russian Minister to Servia, Prince  Troubetzkoi, presented his credentials to the Servian Crown Prince  Alexander, whom he addressed as follows:_    Illustrious Sir: I have the honor to hand to your Royal Highness the  letter by which his Majesty the Emperor of Russia has deigned to  accredit me by his Majesty the King of Servia.    My august master has charged me to express to you the vivid sympathy  and the sincere admiration which his Majesty feels for the valiant  people of Servia, her heroic army, and her venerable chief.    Allow me to express to your Highness the joy that I feel in fulfilling  the imperial commission today when your army has covered itself with  immortal glory and has written in Servian history the most beautiful  page that a people may desire.    Separated by a long distance, but, attracted by the heart of her elder  sister, Servia may say that in this terrible struggle against an  enemy, numerically stronger but morally weaker, she is not alone and  will not be forsaken.    I pray that this conviction may double the unflinching courage of the  Servians and lead them always to new victories.    In assuming today the duties incumbent upon me after the death of my  lamented predecessor, Hartwig, I take the courage, illustrious Sir, to  express the hope that your Highness will not deprive me of his  assistance, which will be absolutely necessary to me in order that I  may work to the best of my abilities for the common good of the two  countries, and also for the consummation of peace in the Balkan  Peninsula, this peace that Russia considers as the essential aim of  her efforts and her sacrifices.    _Crown Prince Alexander answered as follows:_    The expression of the vivid sympathy and admiration which his Majesty  the Emperor has addressed through you to the people and army of Servia  are so much the more welcome as I personally witnessed the hard  conditions under which my valiant army is struggling and the heavy  burdens oppressing my brave people.    The fact that, although separated by a long distance from Russia, her  elder sister, Servia can find in her bosom a heart having the same  sentiments as hers, has encouraged our army and our people to persist  in the heroic struggle that they are waging against a more numerous  enemy. This certainty will give us new strength to carry the struggle  to the end.    In the fulfillment of your mission, after the death of your  predecessor, a mission which the late Hartwig performed with such love  and such devotion to the true Slav interests, you can rest on my  absolute confidence and the continued support of my Government, being  sure that the greatness and the power of Servia are in full accord  with the greatness and the power of holy Russia.    The lamented Hartwig made many trips for the mutual benefit of both  countries, Russia and Servia, and his efforts had resulted in creating  stable conditions and securing the peace of the Balkans.    In accepting the letters, by which his Majesty the Emperor has  accredited you by his Majesty the King of Servia, my beloved father, I  bid you, Mr. Minister, welcome, and I wish you success in your  mission.      BULGARIA'S SENTIMENT.    _The following Bulgarian view of the Servian victory that resulted in  the recapture of Belgrade is presented from an editorial article of  the Dnevnik of Sofia:_    The Austro-Hungarian action against Servia seems to have failed. It  goes without saying that the return of the Servians to Belgrade does  not mean yet that the handful of the starving and half-naked Servian  Army has been victorious against its strong opponent.    The Servian success, according to latest information, is due to means  that are very little laudable in themselves.    The commander of the advance posts of the Austro-Hungarian Army, being  a native of Dalmatia, became intimate with the Servians and committed  an odious treason. He disclosed to them the dispositions of the  Austro-Hungarian forces, and he himself, with the sections forming the  guard, surrendered to the Servians.

The legends of dedication are of no historic value;  the story of the Palladium itself was unknown to Homer, though it  occurred in later epics. All that can be asserted of such images is that  they were of unknown antiquity, and that local patriotism claimed for  them a heroic origin. Much the same may be said of Daedalus. It need not  be discussed here whether an actual artist of this name ever existed.  The information we have as to Daedalus is of two kinds; on the one hand,  we find tales of a mythical craftsman and magician, to whose invention  many of the most typical improvements in early Greek sculpture are  attributed; on the other hand, we have records of many statues of the  gods, extant in historical times in various shrines of Greece, which  were attributed to him. Such attributions are not really of greater  historical value than the traditions of dedication in the heroic age  which we find elsewhere. The name of Daedalus having once become famous  in this connection, it was natural that many statues of primitive style  and unrecorded origin should be attributed to him. More importance may  be attached to the fact that the sculptors who actually made some of the  early statues of the gods in Athens and in the Peloponnesus are  described as the pupils or by some as the sons or companions of  Daedalus. In this way his name is associated with some of the early  schools that had the greatest influence in Greece, especially on the  representation of the gods in sculpture. There are other traditions of  early schools of sculptors, the marble workers of Chios, the bronze  founders of Samos, who devoted themselves mainly to making statues of  the gods, some of which survived throughout historical times. When we  turn from tradition and consider the early examples of statues of gods  that may still be seen or are recorded by extant copies, we find that  these fall into two classes. On the one hand, there are more or less  exact repetitions of the primitive stock or stone, the cylindrical  tree-trunk or the rectangular block cut from the quarry, with the rudest  indication of head and arms and feet, deviating as little as possible  from the original shape of the block. When images of this sort were, as  was often the case, of wood, they have, of course, disappeared; but we  can sometimes recognise copies of them upon reliefs or in stone. On the  other hand, we find another class of images which approximate more to  the attainments of Daedalus as described by rationalising writers of  later date. These images are completely in human form, and, if male, are  usually nude. They have their legs separated in a short stride, the left  foot being usually advanced; their arms are either set close to their  sides, or one or both of them is raised from the elbow; their whole  shape suggests a rigid system of proportions and a more or less  conventionalised form. These images have no resemblance to the  modifications of the primitive stocks and stones, and could not well be  directly derived from them; they are found in great numbers upon many  sites of early sanctity in Greece itself and in Greek settlements around  the Levant, notably in Cyprus, Rhodes, and Naucratis in Egypt. Sometimes  they seem to represent the god, sometimes the dedicator; but all alike  show the attempt of the early Greek craftsman to imitate the products of  more advanced and finished art which he saw around him. Many of them are  derived from Egyptian types; others show the influence of Mesopotamian  art, or of the hybrid craftsmanship of Phoenicia. The borrowing or  imitation of such foreign types may at first sight appear to show even  less promise of artistic progress than variations on the old native  images; but it is not in its origins, but in its development and  perfection that the chief excellence of Greek art is to be found.    The types borrowed by sculpture from foreign art are almost exclusively  of human form. The monstrous mixed forms in which the deities of Egypt  or Mesopotamia often found the expression of their superhuman and  mysterious powers do not seem to have appealed to the imagination of the  Greeks. Such mixed forms were, indeed, frequently borrowed by early  decorative art, and on \"Orientalising\" vases we constantly find  human-headed and bird-headed quadrupeds, usually winged, and  human-headed birds. The delight in winged figures generally, which was  mainly decorative in early times, also finds its origin in Oriental  woven stuffs. Greek sculpture adopted and translated into stone or  bronze some of these mixed types--notably the human-headed bird and the  human-headed winged lion; these it identified as the Siren and the  Sphinx of Greek myth, and associated them with the mysteries of the  tomb. To some other forms, that of the Centaur and the Satyr and the  Triton, it also gave considerable scope. But all these, if not human,  are hardly to be regarded as divine; they are mostly noxious, and, even  if benignant, do not attain the rank of gods. Perhaps a nearer approach  to divine character is to be found in the river-gods, who are often  represented as bulls with human heads or as human with bull's horns; but  here, too, we have only to deal with minor deities. No sculptor  represented Dionysus in this way, even though he was called  \"bull-shaped\" by poets; nor is the horse-god Posidon even represented as  a Centaur. The horse-headed Demeter of Phigalia remains the strange and  solitary exception, however we may explain her existence.    The process by which the early human types were gradually improved and  made more life-like, by a continuous struggle with technical  difficulties, by constant and direct observation of nature, and by the  building up of an artistic tradition in different schools and families,  is a question that concerns the history of art rather than our present  study. But it is impossible to distinguish rigidly between the two,  because these types, whether of the nude standing male figure, of the  draped female, or of the seated figure, are all of them used alike to  represent human and divine personages; and, apart from inscriptions of  dedication or conditions of discovery or distinctive attributes, it  would often be impossible to tell whether any particular statue was  meant to represent, for example, the image of a god or a conventional  portrait of a man. These nude male statues, commonly known by the name  of \"Apollo,\" were certainly, some of them, made to commemorate athletes,  whose images were set up either in the place where they won their  victories or in their native town; others were placed over graves as  memorials of the dead; and even in a sacred precinct it is sometimes  uncertain whether the god himself is represented or the worshipper who  dedicates this record of his devotion.    At this early period, therefore, Mr. Ruskin's strictures as to the  impossibility of distinguishing the individuality of the different gods  must be admitted, and even supplemented by an admission of the  impossibility of distinguishing gods and goddesses from human beings.  The explanation is obvious enough. During this age of early progress the  constant aim of the sculptor is to attain to complete mastery over the  material and to perfection of bodily form. In religious art, what  corresponds to this is the struggle towards anthropomorphism--first to  represent the gods in human form, and then to make that form the most  perfect that human art can devise. During this stage of artistic and  religious development the type and the ideal cannot be distinguished. It  was only when a type or a varying series of types had been brought to  perfection in the fifth century, so as to satisfy the demand for a  harmonious system of bodily proportions, for beauty of outline and  dignity of countenance, that these types could be used as a means of  expression for the religious ideals of the nation. In developing the  type the accidental has to be discarded, and with it much of the feeling  of individuality; works of early archaic art, for all their defects,  often show more sign of individual character than the more perfect works  of the earlier part of the fifth century. The attainment of the type is  followed by an infusion of character and individuality, drawn from the  artist's trained memory and observation with clear artistic intention,  not from the mere caprice of an accidental recollection or a casual  peculiarity of a model. The character and individuality thus expressed  must be considered in subsequent chapters; it is only necessary here to  distinguish it from the suggestion of an individual, almost of a  caricature, which we find sometimes in archaic art, and which is  certainly to be seen occasionally in works of Florentine sculpture.  During the period of the rise of Greek sculpture the various schools  were advancing each in its own way towards what has been called  naturalism in art, as opposed to realism on the one side and idealism on  the other. That is to say, they were striving by constant study of the  athletic form, of proportions and muscles, of drapery and hair, to  attain to a series of types both in harmony with themselves and in  accordance with nature; and they were too much absorbed in this attempt  to go far beyond their predecessors in rendering the character of the  gods according to the form consecrated by tradition. Even in the  expression of the face the same process is to be traced. In early works  we find sometimes no expression at all, or an apparent stolidity which  is really the absence of expression; in the archaic smile we see an  attempt to enliven the face, and possibly also, as we have noticed, to  express and even to induce the benignity of the deity. But this attempt,  made with inadequate artistic resources, tends to result in a mere  grimace; and as we approach the transitional age before the greatest  period of sculpture, we often find a"]]]
