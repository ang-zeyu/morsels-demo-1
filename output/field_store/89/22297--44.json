They tried several more shops, the  kinds where you buy toys and perfume and silk handkerchiefs and books,  and fancy boxes of stationery, and photographs of objects of interest in  the vicinity. But nobody cared to change a guinea that day in Rochester,  and as they went from shop to shop they got dirtier and dirtier, and  their hair got more and more untidy, and Jane slipped and fell down on a  part of the road where a water cart had just gone by. Also they got very  hungry, but they found no one would give them anything to eat for their  guineas.    After trying two baker shops in vain, they became so hungry, perhaps  from the smell of the cake in the shops, as Cyril suggested, that they  formed a plan of campaign in whispers and carried it out in desperation.  They marched into a third baker shop,--Beale was his name,--and before  the people behind the counter could interfere each child had seized  three new penny buns, clapped the three together between its dirty  hands, and taken a big bite out of the triple sandwich. Then they stood  at bay, with the twelve buns in their hands and their mouths very full  indeed. The shocked baker's man bounded round the corner.    \"Here,\" said Cyril, speaking as distinctly as he could, and holding out  the guinea he got ready before entering the shops, \"pay yourself out of  that.\"    Mr. Beale snatched the coin, bit it, and put it in his pocket.    [Illustration: Mr. Beale snatched the coin, bit it, and put it in his  pocket]    \"Off you go,\" he said, brief and stern like the man in the song.    \"But the change?\" said Anthea, who had a saving mind.    \"Change!\" said the man, \"I'll change you! Hout you goes; and you may  think yourselves lucky I don't send for the police to find out where you  got it!\"    In the Gardens of the Castle the millionaires finished the buns, and  though the curranty softness of these were delicious, and acted like a  charm in raising the spirits of the party, yet even the stoutest heart  quailed at the thought of venturing to sound Mr. Billy Peasemarsh at the  Saracen's Head on the subject of a horse and carriage. The boys would  have given up the idea, but Jane was always a hopeful child, and Anthea  generally an obstinate one, and their earnestness prevailed.    The whole party, by this time indescribably dirty, therefore betook  itself to the Saracen's Head. The yard-method of attack having been  successful at The Chequers, was tried again here. Mr. Peasemarsh was in  the yard, and Robert opened the business in these terms--    \"They tell me you have a lot of horses and carriages to sell.\" It had  been agreed that Robert should be spokesman, because in books it is  always gentlemen who buy horses, and not ladies, and Cyril had had his  go at the Blue Boar.    \"They tell you true, young man,\" said Mr. Peasemarsh. He was a long lean  man, with very blue eyes and a tight mouth and narrow lips.    \"We should like to buy some, please,\" said Robert politely.    \"I daresay you would.\"    \"Will you show us a few, please? To choose from.\"    \"Who are you a-kiddin of?\" inquired Mr. Billy Peasemarsh. \"Was you sent  here of a message?\"    \"I tell you,\" said Robert, \"we want to buy some horses and carriages,  and a man told us you were straight and civil spoken, but I shouldn't  wonder if he was mistaken\"--    \"Upon my sacred!\" said Mr. Peasemarsh. \"Shall I trot the whole stable  out for your Honor's worship to see? Or shall I send round to the  Bishop's to see if he's a nag or two to dispose of?\"    \"Please do,\" said Robert, \"if it's not too much trouble. It would be  very kind of you.\"    Mr. Peasemarsh put his hands in his pockets and laughed, and they did  not like the way he did it. Then he shouted \"Willum!\"    A stooping ostler appeared in a stable door.    \"Here, Willum, come and look at this 'ere young dook! Wants to buy the  whole stud, lock, stock, and bar'l. And ain't got tuppence in his  pocket to bless hisself with, I'll go bail!\"    Willum's eyes followed his master's pointing thumb with contemptuous  interest.    \"Do 'e, for sure?\" he said.    But Robert spoke, though both the girls were now pulling at his jacket  and begging him to \"come along.\" He spoke, and he was very angry; he  said--    \"I'm not a young duke, and I never pretended to be. And as for  tuppence--what do you call this?\" And before the others could stop him  he had pulled out two fat handfuls of shining guineas, and held them out  for Mr. Peasemarsh to look at. He did look. He snatched one up in his  finger and thumb. He bit it, and Jane expected him to say, \"The best  horse in my stables is at your service.\" But the others knew better.  Still it was a blow, even to the most desponding, when he said shortly--    \"Willum, shut the yard doors;\" and Willum grinned and went to shut them.    \"Good-afternoon,\" said Robert hastily; \"we shan't buy any horses now,  whatever you say, and I hope it'll be a lesson to you.\" He had seen a  little side gate open, and was moving towards it as he spoke. But Billy  Peasemarsh put himself in the way.    \"Not so fast, you young off-scouring!\" he said. \"Willum, fetch the  pleece.\"    Willum went. The children stood huddled together like frightened sheep,  and Mr. Peasemarsh spoke to them till the pleece arrived. He said many  things. Among other things he said--    \"Nice lot you are, aren't you, coming tempting honest men with your  guineas!\"    \"They _are_ our guineas,\" said Cyril boldly.    \"Oh, of course we don't know all about that, no more we don't--oh  no--course not! And dragging little gells into it, too. 'Ere--I'll let  the gells go if you'll come along to the pleece quiet.\"    \"We won't be let go,\" said Jane heroically; \"not without the boys. It's  our money just as much as theirs, you wicked old man.\"    \"Where'd you get it, then?\" said the man, softening slightly, which was  not at all what the boys expected when Jane began to call names.    Jane cast a silent glance of agony at the others.    \"Lost your tongue, eh? Got it fast enough when it's for calling names  with. Come, speak up! Where'd you get it?\"    \"Out of the gravel-pit,\" said truthful Jane.    \"Next article,\" said the man.    \"I tell you we did,\" Jane said. \"There's a fairy there--all over brown  fur--with ears like a bat's and eyes like a snail's, and he gives you a  wish a day, and they all come true.\"    \"Touched in the head, eh?\" said the man in a low voice; \"all the more  shame to you boys dragging the poor afflicted child into your sinful  burglaries.\"    \"She's not mad; it's true,\" said Anthea; \"there _is_ a fairy. If I ever  see him again I'll wish for something for you; at least I would if  vengeance wasn't wicked--so there!\"    \"Lor' lumme,\" said Billy Peasemarsh, \"if there ain't another on 'em!\"    And now Willum came back, with a spiteful grin on his face, and at his  back a policeman, with whom Mr. Peasemarsh spoke long in a hoarse  earnest whisper.    \"I daresay you're right,\" said the policeman at last. \"Anyway, I'll take  'em up on a charge of unlawful possession, pending inquiries. And the  magistrate will deal with the case. Send the afflicted ones to a home,  as likely as not, and the boys to a reformatory. Now then, come along,  youngsters! No use making a fuss. You bring the gells along, Mr.  Peasemarsh, sir, and I'll shepherd the boys.\"    Speechless with rage and horror, the four children were driven along the  streets of Rochester. Tears of anger and shame blinded them, so that  when Robert ran right into a passer-by he did not recognise her till a  well-known voice said, \"Well, if ever I did! Oh, Master Robert, whatever  have you been a-doing of now?\" And another voice, quite as well known,  said, \"Panty; want go own Panty!\"    They had run into Martha and the Baby!    [Illustration: They had run into Martha and the baby]    Martha behaved admirably. She refused to believe a word of the  policeman's story, or of Mr. Peasemarsh's either, even when they made  Robert turn out his pockets in an archway and show the guineas.    \"I don't see nothing,\" she said. \"You've gone out of your senses, you  two! There ain't any gold there--only the poor child's hands, all over  dirt, and like the very chimbley. Oh that I should ever see the day!\"    And the children thought this very noble of Martha, even if rather  wicked, till they remembered how the Fairy had promised that the  servants should never notice any of the fairy gifts. So of course Martha  couldn't see the gold, and so was only speaking the truth, and that was  quite right, of course, but not extra noble.    It was getting dusk when they reached the police-station. The policeman  told his tale to an inspector, who sat in a large bare room with a thing  like a clumsy nursery-fender at one end to put prisoners in. Robert  wondered whether it was a cell or a dock.    \"Produce the coins, officer,\" said the inspector.    \"Turn out your pockets,\" said the constable.    Cyril desperately plunged his hands in his pockets, stood still a  moment, and then began to laugh--an odd sort of laugh that hurt, and  that felt much more like crying. His pockets were empty. So were the  pockets of the others. For of course at sunset all the fairy gold had  vanished away.    \"Turn out your pockets, and stop that noise,\" said the inspector.    Cyril turned out his pockets, every one of the nine which enriched his  suit. And every pocket was empty.    \"Well!\" said the inspector.    \"I don't know how they done it--artful little beggars! They walked in  front of me the 'ole way, so as for me to keep my eye on them and not to  attract a crowd and obstruct the traffic.\"    \"It's very remarkable,\" said the inspector, frowning.    \"If you've done a-browbeating of the innocent children,\" said Martha,  \"I'll hire a private carriage and we'll drive home to their papa's  mansion.

The early Babylonians buried at full length, as far  as we know. On the same \"Stele of Vultures,\" which has already been  mentioned, we see the burying at full length of dead warriors. [* See  illustration.] There is no trace of any _early_ burial in Babylonia in  the cramped position. The tombs at Warka (Erech) with cramped bodies  in pottery coffins are of very late date. A further point arises with  regard to embalming. The Neolithic Egyptians did not embalm the dead.  Usually their cramped bodies are found as skeletons. When they are  mummified, it is merely owing to the preservative action of the salt  in the soil, not to any process of embalming. The second, or x race,  however, evidently introduced the custom of embalming as well as that  of burial at full length and the use of coffins. The Neolithic Egyptian  used no box or coffin, the nearest approach to this being a pot, which  was inverted over the coiled up body. Usually only a mat was put over  the body.    [Illustration: 038.jpg Portion of the \"Stele of Vultures\" Found at  Telloh]    [Illustration: 038-text.jpg]    Now it is evident that Babylonians and Assyrians, who buried the dead at  full length in chests, had some knowledge of embalming. An Assyrian king  tells us how he buried his royal father:--         \"Within the grave, the secret place,       In kingly oil, I gently laid him.       The grave-stone marketh his resting-place.       With mighty bronze I sealed its entrance,       And I protected it with an incantation.\"    The \"kingly oil\" was evidently used with the idea of preserving the body  from decay. Salt also was used to preserve the dead, and Herodotus  says that the Babylonians buried in honey, which was also used by the  Egyptians. No doubt the Babylonian method was less perfect than the  Egyptian, but the comparison is an interesting one, when taken in  connection with the other points of resemblance mentioned above.    We find, then, that an analysis of the Egyptian language reveals a  Semitic element in it; that the early dynastic culture had certain  characteristics which were unknown to the Neolithic Egyptians but are  closely parallelled in early Babylonia; that there were two elements in  the Egyptian religion, one of which seems to have originally belonged to  the Neolithic people, while the other has a Semitic appearance; and that  there were two sets of burial customs in early Egypt, one, that of the  Neolithic people, the other evidently that of a conquering race, which  eventually prevailed over the former; these later rites were analogous  to those of the Babylonians and Assyrians, though differing from them  in points of detail. The conclusion is that the x or conquering race  was Semitic and brought to Egypt the Semitic elements in the Egyptian  religion and a culture originally derived from that of the Sumerian  inhabitants of Babylonia, the non-Semitic parent of all Semitic  civilizations.    The question now arises, how did this Semitic people reach Egypt? We  have the choice of two points of entry: First, Heliopolis in the North,  where the Semitic sun-worship took root, and, second, the Wadi Hamma-mat  in the South, north of Edfu, the southern centre of sun-worship, and  Hierakonpolis (Nekheb-Nekhen), the capital of the Upper Egyptian kingdom  which existed before the foundation of the monarchy. The legends which  seem to bring the ancestors of the Egyptians from the Red Sea coast have  already been mentioned. They are closely connected with the worship  of the Sky and Sun god Horus of Edfu. Hathor, his nurse, the \"House of  Horus,\" the centre of whose worship was at Dendera, immediately opposite  the mouth of the Wadi Hammamat, was said to have come from Ta-neter,  \"The Holy Land,\" i.e. Abyssinia or the Red Sea coast, with the company  or _paut_ of the gods. Now the Egyptians always seem to have had some  idea that they were connected racially with the inhabitants of the Land  of Punt or Puenet, the modern Abyssinia and Somaliland. In the time of  the XVIIIth Dynasty they depicted the inhabitants of Punt as greatly  resembling themselves in form, feature, and dress, and as wearing the  little turned-up beard which was worn by the Egyptians of the earliest  times, but even as early as the IVth Dynasty was reserved for the  gods. Further, the word _Punt_ is always written without the hieroglyph  determinative of a foreign country, thus showing that the Egyptians did  not regard the Punites as foreigners. This certainly looks as if the  Punites were a portion of the great migration from Arabia, left behind  on the African shore when the rest of the wandering people pressed on  northwards to the Wadi Hammamat and the Nile. It may be that the modern  Gallas and Abyssinians are descendants of these Punites.    Now the Sky-god of Edfu is in legend a conquering hero who advances down  the Nile valley, with his _Mesniu_, or \"Smiths,\" to overthrow the people  of the North, whom he defeats in a great battle near Dendera. This may  be a reminiscence of the first fights of the invaders with the Neolithic  inhabitants. The other form of Horus, \"Horus, son of Isis,\" has also a  body of retainers, the _Shemsu-Heru_, or \"Followers of Horns,\" who are  spoken of in late texts as the rulers of Egypt before the monarchy. They  evidently correspond to the dynasties of _Manes_,    [Illustration: 041greek.jpg]    or \"Ghosts,\" of Manetho, and are probably intended for the early kings  of Hierakonpolis.    The mention of the Followers of Horus as \"Smiths\" is very interesting,  for it would appear to show that the Semitic conquerors were notable  as metal-users, that, in fact, their conquest was that old story in the  dawn of the world's history, the utter overthrow and subjection of the  stone-users by the metal-users, the primeval tragedy of the supersession  of flint by copper. This may be, but if the \"Smiths\" were the Semitic  conquerors who founded the kingdom, it would appear that the use of  copper was known in Egypt to some extent before their arrival, for we  find it in the graves of the late Neolithic Egyptians, very sparsely  from \"sequence-date 30\" to \"45,\" but afterwards more commonly. It was  evidently becoming known. The supposition, however, that the \"Smiths\"  were the Semitic conquerors, and that they won their way by the aid of  their superior weapons of metal, may be provisionally accepted.    In favour of the view which would bring the conquerors by way of the  Wadi Hammamat, an interesting discovery may be quoted. Immediately  opposite Den-dera, where, according to the legend, the battle between  the _Mesniu_ and the aborigines took place, lies Koptos, at the mouth of  the Wadi Hammamat. Here, in 1894, underneath the pavement of the ancient  temple, Prof. Petrie found remains which he then diagnosed as belonging  to the most ancient epoch of Egyptian history. Among them were some  extremely archaic statues of the god Min, on which were curious  scratched drawings of bears, _crioceras-shells_, elephants walking over  hills, etc., of the most primitive description. With them were lions'  heads and birds of a style then unknown, but which we now know to belong  to the period of the beginning of the Ist Dynasty. But the statues of  Min are older. The _crioceras-shells_ belong to the Red Sea. Are we to  see in these statues the holy images of the conquerors from the Red Sea  who reached the Nile valley by way of the Wadi Hammamat, and set up the  first memorials of their presence at Koptos? It may be so, or the Min  statues may be older than the conquerors, and belong to the Neolithic  race, since Min and his fetish (which we find on the slate palette from  el-'Amra, already mentioned) seem to belong to the indigenous Nilotes.  In any case we have in these statues, two of which are in the Ashmolean  Museum at Oxford, probably the most ancient cult-images in the world:    This theory, which would make all the Neolithic inhabitants of Egypt  one people, who were conquered by a Semitic race, bringing a culture of  Sumerian origin to Egypt by way of the Wadi Hammamat, is that generally  accepted at the present time. It may, however, eventually prove  necessary to modify it. For reasons given above, it may well be that the  Neolithic population was itself not indigenous, and that it reached the  Nile valley by way of the Wadi Hammamat, spreading north and south  from the mouth of the _wadi_. It may also be considered probable that  a Semitic wave invaded Egypt by way of the Isthmus of Suez, where  the early sun-cultus of Heliopolis probably marks a primeval Semitic  settlement. In that case it would seem that the _Mesniu_ or \"Smiths,\"  who introduced the use of metal, would have to be referred to the  originally Neolithic pre-Semitic people, who certainly were acquainted  with the use of copper, though not to any great extent. But this is not  a necessary supposition. The _Mesniu_ are closely connected with the  Sky-god Horus, who was possibly of Semitic origin, and another Semitic  wave, quite distinct from that which entered Egypt by way of the  Isthmus, may very well also have reached Egypt by the Wadi Hammamat, or,  equally possibly, from the far south, coming down to the Nile from the  Abyssinian mountains. The legend of the coming of Hathor from Ta-neter  may refer to some such wandering, and we know that the Egyptians of the  Old Kingdom communicated with the Land of Punt, not by way of the Red  Sea coast as Hatshepsut did, but by way of the Upper Nile. This would  tally well with the march of the _Mesniu_ northwards from Edfu to their  battle with the forces of Set at Dendera.    In any case, at the dawn of connected Egyptian history, we find two main  centres of civilization in Egypt, Heliopolis and Buto in the Delta  in the North, and Edfu and Hierakonpolis in the South. Here were  established at the beginning of the Chalcolithic stage of culture, we  may say, two kingdoms, of Lower and Upper"]]]
