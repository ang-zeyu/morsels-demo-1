You've got to be prosecuted before  you can go back anywhere.'    'I'd rather be persecuted than go down that ladder again,' he said.  'I suppose it won't be very bad--being persecuted, I mean?'    His idea of persecution was derived from books. He thought it  to be something vaguely unpleasant from which one escaped in  disguise--adventurous and always successful.    'That's for the judges to decide,' said the captain, 'it's a serious  thing trespassing in our city. This guard is put here expressly to  prevent it.'    'Do you have many trespassers?' Philip asked. The captain seemed kind,  and Philip had a great-uncle who was a judge, so the word judges made  him think of tips and good advice, rather than of justice and  punishment.    'Many trespassers indeed!' the captain almost snorted his answer.  'That's just it. There's never been one before. You're the first. For  years and years and years there's been a guard here, because when the  town was first built the astrologers foretold that some day there would  be a trespasser who would do untold mischief. So it's our  privilege--we're the Polistopolitan guards--to keep watch over the only  way by which a trespasser could come in.'    'May I sit down?' said Philip suddenly, and the soldiers made room for  him on the bench.    'My father and my grandfather and all my ancestors were in the guards,'  said the captain proudly. 'It's a very great honour.'    'I wonder,' said Philip, 'why you don't cut off the end of your  ladder--the top end I mean; then nobody could come up.'    'That would never do,' said the captain, 'because, you see, there's  another prophecy. The great deliverer is to come that way.'    'Couldn't I,' suggested Philip shyly, 'couldn't I be the deliverer  instead of the trespasser? I'd much rather, you know.'    'I daresay you would,' said the captain; 'but people can't be deliverers  just because they'd much rather, you know.'    'And isn't any one to come up the ladder bridge except just those two?'    'We don't know; that's just it. You know what prophecies are.'    'I'm afraid I don't--exactly.'    'So vague and mixed up, I mean. The one I'm telling you about goes  something like this.              Who comes up the ladder stair?              Beware, beware,            Steely eyes and copper hair            Strife and grief and pain to bear            All come up the ladder stair.    You see we can't tell whether that means one person or a lot of people  with steely eyes and copper hair.'    'My hair's just plain boy-colour,' said Philip; 'my sister says so, and  my eyes are blue, I believe.'    'I can't see in this light;' the captain leaned his elbows on the table  and looked earnestly in the boy's eyes. 'No, I can't see. The other  prophecy goes:              From down and down and very far down            The king shall come to take his own;            He shall deliver the Magic town,            And all that he made shall be his own.            Beware, take care. Beware, prepare,            The king shall come by the ladder stair.    'How jolly,' said Philip; 'I love poetry. Do you know any more?'    'There are heaps of prophecies of course,' said the captain; 'the  astrologers must do _something_ to earn their pay. There's rather a nice  one:              Every night when the bright stars blink            The guards shall turn out, and have a drink            As the clock strikes two.            And every night when no stars are seen            The guards shall drink in their own canteen            When the clock strikes two.    To-night there aren't any stars, so we have the drinks served here. It's  less trouble than going across the square to the canteen, and the  principle's the same. Principle is the great thing with a prophecy, my  boy.'    'Yes,' said Philip. And then the far-away bell beat again. One, two. And  outside was a light patter of feet.    A soldier rose--saluted his officer and threw open the door. There was a  moment's pause; Philip expected some one to come in with a tray and  glasses, as they did at his great-uncle's when gentlemen were suddenly  thirsty at times that were not meal-times.    But instead, after a moment's pause, a dozen greyhounds stepped daintily  in on their padded cat-like feet; and round the neck of each dog was  slung a roundish thing that looked like one of the little barrels which  St. Bernard dogs wear round their necks in the pictures. And when these  were loosened and laid on the table Philip was charmed to see that the  roundish things were not barrels but cocoa-nuts.    The soldiers reached down some pewter pots from a high shelf--pierced  the cocoa-nuts with their bayonets and poured out the cocoa-nut milk.  They all had drinks, so the prophecy came true, and what is more they  gave Philip a drink as well. It was delicious, and there was as much of  it as he wanted. I have never had as much cocoa-nut milk as I wanted.  Have you?    Then the hollow cocoa-nuts were tied on to the dogs' necks again and out  they went, slim and beautiful, two by two, wagging their slender tails,  in the most amiable and orderly way.    'They take the cocoa-nuts to the town kitchen,' said the captain, 'to be  made into cocoa-nut ice for the army breakfast; waste not want not, you  know. We don't waste anything here, my boy.' Philip had quite got over  his snubbing. He now felt that the captain was talking with him as man  to man. Helen had gone away and left him; well, he was learning to do  without Helen. And he had got away from the Grange, and Lucy, and that  nurse. He was a man among men. And then, just as he was feeling most  manly and important, and quite equal to facing any number of judges,  there came a little tap at the door of the guard-room, and a very little  voice said:    'Oh, do please let me come in.'    Then the door opened slowly.    'Well, come in, whoever you are,' said the captain. And the person who  came in was--Lucy. Lucy, whom Philip thought he had got rid of--Lucy,  who stood for the new hateful life to which Helen had left him. Lucy, in  her serge skirt and jersey, with her little sleek fair pig-tails, and  that anxious 'I-wish-we-could-be-friends' smile of hers. Philip was  furious. It was too bad.    'And who is this?' the captain was saying kindly.    'It's me--it's Lucy,' she said. 'I came up with _him_.'    She pointed to Philip. 'No manners,' thought Philip in bitterness.    'No, you didn't,' he said shortly.    'I did--I was close behind you when you were climbing the ladder bridge.  And I've been waiting alone ever since, when you were asleep and all. I  _knew_ he'd be cross when he knew I'd come,' she explained to the  soldiers.    'I'm _not_ cross,' said Philip very crossly indeed, but the captain  signed to him to be silent. Then Lucy was questioned and her answers  written in the book, and when that was done the captain said:    'So this little girl is a friend of yours?'    'No, she isn't,' said Philip violently; 'she's not my friend, and she  never will be. I've seen her, that's all, and I don't want to see her  again.'    'You _are_ unkind,' said Lucy.    And then there was a grave silence, most unpleasant to Philip. The  soldiers, he perceived, now looked coldly at him. It was all Lucy's  fault. What did she want to come shoving in for, spoiling everything?  Any one but a girl would have known that a guard-room wasn't the right  place for a girl. He frowned and said nothing. Lucy had smuggled up  against the captain's knee, and he was stroking her hair.    'Poor little woman,' he said. 'You must go to sleep now, so as to be  rested before you go to the Hall of Justice in the morning.'    They made Lucy a bed of soldiers' cloaks laid on a bench; and bearskins  are the best of pillows. Philip had a soldier's cloak and a bench, and a  bearskin too--but what was the good? Everything was spoiled. If Lucy had  not come the guard-room as a sleeping-place would have been almost as  good as the tented field. But she _had_ come, and the guard-room was no  better now than any old night-nursery. And how had she known? How had  she come? How had she made her way to that illimitable prairie where he  had found the mysterious beginning of the ladder bridge? He went to  sleep a bunched-up lump of prickly discontent and suppressed fury.    When he woke it was bright daylight, and a soldier was saying, 'Wake up,  Trespassers. Breakfast----'    'How jolly,' thought Philip, 'to be having military breakfast.' Then he  remembered Lucy, and hated her being there, and felt once more that she  had spoiled everything.    I should not, myself, care for a breakfast of cocoa-nut ice, peppermint  creams, apples, bread and butter and sweet milk. But the soldiers seemed  to enjoy it. And it would have exactly suited Philip if he had not seen  that Lucy was enjoying it too.    'I do hate greedy girls,' he told himself, for he was now in that state  of black rage when you hate everything the person you are angry with  does or says or is.    And now it was time to start for the Hall of Justice. The guard formed  outside, and Philip noticed that each soldier stood on a sort of green  mat. When the order to march was given, each soldier quickly and  expertly rolled up his green mat and put it under his arm. And whenever  they stopped, because of the crowd, each soldier unrolled his green mat,  and stood on it till it was time to go on again. And they had to stop  several times, for the crowd was very thick in the great squares and in  the narrow streets of the city. It was a wonderful crowd. There were men  and women and children in every sort of dress. Italian, Spanish,  Russian; French peasants in blue blouses and wooden shoes, workmen in  the dress English working people wore a hundred years ago. Norwegians,  Swedes, Swiss, Turks, Greeks, Indians, Arabians, Chinese, Japanese,  besides Red Indians in dresses of skins, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20607"],[0,"Rembrandt (#5)"],[1,"down the panel like mud!\" But it was only his conscientious  narrow-mindedness which made him say it. Genius never fails to get into  conflict with narrow thought.    But now let us turn our attention to the left-hand corner. There we see  that pithy soldier all in red. Rembrandt, with his intuitive knowledge  of chiaroscuro, was not afraid of painting a figure all in red. He knew  that the play of light and shade on the colour would help him out. Here  part of the red is toned down by a beautiful soft tint, which makes the  whole figure blend harmoniously with the greyish-green of the others.  This man in red, too, has been treated in the same masterly manner of  which I spoke above. If one looks at him attentively, it seems as if the  man, who apparently might step out of the canvas at any rate, had been  painted with one powerful sweep of the brush. How firm is the treatment  of the hand loading the gun; how true the shadows on the red hat and  jerkin. There the figure stands, alert, living, full of movement, rich  in colour.    In this marvellous picture we come across something striking at every  turn. How life-like is the halberdier looking over his shoulder; and the  man who is inspecting his gun, just behind the figure in white; observe  the wonderful effect of the laughing boy in the grey hat against the  dark background. Even the pillar which serves as a background to the man  with the helmet adds to the harmony of the whole.    But here we meet with something peculiar! What is that quaint little  girl doing among all those men?    [Illustration: PLATE VIII.--HEAD OF A YOUNG MAN. (Unknown)    In the Louvre]    Numbers of critics have racked their brains about the meaning of  different details. But if Rembrandt could have heard them, he would have  answered with a laugh, \"Don't you see that I only wanted this child as a  focus for the light, and a contrast with all the downward lines and dark  colours?\"    The man with the banner in the background, the dog running away, all  these details help each other to carry out the effect of line and  colour. There is not a square inch in this canvas which does not betray  a rare talent. This is a case in which the assertion, \"Cut me a piece  out of a picture and I will tell you if it is by an artist,\" could  successfully be applied.    Now, I hope my readers won't object to accompanying me a little further,  and stopping with me before the \"Syndics.\" There it hangs, the great  simple canvas, quite different in character from the \"Night Patrol.\"    Everything here is dignified and stately. The whole picture is a  glorious witness to the consummate knowledge the master possessed of  expressing the individual soul in the human face. Here they sit, those  old Dutch fathers, assembled in solemn conclave, debating about their  trade, with the books on the table in front of them; and Rembrandt has  painted these heads so true to life that in the course of years they  have become like old friends; yes, old friends, though they lived  hundreds of years before we were dreamt of.    How long have I known that man on the left, with his hand on the knob of  his arm-chair, and the fine grey hair on his broad wrinkled brow showing  from under the high steeple-hat? The flesh tints in the face, whether  catching the full light, or partly veiled by shadows, display an endless  variety of shades, and the neutral greens and reds, greys and yellows,  are put against each other in such a wonderful manner that an effect  has been attained which strikes us dumb with admiration. The way in  which he is made to stand out from the background is in itself  marvellous, but just look at the man! how full of life and understanding  is the look in those eyes. It is something quite unique, something  Rembrandt himself has never surpassed.    And then there are the other figures; the man who is leaning forward;  the one sitting right in front of the book, his neighbour; even the  fifth merchant on the right, with his servant behind him--one and all  are full of life and light.    The background is such as Rembrandt only, with his understanding of  lines, could have devised. The wall and the panelling shut in the  composition in such a way that one cannot possibly imagine it ever  having been otherwise. And even this skilful touch is made subordinate  to the warm red colour of the tablecloth, which lends the picture an  additional depth.    I don't know whether this picture was very much discussed by Rembrandt's  contemporaries when it was finished. But to us, who have seen so much of  the art of the great Italians, Germans, and Spaniards, these heads are  the highest achievement of the art of painting.    When I was in Madrid, where I was charmed by Velasquez' work, our party  was one day walking through the broad streets of the capital. Passing a  large, picturesque building, our attention was attracted by a gaudy  poster informing us that an exhibition of the works of modern Spanish  artists was being held within. Our curiosity being aroused, we entered,  and found that in this country, where so many famous artists lived and  worked, there are among the modern artists many studious, highly  talented men, who serve their art with true love and devotion. But  suddenly it seemed as if we had been carried by magic from Spain back to  Amsterdam. We had come face to face with a copy of the \"Syndics,\"  painted by a Spanish artist during a stay in Amsterdam.    Was it national prejudice, or was it conviction? I don't know; but this  copy spoke to us of a spirit of greater simplicity, of a truer  conception of the nature and dignity of mankind than anything we had  admired in the Prado. Yes; this picture even kills its own Dutch  brothers. It makes Van der Helst look superficial, and Franz Hals  unfinished and flat. So much thoroughness and depth combined with such  freedom and grace of movement is not to be found anywhere else.    These people have lived on the canvas for centuries, and they will  outlive us all. And the man who achieved this masterpiece was at the  time of its production a poor, struggling burgher living in an obscure  corner of the town where his tercentenary festival was lately  celebrated.      III    But this is not the place for the sad reflections which are awakened in  our minds on examining the records of him whose name the world now  glorifies and raises to the skies. Better to honour the great master  who, for so many centuries, has held the world in awed admiration. There  is no need to-day to drag Rembrandt forth from the obscurity of the past  to save him from oblivion; we were not obliged to cleanse his image from  the dust of ages before showing to the world this unequalled genius to  whom Holland proudly points as one of her own sons.    On the contrary, never was Rembrandt's art valued so highly as it is  now. Archives and documents are searched for details about his life and  works. We want to know all about his life, and are anxious to share his  inmost feelings in prosperity and adversity. The houses where he lived  are marked down and bought by art-lovers. At the present time Rembrandt  is in the zenith of his glory. Gold loses its value where his pictures  are concerned. Fortunes are spent to secure the most insignificant of  his works; people travel across continents to see them; and criticism,  which for long years did little more than snarl at Rembrandt, has for  nearly fifty years been dumb.    It is remarkable that none of the great painters have, in the course of  years, been subjected to so much criticism as Rembrandt. And  notwithstanding all the things which have been said about the  improbability of the scene, and the exaggeration of the dark background,  the \"Night Patrol\" is now, as it ever was and ever will be, the \"World's  wonder,\" as our English neighbours say.    During his lifetime there were people who condemned Rembrandt because he  refused to follow in the footsteps of the old Italian painters, because  he persisted in painting nature as he saw it.    To us such a reproach seems strange, yet it is quite true. Even during  the last years of Rembrandt's life a growing dissatisfaction with the  existing ideas on art and literature had taken possession of the Dutch  mind. People developed a morbid taste for everything classical; and when  I read in the prose works and poems of these days the Latinised names  and the constant allusions to Greek gods and goddesses and mythological  personages, so strangely out of place under our northern sky, I am  filled with disgust.    It was fortunate, indeed, that Rembrandt always felt strong in his own  conviction and only followed his own views. For many years after his  death, even as late as the middle of the nineteenth century, a number of  art critics raised objections against the dangerous theories of which  his pictures were the expression. Again and again they attacked his  technical treatment; none of them ever grasped its deeper, fuller  meaning.    Happily those days are far behind us. A great number of books and  pamphlets have been published on Rembrandt during the last fifty years,  and they are almost unanimous in their praise and admiration of the  great master. The more liberal feelings of the modern world have  achieved some victories in the realms of art as well as elsewhere. We  moderns feel that the apparent shortcomings and exaggerations are  nothing but the inevitable peculiarities attendant upon genius. And we  even go so far that we would not have him be without a single one of  them, for fear of losing the slightest trait in the character of the  great man whose every movement roused our intellectual faculties.    So Rembrandt has been raised in our days to the pinnacle of fame which  is his by right; the festival of his tercentenary was acknowledged by  the whole civilised world as the natural utterance of joy and pride of  our small country in being able to count among its "]]]
