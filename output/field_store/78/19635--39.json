[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20521"],[0,"The New York Times Current History, A Monthly Magazine (#5)"],[1,"to The London Gazette published yesterday morning  contains the following:_         NOTICE.         Owing to hostile acts committed by Turkish forces under       German officers, a state of war exists between Great Britain       and Turkey as from today.         Foreign Office, Nov. 5, 1914.    Following this notice is a proclamation extending to the war with  Turkey the Proclamations and Orders in Council now in force relating  to the war, other than the Order in Council of Aug. 4, 1914, with  reference to the departure from British ports of enemy vessels which,  at the outbreak of hostilities, were in such ports or subsequently  entered the same.    The Gazette also contains an Order in Council, dated Nov. 5, annexing  the Island of Cyprus.    The order, after reciting the Convention of June 4, 1878, the Annex  thereto, and the Agreement of Aug. 14, 1878, by which the Sultan of  Turkey assigned the Island of Cyprus to be occupied and administered  by England, and affirming that by reason of the outbreak of  hostilities with Turkey the Convention, Annex, and Agreement have  become annulled, asserts that it has seemed expedient to annex the  island. His Majesty, with the advice of his Privy Council, has  therefore ordered:         From and after the date hereof the said island shall be       annexed to and form part of his Majesty's dominions, and the       said island is annexed accordingly.      EGYPT'S NEW SULTAN.    _The New Sultan of Egypt, Hussein I., made his State entry on Dec. 20,  1914, into the Abdin Palace, in Cairo. The streets were lined with  troops and the progress of their new ruler was watched by thousands of  enthusiastic spectators. The King of England sent a telegram to the  Sultan, to which his Highness replied thanking his Majesty for the  promised British support. A new Cabinet had already been formed.  Rushdi Pasha retained the position of Prime Minister and the portfolio  of the Interior. Following is King George's telegram to the Sultan:_    On the occasion when your Highness enters upon your high office I  desire to convey to your Highness the expression of my most sincere  friendship and the assurance of my unfailing support in safeguarding  the integrity of Egypt and in securing her future well-being and  prosperity.    Your Highness has been called upon to undertake the responsibilities  of your high office at a grave crisis in the national life of Egypt,  and I feel convinced that you will be able, with the co-operation of  your Ministers and the Protectorate of Great Britain, successfully to  overcome all the influences which are seeking to destroy the  independence of Egypt and the wealth, liberty, and happiness of its  people.    GEORGE R. AND I.      _The Sultan telegraphed the following reply:_    To his Majesty the King, London.    I present to your Majesty the expression of my deepest gratitude for  the feelings of friendship with which you see fit to honor me and for  the assurance of your valuable support in safeguarding the integrity  and independence of Egypt.    Conscious of the responsibilities I have just assumed, and resolved to  devote myself, in entire co-operation with the Protectorate, to the  progress and welfare of my people, I am happy to be able to count in  this task on your Majesty's protection and on the assistance of your  Government.    HUSSEIN KAMEL.          Servia and Her Neighbors         The utterances of Servia's statesmen and people since the       war began have not appeared in English. Only accounts of       fighting by the nation from which the great conflagration       started have been printed. How Servia has judged the issues       while conducting her struggle against annihilation, and how       the neighboring Balkan States regard her, are       authoritatively presented below.      _Premier Pashitch spoke in the Skuptschina, or Servian Parliament, on  Aug. 4, 1914, and made the following declaration given to the press by  the Official Servian Bureau:_    Mr. Pashitch laid stress on the fact that the Serajevo affair was used  as pretext for the war, desired long ago by the Austrian Monarchy,  which did not look on Pan-Serbism with a favorable eye, while the  aspirations of other countries of Rumania, Germany, and Italy were  tolerated. The Austro-Hungarian Monarchy wished to crush Servian  aspirations by curbing the Servian prestige.    In answering the Austrian note, Mr. Pashitch said, we reached the  extreme limits of submission to her demands. We did everything in  order to avoid the conflict and prove that we were peaceful. Now, all  united, we will defend our rights.    We rely on the sympathy and support of great and sisterly Russia, who  knows that our foes have been conspiring against our independence and  our progress, and who will not permit our prestige to be crushed. At  the side of Russia we have other friends.    (Long live Russia! Long live England! Long live France! Long live the  Triple Entente!)    I thank the Opposition--continued Mr. Pashitch--because she has united  with us in these critical moments, forgetting in the face of danger  party lines and the dissension of opinions.    _From Nish the following official communication was telegraphed to the  foreign press by the Government Bureau on Aug. 9, 1914:_    The Servian mobilization was effected with marvelous order, and once  more it proved the good military organization of Servia, and how much  the country can rely on the patriotic devotion of her soldiers.    Notwithstanding the erroneous statements of a part of the foreign  press, notwithstanding the speedy development of events,  notwithstanding the season of work in the fields, fully 80 per cent.  of the reserves presented themselves on the first day of mobilization,  which was completed amid general enthusiasm.    For a long time the Servians knew that the main struggle would be  turned against Austria. The Montenegrin and Servian peoples enter the  war against the common foe with an equal confidence in their armies.  The enthusiasm of these two countries is all the stronger from the  fact that they are fighting simultaneously with the aid of the  Russians, French, and English. Numerous manifestations have taken  place in Servian and Montenegrin cities in favor of Russia, France,  and England.      THE BULGARIAN MENACE.    _Following is the account of the declaration of the Servian Minister  of Commerce, Mr. Paul Maringovich, published in the Bulgarian  newspaper Mir of Sofia in November, 1914:_    Mr. Maringovich's declarations are characteristic of the  Serbo-Bulgarian relations. This Servian statesman at first spoke of  the trials of the Servian Nation on account of the war, and then  expressed the belief that these trials will pass and Servia will see  better days with the realization of her ideals. Mr. Maringovich  predicts that the differences between Servia and Bulgaria will be  settled in the future and that the two peoples will live in perfect  harmony.    Regarding the Serbo-Bulgarian relations Mr. Maringovich said in the  Mir:    \"I am sorry to hear that Bulgaria demands concessions from us. In  exchange for her friendship she demands concessions in Macedonia. But  in this case that cannot be called friendship.    \"Bulgaria demands this today because we are at war with Austria, and  we cannot accordingly oppose her. But in doing this she simply betrays  her weakness because it is a certain proof of weakness to strike one  from behind while he is struggling with another. If Bulgaria is proud  and strong she can measure herself with us as soon as the war with  Austria is over. A strong Bulgaria must measure herself with the  strong and not with the weak.    \"Why do people in Bulgaria today insist on concessions? Do you know  how many difficulties there are today in the granting of such  territorial concessions? You felt the pain of similar action.  Silistria was taken from you while your army was victoriously marching  on Constantinople. Do not insist on implanting deep in the Servian  heart a mortal hatred against yourselves.    \"Do not ask the reason of our dissensions of today, in a difference of  interests, because such difference does not exist, but try to find it  in the arrogance and the conceit of the two nations. We do not  recognize you as a nation. But this recognition must be made with the  understanding that you drop your conceit.    \"In Bulgaria people think that at this moment we have the support of  Russia. But there is a mistake even in this, as we are further than  you from Russia. If today Russia offers to us her support she is doing  that because we are struggling against Austria and preventing her from  invading the Balkans.    \"To this argument you oppose the treaty of Bucharest. But that treaty  is not our work. By not accepting the Czar's wish in his telegram of  May 5, (18,) 1913, you lost his support. This example from the past  can show you how far you can go when you oppose Russia. But in no case  are you entitled to blame those who are not guilty of your misfortune.    \"When Russia undertakes to do something for the Slavs, she always does  it in a way beneficial to the party to which she promised her support.    \"When this war is over, when the whole of Slavdom shall be freed, when  in a special congress all the interests of the Slavs shall be  discussed and the services rendered by each and every one of them  shall be weighed, Bulgaria must fear that decisions will be taken  which will be contrary to her and that her interests will be  sacrificed.    \"A country must not act always according to her interests. Does not  the Bulgarian people have any obligations toward Russia? Duty always  stands above mere interest.    \"When the war is over an entirely different atmosphere will rule in  the souls of the peoples, and it will then be possible to weigh the  actual interests with more equanimity and more calm. At least we  Servians have this opinion.\"    _The following"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20523"],[0,"Religion and Art in Ancient Greece (#5)"],[1,"of the Greeks, with its intensely personal note. The  reflexion of this tendency in art is not, indeed, to be seen until the  fourth century; not only the power of expression, but the desire to  express such a side of the character of the gods seems to be absent  until this period.    It may seem curious at first sight that art was so slow in this case to  follow the lead given it by poetry; but it is to be remembered that a  power of expression such as would have enabled it to do so was not  attained until the fifth century, and that in this age there was an  exaltation of national and religious enthusiasm, owing mainly to the  victories over the Persians, which checked the tendency to sentiment and  pathos; and it was not until this vigorous reaction had died away that  the tendency once more asserted itself. The early fifth century was also  marked by poets such as Pindar and AEschylus, who raised the religious  ideals of the nation on to a higher plane, who consciously rejected the  less worthy conceptions of the gods, and, whether in accordance with the  popular beliefs or not, gave expression to a higher truth in religion  than had hitherto been dreamed of. The gods whom the sculptors of the  fifth century were called upon to represent may have been the gods of  Homer, but they were the Homeric gods transformed by the creative  imagination of a more reflective age, and purified by a poetic, if not a  philosophic, idealism. But while AEschylus suggests \"a deeply brooding  mind, tinged with mysticism, grappling with dark problems of life and  fate,\"[2] and so was, in some ways, remote from the clarity and  definition of sculptural form, Sophocles \"invests the conceptions of  popular religion with a higher spiritual and intellectual meaning; and  the artistic side of the age is expressed by him in poetry, much as in  architecture and sculpture it is interpreted by the remains of the  Parthenon; there is the same serenity and wholeness of work; power  joined to purity of taste; self-restraint; and a sure instinct of  symmetry.\"[3] Sophocles was a friend and companion of Pericles, and  therefore probably of Phidias; and in both alike we see the same harmony  and absence of exaggeration that are characteristic of Greek art at its  best. In this case we may say with some confidence that the poet and the  sculptor probably influenced each other.    [Footnote 2: Sir R. C. Jebb in _Cambridge Companion to Greek Studies_,  p. 110.]    [Footnote 3: _Ibid_. p. 113.]    It seems a tempting hypothesis to see something of the influence of  \"Euripides the human\" in the individualistic tendencies of the art of  the fourth century; but it seems hardly to be justified by the facts.  The influence of his dramas is, indeed, to be seen in later  vase-paintings; but this is not a matter with which we are here  concerned. In his treatment of the gods, Euripides can hardly be quoted  as an example of the humanising tendency. \"He resented the notion that  gods could be unjust or impure\"; but the purer and more abstract  conceptions of divinity that appealed to him were hardly such as could  find expression in art; it has even been said that \"he blurred those  Hellenic ideals which were the common man's best without definitely  replacing them.\" The bringing of these ideals nearer to the common life  of man finds its poetic inspiration rather in the tendency which has  already been noticed in the Homeric hymns and the lyric poets, and which  now, after the reaction of the fifth century, exerts its full force on  the art of Scopas and Praxiteles.    There is no need to dwell here on the influence of later poets upon  religious art, though we shall have to notice hereafter the parallel  development of the representation of the gods in Hellenistic sculpture.  The Alexandrian poets expressed in elegant language their learning on  matters of religion and mythology, but there was no living belief in the  subjects which they made their theme; and the art they inspired could  only show the same qualities of a correct and academic eclecticism. The  idylls of Theocritus find, indeed, a parallel in the playful treatment  of Satyrs and other subjects of a similar character; but these belong to  what may be called mythological genre rather than to religious art. The  dramatic vigour and intensity which we find in the art of Pergamon  cannot easily be traced to the influence of any similar development in  literature, though its artificial and learned mythology is such as we  find also in the work of Hellenistic poets.    (4) The philosophical aspect of religion had no very great influence  upon art in Greece. We might perhaps expect that, so far as the  philosophers accepted the popular religion, they would tend to purify it  and to give it a higher meaning, just as the more thoughtful of the  poets doubtless assisted the idealising tendency of fifth-century art.  And it might well seem that, for example, Plato's theory of ideas  supplies a more satisfactory basis for an idealist art than any other  system, since it might be maintained that the true artist represents not  the material object which he sees before him, but the ideal prototype of  which it is but a faint and inadequate reflexion. This theory is  peculiarly applicable to statues of the gods, and we find it so applied  by later philosophical and rhetorical writers; for instance, Cicero says  that Phidias \"when he was making the statue of Zeus or of Athena did not  derive his image from some individual, but within his own mind there was  a perfect ideal of beauty; and gazing on this and in contemplation of  it, he guided the craft of his hand after its likeness.\"[4] The same  notion underlies the saying quoted by Strabo, that Phidias was \"either  the only man that saw, or the only man that revealed to others the  images of the gods.\"[5] But there is no trace or encouragement of any  such feeling in the philosophic literature contemporary with the great  age of Greek art. Plato expressly states that the artist only makes \"an  imitation of an imitation\"; and the higher ideas of divinity preached by  philosophers did not so much tend to ennoble the popular conceptions as  to substitute others for them. Above all, the monotheistic idea, even if  associated with the name of Zeus, tended to become an abstract  conception with little relation to the national god of Hellas, whom  Phidias embodied in his Olympian statue.    [Footnote 4: _Or_. 2. 8.]    [Footnote 5: viii. p. 353. It does not matter whether the passage is  quoted by Strabo himself or by an interpolator.]    The philosophic or theological conception of a monotheistic deity does  not, in fact, seem to lend itself at any time to impressive artistic  representation. We may observe the same thing in Christian art, in which  representations of God the Father are not very common nor, as a rule,  very expressive of the most vivid religious ideals; while Christ,  usually not as God, but as man or child, and the Virgin Mary are the  constant themes of the most devout religious art, not to speak of the  numerous saints who correspond more or less to the gods of a  polytheistic system. Philosophical thought was antagonistic to  anthropomorphism, which, as we have seen, was the most characteristic  feature of popular religion in Greece, and which was essential to Greek  religious art. As soon as the human form is a mere symbol, no longer  regarded as the express image of the god and the embodiment of his  individuality, it loses touch with reality. And this reality in the  relation of the god to his image must be believed in by the people, and  at least through the people by the artist, if religious art is to  preserve its vitality.          CHAPTER III    CONDITIONS OF RELIGIOUS ART IN GREECE      The Greeks possessed, as we have seen, to an exceptionally high degree  the vivid anthropomorphic imagination necessary for the expression of  their conception of the gods in their art; we have also noticed the  conditions which encouraged or restricted such representation, and the  influences that affected its nature. Given the desire to represent the  character and individuality of the gods in human form, the next question  we have to consider is how far their art, and especially the art of  sculpture, was capable of giving effect to this desire. The answer lies  mainly in the history of Greek sculpture, which can only be touched on  here in the barest outline. But, at the outset, it is necessary to  remove a misconception which is prevalent at the present day, and more  especially in England, owing partly to the dominating influence of a  great critic. Mr. Ruskin's _Aratra Pentelici_ is full of the most  admirable and suggestive appreciations of Greek sculpture in its more  technical aspects; but side by side with them are found passages such as  the following: \"There is no personal character in true Greek art;  abstract ideas of youth and age, strength and swiftness, virtue and  vice--yes; but there is no individuality.\" Or again: \"The Greek, as  such, never expresses personal character, while a Florentine holds it to  be the ultimate condition of beauty.\" If this criticism were just, it  would follow that any study of the relation of religion to art in Greece  would lose most if not all of its interest. But anyone who is acquainted  with the present state of our knowledge of Greek sculpture will not so  much feel called upon to refute such statements as to explain how so  strange a misconception could have arisen. Nor is the explanation very  far to seek. Mr. Ruskin was writing for a generation not yet penetrated  by the constructive criticism of recent investigation. Its conception of  \"the antique\" in art was based mainly on the mass of mechanical and  academic copies or imitations, of Graeco-Roman date, with which our  museums are filled, and on the influence of such sculpture to be seen in  the work of Flaxman or Thorwaldsen.
