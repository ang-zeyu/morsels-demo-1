A long life gives  one to witness much, and experience much oneself, that one would not  choose. Seventy years I regard as the limit of the life of man. In  these seventy years are contained, without reckoning intercalary  months, twenty-five thousand and two hundred days. Add an intercalary  month to every other year, that the seasons may come round at the  right time, and there will be, besides the seventy years, thirty-five  such months, making an addition of one thousand and fifty days. The  whole number of the days contained in the seventy years will thus be  twenty-six thousand two hundred and fifty, whereof not one but will  produce events unlike the rest. Hence man is wholly accident.    \"For thyself, O Croesus, I see that thou art wonderfully rich, and  art the lord of many nations; but with respect to that whereon thou  questionest me, I have no answer to give, until I hear that thou hast  closed thy life happily. For assuredly he who possesses great store of  riches is no nearer happiness than he who has what suffices for his  daily needs, unless it so hap that luck attend upon him, and so he  continue in the enjoyment of all his good things to the end of life.  For many of the wealthiest men have been unfavored of fortune, and  many whose means were moderate have had excellent luck. Men of the  former class excel those of the latter but in two respects; these last  excel the former in many. The wealthy man is better able to content  his desires, and to bear up against a sudden buffet of calamity. The  other has less ability to withstand these evils (from which, however,  his good luck keeps him clear), but he enjoys all these following  blessings: he is whole of limb, a stranger to disease, free from  misfortune, happy in his children, and comely to look upon.    \"If in addition to all this he ends his life well, he is of a truth  the man of whom thou art in search, the man who may rightly be termed  happy. Call him, however, until he die, not happy but fortunate.  Scarcely indeed can any man unite all these advantages: as there is no  country which contains within it all that it needs, but each while it  possesses some things lacks others, and the best country is that which  contains the most, so no single human being is complete in every  respect--something is always lacking. He who unites the greatest  number of advantages, and retaining them to the day of his death, then  dies peaceably--that man alone, sire, is in my judgment entitled to  bear the name of 'happy.' But in every matter it behooves us to mark  well the end: for oftentimes God gives men a gleam of happiness, and  then plunges them into ruin.\"    Such was the speech which Solon addrest to Croesus, a speech which  brought him neither largess nor honor. The king with much indifference  saw Solon depart, since the former thought that a man must be an  arrant fool who made no account of present good, but bade men always  wait and mark the end.    FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 1: Herodotus, at a certain period in his life, came under  the influence of Pericles and his contemporaries, but it is clear from  his writings that he received from Attic thought and style little  definite inspiration. J. P. Mahaffy has likened him to Goldsmith in  his aloofness from his environment. Often ridiculed by his friends for  simplicity, Goldsmith far exceeded his clever critics in directness  and pathos, and thus gained a place in literature which contemporaries  never dreamed would be his. The narrative of Herodotus, adds Mahaffy,  gives us more information about the state of the ancient nations and  their culture than all other Greek historians put together. His  purpose, as Herodotus himself declares, was to narrate the great  conflict between the Greeks and barbarians, in order that the causes  might be known and glorious deeds might not perish. Readers are  imprest by the perfect ease and mastery with which a great variety of  subjects are dealt with, his story \"advancing with epic grandeur to  its close.\" Mahaffy pronounces Herodotus an Ionic story-writer, who  never became an Attic one--the chief master of Ionic, as Thucydides  was of Attic prose.]    [Footnote 2: From Book I of the \"History.\" Translated by George  Rawlinson.

Assyria contains many large cities; but of these Babylon, to which,  after the destruction of Nineveh, the seat of government was removed,  is by far the most renowned and the most strongly fortified. Babylon  is situated in an extensive plain. Each side of the city, which forms  a square, measures one hundred and twenty stadia (about fourteen  miles), making the entire circuit of the city four hundred and eighty  stadia--such is the magnitude of this city Babylon! and in  magnificence also it surpassed every city of which we have any  knowledge. It is surrounded by a trench, deep, wide, and full of  water. Within this is a wall, the width of which is fifty royal  cubits, and its height two hundred cubits.[6] The royal cubit exceeds  the common measure by three fingers' breadth.    It is proper I should say in what manner the earth removed from the  trench was disposed of, and how the wall was constructed. The earth,  as fast as it was removed from the trench, was converted into bricks  and baked in furnaces: when thus prepared, melted bitumen was used  instead of mortar; and between every thirtieth course of bricks there  was inserted a layer of reeds. The sides of the trench were first  lined with brickwork, and then the wall raised in the manner  described. On the upper edges of the wall, and opposite to one  another, were constructed turrets; between these turrets a space was  left wide enough for a chariot and four horses to pass and turn. In  the walls were one hundred gates, all of brass, with posts and upper  lintels of the same. Eight days' journey from Babylon is a city named  Is, near which runs a small river of the same name, discharging itself  into the Euphrates; this river brings down with its waters clots of  bitumen in large quantities. From this source was derived the bitumen  used in cementing the walls of Babylon.    Such are the fortifications of Babylon. The city is divided into two  portions by the river Euphrates, which runs through the midst of it.  This river rises in Armenia, and throughout its course is wide, deep,  and swift; it empties itself into the Red sea.[7] Each of the city  walls is extended to the river, where it makes an angle, and, with a  coating of burnt bricks, lines the sides of the river. The city is  filled with houses of three or four stories, forming streets in  straight lines, and running parallel with one another, the cross  streets opening upon the river through as many smaller brazen gates,  placed in the breastwork of the river walls. Within the principal wall  just mentioned is a second, not much inferior to the first in  strength, tho less in width.    In the center of each portion of the city is an enclosed space--the  one occupied by the royal palace, a building of vast extent and great  strength; in the other stands the temple of Jupiter Belus, with its  brazen gates, remaining in my time: it is a square structure; each  side measures two stadia. Within the enclosure is erected a solid  tower, measuring a stadium both in width and depth; upon this tower is  raised another, and then another, and another, making eight in all.  The ascent is by a path which is formed on the outside of the towers;  midway in the ascent is a resting-place, furnished with easy chairs,  in which those who ascend repose themselves. On the summit of the  topmost tower stands a large temple; and in this temple is a great  couch, handsomely fitted up; and near it stands a golden table: no  statue whatever is erected in the temple, nor does any man ever pass  the night there; but a woman only, chosen from the people by the god,  as the Chaldeans, who are the priests of the temple affirm. The same  persons say--tho I give no credit to the story--that the god himself  comes to the temple and reposes on the bed, in like manner as at  Thebes in Egypt, where also, in the temple of Jupiter, a woman passes  the night. A similar custom is observed at Pataris, in Lycia, where  there is at times an oracle, on which occasions the priestess is shut  up by night in the temple.    Within the precincts of the temple at Babylon there is a smaller  sacred edifice on the ground, containing an immense golden statue of  Jupiter in a sitting posture: around the statue are large tables,  which, with the steps and throne, are all of gold, and, as the  Chaldeans affirm, contain eight hundred talents of gold. Without this  edifice is a golden altar; there is also another altar of great size,  on which are offered full-grown animals: upon the golden altar it is  not lawful to offer sacrifices except sucklings. Once in every year,  when the festival of this god is celebrated, the Chaldeans burn upon  the greater altar a thousand talents of frankincense. There was also,  not long since, in this sacred enclosure a statue of solid gold,  twelve cubits in height; at least so the Chaldeans affirm: I did not  myself see it. This figure Darius Hystaspes would fain have taken, but  dared not execute his wishes; however, his son Xerxes not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20910"],[0,"South American Fights and Fighters, and Other Tales of Adventure (#5)"],[1,"discovering any signs of the missing vessels.  Coming to an arm  of the sea, supposed to be Chiriqui Lagoon off Costa Rica, in the  course of their journeyings, they decided to cross it in a small boat  rather than make the long detour necessary to get to what they believed  to be the other side.  They were ferried over to the opposite shore in  the boat, and to their dismay discovered that they were upon an almost  desert island.    It was too late and they were too tired, to go farther that night, so  they resolved to pass the night on the {22} island.  In the morning  they were appalled to find that the little boat, with Ribero and the  three sailors, was gone.  They were marooned on a desert island with  practically nothing to eat and nothing but brackish swamp water to  drink.  The sailors they believed to have abandoned them.  They gave  way to transports of despair.  Some in their grief threw themselves  down and died forthwith.  Others sought to prolong life by eating  herbs, roots and the like.    They were reduced to the condition of wild animals, when a sail  whitened the horizon, and presently the two brigantines dropped anchor  near the island.  Ribero was no recreant.  He had been convinced that  Nicuesa was going farther and farther from the ships with every step  that he took, and, unable to persuade him of that fact, he deliberately  took matters into his own hands and retraced his course.  The event  justified his decision, for he soon found the brigantines and the other  ships.  Olano does not seem to have bestirred himself very vigorously  to seek for Nicuesa, perhaps because he hoped to command himself; but  when Ribero made his report he at once made for the island, which he  reached just in time to save the miserable remnant from dying of  starvation.    As soon as he could command himself, Nicuesa, whose easy temper and  generous disposition had left him under the hardships and misfortunes  he had sustained, sentenced Olano to death.  By the pleas of his  comrades, the sentence was mitigated, and the wretched man was bound in  chains and forced to grind corn for the rest of the party--when there  was any to grind.    To follow Nicuesa's career further would be simply to chronicle the  story of increasing disaster.  He lost {23} ship after ship and man  after man.  Finally reduced in number to one hundred men, one of the  sailors, which had been with Columbus remembered the location of Porto  Rico as being a haven where they might establish themselves in a  fertile and beautiful country, well-watered and healthy.  Columbus had  left an anchor under the tree to mark the place, and when they reached  it they found that the anchor had remained undisturbed all the years.  They were attacked by the Indians there, and after losing twenty  killed, were forced to put to sea in two small brigantines and a  caravel, which they had made from the wrecks of their ships.  Coasting  along the shore, they came at last to an open roadstead where they  could debark.    \"In the name of God,\" said the disheartened Nicuesa, \"let us stop here.\"    There they landed, called the place after their leader's exclamation,  Nombre de Dios.  The caravel, with a crew of the strongest, was  despatched for succour, and was never heard of again.    One day, the colonists of Antigua were surprised by the sound of a  cannon shot.  They fired their own weapons in reply, and soon two ships  carrying reenforcements for Nicuesa under Rodrigo de Colmenares,  dropped anchor in front of the town.    By this time the colonists had divided into factions, some favoring the  existing regime, others inclining toward the still busy Encisco, others  desirous of putting themselves under the command of Nicuesa, whose  generosity and sunny disposition were still affectionately remembered.  The arrival of Colmenares and his party, gave the Nicuesa faction a  decided preponderance; and, taking things in their own hands, they  determined to despatch one of the ships, with two {24} representatives  of the colony, up the coast in search of the governor.  This expedition  found Nicuesa without much difficulty.  Again the rescuing ship arrived  just in time.  In a few days more, the miserable body of men, reduced  now to less than sixty, would have perished of starvation.    Nicuesa's spirit had not been chastened by his unparalleled  misfortunes.  He not only accepted the proffered command of the  colony--which was no more than his right, since it was established on  his own territory--but he did more.  When he heard that the colonists  had amassed a great amount of gold by trading and thieving, he harshly  declared that, as they had no legitimate right there, he would take  their portion for himself; that he would stop further enterprises on  their part--in short, he boastfully declared his intention of carrying  things with a high hand in a way well calculated to infuriate his  voluntary subjects.  So arrogant was his bearing and so tactless and  injudicious his talk, that the envoys from Antigua fled in the night  with one of the ships and reported the situation to the colony.  Olano,  still in chains, found means to communicate with his friends in the  other party.  Naturally he painted the probable conduct of the governor  in anything but flattering colors.    All this was most impolitic in Nicuesa.  He seemed to have forgotten  that profound political principle which suggests that a firm seat in  the saddle should be acquired before any attempts should be made to  lead the procession.  The fable of \"King Stork and the Frogs\" was  applicable to the situation of the colonists.    In this contingency they did not know quite what to do.  It was Balboa  who came to their rescue again.  {25} He suggested that, although they  had invited him, they need not permit Nicuesa to land.  Accordingly,  when Nicuesa hove in sight in the other ship, full of determination to  carry things in his own way, they prevented him from coming ashore.    Greatly astonished, he modified his tone somewhat, but to no avail.  It  was finally decided among the colonists to allow him to land in order  to seize his person.  Arrangements were made accordingly, and the  unsuspicious Nicuesa debarked from his ship the day after his arrival.  He was immediately surrounded by a crowd of excited soldiers menacing  and threatening him.  It was impossible for him to make headway against  them.    He turned and fled.  Among his other gubernatorial accomplishments was  a remarkable fleetness of foot.  The poor little governor scampered  over the sands at a great pace.  He distanced his fierce pursuers at  last and escaped to the temporary shelter of the woods.    Balboa, a gentleman by birth and by inclination as well--who had,  according to some accounts, endeavored to compose the differences  between Nicuesa and the colonists--was greatly touched and mortified at  seeing so brave a cavalier reduced to such an undignified and desperate  extremity.  He secretly sought Nicuesa that night and profferred him  his services.  Then he strove valiantly to bring about an adjustment  between the fugitive and the brutal soldiery, but in vain.    Nicuesa, abandoning all his pretensions, at last begged them to receive  him, if not as a governor, at least as a companion-at-arms, a  volunteer.  But nothing, neither the influence of Balboa nor the  entreaties {26} of Nicuesa, could mitigate the anger of the colonists.  They would not have the little governor with them on any terms.  They  would have killed him then and there, but Balboa, by resorting to harsh  measures, even causing one man to be flogged for his insolence, at last  changed that purpose into another--which, to be sure, was scarcely less  hazardous for Nicuesa.    He was to be given a ship and sent away forever from the Isthmus.  Seventeen adherents offered manfully to share his fate.  Protesting  against the legality of the action, appealing to them to give him a  chance for humanity's sake, poor Nicuesa was hurried aboard a small,  crazy bark, the weakest of the wretched brigantines in the harbor.  This was a boat so carelessly constructed that the calking of the seams  had been done with a blunt iron.  With little or no provisions, Nicuesa  and his faithful seventeen were forced to put to sea amid the jeers and  mockery of the men on shore.  The date was March 1, 1511.  According to  the chroniclers, the last words that those left on the island heard  Nicuesa say were, \"Show thy face, O Lord, and we shall be saved.\" [5]    A pathetic and noble departure!    Into the misty deep then vanished poor Nicuesa and his faithful  followers on that bright sunny spring morning.  And none of them ever  came back to tell the tale of what became of them.  Did they die of  starvation in their crazy brigantine, drifting on and on while they  rotted in the blazing sun, until her seams opened and she sank?  Did  they founder in one of the sudden and fierce storms which sometimes  swept {27} that coast?  Did the deadly teredo bore the ship's timbers  full of holes, until she went down with all on board?  Were they cast  on shore to become the prey of Indians whose enmity they had provoked  by their own conduct?  No one ever knew.    It was reported that years afterward on the coast of Veragua some  wandering adventurers found this legend, almost undecipherable, cut in  the bark of a tree, \"_Aqui anduvo el desdichado Diego de Nicuesa_,\"  which may be translated, \"Here was lost the unfortunate Diego de  Nicuesa.\"  But the statement is not credited.  The fate of the gallant  little gentleman is one of the mysteries of the sea.    Of the original eleven hundred men who sailed with the two governors  there remained perhaps thirty of Ojeda's and forty of Nicuesa's at  Antigua with Encisco's command.  This was the net result of the first  two years of effort at the beginning of government in South America on  the Isthmus of Panama, with its ocean on"]]]
