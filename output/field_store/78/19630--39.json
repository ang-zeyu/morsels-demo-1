He refused to pay  taxes for the same reason, and she often saw him put his pocketbook on  the table and then remark drily to the tax collector, \"I shall not  voluntarily pay these taxes. If thee wants to rifle my pocketbook,  thee can do so.\"[16]           *       *       *       *       *    To help her father with his burden of debt was now Susan's purpose in  life, and in the spring she again left the family circle to teach at  Eunice Kenyon's Friends' Seminary in New Rochelle, New York. There  were twenty-eight day pupils and a few boarders at the seminary, and  for long periods while Eunice Kenyon was ill, Susan took full charge.    She wrote her family all the little details of her life, but their  letters never came often enough to satisfy her. Occasionally she  received a paper or a letter from Aaron McLean, Judge McLean's  grandson, who had been her good friend and Guelma's ever since they  had moved to Battenville. His letters almost always started an  argument which both of them continued with zest. After hearing the  Quaker preacher, Rachel Barker, she wrote him, \"I guess if you would  hear her you would believe in a woman's preaching. What an absurd  notion that women have not intellectual and moral faculties sufficient  for anything but domestic concerns.\"[17]    When New Rochelle welcomed President Van Buren with a parade, bands  playing, and crowds in the streets, this prim self-righteous young  woman took no part in this hero worship, but gave vent to her  disapproval in a letter to Aaron.    Disturbed over the treatment Negroes received at Friends' Meeting in  New Rochelle, she impulsively wrote him, \"The people about here are  anti-abolitionist and anti everything else that's good. The Friends  raised quite a fuss about a colored man sitting in the meeting house,  and some left on account of it.... What a lack of Christianity is  this!\"[18]    Her school term of fifteen weeks, for which she was paid $30, was over  early in September, just in time for her to be at home for Guelma's  wedding to Aaron McLean, and afterward she stayed on to teach the  village school in Center Falls. This made it possible for her to join  in the social life of the neighborhood. Often the young people drove  to nearby villages, twenty buggies in procession. On a drive to  Saratoga, her escort asked her to give up teaching to marry him. She  refused, as she did again a few years later when a Quaker elder tried  to entice her with his fine house, his many acres, and his sixty cows.  Although she had reached the age of twenty, when most girls felt they  should be married, she was still particular, and when a friend married  a man far inferior mentally, she wrote in her diary, \"'Tis strange,  'tis passing strange that a girl possessed of common sense should be  willing to marry a lunatic--but so it is.\"[19]    During the next few years, both she and Hannah taught school almost  continuously, for $2 to $2.50 a week. Time and time again Susan  replaced a man who had been discharged for inefficiency. Although she  made a success of the school, she discovered that she was paid only a  fourth the salary he had received, and this rankled.    Almost everywhere except among Quakers, she encountered a false  estimate of women which she instinctively opposed. After spending  several months with relatives in Vermont, where she had the unexpected  opportunity of studying algebra, she stopped over for a visit with  Guelma and Aaron in Battenville, where Aaron was a successful  merchant. Eagerly she told them of her latest accomplishment. Aaron  was not impressed. Later at dinner when she offered him the delicious  cream biscuits which she had baked, he remarked with his most  tantalizing air of male superiority, \"I'd rather see a woman make  biscuits like these than solve the knottiest problem in algebra.\"    \"There is no reason,\" she retorted, \"why she should not be able to do  both.\"[20]      FOOTNOTES:    [1] _Report of the International Council of Women_, 1888 (Washington,  1888), p. 163.

WIDENING HORIZONS      Unable to recoup his business losses in Center Falls and losing even  the satinet factory, Susan's father had looked about in Virginia and  Michigan as well as western New York for an opportunity to make a  fresh start. A farm on the outskirts of Rochester looked promising,  and with the money which Lucy Anthony had inherited from Grandfather  Read and which had been held for her by Uncle Joshua Read, the first  payment had been made on the farm by Uncle Joshua, who held it in his  name and leased it to Daniel.[21] Had it been turned over to Susan's  mother, it would have become Daniel Anthony's property under the law  and could have been claimed by his creditors.    Only Susan, Merritt, and Mary climbed into the stage with their  parents, early in November 1845, on the first lap of their journey to  their new home, near Rochester, New York. Guelma and Hannah[22] were  both married and settled in homes of their own, and young Daniel,  clerking in Lenox, had decided to stay behind.    After a visit with Uncle Joshua at Palatine Bridge, they boarded a  line boat on the Erie Canal, taking with them their gray horse and  wagon; and surrounded by their household goods, they moved slowly  westward. Standing beside her father in the warm November sunshine,  Susan watched the strong horses on the towpath, plodding patiently  ahead, and heard the wash of the water against the prow and the noisy  greeting of boat horns. As they passed the snug friendly villages  along the canal and the wide fertile fields, now brown and bleak after  the harvest, she wondered what the new farm would be like and what the  future would bring; and at night when the lights twinkled in the  settlements along the shore, she thought longingly of her old home and  the sisters she had left behind.    After a journey of several days, they reached Rochester late in the  afternoon. Her father took the horse and wagon off the boat, and in  the chill gray dusk drove them three miles over muddy roads to the  farm. It was dark when they arrived, and the house was cold, empty,  and dismal, but after the fires were lighted and her mother had cooked  a big kettle of cornmeal mush, their spirits revived. Within the next  few days they transformed it into a cheerful comfortable home.    The house on a little hill overlooked their thirty-two acres. Back of  it was the barn, a carriage house, and a little blacksmith shop.[23]  Looking out over the flat snowy fields toward the curving Genesee  River and the church steeples in Rochester, Susan often thought  wistfully of the blue hills around Center Falls and Battenville and of  the good times she had had there.    The winter was lonely for her in spite of the friendliness of their  Quaker neighbors, the De Garmos, and the Quaker families in Rochester  who called at once to welcome them. Her father found these neighbors  very congenial and they readily interested him in the antislavery  movement, now active in western New York. Within the next few months,  several antislavery meetings were held in the Anthony home and opened  a new world to Susan. For the first time she heard of the Underground  Railroad which secretly guided fugitive slaves to Canada and of the  Liberty party which was making a political issue of slavery. She  listened to serious, troubled discussion of the annexation of Texas,  bringing more power to the proslavery block, which even the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20461"],[0,"German Culture Past and Present (#5)"],[1," a governing  Council in which the _Ehrbarkeit_ usually predominated, where they did  not entirely compose it, a Common Council composed of the masters of  the various guilds, and the General Council of the free citizens.  Those journeymen, whose condition was fixed from their being outside  the guild-organizations, usually had guilds of their own. Above the  free cities in the social pyramid stood the Princes of the empire, lay  and ecclesiastic, with the Electoral College, or the seven Electoral  Princes, forming their head. These constituted the feudal \"estates\" of  the empire. Then came the \"King of the Romans\"; and, as the apex of  the whole, the Pope in one function and the Emperor in another,  crowned the edifice. The supremacy, not merely of the Pope but of the  complementary temporal head of the mediaeval polity, the Emperor, was  acknowledged in a shadowy way, even in countries such as France and  England, which had no direct practical connection with the empire.  For, as the spiritual power was also temporal, so the temporal  political power had, like everything else in the Middle Ages, a  quasi-religious significance.    The minds of men in speculative matters, in theology, in philosophy,  and in jurisprudence, were outgrowing the old doctrines, at least in  their old forms. In theology the notion of salvation by the faith of  the individual, and not through the fact of belonging to a corporate  organization, which was the mediaeval conception, was latent in the  minds of multitudes of religious persons before expression was given  to it by Luther. The aversion to scholasticism, bred by the revived  knowledge of the older Greek philosophies in the original, produced a  curious amalgam; but scholastic habits of thought were still dominant  through it all. The new theories of nature amounted to little more  than old superstitions, systematized and reduced to rule, though here  and there the later physical science, based on observation and  experiment, peeped through. In jurisprudence the epoch is marked by  the final conquest of the Roman civil law, in its spirit, where not  in its forms, over the old customs, pre-feudal and feudal.    The subject of Germany during that closing period of the Middle Ages,  characterized by what is known as the revival of learning and the  Reformation, is so important for an understanding of later German  history and the especial characteristics of the German culture of  later times, that we propose, even at the risk of wearying some  readers, to recapitulate in as short a space as possible, compatible  with clearness, the leading conditions of the times--conditions which,  directly or indirectly, have moulded the whole subsequent course of  German development.    Owing to the geographical situation of Germany and to the political  configuration of its peoples and other causes, mediaeval conditions of  life as we find them in the early sixteenth century left more abiding  traces on the German mind and on German culture than was the case with  some other nations. The time was out of joint in a very literal sense  of that somewhat hackneyed phrase. At the opening of the sixteenth  century every established institution--political, social, and  religious--was shaken and showed the rents and fissures caused by time  and by the growth of a new life underneath it. The empire--the Holy  Roman--was in a parlous way as regarded its cohesion. The power of the  princes, the representatives of local centralized authority, was  proving itself too strong for the power of the Emperor, the recognized  representative of centralized authority for the whole German-speaking  world. This meant the undermining and eventual disruption of the  smaller social and political unities,[4] the knightly manors with the  privileges attached to the knightly class generally. The knighthood,  or lower nobility, had acted as a sort of buffer between the princes  of the empire and the Imperial power, to which they often looked for  protection against their immediate overlord or their powerful  neighbour--the prince. The Imperial power, in consequence, found the  lower nobility a bulwark against its princely vassals. Economic  changes, the suddenly increased demand for money owing to the rise of  the \"world-market,\" new inventions in the art of war, new methods of  fighting, the rapidly growing importance of artillery, and the  increase of the mercenary soldier, had rendered the lower nobility,  as an institution, a factor in the political situation which was fast  becoming negligible. The abortive campaign of Franz von Sickingen in  1523 only showed its hopeless weakness. The _Reichsregiment_, or  Imperial governing council, a body instituted by Maximilian, had  lamentably failed to effect anything towards cementing together the  various parts of the unwieldy fabric. Finally, at the Reichstag held  in Nuernberg, in December 1522, at which all the estates were  represented, the _Reichsregiment_, to all intents and purposes,  collapsed.    The Reichstag in question was summoned ostensibly for the purpose of  raising a subsidy for the Hungarians in their struggle against the  advancing power of the Turks. The Turkish movement westward was, of  course, throughout this period, the most important question of what in  modern phraseology would be called \"foreign politics.\" The princes  voted the proposal of the subsidy without consulting the  representatives of the cities, who knew the heaviest part of the  burden was to fall upon themselves. The urgency of the situation,  however, weighed with them, with the result that they submitted after  considerable remonstrance. The princes, in conjunction with their  rivals, the lower nobility, next proceeded to attack the commercial  monopolies, the first fruits of the rising capitalism, the appanage  mainly of the trading companies and the merchant magnates of the  towns. This was too much for civic patience. The city representatives,  who, of course, belonged to the civic aristocracy, waxed indignant.  The feudal orders went on to claim the right to set up vexatious  tariffs in their respective territories, whereby to hinder  artificially the free development of the new commercial capitalist.  This filled up the cup of endurance of the magnates of the city. The  city representatives refused their consent to the Turkish subsidy and  withdrew. The next step was the sending of a deputation to the young  Emperor Karl, who was in Spain, and whose sanction to the decrees of  the Reichstag was necessary before their promulgation. The result of  the conference held on this occasion was a decision to undermine the  _Reichsregiment_ and weaken the power of the princes, by whom and by  whose tools it was manned, as a factor in the Imperial constitution.  As for the princes, while some of their number were positively opposed  to it, others cared little one way or the other. Their chief aim was  to strengthen and consolidate their power within the limits of their  own territories, and a weak empire was perhaps better adapted for  effecting this purpose than a stronger one, even though certain of  their own order had a controlling voice in its administration. As  already hinted, the collapse of the rebellious knighthood under  Sickingen, a few weeks later, clearly showed the political drift of  the situation in the _haute politique_ of the empire.    The rising capitalists of the city, the monopolists, merchant princes,  and syndicates, are the theme of universal invective throughout this  period. To them the rapid and enormous rise in prices during the early  years of the sixteenth century, the scarcity of money consequent on  the increased demand for it, and the impoverishment of large sections  of the population, were attributed by noble and peasant alike. The  whole trend of public opinion, in short, outside the wealthier  burghers of the larger cities--the class immediately interested--was  adverse to the condition of things created by the new world-market,  and by the new class embodying it. At present it was a small class,  the only one that gained by it, and that gained at the expense of all  the other classes.    Some idea of the class-antagonisms of the period may be gathered from  the statement of Ulrich von Hutten about the robber-knights already  spoken of, in his dialogue entitled \"Predones,\" to the effect that  there were four orders of robbers in Germany--the _knights_, the  _lawyers_, the _priests_, and the _merchants_ (meaning especially the  new capitalist merchant-traders or syndicates). Of these, he declares  the robber-knights to be the least harmful. This is naturally only to  be expected from so gallant a champion of his order, the friend and  abettor of Sickingen. Nevertheless, the seriousness of the  robber-knight evil, the toleration of which in principle was so deeply  ingrained in the public opinion of large sections of the population,  may be judged from the abortive attempts made to stop it, at the  instance alike of princes and of cities, who on this point, if on no  other, had a common interest. In 1502, for example, at the Reichstag  held in Gelnhausen in that year, certain of the highest princes of the  empire made a representation that, at least, the knights should permit  the gathering in of the harvest and the vintage in peace. But even  this modest demand was found to be impracticable. The knights had to  live in the style required by their status, as they declared, and  where other means were more and more failing them, their ancient right  or privilege of plunder was indispensable to their order. Still,  Hutten was right so far in declaring the knight the most harmless kind  of robber, inasmuch as, direct as were his methods, his sun was  obviously setting, while as much could not be said of the other  classes named; the merchant and the lawyer were on the rise, and the  priest, although about to receive a check, was not destined speedily"]]]
