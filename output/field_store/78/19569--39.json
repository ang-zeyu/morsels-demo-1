To illustrate this I will shew you a sketch of  one of the bookcases in Hereford Cathedral (fig. 4).    [Illustration: FIG. 4. Bookcase in Hereford Cathedral. (Lent by the  Syndics of the University Press.)]    Having said thus much about chaining, I return to the Merton bookcases.  Cases similar to these were evidently in use in the library of Christ  Church, Canterbury, where the memoranda I mentioned record four  shelves--that is, two on each side--in each bookcase, and also at  Clairvaux, where a similar feature was observed. The design was evidently  much admired, for we find cases on a similar plan, but larger, elsewhere  in Oxford, as at the Colleges of Corpus Christi, S. John's, Trinity,  Jesus, and in the Bodleian Library.      _Bookcase in the Library of Corpus Christi College, Oxford._      Another device for combining desk with shelf is to be seen at Trinity  Hall, Cambridge, and, as these cases were set up after 1626, we have here  a curious instance of a deliberate return to ancient forms. There is  evidence that there once existed below the shelf a second desk, which  could be drawn in and out as required, so that a reader could stand or sit  as he pleased, as you will see from the next illustration.      _Bookcase in the Library of Trinity Hall, Cambridge._      The University of Leiden in Holland adopted a modification of this design,  for there the shelf is above the desk, and readers could only stand to  use the books (fig. 5).    [Illustration: FIG. 5. Bookcases in the library of the University of  Leiden: from a print by J.C. Woudanus, dated 1610. (Lent by the Syndics of  the University Press.)]    An arrangement analogous to this was adopted at Citeaux, as we may gather  from the catalogue, drawn up in 1480. I will not trouble you with  details, but merely say that there was evidently a shelf below the desk as  well as one above it. The cases therefore resembled those at Leiden, with  this difference; and they were also probably of such a height that a  reader could conveniently sit at them.    On the continent, where elaborate bindings came early into fashion,  sometimes protected by equally elaborate bosses at their corners, it would  have been impossible to arrange the volumes as we did side by side on the  shelves. It therefore became the fashion to place a shelf below the desk,  and to lay the books upon it on their sides. The earliest library fitted  in this manner that I have been able to discover is at Cesena in North  Italy. It was built in 1452, by Domenico Malatesta Novello, for the  convent of S. Francesco. It is possible, therefore, that the parent house  of S. Francesco at Assisi, which had a large library, divided, so early as  1381, into a _Libreria publica_ and a _Libreria secreta_, had similar  bookcases. I am going to shew you a general view of the room, which has a  thoroughly medieval character, next the cases (fig. 6), and thirdly a  single book with its chain (fig. 7). You will observe that the seats for  the reader are no longer independent, but are combined with the bookcase.    [Illustration: FIG. 6. Bookcases at west end of south side of Library,  Cesena.]    These cases no doubt suggested those in the Medicean library at Florence,  begun in 1525 by Michael Angelo. The cases, perhaps the finest specimens  in existence of wood-carving as applied to this style of work, were  designed by other artists shortly after the completion of the room.    [Illustration: FIG. 7. Part of a single bookcase in the Library, Cesena.]      _Bookcase in the Medicean Library at Florence._      In English libraries at least bookcases arranged on what I may term the  Oxford type were in general use throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth  centuries. The invention of printing had largely increased the number of  volumes, and at the same time diminished their value, so that chaining was  no longer necessary. When it had been abandoned neither a desk, nor a seat  in close proximity to the books, was required. In consequence, though  libraries continued to be built on the ancient type with numerous windows  close to the floor, it was possible to alter the old cases, or to make new  ones, with a far larger number of shelves than heretofore; and when  further space for books was needed, low cases were interposed between each  pair of tall ones. A splendid specimen of this treatment is to be seen at  S. John's College, Cambridge, where the bookcases were put up soon after  the completion of the library in 1628. Though the plinth and central  pilaster have been taken away, and the levels of the shelves changed,  their original appearance can be recovered at a glance. On the top of all  the low cases there was a desk, in memory of that of ancient times. At the  end of the taller cases is a panel to contain the catalogue, here closed  by a small door.      _Bookcases in S. John's College Library._      Sometimes, as we see at Peterhouse, ancient usage asserted itself so far  that a seat was contrived by making the plinth of the tall case project to  a sufficient distance. These bookcases were set up between 1641 and 1648.      _Bookcase in Peterhouse Library._      When the necessity for still further space for books became imperative,  the seat was given up, or was dropped to the height of a step, as in the  bookcases in the south room of the University Library, Cambridge, put up  soon after 1649. The carved wing, however, which had masked the ends of  it, was retained as an ornament, both there and in the old library at  Pembroke College, Cambridge, furnished soon after 1690.    Meanwhile a new system of arranging bookcases had come into use on the  continent. So far as I have been able to discover, the first library  arranged in the way with which we are familiar, namely, with the bookcases  set against the walls instead of at right angles to them, is that of the  Escurial. These cases were made by Herrera, the architect of the building,  in 1584. There is no indication of chaining, but, in conformity with  ancient usage, the fore edge of the books, instead of their backs, is  turned outwards, and the desk is represented by a shelf, carried all round  the room at a convenient height. No doubt so important a structure as  this, erected by so mighty a potentate as the King of Spain, would be much  talked about, and provoke imitators. Among these, I feel sure, was  Cardinal Mazarin, whose library was fitted up in Paris in or about 1647,  as a library to be used daily by the public. After his death his books and  bookcases were moved to the building in which they may still be seen. I  will now shew you views of the two libraries, and you shall decide whether  it is not obvious that the one was suggested by the other.      _Interior of the Library of the Escurial and of the Bibliotheque Mazarine,  Paris._      The new system was not accepted hastily. I believe that Sir Christopher  Wren, when he built Trinity College Library in 1695, was the first English  architect who ventured to build a library with windows which, as he says  himself, \"rise high, and give place for the deskes against the walls.\" I  suspect that he borrowed this latter idea from France, which he visited in  1665, and most likely from the Bibliotheque Mazarine, for he has himself  recorded his admiration for \"the masculine furniture of the Palais  Mazarin,\" though he does not specially mention the library. But he did  not discard the ancient arrangement altogether. On the contrary he  utilised it so far as to subdivide the room, and provide recesses for the  convenience of students. He says:        The disposition of the shelves both along the walls and      breaking out from the walls must needes prove very convenient      and gracefull, and the best way for the students will be to      have a litle square table in each celle with 2 chaires. The      necessity of bringing windowes and dores to answer to the old      building leaves two squarer places at the endes, and 4 lesser      celles not to study in, but to be shut up with some neat      lattice dores for archives.      _One compartment of Trinity College Library._      I need hardly say that neither this library, nor any of those built by  Wren's pupils or imitators, shew traces of chaining. The old fashion,  however, lingered. In 1651 Humphrey Cheetham directed the books he gave to  certain specified parish-churches near Manchester to be chained; in 1694  James Leaver gave books to the grammar-school at Bolton in Lancashire  which were chained in a cupboard very like the _armarium_ of a monastic  cloister;      _Book-cupboard and desk at Bolton, Lancashire. The former is lettered:  \"The gift of Mr James Leaver, citison of London 1694.\"_      and at All Saints Church, Hereford, a collection of books bequeathed in  1715 was chained to ordinary shelves set against the walls, as may still  be seen. This very obvious way of disposing of books evidently shocked  old-fashioned people, for Cole the antiquary, writing in 1703, could still  speak of the arrangement of shelves against the walls as _a la moderne_.    The libraries I have been describing were more or less public, and I  should like, before I conclude, to shew you how books were bestowed in the  studies of individual scholars--whether royal, monastic, or secular.    I conceive that for many centuries after the beginning of the Christian  era the methods of the ancient world were followed; and that private  libraries were arranged upon the Roman model in presses, with busts,  mottoes, and the like. Such was the library of Isidore, Bishop of Seville  (601-636). He was a voluminous writer, and seems to have had a voluminous  library, divided, if I interpret the arrangements correctly, among  fourteen presses, each ornamented by one or more portrait-busts or  medallions with suitable verses beneath"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19420"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of York (#5)"],[1,"were rife. The people  were ignorant and poor, and the chief posts about the cathedral,  including even the deanery, were held by Italian absentees appointed by  the Pope. The ecclesiastical discipline was naturally very lax. Thoresby  drew up his famous Catechism, which was translated into English verse,  in 1357, and set to work to abolish the abuses caused by pluralism and  immorality among the clergy. The question of precedence was settled by  Innocent VI., who determined that the Archbishop of Canterbury should be  styled Primate of All England, and the Archbishop of York Primate of  England.    \"Thus,\" says the sardonic Fuller, \"when two children cry for the same  apple, the indulgent father divides it betwixt them; yet so that he  giveth the bigger and better part to the child that is his darling.\"    It was also settled that each archbishop should carry his cross erect in  the diocese of the other, but that the Archbishop of York should send a  golden image to the shrine of St. Thomas of Canterbury.    Edward III. had been married in York Minster, and there his little son,  William of Hatfield, was buried. His is the only royal tomb in the  minster.    In 1392 the Court of the King's Bench again sat at York. Richard II.  visited the city several times. The archbishops Neville and Arundel  played a great part in politics at this period. After the deposition of  Richard II. a prebendary, by name Mandelyn, who bore a great resemblance  to the king, personated him and headed a revolt, but he was captured and  put to death. The chapter in general were strongly in favour of Richard,  and three other prebendaries were imprisoned.    In 1405 occurred the rebellion, headed by Scrope, the archbishop. After  he had been trapped and captured, the king had great difficulty in  bringing him to trial, as the Chief Justice, Gascoyne, refused to try  him. He was finally condemned in his own palace, at Bishopthorpe, and  executed near to the walls of the city. Henry IV. withdrew also the  liberties and privileges of the city, and the citizens had to beg for  pardon on their knees with ropes round their necks. The archbishop was  buried in the minster, and his tomb was much frequented by pilgrims in  the north.    In 1407 the rebellion broke out again, and the citizens of York were  again severely punished. In the fifteenth century the importance of York  began to decline, and from that time it owes the position it still holds  chiefly to its ecclesiastical eminence. Richard III. visited York  several times, and gave a great cross to the minster, standing on six  steps, each of which was ornamented with the figure of an angel. The  figures were all of silver, and the whole was decorated with precious  stones. Richard also planned the establishment of a college of 100  chaplains, and in 1485 six altars were erected for their use. But the  scheme came to an end on the death of the king. York had been greatly  devoted to Richard, but it submitted to Henry VII. when he made a state  entry into the city in 1486, and it remained loyal in the rebellion of  Lambert Simnel, when the rebels besieged the city, but were repulsed.    In the reign of Henry VIII. the importance of York was steadily  declining. He only visited the city once. The whole of Yorkshire, which  was no doubt poorer and more ignorant than most other counties, was much  disturbed by the abolition of the monasteries and the spoiling of the  churches, especially by the seizing of the head of St. William, the  chief treasure of the minster. In 1536 the insurrection known as the  Pilgrimage of Grace broke out, and the city willingly received the  rebels. Aske, their leader, made a proclamation that all the \"religions\"  should be reinstated in their old places: and the friars sang matins the  same night. In 1557 Aske was hanged on a gallows set upon one of the  bars of York. Henry entered York, and the citizens sued for pardon,  which was not granted to them until 1560. Henry ordered the removal of  such shrines as had not already been destroyed, and fragments of these  have been found buried near the minster. Henry determined to establish  his authority firmly in the north, and established the famous council  which appointed the Duke of Norfolk their president. The council was  held in the house of the Abbot of St. Mary's. It took away most of the  powers of the Mayor and Corporation, but gave renewed importance to the  city.    The diocese was much neglected during the episcopacy of Wolsey and his  successor Lee. Both were statesmen rather than ecclesiastics. Indeed, it  is said that Wolsey never set foot in York itself, though he was  arrested at Cawood, where was one of the bishop's palaces. Lee was  employed continually on missions and embassies. He happened to be in  York, however, at the time of the Pilgrimage of Grace, and was seized by  the rebels, carried to Pontefract, and compelled to swear support to the  rebellion. The see was much impoverished in the time of Holgate, Lee's  successor (1545-1554), who supported Henry in his quarrel with the Pope.    Much of the property taken by Henry was restored by Mary to Heath, the  next archbishop, who was the last appointed by a papal bull with the  acknowledgment of the Government. Heath was deposed by Elizabeth in  1559.    In 1569 occurred another rising in the north in favour of the old  religion and of Mary Queen of Scots, under the Earls of Northumberland  and Westmoreland.    In Richmondshire and the Cleveland district the new prayer-books were  destroyed, and the old service restored. York itself favoured the  rebels, but before it could be entered a force arrived from the south  and the rebellion sank to nothing. The queen's army exacted a loan of  L500 from the citizens of York. Eleven persons also in the city were  sentenced to death. The Earl of Northumberland also was afterwards  executed and buried in York. After the rebellion the Roman Catholics in  the diocese were much persecuted. They were forced to attend the  reformed services and the Holy Communion, and their priests were hunted  down. Attempts also were made to abolish the Christmas mummeries and the  miracle plays. The archbishop of this period, Thomas Young, is accused  of plundering the estates of the church in the interests of his own  family.    Charles I. had a great affection for the city and minster of York, and  enriched the latter with many gifts. For instance, he gave L1000 to the  chapter for the building of a new organ, and out of the same the chapter  also bought some Communion plate, and a Bible and prayer-book richly  bound in purple velvet and ornamented with silver-gilt plates. These  latter are still preserved. He further removed certain houses and  offices which had been built close to the west and south doors. He also  destroyed a building which had been erected inside one of the transepts,  and ordered certain seats in the choir, which hid the stalls and  woodwork, to be taken away.    Charles also wrote to the Corporation in 1639, ordering them not to  bring the official sword and mace into the minster, and to receive the  Holy Communion there on certain fixed occasions. The Mayor and  Corporation evaded the order by entering the church with sword and mace  \"abased.\" They have never yet officially attended Holy Communion. They  also had a quarrel with the dean and corporation owing to their practice  of using the north aisle of the nave, known as the Lord Mayor's Walk, as  a common promenade. The dean and chapter endeavoured to put a stop to  this in 1632, but it continued until the end of the century.    [Illustration: Walmgate Bar.]    During the Civil War York suffered less than many cathedral cities. In  1644 it was besieged by the Parliamentary troops and the Scots under  Fairfax and Leslie. During the siege the minster seems to have been  spared as far as possible, mainly, perhaps, through the influence of  Fairfax, but it did not escape entirely scatheless. Thomas Mace, the  author of \"Musick's Monument,\" was in the city during the siege, and he  thus describes the way in which the minster suffered:--\"The enemy was  very near and fierce upon them, especially on that side the city where  the church stood; and had planted their great guns mischievously against  the church; with which constantly in prayer's time, they would not fail  to make their hellish disturbance by shooting against and battering the  church; insomuch that sometimes a cannon bullet has come in at the  windows and bounced about from pillar to pillar (even like some furious  fiend or evil spirit) backwards and forwards and all manner of sideways,  as it has happened to meet with square or round opposition amongst the  pillars.\"    [Illustration: Micklegate Bar.]    During the siege the citizens suffered much from the presence of the  soldiery who were billeted upon them. Each citizen, in addition to  giving free quarters to as many soldiers as possible, had to pay L2 a  month for their support. The siege lasted for six weeks, and in the  course of it the Marygate Tower, which was used as a record office for  the whole of the north, was attacked and spoiled, all the records in it,  an irreparable loss, being destroyed. The city was captured soon after  Marston Moor, and the defenders obtained very good terms, marching out  with all the honours of war. The citizens also were well treated. They  were to enjoy all their old privileges and were to be preserved from  plundering. All churches and public buildings were to be treated with  respect. A Presbyterian service was at once held in the minster by the  conquerors. The Corporation presented to Fairfax a butt of sack and a  tun of French wine in gratitude for the good offices he had rendered  them. There can be little doubt that the great amount of stained glass  still remaining in the minster is owing to the control he exercised over  the Parliamentarians. On October the 24th of the same"]]]
