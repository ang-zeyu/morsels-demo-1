Then he remembered that he could try on each suit of feathers once. So  he began to put them on.    The feathers of the first suit were too long. They trailed on the ground  as he walked. Neither could he fly well in them. Turkey Buzzard laid  that suit aside.    The next suit shone like gold. The feathers were a beautiful yellow.  Turkey Buzzard put it on and strutted up and down the forest.    \"Oh, how handsome I am!\" he said. \"But I must not keep this, for if I  did, I should shine so like the face of the Great Spirit, that all the  other birds would see me.\"    And he slipped off the suit of yellow feathers as quickly as possible.    A third suit was of pure white feathers. Turkey Buzzard thought it  looked very beautiful. It was a perfect fit.    \"But it will get dirty too soon,\" he said. \"I will not choose this.\"    And this, too, was laid aside.    There were not enough feathers in the fourth suit. Turkey Buzzard  shivered with cold. It was not warm enough. He would not have it.    There were too many feathers, and too many pieces, in the fifth suit. It  took too much time to put it on. Turkey Buzzard did not want that.    So he went from one suit to another, trying on and taking off. Always he  had some new fault to find. Something was wrong with each one. Nothing  quite pleased him. No suit was just right.    At last there was but one suit left. It was not pretty. It was a plain,  dull color,--and very short of feathers at the neck and head. Turkey  Buzzard put it on. He did not like it. It did not fit him well: it was  cut too low in the neck. Turkey Buzzard thought it was the homeliest  suit of all. But it was the last suit, so he kept it on.    Then _Gah gah go wah_, the Turkey Buzzard, gathered up the suits and  flew back to the bird lodge. He still wore the plain, dull-colored suit.    The birds again called a council. Each was told to select a suit from  those that _Gah gah go wah_ had brought, and put it on. This they did.    Then the birds in their beautiful feathered suits began to walk and fly  about the Turkey Buzzard, and to make fun of his plain, dull dress.    But _Gah gah go wah_ held his head high. He walked proudly about among  the birds. He looked with scorn on their beautiful suits. After a time  he spoke.    He said, \"_Gah gah go wah_, the Turkey Buzzard, does not want your  suits. He had the pick of them all. He likes his own suit best.\"         Adapted from Erminie Smith's _Myths of the Iroquois_.    [Illustration]          WHY THE PARTRIDGE DRUMS      [Illustration]    It was after the Great Spirit had made all the beautiful birds, that the  Evil Spirit came along. He saw the beautiful birds and heard their  beautiful songs. He saw that the earth people liked the birds and liked  to hear them sing.    Now the Evil Spirit did not wish people to be happy, so he said, \"I will  make a bird that will make people afraid. I will make a big bird that  will not sing, but will make a great noise.\"    So the Evil Spirit went to work. In a short time he had made a big bird,  that could not sing, but could drum.    The big bird flew away into the wood. That night a drumming noise was  heard in the wood. The people were afraid. They could not sleep, because  of the noise.    In the morning, they went into the woods to search for the noise. Deep  in the forest could still be heard that strange drumming. They followed  it, until they came to a deep, dark place in the woods. There was a loud  fluttering and whirring of wings, and a great bird flew out from among  them, along the ground and over the trees.    The people were afraid. They called to the Great Spirit to help them.    The Great Spirit was near. He heard their cry, and went after the bird,  for he was very angry.    The Great Spirit said, \"I will not have my people frightened by this  great bird; it shall die.\"    The big bird gave the Great Spirit a long chase. At last the Great  Spirit came upon it. He seized it, and threw it against a large tree.    As the big bird struck the tree, drops of blood flew in all directions.  They changed into smaller birds that went whirring into the woods, just  as the big bird had done. There they began to drum.    Like the big bird, these smaller birds like to startle people. They  flutter out from under the leaves, and with a whirring noise they fly  far into the wood. There they perch on an old log, or a rock, and drum  with their wings.    Some of the earth people say they are drumming for their mates. But  others still think that the birds drum to make people afraid.    So this is how the Indians say the partridges came to be. This is why  they drum, and why some of the earth children still love to hunt  partridges.          HOW THE INDIANS LEARNED TO HEAL      A long, long time ago, some Indians were running along a trail that led  to an Indian settlement. As they ran, a rabbit jumped from the bushes  and sat before them.    [Illustration: MEDICINE RATTLE]    The Indians stopped, for the rabbit still sat up before them and did not  move from the trail. They shot their arrows at him, but the arrows came  back unstained with blood.    A second time they drew their arrows. Now no rabbit was to be seen.  Instead, an old man stood on the trail. He seemed to be weak and sick.    [Illustration]    The old man asked them for food and a place to rest. They would not  listen but went on to the settlement.    Slowly the old man followed them, down the trail to the wigwam village.  In front of each wigwam, he saw a skin placed on a pole. This he knew  was the sign of the clan to which the dwellers in that wigwam belonged.    First he stopped at a wigwam where a wolf skin hung. He asked to enter,  but they would not let him. They said, \"We want no sick men here.\"    On he went toward another wigwam. Here a turtle's shell was hanging. But  this family would not let him in.    He tried a wigwam where he saw a beaver skin. He was told to move on.    [Illustration]    The Indians who lived in a wigwam where a deer skin was seen, were just  as unkind. Nor was he permitted to enter wigwams where hung hawk, snipe,  and heron skins.    At last he came to a wigwam where a bear skin hung.    \"I will ask once more for a place to rest,\" he thought.    And here a kind old woman lived. She brought food for him to eat, and  spread soft skins for him to lie upon.    The old man thanked her. He said that he was very sick. He told the  woman what plants to gather in the wood, to make him well again.    This she did, and soon he was healed.    A few days later the old man was again taken sick. Again he told the  woman what roots and leaves to gather. She did as she was told, and  soon he was well.    [Illustration]    Many times the old man fell sick. Each time he had a different sickness.  Each time he told the woman what plants and herbs to find to cure him.  Each time she remembered what she had been told.    Soon this woman of the Bear clan knew more about healing than all the  other people.    One day, the old man told her that the Great Spirit had sent him to  earth, to teach the Indian people the secrets of healing.    \"I came, sick and hungry, to many a wigwam door. No blanket was drawn  aside for me to pass in. You alone lifted the blanket from your wigwam  door and bade me enter.    \"You are of the Bear clan, therefore all other clans shall come to the  Bear clan for help in sickness.    \"You shall teach all the clans what plants, and roots, and leaves to  gather, that the sick may be healed.    \"And the Bear shall be the greatest and strongest of the clans.\"    The Indian woman lifted her face to the Great Spirit to thank him for  this great gift and knowledge of healing. When she turned again to the  man, he had disappeared.    No one was there, but a rabbit was running swiftly down the trail.    [Illustration: MEDICINE MASK]    [Illustration]          WHY DOGS CHASE FOXES      A fox was running through the wood near a river. He had a fish in his  mouth.    The fish had been stolen from an Indian who lived down the stream. The  fox had been passing near the Indian's wigwam. He saw the fish hanging  by the fire. It was cleaned and ready to cook.    \"What a tasty breakfast!\" thought the fox. \"I think I will watch the man  eat.\"    Soon the Indian went into the wigwam. The fox slipped up to the fire. He  seized the fish, and ran away with it.    When the Indian came back, he had no breakfast. The fish was gone. No  fox was to be seen.    The fox ran along, feeling much pleased with himself.    \"What a cunning fox I am,\" he chuckled. \"I will play another foxy trick.  This time it shall be on the bear I see coming.\"    He ran up a tree that had been bent half way to earth by the West Wind.  There he began to eat his fish. He smacked his lips so loudly that the  bear heard him.    The bear stopped under the tree, and asked, \"What are you eating that  tastes so good?\"    For answer the fox threw down a bit of the fish. The bear smacked his  lips and cried, \"More! More!\"    \"Go to the river, swim out to the big log, and catch your own fish,\"  called the fox. \"It's very easy! Just drop your tail into the water.  Hold it there till a fish comes along and bites, then pull it up. That  is the way I catch my fish. You can catch all the fish you want with  your own tail.\"    The bear hurried on to the river. He swam to the log and dropped his  tail into the water, as the fox had advised.    All day he sat and fished with his tail,--for bears then had very long  tails.    The sun set, but no fish had pulled his tail. All night the bear sat on  the log and fished. Cold North Wind blew his breath over the water. The  river grew still and white.    Towards morning, the bear felt that his tail was getting very heavy. Now  at last he was sure he had a fish. He tried to pull it up. But alas! his  tail was frozen fast in the ice.    Then the fox came along.

There were the chemical corner and the acid-stained,  deal-topped table. There upon a shelf was the row of formidable  scrap-books and books of reference which many of our fellow-citizens  would have been so glad to burn. The diagrams, the violin-case, and the  pipe-rack--even the Persian slipper which contained the tobacco--all met  my eyes as I glanced round me. There were two occupants of the room--one  Mrs. Hudson, who beamed upon us both as we entered; the other the  strange dummy which had played so important a part in the evening's  adventures. It was a wax-coloured model of my friend, so admirably done  that it was a perfect facsimile. It stood on a small pedestal table with  an old dressing-gown of Holmes's so draped round it that the illusion  from the street was absolutely perfect.    \"I hope you preserved all precautions, Mrs. Hudson?\" said Holmes.    \"I went to it on my knees, sir, just as you told me.\"    \"Excellent. You carried the thing out very well. Did you observe where  the bullet went?\"    \"Yes, sir. I'm afraid it has spoilt your beautiful bust, for it passed  right through the head and flattened itself on the wall. I picked it up  from the carpet. Here it is!\"    Holmes held it out to me. \"A soft revolver bullet, as you perceive,  Watson. There's genius in that, for who would expect to find such a  thing fired from an air-gun. All right, Mrs. Hudson, I am much obliged  for your assistance. And now, Watson, let me see you in your old seat  once more, for there are several points which I should like to discuss  with you.\"    He had thrown off the seedy frock-coat, and now he was the Holmes of old  in the mouse-coloured dressing-gown which he took from his effigy.    \"The old shikari's nerves have not lost their steadiness nor his eyes  their keenness,\" said he, with a laugh, as he inspected the shattered  forehead of his bust.    \"Plumb in the middle of the back of the head and smack through the  brain. He was the best shot in India, and I expect that there are few  better in London. Have you heard the name?\"    \"No, I have not.\"    \"Well, well, such is fame! But, then, if I remember aright, you had not  heard the name of Professor James Moriarty, who had one of the great  brains of the century. Just give me down my index of biographies from  the shelf.\"    He turned over the pages lazily, leaning back in his chair and blowing  great clouds from his cigar.    \"My collection of M's is a fine one,\" said he. \"Moriarty himself is  enough to make any letter illustrious, and here is Morgan the poisoner,  and Merridew of abominable memory, and Mathews, who knocked out my left  canine in the waiting-room at Charing Cross, and, finally, here is our  friend of to-night.\"    He handed over the book, and I read: \"MORAN, SEBASTIAN, COLONEL.  Unemployed. Formerly 1st Bengalore Pioneers. Born London, 1840. Son of  Sir Augustus Moran, C.B., once British Minister to Persia. Educated  Eton and Oxford. Served in Jowaki Campaign, Afghan Campaign, Charasiab  (despatches), Sherpur, and Cabul. Author of 'Heavy Game of the Western  Himalayas,' 1881; 'Three Months in the Jungle,' 1884. Address: Conduit  Street. Clubs: The Anglo-Indian, the Tankerville, the Bagatelle Card  Club.\"    On the margin was written, in Holmes's precise hand: \"The second most  dangerous man in London.\"    \"This is astonishing,\" said I, as I handed back the volume. \"The man's  career is that of an honourable soldier.\"    \"It is true,\" Holmes answered. \"Up to a certain point he did well. He  was always a man of iron nerve, and the story is still told in India how  he crawled down a drain after a wounded man-eating tiger. There are some  trees, Watson, which grow to a certain height and then suddenly develop  some unsightly eccentricity. You will see it often in humans. I have  a theory that the individual represents in his development the whole  procession of his ancestors, and that such a sudden turn to good or  evil stands for some strong influence which came into the line of his  pedigree. The person becomes, as it were, the epitome of the history of  his own family.\"    \"It is surely rather fanciful.\"    \"Well, I don't insist upon it. Whatever the cause, Colonel Moran began  to go wrong. Without any open scandal, he still made India too hot to  hold him. He retired, came to London, and again acquired an evil name.  It was at this time that he was sought out by Professor Moriarty,  to whom for a time he was chief of the staff. Moriarty supplied him  liberally with money and used him only in one or two very high-class  jobs which no ordinary criminal could have undertaken. You may have  some recollection of the death of Mrs. Stewart, of Lauder, in 1887.  Not? Well, I am sure Moran was at the bottom of it; but nothing could  be proved. So cleverly was the Colonel concealed that even when the  Moriarty gang was broken up we could not incriminate him. You remember  at that date, when I called upon you in your rooms, how I put up the  shutters for fear of air-guns? No doubt you thought me fanciful. I knew  exactly what I was doing, for I knew of the existence of this remarkable  gun, and I knew also that one of the best shots in the world would be  behind it. When we were in Switzerland he followed us with Moriarty,  and it was undoubtedly he who gave me that evil five minutes on the  Reichenbach ledge.    \"You may think that I read the papers with some attention during my  sojourn in France, on the look-out for any chance of laying him by the  heels. So long as he was free in London my life would really not have  been worth living. Night and day the shadow would have been over me, and  sooner or later his chance must have come. What could I do? I could not  shoot him at sight, or I should myself be in the dock. There was no use  appealing to a magistrate. They cannot interfere on the strength of what  would appear to them to be a wild suspicion. So I could do nothing. But  I watched the criminal news, knowing that sooner or later I should get  him. Then came the death of this Ronald Adair. My chance had come at  last! Knowing what I did, was it not certain that Colonel Moran had done  it? He had played cards with the lad; he had followed him home from the  club; he had shot him through the open window. There was not a doubt of  it. The bullets alone are enough to put his head in a noose. I came  over at once. I was seen by the sentinel, who would, I knew, direct  the Colonel's attention to my presence. He could not fail to connect my  sudden return with his crime and to be terribly alarmed. I was sure that  he would make an attempt to get me out of the way AT ONCE, and would  bring round his murderous weapon for that purpose. I left him an  excellent mark in the window, and, having warned the police that they  might be needed--by the way, Watson, you spotted their presence in that  doorway with unerring accuracy--I took up what seemed to me to be a  judicious post for observation, never dreaming that he would choose the  same spot for his attack. Now, my dear Watson, does anything remain for  me to explain?\"    \"Yes,\" said I. \"You have not made it clear what was Colonel Moran's  motive in murdering the Honourable Ronald Adair.\"    \"Ah! my dear Watson, there we come into those realms of conjecture where  the most logical mind may be at fault. Each may form his own hypothesis  upon the present evidence, and yours is as likely to be correct as  mine.\"    \"You have formed one, then?\"    \"I think that it is not difficult to explain the facts. It came out  in evidence that Colonel Moran and young Adair had between them won a  considerable amount of money. Now, Moran undoubtedly played foul--of  that I have long been aware. I believe that on the day of the murder  Adair had discovered that Moran was cheating. Very likely he had spoken  to him privately, and had threatened to expose him unless he voluntarily  resigned his membership of the club and promised not to play cards  again. It is unlikely that a youngster like Adair would at once make a  hideous scandal by exposing a well-known man so much older than himself.  Probably he acted as I suggest. The exclusion from his clubs would mean  ruin to Moran, who lived by his ill-gotten card gains. He therefore  murdered Adair, who at the time was endeavouring to work out how  much money he should himself return, since he could not profit by his  partner's foul play. He locked the door lest the ladies should surprise  him and insist upon knowing what he was doing with these names and  coins. Will it pass?\"    \"I have no doubt that you have hit upon the truth.\"    \"It will be verified or disproved at the trial. Meanwhile, come what  may, Colonel Moran will trouble us no more, the famous air-gun of Von  Herder will embellish the Scotland Yard Museum, and once again  Mr. Sherlock Holmes is free to devote his life to examining those  interesting little problems which the complex life of London so  plentifully presents.\"      *****                           THE STRAND MAGAZINE                     Vol. 26  NOVEMBER, 1903                  THE RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES.
