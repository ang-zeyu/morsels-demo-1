Or, The Voyages and Adventures of Sir Amyas Leigh, Knight, of (#5)"],[1,"on the Spanish Main.\"    \"O my boy, my boy!\" said Mrs. Leigh, \"hear what the good Sir Richard  promises you. Many an earl's son would be glad to be in your place.\"    \"And many an earl's son will be glad to be in his place a score years  hence, if he will but learn what I know you two can teach him. And now,  Amyas, my lad, I will tell you for a warning the history of that Sir  Thomas Stukely of whom I spoke just now, and who was, as all men know,  a gallant and courtly knight, of an ancient and worshipful family in  Ilfracombe, well practised in the wars, and well beloved at first by our  incomparable queen, the friend of all true virtue, as I trust she will  be of yours some day; who wanted but one step to greatness, and that  was this, that in his hurry to rule all the world, he forgot to rule  himself. At first, he wasted his estate in show and luxury, always  intending to be famous, and destroying his own fame all the while by  his vainglory and haste. Then, to retrieve his losses, he hit upon the  peopling of Florida, which thou and I will see done some day, by God's  blessing; for I and some good friends of mine have an errand there as  well as he. But he did not go about it as a loyal man, to advance the  honor of his queen, but his own honor only, dreaming that he too should  be a king; and was not ashamed to tell her majesty that he had rather be  sovereign of a molehill than the highest subject of an emperor.\"    \"They say,\" said Mr. Leigh, \"that he told her plainly he should be a  prince before he died, and that she gave him one of her pretty quips in  return.\"    \"I don't know that her majesty had the best of it. A fool is many times  too strong for a wise man, by virtue of his thick hide. For when she  said that she hoped she should hear from him in his new principality,  'Yes, sooth,' says he, graciously enough. 'And in what style?' asks she.  'To our dear sister,' says Stukely: to which her clemency had nothing to  reply, but turned away, as Mr. Burleigh told me, laughing.\"    \"Alas for him!\" said gentle Mrs. Leigh. \"Such self-conceit--and Heaven  knows we have the root of it in ourselves also--is the very daughter of  self-will, and of that loud crying out about I, and me, and mine, which  is the very bird-call for all devils, and the broad road which leads to  death.\"    \"It will lead him to his,\" said Sir Richard; \"God grant it be not upon  Tower-hill! for since that Florida plot, and after that his hopes of  Irish preferment came to naught, he who could not help himself by fair  means has taken to foul ones, and gone over to Italy to the Pope, whose  infallibility has not been proof against Stukely's wit; for he was soon  his Holiness's closet counsellor, and, they say, his bosom friend; and  made him give credit to his boasts that, with three thousand soldiers he  would beat the English out of Ireland, and make the Pope's son king of  it.\"    \"Ay, but,\" said Mr. Leigh, \"I suppose the Italians have the same fetch  now as they had when I was there, to explain such ugly cases; namely,  that the Pope is infallible only in doctrine, and quoad Pope; while  quoad hominem, he is even as others, or indeed, in general, a deal  worse, so that the office, and not the man, may be glorified thereby.  But where is Stukely now?\"    \"At Rome when last I heard of him, ruffling it up and down the Vatican  as Baron Ross, Viscount Murrough, Earl Wexford, Marquis Leinster, and  a title or two more, which have cost the Pope little, seeing that  they never were his to give; and plotting, they say, some hare-brained  expedition against Ireland by the help of the Spanish king, which must  end in nothing but his shame and ruin. And now, my sweet hosts, I must  call for serving-boy and lantern, and home to my bed in Bideford.\"    And so Amyas Leigh went back to school, and Mr. Oxenham went his way to  Plymouth again, and sailed for the Spanish Main.        CHAPTER II    HOW AMYAS CAME HOME THE FIRST TIME         \"Si taceant homines, facient te sidera notum,           Sol nescit comitis immemor esse sui.\"                                 Old Epigram on Drake.    Five years are past and gone. It is nine of the clock on a still, bright  November morning; but the bells of Bideford church are still ringing for  the daily service two hours after the usual time; and instead of going  soberly according to wont, cannot help breaking forth every five minutes  into a jocund peal, and tumbling head over heels in ecstasies of joy.  Bideford streets are a very flower-garden of all the colors, swarming  with seamen and burghers, and burghers' wives and daughters, all  in their holiday attire. Garlands are hung across the streets, and  tapestries from every window. The ships in the pool are dressed in all  their flags, and give tumultuous vent to their feelings by peals of  ordnance of every size. Every stable is crammed with horses; and  Sir Richard Grenville's house is like a very tavern, with eating  and drinking, and unsaddling, and running to and fro of grooms and  serving-men. Along the little churchyard, packed full with women,  streams all the gentle blood of North Devon,--tall and stately men, and  fair ladies, worthy of the days when the gentry of England were by due  right the leaders of the people, by personal prowess and beauty, as well  as by intellect and education. And first, there is my lady Countess of  Bath, whom Sir Richard Grenville is escorting, cap in hand (for her good  Earl Bourchier is in London with the queen); and there are Bassets  from beautiful Umberleigh, and Carys from more beautiful Clovelly, and  Fortescues of Wear, and Fortescues of Buckland, and Fortescues from all  quarters, and Coles from Slade, and Stukelys from Affton, and St. Legers  from Annery, and Coffins from Portledge, and even Coplestones from  Eggesford, thirty miles away: and last, but not least (for almost all  stop to give them place), Sir John Chichester of Ralegh, followed  in single file, after the good old patriarchal fashion, by his eight  daughters, and three of his five famous sons (one, to avenge his  murdered brother, is fighting valiantly in Ireland, hereafter to rule  there wisely also, as Lord Deputy and Baron of Belfast); and he meets  at the gate his cousin of Arlington, and behind him a train of four  daughters and nineteen sons, the last of whom has not yet passed the  town-hall, while the first is at the Lychgate, who, laughing, make way  for the elder though shorter branch of that most fruitful tree; and so  on into the church, where all are placed according to their degrees, or  at least as near as may be, not without a few sour looks, and shovings,  and whisperings, from one high-born matron and another; till the  churchwardens and sidesmen, who never had before so goodly a company to  arrange, have bustled themselves hot, and red, and frantic, and end by  imploring abjectly the help of the great Sir Richard himself to tell  them who everybody is, and which is the elder branch, and which is the  younger, and who carries eight quarterings in their arms, and who only  four, and so prevent their setting at deadly feud half the fine  ladies of North Devon; for the old men are all safe packed away in the  corporation pews, and the young ones care only to get a place whence  they may eye the ladies. And at last there is a silence, and a looking  toward the door, and then distant music, flutes and hautboys, drums and  trumpets, which come braying, and screaming, and thundering merrily  up to the very church doors, and then cease; and the churchwardens  and sidesmen bustle down to the entrance, rods in hand, and there is a  general whisper and rustle, not without glad tears and blessings from  many a woman, and from some men also, as the wonder of the day enters,  and the rector begins, not the morning service, but the good old  thanksgiving after a victory at sea.    And what is it which has thus sent old Bideford wild with that \"goodly  joy and pious mirth,\" of which we now only retain traditions in  our translation of the Psalms? Why are all eyes fixed, with greedy  admiration, on those four weather-beaten mariners, decked out with knots  and ribbons by loving hands; and yet more on that gigantic figure who  walks before them, a beardless boy, and yet with the frame and stature  of a Hercules, towering, like Saul of old, a head and shoulders above  all the congregation, with his golden locks flowing down over his  shoulders? And why, as the five go instinctively up to the altar, and  there fall on their knees before the rails, are all eyes turned to the  pew where Mrs. Leigh of Burrough has hid her face between her hands,  and her hood rustles and shakes to her joyful sobs? Because there was  fellow-feeling of old in merry England, in county and in town; and  these are Devon men, and men of Bideford, whose names are Amyas Leigh of  Burrough, John Staveley, Michael Heard, and Jonas Marshall of Bideford,  and Thomas Braund of Clovelly: and they, the first of all English  mariners, have sailed round the world with Francis Drake, and are come  hither to give God thanks.    It is a long story. To explain how it happened we must go back for a  page or two, almost to the point from whence we started in the last  chapter.    For somewhat more than a twelvemonth after Mr. Oxenham's departure,  young Amyas had gone on quietly enough, according to promise, with the  exception of certain occasional outbursts of fierceness common to all  young male animals, and especially to boys of any strength of character.  His scholarship, indeed, progressed no better than before; but his home  education went on healthily enough; and he was fast becoming, young as  he was, a right good archer, and rider, and swordsman (after the old  school of buckler practice), when his father, having gone down on  business to the Exeter Assizes, caught (as was too common in those days)  the gaol-fever from the prisoners; sickened in the very court;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18613"],[0,"The Golden Scorpion (#5)"],[1,"irl's slim fingers  convulsively clutched the table edge as she confronted him. Her  exquisite colour fled and left her pallid, dark-eyed and dismayed.    \"So,\" he said bitterly--\"I returned none too soon, Mlle.--_Dorian_\"    \"Oh! she whispered, and shrank from him as he approached nearer.    \"Your object in selecting an obscure practitioner for your medical  adviser becomes painfully evident to me. Diagnosis of your case would  have been much more easy if I had associated your symptoms with the  presence in my table drawer of\"--he hesitated--\"of something which  you have taken out. Give me whatever you have stolen and compose  yourself to await the arrival of the police.\"    He was cruel in his disillusionment. Here lay the explanation of his  romance; here was his disguised princess--a common thief! She stared  at him wildly.    \"I take nothing!\" she cried. \"Oh, let me go! Please, please let me go!\"    \"Pleading is useless. What have you stolen?\"    \"Nothing--see.\" She cast the little gold ornament on the table. \"I  look at this, but I do not mean to steal it.\"    She raised her beautiful eyes to his face again, and he found himself  wavering. That she had made his acquaintance in order to steal the  fragment of the golden scorpion was impossible, for he had not  possessed it at the time of her first visit. He was hopelessly  mystified and utterly miserable.    \"How did you open the drawer?\" he asked sternly.    She took up the bunch of keys which lay upon the table and naively  exhibited that which fitted the lock of the drawer. Her hands were  shaking.    \"Where did you obtain this key; and why?\"    She watched him intently, her lips trembling and her eyes wells of  sorrow into which he could not gaze unmoved.    \"If I tell you--will you let me go?\"    \"I shall make no promises, for I can believe nothing that you may  tell me. You gained my confidence by a lie--and now, by another lie,  you seem to think that you can induce me to overlook a deliberate  attempt at burglary--common burglary.\" He clenched his hands.  \"Heavens! I could never have believed it of you!\"    She flinched as though from a blow and regarded him pitifully as he  stood, head averted.    \"Oh, please listen to me,\" she whispered. \"At first I tell you a lie,  yes.\"    \"And now?\"    \"Now--I tell you the truth.\"    \"That you are a petty thief?\"    \"Ah! you are cruel--you have no pity! You judge me as you judge--one  of your Englishwomen. Perhaps I cannot help what I do. In the East a  woman is a chattel and has no will of her own.\"    \"A chattel!\" cried Stuart scornfully. \"Your resemblance to the  'chattels' of the East is a remote one. There is Eastern blood in  your veins, no doubt, but you are educated, you are a linguist, you  know the world. Right and wrong are recognizable to the lowest savage.\"    \"And if they recognize, but are helpless?\"    Stuart made a gesture of impatience.    \"You are simply seeking to enlist my sympathy,\" he said bitterly.  \"But you have said nothing which inclines me to listen to you any  longer. Apart from the shock of finding you to be--what you are, I  am utterly mystified as to your object. I am a poor man. The entire  contents of my house would fetch only a few hundred pounds if sold  to-morrow. Yet you risk your liberty to rifle my bureau. For the last  time--what have you taken from that drawer?\"    She leaned back against the table, toying with the broken piece of  gold and glancing down at it as she did so. Her long lashes cast  shadows below her eyes, and a hint of colour was returning to her  cheeks. Stuart studied her attentively--even delightedly, for all  her shortcomings, and knew in his heart that he could never give her  in charge of the police. More and more the wonder of it all grew upon  him, and now he suddenly found himself thinking of the unexplained  incident of the previous night.    \"You do not answer,\" he said. \"I will ask you another question: have  you attempted to open that drawer prior to this evening?\"    Mlle. Dorian looked up rapidly, and her cheeks, which had been pale,  now flushed rosily.    \"I try twice before,\" she confessed, \"and cannot open it.\"    \"Ah! And--has _someone else_ tried also?\"    Instantly her colour fled again, and she stared at him wide-eyed,  fearful.    \"Someone else?\" she whispered.    \"Yes--someone else. A man ... wearing a sort of cowl----\"    \"Oh?\" she cried and threw out her hands in entreaty. \"Do not ask me of  _him_! I dare not answer--I dare not!\"    \"You have answered,\" said Stuart, in a voice unlike his own; for a  horrified amazement was creeping upon him and supplanting the  contemptuous anger which the discovery of this beautiful girl engaged  in pilfering his poor belongings had at first aroused.    The mystery of her operations was explained--explained by a deeper  and a darker mystery. The horror of the night had been no dream but  an almost incredible reality. He now saw before him an agent of the  man in the cowl; he perceived that he was in some way entangled in an  affair vastly more complex and sinister than a case of petty larceny.    \"Has the golden scorpion anything to do with the matter?\" he demanded  abruptly.    And in the eyes of his beautiful captive he read the answer. She  flinched again as she had done when he had taunted her with being a  thief; but he pressed his advantage remorselessly.    \"So you were concerned in the death of Sir Frank Narcombe!\" he said.    \"I was not!\" she cried at him fiercely, and her widely opened eyes  were magnificent. \"Sir Frank Narcombe is----\"    She faltered--and ceased speaking, biting her lip which had become  tremulous again.    \"Sir Frank Narcombe is?\" prompted Stuart, feeling himself to stand  upon the brink of a revelation.    \"I know nothing of him--this Sir Frank Narcombe.\"    Stuart laughed unmirthfully.    \"Am I, by any chance, in danger of sharing the fate of that  distinguished surgeon?\" he asked.    His question produced an unforeseen effect. Mlle. Dorian suddenly  rested her jewelled hands upon his shoulders, and he found himself  looking hungrily into those wonderful Eastern eyes.    \"If I swear that I speak the truth, will you believe me?\" she  whispered, and her fingers closed convulsively upon his shoulders.    He was shaken. Her near presence was intoxicating. \"Perhaps,\" he said  unsteadily.    \"Listen, then. _Now_ you are in danger, yes. Before, you were not, but  now you must be very careful. Oh! indeed, indeed, I tell you true! I  tell you for your own sake. Do with me what you please. I do not care.  It does not matter. You ask me why I come here. I tell you that also.  I come for what is in the long envelope--look, I cannot hide it. It  is on the fire!\"    Stuart turned and glanced toward the grate. A faint wisp of brown  smoke was arising from a long white envelope which lay there. Had the  fire been actually burning, it must long ago have been destroyed.  More than ever mystified, for the significance of the envelope was  not evident to him, he ran to the grate and plucked the smouldering  paper from the embers.    As he did so, the girl, with one quick glance in his direction,  snatched her cloak, keys and bag and ran from the room. Stuart heard  the door close, and racing back to the table he placed the slightly  charred envelope there beside the fragment of gold and leapt to the  door.    \"Damn!\" he said.    His escaped prisoner had turned the key on the outside. He was locked  in his own study!    Momentarily nonplussed, he stood looking at the closed door. The sound  of a restarted motor from outside the house spurred him to action. He  switched off the lamps, crossed the darkened room and drew back the  curtain, throwing open the French windows. Brilliant moonlight bathed  the little lawn with its bordering of high privet hedges. Stuart ran  out as the sound of the receding car reached his ears. By the time  that he had reached the front of the house the street was vacant from  end to end. He walked up the steps to the front door, which he  unfastened with his latch-key. As he entered the hall, Mrs. M'Gregor  appeared from her room.    \"I did no' hear ye go out with Miss Dorian,\" she said.    \"That's quite possible, Mrs. M'Gregor, but she has gone, you see.\"    \"Now tell me, Mr. Keppel, did ye or did ye no' hear the wail o' the  pibroch the night?    \"No--I am afraid I cannot say that I did, Mrs. M'Gregor,\" replied  Stuart patiently. \"I feel sure you must be very tired and you can  justifiably turn in now. I am expecting no other visitor. Good-night.\"    Palpably dissatisfied and ill at ease, Mrs. M'Gregor turned away.    \"Good-night, Mr. Keppel,\" she said.    Stuart, no longer able to control his impatience, hurried to the study  door, unlocked it and entered. Turning on the light, he crossed and  hastily drew the curtains over the window recess, but without  troubling to close the window which he had opened. Then he returned  to the writing-table and took up the sealed envelope whose presence  in his bureau was clearly responsible for the singular visitation of  the cowled man and for the coming of the lovely Mlle. Dorian.    The \"pibroch of the M'Gregors\": He remembered something--something  which, unaccountably, he hitherto had failed to recall: that fearful  wailing in the night--which had heralded the coming of the cowled  man!--or had it been a _signal_ of some kind?    He stared at the envelope blankly, then laid it down and stood looking  for some time at the golden scorpion's tail. Finally, his hands  resting upon the table, he found that almost unconsciously he had  been listening--listening to the dim night sounds of London and to  the vague stirrings within the house.    \"_Now_, you are in danger. Before, you were not....\"    Could he believe her? If in naught else, in this at least surely she  had been sincere? Stuart started--then laughed grimly.    A clock on the mantel-piece had chimed the half-hour.        CHAPTER VI    THE ASSISTANT"]]]
