These cells  were ranged in a passage 11 feet wide, under ground, and were approached  by ten steps.  Over each cell door was an aperture which admitted such  light and air as could be found in such a place.  Some improvement took  place in this respect after Mr. Howard's visit.  There was also a large  dungeon or cell which looked upon the street, in which twelve prisoners  were confined.  This dungeon was not considered safe, so that only  deserters were put into it.  As many as forty persons have been  incarcerated in it at one time.  In five of the cells there were four  prisoners; in the other two, there were only three.    The court-yards (one of which was 20 yards by 30, the other 20 yards by  10) were kept in a most filthy state, although a fine pump of good water  was readily accessible.  The yards were brick-paved.  In one yard I  noticed a large dung-heap, which, I was informed, was only removed once a  month.  There were numbers of fowls about the yard, belonging to the  prison officials and to the prisoners.  In these yards, as may readily be  supposed, scenes of great disorder took place.  The utmost licentiousness  was prevalent in the prison throughout.  Spirits and malt liquors were  freely introduced without let, hindrance, or concealment, though against  the prison rules--not one of which, by the way, (except the feeing  portion) was kept.  The felons' \"garnish,\" as it was called, was  abolished previous to 1809, but the debtors' fee remained.  The prison  was dirty in the extreme; the mud almost ankle deep in some parts in the  passages, and the walls black and grimy.  There seemed to be no system  whatever tending towards cleanliness, and as to health that was utterly  disregarded.  Low typhoid fever was frequently prevalent, and numbers  were swept off by it.  The strong prisoners used to tyrannise over the  weak, and the most frightful cases of extortion and cruelty were  practised amongst them, while the conduct of the officials was culpable  in the highest degree.  At one time the chapel was let as an assembly  room.  The prisoners used to get up, on public ball nights, dances of  their own, as the band could be plainly heard throughout the prison.  The  debtors used to let down a glove or bag by means of a stick, from their  tower into the street, dangling it up and down to attract the notice of  passengers, who dropped in pieces of money for the use of the \"poor  debtors,\" which money was invariably spent in feasting and debauchery.  The town boys used to put stones into the bags, and highly relished the  disappointment of the \"poor debtors,\" on discovery of their \"treasure.\"    I recollect an execution taking place in front of the Tower, which  created an immense sensation throughout the country.  In March 1789, two  men named Burns and Dowling, suffered the extreme penalty of the law for  robbing the house of Mrs. Graham, which stood on Rose Hill.  They broke  into the lady's dwelling, and acted with great ferocity.  It was on the  23rd December previous; they entered the house, with two others, about  seven o'clock in the morning.  One stayed below, while the others went  into the different rooms armed with pistols and knives, threatening the  various members of the family with death if they made any alarm.  They  robbed some guests in the house of nineteen guineas, and some silver; and  from Mrs. Graham they took bills to a large amount.  On the 7th January,  following, Burns and Dowling were arrested at Bristol, in consequence of  an anonymous letter sent to the mayor of that city, giving information of  their being in the neighbourhood.  They were on the point of embarking  for Dublin, having several packages containing Mrs. Graham's property on  board the vessel, besides 1000 pounds in Bills of Exchange.  Dowling made  a fierce resistance, and would have escaped, but was held by the leg by a  dog belonging to one of the constables.  Rose Hill at that time was quite  in the suburbs, and was a very fashionable locality.  The town was  crowded with strangers from all parts to witness the execution of these  villains.  Men of the present day would be horror-struck at the number of  executions that took place at that time in England.  I recollect once  when in London (I was only three days going there) seeing three men  hanging at Newgate, while the coal waggoners were letting off their  waggons as stages for spectators at twopence per head.    The various prisoners in the Tower were all removed to the new gaol, or  French prison, as it was called, on the French being released from  custody, at the peace of 1812.  This prison, which stood in Great  Howard-street--I little thought I should live to see it swept away--was  designed by Mr. Howard.  Great Howard-street was called after him.  The  Frenchmen did so much damage to the gaol, that it cost 2000 pounds to put  it in order after their departure.  These people maintained themselves by  making fancy articles, and carved bone and ivory work.  I once saw a ship  made by one of them--an exquisite specimen of ingenuity and  craftsmanship.  The ropes, which were all spun to the proper sizes, were  made of the prisoner's wife's hair.  I had in my possession for many  years, two cabinets, with drawers, &c., made of straw, and most  beautifully inlaid.    I went with Mr. Nield, in one of his visits to Liverpool, to inspect the  Bridewell which stood on the Fort.  The building was intended for a  powder magazine; but being found damp, it was not long used for that  purpose.  The keeper was Robert Walton, who was paid one guinea per week  wages.  There were no perquisites attached to this place, neither in  \"fees\" nor \"garnish.\"  In fact, the prisoners confined within its dreary,  damp walls had nothing to pay for, nor expect.  There were no  accommodations of any sort.  The corporation certainly found \"firing,\"  but nothing else, either in beds or food, not even water.  There was no  yard to it, nor convenience of any kind.  Under ground were two dreary,  damp, dark vaults, approached by eight steps.  One of them was 18 feet by  12, the other 12 feet by 7.5.  They received little light through  iron-barred windows.  Above were two rooms.  One was 18 feet by 10, the  other 10 feet by 9.  Adjoining these two rooms, devoid of fire-grate or  windows, were two cells, each 5 feet by 6 feet high.  The prisoners in  this dreadful place, were herded together, unemployed in any way, and  dependent entirely upon their friends for food.  It was a disgrace to  humanity.  It was damp, dirty, and in a most miserable condition.    An interesting circumstance connected with the Tower I find detailed in a  book of my father's, which he called \"_The Family Log_.\"  It relates to  the escape of some prisoners-of-war confined in the Tower.  My father in  this \"Log,\" used to enter up at the week's end any little circumstance of  interest that might have come under his notice.  At the date of Sunday,  _May_ 6_th_, 1759, I find \"That fifteen French prisoners escaped from the  Tower, Durand amongst the number\"; and then follows a narrative which I  shall presently transcribe.  I may say, incidentally, that the  prisoners-of-war in the Tower were principally Frenchmen, who had been  captured during some of our naval engagements with them.  They employed  their time in making many curious and tasteful articles, and displayed  great ingenuity in many ways.  Discipline in the Tower was not very  stringent, so that escapes of prisoners frequently occurred.  From the  want of energy displayed by the authorities in recapturing those that did  escape, it was thought that government was not sorry to get rid of some  of these persons at so easy a rate, for they were a great burden on the  nation.  The reason why Durand's name was mentioned as one of those who  had fled, was this:--my mother had a very curiously-constructed foreign  box, which had been broken, and which the tradesmen in the town had one  and all declined even to attempt to repair.  As \"the Frenchmen\" in the  Tower were noted for their ingenuity, my father made some inquiry as to  whether any of them would undertake the restoration of this box.  Amongst  others to whom it was shown was one Felix Durand, who at once said he  would try to put it in order if my father was in no hurry for it, as it  would be a tedious task in consequence of having so many separate pieces  to join together, and it would be necessary to wait the fast binding of  each cemented piece to its corresponding fragment.    My father often went to see Durand, and was much pleased with his  conversation, amusing stories, and natural abilities.  My father spoke  French well, so that they got on capitally together, and the consequence  was that my father obtained several little favours for him, and even  interceded with some friends in the government to obtain his release.  Durand knew of this, and, therefore, when my father found he had escaped  with the others, he was much annoyed as it completely frustrated his good  intentions towards him.  My father used to tell us that according to  agreement he went for his box on a certain day when it was to be  finished.  On reaching the gaol he was told of the escape of the party,  and that some of them had already been recaptured.  It seems that as soon  as they got into the street the party dispersed, either singly or in twos  and threes; but having neither food nor money, and being quite ignorant  of the English language or the localities round Liverpool, they were  quite helpless and everywhere betrayed who they were, what they were, and  where they came from.  Some fell in with the town watchmen; others struck  out into the country, and after wandering about in a starved, hungry, and  miserable state, were very glad to get back to their old shelter, bad as  they thought it, and hardly as they considered they had been treated.  They admitted that their party was too large, that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21359"],[0,"Off to the Wilds: Being the Adventures of Two Brothers (#5)"],[1,"  dogs--Pompey, Caesar, Crassus, and Rough'un--came bounding about,  leaping up at their masters, and taking short dashes out into the plain  and back.    \"Where are those two boys?\" said Mr Rogers suddenly.  \"I haven't seen  them for days.\"    \"Dinny offended them,\" said Jack petulantly, as he patted the arched  neck of Stockings.  \"He told them they shouldn't go.\"    \"Sure I only hinted to the black young gintlemen that it was just  possible the masther might lave them behind, when they took themselves  off in the most ondacent way; and that's all I know, sor.\"    \"Here they are!\" cried Jack suddenly, \"Hi-yi-yi-yi--Coff!  Hi-yi-yi-yi--  Chick!\"    \"Hi-yi-yi-yi-yi!\" echoed back; and the two boys came running up, one on  either side of a fierce-looking, very powerfully-built Zulu--a handful  of assegais, and his long, narrow, oval shield in one hand, and for  costume a fringe of skins round the waist, a sort of tippet of the same  over his back and chest, and smaller fringes just beneath each knee.  His back hair was secured in a knot behind, and depending from it were  some feathers, one of which drooped right down his back.    He was a noble-looking specimen of humanity, and as he came up he gazed  almost haughtily round at the party, seeming as if he had come as an  enemy, and not as a friend.    \"Been fetch de father,\" cried Coffee, pushing the great Zulu towards Mr  Rogers.  \"Father going to boss.  Kill and hunt lion.\"    Mr Rogers raised his eyebrows a little, for he had not reckoned upon  this; but one more or less on such an expedition did not matter, for  plenty of provisions would be killed; and a man like this was no little  addition to their strength.    \"Oh, very good,\" he said.  \"Dinny, run into the house, and fetch the  bread and meat we left.  I daresay the boys are hungry.\"    Coffee and Chicory understood that, and they began to grin and rub their  \"tum-tums,\" as they called a prominent part of their persons; but the  next moment they had dragged their father to introduce him to Boss Dick  and Boss Jack, smiling with delight on seeing their young masters shake  hands with the Zulu warrior.    Dinny did not look at all pleasant as he brought out the bread and meat,  which was rapidly shared by the Zulu and his boys, who evidently meant  to eat the food as they went along; so after one more look round, and a  glance at the two great water-casks swung behind the waggon, Mr Rogers  gave the word, Peter the driver stood up on the great chest strapped in  front, cracking his whip with both hands, and Dirk the foreloper  followed suit.    \"Trek Hans!  Trek Buffler!  Trek Zulu!  Trek boys!  Trek!\" shouted  Peter, dancing about on the chest in his excitement.    \"Trek, beauties!  Trek, beauties!  Trek!  Trek!  Trek!\" yelled Dirk.    The oxen slowly tugged at their yokes, the great trek-tow tightened, the  wheels of the fine new waggon creaked; and as Mr Rogers mounted the big  bay, his sons took off and waved their caps, giving a loud cheer, for  now they were really off to the wilds.        CHAPTER FIVE.    A TASTE OF SOMETHING TO COME.    There was but little in the way of incident for some time.  The dogs  seemed to be never weary of hunting here and there, thrusting their  noses under every rock, their heads into every hole; but they found  nothing till after the midday halt, when a furious barking from the  setter Rough'un took the attention of all, and Mr Rogers and the boys  cantered up to a thin cluster of trees, where, on what seemed to be at  first a broken stump, but which on nearer inspection proved to be a tall  ragged ant-hill, a vicious-looking snake was curled, swinging its head  about threateningly, and darting out its forked tongue at the dog, which  kept its distance, barking furiously.    \"A poisonous fellow--cobra evidently.  Now, Dick, bring it down.\"    \"No; let Jack shoot, father,\" said Dick.  \"My head aches, and I'm tired.  Well, yes, I will.\"    \"That's right, my boy.  I want you to master this weakness,\" said his  father.  \"And besides, I want you to try how your horse stands fire.  Nip him tightly with your knees.\"    Dick cocked his double-barrelled breechloader--fired--and the serpent  hissed loudly and began to descend, but a shot from Jack's rifle laid it  writhing on the ground, when, before it could be prevented, Rough'un  seized it behind the head, worrying it furiously.    Fortunately the creature was mortally wounded, or it might have gone  hard with one of the dogs, its poison being very violent; and the others  coming up soon tore it to pieces.    \"Your horses behaved admirably,\" said Mr Rogers.  \"You must train them,  my boys, so that they will stand where you leave them, and take no more  notice of a shot fired over their heads than at a distance.\"    They halted directly after for a midday meal, the oxen finding a  plentiful supply of fresh grass and water, and after a good rest they  were once more on the way, the horses behind under the care of Dinny and  the Zulu warrior.    Mr Rogers and his sons were close to the oxen, Coffee and Chicory were  close behind, and they were inspecting the team, which was pulling  steadily and well, when Mr Rogers said,--    \"Well, boys, we may as well get our guns.  We shall soon be in the  hunting country now.\"    \"Hi!  Yup-yup-yup!\" shouted Coffee.    \"Ho!  Yup-yup-yup!\" yelled Chicory.  The dogs began to yelp and bark;  and in the excitement, as they saw an animal like a great long-eared  spotted cat dash out of a clump of trees and make for some rocky ground,  all joined in the chase; Mr Rogers ran as hard as the rest, forcing his  pith hunting-helmet down over his head.  Coffee got well in front,  waving his arms and shouting; but Chicory trod upon a thorn and began to  limp.  As for Jack, in his excitement he tripped over a stump, and fell  sprawling; while Dick had hard work to save himself from a similar  mishap.  Last of all, whip in hand, came the foreloper, who had left the  oxen in his excitement, flourishing and cracking his lash.    There was a sharp hunt for a few minutes, during which the followers  toiled on over the rocky ground, seeing nothing after their first  glimpse of the lynx--for such Mr Rogers declared it to be; then they  met the dogs coming back, looking very stupid, and quite at fault.    Rough'un, however, went on with Coffee, and Jack followed, to find that  the lynx had evidently gone down a deep rift, where it was impossible to  follow it; so they went back to the waggons, both Jack and his father  determining that in future they would never be without either gun or  rifle in hand.    Every minute, almost, as they journeyed on, the boys realised the value  of having the waggon made in the best manner, and of the strongest wood  that could be obtained, for it bumped and swayed about, creaking  dismally beneath its heavy load, and making the casks and pots slung  beneath clatter together every now and then, as it went over some larger  stone than usual.  They saw too the value of a good foreloper; for if a  careless man were at the head of the oxen, the waggon might at any  moment be wrecked over some rugged rock or sunk to the floor in a black  patch of bog.    The dogs seemed rather ashamed of themselves after the chase of the  lynx, and went with lolling tongues to trot behind the waggon, Pompey  now and then making an angry snatch at Caesar, while Crassus threw up  his muzzle and uttered a dismal yelp.  Rough'un, too, did not seem  happy, but to have that lynx on his conscience; for he kept running out  from beneath the waggon, and looking back as if bound to finish the  chase by hunting the cat-like creature out; but he always altered his  mind and went under the waggon once more, to walk close to the heels of  the last pair of oxen, one of which looked back from time to time in a  thoughtful meditative way, with its great soft eyes, as if in  consideration whether it ought to kick out and send Rough'un flying.    This act made Rough'un run forward, and as the ox bent down snuffing at  it, the dog leaped up at its muzzle, then at that of the next ox, and  went on right along the whole span, saluting all in turn without getting  trampled, and ending by retaking his place beneath the waggon front.    For Rough'un was a dog of a different breed to his fellows, and though  he hunted with them he did not associate with them afterwards, but kept  himself to himself.    There was not much to interest the boys after the first excitement of  the start was over, for they had to travel over plain and mountain for  some distance before they would reach ground that had not been well  hunted over by the settlers; but every step took them nearer, and there  were endless matters to canvass.  For instance, there were the  capabilities of their horses, which grew in favour every time they were  mounted; the excellences of their guns, presented to them by their  father for the expedition, light handy pieces, double-barrelled  breechloaders, the right-hand barrel being that of an ordinary shot-gun,  the left-hand being a rifle sighted up to three hundred yards.    It would be hard to say how many times these guns were loaded and  unloaded, slung across their owners' backs and taken down again, while  the eagerness with which they looked forward to some good opening for  trying their skill was notable.    But beyond an occasional bird which fled with a loud cry at the approach  of the waggon, and a little herd of springbok seen upon the edge of a  low hill quite a mile away, there was little to break the monotony of  the journey over the hot sandy waste, and every one was pretty weary  when, just at sundown, they came in sight of a low house, the abode of a  Boer who had settled there some years before, and who, with his large  family, seemed to be perfectly content, and who smiled with satisfaction  on being presented with some sweets in return for his civility in  pointing out the places where the out-span"]]]
