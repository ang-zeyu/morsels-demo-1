In the  Archaic-Greek Ionic order, owing to the greater width of the  capital, the abacus is rectangular in plan, and consists of a  carved ovolo moulding.  In later examples the abacus is square,  except where there are angle volutes, when it is slightly  curved over the same.  In the Roman and Renaissance Ionic  capital, the abacus is square with a fillet On the top of an  ogee moulding, but curved over angle volutes.  In the Greek  Corinthian order the abacus is moulded, its sides are concave  and its angles canted (except in one or two exceptional Greek  capitals, where it is brought to a sharp angle); and the same  shape is adopted in the Roman and Renaissance Corinthian and  Composite capitals, in some cases with the ovolo moulding  carved.  In Romanesque architecture the abacus is square with  the lower edge splayed off and moulded or carved, and the  same was retained in France during the medieval period; but  in England,in Early English work, a circular deeply moulded  abacus was introduced, which in the 14th and 15th centuries  was transformed into an octagonal one.  The diminutive of  Abacus, ABACISCUS, is applied in architecture to the chequers  or squares of a tessellated pavement . ``Abacus'' is also the  name of an instrument employed by the ancients for arithmetical  calculations; pebbles, hits of bone or coins being used as  counters.  Fig. 1 shows a Roman abacus taken from an ancient  monument.  It contains seven long and seven shorter rods  or bars, the former having four perforated beads running  on them and the latter one.  The bar marked 1 indicates  units, X tens, and so on up to millions.  The beads on the  shorter bars denote fives,--five units, five tens, &c. The  rod O and corresponding short rod are for marking ounces;  and the short quarter rods for fractions of an ounce.    The Swan-Pan of the Chinese (fig. 2) closely resembles  the Roman abacus in its construction and use.  Computations  are made with it by means of balls of bone or ivory running  on slender bamboo rods, similar to the simpler board,  fitted up with beads strung on wires, which is employed in  teaching the rudiments of arithmetic in English schools.    FIG. 2.--Chinese Swan-Pan.  The name of ``abacus'' is also  given, in logic, to an instrument, often called the ``logical  machine,'' analogous to the mathematical abacus.  It is  constructed to show all the possible combinations of a set of  logical terms with their negatives, and, further, the way in which  these combinations are affected by the addition of attributes  or other limiting words, i.e. to simplify mechanically the  solution of logical problems.  These instruments are all more  or less elaborate developments of the ``logical slate,'' on  which were written in vertical columns all the combinations  of symbols or letters which could be made logically out of a  definite number of terms.  These were compared with any given  premises, and those which were incompatible were crossed  off.  In the abacus the combinations are inscribed each on a  single slip of wood or similar substance, which is moved by a  key; incompatible combinations can thus be mechanically removed  at will, in accordance with any given series of premises.  The principal examples of such machines are those of W. S.  Jevons (Element.  Lessons in Logic, C. xxiii.), John Venn  (see his Symbolic Logic, 2nd ed., 1894, p. 135), and Allan  Marquand (see American Academy of Arts and Sciences, 1885, pp.  303-7, and Johns Hopkins University Studies in Logic, 1883).    ABADDON, a Hebrew word meaning ``destruction.'' In poetry  it comes to mean ``place of destruction,'' and so the  underworld or Sheol (cf. Job xxvi. 6; Prov. xv. 11). In Rev.  ix. 11 Abaddon ((Abaddon) is used of hell personified,  the prince of the underworld.  The term is here explained  as Apollyon (q.v.), the ``destroyer.', W. Baudissin  (Herzog-Hauck, Realencyklo padie) notes that Hades and  Abaddon in Rabbinic writings are employed as personal names,  just as shemayya in Dan. iv. 23, shamayim (``heaven''),  and makom (``place'') among the Rabbins, are used of God.    ABADEH, a small walled town of Persia, in the province of  Fars, situated at an elevation of 6200 ft. in a fertile  plain on the high road between Isfahan and Shiraz, 140 m.  from the former and 170 m. from the latter place.  Pop.  4000.  It is the chief place of the Abadeh-Iklid district,  which has 30 villages; it has telegraph and post offices,  and is famed for its carved wood-work, small boxes, trays,  sherbet spoons, &c., made of the wood of pear and box trees.    ABAE (rabai), a town in the N.E. corner of Phocis, in  Greece, famous in early times for its oracle of Apollo,  one of those consulted by Croesus (Herod. i. 46). It was  rich in treasures (Herod. viii. 33), but was sacked by the  Persians, and the temple remained in a ruined state.  The  oracle was, however, still consulted, e.g. by the Thebans  before Leuctra (Paus. iv. 32. 5). The temple seems to have  been burnt again during the Sacred War, and was in a very  dilapidated state when seen by Pausanias (x. 35), though  some restoration, as well as the building of a new temple,  was undertaken by Hadrian.  The sanctity of the shrine  ensured certain privileges to the people of Abac (Bull.  Corresp.  Hell. vi. 171), and these were confirmed by the  Romans.  The polygonal wabs of the acropolis may still be  seen in a fair state of preservation on a circular hill  standing about 500 ft. above the little plain of Exarcho;  one gateway remains, and there are also traces of town walls  below.  The temple site was on a low spur of the hill, below the  town.  An early terrace wall supports a precinct in which are  a stoa and some remains of temples; these were excavated by the  British School at Athens in 1894, but very little was found.    See also W. M. Leake, Travels in Northern Greece, ii. p. 163i Journal  of Hellenic Studies, xvi. pp. 291-312 (V. W. Yorke). . (E. GR.)    ABAKANSK, a fortified town of Siberia, in the Russian  government of Yeniseisk, on the river Yenisei, 144 m.  S.S.W.  of Krasnoyarsk, in lat. 54 deg. 20' N., long. 91 deg. 40' E. This is  considered the mildest and most salubrious place in Siberia, and  is remarkable for certain tumuli (of the Li Kitai) and statues  of men from seven to nine feet high, covered with hieroglyphics.  Peter the Great had a fort built here in 1707.  Pop. 2000.    ABALONE, the Spanish name used in California for various  species of the shell-fish of the Haliotidae family, with a  richly coloured shell yielding mother-of-pearl.  This sort  of Haliotis is also commonly called ``ear-shell,'' and in  Guernsey ``ormer'' (Fr. ormier, for oreille de mer).  The abalone shell is found especially at Santa Barbara and  other places on the southern Californian coast, and when  polished makes a beautiful ornament.  The mollusc itself is  often eaten, and dried for consumption in China and Japan.    ABANA (or AMANAH, classical Chrysorrhoas) and PHARPAR,  the ``rivers of Damascus'' (2 Kings v. 12), now generally  identified with the Barada (i.e. ``cold'') and the A`waj  (i.e. ``crooked'') respectively, though if the reference  to Damascus be limited to the city, as in the Arabic  version of the Old Testament, Pharpar would be the modern  Taura.  Both streams run from west to east across the plain of  Damascus, which owes to them much of its fertility, and lose  themselves in marshes, or lakes, as they are called, on the  borders of the great Arabian desert.  John M'Gregor, who gives  an interesting description of them in his Rob Roy on the  Jordan, affirmed that as a work of hydraulic engineering,  the system and construction of the canals, by which the Abana  and Pharpar were used for irrigation, might be considered as  one of the most complete and extensive in the world.  As the  Barada escapes from the mountains through a narrow gorge,  its waters spread out fan-like, in canals or ``rivers'', the  name of one of which, Nahr Banias, retains a trace of Abana.    ABANCOURT, CHARLES XAVIER JOSEPH DE FRANQUE VILLE D',  (1758-1792), French statesman, and nephew of Calonne.  He was  Louis XVI.'s last minister of war (July 1792), and organized  the defence of the Tuileries for the 10th of August.  Commanded  by the Legislative Assembly to send away the Swiss guards, he  refused, and was arrested for treason to the nation and sent  to Orleans to be tried.  At the end of August the Assembly  ordered Abancourt and the other prisoners at Orleans to  be transferred to Paris with an escort commanded by Claude  Fournier, ``the American.'' At Versailles they learned of the  massacres at Paris, and Abancourt and his fellow-prisoners  were murdered in cold blood on the 8th of September 1792.  Fournier was unjustly charged with complicity in the crime.    ABANDONMENT (Fr. abandonnement, from abandonner, to  abandon, relinquish; abandonner was originally equivalent  to mettrea bandon, to leave to the jurisdiction, i.e. of  another, bandon being from Low Latin bandum, bannum, order,  decree, ``ban''), in law, the relinquishment of an interest,  claim, privilege or possession.  Its signification varies  according to the branch of the law in which it is employed,  but the more important uses of the word are summarized below.    ABANDONMENT OF AN ACTION is the discontinuance of proceedings  commenced in the High Court of Justice either because the  plaintiff is convinced that he will not succeed in his action  or for other reasons.  Previous to the Judicature Act of 1875,  considerable latitude was allowed as to the time when a suitor  might abandon his action, and yet preserve his right to bring  another action on the same suit (see NONSUIT); but since 1875  this right has been considerably curtailed, and a plaintiff who  has deilvered his reply (see PLEADING), and afterwards wishes  to abandon his action, can generally obtain leave so to do only  on"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20014"],[0,"Canada and the Canadians, Vol. 1 (#5)"],[1,"d, whilst their senseless feuds among  themselves harass society, they eagerly seek occasions for that restless  political excitement to which they are accustomed in their own unhappy  and regretted country.    A body of these hewers of wood and drawers of water, who, when not  excited, are the most innocent and harmless people in the world--easily  led, but never to be driven--get employed on a canal or great public  work; and, no sooner do they settle down upon wages which must appear  like a dream to them, than some old feud between Cork and Connaught,  some ancient quarrel of the Capulets and Montagues of low life, is  recollected, or a chant of the Boyne water is heard, and to it they go  pell-mell, cracking one another's heads and disturbing a peaceful  neighbourhood with their insane broils.    Or, should a devil, in the shape of an adviser, appear among them, and  persuade these excitable folks that they may obtain higher wages by  forcing their own terms, bludgeons and bullets are resorted to, in order  to compel compliance, and incendiarism and murder follow, until a  military force is called out to quell the riots.    The scenes of this kind in Canada, where vast sums are annually expended  on the public works, have been frightful; and such has been the terror  which these lawless hordes have inspired, that timid people have quitted  their properties and fled out of the reach of the moral pestilence; nay,  it has been carried so far, that a Scotch regiment has been marked on  account of its having been accidentally on duty in putting down a canal  riot; and, wherever its station has afterwards been cast, the vengeance  of these people has followed it.    At Montreal, the elections have been disgraced by bodies of these  canallers having been employed to intimidate and overawe voters; and,  were it not that a large military force is always at hand there, no  election could be made of a member, whose seat would be the unbiassed  and free choice of his constituents.    It is, however, very fortunate for Canada that these canallers are not  usually inclined to settle, but wander about from work to work, and  generally, in the end, go to the United States. The Irish who settle are  fortunately a different people; and, as they go chiefly into the  backwoods, lead a peaceful and industrious life.    But it is, nevertheless, very amusing, and affords much insight into the  workings of frail human nature to observe the conduct of that portion of  the Irish emigrants who find that they have neither the means of  obtaining land, nor of quitting some large town at which they may  arrive. Their first notion then is to go out to service, which they had  left Ireland to avoid altogether. The father usually becomes a  day-labourer, the sons farm-servants or household servants in the towns,  the daughters cooks, nursery-maids, &c.    When they come to the mistress of a family to hire, they generally sit  down on the nearest chair to the door in the room, and assume a manner  of perfect familiarity, assuring the lady of the house that they never  expected to go out to service in America, but that some family  misfortune has rendered such a step necessary. The lady then, of course,  asks them what branch of household service they can undertake; to which  the invariable reply is, anything--cook or housemaid, child's-maid or  housekeeper, and that indeed they lived in better places at home than  they expect to get in America, such as Lord So-and-so's, or Squire  So-and-so's.    The end of this is obvious; and a lady told me, the other day, she hired  a professed cook, who was very shortly put to the test by a dinner-party  occurring a day or two after she joined the household. Her mistress  ordered dinner; and one joint, or _piece de resistance_, was a fine  fillet of veal. The professed cook, it appeared, laboured under a little  _manque d'usage_ on two delicate points, for she very unexpectedly burst  into her lady's boudoir just as she was dressing for dinner, and  exclaimed, \"Mistress, dear, what'll I do with the vail?\"--\"The veil?\"  said the dame, in horror; \"what veil?\"--\"Why, the vail in the pot, marm;  I biled it, and it swelled out so, the divil a get it out can I git it.\"    So with the farm-servants, they can all do everything; and an Irish  gentleman told me that he lately hired a young man, an emigrant, to  plough for him; and, on asking him if he understood ploughing, the  good-natured Paddy answered, offhand, \"Ploughing, is it? I'm the boy for  ploughing.\"--\"Very well, I'm glad of it,\" said the gentleman, \"for you  are a fine, likely young fellow, so I shall hire you.\" He hired him  accordingly at high wages--ten dollars a month and provisions and  lodging found. The first day he was to work, my friend told him to go  and yoke the oxen. Paddy stared with all his eyes, but said nothing, and  went away. He staid some time, and then returned with a pair of oxen,  which he was driving before him. \"Here's the oxen, master!\"--\"Where are  the yokes, Paddy?\"--\"The yokes! by the powers, is that what they call  beef in Canady?\" Poor Paddy had been a weaver all his live-long days.    The Irish are almost exclusively the servants in most parts of the  northern states and throughout Canada, excepting the French Canadians,  and very attached, faithful servants they frequently are; but notions of  liberty and equality get possession of their phrenological developments,  and they are almost always on the move to better their condition, which  rarely happens as they desire.    Then another crying evil in Canada and in the States is the rage for  dress. An Irish girl no sooner gets a modicum of wages than all her  thoughts are to go to chapel or church as fine or finer than her  mistress. Nearly every servant-girl in the large towns has a _ridicule_  (that must be the proper way of spelling it), a bustle, a parasol, an  expensive shawl, and a silk gown, and fine bonnet, gloves, and a white  pocket-handkerchief. The men are not so aspiring, and usually don on  Sundays a blue coat and brass buttons, white pantaloons, white gloves,  and a good fur cap in winter, or a neat straw hat or brilliant beaver in  summer. The waistcoat is nondescript, but the boots are irreproachable.  A cigar has nearly replaced the pipe in the streets.    I will defy a short-sighted person to distinguish her nursery-maid from  her own sister at a little distance; and, being somewhat afflicted that  way myself, I frequently nod to a well-dressed soubrette, thinking she  is at least a leading member of the aristocracy of the town; and this is  the more amusing, as in all colonial towns and in the _haute societe_ of  the Republic very considerable magnificence is affected, and a rage for  rank and pseudo-importance is not a little the order of the day.  \"Nothing,\" says a distinguished writer upon that most frivolous of all  threadbare subjects, etiquette, \"nothing is more decidedly the sign of a  vulgar-born or a vulgar-bred person than to be ready to practise the  art of cutting.\" I therefore bow to the well-dressed grisettes, upon the  principle of avoiding to be thought vulgar in mixed society by cutting a  lady of tremendous rank; as I would rather take a cook for a Countess,  or a chambermaid for an Honourable, than be guilty of so much rudeness.    You must not smile, gentle reader, and say cooks are often handsomer  than Countesses, or chambermaids prettier than Honourables; I am like  the old man of the Bubbles of Brunnen, insensible to anything but the  beauties of nature. Neither must you think we have no Countesses nor  Honourables in Canada. The former are in truth _rarae aves_, but the  latter--why, every change of ministry creates a batch of them.          CHAPTER II.      The Emigrant and his Prospects.      Those who really wish Canada well desire it to become a second Britain,  and not a mere second Texas. Those who wish it evil, and these comprise  the restless, unprovided race of politicians under whose incessant  agitation Canada has so long groaned, desire its Texian annexation to  the already overgrown States in its vicinity.    That it may become a second Britain and hold the balance of power on the  continent of America is my prayer, and the prayer too of one who  entertains no enmity towards the people of the United States, but who  admires their unceasing exertions in behalf of their country, who would  admire their institutions, based as they are upon those of England, if  the grand design of Washington had been carried out, and perfect freedom  of thought and of action had been secured to the people, instead of a  slavish awe of the mob, an absolute dread of the uneducated masses, a  sovereign contempt of the opinion of the world in accomplishing any  design for the aggrandizement of the Union, the most despotic and  degrading oppression of all who presume to hold religious opinions at  variance with those of the masses, and the chained bondsman in a land of  liberty!    To guard the respectable settler, who has a character at stake, and a  family with some little capital to lay out to better advantage than he  can at home, against the grievous and often fatal errors which have been  propagated for sinister motives by needy adventurers who have written  about Canada, or who are or have been agents for the sake only of the  remuneration which it brings, caring but little for the misery they have  entailed, I have undertaken to continue an account of this fine  province, where nothing is provided by Nature except fertile soil and a  healthy climate; the rest she leaves to unremitting labour and to the  exercise of judgment by the settler.    As I have already inferred, this work will contain nothing vituperative  of the United States, of that people who are the grandchildren of  Britannia, and whose well-being is so essential to the peace and  security of Christendom.    I shall endeavour to render it as plain and"]]]
