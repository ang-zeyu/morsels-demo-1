Worse than Cordts!\"    \"Wal, if I got the best of Bostil I'm willin' to be thought bad. I'm  the first feller to take him in.... An' now, Miss Lucy, look over my  sorrel.\"    Lucy Bostil did indeed have an eye for a horse. She walked straight up  to the wild, shaggy mustang with a confidence born of intuition and  experience, and reached a hand for his head, not slowly, nor yet  swiftly. The mustang looked as if he was about to jump, but he did not.  His eyes showed that he was not used to women.    \"He's not well broken,\" said Lucy. \"Some Navajo has beaten his head in  breaking him.\"    Then she carefully studied the mustang point by point.    \"He's deceiving at first because he's good to look at,\" said Lucy. \"But  I wouldn't own him. A saddle will turn on him. He's not vicious, but  he'll never get over his scare. He's narrow between the eyes--a bad  sign. His ears are stiff--and too close. I don't see anything more  wrong with him.\"    \"You seen enough,\" declared Macomber. \"An' so you wouldn't own him?\"    \"You couldn't make me a present of him--even on my birthday.\"    \"Wal, now I'm sorry, for I was thinkin' of thet,\" replied Macomber,  ruefully. It was plain that the sorrel had fallen irremediably in his  estimation.    \"Macomber, I often tell Dad all you horse-traders get your deserts now  and then. It's vanity and desire to beat the other man that's your  downfall.\"    Lucy went away, with Van shouldering her box, leaving Macomber trying  to return the banter of the riders. The good-natured raillery was  interrupted by a sharp word from one of them.    \"Look! Darn me if thet ain't a naked Indian comin'!\"    The riders whirled to see an apparently nude savage approaching, almost  on a run.    \"Take a shot at thet, Bill,\" said another rider. \"Miss Lucy might  see--No, she's out of sight. But, mebbe some other woman is around.\"    \"Hold on, Bill,\" called Macomber. \"You never saw an Indian run like  thet.\"    Some of the riders swore, others laughed, and all suddenly became keen  with interest.    \"Sure his face is white, if his body's red!\"    The strange figure neared them. It was indeed red up to the face, which  seemed white in contrast. Yet only in general shape and action did it  resemble a man.    \"Damned if it ain't Joel Creech!\" sang out Bill Stark.    The other riders accorded their wondering assent.    \"Gone crazy, sure!\"    \"I always seen it comin'.\"    \"Say, but ain't he wild? Foamin' at the mouth like a winded hoss!\"    Young Creech was headed down the road toward the ford across which he  had to go to reach home. He saw the curious group, slowed his pace, and  halted. His face seemed convulsed with rage and pain and fatigue. His  body, even to his hands, was incased in a thick, heavy coating of red  adobe that had caked hard.    \"God's sake--fellers--\" he panted, with eyes rolling, \"take this--'dobe  mud off me! ... I'm dyin'!\"    Then he staggered into Brackton's place. A howl went up from the riders  and they surged after him.    That evening after supper Bostil stamped in the big room, roaring with  laughter, red in the face; and he astonished Lucy and her aunt to the  point of consternation.    \"Now--you've--done--it--Lucy Bostil!\" he roared.    \"Oh dear! Oh dear!\" exclaimed Aunt Jane.    \"Done what?\" asked Lucy, blankly.    Bostil conquered his paroxysm, and, wiping his moist red face, he eyed  Lucy in mock solemnity.    \"Joel!\" whispered Lucy, who had a guilty conscience.    \"Lucy, I never heard the beat of it.... Joel's smarter in some ways  than we thought, an' crazier in others. He had the sun figgered, but  what'd he want to run through town for? Why, never in my life have I  seen such tickled riders.\"    \"Dad!\" almost screamed Lucy. \"What did Joel do?\"    \"Wal, I see it this way. He couldn't or wouldn't wait for sundown. An'  he wasn't hankerin' to be burned. So he wallows in a 'dobe mud-hole an'  covers himself thick with mud. You know that 'dobe mud! Then he starts  home. But he hadn't figgered on the 'dobe gettin' hard, which it  did--harder 'n rock. An' thet must have hurt more 'n sunburn. Late this  afternoon he came runnin' down the road, yellin' thet he was dyin'. The  boys had conniption fits. Joel ain't over-liked, you know, an' here  they had one on him. Mebbe they didn't try hard to clean him off. But  the fact is not for hours did they get thet 'dobe off him. They washed  an' scrubbed an' curried him, while he yelled an' cussed. Finally they  peeled it off, with his skin I guess. He was raw, an' they say, the  maddest feller ever seen in Bostil's Ford!\"    Lucy was struggling between fear and mirth. She did not look sorry.  \"Oh! Oh! Oh, Dad!\"    \"Wasn't it great, Lucy?\"    \"But what--will he--do?\" choked Lucy.    \"Lord only knows. Thet worries me some. Because he never said a word  about how he come to lose his clothes or why he had the 'dobe on him.  An' sure I never told. Nobody knows but us.\"    \"Dad, he'll do something terrible to me!\" cried Lucy, aghast at her  premonition.        CHAPTER III    The days did not pass swiftly at Bostil's Ford. And except in winter,  and during the spring sand-storms, the lagging time passed pleasantly.  Lucy rode every day, sometimes with Van, and sometimes alone. She was  not over-keen about riding with Van--first, because he was in love with  her; and secondly, in spite of that, she could not beat him when he  rode the King. They were training Bostil's horses for the  much-anticipated races.    At last word arrived from the Utes and Navajos that they accepted  Bostil's invitation and would come in force, which meant, according to  Holley and other old riders, that the Indians would attend about eight  hundred strong.    \"Thet old chief, Hawk, is comin',\" Holley informed Bostil. \"He hasn't  been here fer several years. Recollect thet bunch of colts he had?  They're hosses, not mustangs.... So you look out, Bostil!\"    No rider or rancher or sheepman, in fact, no one, ever lost a chance to  warn Bostil. Some of it was in fun, but most of it was earnest. The  nature of events was that sooner or later a horse would beat the King.  Bostil knew that as well as anybody, though he would not admit it.  Holley's hint made Bostil look worried. Most of Bostil's gray hairs  might have been traced to his years of worry about horses.    The day he received word from the Indians he sent for Brackton,  Williams, Muncie, and Creech to come to his house that night. These  men, with Bostil, had for years formed in a way a club, which gave the  Ford distinction. Creech was no longer a friend of Bostil's, but Bostil  had always been fair-minded, and now he did not allow his animosities  to influence him. Holley, the veteran rider, made the sixth member of  the club.    Bostil had a cedar log blazing cheerily in the wide fireplace, for  these early spring nights in the desert were cold.    Brackton was the last guest to arrive. He shuffled in without answering  the laconic greetings accorded him, and his usually mild eyes seemed  keen and hard.    \"John, I reckon you won't love me fer this here I've got to tell you,  to-night specially,\" he said, seriously.    \"You old robber, I couldn't love you anyhow,\" retorted Bostil. But his  humor did not harmonize with the sudden gravity of his look. \"What's  up?\"    \"Who do you suppose I jest sold whisky to?\"    \"I've no idea,\" replied Bostil. Yet he looked as if he was perfectly  sure.    \"Cordts! ... Cordts, an' four of his outfit. Two of them I didn't know.  Bad men, judgin' from appearances, let alone company. The others was  Hutchinson an'--Dick Sears.\"    \"DICK SEARS!\" exclaimed Bostil.    Muncie and Williams echoed Bostil. Holley appeared suddenly interested.  Creech alone showed no surprise.    \"But Sears is dead,\" added Bostil.    \"He was dead--we thought,\" replied Brackton, with a grim laugh. \"But  he's alive again. He told me he'd been in Idaho fer two years, in the  gold-fields. Said the work was too hard, so he'd come back here.  Laughed when he said it, the little devil! I'll bet he was thinkin' of  thet wagon-train of mine he stole.\"    Bostil gazed at his chief rider.    \"Wal, I reckon we didn't kill Sears, after all,\" replied Holley. \"I  wasn't never sure.\"    \"Lord! Cordts an' Sears in camp,\" ejaculated Bostil, and he began to  pace the room.    \"No, they're gone now,\" said Brackton.    \"Take it easy, boss. Sit down,\" drawled Holley. \"The King is safe, an'  all the racers. I swear to thet. Why, Cordts couldn't chop into thet  log-an'-wire corral if he an' his gang chopped all night! They hate  work. Besides, Farlane is there, an' the boys.\"    This reassured Bostil, and he resumed his chair. But his hand shook a  little.    \"Did Cordts have anythin' to say?\" he asked.    \"Sure. He was friendly an' talkative,\" replied Brackton. \"He came in  just after dark. Left a man I didn't see out with the hosses. He bought  two big packs of supplies, an' some leather stuff, an', of course,  ammunition. Then some whisky. Had plenty of gold an' wouldn't take no  change. Then while his men, except Sears, was carryin' out the stuff,  he talked.\"    \"Go on. Tell me,\" said Bostil.    \"Wal, he'd been out north of Durango an' fetched news. There's wild  talk back there of a railroad goin' to be built some day, joinin' east  an' west. It's interestin', but no sense to it. How could they build a  railroad through thet country?\"    \"North it ain't so cut up an' lumpy as here,\" put in Holley.    \"Grandest idea ever thought of for the West,\" avowed Bostil. \"If thet  railroad ever starts we'll all get rich....  Go on, Brack.\"    \"Then Cordts said water an' grass was peterin' out back on the trail,  same as Red Wilson said last week. Finally he asked, 'How's my friend  Bostil?' I told him you was well. He looked kind of thoughtful then,  an' I knew what was comin'....'How's the King?' 'Grand' I told  him--'grand.'

IJMA'.--The third foundation of the Faith is called Ijma', a word  signifying to be collected or assembled. Technically it means the unanimous  consent of the leading theologians, or what in Christian theology would be  called the \"unanimous consent of the Fathers.\" Practically it is a  collection of the opinions of the Companions, the Tabi'in and the  Taba-i-Tabi'in. \"The Law,\" says Ibn Khaldoun {17} \"is grounded on the  general accord of the Companions and their followers.\" The election of Abu  Bakr to the Khalifate is called Ijma'-i-Ummat, the unanimous consent of the  whole sect. The Companions of the Prophet had special knowledge of the  various circumstances under which special revelations had been made; they  alone knew which verses of the Quran abrogated others, and which verses  were thus abrogated. The knowledge of these matters and many other details  they handed on to their successors, the Tabi'in, who passed the information  on to their followers, the Taba-i-Tabi'in. Some Muslims, the Wahhabis for  example, accept only the Ijma' of the Companions; and by all sects that is  placed in the first rank as regards authority; others accept that of the  'Fugitives' who dwelt at Madina; and there are some amongst the orthodox  who allow, as a matter of theory, that Ijma' may be collected at any time,  but that practically it is not done because there are now no Mujtahidin.  The highest rank a Muslim Theologian could reach was that of a Mujtahid, or  one who could make an Ijtihad, a word which, derived from the same root as  Jihad (a Crescentade), means in its technical sense a logical deduction. It  is defined as the \"attaining to a certain degree of authority in searching  into the principles of jurisprudence.\" The origin of Ijtihad was as  follows:--Muhammad wished to send a man named Mu'az to Yaman to receive  some money collected for alms, which he was then to distribute to the poor.  On appointing him he said: \"O Mu'az, by what rule will you act?\" He  replied, \"by the Law of the Quran.\" \"But if you find no direction therein?\"  \"Then I will act according to the Sunnat of the Prophet.\" \"But what if that  fails?\" \"Then I will make an Ijtihad and act on that.\" The Prophet raised  his hands and said, \"Praise be to God who guides the messenger of His  Prophet in what He pleases.\"[22] This is considered a proof of the  authority of Ijtihad for the Prophet clearly sanctioned it.    {18}    When the Prophet was alive men could go to him with their doubts and fears:  an infallible authority was always present ready to give an inspired  direction. The Khalifs who succeeded the Prophet had only to administer the  Law according to the opinions which they knew Muhammad had held. They were  busily engaged in carrying on the work of conquest; they neither attempted  any new legislation, nor did they depart from the practice of him whom they  revered. \"In the first days of Islam, the knowledge of the Law was purely  Traditional. In forming their judgments they had no recourse either to  speculation, to private opinion, or to arguments founded upon analogy.\"[23]  However, as the Empire grew, new conditions of life arose, giving rise to  questions, concerning which Muhammad had given no explicit direction. This  necessitated the use of Ijtihad. During the Khalifates of Abu Bakr, Omar,  Osman and 'Ali--the Khulafa-i-Rashidin, or the Khalifs who could guide men  in the right way, the custom was for the Faithful to consult them as to the  course of action to be pursued under some new development of circumstances;  for they knew as none other did the Prophet's sayings and deeds, they could  recall to their memories a saying or an act from which a decision could be  deduced. In this way all Muslims could feel that in following their  judgments and guidance they were walking in the right path. But after the  death of 'Ali, the fourth Khalif, civil war and hostile factions imperilled  the continuance of the Faith in its purity. At Madina, where Muhammad's  career as a recognised Prophet was best known, devout men commenced to  learn by heart the Quran, the Sunnat, and the analogical judgments  (Ijtihad) of the four Khalifs. These men were looked up to as authorities,  and their decisions were afterwards known as the 'Customs of Madina.'    It is not difficult to see that a system, which sought to regulate all  departments of life, all developments of men's ideas and energies by the  Sunnat and analogical deductions {19} therefrom, was one which not only  gave every temptation a system could give to the manufacture of Tradition,  but one which would soon become too cumbersome to be of practical use.  Hence, it was absolutely necessary to systematize all this incoherent mass  of Tradition, of judgments given by Khalifs and Mujtahidin. This gave rise  to the systems of jurisprudence, founded by the four orthodox Imams, to one  or other of which all Muslims, except the Shia'hs, belong. These Imams, Abu  Hanifa, Ibn Malik, As-Shafi'i and Ibn Hanbal were all Mujtahidin of the  highest rank. After them it is the orthodox belief that there has been no  Mujtahid. Thus in a standard theological book much used in India it is  written: \"Ijma' is this, that it is not lawful to follow any other than the  four Imams.\" \"In these days the Qazi must make no order, the Mufti give no  fatva (_i.e._ a legal decision), contrary to the opinion of the four  Imams.\" \"To follow any other is not lawful.\" So far then as orthodoxy is  concerned, change and progress are impossible.    Imam Abu Hanifa was born at Basra (A.H. 80), but he spent the greater part  of his life at Kufa. He was the founder and teacher of the body of legists  known as 'the jurists of Irak.' His system differs considerably from that  of the Imam Malik who, living at Madina, confined himself chiefly to  Tradition as the basis of his judgments. Madina was full of the memories of  the sayings and acts of the Prophet; Kufa, the home of Hanifa, on the  contrary, was not founded till after the Prophet's death and so possessed  none of his memories. Islam there came into contact with other races of  men, but from them it had nothing to learn. If these men became Muslims,  well and good: if not, the one law for them as for the Faithful was the  teaching of Muhammad. Various texts of the Quran are adduced to prove the  correctness of this position. \"For to thee have we sent down the book which  cleareth up every thing.\" (Sura xvi. 91) \"Nothing have we passed over in  the book.\" (Sura vi. {20} 38.) \"Neither is there a grain in the darkness of  the earth nor a thing green or sere, but it is noted in a distinct  writing.\" (Sura vi. 59). These texts were held to prove that all law was  provided for by anticipation in the Quran. If a verse could not be found  bearing on any given question, analogical deduction was resorted to. Thus:  \"He it is who created _for you_ all that is on earth.\" (Sura ii. 27).  According to the Hanifite jurists, this is a deed of gift which annuls all  other rights of property. The 'you' refers to Muslims. The earth[24] may be  classified under three heads:--(1) land which never had an owner; (2) land  which had an owner and has been abandoned; (3) the person and property of  the Infidels. From the last division the same legists deduce the lawfulness  of slavery, piracy and constant war against the unbelievers. To return to  Abu Hanifa. He admitted very few Traditions as authoritative in his system,  which claims to be a logical development from the Quran. \"The merit of  logical fearlessness cannot be denied to it. The wants and wishes of men,  the previous history of a country--all those considerations, in fact, which  are held in the West to be the governing principles of legislation, are set  aside by the legists of Irak as being of no account whatever. Legislation  is not a science inductive and experimental, but logical and  deductive.\"[25]    Imam Ibn Malik was born at Madina (A.H. 93) and his system of jurisprudence  is founded, as might be expected from his connection with the sacred city,  on the \"Customs of Madina.\" His business was to arrange and systematize the  Traditions current in Madina, and to form out of them and the \"Customs\" a  system of jurisprudence embracing the whole sphere of life. The treatise  composed by him was called the \"Muwatta\" or \"The Beaten Path.\" The greater  part of its contents are legal maxims and opinions {21} delivered by the  Companions. His system of jurisprudence, therefore, has been described as  historical and traditional. In an elegy on his death by Abu Muhammad Ja'far  it is said: \"His Traditions were of the greatest authority; his gravity was  impressive; and when he delivered them, all his auditors were plunged in  admiration.\"[26] The Traditions were his great delight. \"I delight,\" said  he, \"in testifying my profound respect for the sayings of the Prophet of  God, and I never repeat one unless I feel myself in a state of perfect  purity,\"[27] (_i.e._, after performing a legal ablution.) As death  approached, his one fear was lest he should have exercised his private  judgment in delivering any legal opinion. In his last illness a friend went  to visit him, and enquiring why he wept, received the following answer:  \"Why should I not weep, and who has more right to weep than I? By Allah! I  wish I had been flogged and reflogged for every question of law on which I  pronounced an opinion founded on my own private judgment.\"[28]    Imam As-Shafa'i, a member of the Quraish tribe, was born A.H. 150. He  passed his youth at Mecca but finally settled in Cairo where he died (A.H.  204). Ibn Khallikan relates of him that he was unrivalled for his knowledge  of the Quran, the Sunnat, and the sayings of the Companions. \"Never,\" said  Imam Ibn Hanbal, \"have I passed a night without praying for God's mercy and  blessing upon As-Shafi'i.\" \"Whosoever pretends,\" said Abu Thaur, \"that he  saw the"]]]
