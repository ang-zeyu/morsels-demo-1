Alas, a thousand times alas, that a Revelation so  incomparably great, so infinitely precious, so mightily potent, so  manifestly innocent, should have received, at the hands of a generation so  blind and so perverse, so infamous a treatment! \"O My servants!\"  Baha'u'llah Himself testifies, \"The one true God is My witness! This most  great, this fathomless and surging ocean is near, astonishingly near, unto  you. Behold it is closer to you than your life vein! Swift as the  twinkling of an eye ye can, if ye but wish it, reach and partake of this  imperishable favor, this God-given grace, this incorruptible gift, this  most potent and unspeakably glorious bounty.\"            A WORLD RECEDED FROM HIM      After a revolution of well nigh one hundred years what is it that the eye  encounters as one surveys the international scene and looks back upon the  early beginnings of Baha'i history? A world convulsed by the agonies of  contending systems, races and nations, entangled in the mesh of its  accumulated falsities, receding farther and farther from Him Who is the  sole Author of its destinies, and sinking deeper and deeper into a  suicidal carnage which its neglect and persecution of Him Who is its  Redeemer have precipitated. A Faith, still proscribed, yet bursting  through its chrysalis, emerging from the obscurity of a century-old  repression, face to face with the awful evidences of God's wrathful anger,  and destined to arise above the ruins of a smitten civilization. A world  spiritually destitute, morally bankrupt, politically disrupted, socially  convulsed, economically paralyzed, writhing, bleeding and breaking up  beneath the avenging rod of God. A Faith Whose call remained unanswered,  Whose claims were rejected, Whose warnings were brushed aside, Whose  followers were mowed down, Whose aims and purposes were maligned, Whose  summons to the rulers of the earth were ignored, Whose Herald drained the  cup of martyrdom, over the head of Whose Author swept a sea of unheard-of  tribulations, and Whose Exemplar sank beneath the weight of lifelong  sorrows and dire misfortunes. A world that has lost its bearings, in which  the bright flame of religion is fast dying out, in which the forces of a  blatant nationalism and racialism have usurped the rights and prerogatives  of God Himself, in which a flagrant secularism--the direct offspring of  irreligion--has raised its triumphant head and is protruding its ugly  features, in which the \"majesty of kingship\" has been disgraced, and they  who wore its emblems have, for the most part, been hurled from their  thrones, in which the once all-powerful ecclesiastical hierarchies of  Islam, and to a lesser extent those of Christianity, have been  discredited, and in which the virus of prejudice and corruption is eating  into the vitals of an already gravely disordered society. A Faith Whose  institutions--the pattern and crowning glory of the age which is to  come--have been ignored and in some instances trampled upon and uprooted,  Whose unfolding system has been derided and partly suppressed and  crippled, Whose rising Order--the sole refuge of a civilization in the  embrace of doom--has been spurned and challenged, Whose Mother-Temple has  been seized and misappropriated, and Whose \"House\"--the \"cynosure of an  adoring world\"--has, through a gross miscarriage of justice, as witnessed  by the world's highest tribunal, been delivered into the hands of, and  violated by, its implacable enemies.    We are indeed living in an age which, if we would correctly appraise it,  should be regarded as one which is witnessing a dual phenomenon. The first  signalizes the death pangs of an order, effete and godless, that has  stubbornly refused, despite the signs and portents of a century-old  Revelation, to attune its processes to the precepts and ideals which that  Heaven-sent Faith proffered it. The second proclaims the birth pangs of an  Order, divine and redemptive, that will inevitably supplant the former,  and within Whose administrative structure an embryonic civilization,  incomparable and world-embracing, is imperceptibly maturing. The one is  being rolled up, and is crashing in oppression, bloodshed, and ruin. The  other opens up vistas of a justice, a unity, a peace, a culture, such as  no age has ever seen. The former has spent its force, demonstrated its  falsity and barrenness, lost irretrievably its opportunity, and is  hurrying to its doom. The latter, virile and unconquerable, is plucking  asunder its chains, and is vindicating its title to be the one refuge  within which a sore-tried humanity, purged from its dross, can attain its  destiny.    \"Soon,\" Baha'u'llah Himself has prophesied, \"will the present-day order be  rolled up, and a new one spread out in its stead.\" And again: \"By Myself!  The day is approaching when We will have rolled up the world and all that  is therein, and spread out a new Order in its stead.\" \"The day is  approaching when God will have raised up a people who will call to  remembrance Our days, who will tell the tale of Our trials, who will  demand the restitution of Our rights, from them who, without a tittle of  evidence, have treated Us with manifest injustice.\"    Dear friends! For the trials which have afflicted the Faith of Baha'u'llah  a responsibility appalling and inescapable rests upon those into whose  hands the reins of civil and ecclesiastical authority were delivered. The  kings of the earth and the world's religious leaders alike must primarily  bear the brunt of such an awful responsibility. \"Everyone well knoweth,\"  Baha'u'llah Himself testifies, \"that all the kings have turned aside from  Him, and all the religions have opposed Him.\" \"From time immemorial,\" He  declares, \"they who have been outwardly invested with authority have  debarred men from setting their faces towards God. They have disliked that  men should gather together around the Most Great Ocean, inasmuch as they  have regarded, and still regard, such a gathering as the cause of, and the  motive for, the disruption of their sovereignty.\" \"The kings,\" He moreover  has written, \"have recognized that it was not in their interest to  acknowledge Me, as have likewise the ministers and the divines,  notwithstanding that My purpose hath been most explicitly revealed in the  Divine Books and Tablets, and the True One hath loudly proclaimed that  this Most Great Revelation hath appeared for the betterment of the world  and the exaltation of the nations.\" \"Gracious God!\" writes the Bab in the  Dala'il-i-Sab'ih (Seven Proofs) with reference to the \"seven powerful  sovereigns ruling the world\" in His day, \"None of them hath been informed  of His [the Bab's] Manifestation, and if informed, none hath believed in  Him. Who knoweth, they may leave this world below full of desire, and  without having realized that the thing for which they were waiting had  come to pass. This is what happened to the monarchs that held fast unto  the Gospel. They awaited the coming of the Prophet of God [Muhammad], and  when He did appear, they failed to recognize Him. Behold how great are the  sums which these sovereigns expend without even the slightest thought of  appointing an official charged with the task of acquainting them in their  own realms with the Manifestation of God! They would thereby have  fulfilled the purpose for which they have been created. All their desires  have been and are still fixed upon leaving behind them traces of their  names.\" The Bab, moreover, in that same treatise, censuring the failure of  the Christian divines to acknowledge the truth of Muhammad's mission,  makes this illuminating statement: \"The blame falleth upon their doctors,  for if these had believed, they would have been followed by the mass of  their countrymen. Behold then, that which hath come to pass! The learned  men of Christendom are held to be learned by virtue of their safeguarding  the teaching of Christ, and yet consider how they themselves have been the  cause of men's failure to accept the Faith and attain unto salvation!\"            RECIPIENTS OF THE MESSAGE      It should not be forgotten that it was the kings of the earth and the  world's religious leaders who, above all other categories of men, were  made the direct recipients of the Message proclaimed by both the Bab and  Baha'u'llah. It was they who were deliberately addressed in numerous and  historic Tablets, who were summoned to respond to the Call of God, and to  whom were directed, in clear and forcible language, the appeals, the  admonitions and warnings of His persecuted Messengers. It was they who,  when the Faith was born, and later when its mission was proclaimed, were  still, for the most part, wielding unquestioned and absolute civil and  ecclesiastical authority over their subjects and followers. It was they  who, whether glorying in the pomp and pageantry of a kingship as yet  scarcely restricted by constitutional limitations, or entrenched within  the strongholds of a seemingly inviolable ecclesiastical power, assumed  ultimate responsibility for any wrongs inflicted by those whose immediate  destinies they controlled. It would be no exaggeration to say that in most  of the countries of the European and Asiatic continents absolutism, on the  one hand, and complete subservience to ecclesiastical hierarchies, on the  other, were still the outstanding features of the political and religious  life of the masses. These, dominated and shackled, were robbed of the  necessary freedom that would enable them to either appraise the claims and  merits of the Message proffered to them, or to embrace unreservedly its  truth.    Small wonder, then, that the Author of the Baha'i Faith, and to a lesser  degree its Herald, should have directed at the world's supreme rulers and  religious leaders the full force of Their Messages, and made them the  recipients of some of Their most sublime Tablets, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19284"],[0,"Paris Talks (#5)"],[1,"God. By the Bounty of the Kingdom our  desires, our hearts, our spirits, are they not united in one bond? Our  prayers, are they not for the gathering together of all men in harmony?  Therefore are we not always together?    Yesterday evening when I came home from the house of Monsieur Dreyfus I  was very tired--yet I did not sleep, I lay awake thinking.    I said, O God, Here am I in Paris! What is Paris and who am I? Never did I  dream that from the darkness of my prison I should ever be able to come to  you, though when they read me my sentence I did not believe in it.    They told me that 'Abdu'l-Hamid had ordered my everlasting imprisonment,  and I said, 'This is impossible! I shall not always be a prisoner. If  'Abdu'l-Hamid were immortal, such a sentence might possibly be carried  out. It is certain that one day I shall be free. My body may be captive  for a time, but 'Abdu'l-Hamid has no power over my spirit--free it must  remain--that can no man imprison'.    Released from my prison by the Power of God I meet here the friends of  God, and I am thankful unto Him.    Let us spread the Cause of God, for which I suffered persecution.    What a privilege it is for us to meet here in freedom. How happy for us  that God has so decided that we may work together for the coming of the  Kingdom!    Are you pleased to receive such a guest, freed from his prison to bring  the glorious Message to you? He who never could have thought such a  meeting possible! Now by the Grace of God, by His wonderful Power, I, who  was condemned to perpetual imprisonment in a far off town of the East, am  here in Paris talking with you!    Henceforward we shall always be together, heart and soul and spirit,  pressing forward in the work till all men are gathered together under the  tent of the Kingdom, singing the songs of peace.          GOD'S GREATEST GIFT TO MAN      Thursday, October 26th    God's greatest gift to man is that of intellect, or understanding.    The understanding is the power by which man acquires his knowledge of the  several kingdoms of creation, and of various stages of existence, as well  as of much which is invisible.    Possessing this gift, he is, in himself, the sum of earlier creations--he  is able to get into touch with those kingdoms; and by this gift, he can  frequently, through his scientific knowledge, reach out with prophetic  vision.    Intellect is, in truth, the most precious gift bestowed upon man by the  Divine Bounty. Man alone, among created beings, has this wonderful power.    All creation, preceding Man, is bound by the stern law of nature. The  great sun, the multitudes of stars, the oceans and seas, the mountains,  the rivers, the trees, and all animals, great or small--none is able to  evade obedience to nature's law.    Man alone has freedom, and, by his understanding or intellect, has been  able to gain control of and adapt some of those natural laws to his own  needs. By the power of his intellect he has discovered means by which he  not only traverses great continents in express trains and crosses vast  oceans in ships, but, like the fish he travels under water in submarines,  and, imitating the birds, he flies through the air in airships.    Man has succeeded in using electricity in several ways--for light, for  motive power, for sending messages from one end of the earth to the  other--and by electricity he can even hear a voice many miles away!    By this gift of understanding or intellect he has also been able to use  the rays of the sun to picture people and things, and even to capture the  form of distant heavenly bodies.    We perceive in what numerous ways man has been able to bend the powers of  nature to his will.    How grievous it is to see how man has used his God-given gift to frame  instruments of war, for breaking the Commandment of God 'Thou shalt not  kill', and for defying Christ's injunction to 'Love one another'.    God gave this power to man that it might be used for the advancement of  civilization, for the good of humanity, to increase love and concord and  peace. But man prefers to use this gift to destroy instead of to build,  for injustice and oppression, for hatred and discord and devastation, for  the destruction of his fellow-creatures, whom Christ has commanded that he  should love as himself!    I hope that you will use your understanding to promote the unity and  tranquillity of mankind, to give enlightenment and civilization to the  people, to produce love in all around you, and to bring about the  universal peace.    Study the sciences, acquire more and more knowledge. Assuredly one may  learn to the end of one's life! Use your knowledge always for the benefit  of others; so may war cease on the face of this beautiful earth, and a  glorious edifice of peace and concord be raised. Strive that your high  ideals may be realized in the Kingdom of God on earth, as they will be in  Heaven.          THE CLOUDS THAT OBSCURE THE SUN OF TRUTH      4 Avenue de Camoeens,  Morning of Friday, October 27th    The day is fine, the air is pure, the sun shines, no mist nor cloud  obscures its radiance.    These brilliant rays penetrate into all parts of the city; so may the Sun  of Truth illumine the minds of men.    Christ said, 'They shall see the Son of Man coming in the clouds of  Heaven'.(2) Baha'u'llah said, 'When Christ came for the first time He came  upon the clouds'.(3) Christ said that He had come from the sky, from  Heaven--that He came forth from God--while He was born of Mary, His Mother.  But when He declared that He had come from Heaven, it is clear that He did  not mean the blue firmament but that He spoke of the Heaven of the Kingdom  of God, and that from this Heaven He descended upon the clouds. As clouds  are obstacles to the shining of the sun, so the clouds of the world of  humanity hid from the eyes of men the radiance of the Divinity of Christ.    Men said, 'He is of Nazareth, born of Mary, we know Him and we know his  brethren. What can He mean? What is He saying? That He came forth from  God?'    The Body of Christ was born of Mary of Nazareth, but the Spirit was of  God. The capacities of His human body were limited but the strength of His  spirit was vast, infinite, immeasurable.    Men asked, 'Why does He say He is of God?' If they had understood the  reality of Christ, they would have known that the body of His humanity was  a cloud that hid His Divinity. The world only saw His human form, and  therefore wondered how He could have 'come down from Heaven'.    Baha'u'llah said, 'Even as the clouds hide the sun and the sky from our  gaze, even so did the humanity of Christ hide from men His real Divine  character'.    I hope that you will turn with unclouded eyes towards the Sun of Truth,  beholding not the things of earth, lest your hearts be attracted to the  worthless and passing pleasures of the world; let that Sun give you of His  strength, then will not the clouds of prejudice veil His illumination from  your eyes! Then will the Sun be without clouds for you.    Breathe the air of purity. May you each and all share in the Divine  Bounties of the Kingdom of Heaven. May the world be for you no obstacle  hiding the truth from your sight, as the human body of Christ hid His  Divinity from the people of His day. May you receive the clear vision of  the Holy Spirit, so that your hearts may be illumined and able to  recognize the Sun of Truth shining through all material clouds, His  splendour flooding the universe.    Let not the things of the body obscure the celestial light of the spirit,  so that, by the Divine Bounty, you may enter with the children of God into  His Eternal Kingdom.    This is my prayer for you all.          RELIGIOUS PREJUDICES      October 27th    The basis of the teaching of Baha'u'llah is the Unity of Mankind, and his  greatest desire was that love and goodwill should live in the heart of  men.    As He exhorted the people to do away with strife and discord, so I wish to  explain to you the principal reason of the unrest among nations. The chief  cause is the misrepresentation of religion by the religious leaders and  teachers. They teach their followers to believe that their own form of  religion is the only one pleasing to God, and that followers of any other  persuasion are condemned by the All-Loving Father and deprived of His  Mercy and Grace. Hence arise among the peoples, disapproval, contempt,  disputes and hatred. If these religious prejudices could be swept away,  the nations would soon enjoy peace and concord.    I was once at Tiberias where the Jews have a Temple. I was staying in a  house just opposite the Temple, and there I saw and heard a Rabbi speaking  to his congregation of Jews, and he spoke thus:    'O Jews, you are in truth the people of God! All other races and religions  are of the devil. God has created you the descendants of Abraham, and He  has showered His blessings upon you. Unto you God sent Moses, Jacob and  Joseph, and many other great prophets. These prophets, one and all, were  of your race.    'It was for you that God broke the power of Pharaoh and caused the Red Sea  to dry up; to you also He sent manna from above to be your food, and out  of the stony rock did He give you water to quench your thirst. You are  indeed the chosen people of God, you are above all the races of the earth!  Therefore, all other races are abhorrent to God, and condemned by Him. In  truth you will govern and subdue the world, and all men shall become your  slaves.    'Do not profane yourselves by consorting with people who are not of your  own religion, make not friends of such men.'    When the Rabbi had finished his eloquent discourse, his hearers were  filled with joy and satisfaction. It is impossible to describe to you  their happiness!    Alas! It is misguided ones like these who are the cause of division and  hatred upon earth. Today there are millions of people who still worship  idols, and the "]]]
