Then they took leave of each other; and the  Princess put the napkin in her bosom, got on her horse, and set out to  go to the bridegroom. After she had ridden an hour, she began to feel  very thirsty, and she said to the waiting-woman,    \"Get down, and fill my cup that you are carrying with water from the  brook; I have great desire to drink.\"    \"Get down yourself,\" said the waiting-woman, \"and if you are thirsty  stoop down and drink; I will not be your slave.\"    [Illustration: GOOSE GIRL        'O WIND, BLOW CONRAD'S HAT AWAY,      AND MAKE HIM FOLLOW AS IT FLIES,      WHILE I WITH MY GOLD HAIR WILL PLAY      AND BIND IT UP IN SEEMLY WISE.' ]    And as her thirst was so great, the Princess had to get down and to  stoop and drink of the water of the brook, and could not have her gold  cup to serve her. \"Oh dear!\" said the poor Princess. And the three drops  of blood heard her, and said,    \"If your mother knew of this, it would break her heart.\"    But the Princess answered nothing, and quietly mounted her horse again.  So they rode on some miles farther; the day was warm, the sun shone hot,  and the Princess grew thirsty once more. And when they came to a  water-course she called again to the waiting-woman and said,    \"Get down, and give me to drink out of my golden cup.\" For she had  forgotten all that had gone before. But the waiting-woman spoke still  more scornfully and said,    \"If you want a drink, you may get it yourself; I am not going to be your  slave.\"    So, as her thirst was so great, the Princess had to get off her horse  and to stoop towards the running water to drink, and as she stooped, she  wept and said, \"Oh dear!\" And the three drops of blood heard her and  answered,    \"If your mother knew of this, it would break her heart!\"    And as she drank and stooped over, the napkin on which were the three  drops of blood fell out of her bosom and floated down the stream, and in  her distress she never noticed it; not so the waiting-woman, who  rejoiced because she should have power over the bride, who, now that she  had lost the three drops of blood, had become weak, and unable to defend  herself. And when she was going to mount her horse again the  waiting-woman cried,    \"Falada belongs to me, and this jade to you.\" And the Princess had to  give way and let it be as she said. Then the waiting-woman ordered the  Princess with many hard words to take off her rich clothing and to put  on her plain garments, and then she made her swear to say nothing of the  matter when they came to the royal court; threatening to take her life  if she refused. And all the while Falada noticed and remembered.    The waiting-woman then mounting Falada, and the Princess the sorry jade,  they journeyed on till they reached the royal castle. There was great  joy at their coming, and the King's son hastened to meet them, and  lifted the waiting woman from her horse, thinking she was his bride; and  then he led her up the stairs, while the real Princess had to remain  below. But the old King, who was looking out of the window, saw her  standing in the yard, and noticed how delicate and gentle and beautiful  she was, and then he went down and asked the seeming bride who it was  that she had brought with her and that was now standing in the  courtyard.    \"Oh!\" answered the bride, \"I only brought her with me for company; give  the maid something to do, that she may not be for ever standing idle.\"    But the old King had no work to give her; until he bethought him of a  boy he had who took care of the geese, and that she might help him. And  so the real Princess was sent to keep geese with the goose-boy, who was  called Conrad.    Soon after the false bride said to the Prince,    \"Dearest husband, I pray thee do me a pleasure.\"    \"With all my heart,\" answered he.    \"Then\" said she, \"send for the knacker, that he may carry off the horse  I came here upon, and make away with him; he was very troublesome to me  on the journey.\" For she was afraid that the horse might tell how she  had behaved to the Princess. And when the order had been given that  Falada should die, it came to the Princess's ears, and she came to the  knacker's man secretly, and promised him a piece of gold if he would do  her a service. There was in the town a great dark gate-way through which  she had to pass morning and evening with her geese, and she asked the  man to take Falada's head and to nail it on the gate, that she might  always see it as she passed by. And the man promised, and he took  Falada's head and nailed it fast in the dark gate-way.    Early next morning as she and Conrad drove their geese through the gate,  she said as she went by,        \"O Falada, dost thou hang there?\"    And the head answered,        \"Princess, dost thou so meanly fare?      But if thy mother knew thy pain,      Her heart would surely break in twain.\"    But she went on through the town, driving her geese to the field. And  when they came into the meadows, she sat down and undid her hair, which  was all of gold, and when Conrad saw how it glistened, he wanted to pull  out a few hairs for himself. And she said,        \"O wind, blow Conrad's hat away,      Make him run after as it flies,      While I with my gold hair will play,      And twist it up in seemly wise.\"    Then there came a wind strong enough to blow Conrad's hat far away over  the fields, and he had to run after it; and by the time he came back she  had put up her hair with combs and pins, and he could not get at any to  pull it out; and he was sulky and would not speak to her; so they looked  after the geese until the evening came, and then they went home.    The next morning, as they passed under the dark gate-way, the Princess  said,        \"O Falada, dost thou hang there?\"    And Falada answered,        \"Princess, dost thou so meanly fare?      But if thy mother knew thy pain,      Her heart would surely break in twain.\"    And when they reached the fields she sat down and began to comb out her  hair; then Conrad came up and wanted to seize upon some of it, and she  cried,        \"O wind, blow Conrad's hat away,      Make him run after as it flies,      While I with my gold hair will play,      And do it up in seemly wise.\"    Then the wind came and blew Conrad's hat very far away, so that he had  to run after it, and when he came back again her hair was put up again,  so that he could pull none of it out; and they tended the geese until  the evening.    And after they had got home, Conrad went to the old King and said, \"I  will tend the geese no longer with that girl!\"    \"Why not?\" asked the old King.    \"Because she vexes me the whole day long,\" answered Conrad. Then the old  King ordered him to tell how it was.    \"Every morning,\" said Conrad, \"as we pass under the dark gate-way with  the geese, there is an old horse's head hanging on the wall, and she  says to it,        \"O Falada, dost thou hang there?\"    And the head answers,        \"Princess, dost thou so meanly fare?      But if thy mother knew thy pain,      Her heart would surely break in twain.\"    And besides this, Conrad related all that happened in the fields, and  how he was obliged to run after his hat.    The old King told him to go to drive the geese next morning as usual,  and he himself went behind the gate and listened how the maiden spoke to  Falada; and then he followed them into the fields, and hid himself  behind a bush; and he watched the goose-boy and the goose-girl tend the  geese; and after a while he saw the girl make her hair all loose, and  how it gleamed and shone. Soon she said,        \"O wind, blow Conrad's hat away,      And make him follow as it flies,      While I with my gold hair will play,      And bind it up in seemly wise.\"    Then there came a gust of wind and away went Conrad's hat, and he after  it, while the maiden combed and bound up her hair; and the old King saw  all that went on. At last he went unnoticed away, and when the  goose-girl came back in the evening he sent for her, and asked the  reason of her doing all this.    \"That I dare not tell you,\" she answered, \"nor can I tell any man of my  woe, for when I was in danger of my life I swore an oath not to reveal  it.\" And he pressed her sore, and left her no peace, but he could get  nothing out of her. At last he said,    \"If you will not tell it me, tell it to the iron oven,\" and went away.  Then she crept into the iron oven, and began to weep and to lament, and  at last she opened her heart and said,    \"Here I sit forsaken of all the world, and I am a King's daughter, and a  wicked waiting-woman forced me to give up my royal garments and my place  at the bridegroom's side, and I am made a goose-girl, and have to do  mean service. And if my mother knew, it would break her heart.\"    Now the old King was standing outside by the oven-door listening, and he  heard all she said, and he called to her and told her to come out of the  oven. And he caused royal clothing to be put upon her, and it was a  marvel to see how beautiful she was. The old King then called his son  and proved to him that he had the wrong bride, for she was really only a  waiting-woman, and that the true bride was here at hand, she who had  been the goose-girl. The Prince was glad at heart when he saw her beauty  and gentleness; and a great feast was made ready, and all the court  people and good friends were bidden to it. The bridegroom sat in the  midst with the Princess on one side and the waiting-woman on the other;  and the false bride did not know the true one, because she was dazzled  with her glittering braveries. When all the company had eaten and drunk  and were merry, the old King gave the waiting-woman a question to  answer, as to what such an one deserved, who had deceived her masters in  such and such a manner, telling the whole story, and ending by asking,    \"Now, what doom does such an one deserve?\"    \"No better than this,\" answered "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19090"],[0,"Star Hunter (#5)"],[1," to  alien emotion.    Making contact stealthily, but with confidence, it explored after its  own fashion. Then, puzzled, it withdrew to report. And since that to  which it reported was governed by a set pattern which had not been  altered for eons, its only answer was a basic command reaffirmed.  Again it made contact, strove to carry out that order fruitlessly.  Where it should have found easy passage, a clear channel to carry  influence to the sleeper's brain, it found a jumble of impressions,  interwoven until they made a protective barrier.    The invader strove to find some pattern, or meaning--withdrew baffled.  But its invasion, as ghostly as that had been, loosened a knot here,  cleared a passage there.    Rynch awoke at dawn, slowly, dazedly, sorting out sounds, smells,  thoughts. There was a room, a man, trouble and fear, then there was  he, Rynch Brodie, who had lived in this wilderness on an unmapped  frontier world for the passage of many seasons. That world was about  him now, he could feel its winds, hear its sounds, taste, smell. It  was not a dream--the other was the dream. It had to be!    Prove it. Find the L-B, retrace the trail of yesterday past the point  of the fall which had started all this. Right there was the slope down  which he must have tumbled. Above, he would find the den he had been  exploring when the accident had occurred.    Only--he did not find it. His mind had produced a detailed picture of  that rounded depression, at the bottom of which the strong-jaw lurked.  But when he reached the crown of the bluff, nowhere did he sight the  mounded earth of the pit's rim. He searched carefully for a good  length, both north and south. No den--no trace of one. Yet his memory  told him that there had been one here yesterday.    Had he fallen elsewhere and stumbled on, dazed, to fall a second time?    Some disputant inside him said no to that. This was where he had  regained consciousness yesterday and there was no den!    He faced away from the river, breathing fast. No den--was there also  no L-B? If he had passed this way dazed from a former fall, surely he  would have left some trace.    There was a crushed, browned plant flattened by weight. He stooped to  finger the wilted leaves. Something had come in this direction. He  would back-track. Rynch gave a hunter's attention to the ground.    A half-hour later he found nothing but some odd, almost obliterated  marks on grass too resilient to hold traces very long. And from them  he could make nothing.    He knew where he was, even if he did not know how he got here. The  L-B--if it did exist--was to the west. He had a vivid mental picture  of the rocket shape, its once silvery sides dulled by exposure, canted  crookedly amid trees. And he was going to find it!    Beyond the edge of any conscious sense there was a new stir. He was  contacted again, tested. A forest called delicately in its alien way.  Rynch had a fleeting thought of trees, was not aware of more than a  mild desire to see what lay in their shade.    For the present his own problem held him. That which beckoned was  defeated, repulsed by his indifference. While Rynch started at a  steady distance to trot towards the east, far away a process akin to a  relay clicked into a second set of impulse orders.           *       *       *       *       *    Well above the planet Hume spun a dial to bring in the image of the  wide stretches of continents, the small patches of seas. They would  set down on the western land mass. Its climate, geographical features  and surface provided the best site. And he had the very important  co-ordinates for their camp already taped in the directo.    \"That's Jumala.\"    He did not glance around to see what effect that screen view had on  the other four men in the control cabin of the safari ship. Just now  he was striving to master his impatience. The slightest hint could  give birth to a suspicion which would blast their whole scheme. Wass  might have had a hand in the selection of the three clients, but they  would certainly be far from briefed on the truth of any discovery made  on Jumala--they had to be for the safety of the whole enterprise.    The fourth man, serving as his gearman for this trip, was Wass' own  insurance against any wrong move on Hume's part. And the Out-Hunter  respected him as being man enough to be wary of giving any suspicion  of going counter to the agreed plan.    Dawn was touching up the main points of the western continent, and he  must set this spacer down within a day's journey of the abandoned L-B.  Exploration in that direction would be the first logical move for his  party. They could not be openly steered to the find, but there were  ways of directing a hunt which would do as well.    Two days ago, according to schedule, their castaway had been deposited  here with a sub-conscious command to remain in the general area. There  had been a slight element of risk in leaving him alone, armed only  with the crude weapons he could manipulate, but that was part of the  gamble.    They were down--right on the mark. Hume saw to the unpacking and  activating of those machines and appliances which would protect and  serve his civ clients. He slapped the last inflate valve on a bubble  tent, watched it critically as it billowed from a small roll of fabric  into a weather resistant, one-room, air-conditioned and heated  shelter.    \"Ready and waiting for you to move in, Gentlehomo,\" he reported to the  small man who stood gazing about him with a child's wondering interest  in the new and strange.    \"Very ingenious, Hunter. Ah--now just what might that be?\" His voice  was also eager as he pointed a finger to the east.          4      Hume glanced up alertly. There was a bare chance that \"Brodie\" might  have witnessed their arrival and might be coming in now to save them  all a great amount of time and trouble by acting the overjoyed,  rescued castaway.    But he could sight nothing at all in that direction to excite any  attention. The distant mountains provided a stark, dark blue  background. Up their foothills and lower slopes was a thick furring  of trees with foliage of so deep a green as to register black from  this distance. And on the level country was the lighter blue-green of  the other variety of wood edging the open country about the river. In  there rested the L-B.    \"I don't see anything!\" he snapped, so sharply the little man stared  at him in open surprise. Hume forced a quick smile.    \"Just what did you sight, Gentlehomo Starns? There is no large game in  the woodlands.\"    \"This was not an animal, Hunter. Rather a flash of light, just about  there.\" Again he pointed.    Sun, Hume thought, could have been reflected from some portion of the  L-B. He had believed that small spacer so covered with vines and  ringed in by trees that it could not have been so sighted. But a storm  might have disposed of some of nature's cloaking. If so Starns'  interest must be fed, he would make an ideal discoverer.    \"Odd.\" Hume produced his distance glasses. \"Just where, Gentlehomo?\"    \"There.\" Starns obligingly pointed a third time.    If there had been anything to see it was gone now. But it did lie in  the right direction. For a second or two Hume was uneasy. Things  seemed to be working too well; his cynical distrust was triggered by  fitting so smoothly.    \"Might be the sun,\" he observed.    \"Reflected from some object you mean, Hunter? But the flash was very  bright. And there could be no mirror surface in there, surely there  could not be?\"    Yes, things were moving too fast. Hume might be overly cautious but he  was determined that no hint of any pre-knowledge of the L-B must ever  come to these civs. When they would find the Largo Drift's life boat  and locate Brodie, there would be a legal snarl. The castaway's  identity would be challenged by a half dozen distant and unloving  relatives, and there would be an intense inquiry. These civs must be  the impartial witnesses.    \"No, I hardly believe in a mirror in an uninhabited forest,  Gentlehomo,\" he chuckled. \"But we are on a hunting planet and not all  its life forms have yet been classified.\"    \"You are thinking of an intelligent native race, Hunter?\" Chambriss,  the most demanding of the civ party, strode up to join them.    Hume shook his head. \"No native intelligence on a hunting world,  Gentlehomo. That is assured before the planet is listed for a safari.  However, a bird or flying thing, perhaps with metallic plumage or  scales to catch the sunlight, might under the right circumstances seem  a flash of light. That has happened before.\"    \"It was _very_ bright,\" Starns said doubtfully. \"We might look over  there later.\"    \"Nonsense!\" Chambriss spoke briskly as one used to overriding the  conflicting wishes in any company. \"I came here for a water-cat, and a  water-cat I'm going to have. You don't find those in wooded areas.\"    \"There will be a schedule,\" Hume announced. \"Each of you has signed  up, according to contract, for a different trophy. You for a  water-cat, Gentlehomo. And you, Gentlehomo Starns, want to make  tri-dees of the pit-dragons. While Gentlehomo Yactisi wishes to try  electo fishing in the deep holes. To alternate days is the fair way.  And, who knows, each of you may discover your own choice near the  other man's stake out.\"    \"You are quite right, Hunter,\" Starns nodded. \"And since my two  colleagues have chosen to try for a water creature, perhaps we should  start along the river.\"    It was two days, then, before they could work their way into the  woods. One part of Hume protested, the more cautious section of his  mind was appeased. He saw, beyond the three clients now turning over  and sorting space bags, Wass' man glanced at the woods and then back  to Starns. And, being acutely aware of all undercurrents here, Hume  wondered what the small civ had actually seen.    The camp was complete, a cluster of seven bubble"]]]
