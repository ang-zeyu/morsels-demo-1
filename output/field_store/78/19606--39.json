A common mind usually stoops, in plastic chill, to whatever  is asked of it, and scrapes or daubs its way complacently into public  favour.[5] But your great men quarrel with you, and you revenge  yourselves by starving them for the first half of their lives. Precisely  in the degree in which any painter possesses original genius, is at  present the increase of moral certainty that during his early years he  will have a hard battle to fight; and that just at the time when his  conceptions ought to be full and happy, his temper gentle, and his  hopes enthusiastic--just at that most critical period, his heart is full  of anxieties and household cares; he is chilled by disappointments, and  vexed by injustice; he becomes obstinate in his errors, no less than in  his virtues, and the arrows of his aims are blunted, as the reeds of his  trust are broken.    [Note 5: See note 4th, in Addenda.]      24. What we mainly want, therefore, is a means of sufficient and  unagitated employment: not holding out great prizes for which young  painters are to scramble; but furnishing all with adequate support, and  opportunity to display such power as they possess without rejection or  mortification. I need not say that the best field of labour of this kind  would be presented by the constant progress of public works involving  various decoration; and we will presently examine what kind of public  works may thus, advantageously for the nation, be in constant progress.  But a more important matter even than this of steady employment, is the  kind of criticism with which you, the public, receive the works of the  young men submitted to you. You may do much harm by indiscreet praise  and by indiscreet blame; but remember the chief harm is always done by  blame. It stands to reason that a young man's work cannot be perfect. It  _must_ be more or less ignorant; it must be more or less feeble; it is  likely that it may be more or less experimental, and if experimental,  here and there mistaken. If, therefore, you allow yourself to launch out  into sudden barking at the first faults you see, the probability is that  you are abusing the youth for some defect naturally and inevitably  belonging to that stage of his progress; and that you might just as  rationally find fault with a child for not being as prudent as a privy  councillor, or with a kitten for not being as grave as a cat.      25. But there is one fault which you may be quite sure is unnecessary,  and therefore a real and blamable fault: that is haste, involving  negligence. Whenever you see that a young man's work is either bold or  slovenly, then you may attack it firmly; sure of being right. If his  work is bold, it is insolent; repress his insolence: if it is slovenly,  it is indolent; spur his indolence. So long as he works in that dashing  or impetuous way, the best hope for him is in your contempt: and it is  only by the fact of his seeming not to seek your approbation that you  may conjecture he deserves it.      26. But if he does deserve it, be sure that you give it him, else you  not only run a chance of driving him from the right road by want of  encouragement, but you deprive yourselves of the happiest privilege you  will ever have of rewarding his labour. For it is only the young who can  receive much reward from men's praise: the old, when they are great, get  too far beyond and above you to care what you think of them. You may  urge them then with sympathy, and surround them then with acclamation;  but they will doubt your pleasure, and despise your praise. You might  have cheered them in their race through the asphodel meadows of their  youth; you might have brought the proud, bright scarlet into their  faces, if you had but cried once to them \"Well done,\" as they dashed up  to the first goal of their early ambition. But now, their pleasure is in  memory, and their ambition is in heaven. They can be kind to you, but  you nevermore can be kind to them. You may be fed with the fruit and  fulness of their old age, but you were as the nipping blight to them in  their blossoming, and your praise is only as the warm winds of autumn  to the dying branches.      27. There is one thought still, the saddest of all, bearing on this  withholding of early help. It is possible, in some noble natures, that  the warmth and the affections of childhood may remain unchilled, though  unanswered; and that the old man's heart may still be capable of  gladness, when the long-withheld sympathy is given at last. But in these  noble natures it nearly always happens that the chief motive of earthly  ambition has not been to give delight to themselves, but to their  parents. Every noble youth looks back, as to the chiefest joy which this  world's honour ever gave him, to the moment when first he saw his  father's eyes flash with pride, and his mother turn away her head, lest  he should take her tears for tears of sorrow. Even the lover's joy, when  some worthiness of his is acknowledged before his mistress, is not so  great as that, for it is not so pure--the desire to exalt himself in her  eyes mixes with that of giving her delight; but he does not need to  exalt himself in his parents' eyes: it is with the pure hope of giving  them pleasure that he comes to tell them what he has done, or what has  been said of him; and therefore he has a purer pleasure of his own. And  this purest and best of rewards you keep from him if you can: you feed  him in his tender youth with ashes and dishonour; and then you come to  him, obsequious, but too late, with your sharp laurel crown, the dew all  dried from off its leaves; and you thrust it into his languid hand, and  he looks at you wistfully. What shall he do with it? What can he do, but  go and lay it on his mother's grave?      28. Thus, then, you see that you have to provide for your young men:  first, the searching or discovering school; then the calm employment;  then the justice of praise: one thing more you have to do for them in  preparing them for full service--namely, to make, in the noble sense of  the word, gentlemen of them; that is to say, to take care that their  minds receive such training, that in all they paint they shall see and  feel the noblest things. I am sorry to say, that of all parts of an  artist's education, this is the most neglected among us; and that even  where the natural taste and feeling of the youth have been pure and  true, where there was the right stuff in him to make a gentleman of, you  may too frequently discern some jarring rents in his mind, and elements  of degradation in his treatment of subject, owing to want of gentle  training, and of the liberal influence of literature. This is quite  visible in our greatest artists, even in men like Turner and  Gainsborough; while in the common grade of our second-rate painters the  evil attains a pitch which is far too sadly manifest to need my dwelling  upon it. Now, no branch of art economy is more important than that of  making the intellect at your disposal pure as well as powerful; so that  it may always gather for you the sweetest and fairest things. The same  quantity of labour from the same man's hand, will, according as you have  trained him, produce a lovely and useful work, or a base and hurtful  one; and depend upon it, whatever value it may possess, by reason of the  painter's skill, its chief and final value, to any nation, depends upon  its being able to exalt and refine, as well as to please; and that the  picture which most truly deserves the name of an art-treasure is that  which has been painted by a good man.      29. You cannot but see how far this would lead, if I were to enlarge  upon it. I must take it up as a separate subject some other time: only  noticing at present that no money could be better spent by a nation than  in providing a liberal and disciplined education for its painters, as  they advance into the critical period of their youth; and that, also, a  large part of their power during life depends upon the kind of subjects  which you, the public, ask them for, and therefore the kind of thoughts  with which you require them to be habitually familiar. I shall have more  to say on this head when we come to consider what employment they should  have in public buildings.      30. There are many other points of nearly as much importance as these,  to be explained with reference to the development of genius; but I  should have to ask you to come and hear six lectures instead of two if I  were to go into their detail. For instance, I have not spoken of the way  in which you ought to look for those artificers in various manual  trades, who, without possessing the order of genius which you would  desire to devote to higher purposes, yet possess wit, and humour, and  sense of colour, and fancy for form--all commercially valuable as  quantities of intellect, and all more or less expressible in the lower  arts of iron-work, pottery, decorative sculpture, and such like. But  these details, interesting as they are, I must commend to your own  consideration, or leave for some future inquiry. I want just now only to  set the bearings of the entire subject broadly before you, with enough  of detailed illustration to make it intelligible; and therefore I must  quit the first head of it here, and pass to the second--namely, how best  to employ the genius we discover. A certain quantity of able hands and  heads being placed at our disposal, what shall we most advisably set  them upon?      31. II. APPLICATION.--There are three main points the economist has to  attend to in this.    First, To set his men to various work.    Secondly, To easy work.    Thirdly, To lasting work.    I shall briefly touch on the first two, for I want to arrest your  attention on the last.      32. I say first to various work.

It behooves,  therefore, the American builder to examine well his premises, to  ascertain the actual requirements of his farm or plantation, in  convenience and accommodation, and build only to such extent, and at  such cost as shall not impoverish his means, nor cause him future  disquietude.    Another difficulty with us is, that we oftener build to gratify the eyes  of the public than our own, and fit up our dwellings to accommodate  \"company\" or visitors, rather than our own families; and in the  indulgence of this false notion, subject ourselves to perpetual  inconvenience for the gratification of occasional hospitality or  ostentation. This is all wrong. A house should be planned and  constructed for the use of the household, with _incidental_  accommodation for our immediate friends or guests--which can always be  done without sacrifice to the comfort or convenience of the regular  inmates. In this remark, a stinted and parsimonious spirit is not  suggested. A liberal appropriation of rooms in every department; a spare  chamber or two, or an additional room on the ground floor, looking to a  possible increase of family, and the indulgence of an easy hospitality,  should always govern the resident of the country in erecting his  dwelling. The enjoyments of society and the intercourse of friends,  sharing for the time, our own table and fireside, is a crowning pleasure  of country life; and all this may be done without extraordinary expense,  in a wise construction of the dwelling.    The farm house too, should comport in character and area with the extent  and capacity of the farm itself, and the main design for which it is  erected. To the farmer proper--he who lives from the income which the  farm produces--it is important to know the extent of accommodation  required for the economical management of his estate, and then to build  in accordance with it, as well as to suit his own position in life, and  the station which he and his family hold in society. The owner of a  hundred acre farm, living upon the income he receives from it, will  require less house room than he who tills equally well his farm of  three, six, or ten hundred acres. Yet the numbers in their respective  families, the relative position of each in society, or their taste for  social intercourse may demand a larger or smaller household arrangement,  regardless of the size of their estates; still, the dwellings on each  should bear, in extent and expense, a consistent relation to the land  itself, and the means of its owner. For instance: a farm of one hundred  acres may safely and economically erect and maintain a house costing  eight hundred to two thousand dollars, while one of five hundred to a  thousand acres may range in an expenditure of twenty-five hundred to  five thousand dollars in its dwelling, and all be consistent with a  proper economy in farm management.    Let it be understood, that the above sums are named as simply comporting  with a financial view of the subject, and such as the economical  management of the estate may warrant. To one who has no regard to such  consideration, this rule of expenditure will not apply. He may invest  any amount he so chooses in building beyond, if he only be content to  pocket the loss which he can never expect to be returned in an increased  value to the property, over and above the price of cheaper buildings. On  the other hand, he would do well to consider that a farm is frequently  worth less to an ordinary purchaser, with an extravagant house upon it,  than with an economical one, and in many cases will bring even less in  market, in proportion as the dwelling is expensive. _Fancy_ purchasers  are few, and fastidious, while he who buys only for a home and an  occupation, is governed solely by the profitable returns the estate will  afford upon the capital invested.    There is again a grand error which many fall into in building, looking  as they do only at the extent of wood and timber; or stone and mortar in  the structure, and paying no attention to the surroundings, which in  most cases contribute more to the effect of the establishment than the  structure itself, and which, if uncultivated or neglected, any amount of  expenditure in building will fail to give that completeness and  perfection of character which every homestead should command. Thus the  tawdry erections in imitation of a cast-off feudalism in Europe, or a  copying of the massive piles of more recent date abroad, although in  miniature, both in extent and cost, is the sheerest affectation, in  which no sensible man should ever indulge. It is out of all keeping, or  propriety with other things, as we in this country have them, and the  indulgence of all such fancies is sooner or later regretted. Substance,  convenience, purpose, harmony--all, perhaps, better summed up in the  term EXPRESSION--these are the objects which should govern the  construction of our dwellings and out-buildings, and in their observance  we can hardly err in the acquisition of what will promote the highest  enjoyment which a dwelling can bestow.          POSITION.      The site of a dwelling should be an important study with every country  builder; for on this depends much of its utility, and in addition to  that, a large share of the enjoyment which its occupation will afford.  Custom, in many parts of the United States, in the location of the farm  buildings, gives advantages which are denied in others. In the south,  and in the slave states generally, the planter builds, regardless of  roads, on the most convenient site his plantation presents; the farmer  of German descent, in Pennsylvania and some other states, does the same:  while the Yankee, be he settled where he will, either in the east,  north, or west, inexorably huddles himself immediately upon the highway,  whether his possessions embrace both sides of it or not, disregarding  the facilities of access to his fields, the convenience of tilling his  crops, or the character of the ground which his buildings may occupy,  seeming to have no other object than proximity to the road--as if his  chief business was upon that, instead of its being simply a convenience  to his occupation. To the last, but little choice is left; and so long  as a close connection with the thoroughfare is to control, he is obliged  to conform to accident in what should be a matter of deliberate choice  and judgment. Still, there are right and wrong positions for a house,  which it is necessary to discuss, regardless of conventional rules, and  they should be considered in the light of propriety alone.    A fitness to the purposes for which the dwelling is constructed should,  unquestionably, be the governing point in determining its position. The  site should be dry, and slightly declining, if possible, on every side;  but if the surface be level, or where water occasionally flows from  contiguous grounds, or on a soil naturally damp, it should be thoroughly  drained of all superfluous moisture. That is indispensable to the  preservation of the house itself, and the health of its inmates. The  house should so stand as to present an agreeable aspect from the main  points at which it is seen, or the thoroughfares by which it is  approached. It should be so arranged as to afford protection from wind  and storm, to that part most usually occupied, as well as be easy of  access to the out-buildings appended to it. It should have an  unmistakable front, sides, and rear; and the uses to which its various  parts are applied, should distinctly appear in its outward character.  It should combine all the advantages of soil, cultivation, water, shade,  and shelter, which the most liberal gratification, consistent with the  circumstances of the owner, may demand. If a site on the estate command  a prospect of singular beauty, other things equal, the dwelling should  embrace it; if the luxury of a stream, or a sheet of water in repose,  present itself, it should, if possible, be enjoyed; if the shade and  protection of a grove be near, its benefits should be included; in fine,  any object in itself desirable, and not embarrassing to the main  purposes of the dwelling and its appendages, should be turned to the  best account, and appropriated in such manner as to combine all that is  desirable both in beauty and effect, as well as in utility, to make up a  perfect whole in the family residence.    Attached to the building site should be considered the quality of the  soil, as affording cultivation and growth to shrubbery and trees,--at  once the ornament most effective to all domestic buildings, grateful to  the eye always, as objects of admiration and beauty--delightful in the  repose they offer in hours of lassitude or weariness; and to them, that  indispensable feature in a perfect arrangement, the garden, both fruit  and vegetable, should be added. Happily for the American, our soils are  so universally adapted to the growth of vegetation in all its varieties,  that hardly a farm of considerable size can be found which does not  afford tolerable facilities for the exercise of all the taste which one  may indulge in the cultivation of the garden as well as in the planting  and growth of trees and shrubbery; and a due appropriation of these to  an agreeable residence is equal in importance to the style and  arrangement of the house itself.    The site selected for the dwelling, and the character of the scenery and  objects immediately surrounding it, should have a controlling influence  upon the style in which the house is to be constructed. A fitness and  harmony in all these is indispensable to both expression and effect. And  in their determination, a single object should not control, but the  entire picture, as completed, should be embraced in the view; and that  style of building constituting the most agreeable whole, as filling the  eye with the most grateful sensations, should be the one"]]]
