At his  meals he broke in pieces all the dishes, set them down as lightly as he  would; and putting a leg out of bed when he rose, it was a common thing  for him to push off the top of the lodge.    He wanted more elbow-room; and after a short stay, in which, by the  accidentally letting go of his strength, he had nearly laid waste the  whole place, and filled it with demolished lodges and broken pottery,  and one-armed men, he made up his mind to go further, taking with him a  young man who had formed a strong attachment for him, and who might  serve him as his pipe-bearer; for Grasshopper was a huge smoker, and  vast clouds followed him wherever he went; so that people could say,  \"Grasshopper is coming!\" by the mighty smoke he raised.    They set out together, and when his companion was fatigued with walking,  Grasshopper would put him forward on his journey a mile or two by giving  him a cast in the air, and lighting him in a soft place among the trees,  or in a cool spot in a water-pond, among the sedges and water-lilies. At  other times he would lighten the way by showing off a few tricks, such  as leaping over trees, and turning round on one leg till he made the  dust fly; at which the pipe-bearer was mightily pleased, although it  sometimes happened that the character of these gambols frightened him.  For Grasshopper would, without the least hint of such an intention, jump  into the air far ahead, and it would cost the little pipe-bearer half a  day's hard travel to come up with him; and then the dust Grasshopper  raised was often so thick and heavy as to completely bury the poor  little pipe-bearer, and compel Grasshopper to dig diligently and with  might and main to get him out alive.    One day they came to a very large village, where they were well  received. After staying in it some time (in the course of which  Grasshopper, in a fit of abstraction, walked straight through the sides  of three lodges without stopping to look for the door), they were  informed of a number of wicked spirits, who lived at a distance, and who  made it a practice to kill all who came to their lodge. Attempts had  been made to destroy them, but they had always proved more than a match  for such as had come out against them.    Grasshopper determined to pay them a visit, although he was strongly  advised not to do so. The chief of the village warned him of the great  danger he would incur, but finding Grasshopper resolved, he said:    \"Well, if you will go, being my guest, I will send twenty warriors to  serve you.\"    Grasshopper thanked him for the offer, although he suggested that he  thought he could get along without them, at which the little pipe-bearer  grinned, for his master had never shown in that village what he could  do, and the chief thought that Grasshopper, being little himself, would  be likely to need twenty warriors, at the least, to encounter the wicked  spirits with any chance of success. Twenty young men made their  appearance. They set forward, and after about a day's journey they  descried the lodge of the Manitoes.    Grasshopper placed his friend, the pipe-bearer, and the warriors, near  enough to see all that passed, while he went alone to the lodge.    As he entered, Grasshopper saw five horrid-looking Manitoes in the act  of eating. It was the father and his four sons. They were really  hideous to look upon. Their eyes were swimming low in their heads, and  they glared about as if they were half starved. They offered Grasshopper  something to eat, which he politely refused, for he had a strong  suspicion that it was the thigh-bone of a man.    \"What have you come for?\" said the old one.    \"Nothing,\" answered Grasshopper; \"where is your uncle?\"    They all stared at him, and answered:    \"We ate him, yesterday. What do you want?\"    \"Nothing,\" said Grasshopper; \"where is your grandfather?\"    They all answered, with another broad stare:    \"We ate him a week ago. Do you not wish to wrestle?\"    \"Yes,\" replied Grasshopper, \"I don't mind if I do take a turn; but you  must be easy with me, for you see I am very little.\"    Pipe-bearer, who stood near enough to overhear the conversation, grinned  from ear to ear when he caught this remark. The Manitoes answered:    \"Oh yes, we will be easy with you.\"    And as they said this they looked at each other, and rolled their eyes  about in a dreadful manner. A hideous smile came over their faces as  they whispered among themselves:    \"It's a pity he's so thin. You go,\" they said to the eldest brother.    The two got ready--the Manito and Grasshopper--and they were soon  clinched in each other's arms for a deadly throw. Grasshopper knew their  object--his death; they wanted a taste of his delicate little body, and  he was determined they should have it, perhaps in a different sense from  that they intended.    \"Haw! haw!\" they cried, and soon the dust and dry leaves flew about as  if driven by a strong wind. The Manito was strong, but Grasshopper  thought he could master him; and all at once giving him a sly trip, as  the wicked spirit was trying to finish his breakfast with a piece out of  his shoulder, he sent the Manito head-foremost against a stone; and,  calling aloud to the three others, he bade them come and take the body  away.    The brothers now stepped forth in quick succession, but Grasshopper  having got his blood up, and limbered himself by exercise, soon  dispatched the three--sending one this way, another that, and the third  straight up into the air, so high that he never came down again.    It was time for the old Manito to be frightened, and dreadfully  frightened he got, and ran for his life, which was the very worst thing  he could have done; for Grasshopper, of all his gifts of strength, was  most noted for his speed of foot. The old Manito set off, and for mere  sport's sake, Grasshopper pursued him. Sometimes he was before the  wicked old spirit, sometimes he was flying over his head, and then he  would keep along at a steady trot just at his heels, till he had blown  all the breath out of the old knave's body.    Meantime his friend, the pipe-bearer, and the twenty young warriors,  cried out:    \"Ha, ha, ah! ha, ha, ah! Grasshopper is driving him before him!\"    The Manito only turned his head now and then to look back. At length,  when he was tired of the sport, to be rid of him, Grasshopper, with a  gentle application of his foot, sent the wicked old Manito whirling away  through the air, in which he made a great number of the most curious  turn-overs in the world, till he came to alight, when it so happened  that he fell astride of an old bull-buffalo, grazing in a distant  pasture, who straightway set off with him at a long gallop, and the old  Manito has not been heard of to this day.    The warriors and the pipe-bearer and Grasshopper set to work and burned  down the lodge of the wicked spirits, and then when they came to look  about, they saw that the ground was strewn on all sides with human bones  bleaching in the sun; these were the unhappy victims of the Manitoes.  Grasshopper then took three arrows from his girdle, and after having  performed a ceremony to the Great Spirit, he shot one into the air,  crying, \"You are lying down; rise up, or you will be hit!\"    The bones all moved to one place. He shot the second arrow, repeating  the same words, when each bone drew toward its fellow-bone; the third  arrow brought forth to life the whole multitude of people who had been  killed by the Manitoes. Grasshopper conducted the crowd to the chief of  the village, who had proved his friend, and gave them into his hands.  The chief was there with his counselors, to whom he spoke apart.    \"Who is more worthy,\" said the chief to Grasshopper, \"to rule than you.  _You_ alone can defend them.\"    Grasshopper thanked him, and told him that he was in search of more  adventures. \"I have done some things,\" said little Grasshopper, rather  boastfully, \"and I think I can do some more.\"    The chief still urged him, but he was eager to go, and naming  pipe-bearer to tarry and take his place, he set out again on his  travels, promising that he would some time or other come back and see  them.    \"Ho! ho! ho!\" they all cried. \"Come back again and see us!\" He renewed  his promise that he would; and then set out alone.    After traveling some time he came to a great lake, and on looking about  he discovered a very large otter on an island. He thought to himself,  \"His skin will make me a fine pouch.\" And he immediately drew up at  long shots, and drove an arrow into his side. He waded into the lake,  and with some difficulty dragged him ashore, and up a hill overlooking  the lake.    As soon as Grasshopper got the otter into the sunshine where it was  warm, he skinned him, and threw the carcass some distance off, thinking  the war-eagle would come, and that he should have a chance to secure his  feathers as ornaments for the head; for Grasshopper began to be proud,  and was disposed to display himself.    He soon heard a rushing noise as of a loud wind, but could see nothing.  Presently a large eagle dropped, as if from the air, upon the otter's  carcass. Grasshopper drew his bow, and the arrow passed through under  both of his wings. The bird made a convulsive flight upward, with such  force that the cumbrous body was borne up several feet from the ground;  but with its claws deeply fixed, the heavy otter brought the eagle back  to the earth. Grasshopper possessed himself of a handful of the prime  feathers, crowned his head with the trophy, and set off in high spirits  on the look out for something new.    After walking awhile, he came to a body of water which flooded the trees  on its banks--it was a lake made by beavers.

See?\" said Tom Platt,  laughing.    \"'Guess they was swivel-eyed, then, fer it didn't git home, and I know  who'll find his boots on the main-truck ef he don't leave us alone.  Haul ahead! I'm busy, can't ye see?\"    \"Danny, ye lie on the cable an' sleep all day,\" said Long Jack. \"You're  the hoight av impidence, an' I'm persuaded ye'll corrupt our supercargo  in a week.\"    \"His name's Harvey,\" said Dan, waving two strangely shaped knives, \"an'  he'll be worth five of any Sou' Boston clam-digger 'fore long.\" He laid  the knives tastefully on the table, cocked his head on one side, and  admired the effect.    \"I think it's forty-two,\" said a small voice over-side, and there was a  roar of laughter as another voice answered, \"Then my luck's turned fer  onct, 'caze I'm forty-five, though I be stung outer all shape.\"    \"Forty-two or forty-five. I've lost count,\" the small voice said.    \"It's Penn an' Uncle Salters caountin' catch. This beats the circus any  day,\" said Dan. \"Jest look at 'em!\"    \"Come in--come in!\" roared Long Jack. \"It's wet out yondher, children.\"    \"Forty-two, ye said.\" This was Uncle Salters.    \"I'll count again, then,\" the voice replied meekly.    The two dories swung together and bunted into the schooner's side.    \"Patience o' Jerusalem!\" snapped Uncle Salters, backing water with a  splash. \"What possest a farmer like you to set foot in a boat beats me.  You've nigh stove me all up.\"    \"I am sorry, Mr. Salters. I came to sea on account of nervous  dyspepsia. You advised me, I think.\"    \"You an' your nervis dyspepsy be drowned in the Whale-hole,\" roared  Uncle Salters, a fat and tubly little man. \"You're comin' down on me  ag'in. Did ye say forty-two or forty-five?\"    \"I've forgotten, Mr. Salters. Let's count.\"    \"Don't see as it could be forty-five. I'm forty-five,\" said Uncle  Salters. \"You count keerful, Penn.\"    Disko Troop came out of the cabin. \"Salters, you pitch your fish in  naow at once,\" he said in the tone of authority.    \"Don't spile the catch, dad,\" Dan murmured. \"Them two are on'y jest  beginnin'.\"    \"Mother av delight! He's forkin' them wan by wan,\" howled Long Jack, as  Uncle Salters got to work laboriously; the little man in the other dory  counting a line of notches on the gunwale.    \"That was last week's catch,\" he said, looking up plaintively, his  forefinger where he had left off.    Manuel nudged Dan, who darted to the after-tackle, and, leaning far  overside, slipped the hook into the stern-rope as Manuel made her fast  forward. The others pulled gallantly and swung the boat in--man, fish,  and all.    \"One, two, four--nine,\" said Tom Platt, counting with a practised eye.  \"Forty-seven. Penn, you're it!\" Dan let the after-tackle run, and slid  him out of the stern on to the deck amid a torrent of his own fish.    \"Hold on!\" roared Uncle Salters, bobbing by the waist. \"Hold on, I'm a  bit mixed in my caount.\"    He had no time to protest, but was hove inboard and treated like  \"Pennsylvania.\"    \"Forty-one,\" said Tom Platt. \"Beat by a farmer, Salters. An' you sech a  sailor, too!\"    \"'Tweren't fair caount,\" said he, stumbling out of the pen; \"an' I'm  stung up all to pieces.\"    His thick hands were puffy and mottled purply white.    \"Some folks will find strawberry-bottom,\" said Dan, addressing the  newly risen moon, \"ef they hev to dive fer it, seems to me.\"    \"An' others,\" said Uncle Salters, \"eats the fat o' the land in sloth,  an' mocks their own blood-kin.\"    \"Seat ye! Seat ye!\" a voice Harvey had not heard called from the  fo'c'sle. Disko Troop, Tom Platt, Long Jack, and Salters went forward  on the word. Little Penn bent above his square deep-sea reel and the  tangled cod-lines; Manuel lay down full length on the deck, and Dan  dropped into the hold, where Harvey heard him banging casks with a  hammer.    \"Salt,\" he said, returning. \"Soon as we're through supper we git to  dressing-down. You'll pitch to dad. Tom Platt an' dad they stow  together, an' you'll hear 'em arguin'. We're second ha'af, you an' me  an' Manuel an' Penn--the youth an' beauty o' the boat.\"    \"What's the good of that?\" said Harvey. \"I'm hungry.\"    \"They'll be through in a minute. Sniff! She smells good to-night. Dad  ships a good cook ef he do suffer with his brother. It's a full catch  today, ain't it?\" He pointed at the pens piled high with cod. \"What  water did ye hev, Manuel?\"    \"Twenty-fife father,\" said the Portuguese, sleepily. \"They strike on  good an' queek. Some day I show you, Harvey.\"    The moon was beginning to walk on the still sea before the elder men  came aft. The cook had no need to cry \"second half.\" Dan and Manuel  were down the hatch and at table ere Tom Platt, last and most  deliberate of the elders, had finished wiping his mouth with the back  of his hand. Harvey followed Penn, and sat down before a tin pan of  cod's tongues and sounds, mixed with scraps of pork and fried potato, a  loaf of hot bread, and some black and powerful coffee. Hungry as they  were, they waited while \"Pennsylvania\" solemnly asked a blessing. Then  they stoked in silence till Dan drew breath over his tin cup and  demanded of Harvey how he felt.    \"'Most full, but there's just room for another piece.\"    The cook was a huge, jet-black negro, and, unlike all the negroes  Harvey had met, did not talk, contenting himself with smiles and  dumb-show invitations to eat more.    \"See, Harvey,\" said Dan, rapping with his fork on the table, \"it's jest  as I said. The young an' handsome men--like me an' Pennsy an' you an'  Manuel--we 're second ha'af, an' we eats when the first ha'af are  through. They're the old fish; and they're mean an' humpy, an' their  stummicks has to be humoured; so they come first, which they don't  deserve. Ain't that so, doctor?\"    The cook nodded.    \"Can't he talk?\" said Harvey, in a whisper.    \"'Nough to git along. Not much o' anything we know. His natural  tongue's kinder curious. Comes from the in'ards of Cape Breton, he  does, where the farmers speak home-made Scotch. Cape Breton's full o'  niggers whose folk run in there durin' aour war, an' they talk like the  farmers--all huffy-chuffy.\"    \"That is not Scotch,\" said \"Pennsylvania.\"    \"That is Gaelic. So I read in a book.\"    \"Penn reads a heap. Most of what he says is so--'cep' when it comes to  a caount o' fish--eh?\"    \"Does your father just let them say how many they've caught without  checking them?\" said Harvey.    \"Why, yes. Where's the sense of a man lyin' fer a few old cod?\"    \"Was a man once lied for his catch,\" Manuel put in. \"Lied every day.  Fife, ten, twenty-fife more fish than come he say there was.\"    \"Where was that?\" said Dan. \"None o' aour folk.\"    \"Frenchman of Anguille.\"    \"Ah! Them West Shore Frenchmen don't caount, anyway. Stands to reason  they can't caount. Ef you run acrost any of their soft hooks, Harvey,  you'll know why,\" said Dan, with an awful contempt.      \"Always more and never less,    Every time we come to dress,\"    Long Jack roared down the hatch, and the \"second ha'af\" scrambled up at  once.    The shadow of the masts and rigging, with the never-furled riding-sail,  rolled to and fro on the heaving deck in the moonlight; and the pile of  fish by the stern shone like a dump of fluid silver. In the hold there  were tramplings and rumblings where Disko Troop and Tom Platt moved  among the salt-bins. Dan passed Harvey a pitchfork, and led him to the  inboard end of the rough table, where Uncle Salters was drumming  impatiently with a knife-haft. A tub of salt water lay at his feet.    \"You pitch to dad an' Tom Platt down the hatch, an' take keer Uncle  Salters don't cut yer eye out,\" said Dan, swinging himself into the  hold. \"I'll pass salt below.\"    Penn and Manuel stood knee-deep among cod in the pen, flourishing drawn  knives. Long Jack, a basket at his feet and mittens on his hands, faced  Uncle Salters at the table, and Harvey stared at the pitchfork and the  tub.    \"Hi!\" shouted Manuel, stooping to the fish, and bringing one up with a  finger under its gill and a finger in its eye. He laid it on the edge  of the pen; the knife-blade glimmered with a sound of tearing, and the  fish, slit from throat to vent, with a nick on either side of the neck,  dropped at Long Jack's feet.    \"Hi!\" said Long Jack, with a scoop of his mittened hand. The cod's  liver dropped in the basket. Another wrench and scoop sent the head and  offal flying, and the empty fish slid across to Uncle Salters, who  snorted fiercely. There was another sound of tearing, the backbone flew  over the bulwarks, and the fish, headless, gutted, and open, splashed  in the tub, sending the salt water into Harvey's astonished mouth.  After the first yell, the men were silent. The cod moved along as  though they were alive, and long ere Harvey had ceased wondering at the  miraculous dexterity of it all, his tub was full.    \"Pitch!\" grunted Uncle Salters, without turning his head, and Harvey  pitched the fish by twos and threes down the hatch.    \"Hi! Pitch 'em bunchy,\" shouted Dan. \"Don't scatter! Uncle Salters is  the best splitter in the fleet. Watch him mind his book!\"    Indeed, it looked a little as though the round uncle were cutting  magazine pages against time. Manuel's body, cramped over from the hips,  stayed like a statue; but his long arms grabbed the fish without  ceasing. Little Penn toiled valiantly, but it was easy to see he was  weak. Once or twice Manuel found time to help him without breaking the  chain of supplies, and once Manuel howled because he had caught his  finger in a Frenchman's hook. These hooks are made of soft metal, to be  rebent after use; but the cod very often get away with them and are  hooked again elsewhere; and that is one of the many reasons why the  Gloucester boats despise the Frenchmen.    Down below, the rasping sound of rough salt rubbed on rough flesh  sounded like the whirring of a grindstone--a"]]]
