Out of the confusion rise the graceful spires of minarets  and the round domes of mosques (Plate II.). Just below your feet is the  great bazaar--the merchants' town; and farther off is St. Sophia, the  principal mosque. Like Rome, the city is built on seven hills. In the  valleys between, shady trees and gardens have found a site. Far to the  west are seen the towers on the old wall of Stambul.    [Illustration: PLAN OF CONSTANTINOPLE.]    Before you to the north, on the point of a blunt promontory, stand the  two quarters called Galata and Pera. There Europeans dwell, and there  are found Greeks and Italians, Jews and Armenians, and other men of  races living in the adjacent countries--in the Balkan Peninsula, in Asia  Minor and Caucasia.    Between this blunt peninsula and Stambul an inlet runs north-westwards  deep into the land. Its name is the Golden Horn, and over its water  priceless treasures have from time immemorial been transported in ships.    Turn to the north-east. There you see a sound varying little in breadth.  Its surface is as blue as sapphire, its shores are crowned by a whole  chaplet of villages and white villas among luxuriant groves. This sound  is the Bosporus, and through it is the way to the Black Sea. Due east,  on the other side of the Bosporus, Scutari rises from the shore to the  top of low hills. Scutari is the third of the three main divisions of  Constantinople. You stand in Europe and look over the great city  intersected by broad waterways and almost forget that Scutari is  situated in Asia.    Turn to the south. Before your eyes lies the Sea of Marmora, a curious  sheet of water which is neither a lake nor a sea, neither a bay nor a  sound. It is a link between the Black and Aegean Seas, connected by the  Bosporus with the former, and by the Dardanelles, the Hellespont, with  the latter. The Sea of Marmora is 130 miles long. Seven miles to the  south the Princes' Islands float on the water like airy gardens, and  beyond in the blue distance are seen the mountains of Asia Minor.    You will acknowledge that this view is very wonderful. Your eyes wander  over two continents and two seas. You are in Europe, but on the  threshold of Asia; and when you look down on the Turks swarming below,  and at the graceful white boats darting across the sound, you may almost  fancy that you are in Asia rather than in Europe. You will also notice  that this fairway is an important trade route. Innumerable vessels pass  daily through the Bosporus to the coasts of Bulgaria, Rumania, Russia,  and Asia Minor, and as many out through the Dardanelles to Greece and  the Archipelago and to the coasts of the Mediterranean.    Close beneath you all the colours and outlines are distinct. The water  of the Bosporus is vividly blue, and the villas dazzlingly white. On the  Asiatic side stand woods of dark-green cypresses, and outside the  western wall Turks slumber in the deepest shade; cypresses, indeed, are  the watchmen of the dead. And all round the horizon this charming  landscape passes into fainter and lighter tones, light-blue and grey.  You cannot perceive clearly where the land ends and sea and sky begin.  But here and there the white wings of a sailing vessel flutter or a  slight puff of smoke floats above a steamer.    A continuous murmur reaches your ears. It is not wind, nor the song of  waves. It is the combined voice of nature and human labour. It is like  the buzzing round a beehive. Now and then you distinguish the cry of a  porter, the bell of a tramcar, the whistle of a steamer, or the bark of  a dog. But, as a rule, all melt together into a single sound. It is the  ceaseless noise that always hovers over the chimneys of a great city.      THE CHURCH OF THE DIVINE WISDOM    Let us now go down to the great mosque on the point. On the top of the  principal dome we see a huge gilded crescent. This has glittered up  there for 450 years, but previously the cupola was adorned by the  Christian Cross. How came the change about?    Let us imagine that we are standing outside the church and let the year  be 548 A.D. One of the finest temples of Christendom has just been  completed by the first architect of his time from Asia Minor. The work  has occupied sixteen years, and ten thousand workmen have been  constantly engaged at it. But now it is finished at last, and the Church  of the Divine Wisdom, Hagia Sophia, is to be consecrated to-day.    The great Emperor of the Byzantine realm, Justinian, drives up in a  chariot drawn by four horses. He enters the temple attended by the  Patriarch of Constantinople. The building is as large as a market-place,  and the beautiful dome, round as the vault of heaven, is 180 feet above  the floor. Justinian looks around and is pleased with his work. The  great men of the church and empire, clad in costly robes, salute him. He  examines the variegated marble which covers the walls, he admires the  artistically arranged mosaic on the gold groundwork of the dome, he is  amazed at the hundred columns which support the cupolas and galleries,  some of dark-green marble, others of dark-red porphyry. The Emperor's  wealth is inexhaustible. Has he not presented to the church seven  crosses of gold, each weighing a hundred pounds? Does not the Church of  the Divine Wisdom possess forty thousand chalice veils all embroidered  with pearls and precious stones? Are there not in the sacristy  twenty-four Bibles, which in their gold-studded cases weigh two hundred  pounds each? Are not pictures of the Redeemer, of the Mother of God, of  angels, prophets and evangelists suspended between the twelve columns of  solid silver which are the Holy of Holies in the temple? Are not the  faithful moved to tears at the sight of the crucifix and at the  remembrance that the gilded cross of silver is an exact copy of that  which, more than five hundred years ago, was set up by Roman barbarians  at Jerusalem?    Justinian turns round and examines the panels of the three doors which  are said to have been made of wood from Noah's ark. The doors of the  main entrance are of solid silver, the others are beautifully inlaid  with cedar-wood, ivory, and amber. Above his head silver chandeliers  swing in chains; some of them form together a cross, and are a symbol of  the light of heaven hovering over the darkness of earthly life. The  vault is flooded with light; and in the mosaic he sees the meek saints  kneeling before God in silent supplication. Below the vault he sees the  four cherubims with two pairs of wings. He thinks of the first chapter  of Ezekiel: \"And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the  living creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal ... and I  heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters.\" He also  calls to mind the book of Exodus, ch. xxxvii.: \"Even to the  mercy-seatward were the faces of the cherubims.\" It was the same here in  his own church.    Inspired by humility before God and pride before his fellowmen, the  Emperor Justinian moves to his prie-dieu. He falls on his knees and  exclaims: \"God be praised who has thought me worthy to bring such a work  to completion! I have surpassed thee, O Solomon.\"    Then the pipes and drums strike up, and the glad songs of the people  echo among the houses, which are decorated by webs of costly brocade  hanging from the windows. The festival is prolonged for fourteen days;  casksful of silver coins are distributed among the multitude, and the  Emperor feasts the whole city.    Then follow new centuries and new generations in the footsteps of the  old. The bones of Christians moulder under the grave mounds, but still  the temple remains as before. There priests and patriarchs and fathers  of the Church assemble to Church Councils, and the great festivals of  the year are celebrated under its vault. Nearly a thousand years of the  stream of time have passed away, and we come to May 29, 1453.    May is a fine month in Constantinople. The summer is in all its glory,  the gardens are gorgeous in their fresh verdure, the clear waters of the  Bosporus glitter like brightly polished metal. But what a day of  humiliation and terror was this day of May, 1453! In the early morning  tidings of misfortune were disseminated among the citizens. The Turkish  Sultan had stormed in through the walls with his innumerable troops.  Beside themselves with fright, men, women, and children fled to St.  Sophia, leaving their homes and goods to be plundered. A hundred  thousand persons rushed in and locked and barred all the church doors  behind them. They trusted that the conqueror would not dare to desecrate  so holy a place. Abashed before the holiness of God, he would bow down  in the dust and leave them in peace. And according to a prophecy the  angel of God would descend from heaven in the hour of need and rescue  the church and the city.    The Christians waited, praying and trembling. Then the wild fanfares of  the Mohammedan trumpets were heard from the nearest hills. Piercing  cries of anguish echoed from the vaulting, mothers pressed their  children to their hearts, husbands and wives embraced each other, galley  slaves with chains still on their wrists tried to hide themselves in the  darkness behind the pillars.    The axes of the Mohammedans ring against the doors. Splinters of costly  wood fly before the blows. Here a gate cracks, there another is broken  in. The janissaries rush in, thirsting for blood. The Prophet has  commanded that his doctrines shall be spread over the earth by fire and  sword. They are only too ready to obey this order. Already steeped in  blood from the combat outside the walls, they continue to gather in the  harvest with dripping scimitars. The defenceless are fastened together  with chains and driven out like cattle.    Then comes the turn of the holy edifice. The mosaics are hacked to  pieces with swords and lances, the costly altar-cloths are taken from  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2071"],[0,"Stories (#5)"],[1," drew nearer, when she perceived that what she had believed  to be a bundle was indeed a woman, apparently in the last stage of  exhaustion.    Koosje tried to lift her; but the dead-weight was beyond her, young and  strong as she was. Then the rain and the wind came on again in fiercer  gusts than before; the woman's moans grew louder and louder, and what to  do Koosje knew not.    She struggled on for the few steps that lay between her and the  professor's house, and then she rang a peal which resounded through the  echoing passages, bringing Dortje, the other maid, running out; after  the manner of her class, imagining all sorts of terrible catastrophes  had happened. She uttered a cry of relief when she perceived it was only  Koosje, who, without vouchsafing any explanation, dashed past her and  ran straight into the professor's room.    \"O professor!\" she gasped out; but, between her efforts to remove the  woman, her struggle with the elements, and her race down the passage,  her breath was utterly gone.    The professor looked up from his book and his tea-tray in surprise. For  a moment he thought that Koosje, his domestic treasure, had altogether  taken leave of her senses; for she was streaming with water, covered  with mud, and head and cap were in a state of disorder, such as neither  he nor any one else had ever seen them in since the last time she had  been fished out of the Nieuwe Gracht.    \"What is the matter, Koosje?\" he asked, regarding her gravely over his  spectacles.    \"There's a woman outside--dying,\" she panted, \"I fell over her.\"    \"You had better try to get her in then,\" the old gentleman said, in  quite a relieved tone. \"You and Dortje must bring her in. Dear, dear,  poor soul! but it is a dreadful night.\"    The old gentleman shivered as he spoke, and drew a little nearer to the  tall white porcelain stove.    It was, as he had said a minute before, a terrible night. He could hear  the wind beating about the house and rattling about the casements and  moaning down the chimneys; and to think any poor soul should be out on  such a night, _dying_! Heaven preserve others who might be belated or  houseless in any part of the world!    He fell into a fit of abstraction,--a habit not uncommon with learned  men,--wondering why life should be so different with different people;  why he should be in that warm, handsome room, with its soft rich  hangings and carpet, with its beautiful furniture of carved wood, its  pictures, and the rare china scattered here and there among the grim  array of skeletons which were his delight. He wondered why he should  take his tea out of costly and valuable Oriental china, sugar and cream  out of antique silver, while other poor souls had no tea at all, and  nothing to take it out of even if they had. He wondered why he  should have a lamp under his teapot that was a very marvel of art  transparencies; why he should have every luxury, and this poor creature  should be dying in the street amid the wind and the rain. It was all  very unequal.    It was very odd, the professor argued, leaning his back against the  tall, warm stove; it was very odd indeed. He began to feel that, grand  as the study of osteology undoubtedly is, he ought not to permit it  to become so engrossing as to blind him to the study of the greater  philosophies of life. His reverie was, however, broken by the abrupt  reentrance of Koosje, who this time was a trifle less breathless than  she had been before.    \"We have got her into the kitchen, professor,\" she announced. \"She is a  child--a mere baby, and so pretty! She has opened her eyes and spoken.\"    \"Give her some soup and wine--hot,\" said the professor, without  stirring.    \"But won't you come?\" she asked.    The professor hesitated; he hated attending in cases of illness, though  he was a properly qualified doctor and in an emergency would lay his  prejudice aside.    \"Or shall I run across for the good Dr. Smit?\" Koosje asked. \"He would  come in a minute, only it is _such_ a night!\"    At that moment a fiercer gust than before rattled at the casements, and  the professor laid aside his scruples.    He followed his housekeeper down the chilly, marble-flagged passage into  the kitchen, where he never went for months together--a cosey enough,  pleasant place, with a deep valance hanging from the mantel-shelf, with  many great copper pans, bright and shining as new gold, and furniture  all scrubbed to the whiteness of snow.    In an arm-chair before the opened stove sat the rescued girl--a slight,  golden-haired thing, with wistful blue eyes and a frightened air. Every  moment she caught her breath in a half-hysterical sob, while violent  shivers shook her from head to foot.    The professor went and looked at her over his spectacles, as if she had  been some curious specimen of his favourite study; but at the same time  he kept at a respectful distance from her.    \"Give her some soup and wine,\" he said, at length, putting his hands  under the tails of his long dressing-gown of flowered cashmere. \"Some  soup and wine--hot; and put her to bed.\"    \"Is she then to remain for the night?\" Koosje asked, a little surprised.    \"Oh, don't send me away!\" the golden-haired girl broke out, in a voice  that was positively a wail, and clasping a pair of pretty, slender hands  in piteous supplication.    \"Where do you come from?\" the old gentleman asked, much as if he  expected she might suddenly jump up and bite him.    \"From Beijerland, mynheer,\" she answered, with a sob.    \"So! Koosje, she is remarkably well dressed, is she not?\" the professor  said, glancing at the costly lace head-gear, the heavy gold head-piece,  which lay on the table together with the great gold spiral ornaments and  filigree pendants--a dazzling head of richness. He looked, too, at the  girl's white hands, at the rich, crape-laden gown, at their delicate  beauty, and shower of waving golden hair, which, released from the  confinement of the cap and head-piece, floated in a rich mass of  glittering beauty over the pillows which his servant had placed beneath  her head.    The professor was old; the professor was wholly given up to his  profession, which he jokingly called his sweetheart; and, though he  cut half of his acquaintances in the street through inattention and  the shortness of his sight, he had eyes in his head, and upon occasions  could use them. He therefore repeated the question.    \"Very well dressed indeed, professor,\" returned Koosje, promptly.    \"And what are you doing in Utrecht--in such a plight as this, too?\" he  asked, still keeping at a safe distance.    \"O mynheer, I am all alone in the world,\" she answered, her blue misty  eyes filled with tears. \"I had a month ago a dear, good, kind father,  but he has died, and I am indeed desolate. I always believed him rich,  and to these things,\" with a gesture that included her dress and the  ornaments on the table, \"I have ever been accustomed. Thus I ordered  without consideration such clothes as I thought needful. And then I  found there was nothing for me--not a hundred guilders to call my own  when all was paid.\"    \"But what brought you to Utrecht?\"    \"He sent me here, mynheer. In his last illness, only of three days'  duration, he bade me gather all together and come to this city, where I  was to ask for a Mevrouw Baake, his cousin.\"    \"Mevrouw Baake, of the Sigaren Fabrijk,\" said Dortje, in an aside, to  the others. \"I lived servant with her before I came here.\"    \"I had heard very little about her, only my father had sometimes  mentioned his cousin to me; they had once been betrothed,\" the stranger  continued. \"But when I reached Utrecht I found she was dead--two years  dead; but we had never heard of it.\"    \"Dear, dear, dear!\" exclaimed the professor, pityingly. \"Well, you had  better let Koosje put you to bed, and we will see what can be done for  you in the morning.\"    \"Am I to make up a bed?\" Koosje asked, following him along the passage.    The professor wheeled round and faced her.    \"She had better sleep in the guest room,\" he said, thoughtfully,  regardless of the cold which struck to his slippered feet from the  marble floor. \"That is the only room which does not contain specimens  that would probably frighten the poor child. I am very much afraid,  Koosje,\" he concluded, doubtfully, \"that she is a lady; and what we are  to do with a lady I can't think.\"    With that the old gentleman shuffled off to his cosey room, and Koosje  turned back to her kitchen.    \"He'll never think of marrying her,\" mused Koosje, rather blankly. If  she had spoken the thoughts to the professor himself, she would have  received a very emphatic assurance that, much as the study of osteology  and the Stradivari had blinded him to the affairs of this workaday  world, he was not yet so thoroughly foolish as to join his fossilised  wisdom to the ignorance of a child of sixteen or seventeen.    However, on the morrow matters assumed a somewhat different aspect.  Gertrude van Floote proved to be not exactly a gentlewoman. It is true  that her father had been a well-to-do man for his station in life, and  had very much spoiled and indulged his one motherless child. Yet her  education was so slight that she could do little more than read and  write, besides speaking a little English, which she had picked up from  the yachtsmen frequenting her native town. The professor found she had  been but a distant relative of the Mevrouw Baake, to seek whom she  had come to Utrecht, and that she had no kinsfolk upon whom she could  depend--a fact which accounted for the profusion of her jewellery, all  her golden trinkets having descended to her as heirlooms.    \"I can be your servant, mynheer,\" she suggested. \"Indeed, I am a very  useful girl, as you will find if you will but try me.\"    Now, as a rule, the professor vigorously set his face against admitting  young servants into his house. They broke his china, they"]]]
