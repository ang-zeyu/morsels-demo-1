Go on now, for one sole will is in us both:  Thou Leader, thou Lord, and thou Master.\" Thus I said to him; and  when he had moved on, I entered along the deep and savage road.        CANTO III. The gate of Hell.--Virgil lends Dante in.--The  punishment of the neither good nor bad.--Acheron, and the sinners  on its bank.--Charon.--Earthquake.--Dante swoons.    \"Through me is the way into the woeful city; through me is the  way into eternal woe; through me is the way among the lost  people. Justice moved my lofty maker: the divine Power, the  supreme Wisdom and the primal Love made me. Before me were no  things created, unless eternal, and I eternal last. Leave every  hope, ye who enter!\"    These words of color obscure I saw written at the top of a gate;  whereat I, \"Master, their meaning is dire to me.\"    And he to me, like one who knew, \"Here it behoves to leave every  fear; it behoves that all cowardice should here be dead. We have  come to the place where I have told thee that thou shalt see the  woeful people, who have lost the good of the understanding.\"    And when he had put his hand on mine, with a glad countenance,  wherefrom I took courage, he brought me within the secret things.  Here sighs, laments, and deep wailings were resounding though the  starless air; wherefore at first I wept thereat. Strange tongues,  horrible cries, words of woe, accents of anger, voices high and  hoarse, and sounds of hands with them, were making a tumult which  whirls forever in that air dark without change, like the sand  when the whirlwind breathes.    And I, who had my head girt with horror, said, \"Master, what is  it that I hear? and what folk are they who seem in woe so  vanquished?\"    And he to me, \"This miserable measure the wretched souls maintain  of those who lived without infamy and without praise. Mingled are  they with that caitiff choir of the angels, who were not rebels,  nor were faithful to God, but were for themselves. The heavens  chased them out in order to be not less beautiful, nor doth the  depth of Hell receive them, because the damned would have some  glory from them.\"    And I, \"Master, what is so grievous to them, that makes them  lament so bitterly?\"    He answered, \"I will tell thee very briefly. These have no hope  of death; and their blind life is so debased, that they are  envious of every other lot. Fame of them the world permitteth not  to be; mercy and justice disdain them. Let us not speak of them,  but do thou look and pass on.\"    And I, who was gazing, saw a banner, that whirling ran so swiftly  that it seemed to me to scorn all repose, and behind it came so  long a train of folk, that I could never have believed death had  undone so many. After I had distinguished some among them, I saw  and knew the shade of him who made, through cowardice, the great  refusal. [1] At once I understood and was certain, that this was  the sect of the caitiffs displeasing unto God, and unto his  enemies. These wretches, who never were alive, were naked, and  much stung by gad-flies and by wasps that were there. These  streaked their faces with blood, which, mingled with tears, was  harvested at their feet by loathsome worms.    [1] Who is intended by these words is uncertain.      And when I gave myself to looking onward, I saw people on the  bank of a great river; wherefore I said, \"Master, now grant to me  that I may know who these are, and what rule makes them appear so  ready to pass over, as I discern through the faint light.\" And he  to me, \"The things will be clear to thee, when we shall set our  steps on the sad marge of Acheron.\" Then with eyes bashful and  cast down, fearing lest my speech had been irksome to him, far as  to the river I refrained from speaking.    And lo! coming toward us in a boat, an old man, white with  ancient hair, crying, \"Woe to you, wicked souls! hope not ever to  see Heaven! I come to carry you to the other bank, into eternal  darkness, to heat and frost. And thou who art there, living soul,  depart from these that are dead.\" But when he saw that I did not  depart, he said, \"By another way, by other ports thou shalt come  to the shore, not here, for passage; it behoves that a lighter  bark bear thee.\"[1]    [1] The boat that bears the souls to Purgatory. Charon recognizes  that Dante is not among the damned.      And my Leader to him, \"Charon, vex not thyself, it is thus willed  there where is power to do that which is willed; and farther ask  not.\" Then the fleecy cheeks were quiet of the pilot of the livid  marsh, who round about his eyes had wheels of flame.    But those souls, who were weary and naked, changed color, and  gnashed their teeth soon as they heard his cruel words. They  blasphemed God and their parents, the human race, the place, the  time and the seed of their sowing and of their birth. Then,  bitterly weeping, they drew back all of them together to the evil  bank, that waits for every man who fears not God. Charon the  demon, with eyes of glowing coal, beckoning them, collects them  all; he beats with his oar whoever lingers.    As in autumn the leaves fall off one after the other, till the  bough sees all its spoils upon the earth, in like wise the evil  seed of Adam throw themselves from that shore one by one at  signals, as the bird at his call. Thus they go over the dusky  wave, and before they have landed on the farther side, already on  this a new throng is gathered.    \"My son,\" said the courteous Master, \"those who die in the wrath  of God, all meet together here from every land. And they are  eager to pass over the stream, for the divine justice spurs them,  so that fear is turned to desire. This way a good soul never  passes; and therefore if Charon snarleth at thee, thou now mayest  well know what his speech signifies.\" This ended, the dark plain  trembled so mightily, that the memory of the terror even now  bathes me with sweat. The tearful land gave forth a wind that  flashed a vermilion light which vanquished every sense of mine,  and I fell as a man whom slumber seizes.        CANTO IV. The further side of Acheron.--Virgil leads Dante into  Limbo, the First Circle of Hell, containing the spirits of those  who lived virtuously but without Christianity.--Greeting of  Virgil by his fellow poets.--They enter a castle, where are the  shades of ancient worthies.--Virgil and Dante depart.    A heavy thunder broke the deep sleep in my head, so that I  started up like a person who by force is wakened. And risen  erect, I moved my rested eye round about, and looked fixedly to  distinguish the place where I was. True it is, that I found  myself on the verge of the valley of the woeful abyss that  gathers in thunder of infinite wailings. Dark, profound it was,  and cloudy, so that though I fixed my sight on the bottom I did  not discern anything there.    \"Now we descend down here into the blind world,\" began the Poet  all deadly pale, \"I will be first, and thou shalt be second.\"    And I, who had observed his color, said, \"How shall I come, if  thou fearest, who art wont to be a comfort to my doubting?\" And  he to me, \"The anguish of the folk who are down here depicts upon  my face that pity which thou takest for fear. Let us go on, for  the long way urges us.\"    So he set forth, and so he made me enter within the first circle  that girds the abyss. Here, so far as could be heard, there was  no plaint but that of sighs which made the eternal air to  tremble: this came of the woe without torments felt by the  crowds, which were many and great, of infants and of women and of  men.    The good Master to me, \"Thou dost not ask what spirits are these  that thou seest. Now I would have thee know, before thou goest  farther, that they sinned not; and if they have merits it  sufficeth not, because they had not baptism, which is part of the  faith that thou believest; and if they were before Christianity,  they did not duly worship God: and of such as these am I myself.  Through such defects, and not through other guilt, are we lost,  and only so far harmed that without hope we live in desire.\"    Great woe seized me at my heart when I heard him, because I knew  that people of much worth were suspended in that limbo. \"Tell me,  my Master, tell me, Lord,\" began I, with wish to be assured of  that faith which vanquishes every error,[1] \"did ever any one who  afterwards was blessed go out from here, either by his own or by  another's merit?\" And he, who understood my covert speech,  answered, \"I was new in this state when I saw a Mighty One come  hither crowned with sign of victory. He drew out hence the shade  of the first parent, of Abel his son, and that of Noah, of Moses  the law-giver and obedient, Abraham the patriarch, and David the  King, Israel with his father, and with his offspring, and with  Rachel, for whom he did so much, and others many; and He made  them blessed: and I would have thee know that before these, human  spirits were not saved.\"    [1] Wishing especially to be assured in regard to the descent of  Christ into Hell.      We ceased not going on because he spoke, but all the while were  passing through the wood, the wood I mean of crowded spirits. Nor  yet had our way been long from where I slept, when I saw a fire,  that conquered a hemisphere of darkness. We were still a little  distant from it, yet not so far that I could not partially  discern that honorable folk possessed that place. \"O thou that  honorest both science and art, these, who are they, that have  such honor that from the condition of the others it sets them  apart?\" And he to me, \"The honorable fame of them which resounds  above in thy life wins grace in heaven that so advances them.\" At  this a voice was heard by me, \"Honor the loftiest Poet! his shade  returns that was departed.\" When the voice had ceased and was  quiet, I saw four great shades coming to us: they had a semblance  neither sad nor glad."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19950"],[0,"Summa Theologica, Part III (Tertia Pars) (#5)"],[1,"great humility if  these signs of Divine power had been wrought in their midst?\" And he  adds in answer (De Perseverantia xi): \"Hence, as the Apostle says  (Rom. 9:16), 'it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth,  but of God that showeth mercy'; Who (succors whom He will of) those  who, as He foresaw, would believe in His miracles if wrought amongst  them, (while others) He succors not, having judged them in His  predestination secretly yet justly. Therefore let us unshrinkingly  believe His mercy to be with those who are set free, and His truth  with those who are condemned.\" [*The words in brackets are not in the  text of St. Augustine].    Reply Obj. 3: Perfection is prior to imperfection, both in time and  nature, in things that are different (for what brings others to  perfection must itself be perfect); but in one and the same,  imperfection is prior in time though posterior in nature. And thus  the eternal perfection of God precedes in duration the imperfection  of human nature; but the latter's ultimate perfection in union with  God follows.  _______________________    SIXTH ARTICLE [III, Q. 1, Art. 6]    Whether the Incarnation Ought to Have Been Put Off Till the End of  the World?    Objection 1: It would seem that the work of the Incarnation ought to  have been put off till the end of the world. For it is written (Ps.  91:11): \"My old age in plentiful mercy\"--i.e. \"in the last days,\" as  a gloss says. But the time of the Incarnation is especially the time  of mercy, according to Ps. 101:14: \"For it is time to have mercy on  it.\" Therefore the Incarnation ought to have been put off till the  end of the world.    Obj. 2: Further, as has been said (A. 5, ad 3), in the same subject,  perfection is subsequent in time to imperfection. Therefore, what is  most perfect ought to be the very last in time. But the highest  perfection of human nature is in the union with the Word, because \"in  Christ it hath pleased the Father that all the fulness of the Godhead  should dwell,\" as the Apostle says (Col. 1:19, and 2:9). Therefore  the Incarnation ought to have been put off till the end of the world.    Obj. 3: Further, what can be done by one ought not to be done by two.  But the one coming of Christ at the end of the world was sufficient  for the salvation of human nature. Therefore it was not necessary for  Him to come beforehand in His Incarnation; and hence the Incarnation  ought to have been put off till the end of the world.    _On the contrary,_ It is written (Hab. 3:2): \"In the midst of the  years Thou shalt make it known.\" Therefore the mystery of the  Incarnation which was made known to the world ought not to have been  put off till the end of the world.    _I answer that,_ As it was not fitting that God should become  incarnate at the beginning of the world, so also it was not fitting  that the Incarnation should be put off till the end of the world. And  this is shown first from the union of the Divine and human nature.  For, as it has been said (A. 5, ad 3), perfection precedes  imperfection in time in one way, and contrariwise in another way  imperfection precedes perfection. For in that which is made perfect  from being imperfect, imperfection precedes perfection in time,  whereas in that which is the efficient cause of perfection,  perfection precedes imperfection in time. Now in the work of the  Incarnation both concur; for by the Incarnation human nature is  raised to its highest perfection; and in this way it was not becoming  that the Incarnation should take place at the beginning of the human  race. And the Word incarnate is the efficient cause of the perfection  of human nature, according to John 1:16: \"Of His fulness we have all  received\"; and hence the work of the Incarnation ought not to have  been put off till the end of the world. But the perfection of glory  to which human nature is to be finally raised by the Word Incarnate  will be at the end of the world.    Secondly, from the effect of man's salvation; for, as is said _Qq.  Vet. et Nov. Test., qu. 83,_ \"it is in the power of the Giver to have  pity when, or as much as, He wills. Hence He came when He knew it was  fitting to succor, and when His boons would be welcome. For when by  the feebleness of the human race men's knowledge of God began to grow  dim and their morals lax, He was pleased to choose Abraham as a  standard of the restored knowledge of God and of holy living; and  later on when reverence grew weaker, He gave the law to Moses in  writing; and because the gentiles despised it and would not take it  upon themselves, and they who received it would not keep it, being  touched with pity, God sent His Son, to grant to all remission of  their sin and to offer them, justified, to God the Father.\" But if  this remedy had been put off till the end of the world, all knowledge  and reverence of God and all uprightness of morals would have been  swept away from the earth.    Thirdly, this appears fitting to the manifestation of the Divine  power, which has saved men in several ways--not only by faith in some  future thing, but also by faith in something present and past.    Reply Obj. 1: This gloss has in view the mercy of God, which leads us  to glory. Nevertheless, if it is referred to the mercy shown the  human race by the Incarnation of Christ, we must reflect that, as  Augustine says (Retract. i), the time of the Incarnation may be  compared to the youth of the human race, \"on account of the strength  and fervor of faith, which works by charity\"; and to old age--i.e.  the sixth age--on account of the number of centuries, for Christ came  in the sixth age. And although youth and old age cannot be together  in a body, yet they can be together in a soul, the former on account  of quickness, the latter on account of gravity. And hence Augustine  says elsewhere (Qq. lxxxiii, qu. 44) that \"it was not becoming that  the Master by Whose imitation the human race was to be formed to the  highest virtue should come from heaven, save in the time of youth.\"  But in another work (De Gen. cont. Manich. i, 23) he says: that  Christ came in the sixth age--i.e. in the old age--of the human race.    Reply Obj. 2: The work of the Incarnation is to be viewed not as  merely the terminus of a movement from imperfection to perfection,  but also as a principle of perfection to human nature, as has been  said.    Reply Obj. 3: As Chrysostom says on John 3:11, \"For God sent not His  Son into the world to judge the world\" (Hom. xxviii): \"There are two  comings of Christ: the first, for the remission of sins; the second,  to judge the world. For if He had not done so, all would have  perished together, since all have sinned and need the glory of God.\"  Hence it is plain that He ought not to have put off the coming in  mercy till the end of the world.  _______________________    QUESTION 2    OF THE MODE OF UNION OF THE WORD INCARNATE  (In Twelve Articles)    Now we must consider the mode of union of the Incarnate Word; and,  first, the union itself; secondly, the Person assuming; thirdly, the  nature assumed.    Under the first head there are twelve points of inquiry:    (1) Whether the union of the Word Incarnate took place in the nature?    (2) Whether it took place in the Person?    (3) Whether it took place in the suppositum or hypostasis?    (4) Whether the Person or hypostasis of Christ is composite after the  Incarnation?    (5) Whether any union of body and soul took place in Christ?    (6) Whether the human nature was united to the Word accidentally?    (7) Whether the union itself is something created?    (8) Whether it is the same as assumption?    (9) Whether the union of the two natures is the greatest union?    (10) Whether the union of the two natures in Christ was brought about  by grace?    (11) Whether any merits preceded it?    (12) Whether the grace of union was natural to the man Christ?  _______________________    FIRST ARTICLE [III, Q. 2, Art. 1]    Whether the Union of the Incarnate Word Took Place in the Nature?    Objection 1: It would seem that the Union of the Word Incarnate took  place in the nature. For Cyril says (he is quoted in the acts of the  Council of Chalcedon, part ii, act. 1): \"We must understand not two  natures, but one incarnate nature of the Word of God\"; and this could  not be unless the union took place in the nature. Therefore the union  of the Word Incarnate took place in the nature.    Obj. 2: Further, Athanasius says that, as the rational soul and the  flesh together form the human nature, so God and man together form a  certain one nature; therefore the union took place in the nature.    Obj. 3: Further, of two natures one is not denominated by the other  unless they are to some extent mutually transmuted. But the Divine  and human natures in Christ are denominated one by the other; for  Cyril says (quoted in the acts of the Council of Chalcedon, part ii,  act. 1) that the Divine nature \"is incarnate\"; and Gregory Nazianzen  says (Ep. i ad Cledon.) that the human nature is \"deified,\" as  appears from Damascene (De Fide Orth. iii, 6, 11). Therefore from two  natures one seems to have resulted.    _On the contrary,_ It is said in the declaration of the Council of  Chalcedon: \"We confess that in these latter times the only-begotten  Son of God appeared in two natures, without confusion, without  change, without division, without separation--the distinction of  natures not having been taken away by the union.\" Therefore the union  did not take place in the nature.    _I answer that,_ To make this question clear we must consider what is  \"nature.\" Now it is to be observed that the word \"nature\" comes from  nativity. Hence this word was used first of all to signify the  begetting of living beings, which is called \"birth\" or \"sprouting  forth,\" the word \"natura\" meaning, as it were, \"nascitura.\"  Afterwards this word \"nature\" was taken to signify the principle of  this begetting; and"]]]
