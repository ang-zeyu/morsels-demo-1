Uplift your magnanimity and soar high toward the apex  of heaven so that your blessed hearts may become illumined more and more,  day by day, through the rays of the Sun of Reality, that is, His Holiness  Baha'u'llah; at every moment the spirits may obtain a new life, and the  darkness of the world of nature may be entirely dispelled; thus you may  become incarnate light and personified spirit, become entirely unaware of  the sordid matters of this world and in touch with the affairs of the  divine world.    6 Behold the portals which Baha'u'llah hath opened before you! Consider  how exalted and lofty is the station you are destined to attain; how  unique the favors with which you have been endowed. Should we become  intoxicated with this cup, the sovereignty of this globe of earth will  become lower in our estimation than children's play. Should they place in  the arena the crown of the government of the whole world, and invite each  one of us to accept it, undoubtedly we shall not condescend, and shall  refuse to accept it.    7 To attain to this supreme station is, however, dependent on the  realization of certain conditions:    8 The first condition is firmness in the Covenant of God. For the power of  the Covenant will protect the Cause of Baha'u'llah from the doubts of the  people of error. It is the fortified fortress of the Cause of God and the  firm pillar of the religion of God. Today no power can conserve the  oneness of the Baha'i world save the Covenant of God; otherwise  differences like unto a most great tempest will encompass the Baha'i  world. It is evident that the axis of the oneness of the world of humanity  is the power of the Covenant and nothing else. Had the Covenant not come  to pass, had it not been revealed from the Supreme Pen and had not the  Book of the Covenant, like unto the ray of the Sun of Reality, illuminated  the world, the forces of the Cause of God would have been utterly  scattered and certain souls who were the prisoners of their own passions  and lusts would have taken into their hands an axe, cutting the root of  this Blessed Tree. Every person would have pushed forward his own desire  and every individual aired his own opinion! Notwithstanding this great  Covenant, a few negligent souls galloped with their chargers into the  battlefield, thinking perchance they might be able to weaken the  foundation of the Cause of God: but praise be to God all of them were  afflicted with regret and loss, and erelong they shall see themselves in  poignant despair. Therefore, in the beginning the believers must make  their steps firm in the Covenant so that the confirmations of Baha'u'llah  may encircle them from all sides, the cohorts of the Supreme Concourse may  become their supporters and helpers, and the exhortations and advices of  'Abdu'l-Baha, like unto the pictures engraved on stone, may remain  permanent and ineffaceable in the tablets of all hearts.    9 The second condition: Fellowship and love amongst the believers. The  divine friends must be attracted to and enamored of each other and ever be  ready and willing to sacrifice their own lives for each other. Should one  soul from amongst the believers meet another, it must be as though a  thirsty one with parched lips has reached to the fountain of the water of  life, or a lover has met his true beloved. For one of the greatest divine  wisdoms regarding the appearance of the holy Manifestations is this: The  souls may come to know each other and become intimate with each other; the  power of the love of God may make all of them the waves of one sea, the  flowers of one rose garden, and the stars of one heaven. This is the  wisdom for the appearance of the holy Manifestations! When the most great  bestowal reveals itself in the hearts of the believers, the world of  nature will be transformed, the darkness of the contingent being will  vanish, and heavenly illumination will be obtained. Then the whole world  will become the Paradise of Abha, every one of the believers of God will  become a blessed tree, producing wonderful fruits.    10 O ye friends! Fellowship, fellowship! Love, love! Unity, unity!--so that  the power of the Baha'i Cause may appear and become manifest in the world  of existence. My thoughts are turned towards you, and my heart leaps  within me at your mention. Could ye know how my soul glows with your love,  so great a happiness would flood your hearts as to cause you to become  enamored with each other.    11 The third condition: Teachers must continually travel to all parts of  the continent, nay, rather, to all parts of the world, but they must  travel like 'Abdu'l-Baha, who journeyed throughout the cities of America.  He was sanctified and free from every attachment and in the utmost  severance. Just as His Holiness Christ says: Shake off the very dust from  your feet.(13)    12 You have observed that while in America many souls in the utmost of  supplication and entreaty desired to offer some gifts, but this servant,  in accord with the exhortations and behests of the Blessed Perfection,  never accepted a thing, although on certain occasions we were in most  straitened circumstances. But on the other hand, if a soul for the sake of  God, voluntarily and out of his pure desire, wishes to offer a  contribution (toward the expenses of a teacher) in order to make the  contributor happy, the teacher may accept a small sum, but must live with  the utmost contentment.    13 The aim is this: The intention of the teacher must be pure, his heart  independent, his spirit attracted, his thought at peace, his resolution  firm, his magnanimity exalted and in the love of God a shining torch.  Should he become as such, his sanctified breath will even affect the rock;  otherwise there will be no result whatsoever. As long as a soul is not  perfected, how can he efface the defects of others? Unless he is detached  from aught else save God, how can he teach severance to others?    14 In short, O ye believers of God! Endeavor ye, so that you may take hold  of every means in the promulgation of the religion of God and the  diffusion of the fragrances of God.    15 Amongst other things is the holding of the meetings for teaching so  that blessed souls and the old ones from amongst the believers may gather  together the youths of the love of God in schools of instruction and teach  them all the divine proofs and irrefragable arguments, explain and  elucidate the history of the Cause, and interpret also the prophecies and  proofs which are recorded and are extant in the divine books and epistles  regarding the manifestation of the Promised One, so that the young ones  may go in perfect knowledge in all these degrees.    16 Likewise, whenever it is possible a committee must be organized for the  translation of the Tablets. Wise souls who have mastered and studied  perfectly the Persian, Arabic, and other foreign languages, or know one of  the foreign languages, must commence translating Tablets and books  containing the proofs of this Revelation, and publishing those books,  circulate them throughout the five continents of the globe.    17 Similarly, the magazine, the Star of the West, must be edited with the  utmost regularity, but its contents must be the promulgation of the Cause  of God that both East and West may become informed of the most important  events.    18 In short, in all the meetings, whether public or private, nothing  should be discussed save that which is under consideration, and all the  articles be centered around the Cause of God. Promiscuous talk must not be  dragged in and contention is absolutely forbidden.    19 The teachers traveling in different directions must know the language  of the country in which they will enter. For example, a person being  proficient in the Japanese language may travel to Japan, or a person  knowing the Chinese language may hasten to China, and so forth.    20 In short, after this universal war, the people have obtained  extraordinary capacity to hearken to the divine teachings, for the wisdom  of this war is this: That it may become proven to all that the fire of war  is world-consuming, whereas the rays of peace are world-enlightening. One  is death, the other is life; this is extinction, that is immortality; one  is the most great calamity, the other is the most great bounty; this is  darkness, that is light; this is eternal humiliation and that is  everlasting glory; one is the destroyer of the foundation of man, the  other is the founder of the prosperity of the human race.    21 Consequently, a number of souls may arise and act in accordance with  the aforesaid conditions, and hasten to all parts of the world, especially  from America to Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia, and travel through  Japan and China. Likewise, from Germany teachers and believers may travel  to the continents of America, Africa, Japan and China; in brief, they may  travel through all the continents and islands of the globe. Thus in a  short space of time, most wonderful results will be produced, the banner  of universal peace will be waving on the apex of the world and the lights  of the oneness of the world of humanity may illumine the universe.    22 In brief, O ye believers of God! The text of the divine Book is this:  If two souls quarrel and contend about a question of the divine questions,  differing and disputing, both are wrong. The wisdom of this  incontrovertible law of God is this: That between two souls from amongst  the believers of God, no contention and dispute may arise; that they may  speak with each other with infinite amity and love. Should there appear  the least trace of controversy, they must remain silent, and both parties  must continue their discussions no longer, but ask the reality of the  question from the Interpreter. This is the irrefutable command!    23 Upon you be Baha'u'l-Abha!    Supplication"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19298"],[0,"The World Order of Bahá'u'lláh (#5)"],[1,"  specifically enjoined.    For this reason, in later generations, voices were raised in protest  against the self-appointed Authority which arrogated to itself privileges  and powers which did not emanate from the clear text of the Gospel of  Jesus Christ, and which constituted a grave departure from the spirit  which that Gospel did inculcate. They argued with force and justification  that the canons promulgated by the Councils of the Church were not  divinely-appointed laws, but were merely human devices which did not even  rest upon the actual utterances of Jesus. Their contention centered around  the fact that the vague and inconclusive words, addressed by Christ to  Peter, \"Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church,\" could  never justify the extreme measures, the elaborate ceremonials, the  fettering creeds and dogmas, with which His successors have gradually  burdened and obscured His Faith. Had it been possible for the Church  Fathers, whose unwarranted authority was thus fiercely assailed from every  side, to refute the denunciations heaped upon them by quoting specific  utterances of Christ regarding the future administration of His Church, or  the nature of the authority of His Successors, they would surely have been  capable of quenching the flame of controversy, and preserving the unity of  Christendom. The Gospel, however, the only repository of the utterances of  Christ, afforded no such shelter to these harassed leaders of the Church,  who found themselves helpless in the face of the pitiless onslaught of  their enemy, and who eventually had to submit to the forces of schism  which invaded their ranks.    In the Muhammadan Revelation, however, although His Faith as compared with  that of Christ was, so far as the administration of His Dispensation is  concerned, more complete and more specific in its provisions, yet in the  matter of succession, it gave no written, no binding and conclusive  instructions to those whose mission was to propagate His Cause. For the  text of the Qur'an, the ordinances of which regarding prayer, fasting,  marriage, divorce, inheritance, pilgrimage, and the like, have after the  revolution of thirteen hundred years remained intact and operative, gives  no definite guidance regarding the Law of Succession, the source of all  the dissensions, the controversies, and schisms which have dismembered and  discredited Islam.    Not so with the Revelation of Baha'u'llah. Unlike the Dispensation of  Christ, unlike the Dispensation of Muhammad, unlike all the Dispensations  of the past, the apostles of Baha'u'llah in every land, wherever they  labor and toil, have before them in clear, in unequivocal and emphatic  language, all the laws, the regulations, the principles, the institutions,  the guidance, they require for the prosecution and consummation of their  task. Both in the administrative provisions of the Baha'i Dispensation,  and in the matter of succession, as embodied in the twin institutions of  the House of Justice and of the Guardianship, the followers of Baha'u'llah  can summon to their aid such irrefutable evidences of Divine Guidance that  none can resist, that none can belittle or ignore. Therein lies the  distinguishing feature of the Baha'i Revelation. Therein lies the strength  of the unity of the Faith, of the validity of a Revelation that claims not  to destroy or belittle previous Revelations, but to connect, unify, and  fulfill them. This is the reason why Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha have  both revealed and even insisted upon certain details in connection with  the Divine Economy which they have bequeathed to us, their followers. This  is why such an emphasis has been placed in their Will and Testament upon  the powers and prerogatives of the ministers of their Faith.    For nothing short of the explicit directions of their Book, and the  surprisingly emphatic language with which they have clothed the provisions  of their Will, could possibly safeguard the Faith for which they have both  so gloriously labored all their lives. Nothing short of this could protect  it from the heresies and calumnies with which denominations, peoples, and  governments have endeavored, and will, with increasing vigor, endeavor to  assail it in future.    We should also bear in mind that the distinguishing character of the  Baha'i Revelation does not solely consist in the completeness and  unquestionable validity of the Dispensation which the teachings of  Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha have established. Its excellence lies also in  the fact that those elements which in past Dispensations have, without the  least authority from their Founders, been a source of corruption and of  incalculable harm to the Faith of God, have been strictly excluded by the  clear text of Baha'u'llah's writings. Those unwarranted practices, in  connection with the sacrament of baptism, of communion, of confession of  sins, of asceticism, of priestly domination, of elaborate ceremonials, of  holy war and of polygamy, have one and all been rigidly suppressed by the  Pen of Baha'u'llah; whilst the rigidity and rigor of certain observances,  such as fasting, which are necessary to the devotional life of the  individual, have been considerably abated.          A Living Organism      It should also be borne in mind that the machinery of the Cause has been  so fashioned, that whatever is deemed necessary to incorporate into it in  order to keep it in the forefront of all progressive movements, can,  according to the provisions made by Baha'u'llah, be safely embodied  therein. To this testify the words of Baha'u'llah, as recorded in the  Eighth Leaf of the exalted Paradise: \"It is incumbent upon the Trustees of  the House of Justice to take counsel together regarding those things which  have not outwardly been revealed in the Book, and to enforce that which is  agreeable to them. God will verily inspire them with whatsoever He  willeth, and He, verily, is the Provider, the Omniscient.\" Not only has  the House of Justice been invested by Baha'u'llah with the authority to  legislate whatsoever has not been explicitly and outwardly recorded in His  holy Writ, upon it has also been conferred by the Will and Testament of  'Abdu'l-Baha the right and power to abrogate, according to the changes and  requirements of the time, whatever has been already enacted and enforced  by a preceding House of Justice. In this connection, He revealed the  following in His Will: \"And inasmuch as the House of Justice hath power to  enact laws that are not expressly recorded in the Book and bear upon daily  transactions, so also it hath power to repeal the same. Thus for example,  the House of Justice enacteth today a certain law and enforceth it, and a  hundred years hence, circumstances having profoundly changed and the  conditions having altered, another House of Justice will then have power,  according to the exigencies of the time, to alter that law. This it can do  because that law formeth no part of the divine explicit text. The House of  Justice is both the initiator and the abrogator of its own laws.\" Such is  the immutability of His revealed Word. Such is the elasticity which  characterizes the functions of His appointed ministers. The first  preserves the identity of His Faith, and guards the integrity of His law.  The second enables it, even as a living organism, to expand and adapt  itself to the needs and requirements of an ever-changing society.    Dear friends! Feeble though our Faith may now appear in the eyes of men,  who either denounce it as an offshoot of Islam, or contemptuously ignore  it as one more of those obscure sects that abound in the West, this  priceless gem of Divine Revelation, now still in its embryonic state,  shall evolve within the shell of His law, and shall forge ahead, undivided  and unimpaired, till it embraces the whole of mankind. Only those who have  already recognized the supreme station of Baha'u'llah, only those whose  hearts have been touched by His love, and have become familiar with the  potency of His spirit, can adequately appreciate the value of this Divine  Economy--His inestimable gift to mankind.    Leaders of religion, exponents of political theories, governors of human  institutions, who at present are witnessing with perplexity and dismay the  bankruptcy of their ideas, and the disintegration of their handiwork,  would do well to turn their gaze to the Revelation of Baha'u'llah, and to  meditate upon the World Order which, lying enshrined in His teachings, is  slowly and imperceptibly rising amid the welter and chaos of present-day  civilization. They need have no doubt or anxiety regarding the nature, the  origin or validity of the institutions which the adherents of the Faith  are building up throughout the world. For these lie embedded in the  teachings themselves, unadulterated and unobscured by unwarrantable  inferences, or unauthorized interpretations of His Word.    How pressing and sacred the responsibility that now weighs upon those who  are already acquainted with these teachings! How glorious the task of  those who are called upon to vindicate their truth, and demonstrate their  practicability to an unbelieving world! Nothing short of an immovable  conviction in their divine origin, and their uniqueness in the annals of  religion; nothing short of an unwavering purpose to execute and apply them  to the administrative machinery of the Cause, can be sufficient to  establish their reality, and insure their success. How vast is the  Revelation of Baha'u'llah! How great the magnitude of His blessings  showered upon humanity in this day! And yet, how poor, how inadequate our  conception of their significance and glory! This generation stands too  close to so colossal a Revelation to appreciate, in their full measure,  the infinite possibilities of His Faith, the unprecedented character of  His Cause, and the mysterious dispensations of His Providence.
