Five seconds later he was at the end of the platform, flushed but  courteous.    \"Excuse me,\" he said, \"I think--\"    \"Thank you,\" said the girl.    Garnet made his way back to his carriage.    \"They are blue,\" he said.          THE ARRIVAL    IV      From Axminster to Lyme Regis the line runs through country as pretty  as any that can be found in the island, and the train, as if in  appreciation of this fact, does not hurry over the journey. It was  late afternoon by the time the chicken farmers reached their  destination.    The arrangements for the carrying of luggage at Lyme Regis border on  the primitive. Boxes are left on the platform, and later, when he  thinks of it, a carrier looks in and conveys them down into the valley  and up the hill on the opposite side to the address written on the  labels. The owner walks. Lyme Regis is not a place for the halt and  maimed.    Ukridge led his band in the direction of the farm, which lay across  the valley, looking through woods to the sea. The place was visible  from the station, from which, indeed, standing as it did on the top of  a hill, the view was extensive.    Halfway up the slope on the other side of the valley the party left  the road and made their way across a spongy field, Ukridge explaining  that this was a short cut. They climbed through a hedge, crossed a  stream and another field, and after negotiating a difficult bank  topped with barbed wire, found themselves in a kitchen garden.    Ukridge mopped his forehead and restored his pince-nez to their  original position, from which the passage of the barbed wire had  dislodged them.    \"This is the place,\" he said. \"We have come in by the back way. It  saves time. Tired, Millie?\"    \"No, dear, thank you.\"    \"Without being tired,\" said Garnet, \"I am distinctly ready for tea.  What are the prospects?\"    \"That'll be all right,\" said Ukridge, \"don't you worry. A most  competent man, of the name of Beale, and his wife are in charge at  present. I wrote to them telling them that we were coming to-day. They  will be ready for us.\"    They were at the front door by this time. Ukridge rang the bell. The  noise reechoed through the house, but there were no answering  footsteps. He rang again. There is no mistaking the note of a bell in  an empty house. It was plain that the most competent man and his wife  were out.    \"Now what are you going to do?\" said Garnet.    Mrs. Ukridge looked at her husband with quiet confidence.    Ukridge fell back on reminiscence.    \"This,\" he said, leaning against the door and endeavoring to button  his collar at the back, \"reminds me of an afternoon in the Argentine.  Two other men and myself tried for three quarters of an hour to get  into an empty house, where there looked as if there might be something  to eat, and we'd just got the door open when the owner turned up from  behind a tree with a shotgun. It was a little difficult to explain.  There was a dog, too. We were glad to say good-by.\"    At this moment history partially repeated itself. From the other side  of the door came a dissatisfied whine, followed by a short bark.    \"Halloo,\" said Ukridge, \"Beale has a dog.\"    \"And the dog,\" said Garnet, \"will have us if we're not careful. What  are you going to do?\"    \"Let's try the back,\" said Ukridge. \"We must get in. What right,\" he  added with pathos, \"has a beastly mongrel belonging to a man I employ  to keep me out of my own house? It's a little hard. Here am I, slaving  to support Beale, and when I try to get into my house, his infernal  dog barks at me. But we will try kindness first. Let me get to the  keyhole. I will parley with the animal.\"    He put his mouth to the keyhole and roared the soothing words \"Goo'  dog!\" through it. Instantly the door shook as some heavy object hurled  itself against it. The barking rang through the house.    \"Kindness seems to be a drug in the market,\" said Garnet. \"Do you see  your way to trying a little force?\"    \"I'll tell you what we'll do,\" said Ukridge, rising. \"We'll go round  and get in at the kitchen window.\"    \"And how long are we to stay there? Till the dog dies?\"    \"I never saw such a man as you,\" protested Ukridge. \"You have a  perfect mania for looking on the dark side. The dog won't guard the  kitchen door. We shall manage to shut him up somewhere.\"    \"Oh,\" said Garnet.    \"And now let's get in and have something to eat, for goodness' sake.\"    The kitchen window proved to be insecurely latched. Ukridge flung it  open and they climbed in.    The dog, hearing the sound of voices, raced back along the passage and  flung himself at the door. He then proceeded to scratch at the panels  in the persevering way of one who feels that he is engaged upon a  business at which he is a specialist.    Inside the kitchen, Ukridge took command.    \"Never mind the dog,\" he said, \"let it scratch.\"    \"I thought,\" said Garnet, \"we were going to shut it up somewhere?\"    \"Go out and shut it into the dining room, then. Personally, I mean to  have some tea. Millie, you know how to light a fire. Garnet and I will  be collecting cups and things. When that scoundrel Beale arrives, I  shall tear him limb from limb. Deserting us like this! The man must be  a thorough fraud. He told me he was an old soldier. If this was the  sort of discipline they used to keep in his regiment, I don't wonder  that the service is going to the dogs. There goes a plate! How is the  fire getting on, Millie? I'll chop Beale into little bits. What's that  you've got there, Garny, old horse? Tea? Good! Where's the bread?  There! Another plate. Look here, I'll give that dog three minutes, and  if it doesn't stop scratching that door by then, I'll take the bread  knife and go out and have a soul-to-soul talk with it. It's a little  hard. My own house, and the first thing I find in it when I arrive is  somebody else's beastly dog scratching holes in the doors. Stop it,  you beast!\"    The dog's reply was to continue his operations _piu mosso_.    Ukridge's eyes gleamed behind their glasses.    \"Give me a good large jug,\" he said with ominous calm.    He took the largest of the jugs from the dresser and strode with it  into the scullery, whence came the sound of running water. He returned  carrying the jug in both hands. His mien was that of a general who  sees his way to a master stroke of strategy.    \"Garny, old horse,\" he said, \"tack on to the handle, and when I give  the word fling wide the gates. Then watch that beast beyond the door  get the surprise of its lifetime.\"    Garnet attached himself to the handle as directed. Ukridge gave the  word. They had a momentary vision of an excited dog of the mongrel  class framed in the open doorway, all eyes and teeth; then the passage  was occupied by a spreading pool, and indignant barks from the  distance told that the mongrel was thinking the thing over in some  safe retreat.    \"Settled _his_ hash,\" said Ukridge complacently. \"Nothing like  resource, Garnet, my boy. Some men would have gone on letting a good  door be ruined.\"    \"And spoiled the dog for a ha-porth of water,\" said Garnet. \"I suppose  we shall have to clean up that mess some time.\"    \"There you go,\" said Ukridge, \"looking on the dark side. Be an  optimist, my boy, be an optimist. Beale and Mrs. Beale shall clean  that passage as a penance. How is the fire, Millie?\"    \"The kettle is just boiling, dear.\"    Over a cup of tea Ukridge became the man of business.    [Illustration: They had a momentary vision of an excited dog, framed  in the doorway.]    \"I wonder when those fowls are going to arrive. They should have been  here to-day. If they don't come to-morrow, I shall lodge a complaint.  There must be no slackness. They must bustle about. After tea I'll  show you the garden, and we will choose a place for a fowl run.  To-morrow we must buckle to. Serious work will begin immediately after  breakfast.\"    \"Suppose,\" said Garnet, \"the fowls arrive before we are ready for  them?\"    \"Why, then, they must wait.\"    \"But you can't keep fowls cooped up indefinitely in a crate. I suppose  they will come in a crate. I don't know much about these things.\"    \"Oh, that'll be all right. There's a basement to this house. We'll let  'em run about there till we're ready for them. There's always a way of  doing things if you look for it.\"    \"I hope you are going to let the hens hatch some of the eggs,  Stanley, dear,\" said Mrs. Ukridge. \"I should so love to have some dear  little chickens.\"    \"Of course,\" said Ukridge. \"My idea was this: These people will send  us fifty fowls of sorts. That means--call it forty eggs a day. Let 'em  hatch out thirty a day, and we will use the other ten for the table.  We shall want at least ten. Well, I'm hanged, that dog again! Where's  that jug?\"    But this time an unforeseen interruption prevented the maneuver from  being the success it had been before. Garnet had turned the handle,  and was just about to pull the door open, while Ukridge, looking like  some modern and dilapidated version of Discobolus, stood beside him  with his jug poised, when a hoarse voice spoke from the window.    \"Stand still!\" said the voice, \"or I'll corpse you.\"    Garnet dropped the handle, Ukridge dropped the jug, Mrs. Ukridge  screamed.    At the window, with a double-barreled gun in his hands, stood a short,  square, red-headed man. The muzzle of his gun, which rested on the  sill, was pointing in a straight line at the third button of Garnet's  waistcoat. With a distant recollection of the Deadwood Dick literature  of his childhood, Garnet flung both hands above his head.    Ukridge emitted a roar like that of a hungry lion.    \"Beale!\" he shouted. \"You scoundrelly, unprincipled blackguard! What  are you doing with that gun? Why were you out? What have you been  doing? Why did you shout like that? Look what you've made me do.\"    He"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20547"],[0,"Stories of Birds (#5)"],[1,"for the entire company to gather.  At  length on one of the blue October days we flew southward.    \"There were hundreds of birds in the flock.  We looked like a small  cloud, as we skimmed and darted through the air.  As we flew, the flock  was a half mile long.    \"We spent the winter in South America.  There are delicious insects  there.  But for all that we love the north country best.    \"By and bye Mother Nature whispered to us.  She said that it was  nest-building time in the northland.  Such a twittering and fluttering  there was when this news came.    \"That very afternoon we started north.  Day after day we flew.  We met  other great flocks as we travelled, who joined us.    \"Day after day we flew northward.  We did not stop to eat, but caught  our food on the wing.    \"Now we lunched on moths and flies.  Again we dined on grasshoppers.  Any insect foolish enough to trust itself in the air at the time we  passed served as food.    \"We arrived here only a few days ago.  It is not yet very warm, but  here under the eaves on the sunny side of the barn it is quite  comfortable.    \"We are so busy with this nest-building and settling for the summer.  You see we swallows do not live alone.  There are always flocks of us  together.    \"We should be lonely if we lived only in pairs.  That is the reason  that we build a whole little village of nests under your eaves.\"    \"You build very queer nests,\" said Phyllis.  \"They are neither like the  robin's nor the chickadee's nests.\"    \"No, indeed, no robin or chickadee could build such nests as the  swallow.  You see we make the soft mud from the brookside into little  balls and carry it in our bills.  With it we mix straws and grasses.  This holds the clay together.  When the outer clay wall is finished we  line the nest with soft grasses and feathers.\"    [Illustration: \"'No robin or chickadee could build such nests as the  swallow'\"]    \"I notice there are a great many chicken feathers in the barnyard.  I  shall line my nest with the softest, fluffiest feathers that I can find  there.    \"By and bye my little mate will sit in the dear clay nest and over four  or five or possibly six little eggs.\"    \"I shall never be able to see them,\" sighed Phyllis.  \"They are up so  high.  Tell me about them.\"    \"Oh, my eggs are beautiful,\" said the swallow.  \"They are white with  just a little rose tint.  They are spotted with fine dots of brown and  purple, and are about three-quarters of an inch long.    \"We shall probably have three broods of birdlings this summer.  What a  happy, happy time we shall have!\"    All this time the swallow was darting and wheeling and circling about  Phyllis in a most graceful manner.    \"Are you never still?\" asked Phyllis, at last.  \"I do not believe you  even stop to eat.\"    \"I do not,\" said the swallow, darting after a big blue fly.  \"I eat on  the fly.\"  And then he burst into a giggling twitter.    \"I catch nearly all my food on the wing.  No one can complain--as they  do of the robin--of our destroying fruit.    \"We do not care for fruit at all.  I would rather have a dozen nice fat  flies than all the cherries in the world!\"    \"Well,\" laughed Phyllis, \"I'd rather have a dozen ripe cherries than  all the flies in the world!\"    \"Tastes differ,\" twittered the swallow.          THE SWALLOWS    Once upon a time some Eskimo children were playing in the wet clay by  the seashore.  They were making tiny toy houses of the clay.  These  houses they fastened high on the face of the cliff.    The children chattered and laughed.  They ran gaily to and fro in their  happy play.    The people of the village heard their merry voices.  Their busy mother  paused with her long bone needle between her fingers.  She looked up  and smiled at her little ones.    \"How happy my children are to-day!\" she said, and she hummed a little  tune to herself.    \"They are very wise children!\" said a neighbour.  \"They say so many  wonderful things.  Indeed, they seem to know more of some things than  even the wise men of the village!\"    \"Yes, they are quite wonderful,\" said the mother.  \"I sometimes listen  to their chatter and watch their nimble little fingers, and I wonder  who taught them all they know.\"    \"Oh,\" said another woman, \"they do not seem so extraordinary to me.  In  fact, they look to me like little birds, flitting about in their dark  dresses.\"    \"They do look like birds!\" said the mother, gazing at the children.    \"I do believe they are birds,\" said the neighbour.    \"But the voices are my children's voices,\" said the mother, looking  again in wonder.    \"And they are still building tiny clay houses on the cliffs!\" said the  other woman.    \"But those toy clay houses are birds' nests,\" said the neighbour, \"and  those little figures darting back and forth are no longer children.  They have changed to birds!\"    \"Yes,\" said the mother, peering from under her hand.  \"Yes, those are  birds building their funny clay nests on the cliffs yonder.    \"But the birds have the happy twittering voices of my children.  You  were right.  They were wonderful children!    \"Ah, well, my only wish is that they may remain near us.  They will  cheer us and keep us from becoming lonely!\"    \"Surely that is a reasonable wish--since they are your own little  ones,\" said the neighbour.  \"I, too, hope that the little birds will  remain near our village!\"    And indeed the mother's wish was granted.  Even to this day the little  swallows do not fear man.    In fact, they still choose to build their nests near the camps of the  people.  They still fix their tiny toy houses on the faces of the sea  cliffs.          ALL ABOUT THE BARN SWALLOW    SUGGESTIONS FOR FIELD LESSONS    Comes north about first or second week in April.

Head and upper parts except forehead steel blue--tail feathers marked  with white--forehead and throat clear chestnut colour--chest and lower  body paler chestnut.    Food--chiefly insects caught while on the wing.    Nest--built chiefly of mud--chooses under eaves or cavelike places for  building--mud mixed with grasses and (one authority also asserts) a  sticky saliva from the bird's mouth.    Eggs--white, tinted a delicate rose, and speckled finely with brown and  purple.--Two or three broods in a season.          THE HAWK AND THE RAVEN    [Illustration: The Hawk]    FROM THE BARNYARD FENCE    Had not the old hen been such a watchful mother she would never have  been able to care for such a big, fluffy family.    Had not Phyllis been such a wide-awake little girl, she would have  never heard and seen all that I am about to tell you.    Mother Speckle was scratching patiently in the barnyard.  Now and again  she gave a loud call and her ten little ones ran wildly for the bug or  worm which their mother had found for them.    Phyllis was just coming into the barnyard with a cup of meal for Mother  Speckle's family, when a strange cry from the old hen startled her.    Phyllis looked and saw every chick running as fast as its little legs  could carry it to the hovering mother wings.  Soon every chicken baby  was hidden from sight and the chicken mother was clucking less loudly.    \"What can be the matter?\" cried Phyllis, and then looking up she saw a  hawk circling in the air above.    She snatched off her hat and waved it wildly at the hawk.  At the same  time she shouted as fiercely as she could.    The hawk soared calmly in the air, rising ever higher and higher.  The  mother hen, calling softly to her babies, led the little ones to the  protecting shelter of some low bushes.  Then Phyllis sprinkled the meal  and soon the chicken hawk was quite forgotten by Mother Speckle and her  brood.    But Phyllis still watched eagerly for the hawk.  She feared that he  would return.  But she could now see nothing of him.    On the fence post, not far away, sat a big black raven croaking gravely  to himself.    \"You are not a lovely bird either,\" said the little girl, but the raven  did not hear her.    When she had crept up very close to the post on which the raven sat,  Phyllis again saw the hawk sailing in wide circles nearer and nearer.    \"Caw!  Caw!\" cried the raven, rising in the air, high above the barn.  \"I, too, can sail about in circles!  Caw!  Caw!  Caw!\"    The hawk said nothing, but quietly settled on the fence post.  The  raven still circled in the air, but ever nearer.    The hawk looked up.  The raven wagged his head solemnly and uttered his  sad, harsh cry.  He shook out his black feathers and sat down again on  the post.    \"I am called the bird of ill omen,\" said the raven.  \"Some people think  that I bring bad luck.  Others think I eat too much of their corn.  No  one likes me.  No one thinks me beautiful.    \"Yet if you will look at my black coat you will see how glossy it is.  My back fairly gleams in the sunlight.  Sometimes I catch gleams of  purple and green on my wings.  See how soft and loose are the feathers  about my throat.  They make a fringe about my neck of which I am  somewhat proud.    \"I do not harm people, and I surely should not be blamed for my  appetite.  To be sure, I do eat corn and grain.  I also eat grubs,  worms, field mice, in fact anything which comes in my way.    \"I have a home up in the top of the cedar-tree.  My nest is round and  firm.  It is woven of sticks and grasses and lined with wool which I  myself pick from the sheep's back.    \"We reline the old nest and repair it beautifully every housecleaning  time.    \"My babies are good children, but they do not in fact look much like  me.  Perhaps you might think them better looking than their parents.  They are black and white.    \"Their mother says that the raven babies will outgrow the white  feathers soon.  She declares that she and I had once as many white  feathers as our babies.  It seems hard "]]]
