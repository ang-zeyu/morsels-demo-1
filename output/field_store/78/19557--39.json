He  afterwards, in company with the other pilgrims, encompassed the Kaaba and  performed the rites prescribed for the pilgrimage.    His visit to Hijaz was marked by two episodes of particular importance.  The first was the declaration of His mission and His open challenge to the  haughty Mirza Muhit-i-Kirmani, one of the most outstanding exponents of  the _Sh_ay_kh_i school, who at times went so far as to assert his  independence of the leadership of that school assumed after the death of  Siyyid Kazim by Haji Muhammad Karim _Kh_an, a redoubtable enemy of the  Babi Faith. The second was the invitation, in the form of an Epistle,  conveyed by Quddus, to the Sherif of Mecca, in which the custodian of the  House of God was called upon to embrace the truth of the new Revelation.  Absorbed in his own pursuits the Sherif however failed to respond. Seven  years later, when in the course of a conversation with a certain Haji  Niyaz-i-Ba_gh_dadi, this same Sherif was informed of the circumstances  attending the mission and martyrdom of the Prophet of _Sh_iraz, he  listened attentively to the description of those events and expressed his  indignation at the tragic fate that had overtaken Him.    The Bab's visit to Medina marked the conclusion of His pilgrimage.  Regaining Jaddih, He returned to Bu_sh_ihr, where one of His first acts  was to bid His last farewell to His fellow-traveler and disciple, and to  assure him that he would meet the Beloved of their hearts. He, moreover,  announced to him that he would be crowned with a martyr's death, and that  He Himself would subsequently suffer a similar fate at the hands of their  common foe.    The Bab's return to His native land (Safar 1261) (February- March, 1845)  was the signal for a commotion that rocked the entire country. The fire  which the declaration of His mission had lit was being fanned into flame  through the dispersal and activities of His appointed disciples. Already  within the space of less than two years it had kindled the passions of  friend and foe alike. The outbreak of the conflagration did not even await  the return to His native city of the One Who had generated it. The  implications of a Revelation, thrust so dramatically upon a race so  degenerate, so inflammable in temper, could indeed have had no other  consequence than to excite within men's bosoms the fiercest passions of  fear, of hate, of rage and envy. A Faith Whose Founder did not content  Himself with the claim to be the Gate of the Hidden Imam, Who assumed a  rank that excelled even that of the Sahibu'z-Zaman, Who regarded Himself  as the precursor of one incomparably greater than Himself, Who  peremptorily commanded not only the subjects of the _Sh_ah, but the  monarch himself, and even the kings and princes of the earth, to forsake  their all and follow Him, Who claimed to be the inheritor of the earth and  all that is therein--a Faith Whose religious doctrines, Whose ethical  standards, social principles and religious laws challenged the whole  structure of the society in which it was born, soon ranged, with startling  unanimity, the mass of the people behind their priests, and behind their  chief magistrate, with his ministers and his government, and welded them  into an opposition sworn to destroy, root and branch, the movement  initiated by One Whom they regarded as an impious and presumptuous  pretender.    With the Bab's return to _Sh_iraz the initial collision of irreconcilable  forces may be said to have commenced. Already the energetic and audacious  Mulla 'Aliy-i-Bastami, one of the Letters of the Living, \"the first to  leave the House of God (_Sh_iraz) and the first to suffer for His sake,\"  who, in the presence of one of the leading exponents of _Sh_i'ah Islam,  the far-famed _Sh_ay_kh_ Muhammad Hasan, had audaciously asserted that  from the pen of his new-found Master within the space of forty-eight  hours, verses had streamed that equalled in number those of the Qur'an,  which it took its Author twenty-three years to reveal, had been  excommunicated, chained, disgraced, imprisoned, and, in all probability,  done to death. Mulla Sadiq-i-_Kh_urasani, impelled by the injunction of  the Bab in the _Kh_asa'il-i-Sab'ih to alter the sacrosanct formula of the  a_dh_an, sounded it in its amended form before a scandalized congregation  in _Sh_iraz, and was instantly arrested, reviled, stripped of his  garments, and scourged with a thousand lashes. The villainous Husayn  _Kh_an, the Nizamu'd-Dawlih, the governor of Fars, who had read the  challenge thrown out in the Qayyumu'l-Asma, having ordered that Mulla  Sadiq together with Quddus and another believer be summarily and publicly  punished, caused their beards to be burned, their noses pierced, and  threaded with halters; then, having been led through the streets in this  disgraceful condition, they were expelled from the city.    The people of _Sh_iraz were by that time wild with excitement. A violent  controversy was raging in the masjids, the madrisihs, the bazaars, and  other public places. Peace and security were gravely imperiled. Fearful,  envious, thoroughly angered, the mullas were beginning to perceive the  seriousness of their position. The governor, greatly alarmed, ordered the  Bab to be arrested. He was brought to _Sh_iraz under escort, and, in the  presence of Husayn _Kh_an, was severely rebuked, and so violently struck  in the face that His turban fell to the ground. Upon the intervention of  the Imam-Jum'ih He was released on parole, and entrusted to the custody of  His maternal uncle Haji Mirza Siyyid 'Ali. A brief lull ensued, enabling  the captive Youth to celebrate the Naw-Ruz of that and the succeeding year  in an atmosphere of relative tranquillity in the company of His mother,  His wife, and His uncle. Meanwhile the fever that had seized His followers  was communicating itself to the members of the clergy and to the merchant  classes, and was invading the higher circles of society. Indeed, a wave of  passionate inquiry had swept the whole country, and unnumbered  congregations were listening with wonder to the testimonies eloquently and  fearlessly related by the Bab's itinerant messengers.    The commotion had assumed such proportions that the _Sh_ah, unable any  longer to ignore the situation, delegated the trusted Siyyid  Yahyay-i-Darabi, surnamed Vahid, one of the most erudite, eloquent and  influential of his subjects--a man who had committed to memory no less than  thirty thousand traditions--to investigate and report to him the true  situation. Broad-minded, highly imaginative, zealous by nature, intimately  associated with the court, he, in the course of three interviews, was  completely won over by the arguments and personality of the Bab. Their  first interview centered around the metaphysical teachings of Islam, the  most obscure passages of the Qur'an, and the traditions and prophecies of  the Imams. In the course of the second interview Vahid was astounded to  find that the questions which he had intended to submit for elucidation  had been effaced from his retentive memory, and yet, to his utter  amazement, he discovered that the Bab was answering the very questions he  had forgotten. During the third interview the circumstances attending the  revelation of the Bab's commentary on the surih of Kaw_th_ar, comprising  no less than two thousand verses, so overpowered the delegate of the  _Sh_ah that he, contenting himself with a mere written report to the Court  Chamberlain, arose forthwith to dedicate his entire life and resources to  the service of a Faith that was to requite him with the crown of martyrdom  during the Nayriz upheaval. He who had firmly resolved to confute the  arguments of an obscure siyyid of _Sh_iraz, to induce Him to abandon His  ideas, and to conduct Him to Tihran as an evidence of the ascendancy he  had achieved over Him, was made to feel, as he himself later acknowledged,  as \"lowly as the dust beneath His feet.\" Even Husayn _Kh_an, who had been  Vahid's host during his stay in _Sh_iraz, was compelled to write to the  _Sh_ah and express the conviction that his Majesty's illustrious delegate  had become a Babi.    Another famous advocate of the Cause of the Bab, even fiercer in zeal than  Vahid, and almost as eminent in rank, was Mulla Muhammad-'Aliy-i-Zanjani,  surnamed Hujjat. An A_kh_bari, a vehement controversialist, of a bold and  independent temper of mind, impatient of restraint, a man who had dared  condemn the whole ecclesiastical hierarchy from the Abvab-i-Arba'ih down  to the humblest mulla, he had more than once, through his superior talents  and fervid eloquence, publicly confounded his orthodox _Sh_i'ah  adversaries. Such a person could not remain indifferent to a Cause that  was producing so grave a cleavage among his countrymen. The disciple he  sent to _Sh_iraz to investigate the matter fell immediately under the  spell of the Bab. The perusal of but a page of the Qayyumu'l-Asma, brought  by that messenger to Hujjat, sufficed to effect such a transformation  within him that he declared, before the assembled 'ulamas of his native  city, that should the Author of that work pronounce day to be night and  the sun to be a shadow he would unhesitatingly uphold his verdict.    Yet another recruit to the ever-swelling army of the new Faith was the  eminent scholar, Mirza Ahmad-i-Az_gh_andi, the most learned, the wisest  and the most outstanding among the 'ulamas of _Kh_urasan, who, in  anticipation of the advent of the promised Qa'im, had compiled above  twelve thousand traditions and prophecies concerning the time and  character of the expected Revelation, had circulated them among His  fellow-disciples, and had encouraged them to quote them extensively to all  congregations and in all meetings.    While the situation was steadily deteriorating in the provinces, the  bitter hostility of the people of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19279"],[0,"Memorials of the Faithful (#5)"],[1," mercy, plenteous bounty, and every  blessing, as the ages and cycles roll on. His honored tomb is in Akka at  the Man_sh_iyyih.            MUHAMMAD-'ALIY-I-ISFAHANI      Muhammad-'Ali of Isfahan was among the earliest of believers, guided to  the Faith from its very beginning. He was one of the mystics; his house  was a gathering place for them, and the philosophers. Noble, high-minded,  he was one of Isfahan's most respected citizens, and served as a host and  sanctuary for every stranger, rich or poor. He had verve, an excellent  disposition, was forbearing, affable, generous, a boon companion; and it  was known throughout the city that he enjoyed a good time.    Then he was led to embrace the Faith and caught fire from the Sinaitic  Tree. His house became a teaching center, dedicated to the glory of God.  Day and night the believers flocked there, as to a lamp lit by heavenly  love. Over a long period, the sacred verses were chanted in that house and  the clear proofs set forth. Although this was widely known, Muhammad-'Ali  was not molested, because he was a kinsman of the Imam-Jum'ih of Isfahan.  Finally, however, things came to such a pass that the Imam-Jum'ih himself  sent him away, telling him: \"I can protect you no longer. You are in grave  danger. The best thing for you is to leave here, and go on a journey.\"    He left his home then, went to 'Iraq, and entered the presence of the  world's Desired One. He spent some time there, progressing every day; he  had little to live on, but was happy and content. A man of excellent  disposition, he was congenial to believers and others alike.    When Baha'u'llah and His retinue left Ba_gh_dad for Constantinople,  Muhammad-'Ali was in His company, and continued on with Him to the Land of  Mystery, Adrianople. Not one to be inconstant, he maintained his  characteristic immutability of heart. Whatever happened, he remained the  same. In Adrianople as well, his days passed happily, under the protection  of Baha'u'llah. He would carry on some business which, however trifling,  would bring in surprisingly abundant returns.    From Adrianople, Muhammad-'Ali accompanied Baha'u'llah to the fortress of  Akka, was put in jail there, and was numbered among Baha'u'llah's fellow  captives for the rest of his life, achieving that greatest of all  distinctions, to be in prison with the Blessed Beauty.    He spent his days in utter bliss. Here, too, he carried on a small  business, which occupied him from morning till noon. In the afternoons he  would take his samovar, wrap it in a dark-colored pouch made from a  saddlebag, and go off somewhere to a garden or meadow, or out in a field,  and have his tea. Sometimes he would be found at the farm of Mazra'ih, or  again in the Ridvan Garden; or, at the Mansion, he would have the honor of  attending upon Baha'u'llah.    Muhammad-'Ali would carefully consider every blessing that came his way.  \"How delicious my tea is today,\" he would comment. \"What perfume, what  color! How lovely this meadow is, and the flowers so bright!\" He used to  say that everything, even air and water, had its own special fragrance.  For him the days passed in indescribable delight. Even kings were not so  happy as this old man, the people said. \"He is completely free of the  world,\" they would declare. \"He lives in joy.\" It also happened that his  food was of the very best, and that his home was situated in the very best  part of Akka. Gracious God! Here he was, a prisoner, and yet experiencing  comfort, peace and joy.    Muhammad-'Ali was past eighty when he finally departed to eternal light.  He had been the recipient of many Tablets from Baha'u'llah, and of endless  bounty, under all conditions. Upon him be the glory of God the Most  Glorious. Upon him be myriads of heavenly blessings; may God favor him  with gladness forever and ever. His luminous grave is in Akka.            'ABDU'S-SALIH, THE GARDENER      Among those who emigrated and were companions in the Most Great Prison was  Aqa 'Abdu's-Salih. This excellent soul, a child of early believers, came  from Isfahan. His noble-hearted father died, and this child grew up an  orphan. There was none to rear or care for him and he was the prey of  anyone who chose to do him harm. At last he became adolescent, and older  now, sought out his Well-Beloved. He emigrated to the Most Great Prison  and here, at the Ridvan, achieved the honor of being appointed gardener.  At this task he was second to none. In his faith, too, he was staunch,  loyal, worthy of trust; as to his character, he was an embodiment of the  sacred verse, \"Of a noble nature art thou.\"(12) That is how he won the  distinction of being gardener at the Ridvan, and of thus receiving the  greatest bounty of all: almost daily, he entered the presence of  Baha'u'llah.    For the Most Great Name was held prisoner and confined nine years in the  fortress-town of Akka; and at all times, both in the barracks and  afterward, from without the house, the police and farra_sh_es had Him  under constant guard. The Blessed Beauty lived in a very small house, and  He never set foot outside that narrow lodging, because His oppressors kept  continual watch at the door. When, however, nine years had elapsed, the  fixed and predetermined length of days was over; and at that time, against  the rancorous will of the tyrant, 'Abdu'l-Hamid, and all his minions,  Baha'u'llah proceeded out of the fortress with authority and might, and in  a kingly mansion beyond the city, made His home.    Although the policy of Sultan 'Abdu'l-Hamid was harsher than ever;  although he constantly insisted on his Captive's strict confinement--still,  the Blessed Beauty now lived, as everyone knows, with all power and glory.  Some of the time Baha'u'llah would spend at the Mansion, and again, at the  farm village of Mazra'ih; for a while He would sojourn in Haifa, and  occasionally His tent would be pitched on the heights of Mount Carmel.  Friends from everywhere presented themselves and gained an audience. The  people and the government authorities witnessed it all, yet no one so much  as breathed a word. And this is one of Baha'u'llah's greatest miracles:  that He, a captive, surrounded Himself with panoply and He wielded power.  The prison changed into a palace, the jail itself became a Garden of Eden.  Such a thing has not occurred in history before; no former age has seen  its like: that a man confined to a prison should move about with authority  and might; that one in chains should carry the fame of the Cause of God to  the high heavens, should win splendid victories in both East and West, and  should, by His almighty pen, subdue the world. Such is the distinguishing  feature of this supreme Theophany.    One day the government leaders, pillars of the country, the city's  'ulamas, leading mystics and intellectuals came out to the Mansion. The  Blessed Beauty paid them no attention whatever. They were not admitted to  His presence, nor did He inquire after any of them. I sat down with them  and kept them company for some hours, after which they returned whence  they had come. Although the royal farman specifically decreed that  Baha'u'llah was to be held in solitary confinement within the Akka  fortress, in a cell, under perpetual guard; that He was never to set foot  outside; that He was never even to see any of the  believers--notwithstanding such a farman, such a drastic order, His tent  was raised in majesty on the heights of Mount Carmel. What greater display  of power could there be than this, that from the very prison, the banner  of the Lord was raised aloft, and rippled out for all the world to see!  Praised be the Possessor of such majesty and might; praised be He,  weaponed with the power and the glory; praised be He, Who defeated His  foes when He lay captive in the Akka prison!    To resume: 'Abdu's-Salih lived under a fortunate star, for he regularly  came into the presence of Baha'u'llah. He enjoyed the distinction of  serving as gardener for many years, and he was at all times loyal, true,  and strong in faith. He was humble in the presence of every one of the  believers; in all that time he never hurt nor offended any one. And at the  last he left his garden and hastened to the encompassing mercy of God.    The Ancient Beauty was well pleased with 'Abdu's-Salih, and after his  ascension revealed a Visitation Tablet in his honor, also delivering an  address concerning him, which was taken down and published together with  other Scriptures.    Upon him be the glory of the All-Glorious! Upon him be God's gentleness  and favor in the Exalted Realm.            USTAD ISMA'IL      Yet another from amongst that blessed company was Ustad Isma'il, the  builder. He was the construction overseer of Farru_kh_ _Kh_an  (Aminu'd-Dawlih) in Tihran, living happily and prosperously, a man of high  standing, well regarded by all. But he lost his heart to the Faith, and  was enraptured by it, till his holy passion consumed every intervening  veil. Then he cast caution aside, and became known throughout Tihran as a  pillar of the Baha'is.    Farru_kh_ _Kh_an ably defended him at first. But as time went on, he  summoned him and said, \"Ustad, you are very dear to me and I have given  you my protection and have stood by you as best I could. But the _Sh_ah  has found out about you and you know what a bloodthirsty tyrant he is. I  am afraid that he will seize you without warning, and he will hang you.  The best thing for you is to go on a journey. Leave this country, go  somewhere else, and escape from this peril.\"    Composed, happy, Ustad gave up his work, closed his eyes to his  possessions, and left for 'Iraq, where he lived in poverty. He had  recently taken a bride, and loved her beyond measure. Her mother arrived,  and by subterfuge, obtained his permission to conduct the daughter back to  Tihran, supposedly for a visit. As soon as she reached Kirman_sh_ah, she  went to the mujtahid,"]]]
