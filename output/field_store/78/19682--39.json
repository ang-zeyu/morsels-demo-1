I  stood remote from my fellows, in an evil world peopled with the  creatures of Hassan of Aleppo.    Moved by some instinct, as that of a frightened child, I dropped  to my knees and buried my face in trembling hands.          CHAPTER VI    THE RING OF THE PROPHET      \"There is no doubt,\" said Mr. Rawson, \"that great personal danger  attaches to any contact with this relic.  It is the first time I  have been concerned with anything of the kind.\"    Mr. Bristol, of Scotland Yard, standing stiffly military by the  window, looked across at the gray-haired solicitor.  We were all  silent for a few moments.    \"My late client's wishes,\" continued Mr. Rawson, \"are explicit.  His last instructions, evidently written but a short time prior to  his death, advise me that the holy slipper of the Prophet is  contained in the locked safe at his house in Dulwich.  He was  clearly of opinion that you, Mr. Cavanagh, would incur risk--great  risk--from your possession of the key.  Since attempts have been  made upon you, murderous attempts, the late Professor Deeping, my  unfortunate client, evidently was not in error.\"    \"Mysterious outrages,\" said Bristol, \"have marked the progress of  the stolen slipper from Mecca almost to London.\"    \"I understand,\" interrupted the solicitor, \"that a fanatic known  as Hassan of Aleppo seeks to restore the relic to its former  resting-place.\"    \"That is so.\"    \"Exactly; and it accounts for the Professor's wish that the safe  should not be touched by any one but a Believer--and for his  instructions that its removal to the Antiquarian Museum and the  placing of the slipper within that institution be undertaken by a  Moslem or Moslems.\"    Bristol frowned.    \"Any one who has touched the receptacle containing the thing,\" he  said, \"has either been mutilated or murdered.  I want to apprehend  the authors of those outrages, but I fail to see why the slipper  should be put on exhibition.  Other crimes are sure to follow.\"    \"I can only pursue my instructions,\" said Mr. Rawson dryly.  \"They  are, that the work be done in such a manner as to expose all  concerned to a minimum of risk from these mysterious people; that  if possible a Moslem be employed for the purpose; and that Mr.  Cavanagh, here, shall always hold the key or keys to the case in  the museum containing the slipper.  Will you undertake to look for  some--Eastern workmen, Mr. Bristol?  In the course of your  inquiries you may possibly come across such a person.\"    \"I can try,\" replied Bristol.  \"Meanwhile, I take it, the safe must  remain at Dulwich?\"    \"Certainly.  It should be guarded.\"    \"We are guarding it and shall guard it,\" Bristol assured him.  \"I  only hope we catch someone trying to get at it!\"    Shortly afterward Bristol and I left the office, and, his duties  taking him to Scotland Yard, I returned to my chambers to survey  the position in which I now found myself.  Indeed, it was a strange  one enough, showing how great things have small beginnings; for,  as a result of a steamer acquaintance I found myself involved in a  dark business worthy of the Middle Ages.  That Professor Deeping  should have stolen one of the holy slippers of Mohammed was no  affair of mine, and that an awful being known as Hassan of Aleppo  should have pursued it did not properly enter into my concerns; yet  now, with a group of Eastern fanatics at large in England, I was  become, in a sense, the custodian of the relic.  Moreover, I  perceived that I had been chosen that I might safeguard myself.  What I knew of the matter might imperil me, but whilst I held the  key to the reliquary, and held it fast, I might hope to remain  immune though I must expect to be subjected to attempts.  It would  be my affair to come to terms.    Contemplating these things I sat, in a world of dark dreams,  unconscious of the comings and goings in the court below,  unconscious of the hum which told of busy Fleet Street so near to  me.  The weather, as is its uncomfortable habit in England, had  suddenly grown tropically hot, plunging London into the vapours of  an African spring, and the sun was streaming through my open window  fully upon the table.    I mopped my clammy forehead, glancing with distaste at the pile of  work which lay before me.  Then my eyes turned to an open quarto  book.  It was the late Professor Deeping's \"Assyrian Mythology,\"  and embodied the result of his researches into the history of the  Hashishin, the religious murderers of whose existence he had been  so skeptical.  To the Chief of the Order, the terrible Sheikh Hassan  of Aleppo, he referred as a \"fabled being\"; yet it was at the hands  of this \"fabled being\" that he had met his end!  How incredible it  all seemed.  But I knew full well how worthy of credence it was.    Then upon my gloomy musings a sound intruded--the ringing of my door  bell.  I rose from my chair with a weary sigh, went to the door,  and opened it.  An aged Oriental stood without.  He was tall and  straight, had a snow-white beard and clear-cut, handsome features.  He wore well-cut European garments and a green turban.  As I stood  staring he saluted me gravely.    \"Mr. Cavanagh?\" he asked, speaking in faultless English.    \"I am he.\"    \"I learn that the services of a Moslem workman are required.\"    \"Quite correct, sir; but you should apply at the offices of Messrs.  Rawson & Rawson, Chancery Lane.\"    The old man bowed, smiling.    \"Many thanks; I understood so much.  But, my position being a  peculiar one, I wished to speak with you--as a friend of the late  Professor.\"    I hesitated.  The old man looked harmless enough, but there was an  air of mystery about the matter which put me on my guard.    \"You will pardon me,\" I said, \"but the work is scarcely of a kind--\"    He raised his thin hand.    \"I am not undertaking it myself.  I wished to explain to you the  conditions under which I could arrange to furnish suitable porters.\"    His patient explanation disposed me to believe that he was merely  some kind of small contractor, and in any event I had nothing to  fear from this frail old man.    \"Step in, sir,\" I said, repenting of my brusquerie--and stood  aside for him.    He entered, with that Oriental meekness in which there is  something majestic.  I placed a chair for him in the study, and  reseated myself at the table.  The old man, who from the first had  kept his eyes lowered deferentially, turned to me with a gentle  gesture, as if to apologize for opening the conversation.    \"From the papers, Mr. Cavanagh,\" he began, \"I have learned of the  circumstances attending the death of Professor Deeping.  Your  papers\"--he smiled, and I thought I had never seen a smile of  such sweetness--\"your papers know all!  Now I understand why a  Moslem is required, and I understand what is required of him.  But  remembering that the object of his labours would be to place a  holy relic on exhibition for the amusement of unbelievers, can you  reasonably expect to obtain the services of one?\"    His point of view was fair enough.    \"Perhaps not,\" I replied.  \"For my own part I should wish to see  the slipper back in Mecca, or wherever it came from.  But Professor  Deeping--\"    \"Professor Deeping was a thorn in the flesh of the Faithful!\"    My visitor's voice was gravely reproachful.    \"Nevertheless his wishes must be considered,\" I said, \"and the  methods adopted by those who seek to recover the relic are such  as to alienate all sympathy.\"    \"You speak of the Hashishin?\" asked the old man.  \"Mr. Cavanagh, in  your own faith you have had those who spilled the blood of infidels  as freely!\"    \"My good sir, the existence of such an organization cannot be  tolerated today!  This survival of the dark ages must be stamped  out.  However just a cause may be, secret murder is not permissible,  as you, a man of culture, a Believer, and\"--I glanced at his  unusual turban--\"a descendant of the Prophet, must admit.\"    \"I can admit nothing against the Guardian of the Tradition, Mr.  Cavanagh!  The Prophet taught that we should smite the Infidel.  I  ask you--have you the courage of your convictions?\"    \"Perhaps; I trust so.\"    \"Then assist me to rid England of what you have called a survival  of the dark ages.  I will furnish porters to remove and carry the  safe, if you will deliver to me the key!\"    I sprang to my feet.    \"That is madness!\" I cried.  \"In the first place I should be  compromising with my conscience, and in the second place I should  be defenceless against those who might--\"    \"I have with me a written promise from one highly placed--one to  whose will Hassan of Aleppo bows!\"    My mind greatly disturbed, I watched the venerable speaker.  I had  determined now that he was some religious leader of Islam in  England, who had been deputed to approach me; and, let me add, I  was sorely tempted to accede to his proposal, for nothing would be  gained by any one if the slipper remained for ever at the museum,  whereas by conniving at its recovery by those who, after all, were  its rightful owners I should be ridding England of a weird and  undesirable visitant.    I think I should have agreed, when I remembered that the Hashishin  had murdered Professor Deeping and had mutilated others wholly  innocent of offence.  I looked across at the old man.  He had drawn  himself up to his great height, and for the first time fully  raising the lids, had fixed upon me the piercing gaze of a pair of  eagle eyes.  I started, for the aspect of this majestic figure was  entirely different from that of the old stranger who had stood  suppliant before me a moment ago.    \"It is impossible,\" I said.  \"I can come to no terms with those  who shield murderers.\"    He regarded me fixedly, but did not move.    \"Es-selam 'aleykum!\" I added (\"Peace be on you!\") closing the  interview in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21272"],[0,"The Bibliotaph, and Other People (#5)"],[1,"coffee-house  and tea-table. He annoys his daughter by sometimes calling her  'Belinda,' and astonishes his wife with his mock-heroic apostrophes to  her hood and patches. He reads his _Spectator_ at breakfast while  other people batten upon newspapers only three hours old. He smiles  over the love-letters of Richard Steele, and reverences the name and  the writings of Joseph Addison. Indeed, his devotion to Addison is so  radical that he has actually been guilty of reading _The Campaign_ and  the _Dialogue on Medals_. This gentleman hunted books one day and was  not successful. It seemed to him that on this particular afternoon the  world was stuffed with Allison's histories of Europe, and Jeffrey's  contributions to the _Edinburgh Review_. His heart was filled with  bitterness and his nostrils with dust. Books which looked inviting  turned out to be twenty-second editions. Of fifty things upon his list  not one came to light. But it was predestined that he should not go  sorrowing to his home. He pulled out from a bottom shelf two musty  octavo volumes bound in dark brown leather, and each securely tied  with a string; for the covers had been broken from the backs. The  titles were invisible, the contents a mystery. The gentleman held the  unpromising objects in his hand and meditated upon them. They might be  a treatise on conic sections, or a Latin Grammar, and again they might  be a Book. He untied the string and opened one of the volumes. Was it  a breath of summer air from Isis that swept out of those pages, which  were as white as snow in spite of the lapse of nearly two centuries?  He read the title, MUSARUM ANGLICANARUM ANALECTA. The date was 1699.  He turned to the table of contents, and his heart gave a contented  throb. There was the name he wished to see, J. Addison, Magd. Coll:  The name occurred eight times. The dejected collector had found a  clean and uncut copy of those two volumes of contemporary Latin verse  compiled by Joseph Addison, when he was a young man at Oxford, and  printed at the Sheldonian Theatre. Addison contributed eight poems to  the second volume. The bookseller was willing to take seventy-five  cents for the set, and told the gentleman as he did up the package  that he was a comfort to the trade.    That night the gentleman read _The Battle of the Pigmies and the  Cranes_, while his wife read the evening edition of the _Lurid  Paragraph_. Now he says to his friends, 'Hunt books in the most  unpromising places, but make a thorough search. You may not discover a  Koh-i-noor, but you will be pretty sure to run upon some desirable  little thing which gives you pleasure and costs but a trifle.'    One effect of this adventure upon himself is that he cannot pass a  volume which is tied with a string. He spends his days and Saturday  nights in tying and untying books with broken covers. Even the  evidence of a clearly-lettered title upon the back fails to satisfy  him. He is restless until he has made a thorough search in the body of  the volume.    The Bibliotaph's own best strokes of fortune were made in  out-of-the-way places. But some god was on his side. For at his  approach the bibliographical desert blossomed like the rose. He used  to hunt books in Texas at one period in his life; and out of Texas  would he come, bringing, so it is said, first editions of George  Borrow and Jane Austen. It was maddening to be with him at such times,  especially if one had a gift for envy.    Yet why should one envy him his money, or his unerring hand and eye?  He paid for the book, but it was yours to read and to caress so long  as you would. If he took it from you it was only that he might pass it  on to some other friend. But if that volume once started in the  direction of the great tomb of books in Westchester County, no power  on earth could avail to restore it to the light of day.    It is pleasant to meditate upon past journeys with the Bibliotaph. He  was an incomparable traveling companion, buoyant, philosophic,  incapable of fatigue, and never ill. Yet it is a tradition current,  that he, the mighty, who called himself a friend to physicians,  because he never robbed them of their time either in or out of  office-hours, once succumbed to that irritating little malady known as  car-sickness. He succumbed, but he met his fate bravely and with the  colors of his wit flying. The circumstances are these:--    There is a certain railway thoroughfare which justly prides itself  upon the beauty of its scenery. This road passes through a  hill-country, and what it gains in the picturesque it loses in that  rectilinear directness most grateful to the traveler with a sensitive  stomach. The Bibliotaph often patronized this thoroughfare, and one  day it made him sick. As the train swept around a sharp curve, he  announced his earliest symptom by saying: 'The conspicuous advantages  of this road are that one gets views of the scenery and reviews of his  meals.'    A few minutes later he suggested that the road would do well to change  its name, and hereafter be known as 'The Emetic G. and O.'    They who were with him proffered sympathy, but he refused to be  pitied. He thought he had a remedy. He discovered that by taking as  nearly as possible a reclining posture, he got temporary relief. He  kept settling more and more till at last he was nearly on his back.  Then he said: 'If it be true that the lower down we get the more  comfortable we are, the basements of Hell will have their  compensations.'    He was too ill to say much after this, but his last word, before the  final and complete extinction of his manhood, was, 'The influence of  this road is such that employees have been known involuntarily to  throw up their jobs.'    The Bibliotaph invariably excited comment and attention when he was  upon his travels. I do not think he altogether liked it. Perhaps he  neither liked it nor disliked it. He accepted the fact that he was not  as other men quite as he would have accepted any indisputable fact. He  used occasionally to express annoyance because of the discrepancy  between his reputation and appearance; in other words, because he  seemed a man of greater fame than he was. He suffered the petty  discomforts of being a personage, and enjoyed none of the advantages.  He declared that he was quite willing to be much more distinguished or  much less conspicuous. What he objected to was the Laodicean character  of his reputation as set over against the pronounced and even  startling character of his looks and manner.    He used also to note with amusement how indelible a mark certain early  ambitions and tentative studies had made upon him. People invariably  took him for a clergyman. They decided this at once and conducted  themselves accordingly. He made no protest, but observed that their  convictions as to how they should behave in his presence had  corollaries in the shape of very definite convictions as to how he  should carry himself before them. He thought that such people might be  described as moral trainers. They do not profess virtue themselves,  but they take a real pleasure in keeping you up to your profession.    The Bibliotaph had no explanation to give why he was so immediately  and invariably accounted as one in orders. He was quite sure that the  clerical look was innate, and by no means dependent upon the wearing  of a high vest or a Joseph Parker style of whisker; for once as he sat  in the hot room of a Turkish bath and in the Adamitic simplicity of  attire suitable to the temperature and the place, a gentleman who  occupied the chair nearest introduced conversation by saying, 'I beg  your pardon, sir, but are you not a clergyman?'    'This incident,' said the Bibliotaph, 'gave me a vivid sense of the  possibility of determining a man's profession by a cursory examination  of his cuticle.' Lowell's conviction about N. P. Willis was  well-founded: namely, that if it had been proper to do so, Willis  could have worn his own plain bare skin in a way to suggest that it  was a representative Broadway tailor's best work.    I imagine that few boys escape an outburst of that savage instinct for  personal adornment which expresses itself in the form of rude tattooing  upon the arms. The Bibliotaph had had his attack in early days, and  the result was a series of decorations of a highly patriotic character,  and not at all in keeping with South Kensington standards. I said to  him once, apropos of the pictures on his arms: 'You are a great  surprise to your friends in this particular.' 'Yes,' he replied, 'few  of them are aware that the volume of this Life is extra-illustrated.'    But that which he of necessity tolerated in himself he would not  tolerate in his books. They were not allowed to become pictorially  amplified. He saw no objection to inserting a rare portrait in a good  book. It did not necessarily injure the book, and it was one way of  preserving the portrait. Yet the thing was questionable, and it was  likely to prove the first step in a downward path. As to cramming a  volume with a heterogeneous mass of pictures and letters gathered from  all imaginable sources, he held the practice in abhorrence, and the  bibliographical results as fit only for the libraries of the  illiterate rich. He admitted the possibility of doing such a thing  well or ill; but at its best it was an ill thing skillfully done.    The Bibliotaph upon his travels was a noteworthy figure if only  because of the immense parcel of books with which he burdened himself.  That part of the journeying public which loves to see some new thing  puzzled itself mightily over the gentleman of full habit, who in  addition to his not inconsiderable encumbrance of flesh and luggage,  chose to carry about a shawl-strap loaded to utmost capacity with a  composite mass of books, magazines, and newspapers. It was enormously  heavy, and the way in which its component parts adhered was but a  degree"]]]
