There should be at least three witnesses, such as observe the  rites prescribed by the Sruti and the Smriti, and are of a class,  whether mixed or unmixed,[141] corresponding [with that of the person  who produces them]: otherwise,[142] any person may be a witness for  any person.    70. Women, minors, aged men,[143] gamblers, persons intoxicated,  madmen,[144] persons under suspicion of crime, stageplayers,  infidels,[145] forgers, persons who are deprived of any sense,    71. heinous offenders,[146] intimate friends,[147] parties interested  [in the suit], confederates, enemies [to either party], thieves,  violent characters, the openly wicked,[148] persons cast off [by their  friends and kin], and such like,[149] are inadmissible as witnesses.    72. Even one person,[150] being an intelligent follower of ritual  duties,[151] may, with the consent of both parties, be witness  [sufficient].    All are admissible[152] as witnesses in cases of rape, theft[153]  defamation and personal trespass.[154]    73. The judge shall thus address the witnesses, as they come up to  the plaintiff and defendant:    The worlds appointed for criminals, for atrocious criminals;[155]    74. the worlds appointed for incendiaries, for murderers of women and  children--all these shall be the portion of him who gives false  testimony!    75. Know, that whatever good has been done by thee in a hundred  former births, all shall become his whom thou defeatest by  falsehood![156]    76. That man who withholds his testimony, the monarch shall compel to  pay, on the forty-sixth day, the entire debt, as well as a fine  equivalent to a tenth of the amount.    77. The lowminded man who, although he has knowledge (of the facts),  declines to give his testimony, is, in sin, on a par with false  witnesses; so is he, in his punishment.    78. In case of conflicting testimony, what is stated by the majority  (of the witnesses) must be credited; if the numbers be equal, then  those of the witnesses who are of distinguished qualities[157] must be  credited; if again, these are in contradiction, then the most  distinguished shall be credited.[158]    79. That party (to the suit) whose assertion the witnesses have  verified, succeeds; that one whose assertion the witnesses have  disproved, is defeated.    80. Although proof has been given by witnesses, yet, if others of more  distinguished qualities or in number twice as many give opposite  testimony, the first witnesses should be held as false ones.    81. As well they who suborn as they who give false testimony are to  be severally fined in double the value of the suit:[159] a brahman,  in such case, shall be banished.[160]    82. [The witness] who, after he has been addressed[161] [by the judge,  yet] being blinded by passion, withholds his testimony,--he shall pay  eight times the [ordinary] fine: in case of a brahman, he shall  suffer banishment.[162]    83. Should it happen that the testimony of a witness must occasion the  death of a person, whatever the cast of the latter,--the witness  shall, in such case, speak untruth.[163] For their purification [after  giving such false testimony] the twice-born must make oblation to  SARASWATI.[164]    84. If any settlement have been mutually come to [between debtor and  creditor], a written instrument should be drawn up before witnesses,  the first mention being of the creditor.    85. In it should be written the date, _viz._ year, month, half month,  day, also the name, cast, family, the Veda-school, and father's name,  of each party, &c.[165]    86. This being completed, the debtor shall subscribe with his  signature [a declaration, as follows]:--\"What is written above, I, the  son of such an one, agree to.\"    87. Then the witnesses, all being equal in grade, shall, after their  fathers' names, write, with their own hands respectively: \"I, such an  one, am a witness.\"    88. And the writer shall subscribe at the foot, as follows:--\"This has  been written, at the request of both parties, by me, such an one, the  son of such an one.\"    89. An instrument, entirely in the handwriting of the party, is to be  received as proof, although it be not witnessed, unless procured by  violence or by fraud.[166]    90. Payment of a debt incurred upon a writing, is obligatory only upon  the debtor, his son, and grand-son;[167] but a pledge shall remain in  use so long as the debt is unpaid.    91. If the instrument be in a foreign country, be illegibly written,  be destroyed, faded, stolen, mutilated, burned, or torn, [the Court]  shall direct a new one to be made.    92. The authenticity of a written instrument which is doubtful, is to  be ascertained by [comparison with other] documents in the handwriting  of the party &c.,[168] by [enquiry into] the probability of its having  been obtained,[169] and [the mode of] its preparation, by [observation  of] any marks, by [enquiry of] the relation [in which the parties  stand to each other], and how the matter came about.    93. As often as the debtor makes a payment, either he shall write an  indorsement to that effect on the document, or the creditor shall give  a receipt under his hand.    94. When the debt is paid, [the debtor] shall cause the document to be  torn up, or shall have another prepared, _viz._ of discharge. If the  debt was incurred before witnesses, its payment should also be before  witnesses.[170]    95. The scales, fire, water, poison, the sacred draught--these are  the ordeals for exculpation,[171] in case of grave accusations, if the  accuser be prepared to pay a fine.    96. When it is agreed on; one of the parties shall perform [the  ordeal], the other be in readiness to pay the fine. Even without a  fine, there shall be trial by ordeal in case of treason or great  crime.    97. [The accused,] being summoned, shall, after bathing at sunrise and  fasting, be made to go through the several ordeals, in presence of the  monarch and the brahmans.    98. The scales are [the ordeal] for women, children, aged men, the  blind, the lame, brahmans, and those afflicted with disease. Fire  or water, or the seven barleycorns' weight of poison are [the ordeal]  for a Sudra.    99. For a less value than a thousand _panas_, one shall not go  through the ordeal of the [heated] iron plough-share, of poison, or of  the scales: but in case of offence against the monarch or great crime,  purifications[172] shall always be gone through.    100. When the accused has been placed in the scales by those who  understand the art of weighing, a counter-weight adjusted, and a line  drawn, he is then to be taken out [of the scales.]    101. \"O scales! made by the gods, of old, the abode of truth:  therefore do ye, propitious ones, declare the truth and liberate me  from suspicion!    102. If I be an evil-doer, then bear me down, oh mother! If I be pure,  carry me upwards!\" Thus shall he [who is to go through the ordeal]  invoke the scales.    103. The hands [of the accused] shall be inspected when rice has been  rubbed in them; after which, seven leaves of the Indian fig tree are  to be placed therein [_scil._ in his hands] and fastened round  successively with a thread.    104. \"Thou, O fire, dwellest in all created things! O purifier, in  testimony of innocence and guilt, do thou, in my hand, make known the  truth!\"    105. When he [who suffers the ordeal] has thus spoken, let a smooth  red hot iron ball, of fifty _palas_ weight, be placed upon both his  hands.    106. Carrying this, let him slowly walk across seven circles, of  sixteen fingers breadth diameter each, with an interval of the same  measure between each.    107. If, having thrown down the fireball, and being [again] rubbed  with rice, he [the accused] is unburnt, his purification is  accomplished. Should the ball during [the trial] fall down, or should  there be any doubt, he is to take [it] again.    108. \"By the power of truth, O Varuna,[173] save me!\" Thus invoking  the water, and grasping the thighs of a man standing in water up to  his navel, let him [who goes through this ordeal] submerge himself.    109. An arrow at the same instant shot [from the bow] a swift  footed-man shall [run and] fetch: should he, upon his return, see that  the body [of the accused] is still submerged, the latter is to be  exculpated.    110. \"Thou, O poison, Brahma's[174] son, art ordained for truth and  right; free me from the accusation, and be to me, by the power of  truth, a draught of immortality!\"    111. Thus speaking, he shall eat of poison produced by the Sringa  tree, of the Himalaya. Whoever is able to digest this without evil  effect, shall be declared innocent.    112. Let the judge, adoring terrible deities, and taking of the water  in which [their images] have been bathed, adjure it, and cause [the  accused] to drink off three times the contents of his palms.    113. He to whom, within fourteen days from this [ordeal], no great  calamity happens, either from the monarch or by act of God, shall  without doubt be [held] guiltless.    114. A father when making partition [of his property], can divide it  among his sons as he pleases; either giving to the eldest the best  share or in such wise that all share equally.[175]    115. If he give equal shares, such of his wives as have not received  _stridhana_ from their husband or father-in-law shall also equally  share.[176]    116. If one have means, and do not desire [to share in the paternal  estate], he shall be separated, something trifling being given to  him.[177] A distribution by a father in smaller or larger shares, if  in accordance with the Sastras, is lawful.[178]    117. After decease of the parents, let the sons make equal division  of the property and of the debts.[179] And so the daughters, of what  is left of the mother's [_stridhana_]"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21948"],[0,"Little Busybodies: The Life of Crickets, Ants, Bees, Beetles, and Other (#5)"],[1," said the guide, kindly, for the old man could guess how  hungry the lad was. \"But, first, where do you suppose the crickets and  katydids have their ears?\"    \"Near those big eyes,\" called Peter.    \"No, no, on the joint of the fore leg is a little membrane, which is  just a thinner, tighter place in the skin of the leg. There!\" Ben Gile  had the fore leg of Jack's cricket stretched under the magnifying-glass.  The children could see plainly the film of tight skin. \"Underneath the  thin, tight skin is a fine nerve which, when the air makes the skin  shake, changes the motion into sound. Mrs. Cricket listens with her fore  leg while Mr. Cricket sings his love-song to her.\"    At this the children laughed and laughed, and comical little Peter put  up his leg as if listening.    \"Here, Pete, give me your box. Do you remember what I told you about  Mrs. Locust, Betty, and the way she lays her eggs?\"    \"Yes, sir. She has four straight spines at the end of her body, and  after she has bored a hole with her body she guides the eggs in with the  four spines.\"    \"Good! Well, Mrs. Cricket wears at the end of her body a long spear. See  this cricket of Peter's. Now she bores her hole with this spear and  then guides her eggs carefully into the hole. Why, see here, Pete, what  have you got here?\"    The children gazed eagerly over the old man's shoulder.    \"My, isn't it like velvet!\" exclaimed Peter.    \"And isn't it brown!\" added Hope.    \"But look at its stumpy front legs!\" called Jack, who had forgotten his  empty stomach in the excitement about this little creature, which looked  like a cricket and yet was so different.    \"And its little beads of eyes!\" said Betty.    \"Do you know what it is?\" No one knew. \"Well, it's a mole cricket. You  rarely ever see one because they live underground and bore their way  along just like moles, leaving tiny tracks and nibbling the roots of  tender plants. You see, it doesn't need eyes any more than the mole  does. But it does need those thickened fore legs to do its underground  digging. Now, children, run out into the fields and let your crickets  go. Be careful not to hurt them. We'll have supper, and after supper  we'll catch a katydid.\"    Out ran the children. Soon they were setting the long wooden tables  under the trees with delicious trout the boys had caught, with hot  biscuits and jugs of maple syrup, with berries and cookies, with milk  from the old cow, who, contentedly chewing her cud, was looking at them  through the low crotch of a tree, and with little cakes of maple sugar  which the guide had moulded into the shape of hearts.          V    HOW KATY DID      Never did trout, cookies, and maple sugar disappear so quickly; never  were such appetites; never such laughing, and such interesting stories  told by the guide.    \"Hush!\" said Ben Gile. \"Do you hear that?\"    \"Yes,\" cried Peter.    \"What is it?\"    \"It's a katydid,\" said Betty, \"over there.\"    \"Listen, children, what does it say?\"    \"It says, 'Chic-a-chee, chic-a-chee,' over and over again,\" answered  Jack.    \"Pooh,\" interrupted Jimmie, \"it says, 'Katy did, Katy didn't!'\"    \"It says, 'Katy broke a china plate; yes, she did; no, she didn't,'\"  called Betty.    \"Yes, she did; no, she didn't!\" the children shouted, merrily, together.    \"Well,\" said the old man, \"anyway, it's all about what Katy did do and  what Katy didn't do. Probably Mr. Katy, like other good husbands in the  world, is singing of the wonderful things Katy did do and the naughty  things she didn't do. That is Mr. Katy's love-song. Ah, he finds Mrs.  Katy very charming--her beautiful wings, her gracefully waving antennae,  her knowing, shining eyes! Now, listen again. Katydid carries its  musical instrument at the base of its wing cover. On each side is a tiny  membrane and a strong vein. When the wing covers are rubbed together the  membrane speaks, and you hear--\"    \"Katy did, Katy didn't!\" shouted the children.    \"Do you think you know where they are? Well, take these lanterns\"--the  guide had lighted half a dozen--\"and find them.\"    The children scurried off, certain of a quick victory. In the woods  about the cabin you could hear them shouting: \"It's here!\" \"No, it  isn't!\" \"Where is it?\"    \"A will-o'-the-wisp,\" murmured the old man; \"may they never have a  harder one to find!\"    By-and-by the children came trotting back. They couldn't find the  katydid in any place, and they had looked everywhere.    [Illustration:  _A._ Eggs of the katydid.  _B._ A katydid.  _C._ Leg, showing katydid's ear.  _D._ Musical instrument at base of wings.]    \"Couldn't? How did you look?\" He took one of the lanterns, went to a  near-by tree, and held the lantern close to the leaves. \"Here it is!  Why, it's a great fellow!\"    The children trooped into the cabin after him, crowding to look at the  katydid.    \"I thought they were brown,\" said Hope.    \"So did I,\" echoed Betty.    \"See, you can't tell this fellow from the leaf, it is such a bright,  fresh green. Woe to the katydid if it were anything but this bright  green! Just think how easily the birds would find them. What nice salad  Katy would make for a young robin!\"    \"Do the birds eat katydids?\" asked the children, in surprise.    \"Oh yes, and they haven't any stated luncheon or supper time for doing  it. They are very informal. One time is as good as another, and the  oftener the merrier. If Katy doesn't keep very quiet and demure, like  her leafy background, whist! and Father Robin or Mother Bluebird has a  meal for the youngsters.\"    \"Is that why it doesn't sing by day?\" asked Peter.    \"They wait till the birds go to bed, I suppose. See what a comical look  this fellow has, waving its long, fine, silky antennae about. Probably  it's trying to find out what it is on, looking out for another nice  green leaf to eat. They do a lot of damage eating leaves from the  trees.\"    \"What's that?\" asked Betty, pointing to the edge of a leaf.    \"Well, you have sharp eyes,\" said the old man. \"Mrs. Katydid has laid  her eggs there. See, the eggs are rounded and flattened, and each egg  laps a little over the one in front of it. Once another man saw a row of  katydid eggs laid as neatly as could be on the edge of a clean linen  collar. I'll keep these eggs; then, in the spring, the young ones will  hatch out. They will grow and shed their skins from time to time, just  the way the locusts do. Ah, they leave so many old clothes about that  they need an old clothes man! I wish I could tell you about the katydid  I knew once upon a time who spent her days collecting old clothes, and  how she made a fortune selling them to--\"    Ben Gile paused and sighed deeply.    \"Selling them to what?\" shouted the children.    \"I can't tell that to you,\" replied the old man, shaking his head sadly.  \"It's the story of 'How Katy Did.' I have to be very careful, for Mr.  John Burroughs, who is a wiser old man than I am, says I mustn't. Lately  the scientists almost killed one man I know, and a good, clever, useful  man, for telling that story--very savage, very savage.\"    The children began to look troubled. \"Will Mr. Burroughs hurt us?\"  inquired Hope. \"My papa would--\"    \"No, no, child, you're too small. He likes something big, and he's  especially fond of the Big Stick.\"    \"Is that what he does his beating with?\" Jack's eyes were frightened.    \"He hunts with the Big Stick,\" answered the guide. \"Dear me, where are  we? It's half-past eight, and you children should have been in bed this  time long, long ago. Hurry! Skip! Get the lanterns or we'll all be  scolded.\"    And they scampered for the village, the guide driving them before him,  and all the lights waving to and fro like so many crazy fireflies.          VI    FISHING      Have you ever started off on a bright, cool morning to fish? At the last  it seems as if you would never get started, which, I suppose, is partly  the eagerness to be gone; then you do get off, only to find you've  forgot the can of worms or the salt for the luncheon-basket.    Jimmie and Betty were prancing on the lawn in front of Turtle Lodge.  Jimmie had his camera over his back and a jointed steel rod done up in a  neat little case in his hands, on his feet long rubber boots. Betty wore  a big straw hat; she carried a little rod like Jim's and a pretty little  knapsack, which held part of the luncheon. They were waiting for Jack  and Ben Gile, who were to go with them to fish a stream that lay far  back from the pond. It was to be a great day's sport. They had a creel  and a rod for Jack; for the guide they needed to take nothing, for he  had the most wonderful collection of rods and flies they had ever seen.    At last they saw him coming up the hill, Jack with him. Hastily they  kissed Mrs. Reece, and ran shouting and jumping toward the old man and  the boy, Lizzie after them, for they had left half the luncheon on the  grass. \"Faith!\" she panted, catching up with them, \"and what can you be  doing without the victuals, I'd like to know?\"    The guide took part of the bundles and Jack the rest. Off they went  gayly talking and laughing.    Soon they were following the stream, Jack catching his line and fly in  the alders almost every time he cast.    Jack was too poor ever to have had any rod except an alder stick cut  beside the stream, a short line and hook, and any worm or grasshopper he  might find. He was wonderfully proud of the rod he held. The children  meant to give it to him at the end of the summer. But Jack did not know  this good news yet.    Ben Gile led the way, and almost every time he cast his fly there was a  swirl, the end of the slender rod bent, there was a minute of  excitement, and then upon the bank lay a beautiful speckled trout. On,  on, on they went over the cool, green leaves and bright red berries of  the partridge vine, and past raspberries wherever the sun had struck in  through the heavy trees to ripen them. The stream was running more and  more"]]]
