But in the midst of their  adieus, the princess recollected what she had not thought of before.  \"Brother,\" said she, \"I had quite forgotten the accidents which attend  travellers. Who knows whether I shall ever see you again? Alight, I  beseech you, and give up this journey. I would rather be deprived of the  sight and possession of the Talking Bird, the Singing Tree, and the  Golden Water, than run the risk of never seeing you more.\"    \"Sister,\" replied Bahman, smiling at her sudden fears, \"my resolution is  fixed. The accidents you speak of befall only those who are unfortunate;  but there are more who are not so. However, as events are uncertain, and  I may fail in this undertaking, all I can do is to leave you this  knife.\"    Bahman pulling a knife from his vestband, and presenting it to the  princess in the sheath, said: \"Take this knife, sister, and give  yourself the trouble sometimes to pull it out of the sheath; while you  see it clean as it is now, it will be a sign that I am alive; but if you  find it stained with blood, then you may believe me dead and indulge me  with your prayers.\"    The princess could obtain nothing more of Bahman. He bade adieu to her  and Prince Perviz for the last time and rode away. When he got into the  road, he never turned to the right hand nor to the left, but went  directly forward toward India. The twentieth day he perceived on the  roadside a hideous old man, who sat under a tree near a thatched house,  which was his retreat from the weather.    His eyebrows were as white as snow, as was also the hair of his head;  his whiskers covered his mouth, and his beard and hair reached down to  his feet. The nails of his hands and feet were grown to an extensive  length, while a flat, broad umbrella covered his head. He had no  clothes, but only a mat thrown round his body. This old man was a  dervish for so many years retired from the world to give himself up  entirely to the service of God that at last he had become what we have  described.    Prince Bahman, who had been all that morning very attentive, to see if  he could meet with anybody who could give him information of the place  he was in search of, stopped when he came near the dervish, alighted, in  conformity to the directions which the devout woman had given the  Princess Periezade, and leading his horse by the bridle, advanced toward  him and saluting him, said: \"God prolong your days, good father, and  grant you the accomplishment of your desires.\"    The dervish returned the prince's salutation, but so unintelligibly that  he could not understand one word he said and Prince Bahman, perceiving  that this difficulty proceeded from the dervish's whiskers hanging over  his mouth, and unwilling to go any further without the instructions he  wanted, pulled out a pair of scissors he had about him, and having tied  his horse to a branch of the tree, said: \"Good dervish, I want to have  some talk with you, but your whiskers prevent my understanding what you  say; and if you will consent, I will cut off some part of them and of  your eyebrows, which disfigure you so much that you look more like a  bear than a man.\"    The dervish did not oppose the offer, and when the prince had cut off as  much hair as he thought fit, he perceived that the dervish had a good  complexion, and that he was not as old as he seemed. \"Good dervish,\"  said he, \"if I had a glass I would show you how young you look: you are  now a man, but before, nobody could tell what you were.\"    The kind behaviour of Prince Bahman made the dervish smile and return  his compliment. \"Sir,\" said he, \"whoever you are, I am obliged by the  good office you have performed, and am ready to show my gratitude by  doing anything in my power for you. You must have alighted here upon  some account or other. Tell me what it is, and I will endeavour to serve  you.\"    \"Good dervish,\" replied Prince Bahman, \"I am in search of the Talking  Bird, the Singing Tree, and the Golden Water; I know these three  rarities are not far from hence, but cannot tell exactly the place where  they are to be found; if you know, I conjure you to show me the way,  that I may not lose my labour after so long a journey.\"    The prince, while he spoke, observed that the dervish changed  countenance, held down his eyes, looked very serious, and remained  silent, which obliged him to say to him again: \"Good father, tell me  whether you know what I ask you, that I may not lose my time, but inform  myself somewhere else.\"    At last the dervish broke silence. \"Sir,\" said he to Prince Bahman, \"I  know the way you ask of me; but the regard which I conceived for you the  first moment I saw you, and which is grown stronger by the service you  have done me, kept me in suspense as to whether I should give you the  satisfaction you desire.\" \"What motive can hinder you?\" replied the  prince; \"and what difficulties do you find in so doing?\" \"I will tell  you,\" replied the dervish; \"the danger to which you are going to expose  yourself is greater than you may suppose. A number of gentlemen of as  much bravery as you can possibly possess have passed this way, and asked  me the same question. When I had used all my endeavours to persuade them  to desist, they would not believe me; at last I yielded to their  importunities; I was compelled to show them the way, and I can assure  you they have all perished, for I have not seen one come back.  Therefore, if you have any regard for your life, take my advice, go no  farther, but return home.\"    Prince Bahman persisted in his resolution. \"I will not suppose,\" said he  to the dervish, \"but that your advice is sincere. I am obliged to you  for the friendship you express for me; but whatever may be the danger,  nothing shall make me change my intention: whoever attacks me, I am well  armed, and can say I am as brave as any one.\" \"But they who will attack  you are not to be seen,\" replied the dervish; \"how will you defend  yourself against invisible persons?\" \"It is no matter,\" answered the  prince, \"all you say shall not persuade me to do anything contrary to my  duty. Since you know the way, I conjure you once more to inform me.\"    When the dervish found he could not prevail upon Prince Bahman, and that  he was obstinately bent to pursue his journey, notwithstanding his  friendly remonstrance, he put his hand into a bag that lay by him and  pulled out a bowl, which he presented to him. \"Since I cannot prevail on  you to attend to my advice,\" said he, \"take this bowl and when you are  on horseback throw it before you, and follow it to the foot of a  mountain, where it will stop. As soon as the bowl stops, alight, leave  your horse with the bridle over his neck, and he will stand in the same  place till you return. As you ascend you will see on your right and  left a great number of large black stones, and will hear on all sides a  confusion of voices, which will utter a thousand abuses to discourage  you, and prevent your reaching the summit of the mountain. Be not  afraid; but, above all things, do not turn your head to look behind you,  for in that instant you will be changed into such a black stone as those  you see, which are all youths who have failed in this enterprise. If you  escape the danger of which I give you but a faint idea, and get to the  top of the mountain, you will see a cage, and in that cage is the bird  you seek; ask him which are the Singing Tree and the Golden Water, and  he will tell you. I have nothing more to say; this is what you have to  do, and if you are prudent you will take my advice and not expose your  life. Consider once more while you have time that the difficulties are  almost insuperable.\"    \"I am obliged to you for your advice,\" replied Prince Bahman, after he  had received the bowl, \"but cannot follow it. However, I will endeavour  to conform myself to that part of it which bids me not to look behind  me, and I hope to come and thank you when I have obtained what I am  seeking.\" After these words, to which the dervish made no other answer  than that he should be overjoyed to see him again, the prince mounted  his horse, took leave of the dervish with a respectful salute, and threw  the bowl before him.    The bowl rolled away with as much swiftness as when Prince Bahman first  hurled it from his hand, which obliged him to put his horse to the same  pace to avoid losing sight of it, and when it had reached the foot of  the mountain it stopped. The prince alighted from his horse, laid the  bridle on his neck, and having first surveyed the mountain and seen the  black stones, began to ascend, but had not gone four steps before he  heard the voices mentioned by the dervish, though he could see nobody.  Some said: \"Where is that fool going? Where is he going? What would he  have? Do not let him pass.\" Others: \"Stop him, catch him, kill him:\" and  others with a voice like thunder: \"Thief! assassin! murderer!\" while  some in a gibing tone cried: \"No, no, do not hurt him; let the pretty  fellow pass, the cage and bird are kept for him.\"    Notwithstanding all these troublesome voices, Prince Bahman ascended  with resolution for some time, but the voices redoubled with so loud a  din, both behind and before, that at last he was seized with dread, his  legs trembled under him, he staggered, and finding that his strength  failed him, he forgot the dervish's advice, turned about to run down the  hill, and was that instant changed into a black stone; a metamorphosis  which had happened to many before him who had attempted the ascent. His  horse, likewise, underwent the same change.    From the time of Prince Bahman's departure, the Princess Periezade  always wore the knife and sheath in her girdle, and pulled it out  several times in a day, to know whether her brother was alive. She had  the consolation to understand he was in perfect health and to talk of  him frequently with Prince Perviz.

The successive Bishops of Ely, however, until the year  1836, possessed a jurisdiction of considerable importance, and had  almost sovereign authority within the district known as the Isle of  Ely, which was styled \"_The Royal Franchise or Liberty of the Bishops  of Ely_.\"    On the conversion of the abbacy into a bishopric A.D. 1109, a division  of the property and revenues took place, and the bishop took care to  protect his own interests and those of his successors, but the charge  and repairs of the church and monastery fell to the share of the prior  and monks, the bishop retaining a certain jurisdiction over them. The  County of Cambridge, with the exception of a few parishes, was  transferred from the See of Lincoln to the new See of Ely, and the  Manor of Spaldwick, in the County of Huntingdon, was given to the  Bishop of Lincoln in compensation. The See now comprises the Counties  of Cambridge, Huntingdon, and Bedford, and the western division of the  County of Suffolk, comprised in the Archdeaconry of Sudbury. It is  divided into four Archdeaconries, which are subdivided into  thirty-three Rural Deaneries, except the Isle of Ely, which is under  the peculiar Archidiaconal jurisdiction of the Bishop, and is divided  into two Rural Deaneries. There are five hundred and fifty-four  benefices in the diocese. The population of the whole is about  500,000; and the area in acres is 1,357,756.    The Bishop has patronage to a considerable extent; he appoints to the  Chancellorship, to the Registrarship, to the four Archdeaconries, the  Rural Deaneries, to four Canonries in the Cathedral, and several  Honorary Canonries; to the Mastership and one Fellowship of Jesus  College, to one Fellowship at St. John's College, to the Mastership of  St. Peter's College, and is Visitor of four Colleges, in Cambridge,  and of several schools; and has about fifty livings in his gift.           *       *       *       *       *    _Arms of the See_--Gu. three ducal coronets or.
