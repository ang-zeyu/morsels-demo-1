In time the  advantage in strength and pliability of twisted strands came to be  recognized, and this led to the general utilization of fibrous substances,  and finally to the manufacture of suitable fibers by manipulating the  bark of trees and plants. Spinning was probably not devised until  the weaver's art had made considerable advance, but its invention  opened a new and broad field and led to the development of a magnificent  industry. Semi-rigid fabrics served for a wide range of uses,  as already described, but soft and pliable cloths for personal use and  ornament were made possible only by the introduction of spinning.    On the arrival of the whites the native art was well advanced;  thread, cordage, and even ropes of considerable weight were made with  a degree of uniformity and refinement that surprises us. The finest  threads with which I am acquainted are perhaps not as fine as our no.  10 ordinary spool cotton thread, but we are not justified in assuming  that more refined work was not done. What we have is only that which  happened to be preserved through burial with the dead or by impression  on the plastic surface of clay used in the arts.    The materials employed for spinning by the aborigines were greatly  diversified. Through historical as well as through purely archeologic  sources we learn that both vegetal and animal filaments and fibers were  freely used. The inner bark of the mulberry was a favorite material,  but other fibrous barks were utilized. Wild hemp, nettles, grasses,  and other like growths furnished much of the finer fibers. The hackling  was accomplished by means of the simplest devices, such as pounding  with hammers or sticks. The hair and sinews of animals were frequently  spun into threads and woven into cloth.    A few citations from early authors will indicate sufficiently for  present purposes the methods of spinning and weaving employed by tribes  which, if not in all cases mound-builders, were at least the neighbors  and relatives of the mound-building Indians.      CLOTHS.    The character of the woven articles is to a great extent indicated in  the extracts which follow. It evidently was not customary to weave  \"piece\" goods, but rather to make separate units of costumes,  furnishing, etc., for use without cutting, fitting, and sewing. Each  piece was practically complete when it came from the frame or loom. For  clothing and personal use there were mantles, shawls, and cloaks to be  worn over one or both shoulders or about the body as described by  Hariot, Smith, the Knight of Elvas, Du Pratz, and others; there were  skirts fastened about the waist and drawn with an inserted cord or  looped over a belt; there were belts, sashes, garters, shot pouches, and  bags. For household use there were hangings, covers for various  articles, and bedclothing; there were nets for fishing and cords for  angling. Some of these extracts describe the whole group of activities  included in the practice of the art as well as the use of the products.  I have considered it preferable to quote as a unit all that is said on  the subject by each author, giving cross reference, when necessary, in  discussing particular topics under other headings.    Weaving among the Indians of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, and the  northeast is described by Kalm, De la Potherie, and others. The  following extracts are from Kalm, and will serve to indicate the status  of the art over a wide area:        _Apocynum cannabinum_ was by the Swedes called Hemp of the      Indians; and grew plentifully in old corn grounds, in woods on      hills, and in high glades. The Swedes had given it the name of      Indian hemp, because the Indians formerly, and even now, apply      it to the same purposes as the Europeans do hemp; for the      stalk may be divided into filaments, and is easily prepared.      When the Indians were yet settled among the Swedes, in      Pensylvania and New Jersey, they made ropes of this apocynum,      which the Swedes bought, and employed them as bridles, and for      nets. These ropes were stronger, and kept longer in water,      than such as were made of common hemp. The Swedes commonly got      fourteen yards of these ropes for one piece of bread. Many of      the Europeans still buy such ropes, because they last so well.      The Indians likewise make several other stuffs of their hemp.      On my journey through the country of the Iroquese, I saw the      women employed in manufacturing this hemp. They made use      neither of spinning wheels nor distaffs, but rolled the      filaments upon their bare thighs, and made thread and strings      of them, which they dyed red, yellow, black, etc., and      afterwards worked them into stuffs, with a great deal of      ingenuity. The plant is perennial, which renders the annual      planting of it altogether unnecessary. Out of the root and      stalk of this plant, when it is fresh, comes a white milky      juice, which is somewhat poisonous. Sometimes the fishing      tackle of the Indians consists entirely of this hemp. The      Europeans make no use of it, that I know of.[26]    In another place this author describes the weaving of bark fibers:        The _Direa palustris_, or Mouse-wood, is a little shrub which      grows on hills, towards swamps and marshes, and was now in      full blossom. The English in Albany call it Leather-wood,      because its bark is as tough as leather. The French in Canada      call it Bois de Plomb, or Leaden-wood because the wood itself      is as soft and as tough as lead. The bark of this shrub was      made use of for ropes, baskets, etc., by the Indians, whilst      they lived among the Swedes. And it is really very fit for      that purpose, on account of its remarkable strength, and      toughness, which is equal to that of the Lime-tree bark. The      English and the Dutch in many parts of North America, and the      French in Canada, employ this bark in all cases where we make      use of Lime-tree bark in Europe. The tree itself is very      tough, and you cannot easily separate its branches without      the help of a knife: some people employ the twigs for      rods.[27]    De la Potherie, who wrote at an earlier date than Kalm, says--        The women spin on their knees, twisting the thread with the      palm of the hand; they make this thread, which should rather      be called twine (fisselle), into little balls.[28]    Hariot, John Smith, and Adair bear witness to the primitive practice of  the art in Virginia and the Carolinas. Smith uses the following words:         Betwixt their hands and thighes, their women vse to spin,       the barkes of trees, Deere sinewes, or a kinde of grasse       they call Pemmenaw, of these they make a thread very even       and readily. This thread serveth for many vses. As about       their housing apparell, as also they make nets for fishing,       for the quantitie as formally as ours. They make also with       it lines for angles.[29]    The Cherokees and other Indians with whom Adair came in contact  preserved in their purity many of the ancient practices. The following  extracts are, therefore, of much importance to the historian of the  textile art in America:        Formerly, the Indians made very handsome carpets. They have a      wild hemp that grows about six feet high, in open, rich,      level lands, and which usually ripens in July: it is plenty      on our frontier settlements. When it is fit for use, they      pull, steep, peel, and beat it; and the old women spin it off      the distaffs, with wooden machines, having some clay on the      middle of them, to hasten the motion. When the coarse thread      is prepared, they put it into a frame about six feet square,      and instead of a shuttle, they thrust through the thread with      a long cane, having a large string through the web, which      they shift at every second course of the thread. When they      have thus finished their arduous labour, they paint each side      of the carpet with such figures, of various colours, as their      fruitful imaginations devise; particularly the images of      those birds and beasts they are acquainted with; and likewise      of themselves, acting in their social, and martial stations.      There is that due proportion and so much wild variety in the      design, that would really strike a curious eye with pleasure      and admiration. J. W--t, Esq., a most skilful linguist in the      Muskohge dialect, assures me, that time out of mind they      passed the woof with a shuttle; and they have a couple of      threddles, which they move with the hand so as to enable them      to make good dispatch, something after our manner of weaving.      This is sufficiently confirmed by their method of working      broad garters, sashes, shot pouches, broad belts, and the      like, which are decorated all over with beautiful stripes and      chequers.        The women are the chief, if not the only, manufacturers; the      men judge that if they performed that office, it would      exceedingly depreciate them. * * * In the winter season, the      women gather buffalo's hair, a sort of coarse, brown, curled      wool; and having spun it as fine as they can, and properly      doubled it, they put small beads of different colours upon      the yarn, as they work it, the figures they work in those      small webs, are generally uniform, but sometimes they      diversify them on both sides. The Choktah weave shot-pouches      which have raised work inside and outside. They likewise make      turkey feather blankets with the long feathers of the neck      and breast of that large fowl--they twist the inner end of      the feathers very fast into a strong double thread of hemp,      or the inner bark of the mulberry tree, of the size and      strength of coarse twine, as the fibres are"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19946"],[0,"Villa Elsa (#5)"],[1,"so far along as a result of a busy  adolescence, Fraeulein Elsa, as Gard discovered, was in her way not  behind. She knew English and French pretty well and was quite an  accomplished musician, able to play from memory on the winged Pleyel  almost whole books of classic music. She could paint fairly well in  oil and was now taking up etching with enthusiastic assiduity. She  could sew, cook, run the house. In brief, her days were as full as  her brothers' in propelling tasks. _She_, apparently, did not have  \"boys on the brain.\"    Kirtley threw up his hands in imitation of his venerated professor.  This was just an ordinary German miss. He had scarcely dreamed of  such things in a girl.    It was all illustrated by Gard's piano playing, which was cheap and  meaningless strumming. He could rattle through a lot of popular  tunes and stumble through a few short simple school-girl salon  pieces. The Buchers were a real orchestra. With the ladies at the  piano, the old Herr at the flute, Ernst at the violin and Rudi at  the 'cello, they could play a dozen programmes and furnish enjoyment  for the listener.    And always salutary, enlightened, cultivated music. The house  reverberated with a multitude of choice enduring arias, sung, hummed  or whistled, and this made Villa Elsa almost take on a charm for  Gard. He had not known how his melodious soul was starved.    Why should not the Germans be expected to have noble souls with all  the wealth of distinguished, inspiring music flowing through their  lives? Should it not give them necessarily a strong, desirable  spirit, fortify them in healthy aspirations, encourage them to get  the best out of existence? This incentive and pleasureableness,  making for the good, the true and the beautiful--must it not  contribute a deep richness and righteousness to the Teuton heart?    And is it to be wondered at--the Germans' big supply of red blood?  For the strength of the Teuton's body, Gard observed, was built up,  maintained, in equal measure with his other training. The military  drilling and strenuous gymnastics provided him with straight  shoulders, a full chest, a sound spine, strength of limb--in short,  good, presentable health.    The Bucher fireside had no doctor, no adored specialists, hanging  about. It had been taught to handle simple complaints itself.  Medical and surgical bills did not upset its modest financial  equilibrium. The family were extraordinarily well. Their brawn,  energetically looked after as well as the brain, accounted partly  for their marvelous appetites.    So nothing seemed to Gard to be missed in this potent scheme of  instruction and _Kultur_.          CHAPTER VI    THE HOME      Often when he peeked down from his attic window he spied the shining  bald head of the very elderly Herr Bucher surrounded by the mass of  lively colors of his rose garden. He loved to spend hours there in  the sunshine with his posies, tying up their branches, clipping  choice specimens with which he was fond of decorating the members  of Villa Elsa, its dining table, its living room. Roses, roses,  everywhere.    It was his hobby, this spot of blossoms, and in it his short, bulky  form, so whitened by his Jovian beard meerschaumed by the stains  from his huge, curving German pipe, was often almost lost to view.  He was like some droll gnome waddling about in a flower patch.  Frequently someone had to be sent to find him among all those pets  which he knew so well by their Latin and popular names and by their  characteristics. While he grumbled and so often stormed about in the  house, speaking always in gruff tones of command, he was quite sunny  out there in his plot, although still guttural and dictatorial.    He was a retired professor of phonetics and diction, but now and  then prepared a pupil. This was how he had met his wife a long, long  time before, when she was a young singer. She was twenty years his  junior and had become so completely a housewife that you could  scarcely associate her with any art. She was fat, harsh, homely,  masculine in the way of German women, an occasional long hair  sticking from her face in emulation of a beard.    Devoid of any graces of seduction, putting out her heavy fists in  every direction she exhibited a bearish kindness toward Gard that  seemed calculated at first to frighten him. She was loud-voiced,  iron-jawed. One of her favorite boasts was that she had never been  to a dentist. She pulled out her rarely aching teeth, or some one of  the family pulled them for her.    The Herr could be smoother and he assumed a fatherly solicitude over  Gard, looking out for his advantages, anxious that he should make  progress. But Bucher evidently was annoyed at times by not having  authority in the matter of the slow way in which his young guest set  about with his \"studies.\" Kirtley had not come to study, had not  been trained to study, in the German sense. It would have been  difficult to make the old man see any virtue in such desultoriness.  It doubtless proved to his mind that Americans are only half  trained, half tamed, half domesticated.    The couple surrounded Kirtley with a protection, an honesty, a  reliability, a zeal, that was as surprising as it was, on the whole,  gratifying. He felt a security he had hardly known in his own home.  If he were cheated or otherwise imposed upon anywhere in  Dresden--and this did not often happen--the Buchers were violently  up in arms about it and never ceased pursuit of the recreant until  the wrong was righted.    \"The good German name must not be tarnished.\"    In a word, they tried to treat him like a son; and so forceful and  constant were their efforts in this direction that he sometimes  wished their well-meant attentions were less formidable. The easy  American \"forget it,\" \"why bother,\" \"never again,\" were expressions  of a mood unfamiliar to them. They visibly had small patience with  such slackness which only, to their minds, encouraged lawlessness.    The setting for Gard's approaching German love affair was  appropriately picturesque and propitious. A tight little meadow,  with a grassy path wandering through by the Elbe, lay near at hand,  and beyond, at the right, a pine wood--the Waldpark--with neat  graveled walks and rustic seats where the tonic air was often to  brace his musings.    Adjacent was the small summer house, still poetically standing,  where Schiller wrote \"Don Carlos\" a century and a quarter before. A  leafy lane led from the meadow to the walled garden inclosure of  Villa Elsa, whose branches, vines and flowering bushes insisted  on making it almost a hidden retreat. The spot could not be more  _gemuetlich_--that familiar expressive word which Kirtley soon  learned to rely on amid the scant artillery of his defensive  weapons of conversational German.    Through a swinging gate in the wall, and usually to the clanging of  a bell that announced you, you entered the house on a level with the  ground. On this floor were the kitchen and dining room. Next came  the _belle etage_, with the salon and music room opening into each  other, and with another apartment or two. Above, the chambers. And  still above, the two attic rooms. All was plain but substantial.    The garden furnished not only flowers but vegetables. And in one  corner stood a table and chairs for afternoon tea with cakes or beer  with cheese. Here the ever-busy sewing and knitting mainly went on  in summer, and a forgotten book, half read, was usually left by some  one of the young folks. There was a drowsy, old-fashioned air about  the premises that recalled illustrations in some of the editions of  Grimm's fairy tales.    Aside from the abundance of bound music, Gard had been far from  expecting that fine examples of art and literature would be so  meagerly represented in this representative German home. There  were poor pictures of Bismarck, of William the Second, and of  his grandfather aping the appearance of Gambrinus.    Prominent also were steel engravings of Saxon and Prussian kings of  whom Kirtley had never heard. But there they were, conspicuous  household gods, with fierce, epic miens and lordly bodies,  surrounded by wreaths of glory and Latin texts, and supported by  cannon pointed at the observer with menaces of angry welcome. And  not to be forgotten were the august thrones, avenging swords of  royalty, and the dark swirling clouds suggesting the German Olympus.    \"It all harmonizes with the arsenal down in the entrance,\"  muttered Gard.    As for books, he was taken at an angle still more unexpected and  significant. Goethe and Schiller and the other old Teuton classics,  breathing of liberalness and freedom--figures that had always stood  out in the world as leading exponents and guardians of a cultured  enlightenment--were only present in the Bucher home in the form of  musty, unused volumes.    These authors, who were so loved, advocated and expounded in  American colleges and whom Kirtley had come to Germany to know  better and to worship, were scarcely ever mentioned. He was  astonished to find that the Germans thought little of them. And  Heine likewise, that naughty child of the Vaterland! At the Buchers  the presentable red and gilt edition of his poems was kept in  Fraeulein's escritoire in her room.    American education, Gard began to realize, was somehow on the wrong  track here. It was trying to cultivate a Germany that no longer  seemed to exist. It was diligently teaching and acclaiming Teutons  who were repudiated in their own land. It was separating the spirit  and taste of the two peoples instead of bringing them together.    The books that were in evidence in Villa Elsa were a new lot,  excepting the great and formidable Nietschke. Kirtley had never  heard of the Treitschkes and Bernhardis and Hartmanns, whom the  Buchers were reading and quoting.    From what he made out, these and similar authorities were insisting  mightily on German"]]]
