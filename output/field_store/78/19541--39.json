Then Jansen laughed, and the red line of the caravan gathered in a tight  knot. \"Camped at a spring,\" he announced, \"but with plenty of sentries  out.\" Red sparks showed briefly beyond that center core. \"And they'll  have to stay there for all of me. We could keep this up till doomsday,  and nobody would crack.\"    \"No\"--Hodaki contradicted him--\"someday one of you will make a little  mistake and then----\"    \"And then whatever bully boys you're running will clobber us?\" asked  Jansen. \"That'll be the day! Anyway, truce for now.\"    \"Granted!\"    The lights of the arena went on and the plains vanished into a dark,  tiled floor. \"Any time you want a return engagement it'll be fine with  me,\" said Ashe, getting up.    Jansen grinned. \"Put that off for a month or so, Gordon. We push into  time tomorrow. Take care of yourselves, you two. I don't want to have to  break in another set of players when I come back.\"    Ross, finding it difficult to shake off the illusion which had held him  entranced, felt a slight touch on his shoulder and glanced up. Kurt  stood behind him, apparently intent upon Jansen and Hodaki as they  argued over some point of the game.    \"See you tonight.\" The boy's lips hardly moved, a trick Ross knew from  his own past. Yes, he _would_ see Kurt tonight, or whenever he could. He  was going to learn what it was this odd company seemed determined to  keep as their own private secret.          CHAPTER 3      Ross stood cautiously against the wall of his darkened room, his head  turned toward the slightly open door. A slight shuffling sound had  awakened him, and he was now as ready as a cat before her spring. But he  did not hurl himself at the figure now easing the door farther open. He  waited until the visitor was approaching the bunk before he slid along  the wall, closing the door and putting his shoulders against it.    \"What's the pitch?\" Ross demanded in a whisper.    There was a ragged breath, maybe two, then a little laugh out of the  dark. \"You are ready?\" The visitor's accent left no doubt as to his  identity. Kurt was paying him the promised visit.    \"Did you think that I wouldn't be?\"    \"No.\" The dim figure sat without invitation on the edge of the bunk. \"I  would not be here otherwise, Murdock. You are plenty ... have plenty on  the ball. You see, I have heard things about you. Like me, you were  tricked into this game. Tell me, is it not true that you saw Hardy  tonight.\"    \"You hear a lot, don't you?\" Ross was noncommittal.    \"I hear, I see, I learn more than these big mouths, like the major with  all his do's and don'ts. That I can tell you! You saw Hardy. Do _you_  want to be a Hardy?\"    \"Is there any danger of that?\"    \"Danger!\" Kurt snorted. \"Danger--you have not yet known the meaning of  danger, little man. Not until now. I ask you again, do you want to end  like Hardy? They have not yet looped you in with all their big talk.  That is why I came here tonight. If you know what is good for you,  Murdock, you will make a break before they tape you----\"    \"Tape me?\"    Kurt's laugh was full of anger, not amusement. \"Oh, yes. They have many  tricks here. They are big brains, eggheads, all of them with their  favorite gadgets. They put you through a machine to get you registered  on a tape. Then, my boy, you cannot get outside the base without ringing  all the alarms! Neat, eh? So if you want to make a break, you must try  it before they tape you.\"    Ross did not trust Kurt, but he was listening to him attentively. The  other's argument sounded convincing to one whose general ignorance of  science led him to be as fearful of the whole field as his ancestors had  been of black magic. As all his generation, he was conditioned to  believe that all kinds of weird inventions were entirely possible and  probable--usually to be produced in some dim future, but perhaps today.    \"They must have you taped,\" Ross pointed out.    Kurt laughed again, but this time he was amused. \"They believe that they  have. Only they are not as smart as they believe, the major and the  rest, including Millaird! No, I have a fighting chance to get out of  this place, only I cannot do it alone. That is why I have been waiting  for them to bring in a new guy I could get to before they had him pinned  down for good. You are tough, Murdock. I saw your record, and I'm  betting that you did not come here with the intention of staying.  So--here is your chance to go along with one who knows the ropes. You  will not have such a good one again.\"    The longer Kurt talked, the more convincing he was. Ross lost a few of  his suspicions. It was true that he had come prepared to run at the  first possible opportunity, and if Kurt had everything planned, so much  the better. Of course, it was possible that Kurt was a stool pigeon,  leading him on as a test. But that was a chance Ross would have to take.    \"Look here, Murdock, maybe you think it's easy to break out of here. Do  you know where we are, boy? We're near enough to the North Pole as makes  no difference! Are you going to leg it back some hundreds of miles  through thick ice and snow? A nice jaunt if you make it. I do not think  that you can--not without plans and a partner who knows what he is  about.\"    \"And how _do_ we go? Steal one of those atomjets? I'm no pilot--are  you?\"    \"They have other things besides a-j's here. This place is strictly  hush-hush. Even the a-j's do not set down too often for fear they will  be tracked by radar. Where have you been, boy? Don't you know the Reds  are circling around up here? These fellows watch for Red activity, and  the Reds watch them. They play it under the table on both sides. We get  our supplies overland by cats----\"    \"Cats?\"    \"Snow sleds, like tractors,\" the other answered impatiently. \"Our stuff  is dumped miles to the south, and the cats go down once a month to bring  it back. There's no trick to driving a cat, and they tear off the  miles----\"    \"How many miles to the south?\" inquired Ross skeptically. Granted Kurt  was speaking the truth, travel over an arctic wilderness in a stolen  machine was risky, to say the least. Ross had only a very vague idea of  the polar regions, but he was sure that they could easily swallow up the  unwary forever.    \"Maybe only a hundred or so, boy. But I have more than one plan, and I'm  willing to risk _my_ neck. Do you think I intend to start out blind?\"    There was that, of course. Ross had early sized up his visitor as one  who was first of all interested in his own welfare. He wouldn't risk his  neck without a definite plan in mind.    \"Well, what do you say, Murdock? Are you with me or not?\"    \"I'll take some time to chew it over----\"    \"Time is what you do not have, boy. Tomorrow they will tape you.  Then--no over the wall for you.\"    \"Suppose you tell me your trick for fooling the tape,\" Ross countered.    \"That I cannot do, seeing as how it lies in the way my brain is put  together. Do you think I can break open my skull and hand you a piece of  what is inside? No, you jump with me tonight or else I must wait to grab  the next one who lands here.\"    Kurt stood up. His last words were spoken matter-of-factly, and Ross  believed he meant exactly what he said. But Ross hesitated. He wanted to  try for freedom, a desire fed by his suspicions of what was going on  here. He neither liked nor trusted Kurt, but he thought he understood  him--better than he understood Ashe or the others. Also, with Kurt he  was sure he could hold his own; it would be the kind of struggle he had  experienced before.    \"Tonight....\" he repeated slowly.    \"Yes, tonight!\" There was new eagerness in Kurt's voice, for he sensed  that the other was wavering. \"I have been preparing for a long time, but  there must be two of us. We have to take turns driving the cat. There  can be no rest until we are far to the south. I tell you it will be  easy. There are food caches arranged along the route for emergencies. I  have a map marked to show where they are. Are you coming?\"    When Ross did not answer at once the other moved closer to him.    \"Remember Hardy? He was not the first, and he will not be the last. They  use us up fast here. That is why they brought you so quickly. I tell  you, it is better to take your chance with me than on a run.\"    \"And what is a run?\"    \"So they have not yet briefed you? Well, a run is a little jaunt back  into history--not nice comfortable history such as you learned out of a  book when you were a little kid. No, you are dropped back into some  savage time before history----\"    \"That's impossible!\"    \"Yes? You saw those two big blond boys tonight, did you not? Why do you  suppose they sport those braids? Because they are taking a little trip  into the time when he-men wore braids, and carried axes big enough to  crack a man open! And Hodaki and his partner.... Ever hear of the  Tartars? Maybe you have not, but once they nearly overran most of  Europe.\"    Ross swallowed. He now knew where he had seen braids pictured on  warriors--the Vikings! And Tartars, yes, that movie about someone named  Khan, Genghis Khan! But to return into the past was impossible.    Yet, he remembered the picture he had watched today with the wolf slayer  and the shaggy-haired man who wore skins. Neither of these was of his  own world! Could Kurt be telling the truth? Ross's vivid memory of the  scene he had witnessed made Kurt's story more convincing.    \"Suppose you get sent back to a time where they do not like strangers,\"  Kurt continued. \"Then you are in for it. That is what happened to Hardy.  And it is not good--not good at all!\"    \"But why?\"    Kurt snorted. \"_That_ they do not tell you until just before you take  your first run. I do not want to know why. But I do know that I am not  going to be sent into any wilderness where a savage may run a spear  through me just to prove something or other for Major John"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19164"],[0,"Lectures on Art, Delivered Before the University of Oxford in Hilary Term, 1870 (#5)"],[1,"in the arts is, compared to what we might have had if we had  cared for them, just what that engraving is to the lost drawing. You  will find also that its subject has meaning in it which will not be  harmful to you. The second example is a real drawing by Turner, in the  same series, and very nearly of the same place; the two scenes are  within a quarter of a mile of each other. It will show you the character  of the work that was destroyed. It will show you, in process of time,  much more; but chiefly, and this is my main reason for choosing both, it  will be a permanent expression to you of what English landscape was  once;--and must, if we are to remain a nation, be again.    I think it farther right to tell you, for otherwise you might hardly pay  regard enough to work apparently so simple, that by a chance which is  not altogether displeasing to me, this drawing, which it has become, for  these reasons, necessary for me to give you, is--not indeed the best I  have, (I have several as good, though none better)--but, of all I have,  the one I had least mind to part with.    The third example is also a Turner drawing--a scene on the Loire--never  engraved. It is an introduction to the series of the Loire, which you  have already; it has in its present place a due concurrence with the  expressional purpose of its companions; and though small, it is very  precious, being a faultless, and, I believe, unsurpassable example of  water-colour painting.    Chiefly, however, remember the object of these three first examples is  to give you an index to your truest feelings about European, and  especially about your native landscape, as it is pensive and historical;  and so far as you yourselves make any effort at its representation, to  give you a motive for fidelity in handwork more animating than any  connected with mere success in the art itself.      26. With respect to actual methods of practice, I will not incur the  responsibility of determining them for you. We will take Lionardo's  treatise on painting for our first text-book; and I think you need not  fear being misled by me if I ask you to do only what Lionardo bids, or  what will be necessary to enable you to do his bidding. But you need not  possess the book, nor read it through. I will translate the pieces to  the authority of which I shall appeal; and, in process of time, by  analysis of this fragmentary treatise, show you some characters not  usually understood of the simplicity as well as subtlety common to most  great workmen of that age. Afterwards we will collect the instructions  of other undisputed masters, till we have obtained a code of laws  clearly resting on the consent of antiquity.    While, however, I thus in some measure limit for the present the methods  of your practice, I shall endeavour to make the courses of my University  lectures as wide in their range as my knowledge will permit. The range  so conceded will be narrow enough; but I believe that my proper function  is not to acquaint you with the general history, but with the essential  principles of art; and with its history only when it has been both great  and good, or where some special excellence of it requires examination of  the causes to which it must be ascribed.      27. But if either our work, or our enquiries, are to be indeed  successful in their own field, they must be connected with others of a  sterner character. Now listen to me, if I have in these past details  lost or burdened your attention; for this is what I have chiefly to say  to you. The art of any country is _the exponent of its social and  political virtues_. I will show you that it is so in some detail, in the  second of my subsequent course of lectures; meantime accept this as one  of the things, and the most important of all things, I can positively  declare to you. The art, or general productive and formative energy, of  any country, is an exact exponent of its ethical life. You can have  noble art only from noble persons, associated under laws fitted to their  time and circumstances. And the best skill that any teacher of art could  spend here in your help, would not end in enabling you even so much as  rightly to draw the water-lilies in the Cherwell (and though it did, the  work when done would not be worth the lilies themselves) unless both he  and you were seeking, as I trust we shall together seek, in the laws  which regulate the finest industries, the clue to the laws which  regulate _all_ industries, and in better obedience to which we shall  actually have henceforward to live: not merely in compliance with our  own sense of what is right, but under the weight of quite literal  necessity. For the trades by which the British people has believed it to  be the highest of destinies to maintain itself, cannot now long remain  undisputed in its hands; its unemployed poor are daily becoming more  violently criminal; and a certain distress in the middle classes,  arising, _partly from their vanity in living always up to their incomes,  and partly from their folly in imagining that they can subsist in  idleness upon usury_, will at last compel the sons and daughters of  English families to acquaint themselves with the principles of  providential economy; and to learn that food can only be got out of the  ground, and competence only secured by frugality; and that although it  is not possible for all to be occupied in the highest arts, nor for any,  guiltlessly, to pass their days in a succession of pleasures, the most  perfect mental culture possible to men is founded on their useful  energies, and their best arts and brightest happiness are consistent,  and consistent only, with their virtue.      28. This, I repeat, gentlemen, will soon become manifest to those among  us, and there are yet many, who are honest-hearted. And the future fate  of England depends upon the position they then take, and on their  courage in maintaining it.    There is a destiny now possible to us--the highest ever set before a  nation to be accepted or refused. We are still undegenerate in race; a  race mingled of the best northern blood. We are not yet dissolute in  temper, but still have the firmness to govern, and the grace to obey. We  have been taught a religion of pure mercy, which we must either now  betray, or learn to defend by fulfilling. And we are rich in an  inheritance of honour, bequeathed to us through a thousand years of  noble history, which it should be our daily thirst to increase with  splendid avarice, so that Englishmen, if it be a sin to covet honour,  should be the most offending souls alive. Within the last few years we  have had the laws of natural science opened to us with a rapidity which  has been blinding by its brightness; and means of transit and  communication given to us, which have made but one kingdom of the  habitable globe. One kingdom;--but who is to be its king? Is there to be  no king in it, think you, and every man to do that which is right in his  own eyes? Or only kings of terror, and the obscene empires of Mammon  and Belial? Or will you, youths of England, make your country again a  royal throne of kings; a sceptred isle, for all the world a source of  light, a centre of peace; mistress of Learning and of the  Arts;--faithful guardian of great memories in the midst of irreverent  and ephemeral visions;--faithful servant of time-tried principles, under  temptation from fond experiments and licentious desires; and amidst the  cruel and clamorous jealousies of the nations, worshipped in her strange  valour of goodwill towards men?      29. \"Vexilla regis prodeunt.\" Yes, but of which king? There are the two  oriflammes; which shall we plant on the farthest islands,--the one that  floats in heavenly fire, or that hangs heavy with foul tissue of  terrestrial gold? There is indeed a course of beneficent glory open to  us, such as never was yet offered to any poor group of mortal souls. But  it must be--it _is_ with us, now, \"Reign or Die.\" And if it shall be  said of this country, \"Fece per viltate, il gran rifiuto;\" that refusal  of the crown will be, of all yet recorded in history, the shamefullest  and most untimely.    And this is what she must either do, or perish: she must found colonies  as fast and as far as she is able, formed of her most energetic and  worthiest men;--seizing every piece of fruitful waste ground she can set  her foot on, and there teaching these her colonists that their chief  virtue is to be fidelity to their country, and that their first aim is  to be to advance the power of England by land and sea: and that, though  they live on a distant plot of ground, they are no more to consider  themselves therefore disfranchised from their native land, than the  sailors of her fleets do, because they float on distant waves. So that  literally, these colonies must be fastened fleets; and every man of them  must be under authority of captains and officers, whose better command  is to be over fields and streets instead of ships of the line; and  England, in these her motionless navies (or, in the true and mightiest  sense, motionless _churches_, ruled by pilots on the Galilean lake of  all the world), is to \"expect every man to do his duty;\" recognising  that duty is indeed possible no less in peace than war; and that if we  can get men, for little pay, to cast themselves against cannon-mouths  for love of England, we may find men also who will plough and sow for  her, who will behave kindly and righteously for her, who will bring up  their children to love her, and who will gladden themselves in the  brightness of her glory, more than in all the light of tropic skies.    But that they may be able to do this, she must make her own majesty  stainless; she must give them thoughts of their home of which they can  be proud. The England who is to be mistress of half the earth, cannot  remain herself a heap of cinders, trampled by contending and miserable  crowds;"]]]
