[Illustration: Fig. 15.]    A plan very commonly employed is that of radiating main lines all  diverging from one central point. Fig. 17 shows a design following this  principle; there is infinite variety in the ways in which this may be  carried out.    [Illustration: Fig. 16.]    [Illustration: Fig. 17.]    Another method would be to plan a continuous flowing line with forms  branching out on one side or on both. Figs. 18 and 19 are border  designs, for which purpose this arrangement is often used, though it can  also well form an all-over pattern; sometimes these lines used over a  surface are made to cross each other, tartan wise, by running in two  directions, producing an apparently complicated design by very simple  means.    [Illustration: Figs. 18 and 19.]    [Illustration: Fig. 20.]    Designs may be planned on the counterchange principle. This is a system  of mass designing that involves the problem of making a pattern out of  one shape, continually repeated, and fitting into itself in such a way  as to leave no interstices. The simplest example of this is to be found  in the chess board, and it will easily be seen that a great number of  shapes might be used instead of the square. Fig. 20 is an example of a  counterchange design carried out in inlay; for this method of work  counterchange is very suitable. On reference to the chapter upon this  work another example will be found (page 181). Fig. 21 illustrates the  same principle, further complicated by the repetition of the form in  three directions instead of in two only.    [Illustration: Fig. 21.]    A method of further enriching a straightforward pattern, covering a  plain surface, is to work a subsidiary pattern upon the background. This  is usually of a monotonous and formal character in order not to clash  with the primary decoration, though this relationship may sometimes be  found reversed. It has the appearance of being some decoration belonging  to the ground rather than to the primary pattern; in its simplest form  it appears as a mere repeating dot or a lattice (see fig. 22), but it  may be so elaborated as to cover with an intricate design every portion  of the exposed ground not decorated with the main pattern.    Many other distinct kinds of work might be mentioned, such as needlework  pictures, the story-telling embroideries that can be made so  particularly attractive. Embroidered landscapes, formal gardens,  mysterious woods, views of towns and palaces, are, if rightly treated,  very fine. In order to learn the way to work such subjects we must go to  the XVIth and XVIIth century _petit point_ pictures, and to the detail  in fine tapestries. The wrong method of going to work is to imitate the  effect sought after by the painter.    [Illustration: Fig. 22.]    It is a mistake in embroidery design to be too naturalistic. In painting  it may be the especial aim to exactly imitate nature, but here are  wanted embroidery flowers, animals and figures, possessing the character  and likeness of the things represented, but in no way trying to make us  believe that they are real. The semblance of a bumble bee crawling upon  the tea cloth gives a hardly pleasant sensation and much savours of  the practical joke, which is seldom in good taste; the needle, however,  adds convention to almost anything, and will usually manage the bee all  right unless the worker goes out of the way to add a shadow and a high  light. Such things as perspective, light and shade or modelling of form,  should all be very much simplified if not avoided, for embroidery  conforms to the requirements of decoration and must not falsify the  surface that it ornaments. Shading is made use of in order to give more  variety to, and exhibit the beauty of, colour by means of gradation, to  explain more clearly the design, and so on; it is not employed for the  purpose of fixing the lighting of the composition from one point by  means of systematically adjusted light and shade, or of making a form  stand out so realistically as to almost project from the background.    In avoiding too much resemblance to natural forms it is not necessary to  make things ugly; a conventional flower implies no unmeaning  straightness or impossible curve, it may keep all its interesting  characteristics, but it has to obey other requirements specially  necessary in the particular design. Another point to be noted is that,  since there is freedom of choice of flowers and other objects, only  those perfect and well-formed should be chosen; all accidents of growth  and disease may, happily, be omitted; if anything of this kind is put in  it helps to give the naturalistic look which is to be avoided. Both  sides of a leaf should match, though it may happen in nature, through  misfortune, that one is deformed and small.    In figure work, which, though ambitious, is one of the most interesting  kinds of embroidery, the figures, like all other things, must be treated  with a certain amount of simplicity; very little attempt must be made to  obtain flesh tones, roundness of form, perspective, or foreshortening.  The work should be just sufficiently near to nature to be a good  embroidery rendering of it. However, without overstepping the limits  there is a great deal that may be expressed, such things as character,  gesture, grace, colour, and so on, matters which are after all of first  importance. Detail, if of the right kind, may be filled in, but it is  wrong to attempt what is to the craft very laborious to obtain, for  this would be misdirected energy, which is great waste. A right use of  the figure can be seen in the XIIIth century embroidery pictures, which,  covering mediaeval church vestments, often display episodes from the  lives of the saints. These are some of the masterpieces of the art of  embroidery; observation of nature is carried to a marvellous pitch, but  the execution never sinks into commonplace realism.    Certain restrictions are always present, in making a design, that must  be conformed to, such as, the limit of space, the materials with which  the work is to be carried out, the use to which it will be put, and so  on. These, instead of being difficulties, can afford help in the way of  suggestion and limitation. A bad design may look as if it obeyed them  unwillingly--a form is perhaps cramped, perhaps stretched out in order  to fit its place, instead of looking as if it naturally fitted it  whether the confining lines were there or not. In the early herbals,  illustrated with woodcuts, examples can be found over and over again of  a flower filling a required space simply and well; fig. 23 is taken from  the herbal of Carolus Clusius, printed at Antwerp in 1601 by the great  house of Plantin. The draughtsman in this case had to draw a plant to  fit a standard-sized engraver's block, and he had a certain number of  facts to tell about it; he drew the plant as simply and  straightforwardly as possible, making good use of all the available  space, the result being a well-planned and balanced piece of work, with  no affectation or unnecessary lines about it.    [Illustration: Fig. 23.]    Fine colour is a quality appreciated at first sight, though often  unconsciously. It is a difficult subject to speak of very definitely; an  eye for colour is natural to some, but in any case the faculty can be  cultivated and developed. By way of studying the subject, we can go to  nature and learn as much as we are capable of appreciating; even such  things as butterflies, shells, and birds' eggs are suggestive. Again,  embroideries, illuminated manuscripts, pictures, painted decoration, may  be studied, and so on; in fact, colour is so universal that it is not  possible to get away from it. Unfortunately we are sometimes forced to  learn what to avoid as well as what to emulate.    Colour is entirely relative, that is to say it depends upon its  immediate surroundings for what it appears to be. Also it has effects  varying with the material which it dyes; wool is of an absorbent nature,  whereas silk has powers of reflection. It is a safe plan to use true  colours, real blue, red or green, not slate, terra cotta, and olive.  Gold, silver, white and black, are valuable additions to the colour  palette; it should be remembered about the former that precious things  must be used with economy or they become cheap and perhaps vulgar.    [Illustration: Fig. 24.]    For getting satisfactory colour there is a useful method which can at  times be made use of; this is to stitch it down in alternate lines of  two different tints, which, seen together at a little distance, give the  desired effect. Backgrounds can be covered over with some small  geometrical pattern carried out in this way, such as is shown in fig.  24, perhaps using in alternation bright blue and black instead of a  single medium tint of blue all over. At a slight distance the tone may  be the same in either case, but this method gives a pleasantly varied  and refined effect, which avoids muddiness, and shows up the pattern  better. This same method is used for expressing form more clearly as  well as for colour; waves of hair, for instance, are much more clearly  expressed when worked in this way.          CHAPTER IV    STITCHES      Introduction--Chain Stitch--Zigzag Chain--Chequered Chain--Twisted    Chain--Open Chain--Braid Stitch--Cable Chain--Knotted Chain--Split    Stitch.      It is necessary for every worker to have a certain amount of knowledge  of stitches, for they are, so to speak, the language of the art, and  though not of first importance, still there is a great deal in  stitchery. The needlewoman should be absolute master of her needle, for  there is a great charm in beautifully carried out stitching; also a good  design can be made mechanical and uninteresting by a wrong method of  execution. The simplest and most common stitches are the best, and are  all that are necessary for "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20387"],[0,"A Thin Ghost and Others (#5)"],[1,"ow; I never saw it opened, but I do know that it's locked.'  'Well, I should have it looked into, and, if you had time, I own to  having some curiosity to see the place myself.' 'I didn't exactly like  to ask you, but that's rather what I hoped you'd say. Name your time  and I'll take you there.' 'No time like the present,' I said at once,  for I saw he would never settle down to anything while this affair was  in suspense. He got up with great alacrity, and looked at me, I am  tempted to think, with marked approval. 'Come along,' was all he said,  however; and was pretty silent all the way to his house. My Mary (as  he calls her in public, and I in private) was summoned, and we  proceeded to the room. The Doctor had gone so far as to tell her that  he had had something of a fright there last night, of what nature he  had not yet divulged; but now he pointed out and described, very  briefly, the incidents of his progress. When we were near the  important spot, he pulled up, and allowed me to pass on. 'There's the  room,' he said. 'Go in, Spearman, and tell us what you find.' Whatever  I might have felt at midnight, noonday I was sure would keep back  anything sinister, and I flung the door open with an air and stepped  in. It was a well-lighted room, with its large window on the right,  though not, I thought, a very airy one. The principal piece of  furniture was the gaunt old press of dark wood. There was, too, a  four-post bedstead, a mere skeleton which could hide nothing, and  there was a chest of drawers. On the window-sill and the floor near it  were the dead bodies of many hundred sawflies, and one torpid one  which I had some satisfaction in killing. I tried the door of the  press, but could not open it: the drawers, too, were locked.  Somewhere, I was conscious, there was a faint rustling sound, but I  could not locate it, and when I made my report to those outside, I  said nothing of it. But, I said, clearly the next thing was to see  what was in those locked receptacles. Uncle Oldys turned to Mary.  'Mrs. Maple,' he said, and Mary ran off--no one, I am sure, steps like  her--and soon came back at a soberer pace, with an elderly lady of  discreet aspect.    \"'Have you the keys of these things, Mrs. Maple?' said Uncle Oldys.  His simple words let loose a torrent (not violent, but copious) of  speech: had she been a shade or two higher in the social scale, Mrs.  Maple might have stood as the model for Miss Bates.    \"'Oh, Doctor, and Miss, and you too, sir,' she said, acknowledging my  presence with a bend, 'them keys! who was that again that come when  first we took over things in this house--a gentleman in business it  was, and I gave him his luncheon in the small parlour on account of us  not having everything as we should like to see it in the large  one--chicken, and apple-pie, and a glass of madeira--dear, dear,  you'll say I'm running on, Miss Mary; but I only mention it to bring  back my recollection; and there it comes--Gardner, just the same as it  did last week with the artichokes and the text of the sermon. Now that  Mr. Gardner, every key I got from him were labelled to itself, and  each and every one was a key of some door or another in this house,  and sometimes two; and when I say door, my meaning is door of a room,  not like such a press as this is. Yes, Miss Mary, I know full well,  and I'm just making it clear to your uncle and you too, sir. But now  there _was_ a box which this same gentleman he give over into my  charge, and thinking no harm after he was gone I took the liberty,  knowing it was your uncle's property, to rattle it: and unless I'm  most surprisingly deceived, in that box there was keys, but what keys,  that, Doctor, is known Elsewhere, for open the box, no that I would  not do.'    \"I wondered that Uncle Oldys remained as quiet as he did under this  address. Mary, I knew, was amused by it, and he probably had been  taught by experience that it was useless to break in upon it. At any  rate he did not, but merely said at the end, 'Have you that box handy,  Mrs. Maple? If so, you might bring it here.' Mrs. Maple pointed her  finger at him, either in accusation or in gloomy triumph. 'There,' she  said, 'was I to choose out the very words out of your mouth, Doctor,  them would be the ones. And if I've took it to my own rebuke one  half-a-dozen times, it's been nearer fifty. Laid awake I have in my  bed, sat down in my chair I have, the same you and Miss Mary gave me  the day I was twenty year in your service, and no person could desire  a better--yes, Miss Mary, but it _is_ the truth, and well we know who  it is would have it different if he could. \"All very well,\" says I to  myself, \"but pray, when the Doctor calls you to account for that box,  what are you going to say?\" No, Doctor, if you was some masters I've  heard of and I was some servants I could name, I should have an easy  task before me, but things being, humanly speaking, what they are, the  one course open to me is just to say to you that without Miss Mary  comes to my room and helps me to my recollection, which her wits  _may_ manage what's slipped beyond mine, no such box as that, small  though it be, will cross your eyes this many a day to come.'    \"'Why, dear Mrs. Maple, why didn't you tell me before that you wanted  me to help you to find it?' said my Mary. 'No, never mind telling me  why it was: let us come at once and look for it.' They hastened off  together. I could hear Mrs. Maple beginning an explanation which, I  doubt not, lasted into the furthest recesses of the housekeeper's  department. Uncle Oldys and I were left alone. 'A valuable servant,'  he said, nodding towards the door. 'Nothing goes wrong under her: the  speeches are seldom over three minutes.' 'How will Miss Oldys manage  to make her remember about the box?' I asked.    \"'Mary? Oh, she'll make her sit down and ask her about her aunt's last  illness, or who gave her the china dog on the mantel-piece--something  quite off the point. Then, as Maple says, one thing brings up another,  and the right one will come round sooner than you could suppose.  There! I believe I hear them coming back already.'    \"It was indeed so, and Mrs. Maple was hurrying on ahead of Mary with  the box in her outstretched hand, and a beaming face. 'What was it,'  she cried as she drew near, 'what was it as I said, before ever I come  out of Dorsetshire to this place? Not that I'm a Dorset woman myself,  nor had need to be. \"Safe bind, safe find,\" and there it was in the  place where I'd put it--what?--two months back, I daresay.' She handed  it to Uncle Oldys, and he and I examined it with some interest, so  that I ceased to pay attention to Mrs. Ann Maple for the moment,  though I know that she went on to expound exactly where the box had  been, and in what way Mary had helped to refresh her memory on the  subject.    \"It was an oldish box, tied with pink tape and sealed, and on the lid  was pasted a label inscribed in old ink, 'The Senior Prebendary's  House, Whitminster.' On being opened it was found to contain two keys  of moderate size, and a paper, on which, in the same hand as the  label, was 'Keys of the Press and Box of Drawers standing in the  disused Chamber.' Also this: 'The Effects in this Press and Box are  held by me, and to be held by my successors in the Residence, in trust  for the noble Family of Kildonan, if claim be made by any survivor of  it. I having made all the Enquiry possible to myself am of the  opinion that that noble House is wholly extinct: the last Earl having  been, as is notorious, cast away at sea, and his only Child and Heire  deceas'd in my House (the Papers as to which melancholy Casualty were  by me repos'd in the same Press in this year of our Lord 1753, 21  March). I am further of opinion that unless grave discomfort arise,  such persons, not being of the Family of Kildonan, as shall become  possess'd of these keys, will be well advised to leave matters as they  are: which opinion I do not express without weighty and sufficient  reason; and am Happy to have my Judgment confirm'd by the other  Members of this College and Church who are conversant with the Events  referr'd to in this Paper. Tho. Ashton, _S.T.P._, _Praeb. senr._ Will.  Blake, _S.T.P._, _Decanus_. Hen. Goodman, _S.T.B._, _Praeb. junr._'    \"'Ah!' said Uncle Oldys, 'grave discomfort! So he thought there might  be something. I suspect it was that young man,' he went on, pointing  with the key to the line about the 'only Child and Heire.' 'Eh, Mary?  The viscounty of Kildonan was Saul.' 'How _do_ you know that, Uncle?'  said Mary. 'Oh, why not? it's all in Debrett--two little fat books.  But I meant the tomb by the lime walk. He's there. What's the story, I  wonder? Do you know it, Mrs. Maple? and, by the way, look at your  sawflies by the window there.'    \"Mrs. Maple, thus confronted with two subjects at once, was a little  put to it to do justice to both. It was no doubt rash in Uncle Oldys  to give her the opportunity. I could only guess that he had some  slight hesitation about using the key he held in his hand.    \"'Oh them flies, how bad they was, Doctor and Miss, this three or four  days: and you, too, sir, you wouldn't guess, none of you! And how they  come, too! First we took the room in hand, the shutters was up, and  had been, I daresay, years upon years, and not a fly to be seen. Then  we got the shutter bars down with a deal of trouble and left it so for  the day, and next day I sent Susan in with the broom to sweep about,  and not two minutes hadn't passed when out she come into the hall like  a blind thing, and we had regular to beat them off her. Why her cap  and her hair, you couldn't see the colour of it, I do assure you, and  all clustering round her eyes, too. Fortunate enough she's not a girl  with fancies, else if it had been me, why only the tickling of the  nasty things would have drove me out of my wits. And now there they  lay"]]]
