If he could understand about David the Substitute, now,  without being told, as I understood. If he could wake in my place on  Sabbath morning, and feel his heart break in him with a strange pain,  because a Jew had dishonored the law of Moses, and God was bending  down to pardon him. Oh, why could I not make Vanka understand? I was  so sorry that my heart hurt me, worse than Vanka's blows. My anger and  my courage were gone. Vanka was throwing stones at me now from his  mother's doorway, and I continued on my errand, but I did not hurry.  The thing that hurt me most I could not run away from.    There was one thing the Gentiles always understood, and that was  money. They would take any kind of bribe at any time. Peace cost so  much a year in Polotzk. If you did not keep on good terms with your  Gentile neighbors, they had a hundred ways of molesting you. If you  chased their pigs when they came rooting up your garden, or objected  to their children maltreating your children, they might complain  against you to the police, stuffing their case with false accusations  and false witnesses. If you had not made friends with the police, the  case might go to court; and there you lost before the trial was  called, unless the judge had reason to befriend you. The cheapest way  to live in Polotzk was to pay as you went along. Even a little girl  understood that, in Polotzk.    Perhaps your parents were in business,--usually they were, as almost  everybody kept store,--and you heard a great deal about the chief of  police, and excise officers, and other agents of the Czar. Between the  Czar whom you had never seen, and the policeman whom you knew too  well, you pictured to yourself a long row of officials of all sorts,  all with their palms stretched out to receive your father's money. You  knew your father hated them all, but you saw him smile and bend as he  filled those greedy palms. You did the same, in your petty way, when  you saw Vanka coming toward you on a lonely street, and you held out  to him the core of the apple you had been chewing, and forced your  unwilling lips into a smile. It hurt, that false smile; it made you  feel black inside.    In your father's parlor hung a large colored portrait of Alexander  III. The Czar was a cruel tyrant,--oh, it was whispered when doors  were locked and shutters tightly barred, at night,--he was a Titus, a  Haman, a sworn foe of all Jews,--and yet his portrait was seen in a  place of honor in your father's house. You knew why. It looked well  when police or government officers came on business.    You went out to play one morning, and saw a little knot of people  gathered around a lamp-post. There was a notice on it--a new order  from the chief of police. You pushed into the crowd, and stared at the  placard, but you could not read. A woman with a ragged shawl looked  down upon you, and said, with a bitter kind of smile, \"Rejoice,  rejoice, little girl! The chief of police bids you rejoice. There  shall be a pretty flag flying from every housetop to-day, because it  is the Czar's birthday, and we must celebrate. Come and watch the poor  people pawn their samovars and candlesticks, to raise money for a  pretty flag. It is a holiday, little girl. Rejoice!\"    You know the woman is mocking,--you are familiar with the quality of  that smile,--but you accept the hint and go and watch the people buy  their flags. Your cousin keeps a dry-goods store, where you have a  fine view of the proceedings. There is a crowd around the counter, and  your cousin and the assistant are busily measuring off lengths of  cloth, red, and blue, and white.    \"How much does it take?\" somebody asks. \"May I know no more of sin  than I know of flags,\" another replies. \"How is it put together?\" \"Do  you have to have all three colors?\" One customer puts down a few  kopecks on the counter, saying, \"Give me a piece of flag. This is all  the money I have. Give me the red and the blue; I'll tear up my shirt  for the white.\"    You know it is no joke. The flag must show from every house, or the  owner will be dragged to the police station, to pay a fine of  twenty-five rubles. What happened to the old woman who lives in that  tumble-down shanty over the way? It was that other time when flags  were ordered up, because the Grand Duke was to visit Polotzk. The old  woman had no flag, and no money. She hoped the policeman would not  notice her miserable hut. But he did, the vigilant one, and he went up  and kicked the door open with his great boot, and he took the last  pillow from the bed, and sold it, and hoisted a flag above the rotten  roof. I knew the old woman well, with her one watery eye and her  crumpled hands. I often took a plate of soup to her from our kitchen.  There was nothing but rags left on her bed, when the policeman had  taken the pillow.    The Czar always got his dues, no matter if it ruined a family. There  was a poor locksmith who owed the Czar three hundred rubles, because  his brother had escaped from Russia before serving his term in the  army. There was no such fine for Gentiles, only for Jews; and the  whole family was liable. Now, the locksmith never could have so much  money, and he had no valuables to pawn. The police came and attached  his household goods, everything he had, including his young bride's  trousseau; and the sale of the goods brought thirty-five rubles. After  a year's time the police came again, looking for the balance of the  Czar's dues. They put their seal on everything they found. The bride  was in bed with her first baby, a boy. The circumcision was to be next  day. The police did not leave a sheet to wrap the child in when he is  handed up for the operation.    Many bitter sayings came to your ears if you were a Jewish little girl  in Polotzk. \"It is a false world,\" you heard, and you knew it was so,  looking at the Czar's portrait, and at the flags. \"Never tell a police  officer the truth,\" was another saying, and you knew it was good  advice. That fine of three hundred rubles was a sentence of lifelong  slavery for the poor locksmith, unless he freed himself by some trick.  As fast as he could collect a few rags and sticks, the police would be  after them. He might hide under a false name, if he could get away  from Polotzk on a false passport; or he might bribe the proper  officials to issue a false certificate of the missing brother's death.  Only by false means could he secure peace for himself and his family,  as long as the Czar was after his dues.    It was bewildering to hear how many kinds of duties and taxes we owed  the Czar. We paid taxes on our houses, and taxes on the rents from the  houses, taxes on our business, taxes on our profits. I am not sure  whether there were taxes on our losses. The town collected taxes, and  the county, and the central government; and the chief of police we had  always with us. There were taxes for public works, but rotten  pavements went on rotting year after year; and when a bridge was to be  built, special taxes were levied. A bridge, by the way, was not always  a public highway. A railroad bridge across the Dvina, while open to  the military, could be used by the people only by individual  permission.    My uncle explained to me all about the excise duties on tobacco.  Tobacco being a source of government revenue, there was a heavy tax on  it. Cigarettes were taxed at every step of their process. The tobacco  was taxed separately, and the paper, and the mouthpiece, and on the  finished product an additional tax was put. There was no tax on the  smoke. The Czar must have overlooked it.    Business really did not pay when the price of goods was so swollen by  taxes that the people could not buy. The only way to make business pay  was to cheat--cheat the Government of part of the duties. But playing  tricks on the Czar was dangerous, with so many spies watching his  interests. People who sold cigarettes without the government seal got  more gray hairs than bank notes out of their business. The constant  risk, the worry, the dread of a police raid in the night, and the  ruinous fines, in case of detection, left very little margin of profit  or comfort to the dealer in contraband goods. \"But what can one do?\"  the people said, with the shrug of the shoulders that expresses the  helplessness of the Pale. \"What can one do? One must live.\"    It was not easy to live, with such bitter competition as the  congestion of population made inevitable. There were ten times as many  stores as there should have been, ten times as many tailors, cobblers,  barbers, tinsmiths. A Gentile, if he failed in Polotzk, could go  elsewhere, where there was less competition. A Jew could make the  circle of the Pale, only to find the same conditions as at home.  Outside the Pale he could only go to certain designated localities, on  payment of prohibitive fees, augmented by a constant stream of bribes;  and even then he lived at the mercy of the local chief of police.    Artisans had the right to reside outside the Pale, on fulfilment of  certain conditions. This sounded easy to me, when I was a little girl,  till I realized how it worked. There was a capmaker who had duly  qualified, by passing an examination and paying for his trade papers,  to live in a certain city. The chief of police suddenly took it into  his head to impeach the genuineness of his papers. The capmaker was  obliged to travel to St. Petersburg, where he had qualified in the  first place, to repeat the examination. He spent the savings of years  in petty bribes, trying to hasten the process, but was detained ten  months by bureaucratic red tape. When at length he returned to his  home town, he found a new chief of police, installed during his  absence, who discovered a new flaw in the papers he had just obtained,  and expelled him from the city. If he came to Polotzk, there were then  eleven capmakers where"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20897"],[0,"A Short History of England (#5)"],[1," dwell exclusively on documents, and take no note of  tradition at all. Wild as would be the results of credulity concerning  all the old wives' tales, it would not be so wild as the errors that can  arise from trusting to written evidence when there is not enough of it.  Now the whole written evidence for the first parts of our history would  go into a small book. A very few details are mentioned, and none are  explained. A fact thus standing alone, without the key of contemporary  thought, may be very much more misleading than any fable. To know what  word an archaic scribe wrote without being sure of what thing he meant,  may produce a result that is literally mad. Thus, for instance, it would  be unwise to accept literally the tale that St. Helena was not only a  native of Colchester, but was a daughter of Old King Cole. But it would  not be very unwise; not so unwise as some things that are deduced from  documents. The natives of Colchester certainly did honour to St. Helena,  and might have had a king named Cole. According to the more serious  story, the saint's father was an innkeeper; and the only recorded action  of Cole is well within the resources of that calling. It would not be  nearly so unwise as to deduce from the written word, as some critic of  the future may do, that the natives of Colchester were oysters.          IV    THE DEFEAT OF THE BARBARIANS      It is a quaint accident that we employ the word \"short-sighted\" as a  condemnation; but not the word \"long-sighted,\" which we should probably  use, if at all, as a compliment. Yet the one is as much a malady of  vision as the other. We rightly say, in rebuke of a small-minded  modernity, that it is very short-sighted to be indifferent to all that  is historic. But it is as disastrously long-sighted to be interested  only in what is prehistoric. And this disaster has befallen a large  proportion of the learned who grope in the darkness of unrecorded epochs  for the roots of their favourite race or races. The wars, the  enslavements, the primitive marriage customs, the colossal migrations  and massacres upon which their theories repose, are no part of history  or even of legend. And rather than trust with entire simplicity to these  it would be infinitely wiser to trust to legend of the loosest and most  local sort. In any case, it is as well to record even so simple a  conclusion as that what is prehistoric is unhistorical.    But there is another way in which common sense can be brought to the  criticism of some prodigious racial theories. To employ the same  figure, suppose the scientific historians explain the historic centuries  in terms of a prehistoric division between short-sighted and  long-sighted men. They could cite their instances and illustrations.  They would certainly explain the curiosity of language I mentioned  first, as showing that the short-sighted were the conquered race, and  their name therefore a term of contempt. They could give us very graphic  pictures of the rude tribal war. They could show how the long-sighted  people were always cut to pieces in hand-to-hand struggles with axe and  knife; until, with the invention of bows and arrows, the advantage  veered to the long-sighted, and their enemies were shot down in droves.  I could easily write a ruthless romance about it, and still more easily  a ruthless anthropological theory. According to that thesis which refers  all moral to material changes, they could explain the tradition that old  people grow conservative in politics by the well-known fact that old  people grow more long-sighted. But I think there might be one thing  about this theory which would stump us, and might even, if it be  possible, stump them. Suppose it were pointed out that through all the  three thousand years of recorded history, abounding in literature of  every conceivable kind, there was not so much as a mention of the  oculist question for which all had been dared and done. Suppose not one  of the living or dead languages of mankind had so much as a word for  \"long-sighted\" or \"short-sighted.\" Suppose, in short, the question that  had torn the whole world in two was never even asked at all, until some  spectacle-maker suggested it somewhere about 1750. In that case I think  we should find it hard to believe that this physical difference had  really played so fundamental a part in human history. And that is  exactly the case with the physical difference between the Celts, the  Teutons and the Latins.    I know of no way in which fair-haired people can be prevented from  falling in love with dark-haired people; and I do not believe that  whether a man was long-headed or round-headed ever made much difference  to any one who felt inclined to break his head. To all mortal  appearance, in all mortal records and experience, people seem to have  killed or spared, married or refrained from marriage, made kings or made  slaves, with reference to almost any other consideration except this  one. There was the love of a valley or a village, a site or a family;  there were enthusiasms for a prince and his hereditary office; there  were passions rooted in locality, special emotions about sea-folk or  mountain-folk; there were historic memories of a cause or an alliance;  there was, more than all, the tremendous test of religion. But of a  cause like that of the Celts or Teutons, covering half the earth, there  was little or nothing. Race was not only never at any given moment a  motive, but it was never even an excuse. The Teutons never had a creed;  they never had a cause; and it was only a few years ago that they began  even to have a cant.    The orthodox modern historian, notably Green, remarks on the singularity  of Britain in being alone of all Roman provinces wholly cleared and  repeopled by a Germanic race. He does not entertain, as an escape from  the singularity of this event, the possibility that it never happened.  In the same spirit he deals with the little that can be quoted of the  Teutonic society. His ideal picture of it is completed in small touches  which even an amateur can detect as dubious. Thus he will touch on the  Teuton with a phrase like \"the basis of their society was the free man\";  and on the Roman with a phrase like \"the mines, if worked by forced  labour, must have been a source of endless oppression.\" The simple fact  being that the Roman and the Teuton both had slaves, he treats the  Teuton free man as the only thing to be considered, not only then but  now; and then goes out of his way to say that if the Roman treated his  slaves badly, the slaves were badly treated. He expresses a \"strange  disappointment\" that Gildas, the only British chronicler, does not  describe the great Teutonic system. In the opinion of Gildas, a  modification of that of Gregory, it was a case of _non Angli sed  diaboli_. The modern Teutonist is \"disappointed\" that the contemporary  authority saw nothing in his Teutons except wolves, dogs, and whelps  from the kennel of barbarism. But it is at least faintly tenable that  there was nothing else to be seen.    In any case when St. Augustine came to the largely barbarized land, with  what may be called the second of the three great southern visitations  which civilized these islands, he did not see any ethnological problems,  whatever there may have been to be seen. With him or his converts the  chain of literary testimony is taken up again; and we must look at the  world as they saw it. He found a king ruling in Kent, beyond whose  borders lay other kingdoms of about the same size, the kings of which  were all apparently heathen. The names of these kings were mostly what  we call Teutonic names; but those who write the almost entirely  hagiological records did not say, and apparently did not ask, whether  the populations were in this sense of unmixed blood. It is at least  possible that, as on the Continent, the kings and courts were almost the  only Teutonic element. The Christians found converts, they found  patrons, they found persecutors; but they did not find Ancient Britons  because they did not look for them; and if they moved among pure  Anglo-Saxons they had not the gratification of knowing it. There was,  indeed, what all history attests, a marked change of feeling towards the  marches of Wales. But all history also attests that this is always  found, apart from any difference in race, in the transition from the  lowlands to the mountain country. But of all the things they found the  thing that counts most in English history is this: that some of the  kingdoms at least did correspond to genuine human divisions, which not  only existed then but which exist now. Northumbria is still a truer  thing than Northumberland. Sussex is still Sussex; Essex is still Essex.  And that third Saxon kingdom whose name is not even to be found upon the  map, the kingdom of Wessex, is called the West Country and is to-day the  most real of them all.    The last of the heathen kingdoms to accept the cross was Mercia, which  corresponds very roughly to what we call the Midlands. The unbaptized  king, Penda, has even achieved a certain picturesqueness through this  fact, and through the forays and furious ambitions which constituted the  rest of his reputation; so much so that the other day one of those  mystics who will believe anything but Christianity proposed to \"continue  the work of Penda\" in Ealing: fortunately not on any large scale. What  that prince believed or disbelieved it is now impossible and perhaps  unnecessary to discover; but this last stand of his central kingdom is  not insignificant. The isolation of the Mercian was perhaps due to the  fact that Christianity grew from the eastern and western coasts. The  eastern growth was, of course, the Augustinian mission, which had  already made Canterbury the spiritual capital of the island. The western  grew from whatever was left of the British Christianity. The two  clashed, not in creed but"]]]
