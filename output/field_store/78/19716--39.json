The old man was silent because all was  not yet settled between the tribes. The Cheyenne, the Arikara, the  Omaha, Ponca, and Iowa were having a great council, so as to adopt  rules concerning the hunting of game, and of peace, and war.    After a while, the young man went to visit the tree. When he reached  home, he told his father again of it. The old man was silent, for the  chiefs were still holding their council. At last, when the council was  over and the rules decided upon, the old man sent for the chiefs. He  said, \"My son has seen a wonderful tree. The Thunder Birds come and go  upon this tree. They make a trail of fire which leaves four paths on  the burnt grass that stretch towards the Four Winds. When the Thunder  Birds alight upon the tree, it bursts into flame. The fire mounts to  the top. The tree stands burning, but no one can see the fire except  at night.\"    When the chiefs heard this tale, they sent runners to see what this  tree might be. The runners came back and told the same story. In the  night they had seen the tree burning as it stood. Then all the people  held a council as to what this might mean. The chiefs said, \"We shall  run for it. Put on your ornaments and prepare as if for battle.\"    The warriors painted themselves as if for war. They put on their  ornaments. They set out for the tree, which stood near a lake. They  ran as if it were a race to attack the enemy. All the men ran. A Ponca  was the first to reach the tree and he struck it as if it were an  enemy.    Then they cut the tree down. Four men, walking in a straight line,  carried it on their shoulders to the village. The chiefs for four  nights sang the songs made in honor of the tree. They held a council  about the tree. A tent was made for it, and it was set up in the  circle of lodges. The chiefs worked upon it; they trimmed it and  called it a human being. They made a basket of twigs and feathers and  tied it half way up the tree. Then they said, \"It has no hair!\" So  they sent out to get a large scalp lock and they put it on top of Pole  for hair. Afterwards the chiefs told the criers to tell the people  that when Pole was completed they should see it.    Then they painted Pole and set it up before the tent. They leaned it  on a crotched stick. Then they called all the people and all the  people came. Men, women, and children came.    When they were all together, the chiefs said, \"This is a mystery.  Whenever we meet with trouble, we shall bring all our prayers to Pole.  We shall make offerings to him. We shall ask him for what we need.  When we ask anything, we must make gifts. If anyone desires to become  a chief, he shall make presents to the Keepers of the Pole, and they  shall give him authority to be a chief.\"    When all was finished the people said, \"Let us appoint a time when we  shall again paint Pole; when we shall act before him the battles we  have fought.\" So they fixed the time in the moon when the buffaloes  bellow.          IKTO AND THE THUNDERS    _Teton_      Ikto once stood on the bank of a stream across which he could not  swim. He stood on the bank and thought. Then he sang:        I stand,      Thinking often,      Oh, that I might reach the other side.    Just then a long Something passed, swimming against the current. When  it reached Ikto, it said,    \"I will take you across, but you must not lift your head above the  water. Should you notice even a small cloud, warn me at once, as I  must go under the water. If you see a small cloud, you must say,  'Younger brother, your grandfather is coming.'\"    Before the other bank was reached, Ikto looked up. He saw a small  cloud and said, \"Younger brother, your grandfather is coming.\"    There was a sudden commotion. When Ikto became conscious again, the  Thunder Beings were roaring, and the water was dashing high, but the  monster had vanished.          THE THUNDER BIRD    _Comanche_      In the olden times, a hunter once shot at a large bird which was  flying above him. It fell to the ground. It was so large he was afraid  to go to it alone, so he went back to the camp for others.    When they came back to the place where the bird had been shot, thunder  was rolling through the ravine. Flashes of lightning showed the place  where the bird lay. They came nearer. Then the lightning flashed so  that they could not see the bird. One flash killed a hunter.    The other Indians fled back to the camp. They knew it was the Thunder  Bird.    Once the Thunder Bird, in the days of the grandfathers, came down to  the ground and alighted there. You may know that is so, because the  grass remains burned off a large space, and the outlines are those of  a large bird with outspread wings.          THE THUNDER BIRD    _Assiniboin_      The Sioux, or Dakotas, of whom the Assiniboins are a branch, pretend  that thunder is an enormous bird, and that the muffled sound of the  distant thunder is caused by a countless number of young birds! The  great bird, they say, gives the first sound, and the young ones repeat  it; this is the cause of the reverberations. The Sioux declare that  the young Thunders do all the mischief, like boys who will not listen  to good advice; but the old Thunder, or big bird, is wise and  excellent; he never kills or injures any one!          SONG TO THE THUNDER GODS[A]    _Omaha_          Ye four, come hither and stand, near shall ye stand,[B]      In four groups shall ye stand,      Here shall ye stand, in this place stand.        [The thunder rolls]        Turned by the wind goes the one I send yonder;      Yonder he goes who is whirled by the winds;      Goes, where the four hills of life and the four winds are standing;      There in the midst of the winds do I send him,      Into the midst of the winds standing there.

[E] \"When going on a buffalo hunt, it was customary among the Sioux to  send out a small advance party to locate the herd. On finding it,  these men returned at once at full gallop to the main body of hunters,  but instead of stopping on reaching them, they dashed past and then  turned and fell in behind. It is to this custom the first line  refers.\"    [F] \"In the old days an Indian camp during the cutting up of the meat  after a buffalo hunt was a scene of the most joyous activity....  Preparations were made for days and weeks ahead. Couriers were sent  out to collect the neighboring bands at a common rendezvous, medicine  men began their prayers and ceremonies to attract the herd, the  buffalo songs were sung, and finally when all was ready the  confederated bands or sometimes the whole tribe--men, women, children,  horses, dogs, and travois--moved out into the buffalo grounds. Here  the immense camp of hundreds of tipis was set up, more ceremonies were  performed, and the mounted warriors rode out in a body to surround and  slaughter the herd. The women followed close after them to strip the  hides from the fresh carcasses, and cut out the choice portion of the  meat and tallow and bring it into camp.\"          ORIGIN OF THE BUFFALO    _Teton_      In the days of the grandfathers, buffaloes lived under the earth. In  the olden times, they say, a man who was journeying came to a hill  where there were many holes in the ground. He entered one of them.  When he had gone inside he found buffalo chips and buffalo tracks on  all sides. He found also buffalo hairs where the buffaloes had rubbed  against the walls. These were the real buffaloes and they lived under  the ground. Afterwards some of them came to the surface of the earth  and lived there. Then the herds on the earth increased.    These buffaloes had many lodges and there they raised their children.  They did many strange things. Therefore when a man escapes being  wounded by an enemy, people say he has seen the buffaloes in his  dreams, and they have helped him.    Men who dream of the buffaloes act like them and dance the  buffalo-bull dance. Then the man who acts the buffalo has a real  buffalo inside of him, people say, a little hard ball near the  shoulder blade; and therefore he is very hard to kill. No matter how  often he is wounded, he does not die.    People know that the buffaloes live in earth lodges; so they never  dance the buffalo dance vainly.

FROM \"THE CHARTER OAK.\"      O pity the poor little slave,    Who labors hard through all the day--      And has no one,      When day is done,    To teach his youthful heart to pray.    No words of love--no fond embrace--    No smiles from parents kind and dear;      No tears are shed      Around his bed,    When fevers rage, and death is near.    None feel for him when heavy chains    Are fastened to his tender limb;      No pitying eyes,      No sympathies,    No prayers are raised to heaven for him.    Yes I will pity the poor slave,    And pray that he may soon be free;      That he at last,      When days are past,    In heaven may have his liberty.          THE BEREAVED MOTHER.    Words by Jesse Hutchinson. Air, \"Kathleen O'Moore.\"      [Music]    Oh deep was the anguish of the slave mother's heart,  When called from her darling for ever to part;  So grieved that lone mother, that heart broken mother,            In sorrow and woe.    The lash of the master her deep sorrows mock,  While the child of her bosom is sold on the block;  Yet loud shrieked that mother, poor heart broken mother,            In sorrow and woe.    The babe in return, for its fond mother cries,  While the sound of their wailings together arise;  They shriek for each other, the child and the mother,            In sorrow and woe.    The harsh auctioneer to sympathy cold,  Tears the babe from its mother and sells it for gold;  While the infant and mother, loud shriek for each other,            In sorrow and woe.    At last came the parting of mother and child,  Her brain reeled with madness, that mother was wild;  Then the lash could not smother the shrieks of that mother,            Of sorrow and woe.    The child was borne off to a far distant clime,  While the mother was left in anguish to pine;  But reason departed, and she sank broken hearted,            In sorrow and woe.    That poor mourning mother, of reason bereft,  Soon ended her sorrows and sank cold in death:  Thus died that slave mother, poor heart broken mother,            In sorrow and woe.    Oh! list ye kind mothers to the cries of the slave;  The parents and children implore you to save;  Go! rescue the mothers, the sisters and brothers,            From sorrow and woe.          HEARD YE THAT CRY.    From \"Wind of the Winter night.\"      [Music]    Heard ye that cry! Twas the wail of a slave,  As he sank in despair, to the rest of the grave;  Behold him where bleeding and prostrate he lies,  Unfriended he lived, and unpitied he died.    The white man oppressed him--the white man for gold,  Made him toil amidst tortures that cannot be told;  He robbed him, and spoiled him, of all that was dear,  And made him the prey of affliction and fear.    But his anguish was seen, and his wailings were heard,  By the Lord God of Hosts; whose vengeance deferred,  Gathers force by delay, and with fury will burst,  On his impious oppressor--the tyrant accurst!    Arouse ye, arouse ye! ye generous and brave,  Plead the rights of the poor--plead the cause of the slave;  Nor cease your exertions till broken shall be  The fetters that bind him, and the slave shall be free.          Sleep on my Child.    BY R.J.H.      Sleep on, my child, in peaceful rest,  While lovely visions round thee play;  No care or grief has touched thy breast,  Thy life is yet a cloudless day.    Far distant is my childhood's home--  No mother's smiles--no father's care!  Oh! how I'd love again to roam,  Where once my little playmates were!    Sleep on, thou hast not felt the chain;  But though 'tis yet unmingled joy,  I may not see those smiles again,  Nor clasp thee to my breast, my boy.    And must I see thee toil and bleed!  Thy manly soul in fetters tied;  'Twill wring thy mother's heart indeed--  Oh! would to God that I had died!    That soul God's own bright image bears--  But oh! no tongue thy woes can tell;  Thy lot is cast in blood and tears,  And soon these lips must say--farewell!          ZAZA--THE FEMALE SLAVE.    Words by Miss Ball. Music by G.W.C.      [Music]    O my country, my country! how long I for thee,  Far over the mountain, far over the sea.  Where the sweet Joliba kisses the shore,  Say, shall I wander by thee never more?  Where the sweet Joliba kisses the shore,  Say, shall I wander by thee never more?  O my country, my country! how long I for thee,  Far over the mountain, far over the sea.            Say, O fond Zurima,            Where dost thou stay?          Say, doth another            List to thy sweet lay?          Say, doth the orange still            Bloom near our cot?          Zurima, Zurima,            Am I forgot?  O, my country, my country! how long I for thee,  Far over the mountain, far over the sea.            Under the baobab            Oft have I slept,          Fanned by sweet breezes            That over me swept.          Often in dreams            Do my weary limbs lay          'Neath the same baobab,            Far, far away,  O my country, my country, how long I for thee,  Far over the mountain, far over the sea.            O for the breath            Of our own waving palm,          Here, as I languish,            My spirit to calm--          O for a draught            From our own cooling lake,          Brought by sweet mother,            My spirit to wake.  O my country, my country, how long I for thee,  Far over the mountain, far over the sea.          PRAYER FOR THE SLAVE.    Tune--Hamburgh.      [Music]    Oh let the pris'ner's mournful sighs    As incense in thy sight appear!  Their humble wailings pierce the skies,    If haply they may feel thee near.    The captive exiles make their moans,    From sin impatient to be free;  Call home, call home, thy banished ones!    Lead captive their captivity!    Out of the deep regard their cries,    The fallen raise, the mourners cheer,  Oh, Son of Righteousness, arise,    And scatter all their doubts and fear.    Stand by them in the fiery hour,    Their feebleness of mind defend;  And in their weakness show thy power,    And make them patient to the end.    Relieve the souls whose cross we bear,    For whom thy suffering members mourn:  Answer our faith's effectual prayer;    And break the yoke so meekly borne!          Remembering that God is just.      Oh righteous God! whose awful frown    Can crumble nations to the dust,  Trembling we stand before thy throne,    When we reflect that thou art just.    Dost thou not see the dreadful wrong,    Which Afric's injured race sustains?  And wilt thou not arise ere long,    To plead their cause, and break their chains?    Must not thine anger quickly rise    Against the men whom lust controls,  Who dare thy righteous laws despise    And traffic in the blood of souls?          THE FUGITIVE.    Words by L.M.C. Air \"Bonny Doon.\"      [Music]    A noble man of sable brow  Came to my humble cottage door,  With cautious, weary step and slow,  And asked if I could feed the poor;  He begged if I had ought to give,  To help the panting fugitive.    I told him he had fled away  From his kind master, friends, and home;  That he was black--a slave astray,  And should return as he had come;  That I would to his master give  The straying villain fugitive.    He fell upon his trembling knee  And claimed he was a brother man,  That I was bound to set him free,  According to the gospel plan;  And if I would God's grace receive,  That I must help the fugitive.    He showed the stripes his master gave,  The festering wound--the sightless eye,  The common badges of the slave,  And said he would be free, or die;  And if I nothing had to give,  I should not stop the fugitive.    He owned his was a sable skin,  That which his Maker first had given;  But mine would be a darker sin,  That would exclude my soul from heaven:  And if I would God's grace receive,  I should relieve the fugitive.    I bowed and took the stranger in,  And gave him meat, and drink, and rest,  I hope that God forgave my sin,  And made me with that brother blest;  I am resolved, long as I live,  To help the panting fugitive.          AM I NOT A MAN AND BROTHER?    Words by A.C.L. Air--\"Bride's Farewell.\"      [Music]    Am I not a man and brother?    Ought I not, then, to be free?  Sell me not one to another,    Take not thus my liberty.  Christ our Saviour, Christ our Saviour,    Died for me as well as thee.    Am I not a man and brother?    Have I not a soul to save?  Oh, do not my spirit smother,    Making me a wretched slave:  God of mercy, God of mercy,    Let me fill a freeman's grave!    Yes, thou art a man and brother,    Though thou long hast groaned a slave,  Bound with cruel cords and tether    From the cradle to the grave!  Yet the Saviour, yet the Saviour,    Bled and died all souls to save.    Yes, thou art a man and brother,    Though we long have told thee nay:  And are bound to aid each other,    All along our pilgrim way.  Come and welcome, come and welcome,    Join with us to praise and pray!          Am I not a Sister?    BY A.C.L.      Am I not a sister, say?    Shall I then be bought and sold  In the mart and by the way,    For the white man's lust and gold?  Save me then from his foul snare,  Leave me not to perish there!    Am I not a sister say,    Though I have a sable hue!  Lo! I have been dragged away,    From my friends and kindred true,  And have toiled in yonder field,  There have long been bruised and peeled!    Am I not a sister, say?    Have I an immortal soul?  Will you, sisters, tell me nay?    Shall I live in lust's control,  To be chattled like a beast,  By the Christian church and priest?    Am I not a sister, say?    Though I have been made a slave?  Will you not then for me pray,    To the God whose power can save,  High and low, and bond and free?  Toil and pray and vote for me!          YE HERALDS OF FREEDOM.    Music by Kingsley.      [Music]    Ye heralds of freedom, ye noble and brave,  Who dare to insist on the rights of the slave;  Go onward, go onward, your cause"]]]
