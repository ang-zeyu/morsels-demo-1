Immediately opposite  to us, across the breadth of the room (some fifteen feet), is that other  door, by which Cayley went out and returned a few minutes ago. In the  right-hand wall, thirty feet away from us, are the French windows.  Crossing the room and going out by the opposite door, we come into a  passage, from which two rooms lead. The one on the right, into which  Cayley went, is less than half the length of the office, a small, square  room, which has evidently been used some time or other as a bedroom. The  bed is no longer there, but there is a basin, with hot and cold taps, in  a corner; chairs; a cupboard or two, and a chest of drawers. The window  faces the same way as the French windows in the next room; but anybody  looking out of the bedroom window has his view on the immediate right  shut off by the outer wall of the office, which projects, by reason of  its greater length, fifteen feet further into the lawn.    The room on the other side of the bedroom is a bathroom. The three rooms  together, in fact, form a sort of private suite; used, perhaps, during  the occupation of the previous owner, by some invalid, who could not  manage the stairs, but allowed by Mark to fall into disuse, save for the  living-room. At any rate, he never slept downstairs.    Antony glanced at the bathroom, and then wandered into the bedroom, the  room into which Cayley had been. The window was open, and he looked out  at the well-kept grass beneath him, and the peaceful stretch of park  beyond; and he felt very sorry for the owner of it all, who was now  mixed up in so grim a business.    \"Cayley thinks he did it,\" said Antony to himself. \"That's obvious. It  explains why he wasted so much time banging on the door. Why should  he try to break a lock when it's so much easier to break a window?  Of course he might just have lost his head; on the other hand, he  might--well, he might have wanted to give his cousin a chance of getting  away. The same about the police, and--oh, lots of things. Why, for  instance, did we run all the way round the house in order to get to the  windows? Surely there's a back way out through the hall. I must have a  look later on.\"    Antony, it will be observed, had by no means lost his head.    There was a step in the passage outside, and he turned round, to see  Cayley in the doorway. He remained looking at him for a moment, asking  himself a question. It was rather a curious question. He was asking  himself why the door was open.    Well, not exactly why the door was open; that could be explained easily  enough. But why had he expected the door to be shut? He did not remember  shutting it, but somehow he was surprised to see it open now, to see  Cayley through the doorway, just coming into the room. Something working  sub-consciously in his brain had told him that it was surprising. Why?    He tucked the matter away in a corner of his mind for the moment; the  answer would come to him later on. He had a wonderfully retentive  mind. Everything which he saw or heard seemed to make its corresponding  impression somewhere in his brain; often without his being conscious of  it; and these photographic impressions were always there ready for him  when he wished to develop them.    Cayley joined him at the window.    \"I've telephoned,\" he said. \"They're sending an inspector or some one  from Middleston, and the local police and doctor from Stanton.\" He  shrugged his shoulders. \"We're in for it now.\"    \"How far away is Middleston?\" It was the town for which Antony had taken  a ticket that morning--only six hours ago. How absurd it seemed.    \"About twenty miles. These people will be coming back soon.\"    \"Beverley, and the others?\"    \"Yes. I expect they'll want to go away at once.\"    \"Much better that they should.\"    \"Yes.\" Cayley was silent for a little. Then he said, \"You're staying  near here?\"    \"I'm at 'The George,' at Waldheim.\"    \"If you're by yourself, I wish you'd put up here. You see,\" he went on  awkwardly, \"you'll have to be here--for the--the inquest and--and so  on. If I may offer you my cousin's hospitality in his--I mean if he  doesn't--if he really has--\"    Antony broke in hastily with his thanks and acceptance.    \"That's good. Perhaps Beverley will stay on, if he's a friend of yours.  He's a good fellow.\"    Antony felt quite sure, from what Cayley had said and had hesitated to  say, that Mark had been the last to see his brother alive. It didn't  follow that Mark Ablett was a murderer. Revolvers go off accidentally;  and when they have gone off, people lose their heads and run away,  fearing that their story will not be believed. Nevertheless, when people  run away, whether innocently or guiltily, one can't help wondering which  way they went.    \"I suppose this way,\" said Antony aloud, looking out of the window.    \"Who?\" said Cayley stubbornly.    \"Well, whoever it was,\" said Antony, smiling to himself. \"The murderer.  Or, let us say, the man who locked the door after Robert Ablett was  killed.\"    \"I wonder.\"    \"Well, how else could he have got away? He didn't go by the windows in  the next room, because they were shut.\"    \"Isn't that rather odd?\"    \"Well, I thought so at first, but--\" He pointed to the wall jutting out  on the right. \"You see, you're protected from the rest of the house if  you get out here, and you're quite close to the shrubbery. If you go out  at the French windows, I imagine you're much more visible. All that part  of the house--\" he waved his right hand--\"the west, well, north-west  almost, where the kitchen parts are--you see, you're hidden from them  here. Oh, yes! he knew the house, whoever it was, and he was quite right  to come out of this window. He'd be into the shrubbery at once.\"    Cayley looked at him thoughtfully.    \"It seems to me, Mr. Gillingham, that you know the house pretty well,  considering that this is the first time you've been to it.\"    Antony laughed.    \"Oh, well, I notice things, you know. I was born noticing. But I'm  right, aren't I, about why he went out this way?\"    \"Yes, I think you are.\" Cayley looked away--towards the shrubbery. \"Do  you want to go noticing in there now?\" He nodded at it.    \"I think we might leave that to the police,\" said Antony gently.  \"It's--well, there's no hurry.\"    Cayley gave a little sigh, as if he had been holding his breath for the  answer, and could now breathe again.    \"Thank you, Mr. Gillingham,\" he said.          CHAPTER IV. The Brother from Australia      Guests at the Red House were allowed to do what they liked within  reason--the reasonableness or otherwise of it being decided by Mark. But  when once they (or Mark) had made up their minds as to what they wanted  to do, the plan had to be kept. Mrs. Calladine, who knew this little  weakness of their host's, resisted, therefore, the suggestion of Bill  that they should have a second round in the afternoon, and drive home  comfortably after tea. The other golfers were willing enough, but Mrs.  Calladine, without actually saying that Mr. Ablett wouldn't like it, was  firm on the point that, having arranged to be back by four, they should  be back by four.    \"I really don't think Mark wants us, you know,\" said the Major. Having  played badly in the morning, he wanted to prove to himself in the  afternoon that he was really better than that. \"With this brother of his  coming, he'll be only too glad to have us out of the way.\"    \"Of course he will, Major.\" This from Bill. \"You'd like to play,  wouldn't you, Miss Norris?\"    Miss Norris looked doubtfully at the hostess.    \"Of course, if you want to get back, dear, we mustn't keep you here.  Besides, it's so dull for you, not playing.\"    \"Just nine holes, mother,\" pleaded Betty.    \"The car could take you back, and you could tell them that we were  having another round, and then it could come back for us,\" said Bill  brilliantly.    \"It's certainly much cooler here than I expected,\" put in the Major.    Mrs. Calladine fell. It was very pleasantly cool outside the golf-house,  and of course Mark would be rather glad to have them out of the way. So  she consented to nine holes; and the match having ended all-square, and  everybody having played much better than in the morning, they drove back  to the Red House, very well pleased with themselves.    \"Halo,\" said Bill to himself, as they approached the house, \"isn't that  old Tony?\"    Antony was standing in front of the house, waiting for them. Bill waved,  and he waved back. Then as the car drew up, Bill, who was in front with  the chauffeur, jumped down and greeted him eagerly.    \"Hallo, you madman, have you come to stay, or what?\" He had a sudden  idea. \"Don't say you're Mark Ablett's long-lost brother from Australia,  though I could quite believe it of you.\" He laughed boyishly.    \"Hallo, Bill,\" said Antony quietly. \"Will you introduce me? I'm afraid  I've got some bad news.\"    Bill, rather sobered by this, introduced him. The Major and Mrs.  Calladine were on the near side of the car, and Antony spoke to them in  a low voice.    \"I'm afraid I'm going to give you rather a shock,\" he said. \"Robert  Ablett, Mr. Mark Ablett's brother, has been killed.\" He jerked a thumb  over his shoulder. \"In the house.\"    \"Good God!\" said the Major.    \"Do you mean that he has killed himself?\" asked Mrs. Calladine. \"Just  now?\"    \"It was about two hours ago. I happened to come here,\"--he half-turned  to Beverley and explained--\"I was coming to see you, Bill, and I arrived  just after the--the death. Mr. Cayley and I found the body. Mr. Cayley  being busy just now--there are police and doctors and so on in the  house--he asked me to tell you. He says that no doubt you would prefer,  the house-party having been broken up in this tragic way, to leave as  soon as possible.\" He gave a pleasant apologetic little smile and went  on, \"I am putting it badly, but what he means, of course, is that you  must consult your own"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18721"],[0,"The Victim: A Romance of the Real Jefferson Davis (#5)"],[1,"pest. Somehow the  monastery, its bells, its organ, its jeweled windows, and its kindly  black-robed priests seemed far away and unreal now--only a dream that  had passed.          VI    REBELLION      The mother's breakdown was not allowed to stop the Boy's education. Both  father and older brother were determined on this. They would use the  schools at home now.    He was sent to the County Academy in the fall. The Boy didn't like it.  After the easy life with the kindly old monks at St. Thomas, this  academy was not only cheap and coarse and uninteresting, but the teacher  had no sense. He gave lessons so long and hard it was impossible to  memorize them.    The Boy complained to the teacher. A lesson of the same length was  promptly given again. The rebel showed the teacher he was wrong by  failing to know it.    \"I'll thrash you, sir!\" was the stern answer.    The Boy would not take that from such a fool. He rose in his wrath, went  home and poured out the indignant story of his wrongs.    The father was a man of few words, but the long silence which followed  gave a feeling of vague uneasiness. He was never dictatorial to his  children, but meant what he said. His voice was quiet and persuasive  when he finally spoke.    \"Of course, my son, you will have to choose for yourself whether you  will work with your hands only, or with your head and hands. You can't  be an idler, I need more cotton pickers. You don't like school, try the  cotton, I'll give you work.\"    The Boy flushed and looked at his father keenly. It was no joke. He  meant exactly what he had said, and a boy with any sand in his gizzard  couldn't back down.    \"All right, sir,\" was the firm answer. \"I'll begin in the morning.\"    He went forth to his task with grim determination. The sun of early  September had just risen and it was already hot as he bent to work.  Cotton picking looked easy from a distance. When you got at it, things  somehow were different. A task of everlasting monotony, this bending  from boll to boll along the endless rows! He never realized before how  long the cotton rows were. There was a little stop at the end before  turning and selecting the next, but these rows seemed to stretch away  into eternity.    Three hours at it, and he was mortally tired. His back ached in a dull  hopeless pain. He lifted his head and gazed longingly toward the school  he had scorned.    \"What a fool!\" he sighed. \"But I'll stick to it. I can do what any  nigger can.\"    He looked curiously at the slaves who worked without apparent effort.  Not one of them seemed the least bit tired. He could get used to it,  too. After all, this breath of the open world was better than being  cooped up in a stuffy old schoolhouse with a fool to set impossible  tasks.    \"Pooh! I'll show my father!\" he exclaimed.    The negroes broke into a plantation song. Jim Pemberton, the leader,  sang each stanza in a clear fine tenor that rang over the field and  echoed through the deep woods. The others joined in the chorus and after  the last verse repeated in low sweet notes that died away so softly it  was impossible to tell the moment the song had ceased.    The music was beautiful, but it was impossible for him to join in their  singing. He couldn't lower himself to an equality with black slaves.  This cotton picking seemed part of their scheme of life. Their strong  black bodies swayed in a sort of rhythmic movement even when they were  not singing. Somehow his body didn't fit into the scheme. His back ached  and ached. No matter. He had chosen, and he would show them he had a  man's spirit inside a boy's breast.    At noon the ache had worn away and he felt a sense of joy in conquering  the pain.    He ate his dinner in silence and wondered what Polly was thinking about  at school. Girl-like, she had cried and begged him to go back.    With a cheerful wave of his hand to his mother, he returned to the field  before the negroes, strapped the bag on his shoulder and bent again to  his task. The afternoon was long. It seemed at three o'clock there could  be no end to it and still those long, long rows of white fleece  stretched on and on into eternity--all alike in dull, tiresome monotony.    He whistled to keep up his courage.    The negroes whispered to one another and smiled as they looked his way.  He paid no attention.    By four o'clock, the weariness had become a habit and at sundown he felt  stronger than at dawn. He swung the bag over his back and started to the  weighing place.    \"Pooh--it's easy!\" he said with scorn.    The negroes crowded around his pile of cotton.    \"Dat Boy is sho one cotton-picker!\" cried Jim Pemberton, regarding him  with grinning admiration.    \"Of course, I can pick cotton if I want to--\"    \"But ye raly don't wanter?\" Jim grinned.    \"Sure I do. I'm sick of school.\"    Jim laughed aloud and, coming close, whispered insinuatingly:    \"I'se sho sick er pickin' cotton, an' when yer quits de job--\"    \"I'm not going to quit--\"    \"Yassah, yassah?--I understan' dat--but de pint is, _when_ yer _do_  quit, don't fergit Jim, Marse Jeff. I likes you. You got de spunk. I  wants ter be yo' man.\"    The appeal touched the Boy's pride. He answered with quiet dignity:    \"All right, James--\"    Jim lifted his head and walled his eyes:    \"Des listen at him call me Jeemes! I knows a real marster when I sees  him!\"    That night, the father asked no questions and made no comment on the  fact that he had picked a hundred and ten pounds of cotton--as much as  any man in the field. His deciding to work with his hands had apparently  been accepted as final.    This thing of deciding life for himself was a serious business. It would  be very silly to jump into a career with slaves, coarse and degrading,  just because a fool happened to be teaching at the County Academy. He  must think this thing over. Tired as he was, he lay awake until eleven  o'clock, thinking, thinking for himself.    It was lonesome work, too, this thinking for himself.    If his father had only done the thinking for him, it would have been so  much easier to accept his decision and then rebel if he didn't like it.    He returned to the field next morning with renewed determination.  Through the long, hot, interminable day he bent and fought the battle in  silence. His back ached worse than the first day. Every muscle in his  finely strung little body was bruised and sore and on fire.    He began to ask if his father were right. Wasn't a man a double fool who  had brains and refused to use them?    An idiot could pick cotton when the bag was fastened on his back. All he  needed was one hand. All he had to do was to bend, hour after hour, day  after day, until it became the habit of life and the ache stopped.    He could see this now, for himself. He smiled at the quiet wisdom of his  father. He certainly knew how to manage boys. He must acknowledge that.  He was quiet and considerate about it, too. He didn't dictate. He only  suggested things for consideration and choice. It was easy to meet the  views of that kind of a father. He treated a boy with the dignity of a  man.    When the cotton was weighed, the Boy faced his father:    \"I've thought it all over, sir, and I'd like to go back to school.\"    \"All right, my son, you can return in the morning.\"    He made no comment. He indulged in no smile at the Boy's expense. He  received his decision with the serious dignity of a judge of the  Supreme Court of Life.    The rebellion ended for all time. Teachers and schools took on a new  meaning. A lesson was no longer a hard task set by a heartless fool who  had been accidentally placed in a position of power. School meant the  training of his mind for a higher and more useful life.    Progress now was steady. The next year a new teacher came, a real  teacher, the Rev. John Shaw from Boston, Massachusetts--a man of even  temper, just, gentle, a profound scholar with a mind whose contagious  enthusiasm drew the spirits of the young as a magnet.    The Boy learned more under his guidance within a year than in all his  life before, and next full was ready to enter Transylvania University at  Lexington, Kentucky.    The polite, handsome boy from Mississippi who had served an  apprenticeship with his father's negroes in a cotton field, gave the  professors no trouble. Good-natured, prudent, joyous, kind, manly, he  attended to his lessons and his own business. He neither gambled nor  drank, nor mingled with the rowdy set. He had come there for something  else.    He had just passed his examinations for the Senior class in July, 1824,  when the first great sorrow came. The wise father whom he had grown to  love and reverence died in his sixty-eighth year.    His thoughtful Big Brother came in person to tell him and break the blow  with new ambitions and new hopes. He had secured an appointment from  President Monroe as a cadet to West Point from the State of Mississippi.    And then began the four years of stern discipline that makes a soldier  and fits him to command men.    But once in those busy years did the gay spirit within rise in  rebellion, to learn wisdom in the bitterness of experience.    With Emile Laserre, his jolly Creole friend from Louisiana, he slipped  down to Bennie Haven's on a frolic--taking French leave, of course. The  alarm was given of the approach of an instructor, and the two culprits  bolted for the barracks at breakneck speed through pitch darkness.  Scrambling madly through the woods, there was a sudden cry, a crash and  silence. He had fallen sixty feet over a precipice to the banks of the  Hudson. Young Laserre crawled carefully to the edge of the rock, peered  over and called through the darkness:    \"Are you dead, Jeff?\"    He was suffering too much to laugh, though he determined to give an  Irishman's reply to that question, if it killed him. He managed to  wheeze back the answer:    \"Not dead--but spachless!\"    Many were the temptations of"]]]
