[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20019"],[0,"Lectures on Landscape (#5)"],[1,"that the oval window in its west end is one  of the prettiest pieces of rough thirteenth-century carving in the  kingdom; I used it for a chief example in my lectures at Edinburgh;  and you know that the lancet windows, in their fine proportion and  rugged masonry, would alone form a study of ruined Gothic masonry of  exquisite interest.    Yet you find Turner representing the lancet window by a few bare oval  lines like the hoop of a barrel; and indicating the rest of the  structure by a monotonous and thin piece of outline, of which I was  asked by one of yourselves last term, and quite naturally and rightly,  how Turner came to draw it so slightly--or, we may even say, so badly.    38. Whenever you find Turner stopping short, or apparently failing in  this way, especially when he does the contrary of what any of us would  have been nearly sure to do, then is the time to look for your main  lesson from him. You recollect those quiet words of the strongest of  all Shakespeare's heroes, when any one else would have had his sword  out in an instant:         \"Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them ...       Were it my cue to fight, I should have known it       Without a prompter.\"[8]    [Footnote 8: \"Othello,\" I. 2.]    Now you must always watch keenly what Turner's _cue_ is. You will see  his hand go to his hilt fast enough, when it comes. Dumblane Abbey is  a pretty piece of building enough, it is true; but the virtue of the  whole scene, and meaning, is not in the masonry of it. There is  much better masonry and much more wonderful ruin of it elsewhere;  Dumblane Abbey--tower and aisles and all--would go under one of the  arches of buildings such as there are in the world. Look at what  Turner will do when his cue is masonry,--in the Coliseum. What the  execution of that drawing is you may judge by looking with a  magnifying glass at the ivy and battlements in this, when, also, his  cue is masonry. What then can he mean by not so much as indicating one  pebble or joint in the walls of Dumblane?    [Illustration]    39. I was sending out the other day, to a friend in America, a chosen  group of the _Liber Studiorum_ to form a nucleus for an art  collection at Boston. And I warned my friend at once to guard his  public against the sore disappointment their first sight of these so  much celebrated works would be to them. \"You will have to make them  understand,\" I wrote to him, \"that their first lesson will be in  observing not what Turner has done, but what he has not done. These  are not finished pictures, but studies; endeavors, that is to say, to  get the utmost result possible with the simplest means; they are  essentially thoughtful, and have each their fixed purpose, to which  everything else is sacrificed; and that purpose is always  imaginative--to get at the heart of the thing, not at its outside.\"    40. Now, it is true, there are beautiful lichens at Blair Athol, and  good building at Dumblane; but there are lovely lichens all over the  cold regions of the world, and there is far more interesting  architecture in other countries than in Scotland. The essential  character of Scotland is that of a wild and thinly inhabited rocky  country, not sublimely mountainous, but beautiful in low rock and  light streamlet everywhere; with sweet copsewood and rudely growing  trees. This wild land possesses a subdued and imperfect school of  architecture, and has an infinitely tragic feudal, pastoral, and civic  history. And in the events of that history a deep tenderness of  sentiment is mingled with a cruel and barren rigidity of habitual  character, accurately corresponding to the conditions of climate and  earth.    41. Now I want you especially to notice, with respect to these things,  Turner's introduction of the ugly square tower high up on the left.  Your first instinct would be to exclaim, \"How unlucky that was there  at all! Why, at least, could not Turner have kept it out of sight?\" He  has quite gratuitously brought it into sight; gratuitously drawn  firmly the three lines of stiff drip-stone which mark its squareness  and blankness. It is precisely that blank vacancy of decoration, and  setting of the meager angles against wind and war, which he wants to  force on your notice, that he may take you thoroughly out of Italy and  Greece, and put you wholly into a barbarous and frost-hardened land;  that once having its gloom defined he may show you all the more  intensely what pastoral purity and innocence of life, and loveliness  of nature, are underneath the banks and braes of Doune, and by every  brooklet that feeds the Forth and Clyde.    That is the main purpose of these two studies. How it is obtained by  various incidents in the drawing of stones, and trees, and figures, I  will show you another time. The chief element in both is the sadness  and depth of their effect of subdued though clear light in sky and  stream.    42. The sadness of their effect, I repeat. If you remember anything of  the Lectures I gave you through last year, you must be gradually  getting accustomed to my definition of the Greek school in art, as one  essentially Chiaroscurist, as opposed to Gothic color; Realist, as  opposed to Gothic imagination; and Despairing, as opposed to Gothic  hope. And you are prepared to recognize it by any one of these three  conditions. Only, observe, the chiaroscuro is simply the technical  result of the two others: a Greek painter likes light and shade,  first, because they enable him to realize form solidly, while color is  flat; and secondly, because light and shade are melancholy, while  color is gay.    So that the defect of color, and substitution of more or less gray or  gloomy effects of rounded gradation, constantly express the two  characters: first, Academic or Greek fleshliness and solidity as  opposed to Gothic imagination; and secondly, of Greek tragic horror  and gloom as opposed to Gothic gladness.    43. In the great French room in the Louvre, if you at all remember the  general character of the historical pictures, you will instantly  recognize, in thinking generally of them, the rounded fleshly and  solid character in the drawing, the gray or greenish and brownish  color, or defect of color, lurid and moonlight-like, and the gloomy  choice of subjects, as the Deluge, the Field of Eylau, the Starvation  on the Raft, and the Death of Endymion; always melancholy, and usually  horrible.    The more recent pictures of the painter Gerome unite all these  attributes in a singular degree; above all, the fleshliness and  materialism which make his studies of the nude, in my judgment,  altogether inadmissible into the rank of the fine arts.    44. Now you observe that I never speak of this Greek school but with a  certain dread. And yet I have told you that Turner belongs to it, that  all the strongest men in times of developed art belong to it; but  then, remember, so do all the basest. The learning of the Academy is  indeed a splendid accessory to original power, in Velasquez, in  Titian, or in Reynolds; but the whole world of art is full of a base  learning of the Academy, which, when fools possess, they become a  tenfold plague of fools.    And again, a stern and more or less hopeless melancholy necessarily is  under-current in the minds of the greatest men of all ages,--of Homer,  Aeschylus, Pindar, or Shakespeare. But an earthy, sensual, and weak  despondency is the attribute of the lowest mental and bodily disease;  and the imbecilities and lassitudes which follow crime, both in  nations and individuals, can only find a last stimulus to their own  dying sensation in the fascinated contemplation of completer death.    45. Between these--the highest, and these--the basest, you have every  variety and combination of strength and of mistake: the mass of  foolish persons dividing themselves always between the two oppositely  and equally erroneous faiths, that genius may dispense with law, or  that law can create genius. Of the two, there is more excuse for, and  less danger in the first than in the second mistake. Genius has  sometimes done lovely things without knowledge and without discipline.  But all the learning of the Academies has never yet drawn so much as  one fair face, or ever set two pleasant colors side by side.    46. Now there is one great Northern painter, of whom I have not spoken  till now, probably to your surprise, Rubens; whose power is composed  of so many elements, and whose character may be illustrated so  completely, and with it the various operation of the counter schools,  by one of his pictures now open to your study, that I would press you  to set aside one of your brightest Easter afternoons for the study of  that one picture in the Exhibition of Old Masters, the so-called \"Juno  and Argus,\" No. 387.    So-called, I say; for it is not a picture either of Argus or of Juno,  but the portrait of a Flemish lady \"as Juno\" (just as Rubens painted  his family picture with his wife \"as the Virgin\" and himself \"as St.  George\"): and a good anatomical study of a human body as Argus. In the  days of Rubens, you must remember, mythology was thought of as a mere  empty form of compliment or fable, and the original meaning of it  wholly forgotten. Rubens never dreamed that Argus is the night, or  that his eyes are stars; but with the absolutely literal and brutal  part of his Dutch nature supposes the head of Argus full of real eyes  all over, and represents Hebe cutting them out with a bloody knife and  putting one into the hand of the goddess, like an unseemly oyster.    That conception of the action, and the loathsome sprawling of the  trunk of Argus under the chariot, are the essential contributions of  Rubens' own Netherland personality. Then the rest of the treatment he  learned from other schools, but adopted with splendid power.    47. First, I think, you ought to be struck by having two large  peacocks painted with scarcely any color in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20023"],[0,"The Letters of Queen Victoria : A Selection from Her Majesty's Correspondence (#5)"],[1,"for  whom she entertained feelings of the deepest admiration, affection,  and confidence; but still more was it due to the fact that, from the  very first, the Queen instinctively formed an independent judgment  on any question that concerned her; and though she was undoubtedly  influenced in her decisions by her affectionate reliance on her chosen  advisers, yet those advisers were always deliberately and shrewdly  selected, and their opinions were in no case allowed to do more than  modify her own penetrating and clear-sighted judgment.          CHAPTER II    MEMOIR OF QUEEN VICTORIA'S EARLY YEARS      ALEXANDRINA VICTORIA, Queen of Great Britain and Ireland and Empress  of India, was born on Monday, 24th May 1819, at Kensington Palace.    Her father, Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn (1767-1820), the  fourth son of George III., was a man of decided character, kindly,  pious, punctual, with a strict sense of duty and enlightened ideas. He  was a devoted soldier, and, as Queen Victoria once said, \"was proud of  his profession, and I was always taught to consider myself a soldier's  child.\" He had a wide military experience, having served at  Gibraltar, in Canada, and in the West Indies. He had been mentioned in  despatches, but was said to be over-strict in matters of unimportant  detail. His active career was brought to an end in 1802, when he had  been sent to Gibraltar to restore order in a mutinous garrison. Order  had been restored, but the Duke was recalled under allegations of  having exercised undue severity, and the investigation which  he demanded was refused him, though he was afterwards made a  Field-Marshal.    He was a man of advanced Liberal ideas. He had spoken in the House  of Lords in favour of Catholic Emancipation, and had shown himself  interested in the abolition of slavery and in popular education. His  tastes were literary, and towards the end of his life he had even  manifested a strong sympathy for socialistic theories.    At the time of the death of the Princess Charlotte, 6th November 1817,  the married sons of King George III. were without legitimate children,  and the surviving daughters were either unmarried or childless.  Alliances were accordingly arranged for the three unmarried Royal  Dukes, and in the course of the year 1818 the Dukes of Cambridge,  Kent, and Clarence led their brides to the altar.      [Pageheading: THE DUKE AND DUCHESS OF KENT]    The Duchess of Kent (1786-1861), Victoria Mary Louisa, was a daughter  of Francis, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. She was the widow of Emich  Charles, Prince of Leiningen,[1] whom she had married in 1803, and who  had died in 1814, leaving a son and a daughter by her.        [Footnote 1: _Leiningen_, a mediatised princely House of      Germany, dating back to 1096. In 1779 the head of one of      the branches into which it had become divided, the Count of      Leiningen-Dachsburg-Hardenburg, was raised to the rank of      a prince of the Empire, but the Peace of Luneville (1801)      deprived him of his ancient possessions, extending about      232 miles on the left bank of the Rhine. Though no longer an      independent Prince, the head of the House retains his rank and      wealth, and owns extensive estates in Bavaria and Hesse.]    The Duke of Kent died prematurely--though he had always been a  conspicuously healthy man--at Sidmouth, on the 23rd of January 1820,  only a week before his father.    A paper preserved in the Windsor archives gives a touching account of  the Duke's last hours. The Regent, on the 22nd of January, sent to him  a message of solicitude and affection, expressing an anxious wish for  his recovery. The Duke roused himself to enquire how the Prince was in  health, and said, \"If I could now shake hands with him, I should die  in peace.\" A few hours before the end, one who stood by the curtain  of his bed heard the Duke say with deep emotion, \"May the Almighty  protect my wife and child, and forgive all the sins I have committed.\"  His last words--addressed to his wife--were, \"Do not forget me.\"    The Duchess of Kent was an affectionate, impulsive woman, with more  emotional sympathy than practical wisdom in worldly matters. But her  claim on the gratitude of the British nation is that she brought up  her illustrious daughter in habits of simplicity, self-sacrifice, and  obedience.    As a testimony to the sincere appreciation entertained by the  politicians of the time for the way in which the Duchess of Kent had  appreciated her responsibilities with regard to the education of a  probable heir to the Crown of England, we may quote a few sentences  from two speeches made in the House of Commons, in the debate  which took place (27th May 1825) on the question of increasing the  Parliamentary annuity paid to the Duchess, in order to provide duly  for the education of the young Princess.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr Robinson, afterwards Lord Ripon,  said:      \"The position in which this Princess stood with respect to the    throne of the country could not fail to make her an object of    general interest to the nation. He had not himself the honour    of being acquainted with the Duchess of Kent, but he believed    that she had taken the greatest pains with her daughter's    education. She had been brought up in principles of piety and    morality, and to feel a _proper_ sense, he meant by that an    humble sense, of her own dignity, and the rank which probably    awaited her. Perhaps it might have been fit to have brought    this matter before Parliament at an earlier period.\"    Mr Canning said:      \"All parties agreed in the propriety of the Grant, and if    Government had anything to answer for on this point, it was    for having so long delayed bringing it before the House. There    could not be a greater compliment to Her Royal Highness than    to state the quiet unobtrusive tenor of her life, and that    she had never made herself the object of public gaze, but had    devoted herself to the education of her child, whom the House    was now called upon to adopt.\"      [Pageheading: EARLY REMINISCENCES]    In the year 1872 Queen Victoria wrote down with her own hand some  reminiscences of her early childhood, the manuscript of which is  preserved at Windsor, and which may be quoted here.    \"My earliest recollections are connected with Kensington Palace,  where I can remember crawling on a yellow carpet spread out for that  purpose--and being told that if I cried and was naughty my 'Uncle  Sussex' would hear me and punish me, for which reason I always  screamed when I saw him! I had a great horror of _Bishops_ on account  of their wigs and _aprons_, but recollect this being partially  got over in the case of the then Bishop of Salisbury (Dr Fisher,  great-uncle to Mr Fisher, Private Secretary to the Prince of Wales),  by his kneeling down and letting me play with his badge of Chancellor  of the Order of the Garter. With another Bishop, however, the  persuasion of showing him my 'pretty shoes' was of no use. Claremont  remains as the brightest epoch of my otherwise rather melancholy  childhood--where to be under the roof of that beloved Uncle--to listen  to some music in the Hall when there were dinner-parties--and to go  and see dear old Louis!--the former faithful and devoted Dresser and  friend of Princess Charlotte--beloved and respected by all who knew  her--and who doted on the little Princess who was too much an idol in  the House. This dear old lady was visited by every one--and was the  only really devoted Attendant of the poor Princess, whose governesses  paid little real attention to her--and who never left her, and was  with her when she died. I used to ride a donkey given me by my Uncle,  the Duke of York, who was very kind to me. I remember him well--tall,  rather large, very kind but extremely shy. He always gave me beautiful  presents. The last time I saw him was at Mr Greenwood's house, where  D. Carlos lived at one time,--when he was already very ill,--and he  had Punch and Judy in the garden for me.      [Pageheading: EARLY REMINISCENCES]    \"To Ramsgate we used to go frequently in the summer, and I remember  living at Townley House (near the town), and going there by steamer.  Mamma was very unwell. Dear Uncle Leopold went with us.    \"To Tunbridge Wells we also went, living at a house called Mt.  Pleasant, now an Hotel. Many pleasant days were spent here, and the  return to Kensington in October or November was generally a day of  tears.    \"I was brought up very simply--never had a room to myself till I was  nearly grown up--always slept in my Mother's room till I came to the  Throne. At Claremont, and in the small houses at the bathing-places,  I sat and took my lessons in my Governess's bedroom. I was not fond of  learning as a little child--and baffled every attempt to teach me my  letters up to 5 years old--when I consented to learn them by their  being written down before me.      [Pageheading: GEORGE IV.]    \"I remember going to Carlton House, when George IV. lived there, as  quite a little child before a dinner the King gave. The Duchess of  Cambridge and my 2 cousins, George and Augusta, were there. My Aunt,  the Queen of Wuertemberg (Princess Royal), came over, in the year '26,  I think, and I recollect perfectly well seeing her drive through the  Park in the King's carriage with red liveries and 4 horses, in a _Cap_  and evening dress,--my Aunt, her sister Princess Augusta, sitting  _opposite_ to her, also in evening attire, having dined early with the  Duke of Sussex at Kensington. She had adopted all the German fashions  and spoke broken English--and had not been in England for many  many years. She was very kind and good-humoured but very large and  unwieldy. She lived at St James's and had a number of Germans with  her. In the year '26 (I think) George IV. asked my Mother, my Sister  and me down to Windsor for the first time; he had been on bad"]]]
