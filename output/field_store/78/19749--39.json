Sometimes the position of a word may be considered appropriate by  some, and inappropriate by others, according to different  interpretations of the sentence. Take as an example, \"Early in the  morning the nobles and gentlemen who attended on the king assembled in  the great hall of the castle; and here they began to talk of what a  dreadful storm it had been the night before. But Macbeth could  scarcely understand what they said, for he was thinking of something  worse.\" The last sentence has been amended by Professor Bain into  \"_What they said_, Macbeth could scarcely understand.\" But there  appears to be an antithesis between the guiltless nobles who can think  about the weather, and the guilty Macbeth who cannot. Hence, \"what  they said\" ought not, and \"Macbeth\" ought, to be emphasized: and  therefore \"Macbeth\" ought to be retained at the beginning of the  sentence.    The same author alters, \"The praise of judgment Virgil has justly  contested with him, but his invention remains yet unrivalled,\" into  \"Virgil has justly contested with him the praise of judgment, but no  one has yet rivalled his invention\"--an alteration which does not seem  to emphasize sufficiently the antithesis between what had been  'contested,' on the one hand, and what remained as yet 'unrivalled' on  the other.    More judiciously Professor Bain alters, \"He that tells a lie is not  sensible how great a task he undertakes; for he must be forced to  invent twenty more to maintain one,\" into \"for, to maintain one, he  must invent twenty more,\" putting the emphatic words in their emphatic  place, at the end.      *18. Where several words are emphatic, make it clear which is the most  emphatic.* Thus, in \"The state was made, under the pretence of serving  it, in reality the prize of their contention to each of these opposite  parties,\" it is unpleasantly doubtful whether the writer means (1)  _state_ or (2) _parties_ to be emphatic.    If (1), \"As for the _state_, these two parties, under the pretence of  serving it, converted it into a prize for their contention.\" If (2),  write, \"Though served in profession, the state was in reality  converted into a prize for their contention by these two _parties_.\"  In (1) _parties_ is subordinated, in (2) _state_.    Sometimes the addition of some intensifying word serves to emphasize.  Thus, instead of \"To effect this they used all devices,\" we can write  \"To effect this they used _every conceivable device_.\" So, if we want  to emphasize fidelity in \"The business will task your skill and  fidelity,\" we can write \"Not only your skill _but also_ your  fidelity.\" This, however, sometimes leads to exaggerations. See (2).    Sometimes antithesis gives emphasis, as in \"You _do_ not know this,  but you _shall_ know it.\" Where antithesis cannot be used, the  emphasis must be expressed by turning the sentence, as \"I _will make  you_ know it,\" or by some addition, as \"You shall _hereafter_ know  it.\"      *19. Words should be as near as possible to the words with which they  are grammatically connected.* See Paragraphs 20 to 29. For exceptions  see 30.      *20. Adverbs should be placed next to the words they are intended to  affect.* When unemphatic, adverbs come between the subject and the  verb, or, if the tense is compound, between the parts of the compound  tense: \"He _quickly_ left the room;\" \"He has _quickly_ left the room;\"  but, when emphatic, after the verb: \"He left, or has left, the room  _quickly_.\"[10] When such a sentence as the latter is followed by a  present participle, there arises ambiguity. \"I told him to go slowly,  but he left the room _quickly_, dropping the purse on the floor.\" Does  _quickly_ here modify _left_ or _dropping_? The remedy[11] is, to give  the adverb its unemphatic place, \"He _quickly_ left the room, dropping  &c.,\" or else to avoid the participle, thus: \"He _quickly_ dropped the  purse and left the room,\" or \"He dropped the purse and _quickly_ left  the room.\"      *21. \"Only\" requires careful use. The strict[12] rule is, that \"only\"  should be placed before the word affected by it.*    The following is ambiguous:    \"The heavens are not open to the faithful _only_ at intervals.\"    The best rule is to avoid placing \"only\" between two emphatic words,  and to avoid using \"only\" where \"alone\" can be used instead.    In strictness perhaps the three following sentences:    (1) He _only_ beat three,    (2) He beat _only_ three,    (3) He beat three _only_, ought to be explained, severally, thus:    (1) He did no more than beat, did not kill, three.    (2) He beat no more than three.    (3) He beat three, and that was all he did. (Here _only_ modifies the  whole of the sentence and depreciates the action.)    But the best authors sometimes transpose the word. \"He _only_ lived\"  ought to mean \"he did not die or make any great sacrifice;\" but \"He  _only_ lived but till he was a man\" (_Macbeth_, v. 8. 40) means \"He  lived _only_ till he was a man.\" Compare also, \"Who _only_ hath  immortality.\"    _Only_ at the beginning of a statement = _but_. \"I don't like to  importune you, _only_ I know you'll forgive me.\" Before an imperative  it diminishes the favour asked: \"_Only_ listen to me.\" This use of  _only_ is mostly confined to letters.    Very often, _only_ at the beginning of a sentence is used for _alone_:  \"_Only_ ten came,\" \"_Only_ Caesar approved.\" _Alone_ is less ambiguous.  The ambiguity of _only_ is illustrated by such a sentence as, \"Don't  hesitate to bring a few friends of yours to shoot on my estate at any  time. _Only_ five (fifteen) came yesterday,\" which might mean, \"I  don't mind a _few_; _only_ don't bring so many as _fifteen_;\" or else  \"Don't hesitate to bring a few _more_; no more than _five_ came  yesterday.\" In conversation, ambiguity is prevented by emphasis; but  in a letter, _only_ thus used might cause unfortunate mistakes. Write  \"Yesterday _only_ five came,\" if you mean \"no more than five.\"      *22. When \"not only\" precedes \"but also,\" see that each is followed by  the same part of speech.*    \"He _not only_ gave me advice _but also_ help\" is wrong. Write \"He  gave me, _not only_ advice, _but also_ help.\" On the other hand, \"He  _not only_ gave me a grammar, _but also_ lent me a dictionary,\" is  right. Take an instance. \"He spoke _not only_ forcibly _but also_  tastefully (adverbs), and this too, _not only_ before a small  audience, _but also_ in (prepositions) a large public meeting, and his  speeches were _not only_ successful, _but also_ (adjective) worthy of  success.\"      *23. \"At least,\" \"always,\" and other adverbial adjuncts, sometimes  produce ambiguity.*    \"I think you will find my Latin exercise, _at all events_, as good as  my cousin's.\" Does this mean (1) \"my Latin exercise, though not  perhaps my other exercises;\" or (2), \"Though not very good, yet, at  all events, as good as my cousin's\"? Write for (1), \"My Latin  exercise, at all events, you will find &c.\" and for (2), \"I think you  will find my Latin exercise as good as my cousin's, at all events.\"    The remedy is to avoid placing \"at all events\" between two emphatic  words.    As an example of the misplacing of an adverbial adjunct, take \"From  abroad he received most favourable reports, but in the City he heard  that a panic had broken out on the Exchange, and that the funds were  fast falling.\" This ought to mean that the \"hearing,\" and not (as is  intended) that the \"breaking out of the panic,\" took place in the  City.    In practice, an adverb is often used to qualify a remote word, where  the latter is _more emphatic than any nearer word_. This is very  common when the Adverbial Adjunct is placed in an emphatic position at  the beginning of the sentence: \"_On this very spot_ our guide declared  that Claverhouse had fallen.\"      *24. Nouns should be placed near the nouns that they define.* In the  very common sentence \"The death is announced of Mr. John Smith, an  author whose works &c.,\" the transposition is probably made from a  feeling that, if we write \"The death of Mr. John Smith is announced,\"  we shall be obliged to begin a new sentence, \"He was an author whose  works &c.\" But the difficulty can be removed by writing \"We regret to  announce, or, we are informed of, the death of Mr. John Smith, an  author, &c.\"      *25. Pronouns should follow the nouns to which they refer without the  intervention of another noun.* Avoid, \"John Smith, the son of Thomas  Smith, _who_ gave me this book,\" unless _Thomas Smith_ is the  antecedent of _who_. Avoid also \"John supplied Thomas with money: _he_  (John) was very well off.\"    When, however, one of two preceding nouns is decidedly superior to the  other in emphasis, the more emphatic may be presumed to be the noun  referred to by the pronoun, even though the noun of inferior emphasis  intervenes. Thus: \"At this moment the colonel came up, and took the  place of the wounded general. _He_ gave orders to halt.\" Here _he_  would naturally refer to _colonel_, though _general_ intervenes. A  _conjunction_ will often show that a pronoun refers to the subject of  the preceding sentence, and not to another intervening noun. \"The  sentinel at once took aim at the approaching soldier, and fired. He  _then_ retreated to give the alarm.\"    It is better to adhere, in most cases, to Rule 25, which may be called  (Bain) the Rule of Proximity. The Rule of Emphasis, of which an  instance was given in the last paragraph, is sometimes misleading. A  distinction might be drawn by punctuating thus:    \"David the father of Solomon, who slew Goliath.\" \"David, the father of  Solomon who built the Temple.\" But the propriety of omitting a comma  in each case is questionable, and it is better to write so as not to  be at the mercy of commas.      *26. Clauses that are grammatically connected should be kept as close  together as possible.* (But see 55.) The introduction of parentheses  violating this rule often produced serious ambiguity."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22601"],[0,"Hiawatha and the Iroquois Confederation (#5)"],[1,"the bearer as \"the deity who presides  over fisheries and hunting-grounds.\"  He came down from heaven in a white  canoe and after sundry adventures, which remind one of the labors of  Hercules, assumed the name of Hiawatha (signifying, we are told, \"a very  wise man\"), and dwelt for a time as an ordinary mortal among men,  occupied in works of benevolence.  Finally, after founding the  confederacy and bestowing many prudent counsels upon the people, he  returned to the skies by the same conveyance in which he had descended.  This legend was communicated by Clark to Schoolcraft, when the latter was  compiling his \"Notes on the Iroquois.\"  Mr. Schoolcraft, pleased with the  poetical cast of the story and the euphonious name, made confusion worse  confounded by transferring the hero to a distant region and identifying  him with Manabozho, a fantastic divinity of the Ojibways.  Schoolcraft's  volume, absurdly entitled \"The Hiawatha Legends,\" has not in it a single  fact or fiction relating either to Hiawatha himself or to the Iroquois  deity Aronhiawagon.  Wild Ojibway stories concerning Manabozho and his  comrades form the staple of its contents.  But it is to this collection  that we owe the charming poem of Longfellow; and thus, by an  extraordinary fortune, a grave Iroquois lawgiver of the fifteenth century  has become, in modern literature, an Ojibway demigod, son of the West  Wind, and companion of the tricksy Paupukkeewis, the boastful Iagoo, and  the strong Kwasind.  If a Chinese traveller, during the middle ages,  inquiring into the history and religion of the western nations, had  confounded King Alfred with King Arthur, and both with Odin, he would not  have made a more preposterous confusion of names and characters than that  which has hitherto disguised the genuine personality of the great  Onondaga reformer.    About the main events of his history, and about his character and  purposes, there can be no reasonable doubt.  We have the wampum belts  which he handled, and whose simple hieroglyphics preserve the memory of  the public acts in which he took part.  We have, also, in the Iroquois  \"Book of Rites,\" a still more clear and convincing testimony to the  character both of the legislator and of the people for whom his  institutions were designed.  This book, sometimes called the \"Book of the  Condoling Council,\" might properly enough be styled an Iroquois Veda.  It  comprises the speeches, songs and other ceremonies, which, from the  earliest period of the confederacy, have composed the proceedings of  their council when a deceased chief is lamented and his successor is  installed in office.  The fundamental laws of the league, a list of their  ancient towns, and the names of the chiefs who constituted their first  council, chanted in a kind of litany, are also comprised in the  collection.  The contents, after being preserved in memory, like the  Vedas, for many generations, were written down by desire of the chiefs,  when their language was first reduced to writing; and the book is  therefore more than a century old.  Its language, archaic when written,  is now partly obsolete, and is fully understood by only a few of the  oldest chiefs.  It is a genuine Indian composition, and must be accepted  as disclosing the true character of its authors.  The result is  remarkable enough.  Instead of a race of rude and ferocious warriors, we  find in this book a kindly and affectionate people, full of sympathy for  their friends in distress, considerate to their women, tender to their  children, anxious for peace, and imbued with a profound reverence for  their constitution and its authors.  We become conscious of the fact that  the aspect in which these Indians have presented themselves to the  outside world has been in a large measure deceptive and factitious.  The  ferocity, craft, and cruelty, which have been deemed their leading  traits, have been merely the natural accompaniments of wars of  self-preservation, and no more indicated their genuine character than the  war-paint, plume, and tomahawk of the warrior displayed the customary  guise in which he appeared among his own people.  The cruelties of war,  when war is a struggle for national existence, are common to all races.  The persistent desire for peace, pursued for centuries in federal unions,  and in alliances and treaties with other nations, has been manifested by  few as steadily as by the countrymen of Hiawatha.  The sentiment of  universal brotherhood, which directed their polity, has never been so  fully developed in any branch of the Aryan race, unless it may be found  incorporated in the religious quietism of Buddha and his followers.    To come back to our first proposition,--it is unquestionable that the  Iroquois, when they framed the political system which exhibited this  singular force of intellect and elevation of character, were a people of  the Stone Age; and there is no good reason for supposing that they were  superior in character and capacity to the people of the most primitive  times.  What we know of them entitles us to affirm that the makers of the  earliest flint implements may have been equal, if not superior, in  natural powers to the members of any existing race.  And as language is  the outgrowth and image of the mental faculties, it is not impossible, or  even unlikely, that among the languages spoken by the people of those  early ages, there may have been some as far superior in construction and  power of expression to any tongue of modern Europe, as the languages of  the barbarous Greeks and Germans, a thousand years before the Christian  era, were superior to the speech of the highly civilized Egyptians.    The conclusions to which these facts and reasonings point are of great  scientific importance.  As there could be no sound astronomy while the  notion prevailed that the earth was the centre of the universe, and no  science of history while each nation looked with contempt upon every  other people, so we can hope for no complete and satisfying science of  man and of human speech until our minds are disabused of those other  delusions of self-esteem which would persuade us that superior culture  implies superior capacity, and that the particular race and language  which we happen to claim as our own are the best of all races and  languages.
