As it is, your actions  have upset the whole house, brought on the destruction of the  fish-globe, and the cook is so upset that she has threatened to leave.\"    \"Oh, she won't leave, Dad. She likes her big wages too well,\" remarked  Andy, quickly.    \"I don't know about that, Son. Nobody is going to stand for your tricks  much longer. They are getting altogether too numerous.\" Tom continued  to look as stern as possible. \"I've got to take both of you in hand,  and that is all there is to it. You are growing wilder every day.  Something has got to be done. Now you go right upstairs and finish  dressing, and don't dare to let me hear of any more tricks being played  for the rest of this day, otherwise I'll not only give you a sound  thrashing, but I'll cut off your spending money and do several other  things that you won't like;\" and, thus speaking, the father of the  twins opened the door to the hall and shoved them both out towards the  stairs with more force than they had felt for some time. The two lads  lost no time in retiring to their bedroom.    \"Say, Randy, I think you got off rather easily,\" remarked Andy, when  they were alone.    \"I think so myself,\" was the quick response. \"I thought Dad would be so  mad that he would give me one everlasting licking.\"    \"Say! how did you make out?\" questioned Fred, eagerly, as he came  sneaking in, followed by Jack.    \"You don't look as if you had suffered very much,\" was Jack's comment.  \"I thought you'd come out looking as if you'd been through a threshing  machine.\"    What Randy and Andy had to tell was quickly related. At the conclusion,  Jack, who being somewhat older than any of the others, was looked upon  as something of a leader, shook his head thoughtfully.    \"I guess we had better pull in our horns a little, for a while at  least,\" was his conclusion. \"My father was mighty mad, too, and so was  Fred's. If we don't look out, we'll all get in wrong. They didn't like  that wetting business to start with.\"    While the boys were finishing their toilet and discussing the matter,  their fathers were doing what they could to set matters to rights  downstairs, and to pacify their Aunt Martha and also the cook and the  hired girl. The cook was particularly wrought up.    \"It ain't the first time nor the second time nor the third time that  them boys have played tricks on us,\" she declared. \"It's been nothin'  but one thing or 'nother ever since they came here--and last Summer it  was the same way. The first thing you know, they'll be doin' somethin'  awful, and some of us'll get hurt. I think I had better leave.\"    \"If she leaves, I'll leave too,\" declared the hired girl.    \"Don't think of leaving,\" said Tom Rover. \"I'll take those boys in hand  and see to it that they don't bother you any more. If they do the least  thing, I'll pack them back to our house in New York.\" And after a  little more talk he succeeded in mollifying the cook and the hired girl  to such an extent that they went back to their work. Then the fathers  of the boys withdrew once more to the library.    \"I don't know how you feel about it,\" began Tom, after he had picked up  his comic paper once more and then thrown it aside in disgust. \"I begin  to think that the best thing I can do is to pack those twins off to  Colby Hall.\"    \"I don't know but what I agree with you, Tom,\" answered Sam. \"And if  you do send them, I think Fred might as well go along.\"    \"Yes; and Jack also,\" added Dick. \"Those boys will never want to be  separated, and I don't know that we could do better than to place them  under Larry Colby's care, especially if we let Larry know just how wild  they are apt to be and tell him to take them in hand.\"    \"Yes; I'd want Larry to know all about them,\" answered Tom. \"And I'd  want him to give me his word that he'd keep a sharp eye on Andy and  Randy and punish them severely every time they broke any of the rules.  It's the only way to bring them up properly.\"    \"All right then, Tom. If you think that way and Dick thinks the same,  let's get right down to business and send a letter to Larry Colby  to-night,\" said Sam.    \"But what of the boys' mothers?\" questioned Dick Rover. He knew that  his wife Dora would grieve considerably over having young Jack leave  home.    \"We'll have to explain the situation to them and get them to agree,\"  answered Tom, firmly.          CHAPTER IV    JACK IN WALL STREET      \"Just to think, Jack! a week from to-day we'll be on our way to Colby  Hall Military Academy.\"    \"Yes, Fred. Doesn't it seem wonderful? I do hope we'll find the school  to our liking,\" returned Jack, with a serious look on his face. \"It  would be too bad to go to some punk school.\"    \"Oh, you can be sure that the school is all right; otherwise our  fathers wouldn't have picked it out for us,\" broke in Andy. \"They know  what a good military academy is. Didn't they go to that famous old  Putnam Hall?\"    \"I wish we could have gone to Putnam Hall,\" added Randy. \"From what dad  has told me, it must have been one dandy school.\"    \"Well, we can't go to something that ain't,\" answered his twin with a  grin. \"Putnam Hall doesn't exist any more. When it burnt to the ground,  Captain Putnam felt too old to have it rebuilt, and so he settled with  the insurance companies and retired.\"    \"Gee! but won't we have dandy times if that school is what we hope  for?\" cried Andy. \"We'll make things hum, won't we?\"    \"Right you are!\" came in a chorus from the others. And then, in sudden  high spirits, the boys began to wrestle with each other, ending up with  something of a pillow fight in which not only pillows but also bolsters  and numerous other articles were used as missiles.    After a never-to-be-forgotten vacation at Valley Brook Farm, the boys,  along with their sisters and their parents, had returned to their homes  in New York City. The Summer was almost at an end, and schools all over  were opening for the Fall and Winter term.    It had been no easy task for Dick, Tom, and Sam Rover to convince their  wives that it would be best to send the boys to some strict boarding  school instead of to the private school which they had been attending  in the metropolis. Gentle Dora Rover had cried a little at the thought  of having her only son Jack leave home, and Grace Rover had been  affected the same way at the thought of parting from her only boy Fred.    \"But both of you will be better off than I shall be,\" had been Nellie  Rover's comment. \"Each of you will have a daughter still at home, while  both of my twins will be gone and I'll have nobody;\" and her eyes, too,  had filled with tears.    But with it all, the mothers were sensible women, and they agreed with  their husbands that the boys needed to be placed under strict  discipline and that this was not possible at the school which they had  been attending.    \"That school is altogether too fashionable,\" had been Dick Rover's  comment. \"They make regular dudes of the pupils and they think more of  high collars and neckties and patent-leather shoes than they do of  reading, writing and arithmetic. Now, I want Jack to get a good  education and I want him to learn how to behave himself while he is  getting it.\" And so, after several communications had passed between  the Rovers and Colonel Lawrence Colby, it was settled that the boys  should be enlisted as cadets at Colby Hall.    \"Cease firing!\" cried Jack, when there came a lull in the pillow fight.  \"The first thing you know somebody will come in here and we'll be in  hot water again.\" The boys were up in Jack's bedroom, and all of their  mothers were downstairs, talking over the question of the wardrobes the  lads were to take along to school.    \"All right, Commodore,\" answered Andy, gaily. \"Out of the trenches,  boys; the war is over!\"    \"Suits me,\" panted Randy, who was all out of wind from his exertions.  \"Melt the cannons into telephones and send messages to the girls that  the soldier boys are coming home,\" and at this remark there was a short  laugh. Then all the boys proceeded to make themselves comfortable in  various attitudes around the bedroom.    \"Say! I'm glad of one thing,\" remarked Fred; \"and that is, we won't be  utter strangers at Colby Hall. Spouter Powell will be there and so will  Gif Garrison.\"    It may be as well to explain here that Spouter Powell, whose real first  name was Richard, was the son of the Rovers' old friend, John Powell,  commonly called Songbird. Richard Powell did not seem to have much of  his father's ability to write verse, but he did have a great fondness  for making speeches, whence had come his nickname of Spouter.    Gifford Garrison, always called Gif for short, was the son of the  Rovers' old schoolmate, Fred Garrison, after whom Fred Rover had been  named. Gif was a big, strong youth who doted on athletic sports of all  kinds. Both Gif and Spouter had visited the Rover boys on a number of  occasions, and consequently all of the lads were well acquainted.    \"Yes, I'll be glad to meet Gif and Spouter,\" returned Jack. \"I like  them both, even though Spouter gets pretty talky sometimes.\"    Just then there sounded downstairs a postman's whistle, and a minute  later Martha Rover came upstairs.    \"Here's a letter for you, Jack,\" said his sister, holding it out.    \"Thanks,\" he returned, as he took the communication and glanced at it.  \"Why! what do you know about this? Here we were just talking about Gif  and Spouter, and here is a letter from Gif now,\" he cried.    \"Wonder what he's got to say,\" remarked Fred, and then, as he saw his  cousin lingering at the doorway, he added: \"Don't you want to come in,  Martha, and join us?\"    \"No, thank you,\" she returned. \"I'm going out with Mary. We're going to  buy some things for you boys to take along when you go to that boarding  school.\"    \"Oh, I know what those will be,\" burst out Andy, gaily. \"Pink"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21899"],[0,"A Rip Van Winkle Of The Kalahari (#5)"],[1," of smoke from a prominent dune still some distance away; and in  spite of our fatigue we struggled on, till, with the sun glaring down  full upon us, we stood on the flank of the huge slope of sand. Near its  crest, a few dry and blackened stumps and withered bushes showed where  a little vegetation had once existed, and from near them rose the  smoke. There was, however, no sign of life; and not a sound broke the  awful silence of the desert, as we breasted the rise. Then a vulture  flapped lazily up in front of us, and another and another and a tiger-  wolf (hyena) lurched its gorged and ungainly carcass down the farther  slope.    The fire was alive, but those that had built and lit it were dead . . .  of thirst.    They lay there, all that the vultures had left, a fearsome sight; and  their swollen and protruding tongues told the tale as plainly as though  they had spoken. Yellow bodies, emaciated, but the bodies of what had  once been a splendidly proportioned man and woman no Bushmen these!    \"They are of my folk,\" said Inyati gravely, as he stooped to examine  them, \"mayhap they too have fled from the priests? . . And they have  crossed the desert the way we would go and are dead of thirst!\"        CHAPTER III THE SAND-STORM         We scraped a hasty grave in the sand for the poor remains, and stood  gazing silently across the dunes in the direction that the fresh spoors  showed the two poor creatures had come from; stood there regardless of  our fatigue, and of the blazing heat, of everything in fact but the  grim tragedy before us, and the terrible significance it bore for us,  who would follow the same path.    \"We must rest, and eat,\" at length said Inyati, \"so too must the  horses, or they may die before there is need.\"    We stripped the loads from the poor brutes, and divided the bags of  t'samma we had piled upon them, and soon they were munching away  contentedly, whilst we rigged up some sort of shelter and lay and  panted till the evening.    Then, and then only, did we discuss what we were next to do. \"Master,\"  at length said Inyati, \"think, and think well. To go back is still  easy, to go forward may well be that we die even as these two have  died!\"    \"The desert is drier than when I struggled through it, more dead than  alive, by the path these people came by and that way it would be  madness to try! South, we might find another path, but it will be a  longer one and . . . my master can still return. And the stone that my  master can take and I will go on and bring him more, if he will but  return to the camp and there await me. . . . And if I come not in two  moons, I shall be dead. . . .\"    He held out the blue diamond as he spoke; but the offer, genuine as it  undoubtedly was, acted as a taunt to me, and I bade him sternly put  back the stone, and talk not to me of returning.    \"Thou sayest that the desert is but beginning,\" I told him. \"Am I then  a weakling, to run back like a whipped hound, at the sight of a dead  man? Nay, I will return with the stones I seek, or not at all!\"    Inyati nodded his head sagely as he sucked at his cherished pipe.    \"Aye! Aye!\" he said softly. \"Said I not that the stones were magic?  Sad, even as a sick cow, was my master, till I showed him the stone,  and now he is even again as a young bull!\"    If he had meant to stir me from the apathy that the desert had brought  upon me, he certainly succeeded, for his complimentary comparison of me  to a sick cow again set me laughing! It was the first time I had  laughed for days, and it did me good.    \"Yes, we must go south,\" said Inyati, \"but not far. Only half a march,  and then we will turn again east. Thus shall we find the pans.\"    That night we did not wait for the moon, but saddled our still jaded  nags before it was well dark, and walking most of the way to rest them,  we set our faces towards the Southern Cross. Half way through the night  we halted, and resting for a while, again pushed on, but this time due  east. Dawn found us eagerly looking round for a change in the landscape  if a featureless chaos of tumbled sand is worthy of such a name? but I,  at any rate, could see nothing.    Not so Inyati; his eyes were better than my field-glasses.    \"Look, master!\" he said, as the sun rose, \"there, and there, and there!  little low clouds, just rising from those three places and they won't  last long! They are pans, master, and it is mist that rises from them.  There is moisture there may be water there.\"    \"And food for the horses?\" I asked him; for our poor brutes were in an  awful state, and we had nothing to give them.    \"That may well be,\" he said, \"not on the pans, but near them. And,  master, we must struggle on, and find out; for they cannot fast another  day, and trek another night, without either food or drink.\"    The rising sun rapidly dispersed the little clouds that Inyati had  pointed out, but we kept on in their direction, though the sand was now  burning hot and the poor animals were suffering frightfully.    Now a few scattered bushes and tufts of bone-dry \"toa\" grass began to  show in the hollows between the dunes, and at length, on breasting an  unusually high one a veritable mountain of sand, three or four hundred  feet in height a new and marvelous scene stretched before me.    Abruptly from the foot of the steep dune-slope stretched a vast,  glittering expanse of the purest white; to all appearance a snow-  covered lake, spotless and dazzling in the brilliant sunshine. It was  almost a perfect circle in shape and several miles in diameter, and on  all sides it was hemmed in by gigantic dunes.    \"Salt, master!\" said Inyati. \"I have seen such places before, but, wow!  this is a big one! And this is not the pan I seek. No good to us,  master; but is it not strange? Yonder in my land this salt is a  precious thing; for a basketful, one can obtain a fat cow, for a  sackful, two or more young wives! Here is salt enough to buy many  wives, master; but none to gather it or for that matter, no wives to  buy! . . . But water, master, is what we seek, and not salt water or  t'samma. . . . We must cross, master; there on the other side I see  thick bush in the dunes, there may be t'samma there, and the way across  is easy. Come!\"    He led the way down the steep slope, dragging his jaded animals after  him. At the edge, where sand ended and salt began, lay many bones,  bleached and white almost as the salt itself, and amongst them were the  bones of men. Snorting and afraid, the animals stepped gingerly on the  smooth, snow-like surface, which yielded but an inch or two to their  tread, and was pleasantly cool to their hooves, parched and cracking  from their long trek in the burning sand. Beneath the white surface was  a moist black mud, and the liquid brine oozed quickly into the horses'  footprints. Used as we were to the glare of the sun on the burning  sand, here it was literally blinding, and long before we reached the  farther side we were groping and stumbling like blind men. It was much  wider, too, than it had first appeared, and we were utterly exhausted  when at long length we reached the dunes again, and to our joy found  bush, and a few t'samma, most of them old and hard, but still enough  green ones to provide a scanty meal for the suffering animals. A  respite it was, but a respite only, and well we knew that we must push  on or return at once. Our water bags still held enough to keep us alive  a day or two, but we must find water or t'samma for the horses soon, or  it was evident they could not last. We threw ourselves down on the  burning sand, with a blanket stretched over a tiny bush affording scant  shade for our heads, and in spite of the roasting heat I slept the  sleep of utter exhaustion.    I awoke to find Inyati afoot, and intent on adjusting the blanket to  shade my face from the setting sun. I got up, aching and throbbing in  every part of my body, and parched with a thirst that the lukewarm and  already vile-tasting water from our skin bags did little to alleviate.    \"Master,\" said Inyati, looking at me with concern, \"take thou of the  bitter powder (quinine); and sleep again. Before morning I will come  back. For I must seek the pan I know of, where water may be found. This  cursed salt pan I did not see when I crossed before: the pan I know is  one of the others we saw the clouds rise from; which I know not? So I  seek the nearest, and if water is there, by moonrise I will be here  again. If not, and I must seek the farther one, then when the sun  stands a span high I will be back. Nay, better that I should go alone;  rest, master, and let the horses rest too, for if I find not the water,  our path will be a hard one!\"    He shouldered his Winchester, and strode off, all my arguments failing  to persuade him to take a drop of our little remaining store of water.  I watched him striding away through the dunes till he was lost to  sight, then I turned to and made a fire and some food; for I felt weak  and ill and my head was burning. Then I looked to the horses, hobbling  them short in case they should stray though, poor brutes, they were too  worn out to be likely to do anything of the kind. Then I gathered all  the dry stumps and bush I could find, and made a fire, for lion and  leopard spoor were very plentiful: moreover, a fire would help Inyati  to find his way back. Later, as night fell, I lay down and tried to  sleep; but exhausted as I was I could not rest. My thoughts were with  Inyati. Would he find the pan and water? And if not, what would happen?  The horses would scarce be able to struggle back to the nearest t'samma  we had left, and in any case, to go back, beaten! No, if Inyati gave  any hope at all, I would push on as long as life lasted.    So I lay and mused by the flickering fire, listening for the occasional  yelp of a jackal, or the horrible laughter of a hyena.    Sleep I could not; the horses too were restless, snorting"]]]
