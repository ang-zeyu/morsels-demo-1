How she acquired  this knowledge, I know not, for Tuckahoe is the last place in the world  where she would be apt to find facilities for learning.\" (p. 57.) \"There  is, in _Prichard's Natural History of Man_, the head of a figure--on  page 157--the features of which so resemble those of my mother, that I  often recur to it with something of the feeling which I suppose others  experience when looking upon the pictures of dear departed ones.\" (p.  52.)    The head alluded to is copied from the statue of Ramses the Great, an  Egyptian king of the nineteenth dynasty. The authors of the _Types of  Mankind_ give a side view of the same on page 148, remarking that the  profile, \"like Napoleon's, is superbly European!\" The nearness of its  resemblance to Mr. Douglass' mother rests upon the evidence of his  memory, and judging from his almost marvelous feats of recollection  of forms and outlines recorded in this book, this testimony may be  admitted.    These facts show that for his energy, perseverance, eloquence,  invective, sagacity, and wide sympathy, he is indebted to his Negro  blood. The very marvel of his style would seem to be a development of  that other marvel--how his mother learned to read.{20} The versatility  of talent which he wields, in common with Dumas, Ira Aldridge, and  Miss Greenfield, would seem to be the result of the grafting of the  Anglo-Saxon on good, original, Negro stock. If the friends of \"Caucasus\"  choose to claim, for that region, what remains after this analysis--to  wit: combination--they are welcome to it. They will forgive me for  reminding them that the term \"Caucasian\" is dropped by recent writers on  Ethnology; for the people about Mount Caucasus, are, and have ever been,  Mongols. The great \"white race\" now seek paternity, according to Dr.  Pickering, in Arabia--\"Arida Nutrix\" of the best breed of horses &c.  Keep on, gentlemen; you will find yourselves in Africa, by-and-by. The  Egyptians, like the Americans, were a _mixed race_, with some Negro  blood circling around the throne, as well as in the mud hovels.    This is the proper place to remark of our author, that the same strong  self-hood, which led him to measure strength with Mr. Covey, and to  wrench himself from the embrace of the Garrisonians, and which has borne  him through many resistances to the personal indignities offered him as  a colored man, sometimes becomes a hyper-sensitiveness to such assaults  as men of his mark will meet with, on paper. Keen and unscrupulous  opponents have sought, and not unsuccessfully, to pierce him in this  direction; for well they know, that if assailed, he will smite back.    It is not without a feeling of pride, dear reader, that I present you  with this book. The son of a self-emancipated bond-woman, I feel joy in  introducing to you my brother, who has rent his own bonds, and who, in  his every relation--as a public man, as a husband and as a father--is  such as does honor to the land which gave him birth. I shall place this  book in the hands of the only child spared me, bidding him to strive and  emulate its noble example. You may do likewise. It is an American book,  for Americans, in the fullest sense of the idea. It shows that the  worst of our institutions, in its worst aspect, cannot keep down energy,  truthfulness, and earnest struggle for the right. It proves the{21}  justice and practicability of Immediate Emancipation. It shows that any  man in our land, \"no matter in what battle his liberty may have been  cloven down, * * * * no matter what complexion an Indian or an African  sun may have burned upon him,\" not only may \"stand forth redeemed  and disenthralled,\" but may also stand up a candidate for the highest  suffrage of a great people--the tribute of their honest, hearty  admiration.

In Talbot county, Eastern Shore, Maryland, near Easton, the county town  of that county, there is a small district of country, thinly populated,  and remarkable for nothing that I know of more than for the worn-out,  sandy, desert-like appearance of its soil, the general dilapidation  of its farms and fences, the indigent and spiritless character of its  inhabitants, and the prevalence of ague and fever.    The name of this singularly unpromising and truly famine stricken  district is Tuckahoe, a name well known to all Marylanders, black and  white. It was given to this section of country probably, at the first,  merely in derision; or it may possibly have been applied to it, as I  have heard, because some one of its earlier inhabitants had been guilty  of the petty meanness of stealing a hoe--or taking a hoe that did not  belong to him. Eastern Shore men usually pronounce the word _took_, as  _tuck; Took-a-hoe_, therefore, is, in Maryland parlance, _Tuckahoe_.  But, whatever may have been its origin--and about this I will not be  {26} positive--that name has stuck to the district in question; and it  is seldom mentioned but with contempt and derision, on account of the  barrenness of its soil, and the ignorance, indolence, and poverty of its  people. Decay and ruin are everywhere visible, and the thin population  of the place would have quitted it long ago, but for the Choptank  river, which runs through it, from which they take abundance of shad and  herring, and plenty of ague and fever.    It was in this dull, flat, and unthrifty district, or neighborhood,  surrounded by a white population of the lowest order, indolent and  drunken to a proverb, and among slaves, who seemed to ask, _\"Oh! what's  the use?\"_ every time they lifted a hoe, that I--without any fault of  mine was born, and spent the first years of my childhood.    The reader will pardon so much about the place of my birth, on the score  that it is always a fact of some importance to know where a man is born,  if, indeed, it be important to know anything about him. In regard to the  _time_ of my birth, I cannot be as definite as I have been respecting  the _place_. Nor, indeed, can I impart much knowledge concerning my  parents. Genealogical trees do not flourish among slaves. A person of  some consequence here in the north, sometimes designated _father_, is  literally abolished in slave law and slave practice. It is only once in  a while that an exception is found to this statement. I never met with a  slave who could tell me how old he was. Few slave-mothers know anything  of the months of the year, nor of the days of the month. They keep no  family records, with marriages, births, and deaths. They measure the  ages of their children by spring time, winter time, harvest time,  planting time, and the like; but these soon become undistinguishable  and forgotten. Like other slaves, I cannot tell how old I am. This  destitution was among my earliest troubles. I learned when I grew up,  that my master--and this is the case with masters generally--allowed  no questions to be put to him, by which a slave might learn his{27  GRANDPARENTS} age. Such questions deemed evidence of impatience, and  even of impudent curiosity. From certain events, however, the dates of  which I have since learned, I suppose myself to have been born about the  year 1817.    The first experience of life with me that I now remember--and I remember  it but hazily--began in the family of my grandmother and grandfather.  Betsey and Isaac Baily. They were quite advanced in life, and had long  lived on the spot where they then resided. They were considered old  settlers in the neighborhood, and, from certain circumstances, I infer  that my grandmother, especially, was held in high esteem, far higher  than is the lot of most colored persons in the slave states. She was  a good nurse, and a capital hand at making nets for catching shad and  herring; and these nets were in great demand, not only in Tuckahoe, but  at Denton and Hillsboro, neighboring villages. She was not only good at  making the nets, but was also somewhat famous for her good fortune in  taking the fishes referred to. I have known her to be in the water  half the day. Grandmother was likewise more provident than most of  her neighbors in the preservation of seedling sweet potatoes, and it  happened to her--as it will happen to any careful and thrifty person  residing in an ignorant and improvident community--to enjoy the  reputation of having been born to \"good luck.\" Her \"good luck\" was owing  to the exceeding care which she took in preventing the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2020"],[0,"Tarzan the Terrible (#5)"],[1," O-lo-a, his daughter?  But no, he saves O-lo-a for Bu-lot, son of Mo-sar, the chief whose  great-grandfather was king and who thinks that he should be king. Thus  would Ko-tan appease the wrath of Mo-sar and win the friendship of  those who think with Mo-sar that Mo-sar should be king.    \"But what reward shall repay the faithful Ta-den? Greatly do we honor  our priests. Within the temples even the chiefs and the king himself  bow down to them. No greater honor could Ko-tan confer upon a  subject--who wished to be a priest, but I did not so wish. Priests  other than the high priest must become eunuchs for they may never marry.    \"It was O-lo-a herself who brought word to me that her father had given  the commands that would set in motion the machinery of the temple. A  messenger was on his way in search of me to summon me to Ko-tan's  presence. To have refused the priesthood once it was offered me by the  king would have been to have affronted the temple and the gods--that  would have meant death; but if I did not appear before Ko-tan I would  not have to refuse anything.  O-lo-a and I decided that I must not  appear. It was better to fly, carrying in my bosom a shred of hope,  than to remain and, with my priesthood, abandon hope forever.    \"Beneath the shadows of the great trees that grow within the palace  grounds I pressed her to me for, perhaps, the last time and then, lest  by ill-fate I meet the messenger, I scaled the great wall that guards  the palace and passed through the darkened city. My name and rank  carried me beyond the city gate. Since then I have wandered far from  the haunts of the Ho-don but strong within me is the urge to return if  even but to look from without her walls upon the city that holds her  most dear to me and again to visit the village of my birth, to see  again my father and my mother.\"    \"But the risk is too great?\" asked Tarzan.    \"It is great, but not too great,\" replied Ta-den. \"I shall go.\"    \"And I shall go with you, if I may,\" said the ape-man, \"for I must see  this City of Light, this A-lur of yours, and search there for my lost  mate even though you believe that there is little chance that I find  her. And you, Om-at, do you come with us?\"    \"Why not?\" asked the hairy one. \"The lairs of my tribe lie in the crags  above A-lur and though Es-sat, our chief, drove me out I should like to  return again, for there is a she there upon whom I should be glad to  look once more and who would be glad to look upon me. Yes, I will go  with you. Es-sat feared that I might become chief and who knows but  that Es-sat was right. But Pan-at-lee! it is she I seek first even  before a chieftainship.\"    \"We three, then, shall travel together,\" said Tarzan.    \"And fight together,\" added Ta-den; \"the three as one,\" and as he spoke  he drew his knife and held it above his head.    \"The three as one,\" repeated Om-at, drawing his weapon and duplicating  Ta-den's act. \"It is spoken!\"    \"The three as one!\" cried Tarzan of the Apes. \"To the death!\" and his  blade flashed in the sunlight.    \"Let us go, then,\" said Om-at; \"my knife is dry and cries aloud for the  blood of Es-sat.\"    The trail over which Ta-den and Om-at led and which scarcely could be  dignified even by the name of trail was suited more to mountain sheep,  monkeys, or birds than to man; but the three that followed it were  trained to ways which no ordinary man might essay. Now, upon the lower  slopes, it led through dense forests where the ground was so matted  with fallen trees and over-rioting vines and brush that the way held  always to the swaying branches high above the tangle; again it skirted  yawning gorges whose slippery-faced rocks gave but momentary foothold  even to the bare feet that lightly touched them as the three leaped  chamois-like from one precarious foothold to the next. Dizzy and  terrifying was the way that Om-at chose across the summit as he led  them around the shoulder of a towering crag that rose a sheer two  thousand feet of perpendicular rock above a tumbling river. And when at  last they stood upon comparatively level ground again Om-at turned and  looked at them both intently and especially at Tarzan of the Apes.    \"You will both do,\" he said. \"You are fit companions for Om-at, the  Waz-don.\"    \"What do you mean?\" asked Tarzan.    \"I brought you this way,\" replied the black, \"to learn if either lacked  the courage to follow where Om-at led. It is here that the young  warriors of Es-sat come to prove their courage. And yet, though we are  born and raised upon cliff sides, it is considered no disgrace to admit  that Pastar-ul-ved, the Father of Mountains, has defeated us, for of  those who try it only a few succeed--the bones of the others lie at the  feet of Pastar-ul-ved.\"    Ta-den laughed. \"I would not care to come this way often,\" he said.    \"No,\" replied Om-at; \"but it has shortened our journey by at least a  full day. So much the sooner shall Tarzan look upon the Valley of  Jad-ben-Otho. Come!\" and he led the way upward along the shoulder of  Pastar-ul-ved until there lay spread below them a scene of mystery and  of beauty--a green valley girt by towering cliffs of marble  whiteness--a green valley dotted by deep blue lakes and crossed by the  blue trail of a winding river. In the center a city of the whiteness of  the marble cliffs--a city which even at so great a distance evidenced a  strange, yet artistic architecture. Outside the city there were visible  about the valley isolated groups of buildings--sometimes one, again two  and three and four in a cluster--but always of the same glaring  whiteness, and always in some fantastic form.    About the valley the cliffs were occasionally cleft by deep gorges,  verdure filled, giving the appearance of green rivers rioting downward  toward a central sea of green.    \"Jad Pele ul Jad-ben-Otho,\" murmured Tarzan in the tongue of the  pithecanthropi; \"The Valley of the Great God--it is beautiful!\"    \"Here, in A-lur, lives Ko-tan, the king, ruler over all Pal-ul-don,\"  said Ta-den.    \"And here in these gorges live the Waz-don,\" exclaimed Om-at, \"who do  not acknowledge that Ko-tan is the ruler over all the Land-of-man.\"    Ta-den smiled and shrugged. \"We will not quarrel, you and I,\" he said  to Om-at, \"over that which all the ages have not proved sufficient time  in which to reconcile the Ho-don and Waz-don; but let me whisper to you  a secret, Om-at. The Ho-don live together in greater or less peace  under one ruler so that when danger threatens them they face the enemy  with many warriors, for every fighting Ho-don of Pal-ul-don is there.  But you Waz-don, how is it with you? You have a dozen kings who fight  not only with the Ho-don but with one another. When one of your tribes  goes forth upon the fighting trail, even against the Ho-don, it must  leave behind sufficient warriors to protect its women and its children  from the neighbors upon either hand. When we want eunuchs for the  temples or servants for the fields or the homes we march forth in great  numbers upon one of your villages. You cannot even flee, for upon  either side of you are enemies and though you fight bravely we come  back with those who will presently be eunuchs in the temples and  servants in our fields and homes. So long as the Waz-don are thus  foolish the Ho-don will dominate and their king will be king of  Pal-ul-don.\"    \"Perhaps you are right,\" admitted Om-at. \"It is because our neighbors  are fools, each thinking that his tribe is the greatest and should rule  among the Waz-don. They will not admit that the warriors of my tribe  are the bravest and our shes the most beautiful.\"    Ta-den grinned. \"Each of the others presents precisely the same  arguments that you present, Om-at,\" he said, \"which, my friend, is the  strongest bulwark of defense possessed by the Ho-don.\"    \"Come!\" exclaimed Tarzan; \"such discussions often lead to quarrels and  we three must have no quarrels. I, of course, am interested in learning  what I can of the political and economic conditions of your land; I  should like to know something of your religion; but not at the expense  of bitterness between my only friends in Pal-ul-don. Possibly, however,  you hold to the same god?\"    \"There indeed we do differ,\" cried Om-at, somewhat bitterly and with a  trace of excitement in his voice.    \"Differ!\" almost shouted Ta-den; \"and why should we not differ? Who  could agree with the preposterous----\"    \"Stop!\" cried Tarzan. \"Now, indeed, have I stirred up a hornets' nest.  Let us speak no more of matters political or religious.\"    \"That is wiser,\" agreed Om-at; \"but I might mention, for your  information, that the one and only god has a long tail.\"    \"It is sacrilege,\" cried Ta-den, laying his hand upon his knife;  \"Jad-ben-Otho has no tail!\"    \"Stop!\" shrieked Om-at, springing forward; but instantly Tarzan  interposed himself between them.    \"Enough!\" he snapped. \"Let us be true to our oaths of friendship that  we may be honorable in the sight of God in whatever form we conceive  Him.\"    \"You are right, Tailless One,\" said Ta-den. \"Come, Om-at, let us look  after our friendship and ourselves, secure in the conviction that  Jad-ben-Otho is sufficiently powerful to look after himself.\"    \"Done!\" agreed Om-at, \"but----\"    \"No 'buts,' Om-at,\" admonished Tarzan.    The shaggy black shrugged his shoulders and smiled. \"Shall we make our  way down toward the valley?\" he asked. \"The gorge below us is  uninhabited; that to the left contains the caves of my people. I would  see Pan-at-lee once more. Ta-den would visit his father in the valley  below and Tarzan seeks entrance to A-lur in search of the mate that  would be better dead than in the clutches of the Ho-don priests of  Jad-ben-Otho. How shall we proceed?\"    \"Let us remain together as long as possible,\" urged Ta-den.  \"You,  Om-at, must seek Pan-at-lee by night and by stealth, for three, even we  three, may not hope to overcome"]]]
