On Oct. 16th., after 'much ado and greate perill' he landed on Italian  soil. He was fully prepared to have the most delicious pleasure in this  classical land, having already, even during the stormy weather off the  coast, 'smelt the peculiar joys of Italy in the perfumes of orange,  citron, and jassmine flowers for divers leagues seaward.'    It would be pleasant to ramble through Italy in Evelyn's company, and to  share with him the many enjoyments recorded in his _Diary_: but space  forbids. From Genoa he went to Leghorn and Pisa, from Pisa to Florence,  thence to Sienna, and on to Rome. 'I came to Rome on the 4th November,  1644, about 5 at night, and being perplexed for a convenient lodging,  wandered up and down on horseback, till at last one conducted us to  Monsieur Petits, a Frenchman, near the Piazza Spagnola. Here I alighted,  and having bargained with my host for 20 crownes a moneth, I caused a  good fire to be made in my chamber and went to bed, being so very wet.  The next morning (for I was resolved to spend no time idly here) I got  acquainted with several persons who had long lived at Rome.'    Evelyn's description of the interesting sights he saw in Rome is so good  that it might well be perused in place of modern guide-books by those  visiting the city. There is a delightful attractiveness about it, in  which these up-to-date works are sometimes wanting. But even his  youthful energy began to tire, and his keen appetite to become sated  with continuous sightseeing. After more than six months of it 'we now  determined to desist from visiting any more curiosities, except what  should happen to come in our way, when my companion Mr. Henshaw or  myself should go out to take the aire.' Then, however, as now for some  people, the crowning event of a visit to Rome was to receive the Papal  blessing. This Evelyn desired and obtained, although the event is not  recorded in his diary with any great enthusiasm. 'May, 4th. Having seen  the entrie of ye ambassador of Lucca, I went to the Vatican, where, by  favour of our Cardinal Protector, Frair Barberini, I was admitted into  the consistorie, heard the ambassador make his ovation in Latine to the  Pope, sitting on an elevated state or throne, and changing two  pontifical miters; after which I was presented to kisse his toe, that  is, his embroder'd slipper, two Cardinals holding up his vest and  surplice, and then being sufficiently bless'd with his thumb and two  fingers for that day, I return'd home to dinner.'    He quitted Rome about the middle of May after a sojourn there of seven  months, which had occasioned him so small an outlay that he remarked  thereon in his Diary. 'The bills of exchange I took up from my first  entering Italy till I went from Rome amounted but to 616 _ducanti di  banco_, though I purchas'd many books, pictures, and curiosities.' Going  northwards by Sienna, Leghorn, Lucca, Florence, Bologna, and Ferrara, he  reached Venice early in June. Arriving 'extreamly weary and beaten' with  the journey, he went and enjoyed the new luxury of a Turkish bath. 'This  bath did so open my pores that it cost me one of the greatest colds I  ever had in my life, for want of necessary caution in keeping myselfe  warme for some time after; for coming out, I immediately began to visit  the famous places of the city; and travellers who come in to Italy do  nothing but run up and down to see sights.'    Evelyn had the good fortune to see Venice _en fete_, and in those days  that must have been a sight well worth seeing. He saw the Doge espouse  the Adriatic by casting a gold ring into it on Ascension day with very  great pomp and ceremony. 'It was now Ascension Weeke, and the greate  mart or faire of ye whole yeare was kept, every body at liberty and  jollie. The noblemen stalking with their ladys on _choppines_; these are  high-heel'd shoes, particularly affected by these proude dames, or, as  some say, invented to keepe them at home, it being very difficult to  walke with them; whence one being asked how he liked the Venetian dames,  replied, they were _mezzo carne, mezzo ligno_, half flesh, half wood,  and he would have none of them. The truth is, their garb is very odd, as  seeming always in masquerade; their other habits also totaly different  from all nations.'    In Venice Evelyn made arrangements for visiting the Holy Land and parts  of Syria, Egypt, and Turkey; but they fell through owing to the vessel,  in which he would have sailed, being requisitioned to carry provisions  to Candia, then under attack from the Turks. Forced to abandon this  project, he remained in Venice 'being resolved to spend some moneths  here in study, especially physic and anatomie, of both which there was  now the most famous professors in Europe.' But in the autumn Mr.  Thicknesse, 'my dear friend, and till now my constant fellow traveller,'  was obliged to return to England on private affairs; so Evelyn was left  alone in Venice. Very shortly after that he had an illness which seems  to have at one time threatened a fatal termination. 'Using to drink my  wine cool'd with snow and ice, as the manner here is, I was so afflicted  with the angina and soare-throat, that it had almost cost me my life.  After all the remedies Cavalier Veslingius, cheife professor here, could  apply, old Salvatico (that famous physician) being call'd made me be  cupp'd and scarified in the back in foure places, which began to give me  breath, and consequently life, for I was in ye utmost danger: but God  being mercifull to me, I was after a fortnight abroad againe; when  changing my lodging I went over against Pozzo Pinto, where I bought for  winter provisions 3000 weight of excellent grapes, and pressed my owne  wine, which proved incomparable liquor.' Its goodness, indeed, seems to  have been the death of it. 'Oct. 31st. Being my birth-day, the nuns of  St. Catherine's sent me flowers of silk-work. We were very studious all  this winter till Christmas, when on twelfth day we invited all the  English and Scotts in towne to feast, which sunk our excellent wine  considerably.' In explanation of this passage, it needs to be said that  he had soon again changed his lodging and gone to reside with three  English friends 'neere St. Catherine's over against the monasterie of  nunnes, where we hired the whole house and lived very nobly. Here I  learned to play on ye theorbo, taught by Sig. Dominico Bassano.'    After 'the folly and madnesse of the Carnevall' was over, Evelyn left  Venice for Padua in January, 1646, but went back in March to take leave  of his friends there, and at Easter set out on his return journey to  England in company with the poet Waller, who had been glad to go abroad  after being much worried by the Puritan party. They travelled by way of  Vicenza, Verona, Brescia, Milan, the Lago Maggiore, the Simplon Pass,  Sion, and St. Maurice to Geneva. Here again Evelyn became sick nigh unto  death, from small-pox contracted at Beveretta, the night before reaching  Geneva. 'Being extremely weary and complaining of my head, and finding  little accommodation in the house, I caus'd one of our hostesses  daughters to be removed out of her bed and went immediately into it  whilst it was yet warme, being so heavy with pain and drowsinesse that I  would not stay to have the sheets chang'd; but I shortly after payd  dearly for my impatience, falling sick of the small-pox so soon as I  came to Geneva, for by the smell of frankincense and ye tale of ye good  woman told me of her daughter having had an ague, I afterwards concluded  she had been newly recovered of the small-pox.' Becoming very ill he was  bled of the physician 'a very learned old man..... He afterwards  acknowledg'd that he should not have bled me had he suspected ye  small-pox, which brake out a day after.' As nurse he had a Swiss matron  afflicted with goitre, 'whose monstrous throat, when I sometimes awak'd  out of unquiet slumbers, would affright me.' But again he was spared for  the work he was destined to do. 'By God's mercy after five weeks keeping  my chamber I went abroad.'    Leaving Geneva on the 5th July 1646, Evelyn's party went by way of  Lyons, La Charite, and Orleans to Paris, arriving 'rejoic'd that after  so many disasters and accidents in a tedious peregrination, I was gotten  so neere home, and here I resolv'd to rest myselfe before I went  further. It was now October, and the onely time that in my whole life I  spent most idly, tempted from my more profitable recesses; but I soon  recover'd my better resolutions and fell to my study, learning the High  Dutch and Spanish tongues, and now and then refreshing my danceing, and  such exercises as I had long omitted, and which are not in much  reputation amongst the sober Italians.'    During the course of the following winter and spring he saw much of 'Sir  Richard Browne, his Majesty's Resident at the Court of France, and with  whose lady and family I had contracted a greate friendship (and  particularly set my affections on a daughter).' To this young girl,  Mary, the only child of Sir Richard Browne by a daughter of Sir John  Pretyman, he was married on 27th June, 1647, by Dr. Earle, chaplain to  the young Charles, then Prince of Wales, who was holding his court at  St. Germains. In October he returned by Rouen, Dieppe, and Calais, and  'got safe to Dover, for which I heartily put up my thanks to God who had  conducted me safe to my owne country, and been mercifull to me through  so many aberrations' during a period extending over four years. He  returned alone, 'leaving my wife, yet very young, under the care of an  excellent lady and prudent mother.' Indeed, she was a mere child, being  then not more than twelve years of age, and her father was only Evelyn's  senior by fifteen years.

To the ravens with the monk! to  the ravens!\" and stones mingled with the cries.    \"My God, bless these poor children!\" murmured Paphnutius.    And he pursued his way, thinking.    \"I was worshipped by the old woman, and hated and despised by these  children. Thus the same object is appreciated differently by men who are  uncertain in their judgment and liable to error. It must be owned that,  for a Gentile, old Timocles was not devoid of sense. Though blind, he  knew he was deprived of light. His reasoning was much better than that  of these idolaters, who cry from the depths of their thick darkness, 'I  see the day!' Everything in this world is mirage and moving sand. God  alone is steadfast.\"    He passed through the city with rapid steps. After ten years of absence  he would still recognise every stone, and every stone was to him a stone  of reproach that recalled a sin. For that reason he struck his naked  feet roughly against the kerb-stones of the wide street, and rejoiced  to see the bloody marks of his wounded feet. Leaving on his left the  magnificent portico of the Temple of Serapis, he entered a road lined  with splendid mansions, which seemed to be drowsy with perfumes. Pines,  maples, and larches raised their heads above the red cornices and golden  acroteria. Through the half-open doors could be seen bronze statues  in marble vestibules, and fountains playing amidst foliage. No noise  troubled the stillness of these quiet retreats. Only the distant strains  of a flute could be heard. The monk stopped before a house, rather  small, but of noble proportions, and supported by columns as graceful as  young girls. It was ornamented with bronze busts of the most celebrated  Greek philosophers.    He recognised Plato, Socrates, Aristotle, Epicurus, and Zeno, and  having knocked with the hammer against the door, he waited, wrapped in  meditation.    \"It is vanity to glorify in metal these false sages; their lies are  confounded, their souls are lost in hell, and even the famous Plato  himself, who filled the earth with his eloquence, now disputes with the  devils.\"    A slave opened the door, and seeing a man with bare feet standing on the  mosaic threshold, said to him roughly--    \"Go and beg elsewhere, stupid monk, or I will drive you away with a  stick.\"    \"Brother,\" replied the Abbott of Antinoe, \"all that I ask is that you  conduct me to your master, Nicias.\"    The slave replied, more angrily than before--    \"My master does not see dogs like you.\"    \"My son,\" said Paphnutius, \"will you please do what I ask, and tell your  master that I desire to see him.    \"Get out, vile beggar!\" cried the porter furiously; and he raised his  stick and struck the holy man, who, with his arms crossed upon his  breast, received unmovedly the blow, which fell full in his face, and  then repeated gently--    \"Do as I ask you, my son, I beg.\"    The porter tremblingly murmured--    \"Who is this man who is not afraid of suffering?\"    And he ran and told his master.    Nicias had just left the bath. Two pretty slave girls were scraping him  with strigils. He was a pleasant-looking man, with a kind smile. There  was an expression of gentle satire in his face. On seeing the monk, he  rose and advanced with open arms.    \"It is you!\" he cried, \"Paphnutius, my fellow-scholar, my friend my  brother! Oh, I knew you again, though, to say the truth, you look more  like a wild animal than a man. Embrace me. Do you remember the time when  we studied grammar, rhetoric, and philosophy together? You were, even  then, of a morose and wild character, but I liked you because of your  complete sincerity. We used to say that you looked at the universe with  the eyes of a wild horse, and it was not surprising you were dull and  moody. You needed a pinch of Attic salt, but your liberality knew no  bounds. You cared nothing for either your money or your life. And you  had the eccentricity of genius, and a strange character which interested  me deeply. You are welcome, my dear Paphnutius, after ten years of  absence. You have quitted the desert; you have renounced all Christian  superstitions, and now return to your old life. I will mark this day  with a white stone.\"    \"Crobyle and Myrtale,\" he added, turning towards the girls, \"perfume the  feet, hands, and beard of my dear guest.\"    They smiled, and had already brought the basin, the phials, and the  metal mirror. But Paphnutius stopped them with an imperious gesture, and  lowered his eyes that he might not look upon them, for they were naked.  Nicias brought cushions for him, and offered him various meats and  drinks, which Paphnutius scornfully refused.    \"Nicias,\" he said, \"I have not renounced what you falsely call the  Christian superstition, which is the truth of truths. 'In the beginning  was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. All  things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made that was  made. In Him was the life, and the life was the light of men.'\"    \"My dear Paphnutius,\" replied Nicias, who had now put on a perfumed  tunic, \"do you expect to astonish me by reciting a lot of words jumbled  together without skill, which are no more than a vain murmur? Have you  forgotten that I am a bit of a philosopher myself? And do you think to  satisfy me with some rags, torn by ignorant men from the purple garment  of AEmilius, when AEmilius, Porphyry, and Plato, in all their glory, did  not satisfy me! The systems devised by the sages are but tales imagined  to amuse the eternal childishness of men. We divert ourselves with them,  as we do with the stories of _The Ass_, _The Tub_, and _The Ephesian  Matron_, or any other Milesian fable.\"    And, taking his guest by the arm, he led him into a room where thousands  of papyri were rolled up and lay in baskets.    \"This is my library,\" he said. \"It contains a small part of the various  systems which the philosophers have constructed to explain the world.  The Serapeium itself, with all its riches, does not contain them all.  Alas! they are but the dreams of sick men.\"    He compelled his guest to sit down in an ivory chair, and sat down  himself. Paphnutius scowled gloomily at all the books in the library,  and said--    \"They ought all to be burned.\"    \"Oh, my dear guest, that would be a pity!\" replied Nicias. \"For the  dreams of sick men are sometimes amusing. Besides, if we should destroy  all the dreams and visions of men, the earth would lose its form and  colours, and we should all sleep in a dull stupidity.\"    Paphnutius continued in the same strain as before--    \"It is certain that the doctrines of the pagans are but vain lies. But  God, who is the truth, revealed Himself to men by miracles, and He was  made flesh, and lived among us.\"    Nicias replied--    \"You speak well, my dear Paphnutius, when you say that he was made  flesh. A God who thinks, acts, speaks, who wanders through nature, like  Ulysses of old on the glaucous sea, is altogether a man. How do you  expect that we should believe in this new Jupiter, when the urchins of  Athens, in the time of Pericles, no longer believed in the old one?    \"But let us leave all that. You did not come here; I suppose, to  argue about the three hypostases. What can I do for you, my dear  fellow-scholar?\"    \"A good deed,\" replied the Abbot of Antinoe. \"Lend me a perfumed tunic,  like the one you have just put on. Be kind enough to add to the tunic,  gilt sandals, and a vial of oil to anoint my beard and hair. It is  needful also, that you should give me a purse with a thousand drachmae  in it. That, O Nicias, is what I came to ask of you, for the love of  God, and in remembrance of our old friendship.\"    Nicias made Crobyle and Myrtale bring his richest tunic; it was  embroidered, after the Asiatic fashion, with flowers and animals. The  two girls held it open, and skilfully showed its bright colours, waiting  till Paphnutius should have taken off the cassock which covered him down  to his feet. But the monk having declared that they should rather tear  off his flesh than this garment, they put on the tunic over it. As the  two girls were pretty, they were not afraid of men, although they were  slaves. They laughed at the strange appearance of the monk thus clad.  Crobyle called him her dear satrap, as she presented him with the  mirror, and Myrtale pulled his beard. But Paphnutius prayed to the Lord,  and did not look at them. Having tied on the gilt sandals, and fastened  the purse to his belt, he said to Nicias, who was looking at him with an  amused expression--    \"O Nicias, let not these things be an offence in your eyes. For know  that I shall make pious use of this tunic, this purse, and these  sandals.\"    \"My dear friend,\" replied Nicias, \"I suspect no evil, for I believe that  men are equally incapable of doing evil or doing good. Good and evil  exist only in the opinion. The wise man has only custom and usage to  guide him in his acts. I conform with all the prejudices which prevail  at Alexandria. That is why I pass for an honest man. Go, friend, and  enjoy yourself.\"    But Paphnutius thought that it was needful to inform his host of his  intention.    \"Do you know Thais,\" he said, \"who acts in the games at the theatre?\"    \"She is beautiful,\" replied Nicias, \"and there was a time when she was  dear to me. For her sake, I sold a mill and two fields of corn, and I  composed in her honour three books full of detestably bad verses. Surely  beauty is the most powerful force in the world, and were we so made that  we could possess it always, we should care as little as may be for  the demiurgos, the logos, the aeons, and all the other reveries of the  philosophers. But I am surprised, my good Paphnutius, that you should  have come from the depths of the Thebaid to talk about Thais.\"    Having said this, he sighed gently. And Paphnutius gazed at him with  horror, not conceiving it possible"]]]
