Persevere in your efforts, let  not obstacles damp your zeal and determination and rest assured that the  Power of God which is reinforcing your efforts will in the end triumph and  enable you to fulfil your cherished desire._    _Shoghi_          (16) January 11th, 1927      Dear Baha'i Sister,    Our beloved Guardian has asked me to write to you for him. He is very  pleased with your letter of Dec. 8th which reached him on Jan. 10th and he  is very glad to hear of your activities in New Zealand. He will pray  earnestly that your sincere efforts to make Baha'u'llah's Revelation  widely known will bring forth much fruit and have a great result. In the  newer countries minds are more open, and the people more ready and willing  to receive this Great Message.    With regard to the Queen of Rumania's 3 articles--he will see that you  receive them correctly. He considers the last one in which she  acknowledges Muhammad as a true Prophet of God to have great importance  for the East and especially in Persia. This evening, I personally have had  a most interesting conversation with Dr. Habib of Kermanshah[+E6] who is  now on a visit to Shoghi Effendi with his wife and little girl. He was  telling us of the continued fanaticism of the Moslems of Persia--and how  during two periods of the year especially, the fanatical Mullahs preach  against the Baha'is from their pulpits--saying to the ignorant \"No matter  what evil things you have done during your life, or what sins you have  committed, if you kill a Baha'i who is an enemy of Islam, or even if you  take his property or severely injure him, all your own sins will be wiped  out and forgiven for the sake of this good deed of destroying an enemy of  the Faith!!\"--in this way they incite the people to deeds of violence and  persecution. He said that the Baha'i teachings are spreading rapidly  amongst the more educated classes--but it is difficult to teach the very  poor and ignorant fanatical people--tho' when they do become Believers,  they are very strong and faithful. The 2 periods of particular danger for  the Baha'is in Persia are the fast month and the period of  Moharram[+E7]--which lasts for 8 weeks.    Shoghi Effendi is very interested to hear of the engagement of your son to  a Baha'i young lady--and he prays that in future they may do a great work  for the \"Cause\". He hopes so much that you will recover your full health  and strength, and he will pray especially for that. It is good to know  that Esperanto is increasingly studied in New Zealand.    He will certainly pray for Miss Palter(2) and her Mother as you ask him to  do--and also for your dear son and your two daughters. Please accept all  best wishes from myself and Believe me    Yours in His Service,  Ethel J. Rosenberg    [From the Guardian:]    _My dear and able co-worker:_    _I have read the issues of the \"Herald\" with deep joy and thankfulness. I  will continue to pray at the holy shrines that the invincible power of  Baha'u'llah may add to your present opportunities, extend the sphere of  the Journal, and enable you, individually and collectively, to mirror  forth the beauty and the power of this Divine Revelation._    _Your true brother, _  _ Shoghi_          (17) January 30th, 1927      Dear Baha'i Sister,    Shoghi Effendi wishes me to thank you for the M.O. for L1--which he has  safely received, sent for the help of the sufferers in Persia.    He is himself sending this money to the Nat. Assembly in Teheran, and has  requested them to send him the receipt for it--When he receives their  receipt he will forward it to you, and urges you to give it to the friend  who sent the money. The Persian friends will be very much pleased at  receiving this kind remembrance and help from far distant New Zealand!    With love and warm Baha'i greetings from the holy household and the  friends here, to the dear friends in Auckland.    In the Master's Service,    Sincerely Yours,  Ethel J. Rosenberg    [From the Guardian:]    _My dear co-worker:_    _I am deeply touched by this further evidence of the love and devotion of  the New-Zealand Baha'is and I will gladly forward their contribution of  our friend to the Teheran Assembly to be sent by them to the sufferers in  Jahrum. I will ardently pray for every one of you that the Beloved may  guide your steps and lead you to glorious victory. I urge you to  communicate regularly and frequently with the Baha'i newsletter editor  through Mr Horace Holley and report to him the progress of your  activities. It is so essential and valuable._    _Your true brother, _  _ Shoghi_          (18) May 13th, 1927      My dear Baha'i Sister,    I take pleasure in thanking you on behalf of my dear Guardian for your  letter of April 5th.    As a far away outpost of the Baha'i Faith in New Zealand, he is always  delighted to hear from Auckland and especially yourself and your promising  Assembly there. You own a warm spot in his heart and he is looking forward  to the day when through the efforts of the Auckland Assembly, centres will  be established in every town in New Zealand. A firm faith and a golden  heart is yours, there still remains to turn other hearts into gold.    Miss Butler is well and often thinks of you. Assuring you of our  Guardian's prayers and the love and best wishes of the family who always  remember you.    Ever yours in His Service,  Soheil Afnan    [From the Guardian:]    _My dear and precious co-worker:_    _You should exercise your judgement and tact in delivering the message.  You should make an effort to understand the character and mind of the  seeker before you speak to him on the Cause. I will pray that you may be  inspired and guided to follow the path of moderation and may become an  exemplary herald of His message in that far-away land._    _Your well-wisher, _  _ Shoghi_          (19) June 4th, 1929      Dear Spiritual Sister:    Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of Feb.  14th. He always feels great pleasure to obtain some news from the friends  of that distant land and he hopes and prays that through God's blessings  and your constant endeavours the Cause will develop in New Zealand and  bring into its fold many sincere and devoted souls.    The news that we daily obtain from the different parts of the world bring  in wonderful news of the progress of the Movement. The world is gradually  appreciating the significance of this Movement which has been for so long  misunderstood and denounced.    Yours ever sincerely,  Ruhi Afnan    [From the Guardian:]    _My dear Spiritual Sister:_    _I wish to assure you in person of my prayers for you as well as the dear  and unforgettable friends in Auckland who assuredly occupy a warm and  abiding place in my heart. I eagerly await the news of the progress of  their work, and trust and pray that the Almighty may guide their steps,  and help them to surmount every obstacle._    _Shoghi_          (20) October 4th, 1930      Dear Baha'i Brother:    Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated  April 6th 1930 written from London. He was very happy to learn that  wherever you have been you have received wonderful reception from the  friends. Surely, it is only through such acts of hospitality that the true  spirit of the Cause is manifested.    Shoghi Effendi wishes me to assure you of his prayers and extend to you  his hope that wherever you go you will feel the divine help and guidance.  He hopes that in America you will experience the true spirit of love that  animates the friends there and that you will give them Shoghi Effendi's  greetings.    Yours ever sincerely,  Ruhi Afnan    [From the Guardian:]    _My dear and precious co-worker:_    _I was much pleased to hear from you and to learn of your experiences. I  trust that the same welcome and loving-kindness will be extended to you by  the American friends. You are often in my thoughts, and I will continue to  pray for your spiritual as well as material welfare and advancement.  Convey, when you write to your Mother, my loving and affectionate  greetings._    _Your true brother, _  _ Shoghi_          (21) May 18th, 1931      My dear Baha'i Sister:    I thank you on behalf of the Guardian for your letter of April 16th.    He was very glad to know that you are now on your way to England by way of  America and he hopes that you will find the occasion and the means of  visiting the friends and making permanent connections with them. Bertram  will of course be delighted to meet you and we hope he is successful in  his work there.    I suppose you have all the London addresses as the friends there would be  delighted to meet you. Of course if you do decide to visit Haifa on your  way back, Shoghi Effendi wishes me to assure you of a most hearty welcome.    With his loving greetings to you all and to the young couple in England  and with much love from all here.    Sincerely yours,  Soheil Afnan    [From the Guardian:]    _My dear co-worker:_    _I was so pleased to hear from you and of your plans. I do hope you will  be able to visit the Holy Land where you would be most welcome in  'Abdu'l-Baha's home. I will pray for the success of your efforts from the  depths of my heart when I visit the holy shrines. May the Beloved enable  you to render distinguished services to His Cause and remove every  obstacle from your path._    _Your true brother, _  _ Shoghi_          (22) December 17th, 1931      Dear Baha'i Sister:    Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated  Dec. 2nd 1931. He is very sorry that you cannot on your way to New  Zealand, break your journey and come over for a short visit to Haifa. But  these are such difficult days that we should not be astonished and  discouraged if our plans fail. He"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19252"],[0,"Bahá'í Administration (#5)"],[1,"ublic; for an untimely declaration that shall give rise to  open differences among the friends is far more detrimental than forbearing  still further with those who are suspected of evil intentions. As the  Master so fully and consistently did throughout His lifetime, we must all  make a supreme effort to pour out a genuine spirit of kindness and hopeful  love to peoples of various creeds and classes, and must abstain from all  provocative language that may impede the effect of what true and continued  kindness can produce.    Does not 'Abdu'l-Baha wish us, as He looks down upon us with loving  expectation from His glorious Station, to obliterate as much as possible  all traces of censure, of conflicting discussions, of cooling remarks, of  petty unnecessary observations that impede the onward march of the Cause,  that damp the zeal of the firm believer and detract from the sublimity of  the Baha'i Cause in the eyes of the inquirer? In order, however, to insure  fair and quick and vigorous action whenever such an evil activity is  revealed and has been carefully ascertained, the best and only means would  appear to be, for the careful observer, once he is assured of such an evil  action, and has grown hopeless of the attitude of kindness and  forbearance, to report it quietly to the Spiritual Assembly representative  of the friends in that locality and submit the case to their earnest and  full consideration. Should the majority of the members of that Assembly be  conscientiously convinced of the case--and this being a national issue  affecting the body of the friends in America--it should, only through the  intermediary of that Assembly, be cautiously communicated to that greater  body representing all the Assemblies in America, which will in its turn  obtain all the available data from the local Assembly in question, study  carefully the situation and reserve for itself the ultimate decision. It  may, if it decides so, refer to the Holy Land for further consideration  and consultation.          Local and National Spiritual Assemblies      This clearly places heavy responsibilities on the local as well as  national Assemblies, which in the course of time will evolve, with the  Master's power and guidance, into the local and national Houses of  Justice. Hence the vital necessity of having a local Spiritual Assembly in  every locality where the number of adult declared believers exceeds nine,  and of making provision for the indirect election of a Body that shall  adequately represent the interests of all the friends and Assemblies  throughout the American Continent.    A perusal of some of the words of Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha on the  duties and functions of the Spiritual Assemblies in every land (later to  be designated as the local Houses of Justice), emphatically reveals the  sacredness of their nature, the wide scope of their activity, and the  grave responsibility which rests upon them.    Addressing the members of the Spiritual Assembly in Chicago, the Master  reveals the following:--\"Whenever ye enter the council-chamber, recite this  prayer with a heart throbbing with the love of God and a tongue purified  from all but His remembrance, that the All-powerful may graciously aid you  to achieve supreme victory:--'O God, my God! We are servants of Thine that  have turned with devotion to Thy Holy Face, that have detached ourselves  from all beside Thee in this glorious Day. We have gathered in this  spiritual assembly, united in our views and thoughts, with our purposes  harmonized to exalt Thy Word amidst mankind. O Lord, our God! Make us the  signs of Thy Divine Guidance, the Standards of Thy exalted Faith amongst  men, servants to Thy mighty Covenant. O Thou our Lord Most High!  Manifestations of Thy Divine Unity in Thine Abha Kingdom, and resplendent  stars shining upon all regions. Lord! Aid us to become seas surging with  the billows of Thy wondrous Grace, streams flowing from Thy all-glorious  Heights, goodly fruits upon the Tree of Thy heavenly Cause, trees waving  through the breezes of Thy Bounty in Thy celestial Vineyard. O God! Make  our souls dependent upon the Verses of Thy Divine Unity, our hearts  cheered with the outpourings of Thy Grace, that we may unite even as the  waves of one sea and become merged together as the rays of Thine Effulgent  Light; that our thoughts, our views, our feelings may become as one  reality, manifesting the spirit of union throughout the world. Thou art  the Gracious, the Bountiful, the Bestower, the Almighty, the Merciful, the  Compassionate.'\"    In the Most Holy Book is revealed:--\"The Lord hath ordained that in every  city a House of Justice be established wherein shall gather counsellors to  the number of Baha, and should it exceed this number it does not matter.  It behooveth them to be the trusted ones of the Merciful among men and to  regard themselves as the guardians appointed of God for all that dwell on  earth. It is incumbent upon them to take counsel together and to have  regard for the interests of the servants of God, for His sake, even as  they regard their own interests, and to choose that which is meet and  seemly. Thus hath the Lord your God commanded you. Beware lest ye put away  that which is clearly revealed in His Tablet. Fear God, O ye that  perceive.\"    Furthermore, 'Abdu'l-Baha reveals the following:--\"It is incumbent upon  every one not to take any step without consulting the Spiritual Assembly,  and they must assuredly obey with heart and soul its bidding and be  submissive unto it, that things may be properly ordered and well arranged.  Otherwise every person will act independently and after his own judgment,  will follow his own desire, and do harm to the Cause.\"    \"The prime requisites for them that take counsel together are purity of  motive, radiance of spirit, detachment from all else save God, attraction  to His Divine Fragrances, humility and lowliness amongst His loved ones,  patience and long-suffering in difficulties and servitude to His exalted  Threshold. Should they be graciously aided to acquire these attributes,  victory from the unseen Kingdom of Baha shall be vouchsafed to them. In  this day, assemblies of consultation are of the greatest importance and a  vital necessity. Obedience unto them is essential and obligatory. The  members thereof must take counsel together in such wise that no occasion  for ill-feeling or discord may arise. This can be attained when every  member expresseth with absolute freedom his own opinion and setteth forth  his argument. Should any one oppose, he must on no account feel hurt for  not until matters are fully discussed can the right way be revealed. The  shining spark of truth cometh forth only after the clash of differing  opinions. If after discussion, a decision be carried unanimously, well and  good; but if, the Lord forbid, differences of opinion should arise, a  majority of voices must prevail.\"    Enumerating the obligations incumbent upon the members of consulting  councils, the Beloved reveals the following:--\"The first condition is  absolute love and harmony amongst the members of the assembly. They must  be wholly free from estrangement and must manifest in themselves the Unity  of God, for they are the waves of one sea, the drops of one river, the  stars of one heaven, the rays of one sun, the trees of one orchard, the  flowers of one garden. Should harmony of thought and absolute unity be  non-existent, that gathering shall be dispersed and that assembly be  brought to naught. The second condition:--They must when coming together  turn their faces to the Kingdom on High and ask aid from the Realm of  Glory. They must then proceed with the utmost devotion, courtesy, dignity,  care and moderation to express their views. They must in every matter  search out the truth and not insist upon their own opinion, for  stubbornness and persistence in one's views will lead ultimately to  discord and wrangling and the truth will remain hidden. The honored  members must with all freedom express their own thoughts, and it is in no  wise permissible for one to belittle the thought of another, nay, he must  with moderation set forth the truth, and should differences of opinion  arise a majority of voices must prevail, and all must obey and submit to  the majority. It is again not permitted that any one of the honored  members object to or censure, whether in or out of the meeting, any  decision arrived at previously, though that decision be not right, for  such criticism would prevent any decision from being enforced. In short,  whatsoever thing is arranged in harmony and with love and purity of  motive, its result is light, and should the least trace of estrangement  prevail the result shall be darkness upon darkness.... If this be so  regarded, that assembly shall be of God, but otherwise it shall lead to  coolness and alienation that proceed from the Evil One. Discussions must  all be confined to spiritual matters that pertain to the training of  souls, the instruction of children, the relief of the poor, the help of  the feeble throughout all classes in the world, kindness to all peoples,  the diffusion of the fragrances of God and the exaltation of His Holy  Word. Should they endeavor to fulfill these conditions the Grace of the  Holy Spirit shall be vouchsafed unto them, and that assembly shall become  the center of the Divine blessings, the hosts of Divine confirmation shall  come to their aid, and they shall day by day receive a new effusion of  Spirit.\"    So great is the importance and so supreme is the authority of these  assemblies that once 'Abdu'l-Baha after having himself and in his own  handwriting corrected the translation made into Arabic of the I_sh_raqat  (the Effulgences) by Sheikh Faraj, a Kurdish friend from Cairo, directed  him in a Tablet to submit the above-named translation to the Spiritual  Assembly of Cairo, that he may seek from them before"]]]
