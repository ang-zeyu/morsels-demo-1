ANTONIO.                      How now, madam!      DUCHESS.  This green fruit and my stomach are not friends:    How they swell me!      BOSOLA.  [Aside.]    Nay, you are too much swell'd already.      DUCHESS.  O, I am in an extreme cold sweat!      BOSOLA.                                      I am very sorry.         [Exit.]      DUCHESS.  Lights to my chamber!--O good Antonio,    I fear I am undone!      DELIO.               Lights there, lights!        Exeunt DUCHESS [and Ladies.]      ANTONIO.  O my most trusty Delio, we are lost!    I fear she 's fall'n in labour; and there 's left    No time for her remove.      DELIO.                   Have you prepar'd    Those ladies to attend her; and procur'd    That politic safe conveyance for the midwife    Your duchess plotted?      ANTONIO.               I have.      DELIO.  Make use, then, of this forc'd occasion.    Give out that Bosola hath poison'd her    With these apricocks; that will give some colour    For her keeping close.      ANTONIO.                Fie, fie, the physicians    Will then flock to her.      DELIO.  For that you may pretend    She'll use some prepar'd antidote of her own,    Lest the physicians should re-poison her.      ANTONIO.  I am lost in amazement:  I know not what to think on 't.         Exeunt.             Scene II[45]           [Enter] BOSOLA and Old Lady      BOSOLA.  So, so, there 's no question but her techiness[46]    and most vulturous eating of the apricocks are apparent signs    of breeding, now?      OLD LADY.  I am in haste, sir.      BOSOLA.  There was a young waiting-woman had a monstrous desire    to see the glass-house----      OLD LADY.  Nay, pray, let me go.  I will hear no more    of the glass-house.  You are still[47] abusing women!      BOSOLA.  Who, I?  No; only, by the way now and then, mention your    frailties.  The orange-tree bears ripe and green fruit and blossoms    all together; and some of you give entertainment for pure love,    but more for more precious reward.  The lusty spring smells well;    but drooping autumn tastes well.  If we have the same golden showers    that rained in the time of Jupiter the thunderer, you have the same    Danaes still, to hold up their laps to receive them.  Didst thou    never study the mathematics?      OLD LADY.  What 's that, sir?      BOSOLA.  Why, to know the trick how to make a many lines meet in one    centre.  Go, go, give your foster-daughters good counsel:  tell them,    that the devil takes delight to hang at a woman's girdle, like    a false rusty watch, that she cannot discern how the time passes.         [Exit Old Lady.]           [Enter ANTONIO, RODERIGO, and GRISOLAN]      ANTONIO.  Shut up the court-gates.      RODERIGO.                           Why, sir?  What 's the danger?      ANTONIO.  Shut up the posterns presently, and call    All the officers o' th' court.      GRISOLAN.                       I shall instantly.         [Exit.]      ANTONIO.  Who keeps the key o' th' park-gate?      RODERIGO.                                      Forobosco.      ANTONIO.  Let him bring 't presently.           [Re-enter GRISOLAN with Servants]      FIRST SERVANT.  O, gentleman o' th' court, the foulest treason!      BOSOLA.  [Aside.] If that these apricocks should be poison'd now,    Without my knowledge?      FIRST SERVANT.    There was taken even now a Switzer in the duchess' bed-chamber----      SECOND SERVANT.  A Switzer!      FIRST SERVANT.  With a pistol----      SECOND SERVANT.  There was a cunning traitor!      FIRST SERVANT.    And all the moulds of his buttons were leaden bullets.      SECOND SERVANT.  O wicked cannibal!      FIRST SERVANT.  'Twas a French plot, upon my life.      SECOND SERVANT.  To see what the devil can do!      ANTONIO.  [Are] all the officers here?      SERVANTS.  We are.      ANTONIO.  Gentlemen,    We have lost much plate, you know; and but this evening    Jewels, to the value of four thousand ducats,    Are missing in the duchess' cabinet.    Are the gates shut?      SERVANT.             Yes.      ANTONIO.                   'Tis the duchess' pleasure    Each officer be lock'd into his chamber    Till the sun-rising; and to send the keys    Of all their chests and of their outward doors    Into her bed-chamber.  She is very sick.      RODERIGO.  At her pleasure.      ANTONIO.  She entreats you take 't not ill:  the innocent    Shall be the more approv'd by it.      BOSOLA.  Gentlemen o' the wood-yard, where 's your Switzer now?      FIRST SERVANT.  By this hand, 'twas credibly reported by one    o' the black guard.[48]         [Exeunt all except ANTONIO and DELIO.]      DELIO.  How fares it with the duchess?      ANTONIO.                                She 's expos'd    Unto the worst of torture, pain, and fear.      DELIO.  Speak to her all happy comfort.      ANTONIO.  How I do play the fool with mine own danger!    You are this night, dear friend, to post to Rome:    My life lies in your service.      DELIO.                         Do not doubt me.      ANTONIO.  O, 'tis far from me:  and yet fear presents me    Somewhat that looks like danger.      DELIO.                            Believe it,    'Tis but the shadow of your fear, no more:    How superstitiously we mind our evils!    The throwing down salt, or crossing of a hare,    Bleeding at nose, the stumbling of a horse,    Or singing of a cricket, are of power    To daunt whole man in us.  Sir, fare you well:    I wish you all the joys of a bless'd father;    And, for my faith, lay this unto your breast,--    Old friends, like old swords, still are trusted best.         [Exit.]           [Enter CARIOLA]      CARIOLA.  Sir, you are the happy father of a son:    Your wife commends him to you.      ANTONIO.                        Blessed comfort!--    For heaven' sake, tend her well: I 'll presently[49]    Go set a figure for 's nativity.[50]         Exeunt.             Scene III[51]           [Enter BOSOLA, with a dark lantern]      BOSOLA.  Sure I did hear a woman shriek:  list, ha!    And the sound came, if I receiv'd it right,    ]From the duchess' lodgings.  There 's some stratagem    In the confining all our courtiers    To their several wards:  I must have part of it;    My intelligence will freeze else.  List, again!    It may be 'twas the melancholy bird,    Best friend of silence and of solitariness,    The owl, that screamed so.--Ha! Antonio!           [Enter ANTONIO with a candle, his sword drawn]      ANTONIO.  I heard some noise.--Who 's there?  What art thou?  Speak.      BOSOLA.  Antonio, put not your face nor body    To such a forc'd expression of fear;    I am Bosola, your friend.      ANTONIO.                   Bosola!--    [Aside.] This mole does undermine me.--Heard you not    A noise even now?      BOSOLA.            From whence?      ANTONIO.                         From the duchess' lodging.      BOSOLA.  Not I:  did you?      ANTONIO.                   I did, or else I dream'd.      BOSOLA.  Let 's walk towards it.      ANTONIO.                          No:  it may be 'twas    But the rising of the wind.      BOSOLA.                      Very likely.    Methinks 'tis very cold, and yet you sweat:    You look wildly.      ANTONIO.          I have been setting a figure[52]    For the duchess' jewels.      BOSOLA.                   Ah, and how falls your question?    Do you find it radical?[53]      ANTONIO.                 What 's that to you?    'Tis rather to be question'd what design,    When all men were commanded to their lodgings,    Makes you a night-walker.      BOSOLA.                    In sooth, I 'll tell you:    Now all the court 's asleep, I thought the devil    Had least to do here; I came to say my prayers;    And if it do offend you I do so,    You are a fine courtier.      ANTONIO. [Aside.]         This fellow will undo me.--    You gave the duchess apricocks to-day:    Pray heaven they were not poison'd!      BOSOLA.  Poison'd! a Spanish fig    For the imputation!      ANTONIO.             Traitors are ever confident    Till they are discover'd.  There were jewels stol'n too:    In my conceit, none are to be suspected    More than yourself.      BOSOLA.              You are a false steward.      ANTONIO.  Saucy slave, I 'll pull thee up by the roots.      BOSOLA.  May be the ruin will crush you to pieces.      ANTONIO.  You are an impudent snake indeed, sir:    Are you scarce warm, and do you show your sting?    You libel[54] well, sir?      BOSOLA.                   No, sir:  copy it out,    And I will set my hand to 't.      ANTONIO. [Aside.]              My nose bleeds.    One that were superstitious would count    This ominous, when it merely comes by chance.    Two letters, that are wrought here for my name,[55]    Are drown'd in blood!    Mere accident.--For you, sir, I 'll take order    I' the morn you shall be safe.--[Aside.] 'Tis that must colour    Her lying-in.--Sir, this door you pass not:    I do not hold it fit that you come near    The duchess' lodgings, till you have quit yourself.--    [Aside.] The great are like the base, nay, they are the same,    When they seek shameful ways to avoid shame.         Exit.      BOSOLA.  Antonio hereabout did drop a paper:--    Some of your help, false friend.[56]--O, here it is.    What 's here? a child's nativity calculated!

The eyes of  South Africa were fixed on Bloemfontein, so that when the Conference  came to its unfruitful end, the two parties were practically further off  than before, and their failure to agree accentuated the bitterness both  of the Transvaal Boers and of the English party in the Colonies. To the  more extreme men among the latter this result was welcome. There was  already a war party in the Colony, and voices clamorous for war were  heard in the English press. Both then and afterwards every check to the  negotiations evoked a burst of joy from organs of opinion at home and in  the Cape, whose articles were unfortunately telegraphed to Pretoria.  Worse still, the cry of \"Avenge Majuba\" was frequently heard in the  Colonies, and sometimes even in England.    The story of the negotiations which followed during the months of July,  August and September, cannot be told fully here, because it is long and  intricate, nor summarized, because the fairness of any summary not  supported by citations would be disputed. There are, however, some  phenomena in the process of drifting towards war which may be concisely  noticed.    One of these is that the contending parties were at one moment all but  agreed. The Transvaal Government offered to give the suffrage after five  years residence (which was what had been asked by the High Commissioner  at Bloemfontein) coupled with certain conditions, which had little  importance, and were afterwards so explained as to have even less. This  was, from their point of view, a great concession, one to which they  expected opposition from the more conservative section of their own  burghers. The British negotiators, though they have since stated that  they meant substantially to accept this proposal, sent a reply whose  treatment of the conditions was understood as a refusal, and which  appeared to raise further questions; and when the Transvaal went back to  a previous offer, which had previously been held to furnish a basis for  agreement, the British Government declined to recur to that basis, as  being no longer tenable after the later offer. The Boers, who had  expected (from informal communications) that the five years offer would  be readily accepted, seem to have thought that there was no longer any  chance of a settlement, because fresh demands would follow each  concession. They ought, however, to have persevered with their five  years offer, which they could the more easily have done because they had  tacitly dropped the unsustainable claim to be a \"sovereign and  independent state,\" and expressed themselves ready to abide by the  Convention of 1884. The British Government, on its part, would seem to  have thought, when the five years offer was withdrawn because the  conditions attached to it were not accepted, that the Boers had been  trifling with them, and resolved to exact all they demanded, even though  less than all would have represented a diplomatic victory. Thus a  conflict was precipitated which a more cautious and tactful policy might  have avoided.    The controversy continued through three months to turn on the question  of the franchise, nor were any demands for the redress of Uitlander  grievances ever formulated and addressed to the Transvaal either under  the Convention of 1884 or in respect of the general rights at  international law which Britain possessed. When the franchise  negotiations came to an _impasse_, the British Government announced  (September 22nd) that their demands and scheme for a \"final settlement  of the issues created by the policy of the Republic\"--a phrase which  pointed to something more than the redress of grievances--would be  presented to the Republic. These demands, however, never were presented  at all. After an interval of seventeen days from the announcement just  mentioned, the Transvaal declared war (October 9th and 11th). The terms  of their ultimatum were offensive and peremptory, such as no Government  could have been expected to listen to. Apart, however, from the language  of the ultimatum, a declaration of war must have been looked for. From  the middle of July the British Government had been strengthening its  garrison in South Africa, and the despatch of one body of troops after  another had been proclaimed with much emphasis in the English  newspapers. Early in October it was announced that the Reserves would be  called out and a powerful force despatched. The Transvaal had meantime  been also preparing for war, so that the sending of British troops might  well, after the beginning of September, be justified as a necessary  precaution, since the forces then in South Africa were inferior in  numbers to those the Boers could muster. But when the latter knew that  an overwhelming force would soon confront them, and draw round them a  net of steel, whence they could not escape, they resolved to seize the  only advantage they possessed, the advantage of time, and to smite  before their enemy was ready. It was therefore, only in a technical or  formal sense that they can be said to have begun the war; for a weak  State, which sees its enemy approach with a power that will soon be  irresistible, has only two alternatives, to submit or to attack at once.  In such a quarrel the responsibility does not necessarily rest with  those who strike first. It rests with those whose action has made  bloodshed inevitable.    A singular result of the course things took was that war broke out  before any legitimate _casus belli_ had arisen. Some one has observed  that whereas many wars have been waged to gain subjects, none was ever  waged before to get rid of subjects by making it easier for them to pass  under another allegiance. The franchise, however, did not constitute a  legitimate cause of war, for the British Government always admitted they  had no right to demand it. The real cause of war was the menacing  language of Britain, coupled with her preparations for war. These led  the Boers also to arm, and, as happened with the arming and  counter-arming of Prussia and Austria in 1866, when each expected an  attack from the other, war inevitably followed. To brandish the sword  before a cause for war has been shown not only impairs the prospect of a  peaceful settlement, but may give the world ground for believing that  war is intended.    By making the concession of the franchise the aim of their efforts, and  supporting it by demonstrations which drove their antagonist to arms,  the British Government placed themselves before the world in the  position of having caused a war without ever formulating a _casus  belli_, and thereby exposed their country to unfavourable comment from  other nations. The British negotiators were, it may be said, placed in a  dilemma by the distance which separated their army from South Africa,  and which obliged them to move troops earlier than they need otherwise  have done, even at the risk (which, however, they do not seem to have  fully grasped) of precipitating war. But this difficulty might have been  avoided in one of two ways. They might have pressed their suggestion for  an extension of the franchise in an amicable way, without threats and  without moving troops, and have thereby kept matters from coming to a  crisis. Or, on the other hand, if they thought that the doggedness of  the Transvaal would yield to nothing but threats, they might have  formulated demands, not for the franchise, but for the redress of  grievances, demands the refusal or evasion of which would constitute a  proper cause of war, and have, simultaneously with the presentation of  those demands, sent to South Africa a force sufficient at least for the  defence of their own territory. The course actually taken missed the  advantages of either of these courses. It brought on war before the  Colonies were in a due state of defence, and it failed to justify war by  showing any cause for it such as the usage of civilized States  recognizes.    As Cavour said that any one can govern with a state of siege, so strong  Powers dealing with weak ones are prone to think that any kind of  diplomacy will do. The British Government, confident in its strength,  seems to have overlooked not only the need for taking up a sound legal  position, but the importance of retaining the good will of the Colonial  Dutch, and of preventing the Orange Free State from taking sides with  the Transvaal. This was sure to happen if Britain was, or seemed to be,  the aggressor. Now the British Government by the attitude of menace it  adopted while discussing the franchise question, which furnished no  cause for war, by the importance it seemed to attach to the utterances  of the body calling itself the Uitlander Council in Johannesburg (a body  which was in the strongest opposition to the Transvaal authorities), as  well as by other methods scarcely consistent with diplomatic usage, led  both the Transvaal and the Free State to believe that they meant to  press matters to extremities, and that much more than the franchise or  the removal of certain grievances was involved; in fact, that the  independence of the Republic itself was at stake.[2]    They cannot have intended this, and indeed they expressly disclaimed  designs on the independence of the Transvaal. Nevertheless the Free  State, when it saw negotiations stopped after September 22nd, and an  overwhelming British force ordered to South Africa while the proposals  foreshadowed in the despatch of September 22nd remained undisclosed,  became convinced that Britain meant to crush the Transvaal. Being bound  by treaty to support the Transvaal if the latter was unjustly attacked,  and holding the conduct of Britain in refusing arbitration and resorting  to force without a _casus belli_ to constitute an unjust attack, the  Free State Volksraad and burghers, who had done their utmost to avert  "]]]
