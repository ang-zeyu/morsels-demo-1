I was in court all three days.\" R. Jones emitted a cozy chuckle.  \"Is he a pal of yours? A cousin, eh? I wish you had seen him in  the witness box, with Jellicoe-Smith cross-examining him! The  funniest thing I ever heard! And his letters to the girl! They  read them out in court; and of all--\"    \"Don't, old man! Dickie, old top--please! I know all about it. I  read the reports. They made poor old Percy look like an absolute  ass.\"    \"Well, Nature had done that already; but I'm bound to say they  improved on Nature's work. I should think your Cousin Percy must  have felt like a plucked chicken.\"    A spasm of pain passed over the Honorable Freddie's vacant face.  He wriggled in his chair.    \"Dickie, old man, I wish you wouldn't talk like that. It makes me  feel ill.\"    \"Why, is he such a pal of yours as all that?\"    \"It's not that. It's--the fact is, Dickie, old top, I'm in  exactly the same bally hole as poor old Percy was, myself!\"    \"What! You have been sued for breach of promise?\"    \"Not absolutely that--yet. Look here; I'll tell you the whole  thing. Do you remember a show at the Piccadilly about a year ago  called \"The Baby Doll\"? There was a girl in the chorus.\"    \"Several--I remember noticing.\"    \"No; I mean one particular girl--a girl called Joan Valentine.  The rotten part is that I never met her.\"    \"Pull yourself together, Freddie. What exactly is the trouble?\"    \"Well--don't you see?--I used to go to the show every other  night, and I fell frightfully in love with this girl--\"    \"Without having met her?\"    \"Yes. You see, I was rather an ass in those days.\"    \"No, no!\" said R. Jones handsomely.    \"I must have been or I shouldn't have been such an ass, don't you  know! Well, as I was saying, I used to write this girl letters,  saying how much I was in love with her; and--and--\"    \"Specifically proposing marriage?\"    \"I can't remember. I expect I did. I was awfully in love.\"    \"How was that if you never met her?\"    \"She wouldn't meet me. She wouldn't even come out to luncheon.  She didn't even answer my letters--just sent word down by the  Johnny at the stage door. And then----\"    Freddie's voice died away. He thrust the knob of his cane into  his mouth in a sort of frenzy.    \"What then?\" inquired R. Jones.    A scarlet blush manifested itself on Freddie's young face. His  eyes wandered sidewise. After a long pause a single word escaped  him, almost inaudible:    \"Poetry!\"    R. Jones trembled as though an electric current had been passed  through his plump frame. His little eyes sparkled with merriment.    \"You wrote her poetry!\"    \"Yards of it, old boy--yards of it!\" groaned Freddie. Panic  filled him with speech. \"You see the frightful hole I'm in? This  girl is bound to have kept the letters. I don't remember whether  I actually proposed to her or not; but anyway she's got enough  material to make it worth while to have a dash at an  action--especially after poor old Percy has just got soaked for  such a pile of money and made breach-of-promise cases the  fashion, so to speak.    \"And now that the announcement of my engagement is out she's  certain to get busy. Probably she has been waiting for something  of the sort. Don't you see that all the cards are in her hands?  We couldn't afford to let the thing come into court. That poetry  would dish my marriage for a certainty. I'd have to emigrate or  something! Goodness knows what would happen at home! My old  gov'nor would murder me! So you see what a frightful hole I'm in,  don't you, Dickie, old man?\"    \"And what do you want me to do?\"    \"Why, to get hold of this girl and get back the letters--don't  you see? I can't do it myself, cooped up miles away in the  country. And besides, I shouldn't know how to handle a thing  like that. It needs a chappie with a lot of sense and a  persuasive sort of way with him.\"    \"Thanks for the compliment, Freddie; but I should imagine that  something a little more solid than a persuasive way would be  required in a case like this. You said something a while ago  about five hundred pounds?\"    \"Here it is, old man--in notes. I brought it on purpose. Will you  really take the thing on? Do you think you can work it for five  hundred?\"    \"I can have a try.\"    Freddie rose, with an expression approximating to happiness on  his face. Some men have the power of inspiring confidence in some  of their fellows, though they fill others with distrust. Scotland  Yard might look askance at R. Jones, but to Freddie he was all  that was helpful and reliable. He shook R. Jones' hand several  times in his emotion.    \"That's absolutely topping of you, old man!\" he said. \"Then I'll  leave the whole thing to you. Write me the moment you have done  anything, won't you? Good-by, old top, and thanks ever so much!\"    The door closed. R. Jones remained where he sat, his fingers  straying luxuriously among the crackling paper. A feeling of  complete happiness warmed R. Jones' bosom. He was uncertain  whether or not his mission would be successful; and to be  truthful he was not letting that worry him much. What he was  certain of was the fact that the heavens had opened unexpectedly  and dropped five hundred pounds into his lap.        CHAPTER III    The Earl of Emsworth stood in the doorway of the Senior  Conservative Club's vast diningroom, and beamed with a vague  sweetness on the two hundred or so Senior Conservatives who, with  much clattering of knives and forks, were keeping body and soul  together by means of the coffee-room luncheon. He might have been  posing for a statue of Amiability. His pale blue eyes shone with  a friendly light through their protecting glasses; the smile of a  man at peace with all men curved his weak mouth; his bald head,  reflecting the sunlight, seemed almost to wear a halo.    Nobody appeared to notice him. He so seldom came to London these  days that he was practically a stranger in the club; and in any  case your Senior Conservative, when at lunch, has little leisure  for observing anything not immediately on the table in front of  him. To attract attention in the dining-room of the Senior  Conservative Club between the hours of one and two-thirty, you  have to be a mutton chop--not an earl.    It is possible that, lacking the initiative to make his way down  the long aisle and find a table for himself, he might have stood  there indefinitely, but for the restless activity of Adams, the  head steward. It was Adams' mission in life to flit to and fro,  hauling would-be lunchers to their destinations, as a St. Bernard  dog hauls travelers out of Alpine snowdrifts. He sighted Lord  Emsworth and secured him with a genteel pounce.    \"A table, your lordship? This way, your lordship.\" Adams  remembered him, of course. Adams remembered everybody.    Lord Emsworth followed him beamingly and presently came to anchor  at a table in the farther end of the room. Adams handed him the  bill of fare and stood brooding over him like a providence.    \"Don't often see your lordship in the club,\" he opened chattily.    It was business to know the tastes and dispositions of all the  five thousand or so members of the Senior Conservative Club and  to suit his demeanor to them. To some he would hand the bill of  fare swiftly, silently, almost brusquely, as one who realizes  that there are moments in life too serious for talk. Others, he  knew, liked conversation; and to those he introduced the subject  of food almost as a sub-motive.    Lord Emsworth, having examined the bill of fare with a mild  curiosity, laid it down and became conversational.    \"No, Adams; I seldom visit London nowadays. London does not  attract me. The country--the fields--the woods--the birds----\"    Something across the room seemed to attract his attention and his  voice trailed off. He inspected this for some time with bland  interest, then turned to Adams once more.    \"What was I saying, Adams?\"    \"The birds, your lordship.\"    \"Birds! What birds? What about birds?\"    \"You were speaking of the attractions of life in the country,  your lordship. You included the birds in your remarks.\"    \"Oh, yes, yes, yes! Oh, yes, yes! Oh, yes--to be sure. Do you  ever go to the country, Adams?\"    \"Generally to the seashore, your lordship--when I take my annual  vacation.\"    Whatever was the attraction across the room once more exercised  its spell. His lordship concentrated himself on it to the  exclusion of all other mundane matters. Presently he came out of  his trance again.    \"What were you saying, Adams?\"    \"I said that I generally went to the seashore, your lordship.\"    \"Eh? When?\"    \"For my annual vacation, your lordship.\"    \"Your what?\"    \"My annual vacation, your lordship.\"    \"What about it?\"    Adams never smiled during business hours--unless professionally,  as it were, when a member made a joke; but he was storing up in  the recesses of his highly respectable body a large laugh, to be  shared with his wife when he reached home that night. Mrs. Adams  never wearied of hearing of the eccentricities of the members of  the club. It occurred to Adams that he was in luck to-day. He was  expecting a little party of friends to supper that night, and he  was a man who loved an audience.    You would never have thought it, to look at him when engaged in  his professional duties, but Adams had built up a substantial  reputation as a humorist in his circle by his imitations of  certain members of the club; and it was a matter of regret to him  that he got so few opportunities nowadays of studying the  absent-minded Lord Emsworth. It was rare luck--his lordship  coming in to-day, evidently in his best form.    \"Adams, who is the gentleman over by the window--the gentleman in  the brown suit?\"    \"That is Mr. Simmonds, your lordship. He joined us last year.\"    \"I never saw a man take such large mouthfuls.

Ogle),  \"Plants, again, inasmuch as they are without locomotion, present no  great variety in their heterogeneous parts. For, where the functions  are but few, few also are the organs required to effect them....  Animals, however, that not only live but feel, present a greater  multiformity of parts, and this diversity is greater in some animals  than in others, being most varied in those to whose share has fallen  not mere life but life of high degree. Now such an animal is man.\"    With the great exception of Aristotle, the philosophers of Greece and  Rome made little contribution to morphological theory. Passing mention  may be made of the Atomists--Leucippus, Democritus, and their great  disciple Lucretius, who in his magnificent poem \"De Natura Rerum\" gave  impassioned expression to the materialistic conception of the  universe. But the full effect of materialism upon morphology does not  become apparent till the rise of physiology in the 17th and 18th  centuries, and reaches its culmination in the 19th century. The  evolutionary ideas of Lucretius exercised no immediate influence upon  the development of morphology.        [1] E. Zeller, _Greek Philosophy_, Eng. trans., i., 522      f.n., London 1881.

CHAPTER II    COMPARATIVE ANATOMY BEFORE CUVIER      For two thousand years after Aristotle little advance was made upon  his comparative anatomy. Knowledge of the human body was increased not  long after his death by Herophilus and Erasistratus, but not even  Galen more than four centuries later made any essential additions to  Aristotle's anatomy.    During the Middle Ages, particularly after the introduction to Europe  in the 13th century of the Arab texts and commentaries, Aristotle  dominated men's thoughts of Nature. The commentary of Albertus Magnus,  based upon that of Avicenna, did much to impose Aristotle upon the  learned world. Albertus seems to have contented himself with following  closely in the footsteps of his master. There are noted, however, by  Bonnier certain improvements made by Albertus on Aristotle's view of  the seriation of living things. \"He is the first,\" writes Bonnier, \"to  take the correct view that fungi are lower plants allied to the most  lowly organised animals. From this point there start, for Albertus  Magnus, two series of living creatures, and he regards the plant  series as culminating in the trees which have well-developed  flowers.\"[9]    Aristotle's influence is predominant also in the work of Edward Wotton  (1492-1555), who in his book _De differentiis animalium_ adopted a  classification similar to that proposed by Aristotle. He too laid  stress upon the gradation shown from the lower to the higher forms.    In the 16th century, two groups of men helped to lay foundations for a  future science of comparative anatomy--the great Italian anatomists  Vesalius, Fallopius and Fabricius, and the first systematists (though  their \"systems\" were little more than catalogues) Rondeletius,  Aldrovandus and Gesner.    The anatomists, however, took little interest in problems of pure  morphology; the anatomy of the human body was for them simply the  necessary preliminary of the discovery of the functions of the  parts--they were quite as much physiologists as anatomists.    One of them, Fabricius, made observations on the development of the  chick (1615). Harvey, who was a pupil of Fabricius, likewise published  an account of the embryology of the chick.[10] In his philosophy and  habit of thought Harvey was a follower of Aristotle. It is worth  noting that in his _Exercitationes anatomicae de motu cordis_ (1628)  there is a passage which dimly foreshadows the law of recapitulation  in development which later had so much vogue.[11]    A stimulating contribution to comparative anatomy was made by  Belon,[12] who published in 1555 a _Histoire de la nature des Oyseaux_,  in which he showed opposite one another a skeleton of a bird and of a  mammal, giving the same names to homologous bones. The anatomy of  animals other than man was indeed not altogether neglected at this  time. Coiter (1535-1600) studied the anatomy of Vertebrates,  discovering among other things the fibrous structure of the brain.  Carlo Ruini of Bologna wrote in 1598 a book on the anatomy of the  horse.[13] Somewhat later Severino, professor at Naples, dissected many  animals and came to the conclusion that they were built upon the same  plan as man.[14] Willis, of Oxford and London, in his _Cerebri Anatome_  (1659) recognised the necessity for comparative study of the structure  of the brain. He found out that the brain of man is very like that of  other mammals, the brain of birds, on the contrary, like that of  fishes![15] He described the anatomy of the oyster and the crayfish. He  had, however, not much feeling for morphology.    The foundation of the Jardin des Plantes at Paris in 1626 and the  subsequent addition to it of a Museum of Natural History and a  menagerie gave a great impulse to the study of comparative anatomy by  supplying a rich material for dissection. Advantage was taken of these  facilities, particularly by Claude Perrault and Duverney.[16] In a  volume entitled _De la Mecanique des Animaux_, Perrault recognises  clearly the idea of unity of type, and even pushes it too far, seeking  to prove that in plants there exists an arterial system and veins  provided with valves.[17]    The beginning of the 17th century saw the invention of the microscope,  which was to have such an enormous influence upon the development of  biological studies. It did not come into scientific use until well on  in the middle of the century. Just before it came into use Francis  Glisson (1597-1677), an Englishman, gave in the introduction to his  treatise on the liver an account of the notions then current on the  structure of organic bodies. He classifies the parts as \"similar\" and  \"organic,\" the former determined by their material, the latter by the  form which they assume. The similar parts are divided into the  sanguineous or rich in blood and the spermatic. Both sets are further  subdivided according to their physical characters,[18] the latter, for  instance, into the hard, soft, and tensile tissues. The classification  resembles greatly that propounded by Aristotle, though it is notably  inferior in the details of its working out.    For Aristotle, as for all anatomists before the days of the  microscope, the tissues were not much more than inorganic substances,  differing from one another in texture, in hardness, and other physical  properties. They possessed indeed properties, such as contractility,  which were not inorganic, but as far as their visible structure was  concerned there was little to raise them above the inorganic level.  The application of the microscope changed all that, for it revealed in  the tissues an organic structure as complex in its grade as the gross  and visible structure of the whole organism. Of the four men who first  made adequate use of the new aid, Malpighi, Hooke, Leeuenhoek, and  Swammerdam, the first-named contributed the most to make current the  new conceptions of organic structure. He studied in some detail the  development of the chick. He described the minute structure of the  lungs (1661), demonstrating for the first time, by his discovery of  the capillaries, the connection of the arteries with the veins. In his  work, _De viscerum structura_ (1666), he describes the histology of  the spleen, the kidney, the liver, and the cortex of the brain,  establishing among other things the fact that the liver was really a  conglomerate gland, and discovering the Malpighian bodies in the  kidney. This work was done on a broad comparative basis. \"Since in the  higher, more perfect, red-blooded animals, the simplicity of their  structure is wont to be involved by many obscurities, it is necessary  that we should approach the subject by the observation of the lower,  imperfect animals.\"[19] So he wrote in the _De viscerum structura_, and  accordingly he studied the liver first in the snail, then in fishes,  reptiles, mammals, and finally man. In the introduction to his  _Anatome plantarum_ (1675), in which he laid the foundations of plant  histology, he vindicates the comparative method in the following  words:--\"In the enthusiasm of youth I applied myself to Anatomy, and  although I was interested in particular problems, yet I dared to pry  into them in the higher animals. But since these matters enveloped in  peculiar mystery still lie in obscurity, they require the comparison  of simpler conditions, and so the investigation of insects[20] at once  attracted me; finally, since this also has its own difficulties I  applied my mind to the study of plants, intending after prolonged  occupation with this domain, to retrace my steps by way of the  vegetable kingdom, and get back to my former studies. But perhaps not  even this will be sufficient; since the simpler world of minerals and  the elements should have been taken first. In this case, however, the"]]]
