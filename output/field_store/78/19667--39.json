Nor can we tell whether such an attempt,  if made, was earlier or later than his plea before the court of  Portugal, for this cannot be dated. The latter was probably in 1484.  King John II. was impressed, and referred Columbus's scheme to a council  of his wisest advisers, who denounced it as visionary. Hence in 1485 or  1486 Columbus proceeded to Spain to lay his project before Ferdinand and  Isabella.    On the way he stopped at a Franciscan convent near Palos, begging bread  for himself and son. The Superior, Marchena, became interested in him,  and so did one of the Pinzons--famous navigators of Palos. The king and  queen were at the time holding court at Cordova, and thither Columbus  went, fortified with a recommendation from Marchena. The monarchs were  engrossed in the final conquest of Granada, and Columbus had to wait  through six weary and heart-sickening years before royal attention was  turned to his cause. It must have been during this delay that he  despatched his brother Bartholomew to England with an appeal to Henry  VII. Christopher had brought Alexander Geraldinus, the scholar, and also  the Archbishop of Toledo, to espouse his mission, and finally, at the  latter's instance, Ferdinand, as John of Portugal had done, went so far  as to convene, at Salamanca, a council of reputed scholars to pass  judgment upon Columbus and his proposition.  By these, as by the  Portuguese, he was declared a misguided enthusiast. They were too much  behind the age even to admit the spherical figure of the earth.  According to Scripture, they said, the earth is flat, adding that it was  contrary to reason for men to walk heads downward, or snow and rain to  ascend, or trees to grow with their roots upward.    [Illustration: Columbus begging at the Franciscan Convent.]    [1484-1492]    The war for Granada ended, Santangel and others of his converts at court  secured Columbus an interview with Isabella, but his demands seeming to  her arrogant, he was dismissed. Nothing daunted, the hero had started  for France, there to plead as he had pleaded in Portugal and Spain  already, when to his joy a messenger overtook him with orders to come  once more before the queen.    Fuller thought and argument had convinced this eminent woman that the  experiment urged by Columbus ought to be tried and a contract was soon  concluded, by which, on condition that he should bear one-eighth the  expense of the expedition, the public chest of Castile was to furnish  the remainder. The story of the crown jewels having been pledged for  this purpose is now discredited. If such pledging occurred, it was  earlier, in prosecuting the war with the Moors. The whole sum needed for  the voyage was about fifty thousand dollars. Columbus was made admiral,  also viceroy of whatever lands should be discovered, and he was to have  ten per cent of all the revenues from such lands. For his contribution  to the outfit he was indebted to the Pinzons.    This arrangement was made in April or May, 1492, and on the third of the  next August, after the utmost difficulty in shipping crews for this sail  into the sea of darkness, Columbus put out from Palos with one hundred  and twenty men, on three ships. These were the Santa Maria, the Nina,  and the Pinta. The largest, the Santa Maria, was of not over one hundred  tons, having a deck-length of sixty-three feet, a keel of fifty-one  feet, a draft of ten feet six inches, and her mast-head sixty feet above  sea-level. She probably had four anchors, with hemp cables.    [Illustration: Embarkation of Christopher Columbus at Palos. From an old  print.]    From Palos they first bore southward to the Canary Islands, into the  track of the prevalent east winds, then headed west, for Cipango, as  Columbus supposed, but really toward the northern part of Florida. When  a little beyond what he regarded the longitude of Cipango, noticing the  flight of birds to the southwest, he was induced to follow these, which  accident made his landfall occur at Guanahani (San Salvador), in the  Bahamas, instead of the Florida coast.    Near midnight, between October 11th and 12th, Columbus, being on the  watch, descried a light ahead. About two o'clock on the morning of the  12th the lookout on the Pinta distinctly saw land through the moonlight.  When it was day they went on shore. The 12th of October, 1492,  therefore, was the date on which for the first time, so far as history  attests with assurance, a European foot pressed the soil of this  continent. Adding nine days to this to translate it into New Style, we  have October 21st as the day answering to that on which Columbus first  became sure that his long toil and watching had not been in vain.    [1493-1500]    The admiral having failed to note its latitude and longitude, it is not  known which of the Bahamas was the San Salvador of Columbus, whether  Grand Turk Island, Cat (the present San Salvador), Watling, Mariguana,  Acklin, or Samana, though the last named well corresponds with his  description. Mr. Justin Winsor, however, and with him a majority of the  latest critics, believes that Watling's Island was the place. Before  returning to Spain, Columbus discovered Cuba, and also Hayti or  Espagnola (Hispaniola), on the latter of which islands he built a fort.    In a second voyage, from Cadiz, 1493-1496, the great explorer discovered  the Lesser Antilles and Jamaica. In a third, 1498-1500, he came upon  Trinidad and the mainland of South America, at the mouth of the Orinoco.  This was later by thirteen months and a week than the Cabots' landfall  at Labrador or Nova Scotia, though a year before Amerigo Vespucci saw  the coast of Brazil. It was during this third absence that Columbus,  hated as an Italian and for his undeniable greed, was superseded by  Bobadilla, who sent him and his brother home in chains. Soon free again,  he sets off in 1502 upon a fourth cruise, in which he reaches the coast  of Honduras.    To the day of his death, however, the discoverer of America never  suspected that he had brought to light a new continent. Even during this  his last expedition he maintained that the coast he had touched was that  of Mangi, contiguous to Cathay, and that nineteen days of travel  overland would have taken him to the Ganges. He arrived in Spain on  September 12, 1504, and died at Segovia on May 20th of the next year.  His bones are believed to rest in the cathedral at Santo Domingo,  transported thither in 1541, the Columbus-remains till recently at  Havana being those of his son Diego. The latter, under the belief that  they were the father's, were transferred to Genoa in 1887, and deposited  there on July 2d of that year with the utmost ecclesiastical pomp.    [1500-1507]    As Columbus was ignorant of having found a new continent, so was he  denied the honor of giving it a name, this falling by accident, design,  or carelessness of truth, to Amerigo Vespucci, a native of Florence,  whose active years were spent in Spain and Portugal. Vespucci made three  voyages into the western seas. In the second, 1501, he visited the coast  of Brazil, and pushed farther south than any navigator had yet done,  probably so far as the island of South Georgia, in latitude 54 degrees.  His account of this voyage found its way into print in 1504, at  Augsburg, Germany, the first published narrative of any discovery of the  mainland. Although, as above noted, it was not the earliest discovery of  the main, it was widely regarded such, and caused Vespucci to be named  for many years as the peer, if not the superior of Columbus. The  publication ran through many editions. That of Strassburg, 1505,  mentioned Vespucci on its title-page as having discovered a new  \"Southern Land.\" This is the earliest known utterance hinting at the  continental nature of the new discovery, as separate from Asia, an idea  which grew into a conviction only after Magellan's voyage, described in  the next chapter. In 1507 appeared at St. Die, near Strassburg, a  four-page pamphlet by one Lud, secretary to the Duke of Lorraine,  describing Vespucci's voyages and speaking of the Indians as the  \"American race.\" This pamphlet came out the same year in another form,  as part of a book entitled \"Introduction to Cosmography,\" prepared by  Martin Waldseemuller, under the nom de plume of \"Hylacomylus.\" In this  book the new \"part of the world\" is distinctly called \"THE LAND OF  AMERICUS, OR AMERICA,\" There is some evidence that Vespucci at least  connived at the misapprehension which brought him his renown--as  undeserved as it has become permanent--but this cannot be regarded as  proved.    [Illustration: Amerigo Vespucci. Fac-simile of an old print.]        CHAPTER II.    EARLY SPANISH AMERICA    [1498]    As we have seen, Spain by no means deserves the entire credit of  bringing the western continent to men's knowledge. Columbus himself was  an Italian. So was Marco Polo, his inspirer, and also Toscanelli, his  instructor, by whose chart he sailed his ever-memorable voyage. To  Portugal as well Columbus was much indebted, despite his rebuff there.  Portugal then led the world in the art of navigation and in enthusiasm  for discovery. Nor, probably, would Columbus have asked her aid in vain,  had she not previously committed herself to the enterprise of reaching  India eastward, a purpose brilliantly fulfilled when, in 1498, Vasco da  Gama rounded the Cape of Good Hope and sailed to Calicut, on the coast  of Malabar. Already before this Spain and Portugal were rivals in the  search for new lands, and Pope Alexander VI. had had to be appealed to,  to fix their fields. By his bull of May 3, 4, 1493, he ordained as the  separating line the meridian passing through a point one hundred leagues  west of the Azores, where Columbus had observed the needle of his  compass to point without deflection toward the north star."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20927"],[0,"A Critical Exposition of the Popular 'Jihád' (#5)"],[1,"their families from insult. But no insult or annoyance of any kind was  offered by the Coreish. Nor was the slightest attempt made to detain  them; although it was not unreasonable that they should have been  detained as hostages against any hostile incursion from Medina\"[A]. They  were contemplating a grand pursuit and attack on the Moslems, and had no  reason to detain the families of Mahomet and Abu Bakr as hostages whilst  they could not think that the Moslems will take the initiative, as they  were too glad to escape and live unmolested.]    [Footnote A: Muir's Life of Mahomet, Vol II, page 265.]      [Sidenote: The three battles waged by the Koreish against Mohammad.]    7. The Koreish carried on three aggressive battles against the Moslems  at Medina. The first, called the Battle of Badr, took place at thirty  miles from Medina, the Koreish having come down 250 miles from Mecca.  The second, called the Battle of Ohad, was fought at a distance of one  mile from Medina, the enemy having advanced 250 miles from Mecca. The  third was the battle of confederates, in which they had mustered an army  of ten thousand strong. The city was besieged for several days, and the  Moslems defended themselves within the walls of Medina which they had  entrenched. These were the only battles between the Koreish and  Mohammad, in each the latter always acted on the defensive. Neither he  attacked the Koreish offensively to take revenge, nor to compel them by  force of arms to accept his religion.    [Sidenote: These wars were purely in defence, not to redress their  wrongs or to establish their rights.]    Even these three battles were not waged by Mohammad to redress wrong or  establish imperilled rights. They were only to repel force by right of  self-defence. Had Mohammad and his Moslems invaded Mecca and fought  battles against the Koreish there, he would have been justified for  waging war to redress the injuries of person and property inflicted by  the Meccans on the Moslems whom they were tormenting for their religion  and had expelled them from their homes, and had even barred their  yearly visitation to the shrine of Kaaba. A war which is undertaken for  just causes, to repel or avert wrongful force, or to establish a right,  is sanctioned by every law, religious, moral or political.      [Sidenote: The battle of Badr was defensive.]    8. Sir W. Muir, the great advocate for the aggressive Koreish, holds  that the war of Badr was \"brought on by Mahomet himself,\"[4] and that he  intended to surprise the caravan of the Koreish returning from Syria  under the charge of Abu Sofian, and had come out to Medina to waylay it.  Abu Sofian sent for an army of the Koreish for his aid, and thus  commenced the battle of Badr. I have given my reasons at pages 74-76 of  the book to show that this is a false account. I will point out from  contemporary records, _i.e._, the Koran, that Mohammad neither meant,  nor had he come out of Medina, to attack the caravan.    [Sidenote: Reasons for the same.]    I. The verses 5 and 6 of Sura VIII[5] show that a part of the believers  were quite averse to Mohammad's coming out of Medina on the occasion of  the battle of Badr. Had their mission been one of plundering rich  caravans, as it is generally alleged, there could be no reason for that  aversion of a party of believers who are accused so often of a hostile  attitude towards the Koreish, and possessed of that great love of booty  and adventure so prominent among the Arabs. The fact is, a party of  believers had disputed with Mohammad the necessity of the combat and its  probable result outside Medina. They preferred to defend themselves  within its walls. This argument is against the allegation that Mohammad  with his followers had started to waylay the caravan, and the Koreish  had come only to rescue it.    II. The 43rd[6] verse of the same Sura shows that it was by a mere  accident or coincidence that all the three parties of the Moslems, the  Koreshite army and the caravan had arrived, and encamped close to Badr  in front of each other. This is an argument against those who say that  Mohammad had intentionally come to Badr to waylay the caravan there.[7]  There was, in fact, no predetermination on the part of Mohammad either  to waylay the caravan, or encounter the Koreish army at Badr. Mohammad  with his followers had come out only to check the advancing enemy in his  self-defence.    III. The seventh[8] verse of the same Sura shows that while the parties  had so accidentally encamped close to each other, the Moslems had  desired then and there only to attack the caravan, as a reprisal or by  way of retaliation, instead of combating with the Koreish army. This is  an argument in support of my contention that there was no previous  arrangement to attack the caravan.    IV. The same verse also shows that Mohammad had no intention of  attacking the caravan either before his coming out of Medina, as it is  alleged by ignorant people, or after coming at Badr in front of the  enemy's army.    V. Sura VIII, verse 72,[9] which treats of the prisoners of the war  taken at Badr, expressly notes the treachery of the Meccans before their  being taken prisoner, and refers obviously to their aggressively setting  out of Mecca to attack the Moslems at Medina.    VI. Sura IX, verse 13,[10] at a subsequent event of the violation of  the truce of Hodeibia by the Koreish, very distinctly charges them with  attacking first and waging offensive war and being aggressive. As there  was no war or attack from the Koreish on the Moslems before Badr, I  conclude that in the war of Badr the Koreish were aggressive.    [Footnote 4: The Life of Mahomet, Vol. III, page 255, _foot-note_. This  note has been expunged in the New Edition of \"The Life\": _Vide_ page  317.]    [Footnote 5: 5. \"_Remember_ how thy Lord caused thee to go forth from  thy home on _a mission_ of truth, and verily a part of the believers  were quite averse to it.\"    6. \"They disputed with thee about the truth after it had been made  clear, as if they were being led forth to death and saw it before them.\"  Sura VIII.]    [Footnote 6: 43. \"When ye were encamped on the near side of the valley,  and they were on the further side, and the caravan was below you, if ye  have made an engagement to _attack_, ye would assuredly have failed the  engagement; but _ye were led into action notwithstanding_, that God  might accomplish the thing _destined_ to be done.\" Sura VIII.]    [Footnote 7: Muir's Life of Mahomet. New Edition, page 226.]    [Footnote 8: \"And _remember_ when God promised you that one of the two  troops should fall to you, and ye desired that they who had no arms  should fall to you: but God purposed to prove true the truth of his  words, and to cut off the uttermost part of the infidels.\"]    [Footnote 9: \"But if they seek to deal treacherously with thee--they  have already dealt treacherously with God before! Therefore hath He  given you power over them.\"]    [Footnote 10: \"Will ye not do battle with a people who have broken their  covenant and aimed to expel your Apostle and attacked you first? Will  you dread them?\"]      [Sidenote: Mohammad, owing to the attacks, inroads and threatening  gatherings from the Koreish and other Arab tribes, had hardly time to  think of offensive measures.]    9. But Mohammad, harassed and attacked every year by the Koreish and  other hostile Arab tribes, had hardly any time to wage an aggressive war  against his Koreshite foes, to establish his imperilled rights, or to  redress the injuries of the Moslems or his own wrong; much less of  taking up arms to compel them to renounce idolatry and believe in his  Divine mission. During the first year after their expulsion from Mecca,  the Moslems were in constant danger from the ferocity of the Koreish,  and when Mohammad was contracting treaties of neutrality with the  neighbouring tribes, Kurz-bin-Jabir, a Koreish of the desert, committed  a raid upon Medina. In the course of the second year the Koreish fought  the battle of Badr, followed by a petty inroad of theirs upon Medina at  the end of the year. The Bani Nazeer treasoned against Medina by giving  intelligence to, and entertaining, the enemy. In the beginning of the  third year, the nomad tribes of Suleim and Ghatafan, inhabitants of the  plains of Najd, and descendants of a stock common with the Koreish,  twice projected a plundering attack upon Medina. At the same time the  Moslems were defeated at the battle of Ohad, near Medina, by the  Koreish, which circumstance greatly affected the prestige of the  Prophet, who was threatened with a similar fate the next year by his  victorious enemies. With the opening of the fourth year, the inimical  spirit of many of the Bedouins, as well as that of the Jews of Bani  Nazeer, was perceptible, and in various quarters large masses were  organized to act against Mohammad and to take advantage of the defeat at  Medina. The tribes of Bani Asad and Bani Lahyan were brought together to  follow the victory of the Koreish at Ohad. And last, not least, the  Moslem missionaries were cut to pieces at Raji and Bir Mauna. At the  close of the year, the people of Medina were alarmed by an exaggerated  account of the preparations at Mecca to attack Medina as promised last  year (Sura III, v. 176). During the fifth year certain tribes of  Ghatafan were assembling with suspicious purposes at Zat-al-Rikaa and  the marauding bands near Dumatal Jandal threatened a raid upon Medina.  The Bani Mustalik, a branch of Khozaa, hitherto friendly to Mohammad's  cause, took up arms with a view of joining the Koreish in the intended  attack upon Medina. At the end of the year, the Koreish, joined by an  immense force of the Bedouin tribes,[11] marched against Medina, and  laid siege to it for many days. The Bani Koreiza, having defected from  Mohammad, joined the Koreish army when Medina was besieged.    In the beginning of the"]]]
