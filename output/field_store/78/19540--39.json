The form of the opening to produce _aw_  is oval; the form for _ah_ is more nearly square.    [Illustration: FIGURE 6.]    [Illustration: FIGURE 7.]    Figure 7 shows the under jaw relaxed, as it should be in practice, to  enlarge the throat and give roundness and largeness to the tone. The  use of the word _hung_ will accomplish this end.    The vowel sounds illustrated above are embodied in a series of vocal  exercises to be found in Chapter VIII on _Placing the Voice_.          CHAPTER III    BREATH CONTROL      It has been said that \"breathing is singing.\" This statement is  equally applicable to speaking. While the aphorism is not literally  true, it is true that without properly controlled breathing the best  singing or speaking tone cannot be produced, for tone is but vocalized  breath; hence in the cultivation of the voice, breathing is the first  function to receive attention.    For singer or speaker, the correct use of the breathing apparatus  determines the question of success or failure; for without mastery of  the motive power all else is unavailing. For a voice user, therefore,  the first requisite is a well-developed chest, the second, complete  control of it.    It must not be supposed that a singer's breathing is something strange  or complex, for it is nothing more than _an amplification of normal,  healthy breathing_. In contrast, however, to the undisciplined casual  breathing of the general public, the singer is a professional  breather.      THE MUSCLES OF RESPIRATION    There are two sets of respiratory muscles, one for inspiration and  another for expiration,--twenty-two or more in all. The principal  muscles of inspiration are the diaphragm and the intercostal muscles  that elevate the ribs. The chief muscles of expiration are the four  sets of abdominal muscles and the intercostal muscles that depress the  ribs. The diaphragm is _not_ a muscle of _expiration_.      THE DIAPHRAGM    The diaphragm is in form like an inverted bowl (Fig. 8). It forms the  floor of the thorax (chest) and the roof of the abdomen. It is  attached by a strong tendon to the spinal column behind, and to the  walls of the thorax at its lowest part, which is below the ribs. In  front its attachment is to the cartilage at the pit of the stomach. It  also connects with the transverse abdominal muscle. The diaphragm  being convex, in inspiration the contraction of its fibres flattens it  downward and presses down the organs in the abdomen, thus increasing  the depth of the thorax. Expiration depends wholly on other muscles.    [Illustration: FIGURE 8.]    The muscles so far mentioned are all that need \"conscious education;\"  the others will act with them voluntarily, automatically. The  abdominal muscles relax during inspiration and the diaphragm relaxes  during expiration, thus rendering the forces nearly equal, though the  strength is in favor of the expiratory muscles. This is what is  needed, for the breath while speaking or singing must go out under  much greater tension than is necessary for inhalation. Inspiration  should be as free as possible from obstruction when singing or  speaking. Expiration must be under _controlled_ pressure.      THE LUNGS    The lungs are spongy bodies which have no activity of their own beyond  a little elasticity. They are controlled by the muscles of  respiration.    Figure 8 shows the organs of the body in their natural positions. The  diaphragm is relaxed and curved upward, as in expiration. During  inspiration the diaphragm is drawn down until it lies nearly flat.      INSPIRATION    The intercostal muscles raise the ribs. The diaphragm is drawn down by  contraction, thus adding to the enlargement of the chest by increasing  its depth. The abdominal muscles relax and allow the stomach, liver,  and other organs in the abdomen to move downward to make room for the  depressed diaphragm. This causes a vacuum in the chest. The lungs  expand to fill this vacuum and the air rushes in to fill the expanding  lungs.      EXPIRATION    The intercostal, and a part of the abdominal, muscles depress the ribs  and lessen the chest cavity anteriorly and laterally. The abdominal  muscles compress the abdomen and force up the diaphragm which is now  relaxed, thus lessening the depth of the thorax. This pressure forces  the air from the lungs and prepares them for another inspiration.      CORRECT METHOD    That the lateral-abdominal--more accurately chest-abdominal--breathing  is correct and natural for both male, and female, and that the  shoulders should remain as fixed as were Demosthenes' under the points  of the swords hung over them, is now so generally admitted as to need  no argument here. If any one has still a doubt on the subject let him  observe a sleeping infant. It affords a perfect example of  lateral-abdominal breathing, and no one can have a suspicion of sex  from any difference in this function. Among the lower animals sex  shows no difference in breathing at any age. All the peculiarities of  female breathing are the results of habits acquired in after life.    Chest and shoulder heaving are vicious and evidence impeded breathing.  The singer who, forgetting the lower thorax, breathes with the upper  only is sure to fail. Therefore breathe from the _lower_ part of the  trunk, using the whole muscular system cooerdinately--_from below_  upward. In other words breathe deeply, and _control deeply_, but with  the whole body--from below, not with the upper chest only, or with  lateral expansion only, or abdominal expansion only.    Every teacher and pupil should remember that \"singing and speaking  require wind and muscle,\" hence the breathing power must be fully  developed. Weak breathing and failure to properly focus the voice are  the most frequent causes of singing off the key. They are much more  common and mischievous than lack of \"ear.\"    Dr. May tested the breathing of 85 persons, most of them Indians, and  found that 79 out of the 85 used abdominal breathing. The chest  breathers were from classes \"civilized\" and more or less \"cultured.\"    Nature has provided that for quiet breathing when at rest the air  shall pass through the nose. But when a person is taking active  exercise, and consequently demands more air, he naturally and of  necessity opens the mouth so as to breathe more fully. While speaking  or singing the air is necessarily taken in through the mouth.      BREATH CONTROL    Firmness of tone depends upon steadiness of breath pressure.  Steadiness of tone depends upon a control of the breath which allows a  minimum volume of air to pass out under sufficient tension to produce  vocalization.    The tension and flow of breath can be gradually lessened until the  tone vanishes and not even a whisper remains.    Power and largeness of tone depend first upon the =right use of the  resonant cavities=, and second upon the =volume of breath used under  proper control=.    In producing high tones the breath is delivered in less amount than  for the low tones, but under greater tension. Absolute control of the  breath is necessary to produce the best results of which a voice is  capable. Full control of the breath insures success to a good voice;  without it the best voice is doomed to failure.    When muscular action is fully mastered, and the proper method of  breathing understood and established, the muscles of inspiration and  expiration will act one against the other, so that the act of  breathing may be suspended at any moment, whether the lungs are full,  or partly full, or empty. This is muscular control of the breath.  Correct breathing is health giving and strength giving; it promotes  nutrition, lessens the amount of adipose tissue, and reinforces every  physical requisite essential to speaking and singing.      A CURE FOR NERVOUSNESS    It cannot be too widely advertised that the surest remedy for that  torture of singers and speakers, nervousness, is the great  tranquillizer,--quiet, deep breathing, deeply controlled. The breath  of nervousness is quick, irregular, and shallow, therefore, take a  few, slow, deliberate, deep, and _rhythmic_ inhalations of pure air  through the nostrils, and the panting gasp of agitation will vanish.  As a help toward deepening the breath and overcoming the spasmodic,  clavicular habit, inhale quietly and slowly through the nose, or  slowly sip the air through the nearly closed lips as if you were  sipping the inmost breath of life itself.      NECESSITY OF BREATHING EXERCISES    To acquire control of breathing, proper exercises must be  intelligently and persistently followed. In mankind, nature seems to  have been diverted from her normal course so that we seldom find an  individual who breathes correctly without education in the matter.  What we have said on breathing is based on the premise that  respiration involves cooerdinate action of the body from collar-bone to  the base of the abdomen; that is, expanding and contracting the chest  and abdomen simultaneously. This is called \"lateral-abdominal\"  breathing; as the chest is the thoracic cavity, \"abdomino-thoracic\"  has been suggested as brief and more strictly scientific.    Work on any other lines fails to develop the full power and quality of  the voice. Weak breathing is a prime cause of throaty tones. In such  cases an effort is made to increase the tone by pinching the larynx.  But this compresses the vocal cords, increases the resistance to the  passage of the breath, and brings rigidities that prevent proper  resonance. The true way is to increase the wind supply, as does the  organist.      CORRECT BREATHING ILLUSTRATED    The following figures show the outline of correct breathing. The inner  abdominal line shows the limit of expiration; the outer line shows the  limit of full inspiration.    Figure 9 shows the limit of full expiration and inspiration of the  male, side view.  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19142"],[0,"The Devil Doctor (#5)"],[1," I stood up--I could do nothing more for the poor  victim at the moment--and looked about me.    The room was innocent of furniture, save for heaps of rubbish on the  floor, and a tin oil-lamp hung on the wall. The dead Chinaman lay  close beside Smith. There was no second door, the one window was  barred and from this room we had heard the voice, the unmistakable,  unforgettable voice, of Fu-Manchu.    _But Dr. Fu-Manchu was not there!_    Neither of us could accept the fact for a moment; we stood there,  looking from the dead man to the tortured man who had only swooned,  in a state of helpless incredulity.    Then the explanation flashed upon us both, simultaneously, and with a  cry of baffled rage Smith leapt along the passage to the second door.  It was wide open. I stood at his elbow when he swept its emptiness  with the ray of his pocket-lamp.    There was a speaking-tube fixed between the two rooms!    Smith literally ground his teeth.    \"Yet, Petrie,\" he said, \"we have learnt something. Fu-Manchu had  evidently promised Eltham his life if he would divulge the name of his  correspondent. He meant to keep his word; it is a sidelight on his  character.\"    \"How so?\"    \"Eltham has never seen Dr. Fu-Manchu, but Eltham knows certain parts  of China better than you know the Strand. Probably, if he saw  Fu-Manchu, he would recognize him for whom he really is, and this, it  seems, the Doctor is anxious to avoid.\"    We ran back to where we had left Karamaneh.    The room was empty!    \"Defeated, Petrie!\" said Smith bitterly. \"The Yellow Devil is loosed  on London again!\"    He leant from the window and the skirl of a police whistle split the  stillness of the night.          CHAPTER IV    THE CRY OF A NIGHTHAWK      Such were the episodes that marked the coming of Dr. Fu-Manchu to  London, that awakened fears long dormant and reopened old wounds--nay,  poured poison into them. I strove desperately, by close attention to  my professional duties, to banish the very memory of Karamaneh from my  mind; desperately, but how vainly! Peace was for me no more, joy was  gone from the world, and only mockery remained as my portion.    Poor Eltham we had placed in a nursing establishment, where his  indescribable hurts could be properly tended; and his uncomplaining  fortitude not infrequently made me thoroughly ashamed of myself.  Needless to say, Smith had made such other arrangements as were  necessary to safeguard the injured man, and these proved so successful  that the malignant being whose plans they thwarted abandoned his  designs upon the heroic clergyman and directed his attention  elsewhere, as I must now proceed to relate.    Dusk always brought with it a cloud of apprehension, for darkness must  ever be the ally of crime; and it was one night, long after the clocks  had struck the mystic hour, \"when churchyards yawn,\" that the hand of  Dr. Fu-Manchu again stretched out to grasp a victim. I was dismissing  a chance patient.    \"Good night, Dr. Petrie,\" he said.    \"Good night, Mr. Forsyth,\" I replied; and having conducted my late  visitor to the door, I closed and bolted it, switched off the light,  and went upstairs.    My patient was chief officer of one of the P. and O. boats. He had cut  his hand rather badly on the homeward run, and signs of poisoning  having developed, had called to have the wound treated, apologizing  for troubling me at so late an hour, but explaining that he had only  just come from the docks. The hall clock announced the hour of one as  I ascended the stairs. I found myself wondering what there was in Mr.  Forsyth's appearance which excited some vague and elusive memory.  Coming to the top floor, I opened the door of a front bedroom and was  surprised to find the interior in darkness.    \"Smith!\" I called.    \"Come here and watch!\" was the terse response.    Nayland Smith was sitting in the dark at the open window and peering  out across the common. Even as I saw him, a dim silhouette, I could  detect that tensity in his attitude which told of high-strung nerves.    I joined him.    \"What is it?\" I asked curiously.    \"I don't know. Watch that clump of elms.\"    His masterful voice had the dry tone in it betokening excitement. I  leaned on the ledge beside him and looked out. The blaze of stars  almost compensated for the absence of the moon, and the night had a  quality of stillness that made for awe. This was a tropical summer,  and the common, with its dancing lights dotted irregularly about it,  had an unfamiliar look to-night. The clump of nine elms showed as a  dense and irregular mass, lacking detail.    Such moods as that which now claimed my friend are magnetic. I had no  thought of the night's beauty, for it only served to remind me that  somewhere amid London's millions was lurking an uncanny being, whose  life was a mystery, whose very existence was a scientific miracle.    \"Where's your patient?\" rapped Smith.    His abrupt query diverted my thoughts into a new channel. No footstep  disturbed the silence of the high-road. Where _was_ my patient?    I craned from the window. Smith grabbed my arm.    \"Don't lean out,\" he said.    I drew back, glancing at him surprisedly.    \"For Heaven's sake, why not?\"    \"I'll tell you presently, Petrie. Did you see him?\"    \"I did, and I can't make out what he is doing. He seems to have  remained standing at the gate for some reason.\"    \"He has seen it!\" snapped Smith. \"Watch those elms.\"    His hand remained upon my arm, gripping it nervously. Shall I say that  I was surprised? I can say it with truth. But I shall add that I was  thrilled, eerily; for this subdued excitement and alert watching of  Smith's could only mean one thing:    Fu-Manchu!    And that was enough to set me watching as keenly as he; to set me  listening, not only for sounds outside the house but for sounds  within. Doubts, suspicions, dreads heaped themselves up in my mind.  Why was Forsyth standing there at the gate? I had never seen him  before, to my knowledge, yet there was something oddly reminiscent  about the man. Could it be that his visit formed part of a plot? Yet  his wound had been genuine enough. Thus my mind worked, feverishly;  such was the effect of an unspoken thought--Fu-Manchu.    Nayland Smith's grip tightened on my arm.    \"There it is again, Petrie!\" he whispered. \"Look, look!\"    His words were wholly unnecessary. I, too, had seen it; a wonderful  and uncanny sight. Out of the darkness under the elms, low down upon  the ground, grew a vaporous blue light. It flared up, elfinish, then  began to ascend. Like an igneous phantom, a witch flame, it rose,  higher, higher, higher, to what I adjudged to be some twelve feet or  more from the ground. Then, high in the air, it died away again as it  had come!    \"For God's sake, Smith, what was it?\"    \"Don't ask me, Petrie. I have seen it twice. We--\"    He paused. Rapid footsteps sounded below. Over Smith's shoulder I saw  Forsyth cross the road, climb the low rail, and set out across the  common.    Smith sprang impetuously to his feet.    \"We must stop him!\" he said hoarsely; then, clapping a hand to my  mouth as I was about to call out--\"Not a sound, Petrie!\"    He ran out of the room and went blundering downstairs in the dark,  crying:    \"Out through the garden--the side entrance!\"    I overtook him as he threw wide the door of my dispensing room.  Through he ran and opened the door at the other end. I followed him  out, closing it behind me. The smell from some tobacco plants in a  neighbouring flower-bed was faintly perceptible; no breeze stirred;  and in the great silence I could hear Smith, in front of me, tugging  at the bolt of the gate.    Then he had it open, and I stepped out, close on his heels, and left  the door ajar.    \"We must not appear to have come from your house,\" explained Smith  rapidly. \"I will go along to the high-road and cross to the common a  hundred yards up, where there is a pathway, as though homeward bound  to the north side. Give me half a minute's start, then you proceed in  an opposite direction and cross from the corner of the next road.  Directly you are out of the light of the street lamps, get over the  rails and run for the elms!\"    He thrust a pistol into my hand and was off.    While he had been with me, speaking in that incisive impetuous way of  his, his dark face close to mine, and his eyes gleaming like steel, I  had been at one with him in his feverish mood, but now, when I stood  alone in that staid and respectable by-way, holding a loaded pistol in  my hand, the whole thing became utterly unreal.    It was in an odd frame of mind that I walked to the next corner, as  directed, for I was thinking, not of Dr. Fu-Manchu, the great and evil  man who dreamed of Europe and America under Chinese rule, not of  Nayland Smith, who alone stood between the Chinaman and the  realization of his monstrous schemes, not even of Karamaneh, the slave  girl, whose glorious beauty was a weapon of might in Fu-Manchu's  hand, but of what impression I must have made upon a patient had I  encountered one then.    Such were my ideas up to the moment that I crossed to the common and  vaulted into the field on my right. As I began to run toward the elms  I found myself wondering what it was all about, and for what we were  come. Fifty yards west of the trees it occurred to me that if Smith  had counted on cutting Forsyth off we were too late, for it appeared  to me that he must already be in the coppice.    I was right. Twenty paces more I ran, and ahead of me, from the elms,  came a sound. Clearly it came through the still air--the eerie hoot of  a nighthawk. I could not recall ever to have heard the cry of that  bird on the common before, but oddly enough I attached little  significance to it until, in the ensuing instant, a most dreadful  scream--a scream in which fear and loathing and anger were hideously  blended--thrilled me with horror.    After that I have no"]]]
