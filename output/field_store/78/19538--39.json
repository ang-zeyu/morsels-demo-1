So that from what hath beene said, I may  conclude that the silence of Scripture concerning any other world is  not sufficient argument to prove that there is none. Thus for the two  first arguments.      [Sidenote 1: _In Epist. ad Gilbert._]      [Sidenote 2: Part 1. Q. 68. Art. 3.]      [Sidenote 3: Gen. 1. 16]      [Sidenote 4: Gen. 11.]      [Sidenote 5: Sr. _W. Rawly_ c. 7. Sec.. 6.]      [Sidenote 6: l. 2. in Gen. / Psal. 136. 6.]      [Sidenote 7: Wisd. 2. 4. 17. 5. / Ecclus. 43. 3. 4.]      [Sidenote 8: _Com. in c. 1. Gen._]    Unto the third, I may answer, that this very example is quoted by  others, to shew the ignorance of those primative times, who did  sometimes condemne what they did not understand, and have often censur'd  the lawfull & undoubted parts of Mathematiques for hereticall, because  they themselves could not perceive a reason of it, and therefore their  practise in this particular, is no sufficient testimony against us.    But lastly I answer to all the above named objections, that the terme  World, may be taken in a double sense, more generally for the whole  Universe, as it implies in it the elementary and aethereall bodies, the  starres and the earth. Secondly, more particularly for an inferiour  World consisting of elements. Now the maine drift of all these  arguments, is to confute a plurality of worlds in the first sense, and  if there were any such, it might, perhaps, seeme strange, that _Moses_,  or St. _John_ should either not know, or not mention its creation. And  _Virgilius_ was condemned for this opinion, because he held, _quod sit  alius mundus sub terra, aliusque Sol & Luna_, (as _Baronius_) that  within our globe of earth, there was another world, another Sunne and  Moone, and so he might seeme to exclude this from the number of the  other creatures.    But now there is no such danger in this opinion, which is here  delivered, since this world said to be in the Moone, whose creation is  particularly exprest.    So that in the first sense I yeeld, that there is but one world, which  is all that the arguments do prove, but understand it in the second  sense, and so I affirme there may be more nor doe any of the above named  objections prove the cotrary.    Neither can this opinion derogate from the divine Wisdome (as _Aquinas_  thinkes) but rather advance it, shewing a _compendium_ of providence,  that could make the same body a world, and a Moone; a world for  habitation, and a Moone for the use of others, and the ornament of the  whole frame of Nature. For as the members of the body serve not onely  for the preservation of themselves, but for the use and conveniency of  the whole, as the hand protects the head as well as saves it selfe,[1]  so is it in the parts of the Universe, where each one may serve, as well  for the conservation of that which is within it, as the helpe of others  without it.      [Sidenote 1: _Cusanus de doct. ignor. l. 2. c. 12._]    I have now in some measure, shewed that a plurality of worlds does not  contradict any principle of reason or place of Scripture, and so cleared  the first part of that supposition which is applied in the opinion.    It may next be enquired; whether 'tis possible there may be a globe of  elements in that which we call the aethereall parts of the Universe; for  if this (as it is according to the common opinion) be priviledged from  any change or corruption, it will be in vaine then to imagine any  element there, and if we will have another world, we must then seeke out  some other place for its situation. The third Proposition therefore  shall be this.          Proposition 3.    _That the heavens doe not consist of any such pure matter which can    priviledge them from the like change and corruption, as these    inferiour bodies are liable unto._      It hath beene often questioned amongst the ancient Fathers and  Philosophers, what kind of matter that should be, of which the heavens  are framed, whether or no of any fifth substance distinct from the foure  elements, as _Aristotle_[1] holds, and with him some of the late  Schoolemen, whose subtill braines could not be content to attribute to  those vast glorious bodies, but common materialls, and therefore they  themselves had rather take paines to preferre them to some extraordinary  nature, whereas notwithstanding, all the arguments they could invent,  were not able to convince a necessity of any such matter, as is confest  by their owne[2]* side. It were much to be desired, thst these men had  not in other cases, as well as this, multiplied things without  necessity, and as if there had not beene enough to be knowne in the  secrets of nature, have spun out new subjects from their owne braines to  finde more worke for future ages, I shall not mention their arguments,  since 'tis already confest, that they are none of them of any necessary  consequence, and besides, you may see them set downe in any of the  bookes _de Coelo._      [Sidenote 1: _De Coelo., l. 1. cap. 2._]      [Sidenote 2*: _Colleg. Cannimb. De Coelo. l. 1. c. 2. q. 6. art. 3._]    But is it the generall consent of the Fathers, and the opinion of  _Lombard_, that the heavens consist of the same matter with these  sublunary bodies. St. _Ambrose_ is confident of it, that hee esteemes  the contrary a heresie.[1] True indeed, they differ much among  themselves, some thinking them to be made of fire, others of water, but  herein they generally agree, that they are all framed of some element or  other. For a better confirmation of this, you may see _Ludovicus  Molina_, _Euseb. Nirembergius_, with divers others.[2] The venerable  _Bede_ thought the Planets to consist of all the foure elements, and  'tis likely that the other parts are of an aereous substance,[3] as will  be shewed afterward; however, I cannot now stand to recite the arguments  for either, I have onely urged these Authorities to countervaile  _Aristotle_, and the Schoolemen, and the better to make way for a proof  of their corruptibility.      [Sidenote 1: _In Hexam. lib. 4._]      [Sidenote 2: _In opere 6. dierum. disput. 5._]      [Sidenote 3: _In lib. de Mundi constit._]    The next thing then to be enquired after, is, whether they be of a  corruptible nature, [1]not whether they can be destroyed by God, for  this Scripture puts out of doubt.      [Sidenote 1: 2 Pet. 3. 12.]    Nor whether or no in a long time they would weare away and grow worse,  for from any such feare they have beene lately priviledged.[1] But  whether they are capable of such changes and vicissitudes, as this  inferiour world is liable unto.      [Sidenote 1: By Doctor _Hackwell_ _Apol._]    The two chiefe opinions concerning this, have both erred in some  extremity, the one side going so farre from the other, that they have  both gone beyond the right, whilest _Aristotle_ hath opposed the truth,  as well as the Stoicks.    Some of the Ancients have thought, that the heavenly bodies have stood  in need of nourishment from the elements, by which they were continually  fed, and so had divers alterations by reason of their food, this is  fathered on _Heraclitus_,[1] followed by that great Naturalist  _Pliny_,[2] and in generall attributed to all the Stoicks. You may see  _Seneca_ expressely to this purpose in these words,      _Ex illa alimenta omnibus animalibus, omnibus satis, omnibus stellis    dividuntur, hinc profertur quo sustineantur tot Sydera tam exercitata,    tam avida, per diem, noctemque, ut in opere, ita in pastu._[3]    Speaking of the earth, he saies, from thence it is, that nourishment is  divided to all the living creatures, the Plants and the Starres, hence  were sustained so many constellations, so laborious, so greedy both day  and night, as well in their feeding as working. Thus also _Lucan_ sings,      _Necnon Oceano pasci Phoebumque polumque credimus._      [Sidenote 1: _Plutarch. de plac. philos. l. 2. c. 17._]      [Sidenote 2: _Nat. Hist. l. 2. c. 9._]      [Sidenote 3: _Nat. Quaest. lib. 2. cap. 5._]    Unto these _Ptolome_[1] also that learned Egyptian seemed to agree, when  he affirmes that the body of the Moone is moister, and cooler than any  of the other Planets, by reason of the earthly vapours that are exhaled  unto it. You see these ancients thought the Heavens to be so farre from  this imagined incorruptibility, that rather like the weakest bodies they  stood in need of some continuall nourishment without which they could  not subsist.      [Sidenote 1: _I{o} Apost._]    But _Aristotle_ and his followers were so farre from this,[1] that they  thought those glorious bodies could not containe within them any such  principles, as might make them lyable to the least change or corruption,  and their chiefe reason was, because we could not in so long a space  discerne any alteration amongst them; but unto this I answer.      [Sidenote 1: _De coelo. l. 1. cap. 3._]    1. Supposing we could not, yet would it not hence follow[1] that there  were none, as hee himselfe in effect doth confesse in another place; for  speaking concerning our knowledge of the Heavens, hee sayes 'tis very  imperfect and difficult, by reason of the vaste distance of those bodies  from us, and because the changes which may happen unto it, are not  either bigge enough or frequent enough to fall within the apprehension  and observation of our senses; no wonder then if hee himselfe bee  deceived in his assertions concerning these particulars.      [Sidenote 1: _De Coelo. l. 2."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1911"],[0,"Concerning Christian Liberty; with Letter of Martin Luther to Pope Leo X. (#5)"],[1,"things as evil things; so  that whatsoever Christ possesses, that the believing soul may take to  itself and boast of as its own, and whatever belongs to the soul, that  Christ claims as His.    If we compare these possessions, we shall see how inestimable is the  gain. Christ is full of grace, life, and salvation; the soul is full of  sin, death, and condemnation. Let faith step in, and then sin, death,  and hell will belong to Christ, and grace, life, and salvation to the  soul. For, if He is a Husband, He must needs take to Himself that which  is His wife's, and at the same time, impart to His wife that which is  His. For, in giving her His own body and Himself, how can He but give  her all that is His? And, in taking to Himself the body of His wife, how  can He but take to Himself all that is hers?    In this is displayed the delightful sight, not only of communion, but of  a prosperous warfare, of victory, salvation, and redemption. For, since  Christ is God and man, and is such a Person as neither has sinned, nor  dies, nor is condemned, nay, cannot sin, die, or be condemned, and since  His righteousness, life, and salvation are invincible, eternal, and  almighty,--when I say, such a Person, by the wedding-ring of faith,  takes a share in the sins, death, and hell of His wife, nay, makes them  His own, and deals with them no otherwise than as if they were His, and  as if He Himself had sinned; and when He suffers, dies, and descends to  hell, that He may overcome all things, and since sin, death, and  hell cannot swallow Him up, they must needs be swallowed up by Him in  stupendous conflict. For His righteousness rises above the sins of all  men; His life is more powerful than all death; His salvation is more  unconquerable than all hell.    Thus the believing soul, by the pledge of its faith in Christ, becomes  free from all sin, fearless of death, safe from hell, and endowed with  the eternal righteousness, life, and salvation of its Husband Christ.  Thus He presents to Himself a glorious bride, without spot or wrinkle,  cleansing her with the washing of water by the word; that is, by faith  in the word of life, righteousness, and salvation. Thus He betrothes her  unto Himself \"in faithfulness, in righteousness, and in judgment, and in  loving-kindness, and in mercies\" (Hosea ii. 19, 20).    Who then can value highly enough these royal nuptials? Who can  comprehend the riches of the glory of this grace? Christ, that rich and  pious Husband, takes as a wife a needy and impious harlot, redeeming  her from all her evils and supplying her with all His good things. It  is impossible now that her sins should destroy her, since they have  been laid upon Christ and swallowed up in Him, and since she has in her  Husband Christ a righteousness which she may claim as her own, and which  she can set up with confidence against all her sins, against death and  hell, saying, \"If I have sinned, my Christ, in whom I believe, has not  sinned; all mine is His, and all His is mine,\" as it is written, \"My  beloved is mine, and I am His\" (Cant. ii. 16). This is what Paul says:  \"Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus  Christ,\" victory over sin and death, as he says, \"The sting of death is  sin, and the strength of sin is the law\" (1 Cor. xv. 56, 57).    From all this you will again understand why so much importance is  attributed to faith, so that it alone can fulfil the law and justify  without any works. For you see that the First Commandment, which says,  \"Thou shalt worship one God only,\" is fulfilled by faith alone. If you  were nothing but good works from the soles of your feet to the crown of  your head, you would not be worshipping God, nor fulfilling the First  Commandment, since it is impossible to worship God without ascribing to  Him the glory of truth and of universal goodness, as it ought in truth  to be ascribed. Now this is not done by works, but only by faith of  heart. It is not by working, but by believing, that we glorify God, and  confess Him to be true. On this ground faith alone is the righteousness  of a Christian man, and the fulfilling of all the commandments. For to  him who fulfils the first the task of fulfilling all the rest is easy.    Works, since they are irrational things, cannot glorify God, although  they may be done to the glory of God, if faith be present. But at  present we are inquiring, not into the quality of the works done, but  into him who does them, who glorifies God, and brings forth good  works. This is faith of heart, the head and the substance of all our  righteousness. Hence that is a blind and perilous doctrine which teaches  that the commandments are fulfilled by works. The commandments must have  been fulfilled previous to any good works, and good works follow their  fulfillment, as we shall see.    But, that we may have a wider view of that grace which our inner man  has in Christ, we must know that in the Old Testament God sanctified to  Himself every first-born male. The birthright was of great value, giving  a superiority over the rest by the double honour of priesthood and  kingship. For the first-born brother was priest and lord of all the  rest.    Under this figure was foreshown Christ, the true and only First-born of  God the Father and of the Virgin Mary, and a true King and Priest, not  in a fleshly and earthly sense. For His kingdom is not of this world; it  is in heavenly and spiritual things that He reigns and acts as Priest;  and these are righteousness, truth, wisdom, peace, salvation, etc.  Not but that all things, even those of earth and hell, are subject to  Him--for otherwise how could He defend and save us from them?--but it is  not in these, nor by these, that His kingdom stands.    So, too, His priesthood does not consist in the outward display of  vestments and gestures, as did the human priesthood of Aaron and our  ecclesiastical priesthood at this day, but in spiritual things, wherein,  in His invisible office, He intercedes for us with God in heaven, and  there offers Himself, and performs all the duties of a priest, as Paul  describes Him to the Hebrews under the figure of Melchizedek. Nor does  He only pray and intercede for us; He also teaches us inwardly in the  spirit with the living teachings of His Spirit. Now these are the two  special offices of a priest, as is figured to us in the case of fleshly  priests by visible prayers and sermons.    As Christ by His birthright has obtained these two dignities, so He  imparts and communicates them to every believer in Him, under that law  of matrimony of which we have spoken above, by which all that is the  husband's is also the wife's. Hence all we who believe on Christ are  kings and priests in Christ, as it is said, \"Ye are a chosen generation,  a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people, that ye should  show forth the praises of Him who hath called you out of darkness into  His marvellous light\" (1 Peter ii. 9).    These two things stand thus. First, as regards kingship, every Christian  is by faith so exalted above all things that, in spiritual power, he is  completely lord of all things, so that nothing whatever can do him  any hurt; yea, all things are subject to him, and are compelled to be  subservient to his salvation. Thus Paul says, \"All things work together  for good to them who are the called\" (Rom. viii. 28), and also, \"Whether  life, or death, or things present, or things to come, all are yours; and  ye are Christ's\" (1 Cor. iii. 22, 23).    Not that in the sense of corporeal power any one among Christians has  been appointed to possess and rule all things, according to the mad and  senseless idea of certain ecclesiastics. That is the office of kings,  princes, and men upon earth. In the experience of life we see that we  are subjected to all things, and suffer many things, even death.  Yea, the more of a Christian any man is, to so many the more evils,  sufferings, and deaths is he subject, as we see in the first place in  Christ the First-born, and in all His holy brethren.    This is a spiritual power, which rules in the midst of enemies, and is  powerful in the midst of distresses. And this is nothing else than that  strength is made perfect in my weakness, and that I can turn all things  to the profit of my salvation; so that even the cross and death are  compelled to serve me and to work together for my salvation. This is  a lofty and eminent dignity, a true and almighty dominion, a spiritual  empire, in which there is nothing so good, nothing so bad, as not to  work together for my good, if only I believe. And yet there is nothing  of which I have need--for faith alone suffices for my salvation--unless  that in it faith may exercise the power and empire of its liberty. This  is the inestimable power and liberty of Christians.    Nor are we only kings and the freest of all men, but also priests for  ever, a dignity far higher than kingship, because by that priesthood we  are worthy to appear before God, to pray for others, and to teach one  another mutually the things which are of God. For these are the duties  of priests, and they cannot possibly be permitted to any unbeliever.  Christ has obtained for us this favour, if we believe in Him: that just  as we are His brethren and co-heirs and fellow-kings with Him, so we  should be also fellow-priests with Him, and venture with confidence,  through the spirit of faith, to come into the presence of God, and cry,  \"Abba, Father!\" and to pray for one another, and to do all things  which we see done and figured in the visible and corporeal office of  priesthood. But to an unbelieving person nothing renders service or work  for good. He himself is in servitude to all things, and all things turn  out for evil to him, because he uses all things in an impious way for  his own advantage, and not for the glory of God. And thus he is not a  priest, but a profane person, whose prayers are"]]]
