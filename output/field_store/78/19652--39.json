[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20763"],[0,"Carpentry for Boys (#5)"],[1,"when thoroughly mastered. How to care for and handle it will be  referred to in a subsequent chapter. We are now concerned with its uses  only. Each complete kit must have three distinct planes, namely, the  jack plane, which is for taking off the rough saw print surface of the  board. The short smoothing plane, which is designed to even up the  inequalities made by the jack plane; and the long finishing plane, or  fore plane, which is intended to straighten the edges of boards or of  finished surfaces.    [Illustration: _Fig. 6. Jack plane bit._]    THE JACK PLANE.--This plane has the cutting edge of its blade ground so  it is slightly curved (Fig. 6), because, as the bit must be driven out  so it will take a deep bite into the rough surface of the wood, the  curved cutting edge prevents the corner edges of the bit from digging  into the planed surface.    On the other hand, the bits of the smoothing and finishing planes are  ground straight across their cutting edges. In the foregoing we have not  enumerated the different special planes, designed to make beads,  rabbets, tongues and grooves, but each type is fully illustrated, so  that an idea may be obtained of their characteristics. (Fig. 6_a_).    GAGES.--One of the most valuable tools in the whole set is the gage, but  it is, in fact, the least known. This is simply a straight bar, with a  sharpened point projecting out on one side near its end, and having an  adjustable sliding head or cheekpiece. This tool is indispensable in  making mortises or tenons, because the sharpened steel point which  projects from the side of the bar, serves to outline and define the  edges of the mortises or tenons, so that the cutting line may readily be  followed.    [Illustration: _Fig. 6a. Fore-plane bit._]    This is the most difficult tool to hold when in use, but that will be  fully explained under its proper head. Each kit should have two, as in  making mortises and tenons one gage is required for each side of the  mortise or tenon.    CHISELS.--Two kinds are found in every kit--one called the firmer (Fig.  7) and the mortising chisel. The firmer has a flat body or blade, and a  full set ranges in width from three-eighths of an inch to two inches.  The sizes most desirable and useful are the one-half inch, the inch and  the inch-and-a-half widths. These are used for trimming out cross grains  or rebates for setting door locks and hinges and for numerous other uses  where sharp-end tools are required.    [Illustration: _Fig. 7._]    THE MORTISING CHISEL.--The mortising chisel (Fig. 7_a_), on the other  hand, is very narrow and thick, with a long taper down to the cutting  edge. They are usually in such widths as to make them stock sizes for  mortises. Never, under any circumstances, use a hammer or hatchet for  driving chisels. The mallet should be used invariably.    [Illustration: _Fig. 7a._]    TRUSSES.--There should be at least two, each three feet in length and  twenty inches in height.    SAW CLAMPS.--These are necessary adjuncts, and should be made of hard  wood, perfectly straight and just wide enough to take in the narrow  back saw. The illustration shows their shape and form.    THE GRINDSTONES.--It is better to get a first-class stone, which may be  small and rigged up with a foot treadle. A soft, fine-grained stone is  most serviceable, and it should have a water tray, and never be used  excepting with plenty of water.    [Illustration: _Fig. 8._]    AN OIL STONE is as essential as a grindstone. For giving a good edge to  tools it is superior to a water stone. It should be provided with a top,  and covered when not in use, to keep out dust and grit. These are the  little things that contribute to success and should be carefully  observed.    THE MITER BOX.--This should be 14 inches long and 3\" by 3\" inside, made  of hard wood 3/4\" thick. The sides should be nailed to the bottom, as  shown.    [Illustration: _Fig. 9._]    THE WORK BENCH.--In its proper place we show in detail the most approved  form of work bench, fitted with a tool rack to hold all the tools,  conveniently arranged. In this chapter we are more particularly  concerned with the uses of tools than their construction; and we impress  on boys the necessity of having a place for everything, and that every  tool should be kept in its proper place. A carpenter's shop filled with  chips, shavings and other refuse is not a desirable place for the  indiscriminate placing of tools. If correct habits are formed at the  outset, by carefully putting each tool in its place after using, it will  save many an hour of useless hunting and annoyance.    One of the most important things in laying off work, for instance, on  trusses, is the disposition of the saw and square. Our illustration  shows each truss with side cleats, which will permit the user  temporarily to deposit the saw or the square so that it will be handy,  and at the same time be out of the way of the work and prevent either of  the tools from being thrown to the floor.    In the same way, and for the same purpose, the work bench has temporary  holding cleats at the end and a shelf in front, which are particularly  desirable, because either a saw or a square is an encumbrance on a work  bench while the work is being assembled, and tools of this kind should  not be laid flat on a working surface, nor should they be stood in a  leaning position against a truss or work bench.    _Strictly observe these fundamentals_--Never place a tool with the  cutting edge toward you. Always have the racks or receptacles so made  that the handle may be seized. Don't put a tool with an exposed cutting  edge above or below another tool in such a manner that the hand or the  tool you are handling can come into contact with the edge. Never keep  the nail or screw boxes above the work bench. They should always be kept  to one side, to prevent, as much as possible, the bench from becoming a  depository for nails. Keep the top of the bench free from tools. Always  keep the planes on a narrow sub-shelf at the rear of the bench.    If order was Heaven's first law, it is a good principle to apply it in a  workman's shop, and its observance will form a habit that will soon  become a pleasure to follow.          CHAPTER II    HOW TO GRIND AND SHARPEN TOOLS      CARE OF TOOLS.--Dull tools indicate the character of the workman. In an  experience of over forty years, I have never known a good workman to  keep poorly sharpened tools. While it is true that the capacity to  sharpen tools can be acquired only by practice, correct habits at the  start will materially assist. In doing this part of the artisan's work,  it should be understood that there is a right as well as a wrong way.    There is a principle involved in the sharpening of every tool, which  should be observed. A skilled artisan knows that there is a particular  way to grind the bits of each plane; that the manner of setting a saw  not only contributes to its usefulness, but will materially add to the  life of the saw; that a chisel cannot be made to do good work unless its  cutting edge is square and at the right working angle.    FIRST REQUISITE.--A beginner should never attempt a piece of work until  he learns how the different tools should be sharpened, or at least learn  the principle involved. Practice will make perfect.    SAWS.--As the saw is such an important part of the kit, I shall devote  some space to the subject. _First_, as to setting the saw. The object of  this is to make the teeth cut a wider kerf than the thickness of the  blade, and thereby cause the saw to travel freely. A great many  so-called \"saw sets\" are found in the market, many of them built on  wrong principles, as will be shown, and these are incapable of setting  accurately.    [Illustration: _Fig. 10._]    [Illustration: _Fig. 10a._]    [Illustration: _Fig. 11._]    HOW TO SET.--To set a saw accurately, that is, to drive out each tooth  the same distance, is the first requirement, and the second is to bend  out the whole tooth, and not the point only.    In the illustration (Fig. 10), the point is merely bent out. This is  wrong. The right way is shown in Fig. 10_a_. The whole tooth is bent,  showing the correct way of setting. The reasons for avoiding one way and  following the other are: First, that if the point projects to one side,  each point or tooth will dig into the wood, and produce tooth prints in  the wood, which make a roughened surface. Second, that if there are  inequalities in setting the teeth (as is sure to be the case when only  the points are bent out), the most exposed points will first wear out,  and thereby cause saw deterioration. Third, a saw with the points  sticking out causes a heavy, dragging cut, and means additional labor.  Where the whole body of the tooth is bent, the saw will run smoothly and  easily through the kerf and produce a smooth-cut surface.    [Illustration: _Fig. 12._]    Our illustration (Fig. 11) shows a very simple setting block, the  principal merit of which is that any boy can make it, and in the use of  which he cannot go wrong in setting a tooth.    SIMPLE SAW SETTER.--Take a block of wood, a 4 by 4 inch studding, four  inches long. Get a piece of metal one-half inch thick and two inches  square. Have a blacksmith or machinist bore a quarter-inch hole through  it in the center and countersink the upper side so it may be securely  fastened in a mortise in the block, with its upper side flush with the  upper surface of the block. Now, with a file, finish off one edge, going  back for a quarter of an inch, the angle at A to be about 12 degrees.    [Illustration: _Fig. 13. Rip-Saw._]    FILING ANGLES.--In its proper place will be shown how you may easily  calculate and measure degrees in work of this kind. Fig. 12 shows an  approximation to the right angle. B, B (Fig. 11) should be a pair of  wooden pegs, driven into the wooden block on each side of the metal  piece.

It lies about 40[deg] southwest of Ras Alhague,  in Ophiuchus, and a little over 20[deg] west of the bow of Sagittarius.  The fact that it is the most brilliant star in this region of the sky  renders its identity unmistakable. It is one of the reddest stars in  the firmament.    There are several star clusters and double stars to be seen in this  constellation. Their position is indicated in the diagram.    The curved tail of the Scorpion is very conspicuous. [l] and [y] are a  striking pair and the fine clusters above them can be seen with the  naked eye.    A record of a lunar occultation of [b] Scorpii in 295 B.C. is extant.    Note a pair just below [b]. They are known as [[^o]]^1 and [[^o]]^2.    In this region of the sky have appeared many of the brilliant  temporary stars, the first one in astronomical annals being discovered  in 134 B.C.    Scorpius is mentioned by all the early writers on astronomy and is  supposed to be so named because in Egypt it was a sickly time of the  year when the sun entered this sign.    [Illustration: SCORPIUS]          LIBRA (l[=i]'-bra)--THE SCALES. (Face Southwest.)      LOCATION.--Libra is one of the signs of the zodiac, and lies between  Virgo and Scorpius. Its two chief stars, [a] and [b], may be  recognized west of and above the head of the Scorpion.    The star [i] Librae is about 20[deg] northwest of Antares in the Scorpion.  Spica in Virgo, a star of the first magnitude, is a little over 20[deg]  northwest of [a] Librae.    A quadrilateral is formed by the stars [a], [b], [g], [e], which  characterizes the constellation.    The star [a] Librae looks elongated. An opera-glass shows that it has a  fifth-magnitude companion.    [b] is a pale green star. Its color is very unusual.    Lyra, Corona, and Hercules are almost directly overhead in the early  evening, during July and August, and can best be observed in a  reclining position. Thus placed, with an opera-glass to assist the  vision, you may study to the best advantage the wonderful sight spread  out before you, and search depths only measured by the power of your  glass.    When the sun enters the sign Libra the days and nights are equal all  over the world and seem to observe a certain equilibrium like a  balance, hence the name of the constellation.    [Illustration: LIBRA]          CORONA BOREALIS (k[=o]-r[=o]'n[:a] b[=o]-r[=e]-a'-lis)--THE NORTHERN  CROWN.      LOCATION.--A line drawn from [a] Cygni, to [a] Lyrae, and projected a  little over 40[deg], terminates in the Crown, which lies between Hercules  and Bo[:o]tes, and just above the diamond-shaped group of stars in the  head of the Serpent.    The characteristic semicircle resembling a crown is easily traced out.  The principal stars are of the fourth magnitude excepting Gemma, which  is a second-magnitude star and known as the \"Pearl of the Crown.\"    Gemma, sometimes called Alphacca, forms with the stars Seginus and  Arcturus, in Bo[:o]tes, an isosceles triangle, the vertex of which is at  Arcturus.    Close to [e] a famous temporary appeared suddenly May 12, 1866, as a  second-magnitude star. It was known as the \"Blaze Star\" and was  visible to the naked eye only eight days, fading at that time to a  tenth-magnitude star, and then rising to an eighth-magnitude, where it  still remains.    The native Australians called this constellation \"The Boomerang.\" To  the Hebrews it was \"Ataroth\" and by this name it is known in the East  to-day. No two of the seven stars composing the Crown are moving in  the same direction or at the same rate.    [a] Coronae is seventy-eight light years distant and sixty times  brighter than the sun.    [Illustration: CORONA BOREALIS]          HERCULES (her'-k[=u]-l[=e]z)--THE KNEELER.      LOCATION.--A line drawn from either Vega, in Lyra, or Altair, in  Aquila, to Gemma, in Corona Borealis, passes through this  constellation. The left foot of Hercules rests on the head of Draco,  on the north, and his head nearly touches the head of Ophiuchus on the  south.    The star in the head of Hercules, Ras Algethi, is about 25[deg] southeast  of Corona Borealis.    [a] Ophiuchi and [a] Herculis are only about 5[deg] apart.    The cluster 13 M., the Halley Nebula, can be easily seen in an  opera-glass. In a recent photograph of this cluster 50,000 stars are  shown in an area of sky which would be entirely covered by the full  moon.    Hercules occupies the part of the heavens toward which the sun is  bearing the earth and planets at the rate of twelve miles a second or  373 million miles a year.    On a clear night the asterism Cerberus, the three-headed dog, which  Hercules holds in his hand, can be seen.    This constellation is said to have been an object of worship in  Phoenicia. There is a good deal of mystery about its origin. The  ancient Greeks called it \"The Phantom\" and \"The Man upon his Knees.\"    The stars [e], [z], [[^e]], and [p] form a keystone shaped figure that  serves to identify the constellation.    [Illustration: HERCULES]          BO[:O]TES (b[=o]-[=o]'t[=e]z)--THE HERDSMAN, OR BEAR DRIVER. (Face West.)      LOCATION.--Bo[:o]tes lies just west of the Crown, and east of Cor Caroli.  It may be easily distinguished by the position and splendor of its  principal star, Arcturus, which shines with a golden yellow lustre. It  is about 35[deg] east of Denebola, in Leo, and nearly as far north of  Spica, in Virgo, and forms with these two a large equilateral  triangle. A line drawn from [z] to [[^e]] Ursae Majoris and prolonged  about 30[deg] locates it, as does one from [d] Herculis to [g] Coronae  prolonged its length.    The brightest stars in Bo[:o]tes outline a characteristic kite-shaped  figure. Arcturus is mentioned in the Book of Job and is often referred  to as \"The Star of Job.\"    Three stars of the fourth magnitude are situated in the right hand.  They are about 5[deg] north of [[^e]] Ursae Majoris.    Contrast the color of Arcturus with Spica, Antares, and Vega.    The trapezium [b], [g], [d], and [m], was called \"The Female Wolves,\"  by the Arabians; [th], [i], [k] and [l], \"The Whelps of the Hyenas.\"  They knew the constellation as \"The Vociferator.\"    Arcturus is the fourth brightest star in the northern hemisphere. It  is 1000 times the size of our sun and rushes through space toward  Virgo at the astounding rate of ninety miles a second. It is forty  light years distant.    The ancient Greeks called this constellation \"Lycaon,\" a name which  signifies a Wolf. The Hebrew name for it was \"The Barking Dog.\"    [Illustration: BO[:O]TES]          VIRGO (ver'-g[=o])--THE VIRGIN. (Face West.)      LOCATION.--An imaginary line drawn from Antares in Scorpius through  [a] Librae and prolonged a little over 20[deg] strikes Spica, the brightest  star in Virgo, which star is about 30[deg] southwest of Arcturus.    Arcturus, Cor Caroli, Denebola, and Spica form a figure about 50[deg] in  length, called the Diamond of Virgo.    The equator, ecliptic, and equinoctial colure intersect each other at  a point close to the star [[^e]]. This is called the autumnal equinox.    The star [e] is known as the \"Grape Gatherer.\" It is observed to rise  just before the sun at vintage time.    Within the rude square formed by Denebola, and [e], [g], and [b],  Virginis, the telescope reveals many wonderful nebulae; hence this  region of the sky has been called \"The Field of the Nebula.\"    Spica is an extremely beautiful pure white star. It rises a very  little south of the exact eastern point on the horizon.    [g] is a fine double star for a small telescope.    Virgo is mentioned by the astronomers of all ages. By the Egyptians it  was intended to represent the goddess Isis, and the Greeks knew it as  Ceres. Spica represents the ear of corn held in the Virgin's left  hand.    [Illustration: VIRGO]          CANES VENATICI (k[=a]'-n[=e]z ve-nat'-i-c[=i])--THE HUNTING DOGS.  (Face Northwest.)      LOCATION.--Cor Caroli, the bright star in this constellation, when on  the meridian is about 17[deg] south of [e] Ursae Majoris. A line drawn from  [[^e]] Ursae Majoris, through Berenice's Hair, to Denebola, in Leo, passes  through it.    The dogs, Asterion and Chara, are represented as being held in leash  by Bo[:o]tes, the herdsman, in his pursuit of the Great Bear.    Cor Caroli is in the southern hound, Chara, and represents the heart  of Charles II of England. It is a beautiful double star in a small  telescope.    The so-called \"Diamond of Virgo,\" is clearly shown on this plate. It  is formed by connecting with lines the stars Cor Caroli, Denebola,  Spica, and Arcturus.    The fifth-magnitude star La Superba, about 7[deg] north and 2-1/2[deg]  west of Cor Caroli, is especially noteworthy because of the flashing  brilliancy of its prismatic rays.
