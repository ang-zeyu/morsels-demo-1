He became secretary to the Spanish Academy,  quarrelled with his fellow-members, and died at Madrid on the 8th of  November 1873. He is the author of some three hundred and sixty original  plays, twenty-three of which are in prose. No Spanish dramatist of the  nineteenth century approaches him in comic power, in festive invention, and  in the humorous presentation of character, while his metrical dexterity is  unique. _Marcela o a cual de los tres?_ (1831), _Muerete; y veras!_ (1837)  and _La Escuela del matrimonio_ (1852) still hold the stage, and are likely  to hold it so long as Spanish is spoken.

Pineyro, _El Romanticismo en Espana_ (Paris, 1904).    (J. F.-K.)    BRETSCHNEIDER, KARL GOTTLIEB (1776-1848), German scholar and theologian,  was born at Gersdorf in Saxony. In 1794 he entered the university of  Leipzig, where he studied theology for four years. After some years of  hesitation he resolved to be ordained, and in 1802 he passed with great  distinction the examination for _candidatus theologiae_, and attracted the  regard of F.V. Reinhard, author of the _System der christlichen Moral_  (1788-1815), then court-preacher at Dresden, who became his warm friend and  patron during the remainder of his life. In 1804-1806 Bretschneider was  _Privat-docent_ at the university of Wittenberg, where he lectured on  philosophy and theology. During this time he wrote his work on the  development of dogma, _Systematische Entwickelung aller in der Dogmatik  vorkommenden Begriffe nach den symbolischen Schriften der  evangelisch-lutherischen und reformirten Kirche_ (1805, 4th ed. 1841),  which was followed by others, including an edition of Ecclesiasticus with a  Latin commentary. On the advance of the French army under Napoleon into  Prussia, he determined to leave Wittenberg and abandon his university  career. Through the good offices of Reinhard, he became pastor of  Schneeberg in Saxony (1807). In 1808 he was promoted to the office of  superintendent of the church of Annaberg, in which capacity he had to  decide, in accordance with the canon law of Saxony, many matters belonging  to the department of ecclesiastical law. But the climate did not agree with  him, and his official duties interfered with his theological studies. With  a view to a change he took the degree of doctor of theology in Wittenberg  in August 1812. In 1816 he was appointed general superintendent at Gotha,  where he remained until his death in 1848. This was the great period of his  literary activity.    In 1820 was published his treatise on the gospel of St John, entitled  _Probabilia de Evangelii el Epistolarum Joannis Apostoli indole et  origine_, which attracted much attention. In it he collected with great  fulness and discussed with marked moderation the arguments against  Johannine authorship. This called forth a number of replies. To the  astonishment of every one, Bretschneider announced in the preface to the  second edition of his _Dogmatik_ in 1822, that he had never doubted the  authenticity of the gospel, and had published his _Probabilia_ only to draw  attention to the subject, and to call forth a more complete defence of its  genuineness. Bretschneider remarks in his autobiography that the  publication of this work had the effect of preventing his appointment as  successor to Karl C. Tittmann in Dresden, the minister Detlev von Einsiedel  (1773-1861) denouncing him as the \"slanderer of John\" (_Johannisschaender_).  His greatest contribution to the science of exegesis was his _Lexicon  Manuale Graeco-Latinum in libros Novi Testamenti_ (1824, 3rd ed. 1840).  This work was valuable for the use which its author made of the Greek of  the Septuagint, of the Old and New Testament Apocrypha, of Josephus, and of  the apostolic fathers, in illustration of the language of the New  Testament. In 1826 he published _Apologie der neuern Theologie des  evangelischen Deutschlands_. Hugh James Rose had published in England  (1825) a volume of sermons on the rationalist movement (_The State of the  Protestant Religion in Germany_), in which he classed Bretschneider with  the rationalists; and Bretschneider contended that he himself was not a  rationalist in the ordinary sense of the term, but a \"rational  supernaturalist.\" Some of his numerous dogmatic writings passed through  several editions. An English translation of his _Manual of the Religion and  History of the Christian Church_ appeared in 1857. His dogmatic position  seems to be intermediate between the extreme school of naturalists, such as  Heinrich Paulus, J.F. Roehr and Julius Wegscheider on the one hand, and D.F.  Strauss and F.C. Baur on the other. Recognizing a supernatural element in  the Bible, he nevertheless allowed to the full the critical exercise of  reason in the interpretation of its dogmas (cp. Otto Pfleiderer,  _Development of Theology_, pp. 89 ff.).    See his autobiography, _Aus meinem Leben: Selbstbiographie von K.G.  Bretschneider_ (Gotha, 1851), of which a translation, with notes, by  Professor George E. Day, appeared in the _Bibliotheca Sacra and American  Biblical Repository_, Nos. 36 and 38 (1852, 1853); Neudecker in _Die  allgemeine Kirchenzeitung_ (1848), No. 38; Wuestemann, _Bretschneideri  Memoria_ (1848); A.G. Farrar, _Critical History of Free Thought_ (Bampton  Lectures, 1862); Herzog-Hauck, _Realencyklopaedie_ (ed. 1897).    BRETTEN, a town of Germany, in the grand duchy of Baden, on the Saalbach, 9  m. S.E. of Bruchsal by rail. Pop. (1900) 4781. It has some manufactories of  machinery and japanned goods, and a considerable trade in timber and  livestock. Bretten was the birthplace of Melanchthon (1497), and in  addition to a [v.04 p.0503] statue of him by Drake, a memorial hall,  containing a collection of his writings and busts and pictures of his  famous contemporaries, has been erected.    BRETWALDA, a word used in the _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_ under the date 827,  and also in a charter of AEthelstan, king of the English. It appears in  several variant forms (_brytenwalda_, _bretenanwealda_, &c.), and means  most probably \"lord of the Britons\" or \"lord of Britain\"; for although the  derivation of the word is uncertain, its earlier syllable seems to be  cognate with the words Briton and Britannia. In the _Chronicle_ the title  is given to Ecgbert, king of the English, \"the eighth king that was  Bretwalda,\" and retrospectively to seven kings who ruled over one or other  of the English kingdoms. The seven names are copied from Bede's _Historia  Ecclesiastica_, and it is interesting to note that the last king named,  Oswiu of Northumbria, lived 150 years before Ecgbert. It has been assumed  that these seven kings exercised a certain superiority over a large part of  England, but if such superiority existed it is certain that it was  extremely vague and was unaccompanied by any unity of organization. Another  theory is that Bretwalda refers to a war-leadership, or _imperium_, over  the English south of the Humber, and has nothing to do with Britons or  Britannia. In support of this explanation it is urged that the title is  given in the _Chronicle_ to Ecgbert in the year in which he \"conquered the  kingdom of the Mercians and all that was south of the Humber.\" Less likely  is the theory of Palgrave that the Bretwaldas were the successors of the  pseudo-emperors, Maximus and Carausius, and claimed to share the imperial  dignity of Rome; or that of Kemble, who derives Bretwalda from the British  word _breotan_, to distribute, and translates it \"widely ruling.\" With  regard to Ecgbert the word is doubtless given as a title in imitation of  its earlier use, and the same remark applies to its use in AEthelstan's  charter.

BREUGHEL (or BRUEGHEL), PIETER, Flemish painter, was the son of a peasant  residing in the village of Breughel near Breda. After receiving instruction  in painting from Koek, whose daughter he married, he spent some time in  France and Italy, and then went to Antwerp, where he was elected into the  Academy in 1551. He finally settled at Brussels and died there. The  subjects of his pictures are chiefly humorous figures, like those of D.  Teniers; and if he wants the delicate touch and silvery clearness of that  master, he has abundant spirit and comic power. He is said to have died  about the year 1570 at the age of sixty; other accounts give 1590 as the  date of his death.    His son PIETER, the younger (1564-1637), known as \"Hell\" Breughel, was born  in Brussels and died at Antwerp, where his \"Christ bearing the Cross\" is in  the museum.    Another son JAN (c. 1569-1642), known as \"Velvet\" Breughel, was born at  Brussels. He first applied himself to painting flowers and fruits, and  afterwards acquired considerable reputation by his landscapes and  sea-pieces. After residing long at Cologne he travelled into Italy, where  his landscapes, adorned with small figures, were greatly admired. He left a  large number of pictures, chiefly landscapes, which are executed with great  skill. Rubens made use of Breughel's hand in the landscape part of several  of his small pictures--such as his \"Vertumnus and Pomona,\" the \"Satyr  viewing the Sleeping Nymph,\" and the \"Terrestrial Paradise.\"    BREVET (a diminutive of the Fr. _bref_), a short writing, originally an  official writing or letter, with the particular meaning of a papal  indulgence.

These marks are not uncommon in such cases. Sir Michael  had resided in the East and had contracted a form of plague. Virtually  he died from it. The thing is highly contagious, and it is almost  impossible to rid the system of it. A girl died in one of the  hospitals this week, having identical marks on the throat.\" He turned  to his son. \"You saw her, Rob?\"    Robert Cairn nodded, and finally the local man withdrew, highly  mystified, but unable to contradict so celebrated a physician as Dr.  Bruce Cairn.    The latter seated himself in an armchair, and rested his chin in the  palm of his left hand. Robert Cairn paced restlessly about the  library. Both were waiting, expectantly. At half-past two Felton  brought in a tray of refreshments, but neither of the men attempted  to avail themselves of the hospitality.    \"Miss Duquesne?\" asked the younger.    \"She has just gone to sleep, sir.\"    \"Good,\" muttered Dr. Cairn. \"Blessed is youth.\"    Silence fell again, upon the man's departure, to be broken but rarely,  despite the tumultuous thoughts of those two minds, until, at about a  quarter to three, the faint sound of a throbbing motor brought Dr.  Cairn sharply to his feet. He looked towards the window. Dawn was  breaking. The car came roaring along the avenue and stopped outside  the house.    Dr. Cairn and his son glanced at one another. A brief tumult and  hurried exchange of words sounded in the hall; footsteps were heard  ascending the stairs, then came silence. The two stood side by side in  front of the empty hearth, a haggard pair, fitly set in that desolate  room, with the yellowing rays of the lamps shrinking before the first  spears of dawn.    Then, without warning, the door opened slowly and deliberately, and  Antony Ferrara came in.    His face was expressionless, ivory; his red lips were firm, and he  drooped his head. But the long black eyes glinted and gleamed as if  they reflected the glow from a furnace. He wore a motor coat lined  with leopard skin and he was pulling off his heavy gloves.    \"It is good of you to have waited, Doctor,\" he said in his huskily  musical voice--\"you too, Cairn.\"    He advanced a few steps into the room. Cairn was conscious of a kind  of fear, but uppermost came a desire to pick up some heavy implement  and crush this evilly effeminate thing with the serpent eyes. Then he  found himself speaking; the words seemed to be forced from his throat.    \"Antony Ferrara,\" he said, \"have you read the _Harris Papyrus_?\"    Ferrara dropped his glove, stooped and recovered it, and smiled  faintly.    \"No,\" he replied. \"Have you?\" His eyes were nearly closed, mere  luminous slits. \"But surely,\" he continued, \"this is no time, Cairn,  to discuss books? As my poor father's heir, and therefore your host,  I beg of you to partake--\"    A faint sound made him turn. Just within the door, where the light  from the reddening library windows touched her as if with sanctity,  stood Myra Duquesne, in her night robe, her hair unbound and her  little bare feet gleaming whitely upon the red carpet. Her eyes were  wide open, vacant of expression, but set upon Antony Ferrara's  ungloved left hand.    Ferrara turned slowly to face her, until his back was towards the two  men in the library. She began to speak, in a toneless, unemotional  voice, raising her finger and pointing at a ring which Ferrara wore.    \"I know you now,\" she said; \"I know you, son of an evil woman, for you  wear her ring, the sacred ring of Thoth. You have stained that ring  with blood, as she stained it--with the blood of those who loved and  trusted you. I could name you, but my lips are sealed--I could name  you, brood of a witch, murderer, for I know you now.\"    Dispassionately, mechanically, she delivered her strange indictment.  Over her shoulder appeared the anxious face of Mrs. Hume, finger to  lip.    \"My God!\" muttered Cairn. \"My God! What--\"    \"S--sh!\" his father grasped his arm. \"She is asleep!\"    Myra Duquesne turned and quitted the room, Mrs. Hume hovering  anxiously about her. Antony Ferrara faced around; his mouth was oddly  twisted.    \"She is troubled with strange dreams,\" he said, very huskily.    \"Clairvoyant dreams!\" Dr. Cairn addressed him for the first time. \"Do  not glare at me in that way, for it may be that _I_ know you, too!  Come, Rob.\"    \"But Myra--\"    Dr. Cairn laid his hand upon his son's shoulder, fixing his eyes upon  him steadily.    \"Nothing in this house can injure Myra,\" he replied quietly; \"for Good  is higher than Evil. For the present we can only go.\"    Antony Ferrara stood aside, as the two walked out of the library.          CHAPTER IV    AT FERRARA'S CHAMBERS      Dr. Bruce Cairn swung around in his chair, lifting his heavy eyebrows  interrogatively, as his son, Robert, entered the consulting-room.  Half-Moon Street was bathed in almost tropical sunlight, but already  the celebrated physician had sent those out from his house to whom the  sky was overcast, whom the sun would gladden no more, and a group of  anxious-eyed sufferers yet awaited his scrutiny in an adjoining room.    \"Hullo, Rob! Do you wish to see me professionally?\"    Robert Cairn seated himself upon a corner of the big table, shaking  his head slowly.    \"No, thanks sir; I'm fit enough; but I thought you might like to know  about the will--\"    \"I do know. Since I was largely interested, Jermyn attended on my  behalf; an urgent case detained me. He rang up earlier this morning.\"    \"Oh, I see. Then perhaps I'm wasting your time; but it was a  surprise--quite a pleasant one--to find that Sir Michael had provided  for Myra--Miss Duquesne.\"    Dr. Cairn stared hard.    \"What led you to suppose that he had _not_ provided for his niece? She  is an orphan, and he was her guardian.\"    \"Of course, he should have done so; but I was not alone in my belief  that during the--peculiar state of mind--which preceded his death, he  had altered his will--\"    \"In favour of his adopted son, Antony?\"    \"Yes. I know _you_ were afraid of it, sir! But as it turns out they  inherit equal shares, and the house goes to Myra. Mr. Antony  Ferrara\"--he accentuated the name--\"quite failed to conceal his  chagrin.\"    \"Indeed!\"    \"Rather. He was there in person, wearing one of his beastly fur  coats--a fur coat, with the thermometer at Africa!--lined with  civet-cat, of all abominations!\"    Dr. Cairn turned to his table, tapping at the blotting-pad with the  tube of a stethoscope.    \"I regret your attitude towards young Ferrara, Rob.\"    His son started.    \"Regret it! I don't understand. Why, you, yourself brought about an  open rupture on the night of Sir Michael's death.\"    \"Nevertheless, I am sorry. You know, since you were present, that Sir  Michael has left his niece--to my care--\"    \"Thank God for that!\"    \"I am glad, too, although there are many difficulties. But,  furthermore, he enjoined me to--\"    \"Keep an eye on Antony! Yes, yes--but, heavens! he didn't know him for  what he is!\"    Dr. Cairn turned to him again.    \"He did not; by a divine mercy, he never knew--what we know. But\"--his  clear eyes were raised to his son's--\"the charge is none the less  sacred, boy!\"    The younger man stared perplexedly.    \"But he is nothing less than a ----\"    His father's upraised hand checked the word on his tongue.    \"_I_ know what he is, Rob, even better than you do. But cannot you see  how this ties my hands, seals my lips?\"    Robert Cairn was silent, stupefied.    \"Give me time to see my way clearly, Rob. At the moment I cannot  reconcile my duty and my conscience; I confess it. But give me time.  If only as a move--as a matter of policy--keep in touch with Ferrara.  You loathe him, I know; but we _must_ watch him! There are other  interests--\"    \"Myra!\" Robert Cairn flushed hotly. \"Yes, I see. I understand. By  heavens, it's a hard part to play, but--\"    \"Be advised by me, Rob. Meet stealth with stealth. My boy, we have  seen strange ends come to those who stood in the path of someone. If  you had studied the subjects that I have studied you would know that  retribution, though slow, is inevitable. But be on your guard. I am  taking precautions. We have an enemy; I do not pretend to deny it; and  he fights with strange weapons. Perhaps I know something of those  weapons, too, and I am adopting--certain measures. But one defence,  and the one for you, is guile--stealth!\"    Robert Cairn spoke abruptly.    \"He is installed in palatial chambers in Piccadilly.\"    \"Have you been there?\"    \"No.\"    \"Call upon him. Take the first opportunity to do so. Had it not been  for your knowledge of certain things which happened in a top set at  Oxford we might be groping in the dark now! You never liked Antony  Ferrara--no men do; but you used to call upon him in college. Continue  to call upon him, in town.\"    Robert Cairn stood up, and lighted a cigarette.    \"Right you are, sir!\" he said. \"I'm glad I'm not alone in this thing!  By the way, about--?\"    \"Myra? For the present she remains at the house. There is Mrs. Hume,  and all the old servants. We shall see what is to be done, later. You  might run over and give her a look-up, though.\"    \"I will, sir! Good-bye.\"    \"Good-bye,\" said Dr. Cairn, and pressed the bell which summoned  Marston to usher out the caller, and usher in the next patient.    In Half-Moon Street, Robert Cairn stood irresolute; for he was one of  those whose mental moods are physically reflected. He might call upon  Myra Duquesne, in which event he would almost certainly be asked to  stay to lunch; or he might call upon Antony Ferrara. He determined  upon the latter, though less pleasant course.    Turning his steps in the direction of Piccadilly, he reflected that  this grim and uncanny secret which he shared with his father was like  to prove prejudicial to his success in journalism. It was eternally  uprising, demoniac, between himself and his work. The"]]]
