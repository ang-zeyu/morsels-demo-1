Permit me  to wish you all good night.\"    He crossed the study, and, at the door, paused and turned.    \"Rely upon me, Leroux,\" he said, \"to help in any way within my power.\"    He crossed the lobby, opened the outer door, and departed.    \"Now, Mr. Leroux,\" resumed Dunbar, \"about this matter of your wife's  absence.\"          IV    A WINDOW IS OPENED      Whilst Henry Leroux collected his thoughts, Dr. Cumberly glanced across  at the writing-table where lay the fragment of paper which had been  clutched in the dead woman's hand, then turned his head again toward the  inspector, staring at him curiously. Since Dunbar had not yet attempted  even to glance at the strange message, he wondered what had prompted the  present line of inquiry.    \"My wife,\" began Leroux, \"shared a studio in Paris, at the time that I  met her, with an American lady a very talented portrait painter--er--a  Miss Denise Ryland. You may know her name?--but of course, you don't,  no! Well, my wife is, herself, quite clever with her brush; in fact she  has exhibited more than once at the Paris Salon. We agreed at--er--the  time of our--of our--engagement, that she should be free to visit her  old artistic friends in Paris at any time. You understand? There was to  be no let or hindrance.... Is this really necessary, Inspector?\"    \"Pray go on, Mr. Leroux.\"    \"Well, you understand, it was a give-and-take arrangement; because I  am afraid that I, myself, demand certain--sacrifices from my  wife--and--er--I did not feel entitled to--interfere\"...    \"You see, Inspector,\" interrupted Dr. Cumberly, \"they are a Bohemian  pair, and Bohemians, inevitably, bore one another at times! This little  arrangement was intended as a safety-valve. Whenever ennui attacked Mrs.  Leroux, she was at liberty to depart for a week to her own friends in  Paris, leaving Leroux to the bachelor's existence which is really his  proper state; to go unshaven and unshorn, to dine upon bread and cheese  and onions, to work until all hours of the morning, and generally to  enjoy himself!\"    \"Does she usually stay long?\" inquired Dunbar.    \"Not more than a week, as a rule,\" answered Leroux.    \"You must excuse me,\" continued the detective, \"if I seem to pry into  intimate matters; but on these occasions, how does Mrs. Leroux get on  for money?\"    \"I have opened a credit for her,\" explained the novelist, wearily, \"at  the Credit Lyonnais, in Paris.\"    Dunbar scribbled busily in his notebook.    \"Does she take her maid with her?\" he jerked, suddenly.    \"She has no maid at the moment,\" replied Leroux; \"she has been without  one for twelve months or more, now.\"    \"When did you last hear from her?\"    \"Three days ago.\"    \"Did you answer the letter?\"    \"Yes; my answer was amongst the mail which Soames took to the post,  to-night.\"    \"You said, though, if I remember rightly, that he was out without  permission?\"    Leroux ran his fingers through his hair.    \"I meant that he should only have been absent five minutes or so; whilst  he remained out for more than an hour.\"    Inspector Dunbar nodded, comprehendingly, tapping his teeth with the  head of the fountain-pen.    \"And the other servants?\"    \"There are only two: a cook and a maid. I released them for the  evening--glad to get rid of them--wanted to work.\"    \"They are late?\"    \"They take liberties, damnable liberties, because I am easy-going.\"    \"I see,\" said Dunbar. \"So that you were quite alone this evening,  when\"--he nodded in the direction of the writing-table--\"your visitor  came?\"    \"Quite alone.\"    \"Was her arrival the first interruption?\"    \"No--er--not exactly. Miss Cumberly...\"    \"My daughter,\" explained Dr. Cumberly, \"knowing that Mr. Leroux, at  these times, was very neglectful in regard to meals, prepared him an  omelette, and brought it down in a chafing-dish.\"    \"How long did she remain?\" asked the inspector of Leroux.    \"I--er--did not exactly open the door. We chatted, through--er--through  the letter-box, and she left the omelette outside on the landing.\"    \"What time would that be?\"    \"It was a quarter to twelve,\" declared Cumberly. \"I had been supping  with some friends, and returned to find Helen, my daughter, engaged  in preparing the omelette. I congratulated her upon the happy thought,  knowing that Leroux was probably starving himself.\"    \"I see. The omelette, though, seems to be upset here on the floor?\" said  the inspector.    Cumberly briefly explained how it came to be there, Leroux punctuating  his friend's story with affirmative nods.    \"Then the door of the flat was open all the time?\" cried Dunbar.    \"Yes,\" replied Cumberly; \"but whilst Exel and I searched the other  rooms--and our search was exhaustive--Mr. Leroux remained here in the  study, and in full view of the lobby--as you see for yourself.\"    \"No living thing,\" said Leroux, monotonously, \"left this flat from the  time that the three of us, Exel, Cumberly, and I, entered, up to the  time that Miss Cumberly came, and, with the doctor, went out again.\"    \"H'm!\" said the inspector, making notes; \"it appears so, certainly. I  will ask you then, for your own account, Mr. Leroux, of the arrival of  the woman in the civet furs. Pay special attention\"--he pointed with his  fountain-pen--\"to the TIME at which the various incidents occurred.\"    Leroux, growing calmer as he proceeded with the strange story, complied  with the inspector's request. He had practically completed his account  when the door-bell rang.    \"It's the servants,\" said Dr. Cumberly. \"Soames will open the door.\"    But Soames did not appear.    The ringing being repeated:--    \"I told him to remain in his room,\" said Dunbar, \"until I rang for him,  I remember--\"    \"I will open the door,\" said Cumberly.    \"And tell the servants to stay in the kitchen,\" snapped Dunbar.    Dr. Cumberly opened the door, admitting the cook and housemaid.    \"There has been an unfortunate accident,\" he said--\"but not to your  master; you need not be afraid. But be good enough to remain in the  kitchen for the present.\"    Peeping in furtively as they passed, the two women crossed the lobby and  went to their own quarters.    \"Mr. Soames next,\" muttered Dunbar, and, glancing at Cumberly as he  returned from the lobby:--\"Will you ring for him?\" he requested.    Dr. Cumberly nodded, and pressed a bell beside the mantelpiece. An  interval followed, in which the inspector made notes and Cumberly stood  looking at Leroux, who was beating his palms upon his knees, and staring  unseeingly before him.    Cumberly rang again; and in response to the second ring, the housemaid  appeared at the door.    \"I rang for Soames,\" said Dr. Cumberly.    \"He is not in, sir,\" answered the girl.    Inspector Dunbar started as though he had been bitten.    \"What!\" he cried; \"not in?\"    \"No, sir,\" said the girl, with wide-open, frightened eyes.    Dunbar turned to Cumberly.    \"You said there was no other way out!\"    \"There IS no other way, to my knowledge.\"    \"Where's his room?\"    Cumberly led the way to a room at the end of a short corridor, and  Inspector Dunbar, entering, and turning up the light, glanced about  the little apartment. It was a very neat servants' bedroom; with  comfortable, quite simple, furniture; but the chest-of-drawers had  been hastily ransacked, and the contents of a trunk--or some of its  contents--lay strewn about the floor.    \"He has packed his grip!\" came Leroux's voice from the doorway. \"It's  gone!\"    The window was wide open. Dunbar sprang forward and leaned out over the  ledge, looking to right and left, above and below.    A sort of square courtyard was beneath, and for the convenience of  tradesmen, a hand-lift was constructed outside the kitchens of the three  flats comprising the house; i. e.:--Mr. Exel's, ground floor, Henry  Leroux's second floor, and Dr. Cumberly's, top. It worked in a skeleton  shaft which passed close to the left of Soames' window.    For an active man, this was a good enough ladder, and the inspector  withdrew his head shrugging his square shoulders, irritably.    \"My fault entirely!\" he muttered, biting his wiry mustache. \"I should  have come and seen for myself if there was another way out.\"    Leroux, in a new flutter of excitement, now craned from the window.    \"It might be possible to climb down the shaft,\" he cried, after a brief  survey, \"but not if one were carrying a heavy grip, such as that which  he has taken!\"    \"H'm!\" said Dunbar. \"You are a writing gentleman, I understand, and yet  it does not occur to you that he could have lowered the bag on a cord,  if he wanted to avoid the noise of dropping it!\"    \"Yes--er--of course!\" muttered Leroux. \"But really--but really--oh, good  God! I am bewildered! What in Heaven's name does it all mean!\"    \"It means trouble,\" replied Dunbar, grimly; \"bad trouble.\"    They returned to the study, and Inspector Dunbar, for the first time  since his arrival, walked across and examined the fragmentary message,  raising his eyebrows when he discovered that it was written upon the  same paper as Leroux's MSS. He glanced, too, at the pen lying on a page  of \"Martin Zeda\" near the lamp and at the inky splash which told how  hastily the pen had been dropped.    Then--his brows drawn together--he stooped to the body of the murdered  woman. Partially raising the fur cloak, he suppressed a gasp of  astonishment.    \"Why! she only wears a silk night-dress, and a pair of suede slippers!\"    He glanced back over his shoulder.    \"I had noted that,\" said Cumberly. \"The whole business is utterly  extraordinary.\"    \"Extraordinary is no word for it!\" growled the inspector, pursuing his  examination.... \"Marks of pressure at the throat--yes; and generally  unhealthy appearance.\"    \"Due to the drug habit,\" interjected Dr. Cumberly.    \"What drug?\"    \"I should not like to say out of hand; possibly morphine.\"    \"No"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20293"],[0,"A Popular History of the Art of Music (#5)"],[1,"not possible to the ancients, for want  of correctly tuned scales, and the selection of the proper tone as  key. The only form of combined sounds which they used was the octave,  and rarely the fifth or fourth. The idea of using other combined  sounds than the octave seems to have been suggested by Aristotle,  about 300 B.C. The period from the Christian era until about 1400 A.D.  was devoted to apprentice work in this department of art, the central  concept wanted being a _principle of unity_. After the beginning of  the schools of the Netherlands, about 1400, progress was very rapid.  The blossoming time of the modern art of music, however, cannot be  considered to have begun before about 1600, when opera was commenced;  or 1700, when instrumental music began to receive its full  development. Upon the whole, the former of these dates is regarded as  the more just, and it will be so used in the present work.

THE    Music of the Ancient World.      PRIMITIVE TYPES OF INSTRUMENTS, AND AN ARTISTIC MONODY, WITHOUT REAL  TONALITY.          CHAPTER I.    MUSIC AMONG THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS.      By a curious fortune we are able to form an approximately accurate  idea of the musical instruments in use in Egypt as long ago as about  4000 B.C. The earliest advanced civilization of which any coherent  traces have come down to us was developed along the Nile, where the  equable climate and the periodic inundations of the river raised the  pursuit of the husbandman above the uncertainties incident to less  favorable climates, while at the same time the mild climate reduced to  a minimum the demands upon his productive powers for the supply of the  necessaries of life. This interesting people had the curious custom of  depositing the mummies of their dead in tombs elaborately hewn out of  the rock, or excavated in more yielding ground, in the hills which  border the narrow valley of the Nile. Many of these excavations are of  very considerable extent, reaching sometimes to the number of twenty  rooms, and a linear distance of 600 feet from the entrance. The walls  of these underground apartments are generally decorated in outline  intaglio if the rock be hard; or in color if the walls be plaster, as  is often the case. The subjects of the decorations embrace the entire  range of the domestic and public life of the people, among them  being many of a musical character. One of the first discoveries of  this kind was made toward the close of the preceding century, when  Bruce, an English traveler, found in a tomb at Biban-El-Moulouk  representations of two magnificently decorated harps played by  priests. These have since generally been called \"Bruce's Harpers.\" The  instruments have been represented in many ways by different writers,  the most curious perversion of the facts being found in Burney's  \"History of Music,\" where they have the form of the modern harp.    [Illustration: Harps, pipe, and flute, from an ancient tomb near the  Pyramids.    Fig. 1.    EXPLANATION OF FIG. 1.--(1) Harper, with harp, bent, of seven cords;  over him is inscribed in hieroglyphs sqa em bents (_a_), \"player  [literally \"scraper\"] on the harp.\" (2) Singer, seated; above him, hes  t (_b_) \"singer.\" (3, 4) Similar harper and singer, and same  inscriptions (_c_, _d_).

The oldest of the musical representations are found in tombs near  Thebes, and already we find the art in an advanced state. The  preceding cut shows one of these pictures. A musical group is  represented, consisting of eight figures. Their occupations are  designated by the hieroglyphics above them. The harper is designated  as \"harp scraper.\"    It is not possible to make out in the present state of these drawings  the exact number of strings upon the harps, but explorers agree that  it must have been either five or seven. From the length of the strings  and the structure of the instrument without a \"pillar\" in front for  resisting the pull of the strings, the tones must have been within the  register of the male voice. The long flute played by the figure  bearing the number 8 must also have produced low tones. It is not  plain whether these players are supposed to be all playing at the  same time, or whether their ministrations may have taken place  separately. Most likely, however, they all played and sang together.    [Illustration: Fig. 2.    BRUCE'S HARPERS.]    The most advanced harps found in Egypt were the elegantly colored and  ornamented priestly instruments which Bruce found in what was  afterward discovered to be the tomb of Rameses III, at Biban-El-Moulouk.  The black and white cuts give but a poor idea of the elaborate  structure and rich ornamentation of these fine instruments (Fig. 2).  The instruments are not playing together; each harper plays before his  own particular divinity. They occupy opposite sides in the same hall.  The players, by their white robes and positions, evidently belonged to  the highest order of the priesthood. The harp upon the right is  represented by some writers as having had twenty-one strings; whereas  the one upon the left has only eleven. This would be an interesting  fact if it were well founded. But, unfortunately, the truth is that  the painting was somewhat defaced after Bruce saw it, and it was only  within later years that a clever explorer discovered that by passing a  wet sponge over it the original lines could be made out. According to  Lepsius it has thirteen strings.    In the XXth dynasty, about 1300 B.C., there were harps having  twenty-one strings, of which a good example is shown in Fig. 3. This  instrument, also, is elaborately colored and ornamented in gold and  carving. The strings are shorter than those of Bruce's harpers, and  the pitch was most likely within the treble register. The second  figure clapping hands is marking time. The one upon the right is  playing upon a sort of banjo, of which mention will be made presently.    [Illustration: Fig. 3.]    Some time before the period of the Hyksos, the \"Shepherd Kings\" of  the Exodus, there is a scene of a procession of foreigners presenting  tribute to one of the sovereigns of Egypt. Among the figures is one  playing upon a sort of lyre. Later this instrument became the  established instrument of the higher classes, as it was afterward in  Greece and Rome. Several complete instruments have been found, which,  although dating most likely from a period near the Christian era, are  nevertheless sufficiently like the representations of ten centuries  earlier to make them instructive as well as interesting. Figs. 4 and 5  are from Fetis. One of these lyres had originally six strings, as is  shown by the notches in the cross-piece at the top. They were tuned  approximately by making the cord tense and then sliding the loop over  its notch. From the clever construction of the resonance cases these  instruments should have had a very good quality of tone. In some of  the later representations there are lyres of twenty strings.    [Illustration: Fig. 4.    LYRE AT BERLIN.]    [Illustration: Fig. 5.    FROM THE LEYDEN MUSEUM.]    [Illustration: Fig. 6.    A GROUP OF STREET MUSICIANS.    (1) Woman with tall light harp, of fourteen strings. (2) Cithara. (3)  Te-bouni, or banjo. (4) Double flute. (5) Shoulder harp. (6) Singer,  clapping hands.]    It will be observed that up to this point all the musicians  represented are men. In later representations women are more common.  Fig. 6 represents the entire musical culture of the later empire, this  particular representation belonging apparently to an epoch not more  than a few centuries before the Christian era. The harp in this case  is of a different construction, and lighter than those in the former  examples. It would seem to have been played while the player walked,  for we find it in what seems to be moving processions. The lyre  occupies here the post of honor next the harp. The banjo and double  flute come next, and then a curious instrument of three or four  strings, played while carried upon the shoulder. Several of these  instruments have been found in a very respectable state of  preservation. Their construction is better shown in the illustrations  following:    [Illustration: Fig. 7.]    The tonal relation of these instruments to the larger harps is  difficult to conceive. Wilkinson gives the dimensions of the most  perfect one in the British Museum as forty-one inches long, the neck  occupying twenty-two inches, and the body being four inches wide.    The instrument with the long neck and the short body, seen in Figs. 3  and 6, belongs to the banjo family. Its resonance body consisted of a  sort of hoop, or a hollowed out piece of sycamore, the sounding board  being a piece of parchment or rawhide. Some of these have two strings,  others one; three are occasionally met with. The name of this  instrument was te-bouni, and it was of Assyrian origin. It was  afterward known as the \"monochord,\" and by its means all the ancients  demonstrated the ratios of the octave, fourth and fifth, as we will  later see.    We have no knowledge whatever of the tonal sound of the music which so  interested these ancient players and singers. There is, however, an  ancient poem, called \"The"]]]
