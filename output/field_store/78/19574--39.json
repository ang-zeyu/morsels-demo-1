[Illustration]    50. _When two dots follow the note_ the second dot adds half as much as  the first dot has added, _i.e._, the entire value is seven-fourths that  of the original note.    [Illustration]    51. _When three dots follow the note_ the third dot adds one-half the  value added by the second, _i.e._, the entire value of the triple-dotted  note is fifteen-eighths that of the original note.    [Illustration]    52. _A dot over or under a note_ is called the _staccato mark_ and  indicates that the tone is to be sounded and then instantly released.  [Illustration] In music for organ and for some other instruments the  staccato note is sometimes interpreted differently, this depending on  the character of the instrument.         On stringed instruments of the violin family the staccato       effect is usually secured by a long, rapid stroke of the bow       for each tone; in the case of harp and drum the hand is       quickly brought in contact with the vibrating body, thus       stopping the tone instantly. On the organ the tone is often       prolonged to one-half the value of the printed note before the       keys are released.    53. _The wedge-shaped dash over the note_ (staccatissimo) was formerly  employed to indicate a tone still more detached than that indicated by  the dot, but this sign is really superfluous, and is seldom used at  present. [Illustration]    54. _A tie_ is a curved line connecting the heads of two notes that call  for the same tone. It indicates that they are to be sounded as one tone  having a duration equal to the combined value of both notes. _E.g._, a  half-note tied to a quarter-note would indicate a tone equal in  duration-length to that shown by a dotted half-note; two half-notes tied  would indicate a tone equal in duration to that shown by a whole-note.  (See examples under Sections 49, 50, and 51).    Fig. 30 illustrates the more common variety of tie, while Fig. 31 shows  an example of the _enharmonic[10] tie_.    [Footnote 10: For definition of enharmonic see p. 10, Sec. 27.]    [Illustration: Fig. 30.]    [Illustration: Fig. 31.]    55. The _slur_ is used in so many different ways that it is impossible  to give a general definition. It consists of a curved line, sometimes  very short (in which case it looks like the tie), but sometimes very  long, connecting ten, fifteen, or more notes. Some of the more common  uses of the slur are:    A. _To indicate legato_ (sustained or connected) _tones_, as contrasted  with staccato (detached) ones.         In violin music this implies playing all tones thus slurred in       one bow; in music for the voice and for wind instruments it       implies singing or playing them in one breath.    B. _As a phrase-mark_, in the interpretation of which the first tone of  the phrase is often accented slightly, and the last one shortened in  value.         This interpretation of the phrase is especially common when       the phrase is short (as in the two-note phrase), and when the       tones constituting the phrase are of short duration, _e.g._,       the phrase given in Fig. 32 would be played approximately as       written in Fig. 33.    [Illustration: Fig. 32.]    [Illustration: Fig. 33.]         But if the notes are of greater value, especially in slow       tempi, the slur merely indicates legato, _i.e._, sustained or       connected rendition. Fig. 34 illustrates such a case.         [Illustration: Fig. 34.]         This is a matter of such diverse usage that it is difficult to       generalize regarding it. The tendency seems at present to be       in the direction of using the slur (_in instrumental music_)       as a phrase-mark exclusively, it being understood that unless       there is some direction to the contrary, the tones are to be       performed in a connected manner.    C. In vocal music, to show that two or more tones are to be sung to one  syllable of text. See Fig. 35.    [Illustration: Fig. 35. MENDELSSOHN (_S. Paul_) re-mem-bers His  chil-dren.]         In notes of small denomination (eighths and smaller) this same       thing is often indicated by _stroking_ the stems together as       in Fig. 36. This can only be done in cases where the natural       grouping of notes in the measure will not be destroyed.    [Illustration: Fig. 36. ev-er and ev-er, for ev-er and]    D. To mark special note-groups (triplets, etc.), in which case the slur  is accompanied by a figure indicating the number of notes in the group.  See Fig. 37 (_a_)         The most common of these irregular note-groups is the       _triplet_, which consists of three notes to be performed in       the time ordinarily given to two of the same value. Sometimes       the triplet consists of only two notes as in Fig. 37 (_b_). In       such a case the first two of the three notes composing the       triplet are considered to be tied.         [Illustration: Fig. 37.]         When the triplet form is perfectly obvious, the Fig. 3 (as       well as the slur) may be omitted.         Other examples of irregular note-groups, together with the       names commonly applied, follow.         [Illustration: Doublet. Quintuplet or Quintolet. Sextuplet or       Sextolet. Septolet or Septimole.]    56. The _combination of slur or tie and dots_ over the notes indicates  that the tones are to be somewhat detached, but not sharply so.  [Illustration]         This effect is sometimes erroneously termed _portamento_ (lit.       _carrying_), but this term is more properly reserved for an       entirely different effect, _viz._, when a singer, or player on       a stringed instrument, passes from a high tone to a low one       (or vice versa) touching lightly on some or all of the       diatonic tones between the two melody tones.    57. The horizontal _dash over a note_ [Illustration] indicates that the  tone is to be slightly accented, and sustained. This mark is also  sometimes used after a staccato passage to show that the tones are no  longer to be performed in detached fashion, but are to be sustained.  This latter use is especially common in music for stringed instruments.    58. The combination of _dash and dot over a note_ [Illustration]  indicates that the tone is to be slightly accented and separated from  its neighboring tones.    59. _Accent marks_ are made in a variety of fashions. The most common  forms follow. [horizontal accent symbol] [vertical accent symbol] _sf_  _fz_. All indicate that a certain tone or chord is to be differentiated  from its neighboring tones or chords by receiving a certain relative  amount of stress.    60. In music for keyboard instruments it is sometimes necessary to  indicate that a certain part is to be played by a certain hand. The  abbreviations r.h. (right hand), m.d. (mano destra, It.), and m.d. (main  droite, Fr.), designate that a passage or tone is to be played with the  right hand, while l.h. (left hand), m.s. (mano sinistra, It.), and m.g.  (main gauche, Fr.), show that the left hand is to be employed.    61. _The wavy line placed vertically beside a chord_ [Illustration]  indicates that the tones are to be sounded consecutively instead of  simultaneously, beginning with the lowest tone, all tones being  sustained until the duration-value of the chord has expired. This is  called _arpeggio playing_. When the wavy line extends through the entire  chord (covering both staffs) as in Fig. 38, all the tones of the chord  are to be played one after another, beginning with the lowest: but if  there is a separate wavy line for each staff as at Fig. 39 then the  lowest tone represented on the upper staff is to be played  simultaneously with the lowest tone represented on the bass staff.    [Illustration: Fig. 38.]    [Illustration: Fig. 39.]         The word arpeggio (plural arpeggi) is a derivation of the       Italian word _arpa_ (meaning harp), and from this word _arpa_       and its corresponding verb _arpeggiare_ (to play on the harp)       are derived also a number of other terms commonly used in       instrumental music. Among these are--arpeggiamento,       arpeggiando, arpeggiato, etc., all of these terms referring to       a _harp style_ of performance, the tones being sounded one       after another in rapid succession instead of simultaneously as       on the piano.    62. The sign [crescendo-decrescendo symbol] over a note indicates that  the tone is to be begun softly, gradually increased in power, and as  gradually decreased again, ending as softly as it began. In vocal music  this effect is called _messa di voce_.    63. In music for stringed instruments of the violin family, the sign  [down-bow symbol] indicates down-bow and the sign [up-bow symbol]  up-bow. In cello music the down-bow sign is sometimes written [cello  down-bow symbol].          CHAPTER VI    EMBELLISHMENTS      64. _Embellishments (or graces) (Fr. agrements_) are ornamental tones,  either represented in full in the score or indicated by certain signs.  The following are the embellishments most commonly found: Trill (or  shake), mordent, inverted mordent (or prall trill), turn (gruppetto),  inverted turn, appoggiatura and acciaccatura.    Usage varies greatly in the interpretation of the signs representing  these embellishments and it is impossible to give examples of all the  different forms. The following definitions represent therefore only the  most commonly found examples and the most generally accepted  interpretations.    65. The _trill (or shake_) consists of the rapid alternation of two  tones to the full value of the printed note. The lower of these two  tones is represented by the printed note, while the upper one is the  next"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1951"],[0,"The Coming Race (#5)"],[1,"be a  member of those barbarous tribes, nor, on the other hand, do you seem to  belong to any civilised people.\"    I was somewhat nettled at this last observation, and replied that I had  the honour to belong to one of the most civilised nations of the earth;  and that, so far as light was concerned, while I admired the ingenuity  and disregard of expense with which my host and his fellow-citizens had  contrived to illumine the regions unpenetrated by the rays of the sun,  yet I could not conceive how any who had once beheld the orbs of heaven  could compare to their lustre the artificial lights invented by the  necessities of man. But my host said he had seen specimens of most of  the races differing from his own, save the wretched barbarians he had  mentioned. Now, was it possible that he had never been on the surface  of the earth, or could he only be referring to communities buried within  its entrails?    My host was for some moments silent; his countenance showed a degree of  surprise which the people of that race very rarely manifest under any  circumstances, howsoever extraordinary. But Zee was more intelligent,  and exclaimed, \"So you see, my father, that there is truth in the old  tradition; there always is truth in every tradition commonly believed in  all times and by all tribes.\"    \"Zee,\" said my host mildly, \"you belong to the College of Sages, and  ought to be wiser than I am; but, as chief of the Light-preserving  Council, it is my duty to take nothing for granted till it is proved to  the evidence of my own senses.\" Then, turning to me, he asked me several  questions about the surface of the earth and the heavenly bodies; upon  which, though I answered him to the best of my knowledge, my answers  seemed not to satisfy nor convince him. He shook his head quietly, and,  changing the subject rather abruptly, asked how I had come down from  what he was pleased to call one world to the other. I answered, that  under the surface of the earth there were mines containing minerals,  or metals, essential to our wants and our progress in all arts and  industries; and I then briefly explained the manner in which, while  exploring one of those mines, I and my ill-fated friend had obtained a  glimpse of the regions into which we had descended, and how the descent  had cost him his life; appealing to the rope and grappling-hooks  that the child had brought to the house in which I had been at first  received, as a witness of the truthfulness of my story.    My host then proceeded to question me as to the habits and modes of  life among the races on the upper earth, more especially among those  considered to be the most advanced in that civilisation which he was  pleased to define \"the art of diffusing throughout a community the  tranquil happiness which belongs to a virtuous and well-ordered  household.\" Naturally desiring to represent in the most favourable  colours the world from which I came, I touched but slightly, though  indulgently, on the antiquated and decaying institutions of Europe, in  order to expatiate on the present grandeur and prospective pre-eminence  of that glorious American Republic, in which Europe enviously seeks its  model and tremblingly foresees its doom. Selecting for an example of the  social life of the United States that city in which progress advances  at the fastest rate, I indulged in an animated description of the moral  habits of New York. Mortified to see, by the faces of my listeners, that  I did not make the favourable impression I had anticipated, I elevated  my theme; dwelling on the excellence of democratic institutions, their  promotion of tranquil happiness by the government of party, and the  mode in which they diffused such happiness throughout the community by  preferring, for the exercise of power and the acquisition of honours,  the lowliest citizens in point of property, education, and character.  Fortunately recollecting the peroration of a speech, on the purifying  influences of American democracy and their destined spread over the  world, made by a certain eloquent senator (for whose vote in the Senate  a Railway Company, to which my two brothers belonged, had just paid  20,000 dollars), I wound up by repeating its glowing predictions of the  magnificent future that smiled upon mankind--when the flag of freedom  should float over an entire continent, and two hundred millions of  intelligent citizens, accustomed from infancy to the daily use of  revolvers, should apply to a cowering universe the doctrine of the  Patriot Monroe.    When I had concluded, my host gently shook his head, and fell into a  musing study, making a sign to me and his daughter to remain silent  while he reflected. And after a time he said, in a very earnest and  solemn tone, \"If you think as you say, that you, though a stranger, have  received kindness at the hands of me and mine, I adjure you to reveal  nothing to any other of our people respecting the world from which you  came, unless, on consideration, I give you permission to do so. Do you  consent to this request?\" \"Of course I pledge my word, to it,\" said  I, somewhat amazed; and I extended my right hand to grasp his. But  he placed my hand gently on his forehead and his own right hand on my  breast, which is the custom amongst this race in all matters of promise  or verbal obligations. Then turning to his daughter, he said, \"And you,  Zee, will not repeat to any one what the stranger has said, or may say,  to me or to you, of a world other than our own.\" Zee rose and kissed her  father on the temples, saying, with a smile, \"A Gy's tongue is wanton,  but love can fetter it fast. And if, my father, you fear lest a chance  word from me or yourself could expose our community to danger, by a  desire to explore a world beyond us, will not a wave of the 'vril,'  properly impelled, wash even the memory of what we have heard the  stranger say out of the tablets of the brain?\"    \"What is the vril?\" I asked.    Therewith Zee began to enter into an explanation of which I understood  very little, for there is no word in any language I know which is an  exact synonym for vril. I should call it electricity, except that it  comprehends in its manifold branches other forces of nature, to which,  in our scientific nomenclature, differing names are assigned, such as  magnetism, galvanism, &c. These people consider that in vril they have  arrived at the unity in natural energetic agencies, which has been  conjectured by many philosophers above ground, and which Faraday thus  intimates under the more cautious term of correlation:--    \"I have long held an opinion,\" says that illustrious experimentalist,  \"almost amounting to a conviction, in common, I believe, with many other  lovers of natural knowledge, that the various forms under which the  forces of matter are made manifest, have one common origin; or, in other  words, are so directly related and mutually dependent that they are  convertible, as it were into one another, and possess equivalents of  power in their action.\"    These subterranean philosophers assert that by one operation of vril,  which Faraday would perhaps call 'atmospheric magnetism,' they can  influence the variations of temperature--in plain words, the weather;  that by operations, akin to those ascribed to mesmerism, electro-  biology, odic force, &c., but applied scientifically, through vril  conductors, they can exercise influence over minds, and bodies animal  and vegetable, to an extent not surpassed in the romances of our  mystics. To all such agencies they give the common name of vril.\"    Zee asked me if, in my world, it was not known that all the faculties of  the mind could be quickened to a degree unknown in the waking state,  by trance or vision, in which the thoughts of one brain could be  transmitted to another, and knowledge be thus rapidly interchanged.  I replied, that there were amongst us stories told of such trance  or vision, and that I had heard much and seen something in mesmeric  clairvoyance; but that these practices had fallen much into disuse or  contempt, partly because of the gross impostures to which they had  been made subservient, and partly because, even where the effects upon  certain abnormal constitutions were genuinely produced, the effects when  fairly examined and analysed, were very unsatisfactory--not to be relied  upon for any systematic truthfulness or any practical purpose, and  rendered very mischievous to credulous persons by the superstitions  they tended to produce. Zee received my answers with much benignant  attention, and said that similar instances of abuse and credulity had  been familiar to their own scientific experience in the infancy of their  knowledge, and while the properties of vril were misapprehended, but  that she reserved further discussion on this subject till I was more  fitted to enter into it. She contented herself with adding, that it  was through the agency of vril, while I had been placed in the state  of trance, that I had been made acquainted with the rudiments of their  language; and that she and her father, who alone of the family, took  the pains to watch the experiment, had acquired a greater proportionate  knowledge of my language than I of their own; partly because my language  was much simpler than theirs, comprising far less of complex ideas; and  partly because their organisation was, by hereditary culture, much more  ductile and more readily capable of acquiring knowledge than mine. At  this I secretly demurred; and having had in the course of a practical  life, to sharpen my wits, whether at home or in travel, I could not  allow that my cerebral organisation could possibly be duller than that  of people who had lived all their lives by lamplight. However, while I  was thus thinking, Zee quietly pointed her forefinger at my forehead,  and sent me to sleep.        Chapter VIII.      When I once more awoke I saw by my bed-side the"]]]
