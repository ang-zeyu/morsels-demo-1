He had taken his usual tour through Russia and no trouble had been spared  to impress the Amir with the greatness of the Russian Empire. He had been  given a very good time, and I was much impressed with the pomp and  cordiality with which he was treated. Neither the Governor nor any of the  other officials showed him the usual stand-off manner which in India, for  instance, would have been used towards an Asiatic potentate, whether  conquered by us or otherwise. They dealt with him as if he had been a  European prince--at which the Amir seemed much flattered. He had a  striking, good-natured face with black beard and moustache, and dark  tired eyes that clearly testified to Russian hospitality.    I went to see him off on the steamer which he kept waiting several hours  after the advertised time of departure. He dolefully strode on board over  a grand display of oriental rugs, while the military brass band provided  for the occasion played Russian selections. Everybody official wore  decorations, even the captain of the merchant ship, who proudly bore upon  his chest a brilliant star--a Bokhara distinction received from the Amir  on his outward journey for navigating him safely across the Caspian.    [Illustration: The Amir of Bokhara leaving Baku to return to his  Country.]    The Amir's suite was very picturesque, some of the men wearing long  crimson velvet gowns embroidered in gold, others silk-checked garments.  All had white turbans. The snapshot reproduced in the illustration shows  the Amir accompanied by the Governor of Baku just stepping on board.    There is a regular mail service twice a week in summer, from April to the  end of October, and once a week in winter, on the Caspian between Baku  and Enzeli in Persia, the Russian Government paying a subsidy to the  Kavkas and Mercury Steam Navigation Company for the purpose of conveying  passengers, mails (and, in the event of war, troops) into Persia and  back. There are also a number of coasting steamers constantly plying  between the various ports on the Caspian both on the Russian and Persian  coast.    The hurricane having abated there was a prospect of a fair voyage and the  probability of landing at Enzeli in Persia, so when the Tuesday came I  went on board the old rickety paddle-steamer (no less than forty-five  years old) which was to convey me to that port. She was one of the  Mercury-Caucasus Co. fleet, and very dirty she was, too.    It is perhaps right to mention that for the first time in Russia,  purposeless rudeness and insolence came to my notice on the part of the  ticket officials of the Mercury line. They behaved like stupid  children, and were absolutely incompetent to do the work which had been  entrusted to them. They were somewhat surprised when I took them to task  and made them \"sit up.\" Having found that they had played the fool with  the wrong man they instantly became very meek and obliging. It is  nevertheless a great pity that the Mercury Company should employ men of  this kind who, for some aim of their own, annoy passengers, both foreign  and Russian, and are a disgrace to the Company and their country.    On board ship the captain, officers and stewards were extremely civil.  Nearly all the captains of the Caspian steamers were Norwegian or from  Finland, and were jolly fellows. The cabins were very much inhabited, so  much so that it was difficult to sleep in them at all. Insects so  voracious and in such quantities and variety were in full possession of  the berths, that they gave one as lively a night as it is possible for  mortals to have. Fortunately the journey was not a long one, and having  duly departed at midnight from Baku I reached Lenkoran the next day, with  its picturesque background of mountains and thickly-wooded country. This  spot is renowned for tiger-shooting.    Our next halt was at Astara, where there were a number of wooden sheds  and drinking saloons,--a dreadful place, important only because on the  Perso-Russian boundary line formed by the river of the same name. We  landed here a number of police officers, who were met by a deputation of  some fifty Persian-looking men, who threw their arms round their necks  and in turn lustily kissed them on both cheeks. It was a funny sight.  When we got on board again after a couple of hours on shore the wind rose  and we tossed about considerably. Another sleepless night on the \"living\"  mattress in the bunk, and early in the morning we reached the Persian  port of Enzeli.

Salare Afkham--A Swiss       hotel--Banks.      One calls Enzeli a \"port\" _pour facon de parler_, for Persia has no  harbours at all on the Caspian sea. Enzeli, Meshed-i-Sher or Astrabad,  the three principal landing places on the Persian coast, have no shelter  for ships, which have to lie a good distance out at sea while passengers  and cargo are transhipped by the Company's steam launch or--in rough  weather--by rowing boats. In very rough weather it is impossible to  effect a landing at all, and--this is a most frequent occurrence on the  treacherous Caspian--after reaching one's journey's end one has to go all  the way back to the starting point and begin afresh. There are people who  have been compelled to take the journey four or five times before they  could land, until the violent storms which often rage along the Persian  coast had completely subsided and allowed the flimsy steam-launch at  Enzeli to come out to meet the steamers, lying about a mile outside.    We had passengers on board who had been unable to land on the previous  journey, and were now on their second attempt to set foot in Persia. We  were rolling a good deal when we cast anchor, and after waiting some  hours we were informed that it was too rough for the steam-launch to come  out. The captain feared that he must put to sea again, as the wind was  rising and he was afraid to remain so near the coast. Two rowing boats  eventually came out, and with some considerable exertion of the rowers  succeeded in getting near the steamer. I immediately chartered one, and  after a good deal of see-saw and banging and knocking and crackling of  wood alongside the steamer, my baggage and I were transhipped into the  flat-bottomed boat. Off we rowed towards the shore, getting drenched each  time that the boat dipped her nose into the sea.    The narrow entrance of the Enzeli bay is blocked by a sand-bar. The water  is here very shallow, only about six feet deep. Riding on the top of the  breakers was quite an experience, and we occasionally shipped a good deal  of water. We, however, landed safely and had to pay pretty dearly for the  convenience. The boatmen do not run the risk of going out for nothing,  and when they do, take every advantage of passengers who employ them. I  was fortunate to get off by giving a backshish of a few _tomans_  (dollars), but there are people who have been known to pay three, four  and even five pounds sterling to be conveyed on shore.    Here, too, thanks to the civility of the Persian Ambassador in London, I  had a special permit for my firearms, instruments, etc., and met with the  greatest courtesy from the Belgian and Persian officers in the Customs.  It is necessary to have one's passport in order, duly _vise_ by the  Persian Consul in London, or else a delay might occur at Enzeli.    There is a lighthouse at Enzeli, the Customs buildings and a small hotel.  From this point a lagoon, the Murd-ap has to be crossed, either by the  small steam-launch or by rowing boat. As there seemed to be some  uncertainty about the departure of the launch, and as I had a good deal  of luggage, I preferred the latter way. Eight powerful men rowed with all  their might at the prospect of a good backshish; and we sped along at a  good pace on the placid waters of the lagoon, in big stretches of open  water, now skirting small islands, occasionally through narrow canals,  the banks of which were covered with high reeds and heavy, tropical,  confused, untidy vegetation. The air was still and stifling--absolutely  unmoved, screened as it was on all sides by vegetation. The sailors sang  a monotonous cadence, and the boat glided along for some three hours  until we arrived at the mouth of the Piri river, hardly wide enough for a  couple of boats to go through simultaneously, and so shallow that rowing  was no longer practicable.    The men jumped off, tied the towing rope that hung from the mast to their  belts, and ran along the banks of the Piri river, the water of which was  almost stagnant. An hour or so later we suddenly came upon a number of  boats jammed together in the miniature harbour of Piri Bazaar--a pool of  putrid water a few feet in circumference. As the boat gradually  approached, a stone-paved path still separated from you by a thick wide  layer of filthy mud wound its way to the few miserable sheds--the  bazaar--up above. A few trays of grapes, some Persian bread, some  earthenware pottery of the cheapest kind, are displayed in the shop  fronts--and that is all of the Piri-Bazaar. On landing at Enzeli one  hears so much of Piri-Bazaar that one gets to imagine it a big, important  place,--and as it is, moreover, practically the first really typical  Persian place at which one touches, the expectations are high. Upon  arrival there one's heart sinks into one's boots, and one's boots sink  deep into black stinking mud as one takes a very long--yet much too  short--jump from the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22125"],[0,"The Venetian Painters of the Renaissance (#5)"],[1,"not care  for pictures that moved him to contrition or devotion. He preferred to  have some pleasantly coloured thing that would put him into a mood  connected with the side of life he most enjoyed--with refined  merrymaking, with country parties, or with the sweet dreams of youth.  Venetian painting alone among Italian schools was ready to satisfy such  a demand, and it thus became the first genuinely modern art: for the  most vital difference that can be indicated between the arts in  antiquity and modern times is this--that now the arts tend to address  themselves more and more to the actual needs of men, while in olden  times they were supposed to serve some more than human purpose.    The pictures required for a house were naturally of a different kind  from those suited to the Council Hall or the School, where large  paintings, which could be filled with many figures, were in place. For  the house smaller pictures were necessary, such as could easily be  carried about. The mere dimensions, therefore, excluded pageants, but,  in any case, the pageant was too formal a subject to suit all moods--too  much like a brass band always playing in the room. The easel picture had  to be without too definite a subject, and could no more permit being  translated into words than a sonata. Some of Giovanni Bellini's late  works are already of this kind. They are full of that subtle, refined  poetry which can be expressed in form and colour alone. But they were a  little too austere in form, a little too sober in colour, for the gay,  care-free youth of the time. Carpaccio does not seem to have painted  many easel pictures, although his brilliancy, his delightful fancy, his  love of colour, and his gaiety of humour would have fitted him admirably  for this kind of painting. But Giorgione, the follower of both these  masters, starting with the qualities of both as his inheritance,  combined the refined feeling and poetry of Bellini with Carpaccio's  gaiety and love of beauty and colour. Stirred with the enthusiasms of  his own generation as people who had lived through other phases of  feeling could not be, Giorgione painted pictures so perfectly in touch  with the ripened spirit of the Renaissance that they met with the  success which those things only find that at the same moment wake us to  the full sense of a need and satisfy it.    Giorgione's life was short, and very few of his works--not a score in  all--have escaped destruction. But these suffice to give us a glimpse  into that brief moment when the Renaissance found its most genuine  expression in painting. Its over-boisterous passions had quieted down  into a sincere appreciation of beauty and of human relations. It would  be really hard to say more about Giorgione than this, that his pictures  are the perfect reflex of the Renaissance at its height. His works, as  well as those of his contemporaries and followers, still continue to be  appreciated most by people whose attitude of mind and spirit has most in  common with the Renaissance, or by those who look upon Italian art not  merely as art, but as the product of this period. For that is its  greatest interest. Other schools have accomplished much more in mere  painting than the Italian. A serious student of art will scarcely think  of putting many of even the highest achievements of the Italians,  considered purely as technique, beside the works of the great Dutchmen,  the great Spaniard, or even the masters of to-day. Our real interest in  Italian painting is at bottom an interest in that art which we almost  instinctively feel to have been the fittest expression found by a period  in the history of modern Europe which has much in common with youth.  The Renaissance has the fascination of those years when we seemed so  full of promise both to ourselves and to everybody else.      =VIII. The Giorgionesque Spirit.=--Giorgione created a demand which other  painters were forced to supply at the risk of finding no favour. The  older painters accommodated themselves as best they could. One of them  indeed, turning toward the new in a way that is full of singular charm,  gave his later works all the beauty and softness of the first spring  days in Italy. Upon hearing the title of one of Catena's works in the  National Gallery, \"A Warrior Adoring the Infant Christ,\" who could  imagine what a treat the picture itself had in store for him? It is a  fragrant summer landscape enjoyed by a few quiet people, one of whom, in  armour, with the glamour of the Orient about him, kneels at the Virgin's  feet, while a romantic young page holds his horse's bridle. I mention  this picture in particular because it is so accessible, and so good an  instance of the Giorgionesque way of treating a subject; not for the  story, nor for the display of skill, nor for the obvious feeling, but  for the lovely landscape, for the effects of light and colour, and for  the sweetness of human relations. Giorgione's altar-piece at  Castelfranco is treated in precisely the same spirit, but with far more  genius.    The young painters had no chance at all unless they undertook at once to  furnish pictures in Giorgione's style. But before we can appreciate all  that the younger men were called upon to do, we must turn to the  consideration of that most wonderful product of the Renaissance and of  the painter's craft--the Portrait.      =IX. The Portrait.=--The longing for the perpetuation of one's fame, which  has already been mentioned several times as one of the chief passions of  the Renaissance, brought with it the more universal desire to hand down  the memory of one's face and figure. The surest way to accomplish this  end seemed to be the one which had proved successful in the case of the  great Romans, whose effigies were growing more and more familiar as new  busts and medals were dug up. The earlier generations of the  Renaissance relied therefore on the sculptor and the medallist to hand  down their features to an interested posterity. These artists were ready  for their task. The mere materials gave them solidity, an effect so hard  to get in painting. At the same time, nothing was expected from them  except that they should mould the material into the desired shape. No  setting was required and no colour. Their art on this account alone  would naturally have been the earliest to reach fruition. But over and  above this, sculptors and medallists had the direct inspiration of  antique models, and through the study of these they were at an early  date brought in contact with the tendencies of the Renaissance. The  passion then prevailing for pronounced types, and the spirit of analysis  this produced, forced them to such patient study of the face as would  enable them to give the features that look of belonging to one  consistent whole which we call character. Thus, at a time when painters  had not yet learned to distinguish between one face and another,  Donatello was carving busts which remain unrivalled as studies of  character, and Pisanello was casting bronze and silver medals which are  among the greatest claims to renown of those whose effigies they bear.    Donatello's bust of Niccolo d'Uzzano shows clearly, nevertheless, that  the Renaissance could not long remain satisfied with the sculptured  portrait. It is coloured like nature, and succeeds so well in producing  for an instant the effect of actual life as to seem uncanny the next  moment. Donatello's contemporaries must have had the same impression,  for busts of this kind are but few. Yet these few prove that the element  of colour had to be included before the satisfactory portrait was found:  in other words, that painting and not sculpture was to be the  portrait-art of the Renaissance.    The most creative sculptor of the earlier Renaissance was not the only  artist who felt the need of colour in portraiture. Vittore Pisano, the  greatest medallist of this or any age, felt it quite as keenly, and  being a painter as well, he was among the first to turn this art to  portraiture. In his day, however, painting was still too undeveloped an  art for the portrait not to lose in character what it gained in a more  lifelike colouring, and the two of Pisanello's portraits which still  exist are profiles much inferior to his best medals, seeming indeed to  be enlargements of them rather than original studies from life.    It was only in the next generation, when the attention of painters  themselves was powerfully concentrated upon the reproduction of strongly  pronounced types of humanity, that they began to make portraits as full  of life and energy as Donatello's busts of the previous period. Even  then, however, the full face was rarely attempted, and it was only in  the beginning of the sixteenth century that full-face portraits began to  be common. The earliest striking achievement of this sort, Mantegna's  head of Cardinal Scarampo (now in Berlin), was not the kind to find  favour in Venice. The full-face likeness of this wolf in sheep's  clothing brought out the workings of the self-seeking, cynical spirit  within too clearly not to have revolted the Venetians, who looked upon  all such qualities as impious in the individual because they were the  strict monopoly of the State. In the portraits of Doges which decorated  the frieze of its great Council Hall, Venice wanted the effigies of  functionaries entirely devoted to the State, and not of great  personalities, and the profile lent itself more readily to the omission  of purely individual traits.    It is significant that Venice was the first state which made a business  of preserving the portraits of its chief rulers. Those which Gentile and  Giovanni Bellini executed for this end must have had no less influence  on portraiture than their mural paintings in the same Hall had on other  branches of the art. But the State was not satisfied with leaving  records of its glory in the Ducal Palace alone. The Church and"]]]
