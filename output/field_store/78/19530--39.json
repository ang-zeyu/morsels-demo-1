The cavern extends  for 50 feet in daylight; water from the interior spreads over the  whole floor to the inner margin of dry earth, where it collects in a  little stream which passes out along the foot of one wall. The earth  deposit seems to be thin. The only objects that could be found in the  cave or about the entrance were a small sandstone slab, unmarked; a  small piece of deer bone; and one fragment of shell-tempered pottery.  Not a flake of flint was seen.    These caves are not worth working.           *       *       *       *       *    A fourth of a mile from the cave last mentioned is a rock grave on a  ledge which projects at about 40 feet (vertically) below the top of  the hill. As near as can be judged, in its present torn-up condition,  the cairn was originally about 10 by 20 feet in dimensions; so there  were probably two graves covered by the ordinary conical heaps of  stone, the depression between them being filled up to form a single  cairn.      SALTPETER CAVE (3)    Five miles west of Montauk, on Ashley Creek, is a cave noted for  having two entrances which are separated by a triangular mass of rock,  part of the original formation. This partition measures 30 feet across  at the face of the bluff and terminates within 20 feet. The principal  opening is 90 feet wide and 15 feet high. Dry cave earth extends back  90 feet, at which distance water constantly falls from the roof and  flows along the foot of one wall through the minor entrance. The  latter is 30 feet wide, 10 feet high, and its bottom is 10 feet lower  than that of the main opening. The volume of water passing out varies  with the seasons, but is sufficient at times to cover the entire floor  of the side chamber and keep it swept free of earth and small gravel.    In the front portion of the main cavern the dry earth is 5 feet deep  in its thickest part; but as it has all been leached for obtaining the  saltpeter or niter diffused through it, none of it is in the original  position. Some earth has also been brought from farther back, leached,  and added to the pile in front; and much of this has been hauled out  for fertilizer.    Near the main entrance is a large mass of breccia made up of small  angular limestone fragments cemented throughout with stalagmite  material; it projects several feet above the present level of the  earth floor, so the character of the cavern must have changed greatly  since this deposit was formed.    The only artificial object found was a fragment, about an inch across,  of dark, sand-tempered pottery.    Owing to the extensive changes resulting from collecting the  saltpeter, the cavern would not repay investigation.                        *    *    *      DENT COUNTY    MAMMOTH CAVE    The statement has been made that a large dry cavern, known as the  \"Mammoth Cave,\" is in a bluff facing Current River, opposite the mouth  of Ashley Creek. It could not be located; and residents in the  vicinity assert that not only is there no cave near this site, but  there is none known as \"Mammoth\" anywhere in the region. Some of them,  however, had a vague idea that a cavern bearing the same name exists  \"away down toward Eminence; it may be on Jack's Fork.\"      GUTHOERL CAVE    There is a cave on the farm of Peter Guthoerl, 6 miles east of Salem.  It is small, with very little level space in front of it, and water  from the interior runs or seeps out of it, keeping the floor muddy  throughout the year.      SHORT BEND CAVE (4)    Short Bend post office is 12 miles northeast of Salem. Half a mile  east of it, in a bluff on the opposite side of the Meramec River, is a  cave with an entrance 25 feet wide and about the same in height; the  roof forming a fairly symmetrical Gothic arch. Were it not for the  pile of talus in front, water from the river would pour into the  cavern in extreme floods; these subside very rapidly, however, and  have never percolated through the barrier.    It is said that persons digging in a desultory way have unearthed  bones which were assumed to be those of Indians because they were  \"red.\" No description of them could be obtained, and they may not have  been human bones at all.    The floor is level and dry for about 80 feet back from the entrance,  but no refuse of any kind appeared, except in the pile of talus  outside, which showed a small quantity of flint chips such as would be  left by hunting parties in repairing their weapons.      MONEY CAVE    This is a fourth of a mile down the river from Short Bend Cave. It  takes its name from the customary tradition that Indians concealed a  large treasure here; the legend being authenticated by an \"Indian  chief\" who told a white man that his people had buried much gold in a  cave in this bluff, built a fire over the money, then filled the mouth  of the cave with earth and rock. Some of the persons who opened many  small holes in searching for the hidden wealth claim to have found  ashes in this cave, behind the barrier, which is only ordinary talus.  The floor is of tough clay, fallen rocks, and stalagmite, all of  which, as well as the walls and ledges, were industriously dug and  hammered for months by the treasure seekers.    A cave with an entrance 15 feet wide, the same in height, and having a  depth of 45 feet in daylight, lies between Money Cave and Short Bend  Cave. In very wet seasons water runs through it from the interior; and  high water backs into it from the Meramec River.      SALTPETER CAVE    This is three-fourths of a mile north of Short Bend post office, on  the opposite side of the river. The arched entrance is 25 feet wide  and 20 feet high. Fifteen feet from the front the cave divides into  two branches about equal in size; they have never been explored to the  end. One branch continues straight back for about 100 feet, then turns  abruptly to the right for 50 or 60 feet, at which distance it resumes  its original direction. The other branch turns directly to the right  and is in daylight for 50 feet. Much of the cave earth has been hauled  away for fertilizer, or leached for obtaining saltpeter, so that only  a small quantity remains in front. Farther back, in both chambers, the  dry earth where not disturbed is 8 to 10 feet thick.    The cavern is easily accessible, close to the river, and otherwise  well adapted for habitation; but careful search failed to reveal any  indication that it had ever been thus used.      WATSON, TWIN, OR ONYX CAVES    The two caverns thus variously designated are on the Meramec River, 14  miles north of Salem. They are parallel to a depth of about 100 feet,  being separated by only 10 or 12 feet of solid wall. The floors of  both slope downward from front to rear, but not so rapidly as the  roof, so that at this distance the caves apparently come to an end.  But that they continue back into the hill is manifest from the  appearance of the roofs. In some manner the rear portion of each has  become entirely filled with earth. Probably they unite somewhere  beyond this point.    Either of these caves is of ample size to make an excellent shelter  for a large number of people; but they are difficult of access, and no  evidence whatever could be discovered indicating occupancy.    In fact, this part of the Meramec Valley does not seem to have ever  been permanently inhabited. Residents say that relics, even flint  implements, are seldom found in the bottom lands; and this fact was  commented on by persons who have learned how common such things are in  other localities. Small, rough hematite axes, however, occur in  considerable quantities throughout the region. The ore outcrops at  various places and solid nodules or fragments are plentiful. Chert  knives or spearheads are found scattered promiscuously; and, rarely,  an object made of other stone may be picked up. Very few specimens of  any description are symmetrical or carefully finished.      HOUSE MOUNDS (5)    On the Dent County infirmary farm, in Spring Creek Valley, a mile and  a half south of Salem, is a group of house mounds, about 50 in number.  They have not been much disturbed by cultivation; the creek and a  drainage ditch have cut through several of them, but, as usual, there  is nothing in the construction to show their purpose.    Two similar groups are on the Short Bend road, not far from Salem;  another group on Peter Guthoerl's farm 6 miles east of Salem; and a  fourth group, partly within the corporate limits of Salem, on the road  to Rolla.                        *    *    *      PHELPS COUNTY    BATES CAVE    On the farm of J.W. Riden, 6 miles southeast of Big Piney post office,  is Bates Cave, of which every visitor to the region is speedily  informed. It is entered with difficulty by sliding feet first down the  inner slope of a pile of debris which fills the entrance almost to  the roof. Once beyond this, there is ample space. On the hillside,  above the mouth, is a vertical shaft, like a well, due to the widening  of a crevice; access to the interior of the cave may also be had  through this by means of a long rope. Under present conditions, it  would not be used except as a temporary shelter or hiding place; for  which purposes bushwhackers availed themselves of its advantages  during the Civil War.    This cavern is renowned far beyond its merits on account of its famous  \"ballroom,\" where dances and picnics are held; artificial lights being  placed on the walls. Possibly the manner in which it must be entered  has something to do with its popularity.      ANOTHER \"BATES CAVE\"    Within a few rods of the cave above described is another, with an  entrance 60 feet wide and 10 feet high. Cave earth, which is 5 feet  thick above the bottom of a small stream coming from the interior,  extends back to large rocks covering the floor; beyond these are  rocks, wet clay, and gravel. The cave earth seems to run for some  distance"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18932"],[0,"Mental Defectives and Sexual Offenders (#5)"],[1,"for the present inquiry.    An authoritative summary taken from this year's report of the Director  of the Division of School Hygiene is quoted in the Appendix as pointing  out most of the faults and mistakes in environment and upbringing to  which reference has been made, and because it draws special and  much-needed attention to the injurious effects of overwork and excessive  competition and the need for more sleep and rest.    We would merely add to this very clear, practical statement that  encouragement of excessive competition, inside or outside the school,  for any purpose whatsoever, is costly and damaging to the whole being,  and that, in the opinion of the Committee, nothing needs to be impressed  more strongly on parents and school-teachers than Froebel's injunction,  \"Give space and time and rest.\"      SECTION 3.--ILLUSTRATIVE CASES OF HEREDITARY DEGENERACY.    _The Juke Family._    To show the close relationship existing between the criminal and the  psychopath the record of the so-called Juke family in America was  compiled by R. L. Dugdale.    The descendants of one morbid couple were traced through five  generations. Whilst a small proportion were honest workers, the great  majority were paupers, criminals, and prostitutes.    Of 540 Jukes practically one-fifth were born out of wedlock, 37 were  known to be syphilitic, 53 had been in poorhouses, 76 had been sentenced  to prison, and of 229 women of marriageable age 128 were prostitutes.  The economic damage inflicted upon the State of New York by the Jukes in  seventy-five years was estimated at more than $1,300,000, to say nothing  of diseases and other evil influences which they helped to spread.    A more recent investigation shows that 2,820 people have been studied;  2,094 were of Juke blood and 726 of \"X\" blood married into the Juke  family; of these, 366 were paupers, while 171 were criminals, and 10  lives have been sacrificed by murder. In school-work 62 did well, 288  did fairly, while 458 were retarded two or more years. It is known that  166 never attended school; the school data for the rest of the family  were unobtainable. There were 282 intemperate and 277 harlots. The total  cost to the State has been estimated at $2,093,685.      _The Kallikak Family._    The history of the Kallikak family has been traced and fully described  in detail by Dr. Goddard, and his study shows the hereditary nature and  sociological bearings of feeble-mindedness.    Martin Kallikak was a youthful soldier in the Revolutionary War. At a  tavern frequented by the militia he met a feeble-minded girl by whom he  became the father of a feeble-minded son. In 1912 there were 480 known  direct descendants of this temporary union. It is known that 36 of these  were illegitimates; that 33 were sexually immoral; that 24 were  confirmed alcoholics; and that 8 kept houses of ill-fame. The  explanation of so much immorality will be obvious when it is stated that  of the 480 descendants 143 were known to be feeble-minded, and that many  of the others were of questionable mentality.    A few years after returning from the war this same Martin Kallikak  married a respectable girl of good family. From this union 496  individuals have been traced in direct descent, and in this branch of  the family there were no illegitimate children, no immoral women, and  only one man who was sexually loose. There were no criminals, no keepers  of houses of ill-fame, and only two confirmed alcoholics. Again the  explanation is clear when it is stated that this branch of the family  did not contain a single feeble-minded individual. It was made up of  doctors, lawyers, judges, educators, traders, and landholders.      _New Zealand Cases._    But it is not necessary to go to the records of older countries to find  examples of this kind. Unfortunately, this young Dominion, whose history  as a European settlement is comprised within the lifetime of its oldest  inhabitants, is already reproducing some of the saddest problems of  civilization which perplex the people of the Old World. We started with  every advantage in the shape of a favourable climate and rich natural  resources. The original settlers were, for the most part, men and women  of sturdy determination, enterprising spirit, and strong physique.    In the \"seventies\" a vigorous public-works policy was inaugurated, and  great efforts were made to introduce fresh population, the result being  that undoubtedly a great impetus was given to settlement, and the  country was fairly started on the road to prosperity. But,  unfortunately, it is now only too apparent that insufficient care was  taken in the selection of immigrants.    The following extract from a statement made to the Committee by Sir  Robert Stout, Chief Justice, and President of the Prisons Board,  illustrates this point: \"The Prisons Board has sometimes brought before  it several persons of one family who have offended against our laws, and  in the experience I had in 1884 and 1885, when looking after our  Hospitals and Charitable Aid Department in the General Government, I  found that people obtaining charitable aid had done so for three  generations; that is, grandfather, father or mother, and children were  all obtaining aid from the Government because they were unable to  maintain themselves. Some of the cases were traced, and it was found  that the grandfathers, or grandparents, had been originally in  poorhouses in the Homeland, and although they came to New Zealand and  had greater opportunities than they had in their Homeland, yet their  inability to provide for themselves continued.\"    How serious the problem has already become will be seen from the  following illustrative cases selected from a large number given in the  evidence:--                _Case No. 1._    +--------------------------------+    | Father:        | Mother:       |    |  Weak-minded.  |  Weak-minded. |    |                |               |    +----------+----------+----------+               |Female,   |               |born 1906.|               +----------+               |Female,   |               |born 1907.|               +----------+               |Female,   |               |born 1908.|               +----------+               |Female,   |               |born 1909.|               +----------+               |Female,   |               |born 1911.|               +----------+               |Male,     |               |born 1912.|               +----------+               |Male,     |               |born 1913.|               +----------+               |Male,     |               |born 1915.|               +----------+               |Female,   |               |born 1916.|               +----------+    All these children except one are feeble-minded, and when committed to  the care of the State were found living under deplorable conditions.  Most of these children will require lifelong control in an institution.  The total cost of maintaining this family will be approximately L9,500.  These children are cousins of another family under State control. There  are four children, two of whom are simple-minded. The mother is  feeble-minded, and the father died in a mental hospital. In this case  the mothers of the children are sisters.                 _Case No. 2._    +----------------------------------+    | Father:         | Mother:        |    |  Feeble-minded. |  Feeble-minded |    |                 |  and drunkard. |    |                 |                |    +---------+-------------+----------+              |Female,      |              |illegitimate,|              |born 1902.   |              +-------------+              |Male,        |              |born 1904.   |              +-------------+              |Male,        |              |born 1906.   |              +-------------+              |Male,        |              |born 1907.   |              +-------------+              |Male,        |              |born 1910.   |              +-------------+              |Male,        |              |born 1912.   |              +-------------+              |Female,      |              |born 1914.   |              +-------------+              |Female,      |              |born 1916.   |              +-------------+              |Male,        |              |born 1918.   |              +-------------+              |Male,        |              |born 1920.   |              +-------------+              |Male,        |              |born 1923.   |              +-------------+    All these children are feeble-minded and have been brought under State  control shortly after birth. Some are now in mental hospitals and some  in special schools. All these children are lifelong custodial cases. The  cost to the State for maintenance is approximately L16,000, towards  which amount the father has contributed but L6.                                _Case No. 3._           +----------------------------------------------------+           | Father:                | Mother:                   |           |  Old-age pensioner in  |  Apparently weak mentally |           |  Home for Aged People. |  and morally--at present  |           |                        |  in reformatory home.     |           |                        |                           |    +------------------+-------------------------+---------------------+    |1.
