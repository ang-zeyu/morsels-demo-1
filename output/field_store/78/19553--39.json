For any  believer of that race to maintain that the excellence of his country and  the innate nobility of its people were the fundamental reasons for its  being singled out as the primary receptacle of the Revelations of the Bab  and Baha'u'llah would be untenable in the face of the overwhelming  evidence afforded so convincingly by that Narrative.    To a lesser degree this principle must of necessity apply to the country  which has vindicated its right to be regarded as the cradle of the World  Order of Baha'u'llah. So great a function, so noble a role, can be  regarded as no less inferior to the part played by those immortal souls  who, through their sublime renunciation and unparalleled deeds, have been  responsible for the birth of the Faith itself. Let not, therefore, those  who are to participate so predominantly in the birth of that world  civilization, which is the direct offspring of their Faith, imagine for a  moment that for some mysterious purpose or by any reason of inherent  excellence or special merit Baha'u'llah has chosen to confer upon their  country and people so great and lasting a distinction. It is precisely by  reason of the patent evils which, notwithstanding its other admittedly  great characteristics and achievements, an excessive and binding  materialism has unfortunately engendered within it that the Author of  their Faith and the Center of His Covenant have singled it out to become  the standard-bearer of the New World Order envisaged in their writings. It  is by such means as this that Baha'u'llah can best demonstrate to a  heedless generation His almighty power to raise up from the very midst of  a people, immersed in a sea of materialism, a prey to one of the most  virulent and long-standing forms of racial prejudice, and notorious for  its political corruption, lawlessness and laxity in moral standards, men  and women who, as time goes by, will increasingly exemplify those  essential virtues of self-renunciation, of moral rectitude, of chastity,  of indiscriminating fellowship, of holy discipline, and of spiritual  insight that will fit them for the preponderating share they will have in  calling into being that World Order and that World Civilization of which  their country, no less than the entire human race, stands in desperate  need. Theirs will be the duty and privilege, in their capacity first as  the establishers of one of the most powerful pillars sustaining the  edifice of the Universal House of Justice, and then as the  champion-builders of that New World Order of which that House is to be the  nucleus and forerunner, to inculcate, demonstrate, and apply those twin  and sorely needed principles of Divine justice and order--principles to  which the political corruption and the moral license, increasingly  staining the society to which they belong, offer so sad and striking a  contrast.    Observations such as these, however distasteful and depressing they may  be, should not, in the least, blind us to those virtues and qualities of  high intelligence, of youthfulness, of unbounded initiative, and  enterprise which the nation as a whole so conspicuously displays, and  which are being increasingly reflected by the community of the believers  within it. Upon these virtues and qualities, no less than upon the  elimination of the evils referred to, must depend, to a very great extent,  the ability of that community to lay a firm foundation for the country's  future role in ushering in the Golden Age of the Cause of Baha'u'llah.    How great, therefore, how staggering the responsibility that must weigh  upon the present generation of the American believers, at this early stage  in their spiritual and administrative evolution, to weed out, by every  means in their power, those faults, habits, and tendencies which they have  inherited from their own nation, and to cultivate, patiently and  prayerfully, those distinctive qualities and characteristics that are so  indispensable to their effective participation in the great redemptive  work of their Faith. Incapable as yet, in view of the restricted size of  their community and the limited influence it now wields, of producing any  marked effect on the great mass of their countrymen, let them focus their  attention, for the present, on their own selves, their own individual  needs, their own personal deficiencies and weaknesses, ever mindful that  every intensification of effort on their part will better equip them for  the time when they will be called upon to eradicate in their turn such  evil tendencies from the lives and the hearts of the entire body of their  fellow-citizens. Nor must they overlook the fact that the World Order,  whose basis they, as the advance-guard of the future Baha'i generations of  their countrymen, are now laboring to establish, can never be reared  unless and until the generality of the people to which they belong has  been already purged from the divers ills, whether social or political,  that now so severely afflict it.    Surveying as a whole the most pressing needs of this community, attempting  to estimate the more serious deficiencies by which it is being handicapped  in the discharge of its task, and ever bearing in mind the nature of that  still greater task with which it will be forced to wrestle in the future,  I feel it my duty to lay special stress upon, and draw the special and  urgent attention of the entire body of the American believers, be they  young or old, white or colored, teachers or administrators, veterans or  newcomers, to what I firmly believe are the essential requirements for the  success of the tasks which are now claiming their undivided attention.  Great as is the importance of fashioning the outward instruments, and of  perfecting the administrative agencies, which they can utilize for the  prosecution of their dual task under the Seven Year Plan; vital and urgent  as are the campaigns which they are initiating, the schemes and projects  which they are devising, and the funds which they are raising, for the  efficient conduct of both the Teaching and Temple work, the imponderable,  the spiritual, factors, which are bound up with their own individual and  inner lives, and with which are associated their human and social  relationships, are no less urgent and vital, and demand constant scrutiny,  continual self-examination and heart-searching on their part, lest their  value be impaired or their vital necessity be obscured or forgotten.    Of these spiritual prerequisites of success, which constitute the bedrock  on which the security of all teaching plans, Temple projects, and  financial schemes, must ultimately rest, the following stand out as  preeminent and vital, which the members of the American Baha'i community  will do well to ponder. Upon the extent to which these basic requirements  are met, and the manner in which the American believers fulfill them in  their individual lives, administrative activities, and social  relationships, must depend the measure of the manifold blessings which the  All-Bountiful Possessor can vouchsafe to them all. These requirements are  none other than a high sense of moral rectitude in their social and  administrative activities, absolute chastity in their individual lives,  and complete freedom from prejudice in their dealings with peoples of a  different race, class, creed, or color.    The first is specially, though not exclusively, directed to their elected  representatives, whether local, regional, or national, who, in their  capacity as the custodians and members of the nascent institutions of the  Faith of Baha'u'llah, are shouldering the chief responsibility in laying  an unassailable foundation for that Universal House of Justice which, as  its title implies, is to be the exponent and guardian of that Divine  Justice which can alone insure the security of, and establish the reign of  law and order in, a strangely disordered world. The second is mainly and  directly concerned with the Baha'i youth, who can contribute so decisively  to the virility, the purity, and the driving force of the life of the  Baha'i community, and upon whom must depend the future orientation of its  destiny, and the complete unfoldment of the potentialities with which God  has endowed it. The third should be the immediate, the universal, and the  chief concern of all and sundry members of the Baha'i community, of  whatever age, rank, experience, class, or color, as all, with no  exception, must face its challenging implications, and none can claim,  however much he may have progressed along this line, to have completely  discharged the stern responsibilities which it inculcates.    A rectitude of conduct, an abiding sense of undeviating justice,  unobscured by the demoralizing influences which a corruption-ridden  political life so strikingly manifests; a chaste, pure, and holy life,  unsullied and unclouded by the indecencies, the vices, the false  standards, which an inherently deficient moral code tolerates,  perpetuates, and fosters; a fraternity freed from that cancerous growth of  racial prejudice, which is eating into the vitals of an already  debilitated society--these are the ideals which the American believers  must, from now on, individually and through concerted action, strive to  promote, in both their private and public lives, ideals which are the  chief propelling forces that can most effectively accelerate the march of  their institutions, plans, and enterprises, that can guard the honor and  integrity of their Faith, and subdue any obstacles that may confront it in  the future.    This rectitude of conduct, with its implications of justice, equity,  truthfulness, honesty, fair-mindedness, reliability, and trustworthiness,  must distinguish every"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19250"],[0,"`Abdu'l-Bahá in London (#5)"],[1," the  Christ. I pray earnestly that the Light in this advanced age will so  illumine the world that all may rally under the banner of Unity and  receive Spiritual education.    Then those problems which cause difference among the peoples of the earth  will be seen no more, for verily they are not. You are all waves of one  sea, mirrors of one reflection.    This day the countries of Europe are at rest; Education has become  widespread. The light of liberty is the light of the West, and the  intention of government is to work for truth and justice in Western  countries. But ever the light of spirituality shines from out of the East.  In this age that light has become dimmed; religion has become a matter of  form and ceremony and the desire for God's love has been lost.    In very age of great spiritual darkness, a light is kindled in the East.  So once again the light of the teachings of God has come unto you. Even as  education and progress travel from West to East, so does the spiritual  fire travel from East to West.    I hope that the people of the West may be illumined by the light of God;  that the Kingdom may come to them, that they may find eternal Life, that  the Spirit of God may spread like a fire among them, that they may be  baptized with the Water of Life and may find a new birth.    This is my desire; I hope by the will of God, He will cause you to receive  it, and will make you happy.    In the same way that you have education and material progress so may the  light of God be your portion.    God keep all of you in safety.            NOTES OF CONVERSATIONS                                The Arrival in London      The evening of his arrival in London, Monday, September 4th, 1911,  'Abdu'l-Baha said: Heaven has blessed this day. It was said that London  should be a place for a great proclamation of the Faith. I was tired when  I went on board the steamer, but when I reached London and beheld the  faces of the friends my fatigue left me. Your great love refreshes me. I  am very pleased with the English friends.    The feeling that existed between the East and the West is changing in the  Light of Baha'u'llah's teaching. It used to be such that if an Occidental  drank from the cup of an Oriental the cup would be considered polluted and  would be broken. Now when a Western Baha'i dines with an Eastern Baha'i  the vessels and the plates that he has used are kept apart and reverenced  in his memory. 'Abdu'l-Baha then gave this historic instance of wonderful  brotherly love:    One day some soldiers came to the house of a Baha'i and demanded that one  of the guests should be given up for execution, according to their  warrant. The host took his guest's place and died in his stead.          London      The magnet of your love brought me to this country. My hope is that the  Divine Light may shine here, and that the Heavenly Star of Baha'u'llah may  strengthen you, so that you may be the cause of the oneness of humanity,  that you may help to make the darkness of superstition and prejudice  disappear and unite all creeds and nations.    This is a brilliant century. Eyes are now open to the beauty of the  oneness of humanity, of love and of brotherhood. The darkness of  suppression will disappear and the light of unity will shine. We cannot  bring love and unity to pass merely by talking of it. Knowledge is not  enough. Wealth, science, education are good, we know: but we must also  work and study to bring to maturity the fruit of knowledge.    Knowledge is the first step; resolve, the second step; action, its  fulfillment, is the third step. To construct a building one must first of  all make a plan, then one must have the power (money), then one can build.  A society of Unity is formed, that is good--but meetings and discussions  are not enough. In Egypt these meetings take place but there is only talk  and no result. These meetings here in London are good, the knowledge and  the intention are good, but how can there be a result without action?  Today the force for Unity is the Holy Spirit of Baha'u'llah. He manifested  this spirit of Unity. Baha'u'llah brings East and West together. Go back,  search history, you will not find a precedent for this.          Differences      God has created the world as one--the boundaries are marked out by man. God  has not divided the lands, but each man has his house and meadow; horses  and dogs do not divide the fields into parts. That is why Baha'u'llah  says: \"Let not a man glory in that he loves his country, but that he loves  his kind.\" All are of one family, one race; all are human beings.  Differences as to the partition of lands should not be the cause of  separation among the people.    One of the great reasons of separation is colour. Look how this prejudice  has power in America, for instance. See how they hate one another! Animals  do not quarrel because of their colour! Surely man who is so much higher  in creation, should not be lower than the animals. Think over this. What  ignorance exists! White doves do not quarrel with blue doves because of  their colour, but white men fight with dark-coloured men. This racial  prejudice is the worst of all.    The Old Testament says that God created man like unto His own image; in  the Qur'an it says: \"There is no difference in the Creation of God!\" Think  well, God has created all, cares for all, and all are under His  protection. The policy of God is better than our policy. We are not as  wise as God!          Religion      To most men who have not heard the message of this teaching, religion  seems an outward form, a pretence, merely a seal of respectability. Some  priests are in holy office for no other reason than to gain their living.  They themselves do not believe in the religion they pretend to teach.  Would these men lay down their lives for their faith? Ask a Christian of  this kind to deny Christ in order to save his life, and he will do it.    Ask a Baha'i to deny any of the great Prophets, to deny his faith or to  deny Moses, Muhammad or Christ, and he will say: I would rather die. So a  Muhammadan Baha'i is a better Christian than many so called Christians.    A Baha'i denies no religion; he accepts the Truth in all, and would die to  uphold it. He loves all men as his brothers, of whatever class, of  whatever race or nationality, of whatever creed or colour, whether good or  bad, rich or poor, beautiful or hideous. He commits no violence; if he is  struck he does not return the blow. He calls nothing bad, following the  example of the Lord Baha'u'llah. As a safeguard against intemperance he  does not drink wine or spirits. Baha'u'llah has said it is not good for a  sane man to take that which will destroy his health and sense.    The religion of God has two aspects in this world. The spiritual (the  real) and the formal (the outward). The formal side changes, as man  changes from age to age. The spiritual side which is the Truth, never  changes. The Prophets and Manifestations of God bring always the same  teaching; at first men cling to the Truth but after a time they disfigure  it. The Truth is distorted by man-made outward forms and material laws.  The veil of substance and worldliness is drawn across the reality of  Truth.    As Moses and Jesus brought their Message to the people, so Baha'u'llah  brings the same Message.    Each time God sends a Great One to us we are given new life, but the Truth  each Manifestation brings is the same. The Truth never changes but man's  vision changes. It is dulled and confused by the complication of outward  forms.    The Truth is easy to understand although the outward forms in which it is  expressed bewilder the intelligence. As men grow they see the futility of  man-made forms and despise them. Therefore many leave the churches,  because the latter often emphasize the external only.            DISCOURSE TO AN ASSEMBLY OF THEOSOPHISTS. LONDON                                   September, 1911.      These are wonderful days! We see an Eastern guest received with love and  courtesy in the West. I have been drawn here, in spite of indisposition,  by the magnet of your love and sympathy.    Some years ago an Ambassador was sent from Persia to London where he  stayed five years. (His name was 'Abdu'l Hasan _Kh_an). When he returned  to Persia they asked him to tell them about the English people. He  answered: \"I do not know the English people, although I have been in  London for years I have only met the people of the Court.\" This man was a  great man in Persia, and was sent to England by princes, and yet he did  not know the people, although he had lived among them five years. Now,  I--long a prisoner, come to England for the first time, and although my  visit is so short, I have already met many dear friends, and I can say I  know the people. Those I have met are true souls working for peace and  unity.--Think what a difference there is between this time we are living in  now, and seventy years ago! Think of the progress! the progress towards  unity and peace.    It is God's will that the differences between nations should disappear.  Those who help on the cause of unity are doing God's work. Unity is the  Divine Bounty for this luminous century. Praise be to God, there are today  many societies and many meetings held for Unity. Enmity is not so much the  cause of separation as it used to be; the cause of disunion now is mostly  prejudice. For instance, years ago when Europeans visited the East they  were considered unclean and were hated. Now it is different: when people  of the West visit those in the East who are followers of the New Light,  they are received with love and courtesy.    'Abdu'l-Baha holding a little child close to him said, the true Baha'i  loves the children, because Jesus says they are of the Kingdom of heaven.  A simple pure heart is near to God; a child has no worldly ambitions.          Prejudices      The Universal Races Congress was"]]]
