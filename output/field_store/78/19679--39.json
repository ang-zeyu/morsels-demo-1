He lived in his cage during the day, and next to him, on the same table,  lived a bullfinch--a very handsome bird, but heavy and lethargic to a  degree; he sang exquisitely, and for that gift I suppose Verdant admired  him, for his delight was to be as near him as possible. Perched on the  top of his cage, he gazed down at his friend, and in great measure  imitated his singing. Bully, on the contrary, hated Verdant, and would  have nothing to do with him. The two characters were a great source of  amusement to us.    Verdant was always let out at meal-times to fly about and enjoy his  liberty, and I am sorry to say he was always on the look-out for any  mischief that might be possible. Bully's water-jar was fastened outside  by a small pin; this Verdant discovered was movable, and before long we  were startled by the fall of the said water-jar, the greenfinch having  pulled out the pin; he then began upon the seed-box, and that also fell,  to his great delight; he was then talked to and scolded, and up went his  pretty yellow wings with angry flappings, and his open beak scolded back  again in the most hardened manner. He was greatly interested in watching  the numerous birds frequenting a basket filled with fat which hung  outside the window, and he would swing backwards and forwards on the  tassel of the blind, chirping to the outsiders, and watching all their  little squabbles. Sunflower seeds were his greatest dainty; he would  perch upon the hand to receive one, or if it were held between the lips  he would flutter and poise upon the wing to take it. A sort of swing  with a chain and movable wheel was provided, upon which Verdant soon  learned to perch and swing, whilst he amused himself by pecking at the  chain till he disengaged the sunflower seeds I had fixed in the links.  When he was more than a year old, and I thought he might be depended  upon, I tried the rather anxious experiment of letting him out of doors.  He soon became quietly happy, investigating the wonders of tree  branches, inquiring into the taste of leaves and all kind of novelties,  when two or three sparrows flew at him and scared him considerably. Away  he went, followed by the sparrows, and I began to repent my experiment,  and feared he might go beyond my ken and lose himself. He was out nearly  an hour, but at last he returned and went quietly into his cage. It  seemed strange that the wild birds should so soon discover that he was  not one of their clique, but I suppose Verdant revealed the secret by  looking frightened, and the others could not resist the fun of chasing  him. For more than a year and a half my birdie was a constant pleasure.  Whenever he entered the dining-room my first act was to open Verdant's  cage, when he would always fly to the bullfinch's cage and greet him  with a chirp, then look to see if his friend had any provender that he  could get at--a piece of lettuce between the bars, or a spray of millet  to which he could help himself; no matter that Bully remonstrated with  open beak, Verdant calmly feasted on stolen goods _con gusto_, and then  scouted around for any dainties on the carpet, where he sometimes found  a stray sunflower seed, always his greatest delight. After his summer  moulting he became wonderfully vigorous, and would fly round the room  with such velocity that I often felt afraid he might some day fly  against the plate-glass windows and injure himself.    That mournful day came at last! He had been out as usual at  breakfast-time, came on my finger for a seed, had his bath, and went on  the little swing for more seeds, and flew about with all his joyous life  and vigour. We had only left the room for a few moments, when, on  returning, the dear little bird lay dead beneath the window, against  which he had flown with such force as to break his neck and cause  instant death.    The sorrow of that moment will never be forgotten; indeed, I cannot even  now think of my little pet with undimmed eyes--he was a moment before so  full of life and beauty, so fearless, such a \"sonsie\" little fellow;  and then to hold the little golden green body in my hand and watch the  fast-glazing eye, and think that I should never again have my cheery  little friend to greet me and be glad at my coming, was one of those  sharp pangs that true lovers of nature alone can understand. From all  such I know I shall have sympathy in the tragic death of my much-loved  little Verdant.    [Illustration]          [Illustration: WILD DUCK.]    THE WILD DUCKS.      WHEN our grass was being cut the mowers came upon a wild duck's nest  containing eight eggs; they were carried whilst still warm and placed  under a sitting hen; in a week's time she brought out eight fluffy  little ducklings, which were placed with her under a coop in the  farmyard. I paid them a visit the next day, but, alas! I saw four little  corpses lying about in the grass, the remaining four were chirping  piteously, and the hen was in despair at being unable to comfort her  uncanny children. Evidently their diet was in fault; I thought I would  take them in hand, and therefore had the coop brought round to the  garden, and placed under the drooping boughs of a deodar near the  drawing-room window, where I could watch over them.    I gave the wee birdies a pan of water, and placed in it some  finely-shred lettuce, with grits and brown bread crumbs, not forgetting  suitable food for the poor distracted hen. It was charming to hear the  little happy twitterings of the downy babes, how they gobbled and  sputtered and talked to each other over their repast, swimming to and  fro as if they had been ducks of mature age and experience, instead of  mere yellow fluffs of a day old; and, finally, they seemed to remember  they had a warm, comfortable mother somewhere, and sought refuge under  her kindly wings, where I left them exchanging confidences in little  drowsy chirps.    I found it needful to guard my little brood with fine wire-work, for  some carrion crows kept hovering near, and a weasel was constantly on  the watch to carry them off; but these enemies were successfully  baffled, and three of the ducks survived all dangers and grew to  beautiful maturity, the fourth having died in infancy from an accidental  peck from the hen. In rearing all wild creatures the great thing is to  study and imitate, as nearly as possible, their natural surroundings,  and especially their diet. Chopped lettuce and worms made a fair  substitute for their natural food, but the jubilation that went on when  a mass of water-weed, full of insects, water snails, &c., was brought  them, showed that they knew by instinct what suited them best. With  constant care and attention they grew very tame, and would eat out of  one's hand, and when let out of the coop would follow me to a certain  heap of dead leaves where worms abounded, and there, with the most  amusing eagerness, they pounced upon their wriggling prey, snatching the  worms out of each other's beak, and tumbling over one another in their  excitement, all the while making a special chirp of exceeding happiness.    They were named Tiny, Sir Francis Drake, and Luther--I fear the last  name had a covert allusion to the \"Diet of Worms.\"    When the purple feathers began to show in their wings, and they  considered themselves quite too old to pay any allegiance to their  hen-mother, they began to absent themselves for some hours each  afternoon, and this, too, in a most secret fashion, for I could never  tell how they disappeared, but they returned in due time, walking  quietly in Indian file, and lay down in their coop. At last I traced  them to a pond a long distance off--it really seemed as if they had  scented the water, for they had to traverse a lawn and wood, go across a  drive, and through a hedge and field, and then the pond was in a hollow  where they could not possibly have seen it; but there I found my little  friends in high glee, darting over the surface of the water, splashing,  diving, sending up showers of spray from their wings, and going on as if  they were possessed. I called to them, and in a moment they quieted  down, and behaved exactly as children would have done when caught  tripping--they came out of the water and followed me, in the meekest and  most penitent manner, back to their home under the deodar.    These birds would stay the whole morning with me in perfect content if  they were allowed to nestle into a wool mat placed at the doorstep of  the French window leading out upon the lawn; there they would plume  themselves and sometimes preen each other, and I could watch the way in  which the feathers were drawn through the apparently awkward bill, yet I  suppose so suited for its various uses; anyway the feathers came out  from its manipulations as smooth and sleek as velvet, and when the  toilet was over the head found its rest behind the wing, and profound  sleep followed. Sometimes my friends would make a spring upon the sofa  by my side, I fear with a view to forthcoming worms, of which they well  knew I was the purveyor; and nothing could exceed the slyness of their  eyes as they looked up at me and mutely suggested an expedition to that  heap of leaves!    I must say I derived an immense amount of amusement from those ducks;  they had such innate character of their own, quite unlike any other bird  I ever came across.    I had often looked forward to the time when they would take to their  wings and come down upon the lawn from aerial heights with a grand fuss  and fluttering of wings, but that desire they never gratified. The day  came at last when I saw them circling high up in the air, so high that  they were mere specks in the sky, but where they alighted I never could  find out. They always re-appeared, walking solemnly (the little  hypocrites!) one after the other, as if they had been doing nothing in  particular, and were now coming in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21137"],[0,"Parkhurst Boys, and Other Stories of School Life (#5)"],[1," took over the course, we  could see they were a first-rate crew and formidable opponents.  Still  our \"coach,\" who had watched them minutely, told us we had the better  stroke of the two, and if we could only hold out, ought to win after  all.  This was comforting information, for the showy style of our  opponents had struck terror into not a few of those whose sympathies  were on the side of the present boys.    The school turned out in force to witness the event.  The towing-path  was lined with spectators, many of them from a distance, attracted by  the prospect of an exciting race.  A goodly muster of old fellows  revisited the haunts of their school days, and congregated about the  winning-post, while others, of a more athletic turn, prepared to run  along with the race from beginning to end.    Meanwhile, in the boat-house, we had stripped for action and launched  our boat.  As we were ready to put off, and make for the starting-point,  Mr Blunt came up and said to Blades, our \"stroke\",--    \"Now remember, row a steady stroke all through.  Don't be flurried if  they get the best of the start.  If you can stick to them the first half  of the way, you ought to be able to row them down in the last; and mind,  Adams,\" he said, addressing me, \"don't let them force you out of your  straight course, and don't waste time in trying to bother them.  Keep as  straight as an arrow, and you can't go wrong.\"    As our fellows put off for the starting-place, their long clean stroke  elicited no little admiration from the onlookers, who saw much in it  that augured well for the success of our boat.  Thanks to Mr Blunt, our  crew had learned to master that steady, strong sweep of the oars which  is universally admitted to be the perfection of rowing style and the  most serviceable of all strokes.  Rowed well through from first to last,  gripping the water the instant the oar is back and the body and arms  forward, and dragged clean through without jerk or plunge, the swing of  the bodies regular as clockwork, the feather clear and rapid--this  essentially is the kind of rowing which not only puts most pace into the  boat, but is capable of being sustained far longer than any other.    Not long after us our opponents embarked, and we had an opportunity of  criticising their style as they paddled up to where we lay waiting for  them.  It certainly looked pretty and taking.  The stroke was quicker  than ours, and equally regular, but it seemed to end in a spasmodic jerk  as the oars left the water, which, though it succeeded in making the  boat travel quickly, appeared to try the powers of the rowers rather  more than our style did.  Still, there was no mistaking that they were a  fast and a powerful crew, and I remember to this day the passing  thought, \"I wish we were at the end of it!\" that flashed through my mind  as I gathered my rudder lines together, ready for the start.    Mr Blunt is to act as starter, and is coming towards us in a boat, with  his watch in his hand.  Our rivals' boat is lying close beside ours, and  I can see their stroke is leaning forward and saying something to the  coxswain.  I wonder it it's about me?  Perhaps he is telling him to push  me out of my course, or perhaps they are saying how nervous I am  looking!  Well, I _am_ nervous.  I begin to think I shall forget which  way I have to go.  Perhaps I shall pull the right-hand line instead of  the left; or possibly I shall omit to pull either line at all!  What  lasting disgrace will then be mine!  Then suddenly I remember what Mr  Blunt said, that it's all up with a race if the \"cox\" loses his head,  and by a violent effort I banish my qualms, and resolve, come what may,  _nothing_ shall unsteady me.  Still, my hands tremble as I grasp the  lines.    \"Adams,\" says Blades, \"make my stretcher fast, will you?\"    The voice of a human being close to me, somehow, has the effect of  helping me to recover my wits completely; and as I kneel and make fast  the stretcher, and then once again take my seat in the stern of the  boat, I feel quite myself again, and wonder at myself for being such an  ass.    \"Back water half a stroke!\" calls out Mr Blunt to us from his skiff.    We obey him, and then find the other boat is a little in front of us.  We therefore move a quarter of a stroke forward.  Still the boats are  not quite level.  The other boat must come back a foot or two.  Not  quite enough; our boat must advance a few inches.  There, now they are  level.    \"Are you ready?\"  No, our boat has drifted forward again, and must be  moved back.  All this takes time, but presently we are once again level,  and the question is repeated--    \"Are you ready?\"    The only answer this time is the leaning forward of both crews, with  arms stretched and oars well back, in readiness for the signal.    What ages it seems!  And there I actually the wind has blown our rivals'  bows across the stream, and before we start another two minutes must be  spent in manoeuvring her back into position.  Once again--    \"Are you ready?\"    No answer, save the quick reach forward and silent suspense.    \"Then go!\" and I feel the boat half lifted in the water under me.  The  first stroke is rather a scramble, and so is the second, but by the  third the boat has begun to get its \"way\" on, and in a stroke or two  more our men have settled down to their customary swing.    But what of our opponents?  At the first stroke their boat had dashed  away an inch or two in advance of ours, at the third that distance had  become a foot, and presently they were far enough ahead to enable me to  catch sight of their coxswain's back.  As we both settled down to work,  they were rowing at a considerably quicker pace than we, wrenching the  boat forward at each stroke, and inch by inch improving their advantage.    All this I noticed before the shout with which the spectators hailed the  start had died away.  I had a dim vision of a body of runners starting  along with us on the banks, and of eager cries to one crew or the other  from sympathising onlookers; but I had enough to do to keep my eye fixed  ahead, without gaping at the crowd.    Remembering Mr Blunt's advice, I selected a landmark in front, and  steered our course direct for it; a plan of which I had cause to be glad  pretty early in the race.  For the Old Boys' boat, drawing steadily  ahead to about half a boat's length, began very gradually to insinuate  its nose a little over in our direction, so that, had I not had a fixed  point on which to steer, I should have been strongly tempted to give way  unwittingly before it, and so abandon an inch or two of the water that  fairly belonged to our boat.  As it was, however, I was able both to  detect and defeat this manoeuvre, for, keeping on a perfectly straight  course, the others were obliged to draw in their horns, and return to a  straight course too, having lost some little ground in the process.  Still, they seemed to be forging ahead, and the shouts from the banks  announced that thus far, at any rate the Parkhurst boat was getting the  worst of it.    I stole a look at Blades.  His face was composed and unconcerned, and it  was easy to see he knew what he was about.  He kept up his long steady  swing, being well backed up by the three men behind him, and lifted the  boat well at the beginning of the stroke, never letting it down till the  end.  I could see that he knew exactly how far the others were ahead,  and at what rate they were rowing; and yet he neither quickened nor  altered his stroke, but plodded on with such a look of easy confidence  that I at once felt quite satisfied in my own mind as to the result.  It  was not long before our opponents gave indication of abating somewhat  the quick stroke they had hitherto maintained, and by virtue of which  they had already got nearly a boat's length ahead.  At the same moment  Blades slightly quickened his stroke, and instantly our boat began to  crawl up alongside that of our rivals, amid the frantic cheers of the  onlookers.  Slowly and surely we forged ahead, till our stroke's oar was  level with their coxswain.  Then a spurt from the Old Boys kept the two  boats abreast for a few seconds, but it died away after a little, and  once more their boat travelled slowly back, as we drew level, and began  in our turn to take the lead.  Now was our time to--    What is that ahead on the water, drifting right across the bows of our  boat?  A shout from the banks apprises me that others besides myself  have taken the sudden alarm.  An empty boat, insecurely moored to the  bank, has got adrift, and is calmly floating up with the tide in mid-  stream along our very course!  What is to be done?  The other boat,  being on the opposite side, can easily clear the obstacle, but not so  ours.  Either we must put our bows across our enemy's water, and so run  the risk of a \"foul,\" and consequent defeat, or else we must lose ground  by slackening our pace and going out of our course to avoid the unlucky  boat.  There are not ten seconds in which to decide; but that suffices  me to choose the latter alternative, trusting to the rowing powers of  our crew to make up the disadvantage.    \"Look to your oars, stroke side!\"  I cry, and at the same time pull my  rudder line quickly.    It was as I expected.  The boat lost ground instantly, and I could see,  out of the corner of my eye, the Old Boys' boat shoot forward with a  quickened stroke, and hear the triumphant shouts of their partisans.    A second or two sufficed to get past the obstructing boat, our oars on  the stroke side just scraping it as we did so; but as we headed again  into our proper course, we saw our opponents two clear boats' lengths in  front, their men pulling with all the energy of triumph and confidence.    It was a sight to make one despair.  How were we ever to make up that  tremendous gap?    \"How much?\"  Blades inquires, as he swings forward towards me.    \"Two!\"  I"]]]
