The plight of such young women is particularly  hard, for they are usually dependent upon their work.    It is, after all, not so much the things we do as the way we do them,  and what we think about them, that accomplishes nervous harm. Strangely  enough, the sense of effort and the feeling of our own inadequacy damage  the nervous system quite as much as the actual physical effort. The  attempt to catch up with life and with affairs that go on too fast for  us is a frequent and harmful deflection from the rules of the game. Few  of us avoid it. Life comes at us and goes by very fast. Tasks multiply  and we are inadequate, responsibilities increase before we are ready.  They bring fatigue and confusion. We cannot shirk and be true. Having  done all you reasonably can, stop, whatever may be the consequences.  That is a rule I would enforce if I could. To do more is to drag and  fail, so defeating the end of your efforts. If it turns out that you are  not fit for the job you have undertaken, give it up and find another, or  modify that one until it comes within your capacity. It takes courage to  do this--more courage sometimes than is needed to make us stick to the  thing we are doing. Rarely, however, will it be necessary for us to give  up if we will undertake and consider for the day only such part of our  task as we are able to perform. The trouble is that we look at our work  or our responsibility all in one piece, and it crushes us. If we cannot  arrange our lives so that we may meet their obligations a little at a  time, then we must admit failure and try again, on what may seem a  lower plane. That is what I consider the brave thing to do. I would  honor the factory superintendent, who, finding himself unequal to his  position, should choose to work at the bench where he could succeed  perfectly.    The habit of uncertainty in thought and action, bred, as it sometimes  is, from a lack of faith in man and in God, is, nevertheless, a thing to  be dealt with sometimes by itself. Not infrequently it is a petty habit  that can be corrected by the exercise of a little will power. I believe  it is better to decide wrong a great many times--doing it quickly--than  to come to a right decision after weakly vacillating. As a matter of  fact, we may trust our decisions to be fair and true if our life's  ideals are beautiful and true.    We may improve our indecisions a great deal by mastering their unhappy  details, but we shall not finally overcome them until life rings true  and until all our acts and thoughts become the solid and inevitable  expression of a healthy growing regard for the best in life, a call to  right living that is no mean dictum of policy, but which is renewed  every morning as the sun comes out of the sea. However inconsequential  the habit of indecision may seem, it is really one of the most disabling  of bad habits. Its continuance contributes largely to the sum of nervous  exhaustion. Whatever its origin, whether it stands in the relation of  cause or effect, it is an indulgence that insidiously takes the snap and  sparkle out of life and leaves us for the time being colorless and weak.    Next to uncertainty, an uninspired certainty is wrecking to the best of  human prospects. The man whose one idea is of making himself and his  family materially comfortable, or even rich, may not be coming to  nervous prostration, but he is courting a moral prostration that will  deny him all the real riches of life and that will in the end reward  him with a troubled mind, a great, unsatisfied longing, unless, to be  sure, he is too smug and satisfied to long for anything.    The larger life leads us inevitably away from ourselves, away from the  super-requirements of our families. It demands of them and of ourselves  an unselfishness that is born of a love that finds its expression in the  service of God. And what is the service of God if it is not such an  entering into the divine purposes and spirit that we become with God  re-creators in the world--working factors in the higher evolution of  humanity? While we live we shall get and save, we shall use and spend,  we shall serve the needs of those dependent upon us, but we shall not  line the family nest so softly that our children become powerless. We  shall not confine our charities to the specified channels, where our  names will be praised and our credit increased. We shall give and serve  in secret places with our hearts in our deeds. Then we may possess the  untroubled mind, a treasure too rich to be computed. We shall not have  it for the seeking; it may exist in the midst of what men may call  privations and sorrows; but it will exist in a very large sense and it  will be ours. The so-called hard-headed business man who never allows  himself to be taken advantage of, whose dealings are always strict and  uncompromising, is very apt to be a particularly miserable invalid when  he is ill. I cannot argue in favor of business laxity,--I know the  imperative need of exactness and finality,--but I do believe that if we  are to possess the untroubled mind we must make our lives larger than  the field of dollars and cents. The charity that develops in us will  make us truly generous and free from the reaction of hardness.    It is a great temptation to go on multiplying the rules of the game.  There are so many sensible and necessary pieces of advice which we all  need to have emphasized. That is the course we must try to avoid. The  child needs to be told, arbitrarily for a while, what is right, and what  is wrong, that he must do this, and he must not do that. The time comes,  however, when the growing instinct toward right living is the thing to  foster--not the details of life which will inevitably take care of  themselves if the underlying principle is made right. It must be the  ideal of moral teaching to make clear and pure the source of action.  Then the stream will be clear and pure. Such a stream will purify itself  and neutralize the dangerous inflow along its banks. It is true that  great harm may come from the polluted inflows, but they will be less and  less harmful as the increasing current from the good source flows down.    We shall have to look well to our habits lest serious ills befall, but  that must never be the main concern or we shall find ourselves living  very narrow and labored lives; we shall find that we are failing to  observe one of the most important rules of the game.          VI    THE NERVOUS TEMPERAMENT          Beyond the ugly actual, lo, on every side,      Imagination's limitless domain.                  BROWNING.        He that too much refines his delicacy will always endanger his      quiet.                  SAMUEL JOHNSON.        The great refinement of many poetical gentlemen has rendered      them practically unfit for the jostling and ugliness of life.                  STEVENSON.    It has been my fortune as a physician to deal much with the so-called  nervous temperament. I have come both to fear and to love it. It is the  essence of all that is bright, imaginative, and fine, but it is as  unstable as water. Those who possess it must suffer--it is their lot to  feel deeply, and very often to be misunderstood by their more practical  friends. All their lives these people will shed tears of joy, and more  tears of sorrow. I would like to write of their joy, of the perfect  satisfaction, the true happiness that comes in creating new and  beautiful things, of the deep pleasure they have in the appreciation of  good work in others. But with the instinct of a dog trained for a  certain kind of hunting I find myself turning to the misfortunes and the  ills.    The very keenness of perception makes painful anything short of  perfection. What will such people do in our clanging streets? What of  those fine ears tuned to the most exquisite appreciation of sweet sound?  What of that refinement of hearing that detects the least departure from  the rhythm and pitch in complex orchestral music? And must they bear the  crash of steel on stone, the infernal clatter of traffic? Well, yes,--as  a matter of fact--they must, at least for a good many years to come,  until advancing civilization eliminates the city noise. But it is not  always great noises that disturb and distract. There is a story told of  a woman who became so sensitive to noise that she had her house made  sound-proof: there were thick carpets and softly closing doors;  everything was padded. The house was set back from a quiet street, but  that street was strewn with tanbark to check the sound of carriages.  Surely here was bliss for the sensitive soul. I need not tell the rest  of the story, how absolutely necessary noises became intolerable, and  the poor woman ended by keeping a man on the place to catch and silence  the tree toads and crickets.    There is nothing to excuse the careless and unnecessary noises of the  world--we shall dispose of them finally as we are disposing of  flamboyant signboards and typhoid flies. But meanwhile, and always, for  that matter, the sensitive soul must learn to adjust itself to  circumstances and conditions. This adjustment may in itself become a  fine art. It is really the art by which the painter excludes the  commonplace and irrelevant from his landscape. Sometimes we have to do  this consciously; for the most part, it should be a natural, unconscious  selection.    I am sure it is unwise to attempt at any time the dulling of the  appreciative sense for the sake of peace and comfort. Love and  understanding of the beautiful and true is too rare and fine a thing to  be lost or diminished under any circumstances. The cure, as I see it, is  to be found in the cultivation of the faculty that finds some good in  everything and everybody."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22114"],[0,"A Plain Cookery Book for the Working Classes (#5)"],[1,"easy of digestion to the most  delicate stomachs.      No. 48. BROWN AND POLSON FRUIT PUDDING.    Prepare the pudding batter as indicated in the foregoing Number, and  when you have poured one-half of it into the greased pie-dish, strew  about two pounds of any kind of fruit upon this, such as gooseberries,  currants, plums, cherries, etc., and then pour the remainder of the  batter all over the fruit. Bake the pudding an hour and a quarter.  Peeled apples or pears may be used for the same purpose.      No. 49. BROWN AND POLSON THICK MILK.    Ingredients, three ounces of Brown and Polson's prepared Indian corn,  one quart of milk, one ounce of sugar, a bit of cinnamon, a pinch of  salt. Mix all the above-named ingredients together in a saucepan, and  stir them constantly while boiling on the fire for ten minutes. This  thick milk is most excellent for children's breakfast or supper, and  would be found both cheaper and better for their health than a sloppy  mess of tea.      No. 50. POTATO PUDDING.    Ingredients, three pounds of potatoes, two quarts of milk, two ounces of  butter, two ounces of sugar, a bit of lemon-peel, a good pinch of salt,  and three eggs. First, bake the potatoes, if you have means to do so, or  let them be either steamed or boiled; when done, scoop out all their  floury pulp without waste into a large saucepan, and immediately beat it  up vigorously with a large fork or a spoon; then add all the remainder  of the above-named ingredients (excepting the eggs), stir the potato  batter carefully on the fire till it comes to a boil, then add the  beaten eggs; pour the batter into a greased pie-dish, and bake the  pudding for an hour in your oven, if you have one; if not, send it to  the baker's.      No. 51. YEAST DUMPLINGS.    Ingredients, two pounds of flour, a halfpenny worth of yeast, a pinch of  salt, one pint of milk or water. Put the flour into a pan, with your  fist hollow out a hole in the centre of the flour, place the yeast and  salt at the bottom, then add the milk (which should be lukewarm), and  with your clean hand gradually mix the whole well together, and work the  dough perfectly smooth and elastic. The pan containing the dough must  then be covered over with a cloth, and in the winter must be placed on a  stool in a corner near the fire, that it may rise, or increase in size  to nearly double its original quantity. When the dough has risen in a  satisfactory manner, which will take about an hour, dip your hand in  some flour and work it, or rather knead it together, without allowing it  to stick to your hands; divide it into about twelve equal parts; roll  these with flour into balls, and as you turn them out of hand, drop them  gently into a pot on the fire, half full of _boiling_ water; allow the  water to boil up once as you drop each dumpling in separately, before  you attempt to put in another, in order to prevent the dumplings from  sticking together, as this accident would produce a very unsatisfactory  result, and spoil your dinner. Yeast dumplings must not boil too fast,  as then they might boil out of the pot. They will require about  half-an-hour's boiling to cook them; they must be eaten immediately,  with a little butter or dripping, and salt or sugar.      No. 52. NORFOLK DUMPLINGS.    Ingredients, two pounds of flour, a pint of milk, a good pinch of salt.  Let all these ingredients be well mixed in a pan, and after dividing the  paste into twelve equal parts, roll these into balls, drop each of them  into a pot half full of _boiling_ water on the fire, and allow the  dumplings to continue boiling rather fast for half-an-hour, at the end  of which time they will be done. They should then be eaten while hot,  with a little butter or dripping, and either sugar, treacle, or salt.  Norfolk dumplings are most excellent things to eke out an insufficient  supply of baked meat for the dinner of a large family of children.      No. 53. STEWED EELS.    First skin, gut, and trim away the fins from the eels, and then cut them  into pieces three inches long; put these into a saucepan, add a bit of  butter, a spoonful of flour, some chopped parsley, pepper and salt, a  little mushroom ketchup, and enough water to cover the pieces of eel;  put them on the fire to boil gently for about ten minutes, shaking them  round in the saucepan occasionally until they are done.      No. 54. STEWED OYSTERS.    Put the oysters, with their liquor and a little water or milk, into a  saucepan; add a bit of butter kneaded, that is, well mixed with a  table-spoonful of flour; pepper, and a little salt; stir the oysters  over the fire until they have gently boiled for about five minutes, and  then pour them into a dish containing some slices of toasted bread.      No. 55. STEWED MUSCLES, OR MUSSELS.    Thoroughly wash the muscles, and pull off any weeds there may be hanging  to them; next put them in a clean saucepan with a little water, and salt  enough to season, and set them on the fire to boil, tossing them  occasionally, until you find that their shells begin to open; they must  then be taken off the fire, and their liquor poured off into a basin.  Next, after removing one of the shells from each muscle, put them back  into the saucepan; add the liquor, a bit of butter, a spoonful of  flour, some pepper, chopped parsley, and a little drop of vinegar, toss  the whole over the fire until the muscles have boiled five minutes, and  then you will enjoy a treat for supper. Cockles and whelks are cooked in  the same way.      No. 56. BAKED BEEF AND POTATOES.    The cheapest pieces of beef, suitable for baking or roasting, consist of  the thick part of the ribs, cut from towards the shoulder, the mouse  buttock and gravy pieces, and also what is commonly called the chuck of  beef, which consists of the throat boned and tied up with string in the  form of a small round. Whichever piece of beef you may happen to buy, it  should be well sprinkled over with pepper, salt, and flour, and placed  upon a small iron trivet in a baking dish containing peeled potatoes and  about half-a-pint of water, and either baked in your own oven or else  sent to the baker's. If you bake your meat in your own oven, remember  that it must be turned over on the trivet every twenty minutes, and that  you must be careful to baste it all over now and then with the fat which  runs from it into the dish, using a spoon for that purpose. It would be  very economical if, when you have baked meat for dinner, you were always  to make a Yorkshire pudding to be baked under it. There are baking  dishes made with a parting down the middle which just suit this purpose.  In this case the potatoes are put in one part and the pudding in the  other part.      No. 57. YORKSHIRE PUDDING.    To one pound of flour add three pints of skim milk, two eggs, nutmeg and  salt; mix smoothly, and pour the pudding into the greased dish, and bake  it under the meat, as recommended above.      No. 58. BAKED SUET PUDDING.    To one pound of flour add six ounces of chopped suet, three pints of  skim milk, nutmeg and salt; mix thoroughly and smoothly, and bake the  pudding in the dish under the meat.      No. 59. TOAD IN THE HOLE.    To make this a cheap dinner, you should buy 6_d._ or 1_s._ worth of bits  or pieces of any kind of meat, which are to be had cheapest at night  when the day's sale is over. The pieces of meat should be first  carefully overlooked, to ascertain if there be any necessity to pare  away some tainted part, or perhaps a fly-blow, as this, if left on any  one piece of meat, would tend to impart a bad taste to the whole, and  spoil the dish. You then rub a little flour, pepper, and salt all over  the meat, and fry it brown with a little butter or fat in the  frying-pan; when done, put it with the fat in which it has been fried  into a baking-dish containing some Yorkshire or suet pudding batter,  made as directed at Nos. 57 and 58, and bake the toad-in-the-hole for  about an hour and a half, or else send it to the baker's.      No. 60. BOILED SHOULDER OF MUTTON WITH ONIONS.    Put the shoulder of mutton to boil in your two-gallon pot, with a  handful of salt and plenty of water, allow it to boil gently for about  two hours, and when done, and placed on its dish, smother it over with  the following sauce:--Chop six or eight large onions, and boil them with  a pint of water for twenty minutes, by which time the water must be  reduced to half a pint; then add two ounces of butter, a pint of milk,  four ounces of flour, pepper, and salt, and stir the sauce whilst  boiling for ten minutes. A shoulder of mutton for boiling is all the  better for its being salted for two or three days previous to its being  cooked.      No. 61. MEAT PIE.    Of whatever kind, let the pieces of meat be first fried brown over a  quick fire, in a little fat or butter, and seasoned with pepper and  salt; put these into a pie-dish with chopped onions, a few slices of  half-cooked potatoes, and enough water just to cover the meat. Cover the  dish with a crust, made with two pounds of flour and six ounces of  butter, or lard, or fat dripping, and just enough water to knead it into  a stiff kind of dough or paste, and then bake it for about an hour and  a-half.      No. 62. GIBLET PIE.    Giblets of fowls are always to be bought at a low price at most  poulterers'; when you have a mind to lay out 6_d._ or 1_s._ in this way,  first scald the necks and feet, to remove the feathers from the head and  the rough skin from the feet; split the gizzard and scrape out the  stones, etc., and the yellow skin therefrom, and when the giblets are  thoroughly cleaned, put them into a saucepan with some thyme, winter  savory, chopped onions, pepper and salt, and about a quart of water, and  set them on the fire to stew very gently for an hour, by which time the  liquor should be boiled down to half that quantity; then add two ounces  of flour and a little mushroom ketchup; stir"]]]
