They  came, for the most part, of the indigenous Berber population, and were  not naturally disposed to intolerance or unneighbourliness. The  Christians kept their churches, and were suffered to worship  unmolested. We read of a Bishop of Fez as late as the thirteenth  century, and the Kings of Morocco and Tunis were usually on friendly  terms with the Pope. Christians were largely enrolled in the African  armies, and were even appointed to civil employments. The relations of  the rulers of Barbary with the European States throughout the greater  part of this period--from the eleventh century, when the fighting  F[=a]tim[=i]s left Tunis and went eastward to Egypt, to the sixteenth,  when the fighting Turks came westward to molest the peace of the  Mediterranean--were eminently wise and statesmanlike. The Africans  wanted many of the industries of Europe; Europe required the skins and  raw products of Africa: and a series of treaties involving a principle  of reciprocity was the result. No doubt the naval inferiority of the  African States to the trading Republics of the Mediterranean was a  potent factor in bringing about this satisfactory arrangement; but it  is only right to admit the remarkable fairness, moderation, and  probity of the African princes in the settlement and maintenance of  these treaties. As a general rule, Sicily and the commercial Republics  were allied to the rulers of Tunis and Tilims[=a]n and Fez by bonds of  amity and mutual advantage. One after the other, Pisa, Genoa,  Provence, Aragon, and Venice, concluded commercial treaties with the  African sovereigns, and renewed them from time to time. Some of these  States had special quarters reserved for them at Tunis, Ceuta, and  other towns; and all had their consuls in the thirteenth century, who  were protected in a manner that the English agent at Algiers would  have envied seventy years ago. The African trade was especially  valuable to the Pisans and Genoese, and there was a regular African  company trading at the Ports of Tripoli, Tunis, Buj[=e]ya, Ceuta, and  Sal[=e]. Indeed, the Genoese went so far as to defend Ceuta against  Christian crusaders, so much did commerce avail against religion; and,  on the other hand, the Christian residents at Tunis, the western  metropolis of Islam, had their own place of worship, where they were  free to pray undisturbed, as late as 1530. This tolerance was largely  due to the mild and judicious government of the Ben[=i] Hafs, whose  three centuries' sway at Tunis was an unmixed benefit to their  subjects, and to all who had relations with them.    Not that the years passed by without war and retaliation, or that  treaties made piracy impossible. In the early and more pugnacious days  of the Saracen domination conflicts were frequent. The F[=a]tim[=i]  Khalifs conquered and held all the larger islands of the Western  Mediterranean, Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, and the Balearic Isles. In  1002 the Saracens pillaged Pisa, and the Pisans retaliated by burning  an African fleet. Three years later El-Muj[=a]hid (\"Muget\"), the lord  of Majorca, and conqueror of Sardinia, burnt part of Pisa; and another  incursion is recorded in 1011. From his stronghold at Luni in Etruria  this terrible scourge ravaged the country round, until the Pope drove  him out of Italy, and the Pisans and others turned him out of Sardinia  (1017). We read of African fleets cruising with hostile intent off the  Calabrian coast, and of the Pisans taking Bona, which was then a nest  of Corsairs (1034). Mahd[=i]ya was burnt in 1087, and Sicily conquered  by the Normans about the same time (1072). But these were in the early  days, and even then were the exceptions; in succeeding centuries,  under more settled governments, war became very rare, and mutual amity  was the prevailing policy.[3]    Piracy was always distinctly prohibited in the commercial treaties of  the African States; nevertheless piracy went on, and most  pertinaciously on the part of the Christians. The Greeks, Sardinians,  Maltese, and Genoese were by far the worse members of the fraternity  of rovers, as the treaties themselves prove: the increase of commerce  under the stimulus of the Crusades tempted the adventurous, and the  absence of any organized State navies gave them immunity; and there  was generally a war afoot between some nation or other, Christian or  Moslem, and piracy (in the then state of international law) at once  became legitimate privateering. Our buccaneers of the Spanish main had  the same apology to offer. But it is important to observe that all  this was private piracy: the African and the Italian governments  distinctly repudiated the practice, and bound themselves to execute  any Corsair of their own country whom they might arrest, and to  deliver all his goods over to the state which he had robbed.[4] These  early Corsairs were private freebooters, totally distinct from the  authorized pirates of later days. In 1200, in time of peace, two Pisan  vessels attacked three Mohammedan ships in Tunis roads, captured the  crews, outraged the women, and made off, vainly pursued by the  Tunisian fleet: but they received no countenance from Pisa, the  merchants of which might have suffered severely had the Tunisians  exacted reprisals. Sicily was full of Corsairs, and the King of Tunis  paid a sort of tribute to the Normans, partly to induce them to  restrain these excesses. Aragonese and Genoese preyed upon each other  and upon the Moslems; but their doings were entirely private and  unsupported by the state.    Up to the fourteenth century the Christians were the chief pirates of  the Mediterranean, and dealt largely in stolen goods and slaves. Then  the growth of large commercial fleets discouraged the profession, and  very soon we begin to hear much less of European brigandage, and much  more of Moorish Corsairs. The inhabitants of the coast about the Gulf  of Gabes had always shown a bent towards piracy, and the port of  Mahd[=i]ya, or \"Africa,\" now became a regular resort of sea rovers.  El-Bekr[=i], in the twelfth century, had noticed the practice of  sending galleys on the cruise for prey (perhaps during war) from the  harbours of Bona; and Ibn-Khald[=u]n, in the fourteenth, describes an  organized company of pirates at Buj[=e]ya, who made a handsome profit  from goods and the ransom of captives. The evil grew with the increase  of the Turkish power in the Levant, and received a violent impetus  upon the fall of Constantinople; while on the west, the gradual  expulsion of the Moors from Spain which followed upon the Christian  advance filled Africa with disaffected, ruined, and vengeful Moriscos,  whose one dominant passion was to wipe out their old scores with the  Spaniards.    Against such influences the mild governors of North Africa were  powerless. They had so long enjoyed peace and friendship with the  Mediterranean States, that they were in no condition to enforce order  with the strong hand. Their armies and fleets were insignificant, and  their coasts were long to protect, and abounded with almost  impregnable strongholds which they could not afford to garrison.  Hence, when the Moors flocked over from Spain, the shores of Africa  offered them a sure and accessible refuge, and the hospitable  character of the Moslem's religion forbade all thought of repelling  the refugees. Still more, when the armed galleots of the Levant came  crowding to Barbary, fired with the hope of rich gain, the ports were  open, and the creeks afforded them shelter. A foothold once gained,  the rest was easy.    It was to this land, lying ready to his use, that Captain Ur[=u]j  Barbarossa came in the beginning of the sixteenth century.

The island of Lesbos has given many gifts to the world--Lesbian wine  and Lesbian verse, the seven-stringed lyre, and the poems of Sappho;  but of all its products the latest was assuredly the most  questionable, for the last great Lesbians were the brothers  Barbarossa.    When Sultan Mohammed II. conquered the island in 1462, he left there a  certain Sip[=a]hi soldier, named Ya'k[=u]b--so say the Turkish  annalists, but the Spanish writers claim him as a native  Christian--who became the father of Ur[=u]j Barbarossa and his brother  Kheyr-ed-d[=i]n. Various stories are told of their early career, and  the causes which led to their taking to the sea; but as Lesbos had  long been famous for its buccaneers, whether indigenous or  importations from Catalonia and Aragon, there was nothing unusual in  the brothers adopting a profession which was alike congenial to bold  hearts and sanctioned by time-honoured precedent.[5] Ur[=u]j, the  elder, soon became the reis, or captain, of a galleot, and finding his  operations hampered in the Archipelago by the predominance of the  Sultan's fleet, he determined to seek a wider and less interrupted  field for his depredations. Rumours had reached the Levant of the  successes of the Moorish pirates; prodigious tales were abroad as to  great argosies, laden with the treasures of the New World, passing and  repassing the narrow seas between Europe and Africa, and seeming to  invite capture; and it was not long (1504) before Captain Ur[=u]j  found himself cruising with two galleots off the Barbary coast, and  spying out the land in search of a good harbour and a safe refuge from  pursuit.

At this critical juncture my father's old follower Kishori came to the  rescue, and finished the episode for us, at express speed, to the  quickstep of Dasuraya's jingling verses. The impression of the soft slow  chant of Krittivasa's[7] fourteen-syllabled measure was swept clean away  and we were left overwhelmed by a flood of rhymes and alliterations.    On some occasions these readings would give rise to shastric  discussions, which would at length be settled by the depth of Iswar's  wise pronouncements. Though, as one of the children's servants, his rank  in our domestic society was below that of many, yet, as with old  Grandfather Bhisma in the Mahabharata, his supremacy would assert itself  from his seat, below his juniors.    Our grave and reverend servitor had one weakness to which, for the sake  of historical accuracy, I feel bound to allude. He used to take opium.  This created a craving for rich food. So that when he brought us our  morning goblets of milk the forces of attraction in his mind would be  greater than those of repulsion. If we gave the least expression to our  natural repugnance for this meal, no sense of responsibility for our  health could prompt him to press it on us a second time.    Iswar also held somewhat narrow views as to our capacity for solid  nourishment. We would sit down to our evening repast and a quantity of  _luchis_[8] heaped on a thick round wooden tray would be placed before  us. He would begin by gingerly dropping a few on each platter, from a  sufficient height to safeguard himself from contamination[9]--like  unwilling favours, wrested from the gods by dint of importunity, did  they descend, so dexterously inhospitable was he. Next would come the  inquiry whether he should give us any more. I knew the reply which would  be most gratifying, and could not bring myself to deprive him by asking  for another help.    Then again Iswar was entrusted with a daily allowance of money for  procuring our afternoon light refreshment. He would ask us every morning  what we should like to have. We knew that to mention the cheapest would  be accounted best, so sometimes we ordered a light refection of puffed  rice, and at others an indigestible one of boiled gram or roasted  groundnuts. It was evident that Iswar was not as painstakingly  punctilious in regard to our diet as with the shastric proprieties.          (5) _The Normal School_      While at the Oriental Seminary I had discovered a way out of the  degradation of being a mere pupil. I had started a class of my own in a  corner of our verandah. The wooden bars of the railing were my pupils,  and I would act the schoolmaster, cane in hand, seated on a chair in  front of them. I had decided which were the good boys and which the  bad--nay, further, I could distinguish clearly the quiet from the  naughty, the clever from the stupid. The bad rails had suffered so much  from my constant caning that they must have longed to give up the ghost  had they been alive. And the more scarred they got with my strokes the  worse they angered me, till I knew not how to punish them enough. None  remain to bear witness to-day how tremendously I tyrannised over that  poor dumb class of mine. My wooden pupils have since been replaced by  cast-iron railings, nor have any of the new generation taken up their  education in the same way--they could never have made the same  impression.    I have since realised how much easier it is to acquire the manner than  the matter. Without an effort had I assimilated all the impatience, the  short temper, the partiality and the injustice displayed by my teachers  to the exclusion of the rest of their teaching. My only consolation is  that I had not the power of venting these barbarities on any sentient  creature. Nevertheless the difference between my wooden pupils and those  of the Seminary did not prevent my psychology from being identical with  that of its schoolmasters.    I could not have been long at the Oriental Seminary, for I was still of  tender age when I joined the Normal School. The only one of its features  which I remember is that before the classes began all the boys had to  sit in a row in the gallery and go through some kind of singing or  chanting of verses--evidently an attempt at introducing an element of  cheerfulness into the daily routine.    Unfortunately the words were English and the tune quite as foreign, so  that we had not the faintest notion what sort of incantation we were  practising; neither did the meaningless monotony of the performance tend  to make us cheerful. This failed to disturb the serene self-satisfaction  of the school authorities at having provided such a treat; they deemed  it superfluous to inquire into the practical effect of their bounty;  they would probably have counted it a crime for the boys not to be  dutifully happy. Anyhow they rested content with taking the song as they  found it, words and all, from the self-same English book which had  furnished the theory.    The language into which this English resolved itself in our mouths  cannot but be edifying to philologists. I can recall only one line:    _Kallokee pullokee singill mellaling mellaling mellaling._    After much thought I have been able to guess at the original of a part  of it. Of what words _kallokee_ is the transformation still baffles me.  The rest I think was:    _... full of glee, singing merrily, merrily, merrily!_    As my memories of the Normal School emerge from haziness and become  clearer they are not the least sweet in any particular. Had I been able  to associate with the other boys, the woes of learning might not have  seemed so intolerable. But that turned out to be impossible--so nasty  were most of the boys in their manners and habits. So, in the intervals  of the classes, I would go up to the second storey and while away the  time sitting near a window overlooking the street. I would count: one  year--two years--three years--; wondering how many such would have to be  got through like this.    Of the teachers I remember only one, whose language was so foul that,  out of sheer contempt for him, I steadily refused to answer any one of  his questions. Thus I sat silent throughout the year at the bottom of  his class, and while the rest of the class was busy I would be left  alone to attempt the solution of many an intricate problem.    One of these, I remember, on which I used to cogitate profoundly, was  how to defeat an enemy without having arms. My preoccupation with this  question, amidst the hum of the boys reciting their lessons, comes back  to me even now. If I could properly train up a number of dogs, tigers  and other ferocious beasts, and put a few lines of these on the field of  battle, that, I thought, would serve very well as an inspiriting  prelude. With our personal prowess let loose thereafter, victory should  by no means be out of reach. And, as the picture of this wonderfully  simple strategy waxed vivid in my imagination, the victory of my side  became assured beyond doubt.    While work had not yet come into my life I always found it easy to  devise short cuts to achievement; since I have been working I find that  what is hard is hard indeed, and what is difficult remains difficult.  This, of course, is less comforting; but nowhere near so bad as the  discomfort of trying to take shortcuts.    When at length a year of that class had passed, we were examined in  Bengali by Pandit Madhusudan Vachaspati. I got the largest number of  marks of all the boys. The teacher complained to the school authorities  that there had been favouritism in my case. So I was examined a second  time, with the superintendent of the school seated beside the examiner.  This time, also, I got a top place.          (6) _Versification_      I could not have been more than eight years old at the time. Jyoti, a  son of a niece of my father's, was considerably older than I. He had  just gained an entrance into English literature, and would recite  Hamlet's soliloquy with great gusto. Why he should have taken it into  his head to get a child, as I was, to write poetry I cannot tell. One  afternoon he sent for me to his room, and asked me to try and make up a  verse; after which he explained to me the construction of the _payar_  metre of fourteen syllables.    I had up to then only seen poems in printed books--no mistakes penned  through, no sign to the eye of doubt or trouble or any human weakness. I  could not have dared even to imagine that any effort of mine could  produce such poetry.    One day a thief had been caught in our house. Overpowered by curiosity,  yet in fear and trembling, I ventured to the spot to take a peep at him.  I found he was just an ordinary man! And when he was somewhat roughly  handled by our door-keeper I felt a great pity. I had a similar  experience with poetry.    When, after stringing together a few words at my own sweet will, I found  them turned into a _payar_ verse I felt I had no illusions left about  the glories of poetising. So when poor Poetry is mishandled, even now I  feel as unhappy as I did about the thief. Many a time have I been moved  to pity and yet been unable to restrain impatient hands itching for the  assault. Thieves have scarcely suffered so much, and from so many.    The first feeling of awe once overcome there was no holding me back. I  managed to get hold of a blue-paper manuscript book by the favour of one  of the officers of our estate. With my own hands I ruled it with pencil  lines, at not very regular intervals, and thereon I began to write  verses in a large childish scrawl.    Like a young deer which butts here, there and everywhere with its newly  sprouting horns, I made myself a nuisance with my budding poetry. More  so my elder[10] brother, whose pride in my performance impelled him to  hunt about the house for an audience.    I recollect how, as the pair of us, one day,"]]]
