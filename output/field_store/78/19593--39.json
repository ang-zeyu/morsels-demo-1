His latest publication is _Wild Wales_. He has written many other  works, some of which are not yet published. He has an estate in Suffolk,  but spends the greater part of his time in wandering on foot through  various countries.           *       *       *       *       *    DRAFT II.--George Henry Borrow was born at East Dereham in the county of  Norfolk on the 5th July 1803. His father, Thomas Borrow, who died  captain and adjutant of the West Norfolk Militia, was of an ancient but  reduced Cornish family, tracing descent from the de Burghs, and entitled  to carry their arms. His mother, Ann Perfrement, was a native of  Norfolk, and descended from a family of French Protestants banished from  France on the revocation of the edict of Nantes. He was the youngest of  two sons. His brother, John Thomas, who was endowed with various and  very remarkable talents, died at an early age in Mexico. Both the  brothers had the advantage of being at some of the first schools in  Britain. The last at which they were placed was the Grammar School at  Norwich, to which town their father came to reside at the termination of  the French war. In the year 1818 George Borrow was articled to an  eminent solicitor in Norwich, with whom he continued five years. He did  not devote himself much to his profession, his mind being engrossed by  another and very different subject--namely philology, for which at a  very early period he had shown a decided inclination, having when in  Ireland with his father acquired the Irish language. At the expiration  of his clerkship he knew little of the law, but was well versed in  languages, being not only a good Greek and Latin scholar, but acquainted  with French, Italian, and Spanish, all the Celtic and Gothic dialects,  and likewise with the peculiar language of the English Romany Chals or  Gypsies. This speech or jargon, amounting to about eleven hundred and  twenty-seven words, he had picked up amongst the wandering tribes with  whom he had formed acquaintance on Mousehold, a wild heath near Norwich,  where they were in the habit of encamping. By the time his clerkship was  expired his father was dead, and he had little to depend upon but the  exercise of his abilities such as they were. In 1823 he betook himself  to London, and endeavoured to obtain a livelihood by literature. For  some time he was a hack author, doing common work for booksellers. For  one in particular he prepared an edition of the Newgate Calendar, from  the careful study of which he has often been heard to say that he first  learned to write genuine English. His health failed, he left London, and  for a considerable time he lived a life of roving adventure.    [4] Knapp's _Life of Borrow_, vol. i. p. 6.    [5] The writer recalls at his own school at Downham Market in Norfolk an  old Crimean Veteran--Serjeant Canham--drilling the boys each week, thus  supplementing his income precisely in the same manner as did Serjeant  Borrow.    [6] The date has always hitherto been wrongly given. I find it in one of  Ann Borrow's notebooks, but although every vicar of every parish in  Chelmsford and Colchester has searched the registers for me, with  agreeable courtesy, I cannot discover a record of John's birthplace, and  am compelled to the belief that Dr. Knapp was wrong in suggesting one or  other of these towns.

CHAPTER II    BORROW'S MOTHER      Throughout his whole life George Borrow adored his mother, who seems to  have developed into a woman of great strength of character far remote  from the pretty play-actor who won the heart of a young soldier at East  Dereham in the last years of the eighteenth century. We would gladly  know something of the early years of Ann Perfrement. Her father was a  farmer, whose farm at Dumpling Green we have already described. He did  not, however, 'farm his own little estate' as Borrow declared. The  grandfather--a French Protestant--came, if we are to believe Borrow,  from Caen in Normandy after the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, but  there is no documentary evidence to support the contention. However, the  story of the Huguenot immigration into England is clearly bound up with  Norwich and the adjacent district. And so we may well take the name of  'Perfrement' as conclusive evidence of a French origin, and reject as  utterly untenable the not unnatural suggestion of Nathaniel Hawthorne,  that Borrow's mother was 'of gypsy descent.'[9] She was one of the eight  children of Samuel and Mary Perfrement, all of whom seem to have  devoted their lives to East Anglia.[10] We owe to Dr. Knapp's edition of  _Lavengro_ one exquisite glimpse of Ann's girlhood that is not in any  other issue of the book. Ann's elder sister, curious to know if she was  ever to be married, falls in with the current superstition that she must  wash her linen and 'watch' it drying before the fire between eleven and  twelve at night. Ann Perfrement was ten years old at the time. The two  girls walked over to East Dereham, purchased the necessary garment,  washed it in the pool near the house that may still be seen, and watched  and watched. Suddenly when the clock struck twelve they heard, or  thought they heard, a footstep on the path, the wind howled, and the  elder sister sprang to the door, locked and bolted it, and then fell in  convulsions on the floor. The superstition, which Borrow seems to have  told his mother had a Danish origin, is common enough in Ireland and in  Celtic lands. It could scarcely have been thus rehearsed by two Norfolk  children had they not had the blood of a more imaginative race in their  veins. In addition to this we find more than one effective glimpse of  Borrow's mother in _Lavengro_. We have already noted the episode in  which she takes the side of her younger boy against her husband, with  whom John was the favourite. We meet her again in the following  dialogue, with its pathetic allusions to Dante and to the complaint--a  kind of nervous exhaustion which he called 'the horrors'--that was to  trouble Borrow all his days:         'What ails you, my child?' said a mother to her son, as he lay       on a couch under the influence of the dreadful one; 'what ails       you? you seem afraid!'         _Boy._ And so I am; a dreadful fear is upon me.         _Mother._ But of what? there is no one can harm you; of what       are you apprehensive?         _Boy._ Of nothing that I can express. I know not what I am       afraid of, but afraid I am.         _Mother._ Perhaps you see sights and visions. I knew a lady       once who was continually thinking that she saw an armed man       threaten her, but it was only an imagination, a phantom of the       brain.         _Boy._ No armed man threatens me; and 'tis not a thing like       that would cause me any fear. Did an armed man threaten me I       would get up and fight him; weak as I am, I would wish for       nothing better, for then, perhaps, I should lose this fear;       mine is a dread of I know not what, and there the horror lies.         _Mother._ Your forehead is cool, and your speech collected. Do       you know where you are?         _Boy._ I know where I am, and I see things just as they are;       you are beside me, and upon the table there is a book which was       written by a Florentine; all this I see, and that there is no       ground for being afraid. I am, moreover, quite cool, and feel       no pain--but, but----         And then there was a burst of 'gemiti, sospiri ed alti guai.'       Alas, alas, poor child of clay! as the sparks fly upward, so       wast thou born to sorrow--Onward![11]    Our next glimpse of Mrs. Borrow is when after his father's death George  had shouldered his knapsack and made his way to London to seek his  fortune by literature. His elder brother had remained at home,  determined upon being a painter, but joined George in London, leaving  the widowed mother momentarily alone in Norwich.         'And how are things going on at home?' said I to my brother,       after we had kissed and embraced. 'How is my mother, and how is       the dog?'         'My mother, thank God, is tolerably well,' said my brother,       'but very much given to fits of crying. As for the dog, he is       not so well; but we will talk more of these matters anon,' said       my brother, again glancing at the breakfast things. 'I am very       hungry, as you may suppose, after having travelled all night.'         Thereupon I exerted myself to the best of my ability to perform       the duties of hospitality, and I made my brother welcome--I may       say more than welcome; and when the rage of my brother's hunger       was somewhat abated, we recommenced talking about the matters       of our little family, and my brother told me much about my       mother; he spoke of her fits of crying, but said that of late       the said fits of crying had much diminished, and she appeared       to be taking comfort; and, if I am not much mistaken, my       brother told me that my mother had of late the prayer-book       frequently in her hand, and yet oftener the Bible.[12]    Ann Borrow lived in Willow Lane, Norwich, for thirty-three years. That  Borrow was a devoted husband these pages will show. He was also a  devoted son. When he had made a prosperous marriage he tried hard to  persuade his mother to live with him at Oulton, but all in vain. She had  the wisdom to see that such an arrangement is rarely conducive to a  son's domestic happiness. She continued to live in the little cottage  made sacred by many associations until almost the end of her days. Here  she had lived in earlier years with her husband and her two ambitious  boys, and in Norwich, doubtless, she had made her own friendships,  although of these no record remains.

NEW ZEALAND LIBRARY ASSOCIATION TRAINING COURSE    Part II of this course was held at the Library School from 14 January to  15 February. Twenty-two students attended and all were recommended for  the award of the Association's certificate.    1957 SHORT COURSE    A short course for librarians and library assistants mainly from smaller  public libraries was held from 12 to 31 August. There were 21 students  from the following public libraries: Birkenhead, Blenheim, Dargaville,  Devonport, Hawera, Howick, Huntly, Inglewood, Kaiapoi, Kaikohe, Kaitaia,  Martinborough, Mataura, Nelson Institute, Otaki, Palmerston, Rangiora,  Taumarunui, Upper Hutt, Waiuku, Warkworth, and a field librarian from  the Country Library Service, Hamilton.    In addition to lectures and practical exercises, several hours were set  aside for the informal discussion of problems and special questions  raised by the students. Senior members of National Library Service  headquarters joined the staff of the school in these discussions.    Limits imposed by the size of the school made it necessary to defer  acceptance of some students eligible for this course.    A short course on similar lines will be offered again in August this  year to librarians or library assistants of small public libraries who  are not able to take advantage of other means of training.    As in previous years we wish to acknowledge the valuable contribution  made to these courses by visiting lecturers and the libraries which lend  us books.            SECTION IV--NATIONAL LIBRARY CENTRE      The National Library Centre, in addition to acting as the division  responsible for the headquarters work of the Service, has continued to  promote the cooperative use of library resources. Staff at headquarters  are still working under very difficult conditions and there is a  continuing and pressing need both for administrative working space and  adequate housing for the book collections.    _Inter-library Loan_--All inter-library loan requests for books and  periodicals the location of which is not known are sent to the National  Centre. Items which are not found in the Union Catalogue of non-fiction  books, the _Union List of Serials_, or other bibliographical sources are  listed in the weekly publication _Book Resources_, which is sent to 39  libraries for checking.                                                  1956-57          1957-58                                            Number     %     Number      %    Interloan cards received                  7,197  100.0     7,640   100.0  Supplied from National Library Service    4,312   59.9     4,411    57.7  Supplied from other Wellington libraries    171    2.4       139     1.8  Supplied from Union Catalogue records       949   13.2     1,055    13.8  Supplied from _Union List of Serials_       101    1.4       173     2.3  Not supplied for various reasons            641    8.9       664     8.7  Listed on _Book Resources_                1,023   14.2     1,198    15.7    Four hundred and seventy-five titles not found in any library were  ordered for national stock.    The number of requests received by the centre represents probably less  than half the total volume of traffic among New Zealand libraries, the  proportion of direct interloan being higher in the special and  university libraries. Interloan was devised and introduced among  libraries by the New Zealand Library Association and in its operation  the responsibility of the National Library Service is not merely to act  as a clearing house but to provide all the material it reasonably can to  make the system effective. Other libraries participate reciprocally, or  lend so that they may the more freely borrow. The contribution, as has  always been expected, is a varying one and one or two libraries may  consider that they have a substantial and unrealisable credit balance in  their favour. The point beyond which certain libraries may feel they  cannot go in the common interest has not so far been determined  administratively but it may be necessary to consider this. If so, it is  better that it be done quantitatively on the basis of a common library  policy rather than that the present procedure should become an  embarrassment or be administered capriciously or conservatively.    _Central Bureau for Library Book Imports_--After the introduction of  import control in January the Government approved that the facilities of  the bureau should be extended to meet the situation and assure libraries  of their essential supplies. The bureau was set up in 1940 as a  responsibility of the Country Library Service as a result of discussions  between the Government and the Library Association. Because libraries  undertook to avoid unnecessary duplication and develop cooperative ways  of recording and using their holdings, the 50 per cent cut in book  imports made in 1939 was restored and the necessary machinery  established to safeguard the country's supply of essential publications.    The situation now is that recommendations for licences are made to the  Comptroller of Customs in two categories: firstly, block licence in  annual or six-monthly lots to cover a full licensing period, on behalf  of public libraries serving a population of 20,000 and over, university  libraries, and a few special libraries; secondly, individual  recommendations on behalf of smaller libraries which are made on the  basis of orders sent in when making application. Book-sellers are  expected to give libraries a proportionate share of their 1956  transactions on which their current licence would be computed.    Block licence recommendations, normally made at the end of the year--and  for some years only for anticipated imports from scheduled countries,  chiefly the dollar area--were held over until the present calendar year  and statistically will be included in the figures for the 1958 licensing  period.    _Libraries of Government Departments_--A total of L45,357 was spent on  behalf of Government Departments financed from the Consolidated Fund and  purchasing through the National Library Service. Of this total, L25,344  was for standing orders, chiefly periodical subscriptions. The value,  nationally, of a range of periodicals wider than that which is now  received by all the libraries would scarcely be disputed, but the degree  of duplication between and particularly within Departments continues to  cause concern.    _Book Resources Committee of the New Zealand Library Association_--The  Book Resources Committee of which the Librarian, National Centre, is  Secretary, has continued to act as the national planning and advisory  body in the cooperative acquisition, recording, and use of publications.  In June and July of this year Dr K. D. Metcalf, Librarian Emeritus of  Harvard, at the joint invitation of the United States Educational  Foundation in New Zealand and the New Zealand Government, will visit New  Zealand. Dr Metcalf will visit the main centres and will have  discussions with the committee and the Government on policy matters.    _Union Catalogue_--During the year 26,033 new titles were added  including 2,928 from the microfilmed record of library catalogues. The  catalogue now includes over 400,000 entries.      BIBLIOGRAPHICAL SECTION    _Union List of Serials_--The typing and printing of the sixth  (cumulative) supplement to the _Union List of Serials_ has commenced and  publication is anticipated early in 1959.    _Index to New Zealand Periodicals_--The 1956 issue of the index, the  first for which the National Library Service has accepted the  responsibility of publication, was printed by photo-offset and  distributed. The 1957 issue is being prepared in the same way. The  possibility of simplifying production by printing direct from the typed  cards is being explored.    _General_--Printed catalogue cards for 247 New Zealand books and  pamphlets were issued during the year. Work on the national  bibliography, from 1890 to 1950, has continued and it is hoped to  commence the typing of a preliminary check list of holdings at the end  of the year.      BY AUTHORITY:  R. E.
