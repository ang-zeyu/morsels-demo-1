[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21614"],[0,"For the Temple: A Tale of the Fall of Jerusalem (#5)"],[1," one's got a father and mother  like mine--who would be sure to think only of making me happy, and  not of the amount of dowry, or anything of that sort--it would be  all right; but with some parents, it would be dreadful.\"    For some time, not a word was spoken; both of them meditating over  the unpleasantness of being forced to marry someone they disliked.  Then, finding the subject too difficult for them, they began to  talk about other things; stopping, sometimes, to see the fishermen  haul up their nets, for there were a number of boats out on the  lake. They rowed down as far as Tiberias and, there, John ceased  rowing; and they sat chatting over the wealth and beauty of that  city, which John had often visited with his father, but which Mary  had never entered.    Then John turned the head of the boat up the lake and again began  to row but, scarcely had he dipped his oar into the water, when he  exclaimed:    \"Look at that black cloud rising, at the other end of the lake! Why  did you not tell me, Mary?\"    \"How stupid of me,\" she exclaimed, \"not to have kept my eyes open!\"    He bent to his oars, and made the boat move through the water at a  very different rate to that at which she had before traveled.    \"Most of the boats have gone,\" Mary said, presently, \"and the rest  are all rowing to the shore; and the clouds are coming up very  fast,\" she added, looking round.    \"We are going to have a storm,\" John said. \"It will be upon us long  before we get back. I shall make for the shore, Mary. We must leave  the boat there, and take shelter for a while, and then walk home.  It will not be more than four miles to walk.\"    But though he spoke cheerfully, John knew enough of the sudden  storms that burst upon the Sea of Galilee to be aware that, long  before he could cross the mile and a half of water, which separated  them from the eastern shore, the storm would be upon them; and  indeed, they were not more than half way when it burst.    The sky was already covered with black clouds. A great darkness  gathered round them; then came a heavy downpour of rain; and then,  with a sudden burst, the wind smote them. It was useless, now, to  try to row, for the oars would have been twisted from his hands in  a moment; and John took the helm, and told Mary to lie down in the  bottom of the boat. He had already turned the boat's head up the  lake, the direction in which the storm was traveling.    The boat sprang forward, as if it had received a blow, when the  gale struck it. John had, more than once, been out on the lake with  the fishermen, when sudden storms had come up; and knew what was  best to be done. When he had laid in his oars, he had put them so  that the blades stood partly up above the bow, and caught the wind  somewhat; and he, himself, crouched down in the bottom, with his  head below the gunwale and his hand on the tiller; so that the  tendency of the boat was to drive straight before the wind. With a  strong crew, he knew that he could have rowed obliquely towards the  shore but, alone, his strength could have done nothing to keep the  heavy boat off her course.    The sea rose, as if by magic, and the spray was soon dashing over  them; each wave, as it followed the boat, rising higher and higher.  The shores were no longer visible; and the crests of the waves  seemed to gleam, with a pallid light, in the darkness which  surrounded them. John sat quietly in the bottom of the boat, with  one hand on the tiller and the other arm round Mary, who was  crouched up against him. She had made no cry, or exclamation, from  the moment the gale struck them.    Illustration: On the Sea of Galilee.    \"Are we getting near shore?\" she asked, at last.    \"No, Mary; we are running straight before the wind, which is  blowing right up the lake. There is nothing to be done but to keep  straight before it.\"    Mary had seen many storms on the lake, and knew into what a fury  its waters were lashed, in a tempest such as was now upon them.    \"We are in God's hands, John,\" she said, with the quiet resignation  of her race. \"He can save us, if He will. Let us pray to him.\"    John nodded and, for a few minutes, no word was spoken.    \"Can I do anything?\" Mary asked, presently, as a wave struck the  stern, and threw a mass of water into the boat.    \"Yes,\" John replied; \"take that earthen pot, and bale out the  water.\"    John had no great hope that they would live through the gale, but  he thought it better for the girl to be kept busily employed. She  bailed steadily but, fast as she worked, the water came in faster;  for each wave, as it swept past them, broke on board. So rapidly  were they traveling that John had the greatest difficulty in  keeping the boat from broaching to--in which case the following  wave would have filled, or overturned, her.    \"I don't think it's any use, John,\" Mary said, quietly, as a great  wave broke on board; pouring in as much water, in a second, as she  could have baled out in ten minutes.    \"No use, dear. Sit quietly by me but, first, pull those oars aft.  Now, tie them together with that piece of rope. Now, when the boat  goes down, keep tight hold of them.    \"Cut off another piece of rope, and give it me. When we are in the  water, I will fasten you to the oars. They will keep you afloat,  easily enough. I will keep close to you. You know I am a good  swimmer and, whenever I feel tired, I can rest my hands on the  oars, too.    \"Keep up your courage, and keep as quiet as you can. These sudden  storms seldom last long; and my father will be sure to get the  boats out, as soon as he can, to look for us.\"    John spoke cheerfully, but he had no great hopes of their being  able to live in so rough a sea. Mary had still less, but she  quietly carried out John's instructions. The boat was half-full of  water, now, and rose but heavily upon the waves.    John raised himself and looked round; in hopes that the wind might,  unnoticed, have shifted a little and blown them towards the shore.  As he glanced around, him he gave a shout. Following almost in  their track, and some fifty yards away, was a large galley; running  before the wind, with a rag of sail set on its mast.    \"We are saved, Mary!\" he exclaimed. \"Here is a galley, close to  us.\"    He shouted loudly, though he knew that his voice could not be  heard, many yards away, in the teeth of the gale but, almost  directly, he saw two or three men stand up in the bow of the  galley. One was pointing towards them, and he saw that they were  seen.    In another minute the galley came sweeping along, close to the  boat. A dozen figures appeared over her side, and two or three  ropes were thrown. John caught one, twisted it rapidly round Mary's  body and his own, knotted it and, taking her in his arms, jumped  overboard. Another minute they were drawn alongside the galley, and  pulled on board. As soon as the ropes were unfastened, John rose to  his feet; but Mary lay, insensible, on the deck.    \"Carry the damsel into the cabin,\" a man, who was evidently in  authority said. \"She has fainted, but will soon come round. I will  see to her, myself.\"    The suddenness of the rescue, the plunge in the water, and the  sudden revulsion of his feelings affected John so much that it was  two or three minutes before he could speak.    \"Come along with me, lad,\" one of the sailors said, laying his hand  on his shoulder. \"Some dry clothes, and a draught of wine will set  you all right again; but you have had a narrow escape of it. That  boat of yours was pretty nearly water logged and, in another five  minutes, we should have been too late.\"    John hastily changed his clothes in the forecastle, took a draught  of wine, and then hurried back again towards the aft cabin. Just as  he reached it, the man who had ordered Mary to be carried in came  out.    \"The damsel has opened her eyes,\" he said, \"and you need not be  uneasy about her. I have given her some woolen cloths, and bade her  take off her wet garments, and wrap herself in them.    \"Why did you not make for the shore, before the tempest broke? It  was foolish of you, indeed, to be out on the lake, when anyone  could see that this gale was coming.\"    \"I was rowing down, and did not notice it until I turned,\" John  replied. \"I was making for the shore, when the gale struck her.\"    \"It was well, for you, that I noticed you. I was, myself, thinking  of making for the shore although, in so large and well-manned craft  as this, there is little fear upon the lake. It is not like the  Great Sea; where I, myself, have seen a large ship as helpless,  before the waves, as that small boat we picked you from.    \"I had just set out from Tiberias, when I marked the storm coming  up; but my business was urgent and, moreover, I marked your little  boat, and saw that you were not likely to gain the shore; so I bade  the helmsman keep his eye on you, until the darkness fell upon us;  and then to follow straight in your wake, for you could but run  before the wind--and well he did it for, when we first caught sight  of you, you were right ahead of us.\"    The speaker was a man of about thirty years of age; tall, and with  a certain air of command.    \"I thank you, indeed, sir,\" John said, \"for saving my life; and  that of my cousin Mary, the daughter of my father's brother. Truly,  my father and mother will be grateful to you, for having saved us;  for I am their only son.    \"Whom are they to thank for our rescue?\"    \"I am Joseph, the son of Matthias, to whom the Jews have intrusted  the governorship of this province.\"    \"Josephus!\" John exclaimed, in a tone of surprise and reverence.    \"So men call me,\" Josephus replied, with a smile.    It was, indeed, the governor. Flavius Josephus, as the Romans  afterwards called him, came of a noble Jewish family--his father,  Matthias, belonging to the highest of the twenty-four classes into  which the sacerdotal families were divided. Matthias was eminent"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21615"],[0,"Curiosities of Literature, Vol. 1 (#5)"],[1,"he was a popular writer, and made belles-lettres charming to the  multitude.    It was during the ten years that now occurred that he mainly acquired  that store of facts which were the foundation of his future  speculations. His pen was never idle, but it was to note and to  register, not to compose. His researches were prosecuted every morning  among the MSS. of the British Museum, while his own ample collections  permitted him to pursue his investigation in his own library into the  night. The materials which he accumulated during this period are only  partially exhausted. At the end of ten years, during which, with the  exception of one anonymous work, he never indulged in composition, the  irresistible desire of communicating his conclusions to the world came  over him, and after all his almost childish aspirations, his youth of  reverie and hesitating and imperfect effort, he arrived at the mature  age of forty-five before his career as a great author, influencing  opinion, really commenced.    The next ten years passed entirely in production: from 1812 to 1822 the  press abounded with his works. His \"Calamities of Authors,\" his \"Memoirs  of Literary Controversy,\" in the manner of Bayle; his \"Essay on the  Literary Character,\" the most perfect of his compositions; were all  chapters in that History of English Literature which he then commenced  to meditate, and which it was fated should never be completed.    It was during this period also that he published his \"Inquiry into the  Literary and Political Character of James the First,\" in which he first  opened those views respecting the times and the conduct of the Stuarts,  which were opposed to the long prevalent opinions of this country, but  which with him were at least the result of unprejudiced research, and  their promulgation, as he himself expressed it, \"an affair of literary  conscience.\"[3]    But what retarded his project of a History of our Literature at this  time was the almost embarrassing success of his juvenile production,  \"The Curiosities of Literature.\" These two volumes had already reached  five editions, and their author found himself, by the public demand,  again called upon to sanction their re-appearance. Recognising in this  circumstance some proof of their utility, he resolved to make the work  more worthy of the favour which it enjoyed, and more calculated to  produce the benefit which he desired. Without attempting materially to  alter the character of the first two volumes, he revised and enriched  them, while at the same time he added a third volume of a vein far more  critical, and conveying the results of much original research. The  success of this publication was so great, that its author, after much  hesitation, resolved, as he was wont to say, to take advantage of a  popular title, and pour forth the treasures of his mind in three  additional volumes, which, unlike continuations in general, were at once  greeted with the highest degree of popular delight and esteem. And,  indeed, whether we consider the choice variety of the subjects, the  critical and philosophical speculation which pervades them, the amount  of new and interesting information brought to bear, and the animated  style in which all is conveyed, it is difficult to conceive  miscellaneous literature in a garb more stimulating and attractive.  These six volumes, after many editions, are now condensed into the form  at present given to the public, and in which the development of the  writer's mind for a quarter of a century may be completely traced.    Although my father had on the whole little cause to complain of unfair  criticism, especially considering how isolated he always remained, it is  not to be supposed that a success so eminent should have been exempt in  so long a course from some captious comments. It has been alleged of  late years by some critics, that he was in the habit of exaggerating the  importance of his researches; that he was too fond of styling every  accession to our knowledge, however slight, as a discovery; that there  were some inaccuracies in his early volumes (not very wonderful in so  multifarious a work), and that the foundation of his \"secret history\"  was often only a single letter, or a passage in a solitary diary.    The sources of secret history at the present day are so rich and  various; there is such an eagerness among their possessors to publish  family papers, even sometimes in shapes, and at dates so recent, as  scarcely to justify their appearance; that modern critics, in their  embarrassment of manuscript wealth, are apt to view with too  depreciating an eye the more limited resources of men of letters at the  commencement of the century. Not five-and-twenty years ago, when  preparing his work on King Charles the First, the application of my  father to make some researches in the State Paper Office was refused by  the Secretary of State of the day. Now, foreign potentates and ministers  of State, and public corporations and the heads of great houses, feel  honoured by such appeals, and respond to them with cordiality. It is not  only the State Paper Office of England, but the Archives of France,  that are open to the historical investigator. But what has produced this  general and expanding taste for literary research in the world, and  especially in England? The labours of our elder authors, whose taste and  acuteness taught us the value of the materials which we in our ignorance  neglected. When my father first frequented the reading-room of the  British Museum at the end of the last century, his companions never  numbered half-a-dozen; among them, if I remember rightly, were Mr.  Pinkerton and Mr. Douce. Now these daily pilgrims of research may be  counted by as many hundreds. Few writers have more contributed to form  and diffuse this delightful and profitable taste for research than the  author of the \"Curiosities of Literature;\" few writers have been more  successful in inducing us to pause before we accepted without a scruple  the traditionary opinion that has distorted a fact or calumniated a  character; and independently of every other claim which he possesses to  public respect, his literary discoveries, viewed in relation to the age  and the means, were considerable. But he had other claims: a vital  spirit in his page, kindred with the souls of a Bayle and a Montaigne.  His innumerable imitators and their inevitable failure for half a  century alone prove this, and might have made them suspect that there  were some ingredients in the spell besides the accumulation of facts and  a happy title. Many of their publications, perpetually appearing and  constantly forgotten, were drawn up by persons of considerable  acquirements, and were ludicrously mimetic of their prototype, even as  to the size of the volume and the form of the page. What has become of  these \"Varieties of Literature,\" and \"Delights of Literature,\" and  \"Delicacies of Literature,\" and \"Relics of Literature,\"--and the other  Protean forms of uninspired compilation? Dead as they deserve to be:  while the work, the idea of which occurred to its writer in his early  youth, and which he lived virtually to execute in all the ripeness of  his studious manhood, remains as fresh and popular as ever,--the  Literary Miscellany of the English People.    I have ventured to enter into some details as to the earlier and  obscurer years of my father's life, because I thought that they threw  light upon human character, and that without them, indeed, a just  appreciation of his career could hardly be formed. I am mistaken, if we  do not recognise in his instance two very interesting qualities of life:  predisposition and self-formation. There was a third, which I think is  to be honoured, and that was his sympathy with his order. No one has  written so much about authors, and so well. Indeed, before his time, the  Literary Character had never been fairly placed before the world. He  comprehended its idiosyncrasy: all its strength and all its weakness. He  could soften, because he could explain, its infirmities; in the analysis  and record of its power, he vindicated the right position of authors in  the social scale. They stand between the governors and the governed, he  impresses on us in the closing pages of his greatest work.[4] Though he  shared none of the calamities, and scarcely any of the controversies, of  literature, no one has sympathised so intimately with the sorrows, or so  zealously and impartially registered the instructive disputes, of  literary men. He loved to celebrate the exploits of great writers, and  to show that, in these ages, the pen is a weapon as puissant as the  sword. He was also the first writer who vindicated the position of the  great artist in the history of genius. His pages are studded with  pregnant instances and graceful details, borrowed from the life of Art  and its votaries, and which his intimate and curious acquaintance with  Italian letters readily and happily supplied. Above all writers, he has  maintained the greatness of intellect, and the immortality of thought.    He was himself a complete literary character, a man who really passed  his life in his library. Even marriage produced no change in these  habits; he rose to enter the chamber where he lived alone with his  books, and at night his lamp was ever lit within the same walls.  Nothing, indeed, was more remarkable than the isolation of this  prolonged existence; and it could only be accounted for by the united  influence of three causes: his birth, which brought him no relations or  family acquaintance; the bent of his disposition; and the circumstance  of his inheriting an independent fortune, which rendered unnecessary  those exertions that would have broken up his self-reliance. He disliked  business, and he never required relaxation; he was absorbed in his  pursuits. In London his only amusement was to ramble among booksellers;  if he"]]]
