[Illustration: THE ERECHTHEUM.]    To stand at the eastern wall of the Acropolis, and gaze on the  Parthenon, robed in the rich colors by which time has added an almost  voluptuous beauty to its perfect proportions--to behold between its  columns the blue mountains of the Morea, and the bluer seas of Egina and  Salamis, with acanthus-covered or icy-wedded fragments of majestic  friezes, and mighty capitals at your feet--the sky of Greece, flooded by  the gorgeous hues of sunset, above your head--Mr. Cook describes as one  of the highest enjoyments the world can offer to a man of taste. He is  opposed to the projects of its restoration, and says that, \"to real  lovers of the picturesque, the Parthenon as it now stands--a ruin in  every sense of the term, its walls destroyed, its columns shivered, its  friezes scattered, its capitals half-buried by their own weight, but  clear of all else--is, if not a grander, assuredly a more impressive  object than when, in the palmiest days of Athenian glory, its marble,  pure as the unfallen snow, first met the rays of the morning sun, and  excited the reverential admiration of the assembled multitudes.\"    On the northeast side of the Parthenon stood the Erechtheum, a temple  dedicated to the joint worship of Neptune and Minerva. There are  considerable remains of this building, particularly those beautiful  female figures called Caryatides, which support, instead of columns,  three of the porticoes; besides three of the columns in the north  hexastyle with the roof over these last columns, the rest of the roof of  this graceful portico fell during the siege of Athens, in 1827. Lately,  much has been done in the way of excavation; the buried base of this  tripartite temple has been cleared; the walls, which had been built to  make it habitable, have been removed; the abducted Caryatid replaced by  a modern copy, the gift of Lord Guildford, and the whole prepared for a  projected restoration.    The Temple of Victory without wings, already mentioned is, with the  exception of the pavement, entirely a restoration; for nearly two  centuries all trace of it was lost, all mention omitted. In removing one  of the Turkish batteries, in order to clear the entrance to the  Propylaea, some fragments were found which led to a more minute  investigation; and, after a short time, the foundation, the pavement,  and even the bases of some of the columns were disinterred, making its  reconstruction not only very easy, but extremely satisfactory. It is  small, but of exquisite proportions, and now perfect, with the exception  of a portion of the frieze, which is in the British Museum. A  peculiarity of this temple is, that it stands at an angle slightly  differing from that of the Propylaea itself,--a fact for which, as it  clearly formed one of the chief ornaments to, and was certainly built  after, this noble portico, it is difficult to assign any very good  reason.    Such is an outline of the chief buildings of the Acropolis, which, in  its best days, had four distinct characters: being at once the fortress,  the sacred inclosure, the treasury, and the museum of art, of the  Athenian nation. It was an entire offering to the deity, unrivalled in  richness and splendor; it was the peerless gem of Greece, the glory and  the pride of genius, the wonder and envy of the world.    Beneath the southern wall of the Acropolis, near its extremity, was  situated the Athenian or Dionysiac theatre. Its seats, rising one above  another, were cut of the sloping rock. Of these, only the two highest  rows are now visible, the rest being concealed by an accumulation of  soil, the removal of which would probably bring to light the whole shell  of the theatre. Plato affirms it was capable of containing thirty  thousand persons. It contained statues of all the great tragic and comic  poets, the most conspicuous of which were naturally those of AEschylus,  Sophocles, and Euripides, among the former, and those of Aristophanes  and Menander among the latter. On the southwest side of the Acropolis is  the site of the Odeum, or musical theatre of Herodes Atticus, named by  him the theatre of Regilla, in honor of his wife. On the northeast side  of the Acropolis stood the Prytaneum, where citizens who had rendered  services to the state were maintained at the public expense. Extending  southwards from the site of the Prytaneum, ran the street to which  Pausanias gave the name of Tripods, from its containing a number of  small temples or edifices crowned with tripods, to commemorate the  triumphs gained by the Choragi in the theatre of Bacchus. Opposite to  the west end of the Acropolis is the Areopagus, or hill of Mars, on the  eastern extremity of which was situated the celebrated court of the  Areopagus. This point is reached by means of sixteen stone steps cut in  the rock, immediately above which is a bench of stone, forming three  sides of a quadrangle, like a triclinium, generally supposed to have  been the tribunal. The ruins of a small chapel consecrated to St.  Dionysius the Areopagite, and commemorating his conversion by St. Paul,  are here visible. About a quarter of a mile southwest from the centre of  the Areopagus stands Pnyx, the place provided for the public assemblies  at Athens in its palmy days. The steps by which the speaker mounted the  rostrum, and a tier of three seats hewn in the solid rock for the  audience, are still visible. This is perhaps the most interesting spot  in Athens to the lovers of Grecian genius, being associated with the  renown of Demosthenes, and the other famed Athenian orators,                  \"whose resistless eloquence      Wielded at will that fierce democratie,      Shook the arsenal and fulmined over Greece,      To Macedon, and Artaxerxes' throne.\"    [Illustration: THE ARCH OF HADRIAN.]    Descending the Acropolis, the eye is at once arrested by the magnificent  remains of the temple of Jupiter Olympus, and by the Arch of Hadrian.  Whether from its proximity to the gorgeous monument first named, or that  it is intrinsically deficient in that species of merit which appeals  directly to the senses, the Arch of Hadrian attracts comparatively  little notice. It is, however, a highly interesting monument, bearing  unmistakable marks of the decline of art; yet distinguished for much of  that quality of beauty which gives so peculiar a character to the  architecture of the Greeks. The inscriptions on the sides of the  entablature have given rise to much learned discussion, and have led to  a far more lucid arrangement of the city and its chief ornaments, than  would in all probability have been accomplished, had not inquiry and  investigation been spurred on by the difficulty of comprehending their  exact meaning. [Illustration: TEMPLE OF JUPITER OLYMPUS.]    [Illustration: ANOTHER VIEW OF THE TEMPLE OF JUPITER OLYMPUS.]    Of two views of the temple of Jupiter Olympus, Mr. Cook chose that in  which the Acropolis is seen in the distance. The three lofty Corinthian  columns in the other engraving are diminished to the scale of the arch,  while the Acropolis, from its greater complexity of parts, adds,  perhaps, something of a quality in which the subject is rather wanting.  \"I am not sure,\" says Mr. Cook, \"that the remains of the temple of  Jupiter Olympus are not the most impressive which Athens offers to the  eye and heart of the traveller, partly from their abstract grandeur--a  grandeur derived from every element which could contribute to such an  end--and partly from a position than which it would be impossible to  conceive any thing more magnificent. The gigantic columns struck me with  a sense of awe and bewilderment, almost oppressive; they consist, as may  be seen by the engraving, of sixteen, the sole representatives of the  one hundred and twenty which once formed this mightiest of Athenian  temples. The least thoughtful person could scarcely avoid the question  of where and how the remaining one hundred and four of these enormous  masses can have vanished; and assisted by the fullest information which  is to be acquired on the subject, it remains a matter of wonder to all.  That time itself has had but little to answer for, the almost perfect  preservation of portions is sufficient to prove; in some cases the  flutings are as sharp and clean as when the hand of the sculptor left  them, while, more generally, they bear disgraceful evidence of ill-usage  of every kind, from that of the cannon ball to the petty mischief of  wanton idleness. The proportion of these columns is quite perfect, and  the mind is lost in charmed wonder, as wandering from part to part of  the vast platform, it is presented at every step with combinations  perpetually changing, yet always beautiful. So difficult do I find it to  determine from what point of view these ruins are seen to the greatest  advantage, that I have appended two engravings, from which the reader  may select that which best conveys to him the magnificence of the  structure which has been thus slightly described.\" The temple of Jupiter  Olympus was one of the first conceived, and the last executed of the  sacred monuments of Athens. It was begun by Pisistratus, but not  finished till the time of the Roman emperor Adrian, seven hundred years  afterwards.    [Illustration: MONUMENT OF LYSICRATES.]    A proof of the varied character of the Athenian architectural genius may  be found in the exquisite model, the lantern of Demosthenes, or, as it  is more properly called, the Choragic monument of Lysierates. It is, in  common with the greater number of the remains of which we speak, of  Pentelic marble. By whomever conceived, designed, or executed, this must  have been a labor of love, and the result is such as might be  anticipated from the consequent development of the highest powers of one  to whom a people like"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2096"],[0,"A Smaller History of Greece: from the Earliest Times to the Roman Conquest (#5)"],[1," ambitious woman offered  to destroy the child, if Lycurgus would share the throne with her.  Lycurgus pretended to consent; but as soon as she had given birth to a  son, he presented him in the market-place as the future king of Sparta.  The young king's mother took revenge upon Lycurgus by accusing him of  entertaining designs against his nephew's life.  Hereupon he resolved  to withdraw from his native country and to visit foreign lands.  He was  absent many years, and is said to have employed his time in studying  the institutions of other nations, in order to devise a system of laws  and regulations which might deliver Sparta from the evils under which  it had long been suffering.  During his absence the young king had  grown up, and assumed the reins of government; but the disorders of the  state had meantime become worse than ever, and all parties longed for a  termination to their present sufferings.  Accordingly the return of  Lycurgus was hailed with delight, and he found the people both ready  and willing to submit to an entire change in their government and  institutions.  He now set himself to work to carry his long projected  reforms into effect; but before he commenced his arduous task he  consulted the Delphian oracle, from which he received strong assurances  of divine support.  Thus encouraged by the god, he suddenly presented  himself in the market-place, surrounded by thirty of the most  distinguished Spartans in arms.  His reforms were not carried into  effect without violent opposition, and in one of the tumults which they  excited, his eye is said to have been struck out by a passionate youth.  But he finally triumphed over all obstacles, and succeeded in obtaining  the submission of all classes in the community to his new constitution.  His last act was to sacrifice himself for the welfare of his country.  Having obtained from the people a solemn oath to make no alterations in  his laws before his return, he quitted Sparta for ever.  He set out on  a journey to Delphi, where he obtained an oracle from the god,  approving of all he had done, and promising prosperity to the Spartans  as long as they preserved his laws.  Whither he went afterwards, and  how and where he died, nobody could tell.  He vanished from earth like  a god, leaving no traces behind him but his spirit:  and his grateful  countrymen honoured him with a temple, and worshipped him with annual  sacrifices down to the latest times.    The population of Laconia was divided into the three classes of  Spartans, Perioeci and Helots.    I. The SPARTANS were the descendants of the leading Dorian  conquerors.  They formed the sovereign power of the state, and they  alone were eligible to honours and public offices.  They lived in  Sparta itself and were all subject to the discipline of Lycurgus.  They  were divided into three tribes,--the HYLLEIS, the PAMPHILI, and the  DYMANES,--which were not, however, peculiar to Sparta, but existed in  all the Dorian states.    II. The PERIOECI were personally free, but politically subject  to the Spartans.  [This word signifies literally DWELLERS AROUND THE  CITY, and was generally used to indicate the inhabitants in the country  districts, who possessed inferior political privileges to the citizens  who lived in the city.]  They possessed no share in the government, and  were bound to obey the commands of the Spartan magistrates.  They  appear to have been the descendants of the old Achaean population of  the country, and they were distributed into a hundred townships, which  were spread through the whole of Laconia.    III. The HELOTS were serfs bound to the soil, which they tilled  for the benefit of the Spartan proprietors.  Their condition was very  different from that of the ordinary slaves in antiquity, and more  similar to the villanage of the middle ages.  They lived in the rural  villages, as the Perioeci did in the towns, cultivating the lands and  paying over the rent to their masters in Sparta, but enjoying their  homes, wives, and families, apart from their master's personal  superintendence.  They appear to have been never sold, and they  accompanied the Spartans to the field as light armed troops.  But while  their condition was in these respects superior to that of the ordinary  slaves in other parts of Greece, it was embittered by the fact that  they were not strangers like the latter, but were of the same race and  spoke the same language as their masters, being probably the  descendants of the old inhabitants, who had offered the most obstinate  resistance to the Dorians, and had therefore been reduced to slavery.  As their numbers increased, they became objects of suspicion to their  masters, and were subjected to the most wanton and oppressive cruelty.    The functions of the Spartan government were distributed among two  kings, a senate of thirty members, a popular assembly, and an executive  directory of five men called the Ephors.    At the head of the state were the two hereditary kings.  The existence  of a pair of kings was peculiar to Sparta, and is said to have arisen  from the accidental circumstance of Aristodemus having left twin sons,  Eurysthenes and Procles.  This division of the royal power naturally  tended to weaken its influence and to produce jealousies and  dissensions between the two kings.  The royal power was on the decline  during the whole historical period, and the authority of the kings was  gradually usurped by the Ephors, who at length obtained the entire  control of the government, and reduced the kings to a state of  humiliation and dependence.    The Senate, called GERUSIA, or the COUNCIL OF ELDERS, consisted of  thirty members, among whom the two kings were included.  They were  obliged to be upwards of sixty years of age, and they held their office  for life.  They possessed considerable power and were the only real  check upon the authority of the Ephors.  They discussed and prepared  all measures which were to be brought before the popular assembly, and  they had some share in the general administration of the state.  But  the most important of their functions was, that they were judges in all  criminal cases affecting the life of a Spartan citizen.    The Popular Assembly was of little importance, and appears to have been  usually summoned only as a matter of form for the election of certain  magistrates, for passing laws, and for determining upon peace and war.  It would appear that open discussion was not allowed and that the  assembly rarely came to a division.    The Ephors were of later origin, and did not exist in the original  constitution of Lycurgus.  They may be regarded as the representatives  of the popular assembly.  They were elected annually from the general  body of Spartan citizens, and seem to have been originally appointed to  protect the interests and liberties of the people against the  encroachments of the kings and the senate.  They correspond in many  respects to the tribunes of the people at Rome.  Their functions were  at first limited and of small importance; but in the end the whole  political power became centred in their hands.    The Spartan government was in reality a close oligarchy, in which the  kings and the senate, as well as the people, were alike subject to the  irresponsible authority of the five Ephors.    The most important part of the legislation of Lycurgus did not relate  to the political constitution of Sparta, but to the discipline and  education of the citizens.  It was these which gave Sparta her peculiar  character, and distinguished her in so striking a manner from all the  other states of Greece.  The position of the Spartans, surrounded by  numerous enemies, whom they held in subjection by the sword alone,  compelled them to be a nation of soldiers.  Lycurgus determined that  they should be nothing else; and the great object of his whole system  was to cultivate a martial spirit, and to give them a training which  would make them invincible in battle.  To accomplish this the education  of a Spartan was placed under the control of the state from his  earliest boyhood.  Every child after birth was exhibited to public  view, and, if deemed deformed and weakly, was exposed to perish on  Mount Taygetus.  At the age of seven he was taken from his mother's  care, and handed over to the public classes. He was not only taught  gymnastic games and military exercises but he was also subjected to  severe bodily discipline, and was compelled to submit to hardships and  suffering without repining or complaint.  One of the tests to which he  was subjected was a cruel scourging at the altar of Artemis (Diana),  until his blood gushed forth and covered the altar of the goddess.  It  was inflicted publicly before the eyes of his parents and in the  presence of the whole city; and many Spartan youths were known to have  died under the lash without uttering a complaining murmur. No means  were neglected to prepare them for the hardships and stratagems of war.  They were obliged to wear the same garment winter and summer, and to  endure hunger and thirst, heat and cold.  They were purposely allowed  an insufficient quantity of food, but were permitted to make up the  deficiency by hunting in the woods and mountains of Laconia.  They were  even encouraged to steal whatever they could; but if they were caught  in the fact, they were severely punished for their want of dexterity.  Plutarch tells us of a boy, who, having stolen a fox, and hid it under  his garment, chose rather to let it tear out his very bowels than be  detected in the theft.    The literary education of a Spartan youth was of a most restricted  kind.  He was taught to despise literature as unworthy of a warrior,  while the study of eloquence and philosophy, which were cultivated at  Athens with such extraordinary success, was regarded at Sparta with  contempt.  Long speeches were a Spartan's abhorrence, and he was  trained to express"]]]
