It has often been observed that this phrase seems       Egyptian   on  the face of it, and it certainly recalls such       forms of expression as the following, taken from a formula       frequently found on funerary \"All things created by heaven,       given by earth, _brought by the Nile--from its mysterious       sources._\" Nevertheless, up to the present time, the       hieroglyphic texts have yielded nothing altogether       corresponding to the exact terms of the Greek historians--       _gift_ of the Nile, or its natural _product_.    A long low, level shore, scarcely rising above the sea, a chain of  vaguely defined and ever-shifting lakes and marshes, then the triangular  plain beyond, whose apex is thrust thirty leagues into the land--this,  the Delta of Egypt, has gradually been acquired from the sea, and is  as it were the gift of the Nile. The Mediterranean once reached to the  foot of the sandy plateau on which stand the Pyramids, and formed a  wide gulf where now stretches plain beyond plain of the Delta. The  last undulations of the Arabian hills, from Gebel Mokattam to Gebel  Geneffeh, were its boundaries on the east, while a sinuous and shallow  channel running between Africa and Asia united the Mediterranean to  the Red Sea. Westward, the littoral followed closely the contour of the  Libyan plateau; but a long limestone spur broke away from it at about  31 deg. N., and terminated in Cape Abukir. The alluvial deposits first  tilled up the depths of the bay, and then, under the influence of the  currents which swept along its eastern coasts, accumulated behind that  rampart of sand-hills whose remains are still to be seen near Benha.  Thus was formed a miniature Delta, whose structure pretty accurately  corresponded with that of the great Delta of to-day. Here the Nile  divided into three divergent streams, roughly coinciding with the  southern courses of the Rosetta and Damietta branches, and with the  modern canal of Abu Meneggeh. The ceaseless accumulation of mud brought  down by the river soon overpassed the first limits, and steadily  encroached upon the sea until it was carried beyond the shelter  furnished by Cape Abukir. Thence it was gathered into the great littoral  current flowing from Africa to Asia, and formed an incurvated coast-line  ending in the headland of Casios, on the Syrian frontier. From that time  Egypt made no further increase towards the north, and her coast remains  practically such as it was thousands of years ago:[*] the interior  alone has suffered change, having been dried up, hardened, and gradually  raised. Its inhabitants thought they could measure the exact length of  time in which this work of creation had been accomplished. According  to the Egyptians, Menes, the first of their mortal kings, had found, so  they said, the valley under water. The sea came in almost as far as the  Fayum, and, excepting the province of Thebes, the whole country was  a pestilential swamp. Hence, the necessary period for the physical  formation of Egypt would cover some centuries after Menes. This is  no longer considered a sufficient length of time, and some modern  geologists declare that the Nile must have worked at the formation of  its own estuary for at least seventy-four thousand years.[**]         * Elie de Beaumont, \"The great distinction of the Nile Delta       lies in the almost uniform persistence of its coast-line....       The present sea-coast of Egypt is little altered from that       of three thousand years  ago.\"    The latest observations       prove it to be sinking and shrinking near Alexandria to rise       in the neighbourhood of Port Said.         ** Others, as for example Schweinfurth, are  more  moderate       in their views, and think \"that it must have taken about       twenty thousand years for that alluvial deposit which now       forms  the   arable soil of Egypt to have attained to its       present depth and fertility.\"    This figure is certainly exaggerated, for the alluvium would gain on  the shallows of the ancient gulf far more rapidly than it gains upon the  depths of the Mediterranean. But even though we reduce the period, we  must still admit that the Egyptians little suspected the true age of  their country. Not only did the Delta long precede the coming of Menes,  but its plan was entirely completed before the first arrival of the  Egyptians. The Greeks, full of the mysterious virtues which they  attributed to numbers, discovered that there were seven principal  branches, and seven mouths of the Nile, and that, as compared with  these, the rest were but false mouths.    [Illustration: 006.jpg THE MOUTH OF THE NILE PREVIOUS TO THE FORMATION  OF THE DELTA.]    As a matter of fact, there were only three chief outlets.    The Canopic  branch flowed westward, and fell into the Mediterranean near Cape  Abukir, at the western extremity of the arc described by the coast-line.  The Pelusiac branch followed the length of the Arabian chain, and flowed  forth at the other extremity; and the Sebennytic stream almost bisected  the triangle contained between the Canopic and Pelusiac channels. Two  thousand years ago, these branches separated from the main river at  the  city of Cerkasoros, nearly four  miles north of the site where Cairo now  stands. But after the Pelusiac branch had ceased to exist, the fork of  the river gradually wore away the land from age to age, and is now some  nine miles lower down.[*] These three great waterways are united by a  network of artificial rivers and canals, and by ditches--some natural,  others dug by the hand of man, but all ceaselessly shifting. They silt  up, close, open again, replace each other, and ramify in innumerable  branches over the surface of the soil, spreading life and fertility on  all sides. As the land rises towards the south, this web contracts and  is less confused, while black mould and cultivation alike dwindle, and  the fawn-coloured line of the desert comes into sight. The Libyan and  Arabian hills appear above the plain, draw nearer to each other, and  gradually shut in the horizon until it seems as though they would unite.  And there the Delta ends, and Egypt proper has begun.    It is only a strip of vegetable mould stretching north and south between  regions of drought and desolation, a prolonged oasis on the banks of the  river, made by the Nile, and sustained by the Nile. The whole length of  the land is shut in between two ranges of hills, roughly parallel at a  mean distance of about twelve miles.[**]         * By the end of the Byzantine period, the fork of the river       lay at some distance south of Shetnufi, the present       Shatanuf, which is the spot where it now is.

In order to clear the way for the  examination of the investigations, the records of which we have  carefully collected, let us consider first those which General  Pleasonton quotes in support of his views. These are (1) Seunebier's  researches, which go to show that the blue and violet rays are the  most active in determining the decomposition of carbonic acid in  plants, and (2) experiments of Dr. Morichini, repeated by Carpa and  Ridolfi, proving that violet rays magnetized a small needle. The first  statement has been totally disproved. Dr. Von Bezold, in his recent  work on color, states that \"the chemical processes in plants, as far  as they are dependent upon light, are principally caused by the rays  of medium and of lower refrangibility. The development of the green  color of the chlorophyll, the decomposition of carbonic acid, as well  as the formation of starch, etc., in the grains of the chlorophyll,  are induced by the red, green, and orange rays.\" The blue, violet, and  ultra violet rays, the same authority goes onto explain, influence  \"the rapidity of growth, compel the so-called zooespores to move in  certain directions, and alter the positions of leaves, etc.\" In  confirmation of this, we have Sach's experiments in 1872, which show  that light, transmitted through the yellow solution of potassium  chromate, enables green leaves to decompose over 88 per cent. of  carbonic acid; while that passed through blue ammonia copper oxide  decomposes less than 8 per cent. This proves the superiority of the  yellow ray to decompose carbonic acid; and this fact Professor J.W.  Draper discovered a long time ago by the direct use of the spectrum.  In still further confirmation, we may cite the investigations of  Vogel, Pfeiffer, Selim, and Placentim. The last three have conducted  researches in full knowledge of those of General Pleasonton, and their  experiments show that yellow rays are more promotive of the evolution  of carbon in animals and its absorption in plants than any others in  the spectrum, the violet rays having least power in these respects,  with the exception of the red rays in the case of animals. The  absorption of carbonic acid by plants, and its evolution by animals,  we hardly need add, are prime essentials to the growth and health of  each. The notion that light possesses a magnetizing power on steel was  upset by Niepce de St. Victor in 1861. After removing every source of  error, he \"found it impossible to make one sewing needle, solarized  for a very long time under the rays of light concentrated by a strong  lens, attract another suspended by a hair, whether the light was white  or colored by being made to pass through a violet-colored glass.\"    We can proceed further and even show that violet light is in some  respects hurtful to plants. Cailletet, for example, says in 1868 that  \"light which was passed through a solution of iodine in carbonic  disulphide prevents decomposition altogether.\" Baudrimont says that  \"no colored light permits vegetables to go through all the phases of  their evolutions. Violet-colored light is positively injurious to  plants; they absolutely require white light.\" This scientist  instituted the most elaborate experiments on the subject, ranging over  11 years, from 1850 to 1861; and the result of all his labor may be  summed up in the simple statement that no illumination which human  ingenuity can devise is so well adapted for promoting natural  processes as the pure white light provided by the Creator. So much by  way of general denial of the claims of superior efficacy residing in  blue light of any kind.    Now we have yet to examine the peculiar variety of blue light here  used. Sunlight can, by means of the prism, be split into colored rays,  any one of which we may isolate, and so obtain a certain colored  light. Similarly we may obtain light of a desired color by the use of  a colored glass which will stop out the rays not of the hue required.  So that we may obtain violet light from the spectrum or by filtering  sunlight through violet glass. When, however, Dr. Von Bezold, as  above, asserts that the violet rays have such and such an effect, he  means the violet of the spectrum, which has its specific duty to  perform in the compound light of which it is a necessary portion. But  the violet light of the spectrum and filtered violet sunlight are  altogether different things. The first, as our valued contributor Dr.  Van der Weyde has very clearly pointed out, is \"a homogeneous color  containing, besides the luminous, the invisible chemical rays without  any caloric rays; while the light colored by passing through violet  glass is a mixture of blue rays with the red rays at the other end of  the spectrum; and it contains a quantity of the chemical rays  belonging to the blue and the caloric rays belonging to the red. In  fact, violet glass passes a light identical with sunlight, only much  reduced in power, containing but a portion of its caloric, chemical,  and luminous agency: being simply deprived of its strongest rays.\" And  this the spectroscope has clearly demonstrated. Reduced to its  simplest terms, then, the necessary conclusion is that the violet  glass acts purely as a shade for decreasing the intensity of the solar  light. And in the simple fact that it does so serve as a shade lies  the sole virtue (if any there be) of the glass. In 1856, Dr. Daubeny  made experiments on the germination of seeds, and in his report is  this suggestive sentence: \"In a south aspect, indeed, light which had  passed through the ammonia sulphate of copper (blue solution), and  even darkness itself, seemed more favorable than the whole of the  spectrum; but this law did not seem to extend to the case of seeds  placed in a northern aspect where the total amount of light was less  considerable.\"    In our next issue, we shall review the effects of light and darkness  upon the animal organization, and endeavor to account for the curing  of diseases and the production of other phenomena which have been  erroneously ascribed to the influence of the blue filtered sunlight.           *       *       *       *       *          THE WETLI MOUNTAIN RAILROAD AND ITS DISASTROUS TRIAL TRIP.      Among the various means proposed of late years for building lines of  railroad on the steep slopes of mountains, that of M. Wetli, of  Zurich, Switzerland, has attracted considerable attention from  European engineers. We have already laid before our readers the system  of central toothed rails used on the Righi and other mountain roads in  Europe. In the Wetli system, instead of this rail and the pinion on  the vehicle engaging it, there is a drum having a helicoidal thread  which engages with triangular rails. This drum is attached to the  locomotive. The construction will be readily understood from the  illustrations given herewith, which we take from _La Nature_. The  thread on the drum is precisely that which would be formed could a  rail similar to one of the central angular rails be wrapped around it;  so that it always is in contact with the mid rails, and necessarily  prevents any bodily sliding or rolling of the vehicles over the  regular track when the drum is held motionless. The V-shaped mid rails  are securely fastened to horizontal iron ties, which rest on wooden  traverses. The angle of the V is 50 deg.; the distance between any two  traverses is 2.8 feet.    [Illustration: Fig. 1.--THE WETLI MOUNTAIN RAILROAD.]    The locomotive has three coupled axles, on the mid one of which the  drum is attached so as to be raised or lowered to engage the rails at  the will of the engineer: it being possible to cause it to act on the  rails with a pressure of 3.7 tons. The diameter of the drum is 2.14  feet. Its spiral thread is of steel, very solidly attached, and so  made as to grip the rails to a distance of 0.6 inch below the level of  the track. In order to insure this contact, on the drum axle are two  pulleys which run on the exterior road, and of which the diameter  determines the depth of the hold of the threads. These pulleys are  34.7 inches in diameter, while the driving wheels are very slightly in  excess, to provide for the use of tyres.    M. Wetli's invention, as we have described it, was placed between  Woedensweil and Einsiedlen, Switzerland. The difference in altitude  between these points is 1,513 feet, the distance 9.6 miles. The grade  is from 4 to 5 per cent over the first six miles of the way, and  subsequently decreases to 1 per cent. The Wetli railroad was  established last October only on the heavy grade, that is, the first  six miles.    [Illustration: Fig. 2.]    Early in November, trial trips were made which did not prove  satisfactory. Sometimes the drum thread gripped the triangular rails  properly and acted well; again it would wedge itself upon them, and  often would simply roll over their tops without engaging at all. After  the first trials, during which very many of the rails were broken, M.  Welti re-adjusted the drum thread. Finally, he concluded that he had  overcome all difficulties in his apparatus; and accordingly a formal  trial was arranged on November 30. For about four and a half miles of  the ascent the drum worked well; and the hoarfrost, with which the  rails were thickly covered, showed good contact. Afterward it worked  irregularly; but the station of Schindelleghi, a distance of five  miles, was reached without accident, the locomotive dragging a car  loaded with 20 tons of rails. It was then attempted to make the  descent by the aid of the helicoidal drum; but this jumped the rails,  and broke them almost immediately. By the aid of back pressure of  steam and brakes, the locomotive was stopped. Then, unfortunately, the  engine was started again; but hardly had the descent been resumed when  it was"]]]
