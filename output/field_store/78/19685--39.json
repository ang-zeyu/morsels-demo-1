Now this river which ran  by the city, Etearchos conjectured to be the Nile, and moreover reason  compels us to think so; for the Nile flows from Libya and cuts Libya  through in the midst, and as I conjecture, judging of what is not known  by that which is evident to the view, it starts at a distance from its  mouth equal to that of the Ister: for the river Ister begins from the  Keltoi and the city of Pyrene and so runs that it divides Europe in the  midst (now the Keltoi are outside the Pillars of Heracles and border  upon the Kynesians, who dwell furthest towards the sunset of all those  who have their dwelling in Europe): and the Ister ends, having its  course through the whole of Europe, by flowing into the Euxine Sea at  the place where the Milesians have their settlement of Istria. Now the  Ister, since it flows through land which is inhabited, is known by  the reports of many; but of the sources of the Nile no one can give an  account, for the part of Libya through which it flows is uninhabited and  desert. About its course however so much as it was possible to learn by  the most diligent inquiry has been told; and it runs out into Egypt.  Now Egypt lies nearly opposite to the mountain districts of Kilikia; and  from thence to Sinope, which lies upon the Euxine Sea, is a journey in  the same straight line of five days for a man without encumbrance; and  Sinope lies opposite to the place where the Ister runs out into the sea:  thus I think that the Nile passes through the whole of Libya and is of  equal measure with the Ister.        Of the Nile then let so much suffice as has been said. Of Egypt however  I shall make my report at length, because it has wonders more in number  than any other land, and works too it has to show as much as any land,  which are beyond expression great: for this reason then more shall be  said concerning it.    The Egyptians in agreement with their climate, which is unlike any  other, and with the river, which shows a nature different from all other  rivers, established for themselves manners and customs in a way opposite  to other men in almost all matters: for among them the women frequent  the market and carry on trade, while the men remain at home and weave;  and whereas others weave pushing the woof upwards, the Egyptians push  it downwards: the men carry their burdens upon their heads and the  women upon their shoulders: the women make water standing up and the  men crouching down: they ease themselves in their houses and they eat  without in the streets, alleging as reason for this that it is right  to do secretly the things that are unseemly though necessary, but those  which are not unseemly, in public: no woman is a minister either of male  or female divinity, but men of all, both male and female: to support  their parents the sons are in no way compelled, if they do not desire  to do so, but the daughters are forced to do so, be they never so  unwilling. The priests of the gods in other lands wear long hair, but  in Egypt they shave their heads: among other men the custom is that in  mourning those whom the matter concerns most nearly have their hair cut  short, but the Egyptians, when deaths occur, let their hair grow long,  both that on the head and that on the chin, having before been close  shaven: other men have their daily living separated from beasts, but the  Egyptians have theirs together with beasts: other men live on wheat and  on barley, but to any one of the Egyptians who makes his living on these  it is a great reproach; they make their bread of maize, which some call  spelt: they knead dough with their feet and clay with their hands, with  which also they gather up dung: and whereas other men, except such as  have learnt otherwise from the Egyptians, have their members as nature  made them, the Egyptians practice circumcision: as to garments, the men  wear two each and the women but one: and whereas others make fast the  rings and ropes of the sails outside the ship, the Egyptians do this  inside: finally in the writing of characters and reckoning with pebbles,  while the Hellenes carry the hand from the left to the right, the  Egyptians do this from the right to the left; and doing so they say that  they do it themselves rightwise and the Hellenes leftwise: and they use  two kinds of characters for writing, of which the one kind is called  sacred and the other common.    They are religious excessively beyond all other men, and with regard to  this they have customs as follows:--they drink from cups of bronze and  rinse them out every day, and not some only do this but all: they wear  garments of linen always newly washed, and this they make a special  point of practice: they circumcise themselves for the sake of  cleanliness, preferring to be clean rather than comely. The priests  shave themselves all over their body every other day, so that no lice or  any other foul thing may come to be upon them when they minister to  the gods; and the priests wear garments of linen only and sandals of  papyrus, and any other garment they may not take nor other sandals;  these wash themselves in cold water twice in a day and twice again in  the night; and other religious services they perform (one may almost  say) of infinite number. They enjoy also good things not a few, for they  do not consume or spend anything of their own substance, but there is  sacred bread baked for them and they have each great quantity of flesh  of oxen and geese coming in to them each day, and also wine of grapes is  given to them; but it is not permitted to them to taste of fish: beans  moreover the Egyptians do not at all sow in their land, and those which  they grow they neither eat raw nor boil for food; nay the priests do not  endure even to look upon them, thinking this to be an unclean kind of  pulse: and there is not one priest only for each of the gods but many,  and of them one is chief-priest, and whenever a priest dies his son is  appointed to his place.    The males of the ox kind they consider to belong to Epaphos, and on  account of him they test them in the following manner:--If the priest  sees one single black hair upon the beast he counts it not clean for  sacrifice; and one of the priests who is appointed for the purpose makes  investigation of these matters, both when the beast is standing upright  and when it is lying on its back, drawing out its tongue moreover, to  see if it is clean in respect of the appointed signs, which I shall tell  of in another part of the history: he looks also at the hairs of the  tail to see if it has them growing in a natural manner; and if it  be clean in respect of all these things, he marks it with a piece of  papyrus, rolling this round the horns, and then when he has plastered  sealing-earth over it he sets upon it the seal of his signet-ring, and  after that they take the animal away. But for one who sacrifices a beast  not sealed the penalty appointed is death. In this way then the beast  is tested; and their appointed manner of sacrifice is as follows:--they  lead the sealed beast to the altar where they happen to be sacrificing,  and then kindle a fire: after that, having poured libations of wine over  the altar so that it runs down upon the victim and having called upon  the god, they cut its throat, and having cut its throat they sever the  head from the body. The body then of the beast they flay, but upon the  head they make many imprecations first, and then they who have a market  and Hellenes sojourning among them for trade, these carry it to the  market-place and sell it, while they who have no Hellenes among them  cast it away into the river: and this is the form of imprecations which  they utter upon the heads, praying that if any evil be about to befall  either themselves who are offering sacrifice or the land of Egypt in  general, it may come rather upon this head. Now as regards the heads of  the beasts which are sacrificed and the pouring over them of the  wine, all the Egyptians have the same customs equally for all their  sacrifices; and by reason of this custom none of the Egyptians eat of  the head either of this or of any other kind of animal: but the manner  of disembowelling the victims and of burning them is appointed among  them differently for different sacrifices; I shall speak however of the  sacrifices to that goddess whom they regard as the greatest of all, and  to whom they celebrate the greatest feast.--When they have flayed the  bullock and made imprecation, they take out the whole of its lower  entrails but leave in the body the upper entrails and the fat; and they  sever from it the legs and the end of the loin and the shoulders and the  neck: and this done, they fill the rest of the body of the animal with  consecrated loaves and honey and raisins and figs and frankincense and  myrrh and every other kind of spices, and having filled it with these  they offer it, pouring over it great abundance of oil. They make their  sacrifice after fasting, and while the offerings are being burnt, they  all beat themselves for mourning, and when they have finished beating  themselves they set forth as a feast that which they left unburnt of the  sacrifice. The clean males then of the ox kind, both full-grown animals  and calves, are sacrificed by all the Egyptians; the females however  they may not sacrifice, but these are sacred to Isis; for the figure of  Isis is in the form of a woman with cow's horns, just as the Hellenes  present Io in pictures, and all the Egyptians without distinction  reverence cows far more than any other kind of cattle; for which reason  neither man nor woman of the Egyptian race would kiss a man who is a  Hellene on the mouth, nor will they use a knife or roasting-spits or  a caldron belonging to a Hellene, nor taste the flesh even of a clean"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21312"],[0,"Glyn Severn's Schooldays (#5)"],[1,"with the other boys through me.\"    \"What do you mean with your `through me'?\" said Glyn.    \"Well, I don't quite know.  It's because I am an Indian, I suppose; and  when they talk to me as they do, and bully me, as you call it, it makes  my heart feel hot and as if I should like to do something strange.  But  I am going to try.  And look here, Glyn,\" said the lad very seriously,  \"I shall begin at once.\"    \"Begin what?\"    \"Trying to make them like me.  I shall make friends with that big fellow  Slegge, and bear it all, and if he goes on again like he did this  morning I have quite made up my mind I won't fight.\"    \"Oh,\" said Glyn drily.  \"Well, come on down the grounds now.  We shall  see.\"        CHAPTER FOUR.    THE ELEPHANT CRIES \"PHOOMP!\"    Plymborough was out in street and road excepting those who lived on the  line of route and had windows that looked down upon the coming  procession, which was to be timed to reach the town, after a long march  from Duncombe, at noon precisely.    Small things please country people, and there was not much work being  done that day.  It was an excuse for a holiday, as eagerly seized upon  by the townsfolk, old and young, as by the young gentlemen of Dr  Bewley's establishment.    But that was not all.  The villages near Plymborough were many, and the  people for miles round flocked into the place to see the procession and  stop afterwards about the market-place to visit the exhibition of beasts  and listen to the band.    The day was gloriously fine, and all promised a famous harvest of  sixpences for the great Ramball himself, a man as punctual in his  appointments as he was in the feeding of his beasts, this being carried  out regularly at certain times, but, unfortunately for the animals, in  uncertain quantities dependent upon the supplies.    Dr Bewley's boys took their places along the forms quite an hour before  noon, this punctuality having something to do with getting the best  places, as they put it, though--as the forms were in a line under the  brick wall, which was low enough with their help for the shortest boy to  see over, and the procession would pass close beneath--it was hard to  see any difference in the positions, or why the form reserved for the  masters was any better than that at the extreme end.    But certainly the masters' form was considered the best from the fact  that it stood first, while the nearest end of the next form was taken up  in spite of his declaration by Slegge, whose greatest admirers got as  close to him as they could or as he would allow.    \"Let's go and stand with them,\" said Singh, as they crossed over to the  wall.    \"Oh, I don't know,\" replied his companion.  \"I vote we go right to the  other end along with the juniors.\"    \"Very well,\" said Singh with a laugh; \"but they'll say it's because  we're afraid.\"    \"Yes,\" replied Glyn coolly; \"but let them.  I don't think we are.\"  And  leading the way, he made for the last form, which they had all to  themselves, and stood there quietly looking down at the crowd below and  along the Duncombe road, which was pretty well lined with people  standing about or seated in cart or chaise waiting for the coming sight.    The masters were not in such a hurry, and they remained in the house  talking together, so that they were not present to see the skylarking  and listen to the banter going on, a good deal of which was set going by  Slegge, who was in a high state of glee, and scattered a great deal of  chaff, to the great delight of his parasites, who eagerly conveyed  insulting messages from their chief to the two new pupils at the other  end of the line--at least, they bore those that were not too offensive;  others that seemed likely to produce some form of resentment from the  lads they attacked were sent on by the youngest boys.    All this palled after a time, and a certain amount of whispering  beginning close at hand, Slegge asked sharply what the whisperers were  talking about, when silence ensued, no one present daring to repeat the  remark which Burney had made, which was to the effect that old Slegge  had said that he was not going to stoop to see the miserable procession,  but all the same he had taken the best place.    The consequence was that Slegge guessed pretty correctly that something  was being whispered dealing with him, and he was just growing fiercely  insistent and threatening what he would do if somebody did not confess,  when the masters came upon the scene and took their places; while  directly after there was a loud cheer, for from out of the distance came  the faintly heard throbbing of a drum.    Everything else was now forgotten.  Eyes and ears were strained, and  minutes elapsed before the pulsations caused by the beating of two balls  upon the tightly stretched skin began to grow nearer, and Mr Rampson  commenced a discussion to fill up the time by throwing quotations from  the old Roman authors at his fellow-tutors and the older boys.    It was a favourable moment for calling a drum a tympanum and giving  descriptions of the different forms, curves, and lengths of the various  trumpets used by the Roman soldiery in their warlike processions, all of  which Slegge voted bosh, and intimated his opinion to the next boy that  old Rampson had better go to the other end of the forms and pour it out  on the two new fellows.    At last, though, the pulsations of the well-belaboured drum came nearer  and were mingled with the mournfully plaintive notes of the wind  instruments being blown by the band, the performers seated in a tall  triumphal car decorated in scarlet and gold, and ornamented by a gilt  carving meant to represent the giant anaconda of South America embracing  and crushing the twenty bandsmen of Ramball's show, gentlemen who, by  the way, wore a richly worsted-embroidered uniform of scarlet baize, the  braid being yellow ochre of the deepest dye.    The carving round the car was either a two-headed anaconda or a  combination of two performing an evolution in twists about the  musicians, tying them up apparently, from the spectators' point of view,  in horrible knots and giving them a terrible aspect of suffering, the  apparent pressure of the serpents' folds causing their faces and cheeks  to swell out in an appalling way, and their eyes to start from their  sockets, while their sufferings seemed to produce wails, shrieks, and  cries for help or mercy, mingled with groans, as the men worked hard  with a perfect battery of old-fashioned key-bugles, supported by  ophicleide and bassoon.    Most painful were the shrieking, strident cries produced by a pair of  clarinets, and altogether there came from out of the knots of the  serpents a hideous chaos of sound, drawn onward by a team of six horses,  and received with wild cheers by the crowd, for it was really the new  triumphal march freshly down from town, but in which the bandsmen were  not perfect as regarded their parts.    \"Is that music or the roarings and cries of some of the beasts?\"  whispered Singh.    There was a burst of laughter from the boys who heard the native remark,  which made Singh turn round upon them angrily; but at a touch from Glyn  he smiled good-humouredly, and then laughed aloud.    \"Well, it was a stupid thing to say,\" he cried.  \"Of course it's the  music.\"    \"I say, Singh,\" burst in Glyn, and he nodded towards the huge drum that  was suspended at the back in the highest part of the car, hung, as it  were, between the curling tails of the two gilt serpents.  \"I say,\" he  cried, \"wouldn't that astonish the people at Dour?  What would they say  to that for a tom-tom?\"    \"Ah!\" cried Singh, \"I'll buy one like that, and take it back with us  when we go home.\"    \"No, I say, don't,\" cried Glyn.  \"They make noise enough there as it  is.\"    \"Noise!\" echoed Singh.  \"They don't call that noise.\"    As they were speaking the great six-horse car rumbled slowly by, with  the drummer beating hard and the buglers and trombonists blowing their  best; while the crowd, taking up the cheer started by the boys, sent it  echoing along towards the main street, where, coming slowly along, and  stretching as far as eye could reach, there was a long line of caravans,  all exceedingly plain and of a uniform yellow colour, with the names of  their contents painted on them in black letters.    The place of honour was given to the king of beasts, for the first of  the cars bore the word \"Lions;\" but probably his majesty was asleep, for  not so much as a muttering purr on a large scale came from the narrow  grating at the top.    Tigers followed; the next car held leopards, each carriage being of the  same uniform level, with the black letters; and, coming slowly after  them, were about two score, kept a good distance apart so as to lengthen  the line as much as possible.    But at first there was nothing else to see, and Singh turned impatiently  to his companion, and said: \"When does the procession begin?\"    \"Why, that's the procession,\" said a small boy close to him, taking the  answer upon himself.  \"The wild beasts are inside.  Didn't you know?\"  And then he proceeded to display his own knowledge.  \"They draw all the  vans up in a square,\" he began excitedly, \"out there in the home-field  behind the `King's Arms,' and then they open the sides of the vans,  which are like great shutters on hinges at the top and bottom, so that  when they are opened one shutter falls down and covers the wheels, and  the other is pulled up, leaving the side all iron bars.  Don't you see?  Then, instead of being vans, they are turned into dens and cages.\"    \"Is that so?\" said Singh quietly.    \"Oh, I suppose so,\" replied Glyn.  \"I have never seen one of these  affairs; but it seems a very reasonable way for building up a place all  dens and cages in very short time.\"    \"Oh, look here!\" cried another of the boys.  \"Here's a game!  Look at  that nigger!\"    Singh started as if he had been stung, and"]]]
