Oh!  Well, I like that.  Why, some men would ha' gone straight  to your uncle here, and told him all about it; but I didn't, and I'd  made up my mind to send him the money back, only I met two or three  mates, and I had to change one of 'em to give the poor lads a drink o'  ale.\"    \"You own, then, that you had my money, sir?\" cried the old merchant.    \"Well--some on it, master.  He give it me.  S'pose I oughtn't to have  took it, but I didn't like to come and tell you, and get the poor lad  into trouble.  He's so young, you see.\"    \"Uncle, it is not true!\" cried Lindon, excitedly.    \"But you had one of the guineas in your pocket, sir.\"    \"Yes, uncle, but--\"    \"Course he had,\" interrupted Mike sharply.  \"I told you it wouldn't do,  Master Don.  I begged you not to.\"    \"You villain!\" cried Don, grinding his teeth, while his uncle watched  him with a sidelong look.    \"Calling names won't mend it, my lad.  I knowed it was wrong.  I telled  him not to, sir, but he would.\"    This was to the constable in a confidential tone, and that functionary  responded with a solemn wink.    \"It is not true, uncle!\" cried Don again.    \"Oh, come now,\" said Mike, shaking his head with half tipsy reproach, \"I  wouldn't make worse on it, my lad, by telling a lot o' lies.  You did  wrong, as I says to you at the time; but you was so orbst'nate you  would.  Says as you'd got such lots of money, master, as you'd never  miss it.\"    Uncle Josiah gave vent to a sound resembling a disgusted grunt, and  turned from the speaker, who continued reproachfully to Don,--    \"What you've got to do, my lad, is to go down on your bended knees to  your uncle, as is a good master as ever lived--and I will say that, come  what may--and ask him to let you off this time, and you won't do so any  more.\"    \"Uncle, you won't believe what he says?\" cried Don wildly.    Uncle Josiah did not reply, only looked at him searchingly.    \"He can't help believing it, my lad,\" said Mike sadly.  \"It's werry  shocking in one so young.\"    Don made a desperate struggle to free himself from Jem's encircling  arms, but the man held fast.    \"No, no, my lad; keep quiet,\" growled Jem.  \"I'm going to spoil the  shape of his nose for him before he goes.\"    \"Then you don't believe it, Jem?\" cried Don, passionately.    \"Believe it, my lad?  Why, I couldn't believe it if he swore it 'fore a  hundred million magistrits.\"    \"No, that's allus the way with higgerant chaps like you, Jem Wimble,\"  said Mike; \"but it's all true, genelmen, and I'm sorry I didn't speak  out afore like a man, for he don't deserve what I did for him.\"    \"Hah!\" ejaculated Uncle Josiah, and Don's face was full of despair.    \"You charge Mike Bannock, then, with stealing this money, sir,\" said the  constable.    \"Yes, certainly.\"    \"What?\" roared Mike, savagely, \"charge me?\"    \"That will do,\" said the constable, taking a little staff with a brass  crown on the end from his pocket.  \"No nonsense, or I shall call in  help.  In the King's name, my lad.  Do you give in?\"    \"Give in?  What for?  I arn't done nothing.  Charge him; he's the  thief.\"    Don started as if the word _thief_ were a stinging lash.    Jem loosed his hold, and with double fists dashed at the scoundrel.    \"You say Master Don's a thief!\"    \"Silence, Wimble!  Stand back, sir,\" cried Uncle Josiah, sternly.    \"But, sir--\"    \"Silence, man!  Am I master here?\"    Jem drew back muttering.    \"Charge him, I say,\" continued Mike, boisterously; \"and if you won't, I  will.  Look here, Mr Smithers, I charge this 'ere boy with going to his  uncle's desk and taking all the gold, and leaving all the silver in a  little hogamee bowl.\"    \"You seem to know all about it, Mike,\" said the constable, grimly.    \"Course I do, my lad.  I seed him.  Caught him in the werry act, and he  dropped one o' the guineas, and it run away under the desk, and he  couldn't find it.\"    \"You saw all that, eh?\" said the constable.    \"Every bit of it.  I swears to it, sir.\"    \"And how came you to be in the office to see it?\"    \"How come I in the office to see it?\" said Mike, staring; \"how come I in  the office to see it?\"    \"Yes.  Your work's in the yard, isn't it?\"    \"Course it is,\" said Mike, with plenty of effrontery; \"but I heerd the  money jingling like, and I went in to see.\"    \"And very kind of you too, Mike,\" said the constable, jocularly.  \"Don't  you forget to tell that to the magistrates.\"    \"Magistrits?  What magistrits?  Master arn't going to give me in  custody, I know.\"    \"Indeed, but I am, you scoundrel,\" cried Uncle Josiah, wrathfully.  \"You  are one of the worst kind of thieves--\"    \"Here, take that back, master.\"    \"Worst kind of scoundrels--dogs who bite the hand that has fed them.\"    \"I tell yer it was him,\" said Mike, with a ferocious glare at Don.    \"All right, Mike, you tell the magistrates that,\" said the constable,  \"and don't forget.\"    \"I arn't going 'fore no magistrits,\" grumbled Mike.    \"Yes, you are,\" said the constable, taking a pair of handcuffs from his  pocket.  \"Now then, is it to be quietly?\"    Mike made a furious gesture.    \"Just as you like,\" said the constable.  \"Jem Wimble, I call you in the  King's name to help.\"    \"Which I just will,\" cried Jem, with alacrity; and he made at Mike,  while Don felt a strange desire tingling in his veins as he longed to  help as well.    \"I gives in,\" growled Mike.  \"I could chuck the whole lot on you outer  winder, but I won't.  It would only make it seem as if I was guilty, and  it's not guilty, and so I tell you.  Master says I took the money, and I  says it was that young Don Lavington as is the thief.  Come on,  youngster.  I'll talk to you when we're in the lock-up.\"    Don looked wildly from Mike to his uncle, whose eyes were fixed on the  constable.    \"Do you charge the boy too, sir?\"    Uncle Josiah was silent for some moments.    \"No!  Not now!\"    Lindon's heart leapt at that word \"_no_!\"  But it sank again at the  \"_not now_.\"    \"But the case is awkward, sir,\" said the constable.  \"After what this  man has said we shall be obliged to take some notice of the matter.\"    \"'Bliged to?  Course you will.  Here, bring 'im along.  Come on, mate.  I can tell you stories all night now about my bygones.  Keep up yer  sperrits, and I daresay the magistrits 'll let you off pretty easy.\"    \"If there is any charge made against my young clerk,\"--Don winced, for  his uncle did not say, \"against my nephew,\"--\"I will be answerable for  his appearance before the magistrates.  That will be sufficient, I  presume.\"    \"Yes, sir, I suppose that will do,\" said the constable.    \"But I s'pose it won't,\" said Mike.  \"He's the monkey and I'm only the  cat.  You've got to take him if you does your dooty, and master 'll be  answerable for me.\"    \"Exactly,\" said the constable; \"come along.\"    \"Nay, but this arn't fair, master.  Take one, take all.  You bring us  both.\"    \"Come along.\"    \"If you don't bring that there young un too, I won't go,\" exclaimed the  scoundrel, fiercely.    _Click_!    A short struggle, and then _click_ again, and Mike Bannock's hands were  useless, but he threw himself down.    \"Fair play, fair play,\" he cried, savagely; \"take one, take all.  Are  you going to charge him, master?\"    \"Take the scoundrel away, Smithers, and once more I will be bail--before  the magistrates, if necessary--for my clerk's appearance,\" cried Uncle  Josiah, who was now out of patience.  \"Can I help?\"    \"Well, sir, you could,\" said the constable, grimly; \"but if you'd have  in three or four of your men, and a short step ladder, we could soon  carry him off.\"    \"No man sha'n't carry me off,\" roared Mike, as Jem ran out of the office  with great alacrity, and returned in a very short time with three men  and a stout ladder, about nine feet long.    \"That's the sort, Wimble,\" said the constable.  \"Didn't think of a rope,  did you?\"    \"Did I think of two ropes?\" said Jem, grinning.    \"Ah!\" ejaculated the constable.  \"Now, Mike Bannock, I just warn you  that any violence will make your case worse.  Take my advice, get up and  come quietly.\"    \"Take young Don Lavington too, then, and I will.\"    \"Get up, and walk quietly.\"    \"Not 'less you takes him.\"    \"Sorry to make a rumpus, sir,\" said the constable, apologetically; \"but  I must have him out.\"    \"The sooner the better,\" said Uncle Josiah, grimly.    \"I am ready to go, uncle,\" said Don, quietly.  \"I am not afraid.\"    \"Hold your tongue, sir!\" said the merchant, sternly; \"and stand out of  the way.\"    \"Now, Mike,\" said the constable, \"this is the third time of asking.  Will you come quiet?\"    \"Take him too,\" cried Mike.    \"Ready with those ropes, Wimble.  You two, ready with that there.  Now,  Mike Bannock, you've been asked three times, and now you've got to mount  that ladder.\"    \"Any man comes a-nigh me,\" roared Mike, \"I'll--\"    He did not say what, for the constable dashed at him, and by an  ingenious twist avoided a savage kick, threw the scoundrel over on his  face, as he lay on the floor, and sat upon him, retaining his seat in  spite of his struggles.    \"Step the first,\" said the constable, coolly.  \"Now, Wimble, I want that  ladder passed under me, so as to lie right along on his back.  Do you  see?\"    \"Yes, sir,\" cried Jem, eagerly; and taking the ladder as the constable  sat astride the prostrate scoundrel, holding down his shoulders, and  easing himself up, the ladder was passed between the officer's legs,  and, in spite of a good deal of heaving, savage kicking, and one or two  fierce attempts to bite, right along till it was upon Mike's back,  projecting nearly two feet beyond his head and feet.    \"Murder!\" yelled Mike, hoarsely.    \"What?  Does it hurt, my lad?  Never mind; you'll soon get used to it.\"    The constable seated himself upon the ladder, whose sides and rounds  thoroughly imprisoned the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21322"],[0,"The Tale of Betsy Butterfly (#5)"],[1,".    As he stared at Mrs. Ladybug dully Daddy Longlegs let his mouth fall  wide open.    \"Why, what do you mean?\" he demanded at last. \"You and I aren't talking  about the same sort of butter at all! You're describing the kind of  butter that Mrs. Green makes at the farmhouse.\"    \"And what, pray tell, have you been talking about all this time?\" Mrs.  Ladybug gasped.    \"The butter-and-eggs in the meadow!\" Daddy Longlegs informed her. \"I  suppose you know the plant, don't you?\"    \"I've heard of it,\" Mrs. Ladybug replied. \"But I doubt if there is such  a thing.\"    \"And I say there is!\" Buster Bumblebee clamored. \"We Bumblebees are very  fond of butter-and-eggs. And we're about the only field people that  know how to open a blossom and reach its nectar.\"    Little Mrs. Ladybug waited to hear no more.    \"You've made a terrible blunder!\" she told Daddy Longlegs hurriedly. And  before he could answer her she had hastened away.    Like many another jealous body, Mrs. Ladybug had behaved very foolishly.  And it was no wonder that she wanted to get away from the crowd.    She didn't even beg Betsy Butterfly's pardon for calling her a thief.  But all the rest of the field people realized at last that Betsy was no  thief.    The butter-and-eggs plant, they were well aware, was as free as the  clover, or the milk-weed blossoms, or any other of the wild flowers.  Everybody knew that Farmer Green laid no claim to them, though they did  grow in his meadow.    And when Betsy Butterfly thanked Daddy Longlegs for his explanation he  wished more than ever that he had worn his new coat that day--and his  new hat, too.          XIII    THE FRIENDLY STRANGER      OF course, anyone so beautiful as Betsy Butterfly was bound to attract  attention. Wherever she went people turned their heads--if they  could--to look at her. And those whose heads were so fastened to their  bodies that they simply couldn't crane their necks at anybody--even  those unlucky creatures wheeled themselves about in order to gaze at  Betsy.    If they happened to be ladies they stared at her because they wanted to  see what was the latest style in gowns, or maybe hats. And if they  happened to be gentlemen they looked at her because they just couldn't  help it.    It was no wonder, then, that Betsy Butterfly had many admirers. In fact,  she was so accustomed to their flittering after her that usually she  paid little heed to them. But now and then one of them made himself so  agreeable that Betsy favored him slightly more than the others.    Such was a stranger dressed in yellowish brown whom she chanced to meet  among the flowers one day. He was flying from flower to flower with a  loud buzzing. And he reminded Betsy Butterfly of somebody, but she  couldn't just think who it was.    \"Ah!\" said the stranger, as soon as he caught Betsy's eye. \"The blossoms  are fine and fresh after last night's shower, aren't they?\"    Betsy had to admit that what the stranger said was true. And when he  came right over to the flower where she was breakfasting and began  buzzing around her, and eating pollen, Betsy Butterfly thought that for  a stranger he seemed very friendly.    She looked at him for a time, out of the corner of her eye, while she  tried to recall whom the newcomer resembled. But he looked like no one  she had even seen. And then all at once Betsy knew what was so familiar  about him. It was his voice!    \"You remind me of a friend of mine,\" she remarked. \"He lives in the  meadow not far from here. It's your buzzing,\" she explained. \"If I  didn't see you I should think you were Buster Bumblebee.\"    Betsy's remark seemed to please the stranger. And he smiled smugly while  he buzzed louder than ever.    \"It's not surprising that I make you think of him,\" he observed. \"Indeed  it would be odd if I didn't, for I'm a sort of cousin of Buster's, so  to speak. Perhaps you didn't know that my name is Bumble--Joseph  Bumble.\"    Naturally Betsy and Joseph became good friends on the spot. And after  that people often saw them rambling together among the flowers.    Now, Joseph Bumble proved to be a great talker. And since Betsy  Butterfly was an excellent listener, they spent many agreeable hours  together.    At least, Joseph enjoyed every minute that he spent in Betsy Butterfly's  company. And if at times she found his prattle a bit tiresome, she was  too well-mannered to say so.    If the truth were known, Joseph Bumble proved to be somewhat of a  braggart. He was forever boasting of his connection with the Bumblebee  family. And Betsy couldn't say anything to him without his remarking  that his cousin Buster Bumblebee's mother, the well-known Queen, thought  this or that.    \"And being of royal blood, the Queen ought to know what's what,\" he  frequently said.    \"I suppose--\" Betsy said to him at last--\"I suppose you're of royal  blood yourself, Mr. Bumble?\"    \"Oh, very!\" he replied with a smirk. \"We're all of us very royal  indeed.\"    And Betsy Butterfly thought how pleasant it was to be friends with  anyone who came from such a fine family as Joseph Bumble's.          XIV    A DEEP PLOT      AS time passed, Betsy continued to see a great deal of Joseph Bumble.  And she noticed one peculiar thing: Although he talked continually of  his cousin Buster Bumblebee, the Queen's son, no one had ever seen the  two together.    \"How does it happen,\" she asked Joseph at last, \"that I never find you  with your cousin? Aren't you friends?\"    \"We're certainly not _enemies_,\" said Joseph Bumble, \"though I must  admit that we're not quite so intimate as we might be. You see, Buster  and I have different tastes. And now that the red clover is in blossom  he spends all his time in the clover field. But as you know, like you I  am very fond of flowers. And I'd far rather be here in the meadow--or  the flower garden--with you, than in the clover patch with Buster  Bumblebee.\"    Naturally such an answer was bound to please Betsy Butterfly. And after  that she bothered her head no more about the friendship between the two  cousins. Certainly Joseph Bumble's explanation sounded reasonable. And  she had no cause to doubt his statement.    Meanwhile there were others among Betsy Butterfly's admirers who became  very peevish on observing how much time Betsy and the newcomer in the  neighborhood, Joseph Bumble, were spending in each other's society. And  they agreed among themselves that something ought to be done to put an  end to the upstart Bumble's boasting.    \"Betsy Butterfly thinks the fellow is a cousin of Buster Bumblebee's,\"  said Chirpy Cricket. \"But I've noticed that he and Buster are never  together. Let's ask Buster to come over to the meadow so that he may  meet this cousin of his! And then perhaps we'll learn something more  about Joseph Bumble than we know now.\"    Everybody said that that was a good plan. And Betsy's admirers chose  Daddy Longlegs to call on Buster Bumblebee and invite him to a party to  be given in the meadow the following day.    Daddy Longlegs agreed to do the errand, in spite of the fact that for  him it was half a day's journey to the Bumblebee's home from the stone  wall where he lived. But he thought that by hurrying he ought to be able  to get back in time to put on his best coat and go to the party, though  he might arrive somewhat late.    \"Don't forget to ask Betsy Butterfly to the party!\" Daddy called, as he  started off on his long trip.    \"Don't worry! I'll attend to that myself,\" Chirpy Cricket promised.    \"And don't forget to invite Joseph Bumble!\" Daddy cautioned him.    \"Oh! we don't need to ask him,\" said Chirpy Cricket. \"_He'll_ come  without being invited, unless I'm greatly mistaken.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Luckily for Daddy Longlegs there was not a breath of wind either that  day or the following one. So he made excellent time to the Bumblebee  home, where he found Buster Bumblebee and gave him his invitation. Then  Daddy turned around and started back towards his stone wall. Buster  Bumblebee had promised to come to the party. And Daddy wanted to be  present when the two cousins, Buster Bumblebee and Joseph Bumble,  met--with Betsy Butterfly right there to watch them.          XV    JOSEPH BUMBLE'S COMPLAINT      IT happened just as Chirpy Cricket had expected. Betsy Butterfly arrived  at the party with her admirer, Joseph Bumble, buzzing close behind her.  Although he had not been invited, he did not feel the least bit shy  about coming.    \"Being of a royal family, I never wait to be asked to a place,\" he had  explained loftily to Betsy. \"And you'll see that everybody will be glad  to see me at the party. People always consider it an honor to have me at  their entertainments.\"    Joseph's words proved partly true, anyhow. Anyone could see that Joseph  Bumble was more than welcome. Chirpy Cricket and Daddy Longlegs--as  well good many others--rushed up to him and told him how pleased they  were to see him.    And Joseph Bumble was having a very agreeable time talking in a loud  voice about himself and his family when he suddenly stopped short. A  look of displeasure crossed his face. And Daddy Longlegs asked him if he  had eaten something that disagreed with him.    \"No!\" replied Joseph Bumble. \"I've been interrupted. And it's hardly the  sort of treatment a person of royal blood--like myself--expects to  receive at a party.\"    \"Who interrupted you?\" Chirpy Cricket inquired.    \"I don't know,\" Joseph Bumble answered. \"But someone was talking in a  loud voice.\"    \"Are you sure it wasn't yourself that you heard?\" Daddy Longlegs wanted  to know.    \"Certainly not!\" cried Joseph. \"Don't be silly! Don't you suppose I know  my own voice when I hear it?\"    \"Perhaps it was your echo that you heard,\" Daddy ventured.    At that Joseph Bumble rudely turned his back on him and began whispering  to Chirpy Cricket. He was actually suggesting that Daddy Longlegs should  be thrown out of the party!    And"]]]
