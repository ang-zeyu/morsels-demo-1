Alice gave a weary sigh. \"I think you might do something better with the  time,\" she said, \"than wasting it in asking riddles that have no  answers.\"    \"Take some more tea,\" the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.    \"I've had nothing yet,\" Alice replied in an offended tone, \"so I can't  take more.\"    \"You mean you can't take _less_,\" said the Hatter; \"it's very easy to  take _more_ than nothing.\"    At this, Alice got up and walked off. The Dormouse fell asleep instantly  and neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she  looked back once or twice; the last time she saw them, they were  trying to put the Dormouse into the tea-pot.    [Illustration: The Trial of the Knave of Hearts.]    \"At any rate, I'll never go _there_ again!\" said Alice, as she picked  her way through the wood. \"It's the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in  all my life!\" Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees  had a door leading right into it. \"That's very curious!\" she thought. \"I  think I may as well go in at once.\" And in she went.    Once more she found herself in the long hall and close to the little  glass table. Taking the little golden key, she unlocked the door that  led into the garden. Then she set to work nibbling at the mushroom (she  had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high;  then she walked down the little passage; and _then_--she found herself  at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the  cool fountains.          VIII--THE QUEEN'S CROQUET GROUND      A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden; the roses  growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily  painting them red. Suddenly their eyes chanced to fall upon Alice, as  she stood watching them. \"Would you tell me, please,\" said Alice, a  little timidly, \"why you are painting those roses?\"    Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began, in a low  voice, \"Why, the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a  _red_ rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and, if the Queen  was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So  you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore she comes, to--\" At this  moment, Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called  out, \"The Queen! The Queen!\" and the three gardeners instantly threw  themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps  and Alice looked 'round, eager to see the Queen.    First came ten soldiers carrying clubs, with their hands and feet at the  corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with  diamonds. After these came the royal children; there were ten of them,  all ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and  Queens, and among them Alice recognized the White Rabbit. Then followed  the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King's crown on a crimson velvet  cushion; and last of all this grand procession came THE KING AND THE  QUEEN OF HEARTS.    When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked  at her, and the Queen said severely, \"Who is this?\" She said it to the  Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.    \"My name is Alice, so please Your Majesty,\" said Alice very politely;  but she added to herself, \"Why, they're only a pack of cards, after  all!\"    \"Can you play croquet?\" shouted the Queen. The question was evidently  meant for Alice.    \"Yes!\" said Alice loudly.    \"Come on, then!\" roared the Queen.    \"It's--it's a very fine day!\" said a timid voice to Alice. She was  walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.    \"Very,\" said Alice. \"Where's the Duchess?\"    \"Hush! Hush!\" said the Rabbit. \"She's under sentence of execution.\"    \"What for?\" said Alice.    \"She boxed the Queen's ears--\" the Rabbit began.    \"Get to your places!\" shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and  people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each  other. However, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game  began.    Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in her  life; it was all ridges and furrows. The croquet balls were live  hedgehogs, and the mallets live flamingos and the soldiers had to double  themselves up and stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.    The players all played at once, without waiting for turns, quarrelling  all the while and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time,  the Queen was in a furious passion and went stamping about and shouting,  \"Off with his head!\" or \"Off with her head!\" about once in a minute.    \"They're dreadfully fond of beheading people here,\" thought Alice; \"the  great wonder is that there's anyone left alive!\"    She was looking about for some way of escape, when she noticed a curious  appearance in the air. \"It's the Cheshire-Cat,\" she said to herself;  \"now I shall have somebody to talk to.\"    \"How are you getting on?\" said the Cat.    \"I don't think they play at all fairly,\" Alice said, in a rather  complaining tone; \"and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't hear  oneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in particular.\"    \"How do you like the Queen?\" said the Cat in a low voice.    \"Not at all,\" said Alice.    [Illustration]    Alice thought she might as well go back and see how the game was going  on. So she went off in search of her hedgehog. The hedgehog was engaged  in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed to Alice an excellent  opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other; the only  difficulty was that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of  the garden, where Alice could see it trying, in a helpless sort of way,  to fly up into a tree. She caught the flamingo and tucked it away under  her arm, that it might not escape again.    Just then Alice ran across the Duchess (who was now out of prison). She  tucked her arm affectionately into Alice's and they walked off together.  Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper. She was a  little startled, however, when she heard the voice of the Duchess close  to her ear. \"You're thinking about something, my dear, and that makes  you forget to talk.\"    \"The game's going on rather better now,\" Alice said, by way of keeping  up the conversation a little.    \"'Tis so,\" said the Duchess; \"and the moral of that is--'Oh, 'tis love,  'tis love that makes the world go 'round!'\"    \"Somebody said,\" Alice whispered, \"that it's done by everybody minding  his own business!\"    \"Ah, well! It means much the same thing,\" said the Duchess, digging her  sharp little chin into Alice's shoulder, as she added \"and the moral of  _that_ is--'Take care of the sense and the sounds will take care of  themselves.'\"    To Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's arm that was linked into hers  began to tremble. Alice looked up and there stood the Queen in front of  them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm!    \"Now, I give you fair warning,\" shouted the Queen, stamping on the  ground as she spoke, \"either you or your head must be off, and that in  about half no time. Take your choice!\" The Duchess took her choice, and  was gone in a moment.    \"Let's go on with the game,\" the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too  much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the  croquet-ground.    All the time they were playing, the Queen never left off quarreling with  the other players and shouting, \"Off with his head!\" or \"Off with her  head!\" By the end of half an hour or so, all the players, except the  King, the Queen and Alice, were in custody of the soldiers and under  sentence of execution.    Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and walked away with  Alice.    Alice heard the King say in a low voice to the company generally, \"You  are all pardoned.\"    Suddenly the cry \"The Trial's beginning!\" was heard in the distance, and  Alice ran along with the others.          IX--WHO STOLE THE TARTS?      The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they  arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts of little  birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was  standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard  him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand  and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the court  was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it. \"I wish they'd get the  trial done,\" Alice thought, \"and hand 'round the refreshments!\"    The judge, by the way, was the King and he wore his crown over his great  wig. \"That's the jury-box,\" thought Alice; \"and those twelve creatures  (some were animals and some were birds) I suppose they are the jurors.\"    Just then the White Rabbit cried out \"Silence in the court!\"    \"Herald, read the accusation!\" said the King.    [Illustration]    On this, the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, then  unrolled the parchment-scroll and read as follows:        \"The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,        All on a summer day;      The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts        And took them quite away!\"    \"Call the first witness,\" said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three  blasts on the trumpet and called out, \"First witness!\"    The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand  and a piece of bread and butter in the other.    \"You ought to have finished,\" said the King. \"When did you begin?\"    The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the  court, arm in arm with the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19036"],[0,"Germany and the Germans from an American Point of View (#5)"],[1,"children. At his  death war breaks out. Pepin dies, leaving, however, a son Pepin to  inherit his kingdom of Aquitaine. Louis and Charles attempt to take  his kingdom from him, his uncle Lothair defends him, and at the great  battle of Fontenay (841) Louis and Charles defeat Lothair. Lothair  gains the adherence of the Saxons, and Charles and Louis at the head  of their armies confirm their alliance, and at Strasburg the two  armies take the oath of allegiance: the followers of Louis took the  oath in German, the followers of Charles in French, and this oath, the  words of which are still preserved, is the earliest specimen of the  French language in existence.    In 843 another treaty signed at Verdun, between the two brothers  Lothair and Louis and their half-brother Charles, separated for the  first time the Netherlands, the Rhine country, Burgundy, and Italy,  which became the portion of Lothair; all Germany east of this  territory, which went to Louis; and all the territory to the west of  it, which went to Charles. Germany and France, therefore, by the  Treaty of Verdun in 843, became distinct kingdoms, and modern  geography in Europe is born.    From the death of Henry the Fowler, in 936, down to the nomination of  Frederick I of Bavaria, sixth Burgrave of Nuremberg, to be Margrave of  Brandenburg, in 1411, the history of the particular Germany we are  studying is swallowed up in the history of these German tribes of  central Europe and of the Holy Roman Empire. It is in these years of  the seven Crusades, from 1095 to the last in 1248; of Frederick  Barbarossa; of the centuries-long quarrel between the Welfs, or  Guelphs, and the Waiblingers, or Ghibellines, which were for years in  Italy, and are still in Germany, political parties; of the Hanseatic  League of the cities to protect commerce from the piracies of a  disordered and unruled country; of the Dane and the Norman descents  upon the coasts of France, Germany, and England, and of their burning,  killing, and carrying into captivity; of the Saracens scouring the  Mediterranean coasts and sacking Rome itself; of the Wends and Czechs,  Hungarian bands who dashed in upon the eastern frontiers of the now  helpless and amorphous empire of Charlemagne, all the way from the  Baltic to the Danube; of the quarrel between Henry IV and that Jupiter  Ecclesiasticus, Hildebrand, or Gregory VII, who has left us his  biography in the single phrase, \"To go to Canossa\"; of Genghis Khan  and his Mongol hordes; of the long fight between popes and emperors  over the right of investiture; of Rudolph of Hapsburg; of the throwing  off of their allegiance to the Empire of the Kings of Burgundy,  Poland, Hungary, and Denmark; of the settlement of the question of the  legal right to elect the emperor by Charles IV, who fixed the power in  the persons of seven rulers: the King of Bohemia, the Count Palatine  of the Rhine, the Duke of Saxony, the Margraf of Brandenburg, and the  three Archbishops of Mayence, Treves, and Cologne; of the independence  of the great cities of northern Italy; of Otto the Great, whose first  wife was a granddaughter of Alfred the Great, and who was the real  founder of the Holy Roman Empire, in the sense that a German prince  rules over both Germany and Italy with the approval of the Pope, and  in the sense that he, a duke of Saxony, appropriates the western  empire (962), goes to Rome, delivers the Pope, subdues Italy, and  fixes the imperial crown in the name and nation of Germany; of the  beginning of that hope of a world-church and a world-state, of a  universal church and a universal kingdom, which took form in what is  known as the Holy Roman Empire; of that greatest of all forgeries, the  Donation of Constantine by the monk Isidor, discovered and revealed by  Cardinal Nicolaus, of Cura, in which it is pretended that Constantine  handed over Rome to the Pope and his successors forever, with all the  power and privileges of the Caesars, and of the effects of this, the  most successful lie ever told in the world, during the seven hundred  years it was believed: it is in these years of turbulence and change  that one must trace the threads of history, from the first appearance  of the Germans, down to the time when what is now Prussia became a  frontier post of the empire under the rule of a Hohenzollern.    It is, perhaps, of all periods in history, the most interesting to  Americans, for then and there our civilization was born. Writing of  the conquest of the British Isles by the Germans, J. R. Green says:  \"What strikes us at once in the new England is this, that it was the  one purely German nation that rose upon the wreck of Rome. In other  lands, in Spain or Gaul or Italy, though they were equally conquered  by German peoples, religion, social life, administrative order, still  remained Roman.\" The roots of our civilization, are to be dug for in  those days when the German peoples met the imperialism and the  Christianity of Rome, and absorbed and renewed them. The Roman Empire,  tottering on a foundation of, it is said, as many as fifty million  slaves -- even a poor man would have ten slaves, a rich man ten or  twenty thousand -- and overrun with the mongrel races from Syria,  Greece, and Africa, and hiding away the remnants of its power in the  Orient, became in a few centuries an easy prey to our ancestors \"of  the stern blue eyes, the ruddy hair, the large and robust bodies.\"    \"Caerula quis stupuit lumina? flavam  Caesariem, et madido torquentem cornua cirro?  Nempe quod haec illis natura est omnibus una,\"    writes Juvenal of their resemblance to one another.    By the year 1411 long strides had been made toward other forms of  social, political, religious, and commercial life, due to the German  grip upon Europe. Dante, whose grandmother was a Goth, was not only a  poet but a fighter for freedom, taking a leading part in the struggle  of the Bianchi against the Neri and Pope Boniface, was born in 1265  and died in 1321; Francis of Assisi, born in 1182, not only  represented a democratic influence in the church, but led the earliest  revolt against the despotism of money; the movement to found cities  and to league cities together for the furtherance of trade and  industry, and thus to give rights to whole classes of people hitherto  browbeaten by church or state or both, began in Italy; and the  alliance of the cities of the Rhine, and the Hansa League, date from  the beginning of the thirteenth century; the discovery of how to make  paper dates from this time, and printing followed; the revolt of the  Albigenses against priestly dominance which drenched the south of  France in blood began in the twelfth century; slavery disappeared  except in Spain; Wycliffe, born in 1324, translated the Gospels, threw  off his allegiance to the papacy, and suffered the cheap vengeance of  having his body exhumed and its ashes scattered in the river Swift;  Aquinas and Duns Scotus delivered philosophy from the tyranny of  theology; Roger Bacon (1214) practically introduced the study of  natural science; Magna Charta was signed in 1215; Marco Polo, whose  statue I have seen among those of the gods, in a certain Chinese  temple, began his travels in the thirteenth century; the university of  Bologna was founded before 1200 for the untrammelled study of medicine  and philosophy; Abelard, who died in 1142, represented, to put it  pithily, the spirit of free inquiry in matters theological, and  lectured to thousands in Paris. What do these men and movements mean?  I am wofully wrong in my ethnographical calculations if these things  do not mean, that the people of whom Tacitus wrote, \"No man dictates  to the assembly; he may persuade but cannot command,\" were shaping and  moulding the life of Europe, with their passionate love of individual  liberty, with their sturdy insistence upon the right of men to think  and work without arbitrary interference. Out of this furnace came  constitutional government in England, and republican government in  America. We owe the origins of our political life to the influence of  these German tribes, with their love of individual freedom and their  stern hatred of meddlesome rulers, or a meddlesome state or  legislature.    Germany had no literature at this time. When Froissart was writing  French history, and Joinville his delightful chronicles; when Chaucer  and Wycliffe were gayly and gravely making play with the monks and  priests, the only names known in Germany were those of the mystics,  Eckhart and Tauler. When the time came, however, Germany was defiantly  individualist in Luther, and Protestantism was thoroughly German. It  was not from tales of the great, not from knighthood, chivalry, or  their roving singer champions, that German literature came; but from  the fables and satires of the people, from Hans Sachs and from the  Luther translation of the Bible. This is roughly the setting of  civilization, in which the first Hohenzollerns found themselves when  they took over the Mark of Brandenburg, in the early years of the  fifteenth century.    Here is a list of them, of no great interest in themselves, but  showing the direct descent down to the present time; for from the  Peace of Westphalia (1648) to the French Revolution the German states  were without either men or measures, except Frederick the Great, that  call for other than dreary comment:    Frederick I of Nuremberg, 1417  Frederick II, 1440  Albert III, 1470  Johann III, 1476  Joachim I, 1499  Joachim II, 1535  Johann George, 1571  Joachim Frederick, 1598  Johann Sigismund of Poland (first Duke of Prussia), 1608  George William, 1619  Frederick William (the Great Elector), 1640  Frederick III, Frederick I of Prussia (crowned first King of Prussia   in 1701), 1657-1713  Frederick William I (son of Frederick I of Prussia), 1688-1740  Frederick II (the Great) (son of Frederick William I), 1712-1786  Frederick William II (son of Augustus"]]]
