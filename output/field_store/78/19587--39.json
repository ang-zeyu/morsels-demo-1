In 1643 the cathedral was taken possession of by Cromwell's soldiers,  and the work of spoliation carried on. The organ was probably destroyed  at this time, for Dean Crofts set up a new organ in 1660, the case of  which was re-modelled in 1833, and still remains. It is also perhaps  needless to state that the cathedral was repeatedly whitewashed during  the eighteenth century.    In June 1801 a fire broke out in the roof of the nave, but was  extinguished before much damage had been done.    The various works effected during this century are mentioned  specifically elsewhere in these notes, under the headings of the parts  of the building where they have occurred.          [Illustration: The Cathedral from the South-West Angle of Cloisters.]    CHAPTER II    THE CATHEDRAL--EXTERIOR      Norwich Cathedral does not tell to great advantage from the outside: its  chief charm is undoubtedly the interior. It stands in a hollow, on what  is probably the lowest ground in the city. The best view of the  cathedral is obtained from the low ground to the eastward near the  river, and close to Pull's Ferry; here the extreme length of the nave,  which Fergusson remarked justified the addition of western towers, is  lost partly by foreshortening, and by the projection forward of the  south transept, over which the old Norman tower, with its later  battlements and spire, rises grandly above the sweep of the apse, with  the still remaining circular chapels below.    #The Cathedral Precincts#, or Close, running from Tombland eastward to  the river, are entered by two gates to the precincts and one to the  bishop's palace.    #The Erpingham Gate#, opposite the west front of the cathedral, was  built by Sir Thomas Erpingham, and as an architectural compilation \"is  original and unique.\" In elevation it consists of one lofty  well-proportioned arch supported on either side by semi-hexagonal  buttresses taken up as high as the apex of arch; above comes a plain  gable, in which, centred over the arch below, is a canopied niche with  the kneeling figure of Sir Thomas Erpingham.    Built probably about 1420, and while yet some of the noble simplicity of  the thirteenth had not passed into the over-wrought richness of the  fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, it presents a type of the best  Perpendicular work we have in England.    The form of the arch is lofty, and may have been suggested by the wish  to preserve a view through of the cathedral.    The arch moulding is enriched on the outer part with figures of fourteen  female saints, and on the inner with twelve male saints; the  semi-hexagonal panelled buttresses are covered with the shields of the  families of Erpingham, Clopton, and Walton, and each has a seated figure  of an ecclesiastic on the top.    [Illustration: The Erpingham Gate.]    The richness of this lower arch stage tells against the plain gable  over, and is quite admirable in effect and defensible as a method of  design; it is ornament decorating construction pure and simple, and not  what later work generally was and is, constructed ornament, suggesting  over-elaborate construction thereby made necessary. It will be noticed  that labels with the word \"Yenk\" (think) sculptured thereon are placed  between the shafts on either side of the archway; this has been  construed \"pend\" by some writers, and from this the view was taken that  Sir Thomas Erpingham was made to build the gate as a penance for  favouring Lollardism, and that the figure of himself in the gable over  the archway represents him as praying pardon for the offence.    This interpretation, however, amusing as it is, is probably erroneous,  and the gate, with its shields of allied families, stands to the memory  of its founder. Sir Thomas Erpingham was at Agincourt in 1415, and  Shakespeare, in Act iv. of Henry V., remarks of him that he was \"a  knight grown grey with age and honour.\" Sir Thomas Browne also (p. 9 of  his \"Repertorium\") says: \"He was a Knight of the Garter in the time of  Henry IV. and some part of Henry V., and I find his name in the list of  the Lord Wardens of the Cinque Ports.\"    Sir Thomas Erpingham had two wives, Joan Clopton and Joan Walton, whose  arms appear on the gateway.    [Illustration: St. Ethelbert's Gate.]    #St. Ethelbert's Gate#, to the south, is an early \"Decorated\" structure.  Its elevation is divided into three storeys, in the lowest of which is  the gateway, with flat buttresses on each side carried up the height of  two storeys, and enriched with pedimented niches in both stages. In the  compartment over the arch are seven niches, four of which are pierced  with windows. The upper stage is in flintwork. It was built by the  citizens as part of the fine imposed on them for their share in the  riots and fire of 1272 by the Court of King Henry III., though probably  not until some years had elapsed, and when Edward the First had come to  the throne. The upper part of the front was restored early in this  century. The back elevation is interesting--the window over the arch  being typical of the style.    [Illustration: The Gate-House of the Bishop's Palace.]    #The Gate-House# forming the entrance to the bishop's palace, on the  north side of the cathedral, was built by Bishop Alnwyck about 1430, and  probably replaced an earlier structure; it is an interesting piece of  Perpendicular work, and consists, in the lower stage, of a gate and  doorway under a deep horizontal band ornamented with plain shields and  monograms of the Virgin. The gateway on the left side reaches up to the  horizontal bands, and has spandrels on either side; the doorway is  smaller. Above are two windows with a niche between, and over all is a  parapet of modern work. Flat buttresses flank the entire composition on  either side. The wooden gates were added by Bishop Lyhart (1446-72).    Returning to the Erpingham gate, and entering the Close through it,  immediately on our left we come to the #Chapel of St. John the  Evangelist# (converted by Edward VI., and still used as a school),  founded by Bishop Salmon (1299-1325). This building replaced an older  structure, used as a charnel, and provision was made for this need in  the new edifice; the vaults under the chapel were used for the same  purpose. The porch is a later building added by Lyhart (1446-72).    #The West Front of the Cathedral# has probably received worse treatment  than any other portion of the building, and stands now as the most  unsatisfactory part of the whole. The design consists in its width of  three compartments, with two separating and two flanking turrets. The  centre compartment is of the width of the nave, and those on either side  the width of the aisles. In the centre comes the main doorway, flanked  on either side with niches, and over these, filling the entire breadth,  the great nine-light west window, with the Norman turrets carried up to  the base of the gable. The compartments on either side are finished off  by horizontal mouldings taken across somewhat below the level of the  springing of the archivolt of the main window, and have flanking turrets  covered with plain pinnacles. The large west window is disproportionate,  and even the assurance cheerfully given by most authorities, that it  resembles the window of Westminster Hall, fails to prove that it is of  suitable size here. It may be as well to note in order the various  changes which have affected the west front. Mr B.W. Spaull, in Dean  Goulburn's work on the Cathedral, made reference to the discovery of an  alteration to the main entrance which must have been prior to that now  existing. It consisted of a small _parvise_ or room added above at some  time subsequent to the original foundation. As the details are not now  apparent, it is best to refer readers to the work named for fuller  information.    The addition, however, of later Perpendicular triforium windows to the  nave superimposed over the original Norman lights, which were blocked  up, may have affected the west front. This can best be seen by viewing,  for instance, the south side of the nave. The Norman roofs sloped down  to the original triforium windows, but after the later addition were  made almost flat, and must have necessitated some mask wall in the west  front.    [Illustration: West Front of the Cathedral.]    In Britton's \"History of Norwich\" is a drawing which is reproduced at p.  15. It will be seen that the turrets at each side of the west window are  shown finished with stone cupolas, the tops of which were level with the  apex of the gable. The two outside flanking turrets are shown finished  by circular drums above the parapet, and covered with leaden cupolas;  these, with the Perpendicular battlements, were probably added as the  mask before referred to, and necessitated by the imposition of an  additional storey at the triforium level. Certainly the west front, as  shown then, was better far than now. However, in 1875, \"_restoration_\"  set in, and these cupolas were removed, and stone \"pepper-box\" pinnacles  imposed on the turrets in their stead. The gable was restored, and the  character of the work wholly destroyed, crocketted where before plain,  and the niche added in the place of the small light over the vault shown  in Britton's plate. In the side compartments the Perpendicular  battlementing was removed and the round cannon ball holes gratuitously  inserted.    The two pinnacles at the sides of the west window have since been  removed.    The earlier change in the central compartment of the front from Norman  to Perpendicular was effected by the additions of the door and window  still remaining. Bishop Alnwyck, who was translated to Lincoln in 1436,  added the doorway during his episcopate, and it was probably built right  over and covering the original Norman door and arcading. He also left  provision in his will for the west window, and this was added by Bishop  Lyhart (1446-72), to throw"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19719"],[0,"The Art Of Writing & Speaking The English Language (#5)"],[1," pour,_ etc., and sometimes have still other sounds,  as _ou_ in _bought_).    Oi and oy have a distinct sound of their own, as in _oil, toil, oyster,  void, boy, employ,_ etc.    _Ow_ and _oi_ are called proper diphthongs, as the two vowels combine  to produce a sound different from either, while such combinations as  _ei, ea, ai,_ etc., are called improper diphthongs (or digraphs),  because they have the sound of one or other of the simple vowels.    3.  In the preceding paragraphs we have given all the distinct vowel  sounds of the language, though many of them are slightly modified in  certain combinations.  But in many cases one vowel will be given the  sound of another vowel, and two or more vowels will combine with a  variety of sounds.  These irregularities occur chiefly in a few hundred  common words, and cause the main difficulties of spelling the English  language.  The following are the leading substitutes:    ew with the sound of _u_ long, as in _few, chew,_ etc. (perhaps  this may be considered a proper diphthong);    e (_e, e_) with the sound of _a_ long, as in _fete, abbe,_ and all  foreign words written with an accent, especially French words;    i with the sound of _e_ long, as in _machine,_ and nearly all French and  other foreign words;    o has the sound of double _o_ long in _tomb, womb, prove, move,_ etc.,  and of double _o_ short in _wolf, women,_ etc.;    o also has the sound of _u_ short in _above, love, some, done,_ etc.;    u has the sound of double _o_ long after _r,_ as in _rude, rule_;    it also has the sound of double _o_ short in _put, pull, bull, sure,_  etc.;    ea has the sound of _a_ long, as in _great_; of _e_ long, as in _heat_; of  _e_ short, as in _head_; of _a_ Italian (ah), as in _heart, hearth,_ etc.;    ei has the sound of _e_ long, as in _receive_; of _a_ long, as in  _freight, weight_; sometimes of _i_ long, as in _either_ and _neither,_  pronounced with either the sound of _e_ long or _i_ long, the latter  being the English usage;    ie has the sound of _i_ long, as in _lie,_ and of _e_ long,  as in _belief,_ and of _i_ short, as in _sieve_;    ai has the sound of _a_ long, as in _laid, bail, train,_ etc.,  and of _a_ short, as in _plaid;_    ay has the sound of _a_ long, as in _play, betray, say,_ etc.;    oa has the sound of _o_ long, as in _moan, foam, coarse,_ etc.    There are also many peculiar and occasional substitutions of sounds as in  _any_ and _many_ (a as e), _women_ (o as i), _busy_ (u as i),  _said_ (ai as e), _people_ (eo as e:), _build_ (u as i), _gauge_ (au as  a:),  _what_ (a as o), etc.    When any of these combinations are to be pronounced as separate vowels,  in two syllables, two dots should be placed over the second, as in _naive_.    4.  The chief modifications of the elementary sounds are the following:    before _r_ each of the vowels _e, i, o, u,_ and _y_ has almost the same  sound (marked like the Spanish n) as in _her, birth, honor, burr,_ and  _myrtle; o_ before _r_ sometimes has the sound of _aw,_ as in _or, for,_  etc.;    in unaccented syllables, each of the long vowels has a slightly shortened  sound, as in f_a_tality, n_e_gotiate, int_o_nation, ref_u_tation,  indicated by a dot above the sign for the long sound; (in a few words,  such as d_i_gress, the sound is not shortened, however);    long _a_ (a) is slightly modified in such words as _care, fare, bare,_  etc., while _e_ has the same sound in words like _there, their,_ and  _where_; (New Englan{d} g people give _a_ the short sound in such words  as _care,_ etc., and pronounce _there_ and _where_ with the short sound  of _a,_ while _their_ is pronounced with the short sound of _e_:  this is not the best usage, however);    in _pass, class, command, laugh,_ etc., we have a sound of a between  Italian _a_ and short _a_ (indicated by a single dot over the _a_),  though most Americans pronounce it as short, and most English give the  Italian sound:  the correct pronunciation is between these two.    The Sounds of the Consonants.  We have already seen that there are two  classes of consonant sounds, those which have a voice sound, as _b,_  called _sonant,_ and those which are mere breath sounds, like _p,_  called _surds_ or aspirates.  The chief difference between _b_ and _p_  is that one has the voice sound and the other has not.  Most of the  other consonants also stand in pairs.  We may say that the sonant  consonant and its corresponding surd are the hard and soft forms of  the same sound.  The following table contains also simple consonant  sounds represented by two letters:  _Sonant                    Surd_      b                        p      d                        t      v                        f      g (hard)                 k      j                        ch      z                        s      th (in _thine_)          th (in _thin_)      zh (or z as in _azure_)  sh      w      y      l      m      n      r                        h    If we go down this list from the top to the bottom, we see that _b_ is the  most closed sound, while _h_ is the most slight and open, and the others  are graded in between (though not precisely as arranged above).  These  distinctions are important, because in making combinations of consonants in  the same syllable or in successive syllables we cannot pass abruptly from a  closed sound to an open sound, or the reverse, nor from a surd sound to a  sonant, or the reverse.  _L, m, n,_ and _r_ are called liquids, and easily  combine with other consonants; and so do the sibilants (_s, z,_ etc.).  In the growth of the language, many changes have been made in letters to  secure harmony of sound (as changing _b_ to _p_ in _sub-port---support,_  and _s,_ to _f_ in _differ_---from _dis_ and _fero_).  Some combinations  are not possible of pronunciation, others are not natural or easy; and  hence the alterations.  The student of the language must know how words are  built; and then when he comes to a strange word he can reconstruct it for  himself.  While the short, common words may be irregular, the long, strange  words are almost always formed quite regularly.    Most of the sonants have but one sound, and none of them has more than  three sounds.  The most important variations are as follows:    C and G have each a soft sound and a hard sound.  The soft sound of _c_ is the same as _s,_ and the hard sound the same  as _k_.  The soft sound of _g_ is the same as _j,_ and the hard sound  is the true sound of _g_ as heard in _gone, bug, struggle_.    Important Rule.  _C_ and _G_ are soft before _e, i,_ and _y,_  and hard before all the other vowels, before all the other consonants,  and at the end of words.    The chief exceptions to this rule are a few common words in which _g_  is hard before _e_ or _i_.  They include---_give, get, gill, gimlet,  girl, gibberish, gelding, gerrymander, gewgaw, geyser, giddy,  gibbon, gift, gig, giggle, gild, gimp, gingham, gird, girt,  girth, eager,_ and _begin_.  G is soft before a consonant in  _judgment{,} lodgment, acknowledgment,_ etc.  Also in a few  words from foreign languages _c_ is soft before other vowels,  though in such cases it should always be written with a cedilla (c).    N when marked n in words from the Spanish language is pronounced  _n-y_ (canon like _canyon_).    Ng has a peculiar nasal sound of its own, as heard in the syllable _ing_.    N alone also has the sound of _ng_ sometimes before _g_ and _k,_ as in  _angle, ankle, single,_ etc. (pronounced _ang-gle, ang-kle, sing-gle_).    Ph has the sound of _f,_ as in prophet.    Th has two sounds, a hard sound as in _the, than, bathe, scythe,_ etc.,  and a soft sound as in _thin, kith, bath, Smith,_ etc.  Contrast  _breathe_ and _breath, lath_ and _lathe_; and _bath_ and _baths,  lath_ and _laths,_ etc.    S has two sounds, one its own sound, as in _sin, kiss, fist_ (the same as  _c_ in _lace, rice,_ etc.), and the sound of _z,_ as in _rise_ (contrast  with _rice_), _is, baths, men's,_ etc.    X has two common sounds, one that of _ks_ as in _box, six,_ etc., and the  other the sound of _gs,_ as in _exact, exaggerate_ (by the way, the first  _g_ in this word is silent).  At the beginning of a word _x_ has the sound  of _z_ as in _Xerxes_.    Ch has three sounds, as heard first in _child,_ second in _machine,_ and  third in _character_.  The first is peculiar to itself, the second is that  of _sh,_ and the third that of _k_.    The sound of _sh_ is variously represented:    by _sh{,}_ as in _share, shift, shirt,_ etc.    by _ti,_ as in _condition, mention, sanction,_ etc.    by _si,_ as in _tension, suspension, extension,_ etc.    by _ci,_ as in _suspicion_.  (Also, _crucifixion_.)    The kindred sound of _zh_ is represented by _z_ as in _azure,_  and _s_ as in _pleasure,_ and by some combinations.    Y is always a consonant at the beginning of a word when followed by a  vowel, as in _yet, year, yell,_ etc.; but if followed by a consonant it  is a vowel, as in _Ypsilanti_.  At the end of a word it is {al}ways a  vowel, as in all words ending in the syllable _ly_.    Exercises.  It is very important that the student should master the  sounds of the language and the symbols for them, or the diacritical  marks, for several reasons:    First, because it is impossible to find out the true pronunciation of  a word from the dictionary unless one clearly understands the meaning  of the principal marks;    Second, because one of the essentials in accurate pronunciation and good  spelling is the habit of analyzing the sounds which compose words,  and training the ear to detect slight variations;    Third, because a thorough knowledge of the sounds and their natural  symbols is the first step toward a study of the principles governing  word formation, or spelling and pronunciation.    For purposes of instruction through correspondence or by means of a  textbook, the diacritical marks representing distinct sounds of the  language afford a substitute for the"]]]
