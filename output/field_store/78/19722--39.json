This being the case,  how can we account for the names of Paul and Peter, which, taken  separately, give great probability, and taken together give almost  absolute certainty, of having been adopted in remembrance of the two  apostles? One circumstance may help us to explain the case: the  preference shown for the name of Paul over that of Peter; the former  was borne by both father and son, the latter appears only as a surname  given to the son. This fact is not without importance, if we recollect  that the two men who show such partiality for the name of Paul belong  to the family of Anneus Seneca, the philosopher, whose friendship with  the apostle has been made famous by a tradition dating at least from  the beginning of the fourth century. The tradition rests on a  foundation of truth. The apostle was tried and judged in Corinth by  the proconsul Marcus Anneus Gallio, brother of Seneca; in Rome he was  handed over to Afranius Burro, prefect of the praetorium, and an  intimate friend of Seneca. We know, also, that the presence of the  prisoner, and his wonderful eloquence in preaching the new faith,  created a profound sensation among the members of the praetorium and of  the imperial household. His case must have been inquired into by the  philosopher himself, who happened to be _consul suffectus_ at the  time. The modest tombstone, discovered by accident among the ruins of  Ostia, gives us the evidence of the bond of sympathy and esteem  established, in consequence of these events, between the Annei and the  founders of the Church in Rome.    Its resemblance to the name of the Annei reminds me of another  remarkable discovery connected with the same city, and with the same  question. There lived at Ostia, towards the middle of the second  century, a manufacturer of pottery and terracottas, named Annius  Ser......, whose lamps were exported to many provinces of the empire.  These lamps are generally ornamented with the image of the Good  Shepherd; but they show also types which are decidedly pagan, such as  the labors of Hercules, Diana the huntress, etc. It has been surmised  that Annius Ser...... was converted to the gospel, and that the  adoption of the symbolic figure of the Redeemer on his lamps was a  result of his change of religion; but to explain the case it is not  necessary to accept this theory. I believe he was a pagan, and that  the lamps with the Good Shepherd were produced by him to order, and  from a design supplied to him by a member of the local congregation.    [Illustration: Lamp of Annius Ser......, with figure of the Good  Shepherd.]    Another question concerning the behavior of early Christians has  reference to their military service under the imperial eagles, and to  the cases of conscience which may have arisen from it. On this I may  refer the reader to the works of Mamachi, Lami, Baumgarten, Le Blant,  and de Rossi,[13] who have discussed the subject thoroughly. Speaking  from the point of view of material evidence, I have to record several  discoveries which prove that officers and men of the _cohortes  praetoriae_ and _urbanae_ could serve with equal loyalty their God and  their sovereign.    In November, 1885, I was present at the discovery of a marble  sarcophagus in the military burial-grounds of the Via Salaria,  opposite the gate of the Villa Albani. It bore two inscriptions,  one on the lid, the other on the body. The first defies  interpretation;[14] the second mentions the name of a little girl,  Publia AElia Proba, who was the daughter of a captain of the ninth  battalion of the praetorians, and a lady named Clodia Plautia. They  were all Christians; but for a reason unknown to us, they avoided  making a show of their persuasion, and were buried among the gentiles.    Another stray Christian military tomb, erected by a captain of the  sixth battalion, named Claudius Ingenuus, was found, in 1868, in the  Vigna Grandi, near S. Sebastiano. Here also we find the intention of  avoiding an open profession of faith. A regular cemetery of Christian  praetorians was found in the spring of the same year by Marchese  Francesco Patrizi, in his villa adjoining the praetorian camp. It is  neither large nor interesting, and it seems to prove that the gospel  must have made but few proselytes in the imperial barracks.           *       *       *       *       *    We must not believe that the transformation of Rome from a pagan into  a Christian city was a sudden and unexpected event, which took the  world by surprise. It was the natural result of the work of three  centuries, brought to maturity under Constantine by an inevitable  reaction against the violence of Diocletian's rule. It was not a  revolution or a conversion in the true sense of these words; it was  the official recognition of a state of things which had long ceased to  be a secret. The moral superiority of the new doctrines over the old  religions was so evident, so overpowering, that the result of the  struggle had been a foregone conclusion since the age of the first  apologists. The revolution was an exceedingly mild one, the  transformation almost imperceptible. No violence was resorted to, and  the tolerance and mutual benevolence so characteristic of the Italian  race was adopted as the fundamental policy of State and Church.    The transformation may be followed stage by stage in both its moral  and material aspect. There is not a ruin of ancient Rome that does not  bear evidence of the great change. Many institutions and customs still  flourishing in our days are of classical origin, and were adopted, or  tolerated, because they were not in opposition to Christian  principles. Beginning with the material side of the question, the  first monument to which I have to refer is the Arch of Constantine,  raised in 315 at the foot of the Palatine, where the Via Triumphalis  diverges from the Sacra Via.    The importance of this arch, from the point of view of the question  treated in this chapter, rests not on its sculptured panels and  medallions,--spoils taken at random from older structures, from which  the arch has received the nickname of AEsop's crow (_la cornacchia di  Esopo_),--but on the inscription engraved on each side of the attic.  \"The S. P. Q. R. have dedicated this triumphal arch to Constantine,  because _instinctu divinitatis_ (by the will of God), and by his own  virtue, etc., he has liberated the country from the tyrant [Maxentius]  and his faction.\" The opinion long prevailed among archaeologists that  the words _instinctu divinitatis_ were not original, but added after  Constantine's conversion. Cardinal Mai thought that the original  formula was _diis faventibus_, \"by the help of the gods,\" while Henzen  suggested _nutu Iovis optimi maximi_, \"by the will of Jupiter.\"  Cavedoni was the first to declare that the inscription had never been  altered, and that the two memorable words--the first proclaiming  officially the name of the true God in the face of imperial  Rome--belonged to the original text, sanctioned by the Senate. The  controversy was settled in 1863, when Napoleon III. obtained from the  Pope the permission to make a plaster cast of the arch. With the help  of the scaffolding, the scholars of the time examined the inscription,  the shape of each letter, the holes of the bolts by which the  gilt-bronze letters were fastened, the joints of the marble blocks,  the color and quality of the marble, and decided unanimously that the  inscription had never been tampered with, and that none of its letters  had been changed.    [Illustration: ARCH OF CONSTANTINE]    The arch was raised in 315. Was Constantine openly professing his  faith at that time? Opinions are divided. Some think he must have  waited until the defeat of Licinius in 323; others suggest the year  311 as a more probable date of his profession. The supporters of the  first theory quote in its favor the fact that the pagan symbols and  images of gods appear on coins struck by Constantine and his sons; but  this fact is easily explained, when we consider that the coinage of  bronze was a privilege of the Senate, and that the Senate was pagan by  a large majority. Many of Constantine's constitutions and official  letters speak in favor of an early declaration of faith. When the  Donatists appealed to him from the verdict of the councils of Arles  and Rome, he wrote to the bishops: _Meum judicium postulant, qui ipse  judicium Christi expecto_: \"They appeal to me, when I myself must be  judged by Christ.\" The verdict of the council of Rome against the  sectarians was rendered on October 2, 313, in the \"palace of Fausta in  the Lateran;\" the imperial palace of the Lateran, therefore, had  already been handed over to the bishop of Rome, and a portion of it  turned into a place of worship. The basilica of the Lateran still  retains its title of \"Mother and head of all churches of Rome, and of  the world,\" ranking above those of S. Peter and S. Paul in respect to  age.    Such being the state of affairs when the triumphal arch was erected,  nothing prevents us from believing those two words to be original, and  to express the relations then existing between the first Christian  emperor and the old pagan Senate. At all events, nothing is more  uncompromising than these two words, because the titles of _Deus  summus, Deus altissimus, magnus, aeternus_, are constantly found on  monuments pertaining to the worship of Atys and Mithras. \"These  words,\" concludes de Rossi, \"far from being a profession of  Christianity engraved on the arch at a later period, are simply a  'moyen terme,' a compromise, between the feelings of the Senate and  those of the emperor.\"[15]    Many facts related by contemporary documents prove that the change of  religion was, at the beginning, a personal affair with the emperor,  and not a question of state; the emperor was a Christian, but the old  rules of the empire were not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22157"],[0,"Lectures on Stellar Statistics (#5)"],[1,"being a tolerably well-known function of  the spectral-index, the latter can also be found. This method was first  proposed by HERTZSPRUNG and has been extensively used by BERGSTRAND,  LUNDMARK and LINDBLAD at the observatory of Upsala and by others.      15. _Colour-index._ We have already pointed out in Sec.9 that the colour  may be identified with the mean wave-length ([lambda]_0). As further  [lambda]_0 is closely connected with the spectral index (_s_), we may  use the spectral index to represent the colour. Instead of _s_ there may  also be used another expression for the colour, called the colour-index.  This expression was first introduced by SCHWARZSCHILD, and is defined in  the following way.    We have seen that the zero-point of the photographic scale is chosen in  such a manner that the visual magnitude _m_ and the photographic  magnitude _m'_ coincide for stars of spectral index 0.0 (A0). The  photographic magnitudes are then unequivocally determined. It is found  that their values systematically differ from the visual magnitudes, so  that for type B (and O) the photographic magnitudes are smaller than the  visual, and the contrary for the other types. The difference is greatest  for the M-type (still greater for the N-stars, though here for the  present only a few determinations are known), for which stars if amounts  to nearly two magnitudes. So much fainter is a red star on a  photographic plate than when observed with the eye.    _The difference between the photographic and the visual magnitudes is  called the colour-index (_c_)._ The correlation between this index and  the spectral-index is found to be rather high (_r_ = +0.96). In L. M.  II, 19 I have deduced the following tables giving the spectral-type  corresponding to a given colour-index, and inversely.

This may  be considered as known (taking into account the high coefficient of  correlation between _s_ and _c_) as soon as we know the spectral type of  the star. We may conclude directly that the number of stars having a  photographic magnitude brighter than 6.0 is considerably smaller than  the number of stars visually brighter than this magnitude. There are,  indeed, 4701 stars for which _m_ < 6.0 and 2874 stars having _m'_ < 6.0.      16. _Radial velocity of the stars._ From the values of [alpha] and  [delta] at different times we obtain the components of the proper  motions of the stars perpendicular to the line of sight. The third  component (_W_), in the radial direction, is found by the DOPPLER  principle, through measuring the displacement of the lines in the  spectrum, this displacement being towards the red or the violet  according as the star is receding from or approaching the observer.    The velocity _W_ will be expressed in siriometers per stellar year  (sir./st.) and alternately also in km./sec. The rate of conversion of  these units is given in Sec.5.      17. Summing up the remarks here given on the apparent attributes of the  stars we find them referred to the following principal groups:--    I. _The position of the stars_ is here generally given in galactic  longitude (_l_) and latitude (_b_). Moreover their equatorial  coordinates ([alpha] and [delta]) are given in an abridged notation  ([alpha][delta]), where the first four numbers give the right ascension  in hours and minutes and the last two numbers give the declination in  degrees, the latter being printed in italics if the declination is  negative.    Eventually the position is given in galactic squares, as defined in Sec.2.    II. _The apparent motion of the stars_ will be given in radial  components (_W_) expressed in sir./st. and their motion perpendicular to  the line of sight. These components will be expressed in one component  (_u_0_) parallel to the galactic plane, and one component (_v_0_)  perpendicular to it. If the distance (_r_) is known we are able to  convert these components into components of the linear velocity  perpendicular to the line of sight (_U_ and _V_).    III. _The intensity of the light_ of the stars is expressed in  magnitudes. We may distinguish between the _apparent_ magnitude (_m_)  and the _absolute_ magnitude (_M_), the latter being equal to the value  of the apparent magnitude supposing the star to be situated at a  distance of one siriometer.    The apparent magnitude may be either the _photographic_ magnitude  (_m'_), obtained from a photographic plate, or the _visual_ magnitude  (_m_) obtained with the eye.    The difference between these magnitudes is called the _colour-index_  (_c_ = _m'_-_m_).    IV. _The characteristics of the stellar radiation_ are the mean  wave-length ([lambda]_0) and the dispersion ([sigma]) in the  wave-length. _The mean wave-length_ may be either directly determined  (perhaps as _effective_ wave-length) or found from the spectral type  (spectral index) or from the colour-index.    There are in all eight attributes of the stars which may be found from  the observations:--the spherical position of the star (_l_, _b_), its  distance (_r_), proper motion (_u_0_ and _v_0_), radial velocity (_W_),  apparent magnitude (_m_ or _m'_), absolute magnitude (_M_), spectral  type (_Sp_) or spectral index (_s_), and colour-index (_c_). Of these  the colour-index, the spectral type, the absolute magnitude and also (to  a certain degree) the radial velocity may be considered as independent  of the place of the observer and may therefore be considered not as only  apparent but also as _absolute_ attributes of the stars.    Between three of these attributes (_m_, _M_ and _r_) a mathematical  relation exists so that one of them is known as soon as the other two  have been found from observations.

In this chapter I shall give a short account of the publications in  which the most complete information on the attributes of the stars may  be obtained, with short notices of the contents and genesis of these  publications. It is, however, not my intention to give a history of  these researches. We shall consider more particularly the questions  relating to the position of the stars, their motion, magnitude, and  spectra.      19. _Place of the stars._ _Durchmusterungs._ The most complete data on  the position of the stars are obtained from the star catalogues known as  \"Durchmusterungs\". There are two such catalogues, which together cover  the whole sky, one--visual--performed in Bonn and called the _Bonner  Durchmusterung_ (B. D.), the other--photographic--performed in Cape _The  Cape Photographic Durchmusterung_ (C. P. D.). As the first of these  catalogues has long been--and is to some extent even now--our principal  source for the study of the sky and is moreover the first enterprise of  this kind, I shall give a somewhat detailed account of its origin and  contents, as related by ARGELANDER in the introduction to the B. D.    B. D. was planned and performed by the Swedish-Finn ARGELANDER (born in  Memel 1799). A scholar of BESSEL he was first called as director in Abo,  then in Haelsingfors, and from there went in 1836 to Bonn, where in the  years 1852 to 1856 he performed this great _Durchmusterung_. As  instrument he used a FRAUENHOFER comet-seeker with an aperture of 76 mm,  a focal length of 650 mm, and 10 times magnifying power. The field of  sight had an extension of 6 deg..    In the focus of the objective was a semicircular piece of thin glass,  with the edge (= the diameter of the semicircle) parallel to the circle  of declination. This edge was sharply"]]]
