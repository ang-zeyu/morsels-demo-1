In December it becomes very cold and so much of the  stream is in shade during a large part of the day that much of the water  becomes frozen and, as it were, held in place. In the warm parts of the  day, and in the sunshine, the ice is melted, the stream resumes its  flow, and so gradually pushes its way farther and farther down the  canyon. But some sections, less exposed to warmth than others, retain  their ice during the day. These points are flooded by the water from  above, which is again frozen during the night and again flooded the next  day, and so on. In a short time great fields of smooth ice are formed,  which render travel on horseback very difficult and even dangerous.  This, and the scant grazing afforded by the bottom lands in winter,  doubtless is the cause of the annual migration of the Navaho; but these  conditions would not materially affect a people living in the canyon who  did not possess or were but scantily supplied with horses and sheep. The  stream when it is flowing is seldom more than a foot deep, generally  only a few inches, except in times of flood, when it becomes a raging  torrent, carrying everything before it. Hence irrigation would be  impracticable, even if its principles were known, nor is it essential  here to successful horticulture.    One of the characteristic features of the canyons at the present day is  the immense number of peach trees within them. Wherever there is a  favorable site, in some sheltered cove or little branch canyon, there is  a clump of peach trees, in some instances perhaps as many as 1,000 in  one \"orchard.\" When the peaches ripen, hundreds and even thousands of  Navaho flock to the place, coming from all over the reservation, like an  immense flock of vultures, and with disastrous results to the food  supply. A few months after it is difficult to procure even a handful of  dried fruit. The peach trees are, of course, modern. They were  introduced into this country originally by the Spanish monks, but in De  Chelly there are not more than two or three trees which are older than  the last Navaho war. At that time, it is said, the soldiers cut down  every peach tree they could find. But, aside from the peaches, De Chelly  was until recently the great agricultural center of the Navaho tribe,  and large quantities of corn, melons, pumpkins, beans, etc, were and are  raised there every year. Under modern conditions many other localities  now vie with it, and some surpass it in output of agricultural products,  but not many years ago De Chelly was regarded as the place par  excellence.    It will be clear, therefore, that prior to very recent times De Chelly  would be selected by almost any tribe moving across the country, and,  barring a hostile prior occupancy, would be the most desirable place for  the pursuit of horticultural operations for many miles in any direction.  The vicinity of the Tunicha mountains, which could be reached in half a  day from any part of the canyons, and which must have abounded in game,  for even now some is found there, would be a material advantage. The  position of the canyon in the heart of the plateau country and of the  ancient pueblo region would make it a natural stopping place during any  migratory movement either north and south or east and west, and its  settlement was doubtless due to this favorable position and to the  natural advantages it offered. This settlement was effected probably not  by one band or tribe, nor at one time, but by many bands at many times.  Probably the first settlements were very old; certainly the last were  very recent.          CLASSIFICATION AND DESCRIPTIONS      RUINS OF THE PUEBLO REGION    No satisfactory general classification of the ruins of the ancient  pueblo region has yet been made; possibly because the material in hand  is not sufficiently abundant. There are thousands of ruins scattered  over the southwest, of many different types which merge more or less  into each other. In 1884 Mr A. F. Bandelier, whose knowledge of the  archeology of the southwest is very extensive, formulated a  classification, and in 1892, in his final report,[11] he announces that  he has nothing to change in it. The classification is as follows:    I. Large communal houses several stories high.      (_a_) Composed of one or two, seldom three, extensive buildings,    generally so disposed as to surround an interior court.      (_b_) Polygonal pueblos.      (_c_) Scattered pueblos, composed of a number of large many-storied    houses, disposed in a more or less irregular manner; sometimes in    irregular squares or on a line.      (_d_) Artificial caves, resembling in number, size, and disposition    of the cells the many-storied communal dwelling.      (_e_) Many-storied dwellings, with artificial walls, erected inside    of natural caves of great size.    II. Detached family dwellings, either isolated or in groups forming  villages.        [Footnote 11: Arch. Inst. of America, 5th Ann. Rept., p. 55; and      Arch. Inst. of America, Papers, American series, IV, p. 27.]    Many hundreds of ruins have been examined by Mr Bandelier, and doubtless  the classification above afforded a convenient working basis for the  region with which he is most familiar, the basin of the Rio Grande and  its tributaries. It does not apply very well to the western part of the  pueblo region.    The distinguishing characteristics of the first group (of five  classes)--houses several stories high--are as follows: Each building  consisted of an agglomeration of a great number of small cells, without  any larger halls of particularly striking dimensions. All the buildings,  except outhouses or additions, were at least two stories high, and the  lower story was entered only from the roof. The various stories receded  from the bottom to the top. The prevalence of the estufa (kiva)  generally, or often, circular in form.    Ruins of class II--detached family dwellings--consist sometimes of a  single room; more often of several rooms. The rooms are generally built  of stone, although examples constructed of mud and adobe are also found  in certain regions. The average size of the room is larger than in the  communal building, and there is a gradual increase in size of rooms from  north to south. There are front doorways and light and air holes are  larger than in the communal houses. Mr Bandolier suggests that the  detached family dwelling was the early type, and that only when enemies  began to threaten were the communal houses resorted to for purposes of  defense.    This classification is apparently based on external form alone, without  taking into account the numerous influences which modify or produce  form; and while no doubt it was sufficient for field use, it is not  likely to be permanently adopted; for there does not appear to be any  essential or radical difference between the various classes. Moreover,  there does not appear to be any place in the scheme for the cliff ruins  of the variety especially abundant in De Chelly and found in many other  localities, unless indeed such ruins come under class II--detached  family dwellings; yet this would imply precedence in time, and the ruins  themselves will not permit such an inference.    The essential uniformity of types which prevails over the immense area  covered by the ancient pueblo ruins is a noteworthy feature, and any  system of classification which does not take it into account must be  considered as only tentative. What elements should be considered and  what weight assigned to each in preparing a scheme of classification is  yet to be determined, but probably one of the most important elements is  the character of the site occupied, with reference to its convenience  and defensibility. There are great differences in kind between the great  valley pueblos, located without reference to defense and depending for  security on their size and the number of their population, of which Zuni  and Taos are examples, and the villages which are located on high mesas  and projecting tongues of rock; in other words, on defensive sites where  reliance for security was placed on the character of the site occupied,  such as the Tusayan villages of today. Within each of these classes  there are varieties, and there are also secondary types which pertain  sometimes to one, sometimes to the other, and sometimes to both. Such  are the cliff ruins, the cavate lodges, and the single house remains.    The unit of pueblo architecture is the single cell, and in its  development the highest point reached is the aggregation of a great  number of such cells into one or more clusters, either connected with or  adjacent to each other. These cells were all the same, or essentially  so; for while differentiation in use or function had been or was being  developed at the time of the Spanish conquest, differentiation in form  had not been reached. The kiva, of circular or rectangular shape, is a  survival and not a development.    Large aggregations of many cells into one cluster are the latest  development of pueblo architecture. They were immediately preceded by a  type composed of a larger number of smaller villages, located on sites  selected with reference to their ease of defense, and apparently the  change from the latter to the former type was made at one step, without  developing any intermediate forms. The differences between the largest  examples of villages on defensive sites and the smallest appear to be  only differences of size. Doubtless in the early days of pueblo  architecture small settlements were the rule. Probably these settlements  were located in the valleys, on sites most convenient for horticulture,  each gens"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19726"],[0,"The Door Through Space (#5)"],[1,"the time of the riots in Charin.\"    She nodded. \"Yes. He was away in Charin when the Ghost Wind blew, and he  came back with knife cuts in his thigh. I asked if he had been mixed-up  in the anti-Terran rioting, but he wouldn't tell me. Race, I don't know  anything about politics. I don't really care. But just about that time,  the Great House in Shainsa changed hands. I'm sure Rakhal had something  to do with that.    \"And then--\" Juli twisted her chained hands together in her lap--\"he  tried to mix Rindy up in it. It was crazy, awful! He'd brought her some  sort of nonhuman toy from one of the lowland towns, Charin I think. It  was a weird thing, scared me. But he'd sit Rindy down in the sunlight  and have her look into it, and Rindy would gabble all sorts of nonsense  about little men and birds and a toymaker.\"    The chains about Juli's wrists clashed as she twisted her hands  together. I stared somberly at the fetters. The chain, which was long,  did not really hamper her movements much. Such chains were symbolic  ornaments, and most Dry-town women went all their lives with fettered  hands. But even after the years I'd spent in the Dry-towns, the sight  still brought an uneasiness to my throat, a vague discomfort.    \"We had a terrible fight over that,\" Juli went on. \"I was afraid, afraid  of what it was doing to Rindy. I threw it out, and Rindy woke up and  screamed--\" Juli checked herself and caught at vanishing self-control.    \"But you don't want to hear about that. It was then I threatened to  leave him and take Rindy. The next day--\" Suddenly the hysteria Juli had  been forcing back broke free, and she rocked back and forth in her  chair, shaken and strangled with sobs. \"He took Rindy! Oh, Race, he's  crazy, crazy. I think he hates Rindy, he--he, Race, _he smashed her  toys_. He took every toy the child had and broke them one by one,  smashed them into powder, every toy the child had--\"    \"Juli, please, please,\" Magnusson pleaded, shaken. \"If we're dealing  with a maniac--\"    \"I don't dare think he'd harm her! He warned me not to come here, or I'd  never see her again, but if it meant war against Terra I had to come.  But Mack, please, don't do anything against him, please, please. He's  got my baby, he's got my little girl....\" Her voice failed and she  buried her face in her hands.    Mack picked up the solidopic cube of his five-year-old son, and turned  it between his pudgy fingers, saying unhappily, \"Juli, we'll take every  precaution. But can't you see, we've got to get him? If there's a  question of a matter transmitter, or anything like that, in the hands of  Terra's enemies--\"    I could see that, too, but Juli's agonized face came between me and the  picture of disaster. I clenched my fist around the chair arm, not  surprised to see the fragile plastic buckle, crack and split under my  grip. _If it had been Rakhal's neck...._    \"Mack, let me handle this. Juli, shall I find Rindy for you?\"    A hope was born in her ravaged face, and died, while I looked. \"Race,  he'd kill you. Or have you killed.\"    \"He'd try,\" I admitted. The moment Rakhal knew I was outside the Terran  zone, I'd walk with death. I had accepted the code during my years in  Shainsa. But now I was an Earthman and felt only contempt.    \"Can't you see? Once he knows I'm at large, that very code of his will  force him to abandon any intrigue, whatever you call it, conspiracy, and  come after me first. That way we do two things: we get him out of  hiding, and we get him out of the conspiracy, if there is one.\"    I looked at the shaking Juli and something snapped. I stooped and lifted  her, not gently, my hands biting her shoulders. \"And I won't kill him,  do you hear? He may wish I had; by the time I get through with him--I'll  beat the living hell out of him; I'll cram my fists down his throat. But  I'll settle it with him like an Earthman. I won't kill him. _Hear me,  Juli?_ Because that's the worst thing I could do to him--catch him and  let him live afterward!\"    Magnusson stepped toward me and pried my crushing hands off her arms.  Juli rubbed the bruises mechanically, not knowing she was doing it. Mack  said, \"You can't do it, Cargill. You wouldn't get as far as Daillon. You  haven't been out of the zone in six years. Besides--\"    His eyes rested full on my face. \"I hate to say this, Race, but damn it,  man, go and take a good look at yourself in a mirror. Do you think I'd  ever have pulled you off the Secret Service otherwise? How in hell can  you disguise yourself now?\"    \"There are plenty of scarred men in the Dry-towns,\" I said. \"Rakhal will  remember my scars, but I don't think anyone else would look twice.\"    Magnusson walked to the window. His huge form bulked against the light,  perceptibly darkening the office. He looked over the faraway panorama,  the neat bright Trade City below and the vast wilderness lying outside.  I could almost hear the wheels grinding in his head. Finally he swung  around.    \"Race, I've heard these rumors before. But you're the only man I could  have sent to track them down, and I wouldn't send you out in cold blood  to be killed. I won't now. Spaceforce will pick him up.\"    I heard the harsh inward gasp of Juli's breath and said, \"Damn it, no.  The first move you make--\" I couldn't finish. Rindy was in his hands,  and when I knew Rakhal, he hadn't been given to making idle threats. We  all three knew what Rakhal might do at the first hint of the long arm of  Terran law reaching out for him.    I said, \"For God's sake let's keep Spaceforce out of it. Let it look  like a personal matter between Rakhal and me, and let us settle it on  those terms. Remember he's got the kid.\"    Magnusson sighed. Again he picked up one of the cubes and stared into  the clear plastic, where the three-dimensional image of a nine-year-old  girl looked out at him, smiling and innocent. His face was transparent  as the plastic cube. Mack acts tough, but he has five kids and he is as  soft as a dish of pudding where a kid is concerned.    \"I know. Another thing, too. If we send out Spaceforce, after all the  riots--how many Terrans are on this planet? A few thousand, no more.  What chance would we have, if it turned into a full-scale rebellion?  None at all, unless we wanted to order a massacre. Sure, we have bombs  and dis-guns and all that.    \"But would we dare to use them? And where would we be after that? We're  here to keep the pot from boiling over, to keep out of planetary  incidents, not push them along to a point where bluff won't work. That's  why we've got to pick up Rakhal before this gets out of hand.\"    I said, \"Give me a month. Then you can move in, if you have to. Rakhal  can't do much against Terra in that time. And I might be able to keep  Rindy out of it.\"    Magnusson stared at me, hard-eyed. \"If you do this against my advice, I  won't be able to step in and pull you out of a jam later on, you know.  And God help you if you start up the machines and can't stop them.\"    I knew that. A month wasn't much. Wolf is forty thousand miles of  diameter, at least half unexplored; mountain and forest swarming with  nonhuman and semi-human cities where Terrans had never been.    Finding Rakhal, or any one man, would be like picking out one star in  the Andromeda nebula. Not impossible. Not _quite_ impossible.    Mack's eyes wandered again to his child's face, deep in the transparent  cube. He turned it in his hands. \"Okay, Cargill,\" he said slowly, \"so  we're all crazy. I'll be crazy too. Try it your way.\"          CHAPTER FOUR      By sunset I was ready to leave. I hadn't had any loose ends to tie up in  the Trade City, since I'd already disposed of most of my gear before  boarding the starship. I'd never been in better circumstances to take  off for parts unknown.    Mack, still disapproving, had opened the files to me, and I'd spent most  of the day in the back rooms of Floor 38, searching Intelligence files  to refresh my memory, scanning the pages of my own old reports sent  years ago from Shainsa and Daillon. He had sent out one of the nonhumans  who worked for us, to buy or acquire somewhere in the Old Town a  Dry-towner's outfit and the other things I would wear and carry.    I would have liked to go myself. I felt that I needed the practice. I  was only now beginning to realize how much I might have forgotten in the  years behind a desk. But until I was ready to make my presence known, no  one must know that Race Cargill had not left Wolf on the starship.    Above all, I must not be seen in the Kharsa until I went there in the  Dry-town disguise which had become, years ago, a deep second nature,  almost an alternate personality.    About sunset I walked through the clean little streets of the Terran  Trade City toward the Magnusson home where Juli was waiting for me.    Most of the men who go into Civil Service of the Empire come from Earth,  or from the close-in planets of Proxima and Alpha Centaurus. They go out  unmarried, and they stay that way, or marry women native to the planets  where they are sent.    But Joanna Magnusson was one of the rare Earth women who had come out  with her husband, twenty years ago. There are two kinds of Earthwomen  like that. They make their quarterings a little bit of home, or a little  bit of hell. Joanna had made their house look like a transported corner  of Earth.    I never knew quite what to think of the Magnusson household. It seemed  to me almost madness to live under a red sun, yet come inside to yellow  light, to live on a world with the wild beauty of Wolf and yet live as  they might have lived on their home planet. Or maybe I was the one who  was out of step. I had done the reprehensible thing they called \"going  native.\" Possibly I had done just that, and in absorbing myself into the  new world, had lost the ability to fit into the old.    Joanna, a chubby comfortable woman in her forties, opened the door and  gave me her hand. \"C"]]]
