Algeria has the fifth-largest  reserves of natural gas in the world and is the second largest gas  exporter; it ranks fourteenth for oil reserves. Algiers' efforts to  reform one of the most centrally planned economies in the Arab world  began after the 1986 collapse of world oil prices plunged the country  into a severe recession. In 1989, the government launched a  comprehensive, IMF-supported program to achieve economic stabilization  and to introduce market mechanisms into the economy. Despite  substantial progress toward economic adjustment, in 1992 the reform  drive stalled as Algiers became embroiled in political turmoil. In  September 1993, a new government was formed, and one priority was the  resumption and acceleration of the structural adjustment process.  Burdened with a heavy foreign debt, Algiers concluded a one-year  standby arrangement with the IMF in April 1994 and the following year  signed onto a three-year extended fund facility. Progress on economic  reform, a Paris Club debt rescheduling in 1995, and oil and gas sector  expansion have contributed to a recovery since 1995. Investments in  developing hydrocarbon resources are likely to maintain growth and  export earnings. Continuing but gradual government efforts to attract  foreign and domestic investment outside that sector seek to diversify  the economy and tackle problems of high unemployment and falling  living standards, problems as yet untouched by the macroeconomic  turnaround.

In the practical prosecution of this scheme of evangelization, it was  found necessary to the due training of the Indians in the holy faith  that they should be enslaved, whether or no. It was on this religious  consideration, clearly laid down in a report of the king's chaplains,  that the atrocious system of _encomiendas_ was founded.

THE PROJECT OF FRENCH EMPIRE AND EVANGELIZATION--ITS WIDE AND RAPID  SUCCESS--ITS SUDDEN EXTINCTION.      For a full century, from the discovery of the New World until the first  effective effort at occupation by any other European people, the Spanish  church and nation had held exclusive occupancy of the North American  continent. The Spanish enterprises of conquest and colonization had been  carried forward with enormous and unscrupulous energy, and alongside of  them and involved with them had been borne the Spanish chaplaincies and  missions, sustained from the same treasury, in some honorable instances  bravely protesting against the atrocities they were compelled to  witness, in other instances implicated in them and sharing the bloody  profits of them. But, unquestionable as was the martial prowess of the  Spanish soldier and adventurer, and the fearless devotion of the Spanish  missionary, there appears nothing like systematic planning in all these  immense operations. The tide of conquest flowed in capricious courses,  according as it was invited by hopes of gold or of a passage to China,  or of some phantom of a Fountain of Youth or a city of Quivira or a  Gilded Man; and it seemed in general to the missionary that he could not  do else than follow in the course of conquest.    It is wholly characteristic of the French people that its entering at  last upon enterprises of colonization and missions should be with large  forecasting of the future and with the methods of a grand strategy.    We can easily believe that the famous \"Bull of Partition\" of Pope  Alexander VI. was not one of the hindrances that so long delayed the  beginnings of a New France in the West. Incessant dynastic wars with  near neighbors, the final throes of the long struggle between the crown  and the great vassals, and finally the religious wars that culminated in  the awful slaughter of St. Bartholomew's, and ended at the close of the  century with the politic conversion and the coronation of Henry  IV.--these were among the causes that had held back the great nation  from distant undertakings. But thoughts of great things to be achieved  in the New World had never for long at a time been absent from the minds  of Frenchmen. The annual visits of the Breton fishing-fleets to the  banks of Newfoundland kept in mind such rights of discovery as were  alleged by France, and kept attention fixed in the direction of the  great gulf and river of St. Lawrence. Long before the middle of the  sixteenth century Jacques Cartier had explored the St. Lawrence beyond  the commanding position which he named Montreal, and a royal commission  had issued, under which he was to undertake an enterprise of \"discovery,  settlement, and the conversion of the Indians.\" But it was not till the  year 1608 that the first permanent French settlement was effected. With  the _coup d'oeil_ of a general or the foresight of a prophet,  Champlain, the illustrious first founder of French empire in America, in  1608 fixed the starting-point of it at the natural fortress of Quebec.  How early the great project had begun to take shape in the leading minds  of the nation it may not be easy to determine. It was only after the  adventurous explorations of the French pioneers, traders, and  friars--men of like boundless enthusiasm and courage--had been crowned  by the achievement of La Salle, who first of men traversed the two great  waterways of the continent from the Gulf of St. Lawrence to the Gulf of  Mexico, that the amazing possibilities of it were fully revealed. But,  whosesoever scheme it was, a more magnificent project of empire, secular  and spiritual, has never entered into the heart of man. It seems to have  been native to the American soil, springing up in the hearts of the  French pioneer explorers themselves;[18:1] but by its grandeur, and at  the same time its unity, it was of a sort to delight the souls of Sully  and Richelieu and of their masters. Under thin and dubious claims by  right of discovery, through the immense energy and daring of her  explorers, the heroic zeal of her missionaries, and not so much by the  prowess of her soldiers as by her craft in diplomacy with savage tribes,  France was to assert and make good her title to the basin of the St.  Lawrence and the lakes, and the basin of the Mississippi and the Gulf of  Mexico. From the mouth of the St. Lawrence to the mouth of the  Mississippi, through the core of the continent, was to be drawn a cordon  of posts, military, commercial, and religious, with other outlying  stations at strategic points both eastward and westward. The only  external interference with this scheme that could be apprehended at its  inception was from the Spanish colonies, already decaying and shrinking  within their boundaries to the west and to the southeast, and from a  puny little English settlement started only a year before, with a  doubtful hold on life, on the bank of the James River. A dozen years  later a pitiably feeble company of Pilgrims shall make their landing at  Plymouth to try the not hopeful experiment of living in the wilderness,  and a settlement of Swedes in Delaware and of Hollanders on the Hudson  shall be added to the incongruous, unconcerted, mutually jealous  plantations that begin to take root along the Atlantic seaboard. Not  only grandeur and sagacity of conception, but success in achievement, is  illustrated by the comparative area occupied by the three great European  powers on the continent of North America at the end of a century and a  half from the founding of Quebec in 1608. Dividing the continent into  twenty-five equal parts, the French claimed and seemed to hold firmly in  possession twenty parts, the Spanish four parts, and the English one  part.[19:1]    The comparison between the Spanish and the French methods of  colonization and missions in America is at almost every point honorable  to the French. Instead of a greedy scramble after other men's property  in gold and silver, the business basis of the French enterprises was to  consist in a widely organized and laboriously prosecuted traffic in  furs. Instead of a series of desultory and savage campaigns of conquest,  the ferocity of which was aggravated by the show of zeal for the kingdom  of righteousness and peace, was a large-minded and far-sighted scheme of  empire, under which remote and hostile tribes were to be combined by  ties of mutual interest and common advantage. And the missions, instead  of following servilely in the track of bloody conquest to assume the  tutelage of subjugated and enslaved races, were to share with the  soldier and the trader the perilous adventures of exploration, and not  so much to be supported and defended as to be themselves the support and  protection of the settlements, through the influence of Christian love  and self-sacrifice over the savage heart. Such elements of moral  dignity, as well as of imperial grandeur, marked the plans for the  French occupation of North America.    To a wonderful extent those charged with this enterprise were worthy of  the task. Among the military and civil leaders of it, from Champlain to  Montcalm, were men that would have honored the best days of French  chivalry. The energy and daring of the French explorers, whether traders  or missionaries, have not been equaled in the pioneer work of other  races. And the annals of Christian martyrdom may be searched in vain for  more heroic examples of devotion to the work of the gospel than those  which adorn the history of the French missions in North America. What  magnificent results might not be expected from such an enterprise, in  the hands of such men, sustained by the resources of the most powerful  nation and national church in Christendom!    From the founding of Quebec, in 1608, the expansion of the French  enterprise was swift and vast. By the end of fifty years Quebec had been  equipped with hospital, nunnery, seminary for the education of priests,  all affluently endowed from the wealth of zealous courtiers, and served  in a noble spirit of self-devotion by the choicest men and women that  the French church could furnish; besides these institutions, the  admirable plan of a training colony, at which converted Indians should  be trained to civilized life, was realized at Sillery, in the  neighborhood. The sacred city of Montreal had been established as a base  for missions to the remoter west. Long in advance of the settlement at  Plymouth, French Christianity was actively and beneficently busy among  the savages of eastern Maine, among the so-called \"neutral nations\" by  the Niagara, among the fiercely hostile Iroquois of northern New York,  by Lake Huron and Lake Nipissing, and, with wonderful tokens of success,  by the Falls of St. Mary. \"Thus did the religious zeal of the French  bear the cross to the banks of the St. Mary and the"]]]
