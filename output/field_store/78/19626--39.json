[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20390"],[0,"Elements of Structural and Systematic Botany (#5)"],[1,"bacteria (_Schizomycetes_), although among the commonest of  organisms, owing to their excessive minuteness, are difficult to  study, especially for the beginner. They resemble, in their general  structure and methods of reproduction, the blue-green slimes, but are,  with very few exceptions, destitute of chlorophyll, although often  possessing bright pigments,--blue, violet, red, etc. It is one of  these that sometimes forms blood-red spots in flour paste or bits of  bread that have been kept very moist and warm. They are universally  present where decomposition is going on, and are themselves the  principal agents of decay, which is the result of their feeding upon  the substance, as, like all plants without chlorophyll, they require  organic matter for food. Most of the species are very tenacious of  life, and may be completely dried up for a long time without dying,  and on being placed in water will quickly revive. Being so extremely  small, they are readily carried about in the air in their dried-up  condition, and thus fall upon exposed bodies, setting up decomposition  if the conditions are favorable.    A simple experiment to show this may be performed by taking two test  tubes and partly filling them with an infusion of almost any organic  substance (dried leaves or hay, or a bit of meat will answer). The  fluid should now be boiled so as to kill any germs that may be in it;  and while hot, one of the vessels should be securely stopped up with a  plug of cotton wool, and the other left open. The cotton prevents  access of all solid particles, but allows the air to enter. If proper  care has been taken, the infusion in the closed vessel will remain  unchanged indefinitely; but the other will soon become turbid, and a  disagreeable odor will be given off. Microscopic examination shows the  first to be free from germs of any kind, while the second is swarming  with various forms of bacteria.    [Illustration: FIG. 8.--Bacteria.]    These little organisms have of late years attracted the attention of  very many scientists, from the fact that to them is due many, if not  all, contagious diseases. The germs of many such diseases have been  isolated, and experiments prove beyond doubt that these are alone the  causes of the diseases in question.      If a drop of water containing bacteria is examined, we find them to    be excessively small, many of them barely visible with the strongest    lenses. The larger ones (Fig. 8) recall quite strongly the smaller    species of oscillaria, and exhibit similar movements. Others are so    small as to appear as mere lines and dots, even with the strongest    lenses. Among the common forms are small, nearly globular cells;    oblong, rod-shaped or thread-shaped filaments, either straight or    curved, or even spirally twisted. Frequently they show a quick    movement which is probably in all cases due to cilia, which are,    however, too small to be seen in most cases.    [Illustration: FIG. 9.--_Euglena_. _A_, individual in the active  condition. _E_, the red \"eye-spot.\" _c_, flagellum. _n_, nucleus. _B_,  resting stage. _C_, individual dividing, x 300.]    Reproduction is for the most part by simple transverse division, as in  oscillaria; but occasionally spores are produced also.      CLASS III.--GREEN MONADS (_Volvocineae_).    This group of the protophytes is unquestionably closely related to  certain low animals (_Monads_ or _Flagellata_), with which they are  sometimes united. They are characterized by being actively motile, and  are either strictly unicellular, or the cells are united by a  gelatinous envelope into a colony of definite form.    Of the first group, _Euglena_ (Fig. 9), may be selected as a type.      This organism is found frequently among other algae, and occasionally    forms a green film on stagnant water. It is sometimes regarded as a    plant, sometimes as an animal, and is an elongated, somewhat    worm-like cell without a definite cell wall, so that it can change    its form to some extent. The protoplasm contains oval masses, which    are bright green in color; but the forward pointed end of the cell    is colorless, and has a little depression. At this end there is a    long vibratile protoplasmic filament (_c_), by means of which the    cell moves. There is also to be seen near this end a red speck (_e_)    which is probably sensitive to light. A nucleus can usually be seen    if the cell is first killed with an iodine solution, which often    will render the flagellum (_c_) more evident, this being invisible    while the cell is in motion. The cells multiply by division.    Previous to this the flagellum is withdrawn, and a firm cell wall is    formed about the cell (Fig. 9, _B_). The contents then divide into    two or more parts, which afterwards escape as new individuals.    Of the forms that are united in colonies[2] one of the best known is  _Volvox_ (Fig. 10). This plant is sometimes found in quiet water,  where it floats on or near the surface as a dark green ball, just  large enough to be seen with the naked eye. They may be kept for some  time in aquaria, and will sometimes multiply rapidly, but are very  susceptible to extremes of temperature, especially of heat.    [2] The term \"colony\" is, perhaps, inappropriate, as the whole mass of  cells arises from a single one, and may properly be looked upon as an  individual plant.    [Illustration: FIG. 10.--_Volvox._ _A_, mature colony, containing  several smaller ones (_x_), x 50. _B_, Two cells showing the cilia,  x 300.]      The colony (Fig. 10, _A_) is a hollow sphere, the numerous green    cells of which it is composed forming a single layer on the outside.    By killing with iodine, and using a strong lens, each cell is seen    to be somewhat pear-shaped (Fig. _B_), with the pointed end out.    Attached to this end are two vibratile filaments (cilia or    _flagella_), and the united movements of these cause the rolling    motion of the whole colony. Usually a number of young colonies    (Fig. _x_) are found within the mother colony. These arise by the    repeated bipartition of a single cell, and escape finally, forming    independent colonies.      Another (sexual) form of reproduction occurs, similar to that found    in many higher plants; but as it only occurs at certain seasons, it    is not likely to be met with by the student.    Other forms related to _Volvox_, and sometimes met with, are  _Gonium_, in which there are sixteen cells, forming a flat square;  _Pandorina_ and _Eudorina_, with sixteen cells, forming an oval or  globular colony like _Volvox_, but much smaller. In all of these the  structure of the cells is essentially as in _Volvox_.          CHAPTER IV.    SUB-KINGDOM II.    ALGAE.[3]      [3] Algae (sing. _alga_).    In the second sub-kingdom of plants is embraced an enormous assemblage  of plants, differing widely in size and complexity, and yet showing a  sufficiently complete gradation from the lowest to the highest as to  make it impracticable to make more than one sub-kingdom to include  them. They are nearly all aquatic forms, although many of them will  survive long periods of drying, such forms occurring on moist earth,  rocks, or the trunks of trees, but only growing when there is a  plentiful supply of water.    All of them possess chlorophyll, which, however, in many forms, is  hidden by the presence of a brown or red pigment. They are ordinarily  divided into three classes--I. The Green Algae (_Chlorophyceae_);  II. Brown Algae (_Phaeophyceae_); III. Red Algae (_Rhodophyceae_).      CLASS I.--GREEN ALGAE.    The green algae are to be found almost everywhere where there is  moisture, but are especially abundant in sluggish or stagnant fresh  water, being much less common in salt water. They are for the most  part plants of simple structure, many being unicellular, and very few  of them plants of large size.    We may recognize five well-marked orders of the green algae--I. Green  slimes (_Protococcaceae_); II. _Confervaceae_; III. Pond scums  (_Conjugatae_); IV. _Siphoneae_; V. Stone-worts (_Characeae_).      ORDER I.--_Protococcaceae_.    The members of this order are minute unicellular plants, growing  either in water or on the damp surfaces of stones, tree trunks, etc.  The plants sometimes grow isolated, but usually the cells are united  more or less regularly into colonies.    A common representative of the order is the common green slime,  _Protococcus_ (Fig. 11, _A_, _C_), which forms a dark green slimy  coating over stones, tree trunks, flower pots, etc. Owing to their  minute size the structure can only be made out with the microscope.    [Illustration: FIG. 11.--_Protococcaceae._ _A_, _C_, Protococcus. _A_,  single cells. _B_, cells dividing by fission. _C_, successive steps in  the process of internal cell division.

When magnified, the green film is found to be composed    of minute globular cells of varying size, which may in places be    found to be united into groups. With a higher power, each cell    (Fig. 11, _A_) is seen to have a distinct cell wall, within which is    colorless protoplasm. Careful examination shows that the chlorophyll    is confined to several roundish bodies that are not usually in    immediate contact with the wall of the cell. These green masses are    called chlorophyll bodies (chloroplasts). Toward the centre of the    cell, especially if it has first been treated with iodine, the    nucleus may be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20394"],[0,"Correspondence Relating to Executions in Turkey for Apostacy from Islamism (#5)"],[1,"mais une  excuse.    Lors même que l'humanité, dont le nom n'a jamais été invoqué en vain  en France, n'aurait pas été aussi cruellement blessée par le  supplice de cet Arménien, lors même que le Gouvernement du Roi, qui  a toujours protégé, et protégera toujours la religion Chrétienne en  Orient, pourrait oublier que c'est le Christianisme qui a reçu ce  sanglant outrage, l'intérêt qu'il prend à l'Empire Ottoman et à son  indépendance, lui ferait encore voir avec une profonde douleur ce  qui vient de se passer.    Cette indépendance ne peut aujourd'hui trouver une garantie efficace  que dans l'appui de l'opinion Européenne. Les efforts du  Gouvernement du Roi ont constamment tendu à lui ménager cet appui.  Cette tâche lui deviendra bien plus difficile en présence d'un acte  qui soulevera dans l'Europe entière une indignation universelle.    Le Gouvernement du Roi croit accomplir un devoir impérieux en  faisant connaître à la Porte l'impression qu'il a reçue d'un fait  malheureusement irréparable, mais qui, s'il pouvait se renouveler,  serait de nature à appeler des dangers réels sur le Gouvernement  assez faible pour faire de telles concessions à un odieux et  déplorable fanatisme.    Le Soussigné, &c.,    (Translation.)                                      _Therapia, October_ 17, 1843.    The Undersigned, Minister Plenipotentiary of His Majesty the King of  the French at the Ottoman Porte, has received orders from his  Government to make the following communication to the Minister for  Foreign Affairs.    It has been with a painful astonishment that the King's Government  has learnt the late execution of an Armenian who, after embracing  the Musulman religion, returned to the faith of his fathers, and  who, for this act alone, has been capitally punished, because he  refused to redeem his life by a fresh recantation.    In vain can the imperious terms of the law be appealed to for an  explanation of so lamentable an act. It might have been supposed  that a system of law formed for other times had fallen into  desuetude; and at all events it was too easy to overlook such a  circumstance to admit of that which has happened being considered as  one of those lamentable cases of necessity, in which policy  sometimes finds not so much a justification as an excuse.    Even had not humanity, whose name has never been vainly invoked  in France, been so cruelly hurt by the punishment of this  Armenian,--even could the King's Government, which has always  protected, and ever will protect, the Christian religion in the  East, forget that it is Christianity which has been thus cruelly  outraged,--the interest which it takes in the Ottoman Empire and in  its independence would still cause it to behold what has occurred  with profound regret.    That independence can in these times find a real security only in  the support of the public opinion of Europe. The efforts of the  King's Government have been constantly directed towards obtaining  for it that support. This task will become much more difficult after  an act which will excite universal indignation throughout the whole  of Europe.    The King's Government considers that it discharges an imperious duty  in making known to the Porte the impression which has been made upon  it by an event unfortunately irreparable, and which, were it to  occur again, would be likely to cause real danger to a Government  weak enough to make such concessions to a hateful and lamentable  fanaticism.    The Undersigned, &c.,    Inclosure 2 in No. 8.    _Sir Stratford Canning to M. Pisani_.    Sir,                              _Buyukderé, October_ 30, 1843.    In presenting to the Minister for Foreign Affairs the accompanying  translation of an instruction addressed to me by the Earl of  Aberdeen, with reference to the Armenian who was lately executed at  Constantinople, you will be careful to impress his Excellency with a  conviction of the deep and painful sentiments excited throughout  Great Britain by that deplorable act.    You will require that the instruction be forthwith submitted not  only to his Highness the Grand Vizier, but also to His Imperial  Majesty the Sultan.    A copy of this letter, with a translation in Turkish, is to be left  with Rifaat Pasha.    (Signed) STRATFORD CANNING.              No. 9.      _Sir Stratford Canning to Mr. Addington_.--(_Received November_ 23.)    Sir,                              _Buyukderé, November_ 3, 1843.    A delay in the departure of the messenger affords me the opportunity  of transmitting to you at once the inclosed report addressed to me  to-day by M. Pisani. Though not official, it shews the strong  impression which has been made upon the Porte by a knowledge of the  sentiments entertained throughout Europe with reference to the  Armenian lately executed. The Porte will probably seek to avoid  replying ostensibly to the remonstrances of the several leading  Courts, but means will, no doubt, be taken to prevent the necessity  of practising such atrocities in future. A degree of success so  important, though limited, might reasonably encourage the allied  Courts to enter into a more complete understanding for the removal  of other blots from the legal or political practice of the Turks, in  their intercourse with Christians.    I have, &c.,    (Signed) STRATFORD CANNING.    Inclosure in No. 9.    _M. Pisani to Sir Stratford Canning_.    Excellence,                       _Péra, ce_ 3 _Novembre_, 1843.    J'ai conformément à vos ordres remis à Rifaat Pacha la traduction en  Turc des instructions du Comte d'Aberdeen et de la lettre de votre  Excellence, avec une copie de votre lettre.    Rifaat Pacha a lu la traduction des deux pièces qu'il a trouvées  très-importantes. Il m'a dit qu'il mettra les instructions de Lord  Aberdeen sous les yeux du Grand Vizir et du Sultan.    Rifaat Pacha m'a dit confidentiellement que les mesures qu'il est  question de prendre sont, d'ordonner à toutes les autorités à  Constantinople et dans les provinces, d'avoir désormais soin,  lorsqu'un Turc qui était Chrétien, se fait Chrétien de nouveau, et  lorsqu'un Turc dit des injures contre Mahomet ou contre les  Prophètes, ou vomit d'autres blasphèmes, de ne pas permettre qu'il  soit traduit et jugé devant un Mehkemé quelconque; mais si le cas  arrive à Constantinople, d'envoyer l'accusé à la Porte, et s'il  arrive dans un pays hors de Constantinople, de l'envoyer au Pacha de  la province, sans aucune espèce de jugement préalable. De cette  manière-ci, dit Rifaat Pacha, la Porte et les Pachas au-dehors  songeront aux moyens de terminer ces sortes d'affaires sans éclat,  et (j'ose inférer des paroles de son Excellence) sans recourir à la  peine capitale.    Rifaat Pacha a ajouté que la Porte ne peut faire aucune réponse par  écrit sur cette affaire sans se compromettre, soit vis-à-vis des  Puissances Chrétiennes, en disant qu'elle est obligée de mettre à  exécution la loi qui regarde les Chrétiens qui, après avoir embrassé  l'Islamisme de leur propre gré, y renoncent et redeviennent  Chrétiens, et qui encourent par là la peine de mort,--soit vis-à-vis  de la loi, en déclarant qu'elle ne sera pas exécutée à l'avenir dans  un cas semblable à celui de l'Arménien.    Mais Rifaat Pacha m'a paru convaincu qu'après le bruit que l'Europe  a fait, une scène semblable à celle de l'Arménien ne se renouvellera  point. Les mesures que le Gouvernement se propose de prendre ont  pour but d'éviter un jugement; et sans jugement on ne peut condamner  personne à mort. L'Arménien avait été jugé au Mehkemé dit du Stambol  Effendi, avant d'être envoyé à la Porte. Le Kiatib qui est en prison  pour avoir dit des injures contre Mahomet, a été jugé au Mehkemé de  Salonique, avant d'être envoyé à Constantinople; et le Conseil  suprême l'a déclaré digne de mort, quoiqu'il n'ait pas été  juridiquement et formellement condamné ici encore. La circonstance  que le Kiatib a été jugé déjà et convaincu d'avoir blasphémé le nom  de Mahomet, expose ses jours au plus grand danger.    J'ai l'honneur, &c.,    (Signé) FREDERIC PISANI.    (Translation.)    Excellency,                       _Pera, November_ 3, 1843.    In conformity with your orders, I placed in the hands of Rifaat  Pasha the Turkish translation of Lord Aberdeen's instructions and of  your Excellency's letter, with a copy of your letter.    Rifaat Pasha read the translation of the two documents which he  considered to be of great importance. He told me that he will lay  Lord Aberdeen's instructions before the Grand Vizier and the Sultan.    Rifaat Pasha told me confidentially that the measures which it is  proposed to take, are to order all the authorities at Constantinople  and and [sic] in the provinces henceforth to take care that when a  Turk who was a Christian, becomes again a Christian, and when a Turk  speaks insultingly of Mahomet or the Prophets, or utters other  blasphemies, he shall not be allowed to be given up to, and judged  by, any Mehkemé whatever; but if the case occurs at Constantinople,  the accused shall be sent to the Porte, or if it occurs in a  district beyond Constantinople, he shall be sent to the Pasha of the  province without any previous judgment. In this manner, said Rifaat  Pasha, the Porte and the provincial Pashas will devise means for  terminating affairs of this kind without noise, and (I venture to  infer from his Excellency's words) without having recourse to  capital punishment.    Rifaat Pasha added, that the Porte can give no written answer  respecting this affair without compromising itself either as regards  the Christian Powers, by stating that it is forced to execute the  law regarding Christians who, after having of their own accord  embraced Islamism, renounce it and become Christians again, and thus  incur capital punishment,--or as regards the law, by declaring that  it will not for the future be executed in cases similar to that of  the Armenian.    Rifaat Pasha, however, seemed to me "]]]
