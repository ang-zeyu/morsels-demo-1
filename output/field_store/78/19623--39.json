Leland's other carnary, which must not be confused with this, was  attached to a chapel \"on the north side of S. Mary Abbey church at  Winchester, in an area thereby, on which men entre by a certen steppes.  One Inkepenne, a gentilman that berith in his shield a scheker sylver  and sables, was founder of it. There be three tumbes of marble of  prestes _custodes_ of the chapelle.\"    Among the old houses which have vanished from the close is one in which  Charles II. in vain requested Bishop Ken to allow Nell Gwynne to lodge;  and one which was erected for her and not pulled down until this  century. The cathedral precincts, however, still contain on the southern  side several buildings well worthy of notice. A picturesque house yet  standing is that which was known by the name of Cheyney Court. It now  serves as a porter's lodge, and stands by the wooden-doored gateway  which opens into Kingsgate Street. The doors are supposed to have come  down to us from the thirteenth century. Previously this lodge was the  courthouse of the Soke of Winchester, and the centre of the episcopal  jurisdiction here. The old timbered front, with its barge-boards, was in  1886 concealed behind a rough-cast cement coating, but in that year this  was fortunately stripped away, and the present charming aspect revealed  to the eye.    [Illustration: SOUTHERN SIDE OF CATHEDRAL, FROM DEANERY GARDEN.  _S.B. Bolas & Co., Photo._]    #The Exterior.#--It would be difficult to deny that the exterior of  Winchester Cathedral is disappointing, and few are likely to echo the  opinion of an over-zealous admirer of the building who said that the  longer one looks at it the more one feels the low central tower to be  the only kind that would suit the huge proportions of the building. On  the contrary, it may be said that it is impossible to look at Winchester  without a feeling of regret that the superb mass of the great fabric,  the largest mediaeval church in England since the destruction of old S.  Paul's, is not crowned by a loftier central tower. There is a legend to  the effect that there were seven towers in the original design--the  central one, two at the west end, and one at each angle of the  transepts; and this seems to be supported by the solid character of some  of the piers in the transepts. Yet, despite the rather ungraceful  outline of the whole building, when its mere size is realised, it  gradually asserts its importance and incontrovertibly proves its right  to be considered one of the very finest structures in England.    It will not be out of place to quote a short criticism which sums up the  external qualities of the cathedral in a concise way:--\"With the  exception of portions of the late work in the presbytery, the exterior  of Winchester is severe in treatment, and plain wall-space plays an  important part in the design. Plain parapets and simply treated  pinnacles characterise the work of the nave. The Norman transepts are  externally but little altered, except by the insertion of Decorated  windows to give more light to the altars in their eastern aisles; and De  Lucy's work eastwards is, compared with some work of its date, simple in  the extreme. Rather more elaboration was bestowed on the design of the  new eastern bay of the Lady Chapel by Prior Silkstede and Bishop  Courtenay; but, taken as a whole, Winchester has one of the simplest  exteriors for its size and importance in the country\" (\"Winchester  Cathedral\" in _The Builder_ for October 1892).    The ground-plan of Winchester Cathedral is in the form of a plain Latin  cross, hardly broken in its outline save by the Perpendicular  prolongation of the Lady Chapel at the east end. But, simple as is the  plan, \"the great length of the church\" (to use the words of Fergusson)  \"is pleasingly broken ... by the bold projection of its transepts, which  here extend, as usual in England, three bays beyond the aisles, their  section being the same width as that of the nave.\" The width of the nave  with the aisles is 88 feet, while the transepts measure, from east to  west, 81 feet. The total length has already been given as 556, and the  width from north to south across the transepts is 230 feet. The altitude  of the walls is 75 feet, which is a foot less than at Peterborough,  though three more than at Ely.    #The West Front#, the work of Bishop Edingdon, has been roughly handled  by its critics, though Britton calls it a fine specimen of Perpendicular  architecture. The original Norman work demolished by Edingdon was, as  excavations have proved, forty feet in advance of the present _facade_.  To judge by accounts of the destroyed portions, the west front in its  earlier state must have been far more imposing than it is at present,  for not only is it now commonplace in mass, but even the detail has no  particular charm to atone for the change. The whole of this work appears  so thoroughly Perpendicular in character that it has been questioned  whether at such an early date as that to which it is assigned the style  can have been so far developed. Woodward, indeed, though attributing to  Edingdon the walls and the principal part of the west end, declares the  tracery, the fronts of the porches, and much of the panelling to be  later; but a comparison of Winchester with another church undoubtedly  built by this bishop, at his native town of Edingdon, in Wiltshire,  supports the tradition which credits him with its erection. Besides this  evidence, we have additional proof in the fact that he left by his will  certain property to be devoted to the completion of the nave. Late  though his work may appear at first sight, yet when it is closely  examined and compared with Wykeham's work the difference is very  apparent.    [Illustration: THE WEST FRONT, WINCHESTER CATHEDRAL.  _S.B. Bolas & Co., Photo._]    The whole western _facade_ with its three bays is wanting in greatness,  and its effect may be said to be that of a large parish church rather  than a cathedral. Not only do we miss the western towers which are so  often the most striking feature of an English west front, but the screen  which masks the lower storey lacks the richness which distinguishes a  somewhat similar feature at Exeter. The curiously poor appearance,  notwithstanding its huge size, of the great west window is perhaps  chiefly responsible for the want of dignity in the whole; nor is there,  to redeem this, any delicate fancy in the tracery. The \"merest stone  grating\" Willis terms the window, and though from so warm a panegyrist  of the church this seems a severe criticism, no one can traverse his  opinion.    By way of further proof that the west front was Edingdon's work, Willis  points out that, while in Wykeham's panels the masonry itself is  carefully finished, and the same stones used for the ground of the panel  and its mouldings, in Edingdon's work the monials and tracery alone  exhibit good masonry, the panels being filled with rough ashlar. By  other tests, too technical to quote here, the same critic makes it clear  that the west front, with two compartments of the nave on the north and  one to the south, must be attributed to Edingdon, though he probably did  not finish the gable and turrets, which seem to be the work of Wykeham.  The present state shows a gable rising in the centre, flanked by  octagonal pinnacle turrets. On the apex of this gable is a canopied  finial containing a niche wherein now stands a figure of William of  Wykeham, the original statue, which was supposed to represent S.  Swithun, having been removed to the feretory when the west front was  restored in 1860 at a cost of L3000. The triangle of the gable is filled  with tracery, the lower part of the central panels in which serve as a  smaller square-headed six-light window above the parapet which crosses  at the head of the great nine-light window. Buttresses assist in  supporting the two towers, and lesser ones project to hide the sides of  the porch, which, pierced by three doorways and crowned by a parapet,  extends along the whole lower storey, across the nave and both aisles.  Above the screen the pitched roofs of aisles may be seen. The bays  containing the side windows, of four lights each, accord in style with  the large central one, having also wall tracery in panels over the  comparatively small surface of unpierced wall. The screen itself has  three deeply-recessed portals with pointed arches, and a large canopied  empty niche on each side of the main entrance.    The central doorway is divided by a clustered shaft, where from spring  two cinquefoil arches. The recessed portal has a groined roof, with an  arcade of cusped arches on the main west wall, broken by the doorways  which give admission to the nave. A pierced balcony of simple design  crowns the whole of the screen and forms a gallery which is said to have  been used for bestowing episcopal benedictions to the people outside the  cathedral on festival days.    The excavations which brought to light the old foundations of the  original west front showed \"a wall of 128 feet from north to south, and  12 feet thick, with returns at each end of the same thickness 60 feet in  length. At their eastern ends the walls again turn in at right angles  and meet the present side aisles at 17 feet from each corner. Within the  parallelogram thus partially traced two other walls run from east to  west at a distance of 36 feet from each other.\" In a garden adjoining  the west end of the cathedral at the time when these observations were  made, part of the south-west angle of the walls still remained.  Indications of the western towers were apparent; and Willis suggests  that they were probably either unfinished, or in a threatening  condition, so that Edingdon demolished them; even as at Gloucester the  western towers of the cathedral were removed, and the _facade_ was  replaced by a perpendicular"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20348"],[0,"The Moving Picture Girls in War Plays (#5)"],[1,"-believe shed and  put the hay in, I s'pose some of my hens seen it and thought it would be  a good place. So they made a nest there, and they've been layin' in it  for the last few days.\"    \"More as a week, I should say!\" declared Mr. Switzer in his best German  comedian manner. \"There were many eggs!\"    \"Yes, you did bust quite a few!\" said Sandy, critically looking at the  disrupted nest. \"But it can't be helped.\"    \"Well, the film wasn't spoiled, anyhow,\" observed Mr. Pertell. To him  that was all that counted. \"You got him all right as he went through the  window, didn't you, Russ?\"    \"Oh, yes. It wasn't until he was inside, down behind the boards and out  of sight, that the eggs happened.\"    \"No more eggs for me!\" declared the comedian. \"I shall never look a  chicken in the face again.\"    \"Go on with the scene,\" ordered the director. \"You are supposed to steal  out to the barn to give the hidden soldier food,\" he said to Ruth. \"You  come out from the house, and are astonished to see a man's head sticking  out of the shed window. You register surprise, and start to run back to  the house, but the soldier implores you to stay, and you reluctantly  listen to him. Then he begs for food----\"    \"But don't bring me a hard-boiled egg, whatever you do!\" called Mr.  Switzer.    \"No funny business now,\" warned the director, with a laugh. \"Go on now,  and we'll see how you do it.\"    After one or two trials Mr. Pertell announced himself as satisfied and  the filming of that part of the war drama went on.    So many details in regard to the taking of moving pictures have been  given in the previous books of this series that they need not be  repeated here. Suffice it to say that the pictures of the players in  motion are taken on a long celluloid strip of film, just as one picture  is taken on a square of celluloid in a snap-shot camera.    This long reel of film, when developed, is a \"negative.\" From it a  \"positive\" strip of film is made, and this is the one that is run  through the projection machine throwing the pictures on the white screen  in the darkened theatre. The pictures taken are very small, and are  greatly magnified on the screen.    So much for the mechanical end of the business. It may interest some to  learn that the photo-play, as seen in the theatre, is not taken all at  once, nor in the order in which the scenes are seen as they are reeled  off.    When a play is decided on, the director or one of his helpers goes over  the manuscript and picks out all the scenes that take place in one  location. It may be in a parlor, in a hut, on the side of a mountain, in  a lonely wilderness, on a battlefield, on a bridge--anywhere, in fact.  And several scenes, involving several different persons, may take place  at any one of these places.    It can be understood that it would involve a great deal of work to  follow the logical sequence of the scenes. That is to say, if the first  scene was in an office showing a girl taking dictation from her  employer, and the next showed the same girl and her employer on a  ferryboat, and the third scene went back to the office, where some  papers were being examined, it would mean a loss of time to photograph,  or film, the first office scene, then take every one involved in the  act to the ferryboat, and then back to the office again.    Instead, the two office scenes, and possibly more, are taken at one  time, on the same film, one after the other, without regard to whether  they follow logically or not. Afterward the film is cut apart, and the  scenes fitted in where they belong.    So, too, all the scenes pertaining to a hut in the wilderness, on a  bridge, in the woods, in a parlor--it makes no difference where--are  taken at the same time. In this way much labor and expense are saved.    But it makes a queer sort of story to an uninitiated person looking on;  and sometimes the players themselves do not know what it is all about.    So Mr. Pertell wanted to get all the scenes centering around the shed at  the same time, though they were not in sequence. And Ruth and Mr.  Switzer and the others in the east went through their parts with the  shed as a background.    In one scene Ruth had to discover the hidden soldier. Then she had to  steal out to him with food. Later, at night, she was to help him to  escape. Then, a week later, she was to go out to the same shed and  discover a letter he had hidden in the hay. That ended the scenes at  the shed, and it could be taken away to make room for something else.    \"Oh, Ruth, you did that splendidly!\" exclaimed Alice, as her sister  finished her work and went up on the shady porch to rest.    \"Did you like it? I'm glad.\"    \"Like it? It was great! Where you discovered that letter in the hay,  your face showed such natural surprise.\"    \"I'm glad it didn't register merriment.\"    \"Why?\"    \"Because, as I picked up the letter, I found a big blot of the yellow  from the hens' eggs on it. I hope it doesn't show in the picture. I had  all I could do to keep from laughing when I thought of Mr. Switzer in  the omelet scene.\"    \"Oh, well, you know they want all white stuff yellow when they make  pictures.\"    \"In the studio, but not outdoors.\"    This is a fact. As the scenes in the studio are taken in the glare of a  special kind of electric light, all white objects, even the collars and  cuffs of the men, are yellow in tone, though in the picture they show  perfectly white. This is due to the chemical rays of the lights used.  Out of doors, under sunlight, colors are seen in their own hues.    \"You did very well in that funny little scene with Paul,\" said Ruth to  her sister.    \"You mean in the swing under the apple tree?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"I was so afraid he would swing me too high,\" Alice went on. \"He was  cutting up so. I told him to stop, but he wouldn't.\"    \"It was very natural. I think it will show well. Hark! what's that?\"  cried Ruth, leaping to her feet.    \"Thunder,\" suggested Alice, as a distant, rumbling noise came to their  ears.    \"Sounds more like big guns.\"    \"Oh, that's what it is!\" agreed Alice. \"They are going to rehearse one  of the battle scenes this afternoon, I heard Mr. Pertell say. The  soldiers must have come, and they're practising over in the glen. Come  on over and watch. We're in on the scenes later, but we can watch now.\"    \"All right,\" agreed Ruth. \"Wait until I get my broad-brimmed hat, the  sun is hot up here.\"    Presently the two sisters, with Paul Ardite and some other members of  the company, were strolling over the fields toward the scene of the  distant firing. As they came in sight of several hundred men and horses,  they saw the smoke of cannon and heard the shouting of the director and  his assistants who were using big megaphones. It was the rehearsal of  one of the many battle scenes that were to take place about Oak Farm.    \"Oh, look at that girl ride!\" suddenly exclaimed Alice, pointing to a  young woman who dashed past on a spirited horse. \"Isn't she a wonder?\"    \"She is indeed,\" agreed Ruth. \"I wonder who she is?\"    \"One of the extras,\" said Paul. \"A number of them have just arrived.  We'll begin active work soon, and film some big scenes with you girls in  them.\"    Alice gazed across the fields toward the figure of the girl on  horseback. There was something spirited in her riding, and, though she  had never seen her before, Alice felt strangely drawn toward the new  player.          CHAPTER V    A DARING RIDER      \"Come on now, Confederates!\"    \"No, you Union chaps hold back there in ambush. You're not to dash out  until you get the signal. Wait!\"    \"Keep that horse out of the way. He isn't supposed to dash across,  riderless, until after the first volley.\"    \"Put in a little more action! Fall off as though you were shot, not as  though you were bending over to see if your horse had a stone under his  shoe! Fall off hard!\"    \"And you fellows that do fall off--lie still after you fall! Don't  twitch as though you wanted to scratch your noses!\"    \"If some of 'em don't stay quiet after they fall off they'll get stepped  on!\"    \"All ready now! Come with a rush when the signal's given!\"    Mr. Pertell and his men were stationed near a \"battery\" of camera men,  who were ready to grind away; and the director and his assistants were  calling their instructions through big megaphones. To reach the soldiers  in the more distant parts of the field recourse was had to telephones,  the wires of which were laid along the ground in shallow trenches,  covered with earth so that the trampling of the horses would not sever  them.    \"Get that battery farther back among the trees!\" cried Mr. Pertell to  one of his helpers. \"It's supposed to be a masked one, but it's in plain  sight now. Even the audience would see it, let alone the men it's  supposed to fire on. Get it back!\"    \"Yes, sir,\" answered the man, and he telephoned the instructions to the  assistant director in charge of a battery of field guns that had been  thundering away--the sound which had brought Ruth and Alice to the  scene.    \"Do we have any part in the battle scenes?\" asked Ruth.    \"Yes, quite big parts,\" Paul informed her. \"But you don't go on to-day.  This is only a rehearsal.\"    \"But they've been firing real powder,\" remarked Alice, \"and it looks as  though they were going to fire more,\" and she pointed to where men of  the masked battery were ramming charges down the iron throats of their  guns.    \"Yes, they're firing, and charging, and doing all manner of stunts, and  the camera men are grinding away, but they aren't using any film,\" went  on Paul. \"It's just to get every one used to working under the  excitement. They have to fire the guns so the horses will get so they  don't mind them when the real time comes.\"    Hundreds of extra players had been engaged to come to Oak Farm for these  battle scenes in the drama, \"A Girl in Blue and A Girl in Gray,\" and  some of them were already on hand"]]]
