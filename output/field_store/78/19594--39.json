Altogether he was a magnificent animal, and as I lay  sprawling on the fore tongue of the waggon, it occurred to me that he  would look uncommonly well in a cage. He stood there by the carcass of  poor Kaptein, and deliberately disembowelled him as neatly as a butcher  could have done. All this while I dared not move, for he kept lifting  his head and keeping an eye on me as he licked his bloody chops. When  he had cleaned Kaptein out he opened his mouth and roared, and I am not  exaggerating when I say that the sound shook the waggon. Instantly there  came back an answering roar.    \"'Heavens!' I thought, 'there is his mate.'    \"Hardly was the thought out of my head when I caught sight in the  moonlight of the lioness bounding along through the long grass, and  after her a couple of cubs about the size of mastiffs. She stopped  within a few feet of my head, and stood, and waved her tail, and fixed  me with her glowing yellow eyes; but just as I thought that it was all  over she turned and began to feed on Kaptein, and so did the cubs. There  were the four of them within eight feet of me, growling and quarrelling,  rending and tearing, and crunching poor Kaptein's bones; and there I  lay shaking with terror, and the cold perspiration pouring out of me,  feeling like another Daniel come to judgment in a new sense of the  phrase. Presently the cubs had eaten their fill, and began to get  restless. One went round to the back of the waggon and pulled at  the Impala buck that hung there, and the other came round my way and  commenced the sniffing game at my leg. Indeed, he did more than that,  for, my trouser being hitched up a little, he began to lick the bare  skin with his rough tongue. The more he licked the more he liked it, to  judge from his increased vigour and the loud purring noise he made. Then  I knew that the end had come, for in another second his file-like tongue  would have rasped through the skin of my leg--which was luckily pretty  tough--and have drawn the blood, and then there would be no chance  for me. So I just lay there and thought of my sins, and prayed to the  Almighty, and thought that, after all, life was a very enjoyable thing.    \"And then all of a sudden I heard a crashing of bushes and the shouting  and whistling of men, and there were the two boys coming back with the  cattle, which they had found trekking along all together. The lions  lifted their heads and listened, then without a sound bounded off--and I  fainted.    \"The lions came back no more that night, and by the next morning my  nerves had got pretty straight again; but I was full of wrath when I  thought of all that I had gone through at the hands, or rather noses,  of those four lions, and of the fate of my after-ox Kaptein. He was a  splendid ox, and I was very fond of him. So wroth was I that, like a  fool, I determined to attack the whole family of them. It was worthy of  a greenhorn out on his first hunting-trip; but I did it nevertheless.  Accordingly after breakfast, having rubbed some oil upon my leg, which  was very sore from the cub's tongue, I took the driver, Tom, who did not  half like the job, and having armed myself with an ordinary double No.  12 smooth-bore, the first breech-loader I ever had, I started. I took  the smooth-bore because it shot a bullet very well; and my experience  has been that a round ball from a smooth-bore is quite as effective  against a lion as an express bullet. The lion is soft, and not a  difficult animal to finish if you hit him anywhere in the body. A buck  takes far more killing.    \"Well, I started, and the first thing I set to work to do was to try to  make out whereabouts the brutes lay up for the day. About three hundred  yards from the waggon was the crest of a rise covered with single  mimosa-trees, dotted about in a park-like fashion, and beyond this was  a stretch of open plain running down to a dry pan, or water-hole, which  covered about an acre of ground, and was densely clothed with reeds,  now in the sear and yellow leaf. From the farther edge of this pan the  ground sloped up again to a great cleft, or nullah, which had been cut  out by the action of the water, and was pretty thickly sprinkled with  bush, among which grew some large trees, I forget of what sort.    \"It at once struck me that the dry pan would be a likely place to find  my friends in, as there is nothing a lion is fonder of than lying up  in reeds, through which he can see things without being seen himself.  Accordingly thither I went and prospected. Before I had got half-way  round the pan I found the remains of a blue vilder-beeste that had  evidently been killed within the last three or four days and partially  devoured by lions; and from other indications about I was soon assured  that if the family were not in the pan that day they spent a good deal  of their spare time there. But if there, the question was how to get  them out; for it was clearly impossible to think of going in after  them unless one was quite determined to commit suicide. Now there was a  strong wind blowing from the direction of the waggon, across the reedy  pan toward the bush-clad kloof or donga, and this first gave me the  idea of firing the reeds, which, as I think I told you, were pretty dry.  Accordingly Tom took some matches and began starting little fires to the  left, and I did the same to the right. But the reeds were still green  at the bottom, and we should never have got them well alight had it not  been for the wind, which grew stronger and stronger as the sun climbed  higher, and forced the fire into them. At last, after half an hour's  trouble, the flames got a hold, and began to spread out like a fan,  whereupon I went round to the farther side of the pan to wait for the  lions, standing well out in the open, as we stood at the copse to-day  where you shot the woodcock. It was a rather risky thing to do, but I  used to be so sure of my shooting in those days that I did not so much  mind the risk. Scarcely had I got round when I heard the reeds parting  before the onward rush of some animal. 'Now for it,' said I. On it came.  I could see that it was yellow, and prepared for action, when instead  of a lion out bounded a beautiful rietbok which had been lying in  the shelter of the pan. It must, by the way, have been a rietbok of a  peculiarly confiding nature to lay itself down with the lion, like the  lamb of prophecy, but I suppose the reeds were thick, and that it kept a  long way off.    \"Well, I let the rietbok go, and it went like the wind, and kept my  eyes fixed upon the reeds. The fire was burning like a furnace now; the  flames crackling and roaring as they bit into the reeds, sending spouts  of fire twenty feet and more into the air, and making the hot air dance  above it in a way that was perfectly dazzling. But the reeds were  still half green, and created an enormous quantity of smoke, which came  rolling toward me like a curtain, lying very low on account of the wind.  Presently, above the crackling of the fire, I heard a startled roar,  then another and another. So the lions were at home.    \"I was beginning to get excited now, for, as you fellows know, there  is nothing in experience to warm up your nerves like a lion at close  quarters, unless it is a wounded buffalo; and I got still more so when  I made out through the smoke that the lions were all moving about on the  extreme edge of the reeds. Occasionally they would pop their heads out  like rabbits from a burrow, and then, catching sight of me standing  about fifty yards out, draw them back again. I knew that it must be  getting pretty warm behind them, and that they could not keep the game  up for long; and I was not mistaken, for suddenly all four of them broke  cover together, the old black-maned lion leading by a few yards. I never  saw a more splendid sight in all my hunting experience than those four  lions bounding across the veldt, overshadowed by the dense pall of smoke  and backed by the fiery furnace of the burning reeds.    \"I reckoned that they would pass, on their road to the bushy kloof,  within about five and twenty yards of me; so, taking a long breath, I  got my gun well on to the lion's shoulder--the black-maned one--so as to  allow for an inch or two of motion, and catch him through the heart.  I was on, dead on, and my finger was just beginning to tighten on the  trigger, when suddenly I went blind--a bit of reed-ash had drifted into  my right eye. I danced and rubbed, and succeeded in clearing it more or  less just in time to see the tail of the last lion vanishing round the  bushes up the kloof.    \"If ever a man was mad I was that man. It was too bad; and such a shot  in the open, too! However, I was not going to be beaten, so I just  turned and marched for the kloof. Tom, the driver, begged and implored  me not to go; but though as a general rule I never pretend to be very  brave (which I am not), I was determined that I would either kill those  lions or they should kill me. So I told Tom that he need not come unless  he liked, but I was going; and being a plucky fellow, a Swazi by birth,  he shrugged his shoulders, muttered that I was mad or bewitched, and  followed doggedly in my tracks.    \"We soon got to the kloof, which was about three hundred yards in length  and but sparsely wooded, and then the real fun began. There might be a  lion behind every bush--there certainly were four lions somewhere; the  delicate question was, where. I peeped and poked and looked in every  possible direction, with my heart in my mouth, and was at last rewarded  by catching a glimpse of something yellow moving behind a bush. At the  same moment, from another bush opposite me out burst one of the cubs and  galloped back toward the burned-out pan. I whipped round and let drive a  snap-shot that "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19800"],[0,"London and the Kingdom - Volume 1 (#5)"],[1,"year 1002, when he married the  daughter of the Duke of Normandy, hoping thereby to win the Duke's  friendship and to close the harbours on the French coast against Sweyn,  Ethelred issued secret orders for a massacre of all Danes found in  England. In this massacre, which took place on the Festival of St. Brice  (13th Nov.), perished Gunhild, sister of Sweyn. Under these circumstances,  it can scarcely be wondered at, that thenceforth the Danish invasions  became more frequent, more systematic, and more extensive than ever.    For four years they continued their depredations \"cruelly marking every  shire in Wessex with burning and with harrying.\" Then they were again  bought off with a sum of L36,000, and two years' respite (1007-8) was  gained.(41) It was a respite and no more. As soon as they had spent their  money, they came again, and in 1009 made several assaults on London--\"They  often fought against the town of London, but to God be praise that it yet  stands sound, and they have ever fared ill.\"(42) Every year they struck  deeper into the heart of the country, and carried their plundering  expeditions from Wessex into Mercia and East Anglia.    (M28)    In 1011 Canterbury was taken and sacked, Alphage, the Archbishop, being  made prisoner, and carried away by the Danish fleet to Greenwich. Finding  it impossible to extort a ransom, they brutally murdered him (19th May,  1012), in one of their drunken moods, pelting him in their open court or  \"husting\" with bones and skulls of oxen.(43) The worthy prelate's corpse  was allowed to be removed to London where it was reverently interred in  St. Paul's. A few years later, Cnut caused it to be transferred with due  solemnity to the Archbishop's own metropolitan church of Canterbury.    (M29)    In the following year, Sweyn was so successful in reducing the  Northumbrians and the inhabitants of the five boroughs,(44) as well as the  towns of Winchester and Oxford, taking hostages from each as he went, that  he thought he might venture once more to attack London itself; hoping for  better success than had attended him on previous occasions. He was the  more anxious to capture London, because Ethelred himself was there, but he  again met with such determined resistance, and so many of his followers  were drowned in the Thames that for the fourth time he had to beat a  retreat.(45)    (M30)    Leaving London for a while, Sweyn proceeded to conquer that part of  England which still held out against him, and having accomplished his  purpose, was again preparing to attack the one city which had baffled all  his attempts to capture, when the Londoners themselves, finding further  opposition hopeless, offered their submission and left Ethelred to take  care of himself.(46) This he did by betaking himself to Normandy, where he  remained until Sweyn's death in the following year (3rd Feb., 1014).    (M31)    Upon this event taking place, the crews of the Danish fleet assumed the  right of disposing of the English crown, and elected Sweyn's son, Cnut, to  be king. The English, however, compelled as they had been by superior  strength to submit to the father, were in no mood to accept without a  struggle the sovereignty of his son. The whole of the Witan at once  declared in favour of sending for Ethelred, with the assurance \"that no  lord was dearer than their natural lord,\" if only he would promise to  govern them more justly than before.(47) Ethelred sent word by Edmund his  son that \"he would be to them a kind lord, and amend all the things which  they eschewed, and all the things should be forgiven which had been done  or said to him, on condition that they all, unanimously and without  treachery, would turn to him.\" Pledges were given and taken on either  side, and thenceforth a Danish king was to be looked upon as an  outlaw.(48)    (M32)    When Ethelred arrived in England, he was accompanied according to an  Icelandic Saga,(49) by King Olaf, of Norway, who assisted him in expelling  the Danes from Southwark, and gaining an entrance into the city. The  manner in which this was carried out, is thus described. A small knot of  Danes occupied a stronghold in the City, whilst others were in possession  of Southwark. Between the two lay London Bridge--a wooden bridge, \"so broad  that two waggons could pass each other upon it\"--fortified by barricades,  towers, and parapets, and manned by Danes. Ethelred was naturally very  anxious to get possession of the bridge, and a meeting of chiefs was  summoned to consult how it could be done. Olaf promised to lay his fleet  alongside the bridge if the English would do the same. This was agreed  upon. Having covered in the decks of the vessels with a wooden roof to  protect the crew and fighting men, Olaf succeeded in rowing light up to  the bridge and laying cables round its piers. This done, he caused his  ships to head down stream and the crews to row their hardest. The result  was that the piles were loosened and the bridge, heavily weighted by the  Danes who were fighting upon it, gave way. Many were thrown into the  river, whilst others made good their retreat to Southwark, which was soon  afterwards stormed and taken. This incident in connection with Ethelred's  return formed the subject of more than one Scandinavian poem, of which the  following may serve as a specimen:--      \"London Bridge is broken down--    Gold is won and bright renown.      Shields resounding,      War-horns sounding,    Hildur shouting in the din!      Arrows singing,      Mail-coats ringing--    Odin makes our Olaf win!\"    (M33)    For a short while after his return Ethelred displayed a spirit of  patriotism and courage beyond any he had hitherto shown. He succeeded in  surprising and defeating the Danes in that district of Lincolnshire known  as Lindsey, and drove Cnut to take refuge in his ships, and eventually to  sail away to Denmark.(50)    (M34)    It was not long before he again appeared; he was then, however, to meet in  the field Ethelred's son, Edmund, whose valour had gained for him the name  of Ironside. This spirited youth, forming a striking contrast to the weak  and pusillanimous character of his father, had collected a force to  withstand the enemy, but the men refused to fight unless Ethelred came  with them, and unless they had \"the support of the citizens of  London.\"(51) A message was therefore sent to him at London to take the  field with such a force as he could gather. Father and son thereupon  joined forces; but the king was in ill-health, and it wanted but a whisper  of treachery to send him back to the security of London's walls. Thither,  too, marched Cnut, but before he arrived Ethelred had died (23rd April,  1016).(52) The late king was buried in St. Paul's.(53)    (M35)    The city of London had by this time attained a position higher than it had  ever reached before. \"We cannot as yet call it the capital of the kingdom,  but its geographical position made one of the chief bulwarks of the land,  and in no part of the realm do we find the inhabitants outdoing the  patriotism and courage of its valiant citizens.\"(54) Under Edgar the  foreign trade with the city had increased to such an extent that Ethelred,  his son, deemed it time to draw up a code of laws to regulate the customs  to be paid by the merchants of France and Flanders as well as by the  \"emperor's men,\" the fore-runners of those \"easterling\" merchants, who,  from their headquarters in the Steel-yard at Dowgate, subsequently became  known as merchants of the Steel-yard.(55)    Among the multitude of foreigners that in after-years thronged the streets  of the city bartering pepper and spices from the far east, gloves and  cloth, vinegar and wine, in exchange for the rural products of the  country, might be seen the now much hated but afterwards much favoured  Dane.(56) The Dane was again master of all England, except London, and  Ethelred's kingdom, before the close of his reign, was confined within the  narrow limits of the city's walls; \"that true-hearted city was once more  the bulwark of England, the centre of every patriotic hope, the special  object of every hostile attack.\"(57)    (M36)    At Ethelred's death the Witan who were in London united with the  inhabitants of the city in choosing Edmund as his successor. This is the  first recorded instance of the Londoners having taken a direct part in the  election of a king. Cnut disputed Edmund's right to the crown, and  proceeded to attack the city. He sailed up the Thames with his fleet, but  being unable to pass the bridge, he dug a canal on the south side of the  river, whereby he was enabled to carry his ships above bridge, and so  invest the city along the whole length of the riverside. To complete the  investment, and so prevent any of the inhabitants escaping either by land  or water, he ditched the city round, so that none could pass in or  out.(58)    (M37)    This, as well as two other attempts made by Cnut within a few weeks of  each other to capture London by siege, were frustrated by the determined  opposition of the citizens.(59) \"Almighty God saved it,\" as the chronicler  piously remarks.(60)    (M38)    Nor was Cnut more successful in the field, being worsted in no less than  five pitched battles against Edmund, until by the treachery of Edmund's  brother-in-law, Eadric, alderman of Mercia, he succeeded at last in  vanquishing the English army on the memorable field of Assandun.(61)    (M39)    After this Edmund reluctantly consented to a conference and a division of  the kingdom. The meeting took place at Olney, and there it was agreed that  Edmund should retain his crown, and rule over all England south of the  Thames, together with East Anglia, Essex and London, whilst Cnut should  enjoy the rest of the kingdom. \"The citizens, beneath whose walls the  power of Cnut and his father had been so often shattered, now made peace  with the Danish host. As usual, money was paid to them,"]]]
