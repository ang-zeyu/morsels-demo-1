The Drake, the mother Duck, the five aunts, and the nine  Ducklings all stood as tall and straight as they could, and turned and  twisted their long necks, and flapped their wings, and squeezed their  down, and murmured to each other. And their father didn't tell the  little ones how, and their mother didn't tell them how, and their five  aunts didn't tell them how, but they knew without being told.    The Ducklings grew fast, and made friends of all the farmyard people.  Early every morning they went to the brook. They learned to follow the  brook to the river, and here were wonderful things to be seen. There was  plenty to eat, too, in the soft mud under the water, and it was easy  enough to dive to it, or to reach down their long necks while only their  pointed tails and part of their body could be seen above the water. Not  that they ate the mud. They kept only the food that they found in it,  and then let the mud slip out between the rough edges of their bills.  They swam and ate all day, and slept all night, and were dutiful  Ducklings who minded their mother, so it was not strange that they were  plump and happy.    At last there came a morning when the eldest Duckling could not go to  the brook with the others. A Weasel had bitten him in the night, and if  it had not been for his mother and the Drake, would have carried him  away. The rest had to go in swimming, and his lame leg would not let him  waddle as far as the brook, or swim after he got there.    \"I don't know what to do,\" he said to his mother. \"I can't swim and I  can't waddle far, and I've eaten so much already that I can't eat  anything more for a long, long time.\"    \"You might play with the little Shanghais,\" said his mother.    \"They run around too much,\" he replied. \"I can't keep up with them.\"    \"Then why not lie near the corn crib and visit with the Mice?\"    \"Oh, they don't like the things that I like, and it isn't any fun.\"    \"How would it suit you to watch the Peacock for a while?\"    \"I'm tired of watching the Peacock.\"    \"Then,\" said the mother, \"you must help somebody else. You are old  enough to think of such things now, and you must remember this wise  saying: 'When you don't know what to do, help somebody.'\"    \"Whom can I help?\" said the lame Duckling. \"People can all do things for  themselves.\"    \"There is the Blind Horse,\" answered his mother. \"He is alone to-day,  and I'm sure he would like somebody to visit him.\"    \"Quack!\" said the Duckling. \"I will go to see him.\" He waddled slowly  away, stopping now and then to rest, and shaking his little pointed tail  from side to side as Ducks do. The Blind Horse was grazing in the  pasture alone.    \"I've come to see you, sir,\" said the Duckling. \"Shall I be in your  way?\"    The Blind Horse looked much pleased. \"I think from your voice that you  must be one of the young Ducks,\" said he. \"I shall be very glad to have  you visit me, only you must be careful to keep away from my feet, for I  can't see, and I might step on you.\"    \"I'll be careful,\" said the Duckling. \"I can't waddle much anyway this  morning, because my leg hurts me so.\"    \"Why, I'm sorry you are lame,\" said the Horse. \"What is the matter?\"    \"A Weasel bit me in the night, sir. But it doesn't hurt so much as it  did before I came to see you. Perhaps the pasture is a better place for  lame legs than the farmyard.\" He didn't know that it was because he was  trying to make somebody else happy that he felt so much better, yet that  was the reason.    The Blind Horse and the Duckling became very fond of each other and had  a fine time. The Horse told stories of his Colthood, and of the things  he had seen in his travels before he became blind. And the Duckling told  him what the other farmyard people were doing, and about the soft,  fleecy clouds that drifted across the blue sky. When the mother Duck  came to look for him, the little fellow was much surprised. \"Didn't you  go to the brook?\" he asked.    \"Yes,\" said his mother, with a smile. \"We have been there all the  morning. Don't you see how high the sun is?\"    \"Why-ee!\" said the Duckling. \"I didn't think I had been here long at  all. We've been having the nicest time. And I'm coming again, am I not?\"  He asked this question of the Blind Horse.    \"I wish you would come often,\" answered the Blind Horse. \"You have given  me a very pleasant morning. Good-bye!\"    The mother Duck and her son waddled off together. \"How is your leg?\"  said she.    \"I forgot all about it until I began to walk,\" answered the Duckling.  \"Isn't that queer?\"    \"Not at all,\" said his mother. \"It was because you were making somebody  else happy. 'When you don't know what to do, help somebody.'\"          THE FUSSY QUEEN BEE      In a sheltered corner of the farmyard, where the hedge kept off the cold  winds and the trees shaded from hot summer sunshine, there were many  hives of Bees. One could not say much for the Drones, but the others  were the busiest of all the farmyard people, and they had so much to do  that they did not often stop to visit with their neighbors.    In each hive, or home, there were many thousand Bees, and each had his  own work. First of all, there was the Queen. You might think that being  a Queen meant playing all the time, but that is not so, for to be a  really good Queen, even in a Beehive, one must know a great deal and  keep at work all the time. The Queen Bee is the mother of all the Bee  Babies, and she spends her days in laying eggs. She is so very precious  and important a person that the first duty of the rest is to take care  of her.    The Drones are the stoutest and finest-looking of all the Bees, but they  are lazy, very, very lazy. There are never many of them in a hive, and  like most lazy people, they spend much of their time in telling the  others how to work. They do not make wax or store honey, and as the  Worker Bees do not wish them to eat what has been put away for winter,  they do not live very long.    Most of the Bees are Workers. They are smaller than either the Queen  Mother or the Drones, and they gather all the honey, make all the wax,  build the comb, and feed the babies. They keep the hive clean, and when  the weather is very warm, some of them fan the air with their wings to  cool it. They guard the doorway of the hive, too, and turn away the  robbers who sometimes come to steal their honey.    In these busy homes, nobody can live long just for himself. Everybody  helps somebody else, and that makes life pleasant. The Queen Mother  often lays as many as two thousand eggs in a day. Most of these are  Worker eggs, and are laid in the small cells of the brood comb, which is  the nursery of the hive. A few are Drone eggs and are laid in large  cells. She never lays any Queen eggs, for she does not want more Queens  growing up. It is a law among the Bees that there can be only one grown  Queen living in each home.    The Workers, however, know that something might happen to their old  Queen Mother, so, after she has gone away, they sometimes go into a cell  where she has laid a Worker egg, and take down the waxen walls between  it and the ones on either side to make a very large royal cell. They  bite away the wax with their strong jaws and press the rough edges into  shape with their feet. When this egg hatches, they do not feed the baby,  or Larva, with tasteless bread made of flower-dust, honey, and water, as  they would if they intended it to grow up a Worker or a Drone. Instead,  they make what is called royal jelly, which is quite sour, and tuck this  all around the Larva, who now looks like a little white worm.    The royal jelly makes her grow fast, and in five days she is so large as  to nearly fill the cell. Then she stops eating, spins a cocoon, and lies  in it for about two and a half days more. When she comes out of this,  she is called a Pupa. Sixteen days after the laying of the egg, the  young Queen is ready to come out of her cell. It takes twenty-one days  for a Worker to become fully grown and twenty-five for a Drone.    In the hive by the cedar tree, the Queen Mother was growing restless  and fussy. She knew that the Workers were raising some young Queens, and  she tried to get to the royal cells. She knew that if she could only do  that, the young Queens would never live to come out. The Workers knew  this, too, and whenever she came near there, they made her go away.    The Queen Larvae and Pupae were of different ages, and one of them was now  ready to leave her cell. They could hear her crying to be let out, but  they knew that if she and the Queen Mother should meet now, one of them  would die. So instead of letting her out, they built a thick wall of wax  over the door and left only an opening through which they could feed  her. When she was hungry she ran her tongue out and they put honey on  it.    She wondered why the Workers did not let her out, when she wanted so  much to be free. She did not yet know that Queen Mothers do not get  along well with young Queens.    The Workers talked it over by themselves. One of them was very  tender-hearted. \"It does seem too bad,\" said she, \"to keep the poor  young Queen shut up in her cell. I don't see how you can stand it to  hear her piping so pitifully all the time. I am sure she must be  beautiful. I never saw a finer tongue than the one she runs out for  honey.\"    \"Humph!\" said a sensible old Worker, who had seen many Queens hatched  and many swarms fly away, \"you'd be a good deal more sorry if we did let  her out now. It would not do at all.\"    The tender-hearted Worker did not answer this, but she talked it over  with the Drones. \"I declare,\" said she, wiping her eyes with her  forefeet, \"I can hardly gather a mouthful of honey for thinking of her.\"    \"Suppose you hang yourself up and make wax then,\" said one Drone. \"It  is a rather sunshiny day, but you ought to be doing something, and if"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19389"],[0,"Child Songs of Cheer (#5)"],[1,"so lightly          And it glittered, oh, so whitely,      That I gazed and gazed in wonder at the lovely painted pane;          Then the sun rose high and higher          With his wand of golden fire      Till, alas, my picture vanished and I looked for it in vain!          THE FIRST SNOW          The snow! the snow! Whoop! Hooray! Ho! Ho!      Plunge in the deep drifts and toss it up so!        Rollick and roll in the feathery fleece        Plucked out of the breasts of the marvelous geese      By the little old woman who lives in the sky;      Have ever you seen her? No, neither have I!          GRANDFATHER KNOWS          Grandfather says of all things        The silliest he's heard      Is that some children call things        They've never seen, \"absurd!\"      And have their doubts of true things,        And won't believe, because      They say, \"If you but knew things,        There _is_ no Santa Claus!\"        Grandfather says he _knows_ him,        And sees him every year,      And Santa often shows him        The playthings he brings here;      He says, too, Santa told him        If any girls and boys      Laugh at and won't uphold him,        They'll not get any toys!          SLEIGH-BELLS          Tinkle, tinkle, tinkle!        Happy winter-time!      Baby's eyes a-twinkle,        Hear the sleigh-bells chime!        Each one rings a merry        Ting-a-ling-a-ling!      For a sleigh-bell fairy        Hides inside to sing.        See them quake and quiver,        Up and downward tossed,      Seems as if they shiver        In the nipping frost!        Shiver into laughter,        Jolly little elves!      Till we laugh thereafter,        Merry as themselves!          THE RED-BIRD          Swept lightly by the south wind        The elm-leaves softly stirred,      And in their pale green clusters        There straightway bloomed a bird!        His glossy feathers glistened        With dyes as richly red      As any tulip flaming        From out the garden bed.        But ah, unlike the tulips,        In joyous strain, ere long,      This red-bird flower unfolded        A heart of golden song!          WILD BEASTS          I will be a lion        And you shall be a bear,      And each of us will have a den        Beneath a nursery chair;      And you must growl and growl and growl,        And I will roar and roar,      And then--why, then--you'll growl again,        And I will roar some more!          WHEREFORE WINGS?          Heigho, sparrow! Reckless of the rain;        When chill the cheerless wind grows,      Chirping might and main!        Is it naught, then, when the rose                  Blows again?        Beating, sleeting on your draggled coat!        Surely, 'tis enough to drown      Any happy note        Nestling in that downy brown                  Little throat.        Ah me, sparrow! Had I but your power,        Think you in the freezing sleet      I would waste an hour?        --I'd sing my sweetest to a sweet                  Orange flower!

How the pulses stir,      How it warms the hearts beneath        Little coats of fur!        Oh, the happy pussy-cats!        Days to doze and doze,      And what pleasant dreams they dream        Only pussy knows.

Sunbeam and sing time,                Bluebird and wing time,      This time is kiss time for sweethearts, I say!

So for a love now                Token thereof now,      Sweet, see this tiny May-basket I bring;                Posies to play with,                Pinks to be gay with,      Dear little baby of sunshine and spring!          THE LITTLE NEST          A little picture haunts me;        It comes and comes again;      It is a tiny bird's-nest,        All ragged from the rain.        It clings within a birch-tree        Upon the moorland's edge,      Between the barren branches,        Above the swaying sedge.        The sky is gray behind it,        And when the north winds blow,      The birch-tree bends and shivers,        And tosses to and fro.        I wonder, does it haunt them,        The birds that flew away?      And will they come to seek it,        Some sunny summer day?        I wonder, does some redbreast        Upon an orange-bough,      Still picture it as plainly        As I can see it now?        Ah me! I would forget it,        Yet still, with sense of pain,      I see this little bird's-nest        Within the driving rain.          CHRISTMAS CANDLES          When the Christ-child comes again        Softly down the street to-night,      Twinkling through the window pane        Let our candles shed their light.        Though the clouds are dark above        And the golden stars are dim,      We can tell Him of our love        If we set a light for Him.        Oh, the blessed Christ-child dear,        In His robe of shining white,      Let our candles give Him cheer        As He passes by to-night!          A SONG OF THE CHRISTMAS-TREE    [Illustration: CHRISTMAS CANDLES]        We can tell Him of our love        If we set a light for Him.          Hurrah! Hurrah! for the Christmas-tree      With its glory and glitter and mystery!      Its twinkling candles that bud and bloom      Like strange bright flowers in the darkened room,      Its glistening gold and silver balls,      Its candy canes and its blue-eyed dolls,      The sugary fruits it bears,--for oh,      Where else do such wonderful sweetmeats grow?--      Its tasseled horns and its pop-corn strings      And all its myriad marvelous things!                  O-ho! and ah-ha!                    And a hip hurrah!      For our dear and beautiful tree, because      It grew in the gardens of Santa Claus        And he brought it here in his reindeer sleigh      From ever and ever so far away!        _So, children, come, let us make a ring        And all clasp hands as we dance and sing        To the blessed tree and the blessed night        When the Christ-child walks in the candles' light!_        Hurrah! Hurrah! for the Christmas-tree      That Santa Claus brought to you and me!      He cut it down with a silver axe--      There's a tree in each of his million packs!--      And carried it safely over the snow      And down our chimney and here, you know;      Its golden cobwebs that glint and gleam      He took from a lovely Christmas dream      And tangled them over it till, behold,      It shines like the fabled Fleece of Gold!                    Oh, Santa Claus, here's                    A thrice three cheers      For garlands green and berries of red,      And mistletoe clustering overhead,      For the joy of our Christmas festival!      But our beautiful tree, it is best of all!        _And circling still in a merry ring        We'll still clasp hands as we dance and sing        To the blessed tree and the blessed night        When the Christ-child walks in the candles' light!_        Hurrah! Hurrah! for the Christmas-tree!      And look, O look to its tip and see      The feathery slim fir leaves and where,      In the topmost boughs, is the image fair      Of the Christ-child nestling amid the green      And the little brown cones that peep between!        And high above Him glittering bright      A gold star sparkles with golden light,      And we children think, as we gaze on them,      Of the wonderful Star of Bethlehem,                  Of the lovely Star                    And the Kings who far,      Oh, far, came seeking a Babe and brought      Their love and worship to Him they sought,      And made Him gifts, as the gifts we make      With loving hearts for that Baby's sake.        _Oh, come, come all, and join the ring!        Let all clasp hands as we dance and sing        To the blessed tree and the blessed night        When the Christ-child walks in the candles' light!_          OUR KITTENS          Our kittens have the softest fur,      And the sweetest little purr,      And such little velvet paws      With such cunning little claws,      And blue eyes, just like the sky!      (_Must_ they turn green, by and by?)      Two are striped like tigers, three      Are as black as black can be,      And they run so fast and play      With their tails, and are so gay,      Is it not a pity that      Each must grow into a cat?          IN JULY          Let us find a shady wady        Pretty little brook;      Let us have some candy handy,        And a picture-book.        There all day we'll stay and play and        Never mind the heat,      While the water gleaming, streaming,        Ripples round our feet.        And we'll gather curly pearly        Mussel-shells while bright      Frightened minnows darting, parting,        Scurry out of sight.        What if, what if,--heigho! my oh!--        All the \"ifs\" were true,      And the little fishes wishes,        Now, what would you do?          A VALENTINE TO A LITTLE CHILD          Dear heart, on this thrice-blessed day,        An thou my sweetheart be,      The rose of love shall bide alway        Upon the red-rose tree.        And in the garden of my heart        So ceaselessly shall shine,      The little birds will know thou art        Mine own true Valentine.        And I will bid them wing and sing        To all good winds that blow,      That to thy little feet they bring        All blessings, even so.        And o'er thy cradle I will coax,        By every lucky charm,     "]]]
