Jim was tall, a little heavier; he had a careless, tidy  look; his eyes were searching, and though he appeared a young man, his  hair was white.    \"I shore am glad to see you all,\" said Jim, in slow, soft, Southern  accent.    \"Get down, get down,\" was Frank's welcome--a typically Western one, for  we had already gotten down; \"an' come in. You must be worked out. Sure  you've come a long way.\" He was quick of speech, full of nervous  energy, and beamed with hospitality.    The cabin was the rudest kind of log affair, with a huge stone  fireplace in one end, deer antlers and coyote skins on the wall,  saddles and cowboys' traps in a corner, a nice, large, promising  cupboard, and a table and chairs. Jim threw wood on a smoldering fire,  that soon blazed and crackled cheerily.    I sank down into a chair with a feeling of blessed relief. Ten days of  desert ride behind me! Promise of wonderful days before me, with the  last of the old plainsmen. No wonder a sweet sense of ease stole over  me, or that the fire seemed a live and joyously welcoming thing, or  that Jim's deft maneuvers in preparation of supper roused in me a rapt  admiration.    \"Twenty calves this spring!\" cried Jones, punching me in my sore side.  \"Ten thousand dollars worth of calves!\"    He was now altogether a changed man; he looked almost young; his eyes  danced, and he rubbed his big hands together while he plied Frank with  questions. In strange surroundings--that is, away from his Native  Wilds, Jones had been a silent man; it had been almost impossible to  get anything out of him. But now I saw that I should come to know the  real man. In a very few moments he had talked more than on all the  desert trip, and what he said, added to the little I had already  learned, put me in possession of some interesting information as to his  buffalo.    Some years before he had conceived the idea of hybridizing buffalo with  black Galloway cattle; and with the characteristic determination and  energy of the man, he at once set about finding a suitable range. This  was difficult, and took years of searching. At last the wild north rim  of the Grand Canyon, a section unknown except to a few Indians and  mustang hunters, was settled upon. Then the gigantic task of  transporting the herd of buffalo by rail from Montana to Salt Lake was  begun. The two hundred and ninety miles of desert lying between the  home of the Mormons and Buckskin Mountain was an obstacle almost  insurmountable. The journey was undertaken and found even more trying  than had been expected. Buffalo after buffalo died on the way. Then  Frank, Jones's right-hand man, put into execution a plan he had been  thinking of--namely, to travel by night. It succeeded. The buffalo  rested in the day and traveled by easy stages by night, with the result  that the big herd was transported to the ideal range.    Here, in an environment strange to their race, but peculiarly  adaptable, they thrived and multiplied. The hybrid of the Galloway cow  and buffalo proved a great success. Jones called the new species  \"Cattalo.\" The cattalo took the hardiness of the buffalo, and never  required artificial food or shelter. He would face the desert storm or  blizzard and stand stock still in his tracks until the weather cleared.  He became quite domestic, could be easily handled, and grew exceedingly  fat on very little provender. The folds of his stomach were so numerous  that they digested even the hardest and flintiest of corn. He had  fourteen ribs on each side, while domestic cattle had only thirteen;  thus he could endure rougher work and longer journeys to water. His fur  was so dense and glossy that it equaled that of the unplucked beaver or  otter, and was fully as valuable as the buffalo robe. And not to be  overlooked by any means was the fact that his meat was delicious.    Jones had to hear every detail of all that had happened since his  absence in the East, and he was particularly inquisitive to learn all  about the twenty cattalo calves. He called different buffalo by name;  and designated the calves by descriptive terms, such as \"Whiteface\" and  \"Crosspatch.\" He almost forgot to eat, and kept Frank too busy to get  anything into his own mouth. After supper he calmed down.    \"How about your other man--Mr. Wallace, I think you said?\" asked Frank.    \"We expected to meet him at Grand Canyon Station, and then at  Flagstaff. But he didn't show up. Either he backed out or missed us.  I'm sorry; for when we get up on Buckskin, among the wild horses and  cougars, we'll be likely to need him.\"    \"I reckon you'll need me, as well as Jim,\" said Frank dryly, with a  twinkle in his eye. \"The buffs are in good shape an' can get along  without me for a while.\"    \"That'll be fine. How about cougar sign on the mountain?\"    \"Plenty. I've got two spotted near Clark Spring. Comin' over two weeks  ago I tracked them in the snow along the trail for miles. We'll ooze  over that way, as it's goin' toward the Siwash. The Siwash breaks of  the Canyon--there's the place for lions. I met a wild-horse wrangler  not long back, an' he was tellin' me about Old Tom an' the colts he'd  killed this winter.\"    Naturally, I here expressed a desire to know more of Old Tom.    \"He's the biggest cougar ever known of in these parts. His tracks are  bigger than a horse's, an' have been seen on Buckskin for twelve years.  This wrangler--his name is Clark--said he'd turned his saddle horse out  to graze near camp, an' Old Tom sneaked in an' downed him. The lions  over there are sure a bold bunch. Well, why shouldn't they be? No one  ever hunted them. You see, the mountain is hard to get at. But now  you're here, if it's big cats you want we sure can find them. Only be  easy, be easy. You've all the time there is. An' any job on Buckskin  will take time. We'll look the calves over, an' you must ride the range  to harden up. Then we'll ooze over toward Oak. I expect it'll be boggy,  an' I hope the snow melts soon.\"    \"The snow hadn't melted on Greenland point,\" replied Jones. \"We saw  that with a glass from the El Tovar. We wanted to cross that way, but  Rust said Bright Angel Creek was breast high to a horse, and that creek  is the trail.\"    \"There's four feet of snow on Greenland,\" said Frank. \"It was too early  to come that way. There's only about three months in the year the  Canyon can be crossed at Greenland.\"    \"I want to get in the snow,\" returned Jones. \"This bunch of long-eared  canines I brought never smelled a lion track. Hounds can't be trained  quick without snow. You've got to see what they're trailing, or you  can't break them.\"    Frank looked dubious. \"'Pears to me we'll have trouble gettin' a lion  without lion dogs. It takes a long time to break a hound off of deer,  once he's chased them. Buckskin is full of deer, wolves, coyotes, and  there's the wild horses. We couldn't go a hundred feet without crossin'  trails.\"    \"How's the hound you and Jim fetched in las' year? Has he got a good  nose? Here he is--I like his head. Come here, Bowser--what's his name?\"    \"Jim named him Sounder, because he sure has a voice. It's great to hear  him on a trail. Sounder has a nose that can't be fooled, an' he'll  trail anythin'; but I don't know if he ever got up a lion.\"    Sounder wagged his bushy tail and looked up affectionately at Frank. He  had a fine head, great brown eyes, very long ears and curly  brownish-black hair. He was not demonstrative, looked rather askance at  Jones, and avoided the other dogs.    \"That dog will make a great lion-chaser,\" said Jones, decisively, after  his study of Sounder. \"He and Moze will keep us busy, once they learn  we want lions.\"    \"I don't believe any dog-trainer could teach them short of six months,\"  replied Frank. \"Sounder is no spring chicken; an' that black and dirty  white cross between a cayuse an' a barb-wire fence is an old dog. You  can't teach old dogs new tricks.\"    Jones smiled mysteriously, a smile of conscious superiority, but said  nothing.    \"We'll shore hev a storm to-morrow,\" said Jim, relinquishing his pipe  long enough to speak. He had been silent, and now his meditative gaze  was on the west, through the cabin window, where a dull afterglow faded  under the heavy laden clouds of night and left the horizon dark.    I was very tired when I lay down, but so full of excitement that sleep  did not soon visit my eyelids. The talk about buffalo, wild-horse  hunters, lions and dogs, the prospect of hard riding and unusual  adventure; the vision of Old Tom that had already begun to haunt me,  filled my mind with pictures and fancies. The other fellows dropped off  to sleep, and quiet reigned. Suddenly a succession of queer, sharp  barks came from the plain, close to the cabin. Coyotes were paying us a  call, and judging from the chorus of yelps and howls from our dogs, it  was not a welcome visit. Above the medley rose one big, deep, full  voice that I knew at once belonged to Sounder. Then all was quiet  again. Sleep gradually benumbed my senses. Vague phrases dreamily  drifted to and fro in my mind: \"Jones's wild range--Old  Tom--Sounder--great name--great voice--Sounder! Sounder! Sounder--\"    Next morning I could hardly crawl out of my sleeping-bag. My bones  ached, my muscles protested excruciatingly, my lips burned and bled,  and the cold I had contracted on the desert clung to me. A good brisk  walk round the corrals, and then breakfast, made me feel better.    \"Of course you can ride?\" queried Frank.    My answer was not given from an overwhelming desire to be truthful.  Frank frowned a little, as it wondering how a man could have the nerve  to start out on a jaunt with Buffalo Jones without being a good  horseman. To be unable to stick on the back of a wild mustang, or a  cayuse, was an unpardonable sin in Arizona. My frank admission was made  relatively, with my mind "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20571"],[0,"Woman's Work in Music (#5)"],[1,"Wacht-Lieder,\" or watch-songs. In these  the amorous knight is represented as pleading with the watchman of the  castle for admission to his lady-love. Sometimes the song took the form  of a warning from the watchman, telling that daylight was near and the  knight must depart.    Besides giving the world a host of shorter songs, the period of the  Minnesingers brought forth some really great poets who were successful  in the larger forms. The author, or authors, of the famous  \"Nibelungenlied\" are unknown; but the work remains to us as the greatest  epic of Germany. Foremost in point of fame stands Wolfram von  Eschenbach, author of the familiar \"Parzifal.\" In depicting his  characters, he strikes a note of idealistic beauty. Another great poet  was Gottfried of Strasburg, almost as famous as Wolfram, and in some  respects his opposite. His characters are endowed with life and vigour,  and eager to seize the pleasures of earth while they last. His best work  was \"Tristan and Isolde.\"    The legend of Tannhaeuser, which has crystallized and been handed down to  us in story, has an undoubted basis of fact. The existence of the cave  of Venus, in the Thuringian hill of Hoerselburg, may be taken as not  proven; but there certainly was a tournament of song at the castle of  the Wartburg, and many famous knights probably took part in it. Whether  Tannhaeuser himself was real is an open question; but there can be no  doubt about Walther von der Vogelweide, who was one of Germany's  greatest masters in the shorter forms.    Examples of still another style in the work of the Minnesingers are  almost surely a direct imitation of the work of the Trouveres of  Northern France. These examples consist of more or less lengthy fables,  or sometimes tales with a pleasing moral attached. Many stories of Roman  history are found among these, and many of the proverbs which we use  without thinking of their authorship date from this time. Among the  latter are, \"Set not the wolf to guard the sheep,\" \"Never borrow  trouble,\"      \"The king must die,     And so must I,\"    and many other such gems of wisdom.    In all this the women had some share, if they did not play so important  part as their sisters in France. Their position as hostesses, or as the  objects of poetical tribute, enabled them to comment and criticize, and,  if they did little actual composing, they were allowed to take a  prominent part in the performance of music. We find in the old books of  rules and codes of education that the woman of rank and position was  possessed of many accomplishments, if not exactly those that are  expected to-day. One of these codes, or Essenhamens, as they were  called, gives the four chief duties of women, and, making allowance for  the change in civilization, they correspond fairly well with those  already quoted from the present German Empress. The cooking and sewing  remain the same, but, instead of amusing the children, the women were  expected to care for children of a larger growth, by obtaining a  knowledge of surgery. The chatelaine was supposed to take full charge of  her lord if he returned wounded from tourney or battle. Instead of  church matters, the final accomplishment was the secular game of chess.    Another work of the time gives rules of behaviour for women, inculcating  a submissive demeanour that is hardly practised to-day. The usual  modesty of deportment was prescribed; women were always to direct their  glances discreetly downward, and in the case of a stranger were to  speak only when addressed. If a room were full of women, and a man  should suddenly enter, the rules of decorum compelled them to rise  immediately, and remain standing until he should seat himself.    The extent of knightly devotion to women in the age of chivalry can  hardly be exaggerated. The work of Ulrich von Lichtenstein, for  instance, in his \"Frauendienst,\" is full of the most absurd  performances, which any sensible lady would have been justified in  repudiating. The Troubadours indulged in even greater vagaries, and one  Pierre Vidal, in love with a certain Louve de Penautier, whose first  name meant \"she-wolf,\" adopted the name of Loup, and actually assumed a  wolf skin as his garment. To prove his sincerity even more, he insisted  upon being completely wrapped in this hide and hunted by hounds and  horsemen. After the dogs had caught him, he would not allow them to be  pulled off, but insisted upon enduring their attacks for the glory of  his lady-love. When nearly dead, he was rescued and taken to her castle,  where he recovered health if not mental balance.    More noble than any of these was the tribute paid to women by the  Minnesinger Henry of Meissen. Declining to single out any one fair Muse,  he sang of womankind as a whole, and never ceased to praise their  purity, their gentleness, and their nobility. Through his life he was  honoured by them with the title of \"Frauenlob\" (praise of women), and at  his death they marched in the funeral procession, and each threw a  flower into his grave, making it overflow with blossoms.    The royal house of Suabia did its best to encourage the art of the  Minnesingers, allowing them a liberty of criticism that would ordinarily  be undreamed of in court life. It is in an epoch little later than this  that we find a singer expressing one of his objections to royalty in the  following verse:      \"King Rudolf is a worthy king,       All praise to him be brought;     He likes to hear the masters play and sing,       But after that he gives them naught.\"    The rise of the Troubadours is due wholly to Oriental influences. There  may have been some native poetry among the pastoral races of the sunny  land of Provence, where the guild flourished, but not a single line of  it remains to us. Moreover, it is certain that the Eastern minstrels  left their impress in Spain, and that the Crusaders brought back from  the Orient, among many other novelties, the custom of encouraging  minstrelsy. The Arabian bards sang chiefly of love, as they well might  in a land where female loveliness received such excessive worship. At  the Saracenic courts, the bards were ever ready to win gratitude, and  even more substantial rewards, by praising the latest favourite at the  expense of former beauties. Provence, with its dazzling sun and glowing  climate, possessed a striking resemblance to the Eastern countries, and  among its inhabitants were many who could boast an Oriental ancestry. No  less than five times did Saracen emirs lead their hosts into the  country, endeavouring to overcome it not only by force of arms, but by  the more peaceful and more certain method of introducing their own  industries and customs. Provence itself was a land of peace and repose,  and could better encourage gentler arts than the warlike nations of  Northern Spain. We may find the Troubadours definitely established there  in the early part of the twelfth century.    The language of their songs is the beautiful \"Langue d'oc,\" so called  from the use of the word \"oc\" to mean yes, and thus distinguished from  the \"Langue d'oil\" of Northern France and the \"Lingua di si\" of Italy.  The \"Langue d'oc\" was spoken in the entire southern part of France, and  has given its name to a province of the present. So when the nobles of  Provence, in the lordly retirement of their ancestral castles, sought an  entertainment suited to their refined and sympathetic natures, they  were soon imitated by the greater part of the nation.    The songs of the Troubadours were in many cases taken directly from  Eastern models. In early Arabian times it was customary for two  shepherds to converse in music by intoning responsive phrases on their  flutes; and it soon became customary for two minstrels to sing in like  manner. In the early songs of the Bible, too, are many verses whose  second half answers the first, and, in fact, the Hebrew words for  \"answer\" and \"sing\" are said to be identical. Among the Troubadours,  this species of musical dialogue took the form of the tenson, or  contention. The use of answering couplets in solo songs is another point  of resemblance. Another favourite Arabian form was the casida, or stanza  constructed with only one rhyme, and the rich and melodious Provencal  tongue lent itself excellently to poems of this structure. So successful  were the Troubadours in using it that sometimes their compositions were  over a hundred lines in length. The short but brilliant Arabian lyrics,  called \"Maouchah,\" or embroidery, were well imitated by dainty and  sparkling lyrics of the Troubadours. The Oriental mourning song became  the Planh, or dirge. The evening tribute of the Arabian minstrels to  their chosen loves became the serenade, while the Troubadours went  still further in this vein by originating the aubade, or morning song.  Among the other forms used, the verse was merely a set of couplets, the  chanson was divided into several stanzas, while the sonnet was much  freer in form than at present. When more than two singers took part in a  tenson, it became a tournament. The sirvente was a song of war or  politics, sometimes satirical, sometimes in praise of the exploits of a  generous patron. The sixtine contained six stanzas of six lines each,  with the rhymes holding over from one stanza to the next, and occurring  in a different order in each stanza. The rhymes in the sirvente differed  from what we consider correct by consisting always of a repetition of  the same word. The discord was a sort of free fantasia, sometimes in  several dialects. The pastorelle was of pastoral character, usually  consisting of short lines and containing a dialogue.    Among the more narrative forms are found the ballad, more especially  favoured by the Trouveres, or minstrels of the \"Langue d'oil\" regions.  It gave rise to the various metres used in the epics, and sometimes  formed the basis of these longer works. In general, the Trouveres"]]]
