If found guilty, upon trial, he was to be adjudged by the  court to quit the Province, and if he still proved contumacious he was  to be deemed guilty of felony, and to suffer death as a felon, without  benefit of clergy. This statute, be it observed, was not passed at  Westminster during the supremacy of the Plantagenets or the Tudors, but  at York, Upper Canada, during the forty-fourth year of the reign of  George the Third. More than one eminent authority has pronounced it an  unconstitutional measure. There was, however, some show of justification  for it at the time of its enactment, for the Province was then overrun  by disloyal immigrants from Ireland and by republican immigrants from  across the borders, many of whom tried to stir up discontent among the  people, and were notoriously in favour of annexation to the United  States.[8] It was against such persons that the Act had been levelled,  and there had never been any question of attempting to apply it to  anyone else. Now, however, it was pressed into requisition in order to  compass the ruin of as loyal a subject as could have been found  throughout the wide expanse of the British Empire; who had resided in  Upper Canada for a continuous period of nearly eighteen months; who was  no more an alien than the King upon the throne; and whose only real  offence was that he would not stand calmly by while rapacious and  dishonest placemen carried on their nefarious practices without protest.    Among the various dignitaries authorized to put the law in motion, by  the issue of a warrant under the Act, were the members of the  Legislative and Executive Councils. William Dickson and William Claus,  as has been seen, were members of the former body; and as such they had  power over the liberty of anyone whose loyalty they thought fit to call  in question. Dickson was a connection by marriage of Mr. Gourlay, and  for some months after that gentleman's arrival in this Province had gone  heart and hand with him in his schemes of reform. For Mr. Dickson then  had a grievance of his own, arising out of the partial interdict of  immigration from the United States which had been adopted after the War  of 1812-15. He was the owner of an immense quantity of uncultivated  land in the Province, including the township of Dumfries already  mentioned, which he was desirous of selling to incoming settlers. The  shutting out of United States immigrants tended to retard the progress  of settlement and the sale of his property. His anger against the  Administration had been hot and bitter, and he had even gone so far as  to state publicly that he would rather live under the American than  under the British Government. But he had managed to induce the Assembly  to pass certain resolutions, recognizing the right of subjects of the  United States to settle in Upper Canada. The restrictions being relaxed,  his only cause of hostility to the Administration vanished, and he  ceased to clamour against it. His sympathy with Mr. Gourlay's projects  vanished into thin air. Those projects contemplated enquiry and reform.  Dickson, having accomplished his own ends, desired no further reform;  and as for enquiry, he had excellent reasons for burking it, as it would  probably lead to the disclosure of certain reprehensible transactions on  the part of himself and Claus, the Indian agent. He therefore presented  a sudden change of front, and, so far from continuing to act with Mr.  Gourlay, he became that unfortunate man's bitterest foe.    How far Dickson's enmity was stimulated by cooeperation with the leaders  of the Compact party at York will probably never be known. That there  was something more than a merely tacit understanding that Mr. Gourlay  was to be got rid of is beyond question. But before any arrest could be  effected under the Act of 1804 it was necessary that perjured testimony  should be forthcoming. It was easily provided. On the 18th of December,  1818, a secret consultation took place between Dickson and one Isaac  Swayze, at the former's private abode. Swayze was a resident of the  Niagara District, and the representative of the Fourth Riding of Lincoln  in the Legislative Assembly, but was nevertheless a man of indifferent  character, and so illiterate as to be barely able to write his name.  During the Revolutionary War he had been a spy and \"horse-provider\" to  the loyalist troops. More recently he had been chiefly known as one of  the most bigoted and unprincipled of the Compact's minor satellites; a  hanger-on who was ever ready to undertake any disreputable work which  the Executive might have for him to do. He was a smooth-tongued  hypocrite, who made extravagant professions of zeal for religion when he  was in the society of religious people, but afterwards laughed at their  credulity for believing him. \"When electioneering,\" said he, \"I pray  with the Methodists.\" At other times he gained votes by threatening to  bring down upon the electors the vengeance of the Executive, who, he  averred, were specially desirous of having his services in the Assembly.  Corruption can always find apt tools to do its bidding.       \"Where'er down Tiber garbage floats, the greedy pike ye see;     And wheresoe'er such lord is found, such client still will be.\"    Isaac Swayze was a veritable modern counterpart of the client Marcus,  and when he gained votes by holding his patrons _in terrorem_ over the  heads of the electors, he was merely echoing his ancient prototype:--       \"I wait on Appius Claudius, I waited on his sire;     Let him who works the client wrong beware the patron's ire.\"    His employers knew their man, and that he would not stick at a trifle to  keep their favour. On the day after his secret interview with Dickson he  proved his subordination to authority by committing wilful and  deliberate perjury. He swore that Mr. Gourlay was an evil-minded and  seditious person, who was endeavouring to raise a rebellion against the  government of Upper Canada; that he, deponent, verily believed that said  Gourlay had not been an inhabitant of the Province for six months, and  had not taken the oath of allegiance.[9]    On the strength of this sworn statement, Mr. Gourlay was arrested under  the Alien Act of 1804, and carried before Dickson and Claus, both of  whom were specially and personally interested in putting him to silence.  The examination and hearing before them, which took place on the 21st of  December, was a transparent mockery of justice. Dickson, Claus and  Swayze, in common with nearly every one in Upper Canada, well knew that  their victim had been resident in the Province for nearly three times  the period specified in the Act. Dickson had been in constant and  familiar intercourse with him for sixteen months. Claus had known him  nearly as long. Swayze had conversed with him at York more than a year  before, and had been acquainted with his proceedings from month to  month--almost from week to week--during the entire interval. The charge  of being an evil-minded and seditious person was too absurd to be  seriously entertained for a moment by any one who knew Mr. Gourlay as  intimately as Dickson had done for more than eight years.[10] As for his  not having taken the oath of allegiance, it had never been required of  him, and he was both able and willing to take it with a clear and honest  conscience. But as matter of fact no one suspected his loyalty, and the  charge against him was the veriest pretext that malice could invent.  When he appeared before his judges, however, Messieurs Dickson and Claus  professed to be dissatisfied with his defence, and alleged that his  \"words, actions, conduct and behaviour\" had been such as to promote  disaffection. They accordingly adjudged that he should leave the  Province within ten days. A written order, signed by them, enjoining his  departure, was delivered to him. \"To have obeyed this order,\" writes Mr.  Gourlay,[11] \"would have proved ruinous to the business for which, at  great expense, and with much trouble, I had qualified myself. It would  have been a tacit acknowledgment of guilt, whereof I was unconscious. It  would have been a surrender of the noblest British right; it would have  been holding light my natural allegiance; it would have been a  declaration that the Bill of Rights was a Bill of Wrongs. I resolved to  endure any hardship rather than to submit voluntarily.\"    He paid a heavy penalty for his disobedience. On the 4th of January,  1819--the third day after the expiration of the period allowed him for  departure--Dickson and Claus issued an order of commitment, under which  he was arrested and lodged in Niagara jail, there to remain until the  next sitting of the Court of Oyer and Terminer. His pugnacity was by  this time fully aroused, and he determined to fight his ground inch by  inch. After some delay, he caused himself to be taken before Chief  Justice Powell, at York, under a writ of _habeas corpus_, for the  purpose of being either discharged from custody or admitted to bail. The  argument was heard on the 8th of February, when several persons of  wealth and good social position presented themselves, and offered to  become responsible to any amount for his appearance whenever called upon  to stand his trial. The attorney who argued the cause on behalf of the  prisoner presented three affidavits, made respectively by the Honourable  Robert Hamilton, Peter Hamilton, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22136"],[0,"The Book-Hunter (#5)"],[1,"was getting a good ducking but myself, a large       miscreant of a wave contrived to escape every other passenger, and       to settle right upon my shoulders. I have not yet secured a       lodging in Edinburgh, but have been wandering through all the       streets admiring. Of the Old Town I think far more than of the New,       it is so majestic and magnificent, and am resolved, if I can, to       live in it.         \"I dined at Mr Dauney's to-day.

HILL BURTON.         \"_P.S._--I would have written you a long letter, but do not wish to       absent myself from table.\"           *       *       *       *       *         \"11 KEIR STREET, EDINBURGH,       _Tuesday Evening, 9th Nov. 1830_.         \"MY DEAR MOTHER,--I take the opportunity of Mr Innes's parcel,       which leaves this to-morrow afternoon, to give you a more succinct       account of my affairs than you could derive from my laconic epistle       of last week. I must, however, preface by requesting you to write       me as soon as you conveniently can, either by Innes or L. Smith's       conveyance, as I am anxious to hear the state of your cold, and how       James is succeeding at school.         \"When I dismounted from the coach I was peculiarly struck by the       sight of magnificent streets, with scarcely a human being to be       seen along them. I expected to have found them of that crowded       description so often characteristic of a metropolis; but to one who       is accustomed to see our grand mercantile thoroughfare, the       paucity of perambulators in _some_ of the streets of Edinburgh       appears rather peculiar. _Others_ I found at particular periods to       be thickly inhabited. My first course was to direct my course       through the rain to G.B.'s dwelling, where I found him reading a       large Bible. He appears to have carried fanaticism to a ridiculous       pitch, unworthy of his education and station in life. He put into       my hands a tract (composed I am afraid by himself), with       injunctions to read it. I intend to send it to you as a curiosity.       His brother Charles, whom I best knew, used to be a clever and       sensible boy, very well informed; I hope he, too, is not also among       the prophets. How few steer a middle course! G.B. cannot do the       most trifling act without connecting it with religion. It is a mere       disease. Others never think of it at all. I think it is Dr Johnson       who says something to this effect: '----was mad, and showed it by       kneeling down and saying his prayers on the street. Now there are       many men who are not mad, yet I am afraid are worse than poor ----,       for they never pray at all.' But to return--I inquired at Mr B. if       he could recommend me to any cheap and respectable lodging. After       applying some thought to the subject, he began to recollect that he       did know of one or two. With regard to one the address was rather       imperfect, as he knew neither the name nor the number, but had a       guess of the street. The other I discovered, and now occupy,       although he gave me both a wrong name and wrong number.         \"Immediately on leaving B.'s I went to Dauney, who appeared glad to       see me, and kindly asked me to dine with him. He has a very       handsome house. Mrs Dauney is a very agreeable person, and they       have two children. He would not hear of my leaving him till I had       got accommodated with good lodgings. The rooms I now occupy I did       not enter till yesterday. They were inhabited by a person just       about to leave them, and I had no recommendation to others so well       situated. The person who keeps the lodgings is named M'Gregor. I       have a room and closet, neat enough, for which I pay 8s. a-week,       which includes coals. I could not have a place nearly so cheap in       the New Town. The situation is delightful. It is behind the Old       Town, and the windows look across towards it and the Castle, just       as those in Union Terrace look towards Belmont Street. The view       extends as far as the Firth of Forth.         \"There are, moreover, other advantages. Heriot's Hospital and the       old city wall are close by; and when I choose I may, in going to       the New Town, pass through the West Port and the Grassmarket.         \"I have been a good deal annoyed about my luggage, which has not       yet been sent up, so that you may imagine some of my present       drapery has been worn long enough.         \"I directed a person, calling himself the Clyde Shipping Company's       agent here, to get them sent up last Saturday, which was to be done       'pointedly.' I amused myself from day to day annoying the man, till       at last his patience appeared determined to weather out mine, so I       went to Leith to-day and saw after them myself--found the man had       nothing to do whatever with the concern, and neither could nor did       give directions. The clerk, after blessing himself the usual number       of times, stated his opinion that it would have been better for       both parties had they left his office some time ago, so I expect to       see them early to-morrow. I will let you know of their safe arrival       if before three. I read your poetry[5] all over, but did I begin to       remark on it here I would exceed the limits which a narration of       facts has left me. It has afforded me much pleasure in the       loneliness, which, of course, I feel a little at first. However, I       cannot say it makes me at all sad. There is something independent       and free in the idea that none of the vast multitude you are among       cares more for your life or welfare than the breeze that passes. I       begin my studies to-morrow, and if I behave properly will have a       good deal to do.         [Footnote 5: Mrs Burton wrote verses well. She occasionally       published in the 'Gentleman's Magazine.']         \"By the way, I may here mention a somewhat important circumstance.       The greater part of the entrance fee is paid immediately on passing       the Civil Law trial, which you know I wished to do this spring. The       whole fee is less than L300, and the part payable _then_ is more       than L200. The fees are to be raised, but the increase cannot be       levied upon me; it only applies to those who have not commenced       their studies at the period of raising. Speak to R. Alcock about       this. I daily meet troops of Aberdonians. I dined on Friday last       with a young man, Fordyce, and yesterday with Mr J.

He is the proprietor of the       Miscellany.[6] By the way, I find out that if I do not pass my       Civil Law trial before 1832 I shall be compelled to pay L50 to a       Widows' Fund.

The last examination this       year will be on _Tuesday week_,--the last for passing which L50 and       an annual payment of L7 is not charged. Now for this examination I       intend to prepare myself, unless you inform me _immediately_ that       the money, L213, cannot be obtained.

Should I find it       _impossible_, I will still reserve to myself, even after you send       the money, the power of withdrawing.
