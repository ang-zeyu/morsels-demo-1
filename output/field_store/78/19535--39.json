We now incurred less of actual danger but more  fatigue, and it was only after infinite trouble, owing to the rocks and  tangled vegetation, that we got ourselves and our horses upon the saddle  from which this small stream descended; by that time clouds had descended  upon us, and it was raining heavily.  Moreover, it was six o'clock and we  were tired out, having made perhaps six miles in twelve hours.    On the saddle there was some coarse grass which was in full seed, and  therefore very nourishing for the horses; also abundance of anise and sow-  thistle, of which they are extravagantly fond, so we turned them loose  and prepared to camp.  Everything was soaking wet and we were  half-perished with cold; indeed we were very uncomfortable.  There was  brushwood about, but we could get no fire till we had shaved off the wet  outside of some dead branches and filled our pockets with the dry inside  chips.  Having done this we managed to start a fire, nor did we allow it  to go out when we had once started it; we pitched the tent and by nine  o'clock were comparatively warm and dry.  Next morning it was fine; we  broke camp, and after advancing a short distance we found that, by  descending over ground less difficult than yesterday's, we should come  again upon the river-bed, which had opened out above the gorge; but it  was plain at a glance that there was no available sheep country, nothing  but a few flats covered with scrub on either side the river, and  mountains which were perfectly worthless.  But we could see the main  range.  There was no mistake about this.  The glaciers were tumbling down  the mountain sides like cataracts, and seemed actually to descend upon  the river-bed; there could be no serious difficulty in reaching them by  following up the river, which was wide and open; but it seemed rather an  objectless thing to do, for the main range looked hopeless, and my  curiosity about the nature of the country above the gorge was now quite  satisfied; there was no money in it whatever, unless there should be  minerals, of which I saw no more signs than lower down.    However, I resolved that I would follow the river up, and not return  until I was compelled to do so.  I would go up every branch as far as I  could, and wash well for gold.  Chowbok liked seeing me do this, but it  never came to anything, for we did not even find the colour.  His dislike  of the main range appeared to have worn off, and he made no objections to  approaching it.  I think he thought there was no danger of my trying to  cross it, and he was not afraid of anything on this side; besides, we  might find gold.  But the fact was that he had made up his mind what to  do if he saw me getting too near it.    We passed three weeks in exploring, and never did I find time go more  quickly.  The weather was fine, though the nights got very cold.  We  followed every stream but one, and always found it lead us to a glacier  which was plainly impassable, at any rate without a larger party and  ropes.  One stream remained, which I should have followed up already, had  not Chowbok said that he had risen early one morning while I was yet  asleep, and after going up it for three or four miles, had seen that it  was impossible to go farther.  I had long ago discovered that he was a  great liar, so I was bent on going up myself: in brief, I did so: so far  from being impossible, it was quite easy travelling; and after five or  six miles I saw a saddle at the end of it, which, though covered deep in  snow, was not glaciered, and which did verily appear to be part of the  main range itself.  No words can express the intensity of my delight.  My  blood was all on fire with hope and elation; but on looking round for  Chowbok, who was behind me, I saw to my surprise and anger that he had  turned back, and was going down the valley as hard as he could.  He had  left me.          CHAPTER IV: THE SADDLE      I cooeyed to him, but he would not hear.  I ran after him, but he had got  too good a start.  Then I sat down on a stone and thought the matter  carefully over.  It was plain that Chowbok had designedly attempted to  keep me from going up this valley, yet he had shown no unwillingness to  follow me anywhere else.  What could this mean, unless that I was now  upon the route by which alone the mysteries of the great ranges could be  revealed?  What then should I do?  Go back at the very moment when it had  become plain that I was on the right scent?  Hardly; yet to proceed alone  would be both difficult and dangerous.  It would be bad enough to return  to my master's run, and pass through the rocky gorges, with no chance of  help from another should I get into a difficulty; but to advance for any  considerable distance without a companion would be next door to madness.  Accidents which are slight when there is another at hand (as the  spraining of an ankle, or the falling into some place whence escape would  be easy by means of an outstretched hand and a bit of rope) may be fatal  to one who is alone.  The more I pondered the less I liked it; and yet,  the less could I make up my mind to return when I looked at the saddle at  the head of the valley, and noted the comparative ease with which its  smooth sweep of snow might be surmounted: I seemed to see my way almost  from my present position to the very top.  After much thought, I resolved  to go forward until I should come to some place which was really  dangerous, but then to return.  I should thus, I hoped, at any rate reach  the top of the saddle, and satisfy myself as to what might be on the  other side.    I had no time to lose, for it was now between ten and eleven in the  morning.  Fortunately I was well equipped, for on leaving the camp and  the horses at the lower end of the valley I had provided myself  (according to my custom) with everything that I was likely to want for  four or five days.  Chowbok had carried half, but had dropped his whole  swag--I suppose, at the moment of his taking flight--for I came upon it  when I ran after him.  I had, therefore, his provisions as well as my  own.  Accordingly, I took as many biscuits as I thought I could carry,  and also some tobacco, tea, and a few matches.  I rolled all these things  (together with a flask nearly full of brandy, which I had kept in my  pocket for fear lest Chowbok should get hold of it) inside my blankets,  and strapped them very tightly, making the whole into a long roll of some  seven feet in length and six inches in diameter.  Then I tied the two  ends together, and put the whole round my neck and over one shoulder.  This is the easiest way of carrying a heavy swag, for one can rest one's  self by shifting the burden from one shoulder to the other.  I strapped  my pannikin and a small axe about my waist, and thus equipped began to  ascend the valley, angry at having been misled by Chowbok, but determined  not to return till I was compelled to do so.    I crossed and recrossed the stream several times without difficulty, for  there were many good fords.  At one o'clock I was at the foot of the  saddle; for four hours I mounted, the last two on the snow, where the  going was easier; by five, I was within ten minutes of the top, in a  state of excitement greater, I think, than I had ever known before.  Ten  minutes more, and the cold air from the other side came rushing upon me.    A glance.  I was _not_ on the main range.    Another glance.  There was an awful river, muddy and horribly angry,  roaring over an immense river-bed, thousands of feet below me.    It went round to the westward, and I could see no farther up the valley,  save that there were enormous glaciers which must extend round the source  of the river, and from which it must spring.    Another glance, and then I remained motionless.    There was an easy pass in the mountains directly opposite to me, through  which I caught a glimpse of an immeasurable extent of blue and distant  plains.    Easy?  Yes, perfectly easy; grassed nearly to the summit, which was, as  it were, an open path between two glaciers, from which an inconsiderable  stream came tumbling down over rough but very possible hillsides, till it  got down to the level of the great river, and formed a flat where there  was grass and a small bush of stunted timber.    Almost before I could believe my eyes, a cloud had come up from the  valley on the other side, and the plains were hidden.  What wonderful  luck was mine!  Had I arrived five minutes later, the cloud would have  been over the pass, and I should not have known of its existence.  Now  that the cloud was there, I began to doubt my memory, and to be uncertain  whether it had been more than a blue line of distant vapour that had  filled up the opening.  I could only be certain of this much, namely,  that the river in the valley below must be the one next to the northward  of that which flowed past my master's station; of this there could be no  doubt.  Could I, however, imagine that my luck should have led me up a  wrong river in search of a pass, and yet brought me to the spot where I  could detect the one weak place in the fortifications of a more northern  basin?  This was too improbable.  But even as I doubted there came a rent  in the cloud opposite, and a second time I saw blue lines of heaving  downs, growing gradually fainter, and retiring into a far space of plain.  It was substantial; there had been no mistake whatsoever.  I had hardly  made myself perfectly sure of this, ere the rent in the clouds joined up  again and I could see nothing more.    What, then, should I do?  The night would be upon me shortly, and I was  already chilled with standing still after the exertion of climbing.  To  stay where I was would be impossible; I must either go backwards or  forwards.  I found a rock which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19061"],[0,"Seeing Europe with Famous Authors, Volume 8 (#5)"],[1," and see, at every turn, the little  familiar tokens of human habitation and everyday pursuits, the chafing  of the bucket-rope in the stone rim of the exhausted well; the track of  carriage-wheels in the pavement of the street; the marks of  drinking-vessels on the stone counter of the wine-shop; the amphorae in  private cellars, stored away so many hundred years ago, and undisturbed  to this hour--all rendering the solitude and deadly lonesomeness of the  place, ten thousand times more solemn, than if the volcano, in its fury,  had swept the city from the earth, and sunk it in the bottom of the sea.          THE TOMB OF VIRGIL[7]    BY AUGUSTUS J. C. HARE      A road to the right at the end of the Chiaja, leads to the mouth of the  Grotto of Posilipo, above which those who do not wish to leave their  carriages may see, high on the left, close above the grotto, the ruined  columbarium known as the Tomb of Virgil. A door in the wall, on the left  of the approach to the grotto, and a very steep staircase, lead to the  columbarium, which is situated in a pretty fruit-garden.    Virgil desired that his body should be brought to Naples from  Brundusium, where he died, B.C. 19, and there is every probability that  he was buried on this spot, which was visited as Virgil's burial-place  little more than a century after his death by the poet Statius, who was  born at Naples, and who describes composing his own poems while seated  in the shadow of the tomb. If further confirmation were needed of the  story that Virgil was laid here, it would be found in the fact that  Silius Italicus, who lived at the same time with Statius, purchased the  tomb of Virgil, restored it from the neglect into which it had fallen,  and celebrated funeral rites before it.    The tomb was originally shaded by a gigantic bay-tree, which is said to  have died on the death of Dante. Petrarch, who was brought hither by  King Robert, planted another, which existed in the time of Sannazaro,  but was destroyed by relic-collectors in the last century. A branch was  sent to Frederick the Great by the Margravine of Baireuth, with some  verses by Voltaire. If from no other cause, the tomb would be  interesting from its visitors; here Boccaccio renounced the career of a  merchant for that of a poet, and a well-known legend, that St. Paul  visited the sepulcher of Virgil at Naples, was long commemorated in the  verse of a hymn used in the service for St. Paul's Day at Mantua.    The tomb is a small, square, vaulted chamber with three windows. Early  in the sixteenth century a funeral urn, containing the ashes of the  poet, stood in the center, supported by nine little marble pillars. Some  say that Robert of Anjou removed it, in 1326, for security to the Castel  Nuovo, others that it was given by the Government to a cardinal from  Mantua, who died at Genoa on his way home. In either event the urn is  now lost.    It is just beneath the tomb that the road to Pozzuoli enters the famous  Grotto of Posilipo, a tunnel about half a mile long, in breadth from 25  to 30 feet, and varying from about 90 feet in height near the entrance,  to little more than 20 feet at points of the interior. Petronius and  Seneca mention its narrow gloomy passage with horror, in the reign of  Nero, when it was so low that it could only be used for foot-passengers,  who were obliged to stoop in passing through.    In the fifteenth century King Alphonso I. gave it height by lowering the  floor, which was paved by Don Pedro di Toledo a hundred years later. In  the Middle Ages the grotto was ascribed to the magic arts of Virgil. In  recent years it has been the chief means of communication between Naples  and Baiae, and is at all times filled with dust and noise, the  flickering lights and resounding echoes giving it a most weird effect.  However much one may abuse Neapolitans, we may consider in their favor,  as Swinburne observes, \"what a terror this dark grotto would be in  London!\"          TWO ASCENTS OF VESUVIUS[8]    BY JOHANN WOLGANG VON GOETHE      At the foot of the steep ascent, we were received by two guides, one  old, the other young, but both active fellows. The first pulled me up  the path, the other Tischbein[9]--pulled I say, for these guides are  girded round the waist with a leathern belt, which the traveler takes  hold of, and being drawn up by his guide, makes his way the easier with  foot and staff. In this manner we reached the flat from which the cone  rises; toward the north lay the ruins of the summit.    A glance westward over the country beneath us, removed, as well as a  bath could, all feeling of exhaustion and fatigue, and we now went round  the ever-smoking cone, as it threw out its stones and ashes. Wherever  the space allowed of our viewing it at a sufficient distance, it  appeared a grand and elevating spectacle. In the first place, a violent  thundering toned forth from its deepest abyss, then stones of larger and  smaller sizes were showered into the air by thousands, and enveloped by  clouds of ashes. The greatest part fell again into the gorge; the rest  of the fragments, receiving a lateral inclination, and falling on the  outside of the crater, made a marvelous rumbling noise. First of all the  larger masses plumped against the side, and rebounded with a dull heavy  sound; then the smaller came rattling down; and last of all, drizzled a  shower of ashes. All this took place at regular intervals, which by  slowly counting, we were able to measure pretty accurately.    Between the summit, however, and the cone the space is narrow enough;  moreover, several stones fell around us, and made the circuit anything  but agreeable. Tischbein now felt more disgusted than ever with  Vesuvius, as the monster, not content with being hateful, showed an  inclination to become mischievous also.    As, however, the presence of danger generally exercises on man a kind of  attraction, and calls forth a spirit of opposition in the human breast  to defy it, I bethought myself that, in the interval of the eruptions,  it would be possible to climb up the cone to the crater, and to get back  before it broke out again. I held a council on this point with our  guides under one of the overhanging rocks of the summit, where, encamped  in safety, we refreshed ourselves with the provisions we had brought  with us. The younger guide was willing to run the risk with me; we  stuffed our hats full of linen and silk handkerchiefs, and, staff in  hand, we prepared to start, I holding on to his girdle.    The little stones were yet rattling around us, and the ashes still  drizzling, as the stalwart youth hurried forth with me across the hot  glowing rubble. We soon stood on the brink of the vast chasm, the smoke  of which, altho a gentle air was bearing it away from us, unfortunately  veiled the interior of the crater, which smoked all round from a  thousand crannies. At intervals, however, we caught sight through the  smoke of the cracked walls of the rock. The view was neither instructive  nor delightful; but for the very reason that one saw nothing, one  lingered in the hope of catching a glimpse of something more; and so we  forgot our slow counting. We were standing on a narrow ridge of the  vast abyss; of a sudden the thunder pealed aloud; we ducked our heads  involuntarily, as if that would have rescued us from the precipitated  masses. The smaller stones soon rattled, and without considering that we  had again an interval of cessation before us, and only too much rejoiced  to have outstood the danger, we rushed down and reached the foot of the  hill together with the drizzling ashes, which pretty thickly covered  our heads and shoulders....    The news [two weeks later] that an eruption of lava had just commenced,  which, taking the direction of Ottajano, was invisible at Naples,  tempted me to visit Vesuvius for the third time. Scarcely had I jumped  out of my cabriolet at the foot of the mountain, when immediately  appeared the two guides who had accompanied us on our previous ascent. I  had no wish to do without either, but took one out of gratitude and  custom, the other for reliance on his judgment--and the two for the  greater convenience. Having ascended the summit, the older guide  remained with our cloaks and refreshment, while the younger followed me,  and we boldly went straight toward a dense volume of smoke, which broke  forth from the bottom of the funnel; then we quickly went downward by  the side of it, till at last, under the clear heaven, we distinctly saw  the lava emitted from the rolling clouds of smoke.    We may hear an object spoken of a thousand times, but its peculiar  features will never be caught till we see it with our own eyes. The  stream of lava was small, not broader perhaps than ten feet, but the way  in which it flowed down a gentle and tolerably smooth plain was  remarkable. As it flowed along, it cooled both on the sides and on the  surface, so that it formed a sort of canal, the bed of which was  continually raised in consequence of the molten mass congealing even  beneath the fiery stream, which, with uniform action, precipitated right  and left the scoria which were floating on its surface. In this way a  regular dam was at length thrown up, in which the glowing stream flowed  on as quietly as any mill-stream. We passed along the tolerably high  dam, while the scoria rolled regularly off the sides at our feet. Some  cracks in the canal afforded opportunity of looking at the living  stream, from below, and as it rushed onward, we observed it from above.    A very bright sun made the glowing lava look dull; but a moderate steam  rose from it into the pure air. I felt a great desire to go nearer to  the point where it broke out from the mountain; there my guide averred,  it at once formed vaults and roofs above itself, on which he had often  stood. To see and experience this phenomenon, we again ascended the  hill, in order to come from "]]]
