The constant use of this hybrid register with children is  injurious in many ways. Its use is justified in schools merely through  custom, and it can not be doubted that as soon as the attention of  teachers is called to its evils, they will no longer tolerate its use.    The usual analogies then which are drawn between the adult female voice  and the child-voice, in so far as they imply a similar physiological  condition of the vocal organ and similar vocal training, are not only  useless, but misleading. He who tries to train the average child-voice  on the theory of two, three or five clearly-defined breaks, or natural  changes in the forms for vocal vibration assumed by the vocal bands will  get very little help from nature.    With due consideration it is said that it is a harder task to train  children's voices properly than to train the voices of adults. Where  nature is so shifty in her ways, it requires keen penetration to  discover her ends.    The child-voice is a delicate instrument. It ought not to be played upon  by every blacksmith.          CHAPTER III.    HOW TO SECURE GOOD TONE.      The practical application of the teaching of the two preceding chapters  may at first thought seem to be difficult. On the contrary, it is quite  easy. We have favorable conditions in schools; graded courses in music,  regular attendance, discipline, and women and men in charge who are  accustomed to teach. No more favorable conditions for teaching vocal  music exist than are to be found in a well-organized and  well-disciplined school. The environments of both pupils and teachers  are exactly adapted to the ready reception of ideas, on the one hand,  and the skilful imparting of them, on the other.    The abilities of the trained teachers of to-day are not half  appreciated. They often possess professional skill of the highest order,  and the supervisor of music in the public schools may count himself  exceedingly fortunate in the means he has at hand for carrying on his  work. But knowledge of voice is no more evolved from one's inner  consciousness than is knowledge of musical notation, or of the Greek  alphabet; therefore, if regular teachers in the school permit singing  which is unmusical and hurtful, it is chiefly because they are following  the usual customs, and their ears have thereby become dulled, or it may  be that even if the singing is unpleasant to them, that they do not  _know how_ to make it better. As before said, all energies have so far  been directed to the teaching of music reading. Tone has been neglected,  forgotten, or at most its improvement has been sought spasmodically. The  carelessness regarding tone, which is so prevalent, is due to an almost  entire absence of good teaching on the subject of the child-voice-- to  ignorance, let us say-- not altogether inexcusable.    Now and then, when listening to the soprani of some well-trained  boy-choir, sounding soft and mellow on the lower notes and ringing clear  and flutey on the higher, it may have dimly occurred to the teacher of  public school music that there might be things as yet unheard of in his  musical philosophy, a vague wonder and dissatisfaction, which has slowly  disappeared under the pressure of routine work.    When one reflects upon the results which the patience and skill of our  regular teachers have accomplished in teaching pupils to read music; it  can never be reasonably doubted that the same patience and skill, if  rightly directed, will be equally successful in teaching a correct use  of the voice.    Two principles form the basis of good tone-production as applied to  children's voices.    1st. _They must sing softly._    2d. _They must be restricted in compass of voice._    If these two rules are correctly applied in each grade, if pupils sing  _softly enough_, and carry their tones neither too high nor too low,  always taking into account the grade or average age of the class, then  the voice will be used _only in the thin or head-register_, and the  tones of the thick or chest-register will never be heard. But the two  rules must be as one, for if soft singing be carried too low with infant  voices, they are forced to use the thick tones; and children of all  ages, even if singing within the right compass of voice, will use the  thick register if permitted to sing too loud.    There is nothing particularly original in insisting upon soft singing  from children. The writer has never seen a book of school music that  does not mention its desirability, nor hardly a reference to the  child-voice in the standard works or writings of the day of which this  idea has not formed a part.    The general direction \"Sing softly\" is good so far as it goes, but is,  first, indefinite. Softly and loudly are relative terms, and subject to  wide diversity of interpretation. The pianissimo of a cultivated singer  is silence compared to the tone emitted by vocalists of the main  strength order, when required to produce soft tone. Secondly, the  direction is seldom or never found coupled with instruction upon the  vocal compass of children. Hence, it does not seem very strange that the  injunction \"Sing softly\" has not corrected vocal errors in school  singing.    It is not easy, it is even impossible, to accurately define soft  singing, and no attempt will be made further than to describe as clearly  as may be the degree of softness which it is necessary to insist upon if  we would secure the use of the thin or head register.    The subject of register has already been discussed, but it may not be  amiss to repeat just here that in the child larynx as in the adult the  head-register is that series of tones which are produced by the  vibration of the thin, inner edges of the vocal band. If breathing is  natural, and if the throat is open and relaxed, no strain in singing  this tone is possible. It is evident in a moment that children with  their thin, delicate vocal ligaments can make this tone even more easily  than adult sopranos, whose vocal ligaments are longer and thicker; and  it is also perfectly evident that no danger of strain to the vocal bands  is incurred when this voice is used, for all the muscles and ligaments  of the larynx are under far less tension than is required for the  production of tones in the thick register.    It must also be remembered in connection with this fact, that children  often enter school at five years of age, and that according to  physiologists the larynx does not reach the full growth in _size_,  incidental to childhood until the age of six years. We must then be  particularly careful with infant classes-- for the vocal bands of  children prior to six years of age are very, very weak. Speaking of  infant voices, Mr. W. M. Miller, in Browne and Behnke's afore-mentioned  work, \"The Child-Voice,\" is quoted as saying; \"Voice-_training_ cannot  be attempted, but voice-_destruction_ may be prevented. Soft singing is  the cure for all the ills of the vocal organs.\" It would be hard to find  a more terse or truthful statement than the first sentence of the above  as regards the voices of little children from five to seven or eight  years of age. It is unmitigated foolishness to talk about vocal training  as applied to children of that age. The voice-culture which is suited to  little children is that sort of culture which promotes growth-- food and  sleep and play. As well train a six months' old colt for the race track,  as attempt to develop the voice of a child of six or seven years with  exercises on _o_, and _ah_, _pianissimo_ and _fortissimo_, _crescendo_,  _diminuendo_ and _swell_. Their voices must be used in singing as  _lightly as possible_. This answers the question, how softly should they  sing?    Children during the first two or three years of school-life may be  permitted to sing from        [Music: e' e'']    or if the new pitch is used from        [Music: f' f'']    Two or three practical difficulties will at once occur to the teacher  with reference to songs and exercises which range lower than E first  line, and with reference to the customary teaching of the scale of C as  the initial step in singing.    The subject of compass of children's voices will be discussed at some  length in a following chapter, but for the present it may be said that  the difficulty with songs and exercises ranging below the pitch  indicated may be overcome easily by pitching the songs, etc., a tone or  two higher. If they then range too high, don't sing them, sing something  else. In teaching the scale, take E or F as the keynote, and sing either  one or the other of those scales first. The children must sing as softly  as possible in all their singing exercises, whether songs or note drill.  They should be taught to open their mouths well, to sit or stand erect  as the case may be, and under no circumstances should the instructor  sing with them. Too much importance can hardly be given to this last  statement. If teachers persist in leading the songs with their own  voices and in singing exercises with the children, they can and most  probably will defeat all efforts to secure the right tone in either the  first, or any grade up to that in which changed voices are found. This  sounds rather cynical, and might seem to imply that instructors cannot  sing well. The meaning, however, is quite different.    The quality or timbre of the adult woman's voice is wholly unlike that  of the child's thin register. Her medium tones, even when sung softly,  have a fuller and more resonant quality, and if she lead in songs, etc.,  the pupils, with the proverbial aptitude for imitation, will inevitably  endeavor to imitate her tone-quality. They can only do so by using the  thick register, which it is so desirable to utterly avoid. It is worse  yet for a man to lead the singing. Neither should one of the pupils be  allowed to lead, for not only will the one"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22591"],[0,"A Political History of the State of New York, Volumes 1-3 (#5)"],[1,"ature. The selection of  a governor by ballot interested the people. Although freeholders who  could vote represented only a small part of the male population,  patriots of every class rejoiced in the substitution of a neighbour  for a lord across the sea. And all had a decided choice. Of those  suggested as fittest as well as most experienced Philip Schuyler, John  Morin Scott, John Jay and George Clinton were the favourites. Just  then Schuyler was in the northern part of the province, watching  Burgoyne and making provision to meet the invasion of the Mohawk  Valley; George Clinton, in command on the Hudson, was equally watchful  of the movements of Sir Henry Clinton, whose junction with Burgoyne  meant the destruction of Forts Clinton and Montgomery at the lower  entrance to the Highlands; while Scott and Jay, as members of the  Council of Safety, were directing the government of the new State.    Schuyler's public career began in the Provincial Assembly of New York  in 1768. He represented the people's interests with great boldness,  and when the Assembly refused to thank the delegates of the first  Continental Congress, or to appoint others to a second Congress, he  aided in the organisation of the Provincial Congress which usurped the  Assembly's functions and put all power into the hands of the people.  Chancellor Kent thought that \"in acuteness of intellect, profound  thought, indefatigable activity, exhaustless energy, pure patriotism,  and persevering and intrepid public efforts, Schuyler had no  superior;\" and Daniel Webster declared him \"second only to Washington  in the services he rendered the country.\"[14] But there was in  Schuyler's make-up a touch of arrogance that displayed itself in  letters as well as in manners. The soldierly qualities that made him a  commander did not qualify him for public place dependent upon the  suffrage of men. People respected but did not love him. If they were  indignant that Gates succeeded him, they did not want him to govern  them, however much it may have been in his heart to serve them  faithfully.    [Footnote 14: While in command of the northern department, embracing  the province of New York, Schuyler was known as \"Great Eye,\" so  watchful did he become of the enemy's movements; and although  subsequently, through slander and intrigue, superseded by Horatio  Gates, history has credited Burgoyne's surrender largely to his wisdom  and patriotism, and has branded Gates with incompetency, in spite of  the latter's gold medal and the thanks of Congress.]    John Morin Scott represented the radical element among the patriots.  By profession he was an able and wealthy lawyer; by occupation a  patriotic agitator. John Adams, who breakfasted with him, speaks of  his country residence three miles out of town as \"an elegant seat,  with the Hudson just behind the house, and a rural prospect all around  him.\" But the table seems to have made a deeper impression upon the  Yankee patriot than the picturesque scenery of the river. \"A more  elegant breakfast I never saw--rich plate, a very large silver  coffee-pot, a very large silver teapot, napkins of the very finest  materials, toast and bread and butter in great perfection. Afterwards  a plate of beautiful peaches, another of pears, another of plums, and  a musk melon.\" As a parting salute, this lover of good things spoke of  his host as \"a sensible man, one of the readiest speakers upon the  continent, but not very polite.\"[15] This is what the Tories thought.  According to Jones, the Tory historian, Scott had the misfortune to  graduate at Yale--\"a college remarkable for its republican principles  and religious intolerance,\" he says, and to belong to a triumvirate  whose purpose was \"to pull down church and state, and to raise their  own government upon the ruins.\"[16]    [Footnote 15: John Adams, _Life and Works_, Vol. 2, p. 349 (Diary).]    [Footnote 16: Thomas Jones, _History of New York_, Vol. 1, p. 3.]    Scott, no doubt, was sometimes mistaken in the proper course to  pursue, but he was always right from his point of view, and his point  of view was bitter hostility to English misrule. Whatever he did he  did with all the resistless energy of a man still in his forties. He  was of distinguished ancestry. His great-great-grandfather, Sir John  Scott, baronet, of Ancrum, Scotland, had been a stalwart Whig before  the revolution of 1688, and his grandfather, John Scott, coming to New  York in 1702, had commanded Fort Hunter, a stronghold on the Mohawk.  Both were remarkable men. Tory blood was foreign to their veins. Young  John, breathing the air of independence, scorned to let his life and  property depend upon the pleasure of British lords and a British  ministry, or to be excluded from the right of trial by a jury of his  neighbours, or of taxation by his own representatives. In 1775 he went  to the Continental Congress; in 1776, to the Provincial Congress of  New York; and later he participated in the battle of Long Island as a  brigadier-general. After the adoption of the State Constitution he  became secretary of state, and from 1780 to 1783 served in the  Continental Congress. He lived long enough to see his country free,  although his strenuous life ended at fifty-four.    George Clinton possessed more popular manners than either Schuyler or  Scott. Indeed, it has been given to few men in New York to inspire  more passionate personal attachment than George Clinton. A patriot  never lived who was more bitter in his hostility to English misrule,  or more uncompromising in his opposition to toryism. He was a typical  Irishman--intolerant, often domineering, sometimes petulant, and  occasionally too quick to take offence, but he was magnetic and  generous, easily putting himself in touch with those about him, and  ready, without hesitation, to help the poorest and carry the weakest.  This was the kind of man the people wanted for governor.    Clinton came of a good family. His great-grandfather, a too devoted  adherent of Charles I., found it healthful to wander about Europe, and  finally to settle in the north of Ireland, out of reach of Cromwell's  soldiers, and out of sight of his ancestral patrimony. By the time  Charles II. came to the throne, the estate was lost, and this friend  of the Stuarts lived on in the quiet of his secluded home, and after  him, his son; but the grandson, stirred by the blood of a Puritan  mother, exchanged the North Sea shore for the banks of the Hudson,  where his son breathed the air that made him a leading spirit in the  war for American independence. Clinton's youth is one record of  precocity. Before the war began he passed through a long, a varied,  even a brilliant career, climbing to the highest position in the State  before he had reached the age when most men begin to fill responsible  places. At fifteen he manned an American privateer; at sixteen, as a  lieutenant, he accompanied his father in a successful assault upon  Fort Frontenac; at twenty-six, in the colonial legislature, he became  the rival of Philip Schuyler in the leadership and influence that  enabled a patriotic minority to resist the aggressions of Great  Britain; at thirty-six, holding a seat in the Second Continental  Congress, he voted for the Declaration of Independence, and commanded  a brigade of Ulster County militia.    The election which occurred in June was not preceded by a campaign of  speaking. People were too busy fighting to supplement a campaign of  bullets with one of words. But Jay sent out an electioneering letter  recommending Philip Schuyler for governor and George Clinton for  lieutenant-governor. This was sufficient to secure for these  candidates the conservative vote. It showed, too, Jay's unconcern for  high place. He was modest even to diffidence, an infirmity that seems  to have depressed him at times as much as it did Nathaniel Hawthorne  in a later day.    The returns were made to the Council of Safety, and Jay carefully  scanned them as they came in. On June 20 he wrote Schuyler: \"The  elections in the middle district have taken such a turn as that, if a  tolerable degree of unanimity should prevail in the upper counties,  there will be little doubt of having, ere long, the honour of  addressing a letter to your excellency. Clinton, being pushed for both  offices, may have neither; he has many votes for the first and not a  few for the second. Scott, however, has carried a number from him, and  you are by no means without a share. You may rely on receiving by  express the earliest notice of the event alluded to.\"[17] When the  voters from Orange and other southern counties came in, however, Jay  discovered that the result did not follow the line either of his  wishes or of his suggestions. On the contrary, Clinton was elected to  both offices by a considerable plurality.[18]    [Footnote 17: John Jay, _Correspondence and Public Papers_, Vol. 1, p.  142.]    [Footnote 18: \"A fragment of the canvass of 1777 shows the returns  from Albany, Cumberland, Dutchess, Tryon, and Westchester, as follows:  Clinton, 865; Scott, 386; Schuyler, 1012; Jay, 367; Philip Livingston,  5; Robert R. Livingston, 7. The votes from Orange and other southern  counties gave the election to Clinton.\"--_Civil List, State of New  York_ (1886), p. 164. Subsequently, when the Legislature met at  Kingston on September 1, Pierre Van Cortlandt as president of the  Senate performed the duties of lieutenant-governor.]    The result of the election proved a great surprise and something of a  humiliation to the ruling classes. \"Gen. Clinton, I am informed, has a  majority of votes for the Chair,\" Schuyler wrote to Jay, on June 30.  \"If so he has played his cards better than was expected.\"[19] A few  days later, after confirmation of the rumour, he betrayed considerable  feeling. \"Clinton's family and connections do not entitle him to so  distinguished a pre-eminence,\" he wrote, showing that Revolutionary"]]]
