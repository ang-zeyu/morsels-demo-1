On the other hand, if the heat  generated is not sufficient to maintain the kindling temperature,  combustion ceases.    ~Oxides.~ The compounds formed by the oxidation of any element are called  _oxides_. Thus in the combustion of sulphur, phosphorus, and iron, the  compounds formed are called respectively oxide of sulphur, oxide of  phosphorus, and oxide of iron. In general, then, _an oxide is a compound  of oxygen with another element_. A great many substances of this class  are known; in fact, the oxides of all the common elements have been  prepared, with the exception of those of fluorine and bromine. Some of  these are familiar compounds. Water, for example, is an oxide of  hydrogen, and lime an oxide of the metal calcium.    ~Products of combustion.~ The particular oxides formed by the combustion  of any substance are called _products of combustion_ of that substance.  Thus oxide of sulphur is the product of the combustion of sulphur; oxide  of iron is the product of the combustion of iron. It is evident that the  products of the combustion of any substance must weigh more than the  original substance, the increase in weight corresponding to the amount  of oxygen taken up in the act of combustion. For example, when iron  burns the oxide of iron formed weighs more than the original iron.    In some cases the products of combustion are invisible gases, so that  the substance undergoing combustion is apparently destroyed. Thus, when  a candle burns it is consumed, and so far as the eye can judge nothing  is formed during combustion. That invisible gases are formed, however,  and that the weight of these is greater than the weight of the candle  may be shown by the following experiment.    [Illustration: Fig. 7]         A lamp chimney is filled with sticks of the compound known as       sodium hydroxide (caustic soda), and suspended from the beam of       the balance, as shown in Fig. 7. A piece of candle is placed on       the balance pan so that the wick comes just below the chimney,       and the balance is brought to a level by adding weights to the       other pan. The candle is then lighted. The products formed pass       up through the chimney and are absorbed by the sodium       hydroxide. Although the candle burns away, the pan upon which       it rests slowly sinks, showing that the combustion is attended       by an increase in weight.         ~Combustion in air and in oxygen.~ Combustion in air and in       oxygen differs only in rapidity, the products formed being       exactly the same. That the process should take place less       rapidly in the former is readily understood, for the air is       only about one fifth oxygen, the remaining four fifths being       inert gases. Not only is less oxygen available, but much of the       heat is absorbed in raising the temperature of the inert gases       surrounding the substance undergoing combustion, and the       temperature reached in the combustion is therefore less.         ~Phlogiston theory of combustion.~ The French chemist Lavoisier       (1743-1794), who gave to oxygen its name was the first to show       that combustion is due to union with oxygen. Previous to his       time combustion was supposed to be due to the presence of a       substance or principle called _phlogiston_. One substance was       thought to be more combustible than another because it       contained more phlogiston. Coal, for example, was thought to be       very rich in phlogiston. The ashes left after combustion would       not burn because all the phlogiston had escaped. If the       phlogiston could be restored in any way, the substance would       then become combustible again. Although this view seems absurd       to us in the light of our present knowledge, it formerly had       general acceptance. The discovery of oxygen led Lavoisier to       investigate the subject, and through his experiments he arrived       at the true explanation of combustion. The discovery of oxygen       together with the part it plays in combustion is generally       regarded as the most important discovery in the history of       chemistry. It marked the dawn of a new period in the growth of       the science.    ~Combustion in the broad sense.~ According to the definition given above,  the presence of oxygen is necessary for combustion. The term is  sometimes used, however, in a broader sense to designate any chemical  change attended by the evolution of heat and light. Thus iron and  sulphur, or hydrogen and chlorine under certain conditions, will combine  so rapidly that light is evolved, and the action is called a combustion.  Whenever combustion takes place in the air, however, the process is one  of oxidation.         ~Spontaneous combustion.~ The temperature reached in a given       chemical action, such as oxidation, depends upon the rate at       which the reaction takes place. This rate is usually increased       by raising the temperature of the substances taking part in the       action.         When a slow oxidation takes place under such conditions that       the heat generated is not lost by being conducted away, the       temperature of the substance undergoing oxidation is raised,       and this in turn hastens the rate of oxidation. The rise in       temperature may continue in this way until the kindling       temperature of the substance is reached, when combustion       begins. Combustion occurring in this way is called _spontaneous       combustion_.         Certain oils, such as the linseed oil used in paints, slowly       undergo oxidation at ordinary temperatures, and not       infrequently the origin of fires has been traced to the       spontaneous combustion of oily rags. The spontaneous combustion       of hay has been known to set barns on fire. Heaps of coal have       been found to be on fire when spontaneous combustion offered       the only possible explanation.    ~Importance of oxygen.~ 1. Oxygen is essential to life. Among living  organisms only certain minute forms of plant life can exist without it.  In the process of respiration the air is taken into the lungs where a  certain amount of oxygen is absorbed by the blood. It is then carried to  all parts of the body, oxidizing the worn-out tissues and changing them  into substances which may readily be eliminated from the body. The heat  generated by this oxidation is the source of the heat of the body. The  small amount of oxygen which water dissolves from the air supports all  the varied forms of aquatic animals.    2. Oxygen is also essential to decay. The process of decay is really a  kind of oxidation, but it will only take place in the presence of  certain minute forms of life known as bacteria. Just how these assist in  the oxidation is not known. By this process the dead products of animal  and vegetable life which collect on the surface of the earth are slowly  oxidized and so converted into harmless substances. In this way oxygen  acts as a great purifying agent.    3. Oxygen is also used in the treatment of certain diseases in which the  patient is unable to inhale sufficient air to supply the necessary  amount of oxygen.      OZONE    ~Preparation.~ When electric sparks are passed through oxygen or air a  small percentage of the oxygen is converted into a substance called  _ozone_, which differs greatly from oxygen in its properties. The same  change can also be brought about by certain chemical processes. Thus, if  some pieces of phosphorus are placed in a bottle and partially covered  with water, the presence of ozone may soon be detected in the air  contained in the bottle. The conversion of oxygen into ozone is attended  by a change in volume, 3 volumes of oxygen forming 2 volumes of ozone.  If the resulting ozone is heated to about 300 deg., the reverse change  takes place, the 2 volumes of ozone being changed back into 3 volumes of  oxygen. It is possible that traces of ozone exist in the atmosphere,  although its presence there has not been definitely proved, the tests  formerly used for its detection having been shown to be unreliable.    ~Properties.~ As commonly prepared, ozone is mixed with a large excess of  oxygen. It is possible, however, to separate the ozone and thus obtain  it in pure form. The gas so obtained has the characteristic odor noticed  about electrical machines when in operation. By subjecting it to great  pressure and a low temperature, the gas condenses to a bluish liquid,  boiling at -119 deg.. When unmixed with other gases ozone is very explosive,  changing back into oxygen with the liberation of heat. Its chemical  properties are similar to those of oxygen except that it is far more  active. Air or oxygen containing a small amount of ozone is now used in  place of oxygen in certain manufacturing processes.    ~The difference between oxygen and ozone.~ Experiments show that in  changing oxygen into ozone no other kind of matter is either added to  the oxygen or withdrawn from it. The question arises then, How can we  account for the difference in their properties? It must be remembered  that in all changes we have to take into account _energy_ as well as  _matter_. By changing the amount of energy in a substance we change its  properties. That oxygen and ozone contain different amounts of energy  may be shown in a number of ways; for example, by the fact that the  conversion of ozone into oxygen is attended by the liberation of heat.  The passage of the electric sparks through oxygen has in some way  changed the energy content of the element and thus it has acquired new  properties. _Oxygen and ozone must, therefore, be regarded as identical  so far as the kind of matter of which they are composed is concerned.  Their different properties are due to their different energy contents._    ~Allotropic states or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20851"],[0,"Character Sketches of Romance, Fiction and the Drama, Vol. 3 (#5)"],[1,"who will not credit her guilt until, conscience-smitten, she  throws herself at his feet and acknowledges all.    _Lucius Mason._ The priggish, good-looking youth for whom Lady Mason  risks so much.
