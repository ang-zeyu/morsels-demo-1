But  I've just had the bad luck to come out of the sky, skip the solid earth,  and land lower down than I intended. But never mind. It isn't everybody  who gets a chance to see your Land of the Gabazoos.\"    \"Mangaboos,\" said the Sorcerer, correcting him. \"If you are a Wizard you  ought to be able to call people by their right names.\"    \"Oh, I'm a Wizard; you may be sure of that. Just as good a Wizard as you  are a Sorcerer.\"    \"That remains to be seen,\" said the other.    \"If you are able to prove that you are better,\" said the Prince to the  little man, \"I will make you the Chief Wizard of this domain.  Otherwise--\"    \"What will happen otherwise?\" asked the Wizard.    \"I will stop you from living, and forbid you to be planted,\" returned  the Prince.    \"That does not sound especially pleasant,\" said the little man, looking  at the one with the star uneasily. \"But never mind. I'll beat Old  Prickly, all right.\"    \"My name is Gwig,\" said the Sorcerer, turning his heartless, cruel eyes  upon his rival. \"Let me see you equal the sorcery I am about to  perform.\"    He waved a thorny hand and at once the tinkling of bells was heard,  playing sweet music. Yet, look where she would, Dorothy could discover  no bells at all in the great glass hall.    The Mangaboo people listened, but showed no great interest. It was one  of the things Gwig usually did to prove he was a sorcerer.    Now was the Wizard's turn, so he smiled upon the assemblage and asked:    \"Will somebody kindly loan me a hat?\"    No one did, because the Mangaboos did not wear hats, and Zeb had lost  his, somehow, in his flight through the air.    \"Ahem!\" said the Wizard, \"will somebody please loan me a handkerchief?\"    But they had no handkerchiefs, either.    \"Very good,\" remarked the Wizard. \"I'll use my own hat, if you please.  Now, good people, observe me carefully. You see, there is nothing up my  sleeve and nothing concealed about my person. Also, my hat is quite  empty.\" He took off his hat and held it upside down, shaking it  briskly.    \"Let me see it,\" said the Sorcerer.    He took the hat and examined it carefully, returning it afterward to the  Wizard.    \"Now,\" said the little man, \"I will create something out of nothing.\"    He placed the hat upon the glass floor, made a pass with his hand, and  then removed the hat, displaying a little white piglet no bigger than a  mouse, which began to run around here and there and to grunt and squeal  in a tiny, shrill voice.    The people watched it intently, for they had never seen a pig before,  big or little. The Wizard reached out, caught the wee creature in his  hand, and holding its head between one thumb and finger and its tail  between the other thumb and finger he pulled it apart, each of the two  parts becoming a whole and separate piglet in an instant.    He placed one upon the floor, so that it could run around, and pulled  apart the other, making three piglets in all; and then one of these was  pulled apart, making four piglets. The Wizard continued this surprising  performance until nine tiny piglets were running about at his feet, all  squealing and grunting in a very comical way.    \"Now,\" said the Wizard of Oz, \"having created something from nothing, I  will make something nothing again.\"    With this he caught up two of the piglets and pushed them together, so  that the two were one. Then he caught up another piglet and pushed it  into the first, where it disappeared. And so, one by one, the nine tiny  piglets were pushed together until but a single one of the creatures  remained. This the Wizard placed underneath his hat and made a mystic  sign above it. When he removed his hat the last piglet had disappeared  entirely.    The little man gave a bow to the silent throng that had watched him, and  then the Prince said, in his cold, calm voice:    \"You are indeed a wonderful Wizard, and your powers are greater than  those of my Sorcerer.\"    \"He will not be a wonderful Wizard long,\" remarked Gwig.    \"Why not?\" enquired the Wizard.    \"Because I am going to stop your breath,\" was the reply. \"I perceive  that you are curiously constructed, and that if you cannot breathe you  cannot keep alive.\"    The little man looked troubled.    \"How long will it take you to stop my breath?\" he asked.    \"About five minutes. I'm going to begin now. Watch me carefully.\"    He began making queer signs and passes toward the Wizard; but the little  man did not watch him long. Instead, he drew a leathern case from his  pocket and took from it several sharp knives, which he joined together,  one after another, until they made a long sword. By the time he had  attached a handle to this sword he was having much trouble to breathe,  as the charm of the Sorcerer was beginning to take effect.    So the Wizard lost no more time, but leaping forward he raised the sharp  sword, whirled it once or twice around his head, and then gave a mighty  stroke that cut the body of the Sorcerer exactly in two.    Dorothy screamed and expected to see a terrible sight; but as the two  halves of the Sorcerer fell apart on the floor she saw that he had no  bones or blood inside of him at all, and that the place where he was cut  looked much like a sliced turnip or potato.    \"Why, he's vegetable!\" cried the Wizard, astonished.    \"Of course,\" said the Prince. \"We are all vegetable, in this country.  Are you not vegetable, also?\"    \"No,\" answered the Wizard. \"People on top of the earth are all meat.  Will your Sorcerer die?\"    \"Certainly, sir. He is really dead now, and will wither very quickly. So  we must plant him at once, that other Sorcerers may grow upon his bush,\"  continued the Prince.    \"What do you mean by that?\" asked the little Wizard, greatly puzzled.    \"If you will accompany me to our public gardens,\" replied the Prince, \"I  will explain to you much better than I can here the mysteries of our  Vegetable Kingdom.\"    [Illustration: THE WIZARD CUT THE SORCERER EXACTLY IN TWO.]          CHAPTER 4.    THE VEGETABLE KINGDOM      After the Wizard had wiped the dampness from his sword and taken it  apart and put the pieces into their leathern case again, the man with  the star ordered some of his people to carry the two halves of the  Sorcerer to the public gardens.    Jim pricked up his ears when he heard they were going to the gardens,  and wanted to join the party, thinking he might find something proper to  eat; so Zeb put down the top of the buggy and invited the Wizard to ride  with them. The seat was amply wide enough for the little man and the two  children, and when Jim started to leave the hall the kitten jumped upon  his back and sat there quite contentedly.    So the procession moved through the streets, the bearers of the Sorcerer  first, the Prince next, then Jim drawing the buggy with the strangers  inside of it, and last the crowd of vegetable people who had no hearts  and could neither smile nor frown.    The glass city had several fine streets, for a good many people lived  there; but when the procession had passed through these it came upon a  broad plain covered with gardens and watered by many pretty brooks that  flowed through it. There were paths through these gardens, and over some  of the brooks were ornamental glass bridges.    Dorothy and Zeb now got out of the buggy and walked beside the Prince,  so that they might see and examine the flowers and plants better.    \"Who built these lovely bridges?\" asked the little girl.    \"No one built them,\" answered the man with the star. \"They grow.\"    \"That's queer,\" said she. \"Did the glass houses in your city grow, too?\"    \"Of course,\" he replied. \"But it took a good many years for them to grow  as large and fine as they are now. That is why we are so angry when a  Rain of Stones comes to break our towers and crack our roofs.\"    \"Can't you mend them?\" she enquired.    \"No; but they will grow together again, in time, and we must wait until  they do.\"    They first passed through many beautiful gardens of flowers, which grew  nearest the city; but Dorothy could hardly tell what kind of flowers  they were, because the colors were constantly changing under the  shifting lights of the six suns. A flower would be pink one second,  white the next, then blue or yellow; and it was the same way when they  came to the plants, which had broad leaves and grew close to the ground.    When they passed over a field of grass Jim immediately stretched down  his head and began to nibble.    \"A nice country this is,\" he grumbled, \"where a respectable horse has to  eat pink grass!\"    \"It's violet,\" said the Wizard, who was in the buggy.    \"Now it's blue,\" complained the horse. \"As a matter of fact, I'm eating  rainbow grass.\"    \"How does it taste?\" asked the Wizard.    \"Not bad at all,\" said Jim. \"If they give me plenty of it I'll not  complain about its color.\"    By this time the party had reached a freshly plowed field, and the  Prince said to Dorothy:    \"This is our planting-ground.\"    Several Mangaboos came forward with glass spades and dug a hole in the  ground. Then they put the two halves of the Sorcerer into it and covered  him up. After that other people brought water from a brook and sprinkled  the earth.    \"He will sprout very soon,\" said the Prince, \"and grow into a large  bush, from which we shall in time be able to pick several very good  sorcerers.\"    \"Do all your people grow on bushes?\" asked the boy.    \"Certainly,\" was the reply. \"Do not all people grow upon bushes where  you came from, on the outside of the earth.\"    \"Not that I ever heard of.\"    \"How strange! But if you will come with me to one of our folk gardens I  will show you the way we grow in the Land of the Mangaboos.\"    It appeared that these odd people, while they were able to walk through  the air with ease, usually moved upon the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22567"],[0,"History of the United States, Volume 2 (#5)"],[1,"diers, surrounded by gunsmoke, firing at the crowd.]  The Boston Massacre.  From an Engraving by Paul Revere.      [1773]    But George III. could not rest without asserting his supremacy over  America. He made an arrangement with the East India Company by which tea  could be bought in America, spite of the hated tax, cheaper than in  England. Then, at the king's instigation, large shipments of tea were  made to America. The colonists saw through the cunning attempt, and the  tide of resistance rose higher than ever. At New York and Philadelphia  the tea-ships were forced to put to sea again without unlading. At  Charleston the tea was stored in damp cellars and soon spoiled. At  Boston there was a deadlock; the people would not let the tea be landed;  the governor would not let the ships sail without unlading. On the  evening of December 16, 1773, the tax falling due on the next day, a  party of fifty citizens, disguised as Indians, boarded the ships, and  threw three hundred and forty-two chests of tea into the harbor.    [1774]    The Boston tea-party aroused all the blind obstinacy of George III.  \"Blows must decide,\" he exclaimed; \"the guilty rebels are to be forced  to submission,\" The king's anger led to the Boston Port Bill, which was  passed the next year, and closed Boston harbor to all commerce. Changes  were also made in the government of Massachusetts, rendering it almost  entirely independent of the people. Town meetings were forbidden except  for elections. Poor Massachusetts, her liberties curtailed, her commerce  ruined, appealed to her sister colonies for support, and they responded  right heartily. In three weeks from the news of the Port Bill all the  colonies had made the cause of Massachusetts their own. Expressions of  sympathy and liberal gifts of money and provisions poured into Boston  from all over the country. The first Continental Congress assembled at  Philadelphia in September. All the colonies but Georgia were  represented. An earnest statement of grievances was drawn up, with a  prayer to the king for redress. The action of Massachusetts was  approved, and an agreement entered into to suspend all commerce with  England.    Things now hastened rapidly toward open war. British troops were  stationed in Boston, and began fortification. Military preparations were  making everywhere among the colonists. The train was laid. Only a spark  was needed to bring the dreaded explosion.        CHAPTER III.    INDEPENDENCE AND THE NEW STATES    [1775]    The thought of independence in the minds of the colonists was of  surprisingly slow growth. The feeling of dependence on the  mother-country and of loyalty to the king was deep-rooted and died hard.  Even union, which was a pre-requisite to a successful struggle for  independence, came slowly. The old New England Confederation, in 1643-  84, between Massachusetts Bay, Plymouth, Connecticut, and New Haven, for  defence against Indians, Dutch, and French, ended without ever having  manifested the slightest vigor. In the latter half of the seventeenth  century Virginia had alliances with some sister colonies for protection  against Indians; but there was no call for a general congress until the  French and Indian attack on Schenectady, in 1690, during King William's  War. Representatives from New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and  Plymouth met that year at New York; letters came from Virginia,  Maryland, and Rhode Island. But no permanent union was proposed here,  nor at any of the similar meetings, seven at least, which occurred  between 1690 and 1750.    The Albany Convention, which met in 1754 to prepare for the French and  Indian War, adopted a plan for union presented by Franklin, providing  for a president-general appointed and supported by the Crown, and for a  grand council of delegates elected triennially by the colonies according  to population, and empowered, within limits, to lay taxes and make laws  for the common interest of English America. Franklin believed that the  adoption of this scheme would have postponed the Revolution a century.  But, as it gave so much power to the king, it was rejected by the people  in every colony.    Even after English oppression and the diligent agency of committees of  correspondence had brought union, and delegates from the colonies had  met again and again in Congress, the thought of breaking away from the  mother-land was strange to the minds of nearly all. The instructions to  the delegates to the first Congress, in September, 1774, gave no  suggestion of independence.  On the contrary, colony after colony urged  its representatives to seek the restoration of \"harmony and union\" with  England. This Congress branded as \"calumny\" the charge that it wished  \"independency.\" Washington wrote, from the Congress, that independence  was then not \"desired by any thinking man in America.\"      [Illustration: Flag, a pine tree below \"AN APPEAL TO HEAVEN\".]  Pine Tree Flag of Massachusetts.      [Illustration: Flag, a rattlesnake above \"DON'T TREAD ON ME\".]  Rattlesnake Flag of South Carolina.      The feeling was much the same in 1775. Pennsylvania \"strictly\" commanded  her representatives to dissent from any \"proposition that may lead to  separation.\" Maryland gave similar instructions in January, 1776.  Independence was neither the avowed nor the conscious object in  defending Bunker Hill, June 17, 1775. Washington's commission as  commander-in-chief, two days later, gave no hint of it. And the New  Hampshire legislature so late as December 25, 1775, in the very act of  framing a new state government, \"totally disavowed\" all such aim. In the  fall of 1775 Congress declared that it had \"not raised armies with the  ambitious design of separation from Great Britain.\"    The swift change which, a little more than six months later, made the  Declaration of Independence possible and even popular, has never yet  been fully explained. In May, 1775, John Adams had been cautioned by the  Philadelphia Sons of Liberty not to utter the word independence. \"It is  as unpopular,\" they said, in \"Pennsylvania and all the Middle and  Southern States as the Stamp Act itself.\"  Early in 1776 this same great  man wrote that there was hardly a newspaper in America but openly  advocated independence. In the spring of 1776 the conservative  Washington declared, \"Reconciliation is impracticable. Nothing but  independence will save us.\" Statesmen began to see that longer delay was  dangerous, that permanent union turned upon independence, and that,  without a government of their own, people would by and by demand back  their old constitution, as the English did after Cromwell's death. \"The  country is not only ripe for independence,\" said Witherspoon, of New  Jersey, debating in Congress, \"but is in danger of becoming rotten for  lack of it.\"    Colony after colony now came rapidly into line. Massachusetts gave  instructions to her delegates in Congress, virtually favoring  independence, in January, 1776. Georgia did the same in February, South  Carolina in March. Express authority to \"concur in independency\" came  first from North Carolina, April 12th, and the following May 31st  Mecklenburg County in that State explicitly declared its independence of  England. On May 1st Massachusetts began to disuse the king's name in  public instruments. May 4th, Rhode Island renounced allegiance almost in  terms. On May 15th brave old Virginia ordered her delegates in Congress  to bite right into the sour apple and propose independence. Connecticut,  New Hampshire, Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania took action in the  same direction during the following month.    [1776]    [Illustration: Flag; thirteen stripes, with the English cross and  diagonal cross in the upper left corner.]  Union Flag. The first recognized Continental Standard, raised for the  first time January 2,1776.    The king's brutal attitude had much to do with this sudden change. The  colonists had nursed the belief that the king was misled by his  ministers. A last petition, couched in respectful terms, was drawn up by  Congress in the summer of 1775, and sent to England. Out of respect to  the feelings of good John Dickinson, of Pennsylvania, who still clung to  England, this address was tempered with a submissiveness which offended  many members. On its being read, Dickinson remarked that but one word in  it displeased him, the word \"Congress;\" to which Colonel Ben Harrison,  of Virginia, retorted that but one word in it pleased him, and that  \"Congress\" was precisely the word.    The appeal was idle. The king's only answer was a violent proclamation  denouncing the Americans as rebels. It was learned at the same time that  he was preparing to place Indians, negroes, and German mercenaries in  arms against them. The truth was forced upon the most reluctant, that  the root of England's obduracy was in the king personally, and that  further supplications were useless. The surprising success of the  colonial arms, the shedding of blood at Lexington, Concord, and Bunker  Hill--all which, remember, antedated the Declaration--the increase and  the ravages of the royal army and navy in America, were all efficient in  urging the colonists to break utterly and forever from the  mother-country.    [1772]    The behavior of the Gaspe officers in Narragansett Bay, their illegal  seizures, plundering expeditions on shore, and wanton manners in  stopping and searching boats, illustrate the spirit of the king's  hirelings in America at this time. At last the Rhode Islanders could  endure it no longer. Early on the morning of June 9, 1772, Captain  Abraham Whipple, with a few boatloads of trusty aides, dropped down the  river from Providence to what is now called Gaspe Point, six or seven  miles below the city, where the offending craft had run aground the  previous evening in giving chase to the Newport-Providence packet-boat,  and after a spirited fight mastered the Gaspe's"]]]
