During the course of his angry outburst he disclosed the fact  that he had proceeded to the mine for the purpose of destroying it,  and had discovered the presence of the gold. It may be mentioned here  that Dr. Krause, in the course of the morning, had been in telegraphic  communication with General Botha, who was then in the vicinity of  Eagles' Nest, and had informed him that it would probably be necessary  to take violent measures against Kock, which might lead to bloodshed.  General Botha's reply was: \"I hold you responsible for the safety of  the mines and the town of Johannesburg, and I leave everything in your  hands.\"    When, therefore, \"General\" Kock disclosed his purpose, Dr. Krause  jumped up, closed the door, confronted him, and, before he could  realise his position, had him under arrest, calling upon van Diggelen  to disarm him. Kock made an attempt to escape, but he was powerless in  the hands of two determined men. Some time elapsed before he realised  the hopelessness of the situation, as his last attempt to induce  Commandant van Diggelen to deliver a note to his men outside was met  with a blank refusal. The next thing to be done was to get rid of  these men, who evidently had been instructed by their \"General\" not to  leave without him, he probably fearing that something unforeseen might  happen to him. How now to get rid of these men? The following ruse was  adopted: Dr. Krause took up some telegrams, and, waving these in the  air, rushed out to where they were stationed, demanding to know who  the officer in charge was. He was met by a confusion of voices calling  out, \"Where is our General?\" \"Oh!\" was the reply, \"your General is  still in my office, consulting on military matters, and I have just  received information that the British are advancing on the town from  the direction of the Gueldenhuis. Your General commands you to proceed  in that direction to reinforce the Boers, who are trying to stop the  advance. We will follow immediately with the rest of the men. Now! who  is in command?\" \"I am, sir--Captain McCullum.\" \"Now, Captain,\" the  Doctor said, \"ride for your life and do your duty.\"    The ruse was successful, and in a few minutes not a single man of the  band was in sight. The next question was, what was to be done with  Kock. The following plan was adopted: The arrest took place shortly  before the luncheon hour, and as the offices were generally closed  from one till two, Kock was detained in the Commandant's office until  one. All officials were then ordered to leave. Van Diggelen ordered  his dog-cart to be brought round, Kock was told to step in, and was  quietly driven to the fort, where he was detained by the officer in  charge.    During the afternoon General Botha and his staff passed through  Johannesburg, and came to see Dr. Krause, who reported what had  happened. General Botha approved of and confirmed his action in every  respect. The conference between the two officers did not last long,  and resulted in Dr. Krause being definitely instructed to remain in  Johannesburg in order to protect the town and its inhabitants, and to  see that all fighting burghers immediately left for their respective  commandos. The same evening Kock was sent to Pretoria, escorted by  several police, and handed over to the authorities there.    The great danger which had threatened the safety of the mines was in  this way averted.    Before closing this chapter, mention should be made of the excellent  work done by the Mines Police in the protection of the mines, and in  this connection especially to name Commandant L.E. van Diggelen and  Lt. W. Vogts, the energetic Secretary of the Force.    The gold found on the Robinson Mine was on the same Tuesday sent by  Dr. Krause to Pretoria in charge of Captain Arendt Burkhardt and  several members of the Field Police, and was duly delivered by them to  the authorities there.           *       *       *       *       *    _Note._--The subsequent career of Kock was an eventful one. He lost  his father, J.H. Kock, at the battle of Elandslaagte. This and other  matters so preyed upon his mind that eventually he became subject to  delusions, and is at present confined in the lunatic asylum at  Pretoria.          CHAPTER III    THE SURRENDER OF THE GOLDEN CITY      In attempting to chronicle the events which surround the surrender of  Johannesburg, the mind involuntarily pauses, and a picture, which  reminds one of the fairy-tales of one's childhood, is called up in  imagination.    In 1886 Johannesburg could only boast of a few tin shanties--the  beginnings of a mining camp; fourteen years later the British troops  marched through the streets of a modern city. And what has been the  history of these fourteen years?    In the history of the older European nations development and progress  are slow, and social and economic cause and effect can be traced with  almost scientific accuracy. In Johannesburg, however, ordinary human  agencies do not seem to have been at work. The man who has the leisure  at his disposal to ascertain the true facts of that period before the  war, would present to the world a history so interesting and  fascinating that he would be accused of having indulged in fiction in  his narrative of events. It would be out of place in this book,  however, to enter into these historical events, and we must confine  ourselves to the details of the period with which this story deals.    Ever since the beginning of the war it was the intention of the  Republican Government to defend both Pretoria and Johannesburg, and  had the outbreak of the war not been precipitated, and the necessary  cannon ordered from France arrived in time, this would have been done.  Even after the fall of Bloemfontein the idea was not entirely  abandoned, and Commandant Krause was instructed to provision the  Johannesburg Fort and make other necessary preparations. A promise was  made that several cannon would be left at Johannesburg by the Boers  during their retreat. It was hoped that such defence would retard the  British advance and enable the Boers to recover from the panic which  had seized them ever since the surrender of Cronje at Paardeberg.    When, however, General Botha on Tuesday, May 29th, 1900, passed  through Johannesburg, Commandant Krause was ordered to abandon the  defence of the town, to distribute all provisions collected amongst  the families of the men on commando, and to get rid of all men capable  of fighting. These orders were promptly carried out.    On the following day, Wednesday, May 30th, between ten and eleven in  the morning, Major Francis Davis appeared with a flag of truce and  requested to see Dr. Krause.    At the time the Commandant was at the fort attending to General  Grobelaar and about 500 men who were retreating in the direction of  Pretoria. During the day bodies of armed burghers were continually  passing through the town.    On arrival at his office Dr. Krause found Major Davis in the company  of two old Johannesburg residents. The latter were dressed in mufti.  Both these men had taken an active part in the agitation which  preceded the war.    Major Davis in soldierly manner addressed Dr. Krause by saying that he  was commanded by Lord Roberts to demand the immediate and  unconditional surrender of the town, in the name of Her Majesty Queen  Victoria.    Dr. Krause's reply was very short: \"No, sir, not immediately and not  unconditionally.\"    Major Davis thereupon said that Lord Roberts had also expressed a  desire that the Commandant should grant him an interview, at which the  matter could be discussed. Dr. Krause assented to this proposition.    What the Boers wanted was delay--and if Commandant Krause could delay  the forward advance of the British troops a great advantage would be  gained.    Lord Roberts was encamped just above the Victoria Lake, close to  Germiston. On arrival at the camp Dr. Krause was met by Lord Roberts  on the verandah of the house occupied by him and his staff.    A private interview then took place between the two officers, at which  the terms of surrender of Johannesburg were agreed upon, and which  will be found in the letter set out hereunder.    The chief reason for an armistice advanced by the Boer Commandant was  that if the British were at once to enter the town, street-fighting  would undoubtedly take place, as the many armed burghers passing  through the town would only obey the orders of their own respective  Commandants and Field-cornets. Such street-fighting would be a serious  menace to the women and children and to the other peaceful citizens of  the town. Lord Roberts agreed to this, adding that he had once, in  Afghanistan, experienced street-fighting and would not like to see it  again.    Another incident of this interview is worth recording, viz. the  protest made by Dr. Krause at the presence of the two civilians who  accompanied Major Davis. Lord Roberts asked for the reason of this  protest, and was informed that, according to the view of the people in  Johannesburg, these men, through the part they played in the  mendacious political agitation which was carried on prior to the war,  were partly responsible for the war, and further that he (Dr. Krause)  had in his possession a warrant for the arrest of one of these men for  high treason, issued prior to the commencement of hostilities, and  consequently their presence in the town was looked upon with a great  deal of disfavour and resentment.    Lord Roberts expressed his regret, and said that these men had  accompanied his officer only because he was told that they would be  excellent guides, knowing the locality and the officials.    The terms of surrender were agreed to, including an armistice of  twenty-four hours. This delay undoubtedly helped to save the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20195"],[0,"Wood-Block Printing (#5)"],[1,"ig. 7) on p. 30.    The flat side of the knife should always be against the line to be cut.    Sometimes it is convenient to drive the knife from right to left, but in  this case the pressure is given by the right hand, and the left middle  finger is used to check and steady the knife, the finger being pressed  against the knife just above the cutting edge.    A good position for cutting a long straight line towards oneself on the  block is shown below (fig. 8). The left hand is on its side, and the  middle finger is hooked round and pulls the knife while the right hand  guides it.    In all cases the middle finger of the left hand pushes or steadies the  knife, or acts as a fulcrum.    [Illustration: FIG. 7.--Position of the hands in using the  knife.]    A beginner with the knife usually applies too much pressure or is apt  to put the left finger at a point too high up on the blade, where it  loses its control. The finger should be as close down to the wood as  possible, where its control is most effective. A small piece of  india-rubber tubing round the knife blade helps to protect the finger.    [Illustration: FIG. 8.--Another position of the hands in using  the knife.]    With practice the knife soon becomes an easy and a very precise tool,  capable of great expressiveness in drawing. Bear in mind that both sides  of a line are drawn by the knife. The special power of developing the  expressive form of line _on both sides_ is a resource tending to great  development of drawing in designs for wood-block prints. The line may be  of varying form, changing from silhouette to pure line as may best serve  to express the design. It should never be a mere diagram.    [Illustration: Plate VI. Reproduction of an impression (reduced) of the  key-block of a Japanese print showing admirable variety in the means  used to suggest form.    (_To face page 33._)]    The actual cutting proceeds as follows: Starting at some point where the  surface of the key-block design has been oiled and made distinct, a  shallow cut is made along one side of any form in the design, with the  knife held slanting so that the cut slants away from the edge of the  form. A second outer parallel cut is then made with the knife held  slanting in the opposite direction from the first, so that the two cuts  together make a V-shaped trench all along the line of the form. The  little strip of wood cut out should detach itself as the second cut is  made, and should not need any picking out or further cutting if the  first two cuts are cleanly made. This shallow V-shaped trench is  continued all round the masses and along both sides of all the lines of  the design. No clearing of the intervening spaces should be attempted  until this is done. It will be seen at once that the V-shaped cuts give  great strength to the printing lines, so that a quite fine line between  two cuts may have a strong, broad base (fig. 9). The depth of the cut  would be slightly shallower than that shown in this diagram. In cutting  fine line work a cut is first made a little beyond the line, then the  cut is made on the line itself (fig. 10).    [Illustration: FIG. 9.--Knife cuts in section.]    [Illustration: FIG. 10.--Diagram of knife cuts.]    Where a very fine line is to be cut, especially if it is on a curve, the  outer cut of the V trench should be made first, and then that which  touches the line: there is thus less disturbance of the wood, and less  danger of injuring the edge of the line.    When the V cut has been made outside all the lines, one proceeds to  clear the intervening spaces between the lines of the design by taking  tool No. 1 (fig. 5). The large spaces should be cleared first. The  safest and quickest way is to make a small gouge cut with No. 1 round  all the large spaces close up to the first cut, then, with one of the  shallower chisels, Nos. 5, 6, or 7 (fig. 5), and the mallet, clear out  the wood between the gouge cuts.    For all shallow cuts where the mallet is not needed, the Japanese hold  the chisels as shown in fig. 11. With practice this will be found a very  convenient and steady grip for the right hand. It has also the advantage  that the chisel can be held against the centre of the body and exactly  under one's eyes.    In the diagram (fig. 12), if the wood from A to A1 is to be cleared  away, gouge cuts are made at _b_ and _b_1, then the space between _b_  and _b_1 may be quickly cleared without risk to the edge of the form at  A. When this rough work is done the little ridge between A and _b_ may  be cleared with small round or flat tools, as is most convenient. But  this final clearing should not be done until all the large spaces are  roughed out.    [Illustration: FIG. 11.--Method of holding gouge.]    [Illustration: FIG. 12.--Clearing of wood between knife cuts.]    The depth to which the spaces must be cleared will depend on their  width, as, in printing, the paper will sag more deeply in a wide space  than in a narrow one. In spaces of half an inch the depth of the first  V-cuts is sufficient, but the proportionate depth is about that of the  diagram above. The small spaces are cleared by means of small flat or  round chisels without the mallet or the preliminary gouge cut: this is  only needed where a large space has to be cleared.    There remain now only the placing and cutting of the two register marks  or notches for controlling the position of the paper in printing.    These are placed relatively to the design as shown in fig. 13.    The corner of the print fits into the notch at A, and one edge of the  print lies against the straight notch at B.    The register marks may be even closer to the space covered by the  design, but must not actually touch it, as some margin of paper is  necessary in printing: they should also be cut always on the long side  of the printing block. It will be seen from the drawing on page 70 that  these register marks correspond to the position of the thumb of each  hand in laying the paper on the block for printing.    [Illustration: FIG. 13.--Position of register marks.]    [Illustration: FIG. 14.--Register marks.]    The corner mark, ABC, is made by cutting from A to B and B to C, with  the knife held perpendicularly, and its flat side against the line, then  the shaded portion is cut with a flat chisel, sloping from the surface  of the block at AC to a depth of about 1/16 inch along AB and BC. The  straight notch, EF, is similarly cut, first with a perpendicular knife  along EF, and then the shaded portion is chiselled sloping down to the  line EF.    [Illustration: FIG. 15.--Register marks (section of).]    In section the two register marks would be as above.    The register marks must be smoothly and evenly cut so that the paper, in  printing, may slide easily home to its exact place.    When the design of the key-block and the two register marks have been  cut and cleared, the trace of paper and paste on the uncut parts of the  wood should be carefully washed off with a piece of sponge and warm  water. The block is then finished and ready for use. The key-block,  however, is only one of the set of blocks required for a print in  colour, but the colour blocks are simpler and require, as a rule, far  less labour.    The colour blocks are planned and established by means of impressions  taken from the key-block. For this purpose the register marks are  inked[2] for printing as well as the design on the block, and the  impressions must include both. These impressions are taken on thin  Japanese paper, but not necessarily the thinnest tissue. If the thinnest  is used, it should be pasted at the corners to a sheet of stiffer paper  for convenience in handling.    [2] The preparation of the ink for printing is described on p. 54.    It is then a fairly simple matter to take one of these key-block  impressions and to make a plan of the various colour-blocks that will be  required. These should obviously be as few as possible.    It is not necessary to provide an entire block for each patch of  colour, but only the extent of surface required for each coloured  portion of the print, as well as for its pair of register marks. Patches  of different colour that are not adjacent to one another on the design  of the print may be cut on the same block, provided they are not too  close for free colouring of the block in printing. Each block also may  be cut on both sides, so that there is considerable scope for economy in  the arranging and planning of the colour blocks.    When the arrangement of the plan of colour has been simplified as far as  possible, a new block is prepared as described above, and a sheet of  thin Japanese paper (unsized) is cut large enough to cover the print  design and its register marks. The clean surface of the new block is  covered thinly with starch paste well rubbed into the grain, and while  this is still wet an impression on the sheet of thin Japanese paper is  taken of the entire key-block, including its register marks in black,  and laid before it is dry face downward on the pasted surface of the  new block. This should be done as already described on page 25. It  should be rubbed flat with the printing pad and left to dry.    This operation requires careful handling, but it should be done easily  and methodically, without any hurry.    Each side of the set of colour planks should be treated in the same  way--a thin impression of the key-block and its register marks being  laid upon each. It is advisable to paste down a freshly taken  impression, each time, while the ink is still moist, for if these are  allowed to dry, the shrinking of the paper causes errors of register.    When these new blocks are dry, the patch of colour to be cut on each  surface should be clearly indicated by a thin wash of diluted ink or  colour, but not so as to hide the printed key line.    The blocks may then be cut. A V-shaped cut is made round each form, as  in the case of the key-block, and "]]]
