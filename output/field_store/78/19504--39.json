Her form always made excellent progress, and she had a  reputation for obtaining record successes in examinations. To judge from  the first few days of term, she meant to keep up her standard of  efficiency. Miss Burd had mapped out a heavy time-table for  VA., and it was Miss Strong's business to see that the girls  got through it. Of course they grumbled. After the long weeks of the  summer holidays it was doubly difficult to apply their minds to lessons,  and set to work in the evenings to perform the enormous amount of  preparation demanded from them. To some the task was wellnigh  impossible, and poor Fil would send in very imperfect exercises, but  others, Ingred and Verity among the number, had ambitions, and boosted  up the record of the form.    It was after a most strenuous few days that Ingred came to the close of  the first week of the new term, and, taking her books and hand-bag,  started off to spend the week-end at home. She left the College with a  feeling of intense relief. She had dreaded the return there, and the  confession of her altered circumstances. It had not proved quite so  disagreeable an ordeal as she had anticipated, for, after the first  expressions of surprise, nobody had referred again to Rotherwood; yet  Ingred, on the look-out for slights, imagined that she was not treated  with as much consideration as formerly. Avis Marlowe and Jess Howard had  hardly spoken to her, and, though the omission was probably owing to  sheer lack of time or opportunity, she chose to set it down to a desire  to show her the cold shoulder.    \"Now I have no parties to offer them, they don't care about me!\" she  thought bitterly. \"They'll hunt about till they find somebody else who's  likely to act entertainer.\"    Fortunately, as Ingred stepped out of the College on that first Friday  afternoon, the fresh breeze and the bright September sunshine blew away  the cobwebs, and sent her almost dancing down the street. She had a  naturally buoyant disposition, and her uppermost thought was: \"I'm going  home! I'm going home! Hurrah!\"    The journey was really quite a little business. She had to take a tram  to the Waterstoke terminus, then change on to a light electric railway  that ran along the roadside for seven miles to Wynch-on-the-Wold.  Grovebury, an old town that dated back to mediaeval times, lay in a deep  hollow among a rampart of hills, so that, in whatever direction you left  it, you were obliged to climb. The scenery was very beautiful, for trees  edged the river, and clothed the slopes till they gave way to the gorse  and heather of the wild moorlands. Wynch-on-the-Wold was a hamlet which,  since the opening of the electric railway, was just beginning to turn  into a suburb of Grovebury. Close to the terminus neat villas had sprung  up like mushrooms; there were a few shops and a branch post office, and  a brass plate to the effect that Dr. Whittaker had consulting hours  twice a week. Tradesmen's carts drove out constantly, and the electric  railway did quite a little business in the conveyance of parcels.    Wynchcote, the house where the Saxons had retired to try their scheme of  retrenchment, lay at some little distance beyond the terminus, and might  be considered the outpost of the new suburb. It was a small, picturesque  modern bungalow; Mr. Saxon had built it as an architectural experiment,  intending it for a sort of model country cottage. The tenants who had  occupied it during the period of the war had just returned to Scotland,  so, as it was vacant, it had seemed a convenient place in which to  settle. It was near enough to Grovebury to allow him to attend his  office, and far enough away to cut them adrift from old associations.  After four and a half years of war work, Mrs. Saxon wanted a complete  rest from committees, creches, canteens, and recreation huts, and would  be glad to urge the excuse of distance to those who appealed for her  help. Perhaps also she felt that in their straitened circumstances it  was wiser to live where they could not enter into social competition  with their former acquaintances.    \"I just want to be quiet, to attend to my family, and to enjoy the moors  and our garden,\" she declared. \"I believe I'm going to be very happy at  Wynchcote.\"    Though it was small, the bungalow was admirably planned, and had many  advantages. The view from its French window was one of the finest in the  district, and it faced a magnificent gorge, wild, rocky, and thickly  wooded, at the bottom of which wound the silver river that ran through  Grovebury. Civilization, in the shape of fields and hedges, stretched  out fingers as far as Wynchcote, and there stopped abruptly. Past the  bungalow lay the open wold with miles of heather, gorse, and bracken,  and a road edged with low, grassy fern-covered banks instead of walls.  The air blew freshly up here, and was far more bracing and healthy than  down in the hollow of Grovebury. The residents of the new suburb  affected seaside fashions, and went their moorland walks without hats  or gloves.    Ingred was joined in the tram-car by Hereward, who attended the King  George's School, and made the journey daily.    \"Getting quite used to it now!\" he assured his sister airily. \"I  had a terrific run yesterday for the train, but I caught it! There's  another fellow in our form living up here, so we generally go  together--Scampton, that chap in the cricket cap standing by the door.  He's A1. He won't come near now, though, because he says he's terrified  of girls. He's going to give me a rabbit, and I shall make a hutch for  it out of one of those packing-cases. See, I've bought a piece of  wire-netting for the door. There's heaps of room at the bottom of the  garden. I believe I'll ask him to bring it over after tea.\"    \"But the hutch isn't ready,\" objected Ingred.    \"Oh, that won't matter! I can keep it in a packing-case for a day or  two.\"    When Ingred and Hereward reached home they found that tea had been set  out on the patch of grass under the apple trees, and Mother and Quenrede  were sitting sewing and waiting for them. It was one of those beautiful  September days when the air seems almost as warm as in August, and with  the clock still at summer time, the sun had not climbed very far down  the valley. The garden, where Mother and Quenrede had been working  busily all the afternoon, was gay with nasturtiums and asters, and  overhead hung a crop of the rosiest apples ever seen. Minx, the Persian  cat, wandered round, waving a stately tail and mewing plaintively for  her saucer of milk. Derry, the fox terrier, barked an enthusiastic  greeting.    \"Come along, you poor starving wanderers!\" said Mrs. Saxon. \"The  kettle's boiling, and we'll make the tea in half a moment. Isn't it  glorious here? Queenie and I have been digging up potatoes, and we quite  enjoyed it. We felt exactly as if we were 'on the land.' How is your  cold, Hereward? Ingred, you look tired, child! Sit down and rest while  Queenie fetches the teapot.\"    Ingred sank into a garden-chair with much satisfaction. Wynchcote might  not be Rotherwood, but it looked an uncommonly pretty little place in  the September sunshine. To live there would be like a perpetual picnic.  Mother and Queenie looked so complacently smiling that it seemed  impossible to grouse, especially with newly-baked scones and rock-cakes  on the tea-table.    The men kind of the family had not yet returned home. Mr. Saxon and  Egbert rarely left their office before six, and Athelstane had that day  gone over to Birkshaw on the motor-bicycle, to arrange about the medical  course which he was to take at the University. There was plenty of news,  however, to be exchanged. Ingred had to give a full account of her  experiences at school and hostel, and to hear in return the various  achievements in the shape of home-carpentry, mending, making, and  altering which are always an essential part of settling into a new  establishment.    \"I hardly feel I've been round the estate properly yet,\" she said, when  tea was over, and she sat leaning back lazily in her deck-chair, with  Minx purring upon her knee.    \"Then come and lend me a hand with my rabbit-hutch,\" suggested Hereward.  \"Put down that wretched pampered beast of a cat, for goodness sake! If  it gets at my new rabbit, I'll finish it! Yes, I will! I'll hang it or  drown it! Get along, you brute!\"    Hereward's blood-thirsty remarks were ignored by Minx, who, finding  herself dropped from Ingred's lap, took a flying run up his back, and  settled herself on his shoulder, rubbing her head into his neck. He  scratched her under the chin, swung her gently down, and shook a  reproving finger at her.    \"Don't try to come round me with your blarneyings, you siren!\" he  declared. \"Who was it ate my goldfinch? Yes, you may well look guilty!  Don't blink your eyes at me like that! I haven't forgiven you yet, and I  don't think I ever shall. Ingred, old sport, are you coming to help me,  or are you not? I want some one to hold the wire.\"    \"All right, Uncle Podger, I'll come and 'podge' for you,\" laughed  Ingred. \"Don't hammer my fingers, that's all I bargain for. Wait a  moment till I get my overall. Your joinering performances are apt to be  somewhat grubby and messy.\"    There was quite a good garden at the back of the bungalow, with rows of  vegetables and gooseberry bushes and fruit-trees. At the end was a  wooden shed where the motor-bicycle was kept, and a small wired  enclosure originally made for hens.    \"It's exactly the place for rabbits, when I get a hutch for them,\"  explained Hereward, putting down his box of tools, and turning over the  packing-case with a professional eye. \"Now a wooden frame covered with  wire, and a pair of hinges will just do the job. I can saw these pieces  to fit. Hold the wood steady, that's a mascot!\"    The two were kneeling on the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18525"],[0,"On the Trail: An Outdoor Book for Girls (#5)"],[1,"trees can be  felled. Begin in the right way with your very first efforts and follow  the woodsman's method.    Having selected the tree you desire to cut down, determine in which  direction you want it to fall and mark that side, but first make sure  that when falling, the tree will not lodge in another one near by or  drop on one of the camp shelters. See that the way is free of hindrance  before cutting the tree, also _clear the way_ for the swing of your  extended _hatchet_. If there are obstacles, such as vines, bushes, limbs  of other trees, or rocks, which your hatchet might strike as you raise  and lower it while at work, clear them all away, making a generous open  space on all sides, overhead, on the right and left side, and below the  swing of the hatchet. Take no chance of having an accident, as would  occur should the hatchet become entangled or broken.    You may have noticed that the top surface of most stumps has a  splintered ridge across its centre, and on one side of the ridge the  wood is lower than on the other; this is because of the manner in which  a woodsman fells a tree. If he wants the tree to fall toward the west he  marks the west side of the trunk; then he marks the top and bottom of  the space he intends chopping out for the first kerf or notch (Fig. 13,  _A_ and _B_), making the length of space a trifle longer than one-half  of the tree diameter. The kerf is chopped out by cutting first from the  top _A_, then from the bottom _B_ (Fig. 14). When the first kerf is  finished and cut half-way through the tree, space for the kerf on the  opposite side of the tree is marked a few inches higher than the first  one (Fig. 15, _C_ and _D_) and then it also is cut (Fig. 16).    After you have chopped the two kerfs in a tree, you will know when it is  about to fall by the creaking and the slight movement of its top. Step  to _one side_ of the falling tree, never behind or in front of it;  either of the last two ways would probably mean death: if in front, the  tree would fall on you, and if at the back, you would probably be  terribly injured if not killed, as trees often kick backward with  tremendous force as they go down; so be on your guard, keep cool, and  deliberately step to the side of the tree and watch it fall.    Choose a quiet day, when there is no wind, for tree-felling. You cannot  control the wind, and it may control your tree.    Never allow your hatchet to lie on the ground, a menace to every one at  camp, but have a particular log or stump and always strike the blade in  this wood. Leave your hatchet there, where it will not be injured, can  do no harm, and you will always know where to find it (Fig. 17).      =Etiquette of the Wild=    Translated this means \"_hands off_.\" The unwritten law of the woods is  that personal property cached in trees, underbrush, beneath stones, or  hidden underground must never be _taken_, _borrowed_, _used_, or  _molested_.    Canoes and oars will often be discovered left by owners, sometimes  fastened at the water's edge, again suspended from trees, and the  temptation to borrow may be strong, but remember such an act would be  dishonorable and against the rules that govern the outdoor world.    Provisions, tools, or other articles found in the forests should be  respected and allowed to remain where they are. It is customary for  campers to cache their belongings with the assurance that forest  etiquette will be held inviolate and their goods remain unmolested.    Every one has the privilege of examining and enjoying the beauties of  mosses, berries, and wild flowers, but do not take these treasures from  their homes to die and be thrown aside. Love them well enough to let  them stay where they are for others also to enjoy, unless you need  specimens for some important special study.    A man who had always lived in the Adirondack forests, and at present is  proprietor of an Adirondack hotel, recently reforested many acres of his  wooded wild lands by planting through the forests little young trees,  some not over one foot high, and his indignation was great when he  discovered that many of his guests when off on tramps returned laden  with these baby trees, which were easily pulled up by the roots because  so lately planted.      =Finding Your Way by Natural Signs and the Compass=    An important phase of woodcraft is the ability to find your way in the  wilderness by means of natural signs as well as the compass. If,  however, you do not know at what point of the compass from you the camp  lies, the signs can be of no avail. Having this knowledge, the signs  will be invaluable.    _Get your bearings before leaving camp._ Do not depend upon any member  of the party, but know for yourself.    If you have a map giving the topography of land surrounding the  camping-grounds, consult it. Burn into your memory the direction _from_  camp of outlying landmarks, those near and those as far off as you can  see in all directions. The morning you leave camp, ascertain the  direction of the wind and notice particularly the sun and shadows. If  it is early morning, face the sun and you will be looking toward the  east. Stretch out both arms at your sides and point with your  index-fingers; your right finger will point to the south, your left to  the north, and your back will be toward the west. What landmarks do you  see east of the camp? South? North? West? And from what point of the  compass does the wind blow? If it comes from the west and you trail  eastward, the wind will strike your back going away from camp and should  strike your face returning, provided its direction does not change.  Again, if you go east, your camp will lie west of you, and your homeward  path must be westward. Consult your compass and know exactly which  direction you take when leaving camp, and blaze your trail as you go,  looking backward frequently to see how landmarks should appear as you  face them returning.    With all these friends to guide you, first, the map; second, sun; third,  shadows; fourth, wind; fifth, compass; sixth, your bent-twig blazing,  there will be little, if any, danger of being lost. But you must  constantly keep on the alert and refer frequently to these guides,  especially when deflecting from the course first taken after leaving  camp. At every turning, stop and take your bearings anew; you cannot be  too careful.    These signs are for daylight; at night the North Star will be your  guide.      =Sunlight and Shadow=    Bearing in mind that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, it  will be comparatively easy to keep your right course by consulting the  sun. A fair idea may also be gained of the time of day by the length of  shadows, if you remember that shadows are long in the morning and  continue to grow shorter until midday, when they again begin to  lengthen, growing longer and longer until night.    To find the direction of the sun on a cloudy day, hold a flat splinter  or your knife blade vertically, so that it is absolutely straight up and  down. Place the point of the blade on your thumb-nail, watch-case, or  other glossy surface; then turn the knife or splinter around until the  full shadow of the flat of blade or splinter falls on the bright  surface, telling the location of the sun.    An open spot where the sun can cast a clear shadow, and an hour when the  sun is not immediately overhead, will give best results.      =Wind=    The wind generally blows in the same direction all day, and if you learn  to understand its ways, the wind will help you keep the right trail.  Make a practise of testing the direction of the wind every morning.  Notice the leaves on bush and tree, in what direction they move. Place a  few bits of paper on your open hand and watch in which way the wind  carries them; if there is no paper, try the test with dry leaves, grass,  or anything light and easily carried by the breeze. Smoke will also show  the direction of the wind.    When the wind is very faint, put your finger in your mouth, wet it on  all sides, and hold it up; the side on which the wind blows will feel  cool and tell from what quarter the wind comes: if on the east side of  your finger, the wind blows from the east, and so on. Keep testing the  direction of the wind as you trail, and if at any time it cools a  different side of the finger, you will know that you are not walking in  the same direction as when you left camp and must turn until the wet  finger tells you which way to go. The wind is a good guide so long as  it keeps blowing in the same direction as when you left camp.      =Use of Compass=    Should you be on the trail and sudden storm-clouds appear, the sun  cannot help you find your way; the shadows have gone. Moss on  tree-trunks is not an infallible guide and you must turn to the compass  to show the way, but unless you understand its language you will not  know what it is telling you. Learn the language before going to camp; it  is not difficult.    Hold the compass out in a _level position_ directly in front of you; be  _sure_ it is level; then decide to go north. Consult the compass and  ascertain in which direction the north lies. The compass needle points  directly north with the north end of the needle; this end is usually  black, sometimes pearl. Let your eye follow straight along the line  pointed out by the needle; as you look ahead select a landmark--tree,  rock, pond, or whatever may lie in that direction. Choose an object  quite a distance off on the imaginary line, go directly toward it, and  when intervening objects obscure the landmark, refer to your compass. If  you have turned from the pathway north, face around and readjust your  steps in the right direction. Do not let over two minutes pass without  making sure by the compass that you are going on the right path, going  directly north.
