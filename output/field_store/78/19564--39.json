Rather live amid the ice than among modern virtues and other such  south-winds!... We were brave enough; we spared neither ourselves nor  others; but we were a long time finding out _where_ to direct our  courage. We grew dismal; they called us fatalists. _Our_ fate--it was  the fulness, the tension, the _storing up_ of powers. We thirsted for  the lightnings and great deeds; we kept as far as possible from the  happiness of the weakling, from \"resignation\"... There was thunder in  our air; nature, as we embodied it, became overcast--_for we had not yet  found the way_. The formula of our happiness: a Yea, a Nay, a straight  line, a _goal_....    [1] _Cf._ the tenth Pythian ode. See also the fourth book of Herodotus.  The Hyperboreans were a mythical people beyond the Rhipaean mountains,  in the far North. They enjoyed unbroken happiness and perpetual youth.      2.    What is good?--Whatever augments the feeling of power, the will to  power, power itself, in man.    What is evil?--Whatever springs from weakness.    What is happiness?--The feeling that power _increases_--that resistance  is overcome.    Not contentment, but more power; _not_ peace at any price, but war;  _not_ virtue, but efficiency (virtue in the Renaissance sense, _virtu_,  virtue free of moral acid).    The weak and the botched shall perish: first principle of _our_ charity.  And one should help them to it.    What is more harmful than any vice?--Practical sympathy for the botched  and the weak--Christianity....      3.    The problem that I set here is not what shall replace mankind in the  order of living creatures (--man is an end--): but what type of man must  be _bred_, must be _willed_, as being the most valuable, the most worthy  of life, the most secure guarantee of the future.    This more valuable type has appeared often enough in the past: but  always as a happy accident, as an exception, never as deliberately  _willed_. Very often it has been precisely the most feared; hitherto it  has been almost _the_ terror of terrors;--and out of that terror the  contrary type has been willed, cultivated and _attained_: the domestic  animal, the herd animal, the sick brute-man--the Christian....      4.    Mankind surely does _not_ represent an evolution toward a better or  stronger or higher level, as progress is now understood. This \"progress\"  is merely a modern idea, which is to say, a false idea. The European of  today, in his essential worth, falls far below the European of the  Renaissance; the process of evolution does _not_ necessarily mean  elevation, enhancement, strengthening.    True enough, it succeeds in isolated and individual cases in various  parts of the earth and under the most widely different cultures, and in  these cases a _higher_ type certainly manifests itself; something which,  compared to mankind in the mass, appears as a sort of superman. Such  happy strokes of high success have always been possible, and will remain  possible, perhaps, for all time to come. Even whole races, tribes and  nations may occasionally represent such lucky accidents.      5.    We should not deck out and embellish Christianity: it has waged a war to  the death against this _higher_ type of man, it has put all the deepest  instincts of this type under its ban, it has developed its concept of  evil, of the Evil One himself, out of these instincts--the strong man as  the typical reprobate, the \"outcast among men.\" Christianity has taken  the part of all the weak, the low, the botched; it has made an ideal out  of _antagonism_ to all the self-preservative instincts of sound life; it  has corrupted even the faculties of those natures that are  intellectually most vigorous, by representing the highest intellectual  values as sinful, as misleading, as full of temptation. The most  lamentable example: the corruption of Pascal, who believed that his  intellect had been destroyed by original sin, whereas it was actually  destroyed by Christianity!--      6.    It is a painful and tragic spectacle that rises before me: I have drawn  back the curtain from the _rottenness_ of man. This word, in my mouth,  is at least free from one suspicion: that it involves a moral accusation  against humanity. It is used--and I wish to emphasize the fact  again--without any moral significance: and this is so far true that the  rottenness I speak of is most apparent to me precisely in those quarters  where there has been most aspiration, hitherto, toward \"virtue\" and  \"godliness.\" As you probably surmise, I understand rottenness in the  sense of _decadence_: my argument is that all the values on which  mankind now fixes its highest aspirations are _decadence_-values.    I call an animal, a species, an individual corrupt, when it loses its  instincts, when it chooses, when it _prefers_, what is injurious to it.  A history of the \"higher feelings,\" the \"ideals of humanity\"--and it is  possible that I'll have to write it--would almost explain why man is so  degenerate. Life itself appears to me as an instinct for growth, for  survival, for the accumulation of forces, for _power_: whenever the will  to power fails there is disaster. My contention is that all the highest  values of humanity have been emptied of this will--that the values of  _decadence_, of _nihilism_, now prevail under the holiest names.      7.    Christianity is called the religion of _pity_.--Pity stands in  opposition to all the tonic passions that augment the energy of the  feeling of aliveness: it is a depressant. A man loses power when he  pities. Through pity that drain upon strength which suffering works is  multiplied a thousandfold. Suffering is made contagious by pity; under  certain circumstances it may lead to a total sacrifice of life and  living energy--a loss out of all proportion to the magnitude of the  cause (--the case of the death of the Nazarene). This is the first view  of it; there is, however, a still more important one. If one measures  the effects of pity by the gravity of the reactions it sets up, its  character as a menace to life appears in a much clearer light. Pity  thwarts the whole law of evolution, which is the law of natural  selection. It preserves whatever is ripe for destruction; it fights on  the side of those disinherited and condemned by life; by maintaining  life in so many of the botched of all kinds, it gives life itself a  gloomy and dubious aspect. Mankind has ventured to call pity a virtue  (--in every _superior_ moral system it appears as a weakness--); going  still further, it has been called _the_ virtue, the source and  foundation of all other virtues--but let us always bear in mind that  this was from the standpoint of a philosophy that was nihilistic, and  upon whose shield _the denial of life_ was inscribed. Schopenhauer was  right in this: that by means of pity life is denied, and made _worthy of  denial_--pity is the technic of nihilism. Let me repeat: this depressing  and contagious instinct stands against all those instincts which work  for the preservation and enhancement of life: in the role of _protector_  of the miserable, it is a prime agent in the promotion of  _decadence_--pity persuades to extinction.... Of course, one doesn't say  \"extinction\": one says \"the other world,\" or \"God,\" or \"the _true_  life,\" or Nirvana, salvation, blessedness.... This innocent rhetoric,  from the realm of religious-ethical balderdash, appears _a good deal  less innocent_ when one reflects upon the tendency that it conceals  beneath sublime words: the tendency to _destroy life_. Schopenhauer was  hostile to life: that is why pity appeared to him as a virtue....  Aristotle, as every one knows, saw in pity a sickly and dangerous state  of mind, the remedy for which was an occasional purgative: he regarded  tragedy as that purgative. The instinct of life should prompt us to seek  some means of puncturing any such pathological and dangerous  accumulation of pity as that appearing in Schopenhauer's case (and also,  alack, in that of our whole literary _decadence_, from St. Petersburg to  Paris, from Tolstoi to Wagner), that it may burst and be discharged....  Nothing is more unhealthy, amid all our unhealthy modernism, than  Christian pity. To be the doctors _here_, to be unmerciful _here_, to  wield the knife _here_--all this is _our_ business, all this is _our_  sort of humanity, by this sign we are philosophers, we Hyperboreans!--      8.    It is necessary to say just _whom_ we regard as our antagonists:  theologians and all who have any theological blood in their veins--this  is our whole philosophy.... One must have faced that menace at close  hand, better still, one must have had experience of it directly and  almost succumbed to it, to realize that it is not to be taken lightly  (--the alleged free-thinking of our naturalists and physiologists seems  to me to be a joke--they have no passion about such things; they have  not suffered--). This poisoning goes a great deal further than most  people think: I find the arrogant habit of the theologian among all who  regard themselves as \"idealists\"--among all who, by virtue of a higher  point of departure, claim a right to rise above reality, and to look  upon it with suspicion.... The idealist, like the ecclesiastic, carries  all sorts of lofty concepts in his hand (--and not only in his hand!);  he launches them with benevolent contempt against \"understanding,\" \"the  senses,\" \"honor,\" \"good living,\" \"science\"; he sees such things as  _beneath_ him, as pernicious and seductive forces, on which \"the soul\"  soars as a pure thing-in-itself--as if humility, chastity, poverty, in a  word, _holiness_, had not already done much more damage to life than all  imaginable horrors and vices.... The pure soul is a pure lie....

The song priest and choir all the while sang a  weird chant. The gods raised the bough, gave their peculiar hoots, and  disappeared from the lodge, carrying with them the pine bough with the  mask attached to it. In a few minutes they came back with the mask. After  the chant the song-priest placed meal on the soles of the invalid's feet,  knees, palms, breast, back, shoulders, and head, and then put some in the  cavity, after which the cavity was filled with earth. Two coals were laid  in front of the invalid, and upon these the song priest placed finely  broken herbs; an attendant sprinkled water on the herbs, and the invalid  inhaled the fumes. The cotton cloth was removed from the blanket rug, and  the invalid stepped upon the rug and put on his clothing. When the mask  was removed from the invalid's head it drew all fever with it.                                  [Illustration]            FOURTH DAY.          FIRST CEREMONY.      The theurgist carried a bowl of water and pine needles, and an attendant  bore a gourd of water, a small vase of powdered herbs, and an Apache  basket containing corn meal, buckskin bags, horn of the mountain sheep and  a piece of hide cut from between the eyes of the animal. The theurgist and  attendant took seats to the right of the entrance of the sweat house west  of the medicine lodge. This sweat house was decorated with the rainbow.  Over the entrance were, first, two striped blankets, one upon the other, a  buckskin, and a piece of white cotton. Hot stones, etc., having been  previously placed in the sweat house, the sick man entered. The  song-priest and four attendants sang, accompanied by the rattle. At the  conclusion of the chant Hasjelti and Hostjoghon appeared as on the  previous days. Hasjelti lifted the coverings from the entrance and the  invalid came out and sat upon a blanket south of the entrance and bathed  both his hands in the bowl containing the pine needles and water; he then  drank of it and bathed his feet and legs to the thighs, his arms and  shoulders, body and face and head, and then emptied the remainder over his  back. Hasjelti manipulated the right leg with the sheep's horn and hide,  rubbing the upper part of the leg with the right hand, then the under part  with the left; he then rubbed the sides of the leg in the same manner,  each time giving a hoot; the arms, chest, head, and face were similarly  manipulated. Hostjoghon repeated the hooting every time he changed the  position of the hands. Hasjelti, taking the gourd containing the water and  corn meal, gave four draughts of it to the invalid, hooting each time the  bowl was put to the lips; Hostjoghon did the same. The song and rattle  continued. Hasjelti, then put the powdered plants from the small vase to  the soles of the feet, knees, palms, breast, back, shoulders, and top of  the head of the invalid, hooting each time an application was made; this  was repeated by Hostjoghon. The invalid took a sip from the bowl and  rubbed the remainder over his body. The song-priest then removed the wands  from the base of the sweat house and the coverings from the door; the pine  boughs and hot stones were also removed and the invalid preceded the  song-priest to the medicine lodge. All the wood of the sweat house was  placed in a tree, excepting four small pieces, which were deposited,  together with the pine boughs from the interior of the sweat house, in a  semicircle formed by the rocks from the sweat house at the base of a pinon  tree. A line of meal 2 inches in length running east and west was  sprinkled on the apex of the semicircle, and upon this line the black tube  was laid. A bit of meal was sprinkled on the tube and a quantity over the  pine boughs of this small shrine. Before sprinkling the meal on the top of  the medicine tube the attendant waved his hand in a circle from left to  right, calling \"hooshontko;\" meaning: Widespread blessings that come not  from spoken words, but come to all, that people may have the blessings of  corn pollen, and that tongues may speak with the softness of corn pollen.          SECOND CEREMONY.      A rug was laid in front of the theurgist. Four medicine tubes were placed  on the rug, the one to the north end being white; the second one black and  red, a white line dividing the two colors; the third one, blue; the  fourth, black. The white tube was an offering to Hasjelti; the red, to  Zaadoltjaii; the blue, to Hostjoboard; the black, to Naaskiddi, the  hunchback. The tubes were filled as before described. These tubes were  begun and finished by the same person. (See Pl. CXVI.) When the tubes were  finished they were put into corn husks and bits of cotton cloth; tiny  pieces of turquois, white shell, abalone, and archaic black beads having  first been placed on the husks and cloths. The four turkey plumes with  barred tips that lay upon the rug were subsequently placed upon the tubes.  These parcels were sprinkled by the song priest with corn pollen, and  after closing them he placed them in the hands of the invalid, who sat at  the northeast corner of the rug facing east. The song-priest sat before  him and said a long prayer, which the invalid repeated. At the close of  the prayer an aged attendant received the parcels from the theurgist and  placed them to the soles of the feet, palms, etc., of the invalid. They  were afterward placed to his mouth and he drew from them a long breath.  The old man carried the parcels south over the brow of a hill and  deposited them in secluded spots about 4 feet apart, repeating a brief  prayer over each one; he then motioned toward the east, south, west, and  north, and returned to the lodge. During his absence the choir sang; in  the meantime the fire in the lodge was reduced to embers.          THIRD CEREMONY.      About noon a circular bed of sand, some four inches in height and four  feet in diameter, was made. Five grains of corn and five pine boughs were  laid thereon; four of the grains of corn and four of the boughs were  placed to the cardinal points. The fifth and center branch of pine covered  most of the circle, its tips pointing to the east. The fifth grain of corn  was dropped in the center of the sand bed. (See Pl. CXVII, 1). Four of  these pine boughs were cut from the east, south, north, and west sides of  one tree. The fifth bough may be taken from any part of the tree. Of the  five grains of corn one must be white, one yellow, and one blue, and the  other two grains may be of either of these three colors. On this  particular occasion there were two blue, two white, and one yellow. These  grains were, after the ceremony, dried and ground by the theurgist and  placed among his medicines. The boughs and sand absorbed the disease from  the invalid, and at the close of the ceremony they were carried to the  north and deposited in a shady spot that the sun might not touch and  develop the latent disease that had been absorbed by them. The boughs and  sand were never afterward to be touched. An Apache basket containing yucca  root and water was placed in front of the circle. (See Pl. CXVII 2.) There  was a second basket south of it which contained water and a quantity of  pine needles sufficiently thick to form a dry surface, and on the top a  number of valuable necklaces of coral, turquois, and silver. A square was  formed on the edge of the basket with four turkey wands. (See Pl. CXVII  3.) The song-priest with rattle led the choir. The invalid sat to the  northeast of the circle; a breechcloth was his only apparel. During the  chanting an attendant made suds from the yucca. The basket remained in  position; the man stooped over it facing north; his position allowed the  sunbeams which came through the fire opening to fall upon the suds. When  the basket was a mass of white froth the attendant washed the suds from  his hands by pouring a gourd of water over them, after which the  song-priest came forward and with corn pollen drew a cross over the suds,  which stood firm like the beaten whites of eggs, the arms of the cross  pointing to the cardinal points. A circle of the pollen was then made  around the edge of the suds. The attendant who prepared the suds touched  his right hand to the four points of the pollen lines and in the center  and placed it upon the head of the patient who first made a circle  embracing the sand and basket and then knelt upon the boughs in the center  of the sand.(3) A handful of the suds was afterwards put upon his head.  The basket was placed near him and he bathed his head thoroughly; the  maker of the suds afterwards assisted him in bathing the entire body with  the suds, and pieces of yucca were rubbed upon the body. The chant  continued through the ceremony and closed just as the remainder of the  suds was emptied by the attendant over the invalid's head. The song priest  collected the four wands from the second basket and an attendant gathered  the necklaces. A second attendant placed the basket before the invalid who  was now sitting in the center of the circle and the first attendant  assisted him in bathing the entire body with this mixture; the body was  quite covered with the pine needles which had become very soft from  soaking. The invalid then returned to his former position at the left of  the song priest, and the pine needles and yucca, together with the sands,  were carried out and deposited at the base of a pinon tree. The body of  the invalid was dried by rubbing with meal.                                  [Illustration]          FOURTH CEREMONY.      This ceremony commenced almost immediately after the close of the one  preceding. The rug was spread over the ground in front of the song priest;  four bunches of small sticks were brought in and laid in piles north,  south, east, and west of the rug. Four attendants took seats, each before  a pile of the wood, and scraped off the bark of their respective heaps;  they then cut twelve pieces 2"]]]
