Nor was this change confined to  military installations. By the time it was over, the armed forces had  redefined their traditional obligation for the welfare of their  members to include a promise of equal treatment for black servicemen  wherever they might be. In the name of equality of treatment and  opportunity, the Department of Defense began to challenge racial  injustices deeply rooted in American society.    For all its sweeping implications, equality in the armed forces  obviously had its pragmatic aspects. In one sense it was a practical  answer to pressing political problems that had plagued several  national administrations. In another, it was the services' expression  of those liberalizing tendencies that were permeating American society  during the era of civil rights activism. But to a considerable extent  the policy of racial equality that evolved in this quarter century was  also a response to the need for military efficiency. So easy did it  become to demonstrate the connection between inefficiency and  discrimination that, even when other reasons existed, military  efficiency was the one most often evoked by defense officials to  justify a change in racial policy.      _The Armed Forces Before 1940_    Progress toward equal treatment and opportunity in the armed forces  was an uneven process, the result of sporadic and sometimes  conflicting pressures derived from such constants in American society  as prejudice and idealism and spurred by a chronic shortage of  military manpower. In his pioneering study of race relations, Gunnar  Myrdal observes that ideals have always played a dominant role in the  social dynamics of America.[1-1] By extension, the ideals that helped  involve the nation in many of its wars also helped produce important  changes in the treatment of Negroes by the armed forces. The  democratic spirit embodied in the Declaration of Independence, for  example, opened the Continental Army to many Negroes, holding out to  them the promise of eventual freedom.[1-2]                       [Footnote 1-1: Gunnar Myrdal, _The American Dilemma:                     The Negro Problem and Modern Democracy_, rev. ed.

For a general survey of black soldiers in                     America's wars, see Jack Foner, _Blacks and the                     Military in American History: A New Perspective_                     (New York: Praeger, 1974).]    Yet the fact that the British themselves were taking large numbers (p. 004)  of Negroes into their ranks proved more important than revolutionary  idealism in creating a place for Negroes in the American forces. Above  all, the participation of both slaves and freedmen in the Continental  Army and the Navy was a pragmatic response to a pressing need for  fighting men and laborers. Despite the fear of slave insurrection  shared by many colonists, some 5,000 Negroes, the majority from New  England, served with the American forces in the Revolution, often in  integrated units, some as artillerymen and musicians, the majority as  infantrymen or as unarmed pioneers detailed to repair roads and  bridges.    Again, General Jackson's need for manpower at New Orleans explains the  presence of the Louisiana Free Men of Color in the last great battle  of the War of 1812. In the Civil War the practical needs of the Union  Army overcame the Lincoln administration's fear of alienating the  border states. When the call for volunteers failed to produce the  necessary men, Negroes were recruited, generally as laborers at first  but later for combat. In all, 186,000 Negroes served in the Union  Army. In addition to those in the sixteen segregated combat regiments  and the labor units, thousands also served unofficially as laborers,  teamsters, and cooks. Some 30,000 Negroes served in the Navy, about 25  percent of its total Civil War strength.    The influence of the idealism fostered by the abolitionist crusade  should not be overlooked. It made itself felt during the early months  of the war in the demands of Radical Republicans and some Union  generals for black enrollment, and it brought about the postwar  establishment of black units in the Regular Army. In 1866 Congress  authorized the creation of permanent, all-black units, which in 1869  were designated the 9th and 10th Cavalry and the 24th and 25th  Infantry.    [Illustration: CREWMEN OF THE USS MIAMI DURING THE CIVIL WAR]    Military needs and idealistic impulses were not enough to guarantee  uninterrupted racial progress; in fact, the status of black servicemen  tended to reflect the changing patterns in American race relations.  During most of the nineteenth century, for example, Negroes served in  an integrated U.S. Navy, in the latter half of the century averaging  between 20 and 30 percent of the enlisted strength.[1-3] But the  employment of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2060"],[0,"The History of Caliph Vathek (#5)"],[1,"was a whit more successful: the sight of this  fatal ball was alone sufficient to draw after it every beholder.  The  Muezzins themselves, though they saw it but at a distance, hastened down  from their minarets and mixed with the crowd, which continued to increase  in so surprising a manner, that scarce an inhabitant was left in Samarah,  except the aged, the sick confined to their beds, and infants at the  breast, whose nurses could run more nimbly without them.  Even Carathis,  Morakanabad, and the rest were all become of the party.    The shrill screams of the females, who had broken from their apartments,  and were unable to extricate themselves from the pressure of the crowd,  together with those of the eunuchs jostling after them, terrified lest  their charge should escape from their sight, increased by the execrations  of husbands urging forward and menacing both, kicks given and received,  stumblings and overthrows at every step; in a word, the confusion that  universally prevailed rendered Samarah like a city taken by storm and  devoted to absolute plunder.    At last the cursed Indian, who still preserved his rotundity of figure,  after passing through all the streets and public places, and leaving them  empty, rolled onwards to the plain of Catoul, and traversed the valley at  the foot of the mountain of the Four Fountains.    As a continual fall of water had excavated an immense gulf in the valley,  whose opposite side was closed in by a steep acclivity, the Caliph and  his attendants were apprehensive lest the ball should bound into the  chasm, and, to prevent it, redoubled their efforts, but in vain.  The  Indian persevered in his onward direction, and, as had been apprehended,  glancing from the precipice with the rapidity of lightning, was lost in  the gulf below.    Vathek would have followed the perfidious Giaour, had not an invisible  agency arrested his progress.  The multitude that pressed after him were  at once checked in the same manner, and a calm instantaneously ensued.  They all gazed at each other with an air of astonishment; and,  notwithstanding that the loss of veils and turbans, together with torn  habits and dust blended with sweat, presented a most laughable spectacle,  there was not one smile to be seen; on the contrary, all, with looks of  confusion and sadness, returned in silence to Samarah, and retired to  their inmost apartments, without ever reflecting that they had been  impelled by an invisible power into the extravagance for which they  reproached themselves; for it is but just that men, who so often arrogate  to their own merit the good of which they are but instruments, should  attribute to themselves the absurdities which they could not prevent.    The Caliph was the only person that refused to leave the valley.  He  commanded his tents to be pitched there, and stationed himself on the  very edge of the precipice, in spite of the representations of Carathis  and Morakanabad, who pointed out the hazard of its brink giving way, and  the vicinity to the magician that had so severely tormented him.  Vathek  derided all their remonstrances, and, having ordered a thousand flambeaux  to be lighted, and directed his attendants to proceed in lighting more,  lay down on the slippery margin, and attempted, by help of this  artificial splendour, to look through that gloom which all the fires of  the empyrean had been insufficient to pervade.  One while he fancied to  himself voices arising from the depth of the gulf; at another he seemed  to distinguish the accents of the Indian, but all was no more than the  hollow murmur of waters, and the din of the cataracts that rushed from  steep to steep down the sides of the mountain.    Having passed the night in this cruel perturbation, the Caliph at  daybreak retired to his tent, where, without taking the least sustenance,  he continued to doze till the dusk of evening began again to come on.  He  then resumed his vigils as before, and persevered in observing them for  many nights together.  At length, fatigued with so successless an  employment, he sought relief from change.  To this end he sometimes paced  with hasty strides across the plain, and, as he wildly gazed at the  stars, reproached them with having deceived him; but, lo! on a sudden the  clear blue sky appeared streaked over with streams of blood, which  reached from the valley even to the city of Samarah.  As this awful  phenomenon seemed to touch his tower, Vathek at first thought of  re-pairing thither to view it more distinctly, but feeling himself unable  to advance, and being overcome with apprehension, he muffled up his face  in his robe.    Terrifying as these prodigies were, this impression upon him was no more  than momentary, and served only to stimulate his love of the marvellous.  Instead, therefore, of returning to his palace, he persisted in the  resolution of abiding where the Indian vanished from his view.  One  night, however, while he was walking as usual on the plain, the moon and  the stars at once were eclipsed, and a total darkness ensued; the earth  trembled beneath him, and a voice came forth, the voice of the Giaour,  who, in accents more sonorous than thunder, thus addressed him: \"Wouldest  thou devote thyself to me?  Adore then the terrestrial influences, and  abjure Mahomet.  On these conditions I will bring thee to the palace of  subterranean fire; there shalt thou behold in immense depositories the  treasures which the stars have promised thee, and which will be conferred  by those Intelligences whom thou shalt thus render propitious.  It was  from thence I brought my sabres, and it is there that Soliman Ben Daoud  reposes, surrounded by the talismans that control the world.\"    The astonished Caliph trembled as he answered, yet in a style that showed  him to be no novice in preternatural adventures: \"Where art thou? be  present to my eyes; dissipate the gloom that perplexes me, and of which I  deem thee the cause; after the many flambeaux I have burnt to discover  thee, thou mayst at least grant a glimpse of thy horrible visage.\"    \"Abjure, then, Mahomet,\" replied the Indian, \"and promise me full proofs  of thy sincerity, otherwise thou shalt never behold me again.\"    The unhappy Caliph, instigated by insatiable curiosity, lavished his  promises in the utmost profusion.  The sky immediately brightened; and by  the light of the planets, which seemed almost to blaze, Vathek beheld the  earth open, and at the extremity of a vast black chasm, a portal of  ebony, before which stood the Indian, still blacker, holding in his hand  a golden key that caused the lock to resound.    \"How,\" cried Vathek, \"can I descend to thee without the certainty of  breaking my neck? come, take me, and instantly open the portal.\"    \"Not so fast,\" replied the Indian, \"impatient Caliph!  Know that I am  parched with thirst, and cannot open this door till my thirst be  thoroughly appeased.  I require the blood of fifty of the most beautiful  sons of thy vizirs and great men, or neither can my thirst nor thy  curiosity be satisfied.  Return to Samarah, procure for me this necessary  libation, come back hither, throw it thyself into this chasm, and then  shalt thou see!\"    Having thus spoken, the Indian turned his back on the Caliph, who,  incited by the suggestion of demons, resolved on the direful sacrifice.  He now pretended to have regained his tranquillity, and set out for  Samarah amidst the acclamations of a people who still loved him, and  forbore not to rejoice when they believed him to have recovered his  reason.  So successfully did he conceal the emotion of his heart, that  even Carathis and Morakanabad were equally deceived with the rest.  Nothing was heard of but festivals and rejoicings; the ball, which no  tongue had hitherto ventured to mention, was again brought on the tapis;  a general laugh went round, though many, still smarting under the hands  of the surgeon from the hurts received in that memorable adventure, had  no great reason for mirth.    The prevalence of this gay humour was not a little grateful to Vathek, as  perceiving how much it conduced to his project.  He put on the appearance  of affability to every one, but especially to his vizirs and the grandees  of his court, whom he failed not to regale with a sumptuous banquet,  during which he insensibly inclined the conversation to the children of  his guests.  Having asked with a good-natured air who of them were  blessed with the handsomest boys, every father at once asserted the  pretensions of his own, and the contest imperceptibly grew so warm that  nothing could have withholden them from coming to blows but their  profound reverence for the person of the Caliph.  Under the pretence,  therefore, of reconciling the disputants, Vathek took upon him to decide;  and with this view commanded the boys to be brought.    It was not long before a troop of these poor children made their  appearance, all equipped by their fond mothers with such ornaments as  might give the greatest relief to their beauty or most advantageously  display the graces of their age.  But whilst this brilliant assemblage  attracted the eyes and hearts of every one besides, the Caliph  scrutinized each in his turn with a malignant avidity that passed for  attention, and selected from their number the fifty whom he judged the  Giaour would prefer.    With an equal show of kindness as before, he proposed to celebrate a  festival on the plain for the entertainment of his young favourites, who  he said ought to rejoice still more than all at the restoration of his  health, on account of the favours he intended for them.    The Caliph's proposal was received with the greatest delight, and soon  published through Samarah; litters, camels, and horses were prepared.  Women and children, old men and young, every one placed himself in the  station he chose.  The cavalcade set forward, attended by all the  confectioners"]]]
