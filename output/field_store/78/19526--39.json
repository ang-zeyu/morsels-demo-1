It was at the best a hybrid, mongrel art, borrowed from many  sources and distributed to many points of the compass. At one time it  had a strong Assyrian cast, at another an Egyptian cast, and after  Greece arose it accepted a retroactive influence from there.    It is impossible to characterize the Phoenician type, and even the  Cypriote type, though more pronounced, varies so with the different  influences that it has no very striking individuality. Technically  both the Phoenician and Cypriote were fair workmen in bronze and  stone, and doubtless taught many technical methods to the early  Greeks, besides making known to them those deities afterward adopted  under the names of Aphrodite, Adonis, and Heracles, and familiarizing  them with the art forms of Egypt and Assyria.    [Illustration: FIG. 10.--CYPRIOTE VASE DECORATION. (FROM PERROT AND  CHIPIEZ.)]    As for painting, there was undoubtedly figured decoration upon walls  of stone and plaster, but there is not enough left to us from all the  small nations like Phoenicia, Judea, Cyprus, and the kingdoms of  Asia Minor, put together, to patch up a disjointed history. The first  lands to meet the spoiler, their very ruins have perished. All that  there is of painting comes to us in broken potteries and color traces  on statuary. The remains of sculpture and architecture are of course  better preserved. None of this intermediate art holds much rank by  virtue of its inherent worth. It is its influence upon the West--the  ideas, subjects, and methods it imparted to the Greeks--that gives it  importance in art history.         ART REMAINS: In painting chiefly the vases in the       Metropolitan Museum, New York, the Louvre, British and       Berlin Museums. These give a poor and incomplete idea of the       painting in Asia Minor, Phoenicia and her colonies. The       terra-cottas, figurines in bronze, and sculptures can be       studied to more advantage. The best collection of Cypriote       antiquities is in the Metropolitan Museum, New York. A new       collection of Judaic art has been recently opened in the       Louvre.          CHAPTER III.    GREEK PAINTING.

GREECE AND THE GREEKS: The origin of the Greek race is not positively  known. It is reasonably supposed that the early settlers in Greece  came from the region of Asia Minor, either across the Hellespont or  the sea, and populated the Greek islands and the mainland. When this  was done has been matter of much conjecture. The early history is  lost, but art remains show that in the period before Homer the Greeks  were an established race with habits and customs distinctly  individual. Egyptian and Asiatic influences are apparent in their art  at this early time, but there is, nevertheless, the mark of a race  peculiarly apart from all the races of the older world.    The development of the Greek people was probably helped by favorable  climate and soil, by commerce and conquest, by republican institutions  and political faith, by freedom of mind and of body; but all these  together are not sufficient to account for the keenness of intellect,  the purity of taste, and the skill in accomplishment which showed in  every branch of Greek life. The cause lies deeper in the fundamental  make-up of the Greek mind, and its eternal aspiration toward mental,  moral, and physical ideals. Perfect mind, perfect body, perfect  conduct in this world were sought-for ideals. The Greeks aspired to  completeness. The course of education and race development trained  them physically as athletes and warriors, mentally as philosophers,  law-makers, poets, artists, morally as heroes whose lives and actions  emulated those of the gods, and were almost perfect for this world.    ART MOTIVES: Neither the monarchy nor the priesthood commanded the  services of the artist in Greece, as in Assyria and Egypt. There was  no monarch in an oriental sense, and the chosen leaders of the Greeks  never, until the late days, arrogated art to themselves. It was  something for all the people.    In religion there was a pantheon of gods established and worshipped  from the earliest ages, but these gods were more like epitomes of  Greek ideals than spiritual beings. They were the personified virtues  of the Greeks, exemplars of perfect living; and in worshipping them  the Greek was really worshipping order, conduct, repose, dignity,  perfect life. The gods and heroes, as types of moral and physical  qualities, were continually represented in an allegorical or legendary  manner. Athene represented noble warfare, Zeus was majestic dignity  and power, Aphrodite love, Phoebus song, Nike triumph, and all the  lesser gods, nymphs, and fauns stood for beauties of nature or of  life. The great bulk of Greek architecture, sculpture, and painting  was put forth to honor these gods or heroes, and by so doing the  artist repeated the national ideals and honored himself. The first  motive of Greek art, then, was to praise Hellas and the Hellenic view  of life. In part it was a religious motive, but with little of that  spiritual significance and belief which ruled in Egypt, and later on  in Italy.    [Illustration: FIG. 11.--ATTIC GRAVE PAINTING. (FROM BAUMEISTER.)]    A second and ever-present motive in Greek painting was decoration.  This appears in the tomb pottery of the earliest ages, and was carried  on down to the latest times. Vase painting, wall painting, tablet and  sculpture painting were all done with a decorative motive in view.  Even the easel or panel pictures had some decorative effect about  them, though they were primarily intended to convey ideas other than  those of form and color.    SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The gods and heroes, their lives and adventures,  formed the early subjects of Greek painting. Certain themes taken  from the \"Iliad\" and the \"Odyssey\" were as frequently shown as,  afterward, the Annunciations in Italian painting. The traditional  subjects, the Centaurs and Lapiths, the Amazon war, Theseus and  Ariadne, Perseus and Andromeda, were frequently depicted. Humanity and  actual Greek life came in for its share. Single figures, still-life,  _genre_, caricature, all were shown, and as painting neared the  Alexandrian age a semi-realistic portraiture came into vogue.    The materials employed by the Greeks and their methods of work are  somewhat difficult to ascertain, because there are few Greek pictures,  except those on the vases, left to us. From the confusing accounts of  the ancient writers, the vases, some Greek slabs in Italy, and the  Roman paintings imitative of the Greek, we may gain a general idea.  The early Greek work was largely devoted to pottery and tomb  decoration, in which much in manner and method was borrowed from Asia,  Phoenicia, and Egypt. Later on, painting appeared in flat outline on  stone or terra-cotta slabs, sometimes representing processional  scenes, as in Egypt, and doubtless done in a hybrid fresco-work  similar to the Egyptian method. Wall paintings were done in fresco and  distemper, probably upon the walls themselves, and also upon panels  afterward let into the wall. Encaustic painting (color mixed with wax  upon the panel and fused with a hot spatula) came in with the  Sikyonian school. It is possible that the oil medium and canvas were  known, but not probable that either was ever used extensively.    There is no doubt about the Greeks being expert draughtsmen, though  this does not appear until late in history. They knew the outlines  well, and drew them with force and grace. That they modelled in strong  relief is more questionable. Light-and-shade was certainly employed in  the figure, but not in any modern way. Perspective in both figures and  landscape was used; but the landscape was at first symbolic and  rarely got beyond a decorative background for the figure. Greek  composition we know little about, but may infer that it was largely a  series of balances, a symmetrical adjustment of objects to fill a  given space with not very much freedom allowed to the artist. In  atmosphere, sunlight, color, and those peculiarly sensuous charms that  belong to painting, there is no reason to believe that the Greeks  approached the moderns. Their interest was chiefly centred in the  human figure. Landscape, with its many beauties, was reserved for  modern hands to disclose. Color was used in abundance, without doubt,  but it was probably limited to the leading hues, with little of that  refinement or delicacy known in painting to-day.    ART HISTORY: For the history of Greek painting we have to rely upon  the words of Aristotle, Plutarch, Pliny, Quintilian, Lucian, Cicero,  Pausanias. Their accounts appear to be partly substantiated by the  vase paintings, and such few slabs and Roman frescos as remain to us.  There is no consecutive narrative. The story of painting originating  from a girl seeing the wall-silhouette of her lover and filling it in  with color, and the conjecture of painting having developed from  embroidery work, have neither of them a foundation in fact. The  earliest settlers of Greece probably learned painting from the  Phoenicians, and employed it, after the Egyptian, Assyrian, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18908"],[0,"Christmas (#5)"],[1," gladness of the cry.

Leave, O lambs, the dripping sedges, quit the bramble and the brier,      Leave the fields of barley stubble, for we light the watching fire;      Twinkling fires across the twilight, and a bitter watch to keep,      Lest the prowlers come a-thieving where the flocks unguarded sleep.            Oh, the Shepherds in Judea,            They are singing soft and low--          Song the blessed angels taught them            All the centuries ago!        There was never roof to hide them, there were never walls to bind;      Stark they lie beneath the star-beams, whom the blessed angels find,      With the huddled flocks upstarting, wondering if they hear aright,      While the Kings come riding, riding, solemn shadows in the night.            Oh, the Shepherds in Judea,            They are thinking, as they go,          Of the light that broke their watching            On the hillside in the snow!--        Scattered snow along the hillside, white as springtime fleeces are,      With the whiter wings above them and the glory-streaming star--      Guiding-star across the housetops; never fear the Shepherds felt      Till they found the Babe in manger where the kindly cattle knelt.            Oh, the Shepherds in Judea!--            Do you think the Shepherds know          How the whole round earth is brightened            In the ruddy Christmas glow?        How the sighs are lost in laughter, and the laughter brings the tears,      As the thoughts of men go seeking back across the darkling years      Till they find the wayside stable that the star-led Wise Men found,      With the Shepherds, mute, adoring, and the glory shining round!           *       *       *       *       *        CHRISTMAS CAROL        JAMES S. PARK        So crowded was the little town        On the first Christmas day,      Tired Mary Mother laid her down        To rest upon the hay.      (Ah, would my door might have been thrown        Wide open on her way!)        But when the Holy Babe was born        In the deep hush of night,      It seemed as if a Sabbath morn        Had come with sacred light.      Child Jesus made the place forlorn        With his own beauty bright.        The manger rough was all his rest;        The cattle, having fed,      Stood silent by, or closer pressed,        And gravely wondered.      (Ah, Lord, if only that my breast        Had cradled Thee instead!)           *       *       *       *       *        NEIGHBORS OF THE CHRIST NIGHT        NORA ARCHIBALD SMITH        Deep in the shelter of the cave,        The ass with drooping head      Stood weary in the shadow, where        His master's hand had led.      About the manger oxen lay,        Bending a wide-eyed gaze      Upon the little new-born Babe,        Half worship, half amaze.      High in the roof the doves were set,        And cooed there, soft and mild,      Yet not so sweet as, in the hay,        The Mother to her Child.      The gentle cows breathed fragrant breath        To keep Babe Jesus warm,      While loud and clear, o'er hill and dale,        The cocks crowed, \"Christ is born!\"      Out in the fields, beneath the stars,        The young lambs sleeping lay,      And dreamed that in the manger slept        Another white as they.                       - - - - -        These were Thy neighbors, Christmas Child;        To Thee their love was given,      For in Thy baby face there shone        The wonder-light of Heaven.           *       *       *       *       *        CRADLE HYMN        ISAAC WATTS        Hush, my dear, lie still and slumber;        Holy angels guard thy bed;      Heavenly blessings without number        Gently falling on thy head.        Sleep, my babe, thy food and raiment,        House and home, thy friends provide;      All without thy care, or payment,        All thy wants are well supplied.        How much better thou'rt attended        Than the Son of God could be,      When from heaven He descended,        And became a child like thee!        Soft and easy is thy cradle;        Coarse and hard thy Saviour lay,      When His birthplace was a stable,        And His softest bed was hay.        See the kindly shepherds round him,        Telling wonders from the sky!      When they sought Him, there they found Him,        With his Virgin-Mother by.        See the lovely babe a-dressing;        Lovely infant, how He smiled!      When He wept, the mother's blessing        Soothed and hushed the holy child.        Lo, He slumbers in His manger,        Where the honest oxen fed;      --Peace, my darling! here's no danger!        Here's no ox a-near thy bed!        Mayst thou live to know and fear Him,        Trust and love Him all thy days;      Then go dwell forever near Him,        See His face, and sing His praise!        I could give thee thousand kisses,        Hoping what I most desire;      Not a mother's fondest wishes        Can to greater joys aspire.           *       *       *       *       *        AN ODE ON THE BIRTH OF OUR              SAVIOUR        ROBERT HERRICK        In numbers, and but these few,      I sing thy birth, O Jesu!
