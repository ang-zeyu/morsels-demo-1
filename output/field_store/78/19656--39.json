That Throg ship lying wrecked at the foot of the cliff ...  perhaps he could do a little investigating before any rescue squad  arrived. Shann decided such a move was worth the try and whistled to the  wolverines.          3. TO CLOSE RANKS      Shann made his way at an angle to avoid the smoking pit cradling the  wreckage of the Terran ship. There were no signs of life about the Throg  plate as he approached. A quarter of its bulk was telescoped back into  the rest, and surely none of the aliens could have survived such a  smash, tough as they were reputed to be with those horny carapaces  serving them in place of more vulnerable human skin.    He sniffed. There was a nauseous odor heavy on the morning air, one  which would make a lasting impression on any human nose. The port door  in the black ship stood open, perhaps having burst in the impact against  the cliff. Shann had almost reached it when a crackle of chain lightning  beat across the ground before him, turning the edge of the buckled  entrance panel red.    Shann dropped to the ground, drawing his stunner, knowing at the same  moment that such a weapon was about as much use in meeting a blaster as  a straw wand would be to ward off a blazing coal. A chill numbness held  him as he waited for a second blast to charr the flesh between his  shoulders. So there had been a Throg survivor, after all.    But as moments passed and the Throg did not move in to make an easy  kill, Shann collected his wits. Only one shot! Was the beetle injured,  unable to make sure of even an almost defenseless prey? The Throgs  seldom took prisoners. When they did....    The Terran's lips tightened. He worked his hand under his prone body,  feeling for the hilt of his knife. With that he could speedily remove  himself from the status of Throg prisoner, and he would do it gladly if  there was no hope of escape. Had there been only one charge left in that  blaster? Shann could make half a dozen guesses as to why the other had  made no move, but that shot had come from behind him, and he dared not  turn his head or otherwise make an effort to see what the other might be  doing.    Was it only his imagination, or had that stench grown stronger during  the last few seconds? Could the Throg be creeping up on him? Shann  strained his ears, trying to catch some sound he could interpret. The  few clak-claks that had survived the blast about the ship were shrieking  overhead, and Shann made one attempt at counterattack.    He whistled the wolverines' call. The pair had not been too willing to  follow him down into this valley, and they had avoided the crater at a  very wide circle. But if they would obey him now, he just might have a  chance.    There! That _had_ been a sound, and the smell _was_ stronger. The Throg  must be coming to him. Again Shann whistled, holding in his mind his  hatred for the beetle-head, the need for finishing off that alien. If  the animals could pick either thoughts or emotions out of their human  companion, this was the time for him to get those unspoken half-orders  across.    Shann slammed his hand hard against the ground, sent his body rolling,  his stunner up and ready.    And now he could see that grotesque thing, swaying weakly back and forth  on its thin legs, yet holding a blaster, bringing that weapon up to  center it on him. The Throg was hunched over and perhaps to Taggi  presented the outline of some four-footed creature to be hunted. For the  wolverine male sprang for the horn-shelled shoulders.    Under that impact that Throg sagged forward. But Taggi, outraged at the  nature of creature he had attacked, squalled and retreated. Shann had  had his precious seconds of distraction. He fired, the core of the stun  beam striking full into the flat dish of the alien's \"face.\"    That bolt, which would have shocked a mammal into insensibility, only  slowed the Throg. Shann rolled again, gaining a temporary cover behind  the wrecked ship. He squirmed under metal hot enough to scorch his  jacket and saw the reflection of a second blaster shot which had been  fired seconds late.    Now the Throg had him tied down. But to get at the Terran the alien  would have to show himself, and Shann had one chance in fifty, which was  better than that of three minutes ago--when the odds had been set at one  in a hundred. He knew that he could not press the wolverines in again.  Taggi's distaste was too manifest; Shann had been lucky that the animal  had made one abortive attack.    Perhaps the Terran's escape and Taggi's action had made the alien  reckless. Shann had no clue to the thinking processes of the non-human,  but now the Throg staggered around the end of the plate, his digits,  which were closer to claws than fingers, fumbling with his weapon. The  Terran snapped another shot from his stunner, hoping to slow the enemy  down. But he was trapped. If he turned to climb the cliff at his back,  the beetle-head could easily pick him off.    A rock hurtled from the heights above, striking with deadly accuracy on  the domed, hairless head of the Throg. His armored body crashed forward,  struck against the ship, and rebounded to the ground. Shann darted  forward to seize the blaster, kicking loose the claws which still  grasped it, before he flattened back to the cliff, the strange weapon  over his arm, his heart beating wildly.    That rock had not bounded down the mountainside by chance; it had been  hurled with intent and aimed carefully at its target. And no Throg would  kill one of his fellows. Or would he? Suppose orders had been issued to  take a Terran prisoner and the Throg by the ship had disobeyed? Then,  why a rock and not a blaster bolt?    Shann edged along until the upslanted, broken side of the Throg flyer  provided him with protection from any overhead attack. Under that  shelter he waited for the next move from his unknown rescuer.    The clak-claks wheeled closer to earth. One lit boldly on the carapace  of the inert Throg, shuffling ungainly along that horny ridge. Cradling  the blaster, the Terran continued to wait. His patience was rewarded  when that investigating clak-clak took off uttering an enraged snap or  two. He heard what might be the scrape of boots across rock, but that  might also have come from horny skin meeting stone.    Then the other must have lost his footing not too far above. Accompanied  by a miniature landslide of stones and earth, a figure slid down several  yards away. Shann waited in a half-crouch, his looted blaster covering  the man now getting to his feet. There was no mistaking the familiar  uniform, or even the man. How Ragnar Thorvald had reached that  particular spot on Warlock or why, Shann could not know. But that he was  there, there was no denying.    Shann hurried forward. It had been when he caught his first sight of  Thorvald that he realized just how deep his unacknowledged loneliness  had bit. There were two Terrans on Warlock now, and he did not need to  know why. But Thorvald was staring back at him with the blankness of  non-recognition.    \"Who are you?\" The demand held something close to suspicion.    That note in the other's voice wiped away a measure of Shann's  confidence, threatened something which had flowered in him since he had  struck into the wilderness on his own. Three words had reduced him again  to Lantee, unskilled laborer.    \"Lantee. I'm from the camp....\"    Thorvald's eagerness was plain in his next question: \"How many of you  got away? Where are the rest?\" He gazed past Shann up the plateau slope  as if he expected to see the personnel of the camp sprout out of the  cloak of grass along the verge.    \"Just me and the wolverines,\" Shann answered in a colorless voice. He  cradled the blaster on his hip, turned a little away from the officer.    \"You ... and the wolverines?\" Thorvald was plainly startled. \"But ...  where? How?\"    \"The Throgs hit very early yesterday morning. They caught the rest in  camp. The wolverines had escaped from their cage, and I was out hunting  them....\" He told his story baldly.    \"You're sure about the rest?\" Thorvald had a thin steel of rage edging  his voice. Almost, Shann thought, as if he could turn that blade of rage  against one Shann Lantee for being yet alive when more important men had  not survived.    \"I saw the attack from an upper ridge,\" the younger man said, having  been put on the defensive. Yet he had a right to be alive, hadn't he? Or  did Thorvald believe that he should have gone running down to meet the  beetle-heads with his useless stunner? \"They used energy beams ...  didn't land until it was all over.\"    \"I knew there was something wrong when the camp didn't answer our  enter-atmosphere signal,\" Thorvald said absently. \"Then one of those  platters jumped us on braking orbit, and my pilot was killed. When we  set down on the automatics here I had just time to rig a surprise for  any trackers before I took to the hills----\"    \"The blast got one of them,\" Shann pointed out.    \"Yes, they'd nicked the booster rocket; she wouldn't climb again. But  they'll be back here to pick over the remains.\"    Shann looked at the dead Throg. \"Thanks for taking a hand.\" His tone was  as chill as the other's this time. \"I'm heading south....\"    And, he added silently, I intend to keep on that way. The Throg attack  had dissolved the pattern of the Survey team. He didn't owe Thorvald any  allegiance. And he had been successfully on his own here since the camp  had been overrun.    \"South,\" Thorvald repeated. \"Well, that's as good a direction as any  right now.\"    But they were not united. Shann found the wolverines and patiently  coaxed and wheedled them into coming with him over a circuitous route  which kept them away from both ships. Thorvald went up the cliff, swung  down again, a supply bag slung over one shoulder. He stood watching as  Shann brought the animals in.    Then Thorvald's arm swept out, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20796"],[0,"The Colors of Space (#5)"],[1,"out to David Warren  Briscoe, of Aldebaran Four. According to them, David Briscoe was twenty  years old, hair black, eyes hazel, height six foot one inch. Bart  wondered, painfully, if Briscoe had a son and if David Briscoe knew  where his father was. There was also a license, validated with four runs  on the Aldebaran Intrasatellite Cargo Company--planetary ships--with the  rank of Apprentice Astrogator; and a considerable sum of money.    Bart put the papers in his pants pocket and the torn-up scraps of his  old ones into the trashbin before he realized that they looked exactly  like what they were--torn-up legal identity papers and a broken plastic  card. _Nobody_ destroyed identity papers for any good reason. What could  he do?    Then he remembered something from the Academy. Starships were  closed-system cycles, no waste was discarded, but everything was  collected in big chemical tanks, broken down to separate elements,  purified and built up again into new materials. He threw the paper into  the toilet, worked the plastic card back and forth, back and forth until  he had wrenched it into inch-wide bits, and threw it after them.    The cabin door opened and a Mentorian said irritably, \"Please lie down  and fasten your straps. I haven't all day.\"    Hastily Bart flushed the toilet and went to the bunk. Now everything  that could identify him as Bart Steele was on its way to the breakdown  tanks. Before long, the complex hydrocarbons and cellulose would all be  innocent little molecules of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen; they might turn  up in new combinations as sugar on the table!    The Mentorian grumbled, \"You young people think the rules mean everybody  but you,\" and strapped him far too tightly into the bunk. Bart felt  resentful; just because Mentorians could work on Lhari ships, did they  have to act as if they owned everybody?    When the man had gone, Bart drew a deep breath. Was he really doing the  right thing?    If he'd refused to get out of the robotcab--    If he'd driven Briscoe straight to the police--    Then maybe Briscoe would still be alive. And now it was too late.    A warning siren went off in the ship, rising to hysterical intensity.  Bart thought, incredulously, _this is really happening_. It felt like a  nightmare. His father a fugitive from the Lhari. Briscoe dead. He  himself traveling, with forged papers, to a star he'd never seen.    He braced himself, knowing the siren was the last warning before  takeoff. First there would be the hum of great turbines deep in the  ship, then the crushing surge of acceleration. He had made a dozen trips  inside the solar system, but no matter how often he did it, there was  the strange excitement, the little pinpoint of fear, like an exotic  taste, that was almost pleasant.    The door opened and Bart grabbed a fistful of bed-ticking as two Lhari  came into the room.    One of them said, in their strange shrill speech, \"This boy is the right  age.\"    Bart froze.    \"You're seeing spies in every corner, Ransell,\" said the other, then in  Universal, \"Could we trrouble you for your paperesses, sirr?\"    Bart, strapped down and helpless, moved his head toward the drawer,  hoping his face did not betray his fear. He watched the two Lhari riffle  through his papers with their odd pointed claws.    \"What isss your planet?\"    Bart bit his lip, hard--he had almost said, \"Vega Four.\"    \"Aldebaran Four.\"    The Lhari said in his own language, \"We should have Margil in here. He  actually saw them.\"    The other replied, \"But I saw the machine that disintegrated. I still  say there was enough protoplasm residue for two bodies.\"    Bart fought to keep his face perfectly straight.    \"Did anyone come into your cabin?\" The Lhari asked in Universal.    \"Only the steward. Why? Is something wrong?\"    \"There iss some thought that a stowaway might be on boarrd. Of courrrse  we could not allow that, anyone not prrroperly prrotected would die in  the first shift into warp-drive.\"    \"Just the steward,\" Bart said again. \"A Mentorian.\"    The Lhari said, eying him keenly, \"You are ill? Or discommoded?\"    Bart grasped at random for an excuse. \"That--that stuff the medic made  me drink made me feel--sort of sick.\"    \"You may send for a medical officer after acceleration,\" said the Lhari  expressionlessly. \"The summoning bell is at your left.\"    They turned and went out and Bart gulped. Lhari, in person, checking the  passenger decks! Normally you never saw one on board; just Mentorians.  The Lhari treated humans as if they were too dumb to bother about. Well,  at least for once someone was acting as if humans were worthy  antagonists. _We'll show them--someday!_    But he felt very alone, and scared....    A low hum rose, somewhere in the ship, and Bart grabbed ticking as he  felt the slow surge. Then a violent sense of pressure popped his ear  drums, weight crowded down on him like an elephant sitting on his chest,  and there was a horrible squashed sensation dragging his limbs out of  shape. It grew and grew. Bart lay still and sweated, trying to ease his  uncomfortable position, unable to move so much as a finger. The Lhari  ships hit 12 gravities in the first surge of acceleration. Bart felt as  if he were spreading out, under the weight, into a puddle of  flesh--_melted flesh like Briscoe's_--    Bart writhed and bit his lip till he could taste blood, wishing he were  young enough to bawl out loud.    Abruptly, it eased, and the blood started to flow again in his numbed  limbs. Bart loosened his straps, took a few deep breaths, wiped his  face--wringing wet, whether with sweat or tears he wasn't sure--and sat  up in his bunk. The loudspeaker announced, \"Acceleration One is  completed. Passengers on A and B Decks are invited to witness the  passing of the Satellites from the Observation Lounge in half an hour.\"    Bart got up and washed his face, remembering that he had no luggage with  him, not so much as a toothbrush.    At the back of his mind, packed up in a corner, was the continuing worry  about his father, the horror at Briscoe's ghastly death, the fear of the  Lhari; but he slammed the lid firmly on them all. For the moment he was  safe. They might be looking for Bart Steele by now, but they weren't  looking for David Briscoe of Aldebaran. He might just as well relax and  enjoy the trip. He went down to the Observation Lounge.    It had been darkened, and one whole wall of the room was made of clear  quartzite. Bart drew a deep breath as the vast panorama of space opened  out before him.    They were receding from the sun at some thousands of miles a minute.  Swirling past the ship, gleaming in the reflected sunlight like iron  filings moving to the motion of a magnet, were the waves upon waves of  cosmic dust--tiny free electrons, ions, particles of gas; free of the  heavier atmosphere, themselves invisible, they formed in their billions  into bright clouds around the ship; pale, swirling veils of mist. And  through their dim shine, the brilliant flares of the fixed stars burned  clear and steady, so far away that even the hurling motion of the ship  could not change their positions.    One by one he picked out the constellations. Aldebaran swung on the  pendant chain of Taurus like a giant ruby. Orion strode across the sky,  a swirling nebula at his belt. Vega burned, cobalt blue, in the heart of  the Lyre.    Colors, colors! Inside the atmosphere of Earth's night, the stars had  been pale white sparks against black. Here, against the misty-pale  swirls of cosmic dust, they burned with color heaped on color; the  bloody burning crimson of Antares, the metallic gold of Capella, the  sullen pulsing of Betelgeuse. They burned, each with its own inward  flame and light, like handfuls of burning jewels flung by some giant  hand upon the swirling darkness. It was a sight Bart felt he could watch  forever and still be hungry to see; the never-changing, ever-changing  colors of space.           *       *       *       *       *    Behind him in the darkness, after a long time, someone said softly,  \"Imagine being a Lhari and not being able to see anything out there but  bright or brighter light.\"    A bell rang melodiously in the ship and the passengers in the lounge  began to stir and move toward the door, to stretch limbs cramped like  Bart's by tranced watching, to talk quickly of ordinary things.    \"I suppose that bell means dinner,\" said a vaguely familiar voice at  Bart's elbow. \"Synthetics, I suppose, but at least we can all get  acquainted.\"    The light from the undarkened hall fell on their faces as they moved  toward the door. \"Bart! Why, it can't be!\"    In utter dismay, Bart looked down into the face of Tommy Kendron.    In the rush of danger, he had absolutely forgotten that Tommy Kendron  was on this ship--to make his alias useless; Tommy was looking at him in  surprise and delight.    \"Why didn't you tell me, or did you and your father decide at the last  minute? Hey, it's great that we can go part way together, at least!\"    Bart knew he must cut this short very quickly. He stepped out into the  full corridor light so that Tommy could see his black hair.    \"I'm sorry, you're confusing me with someone else.\"    \"Bart, come off it--\" Tommy's voice died out. \"Sorry, I'd have sworn you  were a friend of mine.\"    Bart wondered suddenly, had he done the wrong thing? He had a feeling he  might need a friend. Badly.    Well, it was too late now. He stared Tommy in the eye and said, \"I've  never seen you before in my life.\"    Tommy looked deflated. He stepped back slightly, shaking his head.  \"Never saw such a resemblance. Are you a Vegan?\"    \"No,\" Bart lied flatly. \"Aldebaran. David Briscoe.\"    \"Glad to know you, Dave.\" With undiscourageable friendliness, Tommy  stuck out a hand. \"Say, that bell means dinner, why don't we go down  together? I don't know a soul on the ship, and it looks like  luck--running into a fellow who could be my best"]]]
