The upper  scene engraved upon the stele represents Abba and his wife in the  presence of Osiris, who is attended by Isis and Nephthys; and in the  lower panel is the funeral scene, in which all the mourners with  one exception are Asiatics. Certain details of the rites that are  represented, and mistakes in the hieroglyphic version of the text, prove  that the work is Aramaean throughout.(3)         (1) It may be admitted that the Greek platonized cult of       Isis and Osiris had its origin in the fusion of Greeks and       Egyptians which took place in Ptolemaic times (cf. Scott-       Moncrieff, _Paganism and Christianity in Egypt_, p. 33 f.).       But we may assume that already in the Persian period the       Osiris cult had begun to acquire a tinge of mysticism,       which, though it did not affect the mechanical reproduction       of the native texts, appealed to the Oriental mind as well       as to certain elements in Greek religion. Persian influence       probably prepared the way for the Platonic exegesis of the       Osiris and Isis legends which we find in Plutarch; and the       latter may have been in great measure a development, and       not, as is often assumed, a complete misunderstanding of the       later Egyptian cult.         (2) _C.I.S._, II. i, tab. XI, No. 122.         (3) A very similar monument is the Carpentras Stele       (_C.I.S._, II., i, tab. XIII, No. 141), commemorating Taba,       daughter of Tahapi, an Aramaean lady who was also a convert       to Osiris. It is rather later than that of Abba and his       wife, since the Aramaic characters are transitional from the       archaic to the square alphabet; see Driver, _Notes on the       Hebrew Text of the Books of Samuel_, pp. xviii ff., and       Cooke, _North Semitic Inscriptions_, p. 205 f. The Vatican       Stele (op. cit. tab. XIV. No. 142), which dates from the       fourth century, represents inferior work.    If our examples of Semitic art were confined to the Persian and later  periods, they could only be employed to throw light on their own  epoch, when through communication had been organized, and there was  consequently a certain pooling of commercial and artistic products  throughout the empire.(1) It is true that under the Great King the  various petty states and provinces were encouraged to manage their own  affairs so long as they paid the required tribute, but their horizon  naturally expanded with increase of commerce and the necessity for  service in the king's armies. At this time Aramaic was the speech of  Syria, and the population, especially in the cities, was still  largely Aramaean. As early as the thirteenth century sections of this  interesting Semitic race had begun to press into Northern Syria from  the middle Euphrates, and they absorbed not only the old Canaanite  population but also the Hittite immigrants from Cappadocia. The latter  indeed may for a time have furnished rulers to the vigorous North Syrian  principalities which resulted from this racial combination, but the  Aramaean element, thanks to continual reinforcement, was numerically  dominant, and their art may legitimately be regarded as in great measure  a Semitic product. Fortunately we have recovered examples of sculpture  which prove that tendencies already noted in the Persian period were  at work, though in a minor degree, under the later Assyrian empire.  The discoveries made at Zenjirli, for example, illustrate the gradually  increasing effect of Assyrian influence upon the artistic output of a  small North Syrian state.         (1) Cf. Bevan, _House of Seleucus_, Vol. I, pp. 5, 260 f.       The artistic influence of Mesopotamia was even more widely       spread than that of Egypt during the Persian period. This is       suggested, for example, by the famous lion-weight discovered       at Abydos in Mysia, the town on the Hellespont famed for the       loves of Hero and Leander. The letters of its Aramaic       inscription (_C.I.S._, II. i, tab. VII, No. 108) prove by       their form that it dates from the Persian period, and its       provenance is sufficiently attested. Its weight moreover       suggests that it was not merely a Babylonian or Persian       importation, but cast for local use, yet in design and       technique it is scarcely distinguishable from the best       Assyrian work of the seventh century.    This village in north-western Syria, on the road between Antioch and  Mar'ash, marks the site of a town which lay near the southern border or  just within the Syrian district of Sam'al. The latter is first mentioned  in the Assyrian inscriptions by Shalmaneser III, the son and successor  of the great conqueror, Ashur-nasir-pal; and in the first half of the  eighth century, though within the radius of Assyrian influence, it was  still an independent kingdom. It is to this period that we must assign  the earliest of the inscribed monuments discovered at Zenjirli and  its neighbourhood. At Gerjin, not far to the north-west, was found  the colossal statue of Hadad, chief god of the Aramaeans, which was  fashioned and set up in his honour by Panammu I, son of Qaral and king  of Ya'di.(1) In the long Aramaic inscription engraved upon the statue  Panammu records the prosperity of his reign, which he ascribes to the  support he has received from Hadad and his other gods, El, Reshef,  Rekub-el, and Shamash. He had evidently been left in peace by Assyria,  and the monument he erected to his god is of Aramaean workmanship and  design. But the influence of Assyria may be traced in Hadad's beard  and in his horned head-dress, modelled on that worn by Babylonian and  Assyrian gods as the symbol of divine power.         (1) See F. von Luschan, _Sendschirli_, I. (1893), pp. 49       ff., pl. vi; and cf. Cooke, _North Sem. Inscr._, pp. 159 ff.       The characters of the inscription on the statue are of the       same archaic type as those of the Moabite Stone, though       unlike them they are engraved in relief; so too are the       inscriptions of Panammu's later successor Bar-rekub (see       below). Gerjin was certainly in Ya'di, and Winckler's       suggestion that Zenjirli itself also lay in that district       but near the border of Sam'al may be provisionally accepted;       the occurrence of the names in the inscriptions can be       explained in more than one way (see Cooke, op. cit., p.       183).    The political changes introduced into Ya'di and Sam'al by  Tiglath-pileser IV are reflected in the inscriptions and monuments of  Bar-rekub, a later king of the district. Internal strife had brought  disaster upon Ya'di and the throne had been secured by Panammu II, son  of Bar-sur, whose claims received Assyrian support. In the words of  his son Bar-rekub, \"he laid hold of the skirt of his lord, the king of  Assyria\", who was gracious to him; and it was probably at this time, and  as a reward for his loyalty, that Ya'di was united with the neighbouring  district of Sam'al. But Panammu's devotion to his foreign master led to  his death, for he died at the siege of Damascus, in 733 or 732 B.C., \"in  the camp, while following his lord, Tiglath-pileser, king of Assyria\".  His kinsfolk and the whole camp bewailed him, and his body was sent  back to Ya'di, where it was interred by his son, who set up an inscribed  statue to his memory. Bar-rekub followed in his father's footsteps, as  he leads us to infer in his palace-inscription found at Zenjirli: \"I  ran at the wheel of my lord, the king of Assyria, in the midst of mighty  kings, possessors of silver and possessors of gold.\" It is not strange  therefore that his art should reflect Assyrian influence far more  strikingly than that of Panammu I. The figure of himself which he caused  to be carved in relief on the left side of the palace-inscription is  in the Assyrian style,(1) and so too is another of his reliefs from  Zenjirli. On the latter Bar-rekub is represented seated upon his throne  with eunuch and scribe in attendance, while in the field is the emblem  of full moon and crescent, here ascribed to \"Ba'al of Harran\", the  famous centre of moon-worship in Northern Mesopotamia.(2)         (1) _Sendschirli_, IV (1911), pl. lxvii. Attitude and       treatment of robes are both Assyrian, and so is the       arrangement of divine symbols in the upper field, though       some of the latter are given under unfamiliar forms. The       king's close-fitting peaked cap was evidently the royal       headdress of Sam'al; see the royal figure on a smaller stele       of inferior design, op. cit., pl. lxvi.         (2) Op. cit. pp. 257, 346 ff., and pl. lx. The general style       of the sculpture and much of the detail are obviously       Assyrian. Assyrian influence is particularly noticeable in       Bar-rekub's throne; the details of its decoration are       precisely similar to those of an Assyrian bronze throne in       the British Museum. The full moon and crescent are not of       the familiar form, but are mounted on a standard with       tassels.    The detailed history and artistic development of Sam'al and Ya'di convey  a very vivid impression of the social and material effects upon the  native population of Syria, which followed the westward advance of  Assyria in the eighth century. We realize not only the readiness of  one party in the state to defeat its rival with the help of Assyrian  support, but also the manner in which the life and activities of the  nation as a whole were unavoidably affected by their action. Other  Hittite-Aramaean and Phoenician monuments, as yet undocumented with  literary records, exhibit a strange but not unpleasing mixture of  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20300"],[0,"Henry VIII.

Prince Arthur died on 2nd April, 1502, and was buried in princely  state in Worcester Cathedral.                       [Footnote 30: _L. and P._, _Henry VII._, i.,                     413-415; _L. and P._, _Henry VIII._, iv., 5791.]          CHAPTER II.                                                        (p. 015)    PRINCE HENRY AND HIS ENVIRONMENT.      The Prince, who now succeeded to the position of heir-apparent, was  nearly five years younger than his brother. The third child and second  son of his parents, he was born on 28th June, 1491, at Greenwich, a  palace henceforth intimately associated with the history of Tudor  sovereigns. The manor of Greenwich had belonged to the alien priory of  Lewisham, and, on the dissolution of those houses, had passed into the  hands of Henry IV. Then it was granted to Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester,  who began to enclose the palace grounds; on his death it reverted to  the Crown; and Edward IV., many of whose tastes and characteristics  were inherited by his grandson, Henry VIII., took great delight in  beautifying and extending the palace. He gave it to his Queen,  Elizabeth, and in her possession it remained until her sympathy with  Yorkist plots was punished by the forfeiture of her lands. Henry VII.  then bestowed it on his wife, the dowager's daughter, and thus it  became the birthplace of her younger children. Here was the scene of  many a joust and tournament, of many a masque and revel; here the  young Henry, as soon as he came to the throne, was wedded to Catherine  of Aragon; here Henry's sister was married to the Duke of Suffolk; and  here were born all future Tudor sovereigns, Edward VI., Mary,      (p. 016)  and Elizabeth. At Greenwich, then, through the forfeit of his  grandmother, Henry was born; he was baptised in the Church of the  Observant Friars, an Order, the object first of his special favour,[31]  and then of an equally marked dislike; the ceremony was performed by  Richard Fox,[32] then Bishop of Exeter, and afterwards one of the  child's chief advisers. His nurse was named Ann Luke, and years  afterwards, when Henry was King, he allowed her the annual pension of  twenty pounds, equivalent to about three hundred in modern currency.  The details of his early life are few and far between. Lord Herbert,  who wrote his _Life and Reign_ a century later, records that the young  Prince was destined by his father for the see of Canterbury,[33] and  provided with an education more suited to a clerical than to a lay  career. The motive ascribed to Henry VII. is typical of his character;  it was more economical to provide for younger sons out of ecclesiastical,  than royal, revenues. But the story is probably a mere inference from  the excellence of the boy's education, and from his father's thrift.  If the idea of an ecclesiastical career for young Henry was ever  entertained, it was soon abandoned for secular preferment. On 5th  April, 1492, before the child was ten months old, he was appointed to  the ancient and important posts of Warden of the Cinque Ports and  Constable of Dover Castle.[34] A little later he received the still  more honourable office of Earl Marshal; the duties were performed by  deputy, but a goodly portion of the fees was doubtless             (p. 017)  appropriated for the expenses of the boy's establishment, or found its  way into the royal coffers. Further promotion awaited him at the  mature age of three. On 12th September, 1494, he became Lord-Lieutenant  of Ireland;[35] six weeks later he was created Duke of York, and  dubbed, with the usual quaint and formal ceremonies,[36] a Knight of  the Bath. In December, he was made Warden of the Scottish Marches, and  he was invested with the Garter in the following May.[37]                       [Footnote 31: _L. and P._, i., 4871.]                       [Footnote 32: Fox's own statement, _L. and P._,                     iv., 5791.]                       [Footnote 33: Herbert gives Paolo Sarpi as his                     authority.]                       [Footnote 34: G.E.C [okayne], _Complete Peerage_,                     _s.v._ Cornwall.]                       [Footnote 35: _L. and P._, _Henry VII._, Rolls                     Ser., ii., 374.]                       [Footnote 36: _Ib._, i., 388-404; _Paston Letters_,                     iii., 384-85.]                       [Footnote 37: _L. and P._, _Henry VII._, ii., 57.]    The accumulation of these great offices of State, any one of which  might have taxed the powers of a tried administrator, in the feeble  hands of a child appears at first sight a trifle irrational; but there  was always method in Henry's madness. In bestowing these administrative  posts upon his children he was really concentrating them in his own  person and bringing them directly under his own supervision. It was  the policy whereby the early Roman Emperors imposed upon Republican  Rome the substance, without the form, of despotism. It limited the  powers of mischief which Henry's nobles might otherwise have enjoyed,  and provided incomes for his children without increasing taxation or  diminishing the privy purse. The work of administration could be done  at least as effectively, much more economically, and with far less  danger to internal peace by deputies of lower rank than the dukes and  earls and barons who had been wont to abuse these high positions for  the furtherance of private ends, and often for the levying of      (p. 018)  private war. Nowhere were the advantages of Henry's policy more  conspicuous than in his arrangements for the government of Ireland.  Ever since Richard, Duke of York, and George, Duke of Clarence, had  ruled as Irish viceroys, Ireland had been a Yorkist stronghold. There  Simnel had been crowned king, and there peers and peasants had fought  for Perkin Warbeck. Something must be done to heal the running sore.  Possibly Henry thought that some of Ireland's loyalty might be  diverted from Yorkist channels by the selection of a Tudor prince as  its viceroy; but he put his trust in more solid measures. As deputy to  his infant son he nominated one who, though but a knight, was perhaps  the ablest man among his privy council. It was in this capacity that  Sir Edward Poynings[38] crossed to Ireland about the close of 1494,  and called the Parliament of Drogheda. Judged by the durability of its  legislation, it was one of the most memorable of parliaments; and for  nearly three hundred years Poynings' laws remained the foundation upon  which rested the constitutional relations between the sister kingdoms.  Even more lasting was the precedent set by Prince Henry's creation as  Duke of York; from that day to this, from Henry VIII. to the present  Prince of Wales, the second son of the sovereign or of the heir-apparent  has almost invariably been invested with that dukedom.[39] The original  selection of the title was due to substantial reasons. Henry's name  was distinctively Lancastrian, his title was no less distinctively  Yorkist; it was adopted as a concession to Yorkist prejudice.      (p. 019)  It was a practical reminder of the fact which the Tudor laureate,  Skelton, celebrated in song: \"The rose both red and white, in one rose  now doth grow\". It was also a tacit assertion of the death of the last  Duke of York in the Tower and of the imposture of Perkin Warbeck, now  pretending to the title.                       [Footnote 38: See the present writer in _D.N.B._,                     xlvi., 271.]                       [Footnote 39: An exception was made in the case of                     the late Duke of Edinburgh. It was designed if                     Henry VIII. had a second son, to make him Duke of                     York (_L. and P._, vii., 1364).]    But thoughts of the coercion of Ireland and conciliation of Yorkists  were as yet far from the mind of the child, round whose person these  measures were made to centre. Precocious he must have been, if the  phenomenal development of brow and the curiously mature expression  attributed to him in his portrait[40] are any indication of his  intellectual powers at the age at which he is represented. Without the  childish lips and nose, the face might well be that of a man of fifty;  and with the addition of a beard, the portrait would be an unmistakable  likeness of Henry himself in his later years. When the Prince was no  more than a child, says Erasmus, he was set to study.[41] He had, we  are told, a vivid and active mind, above measure able to execute  whatever tasks he undertook; and he never attempted anything in which  he did not succeed.[42] The Tudors had no modern dread of educational  over-pressure when applied to their children, and the young Henry was  probably as forward a pupil as his son, Edward VI., his daughter,  Elizabeth, or his grand-niece, Lady Jane Grey. But, fortunately for  Henry, a physical exuberance corrected his mental precocity; and,  (p. 020)  as he grew older, any excessive devotion to the Muses was checked by  an unwearied pursuit of bodily culture. He was the first of English  sovereigns to be educated under the new influence of the Renaissance.  Scholars, divines and poets thronged the Court of Henry VII. Margaret  Beaufort, who ruled in Henry's household, was a signal benefactor to  the cause of English learning. Lady Margaret professors commemorate  her name in both our ancient universities, and in their bidding prayers  she is to this day remembered. Two colleges at Cambridge revere her as  their foundress; Caxton, the greatest of English printers, owed much  to her munificence, and she herself translated into English books from  both Latin and French. Henry VII., though less accomplished that the  later Tudors, evinced an intelligent interest in art and letters, and  provided for his children efficient instructors; while his Queen,  Elizabeth of York, is"]]]
