Lebel, and I am  certain he has gone away deeply smitten.\"    \"I hope we shall see him again,\" said comte Jean.    \"Do you doubt it?\"    \"Assure him,\" said I, \"of the pleasure it will afford us to receive him  as he merits.\"    Several persons entered, and M. Morand, profiting by the bustle which  their entrance occasioned, approached me, and said, in a low tone,    \"You are in possession of his heart, will you charge me with any message  to him?\"    \"M. Morand,\" was my reply, \"what are you thinking of? A woman of my rank  throw herself at any person's head?\"    \"No, certainly not; but you can send him a kind word, or some  affectionate token.\"    \"I could not think of it; M. Lebel appeared to me a most agreeable man,  and I shall be at all times delighted to see him.\"    Morand asked nothing more than this, and there our conversation ended.    Two days elapsed without being marked by any event. Comte Jean had  spent them with much anxiety. He was absent, when, on the third morning,  Henriette came hastily into my room. \"Madame,\" she said, \"the _valet de  chambre_ of the king is in the drawing-room, and inquires if you will  receive him.\"    At this news I was surprised and vexed. M. Lebel took me unawares; my  toilette was not begun. I gave a hasty glance at my mirror, \"Let M.  Lebel come in\"; and M. Lebel, who was on the heels of my maid, entered  instantly. After having saluted me, he said,    \"It is only you, Madame, whom one might thus surprise. Your beauty needs  no ornament, your charms are decoration sufficient.\"    I replied to this compliment with (of course) much modesty, according  to custom. We entered into conversation, and I found that Lebel  really thought me the sister-in-law of comte Jean; and I remarked the  involuntary respect that attended even his familiarity. I left him in  his error, which was material to my interests. He talked to me some time  of my attractions, of the part which a female like myself might assume  in France. But fearing to compromise myself, I made no reply, but  preserved the reserve which my character imposed upon me. I am not  clever, my friend, I never could conduct an intrigue: I feared to speak  or do wrong; and whilst I kept a tranquil appearance, I was internally  agitated at the absence of comte Jean.    Fortune sent him to me. He was passing the street, when he saw at our  door a carriage with the royal livery. Lebel always used it when his  affairs did not demand a positive incognito. This equipage made him  suspect a visit from Lebel, and he came in opportunely to extricate me  from my embarrassment.    \"Sir,\" said Lebel to him, when he entered, \"here is the lady whose  extreme modesty refuses to listen to what I dare not thus explain to  her.\"    \"Is it anything I may hear for her?\" said the comte, with a smiling air.    \"Yes, I am the ambassador of a mighty power: you are the minister  plenipotentiary of the lady, and with your leave, we will go into your  private room to discuss the articles of the secret treaty which I have  been charged to propose to you. What says madame?\"    \"I consent to anything that may come from such an ambassador.\"    Comte Jean instantly led him into another room, and when they were  alone, Lebel said to him, \"Do you know that your sister-in-law is a most  fascinating creature? She has occupied my thoughts since I have known  her, and in my enthusiasm I could not help speaking of her in a certain  quarter. So highly have I eulogized her, that his majesty desires an  interview with her, that he may judge with his own eyes if I am an  appreciator of beauty.\"    At these words comte Jean felt a momentary agitation, but soon  recovering himself, he replied:    \"I am exceedingly obliged to you, sir, for the favorable disposition  you have evinced towards the comtesse du Barry. She and I have as much  respect as love for his majesty; but my sister-in-law has not been  presented, and, consequently, I can scarcely see how she can be allowed  to pay her respects to his majesty.\"    \"Do not let that disturb you; it is not intended that she shall go  and partake of the magnificence of Versailles, but be admitted to  an intimacy much more flattering. Would you refuse to grant him that  pleasure?\"    \"It would be a crime of _lese-majeste _,\" said the comte Jean, laughing,  \"and my family have too much respect for their monarch. We should not be  content with a fugitive favor.\"    \"You may expect everything from the charms of the comtesse; I am  certain they will have the utmost success; but for me, I can give you no  guarantee. You must run the chance.\"    \"Your protection, however, is the only thing which encourages my  sister-in-law in this affair. But tell me when is this meeting to take  place?\"    \"Instantly. The king is impatient to see the comtesse and I have  promised that she will sup with him to-morrow evening in my apartment at  Versailles.\"    \"How is she to be introduced to the king?\"    \"I am to entertain four of my friends.\"    \"Who are they?\"    \"'First, the baron de Gonesse.\"    \"Who is he?\"    \"The king himself.\"    \"Well, who next?\"    \"The duc de Richelieu.\"    \"Who else?\"    \"The marquis de Chauvelin.\"    \"Well?\"    \"The duc de la Vauguyon.\"    \"What, the devotee?\"    \"The hypocrite. But never mind: the main point is, that you must not  appear to recognize the king. Instruct your sister-in-law to this  effect.\"    \"Certainly; if she must sin, she had better do so with some reason.\"    While these gentlemen were thus disposing of me, what was I doing?  Alone, in my room, I waited the result of their conference with mortal  impatience. The character I had to play was a superb one, and at the  moment was about to enter on the stage, I felt all the difficulties  of my part. I feared I should not succeed, but fail amid the insulting  hisses of the Versailles party.    My fears at once disappeared, and then I pictured myself sitting on  a throne, magnificently attired; my imagination wandered in all the  enchantments of greatness;--then, as if from remorse, I recalled my past  life. The former lover of Nicholas blushed before the future mistress of  Louis XV. A thousand different reflections crowded upon me, and mingled  in my brain. If to live is to think, I lived a whole age in one quarter  of an hour. At length I heard some doors open, a carriage rolled away,  and comte Jean entered my chamber.    \"Victory!\" cried he, embracing me with transport. \"Victory! my dear  Jeanne, to-morrow you sup with the king.\"    On this information I turned pale, my strength forsook me, and I was  compelled to sit down, or rather to fall into a chair; for, according  to Jean Jacques Rousseau, my legs shook under me (_flageolaient_). This,  however, was the only movement of weakness which I betrayed. When I  recovered a little, the comte Jean told me the conversation he had had  with Lebel. I joked about the title of baron de Gonesse, and I promised  to treat the king as if ignorant of his incognito. One thing only made  me uneasy, and that was supping with the duc de Richelieu, who had  seen me before at madame de Lagarde's; but the idea that he would not  remember me gave me renewed courage.    On so important an occasion, comte Jean did not forget to repeat his  instructions over again. These are nearly his words, for I think I  learnt them by heart.    \"Remember that it is on your first interview that your safety depends.  Let him learn, through you, those utter tendernesses which have been  sought for him in vain heretofore. He is like the monarch of old, who  was willing to pay the half of his crown for an unknown pleasure. Lebel  is wearied in seeking every week for new fruit. He is quite disposed  to serve you, and will second you in the best manner. You are about  to become the centre of attraction to all courtiers, and noble  _courtisanes_. You must expect that they will endeavor to cry you down,  because you will have carried off from them a gem to which every family  has its pretensions. You must at first stand firmly before the storm,  but afterward you will find all enlist themselves under your banner, who  have no wife, sister, nor daughter; that is, all who have no mistress to  offer to the king. You must attach these to you by place and favor: they  must be first thought of, and then you must think of yourself and me, my  dear girl.\"    \"All this is well enough,\" I replied, \"but as yet I am nothing.\"    \"_Morbleu_! to-morrow you will be everything,\" cried comte Jean, with  his determined energy. \"But we must think about this morrow. Make haste,  noble comtesse; go to all the milliners, seek what is elegant rather  than what is rich. Be as lovely, pleasing, and gay as possible; this is  the main point, and God will do all the rest.\"    He pronounced this blasphemy in a laughing tone, and I confess I could  not help joining in the laugh, and then hastened to comply with his  directions.

The sea upon which, trusting to the favorable influence  of my leading star, we were about to venture, was filled with rocks and  shoals which threatened the poor mariner who should direct his bark near  them. In the first place, I had to dread my obscure birth, as well as  the manner in which my life had been passed; and still more had I to  fear the indifferent reputation of comte Jean. There was more than  sufficient in all this to disturb a head far stronger than I could  boast. However, thanks to my thoughtfulness, no troublesome thoughts  interfered to break my rest on the night"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20839"],[0,"The Mountain Chant, A Navajo Ceremony (#5)"],[1,"him to tell the truth and speak quickly,  reminding him that he was a prisoner whose life was in the hands of his  captors and telling him that if he did not disclose the use of his mask  and robe he would be killed before sunset, while if he revealed the  secret his life would be spared. He pondered but a short time over their  words and determined to tell them the truth. So he explained to them the  use of the mask and the robe in deceiving the deer and told the  wonderful power he had of getting game by shooting into certain bushes.  At dark they sent in two young men to be initiated into his mysteries.  He began by giving them a full account of all his father had done and  all he had shown him; he then taught them how to build the sweat-house,  how to make the mask, how to shoot the pluck, and how to walk like a  deer, and he made them practice the walk and the motions of the animal.  All this occupied eleven days.    29. On the twelfth day the Ute went out to hunt, leaving few men in  camp. There was a small inclosure of brushwood close to the tent; in it  were two high poles on which skins were dressed. His master left him,  that day, two skins to prepare, and he set to work at them and labored  hard scraping and rubbing them until about noon, when he felt hungry and  went into the tent to see if he could find anything to eat. He opened a  bag and found it to contain dried meat; he put some of this on the coals  and sat down to wait till it was done. As he watched the meat cooking he  heard a noise at the deer skin door of the tent and, looking up, he  beheld an old woman crawling in on her hands and knees. She passed once  around the fire and went out at the door again, but before she  disappeared she turned her head and addressed him, saying: \"My  grandchild, do something for yourself.\" He paused a moment in wonder at  the strange vision he had seen and the strange words he had heard, and  then he rushed out of the tent to follow his visitor and see who she  might be. He went around the tent four times; he gazed in every  direction; but no one was to be seen. During the rest of the day he  worked but little. Occasionally he took up a stone and rubbed the hides;  but most of the time he walked and loitered around, busy with his  thoughts.    30. After sunrise the hunters returned with an abundance of meat. They  came to the great lodge where the master of the Navajo dwelt; they  extended its circumference by removing the pegs at the bottom; they  stored the goods of the owner away at the outer edge, so as to leave a  clear space in the center, and made everything ready for the reception  of a large number of guests. After dark a great number gathered in the  tent and the captive was ordered by his master to bring some water. He  took two wicker bottles to a neighboring spring, filled them, and laid  them on the ground beside the spring, while he went to gather some  plants to stick into the mouths of the bottles as stopples. As he went  he heard a voice saying \"Hist!\" and looking in the direction whence it  came he saw a form sitting in the water; it wore a mask like the head of  a great owl and it was smoking a pipe. When he turned towards it, it  said, \"You walk around like one without sense or knowledge. Why don't  you do something for yourself? When next you hear my voice it will be  well for you if you walk towards it.\"    31. The voice ceased and the form of the owl-man vanished. Then the  Navajo put the stopples into the vessels and carried them back. When he  returned he observed that two large dogs were tied to the door, one on  each side, and that three doors had been added to the lodge during his  absence, so that now there were four doors covering the doorway. When he  entered he found the lodge filled with Ute and he saw four bags of  tobacco and four pipes lying near the fire, one at each cardinal point  of the compass. He observed a very old man and a very old woman seated  at the door, one on each side. A cord tied to the old woman passed round  the edge of the lodge on one side, behind the spectators, to the west,  and another cord, tied to the man, passed round on the opposite side of  the lodge. His master bade him sit down in the west, and when he was  seated one of the cords was tied to his wrists and one to his ankles,  and thus he was secured to the old pair.      [Illustration: FIG. 50.    QastcÃ¨Ã«lÃ§i, from a dry painting of the klÃ¨dji-qaÃ§Ã l.]    32. Now he feared more than ever for his safety; he felt sure that his  captors contemplated his death by torture. The pipes were lit and the  council began. The talking in the strange tongue that he could not  understand had lasted long into the night, when he fancied that he heard  the voice of the YÃ¨bitcai (Anglicized, YÃ y-bi-chy or Gay-bi chy) above  the din of human voices, saying \"hu`hu`hu`hu\" in the far distance. He  strained his attention and listened well, and after a while he felt  certain that he heard the voice again nearer and louder. It was not long  until the cry was repeated for the third time, and soon after the  captive heard it once more, loudly and distinctly, immediately to the  west of the lodge. Then there was a sound as of footsteps at the door,  and the white lightning entered through the smoke-hole and circled  around the lodge, hanging over the heads of the council. But the Ute  heard not the voice which the Navajo heard and saw not the vision he  beheld. Soon the YÃ ybichy (QastcÃ¨Ã«lÃ§i) entered the lodge and standing on  the white lightning, said: \"What is the matter with you, my grandchild?  You take no thought about anything. Something you must do for yourself,  or else, in the morning you will be whipped to death--that is what the  council has decided. Pull out four pegs from the bottom of the tent,  push it open there, and then you can shove things through.\" The Navajo  answered, \"How shall I do it! See the way I am tied! I am poor! See how  I am wound up!\" But QastcÃ¨Ã«lÃ§i again said: \"When you leave, take with  you those bags filled with embroideries and take with you tobacco from  the pouches near the fire.\" Scarcely had QastcÃ¨Ã«lÃ§i disappeared when the  Navajo heard a voice overhead, and a bird named qocÃ§Ã²Â¢i flew down  through the smoke-hole, hovered four times around the lodge over the  heads of the Ute, and departed by the way it had entered. In a moment  after it had disappeared a few of the Ute began to nod and close their  eyes; soon the others showed signs of drowsiness; some stretched  themselves out on the ground overpowered with sleep; others rose and  departed from time to time, singly and in little groups, to seek their  lodges and repose there. The last to drop asleep were the old man and  the old woman who sat at the door; but at length their chins fell upon  their bosoms. Then the Navajo, fearing no watchers, went to work and  loosened the cords that bound him; he lifted, from the inside, some of  the pegs which held the edge of the tent, and shoved out the two bags of  embroideries which QastcÃ¨Ã«lÃ§i had told him to take. Passing out through  the door of the lodge, where he found both the watch-dogs sound asleep,  and taking with him the cords with which he had been tied and some of  the tobacco, he went round to the back of the lodge, where he had put  the bags; these he tied with the cords in such a manner that they would  make an easily balanced double bundle. He shouldered his bundle and was  all ready to start.    33. At this moment he heard, at a little distance to the south of where  he stood, the hoot of an owl. Instantly recollecting the words of the  owl-like form which he had encountered at the spring at nightfall, he  set off in the direction from which the call proceeded. He had not  walked far until he came to a precipitous bluff formed by two branching  caÃ±ons, and it seemed at first impossible for him to proceed farther.  Soon, however, he noticed a tall spruce tree, which grew beside the  precipice from the foot to the summit, for the day had now begun to dawn  and he could see objects more clearly. At this juncture QastcÃ¨Ã«lÃ§i again  appeared to him and said: \"How is it, my grandchild, that you are still  here? Get on the top of that spruce tree and go down into the caÃ±on on  it.\" The Navajo stretched out his hand to seize the top of the tree, but  it swayed away from his grasp. \"See, my grandfather,\" he said to  QastcÃ¨Ã«lÃ§i, \"it moves away from me; I cannot reach it.\" Then QastcÃ¨Ã«lÃ§i  flung the white lightning around the top of the tree, as an Indian  flings his lasso around the neck of a horse, and drew it in to the edge  of the cliff. \"Descend,\" he commanded the Indian, \"and when you reach  the bottom take four sprays from the tree, each from a different part.  You may need them in the future.\" So the Navajo went down, took the four  sprays as he was bidden and put them under his robe.    34. At the base of the bluff he again met QastcÃ¨Ã«lÃ§i, and at this moment  he heard a noise, as of a great and distant tumult, which seemed to come  from above and from beyond the edge of the cliff whence they had  descended. From moment to moment it grew louder and came nearer, and  soon the sounds of angry voices could be distinguished. The Ute had  discovered the flight of their captive and were in hot pursuit. \"Your  enemies are coming for you,\" said the divine one; \"but yonder small  holes on the opposite side of the caÃ±on are the doors of my dwelling,  where you may hide. The bottom of the caÃ±on is strewn with large rocks  and fallen trees; it would take you much time and hard labor to get over  these if I did not help you; but I will do something to make your way  easy.\"--As he said this he blew a strong breath, and instantly a great  white rainbow spanned the caÃ±on. The Navajo tried to step on this in  order to cross, but it was so soft that his feet went through; he could  not step on it. QastcÃ¨Ã«lÃ§i stood beside him and laughed at"]]]
