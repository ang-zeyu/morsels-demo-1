And they used to train those ponies wheeling cattle in the scrub:     They were demons, were the members of the Geebung Polo Club.       It was somewhere down the country, in a city's smoke and steam,     That a polo club existed, called 'The Cuff and Collar Team'.     As a social institution 'twas a marvellous success,     For the members were distinguished by exclusiveness and dress.     They had natty little ponies that were nice, and smooth, and sleek,     For their cultivated owners only rode 'em once a week.     So they started up the country in pursuit of sport and fame,     For they meant to show the Geebungs how they ought to play the game;     And they took their valets with them -- just to give their boots a rub     Ere they started operations on the Geebung Polo Club.       Now my readers can imagine how the contest ebbed and flowed,     When the Geebung boys got going it was time to clear the road;     And the game was so terrific that ere half the time was gone     A spectator's leg was broken -- just from merely looking on.     For they waddied one another till the plain was strewn with dead,     While the score was kept so even that they neither got ahead.     And the Cuff and Collar Captain, when he tumbled off to die,     Was the last surviving player -- so the game was called a tie.       Then the Captain of the Geebungs raised him slowly from the ground,     Though his wounds were mostly mortal, yet he fiercely gazed around;     There was no one to oppose him -- all the rest were in a trance,     So he scrambled on his pony for his last expiring chance,     For he meant to make an effort to get victory to his side;     So he struck at goal -- and missed it -- then he tumbled off and died.           .   .   .   .   .       By the old Campaspe River, where the breezes shake the grass,     There's a row of little gravestones that the stockmen never pass,     For they bear a crude inscription saying, 'Stranger, drop a tear,     For the Cuff and Collar players and the Geebung boys lie here.'     And on misty moonlit evenings, while the dingoes howl around,     You can see their shadows flitting down that phantom polo ground;     You can hear the loud collisions as the flying players meet,     And the rattle of the mallets, and the rush of ponies' feet,     Till the terrified spectator rides like blazes to the pub --     He's been haunted by the spectres of the Geebung Polo Club.          The Travelling Post Office           The roving breezes come and go, the reed beds sweep and sway,     The sleepy river murmurs low, and loiters on its way,     It is the land of lots o' time along the Castlereagh.           .   .   .   .   .       The old man's son had left the farm, he found it dull and slow,     He drifted to the great North-west where all the rovers go.     'He's gone so long,' the old man said, 'he's dropped right out of mind,     But if you'd write a line to him I'd take it very kind;     He's shearing here and fencing there, a kind of waif and stray,     He's droving now with Conroy's sheep along the Castlereagh.       'The sheep are travelling for the grass, and travelling very slow;     They may be at Mundooran now, or past the Overflow,     Or tramping down the black soil flats across by Waddiwong,     But all those little country towns would send the letter wrong,     The mailman, if he's extra tired, would pass them in his sleep,     It's safest to address the note to 'Care of Conroy's sheep',     For five and twenty thousand head can scarcely go astray,     You write to 'Care of Conroy's sheep along the Castlereagh'.'           .   .   .   .   .       By rock and ridge and riverside the western mail has gone,     Across the great Blue Mountain Range to take that letter on.     A moment on the topmost grade while open fire doors glare,     She pauses like a living thing to breathe the mountain air,     Then launches down the other side across the plains away     To bear that note to 'Conroy's sheep along the Castlereagh'.       And now by coach and mailman's bag it goes from town to town,     And Conroy's Gap and Conroy's Creek have marked it 'further down'.     Beneath a sky of deepest blue where never cloud abides,     A speck upon the waste of plain the lonely mailman rides.     Where fierce hot winds have set the pine and myall boughs asweep     He hails the shearers passing by for news of Conroy's sheep.     By big lagoons where wildfowl play and crested pigeons flock,     By camp fires where the drovers ride around their restless stock,     And past the teamster toiling down to fetch the wool away     My letter chases Conroy's sheep along the Castlereagh.          Saltbush Bill           Now this is the law of the Overland that all in the West obey,     A man must cover with travelling sheep a six-mile stage a day;     But this is the law which the drovers make, right easily understood,     They travel their stage where the grass is bad,       but they camp where the grass is good;     They camp, and they ravage the squatter's grass till never a blade remains,     Then they drift away as the white clouds drift       on the edge of the saltbush plains,     From camp to camp and from run to run they battle it hand to hand,     For a blade of grass and the right to pass on the track of the Overland.     For this is the law of the Great Stock Routes,       'tis written in white and black --     The man that goes with a travelling mob must keep to a half-mile track;     And the drovers keep to a half-mile track       on the runs where the grass is dead,     But they spread their sheep on a well-grassed run       till they go with a two-mile spread.     So the squatters hurry the drovers on from dawn till the fall of night,     And the squatters' dogs and the drovers' dogs get mixed in a deadly fight;     Yet the squatters' men, though they hunt the mob,       are willing the peace to keep,     For the drovers learn how to use their hands       when they go with the travelling sheep;     But this is the tale of a Jackaroo that came from a foreign strand,     And the fight that he fought with Saltbush Bill, the King of the Overland.       Now Saltbush Bill was a drover tough, as ever the country knew,     He had fought his way on the Great Stock Routes       from the sea to the big Barcoo;     He could tell when he came to a friendly run       that gave him a chance to spread,     And he knew where the hungry owners were that hurried his sheep ahead;     He was drifting down in the Eighty drought       with a mob that could scarcely creep,     (When the kangaroos by the thousands starve,       it is rough on the travelling sheep),     And he camped one night at the crossing-place on the edge of the Wilga run,     'We must manage a feed for them here,' he said,       'or the half of the mob are done!'     So he spread them out when they left the camp wherever they liked to go,     Till he grew aware of a Jackaroo with a station-hand in tow,     And they set to work on the straggling sheep,       and with many a stockwhip crack     They forced them in where the grass was dead       in the space of the half-mile track;     So William prayed that the hand of fate might suddenly strike him blue     But he'd get some grass for his starving sheep       in the teeth of that Jackaroo.     So he turned and he cursed the Jackaroo, he cursed him alive or dead,     From the soles of his great unwieldy feet to the crown of his ugly head,     With an extra curse on the moke he rode and the cur at his heels that ran,     Till the Jackaroo from his horse got down and he went for the drover-man;     With the station-hand for his picker-up,       though the sheep ran loose the while,     They battled it out on the saltbush plain in the regular prize-ring style.       Now, the new chum fought for his honour's sake       and the pride of the English race,     But the drover fought for his daily bread with a smile on his bearded face;     So he shifted ground and he sparred for wind and he made it a lengthy mill,     And from time to time as his scouts came in       they whispered to Saltbush Bill --     'We have spread the sheep with a two-mile spread,       and the grass it is something grand,     You must stick to him, Bill, for another round       for the pride of the Overland.'     The new chum made it a rushing fight, though never a blow got home,     Till the sun rode high in the cloudless sky       and glared on the brick-red loam,     Till the sheep drew in to the shelter-trees and settled them down to rest,     Then the drover said he would fight no more and he gave his opponent best.       So the new chum rode to the homestead straight       and he told them a story grand     Of the desperate fight that he fought that day       with the King of the Overland.     And the tale went home to the Public Schools       of the pluck of the English swell,     How the drover fought for his very life, but blood in the end must tell.     But the travelling sheep and the Wilga sheep       were boxed on the Old Man Plain.     'Twas a full week's work ere they drafted out and hunted them off again,     With a week's good grass in their wretched hides,       with a curse and a stockwhip crack,     They hunted them off on the road once more       to starve on the half-mile track.     And Saltbush Bill, on the Overland, will many a time recite     How the best day's work that ever he did       was the day that he lost the fight.

I know there's many a stray cowboy    Who'll be lost at the great, final sale,    When he might have gone in the green pastures    Had he known of the dim, narrow trail.      I wonder if ever a cowboy    Stood ready for that Judgment Day,    And could say to the Boss of the Riders,    \"I'm ready, come drive me away.\"      For they, like the cows that are locoed,    Stampede at the sight of a hand,    Are dragged with a rope to the round-up,    Or get marked with some crooked man's brand.      And I'm scared that I'll be a stray yearling,--    A maverick, unbranded on high,--    And get cut in the bunch with the \"rusties\"    When the Boss of the Riders goes by.      For they tell of another big owner    Whose ne'er overstocked, so they say,    But who always makes room for the sinner    Who drifts from the straight, narrow way.      They say he will never forget you,    That he knows every action and look;    So, for safety, you'd better get branded,    Have your name in the great Tally Book.    [Footnote 2: Sung to the air of _My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean_.]          THE COWBOY'S LIFE[3]        The bawl of a steer,    To a cowboy's ear,    Is music of sweetest strain;    And the yelping notes    Of the gray cayotes    To him are a glad refrain.      And his jolly songs    Speed him along,    As he thinks of the little gal    With golden hair    Who is waiting there    At the bars of the home corral.      For a kingly crown    In the noisy town    His saddle he wouldn't change;    No life so free    As the life we see    Way out on the Yaso range.      His eyes are bright    And his heart as light    As the smoke of his cigarette;    There's never a care    For his soul to bear,    No trouble to make him fret.      The rapid beat    Of his broncho's feet    On the sod as he speeds along,    Keeps living time    To the ringing rhyme    Of his rollicking cowboy song.      Hike it, cowboys,    For the range away    On the back of a bronc of steel,    With a careless flirt    Of the raw-hide quirt    And a dig of a roweled heel!      The winds may blow    And the thunder growl    Or the breezes may safely moan;--    A cowboy's life    Is a royal life,    His saddle his kingly throne.      Saddle up, boys,    For the work is play    When love's in the cowboy's eyes,--    When his heart is light    As the clouds of white    That swim in the summer skies.

Where you whoop up the cattle from morning till night    All out in the midnight rain.        The cowboy's life is a dreadful life,      He's driven through heat and cold;      I'm almost froze with the water on my clothes,      A-ridin' through heat and cold.      I've been where the lightnin', the lightnin' tangled in my eyes,    The cattle I could scarcely hold;    Think I heard my boss man say:    \"I want all brave-hearted men who ain't afraid to die    To whoop up the cattle from morning till night,    Way up on the Kansas line.\"      Speaking of your farms and your shanty charms,    Speaking of your silver and gold,--    Take a cowman's advice, go and marry you a true and lovely little wife,    Never to roam, always stay at home;    That's a cowman's, a cowman's advice,    Way up on the Kansas line.      Think I heard the noisy cook say,    \"Wake up, boys, it's near the break of day,\"--    Way up on the Kansas line,    And slowly we will rise with the sleepy feeling eyes,    Way up on the Kansas line.        The cowboy's life is a dreary, dreary life,      All out in the midnight rain;      I'm almost froze with the water on my clothes,      Way up on the Kansas line.          THE COWMAN'S PRAYER        Now, O Lord, please lend me thine ear,    The prayer of a cattleman to hear,    No doubt the prayers may seem strange,    But I want you to bless our cattle range.      Bless the round-ups year by year,    And don't forget the growing steer;    Water the lands with brooks and rills    For my cattle that roam on a thousand hills.      Prairie fires, won't you please stop?    Let thunder roll and water drop.    It frightens me to see the smoke;    Unless it's stopped, I'll go dead broke.      As you, O Lord, my herd behold,    It represents a sack of gold;    I think at least five cents a pound    Will be the price of beef the year around.      One thing more and then I'm through,--    Instead of one calf, give my cows two.    I may pray different from other men    But I've had my say, and now, Amen.          THE MINER'S SONG[4]        In a rusty, worn-out cabin sat a broken-hearted leaser,    His singlejack was resting on his knee.    His old \"buggy\" in the corner told the same old plaintive tale,    His ore had left in all his poverty.    He lifted his old singlejack, gazed on its battered face,    And said: \"Old boy, I know we're not to blame;    Our gold has us forsaken, some other path it's taken,    But I still believe we'll strike it just the same.        \"We'll strike it, yes, we'll strike it just the same,      Although it's gone into some other's claim.      My dear old boy don't mind it, we won't starve if we don't find it,      And we'll drill and shoot and find it just the same.      \"For forty years I've hammered steel and tried to make a strike,    I've burned twice the powder Custer ever saw.    I've made just coin enough to keep poorer than a snake.    My jack's ate all my books on mining law.    I've worn gunny-sacks for overalls, and 'California socks,'    I've burned candles that would reach from here to Maine,    I've lived on powder, smoke, and bacon, that's no lie, boy, I'm not        fakin',    But I still believe we'll strike it just the same.      \"Last night as I lay sleeping in the midst of all my dream    My assay ran six ounces clear in gold,    And the silver it ran clean sixteen ounces to the seam,    And the poor old miner's joy could scarce be told.    I lay there, boy, I could not sleep, I had a feverish brow,    Got up, went back, and put in six holes more.    And then, boy, I was chokin' just to see the ground I'd broken;    But alas! alas! the miner's dream was o'er.        \"We'll strike it, yes, we'll strike it just the same,      Although it's gone into some other's claim.      My dear old boy, don't mind it, we won't starve if we don't find it,      And I still believe I'll strike it just the same.\"    [Footnote 4: Printed as a fugitive ballad in _Grandon of Sierra_, by  Charles E. Winter.]          JESSE JAMES        Jesse James was a lad that killed a-many a man;    He robbed the Danville train.    But that dirty little coward that shot Mr. Howard    Has laid poor Jesse in his grave.          Poor Jesse had a wife to mourn for his life,        Three children, they were brave.        But that dirty little coward that shot Mr. Howard        Has laid poor Jesse in his grave.      It was Robert Ford, that dirty little coward,    I wonder how he does feel,    For he ate of Jesse's bread and he slept in Jesse's bed,    Then laid poor Jesse in his grave.      Jesse was a man, a friend to the poor,    He never would see a man suffer pain;    And with his brother Frank he robbed the Chicago bank,    And stopped the Glendale train.      It was his brother Frank that robbed the Gallatin bank,    And carried the money from the town;    It was in this very place that they had a little race,    For they shot Captain Sheets to the ground.      They went to the crossing not very far from there,    And there they did the same;    With the agent on his knees, he delivered up the keys    To the outlaws, Frank and Jesse James.      It was on Wednesday night, the moon was shining bright,    They robbed the Glendale train;    The people they did say, for many miles away,    It was robbed by Frank and Jesse James.      It was on Saturday night, Jesse was at home    Talking with his family brave,    Robert Ford came along like a thief in the night    And laid poor Jesse in his grave.      The people held their breath when they heard of Jesse's death,    And wondered how he ever came to die.    It was one of the gang called little Robert Ford,    He shot poor Jesse on the sly.      Jesse went to his rest with his hand on his breast;    The devil will be upon his knee.    He was born one day in the county of Clay    And came from a solitary race.      This song was made by Billy Gashade,    As soon as the news did arrive;    He said there was no man with the law in his hand    Who could take Jesse James when alive.        Jesse James (Mus. Not.)        Jes-se James was a lad that killed a-ma-ny a    man; He robbed the Dan-ville train; But that    dirt-y lit-tle cow-ard that shot Mis-ter    How-ard Has laid poor Jes-se in the grave.      REFRAIN.      Poor Jes-se had a wife to mourn for his life.    Three chil-dren, they were brave; But that    dir-ty lit-tle cow-ard That shot Mis-ter    How-ard Has laid poor Jes-se in the grave.
