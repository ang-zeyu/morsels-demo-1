They had not  been out of the stable for several days and were inclined to dance and  prance. They stepped in among the tree branches and then one animal  reared and tried to back.    \"Get up there, Dan!\" cried Dick. \"None of that tomfoolery! Get up, I  say!\"    The other horse wanted to go ahead, and he dragged his mate deeper into  the tree limbs. Then, without warning, the balky animal made a leap,  cleared the tree, and started down the road at breakneck speed.    \"Look out, the team is running away!\" yelled Sam, and then stopped  short, for he as well as the others were in danger of being thrown from  the buckboard.          CHAPTER V    RANDOLPH ROVER'S STORY      It was a time of peril, and all of the Rover boys realized this fully.  The buckboard was a strong one, but the road had been washed out so much  by the storm that it was very uneven, and the jouncing threatened each  moment to land one lad or another out on his head.    \"Whoa! whoa!\" yelled Dick, and did his best to rein in the team. But, as  mentioned before, they had not been out for several days and were  consequently fresh and inclined to keep on. Each had the bit in his  teeth, so pulling on the lines was of little avail.    \"If we don't stop soon something is going to happen,\" was Tom's comment,  and scarcely had he spoken when they went down into a rut and Sam was  flung up and over a wheel into some brushwood. Then the team went on as  before.    The woods left behind, they came to a large open field, where the ground  was rather soft.    \"Turn in here, Dick, if you can,\" cried Tom.    \"That is what I am trying to do,\" answered the eldest Rover boy, pulling  on one rein with might and main.    At first the horses refused to leave the road, but at last the strain on  the one rein told and Dan swerved to the right, dragging his mate with  him. As the wheels of the buckboard sank into the soft soil of the field  the pulling became harder, and at last the horses dropped into a walk  and were then brought to a stop with ease.    \"Wonder if Sam was hurt?\" were Dick's first words, as he leaped to the  ground and ran to the heads of the team to quiet them.    \"He went out in a hurry, that's sure,\" was Tom's answer. \"Can you hold  them now?\"    \"Yes--the fire is all out of them.\"    \"Then I'll run back and see to Sam.\" And Tom set off on a dog trot  toward the spot where the mishap to his younger brother had occurred. He  found Sam sitting on a rock rubbing his left wrist.    \"Hurt?\" he sang out, anxiously.    \"This wrist is a little lame, and my knee is skinned,\" was the answer.  \"Did they get away and throw you out?\"    \"No, Dick managed to stop them by turning into a soft field. It is lucky  you didn't break your neck.\"    \"I might have if I hadn't tumbled into the bushes, Tom. Gracious, how  the buckboard did jounce up and down!\"    Limping a little on account of the bruised knee, Sam followed his  brother down the road. They found Dick had led the team from the field.  He, too, was glad to learn Sam was not seriously injured.    \"What's to do now?\" asked Tom. \"I don't like to trust that team much.\"    \"Oh, they're tamed down now,\" asserted Dick. \"I am sure they won't want  to run away again.\"    \"We want to get to Carwell as soon as possible, but we don't want to do  it by breaking our necks,\" went on the fun-loving Rover.    Once more the three youths got on the buckboard and Dick started the  team. The fire was now all out of them, and they went along at their  regular gait. It had grown so dark the boys had to light a lantern they  had brought along.    \"Listen!\" said Sam presently, and held up his hand. From out of the  darkness they heard the steady chug-chug of an automobile. It seemed to  be coming toward them.    \"Maybe it's the runabout with those two men!\" cried Tom.    \"If it is, let us try to stop them,\" answered Dick.    They brought the team to a halt and listened. For a few seconds the  chug-chug came closer, then it died away in the distance on their left.    \"The machine must have taken to a side road,\" was Dick's comment.    \"Yes, and we may as well go on,\" answered Tom.    Once more they proceeded on their way. Less than a hundred yards were  covered when they reached the side road. In the muddy roadway the tracks  of the rubber tires of the automobile were plainly to be seen.    \"If we were sure they were the men we might go after them,\" said Sam.    \"We'd not catch them with the horses,\" answered Dick.    \"And it might be another machine,\" added Tom. \"There are plenty of them  in Carwell.\"    They were now within two miles of the town and the farmhouses were  becoming more numerous. Just as they struck a paved street, Tom uttered  an exclamation:    \"Here comes Uncle Randolph now!\"    He pointed ahead to where a street light fell on a horse and buggy. On  the seat of the latter sat Randolph Rover, driving along contentedly.    \"Hullo, Uncle Randolph!\" sang out Dick, and brought the buckboard to a  halt.    \"Why, Dick!\" exclaimed the uncle, staring at the three boys in surprise.  \"What brings you here this time of night?\"    \"We came to find you, Uncle Randolph,\" said Tom, and added: \"Are your  traction company bonds safe?\"    \"My bonds? What do you know of my bonds?\" And now the buggy halted  beside the buckboard.    \"We know two men are after them,\" said Sam.    \"Oh, I thought that was a secret,\" answered Mr. Rover.    \"But did you see the men?\" asked Dick, impatiently.    \"Oh, yes, and I have had a narrow escape from being swindled,\" answered  the uncle, calmly.    \"Oh, then you escaped,\" said Dick, and he and his brothers breathed a  sigh of relief.    \"Yes, I escaped,\" answered Randolph Rover. \"It was very kind of Mr.  Jardell to come to me as he did,\" he went on.    \"Mr. Jardell?\" asked Tom. \"Who is he?\"    \"Why, the treasurer of the traction company.\"    \"Then you haven't seen a man named Merrick and another named Pike?\"  asked Sam.    \"Why, no. Who are they?\"    \"Two rascals who were up to some game. We think they were after your  traction company bonds.\"    \"Ha! perhaps--But no, that couldn't be,\" murmured Mr. Rover, wiping off  the spectacles he wore. \"I--er--I really do not understand this, boys.\"    \"Tell us what you've been doing, uncle, and then we'll tell what we  know,\" said Dick.    \"Um! Well, you know that some time ago I invested in ten thousand  dollars worth of traction company bonds--got them through an agent in  New York.\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Well, about a week ago I received a private letter from Mr. Jardell, of  the traction company, stating that there was something wrong with the  bonds. Some plates had been stolen and counterfeit bonds printed.\"    \"Yes.\"    \"I was asked to keep quiet about the matter, for if the facts became  generally known the public would become frightened and the bonds would  go down in the stock market. Mr. Jardell said he would meet me at  Carwell and have the printer look at my bonds and find out if they were  genuine or not.\"    \"And what did you do then?\" asked Dick, who began to smell a mouse, as  the saying goes.    \"I sent Mr. Jardell word I would meet him at the Carwell hotel to-day.  We met, and he and his printer, a man named Grimes, said the bonds I  possessed were counterfeits.\"    \"And then what?\"    \"Of course I was very much distressed,\" went on Randolph Rover, calmly.  \"I did not know what to do. But Mr. Jardell was very nice about it. He  said he would take the bonds and get the company to issue good ones in  their place. He gave me a receipt for them, and I am to have the good  bonds next week.\"    \"Why should he give you good bonds for bad ones?\" said Tom, who, like  Dick, was almost certain something was wrong.    \"I asked that question, too, Thomas, but he said the reputation of his  company was at stake. He did not want the public at large to know that  bogus bonds were on the market.\"    \"Uncle Randolph, do you know this Mr. Jardell personally?\" asked Dick.    \"Why--er--not exactly. But his letters----\"    \"How did he look?\"    As well as he was able Mr. Rover described the man and also his  companion. The boys exchanged glances.    \"Merrick and Pike,\" muttered Tom.    \"What is that you say, Thomas?\"    \"We think those men were swindlers,\" said Sam.    \"Swindlers! Oh, my dear Samuel, impossible!\" cried Randolph Rover  aghast. \"Why, they were very nice gentlemen, very nice. They asked me  how my scientific farming was getting along, and both had read my  article in the _Review_ on the grafting of grape vines, and----\"    \"But we know these chaps,\" said Dick, \"and they are called Merrick and  Pike.\"    \"And they talked about getting the best of you,\" added Tom. \"That is why  we followed you to Carwell. Where are the men now?\"    \"They have gone away. But----\"    \"Were they in a green runabout--an auto runabout?\"    \"They had a runabout, yes. I do not remember what color it was.\"    \"The same fellows!\" cried Dick. \"Uncle Randolph, unless we are very much  mistaken, you have been tricked, swindled! They have robbed you of the  ten thousand dollars worth of bonds!\"          CHAPTER VI    WAITING FOR NEWS      It took Randolph Rover several minutes to comprehend the various  statements made by the boys. That he had really been swindled by such  nicely-spoken men as he had met at the Carwell hotel seemed  extraordinary to him.    \"I understand the bonds were not registered,\" said Dick.    \"That is true,\" groaned his uncle.    \"Then anybody could use them.\"    \"Yes, although I have the numbers,--on a sheet in my desk at home.\"    \"Well, that will make it more difficult for the rascals to dispose of  them,\" said Sam.    \"I'd like to catch that Merrick and that Pike, and punch their heads for  them,\" commented Tom.

Enda was almost  stunned, but the hissing of the serpents rising from the sand around him  brought him to himself, and, jumping to his feet, once more he drove  them down beneath the surface. He then approached the jagged rock, on  the top of which he saw the filthy monster glaring at him with bloodshot  eyes. Enda poised his spear and hurled it against his enemy. It entered  between the monster's eyes, and from the wound the blood flowed down  like a black torrent and dyed the plain, and the shrunken carcass  slipped down the front of the rocks and disappeared beneath the sand.  Enda once more ascended the rock, and without meeting or seeing anything  he passed over the stony waste, and at last he came to a leafy wood.  He had not gone far in the wood until he heard the sound of fairy  music, and walking on he came upon a mossy glade, and there he found the  fairies dancing around their queen. They were so small, and were all so  brightly dressed, that they looked like a mass of waving flowers; but  when he was seen by them they vanished like a glorious dream, and no one  remained before him but the fairy queen. The queen blushed at finding  herself alone, but on stamping her little foot three times upon the  ground, the frightened fairies all crept back again.    \"You are welcome, Enda,\" said the queen. \"My little subjects have been  alarmed by your strange dress and crystal helmet. I pray you take them  off; you do not need them here.\"    Enda did as he was bidden, and he laid down his water-dress and helmet  on the grass, and the little fairies, seeing him in his proper shape,  got over their fright, and, unrestrained by the presence of the queen,  they ran tumbling over one another to try and get a good look at the  crystal helmet.    \"I know what you have come for, Enda,\" said the queen. \"The golden cup  you shall have to-morrow; but to-night you must share our feast, so  follow me to the palace.\"    Having said this, the queen beckoned her pages to her, and, attended by  them and followed by Enda, she went on through the wood. When they had  left it behind them Enda saw on a green hill before him the snow-white  palace of the fairy queen.    As the queen approached the steps that led up to the open door,  a band of tiny fairies, dressed in rose-colored silk, came out, carrying  baskets of flowers, which they flung down on the steps to make a  fragrant carpet for her. They were followed by a band of harpers dressed  in yellow silken robes, who ranged themselves on each side of the steps  and played their sweetest music as the queen ascended.    When the queen, followed by Enda, entered the palace, they passed  through a crystal hall that led to a banquet-room. The room was lighted  by a single star, large as a battle-shield. It was fixed against the  wall above a diamond throne.    The queen seated herself upon the throne, and the pages, advancing  towards her, and bending low, as they approached the steps, handed her  a golden wand.    The queen waved the wand three times, and a table laden with all kinds  of delicacies appeared upon the floor. Then she beckoned Enda to her,  and when he stood beside her the fairy table was no higher than his  knee.    \"I am afraid I must make you smaller, Enda,\" said the queen, \"or you  will never be able to seat yourself at my fairy table.\"    And having said this, she touched Enda with the golden wand, and at once  he became as small as her tallest page. Then she struck the steps of her  throne, and all the nobles of her court, headed by her bards, took their  places at the festive board.    The feast went on right merrily, and when the tiny jeweled drinking-cups  were placed upon the table, the queen ordered the harpers to play.    And the little harpers struck the chords, and as Enda listened to the  music it seemed to him as if he was being slowly lifted from his seat,  and when the music ended the fairies vanished, the shining star went  out, and Enda was in perfect darkness.    The air blew keenly in his face, and he knew not where he was. At  last he saw a faint gray light, and soon this light grew broader and  brighter, and as the shadows fled before it, he could hardly believe his  eyes when he found himself in his curragh on the lake, and the moonlight  streaming down from the mountain-tops.    For a moment he thought he must have been dreaming; but there in the  boat before him were the crystal helmet, and the water-dress, and the  gleaming spear, and the golden bowl of perfumed water that was to remove  the spell of enchantment from the white swan of the lake, and sailing  towards him from the sedgy bank came the snow-white swan; and when she  touched the boat, Enda put out his hands and lifted her in, and then  over her plumage he poured the perfumed water from the golden bowl, and  the Princess Mave in all her maiden beauty stood before him.    \"Take your oar, Enda,\" she said, \"and row to the southern bank.\"    Enda seized his oar, and the curragh sped across the waters swifter than  a swallow in its flight. When the boat touched the shore Enda jumped  out, and lifted the princess on to the bank.    \"Send your boat adrift, Enda,\" she said; \"but first take out your  shining spear; the water-dress and the crystal helmet will take care of  themselves.\"    Enda took out the spear, and then pushed the boat from the bank. It sped  on towards the hut in the middle of the lake; but before it had reached  halfway six nymphs sprang up from the water and seizing the helmet and  dress, sank with them beneath the tide, and the boat went on until it  pushed its prow against the steps of the little hut, where it remained.    Then Enda and the princess turned towards the south, and it was not long  until they came to a deep forest, that was folding up its shadows and  spreading out its mossy glades before the glancing footsteps of the  morning. They had not gone far through the forest when they heard the  music of hounds and the cries of huntsmen, and crashing towards them  through the low branches they saw a fierce wild boar. Enda, gently  pushing the princess behind him, leveled his spear, and when the boar  came close to him he drove it into his throat. The brute fell dead at  his feet, and the dogs rushing up began to tear it to pieces. The  princess fainted at the sight, and while Enda was endeavoring to restore  her, the king of Erin, followed by his huntsmen, appeared, and when the  king saw the princess he started in amazement, as he recognized the  features of his daughter Mave.    [Illustration: \"'I have mourned you as dead, my darling,' said he\"]    At that moment the princess came to herself, and her father, lifting her  tenderly in his arms, kissed her again and again.    \"I have mourned you as dead, my darling,\" said he, \"and now you are  restored to me more lovely than ever. I would gladly have given up my  throne for this. But say who is the champion who has brought you hither,  and who has slain the wild boar we have hunted so many years in vain?\"    The princess blushed like a rose as she said:    \"His name is Enda, father; it is he has brought me back to you.\"    Then the king embraced Enda and said:    \"Forgive me, Enda, for asking any questions about you before you have  shared the hospitality of my court. My palace lies beyond the forest,  and we shall reach it soon.\"    Then the king ordered his huntsman to sound the bugle-horn, and all his  nobles galloped up in answer to it, and when they saw the Princess Mave  they were so dazzled by her beauty that they scarcely gave a thought to  the death of the wild boar.    \"It is my daughter, Mave, come back to me,\" said the king.    And all the nobles lowered their lances, and bowed in homage to the  lady.    \"And there stands the champion who has brought her home,\" said the king,  pointing to Enda.    The nobles looked at Enda, and bowed courteously, but in their hearts  they were jealous of the champion, for they saw he was already a  favorite of the king's.    Then the pages came up, leading milk-white steeds with golden bridles,  and the king, ordering Enda to mount one of them, lifted Mave on to his  own, and mounted behind her. The pages, carrying the boar's head on a  hollow shield, preceded by the huntsmen sounding their horns, set out  towards the palace, and the royal party followed them.    As the procession approached the palace crowds came rushing out to see  the trophies of the chase, and through the snow-white door the queen,  Mave's cruel stepmother, attended by her maids-of-honor and the royal  bards, came forth to greet the king. But when she saw seated before him  the Princess Mave, who she thought was at the bottom of the lake under a  spell of enchantment, she uttered a loud cry, and fell senseless to the  ground.    The king jumped from his horse, and rushing to the queen, lifted her up  and carried her in his arms to her apartments, for he had no suspicion  of the wickedness of which she had been guilty.    And the court leeches were summoned to attend her, but she died that  very night, and it was not until a green mound, worthy of a queen of  Erin, had been raised over her grave that the Princess Mave told her  father of the wickedness of her stepmother. And when she told him the  whole story of how Enda had broken the spell of enchantment, and of the  dangers which he had faced for her sake, the king summoned an assembly  of all his nobles, and seated on his throne, wearing his golden helmet,  the bards upon his right hand and the Druids upon his left, and the  nobles in ranks before him with gleaming helmets and flashing spears,  he told them the story of the princess, and of the service which Enda  had rendered to her.    \"And now,\""]]]
