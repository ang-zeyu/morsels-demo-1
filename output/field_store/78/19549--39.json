(#5)"],[1,"republican party, who hoped to see monarchy altogether extinguished in  England by the death of the three persons already named in the bill  of succession. The lords insisted upon their amendments, and several  fruitless conferences were held between the two houses. At length the  bill was dropt for the present in consequence of an event which in a  great measure dissipated the fears of a popish successor. This was the  delivery of the princess Anne, who, on the twenty-seventh day of July,  brought forth a son, christened by the name of William, and afterwards  created duke of Gloucester.          AFFAIRS OF THE CONTINENT.    In the midst of these domestic disputes, William did not neglect the  affairs of the continent. He retained all his former influence in  Holland, as his countrymen had reason to confide in his repeated  assurances of inviolable affection. The great scheme which he had  projected of a confederacy against France began at this period to  take effect. The princes of the empire assembled in the diet, solemnly  exhorted the emperor to declare war against the French king, who had  committed numberless infractions of the treaties of Munster, Osnabruck,  Nimeguen, and the truce, invaded their country without provocation,  and evinced himself an inveterate enemy of the holy Roman empire. They  therefore besought his imperial majesty to conclude a treaty of peace  with the Turks, who had offered advantageous terms, and proceed to an  open rupture with Louis, in which case they would consider it as a war  of the empire, and support their head in the most effectual manner. The  states-general published a declaration against the common enemy, taxing  him with manifold infractions of the treaty of commerce; with having  involved the subjects of the republic in the persecution which he had  raised against the protestants; with having cajoled and insulted them  with deceitful promises and insolent threats; with having plundered and  oppressed the Dutch merchants and traders in France; and, finally, with  having declared war against the states without any plausible reason  assigned. The elector of Brandenburg denounced war against France as  a power whose perfidy, cruelty, and ambition, it was the duty of every  prince to oppose. The marquis de Castanaga, governor of the Spanish  Netherlands, issued a counter declaration to that of Louis, who had  declared against his master. He accused the French king of having laid  waste the empire, without any regard to the obligations of religion and  humanity, or even to the laws of war; of having countenanced the most  barbarous acts of cruelty and oppression; and of having intrigued with  the enemies of Christ for the destruction of the empire. The emperor  negotiated an alliance offensive and defensive with the states-general,  binding the contracting parties to co-operate with their whole power  against France and her allies. It was stipulated that neither side  should engage in a separate treaty on any pretence whatsoever; that no  peace should be admitted until the treaties of Westphalia, Osnabruck,  Minister, and the Pyrenees, should have been vindicated; that, in case  of a negotiation for a peace or truce, the transactions on both sides  should be communicated _bona fide_; and that Spain and England should be  invited to accede to the treaty. In a separate article, the contracting  powers agreed, that, in case of the Spanish king's dying without issue,  the states-general should assist the emperor with all their forces to  take possession of that monarchy: that they should use their friendly  endeavours with the princes electors, their allies, towards elevating  his son Joseph to the dignity of king of the Romans, and employ their  utmost force against France should she attempt to oppose his elevation.    {WILLIAM AND MARY, 1688--1701.}          WAR DECLARED AGAINST FRANCE.    William, who was the soul of this confederacy, found no difficulty in  persuading the English to undertake a war against their old enemies and  rivals. On the sixteenth day of April, Mr. Hambden made a motion for  taking into consideration the state of the kingdom with respect to  France, and foreign alliances; and the commons unanimously resolved,  that, in case his majesty should think fit to engage in a war with  France, they would, in a parliamentary way, enable him to carry it on  with vigour. An address was immediately drawn up and presented to the  king, desiring that he would seriously consider the destructive methods  taken of late years by the French king against the trade, quiet, and  interest of the nation, particularly his present invasion of Ireland,  and supporting the rebels in that kingdom. They did not doubt but the  alliances already made, and those that might hereafter be concluded by  his majesty, would be sufficient to reduce the French king to such a  condition, that it should not be in his power to violate the peace of  Christendom, nor prejudice the trade and prosperity of England; in the  mean time they assured his majesty he might depend upon the assistance  of his parliament, according to the vote which had passed in the house  of commons. This was a welcome address to king William. He assured them  that no part of the supplies which they might grant for the prosecution  of the war should be misapplied; and, on the seventh day of May, he  declared war against the French monarch. On this occasion, Louis was  charged with having ambitiously invaded the territories of the emperor,  and denounced war against the allies of England, in violation of the  treaties confirmed under the guarantee of the English crown; with  having encroached upon the fishery of Newfoundland, invaded the Caribbee  Islands, taken forcible possession of New-York and Hudson's-bay, made  depredations on the English at sea, prohibited the importation of  English manufactures, disputed the right of the flag, persecuted many  English subjects on account of religion, contrary to express treaties  and the law of nations, and sent an armament to Ireland, in support of  the rebels of that kingdom.          PROCEEDINGS IN THE CONVENTION.    Having thus described the progress of the revolution in England, we  shall now briefly explain the measures that were prosecuted in Scotland,  towards the establishment of William on the throne of that kingdom. The  meeting of the Scottish convention was fixed for the fourteenth day of  March; and both parties employed all their interest to influence the  election of members. The duke of Hamilton, and all the presbyterians,  declared for William. The duke of Gordon maintained the castle of  Edinburgh for his old master; but, as he had neglected to lay in a store  of provisions, he depended entirely upon the citizens for subsistence.  The partisans of James were headed by the earl of Balcarras, and Graham  viscount Dundee, who employed their endeavours to preserve union among  the individuals of their party; to confirm the duke of Gordon, who  began to waver in his attachment to their sovereign; and to manage their  intrigues in such a manner as to derive some advantage to their cause  from the transactions of the ensuing session. When the lords and commons  assembled at Edinburgh, the bishop of that diocese, who officiated as  chaplain to the convention, prayed for the restoration of king James.  The first dispute turned upon the choice of a president. The friends of  the late king set up the marquis of Athol in opposition to the duke of  Hamilton; but this last was elected by a considerable majority; and  a good number of the other party, finding their cause the weakest,  deserted it from that moment. The earls of Lothian and Tweedale were  sent as deputies, to require the duke of Gordon, in the name of the  estates, to quit the castle in four-and-twenty hours, and leave the  charge of it to the protestant officer next in command. The duke, though  in himself irresolute, was animated by Dundee to demand such conditions  as the convention would not grant. The negociation proving ineffectual,  the states ordered the heralds, in all their formalities, to summon him  to surrender the castle immediately, on pain of incurring the penalties  of high treason; and he refusing to obey their mandate, was proclaimed  a traitor. All persons were forbid, under the same penalties, to aid,  succour, or correspond with him; and the castle was blocked up with the  troops of the city.          LETTERS TO THE CONVENTION FROM KING WILLIAM AND KING JAMES.    Next day an express arrived from London, with a letter from king William  to the estates; and, at the same time, another from James was presented  by one Crane, an English domestic of the abdicated queen. William  observed that he had called a meeting of their estates at the desire of  the nobility and gentry of Scotland assembled at London, who requested  that he would take upon himself the administration of their affairs. He  exhorted them to concert measures for settling the peace of the kingdom  upon a solid foundation; and to lay aside animosities and factions,  which served only to impede that salutary settlement. He professed  himself sensible of the good effects that would arise from an union of  the two kingdoms; and assured them he would use his best endeavours  to promote such a coalition. A committee being appointed to draw up a  respectful answer to these assurances, a debate ensued about the letter  from the late king James. This they resolved to favour with a reading,  after the members should have subscribed an act, declaring that  notwithstanding any thing that might be contained in the letter for  dissolving the convention, or impeding their procedure, they were a free  and lawful meeting of the states; and would continue undissolved until  they should have settled and secured the protestant religion, the  government, laws, and liberties of the kingdom. Having taken this  precaution, they proceeded to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19218"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol.III. (#5)"],[1," conquest of the islands of Belleisle and Dominica: and by the reduction  of Pondicherry, which has in a manner annihilated the French power in  the East Indies. In other parts, where the enemy's numbers were greatly  superior, their principal designs and projects have been generally  disappointed, by a conduct which does the highest honour to the  distinguished capacity of my general, Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick, and  by the valour of my troops. The magnanimity and ability of the King of  Prussia have eminently appeared in resisting such numerous armies, and  surmounting so great difficulties.    \"In this situation I am glad to have an opportunity of receiving the  truest information of the sense of my people by a new choice of their  representatives: I am fully persuaded you will agree with me in opinion,  that the steady exertion of our most vigorous efforts, in every part  where the enemy may still be attacked with advantage, is the only means  that can be productive of such a peace as may with reason be expected  from our successes. It is therefore my fixed resolution, with your  concurrence and support, to carry on the war in the most effectual  manner, for the interest and advantage of my kingdoms; and to maintain  to the utmost of my power the good faith and honour of my crown, by  adhering firmly to the engagements entered into with my allies. In  this I will persevere until my enemies, moved by their own losses and  distresses, and touched with the miseries of so many nations, shall  yield to the equitable conditions of an honourable peace: in which  case, as well as in the prosecution of the war, I do assure you, no  consideration whatever shall make me depart from the true interests of  these my kingdoms, and the honour and dignity of my crown.\"    His majesty concluded his speech by calling upon the commons for  adequate supplies to enable him to prosecute the war with vigour, and by  asking for a provision for the queen in case she should survive him. The  commons, besides the usual address, sent a message of congratulation to  the queen, and they proved the sincerity of their professions by making  her a grant of L100,000 per annum, with Somerset House and the Lodge in  Richmond Park annexed: a patent also passed the privy seal, granting her  majesty the yearly sum of L40,000 for the support of her dignity. On the  subject of the supplies for the ensuing year, however, a long and  stormy debate took place; and a month elapsed before they were finally  adjusted. Opposition to them chiefly arose from the circumstance that  the sentiments of the people, and likewise of the court, were beginning  to change respecting the German war. But Lord Egremont found himself  compelled to walk in the very steps which Pitt had marked out, at  least for some time, and the large demands made were pressed upon the  parliament, and finally received its sanction. Seventy thousand seamen  were voted, and it was agreed to maintain 67,676 effective men, beside  the militia of England, two regiments of fencibles in Scotland, the  provincial troops in America, and 67,167 German auxiliaries. Some new  taxes, also, were imposed, including an additional one on windows, and  an increased duty on spirituous liquors, in order to pay the interest  of L12,000,000, which it was found necessary to borrow, to make good  the deficiences of last session. In the whole the supplies for the year  1762, voted by the parliament, amounted to more than L18,000,000: two  millions of which were required for the defence of Portugal.    {GEORGE III. 1760-1765}          DISTURBANCES IN IRELAND.    In the month of October, Lord Halifax, the new Lord-lieutenant of  Ireland met his Majesty's first parliament in that country. The Irish  parliament responded to the sentiments of the English parliament  respecting the accession of the young monarch. Addresses replete with  loyalty were voted by both houses; and the greatest confidence was  expressed in the rule of Lord Halifax, auguring the happiest results  from his administration, and promising cordial co-operation. That  ill-fated country, however, was restless as the waves of the ocean.  During the viceroyalty of the Duke of Bedford, it had been totally  under the dominion of the lord's justices, and they had recently made  an attempt to gain popularity, by expressing doubts in the privy  council concerning the propriety of sending over a money bill, lest the  rejection of it should occasion the dissolution of the new parliament,  and thereby endanger the peace of the country. They were opposed in  their views by Lord Chancellor Bowes and his party, and party violence  was inflamed to the highest pitch. The popular coalition prevailed so  far as to alter the established custom, by sending a bill not for the  actual supplies, but relating to a vote of credit for Ireland, whence  all ferment on this subject subsided. In such a contest it is not likely  that the people would have joined, but they had grievances of their  own, which endangered the public tranquillity. In his speech to the new  parliament, Lord Halifax had recommended that the linen trade, which had  been confined to the southern parts of the kingdom, should be extended  throughout the country, inasmuch as there was a large demand for it, and  it might thereby be made a source of wealth to the whole country. True  patriots would have observed the wisdom of, and have acquiesced in, this  measure; but self-interest in Ireland, as in all countries under the  face of the sun, prevailed over the feelings of patriotism. The people  in the southern parts of the kingdom murmured at such a project, as  it would affect their personal interests, and their discontents were  increased by the conversion of considerable quantities of land from a  state of tillage to that of pasturage, for the purpose of feeding more  cattle. By this measure, great numbers of the peasantry were deprived  at once, not only of employment, but of their cottages. Many small farms  were indeed still let to some cottagers at rack-rent, which cottages  had the right of commonage, guaranteed to them in their leases; but  afterwards the commons were enclosed, and no recompense was made to the  tenants by the landlords. Thus provoked, and being joined by the idle  and dissolute, these unhappy people sought to redress their own wrongs  by acts of violence. Fences were destroyed, horses and arms were  seized, cattle were maltreated, and obnoxious persons, especially  tithe-proctors, were exposed to their vengeance. Many were stripped  naked, and made to ride on horses with saddles formed of the skins of  hedgehogs, or buried up to their chins in holes lined with thorns  that were trodden down closely to their bodies. From their outrageous  violence these people obtained the name of \"Levellers,\" but afterwards,  from the circumstance of their wearing white shirts over their clothes  for the purpose of disguise, they were termed \"White Boys.\" Their  outrages demanded the strong arm of the law, and the royal troops were  employed in their suppression. Many suffered the extreme penalty of the  law, though many more were permitted to escape through the lenity of  the judges, whence the disorders long prevailed. As the rioters were  all Romanists, a popish plot was suspected, and the Romish clergy were  charged with promoting their outrages. A motion was made in parliament  to investigate this matter, but there not being sufficient evidence  to inculpate any parties, it was dropped, and no efficient remedy was  therefore applied to heal the disorder.          WAR WITH SPAIN.    The year had not closed before the ministers found that a rupture with  Spain was inevitable. The first intimation of it was detected in the  menacing conduct of the court of Versailles; and Lord Bristol, the  English ambassador at Madrid, was instructed to demand the real  intentions of Charles III., and the real purport of the family compact.  General Wall, the Spanish minister replied more insolently than before;  but an open rupture was avoided till the plate-ships had arrived at  Cadiz with all the wealth expected from Spanish America. Then it was  seen that the political vision of Pitt could penetrate much deeper than  that of Bute and his colleagues. Complaining of the haughty spirit and  the discord which prevailed in the British cabinet, and of the insults  offered to his sovereign, Wall informed Bristol that he might leave  Spain as soon as he pleased, and at the same time issued orders to  detain all English ships then in the ports of Spain. Lord Bristol  returned; the Count of Fuentes, the Spanish ambassador, quitted London,  and war was mutually declared by both countries.    The declaration of war was made on the 4th of January, and on the 19th  parliament met after its adjournment, when the king informed both houses  of the measures he had been compelled to adopt. The members of both  houses were unanimous in their approbation of his majesty's conduct,  and in assurances of vigorous support. The consideration of the  intelligence, notwithstanding, caused a stormy debate, but as no regular  opposition was organized, and government was supported by Pitt, clamour  died away, and the war met with general approbation. In the house  of lords, a motion was made reprobating the expense of the German  campaigns, and recommending a recall of the British troops for the  security of our own dominions; but it was strongly opposed, and the  previous question was carried by a large majority. Preparations were  therefore made for war with Spain, without diminishing the expenses  of the war in Germany; and while fresh troops were enlisted, some wise  alterations were made by parliament in the militia laws, by which a  line was drawn between those persons liable to serve, and such as were  exempt.    Operations were commenced in the Havannah. On the 5th of March, an  expedition sailed under the command of"]]]
