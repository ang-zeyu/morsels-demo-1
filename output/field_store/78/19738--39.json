THE IDEA OF SELECTION    Many and diverse were the discoveries made by Charles Darwin in the  course of a long and strenuous life, but none of them has had so  far-reaching an influence on the science and thought of his time as  the theory of selection. I do not believe that the theory of evolution  would have made its way so easily and so quickly after Darwin took up  the cudgels in favour of it if he had not been able to support it by a  principle which was capable of solving, in a simple manner, the  greatest riddle that living nature presents to us,--I mean the  purposiveness of every living form relative to the conditions of its  life and its marvellously exact adaptation to these.    Everyone knows that Darwin was not alone in discovering the principle  of selection, and that the same idea occurred simultaneously and  independently to Alfred Russel Wallace. At the memorable meeting of  the Linnean Society on 1st July, 1858, two papers were read  (communicated by Lyell and Hooker) both setting forth the same idea of  selection. One was written by Charles Darwin in Kent, the other by  Alfred Wallace in Ternate, in the Malay Archipelago. It was a splendid  proof of the magnanimity of these two investigators, that they thus in  all friendliness and without envy, united in laying their ideas  before a scientific tribunal: their names will always shine side by  side as two of the brightest stars in the scientific sky.    The idea of selection set forth by the two naturalists was at the time  absolutely new, but it was also so simple that Huxley could say of it  later, \"How extremely stupid not to have thought of that.\" As Darwin  was led to the general doctrine of descent, not through the labours of  his predecessors in the early years of the century, but by his own  observations, so it was in regard to the principle of selection. He  was struck by the innumerable cases of adaptation, as, for instance,  that of the woodpeckers and tree-frogs to climbing, or the hooks and  feather-like appendages of seeds, which aid in the distribution of  plants, and he said to himself that an explanation of adaptations was  the first thing to be sought for in attempting to formulate a theory  of evolution.    But since adaptations point to _changes_ which have been undergone by  the ancestral forms of existing species, it is necessary, first of  all, to inquire how far species in general are _variable_. Thus  Darwin's attention was directed in the first place to the phenomenon  of variability, and the use man has made of this, from very early  times, in the breeding of his domesticated animals and cultivated  plants. He inquired carefully how breeders set to work, when they  wished to modify the structure and appearance of a species to their  own ends, and it was soon clear to him that _selection for breeding  purposes_ played the chief part.    But how was it possible that such processes should occur in free  nature? Who is here the breeder, making the selection, choosing out  one individual to bring forth offspring and rejecting others? That was  the problem that for a long time remained a riddle to him.    Darwin himself relates how illumination suddenly came to him. He had  been reading, for his own pleasure, Malthus' book on Population, and,  as he had long known from numerous observations, that every species  gives rise to many more descendants than ever attain to maturity, and  that, therefore, the greater number of the descendants of a species  perish without reproducing, the idea came to him that the decision as  to which member of a species was to perish and which was to attain to  maturity and reproduction might not be a matter of chance, but might  be determined by the constitution of the individuals themselves,  according as they were more or less fitted for survival. With this  idea the foundation of the theory of selection was laid.    In _artificial selection_ the breeder chooses out for pairing only  such individuals as possess the character desired by him in a somewhat  higher degree than the rest of the race. Some of the descendants  inherit this character, often in a still higher degree, and if this  method be pursued throughout several generations, the race is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22460"],[0,"New York Times Current History; The European War, Vol 2, No. 5, August, 1915 (#5)"],[1,"Americans and  neutral countries was not permitted.\"    In conclusion, the Austro-Hungarian Government appeals to the United  States, calling attention to the uninterrupted good relations and  friendship between that country and the dual monarchy, to take the  present note under careful consideration.      WHY AUSTRIA ACTED    _A dispatch from Vienna, via London, dated July 16, gives the  following information from The Associated Press:_    From a highly authoritative source at the Foreign Office a  representative of The Associated Press has received an explanation of  the motives that are said to have inspired the dispatch of the  Austro-Hungarian note to the United States regarding the American  traffic in war munitions.    The Austro-Hungarian statesman who spoke said that, although the facts  upon which the note was based had been in existence for a long time,  the communication was sent only now, when, after great victories in  Galicia, it could not be interpreted as a cry for help from a land in  distress. He disavowed in advance any idea that the note was sent at  the request or inspiration of Germany, asserting that the step was  taken spontaneously in the hope that, owing to the undisturbed  friendly relations between Austria-Hungary and the United States, the  note would be assured a sympathetic reception in the latter country.    \"The note,\" said this statesman, \"is inspired by friendly feelings of  the monarchy toward the Union, where so many of our subjects have  found a second home. It is the speech of a friend to a friend--an  attitude which we are the more justified in taking because the  relations of the two states have never been clouded.    \"It might, perhaps, easily be a source of wonder that, since the basic  grounds of the note have been in existence for months, the note was  not sent long ago; but there is a reason for its appearance at this  particular time. In view of the incredible rumors and reports about  the condition of the monarchy which have been circulating throughout  the United States, this note would surely have been interpreted at an  earlier stage of events as a confession of weakness, as an appeal for  help in distress. Today, when a rich harvest is being garnered  throughout the monarchy, when talk of starving out Austria-Hungary  therefore is rendered idle, when complaints of shortage of ammunition  are heard everywhere else except in the allied central monarchies,  there cannot be the slightest question of this.    \"On the other hand, it might be asked why the note, under these  conditions, was issued at all. With nothing to check the victorious  progress of the central powers in sight, with their ability to meet  pressure in the economic field demonstrated, it might well be thought  that it is a matter of indifference to them whether America continues  her policy or not. That, however, is not the case. The problems of  international law which this war has brought up are of far-reaching  importance. The solutions reached will be standards of action for  decades to come.    \"For eminently practical as well as theoretical reasons, therefore,  the monarchy is forced now not only to concern itself with the  questions of the day, but also to feel its responsibility toward the  future interests of mankind; and for this reason the Government  thought it necessary to approach the subject under discussion--the  more so because it felt that the previous debate pro and con had not,  as it wished, led to the desired result, and because it believed that  numbers of arguments specially laid down in The Hague Convention  hitherto had escaped consideration.    \"It may, of course, be assumed that the note is a product of mature  consideration, and was drafted after consultation with international  law experts of the first rank. The absence of the slightest hostile  intent in it against the Union is shown not only by the opening  phrases, but by the fact that it was published only after it leaked  out in the United States that there was no objection to its  publication.    \"The question of whether Austria-Hungary feels that she is being cut  off by America may be answered unreservedly in the affirmative. The  military monarchy can and will continue the war as long as necessary.  The population will, as hitherto, suffer neither starvation nor  material want. But there are other interests than those connected  primarily with war which every Government is bound to consider, and  unhampered trade relations with the United States are of the greatest  importance to us.    \"Finally, not only material, also I might say sentimental, interests  play a certain role not to be underestimated among the people. Many  warm friends of America among us are painfully affected by the fact  that actual conditions give the impression that America, even though  unintentionally, differentiates between the belligerents.    \"Austro-Hungarian statesmen, conscious of the great role that America  will be called upon to play in the future, would forget their duty if  they neglected to do everything in their power to clear away the  circumstances that shake the confidence of the bravely fighting armies  and the whole population in the justice of America. It is clear that  the war would have been ended long ago if America had not supplied our  enemies with the means of continuing it.    \"The assumption that the Austro-Hungarian note was sent at the wish of  the German Government is incorrect. On the contrary, it is a  completely spontaneous demonstration, inspired wholly by the  Austro-Hungarian considerations. We hope it will be received and  judged in America in the same spirit in which it was sent.\"      MR. WOOLSEY'S OPINION    _Theodore S. Woolsey, formerly Professor of International Law at Yale  University, in Leslie's Weekly, for July 29, has an article entitled  \"The Case for the Munitions Trade.\" In part Professor Woolsey says:_    In the midst of widespread industrial depression came a great war.  This war intensified the depression. It cut off markets, raised  freights, retarded payments, upset the whole commercial world and we  suffered with the rest. Then shortly came a demand for certain  products and certain manufactures caused by the war itself, varied,  considerable, even unexpected. This demand grew until it became an  appreciable factor in our industrial life, a welcome source of profit  when so many other sources of profit were cut off. It was a good  thing; at the same time it was a temporary, unnatural thing, and  directly or indirectly it was based upon the desire of some of our  friends to kill others of our friends. Accordingly people began to  give this trade bad names. They called it unneutral, wrong, inhuman.    For the sake of our pockets we were adding to the sum of human  suffering and slaughter, and they urged that, even if legally  justified, ethically this trade was a blot upon our character as a  humane and civilized people and must be stopped. Where does the truth  lie? What can the munitions trade say for itself?    Naturally, it turns for justification first to the usage of other  wars, to the recognized rules of international law. As expressed in  Article 7, Convention XIII, of the 1907 Conference at The Hague, the  law is as follows:    \"A neutral power is not bound to prevent the export or transit, for  the use of either belligerent, of arms, ammunitions or, in general, of  anything which could be of use to an army or fleet.\"    The next previous article had prohibited a Government from engaging in  this trade, so that the distinction between what the State and the  individual may do is made perfectly clear, provided both belligerents  are treated alike. To permit trade in arms with one belligerent and  forbid it with another would be unneutral and illegal.    We permit the munitions trade with both belligerents, it is true, and  yet, owing to the chances of war, the right to buy inures to the  advantage of one only. Does this stamp our conduct as unneutral? Quite  the contrary. To embargo munitions bought by one because the other  side does not choose to buy would be the unneutral act. Germany  doesn't buy because she cannot transport.    She cannot transport, because she does not care to contest the  control of the sea with her enemies. Have we aught to do with that? To  supplement her naval inferiority by denying to the Allies the fruits  of their superiority would be equivalent to sharing in the war on the  German side. Moreover, to assume and base action upon German naval  inferiority in advance of any general trial of strength would be not  only illegal, but even an insult to Germany. Notice that no complaints  of our export of munitions have come from the German Government. To  make such complaint would be to plead the baby act. Rather than risk  her fleet by contesting the control of the sea, thus gaining her share  of munitions imports, Germany has chosen to withdraw it behind  fortifications, thus losing the munitions trade. Probably the decision  is a sound one, but she must accept the results.    The opposition to the trade seems to come from two classes:    (1) German sympathizers who seek to minimize the advantage which sea  power gives the Allies.    (2) Those who are governed by their emotions rather than by reason and  respect for law. I would call the attention of both these classes to  the usage, especially to the German usage, in other wars.    Professor Gregory, in an interesting article, gives statistics of the  large German exports of arms to the British forces in the Boer war  after the Boer trade had been cut off. In the Russo-Japanese war Krupp  notoriously supplied both sides. In the Balkan war there was said to  be competition between Krupp and Creusot in furnishing cannon. No  state in the nature of things can satisfy its needs in war completely  from its own resources. Every belligerent has bought, every neutral  has allowed its citizens"]]]
