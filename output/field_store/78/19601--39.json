The Ponka used to make arrowshafts (ma^{n}sa) of ja^{n}-[']qude-hi,  \"gray wood,\" juneberry wood, which grew in their country, but is not  found among the Omaha. Most of the Omaha made their shafts of the  ma^n'saqtihi, or \"real arrow-wood,\" (<i>Viburnum</i>) as that was the wood  best suited for the purpose. Sometimes they were made of chokecherry  wood; and Joseph LaFleche informs me that he has made them of ash and  hickory.    Arrowshafts were held lengthwise directly in a line with the eyes of the  workman, who sighted along them to see if they were straight. If one was  bent, he held one end of it between his teeth, while he pressed against  the rest of it with his hands. They were polished by means of the  polishers, or ma^{n}[']-[|c]iq[|c]ade, two pieces of sandstone, each of  which had a groove in the middle of one side. These grooves were  brought together, and the arrow was drawn between them.    War arrows had crooked lines drawn along the shafts from the points to  the other ends, down which, so I was informed by the Indians, it was  intended that the blood of a wounded foe should trickle.    Arrowheads (mahi^{n}-si), when made of flint, as at the first, were  called \"i^{n}['][,][(e] mahi^{n}si,\" stone arrowheads. In more recent  times, they were manufactured of pieces of sheet iron; as, for example,  hoops of pails and barrels.    Arrow cement (hi^{n}[']pa), for attaching the heads to the shafts, was  usually made from the skin taken off a buffalo or elk head. This was  boiled a long time, till ready to fall to pieces. When the gelatinous  matter forming the cement rose to the top of the water, a stick (called  hi^{n}pa-ja^{n}jin[']ga) was thrust in and turned round and round,  causing the material to be wrapped around it. When cooled it was  smoothed with the hand. Then the act was repeated till a large quantity  was collected on the stick. When needed for use, it was warmed by  placing either in the mouth or in hot water. The skin of the big turtle  was also used for making cement.    A set of arrows were called, collectively, \"ma^{n}wi^{n}[']da^{n}.\" A  set generally consisted of ten arrows, but the number varied; sometimes  there were two, four, or even twenty. When a man had arrows left in his  quiver, he compared them with that which was in the slain animal. When  he had none left, he appealed to some one who knew his style of arrow.    There were no clan or gentile marks on arrows. One set was distinguished  from another by the order of the paint stripes on them, by the kind of  feathers used, by the mode in which the arrowheads were made, etc. The  Oto made bad arrows; those of the Pawnee were better, but they were  inferior to those made by the Dakota, Ponka, and Omaha.    The feathers, half-webs generally, put on arrows were those of the  eagle, buzzard, wild turkey, great owl, and goose. Sometimes hawk or  crow feathers were employed.      Quivers.    Quivers (ma^{n}[']jiha) for men were made of buffalo hide; but boys'  quivers were made either of otter skins or of the skins of cougars, with  the tail of the animal hanging down from the upper extremity. A skin  case was attached to the quiver for carrying the bow when not in use.  The wrist was defended from the percussion of the bowstring by the  leather wristguard or aqande-[p]a.      Shields and Armor.    Shields ([t]ahawag[|c]e) were made of the hides of buffalo bulls. They  were round and very thick, reaching to the waist of the bearer. Arrows  did not penetrate them. Joseph La Fleche never heard of the use of  defensive armor, such as helmet and mail, among the Omaha and Ponka.    He had heard of a Pawnee who made a coat from four elk skins, two  forming the front and two the back. Between each pair of skins was  placed sand. A helmet was made in like manner. It covered the back of  the head and extended over the forehead, coming down as far as the eyes.  When the Pawnee noticed an arrow coming toward him, he bowed his head  forward.      Firearms.    Firearms were introduced among the Omaha prior to 1819, when Dougherty  says that they preferred those called \"Mackinaw guns.\"          INDEX.
