[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21677"],[0,"Milton (#5)"],[1," rebellious to the lawes,      Your greatest crime was harmelesse honest mirth;    What fell malignant spirit was there found      To cast your tall _Piramides_ to ground?    *      *      *      *      *      And you my native towne, which was of old,      (When as thy Bon-fires burn'd and May-poles stood,    And when thy Wassell-cups were uncontrol'd)      The Summer Bower of Peace and neighbourhood,    Although since these went down, thou ly'st forlorn,    By factious schismes and humours over-borne,    Some able hand I hope thy rod will raise,    That thou maist see once more thy happy daies.    The hopes of the bard of Leeds were fulfilled at the Restoration.  Merriment, of a sort, came back to England; but it found no congenial  acceptance from Milton. The Court roysterers, the Hectors, Nickers,  Scourers, and Mohocks, among whom were numbered Sedley and Rochester, and  others of the best poets of the day, are celebrated by him incidentally  in those lines, unsurpassable for sombre magnificence, which he appends  to his account of Belial--      In courts and palaces he also reigns,    And in luxurious cities, where the noise    Of riot ascends above their loftiest towers,    And injury and outrage; and, when night    Darkens the streets, then wander forth the sons    Of Belial, flown with insolence and wine.    The public festivals of these later days are glanced at in _Samson  Agonistes_--          Lords are lordliest in their wine;    And the well-feasted priest then soonest fired    With zeal, if aught religion seem concerned;    No less the people on their holy-days    Impetuous, insolent, unquenchable.    There is no relaxation, no trace of innocent lightheartedness, in any of  the later poems. Even the garden of Paradise, where some gentle mirth  might perhaps be permissible, is tenanted by grave livers, majestic, but  not sprightly. In _L' Allegro_ the morning song of the milk-maid is  \"blithe,\" and the music of the village dance is \"jocund.\" But Eve is  described as \"jocund\" and \"blithe\" only when she is intoxicated by the  mortal fruit of the tree; and the note of gaiety that is heard faintly,  like a distant echo, in the earlier poems, is never sounded again by  Milton.    So it is also with other things. The flowers scattered on the laureate  hearse of Lycidas make a brighter, more various, and withal a homelier  display than ever meets the eye in the Hesperian wildernesses of Eden. Or  take the world of fairy lore that Milton inherited from the  Elizabethans--a world to which not only Shakespeare, but also laborious  and arrogant poet-scholars like Jonson and Drayton had free right of  entry. Milton, too, could write of the fairies--in his youth--      With stories told of many a feat,    How Faery Mab the junkets eat.    But even in _Comus_ the most exquisite passage of fairy description is  put into the mouth of Comus himself, chief of the band of ugly-headed  monsters in glistering apparel--      The sounds and seas, with all their finny drove,    Now to the moon in wavering morrice move;    And on the tawny sands and shelves    Trip the pert fairies and the dapper elves.    By dimpled brook and fountain-brim,    The wood-nymphs decked with daisies trim,    Their merry wakes and pastimes keep:    What hath night to do with sleep?    The song and the dance are broken off, never to be resumed, when the  staid footfall of the lady is heard approaching. Milton cannot draw  ugliness; it turns into beauty or majesty on his hands. Satan has a large  and enthusiastic party among readers of _Paradise Lost_. Comus, we are  told, stands for a whole array of ugly vices--riot, intemperance,  gluttony, and luxury. But what a delicate monster he is, and what a  ravishing lyric strain he is master of! The pleasure that Milton forswore  was a young god, the companion of Love and Youth, not an aged Silenus  among the wine-skins. He viewed and described one whole realm of pagan  loveliness, and then he turned his face the other way, and never looked  back. Love is of the valley, and he lifted his eyes to the hills. His  guiding star was not Christianity, which in its most characteristic and  beautiful aspects had no fascination for him, but rather that severe and  self-centred ideal of life and character which is called Puritanism. It  is not a creed for weak natures; so that as the nominal religion of a  whole populace it has inevitably fallen into some well-merited disrepute.  Puritanism for him was not a body of law to be imposed outwardly on a  gross and timid people, but an inspiration and a grace that falls from  Heaven upon choice and rare natures--      Nor do I name of men the common rout,    That, wandering loose about,    Grow up and perish as the summer fly,    Heads without name, no more remember'd;    so sings the Chorus in _Samson Agonistes_--      But such as thou hast solemnly elected,    With gifts and graces eminently adorned,    To some great work, thy glory,    And people's safety, which in part they effect.    Under one form or another Puritanism is to be found in almost all  religions, and in many systems of philosophy. Milton's Puritanism enabled  him to combine his classical and Biblical studies, to reconcile his pagan  and Christian admirations, Stoicism, and the Quakers. It was with no  sense of incongruity that he gave to the Christ a speech in praise of--      Quintus, Fabricius, Curius, Regulus,...    Who could do mighty things, and could contemn    Riches, though offered from the hand of Kings.    To reject common ambitions, to refuse common enticements, to rule  passions, desires, and fears, \"neither to change, nor falter, nor  repent,\"--this was the wisdom and this the virtue that he set before  himself. There is no beatific vision to keep his eyes from wandering  among the shows of earth. Milton's heaven is colder than his earth, the  home of Titans, whose employ is political and martial. When his  imagination deals with earthly realities, the noble melancholy of the  Greeks lies upon it. His last word on human life might be translated into  Greek with no straining and no loss of meaning--      His servants He, with new acquist    Of true experience from this great event,    With peace and consolation hath dismissed,    And calm of mind, all passion spent.    He is therefore one of the few English poets (alone in this respect among  the greatest) who have not sung of Love. His only English love-poem, the  sonnet _To the Nightingale_, is his earliest and poorest sonnet. He  elected in his later poems to sing of Marriage, its foundation in reason,  its utility, its respectability and antiquity as an institution, and,  above all, its amazing dangers. He has thus lost the devotion of the  young, who, while they read poetry by the ear and eye for its sonorous  suggestions, and its processions of vague shapes, love Milton; but when  they come to read it for its matter and sentiment, leave him--in most  cases never to return. The atmosphere of his later poems is that of some  great public institution. Heaven is an Oriental despotism. Hell is a  Secession parliament. In the happy garden itself there is no privacy, no  individualism; it is the focus of the action, the central point of the  attack and the defence; and a great part of the conversation of its  inhabitants turns on the regulations under which they live. They never  forget that they are all mankind, and when their psalm goes up in  grateful adoration to their Creator, it is like the unanimous voice of  all nations and kindreds and people and tongues.    \"The plan of _Paradise Lost_\" says Johnson, \"has this inconvenience, that  it comprises neither human actions nor human manners. The man and woman  who act and suffer are in a state which no other man and woman can ever  know. The reader finds no transaction in which he can be engaged; beholds  no condition in which he can by any effort of imagination place himself;  he has, therefore, little natural curiosity and sympathy.\" Milton, he  goes on to explain, \"knew human nature only in the gross, and had never  studied the shades of character, nor the combinations of concurring or  the perplexity of contending passions.\"    He knew human nature only in the gross. He treated nothing less momentous  than the fortunes of the race. It is precisely from this cause that the  incomparable grandeur of Milton's characters and situations springs. The  conversations that he records are like international parleyings. Eve is  the official Mother of mankind. Adam walks forth to meet the angel, in  ambassadorial dignity, the accredited representative of the human race--              Without more train    Accompanied than with his own complete    Perfections; in himself was all his state,    More solemn than the tedious pomp that waits    On princes, when their rich retinue long    Of horses led and grooms besmeared with gold    Dazzles the crowd and sets them all agape.    And if the other characters of _Paradise Lost_ have this generic stamp,  it is because the chief character of all has it--the character of the  poet himself. It lends a strange dignity to the story of Milton's life  that in all his doings he felt himself to be a \"cause,\" an agent of  mighty purposes. This it is that more than excuses, it glorifies, his  repeated magniloquent allusions to himself throughout the prose works.  Holding himself on trust or on commission, he must needs report himself,  not only to his great Taskmaster, but also from time to time to men, his  expectant and impatient beneficiaries. Even in _Lycidas_ he is thinking  of himself as much as of his dead companion--      So may some gentle Muse    With lucky words favour _my_ destined urn,    And as he passes turn,    And bid fair peace be to my sable shroud.    What if he die young himself? Are his dreams and hopes for his own future  an illusion? He agonises with the question in the famous digression on  poetry and poetic fame. But he consoles"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21687"],[0,"The Youngest Girl in the Fifth: A School Story (#5)"],[1," Edith Arnold and a few more 'the  Saints'.\"    \"Nothing very saintly about them that I can see!\" sniffed Gwen.    \"Well, it depends on your standards. Perhaps they thought they behaved  like saints at dinner.\"    \"More like Pharisees! Which are you?\"    Netta's brown eyes twinkled.    \"I leave you to guess!\" she replied sagely. \"I'm not stiff and  stand-off like some of them are, at any rate. If you'd care to take a  walk down the corridor, I'll go with you.\"    A stroll with anyone was better than sitting alone in the classroom;  it was still only two o'clock, and there was half an hour to get  through before afternoon school began. Gwen was not averse to  exploring the upper corridor, for as a Junior it had been forbidden  ground to her. She and Netta went into the Sixth Form room, the Senior  French and German room, and even looked inside the teachers' room,  finding nobody there.    \"Miss Roscoe's private sitting-room is at the end of the passage,\"  said Netta. \"She's down in the library, so if you like to take a peep,  you can.\"    The spirit of curiosity strongly urged Gwen to see what a  headmistress's private study was like, and thinking themselves  perfectly safe, the two girls entered, and began eagerly to scan the  pictures, the ornaments, the photographs, and the various objects  which were spread about on desk and tables. It was a pretty, tasteful  room, with choice prints from the old masters in carved oak frames,  and pots of ferns and flowers, and handsomely bound books, and curios  from foreign lands. The girls moved softly about, examining first one  thing and then another with increasing interest.    \"Oh, do look at this exquisite little case of butterflies! I never saw  anything so perfect!\" said Netta.    Gwen was standing absorbed in contemplation of a stained-wood blotter.  She wheeled round, and as she did so her elbow knocked a parcel that  had been placed on the corner of the desk, and sent it flying on to  the floor. There was a smashing sound like the breaking of china, and  at that exact moment somebody entered the room. Hopelessly caught, the  two girls turned to face the newcomer. It was not Miss Roscoe--that  was one thing to be thankful for--but it was Emma, the housemaid,  which was quite bad enough. She looked at them as if she knew herself  to be mistress of the situation, then waxed eloquent.    \"I should just like to know what you two's doing here?\" she demanded.  \"You've no business in this room--none at all. And you've gone and  smashed that parcel as is only come five minutes ago from the china  shop. I could hear it break. My word! What will Miss Roscoe say to  this?\"    \"She mustn't know!\" gasped Netta. \"Emma, you must promise us  faithfully not to tell you've found us here.\"    \"Me not tell? And what for, please? Why should I screen you?\"    \"We shall get into such an awful scrape!\" pleaded Gwen.    \"You should have thought of that before you came!\"    \"Oh, Emma!\" urged Netta. \"We can't, we daren't let Miss Roscoe know.  She'd be so fearfully angry. She might even expel us!\"    \"And what am I to say about this parcel you've broken? You don't  suppose I'm going to take the blame of that on my shoulders! No, thank  you!\"    \"The cat,\" murmured Netta.    \"Cat, indeed!\" repeated Emma scornfully. \"That's too old a story to  take in Miss Roscoe; besides which, there's not a cat in the house.  She hates 'em. You'll just have to own up, and serve you both right  for meddling.\"    \"Is it badly broken, I wonder?\" sighed Gwen, feeling the unfortunate  parcel carefully. \"It seems to be a box.\"    \"Yes, but what's inside the box is smashed. You can hear the bits  rattle when you shake it,\" returned Emma smartly. \"It's her new  afternoon tea set, I'll be bound. She told me she was going to order  one from Parker's.\"    \"There's Parker's name on the label,\" agreed Gwen despondently.    \"Yes, and if you think--\"    \"Look here, I've got an idea,\" interrupted Netta. \"You said the box  only arrived about five minutes ago, so Miss Roscoe can't possibly  know that it's come yet. If we could get it taken back to the shop  and ask Parker's to send some more, and we pay for it, she need never  know.\"    \"A pretty idea!\" snorted Emma.    \"Oh, it would be grand!\" exclaimed Gwen, grasping at any way out of  the dreadful predicament.    \"You'll help us, Emma, won't you?\" entreated Netta.    \"Not I! It's none of my business.\"    \"But suppose it were worth your while? Wouldn't half a crown buy you  something nice?\"    \"Nothing I'd care for.\"    \"Five shillings, then?\"    Emma's face showed signs of yielding.    \"I don't want to get you into trouble if I can help it,\" she replied  more gently. \"I dare say Parker's would replace the things if you was  willing to pay for them, and nothing need be said. I'm not one for  wanting scenes, and a scene there'd be if Miss Roscoe found her set  broken. She's a sharp tongue, as I know to my cost.\"    \"Then, Emma, will you take away the box now, and hide it somewhere,  and we'll meet you in the pantry at four o'clock, and you can give it  to us, and we'll take it ourselves to Parker's, and ask them to send  some more china to-night. We'll bring you the five shillings to-morrow  morning. It shall be a present from us both, and thank you so much for  helping us! You promise you won't tell? Well, that's a weight off our  minds! Come, Gwen, we'll scoot!\"          CHAPTER IV    A Delicate Transaction      Gwen had stood by, listening to Netta's proposals, and offered no  opposition. She was thankful to find any means of escape from the  terrible prospect of braving Miss Roscoe's wrath. The Principal was a  stern, even a severe woman, who never made allowances or admitted  excuses, and greatly resented any liberties. How would she regard such  an extreme liberty as an unauthorized visit to her private  sitting-room, to say nothing of the accident to the tea service? Gwen  shivered at the bare idea. She was aware that she and her sisters were  received on rather special terms at Rodenhurst. Winnie's teaching  scarcely compensated for the two younger ones' school fees, and did  not include the daily board for the three girls, which was given in by  Miss Roscoe, who knew of Mr. Gascoyne's poor circumstances. For this  reason Gwen had been urged to work her hardest, so as to be a credit  to her Form, and in some degree repay Miss Roscoe's generosity. The  Principal had shown an interest in her, particularly in relaxing an  old-established rule in her favour, and moving her up right in the  middle of a term. If she were detected in such a grave breach of  discipline, Miss Roscoe might consider her unworthy of any further  kindnesses, might even ask her father to take her away altogether from  Rodenhurst. To take her away! Why, the world would come to an end! At  home she was already regarded as the troublesome one of the family,  and if she suffered this disgrace, she could never hold up her head  again. Father--dear, patient, self-sacrificing Father--would be  grieved and worried beyond expression; he hoped great things, she  knew, from her schooling, and how could she bear to disappoint him?    Then there was Beatrice, who always seemed ready to find fault, and  think the worst of her. She would almost as soon let Miss Roscoe know  as Beatrice! No, at all costs the episode of that afternoon must be  kept a strict secret. She dared not confide it even to Winnie or  Lesbia. She must take the burden on her own shoulders, and get out of  the scrape as best she could alone. Netta had assumed the leadership  of the affair, so to Netta she turned for counsel and comfort.    \"What's the next move?\" she asked.    \"Why, we must go to Parker's directly school's over, and take the  parcel with us.\"    \"I shall miss the bus!\"    \"You can't help that; you must catch the next.\"    \"I shall have to dodge Winnie and Lesbia.\"    \"Dodge them, then, and make up some excuse for missing the bus. You  can say I kept you.\"    \"How much do you think the china will cost?\"    \"I haven't the least idea; it depends how much is broken.\"    \"Netta, you won't tell a soul about this, will you?\"    \"Tell! Am I likely to tell? No, you and I are in the same boat, and we  must shield each other. I wouldn't trust anybody in the school. One  never knows how things are talked about and get round from the most  unlikely quarters. Whatever happens, this mustn't reach Miss Roscoe's  ears.\"    The motor omnibus started at 4.20, and as a rule the Gascoynes had  quite a scramble to rush off and catch it. To-day Gwen managed to  avoid Winnie and Lesbia, and waiting until they were safely off the  premises, she went with Netta to the pantry. Emma was not there, but  they found the parcel behind the door and appropriated it, Gwen hiding  it carefully under her waterproof. Parker's china store was in the  principal street of the town, nearly a quarter of an hour's walk from  Rodenhurst. When the girls arrived there, several customers were in  the shop, so that they had to wait a little before anyone could attend  to them.    \"You speak to him--I don't know what to say!\" whispered Gwen,  thrusting the parcel into Netta's hand, as an assistant at last came  to serve them.    Netta had any amount of presence of mind, and did not at all object to  be spokeswoman. She rapidly explained that they had had an accident,  and were anxious to replace some broken articles at their own expense.  The shopman opened the box, and pulling out the shavings in which the  china was packed, laid the various pieces upon the counter. The girls  were aghast at the extent of the damage. Several cups were smashed to  atoms, the teapot had lost its lid, and the cream jug its handle.    \"Have you any more like them?\" asked Netta anxiously.    \"Fortunately we have, miss,\" replied the assistant. \"It is a pattern  we usually keep in stock, and--yes, I can match them all. I can repack  the box and send it out by the six-o'clock van.\"    Gwen"]]]
