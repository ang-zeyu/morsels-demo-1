In the chapel, near       the statue of St. Nepomucenus, upon a stone bench, sat a       large-sized man, with the pale serious face of Germanic type. Every       physiognomist, looking at him, would have said that this man had       devoted his youth to serious scientific work and that he had spent       many sleepless nights over books.         \"The clock had just struck ten when upon the bridge appeared a man       in a light summer coat, of about the same age as the young       scientist. His face was pale, of waxen color, without the slightest       natural red in his cheeks; his particularly prominent nose       indicated his Jewish extraction; his forehead was high and large,       his head was strongly developed. He walked straight over to the man       who was waiting and who quickly arose.         \"'Good evening. I see you have received my letter. Have you it with       you?'         \"'Yes, I know it by heart, I have read it so many times. \"My       friend,\" it is written there, \"I have promised to give you the key       to the Caballah, if I ever find the opportunity to do so. Although       I am not always in the habit of fulfilling my vows, I am ready to       fulfil this one, if you will wait for me in the evening of October       8, in Prague, on the old Moldau bridge, under the statue of       Nepomucenus.\" Then follows your name.'         \"'Yes, that is correct. Have you not yet given up your desire?'         \"'Less than ever before! You would render science an invaluable       service.'         \"'Listen, doctor, bend down a little over the rail; that of which       we speak must not be heard even by the waves of the Moldau, if we       wish to remain alive.'         \"The young scientist looked in astonishment at his comrade, but did       as he desired.         \"'Three years ago, in Rome, when I promised to acquaint you with       the mysteries of the Caballah, I did it more for the sake of       boasting of a power and authority which, in reality, I did not       possess. Although I had studied for some time the traditions of my       nation, rather out of curiosity than because of the love of       knowledge, I knew very well that I could hardly penetrate the       corridor of those mysteries which I am still regarding as the       sophistry and roguishness of exalted minds, invented for the       purpose of holding fools in fear and subordination. But several       accidental discoveries, made by me since then, have changed my       views and have aroused in me a sense of curiosity.         \"'You know, notwithstanding our brief acquaintance, that I am not       the type of man who would abandon a clue or a conceived plan. What       has caused me to make you my companion in satisfying my       curiosity--that does not concern you. It is enough that now we have       an opportunity to satisfy our mutual desire, and all depends on       whether you will agree to accept the conditions upon which I can       make you a partner in my investigation.'         \"'If these are not against honor and conscience.'         \"'In this respect you have nothing to risk, you are rather risking       something else--your life. Do you feel that you are capable of       facing a serious danger?'         \"'For the sake of science, yes!'         \"'Very well, in that case I must tell you that I will lead you to a       place which we will not leave alive, if our presence is discovered.       The slightest suspicion that we were uninvited witnesses of the       secret will bring upon us persecution which will kill us sooner or       later.'         \"'You are whetting my curiosity, signor!'         \"'That is all I wanted to tell you. The other thing--you know that       I am a Jew by birth. Although the Jews have driven me from their       midst and cursed me according to their custom and traditions       because I adopted Christianity,--still I have my own reasons for       stipulating a condition--your word of honor that you will be silent       about all you will see and hear, until I authorize you to speak.'         \"'I swear by my honor.'         \"'Very well. You will recall in your investigations of the Caballah       that in the mysterious books mention is made of a meeting of the       heads or chosen ones of the nation,--a meeting which takes place       from time to time?'         \"'Yes, in the Yezire it is said very definitely, and if I       understood correctly, such meetings take place every hundred       years.'         \"'Yes. The last meeting took place in 1760 and you recall that       shortly afterward the movement of Judaism started. It is now 1787       years since the destruction of Jerusalem and this year is       designated for a meeting of the Cabalistic Sanhedrin. This is the       day of the meeting; the place is this city. I want to be present at       this meeting in spite of the danger and am ready to take you along       with me.'         \"'But will it not be dishonest to listen, will it not be an       unlawful interference with other people's secrets?'         \"'Per Bacco! as we Italians say; with such hesitations you must       abandon once for all the idea of fulfilling your desire. Or do you       think that the people who guard the secret of the Caballah will       bring it to you on a tray? As far as I am concerned, I shall       discover the secret, at any cost!'         \"After reflecting a few minutes, the scientist came to a decision.         \"'I shall go with you, come what may!'         \"'Very well. Now we have agreed. Let us go,--there is no time to       lose.'\"           *       *       *       *       *         \"The tower clock of the town-hall struck eleven. At the first       stroke a key clicked in the lock of the cemetery gates. Then       followed profound silence which indicated that the cemetery was       open. The lights in the Jewish houses were gradually dying out, and       at the same time the sounds of the merry feasting also subsided.         \"Mysterious silence reigned in that terrible place.         \"The gates creaked softly; the rustling of long coats was heard,       touching the stones and shrubbery; finally a vague white figure       appeared and slipped by like a shadow along the pathways.         \"This figure knelt before one of the tombstones; three times it       touched the stone with its forehead and softly whispered a prayer.         \"Along the path leading from the gates came an old man, bent,       limping, sighing and coughing. He came over to the ancient       tombstone, and lowered himself on his knees near the white figure       that had entered before him, and he, too, whispered a prayer.         \"Then heavy footsteps were heard, and a tall, impressive figure       appeared on the road, clad in a white mantle, and he, too, fell       down on his knees, as though unwillingly, in front of the       tombstone.         \"Thirteen times this was repeated. Thirteen old men came over to       the tombstone. The doctor counted them, but he could not understand       whether they were alive or dead. A shiver crept down his back, his       heart began to beat faster from fright. He involuntarily recalled       the terrible legend of the Day of Atonement in the tenth month,       Tishri, in the synagogue of Posen when, during the prayer of Kol       Nidrei, the congregation kept growing larger and larger; unknown       people, pushing one another, wrapped in prayer shawls, came in, one       hundred after another, until the terrified Rabbi lifted his hand as       if to curse and exclaimed: 'He who has flesh in his cheeks, let him       throw off the prayer shawl!' Hundreds remained covered, and when       the prayer shawls were torn away from them, all saw the skulls of       the dead who had come out of the graves to celebrate the Day of       Atonement with the rest of the congregation.         \"As there, it seemed to him that the prayer shawls had fallen off       the heads of the praying old men, and a row of dead skulls       appeared. At that moment the clock struck twelve. A sharp metallic       sound rang out on the grave, after which a blue flame appeared and       illumined the thirteen kneeling figures.         \"'I greet you, Roshe beth Aboth (heads) of the twelve tribes of       Israel,' announced a dull voice.         \"'We greet you, son of the accursed.'         \"'A hundred years have already passed.

I am sure that the rope was well tied, for I was  the first who slipped down it, and I looked at the knot well,  before I went over the side and trusted my weight to it. He must  have seen us, and as soon as he thought we were fairly asleep must  have loosened the knot and cast us adrift. What on earth is to be  done, now?\"    \"I should think,\" Gerald said, \"that it will not be long before the  ship comes back for us. The boat is sure to be missed, in the  morning, for the carpenter will be wanting it to go over the side.  We, too, will be missed, for the captain will be wanting his flagon  of wine, soon after the day has dawned.\"    \"But think you,\" Tom Tressilis said, \"that the captain will turn  back on his voyage, for us?\"    \"Of that I think there is no doubt,\" Gerald said; \"the only  question is as to the finding us, but I should say that of that  there is little fear; the wind is light, the ship was not making  fast through the water, and will not be more than fifty miles, at  most, away, when she turns on her heel and comes to look for us. I  expect that Master Taunton knew, well enough, that we should be  picked up again; but he guessed that the admiral would not be  pleased at losing a day, by our freak, and that the matter is not  likely to improve the favor in which we may stand with him and his  brother.\"    \"It is going to be a terrible hot day,\" Ned said, \"and with the sun  above our heads and no shade, and not so much as a drop of water,  the sooner we are picked up the more pleasant it will be, even if  we all get a touch of the rope's end for our exploit.\"    All day the boys watched anxiously. Once they saw the two vessels  sailing backward on their track, but the current had drifted the  boat, and the ships passed fully eight miles away to windward of  them, and thus without seeing them. This caused the boys,  courageous as they were, almost to despair.    \"If,\" argued Gerald, \"they pass us in the daylight, our chance is  small, indeed, that they will find us at night. They will,  doubtless, sail back till dusk; and then judge that they have  missed us, or that we have in some way sunk; then, putting their  heads to the west, they will continue their voyage.    \"If we had oars, or a sail, we might make a shift to pull the boat  into the track they are following, which would give us a chance of  being picked up when they again turn west; but as we have neither  one nor the other, we are helpless, indeed.\"    \"I do not think,\" Ned said, \"that Captain John or his brother are  the men to leave us, without a great effort; and methinks that,  when they have sailed over the ground to the point where, at the  utmost, we must have parted from them, they will lay by through the  night, and search back again, tomorrow.\"    And so it proved. On the morrow, about midday, the boys beheld one  of the ships coming up, nearly in a line behind them; while the  other, some six miles away to leeward, was keeping abreast of her.    \"They are quartering the ground, like hounds,\" Gerald said; \"and,  thanks to their care and thoughtfulness, we are saved, this time.\"    By the time that, three hours later, the ship, which was the Pacha,  came alongside, the boys were suffering terribly from the heat and  thirst; for thirty-six hours no drop of water had passed their  lips, and the sun had blazed down upon them with terrible force.  Therefore when the vessel hauled her course, and laid by for a boat  to be lowered to pick them up, their plight was so bad a one that  Captain Francis, although sorely vexed at having lost near two days  of his voyage, yet felt that they had been amply punished for their  escapade.          Chapter 3: On the Spanish Main.        The four boys, upon gaining the Pacha's deck, were taken below; and  after drink and food had been given them, were called to the  captain's cabin. He spoke to them gravely, and inquired how it was  that they had all got adrift, together. They told him the  circumstances, and said that they thought there was no chance of  any mishap occurring; the knot was well fastened, the night was  calm, and though they regretted much the pains and trouble which  they had given, and the delay to which they had put the fleet, yet  it did not appear to them, they said frankly, that they had been so  very much to blame, as they could hardly have believed that the  boat would have broken afloat; and indeed, Ned said plainly, they  believed that it was not the result of chance, but that an enemy  had done them an evil turn.    \"Why think you so?\" Captain Drake said sharply. \"How can boys like  you have an enemy?\"    Gerald then detailed the account of their trouble with Master  Taunton.    \"He is a rough man,\" Captain Drake said, \"and a violent man, maybe,  but he is useful and brave. However, I will have reason with him.  Of course it is a mere suspicion, but I will speak to my brother.\"    When the boat had first come in sight, the Pacha had made the  signal to the Swanne that the boys were found, and that she was to  keep her course, drawing gradually alongside. Before dark the  vessels were within hailing distance, and Captain Drake, lowering a  boat, went himself on board the Swanne with the four lads. Captain  John was at the top of the ladder, and was about to rate them  soundly.    Captain Francis said, \"Let us talk together, John, first;\" and he  repaired with him to his cabin, while the crew swarmed round the  boys, to gather an account of how they got adrift.    Then Captain John appeared at the door of his cabin, and called for  Master Taunton, who went in and remained, for some time, in  converse with the two captains. Then he came out, looking surly and  black, and Captain Francis soon after issued out with his brother,  walked round the ship, said a few cheery words to all the crew;  and, with a parting laugh and word of advice to the boys, to be  more careful where they slept in future, descended the side and  went off to his ship again.    Opinions were much mingled, on board the Swanne, as to whether the  slipping of the knot had been the effect of accident or of an evil  turn; however, the boys said little about it, and endeavored, so  far as might be, to let it pass as an accident. They felt that the  matter between themselves and Master Taunton had already gone too  far for their safety and comfort. They doubted not that he had been  reprimanded by the admiral, as well as by Captain John, and that  they had earned his hatred; which, although it might slumber for a  while, was likely to show itself again, when a chance might occur.    Not wishing to inflame farther his fury against them, they  abstained from giving such a complexion to their tale as might seem  to cast a suspicion upon him. Nevertheless there was a strong  feeling, amongst many of the crew, that Master Taunton must have  had a hand in the casting adrift of the boys; or that if he did not  himself do it, it had been done by one of the party who always  worked with him.    Whatever the feelings of Giles Taunton might be, he kept them to  himself. He now never interfered with the boys, by word or deed,  working sullenly and quietly at his craft as armorer The boys felt  their lives much lightened thereby, and now thoroughly enjoyed the  voyage.    Although as boys it was not a part of their duty to go aloft, which  was done by the regular sailors who were hired for the purpose, yet  they spent no small part of their time, when not engaged--and their  duties truly were but nominal--in going aloft, sliding down the  ropes, and learning to be thoroughly at home among the sails.    Every day, too, there would be practices with arms. It was of the  utmost importance that each man should be able to use sword and axe  with the greatest skill; and on board each ship those who were best  skilled would exercise and give lessons to those who were less  practiced with their arms; and, using wooden clubs in place of  boarding axes, they would much belabor each other, to the amusement  of the lookers on. The boys were most assiduous at this kind of  work. It was their highest ambition to become good swordsmen, and  to have a chance of distinguishing themselves against the  Spaniards; and so they practiced diligently, with point and edge.  The knowledge of singlestick and quarterstaff still lingered, in  the country parts of England. They had all already some skill with  these, and picked up fast the use of the heavier, and more manly  arms.    It was the end of July before they sighted land. Great was the  delight of all; for, cooped up in what were after all but narrow  quarters, they longed for a sight of the green and beautiful  forests, of which they had heard so much. They were still far from  the destination which the admiral had marked as his base of  operations. They cruised along for days, with the land often in  sight, but keeping for the most part a long distance out; for they  feared that the knowledge of their coming might be carried, by the  natives, to the Spaniards in the towns; and that such preparations  might be made as would render their journey fruitless.    Near, however, to some of the smaller islands, which were known to  be uninhabited by Spaniards, the vessels went closely, and one day  dropped anchor in a bay. They observed some natives on the shore,  but the white men had so bad a name, caused by the cruelty of the  Spaniards, that these withdrew hastily from sight. The captain,  however, had a boat lowered; which, pulling towards shore, and  waving a white flag in token of amity, met with no resistance.  There were on board some who could speak Spanish, and one of these  shouted aloud to the Indians to have no fear, for that they were  friends, and haters of the Spaniards; whereupon the natives came  out from the woods, and greeted them.    They were a fine race of men, but"]]]
