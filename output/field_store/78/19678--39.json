My brother John, three years older than myself, and of a moral       character more manly and on a higher level, had chosen the navy,       and went off to the preparatory college at Portsmouth. But he       evidently underwent persecution for righteousness' sake at the       college, which was then (say about 1820) in a bad condition. Of       this, though he was never querulous, his letters bore the traces,       and I cannot but think they must have exercised upon me some kind       of influence for good. As to miscellaneous notices, I had a great       affinity with the trades of joiners and of bricklayers. Physically       I must have been rather tough, for my brother John took me down at       about ten years old to wrestle in the stables with an older lad of       that region, whom I threw. Among our greatest enjoyments were       undoubtedly the annual Guy Fawkes bonfires, for which we had always       liberal allowances of wreck timber and a tar-barrel. I remember       seeing, when about eight or nine, my first case of a dead body. It       was the child of the head gardener Derbyshire, and was laid in the       cottage bed by tender hands, with nice and clean accompaniments.       It seemed to me pleasing, and in no way repelled me; but it made no       deep impression. And now I remember that I used to teach pretty       regularly on Sundays in the Sunday-school built by my father near       the Primrose bridge. It was, I think, a duty done not under       constraint, but I can recollect nothing which associates it with a       seriously religious life in myself.[8]                                            II                                      GENEALOGY    To these fragments no long supplement is needed. Little of interest can  be certainly established about his far-off ancestral origins, and the  ordinary twilight of genealogy overhangs the case of the Glaidstanes,  Gledstanes, Gladstanes, Gladstones, whose name is to be found on  tombstones and parish rolls, in charter-chests and royal certificates,  on the southern border of Scotland. The explorations of the genealogist  tell of recognitions of their nobility by Scottish kings in dim ages,  but the links are sometimes broken, title-deeds are lost, the same name  is attached to estates in different counties, Roxburgh, Peebles, Lanark,  and in short until the close of the seventeenth century we linger, in  the old poet's phrase, among dreams of shadows. As we have just been  told, during the eighteenth century no traces of their gentility  survives, and apparently they glided down from moderate lairds to small  maltsters. Thomas Gladstones, grandfather of him with whom we are  concerned, made his way from Biggar to Leith, and there set up in a  modest way as corndealer, wholesale and retail. His wife was a Neilson  of Springfield. To them sixteen children were born, and John Gladstones  (b. Dec. 11, 1764) was their eldest son. Having established himself in  Liverpool, he married in 1792 Jane Hall, a lady of that city, who died  without children six years later. In 1800 he took for his second wife  Anne Robertson of Dingwall. Her father was of the clan Donnachaidh, and  her mother was of kin with Mackenzies, Munros, and other highland  stocks.[9] Their son, therefore, was of unmixed Scottish origins, half  highland, half lowland borderer.[10] With the possible exception of Lord  Mansfield--the rival of Chatham in parliament, one of the loftiest names  among great judges, and chief builder of the commercial law of the  English world, a man who might have been prime minister if he had  chosen.--Mr. Gladstone stands out as far the most conspicuous and  powerful of all the public leaders in our history, who have sprung from  the northern half of our island. When he had grown to be the most famous  man in the realm of the Queen, he said, 'I am not slow to claim the  name of Scotsman, and even if I were, there is the fact staring me in  the face that not a drop of blood runs in my veins except what is  derived from a Scottish ancestry.'[11] An illustrious opponent once  described him, by way of hitting his singular duality of disposition, as  an ardent Italian in the custody of a Scotsman. It is easy to make too  much of race, but when we are puzzled by Mr. Gladstone's seeming  contrarieties of temperament, his union of impulse with caution, of  passion with circumspection, of pride and fire with self-control, of  Ossianic flight with a steady foothold on the solid earth, we may  perhaps find a sort of explanation in thinking of him as a highlander in  the custody of a lowlander.    Of John Gladstone something more remains to be said. About 1783 he was  made a partner by his father in the business at Leith, and here he saved  five hundred pounds. Four years later, probably after a short period of  service, he was admitted to a partnership with two corn-merchants at  Liverpool, his contribution to the total capital of four thousand pounds  being fifteen hundred, of which his father lent him five hundred, and a  friend another five at five per cent. In 1787 he thought the plural  ending of his name sounded awkwardly in the style of the firm, Corrie,  Gladstones, and Bradshaw, so he dropped the _s_.[12] He visited London  to enlarge his knowledge of the corn trade in Mark Lane, and here became  acquainted with Sir Claude Scott, the banker (not yet, however, a  baronet). Scott was so impressed by his extraordinary vigour and  shrewdness as to talk of a partnership, but Gladstone's existing  arrangement in Liverpool was settled for fourteen years. Sometime in the  nineties he was sent to America to purchase corn, with unlimited  confidence from Sir Claude Scott. On his arrival, he found a severe  scarcity and enormous prices. A large number of vessels had been  chartered for the enterprise, and were on their way to him for cargoes.  To send them back in ballast would be a disaster. Thrown entirely on his  own resources, he travelled south from New York, making the best  purchases of all sorts that he could; then loaded his ships with timber  and other commodities, one only of them with flour; and the loss on the  venture, which might have meant ruin, did not exceed a few hundred  pounds. Energy and resource of this kind made fortune secure, and when  the fourteen years of partnership expired, Gladstone continued business  on his own account, with a prosperity that was never broken. He brought  his brothers to Liverpool, but it was to provide for them, not to assist  himself, says Mr. Gladstone; 'and he provided for many young men in the  same way. I never knew him reject any kind of work in aid of others that  offered itself to him.'                                 JOHN GLADSTONE    It was John Gladstone's habit, we are told, to discuss all sorts of  questions with his children, and nothing was ever taken for granted  between him and his sons. 'He could not understand,' says the  illustrious one among them, 'nor tolerate those who, perceiving an  object to be good, did not at once and actively pursue it; and with all  this energy he joined a corresponding warmth and, so to speak, eagerness  of affection, a keen appreciation of humour, in which he found a rest,  and an indescribable frankness and simplicity of character, which,  crowning his other qualities, made him, I think (and I strive to think  impartially), the most interesting old man I have ever known.'[13]    To his father's person and memory, Mr. Gladstone's fervid and  affectionate devotion remained unbroken. 'One morning,' writes a female  relative of his, 'when I was breakfasting alone with Mr. Gladstone at  Carlton House Terrace something led to his speaking of his father. I  seem to see him now, rising from his chair, standing in front of the  chimneypiece, and in strains of fervid eloquence dwelling on the  grandeur, the breadth and depth of his character, his generosity, his  nobleness, last and greatest of all--his loving nature. His eyes filled  with tears as he exclaimed: \"None but his children can know what  torrents of tenderness flowed from his heart.\"'    The successful merchant was also the active-minded citizen. 'His  force,' says his son, 'soon began to be felt as a prominent and then a  foremost member of the community.' He had something of his descendant's  inextinguishable passion for pamphleteering, and the copious effusion of  public letters and articles. As was inevitable in a Scotsman of his  social position at that day, when tory rule of a more tyrannic stamp  than was ever known in England since the Revolution of 1688, had reduced  constitutional liberty in Scotland to a shadow, John Gladstone came to  Liverpool a whig, and a whig he remained until Canning raised the flag  of a new party inside the entrenchments of Eldonian toryism.    In 1812 Canning, who had just refused Lord Liverpool's proffer of the  foreign office because he would not serve under Castlereagh as leader in  the House of Commons, was invited by John Gladstone to stand for  Liverpool. He was elected in triumph over Brougham, and held the seat  through four elections, down to 1822, when he was succeeded by  Huskisson, whom he described to the constituency as the best man of  business in England, and one of the ablest practical statesmen that  could engage in the concerns of a commercial country. The speeches made  to his constituents during the ten years for which he served them are  excellent specimens of Canning's rich, gay, aspiring eloquence. In  substance they abound in much pure toryism, and his speech after the  Peterloo massacre, and upon the topics relating to public meetings,  sedition, and parliamentary reform, though by sonorous splendour and a  superb plausibility fascinating to the political neophyte, is by no  means free from froth, without much relation either to social facts or  to popular principles. On catholic emancipation he followed Pitt, as he  did in an "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21102"],[0,"Tom and Some Other Girls: A Public School Story (#5)"],[1," all the rest  looked--hideous!  There was a goal at one end, _here_, and another,  _here_.\"  Ella drew a rough map of the ground on the back of an  envelope, and Rhoda looked on with breathless interest.  \"This team  wanted to make a goal _here_, and the other side tried to prevent them.  They whacked with their sticks, and off went the ball, and each side  flew after it, trying to send it the way they wanted, and one poor,  wretched girl stood before each goal to prevent the enemy's ball from  entering.  I expected they would both die of consumption the next day,  but I met them out at tea, quite spry and lively, and they said they  didn't feel cold a bit.  I didn't believe them, but that's nothing.  An  umpire marched about in leggings, and blew a whistle, and called out  `Off side!  Off side!'\"    \"And what did he mean by that?\"    Ella hesitated, uncertainly.  Her knowledge of the game was of the  slightest, but she was anxious to help her friend, and gallantly tried  to recall odd explanations.    \"Oh, well, I think one of the wrong side hit, you know, and there is a  rule that you may not send the ball straight forward to one of your own  side, but must hit it back to some one behind you.\"    \"But that's silly!  If you want to get on as fast as you can, why on  earth must you go _back_?  If they never hit forward, how can they win.  Do you mean to say they _never_ send it forwards towards the goal?\"    \"Oh, yes, yes!  One girl was splendid.  She hit magnificently.  She ran  like a man, and sent it flying before her, and made three goals  herself.\"    \"Then how--why--what--what in the world did you mean by saying that you  _mustn't_ do it?\" demanded Rhoda sternly, and Ella made a gesture as of  tearing her hair in confusion.    \"I don't know!  It isn't easy to understand a game when you see only one  match.  I was confused myself, but I know each side tries for a  different goal, and there are `backs' and `half-backs' and `forwards,'  just as at football, and, whatever you do, you must not raise your stick  above your waist.  It's a murderous-looking game, anyhow.  I wondered  that they weren't all killed; and one girl's hand was bleeding horribly.  I asked her if it was very painful, and she stared and said, `Oh, I  hadn't noticed it!' and mopped it up with her handkerchief.  Awfully  callous, I call it.\"    \"Oh, I don't know!\" replied Rhoda, airily.  \"Those flesh wounds don't  hurt.  I should never think of taking any notice of a little thing like  that.  Well, I can't say I am very much wiser for your instructions, my  dear, but I will pump Harold and see what I can get out of him.  I have  no doubt I could hit all right, for I have a quick eye, and if you can  play one or two games it helps you with the rest.  But I should be  pretty mad if I made a hit and they whistled at me and made me come  back.  I like to know what I am about.\"    \"You had better be a goal-keeper,\" advised Ella, wisely; \"you have no  running to do until the ball comes your way, and then at it you go,  tooth and nail!  Stop it somehow--anyhow--with your hands, your feet,  your skirt, your stick.  I believe there is an etiquette about it, don't  you know, as there is about all those things, and that it's more swagger  to stop it one way than another, but the main thing is to stop it  _somehow_, and that you simply must do!\"    \"Humph!  If you can!  What happens if you can't?\"    \"Emigrate to Australia by the first boat!  I should think so, at least,  to judge by the faces of the other girls when one poor creature _did_  let a ball in.  Feerocious, my dear! there was no other word for it.  My  heart ached for her.  But it was a stupid miss, for it looked so easy.  I felt sure I could have stopped it.\"    \"It's all a matter of nerve.  If you lose your head you are sure to play  the fool at a critical moment.  Fraulein was like that.  The moment the  game went against her she began to hop about, and puff and pant, and  work herself into such a fever that she couldn't even see a ball, much  less hit it.  I kept calm, and so of course I always won.\"    It did strike Ella that victory under such circumstances would be easily  gained, but she was too loyal to say so, and Rhoda leant back against  the cushions of the sofa, and continued to discourse on games in  general, and school games in particular, with an air of such intimacy  and knowledge that no one would have suspected that the object of her  visit had been to listen, rather than to teach.    Ella listened meekly to a recital of what her friend intended to do, and  be; of the examinations she would pass, the honours she would gain; the  influence she would exercise over her fellows; and sighed to think of  her own limitations, and the impossibility of such a career ever falling  to her lot.  And then Rhoda rose, and put on her gloves preparatory to  saying good-bye.    \"I shall come down to see you again, of course, but I shall be very  busy.  I am going to have a complete new outfit, and everything as nice  as possible.\"    \"Ye-es,\" said the Vicar's daughter.    \"I shall have all my best skirts lined with silk.\"    \"Ah!\" sighed Ella, and felt a pang of keenest envy.  She had never  possessed a silk lining in her life.  It seemed to her at times that if  she could only hear herself rustle as she walked, there would be nothing  left to wish for in life!    \"They will think you are a Princess!\" she said, and Rhoda smiled, and  did not attempt to deny the impeachment.        CHAPTER FOUR.    DEPARTURE.    Mr and Mrs Chester returned from their visit to Hurst Manor with  somewhat different accounts of the establishment.  The father was  delighted with all he had seen, thought the arrangements excellent, and  Miss Bruce a charming and lovable woman.  The mother did not see how  draughts were to be avoided in those long, bare passages, considered the  hours of work cruelly long, and was convinced that Miss Bruce could be  very stern if she chose.  Her husband laughed, and declared that a  school of two hundred girls would fare badly indeed if she could not,  and the maternal fears were silenced at once by his banter, and by  Rhoda's fearless confidence.    It was finally decided that the girl should join at the beginning of the  term, and preparations were set on foot without delay.  It was almost  like buying a trousseau, Rhoda declared; and certainly no bride-elect  could have taken a keener interest in her purchases.  The big, new box  with her initials on the side; the dressing-bag with its dainty  fittings; the writing-case and workbox; the miniature medicine chest  stocked with domestic remedies, in case she should feel feverish or  chilled, have earache, toothache, or headache; be threatened with sore  throat or swollen glands--they were all new possessions, and as such  afforded acute satisfaction, for though the wardrobe list was  disappointingly short, there were at least no restrictions as to  quality.    When the key was turned in her box Rhoda heaved a sigh of satisfaction  in the confidence that not one of the two hundred girls could possess a  better equipment than her own.  Then she looked round her dismantled  room, and felt a pang of depression.  It looked so _dead_--as if its  owner had already departed, and left it to its fate.  The wardrobe door  swung apart and revealed the empty pegs; the drawers were pulled open  and showed piles of torn-up letters; the carpet was strewn with pins.  All the treasured ornaments had been stored away, and the ugly ones  looked uglier than ever, as if infected by the general dejection.  In  story-books girls were wont to bid a sentimental adieu to their maiden  bowers before leaving for a new sphere, but Rhoda did not feel in the  least inclined to be sentimental; she took to her heels instead and ran  downstairs, only too glad to escape from her dreary surroundings, and  presently she and her mother _were_ driving towards the station on the  first stage of the eventful journey.    The village women stood at the doors of their cottages to put their  aprons to their eyes, and murmur, \"Ay, poor dear!\" as she drove past;  little Tommy Banks threw a nosegay of marigolds through the carriage  window, and waddled away, scarlet with confusion; and there was quite a  gathering of friends on the platform.    Ella had brought a box of home-made Fuller's sweets from herself and a  dainty copy of _The Christian Year_ as the Vicar's farewell offering;  Mrs Ross had a stack of magazines for reading on the journey, and  little Miss Jones, who owed all the comforts of life to Mrs Chester's  friendship, presented the most elaborate \"housewife,\" stocked with every  necessary which it seemed probable that a girl at school would _not_  require.  It was all most touching and gratifying.  Even the station-  master came up to express his good wishes, and the one-eyed porter  blurted out, \"Glad to see you back, Miss!\" as if it were impossible to  suppress his feelings a moment longer.    Rhoda felt an insight into the feelings of Royalty as she stood at the  window of the carriage, graciously smiling and bowing so long as she  remained in sight, and when this excitement was over, another appeared  to take its place.  Mrs Chester was discovered to be crying in quite  uncontrolled fashion, and at the sight of her tears Rhoda put on her  severest air.    \"Mother!  What are you doing?  You must _not_ cry!  Please remember that  in half an hour we shall be at Euston, and meet the school.  I should  never get over it if the girls saw my mother with a red face!\"    Mrs Chester mopped her eyes obediently, and made a valiant effort to  regain her composure.  For herself, poor dear, she cared little about  appearances, but Rhoda had already exhibited an intense anxiety that she  should make a good impression on the minds of her future school-fellows.
