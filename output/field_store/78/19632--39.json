Cards of condolence are left as soon as possible after learning of the  affliction.  If in town, cards are left in person or sent by a  messenger with a message.  If out of town a card is sent by the first  post.  Nothing is written upon these cards.    A visiting card, with \"Congratulations\" written upon it, is sent to  felicitate a friend upon any happy event in which friends may  sympathize.  Such cards are sent by messenger or by post.  If a card is  left in person with a kind message, nothing is written upon the card.    When a man calls and sees his hostess, but not the host, he should  leave a card for the latter.  If the hostess is not at home, two cards  should be left.    When a man entertains formally, each man invited, whether he accepts or  not, should acknowledge the courtesy within a week.  He may call in  person, or leave a card, or send a card by mail, or write a note of  thanks, whichever he prefers.  This is one of the important formalities  between men, and the neglect of it argues either ignorance or insolence.    When a man calls upon a woman while she is the guest of a family with  whom he is not acquainted, he inquires for both his friend and her  hostess, and, as he is a stranger in the house, he sends up a card for  each (instead of announcing himself _verbally_, as at the house of a  friend).  If the hostess receives him on this occasion, but extends no  further hospitality, he has no claim upon her recognition beyond the  hour.  If the hostess subsequently offers him any hospitality during  the time his friend is her guest he must call upon her; but if he  defers this until after the departure of the guest, he must leave a  card for the hostess without intruding a personal call, unless he has  been distinctly invited to continue the acquaintance.  If the man who  pays the call does not wish to continue the acquaintance with his  friend's hostess, after she has offered him hospitality, he must at  least call and leave a card for her, with a polite inquiry for her  health.  This is obligatory; but nothing further is required.    A visiting card is employed in sending informal invitations to a tea or  afternoon reception.  The care of the hostess is used, and in addition  to the name of the regular receiving day the special date, as \"January  19,\" and some other specific words, as \"Tea, 4 to 6,\" are written in  the lower left corner.  (In this informal _written_ message _numbers_  are indicate by _figures_, where _formal_ invitations require the  _words_ to be written in full.)  This card is accepted by the  recipients as equivalent to a call paid by the sender, and they respond  in person at the time indicated, leaving cards with the servant as they  enter, and also, on their departure, leaving the cards of such male  members of their respective families as have been invited, but are  unable to attend.  As few men can leave business at this hour these  occasions become prominent illustrations of \"proxy\" card-leaving.  If  any one invited cannot be present (and in case of a man no female  relative is there authorized to represent him) a card must be sent by  post or messenger on the receiving day.    After a change of residence, or after a prolonged absence from home,  cards of the entire family are sent to notify an acquaintance of their  re-establishment and of their readiness to resume the social  interchange.    It is customary for the younger society men to pay a round of calls  after returning from the usual summer \"outing,\" or to leave cards in  lieu of a call.    When leaving for a long absence, or when parting from transient, but  agreeable acquaintances, as companion tourists, etc., when time does  not admit of farewell calls, visiting-cards are sent by post with \"P.  p. c.\" (_Pour prendre conge_--to take leave) written upon them.  This  is equivalent to saying, \"If ever we meet again we will meet on the  footing of friends, not strangers.\"  It is a pleasant way of showing  appreciation of the pleasure afforded by another's society, and the  formality should not be neglected by one who would be esteemed  thoughtfully polite and kind.    Only people who cling to old-fashioned customs still fold over the  right side of a visiting-card to show that the card was left _in  person_, and also fold over the _left side_ to show that the call was  intended for _all_ the women of the household.  This custom is  practically obsolete.  Another fashion that has had its day was that of  leaving a separate card for each of the women of the household.  Now,  _one_ card answers the purpose, the inquiry accompanying it indicates  whether the call was intended for one or for all of the family.  In  case a _guest_ of the household is included in the call a separate card  is left for her.          CEREMONIOUS CARDS AND INVITATIONS.  ETIQUETTE OF REPLIESs    THE \"HIGH TEA,\" MUSICALE, ETC.    These occasions are more formal than the ordinary afternoon tea.  Special cards are engraved, and if any special entertainment is  provided, the fact may be indicated by the words, \"Music,\" or  \"Miscellaneous Program\" (when readings and music are interspersed).  Or, the announcement may be omitted, and the program furnish a pleasant  surprise for the guests.  But when \"Dancing\" is the recreation provided  for, it must appear on the card, so that guests may prepare for it.  The card for a \"_musicale_\" or similar occasion, is simply engraved:           MRS. JOHN LIVINGSTONE               At Home     Wednesday, October fifth, from         four to seven o'clock.    Dancing.           119 Park Ave.      FOR A PARTY OR RECEPTION GIVEN IN HONOR OF ANOTHER, the invitations may  be engraved with a blank space left for the name of the invited guest;  or, the form may be filled out, and the name of the guest appear on the  envelope only.  It may read:        MR. AND MRS. DEXTER HOLMES        request the pleasure of      .........................'s      company on Tuesday evening      June sixth, at nine o'clock,                to meet          Rev. John D. Loring.      R.S.V.P.         29 Rice St.    or, the wording may be \"request the pleasure of your company,\" etc.  The former has the rhetorical advantage of uniformity, the third person  being used throughout; and it also indicates a personal recognition of  each guest; but the latter form presents a neater appearance.    As to the use of \"R.S.V.P.,\" or any of the phrases now preferred by  many, as, \"Please reply;\" \"The favor of an answer is requested,\" etc.,  this may be said: some authorities claim that _all_ invitations should  be _answered_; and that therefore these _requests_ for a reply are a  reflection on the good manners of the people invited.  But such is not  the popular understanding.  All invitations that are _plainly limited  to a certain number of guests_, as dinners, card parties, and certain  exclusive receptions, should be answered at once, in order that  vacancies may be filled.  Whether the invitation is accompanied with  the request for a reply or not, all thoughtful people will recognize  the propriety.  But on many occasions where numbers are not necessarily  limited, only the hostess can say whether the reply is urgent or not;  since it is a question of her personal convenience, the limits of  house-room, or some other individual matter.  As no one class of  entertainments is given always under the same conditions, it is well to  allow the hostess to choose whether she will add or omit the request  for a reply to her invitations.    Meanwhile, the punctilious may reply to every invitation of a strictly  social character, and even if the host or hostess did not expect it,  such reply can give no offense; whereas, the _neglect_ of a _necessary_  reply might prove very awkward and annoying.    A private ball is only a more elaborate form of a dancing party.  The  invitations are phrased in the same language, but the hour is usually  not earlier than 9.30 P. M.    The same form of invitation can be adapted to almost any reception,  party or other social entertainment, with such variations in the  phrasing as suit the circumstances.    It may be said that it is unnecessary to give explicit directions about  invitations, inasmuch as the engraver is the one ultimately responsible  for the accuracy of these things.  But on occasions when small numbers  are invited--but undiminished formality is observed--the formal  invitation is requisite, yet the engraved card is a needless expense.  In such cases one may have cards _written_ in due form.  But, for  written invitations of this formal character, it is imperative that the  paper shall be of superior quality, and the penmanship neat, and  _thoroughly stylish_ in effect.      CARDS OF INVITATION TO A WEDDING are issued in the name of the bride's  parents, or, if she is an orphan, by her guardian, or some relative or  friend who gives her the wedding.  All expenses are paid by the bride's  family.    It is not etiquette for the groom to bear any of the expense, except  the fee to the clergy man; nor to furnish anything for his own wedding,  except the ring and the bouquet for the bride, presents for the  brides-maids and best man, and some little token for the ushers.    The hostess (who invites) requests the groom to furnish her with two  lists of names--one list of those of his friends whom he wishes to be  present to witness the ceremony, and another list of those whom he  would like to see at the reception also.  These, with similar lists of  the bride's friends, make up the number of guests to be invited.  Wedding invitations are usually sent out two weeks before the day fixed  for the ceremony.  The invitation is engraved and printed upon a note  sheet, in handsome plain script, the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20472"],[0,"Grace Harlowe's Plebe Year at High School (#5)"],[1,"knew better than to say anything more just then.    \"Never mind, girls,\" said Grace in a low voice, after the sophomores had  strolled away, \"we'll be sophomores ourselves next year. Now, all who  want to join the party, meet Nora and Jessica and me at the old Omnibus  House at three-thirty. And, above all, don't give the meeting place  away.\"    \"Not in a thousand years,\" said Marian Barber.    It was evident that Miriam Nesbit had hoped to break up the party by  declining to go herself. But she was not quite strong enough in the  class to divide it utterly, and she went off in a huff, with the secret  wish to take revenge on somebody. As she started up Chapel Hill to her  home she was joined by one of the sophomore girls, who lived across the  street.    \"Your plebes are getting away from you, Miriam,\" exclaimed the older  girl in a bantering tone. \"You haven't got them well in hand yet.  Nutting parties should be left behind for the Grammar School pupils.\"    \"They certainly should,\" replied Miriam in a disgusted tone. \"It's Grace  Harlowe who gets up all these foolish children's games. She's nothing  but a tomboy, anyhow.\"    \"She's the captain of the basketball team, isn't she?\" asked the other  dryly.    \"Yes,\" admitted Miriam reluctantly, \"but she never would have been if  she hadn't brought along all her friends to vote for her.\"    \"Whew-w-w!\" whistled the sophomore. \"You don't mean to say it wasn't a  fair election?\"    \"Oh, fair enough,\" said Miriam, \"except that I didn't bother to bring  any of my special friends, and she did. I don't call that exactly fair.\"    \"Oh, well,\" consoled the other, \"you have a few things coming to you  anyway, Miriam. You're at the head of your class, as usual, I suppose?\"    Miriam nodded her head without answering. She was thinking of little  Anne Pierson and what a close race they were running together. Even  studying harder than she had ever had to do before, Miriam found it  difficult to keep up with Anne.    \"Where are they going?\" asked the other girl suddenly, after they had  walked along a few minutes in silence.    \"Where are who going?\" asked Miriam.    \"Why, the nutting party, of course.\"    Here was Miriam's chance for revenge. The sophomores were a famously  mischievous class, and this girl was one of its ringleaders. Back in  Grammar School days they had played many pranks on their school fellows,  and even in their freshman year they had dared to turn off all lights,  one night at a dance of older schoolmates.    \"If I tell, you won't give me away, will you?\" asked Miriam.    \"I promise,\" said the older girl.    \"Very well, then. They meet at three-thirty at the Omnibus House on the  River road.\"    \"Good,\" said the sophomore. \"Don't you want to come along and see the  fun?\"    \"Don't count on me,\" answered Miriam, turning in at her gate, with mixed  feelings of shame and triumph.    The Omnibus House, which had been chosen by Grace as the class meeting  place, was an old stone building standing in the middle of an orchard.  It was now in ruins, but tradition set it down as a former inn and stage  coach station built before the days of railroads, and finally burned by  the Indians. There was a curious hieroglyphic sign cut in a stone slab  in the front wall which one of the High School professors interested in  archaeology had deciphered as follows: \"Peace and Justice Reign Over  Mount Asia Tavern.\"    Here the crowd of High School \"plebes,\" as the sophomores scornfully  dubbed them, met in conclave, partly to gather nuts in the woods near  by, partly to discuss class matters, but chiefly to enjoy the crisp  autumn weather. The woods were still gorgeous in russets and reds, in  spite of the recent heavy frosts, and there was a smell of burning  leaves and dry bracken in the air. The girls skipped about like young  ponies.    \"If this is childish,\" cried Grace, \"then I'd like to be a child always,  for I shall play in the woods when the notion strikes me, even if I'm a  grandmother.\"    There was a smothered snicker at this from the inside of the old stone  house, but the girls were too intent on their enjoyment to notice it.    \"Young ladies,\" exclaimed Nora O'Malley, trailing her cape after her to  make her skirts look longer, and twisting her mouth down to give her  face a severe expression, \"you are not in your usual form to-day. I must  ask for better preparation hereafter.\"    There was a peal of joyous laughter from the other girls.    \"Miss Leece to a dot,\" cried Jessica.    \"Miss Bright,\" went on Nora, \"you will please pay attention to the  lesson. If you do not, young woman, I shall have to punish you in the  old-fashioned way.\"    \"You will, will you?\" cried Jessica, rushing gayly upon her friend.  \"Come on and try it then!\"    The other girls followed, and there was a tussle to pull Nora down from  the stone upon which she had clambered to protect herself.    Shrieks, struggles and wild laughter followed, while Nora fought  desperately to hold her position. So absorbed were they in friendly  battle that they had not noticed a troop of black-robed figures leaving  the ruined Omnibus House and stealthily approaching.    Nora was the first to see the ominous circle. She stopped short, and  pointed with unmistakable terror at the masked and hooded persons, who  were watching them silently. There was a moment of frozen horror when  the girls turned around. This was a lonely spot, too remote from any  dwelling to call for help. Besides, the freshmen were outnumbered by  these weird figures, who appeared not unlike monks in their somber  cowls, although their faces were absolutely hidden by black masks.    The girls clustered together around the rock like a group of frightened  chickens. Jessica had turned pale. She was not very robust and often  overtaxed her strength to keep up with her two devoted friends.    The tallest of the masked figures then spoke in a queer, deep voice.    \"Young women, are you not aware that this is a sacred spot, devoted for  generations past to the Black Monks of Asia, whose home this building  was before it became a roadhouse for stage coaches? Never invade this  spot again with your hilarity. And now we will permit you to go,  marching out single file, without looking back. But first, through your  leader you must give your word never to mention this meeting to anyone.  If you refuse this promise we shall punish you as only the Black Monks  of Asia know how to punish persons who have offended the order. The  leader will please step forward.\"    There was a moment's whispered conversation among the freshmen. Then  Grace, urged by her friends, said:    \"We promise.\"    \"Now march out, single file, as agreed,\" resumed the Black Monk of Asia,  his voice trembling a little with suppressed emotion of some sort.    The girls started to move out of the enclosure single file, Grace  leading the procession, when a gust of wind blew the robe of the leading  monk apart, disclosing a navy blue serge walking-skirt. Grace's quick  eye caught sight of the skirt at once, and breaking from the line, she  charged straight into the group of black monks, crying:    \"Sophomores! Sophomores!\"    The other girls ran after her, screaming at the tops of their voices;  and there might have been almost a free fight between the two classes  had not the Black Monks of Asia scattered in every direction, running at  utmost speed.    \"Come on back, girls,\" cried Grace in a disgusted tone.    She had chased a monk half-way across the orchard; then stopped to  wonder what she would do if she caught the tall, black-robed individual  who had indecorously caught up her skirts and was flying well ahead over  the rough ground.    One by one the plebes returned to their meeting place.    \"Well, that was a sell!\" uttered Nora disgustedly. \"How shall we ever  manage to get even with those mean sophomores!\"    \"If we don't,\" exclaimed Grace, \"we shall never hear the last of it in  Oakdale.\"    \"But who gave us away?\" demanded Jessica. \"Did anyone drop a hint to the  sophomores of our secret meeting place?\"    \"I didn't,\" said one girl after another.    \"Perhaps they followed us,\" suggested Marian Barber.    \"No one followed me,\" asserted Grace. \"I was careful to look behind and  see.\"    \"Nor me.\"    \"Nor me,\" exclaimed several of her classmates.    \"No,\" said Nora. \"Somebody must have overheard and given the secret  away.\"    \"Not Mi----\" but Grace stopped before she had finished the name.    The girls looked at each other.    Could Miriam Nesbit have been so false to her class?    No one replied, but each made a secret resolution to ferret out Miriam's  suspected treachery if it were the last act of her life.    \"Let's start home, now,\" said Grace. \"It's too late to go nutting  anyhow, and these foolish sophomores have spoiled the afternoon, for me  at least. If we don't cook up something to pay them back, the name of  freshman will be disgraced forever more.\"    However, the afternoon adventures were not at an end.    As the group of girls started toward the road, some distance away,  trying not to look crestfallen, a gruff voice from the far side of the  Omnibus House called:    \"Hold up there!\"    The girls took no notice, thinking it was more upper-class tricks.    Five rough-looking men emerged from a grove of alders which grew about  the building.    The young girls were really frightened this time. No sophomore could  disguise herself like this. These were undoubtedly genuine ruffians of  the worst type, hungry, blear-eyed and ragged.    \"What shall we do?\" whispered Jessica, clinging to Grace desperately.    \"Everybody run,\" answered her friend, trying to be calm as the five men  advanced on them. But when they broke away to run toward the distant  road they found their retreat cut off by the tramps, who were active  enough as soon as the girls showed signs of flight. Back of them lay the  dense woods into which the sophomores must have plunged"]]]
