If on  the contrary the correlation is very slight, it will be evident that  early reading has little to do with the prevalance of defective vision  among school children. If investigators similarly work out all the other  correlations that can be suggested, finding whether there is any  regular relation between myopia and overcrowding, long hours of study,  general economic conditions at home, general physical or moral  conditions of parents, the time the child spends out of doors, etc., and  if no important relation is found between these various factors and  myopia, it will be evident that no factor of the environment which one  can think of as likely to cause the trouble really accounts for the poor  eyesight of school children.    [Illustration: HEIGHT IN CORN AND MEN    FIG. 3.--An unusually short and an unusually tall man,  photographed beside extreme varieties of corn which, like the men, owe  their differences in height indisputably to heredity rather than to  environment. No imaginable environmental differences could reverse the  positions of these two men, or of these two varieties of corn, the  heredity in each case being what it is. The large one might be stunted,  but the small one could not be made much larger. Photograph from A. F.  Blakeslee.]    This has actually been done,[6] and none of the conditions enumerated  has been found to be closely related to myopia in school children.  Correlations between fifteen environmental conditions and the goodness  of children's eyesight were measured, and only in one case was the  correlation as high as .1. The mean of these correlations was about  .04--an absolutely negligible quantity when compared with the common  heredity coefficient of .51.    Does this prove that the myopia is rather due to heredity? It would, by  a process of exclusion, if every conceivable environmental factor had  been measured and found wanting. That point in the investigation can  never be reached, but a tremendously strong suspicion is at least  justified. Now if the degree of resemblance between the prevalence of  myopia in parents and that in children be directly measured, and if it  be found that when the parent has eye trouble the child also has it,  then it seems that a general knowledge of heredity should lead to the  belief that the difficulty lies there, and that an environmental cause  for the poor vision of the school child was being sought, when it was  all the time due almost entirely to heredity. This final step has not  yet been completed in an adequate way,[7] but the evidence, partly  analogical, gives every reason to believe in the soundness of the  conclusion stated, that in most cases the schoolboy must wear glasses  because of his heredity, not because of overstudy or any neglect on the  part of his parents to care for his eyes properly during his childhood.    [Illustration: WHY MEN GROW SHORT OR TALL    FIG. 4.--Pedigree charts of the two men shown in the preceding  illustration. Squares represent men and circles women; figures  underlined denote measurement in stocking feet. It is obvious from a  comparison of the ancestry of the two men that the short one comes from  a predominantly short family, while the tall one gains his height  likewise from heredity. The shortest individual in the right-hand chart  would have been accounted tall in the family represented on the left.  After A. F. Blakeslee.]    The extent to which the intelligence of school children is dependent on  defective physique and unfavorable home environment is an important  practical question, which David Heron of London attacked by the methods  we have outlined. He wanted to find out whether the healthy children  were the most intelligent. One is constantly hearing stories of how the  intelligence of school children has been improved by some treatment  which improved their general health, but these stories are rarely  presented in such a way as to contribute evidence of scientific value.  It was desirable to know what exact measurement would show. The  intelligence of all the children in fourteen schools was measured in its  correlation with weight and height, conditions of clothing and teeth,  state of nutrition, cleanliness, good hearing, and the condition of the  cervical glands, tonsils and adenoids. It could not be found that mental  capacity was closely related to any of the characters dealt with.[8] The  particular set of characters measured was taken because it happened to  be furnished by data collected for another purpose; the various items  are suggestive rather than directly conclusive. Here again, the  correlation in most cases was less than .1, as compared with the general  heredity correlation of .5.    The investigation need not be limited to problems of bad breeding.  Eugenics, as its name shows, is primarily interested in \"good breeding;\"  it is particularly worth while, therefore, to examine the relations  between heredity and environment in the production of mental and moral  superiority.    If success in life--the kind of success that is due to great mental and  moral superiority--is due to the opportunities a man has, then it ought  to be pretty evenly distributed among all persons who have had favorable  opportunities, provided a large enough number of persons be taken to  allow the laws of probability full play. England offers a good field to  investigate this point, because Oxford and Cambridge, her two great  universities, turn out most of the eminent men of the country, or at  least have done so until recently. If nothing more is necessary to  ensure a youth's success than to give him a first-class education and  the chance to associate with superior people, then the prizes of life  ought to be pretty evenly distributed among the graduates of the two  universities, during a period of a century or two.    This is not the case. When we look at the history of England, as Galton  did nearly half a century ago, we find success in life to an unexpected  degree a family affair. The distinguished father is likely to have a  distinguished son, while the son of two \"nobodies\" has a very small  chance of becoming distinguished. To cite one concrete case, Galton  found[9] that the son of a distinguished judge had about one chance in  four of becoming himself distinguished, while the son of a man picked  out at random from the population had about one chance in 4,000 of  becoming similarly distinguished.    The objection at once occurs that perhaps social opportunities might  play the predominant part; that the son of an obscure man never gets a  chance, while the son of the prominent man is pushed forward regardless  of his inherent abilities. This, as Galton argued at length, can not be  true of men of really eminent attainments. The true genius, he thought,  frequently succeeds in rising despite great obstacles, while no amount  of family pull will succeed in making a mediocrity into a genius,  although it may land him in some high and very comfortable official  position. Galton found a good illustration in the papacy, where during  many centuries it was the custom for a pope to adopt one of his nephews  as a son, and push him forward in every way. If opportunity were all  that is required, these adopted sons ought to have reached eminence as  often as a real son would have done; but statistics show that they  reached eminence only as often as would be expected for nephews of great  men, whose chance is notably less, of course, than that of sons of great  men, in whom the intensity of heredity is much greater.    Transfer the inquiry to America, and it becomes even more conclusive,  for this is supposed to be the country of equal opportunities, where it  is a popular tradition that every boy has a chance to become president.  Success may be in some degree a family affair in caste-ridden England;  is it possible that the past history of the United States should show  the same state of affairs?    Galton found that about half of the great men of England had  distinguished close relatives. If the great men of America have fewer  distinguished close relatives, environment will be able to make out a  plausible case: it will be evident that in this continent of boundless  opportunities the boy with ambition and energy gets to the top, and that  this ambition and energy do not depend on the kind of family he comes  from.    Frederick Adams Woods has made precisely this investigation.[10] The  first step was to find out how many eminent men there are in American  history. Biographical dictionaries list about 3,500, and this number  provides a sufficiently unbiased standard from which to work. Now, Dr.  Woods says, if we suppose the average person to have as many as twenty  close relatives--as near as an uncle or a grandson--then computation  shows that only one person in 500 in the United States has a chance to  be a near relative of one of the 3,500 eminent men--provided it is  purely a matter of chance. As a fact, the 3,500 eminent men listed by  the biographical dictionaries are related to each other not as one in  500, but as one in five. If the more celebrated men alone be considered,  it is found that the percentage increases so that about one in three of  them has a close relative who is also distinguished. This ratio  increases to more than one in two when the families of the forty-six  Americans in the Hall of Fame are made the basis of study. If all the  eminent relations of those in the Hall of Fame are counted, they average  more than one apiece. Therefore, they are from five hundred to a  thousand times as much related to distinguished people as the ordinary  mortal is.    To look at it from another point of view, something like 1% of the  population of the country is as likely to produce a man of genius as is  all the rest of the population put together,--the other 99%.    This might still be due in some degree"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19562"],[0,"Napoleon and the Queen of Prussia (#5)"],[1,"ubtless, a French soldier, and his comrades are lying in  ambush,\" murmured Pueckler, placing his hand on his sword.    \"If he wants to attack us, he had better say his death-prayers,\" said  Schill, calmly. \"There are two of us, and each has one uninjured arm.\"    The youth had meanwhile drawn nearer, and they saw that he did not wear  any uniform.    \"He is very young,\" said Pueckler, \"and a civilian. He has apparently not  yet seen us. That bush yonder is concealing us from his eyes. Let us  stoop a little, and, as the path lies beyond, he may pass by without  noticing us.\"    They knelt down behind the bush, but, while doing so, took their swords,  and prepared for an attack. Then they held their breath and listened.    Profound silence reigned around, and nothing was to be heard but the  quick steps of the wanderer, who drew nearer and nearer. Suddenly this  silence was interrupted by a fresh and youthful voice, singing the air  of a popular song.    \"Ah, he sings,\" murmured Schill. \"He who can sing to-day, must be very  harmless, and it is not worth while to kill him.\"    \"Hush! hush! let us listen to his song. He is now singing words to the  melody. Just listen!\"    The voice resounded nearer and nearer to the two listeners, and they  could understand the words he was singing:        O Hermann! for thy country's fall          No tears! Where vanquished valor bled      The victor rules, and Slavery's pall,          Upon these hills and vales is spread.      Shame burns within me, for the brave      Lie mouldering in the freeman's grave.        No voice! where sturdy Luther spoke          Fearless for men who dared be free!      O would that Heaven's thunder woke          My people for their liberty!      Must heroes fight and die in vain?--      Ye cowards! grasp your swords again!        Revenge! revenge! a gory shroud          To tyrants, and the slaves that yield'      Eternal honor calls aloud          For courage in the battle-field.      Who loves or fears a conquered land      That bows beneath the despot's hand?        And whither flee? Where Winkelried          And Tell and Ruyter bravely broke      Oppression's power--their country freed--          All--all beneath the usurper's yoke!      From Alpine fountains to the sea      The patriot dead alone are free.        My people! in this sorrowing night,          The clanking of your chains may be      The sign of vengeance, and the fight          Of former times the world may see,      When Hermann in that storied day      As a wild torrent cleft his way.        No idle song, O youth! thy boast.          In self-born virtue be as one      Who is himself a mighty host          By whose sole arm is victory won.      No blazoned monument so grand      As death for the dear Fatherland.        To die! how welcome to the brave!          The tomb awakes no coward fear      Save to the wretched, trembling slave          Who for his country sheds no tear.      To crown me with a fadeless wreath      Be thine, O happy, sacred death!        Come, shining sword! avenge my dead!          Alone canst thou remove this shame.      Proud ornament! with slaughter red          Restore my native land its fame.      By night, by day, in sun or shade,      Be girt around me, trusty blade.        The trumpet on the morning gale!          Arm! forward to the bloody strife!      From loftiest mountain to the vale          Asks dying Freedom for her life.

Just when the youth had sung the last verse in a ringing voice, he had  reached the bush. And now there arose above it two pale heads, wrapped  in white, blood-stained handkerchiefs, and sang in enthusiastic tone the  last verse of the song they had heard:        Was das Lied nicht loeset, loest das Schwert!      Blinkend Heil, umguerte meine Hueften!      Vor der Schande kannst du Tapfre retten,      Zierde der Tapfern!          CHAPTER III.    THE OATH OF VENGEANCE.      Speechless with surprise, the youth had listened to the song, and fixed  his large eyes steadfastly on the two officers, whose uniforms and  wounds revealed to him the melancholy fate that had befallen them during  the last few days.    When the two were silent, he approached them with an air of profound  respect.    \"Bravo, officers of Auerstadt or Jena,\" he said, with a voice trembling  with emotion, \"permit a poor young wanderer to present his respects to  you, and to thank you, in the name of the German fatherland, for the  wounds on your foreheads. Such wounds are also an 'ornament of the  brave.'\" [An allusion to the last line of the original song.]    \"And such words are an ornament of a noble heart,\" exclaimed Schill,  offering his hand to the youth.    He took it with a joyful gesture, and, quickly kneeling down, imprinted  a glowing kiss on the feverish hand of the wounded officer.    \"My God!\" exclaimed Schill, surprised, \"what are you doing? How can a  man kiss another's hand and kneel before him? Rise!\"    \"I am no man,\" said the youth, deeply moved. \"I am but a poor boy, who  has not yet done any thing for his country, and, perhaps, never will be  able to do any thing for it, but who feels the most profound respect for  those who were more fortunate than he. I, therefore, kiss your hand as  Catholics kiss the hands of their saints and martyrs. For are you not at  the present hour a martyr of German liberty? Hence, sir, give me your  hand, too. Let me press my poor lips on it, also. It is the only way for  me to manifest my profound respect for you.\"    \"No,\" said Count Pueckler, feelingly, \"you shall not kiss my hand, but my  cheeks and my lips. Let me embrace you, young man, let me embrace you  for the boon you have conferred on us by your words. Come, sir!\"    The young man uttered a joyous cry, and, rising quickly, threw himself  with youthful impetuosity into the count's arms.    \"I will and must have my share in the embrace,\" exclaimed Schill,  smiling; \"did not you before expressly request me, comrade, to lend you  my left arm for every embrace? Well, then, here it is.\"    He quickly wound his left arm around the necks of the others, and  pressed them firmly to his heart. When they withdrew their arms again,  tears were glistening in the eyes of the officers as well as in those of  the youth.    \"Grief and adversity cause men easily to fraternize,\" said Schill, \"and  therefore we shall be brethren henceforward.\"    \"You will be my brethren?\" exclaimed the young man, joyfully. \"You will  permit the poor boy to call two heroes brethren?\"    \"Heroes!\" said Pueckler, sighing. \"Then you do not know, my friends, that  we were disgracefully defeated and trampled under foot in yesterday's  battle?\"    \"I know that, but know also that the _luck_ of battles is not the true  standard for the bravery of warriors. _You_ at least did not run, and,  like true heroes, you bear your wounds on your foreheads; your mothers,  therefore, will proudly bid you welcome; your betrothed or your wives  will embrace you with rapturous tears, and your friends will be proud of  your valor.\"    \"Does it not seem almost as though he had heard our mournful and  despondent words, and wished to comfort us?\" asked Schill, turning to  the count. \"His blue eyes apparently do not behold only our physical  wounds, but also those which cause our hearts to bleed, and he wishes to  apply a balm to them by his sweet, flattering words.\"    \"He wishes to console the poor defeated, and reconcile them to their  fate,\" said Pueckler, nodding kindly to the youth.    \"You have a better and more generous opinion of me than I deserve,\" he  said, sadly bowing his head so as to shake its exuberant mass of long,  fair hair. \"I simply told you what I thought, and what every one who  looks at both of you will and must think.\"    \"Would to God you spoke the truth, young man!\" said Count Pueckler,  mournfully. \"Believe me, however, but few will think like yourself; a  great many will rejoice at seeing us defeated and humiliated.\"    \"Instead of bewailing us, they will deride us,\" exclaimed Schill;  \"instead of weeping with us, they"]]]
