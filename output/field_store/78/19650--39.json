'A revolution in sentiment, manners, and moral opinions, the  most important of all revolutions in a word,' was in Burke's judgment to  be dated from the Sixth of October 1789.    The events of that day did, indeed, give its definite cast to the  situation. The moral authority of the sovereign came to an end, along  with the ancient and reverend mystery of the inviolability of his  person. The Count d'Artois, the King's second brother, one of the most  worthless of human beings, as incurably addicted to sinister and  suicidal counsels in 1789 as he was when he overthrew his own throne  forty years later, had run away from peril and from duty after the  insurrection of July. After the insurrection of October, a troop of the  nobles of the court followed him. The personal cowardice of the  Emigrants was only matched by their political blindness. Many of the  most unwise measures in the Assembly were only passed by small  majorities, and the majorities would have been transformed into  minorities, if in the early days of the Revolution these unworthy men  had only stood firm at their posts. Selfish oligarchies have scarcely  ever been wanting in courage. The emigrant noblesse of France are almost  the only instance of a great privileged and territorial caste that had  as little bravery as they had patriotism. The explanation is that they  had been an oligarchy, not of power or duty, but of self-indulgence.  They were crushed by Richelieu to secure the unity of the monarchy. They  now effaced themselves at the Revolution, and this secured that far  greater object, the unity of the nation.    The disappearance of so many of the nobles from France was not the only  abdication on the part of the conservative powers. Cowed and terrified  by the events of October, no less than three hundred members of the  Assembly sought to resign. The average attendance even at the most  important sittings was often incredibly small. Thus the Chamber came to  have little more moral authority in face of the people of Paris than had  the King himself. The people of Paris had themselves become in a day the  masters of France.    This immense change led gradually to a decisive alteration in the  position of Robespierre. He found the situation of affairs at last  falling into perfect harmony with his doctrine. Rousseau had taught him  that the people ought to be sovereign, and now the people were being  recognised as sovereign _de facto_ no less than _de jure_. Any  limitations on the new divine right united the horror of blasphemy to  the secular wickedness of political treason. After the Assembly had come  to Paris, a famishing mob in a moment of mad fury murdered an  unfortunate baker, who was suspected of keeping back bread. These  paroxysms led to the enactment of a new martial law. Robespierre spoke  vehemently against it; such a law implied a wrongful distrust of the  people. Then discussions followed as to the property qualification of an  elector. Citizens were classed as active and passive. Only those were to  have votes who paid direct taxes to the amount of three days' wages in  the year. Robespierre flung himself upon this too famous distinction  with bitter tenacity. If all men are equal, he cried, then all men  ought to have votes: if he who only pays the amount of one day's work,  has fewer rights than another who pays the amount of three days, why  should not the man who pays ten days have more rights than the other who  only pays the earnings of three days? This kind of reasoning had little  weight with the Chamber, but it made the reasoner very popular with the  throng in the galleries. Even within the Assembly, influence gradually  came to the man who had a parcel of immutable axioms and postulates, and  who was ready with a deduction and a phrase for each case as it arose.  He began to stand out like a needle of sharp rock, amid the flitting  shadows of uncertain purpose and the vapoury drift of wandering aims.    Robespierre had no social conception, and he had nothing which can be  described as a policy. He was the prophet of a sect, and had at this  period none of the aims of the chief of a political party. What he had  was democratic doctrine, and an intrepid logic. And Robespierre's  intrepid logic was the nearest approach to calm force and coherent  character that the first three years of the Revolution brought into  prominence. When the Assembly met, Necker was the popular idol. Almost  within a few weeks, this well-meaning, but very incompetent divinity had  slipped from his throne, and Lafayette had taken his place. Mirabeau  came next. The ardent and animated genius of his eloquence fitted him  above all men to ride the whirlwind and direct the storm. And on the  memorable Twenty-third of June '89, he had shown the genuine audacity  and resource of a revolutionary statesman, when he stirred the Chamber  to defy the King's demand, and hailed the royal usher with the  resounding words:--'You, sir, have neither place nor right of speech. Go  tell those who sent you that we are here by the will of the people, and  only bayonets shall drive us hence!' But Mirabeau bore a tainted  character, and was always distrusted. 'Ah, how the immorality of my  youth,' he used to say, in words that sum up the tragedy of many a  puissant life, 'how the immorality of my youth hinders the public good!'  The event proved that the popular suspicion was just: the patriot is now  no longer merely suspected, but known, to have sullied his hands with  the money of the court. He did not sell himself, it has been said; he  allowed himself to be paid. The distinction was too subtle for men doing  battle for their lives and for freedom, and Mirabeau's popularity waned  towards the middle of 1790. The next favourite was Barnave, the generous  and high-minded spokesman of those sanguine spirits who to the very end  hoped against hope to save both the throne and its occupant. By the  spring of 1791 Barnave followed his predecessors into disfavour. The  Assembly was engaged on the burning question of the government of the  colonies. Were the negro slaves to be admitted to citizenship, or was a  legislature of planters to be entrusted with the task of social  reformation? Our own generation has seen in the republic of the West  what strife this political difficulty is capable of raising. Barnave  pronounced against the negroes. Robespierre, on the contrary, declaimed  against any limitation of the right of the negro, as a compromise with  the avarice, pride, and cruelty of a governing race, and a guilty  trafficking with the rights of man. Barnave from that day saw that his  laurel crown had gone to Robespierre.    If the people 'called him noble that was now their hate, him vile that  was their garland,' they did not transfer their affections without sound  reason. Barnave's sensibility was too easily touched. There are many  politicians in every epoch whose principles grow slack and flaccid at  the approach of the golden sun of royalty. Barnave was one of those who  was sent to bring back the fugitive King and Queen from Varennes, and  the journey by their side in the coach unstrung his spirit. He became  one of the court's clandestine advisers. Men of this weak susceptibility  of imagination are not fit for times of revolution. To be on the side of  the court was to betray the cause of the nation. We cannot take too much  pains to realise that the voluntary conversion of Lewis the Sixteenth to  a popular constitution and the abolition of feudalism, was practically  as impossible as the conversion of Pope Pius the Ninth to the doctrine  of a free church in a free state. Those who believe in the miracle of  free will may think of this as they please. Sensible people who accept  the scientific account of human character, know that the sudden  transformation of a man or a woman brought up to middle age as the heir  to centuries of absolutist tradition, into adherents of a government  that agreed with the doctrines of Locke and Milton, was only possible on  condition of supernatural interference. The King's good nature was no  substitute for political capacity or insight. An instructive measure of  the degree in which he possessed these two qualities may be found in  that deplorable diary of his, where on such days as the Fourteenth of  July, when the Bastille fell, and the Sixth of October, when he was  carried in triumph from Versailles to the Tuileries, he made the simple  entry, '_Rien_.' And he had no firmness. It was as difficult to keep the  King to a purpose, La Marck said to Mirabeau, as to keep together a  number of well-oiled ivory balls. Lewis, moreover, was guided by a more  energetic and less compliant character than his own.    Marie Antoinette's high mien in adversity, and the contrast between the  dazzling splendour of her first years and the scenes of outrage and  bloody death that made the climax of her fate, could not but strike the  imaginations of men. Such contrasts are the very stuff of which Tragedy,  the gorgeous muse with scepter'd pall, loves to weave her most imposing  raiment. But history must be just; and the character of the Queen had  far more concern in the disaster of the first five years of the  Revolution than had the character of Robespierre. Every new document  that comes to light heaps up proof that if blind and obstinate choice  of personal gratification before the common weal be enough to constitute  a state criminal, then the Queen of France was one of the worst state  criminals that ever afflicted a nation. The popular hatred of Marie  Antoinette sprang from a sound instinct. We shall never know how much or  how little truth there was in those frightful charges against her, that  may still be read in a thousand pamphlets.

The third  hall will bring you into a garden, planted with fine fruit trees. When  you have crossed the garden, you will come to a terrace, where you will  find a niche, and in the niche a lighted lamp. Take the lamp down, and  when you have put out the light and poured away the oil, bring it to me.  If you would like to gather any of the fruit of the garden you may do  so, provided you do not linger.\"    Then the Magician put a ring on Aladdin's finger, which he told him was  to preserve him from evil, and sent him down into the cavern.    [Illustration]    Aladdin found everything just as the Magician had said. He passed  through the three halls, crossed the garden, took down the lamp from  the niche, poured out the oil, put the lamp into his bosom, and turned  to go back.    As he came down from the terrace, he stopped to look at the trees of the  garden, which were laden with wonderful fruits. To Aladdin's eyes it  appeared as if these fruits were only bits of colored glass, but in  reality they were jewels of the rarest quality. Aladdin filled his  pockets full of the dazzling things, for though he had no idea of their  real value, yet he was attracted by their dazzling brilliance. He had  so loaded himself with these treasures that when at last he came to the  steps he was unable to climb them without assistance.    \"Pray, Uncle,\" he said, \"give me your hand to help me out.\"    \"Give me the lamp first,\" replied the Magician.    \"Really, Uncle, I cannot do so until I am out of this place,\" answered  Aladdin, whose hands were, indeed, so full that he could not get at the  lamp.    But the Magician refused to help Aladdin up the steps until he had  handed over the lamp. Aladdin was equally determined not to give it up  until he was out of the cavern, and, at last, the Magician fell into a  furious rage. Throwing some more of the powder into the fire, he again  said the magic words. No sooner had he done so than there was a  tremendous thunder-clap, the stone rolled back into its place, and  Aladdin was a prisoner in the cavern. The poor boy cried aloud to his  supposed uncle to help him; but it was all in vain, his cries could not  be heard. The doors in the garden were closed by the same enchantment,  and Aladdin sat down on the steps in despair, knowing that there was  little hope of his ever seeing his Mother again.    For two terrible days he lay in the cavern waiting for death. On the  third day, realizing that it could not now be far off, he clasped his  hands in anguish, thinking of his Mother's sorrow; and in so doing he  accidently rubbed the ring which the Magician had put upon his finger.    Immediately a genie of enormous size rose out of the earth, and, as  Aladdin started back in fright and horror, said to him:    [Illustration]    \"What wouldst thou have of me?\"    \"Who are you?\" gasped Aladdin.    \"I am the slave of the ring. I am ready to obey thy commands,\" came the  answer.    Aladdin was still trembling; but the danger he was in already made him  answer without hesitation:    \"Then, if you are able, deliver me, I beseech you, from this place.\"    Scarcely had he spoken, when he found himself lying on the ground at the  place to which the Magician had first brought him.    He hastened home to his Mother, who had mourned him as dead. As soon as  he had told her all his adventures, he begged her to get him some food,  for he had now been three days without eating.    \"Alas, child!\" replied his Mother, \"I have not a bit of bread to give  you.\"    \"Never mind, Mother,\" said Aladdin, \"I will go and sell the old lamp  which I brought home with me. Doubtless I shall get a little money for  it.\"    His Mother reached down the lamp; but seeing how dirty it was, she  thought it would sell better if she cleaned it. But no sooner had she  begun to rub it than a hideous genie appeared before her, and said in  a voice like thunder:    \"What wouldst thou have of me? I am ready to obey thy commands, I and  all the other slaves of the lamp.\"    [Illustration]    Aladdin's Mother fainted away at the sight of this creature; but  Aladdin, having seen the genie of the ring, was not so frightened,  and said boldly:    \"I am hungry, bring me something to eat.\"    The genie disappeared, but returned in an instant with twelve silver  dishes, filled with different kinds of savory meats, six large white  loaves, two bottles of wine, and two silver drinking cups. He placed  these things on the table and then vanished.    Aladdin fetched water, and sprinkling some on his Mother's face soon  brought her back to life again.    When she opened her eyes and saw all the good things the genie had  provided, she was overcome with astonishment.    \"To whom are we indebted for this feast?\" she cried. \"Has the Sultan  heard of our poverty and sent us these fine things from his own table?\"    \"Never mind now how they came here,\" said Aladdin. \"Let us first eat,  then I will tell you.\"    Mother and son made a hearty meal, and then Aladdin told his Mother that  it was the genie of the lamp who had brought them the food. His Mother  was greatly alarmed, and begged him to have nothing further to do with  genies, advising him to sell the lamp at once. But Aladdin would not  part with such a wonderful possession, and resolved to keep both the  ring and the lamp safely, in case he should ever need them again. He  showed his Mother the fruits which he had gathered in the garden, and  his Mother admired their bright colors and dazzling radiance, though  she had no idea of their real value.    Not many days after this, Aladdin was walking in the streets of the  city, when he heard a fanfare of trumpets announcing the passing of the  Princess Badroulboudour, the Sultan's only daughter. Aladdin stopped to  see her go by, and was so struck by her great beauty that he fell in  love with her on the spot and made up his mind to win her for his bride.    \"Mother,\" he said, \"I cannot live without the Princess Badroulboudour.  You must go to the Sultan and demand her hand in marriage for me.\"    [Illustration]    Aladdin's Mother burst out laughing at the idea of her son wishing to be  the son-in-law of the Sultan, and told him to put such thoughts out of  his head at once. But Aladdin was not to be laughed out of his fancy. He  knew by this time that the fruits which he had gathered from the magic  garden were jewels of great value, and he insisted upon his Mother  taking them to the Sultan for a present, and asking the hand of the  Princess in marriage for her son.    The poor woman was terribly frightened, fearing lest the Sultan should  punish her for her impudence; but Aladdin would hear of no excuses, and  at last she set forth in fear and trembling, bearing the jewels on a  china dish covered with a napkin.    [Illustration]    When she came before the Sultan, she told him, with many apologies and  pleas for forgiveness, of her son's mad love for the Princess  Badroulboudour. The Sultan smiled at the idea of the son of a poor old  woman asking for the hand of his daughter, and asked her what she had  under the napkin. But when the woman uncovered the jewels, he started up  from his throne in amazement, for he had never before seen so many large  and magnificent jewels collected together. He thought Aladdin must be a  very unusual and extraordinary person to be able to make him such a  valuable present, and he began to wonder whether it might not be worth  while to bestow the Princess's hand upon him. However, he thought he  would ask for some further proof of his wealth and power; so, turning  to the woman, he said:    \"Good Mother, tell your son he shall have the Princess Badroulboudour  for his wife as soon as he sends me forty basins of gold, filled with  jewels as valuable as these, and borne by forty black and forty white  slaves. Hasten now and carry him my message. I will await your return.\"    Aladdin's Mother was dismayed at this request.    \"Where can Aladdin get such basins and jewels and slaves?\" she thought,  as she hurried home to him. But Aladdin only smiled when his Mother gave  him the Sultan's message. He rubbed the lamp, and at once the genie  stood before him, asking him what was his pleasure.    \"Go,\" said Aladdin, \"fetch me forty basins all of massive gold, full of  jewels, borne by forty black and forty white slaves.\"    The genie brought these things at once, and Aladdin then sent his Mother  with them to the Sultan.    [Illustration]    The Sultan was amazed at this wonderful show of wealth and at the  quickness with which it had been brought, and he sent for Aladdin to  come to the Court.    Aladdin first summoned the genie to bring him fine clothes and a  splendid horse, and a retinue fit for the future son-in-law of the  Sultan; and then, with a train of slaves bearing magnificent presents  for the Princess, he set out for the Palace.    The Sultan would have married him to his daughter at once; but Aladdin  asked him to wait until the next morning, when he hoped to have a Palace  worthy to receive his wife.    Once again he summoned the genie to his aid, and commanded him to build  a Palace that in beauty and magnificence should surpass any that had  ever been built on the earth before.    The next morning when the Sultan awoke and looked out of his window, he  saw, opposite to his own, the most wonderful Palace he had ever seen.  The walls were built of gold and silver, and encrusted with diamonds,  rubies and emeralds, and other rare and precious stones. The stables  were filled with the finest horses; beautiful gardens surrounded the  building, and everywhere were hundreds of slaves and servants to wait  on the Princess.    The Sultan was so overcome with all this magnificence, that he insisted  upon marrying his daughter to Aladdin that very day, and the young  couple took up their residence in"]]]
