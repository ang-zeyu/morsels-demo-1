No one legislative act has ever been so widely  comprehensive in its results for good as they declare that this act  shall be. No one legislative act has ever raised the entire race even  within sight of the point of elevation predicted by the champions of  what is called the emancipation of woman. Hear them speak for  themselves: \"It is hardly possible, with our present experience, to  raise our imaginations to the conception of so great a change for the  better as would be made by its removal\"--the removal of the principle  of the subordination of the wife to the husband, and the establishment  of the entire independence of women, to be obtained by female suffrage.  These are not the words of some excited woman making a speech at a  public meeting. The quotation is from the writings of Mr. Stuart Mill.  The subordination of the wife to the husband is declared by Mr. Mill to  be \"the citadel of the enemy.\" Storm the citadel, proclaim the entire  independence of the wife, and our feeble imaginations, we are told, are  utterly incapable of conceiving the glorious future of the race  consequent upon this one step. This is a very daring assertion. It is  so bold, indeed, as to require something of positive proof ere we can  yield to it our implicit belief. The citadel we are urged to storm was  built by the hand of God. The flag waving over that citadel is the flag  of the Cross. When the Creator made one entire sex so much more feeble  in physical powers than the other, a degree of subordination on the  part of the weaker sex became inevitable, unless it were counteracted  by increase of mental ability, strengthened by special precept. But the  mental ability, so far as there is a difference, and the precept, are  both on the side of the stronger sex. The whole past history of the  race coincides so clearly with these facts that we should suppose that  even those who are little under the influence of Christian faith might  pause era they attacked that citadel. Common-sense might teach them  something of caution, something of humility, when running counter to  the whole past experience of the race. As for those who have a living  belief in the doctrines of Christianity, when they find that revealed  religion, from the first of the Prophets to the last of the Apostles,  allots a subordinate position to the wife, they are compelled to  believe Moses and St. Paul in the right, and the philosophers of the  present day, whether male or female, in the wrong. To speak frankly,  the excessive boldness of these new theories, the incalculable and  inconceivable benefits promised us from this revolution from the  natural condition of things in Christendom--and throughout the world  indeed--would lead us to suspicion. Guides who appeal to the  imagination when discussing practical questions are not generally  considered the safest. And the champions of female suffrage are  necessarily compelled to take this course. They have no positive  foundation to rest on. Mr. Stuart Mill has said in Parliament, in  connection with this subject, that \"the tyranny of established custom  has entirely passed away.\" Nothing can be more true than this  assertion. As a rule, the past is now looked upon with doubt, with  suspicion, often with a certain sort of contempt, very far from being  always consistent with sound reason. The tyranny of the present  day--and it may be just as much a tyranny as the other--is radically  opposite in character. It is the tyranny of novelty to which we are  most exposed at present. The dangers lie chiefly in that direction.  There will be little to fear from the old until the hour of reaction  arrives, as it inevitably must, if the human mind be strained too far  in a new direction. At present the more startling an assertion, the  farther it wanders from all past experience, the greater are its  chances of attracting attention, of gaining adherents, of achieving at  least a partial and temporary success. In the age and in the country  which has seen the development of Mormonism as a successful religious,  social, and political system, nothing should surprise us. Such is the  restlessness of human nature that it will often, from mere weak  hankering after change, hug to its bosom the wildest theories, and  yield them a temporary allegiance.    Let us suppose that to-day the proposed revolution were effected; all  women, without restriction, even the most vile, would be summoned to  vote in accordance with their favorite theory of inalienable right.  That class of women, and other degraded classes of the ignorant and  unprincipled, will always be ready to sell their votes many times  over--to either party, to both parties, to the highest bidder, in  short. They will sell their vote much more readily than the lowest  classes of men now do. They will hold it with greater levity. They will  trifle with it. They will sell their vote any day for a yard of ribbon  or a tinsel brooch--unless they are offered two yards of ribbon or two  brooches. They will vote over again every hour of every election day,  by cunning disguises and trickery. And thus, so far as women are  concerned, the most degraded element in society will, in fact,  represent the whole sex. Nay, they will probably not unfrequently  command the elections, as three colored women are said once to have  done in New Jersey. A hundred honest and intelligent women can have but  one vote each, and at least fifty of these will generally stay at home.  If, which God forbid, it actually comes to female voting, a very small  proportion of the sex will, at common elections, appear at the polls.  Avocations more urgent, more natural to them, and in which they are  more deeply interested, will keep them away. The degraded women will be  there by the scores, as tools of men, enjoying both the importance of  the hour, the fun, and THE PAY. Fifty women, known to be thieves and  prostitutes, will hold, at a moderate calculation, say two hundred  votes. And, as women form the majority of the resident population in  some States, that wretched element of society will, in fact, govern  those States, or those who bribe them will do so. Massachusetts, very  favorable to female suffrage now, will probably come round to the  opinion of New Jersey in former days. Great will be the consumption of  cheap ribbons, and laces, and artificial flowers, and feathers, and  tinsel jewelry, in every town and village about election time, after  emancipation is achieved. We are compelled to believe so, judging from  our knowledge of human nature, and of the use already made of bribery  at many elections. The demagogues will be more powerful than ever.  Their work will be made easy for them. It seems, indeed, probable that  under the new era our great elections shall become a sort of grand  national gift concerns, of which the most active demagogues of all  parties will be the managers. Not that women are more mercenary, or  more unprincipled than men. God forbid! That would be saying too much.  We entirely believe the reverse to be true. But the great mass of women  can never be made to take a deep, a sincere, a discriminating, a  lasting interest in the thousand political questions ever arising to be  settled by the vote. They very soon weary of such questions. On great  occasions they can work themselves up to a state of frenzied excitement  over some one political question. At such times they can parade a  degree of unreasoning prejudice, of passionate hatred, of blind fury,  even beyond what man can boast of. But, in their natural condition, in  everyday life, they do not take instinctively to politics as men do.  Men are born politicians; just as they are born masons, and carpenters,  and soldiers, and sailors. Not so women. Their thoughts and feelings  are given to other matters. The current of their chosen avocations runs  in another channel than that of politics--a channel generally quite out  of sight of politics; it is an effort for them to turn from one to the  other. With men, on the contrary, politics, either directly or  indirectly, are closely, palpably, inevitably blended with their  regular work in life. They give their attention unconsciously,  spontaneously; to politics. Look at a family of children, half boys,  half girls; the boys take instinctively to whips and guns and balls and  bats and horses, to fighting and wrestling and riding; the girls fondle  their dolls, beg for a needle and thread, play at housekeeping, at  giving tea-parties, at nursing the sick baby, at teaching school. That  difference lasts through life. Give your son, as he grows up, a gun and  a vote; he will delight in both. Give your daughter, as she grows up, a  gun and a vote, and, unless she be an exceptional woman, she will make  a really good use of neither. Your son may be dull; but he will make a  good soldier, and a very tolerable voter. Your daughter may be very  clever; but she would certainly run away on the battle-held, and very  probably draw a caricature on the election ticket. There is the making  of an admirable wife and mother, and a valuable member of society, in  that clever young woman. She is highly intelligent, thoroughly well  educated, reads Greek and Latin, and has a wider range of knowledge and  thought than ninety-nine in a hundred of the voters in the same  district; but there is nothing of the politician in her nature. She  would rather any day read a fine poem than the best political speech of  the hour. What she does know of politics reaches her through that dull  but worthy brother of hers. It is only occasionally that we meet women  with an inherent bias for politics; and those are not, as a rule, the  highest type of the sex--it is only occasionally that they are so. The  interest most women feel in politics is secondary, factitious,  engrafted on them by"]]]
