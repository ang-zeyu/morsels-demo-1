The lines in Figs. 18 and 19  designate about the right amount of wax after the work is ready, but it  is well to add a little more than is shown in those figures, and you  should be careful to keep the wax of equal bulk all around, or when it  cools it will have a tendency to draw the staff to one side. Now remove  the lamp and keep the lathe revolving until the wax is quite cool, when  it should be removed, by means of a graver, down to the dimensions  designated by the lines in Figs. 18 and 19. When this is accomplished  re-heat a little, but only enough to make it soft, but not liquid, and  placing a sharpened peg-wood on the tool rest proceed to the final truing  up, by resting the pointed end against the hub.          CHAPTER VI.      I have described above one of the methods in vogue for holding a staff by  means of wax. It is the common method employed by most watch repairers,  the popular method so to speak. The method which I am now about to  describe may seem awkward at first to those who have not practiced it,  but once you have fairly tried it, you will never be contented to work in  any other way.    The first requisite is a true taper chuck; and it is well to purchase an  extra one to be used solely for this purpose, so that you will be  prepared at all times for staff work. Select a good steel taper, and  having placed your chuck in the lathe, see if your taper fits well by  inserting it in the chuck while running slowly. If it fits well, it will  be marked almost throughout its length. Insert again in the chuck, and  with a few light taps of the hammer set it firmly in place, so that you  know that there is no danger of its working loose. The taper will then  project about three-quarters of an inch from the face of the chuck. By  means of a sharp graver, make the face of the taper smooth and straight,  and cut off the taper end. Now mark a point on the taper about one-fourth  of an inch from the end, and proceed to turn down the diameter from this  point to the end, leaving that portion of the taper about two-thirds of  its original diameter, and finish with a nice square shoulder. Now with  a long-pointed sharp graver proceed to cut a nice V-shaped center with an  angle of about 60 deg.. When you have proceeded thus far you will find that  you have an implement resembling that shown in Fig. 22.    [Illustration: _Fig. 22._]    Care must be taken that the center is quite true, and that no projection  is left like that illustrated in Fig. 21, no matter how minute it may be.  Now examine the center by the aid of a strong glass, and after you are  satisfied with its appearance proceed to test it. Take a large sized pin  with a good point, and placing the point in the center, maintain it in  position by pressing upon the head, and while revolving the lathe slowly  proceed to examine by means of your glass. If the center is a good one  there will be no perceptible vibration of the pin.    Now procure a piece of small brass tubing with an internal diameter a  little less than that of the turned down portion of your taper. If the  brass tubing cannot be procured readily, you can substitute a piece of  brass wire a little larger than the taper, and by means of a drill a  little smaller in diameter than the turned down portion you can readily  make a small tube about one-half inch long. Now by means of a broach  proceed to open the tube to a point one-quarter inch from one end, and  carefully fit it on the turned down portion of your taper. After fitting  tightly to the shoulder of the taper, proceed to turn out the other end  until it will take in the hub of your staff easily and leave a little  room to spare. Now turn your tube down in length until a little of the  hub is exposed either way you put the staff in. Turn the outside of the  tube smooth and to correspond with the outline of the taper, so you will  have a nice looking job when completed. Just below where the hub will  come drill a small hole in the tube and remove all burr, both inside and  out, that may have been made in drilling, so that the shellac or wax will  not adhere to it. This little hole acts as an outlet for the air in the  tube; and as the hot shellac enters at the end of the tube the air is  expelled through this vent. It also helps to hold the cement firmly in  place. Now try your staff in the tube again, and be sure that it is quite  free, and that you will be able to work on the portions of it above and  below the hub, according as one end or the other is inserted.    You are now ready to insert your staff and proceed with your work. Hold  your shellac in the flame of your lamp a moment until it is quite liquid,  and then smear both the inside and outside of the tube with it. Heat the  shell or tube gently by means of the lamp, keeping the lathe revolving  slowly all the while, and taking the staff in your tweezers proceed to  insert it carefully into the tube. Press firmly back, making sure that it  has reached the bottom of the V-shaped center. Pack the cement well in  around the staff, and while centering remove the lamp and allow the  whole to cool, keeping the whole revolving until quite cool. Now remove  the superfluous cement by means of the graver, and heating the tube again  slightly, proceed to center exactly by means of a pointed peg-wood,  resting on your T rest to steady it. Turn slowly in the lathe and examine  with glass to see that it is quite true. Your completed instrument will  resemble Fig. 23.    [Illustration: _Fig. 23._]    The advantage of the device is that your center is always ready, and all  you have to do is to insert your chuck in the lathe, warm it, and you are  ready to insert your staff and proceed to work. As I said in the first  place, it is well to employ a taper chuck exclusively for this work, and  not attempt to use it for any other, for if you try to remove your taper  and replace it again, you will surely find that your work is out of  center, and you will be compelled to remove the brass shell and find a  new center each time you use it. You can avoid all this trouble, however,  by purchasing an extra chuck and devoting it exclusively to wax work. Of  course, the brass shell can be removed and placed in position again  without in any way affecting the truth of the center, and any number,  shape and size of shells can be made to fit the one taper, and these  shells will be found very useful for holding a variety of work, aside  from balance staffs.          CHAPTER VII.      The two popular methods of holding a balance staff in wax have been  described and illustrated; the reader may take his choice. The turning  and finishing of the other end of the staff is performed as previously  described. That portion on which the hair-spring collet goes should be  turned to nearly the proper size, making due allowance for the grinding  and polishing that is to come. The balance seat should be slightly  undercut, so that the balance can be driven on tightly and all riveting  dispensed with. The size for the pivot can be determined from its jewel,  as previously described. Finish the ends of the pivots flat and round the  corners off slightly; and right here comes a point worthy of  consideration in all watch work. Leave no absolutely square corners in  any of your work, but round them off very slightly. This may seem a very  little thing, but it is one of the small things that go to make up  first-class work. You can judge pretty accurately of a watchmaker by the  corners he leaves on his work, as well as by the appearance of his  gravers and screw-drivers.    When your staff is completed and nicely polished, remove from the wax and  boil in alcohol to clean, and when dried it is ready for the balance.  Great care must be exercised in removing the balance from the old staff,  especially if it be a compensation balance, that you do not distort it  any way. If the balance has been riveted on extra care will have to be  exercised. The riveting may be cut by means of a graver, or a hollow  drill made from Stubb's steel wire. The recess in the drill should just  fit over the shoulder left for the reception of the hair-spring collet.  The edge of the hollow drill has small teeth formed upon it similar to a  fine file, and will cut quite rapidly.    After removing the balance, if it appears to be sprung in the arms, the  result of removal or previous bad treatment, proceed to bend them  straight, and then to true up the rim carefully, and stake on with a flat  end punch. Now put on your roller and drive it down to the hub and see  that the roller is free from the fork. See that jewel pin reaches fork  properly and that the guard pin also reaches the roller. See that your  balance is free from the plate and the bridge. If the balance is true and  all right, you are ready to put on your hair-spring. See that it is in  beat. It is well to make a mark on the balance before taking off the old  staff, showing positions of hair-spring stud and jewel pin.    Three-quarter plate English lever and Swiss lever balance staffs differ  only in detail, except that they are sprung under balances. The general  operations for making, however, are similar to those described.    I have not described the method of poising the balance for two reasons;  first, the mere poising of a balance for a cheap movement is so simple  that it needs no explanation; and second, to describe the poising of the  balance of a fine watch is a lengthy task, and can hardly be included  under the heading of staffing and pivoting. The ground has been  thoroughly and conscientiously covered by Mr. J. L. Finn, in a little  volume entitled Poising the Balance,[A] and I would advise all  watchmakers, both young and old, to read what he has to say.    Good pivoting is an art in itself,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20318"],[0,"Little Journeys to the Homes of the Great - Volume 14 (#5)"],[1,"the Conqueror, Leonardo da Vinci, Erasmus, the Empress  Josephine, Alexander Hamilton and Abraham Lincoln!\" But he didn't--he  did better--he said nothing. Wagner had the pride that scorned a  defense--he realized his priceless birthright, and knew that his mother  and father had dowered him with a divine genius. Let those talk who  could do nothing else: silence was his only answer.    In a year later, Nietzsche was taken to an asylum, dead at the top. He  lingered on until Nineteen Hundred, when his body, too, died, died there  at Weimar, the home of Goethe and the home of Franz Liszt--another of  life's little ironies. It is an obvious thing to say that Friedrich  Nietzsche was insane all the time. The fact is, he was not. He was a  great, sincere and honest soul, intent on living the ideal life. He  wrote thoughts that have passed into the current coin of all the  thinking world. When he praised Wagner to the skies and afterwards  damned him to the lowest depths of perdition, he was sane, and did the  thing that has been done since Cain slew his brother Abel. Take it home  to yourself--haven't the best things and the worst that have ever been  said about you, been expressed by the same person?    The opinion of any one person concerning any man of genius, or any  product of art, is absolutely valueless. Whim, prejudice, personal bias,  and physical condition color our view and tint our opinions, and when we  cease to love a man personally, to condemn his art is an easy and  natural step. What was before pleasing is now preposterous.    Of course, it is all a point of view--a matter of perspective, and most  of us are a trifle out of focus. When we change our opinions we change  our friends.    As a prescription for preserving a just and proper view, and living a  sane life, I would say, climb a tree occasionally, and hoot like an owl  and caw like a crow; stand on your head and yell at times like a  Comanche.    Robert Louis Stevenson says, \"A man who has not had the courage to make  a fool of himself has not lived.\"    The man who does not relax and hoot a few hoots voluntarily, now and  then, is in great danger of hooting hoots and standing on his head for  the edification of the pathologist and trained nurse, a little later on.    The madhouse yawns for the person who always does the proper thing.  Impropriety, in right proportion, relieves congestion, and thus are the  unities preserved. And so here the great Law of Compensation, invented  by Ralph Waldo Emerson, comes in: The sane, healthy man, who  occasionally strips off his dignity and hoots like an owl, or rolls  naked in the snow, will surely be called insane by the self-nominated  elect, but his personal compensation lies in the fact that he knows he  is not.           *       *       *       *       *    And now look upon the face of this man! Even so, and upon every face is  written the record of the life the man has led: the loves that were his,  the thoughts, the prayers, the aspirations, the disappointments, all he  hoped to be and was not--all are written there--nothing is hidden, nor  can it be. Here was one born in poverty, nurtured in adversity, and yet  uplifted and sustained by homely friendships and rugged companions who  dumbly guessed the latent greatness of their charge.    With soul athirst he sought for truth, and stubbornly groped his way  alone. Immediate precedent stood to him for little, and his sincerity  and honesty made him the butt of mob and rabble. His ambition to be  himself, to live his life, the desire to express his honest thought, led  straight to deprivation of bread and shelter. He had too much sympathy,  his honesty was not tempered by the graces of a diplomat--a price was  placed upon his head. By the help of that one noble friend, whose love  upheld him to the last, he escaped to a country where freedom of speech  is not a byword. But misunderstanding followed close upon his footsteps,  even his wife doubted his sanity, mistaking his genius for folly, and  died undeceived. Calumny, hate, brutal criticism, the contempt of the  so-called learned class--and all the train of woe that want and debt can  bring to bear were his lot and portion.    Still he struggled on, refusing to compromise or parley--he would live  his life, expressing the divinity within, and if fate decreed it so, die  the death, misunderstood, reviled, and be forgotten.    And so he lived, working, praying, hoping, toiling, travailing--but with  days, now and then, when rifts broke the clouds and the sun shone  through, his Other Self giving approbation by saying, \"Well done! the  work will live.\"    More than half a century had passed over his head, and the frost of  years had whitened his locks; his form was bowed from the many burdens  it had borne; the fine face furrowed with lines of care; his eyes grown  dim from weeping--when gradually the critics grew less severe.    Advocates were coming to the front, demanding that brutal hands should  no longer mangle this man: grudgingly pardon came for offenses never  committed, and he was permitted to return to his native land. Strong men  and women placed themselves on his side. They declared their faith, and  said his work was sublime; and they boldly stated the patent fact that  those who had done most to cry Wagner down, had themselves done nothing,  nor added an iota to the wealth or the harmony of the world. People  began to listen, to investigate, and they said, \"Why, yes, the music of  Wagner has a distinct style--it has individuality.\"    Individuality is a departure from a complete type, and so is never  perfect, any more than man is perfect. But Wagner's music is honest and  genuine emotion set to sweet sounds, with words in keeping. It mirrors  the hopes, the disappointments, the aspirations and the love of a great  soul.    As men and women grew to cultivate the hospitable mind and receptive  heart, tears filled their eyes and as they listened they came to  understand. Honesty and genuineness in souls are too rare to flout--when  found men really uncover before them. The people saw at last that they  had been deceived by the savants, blinded by the dust of paid and  prejudiced critics, fooled by those who led the way for a consideration.  They flocked to see the great composer and listen to his matchless  music, and they gave the man and his work their approval. Such sums were  paid to him as he had only read of in books. Adulation, approbation and  crowning fame were his at last.    Then love came that way and gentle, trusting affection, and sweet,  spiritual comradeship, such as he had never known except in dreams--all  these were his. His fame increased, and lavish offers from across the  sea came, proffering him such wealth and honor as were not for any other  living artist.    A theater was built for the presentation of his productions alone; the  lovers of music from every nation made Bayreuth a place of pilgrimage.    When the man died--passed peacefully away, supported by the arms of the  one woman he had loved--the daughter of Liszt--the art-loving world  paid his genius all the tribute that men can offer to the worth of other  men.    And now the passing years have brought a confirmation in belief of the  statement made by Franz Liszt, \"Richard Wagner is the one true musical  genius of his age.\"    Wagner's admirers should, for him, plead guilty to the worst that can be  said: he is everything that his most bitter critics say, but he is so  much more that his faults and follies sink into ashes before the divine  fire of his genius, and we still have the gold. Inconsistent,  paradoxical, preposterous--why, yes, of course! Still he is the greatest  poet of passion the world has ever seen--don't cavil--passion's  consistency consists in being inconsistent.    \"Every sentence must have a man behind it,\" and so we might say, \"Every  bar of music must have a man behind it.\" That harmony only can live  which once had its dwelling-place in a great and tender heart.    The province of art is to impart a sublime emotion, and that which  affects to be an emotion, no matter how subtly launched, can never live  as classic art. Honesty here, as elsewhere, must have its reward. Be  yourself, though all the world laugh.    I will not say that Wagner was--he is. The man himself in life was often  worn to the quick by the deprivations he had to endure, or the stupid  misunderstandings he encountered, so at times he was impatient,  erratic, possibly perverse. But all that is gone--his mistakes have  been washed in the blood of Time--only the good survives. The best that  this great and godlike man ever thought, or felt, or knew, is ours--he  lives immortal in his Art.          [Illustration: PAGANINI]    PAGANINI               For lo! creation's self is one great choir,       And what is Nature's order but the rhyme       Whereto the worlds keep time,       And all things move with all things from their prime?       Who shall expound the mystery of the lyre?       In far retreats of elemental mind       Obscurely comes and goes       The imperative breath of song, that as the wind       Is trackless, and oblivious whence it blows.         --_William Watson_      PAGANINI    Some time ago, after my lecture one night in Boston, I bethought me to  call on my old friend Bliss Carman. I expected he would be sleeping the  sleep of the just, but I was prepared to rout him out, for although my  errand was from a fair, frail young thing, and trivial, yet I was bound  to deliver the message--for that is what one should always do.    But the poet was not abed--he was pacing the room in a fine burst of  poetic fervor, composing \"More Songs From Vagabondia.\" The songs told of  purling streams, hedgerows, bathers lolling on the river-bank, nodding  wild flowers, chirping pewees, and other such poetic properties, which  the singer conjured forth from boyhood's days, long since gone by.
