She must reach the substantial  shelter of buildings, the comforting presence of men and women.    She ran, and as she ran she wept aloud like a child and called for her  father. The deep rumble grew louder, nearer. The revealed brilliance  became swift sword-thrusts of blinding light that seemed to stab deep  the earth. Lorraine ran awkwardly, her hands over her ears, crying out  at each lightning flash, her voice drowned in the thunder that followed  it close. Then, as she neared the somber group of buildings, the clouds  above them split with a terrific, rending crash, and the whole place  stood pitilessly revealed to her, as if a spotlight had been turned on.  Lorraine stood aghast. The buildings were not buildings at all. They  were rocks, great, black, forbidding boulders standing there on a narrow  ridge, having a diabolic likeness to houses.    The human mind is wonderfully resilient, but readjustment comes slowly  after a shock. Dumbly, refusing to admit the significance of what she  had seen, Lorraine went forward. Not until she had reached and had  touched the first grotesque caricature of habitation did she wholly  grasp the fact that she was lost, and that shelter might be miles away.  She stood and looked at the orderly group of boulders as the lightning  intermittently revealed them. She saw where the road ran on, between  two square-faced rocks. She would have to follow the road, for after all  it must lead _somewhere_,--to her father's ranch, probably. She wondered  irrelevantly why her mother had never mentioned these queer rocks, and  she wondered vaguely if any of them had caves or ledges where she could  be safe from the lightning.    She was on the point of stepping out into the road again when a horseman  rode into sight between the two rocks. In the same instant of his  appearance she heard the unmistakable crack of a gun, saw the rider jerk  backward in the saddle, throw up one hand,--and then the darkness  dropped between them.    Lorraine crouched behind a juniper bush close against the rock and  waited. The next flash, came within a half-minute. It showed a man at  the horse's head, holding it by the bridle. The horse was rearing.  Lorraine tried to scream that the man on the ground would be trampled,  but something went wrong with her voice, so that she could only whisper.    When the light came again the man who had been shot was not altogether  on the ground. The other, working swiftly, had thrust the injured man's  foot through the stirrup. Lorraine saw him stand back and lift his quirt  to slash the horse across the rump. Even through the crash of thunder  Lorraine heard the horse go past her down the hill, galloping furiously.  When she could see again she glimpsed him running, while something  bounced along on the ground beside him.    She saw the other man, with a dry branch in his hand, dragging it across  the road where it ran between the two rocks. Then Lorraine Hunter,  hardened to the sight of crimes committed for picture values only,  realized sickeningly that she had just looked upon a real murder,--the  cold-blooded killing of a man. She felt very sick. Queer little red  sparks squirmed and danced before her eyes. She crumpled down quietly  behind the juniper bush and did not know when the rain came, though it  drenched her in the first two or three minutes of downpour.          CHAPTER FOUR    \"SHE'S A GOOD GIRL WHEN SHE AIN'T CRAZY\"      When the sun has been up just long enough to take the before-dawn chill  from the air without having swallowed all the diamonds that spangle bush  and twig and grass-blade after a night's soaking rain, it is good to  ride over the hills of Idaho and feel oneself a king,--and never mind  the crown and the scepter. Lone Morgan, riding early to the Sawtooth to  see the foreman about getting a man for a few days to help replace a  bridge carried fifty yards downstream by a local cloudburst, would not  have changed places with a millionaire. The horse he rode was the horse  he loved, the horse he talked to like a pal when they were by  themselves. The ridge gave him a wide outlook to the four corners of the  earth. Far to the north the Sawtooth range showed blue, the nearer  mountains pansy purple where the pine trees stood, the foothills shaded  delicately where canyons swept down to the gray plain. To the south was  the sagebrush, a soft, gray-green carpet under the sun. The sky was  blue, the clouds were handfuls of clean cotton floating lazily. Of the  night's storm remained no trace save slippery mud when his horse struck  a patch of clay, which was not often, and the packed sand still wet and  soggy from the beating rain.    Rock City showed black and inhospitable even in the sunlight. The rock  walls rose sheer, the roofs slanted rakishly, the signs scratched on the  rock by facetious riders were pointless and inane. Lone picked his way  through the crooked defile that was marked MAIN STREET on the corner of  the first huge boulder and came abruptly into the road. Here he turned  north and shook his horse into a trot.    A hundred yards or so down the slope beyond Rock City he pulled up short  with a \"What the hell!\" that did not sound profane, but merely amazed.  In the sodden road were the unmistakable footprints of a woman. Lone did  not hesitate in naming the sex, for the wet sand held the imprint  cleanly, daintily. Too shapely for a boy, too small for any one but a  child or a woman with little feet, and with the point at the toes  proclaiming the fashion of the towns, Lone guessed at once that she was  a town girl, a stranger, probably,--and that she had passed since the  rain; which meant since daylight.    He swung his horse and rode back, wondering where she could have spent  the night. Halfway through Rock City the footprints ended abruptly, and  Lone turned back, riding down the trail at a lope. She couldn't have  gone far, he reasoned, and if she had been out all night in the rain,  with no better shelter than Rock City afforded, she would need  help,--\"and lots of it, and pretty darn quick,\" he added to John Doe,  which was the ambiguous name of his horse.    Half a mile farther on he overtook her. Rather, he sighted her in the  trail, saw her duck in amongst the rocks and scattered brush of a small  ravine, and spurred after her. It was precarious footing for his horse  when he left the road, but John Doe was accustomed to that. He jumped  boulders, shied around buckthorn, crashed through sagebrush and so  brought the girl to bay against a wet bank, where she stood shivering.  The terror in her face and her wide eyes would have made her famous in  the movies. It made Lone afraid she was crazy.    Lone swung off and went up to her guardedly, not knowing just what an  insane woman might do when cornered. \"There, now, I'm not going to hurt  yuh at all,\" he soothed. \"I guess maybe you're lost. What made you run  away from me when you saw me coming?\"    Lorraine continued to stare at him.    \"I'm going to the ranch, and if you'd like a ride, I'll lend you my  horse. He'll be gentle if I lead him. It's a right smart walk from  here.\" Lone smiled, meaning to reassure her.    \"Are you the man I saw shoot that man and then fasten him to the stirrup  of the saddle so the horse dragged him down the road? If you are,  I--I----\"    \"No--oh, no, I'm not the man,\" Lone said gently. \"I just now came from  home. Better let me take you in to the ranch.\"    \"I was going to the ranch--did you see him shoot that man and make the  horse drag him--_make_ the horse--he _slashed_ that horse with the  quirt--and he went tearing down the road dragging--it--it  was--_horrible_!\"    \"Yes--yes, don't worry about it. We'll fix him. You come and get on John  Doe and let me take you to the ranch. Come on--you're wet as a ducked  pup.\"    \"That man was just riding along--I saw him when it lightened. And he  shot him--oh, can't you _do_ something?\"    \"Yes, yes, they're after him right now. Here. Just put your foot in the  stirrup--I'll help you up. Why, you're soaked!\" Perseveringly Lone urged  her to the horse. \"You're soaking wet!\" he exclaimed again.    \"It rained,\" she muttered confusedly. \"I thought it was the ranch--but  they were rocks. Just rocks. Did you _see_ him shoot that man? Why--why  it shouldn't be allowed! He ought to be arrested right away--I'd have  called a policeman but--isn't thunder and lightning just perfectly  _awful_? And that horse--going down the road dragging----    \"You'd better get some one to double for me in this scene,\" she said  irrelevantly. \"I--I don't know this horse, and if he starts running the  boys might not catch him in time. It isn't safe, is it?\"    \"It's safe,\" said Lone pityingly. \"You won't be dragged. You just get on  and ride. I'll lead him. John Doe's gentle as a dog.\"    \"Just straight riding?\" Lorraine considered the matter gravely.  \"Wel-ll--but I saw a man dragged, once. He'd been shot first. It--it  was awful!\"    \"I'll bet it was. How'd you come to be walking so far?\"    Lorraine looked at him suspiciously. Lone thought her eyes were the most  wonderful eyes--and the most terrible--that he had ever seen.  Almond-shaped they were, the irises a clear, dark gray, the eyeballs  blue-white like a healthy baby's. That was the wonder of them. But their  glassy shine made them terrible. Her lids lifted in a sudden stare.    \"You're not the man, are you? I--I think he was taller than you. And his  hat was brown. He's a brute--a _beast_! To shoot a man just riding  along---- It rained,\" she added plaintively. \"My bag is back there  somewhere under a bush. I think I could find the bush--it was where a  rabbit was sitting--but he's probably gone by this time. A rabbit,\" she  told him impressively, \"wouldn't sit out in the rain all night, would  he? He'd get wet.

Kweichou-fu, 146 miles from Ichang, is one of the largest cities on the  Upper Yangtse. Just before it is the Feng-hsiang Gorge the \"Windbox  Gorge\" where the mountains have been again cleft in twain to let pass  the river; this is the last of the great gorges of the Yangtse.    We had left the province of Hupeh. Kweichou is the first prefectural  city that the traveller meets in Szechuen; for that reason my laoban  required me to give him my passport that he might take it ashore and  have it viseed by the magistrate. While he was away two Customs  officials searched my boat for contraband goods. When he returned, he  had to pay a squeeze at the Customs station. We clawed with our hooked  bamboos round the sterns of a hundred Szechuen junks, and were again  arrested at a likin boat, and more cash passed from my laoban to the  officials in charge. We went on again, when a third time we came face on  to a likin-barrier, and a third time my laoban was squeezed. After this  we were permitted to continue our journey. For the rest of the day  whenever the laoban caught my eye he raised three fingers and with a  rueful shake of the head said \"Kweichou haikwan (customs) no good\"; and  then he swore, no doubt.    My little boat was the smallest on the river. In sailing it could hold  its own with all but the long ferry boats or tenders which accompany the  larger junks to land the trackers and towline. These boats carry a huge  square sail set vertically from sheer legs, and are very fast. But in  rowing, poling, and tracking we could beat the river.    Anping was passed--a beautiful country town in a landscape of red hills  and rich green pastures, of groves of bamboo and cypress, of pretty  little farmhouses with overhanging eaves and picturesque temples in  wooded glens.    At Chipatzu there are the remains of a remarkable embankment built of  huge blocks of dressed stone resting upon a noble brow of natural rock;  deep Chinese characters are cut into the stone; but the glory is  departed and there are now only a few straggling huts where there was  once a large city.    The river was now at its lowest and at every point of sand and shingle,  meagre bands of gold puddlers were at work washing for gold in cradle  rockers. To judge, however, from the shabbiness of their surroundings  there was little fear that their gains would disturb the equilibrium of  the world's gold yield.          CHAPTER III.    THE CITY OF WANHSIEN, AND THE JOURNEY FROM WANHSIEN TO CHUNGKING.      At daylight, on March 1st, we were abreast of the many storied pagoda,  whose lofty position, commanding the approach to the city, brings good  fortune to the city of Wanhsien. A beautiful country is this--the  chocolate soil richly tilled, the sides of the hills dotted with  farmhouses in groves of bamboo and cedar, with every variety of green in  the fields, shot through with blazing patches of the yellow rape-seed.  The current was swift, the water was shallow where we were tracking, and  we were constantly aground in the shingle; but we rounded the point, and  Wanhsien was before us. This is the half-way city between Ichang and  Chungking. My smart laoban dressed himself in his best to be ready to go  ashore with me; he was jubilant at his skill in bringing me so quickly.  \"Sampan number one! goddam!\" he said; and, holding up two hands, he  turned down seven fingers to show that we had come in seven days. Then  he pointed to other boats that we were passing, and counted on his  fingers fifteen, whereby I knew he was demonstrating that, had I gone in  any other boat but his, I should have been fifteen days on the way  instead of seven.    An immense number of junks of all kinds were moored to the bank, bow on.  Many of them were large vessels, with hulls like that of an Aberdeen  clipper. Many carry foreign flags, by which they are exempt from the  Chinese likin duties, so capricious in their imposition, and pay instead  a general five per cent. _ad valorem_ duty on their cargoes, which is  levied by the Imperial Maritime Customs, and collected either in  Chungking or Ichang. From one to the other, with boathooks and paddle,  we crept past the outer wings of their balanced rudders till we reached  the landing place. On the rocks at the landing a bevy of women were  washing, beating their hardy garments with wooden flappers against the  stones; but they ceased their work as the foreign devil, in his uncouth  garb, stepped ashore in their midst. Wanhsien is not friendly to  foreigners in foreign garb. I did not know this, and went ashore dressed  as a European. Never have I received such a spontaneous welcome as I did  in this city; never do I wish to receive such another. I landed at the  mouth of the small creek which separates the large walled city to the  east from the still larger city beyond the walls to the west. My laoban  was with me. We passed through the washerwomen. Boys and ragamuffins  hanging about the shipping saw me, and ran towards me, yelling: \"_Yang  kweitze, Yang kweitze_\" (foreign devil, foreign devil).    Behind the booths a story-teller had gathered a crowd; in a moment he  was alone and the crowd were following me up the hill, yelling and  howling with a familiarity most offensive to a sensitive stranger. My  sturdy boy wished me to produce my passport which is the size of an  admiral's ensign, but I was not such a fool as to do so for it had to  serve me for many months yet. With this taunting noisy crowd I had to  walk on as if I enjoyed the demonstration. I stopped once and spoke to  the crowd, and, as I knew no Chinese, I told them in gentle English of  the very low opinion their conduct led me to form of the moral  relations of their mothers, and the resignation with which it induced me  to contemplate the hyperpyretic surroundings of their posthumous  existence; and, borrowing the Chinese imprecation, I ventured to express  the hope that when their souls return again to earth they may dwell in  the bodies of hogs, since they appeared to me the only habitations meet  for them.    But my words were useless. With a smiling face, but rage at my heart, I  led the procession up the creek to a stone bridge where large numbers  left me, only to have their places taken on the other bank by a still  more enthusiastic gathering. I stopped here a moment in the jostling  crowd to look up-stream at that singular natural bridge, which an  enormous mass of stone has formed across the creek, and I could see the  high arched bridge beyond it, which stretches from bank to bank in one  noble span, and is so high above the water that junks can pass under it  in the summer time when the rains swell this little stream into a broad  and navigable river.    Then we climbed the steep bank into the city and entering by a dirty  narrow street we emerged into the main thoroughfare, the crowd still  following and the shops emptying into the street to see me. We passed  the Mohammedan Mosque, the Roman Catholic Mission, the City Temple, to a  Chinese house where I was slipped into the court and the door shut, and  then into another to find that I was in the home of the China Inland  Mission, and that the pigtailed celestial receiving me at the steps was  Mr. Hope Gill. It was my clothes I then learnt that had caused the  manifestation in my honour. An hour later, when I came out again into  the street, the crowd was waiting still to see me, but it was  disappointed to see me now dressed like one of themselves. In the  meantime I had resumed my Chinese dress. \"Look,\" the people said, \"at  the foreigner; he had on foreign dress, and now he is dressed in Chinese  even to his queue. Look at his queue, it is false.\" I took off my hat to  scratch my head. \"Look,\" they shouted again, \"at his queue; it is stuck  to the inside of his hat.\" But they ceased to follow me.    There are three Missionaries in Wanhsien of the China Inland Mission,  one of whom is from Sydney. The mission has been opened six years, and  has been fairly successful, or completely unsuccessful, according to the  point of view of the inquirer.    Mr. Hope Gill, the senior member of the mission, is a most earnest good  man, who works on in his discouraging task with an enthusiasm and  devotion beyond all praise. A Premillennialist, he preaches without  ceasing throughout the city; and his preaching is earnest and  indiscriminate. His method has been sarcastically likened by the  Chinese, in the words of one of their best-known aphorisms, to the  unavailing efforts of a \"blind fowl picking at random after worms.\"  Nearly all the Chinese in Wanhsien have heard the doctrine described  with greater or less unintelligibility, and it is at their own risk if  they still refuse to be saved.    During the cholera epidemic this brave man never left his post; he never  refused a call to attend the sick and dying, and, at the risk of his  own, saved many lives. And what is his reward? This work he did, the  Chinese say, not from a disinterested love of his fellows, which was his  undoubted motive, but to accumulate merit for himself in the invisible  world beyond the grave. \"Gratitude,\" says this missionary, and it is the  opinion of many, \"is a condition of heart, or of mind, which seems to be  incapable of existence in the body of a Chinaman.\" Yet other  missionaries tell me that no man can possess a livelier sense of  gratitude than a Chinaman, or manifest it with more sincerity. \"If our  words are compared to the croaking of the frog, we heed it not, but  freely express the feelings of our heart,\" are actual words addressed by  a grateful Chinese patient to the first medical missionary in China. And  the Chinaman himself will tell you, says Smith, \"that it does not follow  that,"]]]
