Possibly the reader has considered the matter  already. Imagine how nervous one may be waiting in the hall and watching  with a keen glance for the approach of the physician who is to announce  that one is a forefather. The amateur forefather of 1620 must have felt  proud yet anxious about the clam-yield also, as each new mouth opened on  the prospect.    Speaking of clams, it is said by some of the forefathers that the Cape  Cod menu did not go beyond codfish croquettes until the beginning of the  seventeenth century, when pie was added by act of legislature.    Clams are not so restless if eaten without the brisket, which is said to  lie hard on the stomach.[2]    Salem and Charlestown were started by Governor Endicott, and Boston was  founded in 1630. To these various towns the Puritans flocked, and even  now one may be seen in ghostly garments on Thanksgiving Eve flitting  here and there turning off the gas in the parlor while the family are at  tea, in order to cut down expenses.    [Illustration]    Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay Colonies were united in 1692.    Roger Williams, a bright young divine, was the first to interfere with  the belief that magistrates had the right to punish Sabbath-breakers,  blasphemers, etc. He also was the first to utter the idea that a man's  own conscience must be his own guide and not that of another.    [Illustration: SABBATH-BREAKER ARRESTER.]    Among the Puritans there were several who had enlarged consciences, and  who desired to take in extra work for others who had no consciences and  were busy in the fields. They were always ready to give sixteen ounces  to the pound, and were honest, but they got very little rest on Sunday,  because they had to watch the Sabbath-breaker all the time.    [Illustration: PURITAN SNORE ARRESTER.]    The method of punishment for some offences is given here.    [Illustration: METHODS OF PUNISHMENT.]    Does the man look cheerful? No. No one looks cheerful. Even the little  boys look sad. It is said that the Puritans knocked what fun there was  out of the Indian. Did any one ever see an Indian smile since the  landing of the Pilgrims?    [Illustration: Cold!]    [Illustration: Hunger!!]    Roger Williams was too liberal to be kindly received by the clergy, and  so he was driven out of the settlement. Finding that the Indians were  less rigid and kept open on Sundays, he took refuge among them (1636),  and before spring had gained eighteen pounds and converted Canonicus,  one of the hardest cases in New England and the first man to sit up till  after ten o'clock at night. Canonicus gave Roger the tract of land on  which Providence now stands.    [Illustration: Injuns!!!]    Mrs. Anne Hutchinson gave the Pilgrims trouble also. Having claimed  some special revelations and attempted to make a few remarks regarding  them, she was banished.    Banishment, which meant a homeless life in a wild land, with no one but  the Indians to associate with, in those days, was especially annoying to  a good Christian woman, and yet it had its good points. It offered a  little religious freedom, which could not be had among those who wanted  it so much that they braved the billow and the wild beast, the savage,  the drouth, the flood, and the potato-bug, to obtain it before anybody  else got a chance at it. Freedom is a good thing.    [Illustration]    Twenty years later the Quakers shocked every one by thinking a few  religious thoughts on their own hooks. The colonists executed four of  them, and before that tortured them at a great rate.    During dull times and on rainy days it was a question among the  Puritans whether they would banish an old lady, bore holes with a  red-hot iron through a Quaker's tongue, or pitch horse-shoes.    In 1643 the \"United Colonies of New England\" was the name of a league  formed by the people for protection against the Indians.    King Philip's war followed.    Massasoit was during his lifetime a friend to the poor whites of  Plymouth, as Powhatan had been of those at Jamestown, but these two  great chiefs were succeeded by a low set of Indians, who showed as  little refinement as one could well imagine.    Some of the sufferings of the Pilgrims at the time are depicted on the  preceding pages by the artist, also a few they escaped.    Looking over the lives of our forefathers who came from England, I am  not surprised that, with all the English people who have recently come  to this country, I have never seen a forefather.      [Footnote 2: See Dr. Dunn's Family Physician and Horse Doctor.]          CHAPTER V.    DRAWBACKS OF BEING A COLONIST.      It was at this period in the history of our country that the colonists  found themselves not only banished from all civilization, but compelled  to fight an armed foe whose trade was war and whose music was the dying  wail of a tortured enemy. Unhampered by the exhausting efforts of  industry, the Indian, trained by centuries of war upon adjoining tribes,  felt himself foot-loose and free to shoot the unprotected forefather  from behind the very stump fence his victim had worked so hard to erect.    King Philip, a demonetized sovereign, organized his red troops, and,  carrying no haversacks, knapsacks, or artillery, fell upon the colonists  and killed them, only to reappear at some remote point while the dead  and wounded who fell at the first point were being buried or cared for  by rude physicians.    What an era in the history of a country! Gentlewomen whose homes had  been in the peaceful hamlets of England lived and died in the face of a  cruel foe, yet prepared the cloth and clothing for their families, fed  them, and taught them to look to God in all times of trouble, to be  prayerful in their daily lives, yet vigilant and ready to deal death to  the general enemy. They were the mothers whose sons and grandsons laid  the huge foundations of a great nation and cemented them with their  blood.    [Illustration: PRAYERFUL YET VIGILANT.]    At this time there was a line of battle three hundred miles in length.  On one side the white man went armed to the field or the prayer-meeting,  shooting an Indian on sight as he would a panther; on the other, a foe  whose wife did the chores and hoed the scattering crops while he made  war and extermination his joy by night and his prayer and life-long  purpose by day.    Finally, however, the victory came sluggishly to the brave and  deserving. One thousand Indians were killed at one pop, and their  wigwams were burned. All their furniture and curios were burned in their  wigwams, and some of their valuable dogs were holocausted. King Philip  was shot by a follower as he was looking under the throne for  something, and peace was for the time declared.    [Illustration: AN OVATION IN THE WAY OF EGGS AND CODFISH.]    About 1684 the Colony of Massachusetts, which had dared to open up a  trade with the West Indies, using its own vessels for that purpose, was  hauled over the coals by the mother-country for violation of the  Navigation Act, and an officer sent over to enforce the latter. The  colonists defied him, and when he was speaking to them publicly in a  tone of reprimand, he got an ovation in the way of eggs and codfish,  both of which had been set aside for that purpose when the country was  new, and therefore had an air of antiquity which cannot be successfully  imitated.    As a result, the Colony was made a royal appendage, and Sir Edmund  Andros, a political hack under James II., was made Governor of New  England. He reigned under great difficulties for three years, and then  suddenly found himself in jail. The jail was so arranged that he could  not get out, and so the Puritans now quietly resumed their old form of  government.    This continued also for three years, when Sir William Phipps became  Governor under the crown, with one hundred and twenty pounds per annum  and house-rent.    From this on to the Revolution, Massachusetts, Maine, and Nova Scotia  became a royal province. Nova Scotia is that way yet, and has to go to  Boston for her groceries.    [Illustration: OPENING OF THE WITCH-HUNTING SEASON.]    The year 1692 is noted mostly for the Salem excitement regarding  witchcraft. The children of Rev. Mr. Parris were attacked with some  peculiar disease which would not yield to the soothing blisters and  bleedings administered by the physicians of the old school, and so, not  knowing exactly what to do about it, the doctors concluded that they  were bewitched. Then it was, of course, the duty of the courts and  selectmen to hunt up the witches. This was naturally difficult.    Fifty-five persons were tortured and twenty were hanged for being  witches; which proves that the people of Salem were fully abreast of the  Indians in intelligence, and that their gospel privileges had not given  their charity and Christian love such a boom as they should have done.    One can hardly be found now, even in Salem, who believes in witchcraft;  though the Cape Cod people, it is said, still spit on their bait. The  belief in witchcraft in those days was not confined by any means to the  colonists. Sir Matthew Hale of England, one of the most enlightened  judges of the mother-country, condemned a number of people for the  offence, and is now engaged in doing road-work on the streets of the New  Jerusalem as a punishment for these acts done while on the woolsack.    Blackstone himself, one of the dullest authors ever read by the writer  of these lines, yet a skilled jurist, with a marvellous memory regarding  Justinian, said that, to deny witchcraft was to deny revelation.    \"Be you a witch?\" asked one of the judges of Massachusetts, according to  the records now on file in the State-House at Boston.    \"No, your honor,\" was the reply.    \"Officer,\" said the court, taking a pinch of snuff, \"take her out on  the tennis-grounds and pull out her toe-nails"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2145"],[0,"Ben-Hur: A tale of the Christ (#5)"],[1,"God; simplicity is  perfection. The curse of curses is that men will not let truths  like these alone.\"    He stopped, as if considering in what manner to continue.    \"Many nations have loved the sweet waters of the Nile,\" he said  next; \"the Ethiopian, the Pali-Putra, the Hebrew, the Assyrian,  the Persian, the Macedonian, the Roman--of whom all, except the  Hebrew, have at one time or another been its masters. So much  coming and going of peoples corrupted the old Mizraimic faith.  The Valley of Palms became a Valley of Gods. The Supreme One was  divided into eight, each personating a creative principle in nature,  with Ammon-Re at the head. Then Isis and Osiris, and their circle,  representing water, fire, air, and other forces, were invented.  Still the multiplication went on until we had another order,  suggested by human qualities, such as strength, knowledge, love,  and the like.\"    \"In all which there was the old folly!\" cried the Greek,  impulsively. \"Only the things out of reach remain as they  came to us.\"    The Egyptian bowed, and proceeded:    \"Yet a little further, O my brethren, a little further, before I  come to myself. What we go to will seem all the holier of comparison  with what is and has been. The records show that Mizraim found the  Nile in possession of the Ethiopians, who were spread thence through  the African desert; a people of rich, fantastic genius, wholly given  to the worship of nature. The Poetic Persian sacrificed to the sun,  as the completest image of Ormuzd, his God; the devout children of  the far East carved their deities out of wood and ivory; but the  Ethiopian, without writing, without books, without mechanical  faculty of any kind, quieted his soul by the worship of animals,  birds, and insects, holding the cat sacred to Re, the bull to  Isis, the beetle to Pthah. A long struggle against their rude  faith ended in its adoption as the religion of the new empire.  Then rose the mighty monuments that cumber the river-bank and the  desert--obelisk, labyrinth, pyramid, and tomb of king, blent with  tomb of crocodile. Into such deep debasement, O brethren, the sons  of the Aryan fell!\"    Here, for the first time, the calmness of the Egyptian forsook  him: though his countenance remained impassive, his voice gave  way.    \"Do not too much despise my countrymen,\" he began again. \"They did  not all forget God. I said awhile ago, you may remember, that to  papyri we intrusted all the secrets of our religion except one;  of that I will now tell you. We had as king once a certain  Pharaoh, who lent himself to all manner of changes and additions.  To establish the new system, he strove to drive the old entirely  out of mind. The Hebrews then dwelt with us as slaves. They clung  to their God; and when the persecution became intolerable, they  were delivered in a manner never to be forgotten. I speak from  the records now. Mosche, himself a Hebrew, came to the palace,  and demanded permission for the slaves, then millions in number,  to leave the country. The demand was in the name of the Lord God  of Israel. Pharaoh refused. Hear what followed. First, all the  water, that in the lakes and rivers, like that in the wells and  vessels, turned to blood. Yet the monarch refused. Then frogs came  up and covered all the land. Still he was firm. Then Mosche threw  ashes in the air, and a plague attacked the Egyptians. Next, all the  cattle, except of the Hebrews, were struck dead. Locusts devoured  the green things of the valley. At noon the day was turned into a  darkness so thick that lamps would not burn. Finally, in the night  all the first-born of the Egyptians died; not even Pharaoh's escaped.  Then he yielded. But when the Hebrews were gone he followed them  with his army. At the last moment the sea was divided, so that the  fugitives passed it dry-shod. When the pursuers drove in after them,  the waves rushed back and drowned horse, foot, charioteers, and king.  You spoke of revelation, my Gaspar--\"    The blue eyes of the Greek sparkled.    \"I had the story from the Jew,\" he cried. \"You confirm it,  O Balthasar!\"    \"Yes, but through me Egypt speaks, not Mosche. I interpret the  marbles. The priests of that time wrote in their way what they  witnessed, and the revelation has lived. So I come to the one  unrecorded secret. In my country, brethren, we have, from the  day of the unfortunate Pharaoh, always had two religions--one  private, the other public; one of many gods, practised by the  people; the other of one God, cherished only by the priesthood.  Rejoice with me, O brothers! All the trampling by the many nations,  all the harrowing by kings, all the inventions of enemies, all the  changes of time, have been in vain. Like a seed under the mountains  waiting its hour, the glorious Truth has lived; and this--this is  its day!\"    The wasted frame of the Hindoo trembled with delight, and the  Greek cried aloud,    \"It seems to me the very desert is singing.\"    From a gurglet of water near-by the Egyptian took a draught,  and proceeded:    \"I was born at Alexandria, a prince and a priest, and had the  education usual to my class. But very early I became discontented.  Part of the faith imposed was that after death upon the destruction  of the body, the soul at once began its former progression from  the lowest up to humanity, the highest and last existence; and that  without reference to conduct in the mortal life. When I heard of the  Persian's Realm of Light, his Paradise across the bridge Chinevat,  where only the good go, the thought haunted me; insomuch that in  the day, as in the night, I brooded over the comparative ideas  Eternal Transmigration and Eternal Life in Heaven. If, as my  teacher taught, God was just, why was there no distinction  between the good and the bad? At length it became clear to  me, a certainty, a corollary of the law to which I reduced  pure religion, that death was only the point of separation at  which the wicked are left or lost, and the faithful rise to a  higher life; not the nirvana of Buddha, or the negative rest of  Brahma, O Melchior; nor the better condition in hell, which is all  of Heaven allowed by the Olympic faith, O Gaspar; but life--life  active, joyous, everlasting--LIFE WITH GOD! The discovery led to  another inquiry. Why should the Truth be longer kept a secret for  the selfish solace of the priesthood? The reason for the suppression  was gone. Philosophy had at least brought us toleration. In Egypt we  had Rome instead of Rameses. One day, in the Brucheium, the most  splendid and crowded quarter of Alexandria, I arose and preached.  The East and West contributed to my audience. Students going to  the Library, priests from the Serapeion, idlers from the Museum,  patrons of the race-course, countrymen from the Rhacotis--a  multitude--stopped to hear me. I preached God, the Soul, Right and  Wrong, and Heaven, the reward of a virtuous life. You, O Melchior,  were stoned; my auditors first wondered, then laughed. I tried  again; they pelted me with epigrams, covered my God with ridicule,  and darkened my Heaven with mockery. Not to linger needlessly,  I fell before them.\"    The Hindoo here drew a long sigh, as he said, \"The enemy of man  is man, my brother.\"    Balthasar lapsed into silence.    \"I gave much thought to finding the cause of my failure, and at  last succeeded,\" he said, upon beginning again. \"Up the river,  a day's journey from the city, there is a village of herdsmen and  gardeners. I took a boat and went there. In the evening I called  the people together, men and women, the poorest of the poor.  I preached to them exactly as I had preached in the Brucheium.  They did not laugh. Next evening I spoke again, and they believed  and rejoiced, and carried the news abroad. At the third meeting  a society was formed for prayer. I returned to the city then.  Drifting down the river, under the stars, which never seemed so  bright and so near, I evolved this lesson: To begin a reform,  go not into the places of the great and rich; go rather to those  whose cups of happiness are empty--to the poor and humble. And then  I laid a plan and devoted my life. As a first step, I secured my  vast property, so that the income would be certain, and always at  call for the relief of the suffering. From that day, O brethren,  I travelled up and down the Nile, in the villages, and to all the  tribes, preaching One God, a righteous life, and reward in Heaven.  I have done good--it does not become me to say how much. I also  know that part of the world to be ripe for the reception of Him  we go to find.\"    A flush suffused the swarthy cheek of the speaker; but he overcame  the feeling, and continued:    \"The years so given, O my brothers, were troubled by one thought--When  I was gone, what would become of the cause I had started? Was it to  end with me? I had dreamed many times of organization as a fitting  crown for my work. To hide nothing from you, I had tried to effect  it, and failed. Brethren, the world is now in the condition that,  to restore the old Mizraimic faith, the reformer must have a more  than human sanction; he must not merely come in God's name, he must  have the proofs subject to his word; he must demonstrate all he says,  even God. So preoccupied is the mind with myths and systems; so much  do false deities crowd every place--earth, air, sky; so have they  become of everything a part, that return to the first religion can  only be along bloody paths, through fields of persecution; that is  to say, the converts must be willing to die rather than recant.  And who in this age can carry the faith of men to such a point  but God himself? To redeem the race--I do not mean to destroy  it--to REDEEM the race, he must make himself once more manifest;  HE MUST COME IN PERSON.\"    Intense emotion seized the three.    \"Are we not going to find him?\" exclaimed the Greek.    \"You understand why I failed in the attempt to"]]]
