In this the entire mechanism carrying the wheels on which the  band-saw revolves can be moved up and down, so as to bring the point  where the saw leaves the upper wheel as close to the top of the  different sized logs as possible.    [Illustration: Fig. 35. Double-Carrying Telescopic Band-Mill. Mill in  raised position for large log.]    [Illustration: Fig. 36. Jack-Ladder, with Endless Chain.]    The usual modern mill is a two story building, Fig. 37, built at a  convenient locality both for receiving the logs and for shipping the  lumber. Whether the logs arrive by water or by rail, they are,  if possible, stored in a mill-pond until used in order to prevent  checking, discoloration, decay, and worm attack. From the pond they  are hauled up out of the water on to a \"jack-ladder,\" by means of an  endless chain, provided with saddles or spurs which engage the logs  and draw them up into the second story on to the log slip, Fig. 36.    [Illustration: Fig. 37. Two-Story Mill at Virginia, Minnesota, Showing  Jack-Ladders and Consumer.]    [Illustration: Fig. 38. Log-Flipper.]    [Illustration: Fig. 39. Log-Stop and Loader. By letting steam into the  cylinder, the projecting arm revolves, rolling one log over onto the  carriage and holding the next one till wanted.]    After the logs have entered the mill, they are inspected for stones  lodged in the bark, and for spikes left by the river men, and then  measured. Under the log-slip is the steam \"flipper\" or \"kicker,\" Fig.  38, by means of which the scaler or his assistant, throwing a lever,  causes the log to be kicked over to one side or the other, on to the  log-deck, an inclined floor sloping toward the saw-carriage. Down this  the log rolls until stopped by a log-stop, or log-loader, Fig. 39,  a double-aimed projection, which prevents it from rolling on the  carriage till wanted. This stop is also worked by steam. By letting  the steam into the cylinder which controls it, one log is rolled over  on the carriage and the next one held. The log on the carriage is at  once \"dogged,\" that is, clamped tight by iron dogs, the carriage is  set for the proper cut, and moves forward to the saw which cuts  off the first slab. The carriage is then \"gigged\" or reversed. This  operation offsets the carriage one-eighth of an inch so that the log  returns entirely clear of the saw. In the same way two or three 1\"  boards are taken off, the dogs are then knocked out, and the log  canted over half a revolution. This is done by means of the \"steam  nigger,\" Fig. 40, a long, perpendicular toothed bar which comes up  thru the floor, engages the log, and turns it over till the sawn side  comes up against the knees of the carriage. The log is dogged again  and a second slab and several boards are taken off. The log or \"stock\"  as it is now called, is 10\", 12\", 14\", or 16\" thick; the \"nigger\" then  gives it a quarter-turn, leaving it lying on a sawn side. It is dogged  again, and all sawn up except enough to make a few boards. This last  piece is given a half-turn, bringing the sawn side against the knees,  and it is sawn up. Each board as it is sawn off is thrown by the  board-flipper or cant-flipper,[2] Fig. 41, on to the \"live rollers,\"  which take it to the next process. Another log comes on the carriage  and the process is repeated.        [Footnote 2: A \"cant\" is a squared or partly squared log.]    [Illustration: Fig. 40. The Steam Nigger. The toothed bar turns the  log over into the desired position.]    [Illustration: Fig. 41. Steam Cant-Flipper. This machine is used to  move cants, timber, or lumber from live rollers to gangs, band resaw  mills, or elsewhere. The timber is discharged upon skid rollers, as  shown, or upon transfer chains.]    [Illustration: Fig. 42. Log-Carriage, holding quartered log in  position to saw.]    The saw-carriage, Fig. 42, is propelled forward and back by a piston  running in a long cylinder, into either end of which steam can be  turned by the operator.    [Illustration: Fig. 43. Double Gang Edger. This machine trims off the  rough edges of the \"waney\" boards by means of the four saws in the  main frame of the machine.]    [Illustration: Fig. 44. Automatic Steam Transfer for Timber, Lumber  and Slabs. The boards are carried along by the cylinders, CCC, until  they hit the bumper, B. This movement admits steam to the cylinder,  CY, which raises the revolving chains or skids, which transfers the  stock sidewise to other live rollers as required.]    As the sawn boards fall off the log, they land on \"live,\" that is,  revolving rollers, which carry them along at the rate of 200 to 250  feet a minute. Stops are provided farther along to stop the boards  wherever wanted, as at the edger, Fig. 43, or the slasher. From the  live rollers the boards are transferred automatically, Fig. 44, by  chains running at right angles to the rollers and brought within reach  of the edger man. About one-third of the boards of a log have rough  edges, and are called \"waney.\" These must go thru the edger to make  their edges parallel. The edger man works with great speed. He sees at  once what can be made out of a board, places it in position and runs  it thru. From the edger the boards are carried to the trimmer, which  cuts the length. The lumberman's rule is to \"cut so that you can cut  again.\" The so-called 16' logs are really 16' 6\". The trimmer, Fig.  45, now trims these boards to 16' 1\", so that if desired they can  still be cut again. The trimmer may be set to cut at any desired  length according to the specifications.    [Illustration: Fig. 45. Automatic Gang Lumber-Trimmer. It may be set  to cut automatically to any desired length.]    [Illustration: Fig. 46. Lumber Sorting Shed. Virginia, Minnesota.]    [Illustration: Fig. 47.]    The boards are now graded as to quality into No. 1, No. 2, etc., Fig.  46, and run out of the mill, to be stacked up in piles, Fig. 47. Big  timbers go directly from the saw on the rolls to the back end of the  mill, where the first end is trimmed by a butting-saw or cut-off-saw  which swings, Fig. 48. The timber is then shoved along on dead rolls  and the last end trimmed by the butting-saw to a definite length as  specified, and shoved out.    One of the most remarkable features of the modern mill is its speed.  From the time the log appears till the last piece of it goes racing  out of the mill, hardly more than a minute may have elapsed.    [Illustration: Fig. 48. Cut-off-Saw. This saw trims the ends of  timbers.]    A large part of the problem of sawmilling is the disposal of the  waste. The first of these is the sawdust. In all first class mills,  this together with shavings (if a planing-mill is combined) is burned  for fuel. It is sucked up from the machines and carried in large tubes  to the boiler-room and there is mechanically supplied to the fires.  The slabs, once considered as waste, contain much material that is now  utilized. From the live rolls, on which all the material falls from  the main band-saw, the slabs are carried off by transfer chains,  and by another set of five rollers to the \"slasher,\" Fig. 50, which  consists of a line of circular-saws placed 4' 1\" apart. This slasher  cuts up the slabs into lengths suitable for lath or fence-pickets.  Fig. 49. Or they can be resawn into 16\" lengths for shingles or  fire-wood.    [Illustration: Fig. 49. Ten Saw Gang Lath Bolter. This machine cuts up  material lengthwise into laths.]    [Illustration: Fig. 50. Slab-Slasher. This machine cuts up the slabs  into lengths suitable for lath or fence-pickets.]    From the \"slasher\" the 4' 1\" lengths are carried on by traveling  platforms, chains, etc., to the lath-machines, Fig. 51, where they are  sawn up, counted as sawn, bound in bundles of 100, trimmed to exactly  4' in length and sent off to be stored. The shingle bolts are  picked off the moving platforms by men or boys, and sent to the  shingle-machine, Fig. 52, where they are sawn into shingles and  dropped down-stairs to be packed. Shingle-bolts are also made from  crooked or otherwise imperfect logs.    Of what is left, a good part goes into the grinder or \"hog,\" Fig. 53,  which chews up all sorts of refuse into small chips suitable for fuel  to supplement the sawdust if necessary. Band-saws make so little dust  and such fine dust that this is often necessary.    [Illustration: Fig. 51. Combination Lath-Binder and Trimmer. With this  machine the operator can trim the bundles of lath simply by tilting  the packing frame over from him causing the bundles to pass between  the saws, thereby trimming both ends at one movement.]    [Illustration: Fig. 52. Hand Shingle-Machine. This machine is used in  Sawmills in which it is desired to utilize slabs and trimmings by  sawing shingles therefrom, or to saw shingles from prepared bolts.]    If there is any refuse that cannot be used at all it goes to the  scrap-pile, Fig. 54, or to the \"consumer,\" the tall stack shown in  Fig. 37, see p. 33.    Boards ordinarily sawn from logs are \"slash-sawn,\" i. e., they are  tangential or bastard, each cut parallel to the previous one. By this  process, only the central boards would be radial or \"rift\" boards.    [Illustration: Fig. 53. Edging grinder or Hog. It cuts any kind  of wood into coarse or fine chips suitable to be handled by chain  conveyor or blower.]    [Illustration: Fig. 54. Scrap-Pile. Oscilla. Georgia.]    But, for a number of reasons, radial boards are better. They warp  less because the annual rings cross the board more evenly. Yellow pine  flooring that is rift-sawn is more valuable than slash-sawn, because  the edge of the annual rings makes a more even grain, Fig. 55. Where  slash-grained flooring is used, the boards should be laid so that the  outside of each board will be up in order that the inner rings may not  \"shell out.\"    [Illustration: Fig. 55.

(#5)"],[1,"you will carry it  on, as you may carry it on here at Cambridge better than anywhere  else, will open before you large layers of literature, as yet almost  unknown and unexplored, and allow you an insight into strata of  thought deeper than any you have known before, and rich in lessons  that appeal to the deepest sympathies of the human heart.    Depend upon it, if only you can make leisure, you will find plenty of  work in India for your leisure hours.    India is not, as you may imagine, a distant, strange, or, at the very  utmost, a curious country. India for the future belongs to Europe, it  has its place in the Indo-European world, it has its place in our own  history, and in what is the very life of history, the history of the  human mind.    You know how some of the best talent and the noblest genius of our age  has been devoted to the study of the development of the outward or  material world, the growth of the earth, the first appearance of  living cells, their combination and differentiation, leading up to the  beginning of organic life, and its steady progress from the lowest to  the highest stages. Is there not an inward and intellectual world also  which has to be studied in its historical development, from the first  appearance of predicative and demonstrative roots, their combination  and differentiation, leading up to the beginning of rational thought  in its steady progress from the lowest to the highest stages? And in  that study of the history of the human mind, in that study of  ourselves, of our true selves, India occupies a place second to no  other country. Whatever sphere of the human mind you may select for  your special study, whether it be language, or religion, or mythology,  or philosophy, whether it be laws or customs, primitive art or  primitive science, everywhere, you have to go to India, whether you  like it or not, because some of the most valuable and most instructive  materials in the history of man are treasured up in India, and in  India only.    And while thus trying to explain to those whose lot will soon be cast  in India the true position which that wonderful country holds or ought  to hold in universal history, I may perhaps be able at the same time  to appeal to the sympathies of other members of this University, by  showing them how imperfect our knowledge of universal history, our  insight into the development of the human intellect, must always  remain, if we narrow our horizon to the history of Greeks and Romans,  Saxons and Celts, with a dim background of Palestine, Egypt, and  Babylon,[12] and leave out of sight our nearest intellectual  relatives, the Aryans of India, the framers of the most wonderful  language, the Sanskrit, the fellow-workers in the construction of our  fundamental concepts, the fathers of the most natural of natural  religions, the makers of the most transparent of mythologies, the  inventors of the most subtle philosophy, and the givers of the most  elaborate laws.    There are many things which we think essential in a liberal education,  whole chapters of history which we teach in our schools and  universities, that cannot for one moment compare with the chapter  relating to India, if only properly understood and freely interpreted.    In our time, when the study of history threatens to become almost an  impossibility--such is the mass of details which historians collect in  archives and pour out before us in monographs--it seems to me more  than ever the duty of the true historian to find out the real  proportion of things, to arrange his materials according to the  strictest rules of artistic perspective, and to keep completely out of  sight all that may be rightly ignored by us in our own passage across  the historical stage of the world. It is this power of discovering  what is really important that distinguishes the true historian from  the mere chronicler, in whose eyes everything is important,  particularly if he has discovered it himself. I think it was Frederick  the Great who, when sighing for a true historian of his reign,  complained bitterly that those who wrote the history of Prussia never  forgot to describe the buttons on his uniform. And it is probably of  such historical works that Carlyle was thinking when he said that he  had waded through them all, but that nothing should ever induce him to  hand even their names and titles down to posterity. And yet how much  is there even in Carlyle's histories that might safely be consigned to  oblivion!    Why do we want to know history? Why does history form a recognized  part of our liberal education? Simply because all of us, and every one  of us, ought to know how we have come to be what we are, so that each  generation need not start again from the same point and toil over the  same ground, but, profiting by the experience of those who came  before, may advance toward higher points and nobler aims. As a child  when growing up might ask his father or grandfather _who_ had built  the house they lived in, or who had cleared the field that yielded  them their food, we ask the historian whence we came, and how we came  into possession of what we call our own. History may tell us afterward  many useful and amusing things, gossip, such as a child might like to  hear from his mother or grandmother; but what history has to teach us  before all and everything, is our own antecedents, our own ancestors,  our own descent.    Now our principal intellectual ancestors are, no doubt, the _Jews_,  the _Greeks_, the _Romans_, and the _Saxons_, and we, here in Europe,  should not call a man educated or enlightened who was ignorant of the  debt which he owes to his intellectual ancestors in Palestine, Greece,  Rome, and Germany. The whole past history of the world would be  darkness to him, and not knowing what those who came before him had  done for him, he would probably care little to do anything for those  who are to come after him. Life would be to him a chain of sand, while  it ought to be a kind of electric chain that makes our hearts tremble  and vibrate with the most ancient thoughts of the past, as well as  with the most distant hopes of the future.    Let us begin with our religion. No one can understand even the  historical possibility of the Christian religion without knowing  something of the Jewish race, which must be studied chiefly in the  pages of the Old Testament. And in order to appreciate the true  relation of the Jews to the rest of the ancient world, and to  understand what ideas were peculiarly their own, and what ideas they  shared in common with the other members of the Semitic stock, or what  moral and religious impulses they received from their historical  contact with other nations of antiquity, it is absolutely necessary  that we should pay some attention to the history of Babylon, Nineveh,  Phoenicia, and Persia. These may seem distant countries and  forgotten people, and many might feel inclined to say, \"Let the dead  bury their dead; what are those mummies to us?\" Still, such is the  marvellous continuity of history, that I could easily show you many  things which we, even we who are here assembled, owe to Babylon, to  Nineveh, to Egypt, Phoenicia, and Persia.    Every one who carries a watch owes to the Babylonians the division of  the hour into sixty minutes. It may be a very bad division, yet such  as it is, it has come to us from the Greeks and Romans, and it came to  them from Babylon. The sexagesimal division is peculiarly Babylonian.  Hipparchos, 150 B.C., adopted it from Babylon, Ptolemy, 150 A.D., gave  it wider currency, and the French, when they decimated everything  else, respected the dial-plates of our watches, and left them with  their sixty Babylonian minutes.    Every one who writes a letter owes his alphabet to the Romans and  Greeks; the Greeks owed their alphabet to the Phoenicians, and the  Phoenicians learned it in Egypt. It may be a very imperfect  alphabet--as all the students of phonetics will tell you--yet, such as  it is and has been, we owe it to the old Phoenicians and Egyptians,  and in every letter we trace, there lies imbedded the mummy of an  ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic.    What do we owe to the Persians? It does not seem to be much, for they  were not a very inventive race, and what they knew they had chiefly  learned from their neighbors, the Babylonians and Assyrians. Still,  we owe them something. First of all, we owe them a large debt of  gratitude for having allowed themselves to be beaten by the Greeks;  for think what the world would have been if the Persians had beaten  the Greeks at Marathon, and had enslaved--that means, annihilated--the  genius of ancient Greece. However, this may be called rather an  involuntary contribution to the progress of humanity, and I mention it  only in order to show how narrowly, not only Greeks and Romans, but  Saxons and Anglo-Saxons too, escaped becoming Parsis or  Fire-worshippers.    But I can mention at least one voluntary gift which came to us from  Persia, and that is the relation of silver to gold in our bi-metallic  currency. That relation was, no doubt, first determined in Babylonia,  but it assumed its practical and historical importance in the Persian  empire, and spread from there to the Greek colonies in Asia, and  thence to Europe, where it has maintained itself with slight variation  to the present day.    A _talent_[13] was divided into sixty _minae_, a mina into sixty  _shekels_. Here we have again the Babylonian sexagesimal system, a  system which owes its origin and popularity, I believe, to the fact  that _sixty_ has the greatest number of divisors. Shekel was  translated into Greek by _Stater_, and an Athenian gold stater, like  the Persian gold stater, down to the times of Croesus, Darius, and  Alexander, was the sixtieth part of a mina of gold, not very far  therefore from our sovereign. The proportion of silver to gold was  fixed as thirteen or thirteen"]]]
