Poor Philippe was in several ways exceptional.  Opposite the Breton arme--the inn and posting-house at the entrance of  the village of Gavrillac--M. de Vilmorin interrupted his companion just  as he was soaring to the dizziest heights of caustic invective, and  Andre-Louis, restored thereby to actualities, observed the carriage of  M. de La Tour d'Azyr standing before the door of the hostelry.    \"I don't believe you've been listening to me,\" said he.    \"Had you been less interested in what you were saying, you might have  observed it sooner and spared your breath. The fact is, you disappoint  me, Andre. You seem to have forgotten what we went for. I have an  appointment here with M. le Marquis. He desires to hear me further in  the matter. Up there at Gavrillac I could accomplish nothing. The time  was ill-chosen as it happened. But I have hopes of M. le Marquis.\"    \"Hopes of what?\"    \"That he will make what reparation lies in his power. Provide for the  widow and the orphans. Why else should he desire to hear me further?\"    \"Unusual condescension,\" said Andre-Louis, and quoted \"Timeo Danaos et  dona ferentes.\"    \"Why?\" asked Philippe.    \"Let us go and discover--unless you consider that I shall be in the way.\"    Into a room on the right, rendered private to M. le Marquis for so long  as he should elect to honour it, the young men were ushered by the host.  A fire of logs was burning brightly at the room's far end, and by  this sat now M. de La Tour d'Azyr and his cousin, the Chevalier de  Chabrillane. Both rose as M. de Vilmorin came in. Andre-Louis following,  paused to close the door.    \"You oblige me by your prompt courtesy, M. de Vilmorin,\" said the  Marquis, but in a tone so cold as to belie the politeness of his words.  \"A chair, I beg. Ah, Moreau?\" The note was frigidly interrogative. \"He  accompanies you, monsieur?\" he asked.    \"If you please, M. le Marquis.\"    \"Why not? Find yourself a seat, Moreau.\" He spoke over his shoulder as  to a lackey.    \"It is good of you, monsieur,\" said Philippe, \"to have offered me this  opportunity of continuing the subject that took me so fruitlessly, as it  happens, to Gavrillac.\"    The Marquis crossed his legs, and held one of his fine hands to the  blaze. He replied, without troubling to turn to the young man, who was  slightly behind him.    \"The goodness of my request we will leave out of question for the  moment,\" said he, darkly, and M. de Chabrillane laughed. Andre-Louis  thought him easily moved to mirth, and almost envied him the faculty.    \"But I am grateful,\" Philippe insisted, \"that you should condescend to  hear me plead their cause.\"    The Marquis stared at him over his shoulder. \"Whose cause?\" quoth he.    \"Why, the cause of the widow and orphans of this unfortunate Mabey.\"    The Marquis looked from Vilmorin to the Chevalier, and again the  Chevalier laughed, slapping his leg this time.    \"I think,\" said M. de La Tour d'Azyr, slowly, \"that we are at  cross-purposes. I asked you to come here because the Chateau de  Gavrillac was hardly a suitable place in which to carry our discussion  further, and because I hesitated to incommode you by suggesting that you  should come all the way to Azyr. But my object is connected with certain  expressions that you let fall up there. It is on the subject of those  expressions, monsieur, that I would hear you further--if you will honour  me.\"    Andre-Louis began to apprehend that there was something sinister in the  air. He was a man of quick intuitions, quicker far than those of M. de  Vilmorin, who evinced no more than a mild surprise.    \"I am at a loss, monsieur,\" said he. \"To what expressions does monsieur  allude?\"    \"It seems, monsieur, that I must refresh your memory.\" The Marquis  crossed his legs, and swung sideways on his chair, so that at last he  directly faced M. de Vilmorin. \"You spoke, monsieur--and however mistaken  you may have been, you spoke very eloquently, too eloquently almost, it  seemed to me--of the infamy of such a deed as the act of summary justice  upon this thieving fellow Mabey, or whatever his name may be. Infamy was  the precise word you used. You did not retract that word when I had the  honour to inform you that it was by my orders that my gamekeeper Benet  proceeded as he did.\"    \"If,\" said M. de Vilmorin, \"the deed was infamous, its infamy is not  modified by the rank, however exalted, of the person responsible. Rather  is it aggravated.\"    \"Ah!\" said M. le Marquis, and drew a gold snuffbox from his pocket. \"You  say, 'if the deed was infamous,' monsieur. Am I to understand that you  are no longer as convinced as you appeared to be of its infamy?\"    M. de Vilmorin's fine face wore a look of perplexity. He did not  understand the drift of this.    \"It occurs to me, M. le Marquis, in view of your readiness to assume  responsibility, that you must believe justification for the deed which  is not apparent to myself.\"    \"That is better. That is distinctly better.\" The Marquis took snuff  delicately, dusting the fragments from the fine lace at his throat. \"You  realize that with an imperfect understanding of these matters, not being  yourself a landowner, you may have rushed to unjustifiable conclusions.  That is indeed the case. May it be a warning to you, monsieur. When  I tell you that for months past I have been annoyed by similar  depredations, you will perhaps understand that it had become necessary  to employ a deterrent sufficiently strong to put an end to them. Now  that the risk is known, I do not think there will be any more prowling  in my coverts. And there is more in it than that, M. de Vilmorin. It is  not the poaching that annoys me so much as the contempt for my absolute  and inviolable rights. There is, monsieur, as you cannot fail to have  observed, an evil spirit of insubordination in the air, and there is  one only way in which to meet it. To tolerate it, in however slight  a degree, to show leniency, however leniently disposed, would entail  having recourse to still harsher measures to-morrow. You understand me,  I am sure, and you will also, I am sure, appreciate the condescension  of what amounts to an explanation from me where I cannot admit that any  explanations were due. If anything in what I have said is still obscure  to you, I refer you to the game laws, which your lawyer friend there  will expound for you at need.\"    With that the gentleman swung round again to face the fire. It appeared  to convey the intimation that the interview was at an end. And yet this  was not by any means the intimation that it conveyed to the watchful,  puzzled, vaguely uneasy Andre-Louis. It was, thought he, a very curious,  a very suspicious oration. It affected to explain, with a politeness of  terms and a calculated insolence of tone; whilst in fact it could only  serve to stimulate and goad a man of M. de Vilmorin's opinions. And that  is precisely what it did. He rose.    \"Are there in the world no laws but game laws?\" he demanded, angrily.  \"Have you never by any chance heard of the laws of humanity?\"    The Marquis sighed wearily. \"What have I to do with the laws of  humanity?\" he wondered.    M. de Vilmorin looked at him a moment in speechless amazement.    \"Nothing, M. le Marquis. That is--alas!--too obvious. I hope you will  remember it in the hour when you may wish to appeal to those laws which  you now deride.\"    M. de La Tour d'Azyr threw back his head sharply, his high-bred face  imperious.    \"Now what precisely shall that mean? It is not the first time to-day  that you have made use of dark sayings that I could almost believe to  veil the presumption of a threat.\"    \"Not a threat, M. le Marquis--a warning. A warning that such deeds as  these against God's creatures... Oh, you may sneer, monsieur, but they  are God's creatures, even as you or I--neither more nor less, deeply  though the reflection may wound your pride, In His eyes...\"    \"Of your charity, spare me a sermon, M. l'abbe!\"    \"You mock, monsieur. You laugh. Will you laugh, I wonder, when God  presents His reckoning to you for the blood and plunder with which your  hands are full?\"    \"Monsieur!\" The word, sharp as the crack of a whip, was from M.  de Chabrillane, who bounded to his feet. But instantly the Marquis  repressed him.    \"Sit down, Chevalier. You are interrupting M. l'abbe, and I should like  to hear him further. He interests me profoundly.\"    In the background Andre-Louis, too, had risen, brought to his feet by  alarm, by the evil that he saw written on the handsome face of M. de La  Tour d'Azyr. He approached, and touched his friend upon the arm.    \"Better be going, Philippe,\" said he.    But M. de Vilmorin, caught in the relentless grip of passions long  repressed, was being hurried by them recklessly along.    \"Oh, monsieur,\" said he, \"consider what you are and what you will be.  Consider how you and your kind live by abuses, and consider the harvest  that abuses must ultimately bring.\"    \"Revolutionist!\" said M. le Marquis, contemptuously. \"You have the  effrontery to stand before my face and offer me this stinking cant of  your modern so-called intellectuals!\"    \"Is it cant, monsieur? Do you think--do you believe in your soul--that  it is cant? Is it cant that the feudal grip is on all things that live,  crushing them like grapes in the press, to its own profit? Does it not  exercise its rights upon the waters of the river, the fire that bakes  the poor man's bread of grass and barley, on the wind that turns the  mill? The peasant cannot take a step upon the road, cross a crazy bridge  over a river, buy an ell of cloth in the village market, without meeting  feudal rapacity, without being taxed in feudal dues. Is not that enough,  M. le Marquis? Must you also demand his wretched life in payment for the  least infringement of your sacred privileges, careless of what widows  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19487"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Hereford (#5)"],[1,"over the heads of the  ministering priests as they stood at the altar. These were found later on  to be hung on rusty nails by twine \"little better than pack thread.\"               [Illustration: THE WEST FRONT (FROM AN OLD PRINT).]                       THE WEST FRONT (FROM AN OLD PRINT).      During the episcopate of the Hon. Henry Egerton, 1723-1746, an ancient  building of early Norman date used as a chapel for the palace was pulled  down. It consisted of an upper and a lower portion, the lower a chapel  dedicated to St. Katherine and the upper one to St. Mary Magdalene. Part  of one wall still remains. It was during the next episcopate, on Easter  Monday 1786, that a terrible calamity occurred,--the fall of the great  western tower. Directly and indirectly this was the worst accident that  has happened to Hereford Cathedral. The west front was utterly destroyed,  and a great part of the nave seriously injured, while the injudicious  restoration begun in 1788 by the Dean and Chapter, with James Wyatt for  architect, did nearly as much to ruin the cathedral as the fall of the  tower.             [Illustration: THE NAVE AFTER THE FALL OF THE WEST END.]                     THE NAVE AFTER THE FALL OF THE WEST END.    _From a drawing by T. Hearne_, 1806.      Already, at Salisbury, Wyatt had been busy with irreparable deeds of  vandalism, but at Hereford he surpassed his previous efforts in this  direction. He altered the whole proportion of the building, shortening the  nave by a bay of 15 feet, erected a new west front on a \"neat Gothic  pattern,\" and availed himself of the chance of removing all the Norman  work in the nave, above the nave arcade substituting a design of his own.    One of the strangest items in his scheme was a plaster hod moulding round  each of the arches above the arcade. These eccentricities were removed not  long since, but the roughened lines for adhesion of the plaster still  remain. Inside the west front may also still be seen large spaces of wall  painted to represent blocks of stone, but no more so in reality than the  wall of any stucco residence.    It should not be forgotten, while condemning the meaningless insipidity of  Wyatt's work, that it was enthusiastically approved in his own day, and  that the public generally were as much to blame as himself.    The old spire was taken down from the central tower, and in order to give  it apparent height the roofs of both nave and choir were lowered in pitch,  its parapet was raised, and some pinnacles were added.    At the same time the churchyard was levelled and new burying-grounds  provided for the city elsewhere.    In 1837, Dr. Thomas Musgrave was promoted to the See of Hereford. He was a  man of sound judgment and of much practical ability, and it was during his  episcopacy that a serious competent and thorough repair of the cathedral  was at last undertaken at a cost of L27,000, to which no one devoted more  loving care or more untiring energy than Dean Merewether.    \"Is it time for you, O ye, to dwell in your ceiled houses and this house  lie waste?\" he quotes in the beginning of his exhaustive \"Statement of the  condition and circumstances of the Cathedral Church of Hereford in the  year 1841.\" In this statement he shows the lamentable state of decay in  the eastern end of the Lady Chapel, the bulging of its walls and the  dangerous fissures, which, on the removal of whitewash and plaster, became  visible in the soffit of each of the window arches.    In early times the walls were very much thicker, composed of hewn stone,  making a kind of casing at each side, called ashlar, the interval being  filled with rubble masonry cemented with lime and loam. This stuffing  having deteriorated the weight above had split the outer wall, though most  fortunately the interior face was perfectly sound and upright.    To trace the cracks thoroughly, it was necessary to remove the oak  panelling fitted to the wall below the windows, and the heavy bookcases  filling up a great part of the area were taken away with the lath and  plaster partition from the sides of the pillar at the west end of the  chapel.    [Illustration: THE CATHEDRAL FROM THE NORTH AT THE END OF THE SEVENTEENTH                                  CENTURY.]       THE CATHEDRAL FROM THE NORTH AT THE END OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY.      By this clearing the beauty of the chapel so long obscured became again  manifest: its symmetrical proportions, the remains of its ancient  painting, the disclosure of two most interesting monuments, two aumbries,  a double piscina, the chapel of Bishop Audley, but more important than  all, two of the most beautiful specimens of transition arches to be found  anywhere, Early English in form, but ornamented in their soffits with the  Norman moulding and the zigzag decoration, corresponding with the  remarkable union of the Norman intersecting arches on the exterior of the  building, with its pointed characteristics.    The further examination by Dean Merewether and Mr. Cottingham, the  architect, showed that the great central tower of the cathedral was in  imminent danger of falling, and might at any moment entirely collapse.    Above the Grecian altar screen of Bishop Bisse they were struck by the  traces of Norman mouldings, whilst on traversing the clerestory gallery  the remains of Norman ornaments were everywhere to be found, the gallery  itself being still existent at each side, returned behind the wooden  coverings, up to the splays of the eastern windows.    The whole incongruous covering of the east end of the choir shown on p. 77  was then removed, and the change effected was most striking. It was  evident that long before the introduction of the Grecian screen in 1717,  the original arrangement had been disturbed by the insertion of a  Perpendicular window, to support which the low circular arch in the centre  had been constructed; on either side of this window were now to be seen  the mouldings and featherings of the original early decorated lights, on a  level with the lateral clerestory range; below these the Norman arcade,  based upon a string course of nebule ornaments.    \"But below,\" says Dean Merewether, \"the beauty of beauties was to be  traced,--the thickness of that part of the wall is 8 feet; on either side  of the arch, 24 feet in span, were portions of shafts, corresponding with  the pair of Norman shafts exposed to view seven years ago. The bases of  these (standing on a sort of plinth, which was continued through those  already referred to), as well as the capitals, of most curious detail,  were perfect, and upon them were visible as far as the level of the window  above, the remaining stones which formed the architecture of the exterior  arch, from which it was evident that its crown must have risen to the  height of 30 feet. By cautious examination of the parts walled up, it was  discovered that the capitals were all perfect, and that this exquisite and  grand construction, the mutilation and concealment of which it is utterly  impossible to account for, was, in fact, made up of five arches, the  interior and smallest supported by the two semi-columns already described,  and each of the others increasing in span as it approached the front upon  square and circular shafts alternately, the faces of each arch being  beautifully decorated with the choicest Norman ornaments. Of the four  lateral arches, the two first had been not only hidden by the oak  panelling of the screen, but were also, like the two others, closed up  with lath and plaster, as the central arch; and when these incumbrances  and desecrations were taken away, it is impossible to describe adequately  the glorious effect produced, rendered more solemn and impressive by the  appearance of the ancient monuments of Bishops Reynelm, Mayew, Stanbury,  and Benet, whose ashes rest beneath these massive arches, of which,  together with the noble triforium above, before the Conquest, Athelstan  had probably been the founder, and the former of those just mentioned, the  completer and restorer after that era.\"    Under Mr. Cottingham many improvements were made, though it cannot be said  that all the work he did was good either in design or execution. The  beautiful lantern of the central tower, with its fifty-six shafts, was  satisfactorily strengthened and thrown open to view. At the time of Dean  Merewether's death in 1850 much still remained to be done, and in 1857 a  further scheme was set going under the financial management of Dean  Richard Dawes, and the architectural direction of Mr., afterwards Sir  Gilbert, Scott, who restored the north transepts, the north porch, the  choir, and Lady Chapel. He also erected the large metal screen and fitted  up the Lady Chapel as a church for the parish of St. John the Baptist.    Altogether in these two works of repair about L45,000 was expended, and  the cathedral was opened for service on June 30th, 1863.            CHAPTER II. - THE CATHEDRAL - EXTERIOR.      Artistic unity is certainly not the chief characteristic of Hereford  Cathedral, but it is doubtful whether the absence of that quality dear to  a purist is not more than compensated for by the fine examples of  different periods, which make the massive pile as a whole a valuable  record of historical progress. And surely it is more fitting that a great  ecclesiastical edifice should grow with the successive ages it outlasts,  and bear about it architectural evidence of every epoch through which it  has passed.    Almost in the midst of the city the sturdy mass of the cathedral building  reposes in a secluded close, from which the best general view is obtained.  The close is entered either from Broad Street, near the west window, or  from Castle Street; the whole of the building lying on the south side of  the close between the path and the river. The space between the Wye and  the cathedral is filled by the Bishop's Palace and the college of the"]]]
