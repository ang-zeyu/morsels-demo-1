A sharp turn of the road to the right disclosed a slope down the creek,  across which showed orchards and fields, and a cottage nestling at the  base of the wall. The ford at this crossing gave Carley more concern  than any that had been passed, for there was greater volume and depth  of water. One of the horses slipped on the rocks, plunged up and on with  great splash. They crossed, however, without more mishap to Carley than  further acquaintance with this iciest of waters. From this point the  driver turned back along the creek, passed between orchards and fields,  and drove along the base of the red wall to come suddenly upon a large  rustic house that had been hidden from Carley's sight. It sat almost  against the stone cliff, from which poured a white foamy sheet of water.  The house was built of slabs with the bark on, and it had a lower and  upper porch running all around, at least as far as the cliff. Green  growths from the rock wall overhung the upper porch. A column of blue  smoke curled lazily upward from a stone chimney. On one of the porch  posts hung a sign with rude lettering: \"Lolomi Lodge.\"    \"Hey, Josh, did you fetch the flour?\" called a woman's voice from  inside.    \"Hullo I Reckon I didn't forgit nothin',\" replied the man, as he got  down. \"An' say, Mrs. Hutter, hyar's a young lady from Noo Yorrk.\"    That latter speech of the driver's brought Mrs. Hutter out on the porch.  \"Flo, come here,\" she called to some one evidently near at hand. And  then she smilingly greeted Carley.    \"Get down an' come in, miss,\" she said. \"I'm sure glad to see you.\"    Carley, being stiff and cold, did not very gracefully disengage herself  from the high muddy wheel and step. When she mounted to the porch she  saw that Mrs. Hutter was a woman of middle age, rather stout, with  strong face full of fine wavy lines, and kind dark eyes.    \"I'm Miss Burch,\" said Carley.    \"You're the girl whose picture Glenn Kilbourne has over his fireplace,\"  declared the woman, heartily. \"I'm sure glad to meet you, an' my  daughter Flo will be, too.\"    That about her picture pleased and warmed Carley. \"Yes, I'm Glenn  Kilbourne's fiancee. I've come West to surprise him. Is he here....  Is--is he well?\"    \"Fine. I saw him yesterday. He's changed a great deal from what he was  at first. Most all the last few months. I reckon you won't know him....  But you're wet an' cold an' you look fagged. Come right in to the fire.\"    \"Thank you; I'm all right,\" returned Carley.    At the doorway they encountered a girl of lithe and robust figure, quick  in her movements. Carley was swift to see the youth and grace of her;  and then a face that struck Carley as neither pretty nor beautiful, but  still wonderfully attractive.    \"Flo, here's Miss Burch,\" burst out Mrs. Hutter, with cheerful  importance. \"Glenn Kilbourne's girl come all the way from New York to  surprise him!\"    \"Oh, Carley, I'm shore happy to meet you!\" said the girl, in a voice of  slow drawling richness. \"I know you. Glenn has told me all about you.\"    If this greeting, sweet and warm as it seemed, was a shock to Carley,  she gave no sign. But as she murmured something in reply she looked with  all a woman's keenness into the face before her. Flo Hutter had a fair  skin generously freckled; a mouth and chin too firmly cut to suggest  a softer feminine beauty; and eyes of clear light hazel, penetrating,  frank, fearless. Her hair was very abundant, almost silver-gold in  color, and it was either rebellious or showed lack of care. Carley  liked the girl's looks and liked the sincerity of her greeting;  but instinctively she reacted antagonistically because of the frank  suggestion of intimacy with Glenn.    But for that she would have been spontaneous and friendly rather than  restrained.    They ushered Carley into a big living room and up to a fire of blazing  logs, where they helped divest her of the wet wraps. And all the time  they talked in the solicitous way natural to women who were kind and  unused to many visitors. Then Mrs. Hutter bustled off to make a cup of  hot coffee while Flo talked.    \"We'll shore give you the nicest room--with a sleeping porch right under  the cliff where the water falls. It'll sing you to sleep. Of course you  needn't use the bed outdoors until it's warmer. Spring is late here, you  know, and we'll have nasty weather yet. You really happened on Oak Creek  at its least attractive season. But then it's always--well, just Oak  Creek. You'll come to know.\"    \"I dare say I'll remember my first sight of it and the ride down that  cliff road,\" said Carley, with a wan smile.    \"Oh, that's nothing to what you'll see and do,\" returned Flo, knowingly.  \"We've had Eastern tenderfeet here before. And never was there a one of  them who didn't come to love Arizona.\"    \"Tenderfoot! It hadn't occurred to me. But of course--\" murmured Carley.    Then Mrs. Hutter returned, carrying a tray, which she set upon a chair,  and drew to Carley's side. \"Eat an' drink,\" she said, as if these  actions were the cardinally important ones of life. \"Flo, you carry her  bags up to that west room we always give to some particular person  we want to love Lolomi.\" Next she threw sticks of wood upon the fire,  making it crackle and blaze, then seated herself near Carley and beamed  upon her.    \"You'll not mind if we call you Carley?\" she asked, eagerly.    \"Oh, indeed no! I--I'd like it,\" returned Carley, made to feel friendly  and at home in spite of herself.    \"You see it's not as if you were just a stranger,\" went on Mrs. Hutter.  \"Tom--that's Flo's father--took a likin' to Glenn Kilbourne when he  first came to Oak Creek over a year ago. I wonder if you all know how  sick that soldier boy was.... Well, he lay on his back for two solid  weeks--in the room we're givin' you. An' I for one didn't think he'd  ever get up. But he did. An' he got better. An' after a while he went  to work for Tom. Then six months an' more ago he invested in the sheep  business with Tom. He lived with us until he built his cabin up West  Fork. He an' Flo have run together a good deal, an' naturally he told  her about you. So you see you're not a stranger. An' we want you to feel  you're with friends.\"    \"I thank you, Mrs. Hutter,\" replied Carley, feelingly. \"I never could  thank you enough for being good to Glenn. I did not know he was so--so  sick. At first he wrote but seldom.\"    \"Reckon he never wrote you or told you what he did in the war,\" declared  Mrs. Hutter.    \"Indeed he never did!\"    \"Well, I'll tell you some day. For Tom found out all about him. Got some  of it from a soldier who came to Flagstaff for lung trouble. He'd been  in the same company with Glenn. We didn't know this boy's name while he  was in Flagstaff. But later Tom found out. John Henderson. He was only  twenty-two, a fine lad. An' he died in Phoenix. We tried to get him  out here. But the boy wouldn't live on charity. He was always expectin'  money--a war bonus, whatever that was. It didn't come. He was a clerk at  the El Tovar for a while. Then he came to Flagstaff. But it was too cold  an' he stayed there too long.\"    \"Too bad,\" rejoined Carley, thoughtfully. This information as to the  suffering of American soldiers had augmented during the last few months,  and seemed to possess strange, poignant power to depress Carley. Always  she had turned away from the unpleasant. And the misery of unfortunates  was as disturbing almost as direct contact with disease and squalor. But  it had begun to dawn upon Carley that there might occur circumstances of  life, in every way affronting her comfort and happiness, which it would  be impossible to turn her back upon.    At this juncture Flo returned to the room, and again Carley was struck  with the girl's singular freedom of movement and the sense of sure poise  and joy that seemed to emanate from her presence.    \"I've made a fire in your little stove,\" she said. \"There's water  heating. Now won't you come up and change those traveling clothes.  You'll want to fix up for Glenn, won't you?\"    Carley had to smile at that. This girl indeed was frank and  unsophisticated, and somehow refreshing. Carley rose.    \"You are both very good to receive me as a friend,\" she said. \"I hope  I shall not disappoint you.... Yes, I do want to improve my appearance  before Glenn sees me.... Is there any way I can send word to him--by  someone who has not seen me?\"    \"There shore is. I'll send Charley, one of our hired boys.\"    \"Thank you. Then tell him to say there is a lady here from New York to  see him, and it is very important.\"    Flo Hutter clapped her hands and laughed with glee. Her gladness gave  Carley a little twinge of conscience. Jealously was an unjust and  stifling thing.    Carley was conducted up a broad stairway and along a boarded hallway  to a room that opened out on the porch. A steady low murmur of falling  water assailed her ears. Through the open door she saw across the porch  to a white tumbling lacy veil of water falling, leaping, changing, so  close that it seemed to touch the heavy pole railing of the porch.    This room resembled a tent. The sides were of canvas. It had no ceiling.  But the rough-hewn shingles of the roof of the house sloped down closely.  The furniture was home made. An Indian rug covered the floor. The bed  with its woolly clean blankets and the white pillows looked inviting.    \"Is this where Glenn lay--when he was sick?\" queried Carley.    \"Yes,\" replied Flo, gravely, and a shadow darkened her eyes. \"I ought to  tell you all about it. I will some day. But you must not be made unhappy  now.... Glenn nearly died here. Mother or I never left his side--for a  while there--when life was so bad.\"    She showed Carley how to open the little stove and put the short billets  of wood inside and work the damper; and cautioning her to keep an eye on  it so that it would not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18818"],[0,"On the Evolution of Language (#5)"],[1," which its alphabet is used, the  English has but emerged from a barbaric condition.
