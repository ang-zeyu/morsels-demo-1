Augustus, the successor of  Caesar, content with the victory obtained over the liberties of his own  country, was little ambitious of acquiring fame by foreign wars; and  being apprehensive lest the same unlimited extent of dominion, which had  subverted the republic, might also overwhelm the empire, he recommended  it to his successors never to enlarge the territories of the Romans.  Tiberius, jealous of the fame which might be acquired by his generals,  made this advice of Augustus a pretence for his inactivity.[*]         [* Tacit. Agr.]    The mad sallies of Caligula, in which he menaced Britain with an  invasion, served only to expose himself and the empire to ridicule;  and the Britons had now, during almost a century, enjoyed their liberty  unmolested, when the Romans, in the reign of Claudius, began to think  seriously of reducing them under their dominion. Without seeking any  more justifiable reasons of hostility than were employed by the late  Europeans in subjecting the Africans and Americans, they sent over an  army, [A. D. 43,] under the command of Plautius, an able general, who  gained some victories, and made a considerable progress in subduing the  inhabitants. Claudius himself, finding matters sufficiently prepared for  his reception, made a journey into Britain, and received the  submission of several British states, the Cantii, Atrebates, Regni, and  Trinobantes, who inhabited the south-east parts of the island, and whom  their possessions and more cultivated manner of life rendered willing to  purchase peace at the expense of their liberty. The other Britons, under  the command of Caractacus, still maintained an obstinate resistance, and  the Romans made little progress against them; till Ostorius Scapula was  sent over to command their armies. [A. D. 50.] This general advanced  the Roman conquests over the Britons; pierced into the country of  the Silures, a warlike nation, who inhabited the banks of the Severn;  defeated Caractacus in a great battle; took him prisoner, and sent him  to Rome, where his magnanimous behavior procured him better treatment  than those conquerors usually bestowed on captive princes.[*]         [* Tacit. Ann lib. xii.]    Notwithstanding these misfortunes, the Britons were not subdued; and  this island was regarded by the ambitious Romans as a field in which  military honor might still be acquired. [A. D. 59.] Under the reign of  Nero, Suetonius Paulinus was invested with the command, and prepared to  signalize his name by victories over those barbarians. Finding that  the island of Mona, now Anglesey, was the chief seat of the druids, he  resolved to attack it, and to subject a place which was the centre of  their superstition, and which afforded protection to all their baffled  forces. The Britons endeavored to obstruct his landing on this sacred  island, both by the force of their arms and the terrors of their  religion. The women and priests were intermingled with the soldiers upon  the shore; and running about with flaming torches in their hands, and  tossing their dishevelled hair, they struck greater terror into the  astonished Romans by their bowlings, cries, and execrations, than the  real danger from the armed forces was able to inspire. But Suetonius,  exhorting his troops to despise the menaces of a superstition which they  despised, impelled them to the attack, drove the Britons off the field,  burned the druids in the same fires which those priests had prepared for  their captive enemies, destroyed all the consecrated groves and altars;  and having thus triumphed over the religion of the Britons, he thought  his future progress would be easy in reducing the people to subjection.  But he was disappointed in his expectations. The Britons, taking  advantage of his absence, were all in arms; and headed by Boadicea,  queen of the Iceni, who had been treated in the most ignominious manner  by the Roman tribunes, had already attacked, with success, several  settlements of their insulting conquerors. Suetonius hastened to the  protection of London, which was already a flourishing Roman colony;  but found, on his arrival, that it would be requisite for the general  safety, to abandon that place to the merciless fury of the enemy. London  was reduced to ashes; such of the inhabitants as remained in it were  cruelly massacred; the Romans and all strangers, to the number of  seventy thousand, were every where put to the sword without distinction;  and the Britons, by rendering the war thus bloody, seemed determined  to cut off all hopes of peace or composition with the enemy. But this  cruelty was revenged by Suetonius in a great and decisive battle, where  eighty thousand of the Britons are said to have perished, and Boadicea  herself, rather than fall into the hands of the enraged victor, put an  end to her own life by poison.[*] Nero soon after recalled Suetonius  from a government, where, by suffering and inflicting so many  severities, he was judged improper for composing the angry and alarmed  minds of the inhabitants. After some interval, Cerealis received the  command from Vespasian, and by his bravery propagated the terror of the  Roman arms, Julius Frontinus succeeded Cerealis both in authority and in  reputation: but the general who finally established the dominion of  the Romans in this island, was Julius Agricola, who governed it in the  reigns of Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian, and distinguished himself in  that scene of action.    This great commander formed a regular plan for subduing Britain, and  rendering the acquisition useful to the conquerors. He carried his  victorious arms northwards, defeated the Britons in every encounter,  pierced into the inaccessible forests and mountains of Caledonia,  reduced every state to subjection in the southern parts of the island,  and chased before him all the men of fiercer and more intractable  spirits, who deemed war and death itself less intolerable than servitude  under the victors. He even defeated them in a decisive action, which  they fought under Galgacus, their leader; and having fixed a chain of  garrisons between the Friths of Clyde and Forth, he thereby cut off  the ruder and more barren parts of the island, and secured the Roman  province from the incursions of the barbarous inhabitants.[*]         [* Tacit Ann. lib. xiv.]    During these military enterprises, he neglected not the arts of peace.  He introduced laws and civility among the Britons, taught them to desire  and raise all the conveniences of life, reconciled them to the Roman  language and manners, instructed them in letters and science, and  employed every expedient to render those chains which he had forged both  easy and agreeable to them.[*]         [* Tacit. Agr.]    The inhabitants, having experienced how unequal their own force was to  resist that of the Romans, acquiesced in the dominion of their masters,  and were gradually incorporated as a part of that mighty empire.    This was the last durable conquest made by the Romans, and Britain,  once subdued, gave no further inquietude to the victor. Caledonia alone,  defended by its barren mountains, and by the contempt which the Romans  entertained for it, sometimes infested the more cultivated parts of the  island by the incursions of its inhabitants. The better to secure  the frontiers of the empire, Adrian, who visited this island, built a  rampart between the River Tyne and the Frith of Solway; Lollius Urbicus,  under Antoninus Pius, erected one in the place where Agricola had  formerly established his garrisons, Severus, who made an expedition  into Britain, and carried his arms to the most northern extremity of it,  added new fortifications to the wall of Adrian; and during the reigns  of all the Roman emperors, such a profound tranquillity prevailed in  Britain, that little mention is made of the affairs of that island by  any historian. The only incidents which occur, are some seditions or  rebellions of the Roman legions quartered there, and some usurpations  of the imperial dignity by the Roman governors. The natives, disarmed,  dispirited, and submissive, had lost all desire and even idea of their  former liberty and independence.      But the period was now come, when that enormous fabric of the Roman  empire, which had diffused slavery and oppression, together with peace  and civility, over so considerable a part of the globe, was approaching  towards its final dissolution. Italy, and the centre of the empire,  removed during so many ages from all concern in the wars, had entirely  lost the military spirit, and were peopled by an enervated race, equally  disposed to submit to a foreign yoke, or to the tyranny of their own  rulers. The emperors found themselves obliged to recruit their  legions from the frontier provinces, where the genius of war, though  languishing, was not totally extinct; and these mercenary forces,  careless of laws and civil institutions, established a military  government no less dangerous to the sovereign than to the people.  The further progress of the same disorders introduced the bordering  barbarians into the service of the Romans; and those fierce nations,  having now added discipline to their native bravery, could no longer be  restrained by the impotent policy of the emperors, who were accustomed  to employ one in the destruction of the others. Sensible of their own  force, and allured by the prospect of so rich a prize, the northern  barbarians, in the reign of Arcadius and Honorius, assailed at once  all the frontiers of the Roman empire; and having first satiated their  avidity by plunder, began to think of fixing a settlement in the wasted  provinces. The more distant barbarians, who occupied the deserted  habitations of the former, advanced in their acquisitions, and pressed"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19212"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol. I., Part B. (#5)"],[1,"England, who were the king's wards.  [*] And, as the source of Henry's bounty began to fail, his Savoyard  ministry applied to Rome, and obtained a bull, permitting him to resume  all past grants; absolving him from the oath which he had taken to  maintain them; even enjoining him to make such a resumption, and  representing those grants as invalid, on account of the prejudice which  ensued from them to the Roman pontiff, in whom the superiority of the  kingdom was vested.[**] The opposition made to the intended resumption  prevented it from taking place; but the nation saw the indignities to  which the king was willing to submit, in order to gratify the avidity of  his foreign favorites. About the same time he published in England the  sentence of excommunication, pronounced against the emperor Frederic,  his brother-in-law;[***] and said in excuse, that, being the pope's  vassal, he was obliged by his allegiance to obey all the commands of his  holiness. In this weak reign, when any neighboring potentate insulted  the king's dominions, instead of taking revenge for the injury, he  complained to the pope as his superior lord, and begged him to give  protection to his vassal.[****]         * M. Paris, p. 236, 301, 305, 316, 541.         **M. West. p. 302, 304.         *** M. Paris, p. 484.         ****M. West.p. 338.    {1247.} The resentment of the English barons rose high at the preference  given to foreigners; but no remonstrance or complaint could ever prevail  on the king to abandon them, or even to moderate his attachment towards  them. After the Provencals and Savoyards might have been supposed pretty  well satiated with the dignities and riches which they had acquired, a  new set of hungry foreigners were invited over, and shared among them  those favors which the king ought in policy to have conferred on the  English nobility, by whom his government could have been supported and  defended. His mother Isabella, who had been unjustly taken by the late  king from the count de la Marche, to whom she was betrothed, was no  mistress of herself by the death of her husband, than she married that  nobleman;[*] and she had born him four sons, Guy, William, Geoffrey, and  Aymer, whom she sent over to England, in order to pay a visit to their  brother. The good-natured and affectionate disposition of Henry was  moved at the sight of such near relations; and he considered neither his  own circumstances, nor the inclinations of his people, in the honors and  riches which he conferred upon them.[**] Complaints rose as high against  the credit of the Gascon, as ever they had done against that of the  Poictevin and of the Savoyard favorites; and to a nation prejudiced  against them, all their measures appeared exceptionable and criminal.  Violations of the Great Charter were frequently mentioned; and it is  indeed more than probable, that foreigners, ignorant of the laws, and  relying on the boundless affections of a weak prince, would, in an  age when a regular administration was not any where known, pay more  attention to their present interest than to the liberties of the people.  It is reported that the Poictevins and other strangers, when the  laws were at any time appealed to in opposition to their oppressions,  scrupled not to reply, \"What did the English laws signify to them? They  minded them not.\" And as words are often more offensive than actions,  this open contempt of the English tended much to aggravate the general  discontent, and made every act of violence committed by the foreigners  appear not only an injury, but an affront to them.[***]    I reckon not among the violations of the Great Charter some arbitrary  exertions of prerogative to which Henry's necessities pushed him, and  which, without producing any discontent, were uniformly continued by all  his successors, till the last century. As the parliament often refused  him supplies, and that in a manner somewhat rude and indecent,[****] he  obliged his opulent subjects, particularly the citizens of London, to  grant him loans of money; and it is natural to imagine that the same  want of economy which reduced him to the necessity of borrowing,  would prevent him from being very punctual in the repayment.[*****] He  demanded benevolences, or pretended voluntary contributions, from his  nobility and prelates.[******]         * Trivet, p. 174.         ** M. Paris, p. 491. M. West. p. 338. Knyghton, p. 2436.         *** M. Paris, p. 566, 666. Ann. Waverl. p. 214. Chron.       Dunst. vol. i. p. 335.         **** M. Paris, p. 301         ***** M.

Paris, p. 507    He was the first king of England, since the conquest, that could fairly  be said to lie under the restraint of law; and he was also the first  that practised the dispensing power, and he employed the clause of \"non  obstante\" in his grants and patents. When objections were made to this  novelty, he replied that the pope exercised that authority, and why  might not he imitate the example? But the abuse which the pope made of  his dispensing power, in violating the canons of general councils, in  invading the privileges and customs of all particular churches, and  in usurping on the rights of patrons, was more likely to excite the  jealousy of the people than to reconcile them to a similar practice in  their civil government. Roger de Thurkesby, one of the king's justices,  was so displeased with the precedent, that he exclaimed, \"Alas! what  times are we fallen into? Behold, the civil court is corrupted in  imitation of the ecclesiastical, and the river is poisoned from that  fountain.\"    The king's partiality and profuse bounty to his foreign relations, and  to their friends and favorites, would have appeared more tolerable to  the English, had any thing been done meanwhile for the honor of the  nation, or had Henry's enterprises in foreign countries been attended  with any success or glory to himself or to the public; at least, such  military talents in the king would have served to keep his barons in  awe, and have given weight and authority to his government. But though  he declared war against Lewis IX. in 1242, and made an expedition into  Guienne, upon the invitation of his father-in-law, the count de  la Marche, who promised to join him with all his forces, he was  unsuccessful in his attempts against that great monarch, was worsted at  Taillebourg, was deserted by his allies, lost what remained to him of  Poictou, and was obliged to return with loss of honor into England.[*]    {1253.} The Gascon nobility were attached to the English government,  because the distance of their sovereign allowed them to remain in a  state of almost total independence; and they claimed, some time after,  Henry's protection against an invasion which the king of Castile  made upon that territory. Henry returned into Guienne, and was more  successful in this expedition; but he thereby involved himself and his  nobility in an enormous debt, which both increased their discontents,  and exposed him to greater danger from their enterprises.[**]         * M. Paris, p. 393, 394, 398, 399, 405. W. Heming. p. 574.       Chron. Dunst. vol. i. p. 153.         ** M. Paris, p. 414.    Want of economy and an ill-judged liberality were Henry's great defects;  and his debts, even before this expedition, had become so troublesome,  that he sold all his plate and jewels, in order to discharge them. When  this expedient was first proposed to him, he asked where he should find  purchasers. It was replied, the citizens of London. \"On my word,\" said  he, \"if the treasury of Augustus were brought to sale, the citizens are  able to be the purchasers: these clowns, who assume to themselves  the name of barons, abound in every thing, while we are reduced to  necessities.\"[*] And he was thenceforth observed to be more forward and  greedy in his exactions upon the citizens.[**]    But the grievances which the English during this reign had reason  to complain of in the civil government, seem to have been still less  burdensome than those which they suffered from the usurpations and  exactions of the court of Rome. On the death of Langton, in 1228, the  monks of Christ-church elected Walter de Hemesham, one of their own  body, for his successor: but as Henry refused to confirm the election,  the pope, at his desire, annulled it;[***] and immediately appointed  Richard, chancellor of Lincoln, for archbishop, without waiting for a  new election. On the death of Richard, in 1231, the monks elected Ralph  de Neville, bishop of Chichester; and though Henry was much pleased with  the election, the pope, who thought that prelate too much attached  to the crown, assumed the power of annulling his election.[****] He  rejected two clergymen more, whom the monks had successively chosen; and  he at last told them that, if they would elect Edmond, treasurer of the  church of Salisbury, he would confirm their choice; and his nomination  was complied with. The pope had the prudence to appoint both times very  worthy primates; but men could not forbear observing his intention of  thus drawing gradually to himself the right of bestowing that important  dignity.         * M.

The avarice, however, more than the ambition of the see of Rome, seems  to have been in this age the ground of general complaint. The papal  ministers, finding a vast stock of power amassed by their predecessors,  were desirous of turning it to immediate profit, which they enjoyed at  home, rather than of enlarging their authority in distant countries,  where they never intended to reside. Every thing was become venal in the  Romish tribunals: simony was openly practised; no favors, and even no  justice, could be obtained without a bribe; the highest bidder was  sure to have the preference, without regard either"]]]
