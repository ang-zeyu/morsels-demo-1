But otherwise she certainly was old-fashioned, almost quaint. Her hair  was braided tight in two long braids, crossed on her neck, and tied with  a bit of black thread; there was a pair of precious little blue ribbons  in the drawer for Sundays and high days. Roxy's mother would have been  awfully shocked at the wavy, flowing hair of you Wide Awake girls, I  assure you!    And Roxy's dress. _You_ never saw a \"tow and linen\" dress, I dare say.  Roxy's dresses were all \"home-made\"--not merely cut and sewed at home;  but Roxy's father raised the flax in the field north of the house, and  Roxy's mother spun the flax and tow into thread upon funny little  wheels. Then she colored the thread, part of it indigo blue, and part of  \"copperas color,\" and after that wove it into cloth--not just enough for  a dress, but enough for two dresses for Roxy, two for herself, and some  for the men folks' shirts, besides yards and yards of dreadfully coarse  cloth for \"trousers;\" and perhaps there was a fine white piece for  sheets and pillowcases. Bless me! how the farmers' wives did work eighty  years ago!    And how that \"blue and copperas check\" did wear, and how it did shine  when it was freshly washed and ironed! Only it was made up so  ungracefully--just a plain, full skirt, plain, straight waist, and plain  straight sleeves. _You_ never saw a dress made so, because children's  clothes have been cut pretty and cunning for a great many years. Roxy's  dresses were short, and she wore straight, full \"pantalets,\" that came  down to the tops of her shoes; for Mrs. Thomas Gildersleeve would have  thought it dreadful to allow her daughter to show the shape of her round  little legs, as all children do nowadays.    To finish up, Roxy wore a \"tie-apron.\" This was simply a straight  breadth of \"store calico,\" gathered upon a band with long ends, and tied  round her waist. Very important a little girl felt when allowed to leave  off the high apron and don the \"tie-apron.\"    The first day she came to school with it on, her mates would stand one  side and look at her. \"O, dear! you feel big--don't you?\" they would say  to her. Maybe she would be obliged to \"associate by herself\" for a day  or so, until they became accustomed to the sight of the \"tie-apron,\" or  until her own good nature got the better of their envy.    A \"slat sun-bonnet,\" made of calico and pasteboard, completed Roxy's  costume on the summer morning of an eventful day in her life. It was  drawn just as far on as could be. It hid her face completely. She was  pacing along slowly, head bent down, to school. It was only eight  o'clock. Why was Roxy so early?    Well, this morning she preferred to be away from her mother. She was  \"mad\" at both her father and mother. \"Stingy things!\" she said, with a  great, angry sob.    About that time of every year, June, the children were forbidden to go  indiscriminately any more to the \"maple sugar tub.\" The sweet store  would begin to lessen alarmingly by that time, and the indulgent mother  would begin to economize.    Every day since they \"made sugar,\" Roxy had had the felicity of carrying  a great, brown, irregular, tempting chunk of maple sugar to school. She  had always divided with the girls generously. Her father did not often  give her pennies to buy cinnamon, candy, raisins, and cloves with; so  she used to \"treat\" with maple sugar in the summer, and with \"but'nut  meats\" in the winter, in return for the \"store goodies\" other girls had.    For a week now she had been prohibited the sugar-tub. This morning she  had asked her father for sixpence, to buy cinnamon. She had been  refused. \"Stingy things!\" she sobbed. \"They think a little girl can live  without money just as well as not. O, I am so ashamed! I'd like to see  how mother would like to be invited to tea by the neighbors, and never  ask any of them to _her_ house. I guess she'd feel mean! But they think  because I am a little girl, there's no need of _my_ being polite and  free-hearted! Polly Stedman has given me cinnamon three times, and I  _know_ the girls think I'm stingy! I'm _so_ ashamed!\" And Roxy's red  cheeks and shining brown eyes brimmed up and overflowed with tears.    Poor little Roxy! she herself had such a big sweet tooth! It was  absolutely impossible for her to refuse a piece of stick cinnamon or a  peppermint drop. Yesterday she had told the girls she should certainly  bring maple sugar to-day. She meant to, too, even if she \"took\" it. But  there her mother had stood at the broad shelf all the morning, making  pies and ginger snaps, and the sugar-tub set under the broad shelf.  There was no chance. She finally had asked her mother.    \"No, Roxy; the sugar will be gone in less than a month. You children eat  more sugar every year than I use in cooking. It's a wonder you have any  stomachs left.\"    \"I promised the girls some,\" pleaded Roxy.    \"Promised the girls! You've fed these girls ever since the sugar was  made. Off with you! What do you suppose your father'd say?\"    Roxy wouldn't have dared tell her father. He was a stirring,  hard-working man, that gave his family all the luxuries and comforts  that could be \"raised\" on the farm; but bought few, and growled over  what he did buy, and made no \"store debts.\" It was high time, in fact,  that Roxy's indulgent mother should begin to husband the sugar.    Roxy saw there would be no chance to \"take\" the sugar; so she had  mournfully started off. Is it strange that so generous a girl would have  stolen, if she could? Why, children, I have seen many a man do mean,  wrong, dishonest deeds, in order to be thought generous, and a \"royal  good fellow,\" by his own particular friends; and Roxy would a thousand  times rather have \"stolen\" than to have faced her mates empty-handed  this morning. She walked on in sorrowful meditation. She thought once of  going back, to see if there were eggs at the barn--she might take them  down to the store, and get candy. But she remembered they were all  brought in last night, and it was too early for the hens to have laid  this morning.    As she pondered ways and means in her little brain, a daring thought  struck her. That thought took away her breath. She turned white and  cold. Then she turned burning red all over. Her little feet shook under  her. But, my! What riches! What a supply to go to! How they would envy  her!    \"I don't care--so. They needn't be so stingy with me! And Mrs. Reub uses  so much such things I don't believe it will ever be noticed in the  'account'--and, any way, it'll be six months before he settles up.  Nobody will know it till then, and maybe--_maybe_ I shall be dead by  that time, or the world will burn up!\"    With these comforting reflections, Roxy straightened up her little  sun-bonneted head, doubled her little brown fists, and ran as hard as  she could--and Roxy could outrun most of the boys. On she ran, past the  school-house--it was not yet unlocked--right on down to the village. She  slacked up as she struck the sidewalks. She walked slower and slower, to  cool her bounding pulses and burning skin.    Still her cheeks were like two blood-red roses as she walked into the  cool, dark, old stone store; but for some reason, mental, moral, or  physical, while her cheeks remained red, her little legs and arms grew  stone cold and stiff, and spots like blood came before her eyes, and a  great ringing filled her ears, as Mr. Hampshire, the merchant himself,  instead of his clerk, came to wait upon her. \"And what will you have,  Miss Roxy--some peppermints?\"    \"No, sir. If you please, Mrs. Reuben Markham wants two pounds of  raisins, and five pounds of cinnamon, and you are to charge it to Mr.  Markham.\"    It was strange, but her voice never faltered after she got well begun.  However, for all that, Mr. Hampshire stared at her. \"_Five pounds of  cinnamon_, did you say, sis?\"    \"Yes, sir, if you please,\" answered Roxy, quietly, \"and two pounds of  raisins.\"    So Mr. Hampshire went back, and weighed out the cinnamon and raisins,  and gave them to her. She was a little startled at the mighty bundle  five pounds of stick cinnamon made; but she took them and went out, and  Mr. Hampshire went back and charged the things to Mr. Reuben Markham.    Miss Roxy went speeding back to the school-house with her aromatic  bundle. Her face was fairly radiant. She had no idea five pounds of  cinnamon were so much. O, _such a lot_! She had made up her mind what to  do with it. She couldn't, of course, carry it home. She had no trunk  that would lock, or any place safe from her mother's eyes. But in the  grove, back of the school-house, there was a tree with a hollow in it.  By hard running she got there before any of the scholars came. She put  her fragrant packages in, first filling her pocket, and then stopped the  remaining space with a couple of innocent-looking stones.    Such a happy day as it was! She found herself a perfect princess among  her mates. She \"treated\" them royally, I assure you. Everybody was so  obliging to her all day, and it was so nice to be able to make everybody  pleased and grateful! Both the day of judgment and the dying day were  put afar off--at least six months off.    Meantime, during the forenoon, Mr. Hampshire kept referring to the idea  that any one could want _five pounds of cinnamon_ at one time. Still,  little Roxy was Mrs. Reub Markham's next neighbor, and it was  perfectly probable that she should send by her.    Some time in the afternoon Mr. Reuben Markham came down to the store. He  was a wealthy man, jolly, but quick-tempered. Mr. Hampshire and he were  on excellent terms. \"How are you, Markham? and what's your wife baking  to-day?\"    \"My wife baking?\"    \"Yes.

To such qualifications I can lay no claim, and  accordingly I must regard myself as unfitted for a purely philosophic  treatment of natural theology. To speak plainly, the question of the  existence of a God is too deep for me. I dare neither affirm nor deny  it. I can only humbly confess my ignorance. Accordingly, if Lord Gifford  had required of his lecturers either a dogmatic or a philosophical  treatment of natural theology, I could not have undertaken to deliver  the lectures.    [Sidenote: The method followed in these lectures is the historical.]    But in his deed of foundation, as I understand it, Lord Gifford left his  lecturers free to follow the historical rather than the dogmatic or the  philosophical method of treatment. He says: \"The lecturers shall be  under no restraint whatever in their treatment of their theme: for  example, they may freely discuss (and it may be well to do so) all  questions about man's conceptions of God or the Infinite, their origin,  nature, and truth.\" In making this provision the founder appears to have  allowed and indeed encouraged the lecturers not only to discuss, if they  chose to do so, the philosophical basis of a belief in God, but also to  set forth the various conceptions of the divine nature which have been  held by men in all ages and to trace them to their origin: in short, he  permitted and encouraged the lecturers to compose a history of natural  theology or of some part of it. Even when it is thus limited to its  historical aspect the theme is too vast to be mastered completely by any  one man: the most that a single enquirer can do is to take a general but  necessarily superficial survey of the whole and to devote himself  especially to the investigation of some particular branch or aspect of  the subject. This I have done more or less for many years, and  accordingly I think that without being presumptuous I may attempt, in  compliance with Lord Gifford's wishes and directions, to lay before my  hearers a portion of the history of religion to which I have paid  particular attention. That the historical study of religious beliefs,  quite apart from the question of their truth or falsehood, is both  interesting and instructive will hardly be disputed by any intelligent  and thoughtful enquirer. Whether they have been well or ill founded,  these beliefs have deeply influenced the conduct of human affairs; they  have furnished some of the most powerful, persistent, and far-reaching  motives of action; they have transformed nations and altered the face of  the globe. No one who would understand the general history of mankind  can afford to ignore the annals of religion. If he does so, he will  inevitably fall into the most serious misconceptions even in studying  branches of human activity which might seem, on a superficial view, to  be quite unaffected by religious considerations.    [Sidenote: An historical enquiry into the evolution of religion  prejudices neither the question of the ethical value of religious  practice nor the question of the truth or falsehood of religious  belief.]    Therefore to trace theological and in general religious ideas to their  sources and to follow them through all the manifold influences which  they have exerted on the destinies of our race must always be an object  of prime importance to the historian, whatever view he may take of their  speculative truth or ethical value. Clearly we cannot estimate their  ethical value until we have learned the modes in which they have  actually determined human conduct for good or evil: in other words, we  cannot judge of the morality of religious beliefs until we have  ascertained their history: the facts must be known before judgment can  be passed on them: the work of the historian must precede the work of  the moralist. Even the question of the validity or truth of religious  creeds cannot, perhaps, be wholly dissociated from the question of their  origin. If, for example, we discover that doctrines which we had  accepted with implicit faith from tradition have their close analogies  in the barbarous superstitions of ignorant savages, we can hardly help  suspecting that our own cherished doctrines may have originated in the  similar superstitions of our rude forefathers; and the suspicion  inevitably shakes the confidence with which we had hitherto regarded  these articles of our faith. The doubt thus cast on our old creed is  perhaps illogical, since even if we should discover that the creed did  originate in mere superstition, in other words, that the grounds on  which it was first adopted were false and absurd, this discovery would  not really disprove the beliefs themselves, for it is perfectly possible  that a belief may be true, though the reasons alleged in favour of it  are false and absurd: indeed we may affirm with great probability that a  multitude of human beliefs, true in themselves, have been accepted and  defended by millions of people on grounds which cannot bear exact  investigation for a moment. For example, if the facts of savage life  which it will be my duty to submit to you should have the effect of  making the belief in immortality look exceedingly foolish, those of my  hearers who cherish the belief may console themselves by reflecting  that, as I have just pointed out, a creed is not necessarily false  because some of the reasons adduced in its favour are invalid, because  it has sometimes been supported by the despicable tricks of vulgar  imposture, and because the practices to which it has given rise have  often been in the highest degree not only absurd but pernicious.    [Sidenote: Yet such an enquiry may shake the confidence with which  traditional beliefs have been held.]    Thus an historical enquiry into the origin of religious creeds cannot,  strictly speaking, invalidate, still less refute, the creeds themselves,  though it may, and doubtless often does weaken the confidence with which  they are held. This weakening of religious faith as a consequence of a  closer scrutiny of religious origins is unquestionably a matter of great  importance to the community; for society has been built and cemented to  a great extent on a foundation of religion, and it is impossible to  loosen the cement and shake the foundation without endangering the  superstructure. The candid historian of religion will not dissemble the  danger incidental to his enquiries, but nevertheless it is his duty to  prosecute them unflinchingly. Come what may, he must ascertain the facts  so far as it is possible to do so; having done that, he may leave to  others the onerous and delicate task of adjusting the new knowledge to  the practical needs of mankind. The narrow way of truth may often look  dark and threatening, and the wayfarer may often be weary; yet even at  the darkest and the weariest he will go forward in the trust, if not in  the knowledge, that the way will lead at last to light and to rest; in  plain words, that there is no ultimate incompatibility between the good  and the true.    [Sidenote: To discover the origin of the idea of God we must study the  beliefs of primitive man.]    Now if we are indeed to discover the origin of man's conception of God,  it is not sufficient to analyse the ideas which the educated and  enlightened portion of mankind entertain on the subject at the present  day; for in great measure these ideas are traditional, they have been  handed down with little or no independent reflection or enquiry from  generation to generation; hence in order to detect them in their  inception it becomes necessary to push our analysis far back into the  past. Large materials for such an historical enquiry are provided for us  in the literature of ancient nations which, though often sadly mutilated  and imperfect, has survived to modern times and throws much precious  light on the religious beliefs and practices of the peoples who created  it. But the ancients themselves inherited a great part of their religion  from their prehistoric ancestors, and accordingly it becomes desirable  to investigate the religious notions of these remote forefathers of  mankind, since in them we may hope at last to arrive at the ultimate  source, the historical origin, of the whole long development.    [Sidenote: The beliefs of primitive man can only be understood through a  comparative study of the various races in the lower stages of culture.]    But how can this be done? how can we investigate the ideas of peoples  who, ignorant of writing, had no means of permanently recording their  beliefs? At first sight the thing seems impossible; the thread of  enquiry is broken off short; it has landed us on the brink of a gulf  which looks impassable. But the case is not so hopeless as it appears.  True, we cannot investigate the beliefs of prehistoric ages directly,  but the comparative method of research may furnish us with the means of  studying them indirectly; it may hold up to us a mirror in which, if we  do not see the originals, we may perhaps contemplate their reflections.  For a comparative study of the various races of mankind demonstrates, or  at least renders it highly probable, that humanity has everywhere  started at an exceedingly low level of culture, a level far beneath that  of the lowest existing savages, and that from this humble beginning all  the various races of men have gradually progressed upward at different  rates, some faster and some slower, till they have attained the  particular stage which each of them occupies at the present time.
