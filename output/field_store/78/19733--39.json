It was impossible that the royal government, including such elements  in its composition, could retain its hold on public opinion. It was  seen too clearly that the effects of a despicable coterie would tend  either to involve our country in a civil war, or overwhelm us again  with the wretchedness and slavery from which we had been delivered by  the revolution.    The absolute necessity of rising in opposition to these nefarious  attempts was felt by the entire country. Not a man would remain  neuter.    During the earliest period of the reign of Louis, the emigrant faction  comprehended nothing but the party composed of the relics of the  ancient privileged cast. The _parvenus_ of the imperial government  alone constituted the so called Bonapartists. Considering their  private gratification and profit as of greater importance than the  public cause, each party had hitherto only wrangled for place and  power. Their war was a matter of calculation and selfishness. But soon  their disputes involved the fate of the main interests created by the  revolution the emigrants directed their attacks not only against  individuals but also against principles, and the people, who had  hitherto only looked on, now shared the quarrel, and all France was  divided into two great hostile parties[7].                       [Footnote 7: I speak only of acting and thinking                     beings. In all countries there is to be found a                     class of cyphers, who are so careless, stupid, or                     selfish, that they belong to no party, and indeed                     to no nation.]    The court, the courtiers, and the ministry appeared as the central  phalanx of the _pure royalists_. As their auxiliaries, they had the  old nobility,--the priesthood,--a certain number of apostates who had  skulked away from the imperial government,--and lastly, all those who  had been disqualified by their incapacity and disloyalty from  obtaining employment under Napoleon. It was the undisguised wish of  this party to wash out every stain of the revolution, and to effect a  full and unqualified restoration of the _ancien regime_ in all its  parts, and to all intents and purposes.    On the other side were arrayed the party designated as that of the  Bonapartists, led on by our most honourable and most virtuous  citizens, and numbering within its ranks the great body of the people;  this party strove to withstand the impending resuscitation of the  privileges and abuses of the old government, and which was to be  effected only by the total subversion of our existing institutions.    The pure royalists endeavoured to annihilate the charter, which their  opponents defended, and thus a strange contradiction took place. The  royal charter had the royalists for its enemies, whilst its defenders  were only found amongst those who were stigmatized as the adherents of  Bonaparte.    Abortive attempts were made by the pure royalists to palliate the  treachery of the government. They tried to persuade the people that  the tranquillity and welfare of the nation depended but on the  re-establishment of an absolute monarch, of a feudal aristocracy, and  of all the trumpery of superstition. Such was the tendency of the  publications which issued from the ministerial press, owing their  birth to writers who had either sold themselves to the government, or  who had denationalized themselves by their political intolerance. But  it must not be supposed that liberty could remain in need of  advocates.    Each of the earliest stages of the growth of the young government of  royalty had been marked by obscure yet decisive symptoms of bad faith,  not the less mischievous because they were restricted to signs, and  symbols, and phrases. Instead of the constitution voted by the senate,  and which the king had engaged to accept and ratify, he graciously  granted and conceded a charter, by which he gave a new form to the  government; and which, according to its tenor, emanated from the  sovereign in the full and free exercise of his royal authority. The  tricoloured cockade worn by Louis XVI. and which our armies had  rendered illustrious, was exchanged for the white, though to the  mind's eye the latter was seen drenched in the blood of the people.  Louis took the title of Louis XVIII. King of France and Navarre, and  he dated his proclamations and ordinances in the 19th year of his  reign, and thus it was to be inferred, that the nation had been in a  state of rebellion during five and twenty years. He had disdained to  receive his crown from the will of the people, and rather chose to  hold it by divine right and the good offices of the Prince Regent.  These ungracious affronts wounded the national feelings, but no notice  was taken of them at the time, because it was apprehended that angry  recriminations might endanger the profit which had resulted from the  important sacrifices to which we had consented for the public good.  But when the government unveiled its deformity, the silence of the  patriotic party was at end, and they attacked the government most  unrelentingly. The editors of the Censeur were most conspicuous. Every  abuse of power, every violation of the charter, was proclaimed to  France by these young tribunes of the people; and the country was loud  in applauding their zeal, their talents, and their courage. Other  writers of a more lively class stung the emigrants to the quick by  sarcasms and satire, and brought down the chastisement of contempt and  ridicule upon those who had been spared by the gravity of the Censeur.    The nation also obtained a clear development of the anti-revolutionary  conspiracy of the administration, from the \"Memoir\" of Carnot, and the  pamphlets of Benjamin Constant. The undeniable facts, and the  unwelcome truths which were brought forward and stated by these  writers, apprized the people that their rights and liberties were in  fearful danger.    A judicial blindness had fallen upon the ministers. All warnings, all  lessons, all reproaches, were lost upon them. Far from being awed by  public opinion, they thought they deserved high honour for defying it.  The ministers had made up their mind. Deceived by the opinions which  they had formed respecting the preponderance of their faction, they  miscalculated the influence and resources of the partizans of the  revolution. Confiding in their power, and in the fear inspired by  their power, they thought it useless to maintain any further reserve;  and that they could charge onwards to the end of the career which  they had in view. Intoxicated by their ignorant enthusiasm, they  insulted the nation in the person of each individual, whilst they  encroached upon the rights which he valued most, and insulted him both  in his interests and his feelings. The imperial guard was removed from  Paris: the emigrants grudged the renown of these troops, and feared  their patriotism. It was given out that the discontent evinced by the  guard when the king came in, was the cause of the punishment which  they received[8].--But had not the government called forth this  discontent? Surely it was ungenerous to compel those heroes to walk as  attendants in the triumph of a new master. Their grief and fidelity  deserved not to be thus insulted. I then saw these honoured warriors.  Haggard looks and sullen silence revealed their feelings. Absorbed by  grief, they appeared to be insensible to the outward world. \"Vive la  Garde Imperiale\" was the shout of the pitying Parisians, who wished  to cheer them. These salutations, which, perhaps, they despised, were  unheeded. Submissive to their superiors, they obeyed the word of  command which told them that they must march: they marched, and that  was all.                       [Footnote 8: The accusation that a spirit of mutiny                     prevailed amongst them cannot be refuted more                     effectually than by quoting the expressions used by                     M. de Montesquiou on the 14th of March. \"In the                     last two months,\" said he, \"not _one_ of the                     soldiers or officers belonging to the corps of the                     old guard composing the garrison of Metz, has been                     _once_ reprimanded.\"]    Troops of the line replaced the imperial guards, who were drafted out  of the capital with great expedition. Little time elapsed before the  dissatisfaction of the new troops became manifest. The regiments were  wholly disorganized; officers were thrust upon the soldiers, amongst  whom they stood as complete strangers. In consequence of these changes  the troops were put out of temper; and they became disgusted with  service, because they were wearied by endless parades and reviews  which took place, not to perfect them in their discipline, but for the  instruction of their raw commanders. The government broke their spirit  by affronting them: they were compelled to present arms to the king's  body guard, whom they detested. The re-establishment of the \"Maison du  Roi\" was opposed by the general feeling of the nation, and it  particularly tended to rouse the jealousy and discontent of the  garrison of Paris. The troops of the line and the national guards who  were on duty at the Tuileries could not submit to acknowledge the  \"gardes du corps\" as their superiors, and refused to present arms to  them. The \"gardes du corps\" complained, and it was ordered that the  troops of the line should salute them with military honours, or be  punished. After this victory, the young \"gardes du corps,\" who were  proud of it, used to walk up and down before the sentinels, in order  to force the latter to worship their epaulettes. It may easily be  imagined how such childish insults, which were never"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22352"],[0,"American Boy's Life of Theodore Roosevelt (#5)"],[1,"an  idler. He would travel and improve his mind, and then settle down to  that for which he seemed best fitted.    To Europe then he went, accompanied by his bride, to study a little and  to visit the art galleries and museums, the palaces of kings and queens,  and the many great cities of that continent. He travelled through  Italy, Switzerland, Germany, France, and the British Isles, taking note  of everything he saw and comparing it with what he had seen in his own  country. When in lower Europe, the spirit of adventure seized him, and  he climbed those lofty mountains of the Alps, the Jungfrau and the  Matterhorn, and for those deeds of daring was made a member of the  Alpine Club of London. It may be mentioned here that climbing the  mountains mentioned is a very difficult feat, and that more than one  traveller has lost his life in such attempts. The peaks are covered with  snow and ice; the path from one cliff to the next is narrow and  uncertain, and a fall into some dark and fearful hollow usually means  death. But the danger only urged Theodore Roosevelt on, and added zest  to the undertaking.    He was intensely interested in all he saw, both in Europe proper and in  the British Isles, but wrote that he was glad to get back home again,  among his own people. To him there was no country like America, the land  of _Golden Opportunity_, as one of our most noted writers has called it.  In Europe there was more or less a lack of personal liberty; here a man  could try to make what he pleased of himself, be it cobbler or  President.    The young college graduate had an uncle in New York, named Robert B.  Roosevelt, who was a well-known lawyer. On his return to this country  Theodore Roosevelt entered his uncle's office, and likewise took up the  study of law at Columbia University, attending the lectures given by  Professor Dwight. Here again his search after what he termed \"bottom  facts\" came to light, and he is well remembered as a member of the law  class because of the way he frequently asked questions and called for  explanations--accepting nothing as a fact until it was perfectly clear  in his own mind. The interruptions did not always suit the professor or  the other students, yet they were often the means of clearing up a point  that was hazy to many others who had not the courage to thrust forth  their inquiries as did Theodore Roosevelt.    \"He wants to know it all,\" said one student, in disgust.    \"Well, never mind; I wish I knew it all,\" answered another. \"I guess he  knows what he is doing.\" And in this he was right; Theodore Roosevelt  knew exactly what he was trying to accomplish.    The young man was now twenty-three years of age, broad-shouldered, and  in much better health than ever before. He had not abandoned his  athletic training, and would often run out to the old home at Oyster Bay  for a tramp into the woods or on a hunting tour.    While still studying law, Theodore Roosevelt entered politics by taking  an active part in a Republican primary. He lived in the twenty-third  assembly district of the state. The district included a great number of  rich and influential citizens, and on that account was called the  \"Diamond Back District.\"    \"Let us put up young Roosevelt for Assembly,\" said one of the  politicians. \"He's a clever fellow.\"    \"That may be,\" said another. \"But I don't know that we can manage him.  He seems a fellow who wants his own way.\"    \"Yes, he'll want his own way, but I reckon that way will be the right  way,\" put in a third speaker.    No sooner had Theodore Roosevelt's name been mentioned as a possible  candidate than there was a storm of opposition from some politicians who  had in the past ruled the district with a rod of iron. It was a  Republican district, so that the contest for the place was entirely in  the primary.    \"If he is nominated and elected, our power will be gone,\" they told  themselves; and set to work without delay to throw the nomination into  the hands of somebody else.    Theodore Roosevelt suspected what was going on, but he said nothing to  those who opposed him. With his friends he was very frank, and told them  that if he was nominated he would do his best to win the election and  serve them honestly in the legislature.    His open-heartedness won him many friends, and when the primary was  held, those who had opposed him were chagrined to see him win the  nomination with votes to spare. Some at once predicted that he would not  be elected.    \"Those who opposed him at the primary will not vote for him,\" they  said. \"They would rather help the Democrats.\"    But this prediction proved false. At the election Theodore Roosevelt was  elected with a good majority. It was his first battle in the political  arena and if he felt proud over it, who can blame him?    The State Capitol of New York is, as my young readers must know, at  Albany, on the Upper Hudson, and hither the young assemblyman journeyed.  The assemblymen poured in from all over the state, and were made up of  all sorts and conditions of men, including bankers, farmers, merchants,  contractors, liquor dealers, and even prize-fighters. Many of these men  were thoroughly honest, but there were others who were there for gain  only, and who cared little for the passing of just laws.    The party to which Theodore Roosevelt belonged was in the minority, so  that the young assemblyman found he would have to struggle hard if he  expected to be heard at all. But the thoughts of such a struggle only  put him on his mettle, and he plunged in with a vigor that astonished  his opponents and caused great delight to his friends.    \"He is fearless,\" said one who had voted for him. \"He will make things  warm for those who don't want to act on the square.\" And he certainly  did make it warm, until a certain class grew to fear and hate him to  such a degree that they plotted to do him bodily harm.    \"He has got to learn that he must mind his own business,\" was the way  one of these corruptionists reasoned.    \"But what can we do?\" asked another. \"He's as sharp on the floor of the  Assembly as a steel trap.\"    \"We'll get Stubby to brush up against him,\" said a third.    Stubby was a bar-room loafer who had been at one time something of a  pugilist. He was a thoroughly unprincipled fellow, and it was known that  he would do almost anything for money.    \"Sure, I'll fix him,\" said Stubby. \"You just leave him to me and see how  I polish him off.\"    The corruptionists and their tool met at the Delavan House, an  old-fashioned hotel at which politicians in and around the capital were  wont to congregate, and waited for the young assemblyman. Roosevelt was  not long in putting in an appearance and was soon in deep discussion  with some friends.    \"Watch him, Stubby,\" said one of the young assemblyman's enemies. \"Don't  let him get away from you to-night.\"    \"I have me eye on him,\" answered Stubby.    Roosevelt was on the way to the buffet of the hotel when the crowd, with  Stubby in front, pushed against him rudely. The young assemblyman  stepped back and viewed those before him fearlessly.    \"Say, what do yer mean, running into me that way?\" demanded Stubby,  insolently.    As he spoke he aimed a savage blow at Theodore Roosevelt. But the young  assemblyman had not forgotten how to box, and he dodged with an agility  that was astonishing.    \"This fellow needs to be taught a lesson,\" Theodore Roosevelt told  himself, and then and there he proceeded to administer the lesson in a  manner that Stubby never forgot. He went down flat on his back, and  when he got up, he went down again, with a bleeding nose and one eye all  but closed. Seeing this, several leaped in to his assistance, but it was  an ill-fated move, for Roosevelt turned on them also, and down they  went, too; and then the encounter came to an end, with Theodore  Roosevelt the victor.    \"And that wasn't the end of it,\" said one, who witnessed the affair.  \"After it was over young Roosevelt was as smiling as ever. He walked  straight over to some of his enemies who had been watching the mix-up  from a distance and told them very plainly that he knew how the attack  had originated, and he was much obliged to them, for he hadn't enjoyed  himself so much for a year. Phew! but weren't those fellows mad! And  wasn't Stubby mad when he learned that they had set him against one of  the best boxers Harvard ever turned out? But after that you can make  sure they treated Roosevelt with respect and gave him a wide berth.\"          CHAPTER IV    THEODORE ROOSEVELT AND GOVERNOR CLEVELAND--GOOD WORK AS AN  ASSEMBLYMAN--SOME MEASURES PUSHED THROUGH--BIRTH OF ALICE  ROOSEVELT--DEATH OF MR. ROOSEVELT'S MOTHER      The career of an assemblyman is not generally an interesting one, but  Mr. Roosevelt managed to extract not a little pleasure and also some  profit from it. The experience was just what he needed to fit himself  for the larger positions he was, later on, to occupy.    One happening is of peculiar interest to note. While Theodore Roosevelt  was a member of the Assembly, Grover Cleveland became governor of the  state. Mr. Cleveland was a Democrat, while Mr. Roosevelt was a  Republican, yet the two future Presidents of the United States became  warm friends,--a friendship that has endured to the present day.    It is said that the friendship started in rather a peculiar manner.  There was at the time a measure before the Assembly to reduce the fare  of the elevated roads in New York City from ten cents to five cents.  After a great deal of talking, the bill passed the Assembly and then the  Senate, and went to the governor for his signature. Much to the surprise  of the general public Governor Cleveland vetoed the bill, stating that  when the capitalists had built the elevated roads they had understood  that the fare was to be ten cents, and that it was not right to deprive  them of their profits.
