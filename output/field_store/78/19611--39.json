[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/201"],[0,"Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions (Illustrated) (#5)"],[1,"a  Decree of Nature; and the very Laws of Evolution seem suspended in her  disfavour.  Yet at least we can admire the wise Prearrangement which  has ordained that, as they have no hopes, so they shall have no memory  to recall, and no forethought to anticipate, the miseries and  humiliations which are at once a necessity of their existence and the  basis of the constitution of Flatland.          Section 5.  Of our Methods of Recognizing one another        You, who are blessed with shade as well as light, you, who are gifted  with two eyes, endowed with a knowledge of perspective, and charmed  with the enjoyment of various colours, you, who can actually SEE an  angle, and contemplate the complete circumference of a circle in the  happy region of the Three Dimensions--how shall I make clear to you the  extreme difficulty which we in Flatland experience in recognizing one  another's configuration?    Recall what I told you above.  All beings in Flatland, animate or  inanimate, no matter what their form, present TO OUR VIEW the same, or  nearly the same, appearance, viz. that of a straight Line.  How then  can one be distinguished from another, where all appear the same?    The answer is threefold.  The first means of recognition is the sense  of hearing; which with us is far more highly developed than with you,  and which enables us not only to distinguish by the voice our personal  friends, but even to discriminate between different classes, at least  so far as concerns the three lowest orders, the Equilateral, the  Square, and the Pentagon--for of the Isosceles I take no account.  But  as we ascend in the social scale, the process of discriminating and  being discriminated by hearing increases in difficulty, partly because  voices are assimilated, partly because the faculty of  voice-discrimination is a plebeian virtue not much developed among the  Aristocracy.  And wherever there is any danger of imposture we cannot  trust to this method.  Amongst our lowest orders, the vocal organs are  developed to a degree more than correspondent with those of hearing, so  that an Isosceles can easily feign the voice of a Polygon, and, with  some training, that of a Circle himself.  A second method is therefore  more commonly resorted to.    FEELING is, among our Women and lower classes--about our upper classes  I shall speak presently--the principal test of recognition, at all  events between strangers, and when the question is, not as to the  individual, but as to the class.  What therefore \"introduction\" is  among the higher classes in Spaceland, that the process of \"feeling\" is  with us.  \"Permit me to ask you to feel and be felt by my friend Mr.  So-and-so\"--is still, among the more old-fashioned of our country  gentlemen in districts remote from towns, the customary formula for a  Flatland introduction.  But in the towns, and among men of business,  the words \"be felt by\" are omitted and the sentence is abbreviated to,  \"Let me ask you to feel Mr. So-and-so\"; although it is assumed, of  course, that the \"feeling\" is to be reciprocal.  Among our still more  modern and dashing young gentlemen--who are extremely averse to  superfluous effort and supremely indifferent to the purity of their  native language--the formula is still further curtailed by the use of  \"to feel\" in a technical sense, meaning, \"to  recommend-for-the-purposes-of-feeling-and-being-felt\"; and at this  moment the \"slang\" of polite or fast society in the upper classes  sanctions such a barbarism as \"Mr. Smith, permit me to feel Mr. Jones.\"    Let not my Reader however suppose that \"feeling\" is with us the tedious  process that it would be with you, or that we find it necessary to feel  right round all the sides of every individual before we determine the  class to which he belongs.  Long practice and training, begun in the  schools and continued in the experience of daily life, enable us to  discriminate at once by the sense of touch, between the angles of an  equal-sided Triangle, Square, and Pentagon; and I need not say that the  brainless vertex of an acute-angled Isosceles is obvious to the dullest  touch.  It is therefore not necessary, as a rule, to do more than feel  a single angle of an individual; and this, once ascertained, tells us  the class of the person whom we are addressing, unless indeed he  belongs to the higher sections of the nobility.  There the difficulty  is much greater.  Even a Master of Arts in our University of Wentbridge  has been known to confuse a ten-sided with a twelve-sided Polygon; and  there is hardly a Doctor of Science in or out of that famous University  who could pretend to decide promptly and unhesitatingly between a  twenty-sided and a twenty-four sided member of the Aristocracy.    Those of my readers who recall the extracts I gave above from the  Legislative code concerning Women, will readily perceive that the  process of introduction by contact requires some care and discretion.  Otherwise the angles might inflict on the unwary Feeler irreparable  injury.  It is essential for the safety of the Feeler that the Felt  should stand perfectly still.  A start, a fidgety shifting of the  position, yes, even a violent sneeze, has been known before now to  prove fatal to the incautious, and to nip in the bud many a promising  friendship.  Especially is this true among the lower classes of the  Triangles.  With them, the eye is situated so far from their vertex  that they can scarcely take cognizance of what goes on at that  extremity of their frame.  They are, moreover, of a rough coarse  nature, not sensitive to the delicate touch of the highly organized  Polygon.  What wonder then if an involuntary toss of the head has ere  now deprived the State of a valuable life!    I have heard that my excellent Grandfather--one of the least irregular  of his unhappy Isosceles class, who indeed obtained, shortly before his  decease, four out of seven votes from the Sanitary and Social Board for  passing him into the class of the Equal-sided--often deplored, with a  tear in his venerable eye, a miscarriage of this kind, which had  occured to his great-great-great-Grandfather, a respectable Working Man  with an angle or brain of 59 degrees 30 minutes.  According to his  account, my unfortunate Ancestor, being afflicted with rheumatism, and  in the act of being felt by a Polygon, by one sudden start accidentally  transfixed the Great Man through the diagonal; and thereby, partly in  consequence of his long imprisonment and degradation, and partly  because of the moral shock which pervaded the whole of my Ancestor's  relations, threw back our family a degree and a half in their ascent  towards better things.  The result was that in the next generation the  family brain was registered at only 58 degrees, and not till the lapse  of five generations was the lost ground recovered, the full 60 degrees  attained, and the Ascent from the Isosceles finally achieved.  And all  this series of calamities from one little accident in the process of  Feeling.    At this point I think I hear some of my better educated readers  exclaim, \"How could you in Flatland know anything about angles and  degrees, or minutes?  We can SEE an angle, because we, in the region of  Space, can see two straight lines inclined to one another; but you, who  can see nothing but one straight line at a time, or at all events only  a number of bits of straight lines all in one straight line--how can  you ever discern any angle, and much less register angles of different  sizes?\"    I answer that though we cannot SEE angles, we can INFER them, and this  with great precision.  Our sense of touch, stimulated by necessity, and  developed by long training, enables us to distinguish angles far more  accurately than your sense of sight, when unaided by a rule or measure  of angles.  Nor must I omit to explain that we have great natural  helps.  It is with us a Law of Nature that the brain of the Isosceles  class shall begin at half a degree, or thirty minutes, and shall  increase (if it increases at all) by half a degree in every generation;  until the goal of 60 degrees is reached, when the condition of serfdom  is quitted, and the freeman enters the class of Regulars.    Consequently, Nature herself supplies us with an ascending scale or  Alphabet of angles for half a degree up to 60 degrees, Specimens of  which are placed in every Elementary School throughout the land.  Owing  to occasional retrogressions, to still more frequent moral and  intellectual stagnation, and to the extraordinary fecundity of the  Criminal and Vagabond Classes, there is always a vast superfluity of  individuals of the half degree and single degree class, and a fair  abundance of Specimens up to 10 degrees.  These are absolutely  destitute of civic rights; and a great number of them, not having even  intelligence enough for the purposes of warfare, are devoted by the  States to the service of education.  Fettered immovably so as to remove  all possibility of danger, they are placed in the class rooms of our  Infant Schools, and there they are utilized by the Board of Education  for the purpose of imparting to the offspring of the Middle Classes  that tact and intelligence of which these wretched creatures themselves  are utterly devoid.    In some States the Specimens are occasionally fed and suffered to exist  for several years; but in the more temperate and better regulated  regions, it is found in the long run more advantageous for the  educational interests of the young, to dispense with food, and to renew  the Specimens every month--which is about the average duration of the  foodless existence of the Criminal class.  In the cheaper schools, what  is gained by the longer existence of the Specimen is lost, partly in  the expenditure for food, and partly in the diminished accuracy of the  angles, which are impaired after a few weeks of constant \"feeling\".  Nor must we forget to add, in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20102"],[0,"The International Monthly Magazine - Volume V - No II (#5)"],[1,"formed (at times from  trifles of almost incredible levity), and which when once fairly  developed, is well-nigh ineradicable. In a word, it is to the views of the  people.    We propose, as opportunity shall offer, to make our readers familiar with  the writings of all these different classes of travellers--and in the  present article, we shall make a few extracts from a work interesting, as  having probably contributed more than any other to a general knowledge of  the United States in Germany. It is the book which has had the greatest  currency among all classes, but particularly with the lower order of  readers and emigrants.    Before proceeding, however, to the work itself, it may be as well to  answer a question which has perhaps been suggested to the minds of a  certain class of readers. Of what great use, after all, is this nervous  regard as to the opinion of the world? Is not our character  established--are not our characteristics known, to the uttermost corners of  the earth? To which question we may answer, _Not quite_. In avoiding that  ridiculous sensitiveness which prompts so many Americans to feel  personally insulted by the weak remarks of every wandering ignoramus, we  would by no means fall into the opposite error of attaching no importance  whatever to the good opinion or the degree of consciousness as to our  existence entertained by the world at large.    Should any feel disposed to smile at such an expression, as \"the  consciousness of our existence,\" we will take the liberty of citing a few  curious instances, for the authenticity of which we assume the entire  responsibility--instances which may perhaps astonish a few even of the  better informed. There are in many districts (not altogether provincial)  of Italy and France great numbers, who would not even in America be  classed as _ignorant_ in regard to other matters, who have not the  remotest idea as to the nature or geography of our country. An instance  has come to our knowledge of an intelligent Hungarian who, by intercourse  with the world, had acquired a fluency in five languages, and who inquired  of an American gentleman if his country were not situated somewhere in  England. The late Mr. Cooper, when placing his daughters at a celebrated  seminary on the continent, found a great curiosity had been created by the  rumor that they were coming, some supposing they were black, some that  they were copper-colored, and all unprepared to see American girls looking  for all the world like the young German ladies. We have heard of a similar  instance in which an English _gentleman_--a Cambridge graduate--inquired of  an American what was the current language of the United States. Lastly, we  may cite the case of an English author, well known to our own public, and  favorably mentioned not long since in these pages, who was under the  impression that owing to the great emigration from Germany, the English  language must with us, in a very few years, yield to that of the  _Vaterland_. Now our commercial and industrial relations are seriously  hindered by this absurd ignorance of America, which in a word prevails to  such an extent, that we have known an American, who--probably from having  been over-questioned and speered at in New England--had imbibed such a  wholesome hatred of inquisitiveness, that he wished the French government  would hang up, for the benefit of all concerned, the following list of  questions, with satisfactory answers annexed, in all the _cafes_ of the  politest nation in Europe:          Whether America is an island or a continent?        What is the color of its inhabitants?        What language do they speak?        Have they a religion and what is it?        What is the state of their morals and cookery?        Have they a correct state of feeling as regards the opera?    The reader is not to infer that this is the general state of knowledge  regarding our country. But it is worth nothing as a curious illustration  of the vast number of individuals who derive their ideas, not from what is  going on at the present day, or from available sources of information, but  from the antiquated views of a by-gone generation. And we trust it will  not be deemed inappropriate that we here speak a word of the want of  opportunities of acquiring very general information under which the  ordinary readers of continental Europe suffer. With all their libraries,  all their immense arrays of magazines and journals, we find among them an  apathy in regard to the world without (to the Fan-Qui), which appears  incredible until we reflect on the deadening influences of the censorship,  which views with distrust all information in regard to the Land of  Liberty. We are not aware, throughout the whole of continental Europe, of  a single publication so thoroughly cosmopolite in its character, so  general in the scope of its information, or which is so universally  disseminated among _all_ classes of readers, as _The International_; and  we trust we do not go too far when we assert, that it is to an extended  sale of periodical publications somewhat approaching it in the  concentration and dissemination of news from the world at large, that our  countrymen owe that superior intelligence and citizen-of-the-world  character which distinguish them from the insular Briton, self-important  Frenchman, or abstracted German.    The work from which we propose to make some extracts, is TRAUGOTT BROMME's  _Hand und Reisebuch fuer Auswanderer nach den Vereinigten Staaten_ (or  Traugott Bromme's Journey and Handbook for Emigrants to the United  States). As we have already stated, no work on America is at the present  day more familiarly known to that class of readers to whom it is  addressed. Certain remarks on the present condition of German emigration  with which it is prefaced, may not be devoid of interest to our readers,  though not constituting a part of such observations as we have more  particularly referred to:          \"There is, it appears, implanted in every man an impulse to      advance and better his condition--an impulse caused by poverty,      dependent circumstances, or pressure from every side, vexing at      times even the highest in rank, and which is the cause why      thousands leave their fatherland, to seek afar a now home, and      hundreds of thousands cast around them disturbed and anxious      glances, restrained only by hard poverty, which imprisons them at      home. Such is very generally the case at present in our own      country, where--despite the political concessions of March in the      year 1848, of the published original privileges of the German      people, and of the promising prospect of a free and united      Germany, with a concluding general empire--emigration appears to be      by no means on the decrease.\" \"These emigrants of the present day      consist not as formerly of poor people of the lower orders, who      turn their backs on the German fatherland, or liberal declaimers,      dreaming of an ideal of freedom which could scarcely be realized      in Utopia, but of sober excellent families of the middle class,      who, free from all delusive fancies, do not expect to find in the      western world wealth and honorable offices, but desire only to      inhabit a land, wherein they may dwell quietly and happily with      their children.\" \"What the German wants is _room_--a new broad      field for his abilities--and this America extends to him in      unbounded space. No one at the present day hopes to obtain hills      of gold without labor, but every one knows that the far more      estimable treasure of perfect independence, or to speak more      correctly, of perfect _self-dependence_, with the prospect of a      future free from care, may in America be obtained at the cost of a      few years of earnest, honest industry. And what, to the man      oppressed in his fatherland by all the cares incident upon the      obtaining a bare subsistence, is two or three or even _four_ years      of hard work, when compared to a whole life of poverty and      misery?\"      After accurately sketching the extreme misery and poverty oppressing the  inhabitants of many districts of Germany, of late years sadly increased by  the falling off in manufactures since the political disturbances, our  author proceeds to set forth the advantages offered by America:          \"That most emigrants should rather look to America, than Poland,      Russia, Servia, or Siebenburgen, is natural enough, since all of      these countries together cannot offer so many attractions as      America. Where on earth is there such a vast array of unoccupied      lands, offered at such a moderate price--land so cheap that in many      districts twenty or thirty and even more acres, covered with wood,      are given at a price for which a single acre of similar land is      sold in Germany?\"      The richness of the soil, the excellence of the climate, and the demand  for labor, are then described; to which, as the greatest inducement, he  adds the fact that in _America_ the fullest \"liberty of labor and  mechanical calling or trade,\" is allowed. Also, that the taxes are so  light that an industrious man is able not only to live, but even to lay up  something for his old age, or his children, or to employ in the extension  of his business.          \"For as there exists in America no standing army, its inhabitants      may retain their children, as the best possible assistants in      labor, and train, govern, and discipline them as can only properly      done under the eye of a parent. Furthermore, in that country every      one is permitted to enjoy the fullest civil and religious liberty.      These are the advantages to be expected from an emigration to      America, _and he who anticipates more will find himself bitterly      deceived_. But a man who can be content with this, and can live      actively, moderately, and frugally, "]]]
