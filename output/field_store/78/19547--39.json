(#5)"],[1,"Broughton, a man of great interest in  Lancashire, he retired to Flanders, where Lovel had arrived a little  before him; and he lived during some time in the court of his aunt the  duchess of Burgundy, by whom he had been invited over.    Margaret, widow of Charles the Bold, duke of Burgundy, not having any  children of her own, attached herself with an entire friendship to her  daughter-in-law, married to Maximilian, archduke of Austria; and after  the death of that princess, she persevered in her affection to Philip  and Margaret, her children, and occupied herself in the care of their  education and of their persons. By her virtuous conduct and demeanor  she had acquired great authority among the Flemings and lived with much  dignity, as well as economy, upon that ample dowry which she inherited  from her husband. The resentments of this princess were no less warm  than her friendships; and that spirit of faction, which it is so  difficult for a social and sanguine temper to guard against, had taken  strong possession of her heart, and intrenched somewhat on the probity  which shone forth in the other parts of her character. Hearing of the  malignant jealousy entertained by Henry against her family, and  his oppression of all its partisans, she was moved with the highest  indignation; and she determined to make him repent of that enmity to  which so many of her friends, without any reason or necessity, had  fallen victims.    {1487.} After consulting with Lincoln and Lovel she hired a body of two  thousand veteran Germans, under the command of Martin Swart, a brave  and experienced officer; [*] and sent them over, together with these two  noblemen, to join Simnel in Ireland. The countenance given by persons  of such high rank, and the accession of this military force, much raised  the courage of the Irish, and made them entertain the resolution of  invading England, where they believed the spirit of disaffection as  prevalent as it appeared to be in Ireland. The poverty also under which  they labored, made it impossible for them to support any longer their  new court and army, and inspired them with a strong desire of enriching  themselves by plunder and preferment in England.          * Polyd. Virg. p. 572, 573.    Henry was not ignorant of these intentions of his enemies, and he  prepared himself for defence. He ordered troops to be levied in  different parts of the kingdom, and put them under the command of the  duke of Bedford and earl of Oxford. He confined the marquis of Dorset,  who, he suspected, would resent the injuries suffered by his mother, the  queen dowager; and, to gratify the people by an appearance of devotion,  he made a pilgrimage to our lady of Walsingham, famous for miracles;  and there offered up prayers for success, and for deliverance from his  enemies.    Being informed that Simnel was landed at Foudrey in Lancashire, he drew  together his forces, and advanced towards the enemy as far as Coventry.  The rebels had entertained hopes that the disaffected counties in the  north would rise in their favor; but the people in general, averse to  join Irish and German invaders, convinced of Lambert's imposture, and  kept in awe by the king's reputation for success and conduct, either  remained in tranquillity, or gave assistance to the royal army. The earl  of Lincoln, therefore, who commanded the rebels, finding no hopes but  in victory, was determined to bring the matter to a speedy decision; and  the king, supported by the native courage of his temper, and emboldened  by a great accession of volunteers, who had joined him under the earl of  Shrewsbury and Lord Strange, declined not the combat. The hostile armies  met at Stoke, in the county of Nottingham, and fought a battle, which  was bloody, and more obstinately disputed than could have been expected  from the inequality of their force. All the leaders of the rebels were  resolved to conquer or to perish; and they inspired their troops  with like resolution. The Germans also, being veteran and experienced  soldiers, kept the event long doubtful; and even the Irish, though  ill-armed and almost defenceless, showed themselves not defective in  spirit and bravery. The king's victory was purchased with loss, but was  entirely decisive. Lincoln, Broughton, and Swart perished in the field  of battle, with four thousand of their followers. As Lovel was never  more heard of, he was believed to have undergone the same fate; Simnel,  with his tutor, Simon, was taken prisoner. Simon, being a priest, was  not tried at law, and was only committed to close custody: Simnel was  too contemptible to be an object either of apprehension or resentment to  Henry. He was pardoned, and made a scullion in the king's kitchen whence  he was afterwards advanced to the rank of a falconer.[*]         * Bacon, p. 586. Polyd. Virg. p; 574.    Henry had now leisure to revenge himself on his enemies. He made a  progress into the northern parts, where he gave many proofs of his  rigorous disposition. A strict inquiry was made after those who had  assisted or favored the rebels. The punishments were not all sanguinary:  the king made his revenge subservient to his avarice. Heavy fines were  levied upon the delinquents. The proceedings of the courts, and even the  courts themselves, were arbitrary. Either the criminals were tried by  commissioners appointed for the purpose, or they suffered punishment  by sentence of a court-martial. And as a rumor had prevailed before the  battle of Stoke, that the rebels had gained the victory, that the royal  army was cut in pieces, and that the king himself had escaped by flight,  Henry was resolved to interpret the belief or propagation of this report  as a mark of disaffection; and he punished many for that pretended  crime. But such in this age was the situation of the English government,  that the royal prerogative, which was but imperfectly restrained during  the most peaceable periods, was sure, in tumultuous or even suspicious  times, which frequently recurred, to break all bounds of law, and to  violate public liberty.    After the king had gratified his rigor by the punishment of his enemies,  he determined to give contentment to the people in a point which, though  a mere ceremony, was passionately desired by them. The queen had  been married near two years, but had not yet been crowned; and this  affectation of delay had given great discontent to the public, and had  been one principal source of the disaffection which prevailed. The king,  instructed by experience, now finished the ceremony of her coronation;  and to show a disposition still more gracious, he restored to liberty  the marquis of Dorset, who had been able to clear himself of all the  suspicions entertained against him.         * Bacon, p. 586. Polyd. Virg. p; 574.            CHAPTER XXV.          HENRY VII.    {1488.} The king acquired great reputation throughout Europe by the  vigorous and prosperous conduct of his domestic affairs; but as some  incidents about this time invited him to look abroad, and exert himself  in behalf of his allies, it will be necessary, in order to give a  just account of his foreign measures, to explain the situation of  the neighboring kingdoms, beginning with Scotland, which lies most  contiguous.    The kingdom of Scotland had not yet attained that state which  distinguishes a civilized monarchy, and which enables the government, by  the force of its laws and institutions alone, without any extraordinary  capacity in the sovereign, to maintain itself in order and tranquillity.  James III., who now filled the throne, was a prince of little industry  and of a narrow genius; and though it behoved him to yield the reins of  government to his ministers, he had never been able to make any choice  which could give contentment both to himself and to his people. When he  bestowed his confidence on any of the principal nobility, he found that  they exalted their own family to such a height as was dangerous to the  prince, and gave umbrage to the state: when he conferred favor on any  person of meaner birth, on whose submission he could more depend,  the barons of his kingdom, enraged at the power of an upstart minion,  proceeded to the utmost extremities against their sovereign. Had Henry  entertained the ambition of conquests, a tempting opportunity now  offered of reducing that kingdom to subjection; but as he was probably  sensible that a warlike people, though they might be overrun by reason  of their domestic divisions, could not be retained in obedience without  a regular military force, which was then unknown in England, he rather  intended the renewal of the peace with Scotland, and sent an embassy to  James for that purpose. But the Scots, who never desired a durable peace  with England, and who deemed their security to consist in constantly  preserving themselves in a warlike posture, would not agree to more than  a seven years' truce, which was accordingly concluded.[*]         * Polyd. Virg. p. 575.    The European states on the continent were then hastening fast to the  situation in which they have remained, without any material alteration,  for near three centuries; and began to unite themselves into one  extensive system of policy, which comprehended the chief powers of  Christendom. Spain, which had hitherto been almost entirely occupied  within herself, now became formidable by the union of Arragon and  Castile in the persons of Ferdinand and Isabella, who, being princes  of great capacity, employed their force in enterprises the most  advantageous to their combined monarchy. The conquest of Granada from  the Moors was then undertaken, and brought near to a happy conclusion.  And in that expedition the military genius of Spain was revived; honor  and security were attained; and her princes, no longer kept in awe by a  domestic enemy so dangerous, began to enter into all the transactions of  Europe, and make a great"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19214"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol. I., Part D. (#5)"],[1," has raised a church to such an exorbitant height as  that of Rome, persecution is less the result of bigotry in the priests,  than of a necessary policy; and the rigor of law is the only method of  repelling the attacks of men who, besides religious zeal, have so many  other motives, derived both from public and private interest, to engage  them on the side of innovation. But though such overgrown hierarchies  may long support themselves by these violent expedients, the time comes  when severities tend only to enrage the new sectaries, and make them  break through all bounds of reason and moderation. This crisis was  now visibly approaching in Scotland; and whoever considers merely the  transactions resulting from it, will be inclined to throw the blame  equally on both parties; whoever enlarges his view, and reflects on the  situations, will remark the necessary progress of human affairs, and the  operation of those principles which are inherent in human nature.    Some heads of the reformers in Scotland, such as the earl of Argyle, his  son Lord Lorne, the earls of Morton and Glencarne, Erskine of Dun, and  others, observing the danger to which they were exposed, and desirous  to propagate their principles, entered privately into a bond or  association; and called themselves the \"congregation\" of the Lord, in  contradistinction to the established church, which they denominated  the congregation of Satan. The tenor of the bond was as follows: \"We,  perceiving how Satan, in his members, the Antichrist of our time, do  cruelly rage, seeking to overthrow and to destroy the gospel of Christ  and his congregation, ought, according to our bounden duty, to strive in  our master's cause, even unto the death, being certain of the victory  in him. We do therefore promise, before the majesty of God and  his congregation, that we, by his grace, shall with all diligence  continually apply our whole power, substance, and our very lives, to  maintain, set forward, and establish the most blessed word of God  and his congregation; and shall labor, by all possible means, to have  faithful ministers, truly and purely to minister Christ's gospel and  sacraments to his people: we shall maintain them, nourish them, and  defend them, the whole congregation of Christ, and every member thereof,  by our whole power, and at the hazard of our lives, against Satan, and  all wicked power who may intend tyranny and trouble against the  said congregation; unto which holy word and congregation we do join  ourselves; and we forsake and renounce the congregation of Satan, with  all the superstitious abomination and idolatry thereof; and moreover  shall declare ourselves manifestly enemies thereto, by this faithful  promise before God, testified to this congregation by our subscriptions.  At Edinburgh, the third of December, 1557.\"[*]         * Keith, p. 66. Knox, p. 101.    Had the subscribers of this zealous league been content only to demand  a toleration of the new opinions, however incompatible their pretensions  might have been with the policy of the church of Rome, they would  have had the praise of opposing tyrannical laws, enacted to support an  establishment prejudicial to civil society: but it is plain that  they carried their views much further; and their practice immediately  discovered the spirit by which they were actuated. Supported by the  authority which they thought belonged to them as the congregation of the  Lord, they ordained that prayers in the vulgar tongue[*] should be used  in all the parish churches of the kingdom; and that preaching and the  interpretation of the Scriptures should be practised in private houses,  til God should move the prince to grant public preaching by faithful  and true ministers.[**] Such bonds of association are always the  fore-runners of rebellion; and this violent invasion of the established  religion was the actual commencement of it.    Before this league was publicly known or avowed, the clergy, alarmed  with the progress of the reformation, attempted to recover their lost  authority by a violent exercise of power, which tended still further  to augment the zeal and number of their enemies. Hamilton, the primate,  seized Walter Mill, a priest of an irreproachable life, who had embraced  the new doctrines; and having tried him at St. Andrew's, condemned him  to the flames for heresy. Such general aversion was entertained against  this barbarity, that it was some time before the bishops could prevail  on any one to act the part of a civil judge, and pronounce sentence upon  Mill; and even after the time of his execution was fixed, all the shops  of St. Andrew's being shut, no one would sell a rope to tie him to the  stake and the primate himself was obliged to furnish this implement.  The man bore the torture with that courage which, though usual on these  occasions, always appears supernatural and astonishing to the multitude.  The people, to express their abhorrence against the cruelty of the  priests, raised a monument of stones on the place of his execution; and  as fast as the stones were removed by order of the clergy, they were  again supplied from the voluntary zeal of the populace.[***] It is in  vain for men to oppose the severest punishment to the united motives  of religion and public applause; and this was the last barbarity of the  kind which the Catholics had the power to exercise in Scotland.         * The reformers used at that time King Edward's liturgy in       Scotland. Forbes, p. 155.         * Keith, p. 66. Knox, p. 101.         * Knox, p. 122.    Some time after, the people discovered their sentiments in such a manner  as was sufficient to prognosticate to the priests the fate which was  awaiting them. It was usual on the festival of St. Giles, the tutelar  saint of Edinburgh, to carry in procession the image of that saint; but  the Protestants, in order to prevent the ceremony, found means, on the  eve of the festival, to purloin the statue from the church; and they  pleased themselves with imagining the surprise and disappointment of  his votaries. The clergy, however, framed hastily a new image, which in  derision was called by the people young St. Giles; and they carried it  through the streets, attended by all the ecclesiastics in the town and  neighborhood. The multitude abstained from violence so long as the queen  regent continued a spectator; but the moment she retired, they invaded  the idol, threw it in the mire, and broke it in pieces. The flight and  terror of the priests and friars, who, it was remarked, deserted, in  his greatest distress, the object of their worship, was the source of  universal mockery and laughter.    Encouraged by all these appearances, the congregation proceeded with  alacrity in openly soliciting subscriptions to their league; and  the death of Mary of England, with the accession of Elizabeth, which  happened about this time, contributed to increase their hopes of final  success in their undertaking. They ventured to present a petition to  the regent, craving a reformation of the church, and of the \"wicked,  scandalous, and detestable\" lives of the prelates and ecclesiastics.[*]  They framed a petition which they intended to present to parliament,  and in which, after premising that they could not communicate with the  damnable idolatry and intolerable abuses of the Papistical church, they  desired that the laws against heretics should be executed by the civil  magistrate alone, and that the Scripture should be the sole rule  in judging of heresy.[**] They even petitioned the convocation, and  insisted that prayers should be said in the vulgar tongue, and that  bishops should be chosen with the consent of the gentry of the diocese,  and priests with the consent of the parishioners.[***] The regent  prudently temporized between these parties; and as she aimed at  procuring a matrimonial crown for her son-in-law the dauphin, she was,  on that as well as other accounts, unwilling to come to extremities with  either of them.         * Knox, p. 121.         ** Knox, p. 123.         *** Keith, p. 78, 81, 82.    But after this concession was obtained, she received orders from France,  probably dictated by the violent spirit of her brothers, to proceed with  rigor against the reformers, and to restore the royal authority by some  signal act of power.[*] She made the more eminent of the Protestant  teachers be cited to appear before the council at Stirling; but when  their followers were marching thither in great multitudes, in order  to protect and countenance them, she entertained apprehensions of an  insurrection, and, it is said, dissipated the people by a promise[**]  [2] that nothing should be done to the prejudice of the ministers.  Sentence, however, was passed, by which all the ministers were  pronounced rebels, on account of their not appearing; a measure which  enraged the people, and made them resolve to oppose the regent's  authority by force of arms, and to proceed to extremities against the  clergy of the established religion.    In this critical time, John Knox arrived from Geneva, where he had  passed some years in banishment, and where he had imbibed, from his  commerce with Calvin, the highest fanaticism of his sect, augmented by  the native ferocity of his own character. He had been invited back to  Scotland by the leaders of the reformation; and mounting the pulpit at  Perth, during the present ferment of men's minds, he declaimed with  his usual vehemence against the idolatry and other abominations of the  church of Rome, and incited his audience to exert their utmost zeal for  its subversion. A priest was so imprudent, after this sermon, as to open  his repository of images and relics, and prepare himself to say mass.  The audience, exalted to a disposition for any furious enterprise, were  as much enraged as if the spectacle had not been quite familiar to them:  they attacked the priest with fury, broke the"]]]
