[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2176"],[0,"Seven Discourses on Art (#5)"],[1," much greater portion of their time to that city than it has been hitherto  the custom to bestow.    In this art, as in others, there are many teachers who profess to show  the nearest way to excellence, and many expedients have been invented by  which the toil of study might be saved.  But let no man be seduced to  idleness by specious promises.  Excellence is never granted to man but as  the reward of labour.  It argues, indeed, no small strength of mind to  persevere in habits of industry, without the pleasure of perceiving those  advances; which, like the hand of a clock, whilst they make hourly  approaches to their point, yet proceed so slowly as to escape  observation.  A facility of drawing, like that of playing upon a musical  instrument, cannot be acquired but by an infinite number of acts.  I need  not, therefore, enforce by many words the necessity of continual  application; nor tell you that the port-crayon ought to be for ever in  your hands.  Various methods will occur to you by which this power may be  acquired.  I would particularly recommend that after your return from the  academy (where I suppose your attendance to be constant) you would  endeavour to draw the figure by memory.  I will even venture to add, that  by perseverance in this custom, you will become able to draw the human  figure tolerably correct, with as little effort of the mind as to trace  with a pen the letters of the alphabet.    That this facility is not unattainable, some members in this academy give  a sufficient proof.  And, be assured, that if this power is not acquired  whilst you are young, there will be no time for it afterwards: at least,  the attempt will be attended with as much difficulty as those experience  who learn to read or write after they have arrived to the age of  maturity.    But while I mention the port-crayon as the student's constant companion,  he must still remember that the pencil is the instrument by which he must  hope to obtain eminence.  What, therefore, I wish to impress upon you is,  that whenever an opportunity offers, you paint your studies instead of  drawing them.  This will give you such a facility in using colours, that  in time they will arrange themselves under the pencil, even without the  attention of the hand that conducts it.  If one act excluded the other,  this advice could not with any propriety be given.  But if painting  comprises both drawing and colouring and if by a short struggle of  resolute industry the same expedition is attainable in painting as in  drawing on paper, I cannot see what objection can justly be made to the  practice; or why that should be done by parts, which may be done  altogether.    If we turn our eyes to the several schools of painting, and consider  their respective excellences, we shall find that those who excel most in  colouring pursued this method.  The Venetian and Flemish schools, which  owe much of their fame to colouring, have enriched the cabinets of the  collectors of drawings with very few examples.  Those of Titian, Paul  Veronese, Tintoret, and the Bassans, are in general slight and  undetermined.  Their sketches on paper are as rude as their pictures are  excellent in regard to harmony of colouring.  Correggio and Barocci have  left few, if any, finished drawings behind them.  And in the Flemish  school, Rubens and Vandyke made their designs for the most part either in  colours or in chiaroscuro.  It is as common to find studies of the  Venetian and Flemish painters on canvas, as of the schools of Rome and  Florence on paper.  Not but that many finished drawings are sold under  the names of those masters.  Those, however, are undoubtedly the  productions either of engravers or of their scholars who copied their  works.    These instructions I have ventured to offer from my own experience; but  as they deviate widely from received opinions, I offer them with  diffidence; and when better are suggested, shall retract them without  regret.    There is one precept, however, in which I shall only be opposed by the  vain, the ignorant, and the idle.  I am not afraid that I shall repeat it  too often.  You must have no dependence on your own genius.  If you have  great talents, industry will improve them: if you have but moderate  abilities, industry will supply their deficiency.  Nothing is denied to  well-directed labour: nothing is to be obtained without it.  Not to enter  into metaphysical discussions on the nature or essence of genius, I will  venture to assert, that assiduity unabated by difficulty, and a  disposition eagerly directed to the object of its pursuit, will produce  effects similar to those which some call the result of natural powers.    Though a man cannot at all times, and in all places, paint or draw, yet  the mind can prepare itself by laying in proper materials, at all times,  and in all places.  Both Livy and Plutarch, in describing Philopoemen,  one of the ablest generals of antiquity, have given us a striking picture  of a mind always intent on its profession, and by assiduity obtaining  those excellences which some all their lives vainly expect from Nature.  I  shall quote the passage in Livy at length, as it runs parallel with the  practice I would recommend to the painter, sculptor, or architect.    \"Philopoemen was a man eminent for his sagacity and experience in  choosing ground, and in leading armies; to which he formed his mind by  perpetual meditation, in times of peace as well as war.  When, in any  occasional journey, he came to a straight difficult passage, if he was  alone, he considered with himself, and if he was in company he asked his  friends what it would be best to do if in this place they had found an  enemy, either in the front, or in the rear, on the one side, or on the  other.  'It might happen,' says he, 'that the enemy to be opposed might  come on drawn up in regular lines, or in a tumultuous body, formed only  by the nature of the place.'  He then considered a little what ground he  should take; what number of soldiers he should use, and what arms he  should give them; where he should lodge his carriages, his baggage, and  the defenceless followers of his camp; how many guards, and of what kind,  he should send to defend them; and whether it would be better to press  forward along the pass, or recover by retreat his former station: he  would consider likewise where his camp could most commodiously be formed;  how much ground he should enclose within his trenches; where he should  have the convenience of water; and where he might find plenty of wood and  forage; and when he should break up his camp on the following day,  through what road he could most safely pass, and in what form he should  dispose his troops.  With such thoughts and disquisitions he had from his  early years so exercised his mind, that on these occasions nothing could  happen which he had not been already accustomed to consider.\"    I cannot help imagining that I see a promising young painter, equally  vigilant, whether at home, or abroad in the streets, or in the fields.  Every object that presents itself is to him a lesson.  He regards all  nature with a view to his profession; and combines her beauties, or  corrects her defects.  He examines the countenance of men under the  influence of passion; and often catches the most pleasing hints from  subjects of turbulence or deformity.  Even bad pictures themselves supply  him with useful documents; and, as Leonardo da Vinci has observed, he  improves upon the fanciful images that are sometimes seen in the fire, or  are accidentally sketched upon a discoloured wall.    The artist who has his mind thus filled with ideas, and his hand made  expert by practice, works with ease and readiness; whilst he who would  have you believe that he is waiting for the inspirations of genius, is in  reality at a loss how to beam, and is at last delivered of his monsters  with difficulty and pain.    The well-grounded painter, on the contrary, has only maturely to consider  his subject, and all the mechanical parts of his art follow without his  exertion, Conscious of the difficulty of obtaining what he possesses he  makes no pretensions to secrets, except those of closer application.  Without conceiving the smallest jealousy against others, he is contented  that all shall be as great as himself who are willing to undergo the same  fatigue: and as his pre-eminence depends not upon a trick, he is free  from the painful suspicions of a juggler, who lives in perpetual fear  lest his trick should be discovered.        A DISCOURSE  Delivered to the Students of the Royal Academy on the Distribution of the  Prizes, December, 14, 1770, by the President.      Gentlemen,--It is not easy to speak with propriety to so many students of  different ages and different degrees of advancement.  The mind requires  nourishment adapted to its growth; and what may have promoted our earlier  efforts, might, retard us in our nearer approaches to perfection.    The first endeavours of a young painter, as I have remarked in a former  discourse, must be employed in the attainment of mechanical dexterity,  and confined to the mere imitation of the object before him.  Those who  have advanced beyond the rudiments, may, perhaps, find advantage in  reflecting on the advice which I have likewise given them, when I  recommended the diligent study of the works of our great predecessors;  but I at the same time endeavoured to guard them against an implicit  submission to the authority of any one master, however excellent; or by a  strict imitation of his manner, to preclude ourselves from the abundance  and variety of nature.  I will now add that nature herself is not to be  too closely copied.  There are excellences in the art of painting, beyond  what is commonly called the imitation of nature: and these excellences I  wish to point out.  The students who, having passed through the  initiatory exercises, are more"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21781"],[0,"Text Book of Biology, Part 1: Vertebrata (#5)"],[1,"discussion  of this question.      Section 32. The processes that occur in the remaining portions of  the alimentary canal are imperfectly understood. The caecum is so  large in the rabbit that it must almost certainly be of considerable  importance. In carnivorous animals it may be so much reduced as to  be practically absent. An important factor in the diet of the  herbivorous animals, and one absent from the food of the carnivora,  is that carbohydrate, the building material of all green-meat- [food],  cellulose, and there is some ground for thinking that the caecum is  probably a region of special fermentive action upon it. The pancreatic  juice, it may be noted, exercises a slight digestive activity upon this  substance.      Section 33. Water is most largely absorbed in the large intestine,  and in it the rejected (mainly insoluble) portion of the food gradually  acquires its dark colour and other faecal characteristics.        3. _The Circulation_    Section 34. The next thing to consider is the distribution of the food  material absorbed through the walls of the alimentary canal to the  living and active parts of the body. This is one of the functions of the  series of structures-- heart and blood-vessels, called the circulation,  circulatory system, or vascular system. It is not the only function.  The blood also carries the oxygen from the lungs to the various parts  where work is done and kataboly occurs, and it carries away the  katastases to the points where they are excreted-- the carbon  dioxide and some water to the lungs, water and urea to the kidneys,  sulphur compounds of some kind to the liver.      Section 35. The blood (Figure 4, Sheet 2) is not homogeneous;  under the low power of the microscope it may be seen to consist of--       (1.) a clear fluid, the plasma, in which float--       (2.) a few transparent colourless bodies of indefinite and changing     shape, and having a central brighter portion, the nucleus with a still     brighter dot therein the nucleolus-- the white corpuscles (w.c.), and       (3.) flat round discs, without a nucleus, the red corpuscles (r.c.),     greatly more numerous than the white.      Section 36. The chyle of the lacteals passes, as we have said, by  the thoracic duct directly into the circulation. It enters the left vena  cava superior (l.v.c.s.) near where this joins the jugular vein (ex.j.)  (see Figure 1, Sheet 2, th.d.) and goes on at once with the rest of  the blood to the heart. The small veins of the villi, however, which also  help suck up the soluble nutritive material, are not directly  continuous with the other body veins, the systemic veins; they  belong to a special system, and, running together into larger and  larger branches, form the lieno gastric (l.g.v.) and mesenteric (m.v.)  veins, which unite to form the portal vein (p.v.) which enters the liver  (l.v.) and there breaks up again into smaller and smaller branches.  The very finest ramifications of this spreading network are called the  (liver) capillaries, and these again unite to form at last the hepatic  vein (h.v.) which enters the vena cava inferior (v.c.i.), a median  vessel, running directly to the heart. This capillary network in the  liver is probably connected with changes requisite before the  recently absorbed materials can enter the general blood current.      Section 37. The student has probably already heard the terms vein  and artery employed. In the rabbit a vein is a vessel bringing blood  towards the heart, while an artery is a vessel conducting it away.  Veins are thin-walled, and therefore flabby, a conspicuous purple  when full of blood, and when empty through bleeding and collapsed  sometimes difficult to make out in dissection. They are formed by  the union of lesser factors. The portal breaks up into lesser branches  within the liver. Arteries have thick muscular and elastic walls, thick  enough to prevent the blood showing through, and are therefore pale  pink or white and keep their round shape.      Section 38. The heart of the rabbit is divided by partitions into four  chambers: two upper thin-walled ones, the auricles (au.), and two  lower ones, both, and especially the left, with very muscular walls,  the ventricles (vn.). The right ventricle (r.vn.) and auricle (r.au.)  communicate, and the left ventricle (l.vn.) and auricle (l.au.).      Section 39. The blood coming from all parts of the body, partly  robbed of its oxygen and containing much carbon dioxide and other  katastases, enters the right auricle of the heart through three great  veins, the median vena cava inferior from the posterior parts of the  body, and the paired venae cavae superiores from the anterior. With  the beating of the heart, described below, it is forced into the right  ventricle and from there through the pulmonary artery (p.a.) seen in  the figure passing under the loop of the aorta (ao.) to the lungs.      Section 40. The lungs (lg. Figure 1, Sheet 1) are moulded to the  shape of the thoracic cavity and heart; they communicate with the  pharynx by the trachea (tr. in Figure 1, Sheet 1) or windpipe, and  are made up of a tissue of continually branching and diminishing  air-tubes, which end at last in small air-sacs, the alveoli. The  final branches of the pulmonary arteries, the lung capillaries, lie  in the walls of these air-sacs, and are separated from the air by an  extremely thin membrane through which the oxygen diffuses into,  and the carbon dioxide escapes from, the blood.      Section 41. The mechanism of respiration will be understood by  reference to Figure 3, Sheet 2. It will be noted, in dissecting that the  lungs have shrunk away from the walls of the thorax; this  collapse occurs directly an aperture is made in the thorax wall, and  is in part due to their extreme elasticity. In life the cavity of the  thorax forms an air-tight box, between which and the lungs is a  slight space, the pleural cavity (pl.c.) lined by a moist membrane,  which is also reflected, over the lungs. The thorax wall is muscular  and bony, and resists the atmospheric pressure on its outer side, so  that the lungs before this is cut through are kept distended to the  size of the thoracic cavity by the pressure of the air within them. In  inspiration (or breathing-in) the ribs are raised by the external  intercostal (Anglice, between-ribs, e.i.c.m.) and other allied  muscles, and the diaphragm (dia.) contracts and becomes flatter;  the air is consequently sucked, in as the lungs follow the movement  of the thorax wall. In expiration the intercostals and diaphragm relax  and allow the elastic recoil of the lungs to come into play. The  thoracic wall is simultaneously depressed by the muscles of the  abdominal area, the diaphragm thrust forwards, as the result of the  displacement and compression of the alimentary viscera thus  brought about. (r.r.r. in the Figure mark ribs.)      Section 42. The oxygen and carbon dioxide are not carried in  exactly the same way by the blood. The student will know from his  chemical reading that neither of these gases is very soluble, but  carbon dioxide is sufficiently so in an alkaline fluid to be conveyed  by the liquid plasma. The oxygen however, needs a special portative  mechanism in the colouring matter of the red corpuscles, the  haemoglobin, with which it combines weakly to form  oxy-haemoglobin of a bright red colour, and decomposing easily in  the capillaries (the finest vessels between the arteries and veins), to  release the oxygen again. The same compound occurs in all true  vertebrata, and in the blood-fluid of the worm; in the crayfish a similar  substance, haemocyanin, which when oxygenated is blue, and when  deoxydized colourless, discharges the same function.      Section 43. The blood returns from the lungs to the left auricle (l.au.)  by the pulmonary veins, hidden in the Figure by the heart, passes  thence to the thick-walled left ventricle (l.vn.), and on into the aorta  (ao.).      Section 44. The beating of the heart is, of course, a succession of  contractions and expansions of its muscular wall. The contraction,  or systole, commences at the base of the venae cavae and passes  to the auricles, driving the blood before it into the ventricles, which  then contract sharply and drive it on into the aorta or pulmonary  artery; a pause and then a dilatation, the diastole follows. The flow of  the blood is determined in one direction by the various valves of the  heart. No valves occur in the opening of the superior cavae but an  imperfect one, the Eustachian valve, protects the inferior cava; the  direction of the heart's contraction prevents any excessive back-flow  into the veins, and the onward, tendency is encouraged by the suck  of the diastole of the ventricles. Between the left ventricle and auricle  is a valve made up of two flaps of skin, the mitral valve, the edges of  the flaps being connected with the walls of the ventricle through the  intermediation of small muscular threads, the chordae tendinae,  which stretch across its cavity to little muscular pillars, the papillary  muscles; these attachments prevent the mitral valve from flapping  back into the auricle, and as the blood flows into and accumulates in  the ventricle it gets behind the flaps of the valve and presses its  edges together. When the systole of the ventricle occurs, the  increased, tension of the blood only closes the aperture the tighter,  and the current passes on into the aorta, where we find three  watch-pocket valves, with the pocket turned away from the heart,  which are also closed and tightened by any attempt at regurgitation  (back-flow). A similar process occurs on the right side of the heart,  but here, instead of a mitral valve of two flaps between auricle and  ventricle, we have a tricuspid valve with three. The thickness of the  muscular walls, in view of the lesser distance through which it has to  force the blood, -are- [is] less for the"]]]
