Those who had once uncovered the cathedrals never wished to cover them  again; and being thus made useless, they were, first neglected, and  perhaps, as the stone was wanted, afterwards demolished.    Elgin seems a place of little trade, and thinly inhabited.  The episcopal  cities of Scotland, I believe, generally fell with their churches, though  some of them have since recovered by a situation convenient for commerce.  Thus Glasgow, though it has no longer an archbishop, has risen beyond its  original state by the opulence of its traders; and Aberdeen, though its  ancient stock had decayed, flourishes by a new shoot in another place.    In the chief street of Elgin, the houses jut over the lowest story, like  the old buildings of timber in London, but with greater prominence; so  that there is sometimes a walk for a considerable length under a  cloister, or portico, which is now indeed frequently broken, because the  new houses have another form, but seems to have been uniformly continued  in the old city.          FORES.  CALDER.  FORT GEORGE      We went forwards the same day to Fores, the town to which Macbeth was  travelling, when he met the weird sisters in his way.  This to an  Englishman is classic ground.  Our imaginations were heated, and our  thoughts recalled to their old amusements.    We had now a prelude to the Highlands.  We began to leave fertility and  culture behind us, and saw for a great length of road nothing but heath;  yet at Fochabars, a seat belonging to the duke of Gordon, there is an  orchard, which in Scotland I had never seen before, with some timber  trees, and a plantation of oaks.    At Fores we found good accommodation, but nothing worthy of particular  remark, and next morning entered upon the road, on which Macbeth heard  the fatal prediction; but we travelled on not interrupted by promises of  kingdoms, and came to Nairn, a royal burgh, which, if once it flourished,  is now in a state of miserable decay; but I know not whether its chief  annual magistrate has not still the title of Lord Provost.    At Nairn we may fix the verge of the Highlands; for here I first saw peat  fires, and first heard the Erse language.  We had no motive to stay  longer than to breakfast, and went forward to the house of Mr. Macaulay,  the minister who published an account of St. Kilda, and by his direction  visited Calder Castle, from which Macbeth drew his second title.  It has  been formerly a place of strength.  The drawbridge is still to be seen,  but the moat is now dry.  The tower is very ancient: Its walls are of  great thickness, arched on the top with stone, and surrounded with  battlements.  The rest of the house is later, though far from modern.    We were favoured by a gentleman, who lives in the castle, with a letter  to one of the officers at Fort George, which being the most regular  fortification in the island, well deserves the notice of a traveller, who  has never travelled before.  We went thither next day, found a very kind  reception, were led round the works by a gentleman, who explained the use  of every part, and entertained by Sir Eyre Coote, the governour, with  such elegance of conversation as left us no attention to the delicacies  of his table.    Of Fort George I shall not attempt to give any account.  I cannot  delineate it scientifically, and a loose and popular description is of  use only when the imagination is to be amused.  There was every where an  appearance of the utmost neatness and regularity.  But my suffrage is of  little value, because this and Fort Augustus are the only garrisons that  I ever saw.    We did not regret the time spent at the fort, though in consequence of  our delay we came somewhat late to Inverness, the town which may properly  be called the capital of the Highlands.  Hither the inhabitants of the  inland parts come to be supplied with what they cannot make for  themselves: Hither the young nymphs of the mountains and valleys are sent  for education, and as far as my observation has reached, are not sent in  vain.          INVERNESS      Inverness was the last place which had a regular communication by high  roads with the southern counties.  All the ways beyond it have, I  believe, been made by the soldiers in this century.  At Inverness  therefore Cromwell, when he subdued Scotland, stationed a garrison, as at  the boundary of the Highlands.  The soldiers seem to have incorporated  afterwards with the inhabitants, and to have peopled the place with an  English race; for the language of this town has been long considered as  peculiarly elegant.    Here is a castle, called the castle of Macbeth, the walls of which are  yet standing.  It was no very capacious edifice, but stands upon a rock  so high and steep, that I think it was once not accessible, but by the  help of ladders, or a bridge.  Over against it, on another hill, was a  fort built by Cromwell, now totally demolished; for no faction of  Scotland loved the name of Cromwell, or had any desire to continue his  memory.    Yet what the Romans did to other nations, was in a great degree done by  Cromwell to the Scots; he civilized them by conquest, and introduced by  useful violence the arts of peace.  I was told at Aberdeen that the  people learned from Cromwell's soldiers to make shoes and to plant kail.    How they lived without kail, it is not easy to guess: They cultivate  hardly any other plant for common tables, and when they had not kail they  probably had nothing.  The numbers that go barefoot are still sufficient  to shew that shoes may be spared: They are not yet considered as  necessaries of life; for tall boys, not otherwise meanly dressed, run  without them in the streets; and in the islands the sons of gentlemen  pass several of their first years with naked feet.    I know not whether it be not peculiar to the Scots to have attained the  liberal, without the manual arts, to have excelled in ornamental  knowledge, and to have wanted not only the elegancies, but the  conveniences of common life.  Literature soon after its revival found its  way to Scotland, and from the middle of the sixteenth century, almost to  the middle of the seventeenth, the politer studies were very diligently  pursued.  The Latin poetry of _Deliciae Poetarum Scotorum_ would have  done honour to any nation, at least till the publication of _May's  Supplement_ the English had very little to oppose.    Yet men thus ingenious and inquisitive were content to live in total  ignorance of the trades by which human wants are supplied, and to supply  them by the grossest means.  Till the Union made them acquainted with  English manners, the culture of their lands was unskilful, and their  domestick life unformed; their tables were coarse as the feasts of  Eskimeaux, and their houses filthy as the cottages of Hottentots.    Since they have known that their condition was capable of improvement,  their progress in useful knowledge has been rapid and uniform.  What  remains to be done they will quickly do, and then wonder, like me, why  that which was so necessary and so easy was so long delayed.  But they  must be for ever content to owe to the English that elegance and culture,  which, if they had been vigilant and active, perhaps the English might  have owed to them.    Here the appearance of life began to alter.  I had seen a few women with  plaids at Aberdeen; but at Inverness the Highland manners are common.  There is I think a kirk, in which only the Erse language is used.  There  is likewise an English chapel, but meanly built, where on Sunday we saw a  very decent congregation.    We were now to bid farewel to the luxury of travelling, and to enter a  country upon which perhaps no wheel has ever rolled.  We could indeed  have used our post-chaise one day longer, along the military road to Fort  Augustus, but we could have hired no horses beyond Inverness, and we were  not so sparing of ourselves, as to lead them, merely that we might have  one day longer the indulgence of a carriage.    At Inverness therefore we procured three horses for ourselves and a  servant, and one more for our baggage, which was no very heavy load.  We  found in the course of our journey the convenience of having  disencumbered ourselves, by laying aside whatever we could spare; for it  is not to be imagined without experience, how in climbing crags, and  treading bogs, and winding through narrow and obstructed passages, a  little bulk will hinder, and a little weight will burthen; or how often a  man that has pleased himself at home with his own resolution, will, in  the hour of darkness and fatigue, be content to leave behind him every  thing but himself.          LOUGH NESS      We took two Highlanders to run beside us, partly to shew us the way, and  partly to take back from the sea-side the horses, of which they were the  owners.  One of them was a man of great liveliness and activity, of whom  his companion said, that he would tire any horse in Inverness.  Both of  them were civil and ready-handed.  Civility seems part of the national  character of Highlanders.  Every chieftain is a monarch, and politeness,  the natural product of royal government, is diffused from the laird  through the whole clan.  But they are not commonly dexterous: their  narrowness of life confines them to a few operations, and they are  accustomed to endure little wants more than to remove them.    We mounted our steeds on the thirtieth of August, and directed our guides  to conduct us to Fort Augustus.  It is built at the head of Lough Ness,  of which Inverness stands at the outlet.  The way between them has been  cut by the soldiers, and the greater part of it runs along a rock,  levelled with great labour and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20656"],[0,"Old Christmas: from the Sketch Book of Washington Irving (#5)"],[1," wound through a noble avenue of trees, among the naked  branches of which the moon glittered as she rolled through the deep  vault of a cloudless sky. The lawn beyond was sheeted with a slight  covering of snow, which here and there sparkled as the moonbeams caught  a frosty crystal; and at a distance might be seen a thin transparent  vapour, stealing up from the low grounds, and threatening gradually to  shroud the landscape.    My companion looked round him with transport:--\"How often,\" said he,  \"have I scampered up this avenue, on returning home on school  vacations! How often have I played under these trees when a boy! I feel  a degree of filial reverence for them, as we look up to those who have  cherished us in childhood. My father was always scrupulous in exacting  our holidays, and having us around him on family festivals. He used to  direct and superintend our games with the strictness that some parents  do the studies of their children. He was very particular that we should  play the old English games according to their original form; and  consulted old books for precedent and authority for every 'merrie  disport;' yet I assure you there never was pedantry so delightful. It  was the policy of the good old gentleman to make his children feel that  home was the happiest place in the world; and I value this delicious  home-feeling as one of the choicest gifts a parent can bestow.\"    [Illustration]    We were interrupted by the clangour of a troop of dogs of all sorts and  sizes, \"mongrel, puppy, whelp and hound, and curs of low degree,\" that,  disturbed by the ringing of the porter's bell, and the rattling of the  chaise, came bounding, open-mouthed, across the lawn.                      ----\"The little dogs and all,            Tray, Blanch, and Sweetheart--see they bark at me!\"    cried Bracebridge, laughing. At the sound of his voice the bark was  changed into a yelp of delight, and in a moment he was surrounded and  almost overpowered by the caresses of the faithful animals.    We had now come in full view of the old family mansion, partly thrown in  deep shadow, and partly lit up by the cold moonshine. It was an  irregular building of some magnitude, and seemed to be of the  architecture of different periods. One wing was evidently very ancient,  with heavy stone-shafted bow windows jutting out and overrun with ivy,  from among the foliage of which the small diamond-shaped panes of glass  glittered with the moonbeams. The rest of the house was in the French  taste of Charles the Second's time, having been repaired and altered, as  my friend told me, by one of his ancestors, who returned with that  monarch at the Restoration. The grounds about the house were laid out in  the old formal manner of artificial flower-beds, clipped shrubberies,  raised terraces, and heavy stone balustrades, ornamented with urns, a  leaden statue or two, and a jet of water. The old gentleman, I was told,  was extremely careful to preserve this obsolete finery in all its  original state. He admired this fashion in gardening; it had an air of  magnificence, was courtly and noble, and befitting good old family  style. The boasted imitation of nature in modern gardening had sprung up  with modern republican notions, but did not suit a monarchical  government; it smacked of the levelling system.--I could not help  smiling at this introduction of politics into gardening, though I  expressed some apprehension that I should find the old gentleman rather  intolerant in his creed.--Frank assured me, however, that it was almost  the only instance in which he had ever heard his father meddle with  politics; and he believed that he had got this notion from a member of  parliament who once passed a few weeks with him. The Squire was glad of  any argument to defend his clipped yew-trees and formal terraces, which  had been occasionally attacked by modern landscape-gardeners.    [Illustration]    As we approached the house, we heard the sound of music, and now and  then a burst of laughter from one end of the building. This, Bracebridge  said, must proceed from the servants' hall, where a great deal of  revelry was permitted, and even encouraged, by the Squire throughout the  twelve days of Christmas, provided everything was done conformably to  ancient usage. Here were kept up the old games of hoodman blind, shoe  the wild mare, hot cockles, steal the white loaf, bob apple, and  snapdragon: the Yule log and Christmas candle were regularly burnt, and  the mistletoe, with its white berries, hung up, to the imminent peril of  all the pretty housemaids.[C]    [Illustration]    So intent were the servants upon their sports, that we had to ring  repeatedly before we could make ourselves heard. On our arrival being  announced, the Squire came out to receive us, accompanied by his two  other sons; one a young officer in the army, home on leave of absence;  the other an Oxonian, just from the university. The Squire was a fine,  healthy-looking old gentleman, with silver hair curling lightly round an  open florid countenance; in which a physiognomist, with the advantage,  like myself, of a previous hint or two, might discover a singular  mixture of whim and benevolence.    [Illustration: \"The company, which was assembled in a large  old-fashioned hall.\"--PAGE 54.]    The family meeting was warm and affectionate; as the evening was far  advanced, the Squire would not permit us to change our travelling  dresses, but ushered us at once to the company, which was assembled in a  large old-fashioned hall. It was composed of different branches of a  numerous family connection, where there were the usual proportion of old  uncles and aunts, comfortably married dames, superannuated spinsters,  blooming country cousins, half-fledged striplings, and bright-eyed  boarding-school hoydens. They were variously occupied; some at a  round game of cards; others conversing around the fireplace; at one end  of the hall was a group of the young folks, some nearly grown up, others  of a more tender and budding age, fully engrossed by a merry game; and a  profusion of wooden horses, penny trumpets, and tattered dolls, about  the floor, showed traces of a troop of little fairy beings, who having  frolicked through a happy day, had been carried off to slumber through a  peaceful night.    [Illustration]    While the mutual greetings were going on between Bracebridge and his  relatives, I had time to scan the apartment. I have called it a hall,  for so it had certainly been in old times, and the Squire had evidently  endeavoured to restore it to something of its primitive state. Over the  heavy projecting fireplace was suspended a picture of a warrior in  armour, standing by a white horse, and on the opposite wall hung helmet,  buckler, and lance. At one end an enormous pair of antlers were inserted  in the wall, the branches serving as hooks on which to suspend hats,  whips, and spurs; and in the corners of the apartment were  fowling-pieces, fishing-rods, and other sporting implements. The  furniture was of the cumbrous workmanship of former days, though some  articles of modern convenience had been added, and the oaken floor had  been carpeted; so that the whole presented an odd mixture of parlour and  hall.    [Illustration]    The grate had been removed from the wide overwhelming fireplace, to  make way for a fire of wood, in the midst of which was an enormous log  glowing and blazing, and sending forth a vast volume of light and heat;  this I understood was the Yule-log, which the Squire was particular in  having brought in and illumined on a Christmas eve, according to ancient  custom.[D]    [Illustration]    It was really delightful to see the old Squire seated in his hereditary  elbow-chair by the hospitable fireside of his ancestors, and looking  around him like the sun of a system, beaming warmth and gladness to  every heart. Even the very dog that lay stretched at his feet, as he  lazily shifted his position and yawned, would look fondly up in his  master's face, wag his tail against the floor, and stretch himself again  to sleep, confident of kindness and protection. There is an emanation  from the heart in genuine hospitality which cannot be described, but is  immediately felt, and puts the stranger at once at his ease. I had not  been seated many minutes by the comfortable hearth of the worthy  cavalier before I found myself as much at home as if I had been one of  the family.    [Illustration]    Supper was announced shortly after our arrival. It was served up in a  spacious oaken chamber, the panels of which shone with wax, and around  which were several family portraits decorated with holly and ivy. Beside  the accustomed lights, two great wax tapers, called Christmas candles,  wreathed with greens, were placed on a highly-polished buffet among the  family plate. The table was abundantly spread with substantial fare; but  the Squire made his supper of frumenty, a dish made of wheat cakes  boiled in milk with rich spices, being a standing dish in old times for  Christmas eve. I was happy to find my old friend, minced-pie, in the  retinue of the feast; and finding him to be perfectly orthodox, and that  I need not be ashamed of my predilection, I greeted him with all the  warmth wherewith we usually greet an old and very genteel acquaintance.    [Illustration]    The mirth of the company was greatly promoted by the humours of an  eccentric personage whom Mr. Bracebridge always addressed with the  quaint appellation of Master Simon. He was a tight, brisk little man,  with the air of an arrant old bachelor. His nose was shaped like the  bill of a parrot; his face slightly pitted with the small-pox, with a  dry perpetual bloom on it, like a frost-bitten leaf in autumn. He had an  eye of great quickness and vivacity, with a drollery and lurking waggery  of expression that was irresistible. He was evidently the wit of the  family, dealing very much in sly"]]]
