But he was as intent upon what Sssuri had to tell as he was on his  occupation of the moment.    \"But that is not even a hopper rumor,\" he was protesting, breaking  into his companion's flow of thought.    \"No. But, remember, to the runners yesterday is very far away. One  night is like another; they do not reckon time as we do, nor lay up  memories for future guidance. They left their native hunting grounds  and are drifting south. And only a very great peril would lead the  runners into such a break. It is against all their instincts!\"    \"So, long ago--which may be months, weeks, or just days--there came  death out of the sea, and those who lived past its coming fled--\"  Dalgard repeated the scanty information Sssuri had won for them the  night before by patient hour-long coaxing. \"What kind of death?\"    Sssuri's great eyes, somber and a little tired, met his. \"To us there  is only one kind of death to be greatly feared.\"    \"But there are the snake-devils--\" protested the colony scout.    \"To be hunted down by snake-devils is death, yes. But it is a quick  death, a death which can come to any living thing that is not swift or  wary enough. For to the snake-devils all things that live and move are  merely meat to fill the aching pit in their swollen bellies. But there  were in the old days other deaths, far worse than what one meets under  a snake-devil's claws and fangs. And those are the deaths we fear.\" He  was running the smooth haft of his spear back and forth through his  fingers as if testing the balance of the weapon because the time was  not far away when he must rely upon it.    \"Those Others!\" Dalgard shaped the words with his lips as well as in  his mind.    \"Just so.\" Sssuri did not nod, but his thought was in complete  agreement.    \"Yet they have not come before--not since the ship of my fathers  landed here,\" Dalgard protested, not against Sssuri's judgment but  against the whole idea.    The merman got to his feet, sweeping his arm to indicate not only the  cove where they now sheltered but the continent behind it.    \"Once they held all this. Then they warred and killed, until but a  handful lay in cover to lick their wounds and wait. It has been many  threes of seasons since they left that cover. But now they come  again--to loot their place of secrets--Perhaps in the time past they  have forgotten much so that now they must renew their knowledge.\"    Dalgard stowed the bow in the bottom of the outrigger. \"I think we had  better go and see,\" he commented, \"so that we may report true tidings  to our Elders--something more than rumors learned from night runners.\"    \"That is so.\"    They paddled out to sea and turned the prow of the light craft north.  The character of the land did not change. Cliffs still walled the  coast, in some places rising sheer from the water, in others broken by  a footing of coarse beach. Only flying things were to be sighted over  their rocky crowns.    But by midday there was an abrupt alteration in the scene. A wide  river cut through the heights and gave birth to a fan-shaped delta  thickly covered with vegetation. Half hidden by the riot of growing  things was a building of the dome shape Dalgard knew so well. Its  windowless, doorless surface reflected the sunlight with a glassy  sheen, and to casual inspection it was as untouched as it had been on  the day its masters had either died within it or left it for the last  time, perhaps centuries before.    \"This is one way into the forbidden city,\" Sssuri announced. \"Once  they stationed guards here.\"    Dalgard had been about to suggest a closer inspection of the dome but  that remark made him hesitate. If it had been one of the  fortifications rimming in a forbidden ground, there was more than an  even chance that unwary invaders, even this long after, might stumble  into some trap still working automatically.    \"Do we go upriver?\" He left it to Sssuri, who had the traditions of  his people to guide him, to make the decision.    The merman looked at the dome; it was evident from his attitude that  he had no wish to examine it more closely. \"They had machines which  fought for them, and sometimes those machines still fight. This river  is the natural entrance for an enemy. Therefore it would have been  well defended.\"    Under the sun the green reach of the delta had a most peaceful  appearance. There was a family of duck-dogs fishing from the beach,  scooping their broad bills into the mud to locate water worms. And  moth birds danced in the air currents overhead. Yet Dalgard was ready  to agree with his companion--beware the easy way. They dipped their  paddles deep and cut across the river current toward the cliffs to the  north.    Two days of steady coastwise traveling brought them to a great bay.  And Dalgard gasped as the full sight of the port confronting them  burst into view.    Tiers of ledges had been cut and blasted in the native rock, extending  from the sea back into the land in a series of giant steps. Each of  them was covered with buildings, and here the ancient war had left its  mark. The rock itself had been brought to a bubbling boil and sent in  now-frozen rivers down that stairway in a half-dozen places,  overwhelming all structures in its path, and leaving crystallized  streams to reflect the sun blindingly.    \"So this is your secret city!\"    But Sssuri shook his round head. \"This is but the sea entrance to the  country,\" he corrected. \"Here struck the day of fire, and we need not  fear the machines which doubtless lie in wait elsewhere.\"    They beached the outrigger and hid it in the shell of one of the  ruined buildings on the lowest level. Dalgard sent out a questing  thought, hoping to contact a hopper or even a duck-dog. But seemingly  the ruins were bare of animal life, as was true in most of the other  towns and cities he had explored in the past. The fauna of Astra was  shy of any holding built by Those Others, no matter how long it may  have been left to the wind, and cleansing rain.    With difficulty and detours to avoid the rivers of once-molten rock,  they made their way slowly from ledge to ledge up that giant's  staircase, not stopping to explore any of the buildings as they  passed. There was a taint of alien age about the city which repelled  Dalgard, and he was eager to get out of it into the clean countryside  once more. Sssuri sped on silent feet, his shoulders hunched, his  distaste for the structures to be read in every line of his supple  body.    When they reached the top, Dalgard turned to gaze down to the restless  sea. What a prospect! Perhaps Those Others had built thus for reasons  of defense, but surely they, too, must have paused now and then to be  proud of such a feat. It was the most impressive site he had yet seen,  and his report of it would be a worthy addition to the Homeport  records.    A road ran straight from the top of the stair, stabbing inland without  taking any notice of the difficulties of the terrain, after the usual  arrogant manner of the alien engineers. But Sssuri did not follow it.  Instead he struck off to the left, avoiding that easy path, choosing  to cross through tangles which had once been gardens or through open  fields.    They were well out of the sight of the city before they flushed their  first hopper, a full-grown adult with oddly pale fur. Instead of  displaying the usual fearless interest in strangers, the animal took  one swift look at them and fled as if a snake-devil had snorted at its  thumping heels. And Dalgard received a sharp impression of terror, as  if the hopper saw in him some frightening menace.    \"What--?\" Honestly astounded, he looked to Sssuri for enlightenment.    The hoppers could be pests. They stole any small bright object which  aroused their interest. But they could also be persuaded to trade, and  they usually had no fear of either colonist or merman.    Sssuri's furred face might not convey much emotion, but by all the  signs Dalgard _could_ read he knew that the merman was as startled as  he by the strange behavior of the grass dweller.    \"He is afraid of those who walk erect as we do,\" he made answer.    _Those who walk erect_--Dalgard was quick to interpret that.    He knew that Those Others were biped, quasi-human in form, closer in  physical appearance to the colonists than to the mermen. And since  none of Dalgard's people had penetrated this far to the north, nor had  the mermen invaded this taboo territory until Sssuri had agreed to  come, that left only the aliens. Those strange people whom the  colonists feared without knowing why they feared them, whom the mermen  hated with a hatred which had not lessened with the years of freedom.  The faint rumor carried by the migrating runners must be true, for  here was a hopper afraid of bipeds. And it must have been recently  provided with a reason for such fear, since hoppers' memories were  very short and such terror would have faded from its mind in a matter  of weeks.    Sssuri halted in a patch of grass which reached to his waist belt. \"It  is best to wait until the hours of dark.\"    But Dalgard could not agree. \"Better for you with your night sight,\"  he objected, \"but I do not have your eyes in my head.\"    Sssuri had to admit the justice of that. He could travel under the  moonless sky as sure-footed as under broad sunlight. But to guide a  blundering Dalgard through unknown country was not practical. However,  they could take to cover and that they did as speedily as possible,  using a zigzag tactic which delayed their advance but took them from  one bit of protecting brush or grove of trees to the next, keeping to  the fields well away from the road.    They camped that night without fire in a pocket near a spring. And  while Dalgard was alert to all about them, he knew that Sssuri was  mind questing in a far wider circle, trying to contact a hopper, a  runner,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18464"],[0,"The Wit and Humor of America, Volume I. (of X.) (#5)"],[1,"obtruded a painful coincidence upon my  mind. I leave the psychological reader to determine the exact  co-relation between the circumstance and the sickening sense of loss  that overcame me on witnessing it. I reached my room--the bananas were  gone.    There was but one that knew of their existence, but one who frequented  my window, but one capable of gymnastic effort to procure them, and that  was--I blush to say it--Melons. Melons the depredator--Melons, despoiled  by larger boys of his ill-gotten booty, or reckless and indiscreetly  liberal; Melons--now a fugitive on some neighborhood house-top. I lit a  cigar, and, drawing my chair to the window, sought surcease of sorrow in  the contemplation of the fish-geranium. In a few moments something white  passed my window at about the level of the edge. There was no mistaking  that hoary head, which now represented to me only aged iniquity. It was  Melons, that venerable, juvenile hypocrite.    He affected not to observe me, and would have withdrawn quietly, but  that horrible fascination which causes the murderer to revisit the scene  of his crime, impelled him toward my window. I smoked calmly, and gazed  at him without speaking. He walked several times up and down the court  with a half-rigid, half-belligerent expression of eye and shoulder,  intended to represent the carelessness of innocence.    Once or twice he stopped, and putting his arms their whole length into  his capacious trousers, gazed with some interest at the additional width  they thus acquired. Then he whistled. The singular conflicting  conditions of John Brown's body and soul were at that time beginning to  attract the attention of youth, and Melons's performance of that melody  was always remarkable. But to-day he whistled falsely and shrilly  between his teeth. At last he met my eye. He winced slightly, but  recovered himself, and going to the fence, stood for a few moments on  his hands, with his bare feet quivering in the air. Then he turned  toward me and threw out a conversational preliminary.    \"They is a cirkis\"--said Melons gravely, hanging with his back to the  fence and his arms twisted around the palings--\"a cirkis over  yonder!\"--indicating the locality with his foot--\"with hosses, and  hossback riders. They is a man wot rides six hosses to onct--six hosses  to onct--and nary saddle\"--and he paused in expectation.    Even this equestrian novelty did not affect me. I still kept a fixed  gaze on Melons's eye, and he began to tremble and visibly shrink in his  capacious garment. Some other desperate means--conversation with Melons  was always a desperate means--must be resorted to. He recommenced more  artfully.    \"Do you know Carrots?\"    I had a faint remembrance of a boy of that euphonious name, with scarlet  hair, who was a playmate and persecutor of Melons. But I said nothing.    \"Carrots is a bad boy. Killed a policeman onct. Wears a dirk knife in  his boots, saw him to-day looking in your windy.\"    I felt that this must end here. I rose sternly and addressed Melons.    \"Melons, this is all irrelevant and impertinent to the case. _You_ took  those bananas. Your proposition regarding Carrots, even if I were  inclined to accept it as credible information, does not alter the  material issue. You took those bananas. The offense under the Statutes  of California is felony. How far Carrots may have been accessory to the  fact either before or after, is not my intention at present to discuss.  The act is complete. Your present conduct shows the _animo furandi_ to  have been equally clear.\"    By the time I had finished this exordium, Melons had disappeared, as I  fully expected.    He never reappeared. The remorse that I have experienced for the part I  had taken in what I fear may have resulted in his utter and complete  extermination, alas, he may not know, except through these pages. For I  have never seen him since. Whether he ran away and went to sea to  reappear at some future day as the most ancient of mariners, or whether  he buried himself completely in his trousers, I never shall know. I have  read the papers anxiously for accounts of him. I have gone to the Police  Office in the vain attempt of identifying him as a lost child. But I  never saw him or heard of him since. Strange fears have sometimes  crossed my mind that his venerable appearance may have been actually the  result of senility, and that he may have been gathered peacefully to his  fathers in a green old age. I have even had doubts of his existence, and  have sometimes thought that he was providentially and mysteriously  offered to fill the void I have before alluded to. In that hope I have  written these pages.          THE DEACON'S MASTERPIECE    OR, THE WONDERFUL \"ONE-HOSS SHAY\"    _A Logical Story_    BY OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES          Have you heard of the wonderful one-hoss shay,      That was built in such a logical way      It ran a hundred years to a day,      And then, of a sudden, it--ah, but stay,      I'll tell you what happened without delay,      Scaring the parson into fits,      Frightening people out of their wits,--      Have you ever heard of that, I say?        Seventeen hundred and fifty-five.      _Georgius Secundus_ was then alive,--      Snuffy old drone from the German hive.      That was the year when Lisbon-town      Saw the earth open and gulp her down,      And Braddock's army was done so brown,      Left without a scalp to its crown.      It was on the terrible Earthquake-day      That the Deacon finished the one-hoss shay.        Now in building of chaises, I tell you what,      There is always _somewhere_ a weakest spot,--      In hub, tire, felloe, in spring or thill,      In panel, or crossbar, or floor, or sill,      In screw, bolt, thoroughbrace,--lurking still,      Find it somewhere you must and will,--      Above or below, or within or without,--      And that's the reason, beyond a doubt,      That a chaise _breaks down_, but doesn't _wear out_.        But the Deacon swore, (as Deacons do,      With an \"I dew vum,\" or an \"I tell _yeou_,\")      He would build one shay to beat the taown      'N' the keounty 'n' all the kentry raoun';      It should be so built that it _couldn'_ break daown:      --\"Fur,\" said the Deacon, \"'t's mighty plain      Thut the weakes' place mus' stan' the strain;      'N' the way t' fix it, uz I maintain,                    Is only jest      T' make that place uz strong uz the rest.\"        So the Deacon inquired of the village folk      Where he could find the strongest oak,      That couldn't be split nor bent nor broke,--      That was for spokes and floor and sills;      He sent for lancewood to make the thills;      The crossbars were ash, from the straightest trees,      The panels of whitewood, that cuts like cheese,      But lasts like iron for things like these;      The hubs of logs from the \"Settler's ellum,\"--      Last of its timber,--they couldn't sell 'em,      Never an axe had seen their chips,      And the wedges flew from between their lips,      Their blunt ends frizzled like celery-tips;      Step and prop-iron, bolt and screw,      Spring, tire, axle, and linchpin too,      Steel of the finest, bright and blue;      Thoroughbrace bison-skin, thick and wide;      Boot, top, dasher, from tough old hide      Found in the pit when the tanner died.      That was the way he \"put her through.\"--      \"There!\" said the Deacon, \"naow she'll dew!\"        Do! I tell you, I rather guess      She was a wonder, and nothing less!      Colts grew horses, beards turned gray,      Deacon and deaconess dropped away,      Children and grandchildren--where were they?      But there stood the stout old one-hoss shay      As fresh as on Lisbon-earthquake-day!        EIGHTEEN HUNDRED;--It came and found      The Deacon's masterpiece strong and sound.      Eighteen hundred increased by ten;--      \"Hahnsum kerridge\" they called it then.      Eighteen hundred and twenty came;--      Running as usual; much the same.      Thirty and forty at last arrive,      And then come fifty, and FIFTY-FIVE.        Little of all we value here      Wakes on the morn of its hundredth year      Without both feeling and looking queer.      In fact, there's nothing that keeps its youth,      So far as I know, but a tree and truth.      (This is a moral that runs at large;      Take it.--You're welcome.--No extra charge.)        FIRST OF NOVEMBER,--The Earthquake-day--      There are traces of age in the one-hoss shay,      A general flavor of mild decay,      But nothing local, as one may say.      There couldn't be,--for the Deacon's art      Had made it so like in every part      That there wasn't a chance for one to start.      For the wheels were just as strong as the thills,      And the floor was just as strong as the sills,      And the panels just as strong as the floor,      And the whipple-tree neither less nor more,      And the back-crossbar as strong as the fore,      And the spring and axle and hub _encore_.      And yet, as a _whole_, it is past a doubt      In another hour it will be _worn out_!        First of November, 'Fifty-five!      This morning the parson takes a drive.      Now, small boys, get out of the way!      Here comes the wonderful one-hoss shay,      Drawn by a rat-tailed, ewe-necked bay.      \"Huddup!\" said the parson.--Off went they.      The parson was working his Sunday's text,--      Had got to _fifthly_, and stopped perplexed      At what the--Moses--was coming next.      All at once the horse stood still,      Close by the meet'n'-house on the hill.      --First a shiver, and then a thrill,      Then something decidedly like a spill,--      And the parson was sitting upon a rock,      At half past nine by the meet'n'-house clock,--      Just the hour of the Earthquake shock!      --What do you think the parson found,      When he got up and stared around?      The poor old chaise in a heap or mound,      As if it"]]]
