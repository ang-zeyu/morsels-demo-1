We did not wait long before the scorpion entered in a great  rage, for he had noticed that somebody had broken into his house. When  I saw him my heart shrunk till it was no bigger than a flea, but as he  came in I waited till he was close by me, then struck one blow that  chopped all three of his heads off at once.    \"I instantly smeared myself with the hot blood and as soon as it  touched my feet they stuck as fast as if they had never been cut off.  I also smeared the blind man's eyes, and his sight returned. After  thanking God, each set out on his own way.    \"I did not want to go home at once, but thought it best to hire out as  a shepherd and leave God to arrange things so that the criminals'  guilt should appear. I was not disappointed in my confidence, for you  see His power is great and His judgment just.\"    \"Now tell me how you became a servant and poultry-maid,\" said the  emperor to the maiden.    \"After your imperial majesty's oldest sons had cut off their youngest  brother's feet, one of them took me, the other the wonderful bird. I  thought my heart would dissolve with grief because I was obliged to  part from your majesty's youngest son, whom I loved because he was  such a noble man. They proposed that I should love one of them, and  promised that he would marry me as soon as we reached the emperor's  court. After refusing all their offers, I preferred to take service as  your majesty's poultry maid, rather than go any where else, for I knew  God would not let a man who did right perish, and now I thank Him for  having shown me that a good deed is never lost.\"    \"Can you prove,\" asked the emperor, \"that you are the girl and no one  else?\"    \"This apple will show every one that I am she,\" replied the girl,  drawing it from her bosom. \"Your older sons knew nothing about it, or  they would have taken it from me.\"    With these words she went out of doors, cracked a little whip three  times over the apple and a magnificent palace, more splendid than any  in the kingdom, instantly arose.    The emperor himself was astonished. He wished to celebrate his  youngest son's return, but the latter said, \"Father, before we thank  God that I have come home alive, let us three brothers submit to His  judgment.\"    The emperor could make no objection. The brothers were led before him  and he ordered the older ones to kneel and ask the youngest son's  forgiveness. But he replied: \"If God forgives you, I will also.\"    As they could not avoid it, they went in front of the church, and set  out three bee-hives at equal distances apart. Each brother stood with  his feet in one, and hurled a stone into the air from a sling. The  elder brothers' stones in falling back struck them so hard on the head  that they were killed, but the youngest brother's fell in front of  him.    Many had assembled to witness this trial. After the wedding was over  and the emperor had married his son to the poultry-maid, he came down  from the throne and gave it to the prince, who, if alive, reigns there  still.    I was present at these events, and now tell them to those who listen.          The Twins With the Golden Star.      Once upon a time something happened. If it hadn't happened, it  wouldn't be told.    There was an emperor, who ruled over a whole world, and in this world  lived an old shepherd and shepherdess, who had three daughters, Anna,  Stana, and Laptitza.[1]    [Footnote 1: Little Milk-white, from \"Lapte\"--milk.]    Anna, the oldest sister, was so beautiful that the sheep stopped  feeding when she went among them; Stana, the second, was so lovely  that the wolves watched the herd when she was the shepherdess, but  Laptitza, the youngest, who had a skin as white as the foam of milk,  and hair as soft as the wool of the lambkins, was as beautiful as both  of her sisters put together, beautiful as only she herself could be.    One summer day, when the sunbeams were growing less scorching, the  three sisters went to the edge of the forest to pick strawberries.  While searching for them, they heard the tramp of horses' hoofs, as if  a whole troop of cavalry were dashing up. It was the emperor's son,  hunting with his friends and courtiers, all handsome, stately youths,  sitting their horses as if they were a part of their steeds, but the  handsomest and proudest of all rode the most fiery charger, and was  the emperor's son himself.    When they saw the sisters, they curbed their horses and rode more  slowly.    \"Listen to me, sisters,\" said Anna; \"if one of those youths should  choose me for his wife, I'd knead a loaf of bread which, when he had  eaten it, would make him always feel young and brave.\"    \"And I,\" said Stana, \"would weave my husband a shirt, in which he  could fight against dragons, go through water without being wet, or  fire without being burned.\"    \"But I,\" said Laptitza, the youngest sister, \"would give my husband  two beautiful sons, twin boys with golden hair, and on their foreheads  a golden star, a star as bright as Lucifer.\"    The youths heard these words, and turning their horses dashed toward  the maidens.    \"Sacred be thy promise, thou shalt be mine, fairest empress,\" cried  the emperor's son, lifting Laptitza with her berries upon his horse.    \"And thou shalt be mine!\" \"And thou shalt be mine!\" said a second and  third youth; so bearing their lovely burdens on their steeds, all  dashed back to the imperial court.    The three weddings were celebrated the very next day, and for three  days and nights the festival was held throughout the empire with great  pomp and splendor. After three days and nights the news went through  the whole country that Anna had gathered grain, ground, boiled, and  kneaded it, and made a loaf of bread, as she had promised while  picking strawberries. Then, after three more days and nights, tidings  went through the land that Stana had collected flax, dried, and  hackled it, spun it into linen, wove the cloth, and made her husband a  shirt as she had promised while seeking for her strawberries. Laptitza  alone had not yet kept her word, but great things require time.    When seven weeks had passed, counting from the wedding day, the  emperor's son, now emperor, appeared before his brave companions and  the other courtiers with a very joyous face, and in a much softer  voice than ever before informed them that henceforth he should not  leave the court for a long time, his heart moved him to stay with his  wife night and day.    So the world, the country, and the whole empire rejoiced in the  expectation of seeing something never beheld before.    But many things happen in this world, among them much that is good and  much that is evil.    The emperor had a step-mother, who had brought with her to the palace  a daughter of her first husband, a girl with beautiful hair. But woe  betide those who have such relationships.    The step-mother had intended that her daughter should become the  emperor's wife and empress of the whole country, instead of little  Milk-white, the shepherd's daughter. Therefore she determined that if  things fell out as Laptitza had promised, the emperor and the world  should believe they did not happen according to the prediction.    But the step-mother could not carry out her plan, because the emperor  remained with his wife day and night. Yet she thought that gradually,  by coaxing and cunning, she might get rid of him, and then Laptitza  would be left in her care and she would provide for every thing.    But she could not get rid of the emperor by means of a few coaxing  words. The wind blew them away, and all her craft was useless. Time  passed, the day for the fulfillment of Laptitza's promise was drawing  near, and still the emperor never left his wife.    When the step-mother saw that no plot succeeded, she felt as if a  stone were lying heavy on her heart, and sent a message to her  brother, whose kingdom was very near, to ask him to come with his  soldiers and summon the emperor to a war.    This was a clever plan and, as will be seen, not an unsuccessful one.  The emperor fairly leaped into the air in his rage, when he heard that  hostile soldiers were on the march to attack his country, and that  something would occur which had not happened for a long time--a  battle, a terrible battle, a battle between two emperors. The young  husband saw that there was no help for it, he must do what needed to  be done.    That is the way with emperors. No matter how much they wish to guard  their wives--if they hear of war, their hearts fairly leap in their  bodies, their brains swell almost to bursting, their eyes grow dim,  and leaving wife and children in God's care, they dash like the wind  to battle.    The emperor departed at the first sign of peril, moved as swiftly as  one of God's judgments, fought as only he could fight, and at dawn on  the morning of the third day was back again at the imperial court, his  heart soothed by the battle, but full of unsatisfied longing to know  what had happened during his absence.    And--this had happened. Just at dawn on the morning of the third day,  when the stars were paling in the sky, and the emperor was only three  steps from the palace-gate, the Lord's gift came down to the earth,  and Laptitza's promise was fulfilled--two beautiful twin princes,  exactly alike, each with golden hair and a golden star on his  forehead.    But the world was not to see them!    The step-mother, as wicked as her thoughts, hastily put two puppies in  the place of the beautiful twins, and buried the golden-haired  children at the corner of the palace, just under the emperor's  windows.    When the monarch entered the palace he saw and heard nothing except  the two puppies the step-mother had put in the twins' place. No words  were wasted. The emperor saw with his own eyes, and that was enough.  Laptitza had not kept her promise, and there was nothing to be done  except mete out "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20556"],[0,"Lamarck, the Founder of Evolution (#5)"],[1,"to  accompany him in his herborizations.    Still more recently Professor Giard[12] has unearthed from the works of  Rousseau the following statement by him regarding species: \"Est-ce qu'a  proprement parler il n'existerait point d'especes dans la nature, mais  seulement des individus?\"[13] In his _Discours sur l'Inegalite parmi les  Hommes_ is the following passage, which shows, as Giard says, that  Rousseau perfectly understood the influence of the _milieu_ and of wants  on the organism; and this brilliant writer seems to have been the first  to suggest natural selection, though only in the case of man, when he  says that the weaker in Sparta were eliminated in order that the  superior and stronger of the race might survive and be maintained.      \"Accustomed from infancy to the severity of the weather and the    rigors of the seasons, trained to undergo fatigue, and obliged to    defend naked and without arms their life and their prey against    ferocious beasts, or to escape them by flight, the men acquired an    almost invariably robust temperament; the infants, bringing into the    world the strong constitution of their fathers, and strengthening    themselves by the same kind of exercise as produced it, have thus    acquired all the vigor of which the human species is capable. Nature    uses them precisely as did the law of Sparta the children of her    citizens. She rendered strong and robust those with a good    constitution, and destroyed all the others. Our societies differ in    this respect, where the state, in rendering the children burdensome    to the father, indirectly kills them before birth.\"[14]    Soon Lamarck abandoned not only a military career, but also music,  medicine, and the bank, and devoted himself exclusively to science. He  was now twenty-four years old, and, becoming a student of botany under  Bernard de Jussieu, for ten years gave unremitting attention to this  science, and especially to a study of the French flora.    Cuvier states that the _Flore Francaise_ appeared after \"six months of  unremitting labor.\" However this may be, the results of over nine  preceding years of study, gathered together, written, and printed within  the brief period of half a year, was no hasty _tour de force_, but a  well-matured, solid work which for many years remained a standard one.    It brought him immediate fame. It appeared at a fortunate epoch. The  example of Rousseau and the general enthusiasm he inspired had made the  study of flowers very popular--\"_une science a la mode_,\" as Cuvier  says--even among many ladies and in the world of fashion, so that the  new work of Lamarck, though published in three octavo volumes, had a  rapid success.    The preface was written by Daubenton.[15] Buffon also took much interest  in the work, opposing as it did the artificial system of Linne, for whom  he had, for other reasons, no great degree of affection. He obtained the  privilege of having the work published at the royal printing office at  the expense of the government, and the total proceeds of the sale of the  volumes were given to the author. This elaborate work at once placed  young Lamarck in the front rank of botanists, and now the first and  greatest honor of his life came to him. The young lieutenant,  disappointed in a military advancement, won his spurs in the field of  science. A place in botany had become vacant at the Academy of Sciences,  and M. de Lamarck having been presented in the second rank (_en seconde  ligne_), the ministry, a thing almost unexampled, caused him to be given  by the king, in 1779, the preference over M. Descemet, whose name was  presented before his, in the first rank, and who since then, and during  a long life, never could recover the place which he unjustly lost.[16]  \"In a word, the poor officer, so neglected since the peace, obtained at  one stroke the good fortune, always very rare, and especially so at that  time, of being both the recipient of the favor of the Court and of the  public.\"[17]    [Illustration: LAMARCK AT THE AGE OF 35 YEARS]    The interest and affection felt for him by Buffon were of advantage to  him in another way. Desiring to have his son, whom he had planned to be  his successor as Intendant of the Royal Garden, and who had just  finished his studies, enjoy the advantage of travel in foreign lands,  Buffon proposed to Lamarck to go with him as a guide and friend; and,  not wishing him to appear as a mere teacher, he procured for him, in  1781, a commission as Royal Botanist, charged with visiting the foreign  botanical gardens and museums, and of placing them in communication with  those of Paris. His travels extended through portions of the years 1781  and 1782.    According to his own statement,[18] in pursuit of this object he  collected not only rare and interesting plants which were wanting in the  Royal Garden, but also minerals and other objects of natural history new  to the Museum. He went to Holland, Germany, Hungary, etc., visiting  universities, botanical gardens, and museums of natural history. He  examined the mines of the Hartz in Hanover, of Freyburg in Saxony, of  Chemnitz and of Cremnitz in Hungary, making there numerous observations  which he incorporated in his work on physics, and sent collections of  ores, minerals, and seeds to Paris. He also made the acquaintance of the  botanists Gleditsch at Berlin, Jacquin at Vienna, and Murray at  Goettingen. He obtained some idea of the magnificent establishments in  these countries devoted to botany, \"and which,\" he says, \"ours do not  yet approach, in spite of all that had been done for them during the  last thirty years.\"[19]    On his return, as he writes, he devoted all his energies and time to  research and to carrying out his great enterprises in botany; as he  stated: \"Indeed, for the last ten years my works have obliged me to keep  in constant activity a great number of artists, such as draughtsmen,  engravers, and printers.\"[20]    But the favor of Buffon, powerful as his influence was,[21] together  with the aid of the minister, did not avail to give Lamarck a permanent  salaried position. Soon after his return from his travels, however, M.  d'Angiviller, the successor of Buffon as Intendant of the Royal Garden,  who was related to Lamarck's family, created for him the position of  keeper of the herbarium of the Royal Garden, with the paltry salary of  1,000 francs.    According to the same _Etat_, Lamarck had now been attached to the Royal  Garden five years. In 1789 he received as salary only 1,000 livres or  francs; in 1792 it was raised to the sum of 1,800 livres.      FOOTNOTES:    [10] _Les Grand Naturalists Francais au Commencement du XIX Siecle._    [11] Was this quiet place in the region just out of Paris possibly near  Mont Valerien? He must have been about twenty-two years old when he met  Rousseau and began to study botany seriously. His _Flore Francaise_  appeared in 1778, when he was thirty-four years old. Rousseau, at the  end of his checkered life, from 1770 to 1778, lived in Paris. He often  botanized in the suburbs; and Mr. Morley, in his _Rousseau_, says that  \"one of his greatest delights was to watch Mont Valerien in the sunset\"  (p. 436). Rousseau died in Paris in 1778. That Rousseau expressed  himself vaguely in favor of evolution is stated by Isidore Geoffroy  St. Hilaire, who quotes a \"_Phrase, malheureusement un peu ambigue, qui  semble montrer, dans se grand ecrivain, un partisan de plus de la  variabilite du type_.\" (_Resume des Vues sur l'espece organique_, p. 18,  Paris, 1889.) The passage is quoted in Geoffroy's _Histoire Naturelle  Generale des Regnes organiques_, ii., ch. I., p. 271. I have been unable  to verify this quotation.

Daubenton was at that time the leading anatomist of France, and after  Buffon's death he gathered around him all the scientific men who  demanded the transformation of the superannuated and incomplete Jardin  du Roi, and perhaps initiated the movement which resulted five years  later in the creation of the present Museum of Natural History. (Hamy,  _l. c._, p. 12.)    [16] De Mortillet (_Lamarck. Par un Groupe de Transformistes_, p. 11)  states that Lamarck was elected to the Academy at the age of thirty; but  as he was born in 1744, and the election took place in 1779, he must  have been thirty-five years of age.
