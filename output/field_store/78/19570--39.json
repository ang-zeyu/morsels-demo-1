Luckily it was just noontime and every one was indoors  awaiting lunch.    Of what followed Theo had only a vague idea. He remembered that his  father and Mr. Croyden raised him in their arms, and that in spite of  their gentleness he had cried with pain at their touch. Then he had  been put on his bed where his father proceeded to examine the injured  leg. Every motion the Doctor made caused the boy intense  agony. Afterward he had been allowed to rest, and then his father bent  over him very gravely and with trembling lips said:    \"Son, I've got to hurt you; I've got to hurt you a great deal. Your  leg is broken, and we are miles from a hospital. I have no ether to  give you, and the bone must be set. I want you to be as brave as you  can and bear the pain that I must cause you. I need not tell you that  I will work as gently as possible. Now pull yourself together and show  me the sort of son I have. The more steady your nerve is the more it  will help me, and the sooner I can finish what I must do.\"    \"All right, Father.\"    \"That's the stuff!\" ejaculated Mr. Croyden, who was standing at the  bedside. \"You are a genuine Spartan, Theo.\"    The lad smiled feebly.    \"I'll try to be.\"    \"Of course you will! You are your father's own boy.\"    Dr. Swift stooped and touched the drawn forehead with his cool hand.    \"I am going to leave you with Mr. Croyden for a few moments while I  get some of the things I need,\" he said in a low tone. \"Keep perfectly  still and rest a little if you can. There is no need for you to  worry. We will have you all fixed up within an hour. It is a clean  break--a merciful thing, for we couldn't take an X-ray of it if we  wanted to.\"    With these words he left the room.    It was some little time before he returned, and in the meanwhile  Mr. Croyden sat beside Theo's bed and talked cheerily.    \"Nothing like traveling with your own doctor,\" he remarked  jocosely. \"Now if my leg was broken I should have to hire some one in  to see it, and it would cost me a pretty penny. But here you are miles  from a settlement with your own private physician in attendance. Were  you a young prince you could not be more royally cared for. Think of  having one of the best New York surgeons at your beck and call here in  this wilderness. You are a lucky beggar!\"    Theo laughed faintly.    \"As for splints--here is a forest of the finest, straightest, and  strongest timber. What more can you ask? You couldn't do things on a  grander scale if you were in New York City.\"    Again Theo smiled.    \"Your father will have you comfortable as a cricket before long,\" went  on Mr. Croyden, \"and you will be all ready to start back----\"    \"Start back!\" interrupted Theo in distress. \"Oh, surely, Mr. Croyden,  Father is not going to take me home!\"    The older man hesitated.    \"Oh, of course I have no way of knowing what your father means to do,\"  he protested hastily. \"I only imagined that you would be more  comfortable at home, and would rather go. There really would not be  much point in staying out the month here, would there? You see, you  won't be able to get about, and your father would not like to go off  every day and leave you here alone in camp.\"    \"But Father has spent all this money to come into the woods, and he  has looked forward to the trip so much!\" groaned Theo. \"Besides, he is  very tired and needs the rest; he told me so. If he takes me back home  he will miss it all! He doesn't want the vacation just for his own  fun, but so he can serve our country better if he is needed. I don't  see why we couldn't stay on here just as we planned, even if I have a  broken leg,\" was Theo's concluding plea.    \"Think how stupid it would be for you to be left in the house alone.\"    \"I shouldn't care. I could find some way to amuse myself.\"    \"But your father----\"    \"He could go fishing just as he always does!\" exclaimed Theo  promptly. \"You surely don't suppose I'd be so selfish as to make him  stay in the house just because I had to, do you? You see\"--Theo  colored and then went on bravely--\"this accident was my own  fault. Father told me the other day to let that ladder alone--and I  didn't. It serves me right to break my leg. If I had been in Dad's  place I'd have said: _I told you so_. But he didn't even whisper  it. He was just patient and kind as he always is. Can't you understand  now, Mr. Croyden, that I am the one to be punished--not Dad? If we go  back home it will be punishing him too, and that wouldn't be fair,  would it?\"    \"No, not fair at all,\" admitted Mr. Croyden slowly.    \"That is what I think,\" nodded Theo. \"You see, I am the one to  suffer.\"    \"If you disobeyed, I guess you are.\"    \"I did disobey.\"    \"Humph! It was a pity.\"    \"I'm sorry; but it is done now,\" said Theo soberly. \"You know how you  feel when you've done wrong. It's bad enough anyhow; and it makes you  feel a hundred times worse if somebody else gets the blame for what  you've done--somebody who doesn't deserve it.\"    \"Yes.\"    \"So, you see, that is why I want you to urge Father to stay on here,\"  begged Theo. \"Tell him the Maine air will do me good; tell him I'll  get a fine rest keeping still; tell him--oh, tell him _anything_; only  don't let him pack up and go home, and have his whole vacation  spoiled. If you'll just get him to stay, Mr. Croyden, I will promise  not to bother, and he can go off every day and fish just as if I  weren't here.\"    \"You are a trump, Theo.\"    \"It--it is only that I think it's square, sir,\" faltered Theo.    There was not time for further discussion, for at this juncture the  door opened and Dr. Swift, followed by Manuel, entered.    Theo knew the moment for his boasted heroism had come.    He shut his lips tightly, and although the interval of anguish which  followed forced the tears from his eyes he made no outcry. But never  in his life had he experienced such pain. He did not know there was  such pain in all the world.    When it was over and, faint from suffering, he lay languidly back  among the pillows, Dr. Swift's stern face relaxed, and it was then  Theo realized for the first time that his father, too, had been  bracing himself to meet the ordeal and had also been suffering.    \"My poor boy!\" was all the Doctor said. \"You have borne it like a  man! I am proud of you, Theo.\"    The words were few, but the praise was at that moment very precious.    His father sat with him the remainder of the day, as well as a good  part of the night, and during the wakeful hours when the boy tossed to  and fro he would have ventured to speak about staying in camp had not  Dr. Swift bidden him to be quiet every time he attempted to talk. The  next morning, however, after the invalid had been bathed and had his  breakfast the Doctor said of his own accord:    \"So you think you would be happier to remain here in the woods, Theo,  instead of going home.\"    The lad glanced up in surprise.    \"Did Mr. Croyden tell you that?\"    Dr. Swift nodded.    \"He said you'd like to stay,\" he returned quickly.    \"I should, very much.\"    \"Suppose we call it settled then, and say no more about it. I am sure  I have no wish to jolt you over those miles of rough corduroy road if  it can be avoided. You seem better this morning. Your fever has gone  down, and I see no reason why you should not get on all right from now  on.\"    Theo smiled; then he whispered timidly:    \"I just want to tell you I'm sorry I disobeyed you, Father.\"    His father put out his hand gently and covered the boy's two with his  own.    \"You have the worst of it, son. Experience is a great teacher, they  say. Let it help you not to do such a foolish thing again.\"    Theo met his father's eyes gratefully. He still felt weak and shaken  and he was thankful not to have his fault rubbed in.    During the long hours of the long days that followed the lad had many  an opportunity to put his unselfish resolutions into practise. He  insisted that his father and Mr. Croyden go off on the long tramps  they had each season been accustomed to take together, and during  their absence he remained with Franz, who was very kind to him. The  Indian had a great many devices for entertaining him. Now he fashioned  for the boy's amusement a miniature birch-bark canoe; now he showed  him how to weave baskets from lithe twigs of alder. Sometimes he  whittled wonderful whistles and toys from bits of wood; sometimes made  tiny bows and arrows or snowshoes. His resources seemed never  ending.    Then when night came and Dr. Swift and Mr. Croyden returned from  fishing Theo was always carried into the living-room of the cabin, and  while he lay on the couch before the fire he would listen to the tale  of the day's adventures. This bedtime hour was the best in the whole  day.    At last there came a morning when Theo awoke to hear a storm beating  noisily down upon the roof. The wind was blowing hard and sheets of  rain drenched the windows.    \"There'll be no fishing to-day,\" announced Dr. Swift after  breakfast. \"Instead Manuel is going out over the carry for provisions,  and before he goes I must write some letters for him to take. In the  meantime Mr. Croyden wants to know if you would like to have him come  in and talk with you for a while?\"    \"Like it!\" was the delighted exclamation.    \"I believe I hear him now. Yes, here he is. Come in, Croyden!\" called  the Doctor heartily. \"Our patient says he will be glad to see you.\"    \"Glad? I should say I should!\"    Mr. Croyden chuckled.    \"I don't know that any audience ever gave me such a royal welcome  before,\" he declared with amusement. \"How do you find yourself this  morning, sonny? Able to talk Greek pottery?\"    \"Able to hear you talk it,\" Theo answered instantly.    \"I am thinking of shifting my subject to-day and telling you about  Chinese and Japanese pottery instead.\"    \"That will"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19424"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Exeter (#5)"],[1," And this reason is so ridiculous as to be almost  incredible. None the less it had, doubtless, a good deal to do with  Neville's election to the bishopric. He was not only a brother to the  great Earl of Warwick, but he early showed his intention of keeping up  the almost kingly traditions of his family. Here is an account of the  festivities that took place at Oxford after he had performed \"his  exercises in the nave of St. Mary's Church, as the custom now is, and  before was, for nobleman's sons.\" \"Such entertainment was given for two  days space that the memory of man being not now able to produce, I have  thought it worth my pains to remember. On the first day therefore were  600 messes of meat, and on the second 300 for the entertainment only of  scholars and certain of the Proceeders, relations and acquaintances.\" A  later Oxford historian asserts that Neville was elected chancellor the  very next year \"by an appreciative university!\" It is not at all  unlikely, therefore, that this display of hospitality had something to  do with his being chosen bishop, as a fitting successor to the office  once filled by Grandisson. For four years after his election he was  unable, owing to his youth, to be consecrated. But by one of those  ecclesiastical scandals, which seem not to have annoyed or astonished  his contemporaries, he was permitted to enjoy the temporalities of the  see. At the age of twenty-seven he was fully ordained bishop, and a few  years later was transferred to York. During the episcopate of his  successor, Bothe, the city was besieged by Perkin Warbeck. In 1495  Oliver King, who was elected in 1492, was translated to the see of Bath  and Wells, and to him is due the rebuilding of the abbey church of Bath  which was then ruinous.    From 1504 to 1519 Oldham, a Lancashire man, was bishop. He built the  Oldham and Speke chapels.    Veysey, who succeeded him, lived during the reign of Henry VIII. His  courtly manners made him popular. In addition to his rich ecclesiastical  office, he became Lord President of Wales and tutor to the Princess  Mary. He founded the town of Sutton Coleshill, now Sutton Coldfield, and  introduced there the making of kersies. On this enterprise he spent the  larger part of his fortune. At the accession of Edward VI. he was left  undisturbed, though suspected of favouring the old religion. But when a  rising in favour of the unreformed church disturbed the western  counties, he was accused of participation in the movement, and resigned  his charge. But he retained the temporalities, and on Mary's accession  was reinstated. But he was nearly 103 years old, and soon after died at  his town of Sutton Coleshill in 1555.    Miles Coverdale, the translator, with Tyndale, of the Bible, his  successor, was bishop for only two years. He was unpopular, although his  life was \"most godly\" and virtuous. But \"the common people,\" says Hoker,  \"whose bottles would receive no new wine, could not brook or digest him,  for no other cause but because he was a preacher of the Gospel, an enemy  to Papistry, and a married man.\" This dislike is easily accounted for.  Exeter was very far from London, the new ideas travelled slowly, and the  west was staunchly conservative. As with many reformers, too, his zeal  was spoilt by indiscretion; the sternness of the Puritan militated  against his success, and people preferred the old errors more becomingly  supported. His successor, Turberville, was a man quite after the heart  of the people, and he won praise from Protestant and Catholic alike.    He was succeeded by William Alleyn, and as a result of Veysey's  extravagance and Henry's greed it may be noticed that, by royal charter,  the number of canons was limited to nine.    In 1627 the see was held by Joseph Hall, a man of great distinction.  Though too conciliatory to care greatly for Laud's policy, he wrote a  justly famous \"Defence of the Church of England and her doctrines.\"  After his translation to Norwich he underwent a good deal of  persecution, which he himself has recorded, and was for six months a  prisoner in the Tower. He is buried in Higham parish church, his  monument a skeleton holding \"in the right hand a bond to death sealed  and signed, 'Debemus morti nos nostrique,' and in his left the same bond  torn and cancelled, with the endorsement 'Persolvit et quietus est.'\"  Fuller says of the famous satirist that he was \"not unhappy at  controversies, more happy at comments, very good in his characters,  better in his sermons, best of all in his meditations.\"    John Gauden, who became bishop in 1660, was far more fortunate, though  probably not more happy. He does not seem to have been over scrupulous,  and his desire for \"a good manger\" is unpleasantly obvious. But as the  author of the [Greek: EIKON BASILIKE] he is remembered. The authorship  has been disputed, but Charles II. certainly recognized his claim, and  Clarendon believed his assertions about it. He was clever enough to have  written even a better book, and there is no sufficient ground for  depriving him of this honour. It is certain that he owed his preferment  to his reputed merit as its author; though, oddly enough, he had taken  the covenant and preached a notorious sermon against \"pictures, images,  and other superstitions of popery.\" But he publicly recanted, later, and  protested against the murder of the king, whose supposed last prayers  and meditations he was skilfully inventing. After being in Exeter two  years he was removed to Worcester. But he had looked to become bishop of  Winchester, and it is said that his death was hastened by  disappointment.    Seth Ward, who followed him, had, as dean of Exeter, distinguished  himself by his zeal and courage. He drove from the cathedral precincts  the buyers and sellers who had encroached thereon, and the partition  wall that divided the cathedral was taken down at his request. During  the Commonwealth \"the building which was now formally called 'the late  cathedral church' was divided by a brick wall into two places of  worship, known as East Peter's and West Peter's.\" The east portion was  used by the Independents and the west by Presbyterians. Ward spent  L20,000 on redeeming the cathedral from the degradation it had suffered,  and bought an organ, \"esteemed the best in England,\" which cost him  L2,000. He was translated to Salisbury in 1667. He was a man of  considerable ability and was a founder of the Royal Society.    Sparrow succeeded to the see in 1667. During his episcopate the Grand  Duke Cosmo visited Exeter and wondered at the worthy bishop, his wife,  and his nine children. The Duke of Tuscany was spoken of in the local  reports as the Duke of Tuskey, and he received from the corporation a  gift of \"L20, or thereabouts.\" Sparrow, on his translation to Norwich,  was succeeded by Lamplugh, whose political acumen, at any rate, compels  admiration, if not respect. He fervently bade his flock rally round the  unfortunate James II, and then, posting to London, was rewarded by the  grateful king with the archbishopric of York. He then without any  compunction crowned William of Orange, King of England. But his  smartness availed little, \"for within three years continuance of that  high throne of York he was summoned before an higher.\" Macaulay has  finely described the entrance of the prince into the cathedral. \"As he  passed under the gorgeous screen, that renowned organ, scarcely  surpassed by any of those which are the boast of his native Holland,  gave out a peal of triumph. He mounted the bishop's seat, a stately  throne, rich with the carving of the fifteenth century. Burnet stood  below, and a crowd of warriors and nobles appeared on the right hand and  on the left. The singers robed in white sang the 'Te Deum.' When the  chaunt was over Burnet read the Prince's declaration; but as soon as the  first words were uttered, prebendaries and singers crowded in all haste  out of the choir. At the close, Burnet, in a loud voice, cried, 'God  save the Prince of Orange,' and many fervent voices answered 'Amen.'\"  This is certainly the most remarkable, as it is also the last, of the  great historical events that have happened under the shadow of the  cathedral walls. There had been nothing to compare with it since the day  when Grandisson with his armed retainers met Mepham at the close gate  three hundred years before. Offspring Blackall is the last bishop we  need mention. He was a famous preacher, and worked hard for the comfort  and education of the indigent classes. To him Exeter owes her charity  schools.    Of the remaining bishops there is nothing of moment to record.    It has seemed wiser in this brief sketch to devote a paragraph to each  of those bishops who either architecturally or historically made their  episcopates events of national importance. The early bishops,  especially, busied themselves exceedingly in making beautiful their  principal church. It is by knowing something of their lives and times  that one can best appreciate their labours, and trace with intelligent  interest the causes of the splendid result to be studied minutely in the  remaining chapters of this book.    Moreover, all lovers of the great in art, all who love what is  beautiful, as all may with a little trouble, will not be sorry to have  even a passing acquaintance with those who have wrought so nobly. And  this short notice of the most famous of the bishops of Exeter proves  that they were for the most part chosen, not for their lineage, however  splendid, nor the favour they had gained as gracious courtiers, but for  their excellent lives, their plain living and high thinking, their taste  and learning, and for qualities which, if rarer now, were not common  even hundreds of years ago.
