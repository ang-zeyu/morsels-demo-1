On my right sat Monsieur G. Chastenet, Senateur de la Gironde.  Very choice wines were served and the champagne was reserved for the  last. There was a speech by the Mayor and a response by the Minister of  Colonies. We were given information as we went along and some of this I  will record. We were told that a great many submarines had been captured  by the French in nets. The popular impression is that when captured the  submarines are left under water six or seven days, then brought up to  the surface and the bodies of the officers and seamen, who in the  meantime have died, are either burned or buried. The submarine is then  manned by a French crew and thus turned into the French service.    We made some inquiries in regard to the labor situation and we were  informed that before the war a common laborer received four francs per  day, about eighty cents of our money, and that they are now receiving  five francs. The women received two francs before the war and they are  now receiving three. There are no labor unions in Bordeaux or in the  vicinity.    We had here our first visit from newspaper correspondents. A number of  important Paris papers were represented, with the New York Herald, the  Chicago Tribune and other leading American papers. We met the general of  the Gironde and the marine official. We were told that at any of these  functions we were not to mention the names of the officials to whom we  were introduced, and this enabled us to talk quite freely. One of the  generals whom I met at this banquet said that the war would end in  December, 1917.    On Tuesday, September 5th, the Bordeaux Fair was dedicated. The  commission was invited and we took part in the exercises. These fairs  are an annual event in many parts of France. There is a very large  theatre in Bordeaux, which has not been opened since the war. We were  given an invitation to enter it. It is certainly finer than any theatre  I had seen previously.    We were then taken to the celebrated wine vaults of Bordeaux, owned by  J. Calvert & Co. and Bardin & Gustier. Some of these wines date back to  the early part of the last century and the vintages are all the way from  five to ninety years old. There were sixty thousand casks of wine stored  and about ten million bottles of champagne. The money value of the  stocks is very large. We were told that America was one of the best  customers for these high grade wines.    In the evening we attended a reception to the Minister of Colonies at  Ville de Bordeaux. This was a very enjoyable affair and we met some  noted French people.    Wednesday, September 6th, was the birthday of Lafayette. We had been  invited by the American Chamber of Commerce to assist in their  celebration at Paris, but were unable to reach that city in time.    Instead of going to Paris on this date we visited the Chateau Margaux,  built in 1780. We were shown through the private vaults. We met the  Duchess, a most charming personage, a grandmother at the age of  thirty-five, a very plain, unassuming lady. I supposed up to the time I  was introduced to her that she was a newspaper correspondent. During the  tour through these private vaults, the guide discoursed on the making of  wine, from the planting of the vines to the bottling and selling  process. This was all very interesting.    The different sized bottles of wine were described as follows: half  pints for sick rooms, pints, and then quarts, with all of which we were  familiar. He then told us of the magnum, holding two quarts; the  Jereboam, holding three quarts, the imperial, holding five quarts, and  the Nebuchadnezzar, holding the Lord only knows how many quarts--pretty  nearly as big as a barrel.    In the port of Bordeaux were a great many neutral boats. On the sides of  these boats in very large letters, appeared the names of the boats and  the flag of the particular country, also the name of the country. We saw  vessels from Italy, Greece, Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Holland. We were  told that no nation at the beginning was prepared for war except  Germany. It seemed to be the unanimous opinion that the war would last  at least one year longer.    Monsieur Gustier, president of the Bordeaux Chamber of Commerce,  departed at one o'clock for Paris in a de luxe car. This car was the one  usually occupied by President Poincaire and known as the president's  car.    Before departing we were given a noonday luncheon at the Hotel Terminal  by the \"Committee General Franco-American Society.\"    We were now for the first time told that we were being entertained by  the French government, through its different chambers of commerce. On  the way, two of the general officers of the railroad company boarded the  train.    We noticed on passing through the country, that all the people working  on the farms were either old men, women or children, the young men all  being in the army.    One of the things, earnestly desired by the French people is to increase  the birthrate. A bonus system has been proposed as well as all sorts of  plans for increasing the size of families.    We learned here that four million men and women in France were engaged  in the wine industry.    We arrived in Paris at 10:30, September 6th. The only light visible was  the moon. The Hotel de Crillon, formerly a castle occupied by the French  nobility and transformed into a very comfortable and aristocratic hotel,  was our stopping place.    Early on Thursday morning, September 7th, I paid my first visit to the  American Ambulance. I met Dr. Metcalf, a former Youngstown physician. He  has charge of the New York and the Frank H. Mason wards. At the time we  were there six hundred soldiers were under treatment. Deaths run about  two per cent.    This was my first visit to an army hospital and the impression will  never be forgotten. There were men in all different stages of wounds,  some of them convalescent; others on the dividing line; with others the  treatment was just starting. This American Ambulance is considered the  best managed hospital in all France. General Frank H. Mason, who had  been consul general and in the consular service more than thirty years,  had charge of it up to the time of his death. He was succeeded by  Monsieur Benet. It is a thorough business organization.    On this same day I visited Mrs. Frank H. Mason, the venerable widow of  General Mason. We drove out together and I again visited the Ambulance  in her company. She has been active in benevolent work for many years  and was greeted everywhere with signs of affection. She took great pride  in the ward named for her husband. In this ward most of the soldiers  under treatment are officers.    I also met at the Ambulance Major Kipling, the head of the \"flying  corps\". They have there about a dozen military ambulances that go to the  front and bring back the wounded. Over seven thousand have been brought  in since March. Two trips are made daily.    I also met at the Ambulance Mrs. Benet, a society woman, but in nurse's  garb and actively at work.    [Illustration: Miniature French Flag carried by the Author through  France. The Waving of this Flag by an American Aroused much  Enthusiasm.]    I next visited the Church of the Holy Trinity. This is the American  church in Paris. It was built in 1842 and is now in charge of Dr.  Watson, well known to all Americans who visit Paris. In the urn room are  the remains of General Mason and his mother-in-law, Mrs. Judge Birchard.  Her husband was in partnership with the late Governor Tod, and it was in  Judge Birchard's office that Governor Tod studied law.    On Friday, September 8th, the commission was given a reception by the  Association Nationale De Expansion Economique and the Paris Chamber of  Commerce, jointly. There was an animated discussion at this luncheon  with members of the Paris Chamber of Commerce, all of it in French. Some  of the commissioners got badly tangled up, but we got through by the aid  of our French-speaking commissioners and matters were pretty well  straightened out.    We were given a luncheon on this same day by the Paris Chamber of  Commerce at the Armenonville. We met at this luncheon a great many Paris  notables, many of them members of the French parliament, and others  prominent in business and finance.    In the evening I visited the Rejane Theatre and saw some wonderful  moving pictures, taken by means of periscopes; they showed the inside of  the trenches, prisoners being taken, big guns firing, one mine  explosion, the visit of King George and also of King Albert of Belgium;  in fact it was the representation of a real battle and most thrilling.    On Saturday, September 9th, quite to the surprise of many of the  commissioners, we were invited to inspect a noted dressmaking  establishment, the Callot Saurs, otherwise the Callot Sisters, at No. 11  Avenue Marigon. We could hardly understand what this visit to the  dressmakers had to do with our investigating French industrial  establishments, but light was thrown on the subject when we learned that  these sisters had three thousand employees, principally women. I made  the remark that I supposed Worth was the French authority on women's  gowns, but was told that Worth was a back number. It was a remarkable  experience; we were taken into a large room and for a period of more  than two hours were shown marvelous creations in the way of women's  gowns. It really looked like a play. There were some lightning changes.  We timed some of the models and they changed their entire costumes in  less than three minutes. It goes without saying that some of the  costumes did not cover enough of the models to require very much time  for a change. It was really quite an experience, and some of the  commissioners wondered if we could not go back again the next day.    In the evening we were invited to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20467"],[0,"Handbook of the Trees of New England (#5)"],[1,"valley to the mouth of the Passumpsic, reaching  an altitude of 1000 feet above the sea level; Vermont,--common in the  northern Champlain valley, less frequent in the Connecticut valley  (_Flora of Vermont_, 1900); common in the other New England states,  often forming large tracts of woodland, sometimes exclusively occupying  extensive areas.

Extremely variable in habit. In thin soils and  upon bleak sites the trunk is for the most part crooked and twisted, the  head scrubby, stunted, and variously distorted, resembling in shape and  proportions the pitch pine under similar conditions. In deeper soils,  and in situations protected from the winds, the stem is erect, slender,  and tapering, surmounted by a stately head with long, flexible branches,  scarcely less regular in outline than the spruce.
