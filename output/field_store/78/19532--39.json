I particularly appeal to the farmers of the South to plant abundant  foodstuffs as well as cotton. They can show their patriotism in no  better or more convincing way than by resisting the great temptation of  the present price of cotton and helping, helping upon a large scale, to  feed the nation and the peoples everywhere who are fighting for their  liberties and for our own. The variety of their crops will be the  visible measure of their comprehension of their national duty.      The response was amazing in its enthusiastic and general compliance. No  autocracy issuing a ukase could have been obeyed so explicitly. Not only  did the various classes of workers and individuals observe the  President's suggestions to the letter, but they yielded up individual  right after right in order that the war work of the government might be  expedited. Extraordinary powers and functions were granted by the people  through Congress, and it was not until peace was declared that these  rights and powers returned to the people.    These governmental activities ceased functioning after the war:  Food administration;  Fuel administration;  Espionage act;  War trade board;  Alien property custodian (with extension of time for certain duties);  Agricultural stimulation;  Housing construction (except for shipbuilders);  Control of telegraphs and telephones;  Export control.    These functions were extended:  Control over railroads: to cease within twenty-one months after the  proclamation of peace.    The War Finance Corporation: to cease to function six months after the  war, with further time for liquidation.    The Capital Issues Committee: to terminate in six months after the peace  proclamation.    The Aircraft Board: to end in six months after peace was proclaimed; and  the government operation of ships, within five years after the war was  officially ended.      President Wilson, generally acclaimed as the leader of the world's  democracies, phrased for civilization the arguments against autocracy in  the great peace conference after the war. The President headed the  American delegation to that conclave of world re-construction. With him  as delegates to the conference were Robert Lansing, Secretary of State;  Henry White, former Ambassador to France and Italy; Edward M. House and  General Tasker H. Bliss.    Representing American Labor at the International Labor conference held  in Paris simultaneously with the Peace Conference were Samuel Gompers,  president of the American Federation of Labor; William Green,  secretary-treasurer of the United Mine Workers of America; John R.  Alpine, president of the Plumbers' Union; James Duncan, president of the  International Association of Granite Cutters; Frank Duffy, president of  the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners, and Frank Morrison,  secretary of the American Federation of Labor.    Estimating the share of each Allied nation in the great victory, mankind  will conclude that the heaviest cost in proportion to prewar population  and treasure was paid by the nations that first felt the shock of war,  Belgium, Serbia, Poland and France. All four were the battle-grounds of  huge armies, oscillating in a bloody frenzy over once fertile fields and  once prosperous towns.    Belgium, with a population of 8,000,000, had a casualty list of more  than 350,000; France, with its casualties of 4,000,000 out of a  population (including its colonies) of 90,000,000, is really the martyr  nation of the world. Her gallant poilus showed the world how cheerfully  men may die in defense of home and liberty. Huge Russia, including  hapless Poland, had a casualty list of 7,000,000 out of its entire  population of 180,000,000. The United States out of a population of  110,000,000 had a casualty list of 236,117 for nineteen months of war;  of these 53,169 were killed or died of disease; 179,625 were wounded;  and 3,323 prisoners or missing.

To the glory of Great Britain must be recorded the enormous effort made  by its people, showing through operations of its army and navy. The  British Empire, including, the Colonies, had a casualty list of  3,049,992 men out of a total population of 440,000,000. Of these 658,665  were killed; 2,032,122 were wounded, and 359,204 were reported missing.  It raised an army of 7,000,000, and fought seven separate foreign  campaigns, in France, Italy, Dardanelles, Mesopotamia, Macedonia, East  Africa and Egypt. It raised its navy personnel from 115,000 to 450,000  men. Co-operating with its allies on the sea, it destroyed approximately  one hundred and fifty German and Austrian submarines. It aided  materially the American navy and transport service in sending overseas  the great American army whose coming decided the war. The British navy  and transport service during the war made the following record of  transportation and convoy:    Twenty million men, 2,000,000 horses, 130,000,000 tons of food,  25,000,000 tons of explosives and supplies, 51,000,000 tons of oil and  fuels, 500,000 vehicles. In 1917 alone 7,000,000 men, 500,000 animals,  200,000 vehicles and 9,500,000 tons of stores were conveyed to the  several war fronts.    The German losses were estimated at 1,588,000 killed or died of disease;  4,000,000 wounded; and 750,000 prisoners and missing.    A tabulation of the estimates of casualties and the money cost of the  war reveals the enormous price paid by humanity to convince a  military-mad Germanic caste that Right and not Might must hereafter rule  the world. These figures do not include Serbian losses, which are  unavailable.

Was the cost  too heavy? Was the price of international liberty paid in human lives  and in sacrifices untold too great for the peace that followed?    Even the most practical of money changers, the most sentimental  pacifist, viewing the cost in connection with the liberation of whole  nations, with the spread of enlightened liberty through oppressed and  benighted lands, with the destruction of autocracy, of the military  caste, and of Teutonic kultur in its materialistic aspect, must agree  that the blood was well shed, the treasure well spent.    Millions of gallant, eager youths learned how to die fearlessly and  gloriously. They died to teach vandal nations that nevermore will  humanity permit the exploitation of peoples for militaristic purposes.    As Milton, the great philosopher poet, phrased the lesson taught to  Germany on the fields of France:    They err who count it glorious to subdue  By conquest far and wide, to overrun  Large countries, and in field great battles win,  Great cities by assault; what do these worthies  But rob and spoil, burn, slaughter, and enslave  Peaceable nations, neighboring or remote  Made captive, yet deserving freedom more  Than those their conquerors, who leave behind  Nothing but ruin wheresoe'er they rove  And all the flourishing works of peace destroy.

Hard waters may, in general, be cured in part, by dropping into them a  solution of sub-carbonate of potash; or, if the hardness be owing only  to the presence of super-carbonate of lime, mere boiling will greatly  remedy the defect; part of the carbonic acid flies off, and a neutral  carbonate of lime falls down to the bottom; it may then be used for  washing, scarcely curdling soap. But if the hardness be owing in part to  sulphate of lime, boiling does not soften it at all.    When spring water is used for washing, it is advantageous to leave it  for some time exposed to the open air in a reservoir with a large  surface. Part of the carbonic acid becomes thus dissipated, and part of  the carbonate of lime falls to the bottom. Mr. Dalton[11] has observed  that the more any spring is drawn from, the softer the water becomes.      CHEMICAL CONSTITUTION OF THE WATERS USED IN DOMESTIC ECONOMY AND THE  ARTS.      _Rain Water_,    Collected with every precaution as it descends from the clouds, and at a  distance from large towns, or any other object capable of impregnating  the atmosphere with foreign matters, approaches more nearly to a state  of purity than perhaps any other natural water. Even collected under  these circumstances, however, it invariably contains a portion of common  air and carbonic acid gas. The specific gravity of rain water scarcely  differs from that of distilled water; and from the minute portions of  the foreign ingredients which it generally contains, it is very _soft_,  and admirably adapted for many culinary purposes, and various processes  in different manufactures and the arts.    Fresh-fallen _snow_, melted without the contact of air, appears to be  nearly free from air. Gay-Lussac and Humboldt, however, affirm, that it  contains nearly the usual proportion of air.    Water from melted _ice_ does not contain so much air. _Dew_ has been  supposed to be saturated with air.    Snow water has long laid under the imputation of occasioning those  strumous swellings in the neck which deform the inhabitants of many of  the Alpine vallies; but this opinion is not supported by any  well-authenticated indisputable facts, and is rendered still more  improbable, if not entirely overturned, by the frequency of the disease  in Sumatra[12], where ice and snow are never seen.    In high northern latitudes, thawed snow forms the constant drink of the  inhabitants during winter; and the vast masses of ice which float on the  polar seas, afford an abundant supply of fresh water to the mariner.      _Spring Water_,    Includes well-water and all others that arise from some depth below the  surface of the earth, and which are used at the fountain-head, or at  least before they have run any considerable distance exposed to the air.  Indeed, springs may be considered as rain water which has passed through  the fissures of the earth, and, having accumulated at the bottom of  declivities, rises again to the surface forming springs and wells. As  wells take their origin at some depth from the surface, and below the  influence of the external atmosphere, their temperature is in general  pretty uniform during every vicissitude of season, and always several  degrees lower than the atmosphere. They differ from one another  according to the nature of the strata through which they issue; for  though the ingredients usually existing in them are in such minute  quantities as to impart to the water no striking properties, and do not  render it unfit for common purposes, yet they modify its nature very  considerably. Hence the water of some springs is said to be _hard_, of  others _soft_, some _sweet_, others _brackish_, according to the nature  and degree of the inpregnating ingredients.    Common springs are insensibly changed into mineral or medicinal springs,  as their foreign contents become larger or more unusual; or, in some  instances, they derive medicinal celebrity from the absence of those  ingredients usually occurring in spring-water; as, for example, is the  case with the Malvern spring, which is nearly pure water.    Almost all spring-waters possess the property termed _hardness_ in a  greater or less degree; a property which depends chiefly upon the  presence of super-carbonate, or of sulphate of lime, or of both; and the  quantity of these earthy salts varies very considerably in different  instances. Mr. Dalton[13] has shewn that one grain of sulphate of lime,  contained in 2000 grains of water, converts it into the hardest spring  water that is commonly met with.    The waters of deep wells are usually much harder than those of springs  which overflow the mouth of the well; but there are some exceptions to  this rule.    The purest springs are those which occur in primitive rocks, or beds of  gravel, or filter through sand or silicious strata. In general, large  springs are purer than small ones: and our old wells contain finer water  than those that are new, as the soluble parts through which the water  filters in channels under ground become gradually washed away.      _River Water_,    Is a term applied to every running stream or rivulet exposed to the air,  and always flowing in an open channel. It is formed of spring water,  which, by exposure, becomes more pure, and of running land or surface  water, which, although turbid from particles of the alluvial soil  suspended in it, is otherwise very pure. It is purest when it runs over  a gravelly or rocky bed, and when its course is swift. It is generally  soft, and more free from earthy salts than spring water; but it usually  contains less common air and carbonic acid gas; for, by the agitation of  a long current, and exposed to the temperature of the atmosphere, part  of its carbonic acid gas is disengaged, and the lime held in solution by  it is in part precipitated, the loss of which contributes to the  softness of the water. Its specific gravity thereby becomes less, the  taste not so harsh, but less fresh and agreeable; and out of a hard  spring is often made a stream of sufficient purity for most of the  purposes where a soft water is required.    The water called in this metropolis _New River Water_, contains a minute  portion of muriate of lime, carbonate of lime, and muriate of soda.    Some streams, however, that arise from clean silicious beds, and flow in  a sandy or stony channel, are from the outset remarkably pure; such as  the mountain lakes and rivulets in the rocky districts of Wales, the  source of the beautiful waters of the Dee, and numberless other rivers  that flow through the hollow of every valley. Switzerland has long been  celebrated for the purity and excellence of its waters, which pour in  copious streams from the mountains, and give rise to the finest rivers  in Europe.    Some rivers, however, that do not take their rise from a rocky soil, and  are indeed at first considerably charged with foreign matter, during a  long course, even over a richly cultivated plain, become remarkably pure  as to saline contents; but often fouled with mud containing much animal  and vegetable matter, which are rather suspended than held in true  solution. Such is the water of the river Thames, which, taken up at  London at low water mark, is very soft and good; and, after rest, it  contains but a very small portion of any thing that could prove  pernicious, or impede any manufacture. It is also excellently fitted for  sea-store; but it then undergoes a remarkable spontaneous change, when  preserved in wooden casks. No water carried to sea becomes putrid sooner  than that of the Thames. But the mode now adopted in the navy of  substituting iron tanks for wooden casks, tends greatly to obviate this  disadvantage.    Whoever will consider the situation of the Thames, and the immense  population along its banks for so many miles, must at once perceive the  prodigious accumulation of animal matters of all kinds, which by means  of the common sewers constantly make their way into it. These matters  are, no doubt, in part the cause of the putrefaction which it is well  known to undergo at sea, and of the carburetted and sulphuretted  hydrogen gases which are evolved from it. When a wooden cask is opened,  after being kept a month or two, a quantity of carburetted and  sulphuretted hydrogen escapes, and the water is so black and offensive  as scarcely to be borne. Upon racking it off, however, into large  earthen vessels, and exposing it to the air, it gradually deposits a  quantity of black slimy mud, becomes clear as crystal, and remarkably  sweet and palatable.    It might, at first sight, be expected that the water of the Thames,  after having received all the contents of the sewers, drains, and water  courses, of a large town, should acquire thereby such impregnation with  foreign matters, as to become very impure; but it appears, from the most  accurate experiments that have been made, that those kinds of impurities  have no perceptible influence on the salubrious quality of a mass of  water so immense, and constantly kept in motion by the action of the  tides.    Some traces of animal matter may, however, be detected in the water of  the Thames; for if nitrate of lead be dropped into it,[14] \"you will  find that it becomes milky, and that a white powder falls to the bottom,  which dissolves without effervescence in nitric acid. It is, therefore,  (says Dr. Thomson) a combination of oxide of lead with some animal  matter.\"      SUBSTANCES USUALLY CONTAINED IN COMMON WATER, AND TESTS BY WHICH THEY  ARE DETECTED.    To acquire a knowledge of the general nature of common water, it is only  necessary to add to it a few chemical tests, which will quickly indicate  the presence or absence of the substances that may be expected.    Almost the only salts contained in common waters are the carbonates,  sulphates, and muriates of soda, lime, and magnesia; and sometimes a  very minute portion of iron may also "]]]
