There is a considerable number of such laws specifically  enumerated in the texts:    \"The people of the Days of Ignorance engaged in many practices which the  Law of Islam later confirmed. They would not take in marriage both a  mother and her daughter, and the most shameful of acts in their view was  to marry two sisters. They would stigmatize a man marrying the wife of his  father, derisively calling him his father's competitor. It was their  custom to go on pilgrimage to the House at Mecca, where they would perform  the ceremonies of visitation, putting on the pilgrim's dress, practicing  the circumambulation, running between the hills, pausing at all the  stopping-places, and casting the stones. It was, furthermore, their wont  to intercalate one month in every three-year period, to perform ablutions  after intercourse, to rinse out the mouth and snuff up water through the  nostrils, to part the hair, use the tooth-stick, pare the nails and pluck  the armpits. They would, likewise, cut off the right hand of a thief.\"    Can one, God forbid, assume that because some of the divine laws resemble  the practices of the Days of Ignorance, the customs of a people abhorred  by all nations, it follows that there is a defect in these laws? Or can  one, God forbid, imagine that the Omnipotent Lord was moved to comply with  the opinions of the heathen? The divine wisdom takes many forms. Would it  have been impossible for Muhammad to reveal a Law which bore no  resemblance whatever to any practice current in the Days of Ignorance?  Rather, the purpose of His consummate wisdom was to free the people from  the chains of fanaticism which had bound them hand and foot, and to  forestall those very objections which today confuse the mind and trouble  the conscience of the simple and helpless.    Some, who are not sufficiently informed as to the meaning of the divine  Texts and the contents of traditional and written history, will aver that  these customs of the Days of Ignorance were laws which had come down from  His Holiness Abraham and had been retained by the idolaters. In this  connection they will cite the Qur'anic verse: \"Follow the religion of  Abraham, the sound in faith.\"(17) Nevertheless it is a fact attested by  the writings of all the Islamic schools that the months of truce, the  lunar calendar, and the cutting off of the right hand as punishment for  theft, formed no part of Abraham's Law. In any case, the Pentateuch is  extant and available today, and contains the laws of Abraham. Let them  refer to it. They will then, of course, insist that the Torah has been  tampered with, and in proof will quote the Qur'anic verse: \"They pervert  the text of the Word of God.\"(18) It is, however, known where such  distortion has occurred, and is a matter of record in critical texts and  commentaries.(19) Were We to develop the subject beyond this brief  reference, We would have to abandon Our present purpose.    According to some accounts, mankind has been directed to borrow various  good qualities and ways from wild animals, and to learn a lesson from  these. Since it is permissible to imitate virtues of dumb animals, it is  certainly far more so to borrow material sciences and techniques from  foreign peoples, who at least belong to the human race and are  distinguished by judgment and the power of speech. And if it be contended  that such praiseworthy qualities are inborn in animals, by what proof can  they claim that these essential principles of civilization, this knowledge  and these sciences current among other peoples, are not inborn? Is there  any Creator save God? Say: Praised be God!    The most learned and accomplished divines, the most distinguished  scholars, have diligently studied those branches of knowledge the root and  origin of which were the Greek philosophers such as Aristotle and the  rest, and have regarded the acquisition from the Greek texts of sciences  such as medicine, and branches of mathematics including algebra(20) and  arithmetic, as a most valuable achievement. Every one of the eminent  divines both studies and teaches the science of logic, although they  consider its founder to have been a Sabean. Most of them have insisted  that if a scholar has thoroughly mastered a variety of sciences but is not  well grounded in logic, his opinions, deductions and conclusions cannot  safely be relied upon.    It has now been clearly and irrefutably shown that the importation from  foreign countries of the principles and procedures of civilization, and  the acquisition from them of sciences and techniques-- in brief, of  whatsoever will contribute to the general good--is entirely permissible.  This has been done to focus public attention on a matter of such universal  advantage, so that the people may arise with all their energies to further  it, until, God helping them, this Sacred Land may within a brief period  become the first of nations.    O you who are wise! Consider this carefully: can an ordinary gun compare  with a Martini-Henry rifle or a Krupp gun? If anyone should maintain that  our old-time firearms are good enough for us and that it is useless to  import weapons which have been invented abroad would even a child listen  to him? Or should anyone say: \"We have always transported merchandise from  one country to another on the backs of animals. Why do we need steam  engines? Why should we try to ape other peoples?\" could any intelligent  person tolerate such a statement? No, by the one God! Unless he should,  because of some hidden design or animosity, refuse to accept the obvious.    Foreign nations, in spite of their having achieved the greatest expertness  in science, industry and the arts, do not hesitate to borrow ideas from  one another. How can Persia, a country in the direst need, be allowed to  lag behind, neglected, abandoned?    Those eminent divines and men of learning who walk the straight pathway  and are versed in the secrets of divine wisdom and informed of the inner  realities of the sacred Books; who wear in their hearts the jewel of the  fear of God, and whose luminous faces shine with the lights of  salvation--these are alert to the present need and they understand the  requirements of modern times, and certainly devote all their energies  toward encouraging the advancement of learning and civilization. \"Are they  equal, those who know, and those who do not know?... Or is the darkness  equal with the light?\"(21)    The spiritually learned are lamps of guidance among the nations, and stars  of good fortune shining from the horizons of humankind. They are fountains  of life for such as lie in the death of ignorance and unawareness, and  clear springs of perfections for those who thirst and wander in the  wasteland of their defects and errors. They are the dawning places of the  emblems of Divine Unity and initiates in the mysteries of the glorious  Qur'an. They are skilled physicians for the ailing body of the world, they  are the sure antidote to the poison that has corrupted human society. It  is they who are the strong citadel guarding humanity, and the impregnable  sanctuary for the sorely distressed, the anxious and tormented, victims of  ignorance. \"Knowledge is a light which God casteth into the heart of  whomsoever He willeth.\"    For every thing, however, God has created a sign and symbol, and  established standards and tests by which it may be known. The spiritually  learned must be characterized by both inward and outward perfections; they  must possess a good character, an enlightened nature, a pure intent, as  well as intellectual power, brilliance and discernment, intuition,  discretion and foresight, temperance, reverence, and a heartfelt fear of  God. For an unlit candle, however great in diameter and tall, is no better  than a barren palm tree or a pile of dead wood.    The flower-faced may sulk or play the flirt,  The cruel fair may bridle and coquet;  But coyness in the ugly is ill-met,  And pain in a blind eye's a double hurt.\"(22)    An authoritative Tradition states: \"As for him who is one of the  learned:(23) he must guard himself, defend his faith, oppose his passions  and obey the commandments of his Lord. It is then the duty of the people  to pattern themselves after him.\" Since these illustrious and holy words  embody all the conditions of learning, a brief commentary on their meaning  is appropriate. Whoever is lacking in these divine qualifications and does  not demonstrate these inescapable requirements in his own life, should not  be referred to as learned and is not worthy to serve as a model for the  believers.    The first of these requirements is to guard one's own self. It is obvious  that this does not refer to protecting oneself from calamities and  material tests, for the Prophets and saints were, each and every one,  subjected to the bitterest afflictions that the world has to offer, and  were targets for all the cruelties and aggressions of mankind. They  sacrificed their lives for the welfare of the people, and with all their  hearts they hastened to the place of their martyrdom; and with their  inward and outward perfections they arrayed humanity in new garments of  excellent qualities, both acquired and inborn. The primary meaning of this  guarding of oneself is to acquire the attributes of spiritual and material  perfection.    The first attribute of perfection is learning and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19238"],[0,"Foundations of World Unity (#5)"],[1,"gross  ignorance to which man must not subject himself. Man is endowed with  powers to investigate reality, and the reality is that humanity is one in  kind and equal in the creative plan. Therefore false distinctions of race  and nativity which are factors and causes of warfare must be abandoned.    Consider what is happening(3) in Tripoli; how the poor are being killed  and the blood of the helpless is being shed upon both sides; children made  fatherless, fathers lamenting the death of their sons, mothers bewailing  the loss of dear ones. And what is the benefit after all? Nothing  conceivable. Is it therefore justifiable? The domestic animals do not  manifest hatred and cruelty toward each other; that is the attribute of  the wild and ferocious beasts. In a flock of one thousand sheep you will  witness no bloodshed. Numberless species of birds are peaceful in flocks.  Wolves, lions, tigers are ferocious because it is their natural and  necessary means for obtaining food. Man has no need of such ferocity; his  food is provided in other ways. Therefore it is evident that warfare,  cruelty and bloodshed in the kingdom of man are caused by human greed,  hatred and selfishness. The kings and rulers of nations enjoy luxury and  ease in their palaces and send the common people to the battlefield; offer  them as the food and targets of cannon. Each day they invent new  instruments for the more complete destruction of the foundations of the  human race. They are callous and merciless toward their fellow-creatures.  What shall atone for the sufferings and grief of mothers who have so  tenderly cared for their sons? What sleepless nights they have spent and  what days of devotion and love they have given to bring their children to  maturity! Yet the savagery of these warring rulers causes great numbers of  their victims to be torn and mutilated in a day. What ignorance and  degradation, yea even greater than the ferocious beasts themselves! For a  wolf will carry away and devour one sheep at a time whereas an ambitious  tyrant may cause the death of one hundred thousand men in a battle and  glory in his military prowess saying, \"I am commander-in-chief; I have won  this mighty victory.\" Consider the ignorance and inconsistency of the  human race. If a man kills another, no matter what the cause may be, he is  pronounced a murderer, imprisoned or executed; but the brutal oppressor  who has slain one hundred thousand is idolized as a hero, conqueror or  military genius. A man steals a small sum of money; he is called a thief  and sent to the penitentiary; but the military leader who invades and  pillages a whole kingdom is acclaimed heroic and a mighty man of valor.  How base and ignorant is man!    In Persia previous to the middle of the nineteenth century, among the  various tribes and peoples, sects and denominations there existed the  greatest animosity, strife and hatred. At that time too all the other  nations of the East were in the same condition. Religionists were hostile  and bigoted, sects were at enmity, races hated each other, tribes were  constantly at war; everywhere antagonism and conflict prevailed. Men  shunned and were suspicious of each other. The man who could kill a number  of his fellow-creatures was glorified for his heroism and strength. Among  religionists it was esteemed a praiseworthy deed to take the life of one  who held an opposite belief. At this time Baha'u'llah arose and declared  his mission. He founded the oneness of the world of humanity, proclaimed  that all are servants of the loving and merciful God who has created,  nourished and provided for all, therefore why should men be unjust and  unkind to each other, showing forth that which is contrary to God? As He  loves us why should we entertain animosity and hate? If God did not love  all He would not have created, trained and provided for all.  Loving-kindness is the divine policy. Shall we consider human policy and  attitude superior to the wisdom and policy of God? This would be  inconceivable, impossible. Therefore we must emulate and follow the divine  policy, dealing with each other in the utmost love and tenderness.    Baha'u'llah declared the \"Most Great Peace\" and international arbitration.  He voiced these principles in numerous epistles which were circulated  broadcast throughout the East. He wrote to all the kings and rulers  encouraging, advising and admonishing them in regard to the establishment  of peace; making it evident by conclusive proofs that the happiness and  glory of humanity can only be assured through disarmament and arbitration.  This was nearly fifty years ago. Because he promulgated the message of  Universal Peace and international agreement, the kings of the Orient arose  against him for they did not find their personal and national benefits  advanced by his admonition and teaching. They persecuted him bitterly,  inflicted upon him every torment, imprisoned, bastinadoed, banished him  and eventually confined him in a fortress. Then they arose against his  followers. For the establishment of international peace the blood of  twenty thousand Baha'is was spilt. Their homes were destroyed, their  children made captives and their possessions pillaged yet none of these  people waxed cold or wavered in devotion. Even to this day the Baha'is are  persecuted and quite recently a number were killed, for wherever they are  found they put forth the greatest efforts to establish the peace of the  world. They not only promulgate principles; they are people of action.    In Persia today through the teachings of Baha'u'llah you will find people  of various religious beliefs and denominations living together in the  utmost peace and agreement. The former enmities and hatred have passed  away and they exercise the utmost love toward all mankind for they realize  and know that all are the creatures and servants of one God. This is  directly due to the divine teachings. At most it is simply this; that the  ignorant must be educated, the ailing must be healed, those who are as  children in the scale of development must be helped to reach the age of  maturity. We must not be unfriendly to any one because of ignorance,  neither must we reject the immature or turn away from the sick but  administer the remedy for each human need until all are united in the  providence of God. Therefore it is evident that the essential foundations  of the divine religions are unity and love. If religion be productive of  discord among mankind it is a destroyer and not divine for religion  implies unity and binding together and not separation. Mere knowledge of  principles is not sufficient. We all know and admit that justice is good  but there is need of volition and action to carry out and manifest it. For  example, we might think it good to build a church but simply thinking of  it as a good thing will not help its erection. The ways and means must be  provided; we must will to build it and then proceed with the construction.  All of us know that international peace is good, that it is conducive to  human welfare and the glory of man but volition and action are necessary  before it can be established. Action is the essential. Inasmuch as this  century is a century of light, capacity for action is assured to mankind.  Necessarily the divine principles will be spread among men until the time  of action arrives. Surely this has been so and truly the time and  conditions are ripe for action now. All men know that verily war is the  destroyer of human foundations and in every country of the world this is  admitted and apparent. I find the United States of America an exceedingly  progressive nation, the government just, the people in a state of  readiness and the principle of equality established to an extraordinary  degree. Therefore it is my hope that inasmuch as the standard of  international peace must be upraised it may be upraised upon this  continent, for this nation is more deserving and has greater capacity for  such an initial step than any other. If other nations should attempt to do  this the motive will be misunderstood. For instance, if Great Britain  should declare for international peace it will be said that it has been  done to insure the safety of her colonies. If France should hoist the  standard other nations will declare some hidden diplomatic policy  underlies the action; Russia would be suspected of national designs if the  first step were taken by that people, and so on with all the European and  eastern governments. But the United States of America could not be accused  of any such selfish interest. Your government has, strictly speaking, no  colonies to protect. You are not endeavoring to extend your domain nor  have you need of territorial expansion. Therefore if America takes the  first step toward the establishing of world peace it is certain to be  ascribed to unselfishness and altruism. The world will say, \"There is no  other motive than altruism and service to humanity in this action by the  United States.\" Therefore it is my hope that you may stand forth as the  first herald of peace and hoist this banner; for this banner will be  hoisted. Raise it aloft, for you are the most qualified and deserving of  nations. The other countries await this summons, expect this call to the  standard of reconciliation, for the whole world is distressed because of  the excessive burden and irreparable damage of war. Taxes are levied to  meet its drain. Every year the burden increases and the people have come  to their end. Just now(4) Europe is a battlefield of ammunition ready for  a spark; and one spark will set aflame the whole world. Before these  complications and cataclysmic events happen, take the step to prevent it.    The foundations of all the divine religions are peace and agreement, but  misunderstandings and ignorance have developed. If these are caused to  disappear you will see that all the religious agencies"]]]
