[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/216"],[0,"The Tao Teh King, or the Tao and its Characteristics (#5)"],[1," men thrive all around.    3. In this way the effect will be seen in the person, by the  observation of different cases; in the family; in the neighbourhood;  in the state; and in the kingdom.    4. How do I know that this effect is sure to hold thus all under the  sky?  By this (method of observation).      55. 1. He who has in himself abundantly the attributes (of the Tao) is  like an infant.  Poisonous insects will not sting him; fierce beasts  will not seize him; birds of prey will not strike him.    2. (The infant's) bones are weak and its sinews soft, but yet its  grasp is firm.  It knows not yet the union of male and female, and yet  its virile member may be excited;--showing the perfection of its  physical essence.  All day long it will cry without its throat  becoming hoarse;--showing the harmony (in its constitution).    3.       To him by whom this harmony is known,     (The secret of) the unchanging (Tao) is shown,     And in the knowledge wisdom finds its throne.     All life-increasing arts to evil turn;     Where the mind makes the vital breath to burn,     (False) is the strength, (and o'er it we should mourn.)    4. When things have become strong, they (then) become old, which may  be said to be contrary to the Tao.  Whatever is  contrary to the Tao  soon ends.      56. 1. He who knows (the Tao) does not (care to) speak (about it); he  who is (ever ready to) speak about it does not know it.    2. He (who knows it) will keep his mouth shut and close the portals  (of his nostrils).  He will blunt his sharp points and unravel the  complications of things; he will attemper his brightness, and bring  himself into agreement with the obscurity (of others).  This is called  'the Mysterious Agreement.'    3. (Such an one) cannot be treated familiarly or distantly; he is  beyond all consideration of profit or injury; of nobility or  meanness:--he is the noblest man under heaven.      57. 1. A state may be ruled by (measures of) correction; weapons of  war may be used with crafty dexterity; (but) the kingdom is made one's  own (only) by freedom from action and purpose.    2. How do I know that it is so?  By these facts:--In the kingdom the  multiplication of prohibitive enactments increases the poverty of the  people; the more implements to add to their profit that the people  have, the greater disorder is there in the state and clan; the more  acts of crafty dexterity that men possess, the more do strange  contrivances appear; the more display there is of legislation, the  more thieves and robbers there are.    3. Therefore a sage has said, 'I will do nothing (of purpose), and the  people will be transformed of themselves; I will be fond of keeping  still, and the people will of themselves become correct.  I will take  no trouble about it, and the people will of themselves become rich; I  will manifest no ambition, and the people will of themselves attain to  the primitive simplicity.'      58.    1.       The government that seems the most unwise,     Oft goodness to the people best supplies;     That which is meddling, touching everything,     Will work but ill, and disappointment bring.    Misery!--happiness is to be found by its side!  Happiness!--misery  lurks beneath it!  Who knows what either will come to in the end?    2. Shall we then dispense with correction?  The (method of) correction  shall by a turn become distortion, and the good in it shall by a turn  become evil.  The delusion of the people (on this point) has indeed  subsisted for a long time.    3. Therefore the sage is (like) a square which cuts no one (with its  angles); (like) a corner which injures no one (with its sharpness).  He is straightforward, but allows himself no license; he is bright,  but does not dazzle.      59. 1. For regulating the human (in our constitution) and rendering  the (proper) service to the heavenly, there is nothing like  moderation.    2. It is only by this moderation that there is effected an early  return (to man's normal state).  That early return is what I call the  repeated accumulation of the attributes (of the Tao).  With that  repeated accumulation of those attributes, there comes the subjugation  (of every obstacle to such return).  Of this subjugation we know not  what shall be the limit; and when one knows not what the limit shall  be, he may be the ruler of a state.    3. He who possesses the mother of the state may continue long.  His  case is like that (of the plant) of which we say that its roots are  deep and its flower stalks firm:--this is the way to secure that its  enduring life shall long be seen.      60. 1. Governing a great state is like cooking small fish.    2. Let the kingdom be governed according to the Tao, and the manes of  the departed will not manifest their spiritual energy.  It is not that  those manes have not that spiritual energy, but it will not be  employed to hurt men.  It is not that it could not hurt men, but  neither does the ruling sage hurt them.    3. When these two do not injuriously affect each other, their good  influences converge in the virtue (of the Tao).      61. 1. What makes a great state is its being (like) a low-lying,  down-flowing (stream);--it becomes the centre to which tend (all the  small states) under heaven.    2. (To illustrate from) the case of all females:--the female always  overcomes the male by her stillness.  Stillness may be considered (a  sort of) abasement.    3. Thus it is that a great state, by condescending to small states,  gains them for itself; and that small states, by abasing themselves to  a great state, win it over to them.  In the one case the abasement  leads to gaining adherents, in the other case to procuring favour.    4. The great state only wishes to unite men together and nourish them;  a small state only wishes to be received by, and to serve, the other.  Each gets what it desires, but the great state must learn to abase  itself.      62.    1.       Tao has of all things the most honoured place.     No treasures give good men so rich a grace;     Bad men it guards, and doth their ill efface.    2. (Its) admirable words can purchase honour; (its) admirable deeds  can raise their performer above others.  Even men who are not good are  not abandoned by it.    3. Therefore when the sovereign occupies his place as the Son of  Heaven, and he has appointed his three ducal ministers, though (a  prince) were to send in a round symbol-of-rank large enough to fill  both the hands, and that as the precursor of the team of horses (in  the court-yard), such an offering would not be equal to (a lesson of)  this Tao, which one might present on his knees.    4. Why was it that the ancients prized this Tao so much?  Was it not  because it could be got by seeking for it, and the guilty could escape  (from the stain of their guilt) by it?  This is the reason why all  under heaven consider it the most valuable thing.      63. 1. (It is the way of the Tao) to act without (thinking of) acting;  to conduct affairs without (feeling the) trouble of them; to taste  without discerning any flavour; to consider what is small as great,  and a few as many; and to recompense injury with kindness.    2. (The master of it) anticipates things that are difficult while they  are easy, and does things that would become great while they are  small.  All difficult things in the world are sure to arise from a  previous state in which they were easy, and all great things from one  in which they were small.  Therefore the sage, while he never does  what is great, is able on that account to accomplish the greatest  things.    3. He who lightly promises is sure to keep but little faith; he who is  continually thinking things easy is sure to find them difficult.  Therefore the sage sees difficulty even in what seems easy, and so  never has any difficulties.      64. 1. That which is at rest is easily kept hold of; before a thing  has given indications of its presence, it is easy to take measures  against it; that which is brittle is easily broken; that which is very  small is easily dispersed.  Action should be taken before a thing has  made its appearance; order should be secured before disorder has  begun.    2. The tree which fills the arms grew from the tiniest sprout; the  tower of nine storeys rose from a (small) heap of earth; the journey  of a thousand li commenced with a single step.    3. He who acts (with an ulterior purpose) does harm; he who takes hold  of a thing (in the same way) loses his hold.  The sage does not act  (so), and therefore does no harm; he does not lay hold (so), and  therefore does not lose his hold.  (But) people in their conduct of  affairs are constantly ruining them when they are on the eve of  success.  If they were careful at the end, as (they should be) at the  beginning, they would not so ruin them.    4. Therefore the sage desires what (other men) do not desire, and does  not prize things difficult to get; he learns what (other men) do not  learn, and turns back to what the multitude of men have passed by.  Thus he helps the natural development of all things, and does not dare  to act (with an ulterior purpose of his own).      65. 1. The ancients who showed their skill in practising the Tao did  so, not to enlighten the people, but rather to make them simple and  ignorant.    2. The difficulty in governing the people arises from their having  much knowledge.  He who (tries to) govern a state by his wisdom is a  scourge to it; while he who does not (try to) do so is a blessing.    3. He who knows these two things finds in them also his model and  rule.  Ability to know this model and rule constitutes what we call  the mysterious excellence (of a governor).  Deep and far-reaching is  such mysterious excellence, showing indeed its possessor as opposite  to others, but leading them to a great conformity to him.      66. 1. That whereby the rivers and seas are able to receive the homage  and tribute of all the valley "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2160"],[0,"The Expedition of Humphry Clinker (#5)"],[1,"gummata, verruca,  cristoe Galli, and a serpiginous eruption, or rather a pocky itch  all over her body. By the time she had taken the second pill, sir, by  Heaven! she was as smooth as my hand, and the third made her sound and  as fresh as a new born infant.' 'Sir (cried my uncle peevishly) I have  no reason to flatter myself that my disorder comes within the efficacy  of your nostrum. But this patient you talk of may not be so sound at  bottom as you imagine.' 'I can't possibly be mistaken (rejoined the  philosopher) for I have had communication with her three times--I always  ascertain my cures in that manner.' At this remark, all the ladies  retired to another corner of the room, and some of them began to  spit.--As to my uncle, though he was ruffled at first by the doctor's  saying he was dropsical, he could not help smiling at this ridiculous  confession and, I suppose, with a view to punish this original, told  him there was a wart upon his nose, that looked a little suspicious. 'I  don't pretend to be a judge of those matters (said he) but I understand  that warts are often produced by the distemper; and that one upon your  nose seems to have taken possession of the very keystone of the  bridge, which I hope is in no danger of falling.' L--n seemed a little  confounded at this remark, and assured him it was nothing but a common  excrescence of the cuticula, but that the bones were all sound below;  for the truth of this assertion he appealed to the touch, desiring he  would feel the part. My uncle said it was a matter of such delicacy to  meddle with a gentleman's nose, that he declined the office--upon which,  the Doctor turning to me, intreated me to do him that favour. I complied  with his request, and handled it so roughly, that he sneezed, and the  tears ran down his cheeks, to the no small entertainment of the company,  and particularly of my uncle, who burst out a-laughing for the first  time since I have been with him; and took notice, that the part seemed  to be very tender. 'Sir (cried the Doctor) it is naturally a tender  part; but to remove all possibility of doubt, I will take off the wart  this very night.'    So saying, he bowed, with great solemnity all round, and retired to his  own lodgings, where he applied a caustic to the wart; but it spread in  such a manner as to produce a considerable inflammation, attended with  an enormous swelling; so that when he next appeared, his whole face was  overshadowed by this tremendous nozzle; and the rueful eagerness with  which he explained this unlucky accident, was ludicrous beyond all  description.--I was much pleased with meeting the original of a  character, which you and I have often laughed at in description; and  what surprises me very much, I find the features in the picture, which  has been drawn for him, rather softened than over-charged.    As I have something else to say; and this letter has run to an  unconscionable length, I shall now give you a little respite, and  trouble you again by the very first post. I wish you would take it in  your head to retaliate these double strokes upon    Yours always, J. MELFORD          To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, of Jesus college, Oxon.    HOT WELL, April 20.    DEAR KNIGHT,    I now sit down to execute the threat in the tail of my last. The truth  is, I am big with the secret, and long to be delivered. It relates to my  guardian, who, you know, is at present our principal object in view.    T'other day, I thought I had detected him in such a state of frailty, as  would but ill become his years and character. There is a decent sort of  woman, not disagreeable in her person, that comes to the Well, with a  poor emaciated child, far gone in a consumption. I had caught my uncle's  eyes several times directed to this person, with a very suspicious  expression in them, and every time he saw himself observed, he hastily  withdrew them, with evident marks of confusion--I resolved to watch him  more narrowly, and saw him speaking to her privately in a corner of the  walk. At length, going down to the Well one day, I met her half way up  the hill to Clifton, and could not help suspecting she was going to our  lodgings by appointment, as it was about one o'clock, the hour when my  sister and I are generally at the Pump-room.--This notion exciting my  curiosity, I returned by a back-way, and got unperceived into my own  chamber, which is contiguous to my uncle's apartment. Sure enough, the  woman was introduced but not into his bedchamber; he gave her audience  in a parlour; so that I was obliged to shift my station to another room,  where, however, there was a small chink in the partition, through which  I could perceive what passed. My uncle, though a little lame, rose up  when she came in, and setting a chair for her, desired she would sit  down: then he asked if she would take a dish of chocolate, which she  declined, with much acknowledgment. After a short pause, he said, in a  croaking tone of voice, which confounded me not a little, 'Madam, I am  truly concerned for your misfortunes; and if this trifle can be of any  service to you, I beg you will accept it without ceremony.' So saying,  he put a bit of paper into her hand, which she opening with great  trepidation, exclaimed in an extacy, 'Twenty pounds! Oh, sir!' and  sinking down upon a settee, fainted away--Frightened at this fit, and,  I suppose, afraid of calling for assistance, lest her situation  should give rise to unfavourable conjectures, he ran about the room in  distraction, making frightful grimaces; and, at length, had recollection  enough to throw a little water in her face; by which application she was  brought to herself: but, then her feeling took another turn. She shed  a flood of tears, and cried aloud, 'I know not who you are: but,  sure--worthy sir--generous sir!--the distress of me and my poor dying  child--Oh! if the widow's prayers--if the orphan's tears of gratitude  can ought avail--gracious Providence--Blessings!--shower down eternal  blessings.'--Here she was interrupted by my uncle, who muttered in  a voice still more and more discordant, 'For Heaven's sake be quiet,  madam--consider--the people of the house--'sdeath! can't you.'--All this  time she was struggling to throw herself on her knees, while he seizing  her by the wrists, endeavoured to seat her upon the settee, saying,  'Prithee--good now--hold your tongue'--At that instant, who should  burst into--the room but our aunt Tabby! of all antiquated maidens the  most diabolically capricious--Ever prying into other people's affairs,  she had seen the woman enter, and followed her to the door, where she  stood listening, but probably could hear nothing distinctly, except my  uncle's, last exclamation; at which she bounded into the parlour in a  violent rage, that dyed the tip of her nose of a purple hue,--'Fy upon  you, Matt! (cried she) what doings are these, to disgrace your own  character, and disparage your family?'--Then, snatching the bank note  out of the stranger's hand, she went on--'How now, twenty  pounds!--here is temptation with a witness!--Good-woman, go about  your business--Brother, brother, I know not which most to admire; your  concupissins, or your extravagance!'--'Good God (exclaimed the poor  woman) shall a worthy gentleman's character suffer for an action  that does honour to humanity?' By this time, uncle's indignation was  effectually roused. His face grew pale, his teeth chattered, and his  eyes flashed--'Sister (cried he, in a voice like thunder) I vow to God,  your impertinence is exceedingly provoking.' With these words, he took  her by the hand, and, opening the door of communication, thrust her into  the chamber where I stood, so affected by the scene, that the tears ran  down my cheeks. Observing these marks of emotion, 'I don't wonder (said  she) to see you concerned at the back-slidings of so near a relation; a  man of his years and infirmities: These are fine doings, truly--This  is a rare example, set by a guardian, for the benefit of his  pupils--Monstrous! incongruous! sophistical!'--I thought it was but  an act of justice to set her to rights; and therefore explained the  mystery. But she would not be undeceived, 'What (said she) would you  go for to offer for to arguefy me out of my senses? Did'n't I hear  him whispering to her to hold her tongue? Did'n't I see her in tears?  Did'n't I see him struggling to throw her upon the couch? 0 filthy!  hideous! abominable! Child, child, talk not to me of charity.--Who gives  twenty pounds in charity?--But you are a stripling--You know nothing of  the world. Besides, charity begins at home--Twenty pounds would buy me a  complete suit of flowered silk, trimmings and all--' In short, I quitted  the room, my contempt for her, and my respect for her brother, being  increased in the same proportion. I have since been informed, that the  person, whom my uncle so generously relieved, is the widow of an ensign,  who has nothing to depend upon but the pension of fifteen pounds a year.  The people of the Well-house give her an excellent character. She lodges  in a garret, and works very hard at plain work, to support her daughter,  who is dying of a consumption. I must own, to my shame, I feel a strong  inclination to follow my uncle's example, in relieving this poor widow;  but, betwixt friends, I am afraid of being detected in a weakness, that  might entail the ridicule of the company, upon,    Dear Phillips, Yours always, J.
