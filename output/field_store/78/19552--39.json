All mankind will dwell  together as one family, blend as the waves of one sea, shine as stars of  one firmament and appear as fruits of the same tree. This is the happiness  and felicity of humankind. This is the illumination of man, the glory  eternal and life everlasting; this is the divine bestowal. I desire this  station for you and I pray God that the people of America may achieve this  great end in order that the virtue of this democracy may be insured and  their names be glorified eternally. May the confirmations of God uphold  them in all things and their memories become revered throughout the east  and the west. May they become the servants of the Most High God, near and  dear to Him in the oneness of the heavenly Kingdom.    His Holiness Baha'u'llah endured ordeals and hardships sixty years. There  was no persecution, vicissitude or suffering He did not experience at the  hand of His enemies and oppressors. All the days of His life were passed  in difficulty and tribulation; at one time in prison, another in exile,  sometimes in chains. He willingly endured these difficulties for the unity  of mankind, praying that the world of humanity might realize the radiance  of God, the oneness of humankind become a reality, strife and warfare  cease and peace and tranquillity be realized by all. In prison He hoisted  the banner of human solidarity, proclaiming Universal Peace, writing to  the kings and rulers of nations summoning them to international unity and  counselling arbitration. His life was a vortex of persecution and  difficulty, yet catastrophes, extreme ordeals and vicissitudes did not  hinder the accomplishment of His work and mission. Nay, on the contrary  His power became greater and greater, His efficiency and influence spread  and increased until His glorious light shone throughout the Orient, love  and unity were established and the differing religions found a center of  contact and reconciliation.    Therefore we also must strive in this pathway of love and service,  sacrificing life and possessions, passing our days in devotion,  consecrating our efforts wholly to the cause of God, so that, God willing,  the ensign of universal religion may be uplifted in the world of mankind  and the oneness of the world of humanity be established.    In your hearts I have beheld the reflection of a great and wonderful love.  The Americans have shown me uniform kindness and I entertain a deep  spiritual love for them. I am pleased with the susceptibilities of your  hearts. I will pray for you asking divine assistance and then say  farewell.    O my God! O my God! verily these servants are turning to Thee,  supplicating Thy kingdom of mercy. Verily they are attracted by Thy  holiness and set aglow with the fire of Thy love, seeking confirmation  from Thy wondrous kingdom and hoping for attainment in Thy heavenly realm.  Verily they long for the descent of Thy bestowal, desiring illumination  from the Sun of Reality. O Lord! make them radiant lamps, merciful signs,  fruitful trees and shining stars. May they come forth in Thy service and  be connected with Thee by the bonds and ties of thy love, longing for the  lights of Thy favor. O Lord! make them signs of guidance, standards of Thy  immortal kingdom, waves of the sea of Thy mercy, mirrors of the light of  Thy majesty. Verily Thou art the generous! Verily Thou art the merciful!  Verily Thou art the precious, the beloved!          THE MOST GREAT PEACE      Today there is no greater glory for man than that of service in the cause  of the \"Most Great Peace.\" Peace is light whereas war is darkness. Peace  is life; war is death. Peace is guidance; war is error. Peace is the  foundation of God; war is satanic institution. Peace is the illumination  of the world of humanity; war is the destroyer of human foundations. When  we consider outcomes in the world of existence we find that peace and  fellowship are factors of upbuilding and betterment whereas war and strife  are the causes of destruction and disintegration. All created things are  expressions of the affinity and cohesion of elementary substances, and  non-existence is the absence of their attraction and agreement. Various  elements unite harmoniously in composition but when these elements become  discordant, repelling each other, decomposition and non-existence result.  Everything partakes of this nature and is subject to this principle, for  the creative foundation in all its degrees and kingdoms is an expression  or outcome of love. Consider the restlessness and agitation of the human  world today because of war. Peace is health and construction; war is  disease and dissolution. When the banner of truth is raised, peace becomes  the cause of the welfare and advancement of the human world. In all cycles  and ages war has been a factor of derangement and discomfort whereas peace  and brotherhood have brought security and consideration of human  interests. This distinction is especially pronounced in the present world  conditions, for warfare in former centuries had not attained the degree of  savagery and destructiveness which now characterizes it. If two nations  were at war in olden times, ten or twenty thousand would be sacrificed but  in this century the destruction of one hundred thousand lives in a day is  quite possible. So perfected has the science of killing become and so  efficient the means and instruments of its accomplishment that a whole  nation can be obliterated in a short time. Therefore comparison with the  methods and results of ancient warfare is out of the question.    According to an intrinsic law, all phenomena of being attain to a summit  and degree of consummation, after which a new order and condition is  established. As the instruments and science of war have reached the degree  of thoroughness and proficiency, it is hoped that the transformation of  the human world is at hand and that in the coming centuries all the  energies and inventions of man will be utilized in promoting the interests  of peace and brotherhood. Therefore may this esteemed and worthy society  for the establishment of international peace be confirmed in its sincere  intentions and empowered by God. Then will it hasten the time when the  banner of universal agreement will be raised and international welfare  will be proclaimed and consummated so that the darkness which now  encompasses the world shall pass away.    Sixty years ago His Holiness Baha'u'llah was in Iran. Seventy years ago  His Holiness the Bab appeared there. These two blessed souls devoted their  lives to the foundation of international peace and love among mankind.  They strove with heart and soul to establish the teachings by which  divergent people might be brought together and no strife, rancor or hatred  prevail. His Holiness Baha'u'llah addressing all humanity, said that Adam  the parent of mankind may be likened to the tree of nativity upon which  you are the leaves and blossoms. Inasmuch as your origin was one, you must  now be united and agreed; you must consort with each other in joy and  fragrance. He pronounced prejudice, whether religious, racial, patriotic,  political, the destroyer of the body-politic. He said that man must  recognize the oneness of humanity, for all in origin belong to the same  household and all are servants of the same God. Therefore mankind must  continue in the state of fellowship and love, emulating the institutions  of God and turning away from satanic promptings, for the divine bestowals  bring forth unity and agreement whereas satanic leadings induce hatred and  war.    This remarkable personage was able by these principles to establish a bond  of unity among the differing sects and divergent people of Iran. Those who  followed His teachings no matter from what denomination or faction they  came were conjoined by the ties of love, until now they cooperate and live  together in peace and agreement. They are real brothers and sisters. No  distinctions of class are observed among them and complete harmony  prevails. Daily this bond of affinity is strengthening and their spiritual  fellowship continually develops. In order to insure the progress of  mankind and to establish these principles His Holiness Baha'u'llah  suffered every ordeal and difficulty. His Holiness the Bab became a  martyr, and over twenty thousand men and women sacrificed their lives for  their faith. His Holiness Baha'u'llah was imprisoned and subjected to  severe persecutions. Finally he was exiled from Iran to Mesopotamia; from  Ba_gh_dad He was sent to Constantinople and Adrianople and from thence to  the prison of Akka in Syria. Through all these ordeals He strove day and  night to proclaim the oneness of humanity and promulgate the message of  Universal Peace. From the prison of Akka He addressed the kings and rulers  of the earth in lengthy letters summoning them to international agreement  and explicitly stating that the standard of the \"Most Great Peace\" would  surely be upraised in the world.    This has come to pass. The powers of earth cannot withstand the privileges  and bestowals which God has ordained for this great and glorious century.  It is a need and exigency of the time. Man can withstand anything except  that which is divinely intended and indicated for the age and its  requirements. Now, praise be to God! in all countries of the world, lovers  of peace are to be found and these principles are being spread among  mankind, especially in this country. Praise be to God! this thought is  prevailing and souls are continually arising as defenders of the oneness  of humanity, endeavoring to assist and establish international peace.  There is no doubt that this wonderful democracy will be able to realize it  and the banner of international agreement will be unfurled here to spread  onward and outward among all the nations of the world. I give thanks to  God that I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19240"],[0,"Bahá'í Prayers (#5)"],[1," of hope to the morn of Thy boundless favor and at the  hour of dawn my drooping soul is refreshed and strengthened in remembrance  of Thy beauty and perfection. He whom the grace of Thy mercy aideth,  though he be but a drop, shall become the boundless ocean, and the merest  atom which the outpouring of Thy loving-kindness assisteth, shall shine  even as the radiant star.    Shelter under Thy protection, O Thou Spirit of purity, Thou Who art the  All-Bountiful Provider, this enthralled, enkindled servant of Thine. Aid  him in this world of being to remain steadfast and firm in Thy love and  grant that this broken-winged bird attain a refuge and shelter in Thy  divine nest that abideth upon the celestial tree.    --'Abdu'l-Baha        \"O my Lord, my Beloved, my Desire!

Withdraw me from all else save Thee. Attract me through Thy  fragrances of holiness. Cause me to be associated in Thy Kingdom with  those who are severed from all else save Thee, who long to serve Thy  sacred threshold and who stand to work in Thy Cause. Enable me to be one  of Thy maidservants who have attained to Thy good pleasure.

Graciously grant that this infant be fed  from the breast of Thy tender mercy and loving providence and be nourished  with the fruit of Thy celestial trees. Suffer him not to be committed to  the care of anyone save Thee, inasmuch as Thou, Thyself, through the  potency of Thy sovereign will and power, didst create and call him into  being. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Knowing.    Lauded art Thou, O my Best Beloved, waft over him the sweet savors of Thy  transcendent bounty and the fragrances of Thy holy bestowals. Enable him  then to seek shelter beneath the shadow of Thy most exalted Name, O Thou  Who holdest in Thy grasp the kingdom of names and attributes. Verily, Thou  art potent to do what Thou willest, and Thou art indeed the Mighty, the  Exalted, the Ever-Forgiving, the Gracious, the Generous, the Merciful.    --Baha'u'llah        \"O Thou peerless Lord!

Rear this little babe in the bosom of...\"      O God! Rear this little babe in the bosom of Thy love, and give it milk  from the breast of Thy Providence.

Thou  art powerful and kind, and Thou art the Bestower, the Generous, the Lord  of surpassing bounty.    --'Abdu'l-Baha        \"O God! Educate these children. These children...\"      O God! Educate these children. These children are the plants of Thine  orchard, the flowers of Thy meadow, the roses of Thy garden.

These lovely children are the handiwork of the fingers  of Thy might and the wondrous signs of Thy greatness. O God! Protect these  children, graciously assist them to be educated and enable them to render  service to the world of humanity. O God! These children are pearls, cause  them to be nurtured within the shell of Thy loving-kindness.    Thou art the Bountiful, the All-Loving.    --'Abdu'l-Baha        \"O Lord! Make these children excellent plants....\"      O Lord! Make these children excellent plants. Let them grow and develop in  the Garden of Thy Covenant, and bestow freshness and beauty through the  outpourings of the clouds of the Abha Kingdom.    O Thou kind Lord! I am a little child, exalt me by admitting me to the  kingdom. I am earthly, make me heavenly; I am of the world below, let me  belong to the realm above; gloomy, suffer me to become radiant; material,  make me spiritual, and grant that I may manifest Thine infinite bounties.

Nourish me from the breast of Thy mercy,  train me in the bosom of Thy love, educate me in the school of Thy  guidance and develop me under the shadow of Thy bounty. Deliver me from  darkness, make me a brilliant light; free me from unhappiness, make me a  flower of the rose garden; suffer me to become a servant of Thy threshold  and confer upon me the disposition and nature of the righteous; make me a  cause of bounty to the human world, and crown my head with the diadem of  eternal life.

Nurture this plant then through the outpourings of the clouds of Thy  tender mercy and quicken and refresh this sapling through the reviving  breath of Thy spiritual springtime. Suffer him to become heedful,  discerning and noble, and grant that he may attain eternal life and abide  in Thy Kingdom for evermore.    --'Abdu'l-Baha        \"O Lord!

Bestow upon him knowledge, grant him added strength at the break  of every morn and guard him within the shelter of Thy protection so that  he may be freed from error, may devote himself to the service of Thy  Cause, may guide the wayward, lead the hapless, free the captives and  awaken the heedless, that all may be blessed with Thy remembrance and  praise. Thou art the Mighty and the Powerful.    --'Abdu'l-Baha          FOR THE DEPARTED        \"O my God! This is Thy servant and the son of...\"      (The Prayer for the Dead is to be used for Baha'is over the age of  fifteen. \"It is the only Baha'i obligatory prayer which is to be recited  in congregation; it is to be recited by one believer while all present  stand. There is no requirement to face the Qiblih when reciting this  prayer.\"--A Synopsis and Codification of the Kitab-i-Aqdas)    O my God! This is Thy servant and the son of Thy servant who hath believed  in Thee and in Thy signs, and set his face towards Thee, wholly detached  from all except Thee. Thou art, verily, of those who show mercy the most  merciful.    Deal with him, O Thou Who forgivest the sins of men and concealest their  faults, as beseemeth the heaven of Thy bounty and the ocean of Thy grace.  Grant him admission within the precincts of Thy transcendent mercy that  was before the foundation of earth and heaven. There is no God but Thee,  the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Generous.    Let him, then, repeat six times the greeting \"Allah-u-Abha,\" and then  repeat nineteen times each of the following verses:    We all, verily, worship God.    We all, verily, bow down before God.    We all, verily, are devoted unto God.    We all, verily, give praise unto God.    We all, verily, yield thanks unto God.    We all, verily, are patient in God.    (If the dead be a woman, let him say: This is Thy handmaiden and the  daughter of Thy handmaiden, etc. ...)    --Baha'u'llah        \"Glory be to Thee, O Lord my God! Abase not...\"      Glory be to Thee, O Lord my God! Abase not him whom Thou hast exalted  through the power of Thine everlasting sovereignty, and remove not far  from Thee him whom Thou hast caused to enter the tabernacle of Thine  eternity. Wilt Thou cast away, O my God, him whom Thou hast overshadowed  with Thy Lordship, and wilt Thou turn away from Thee, O my Desire, him to  whom Thou hast been a refuge? Canst Thou degrade him whom Thou hast  uplifted, or forget him whom Thou didst enable to remember Thee?    Glorified, immensely glorified art Thou! Thou art He Who from everlasting  hath been the King of the entire creation and its Prime Mover, and Thou  wilt to everlasting remain the Lord of all created things and their  Ordainer. Glorified art Thou, O my God! If Thou ceasest to be merciful  unto Thy servants, who, then, will show mercy unto them; and if Thou  refusest to succor Thy loved ones, who is there that can succor them?    Glorified, immeasurably glorified art Thou! Thou art adored in Thy truth,  and Thee do we all, verily, worship; and Thou art manifest in Thy justice,  and to Thee do we all, verily, bear witness. Thou art, in truth, beloved  in Thy grace. No God is there but Thee, the Help in Peril, the  Self-Subsisting.    --Baha'u'llah        \"He is God, exalted is He, the Lord of loving-kindness...\"      He is God, exalted is He, the Lord of loving-kindness and bounty!
