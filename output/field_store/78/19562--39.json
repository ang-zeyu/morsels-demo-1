It is incumbent upon these members (of the Universal House of Justice) to  gather in a certain place and deliberate upon all problems which have  caused difference, questions that are obscure and matters that are not  expressly recorded in the Book. Whatsoever they decide has the same effect  as the Text itself. Inasmuch as the House of Justice hath power to enact  laws that are not expressly recorded in the Book and bear upon daily  transactions, so also it hath power to repeal the same. Thus for example,  the House of Justice enacteth today a certain law and enforceth it, and a  hundred years hence, circumstances having profoundly changed and the  conditions having altered, another House of Justice will then have power,  according to the exigencies of the time, to alter that law. This it can do  because these laws form no part of the divine explicit Text. The House of  Justice is both the initiator and the abrogator of its own laws.    And now, one of the greatest and most fundamental principles of the Cause  of God is to shun and avoid entirely the Covenant-breakers, for they will  utterly destroy the Cause of God, exterminate His Law and render of no  account all efforts exerted in the past. O friends! It behooveth you to  call to mind with tenderness the trials of His Holiness, the Exalted One,  and show your fidelity to the Ever-Blest Beauty. The utmost endeavor must  be exerted lest all these woes, trials and afflictions, all this pure and  sacred blood that hath been shed so profusely in the Path of God, may  prove to be in vain. Ye know well what the hands of the Center of  Sedition, Mirza Muhammad 'Ali, and his associates have wrought. Among his  doings, one of them is the corruption of the Sacred Text whereof ye are  all aware, the Lord be praised, and know that it is evident, proven and  confirmed by the testimony of his brother, Mirza Badi'u'llah, whose  confession is written in his own handwriting, beareth his seal, is printed  and spread abroad. This is but one of his misdeeds. Can a transgression be  imagined more glaring than this, the interpolation of the Holy Text? Nay,  by the righteousness of the Lord! His transgressions are writ and recorded  in a leaflet by itself. Please God, ye will peruse it.    In short, according to the explicit Divine Text the least transgression  shall make of this man a fallen creature, and what transgression is more  grievous than attempting to destroy the Divine Edifice, breaking the  Covenant, erring from the Testament, falsifying the Holy Text, sowing the  seeds of doubt, calumniating 'Abdu'l-Baha, advancing claims for which God  hath sent down no warrant, kindling mischief and striving to shed the very  blood of 'Abdu'l-Baha, and many other things whereof ye are all aware! It  is thus evident that should this man succeed in bringing disruption into  the Cause of God, he will utterly destroy and exterminate it. Beware lest  ye approach this man, for to approach him is worse than approaching fire!    Gracious God! After Mirza Badi'u'llah had declared in his own handwriting  that this man (Muhammad 'Ali) had broken the Covenant and had proclaimed  his falsification of the Holy Text, he realized that to return to the True  Faith and pay allegiance to the Covenant and Testament would in no wise  promote his selfish desires. He thus repented and regretted the thing he  had done and attempted privily to gather in his printed confessions,  plotted darkly with the Center of Sedition against me and informed him  daily of all the happenings within my household. He has even taken a  leading part in the mischievous deeds that have of late been committed.  Praise be to God affairs recovered their former stability and the loved  ones obtained partial peace. But ever since the day he entered again into  our midst, he began afresh to sow the seeds of sore sedition. Some of his  machinations and intrigues will be recorded in a separate leaflet.    My purpose is, however, to show that it is incumbent upon the friends that  are fast and firm in the Covenant and Testament to be ever wakeful lest  after this wronged one is gone this alert and active worker of mischief  may cause disruption, privily sow the seeds of doubt and sedition and  utterly root out the Cause of God. A thousand times shun his company. Take  heed and be on your guard. Watch and examine; should anyone, openly or  privily, have the least connection with him, cast him out from your midst,  for he will surely cause disruption and mischief.    O ye beloved of the Lord! Strive with all your heart to shield the Cause  of God from the onslaught of the insincere, for souls such as these cause  the straight to become crooked and all benevolent efforts to produce  contrary results.    O God, my God! I call Thee, Thy Prophets and Thy Messengers, Thy Saints  and Thy Holy Ones, to witness that I have declared conclusively Thy Proofs  unto Thy loved ones and set forth clearly all things unto them, that they  may watch over Thy Faith, guard Thy Straight Path and protect Thy  Resplendent Law. Thou art, verily, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise!            PART THREE      He Is the Witness, the All-Sufficing    O My God! my Beloved, my heart's Desire! Thou knowest, Thou seest that  which hath befallen this servant of Thine, that hath humbled himself at  Thy Door, and Thou knowest the sins committed against him by the people of  malice, they that have broken Thy Covenant and turned their backs on Thy  Testament. In the day-time they afflicted me with the arrows of hate and  in the night-season they privily conspired to hurt me. At dawn they  committed that which the Celestial Concourse did lament and at eventide  they unsheathed against me the sword of tyranny and hurled in the presence  of the ungodly their darts of calumny upon me. Notwithstanding their  misdeeds, this lowly servant of Thine was patient and did endure every  affliction and trial at their hands, though by Thy power and might he  could have destroyed their words, quenched their fire and stayed the flame  of their rebelliousness.    Thou seest, O my God! how my long-suffering, my forbearance and silence  have increased their cruelty, their arrogance and their pride. By Thy  Glory, O Beloved One! They have misbelieved in Thee and rebelled against  Thee in such wise that they left me not a moment of rest and quiet, that I  might arise as it is meet and seemly, to exalt Thy Word amidst mankind,  and might serve at Thy Threshold of Holiness with a heart that overfloweth  with the joy of the dwellers of the Abha Kingdom.    Lord! My cup of woe runneth over, and from all sides blows are fiercely  raging upon me. The darts of affliction have compassed me round and the  arrows of distress have rained upon me. Thus tribulation overwhelmed me  and my strength, because of the onslaught of the foemen, became weakness  within me, while I stood alone and forsaken in the midst of my woes. Lord!  Have mercy upon me, lift me up unto Thyself and make me to drink from the  Chalice of Martyrdom, for the wide world with all its vastness can no  longer contain me.    Thou art, verily, the Merciful, the Compassionate, the Gracious, the  All-Bountiful!    O ye the true, the sincere, the faithful friends of this wronged one!  Everyone knoweth and believeth what calamities and afflictions have  befallen this wronged one, this prisoner, at the hands of those who have  broken the Covenant at the time when, after the setting of the Day-Star of  the world, his heart was consumed with the flame of His bereavement.    When, in all parts of the earth, the enemies of God profiting by the  passing away of the Sun of Truth, suddenly and with all their might  launched their attack; at such a time and in the midst of so great a  calamity, the Covenant-breakers arose with the utmost cruelty, intent upon  harm and the stirring up of the spirit of enmity. At every moment a  misdeed they did commit and bestirred themselves to sow the seeds of  grievous sedition, and to ruin the edifice of the Covenant. But this  wronged one, this prisoner, did his utmost to hide and veil their doings,  that haply they might regret and repent. His long-suffering and  forbearance of these evil deeds, however, made the rebellious ones still  more arrogant and daring; until, through leaflets written with their own  hands, they sowed the seeds of doubt, printing these leaflets and  scattering them broadcast throughout the world, believing that such  foolish doings would bring to naught the Covenant and the Testament.    Thereupon the loved ones of the Lord arose, inspired with the greatest  confidence and constancy and aided by the power of the Kingdom, by Divine  Strength, by heavenly Grace, by the unfailing help and Celestial Bounty,  they withstood the enemies of the Covenant in well-nigh three score and  ten treatises and supported by conclusive proofs, unmistakable evidences  and clear texts from the Holy Writ, they refuted their scrolls of doubt  and mischief-kindling leaflets. The Center of Sedition was thus confounded  in his craftiness, afflicted by the wrath of God, sunk into a degradation  and infamy that shall be lasting until the Day of Doom. Base and wretched  is the plight of the people of evil deeds, they that are in grievous loss!    And as they lost their cause, grew hopeless in their efforts against the  loved ones of God, saw the Standard of His Testament waving throughout all  regions and witnessed the power of the Covenant of the Merciful One, the  flame of envy so blazed within them as to be beyond recounting. With the  utmost vigor, exertion, rancor and enmity, they followed another path,  walked in another way, devised another plan: that of kindling the flame of  sedition in the heart of the very government"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19300"],[0,"A Traveler's Narrative Written to Illustrate the Episode of the Báb (#5)"],[1,"of Qadi-Kala with horsemen and footmen, so  that, according to the terms of the agreement, they might go forth safe  and protected from the territory of Mazindaran. When they, being ignorant  of the fords and paths, had emerged from the city, _Kh_usraw dispersed his  horsemen and footmen and set them in ambush in the forest of Mazindaran,  scattered and separated the Babis in that forest on the road and off the  road, and began to hunt them down singly. When the reports of muskets  arose on every side the hidden secret became manifest, and several  wanderers and other persons were suddenly slain with bullets. Mulla Husayn  ordered the a_dh_an to be sounded to assemble his scattered followers,  while Mirza Lutf-'Ali the secretary drew his dagger and ripped open  _Kh_usraw's vitals. Of _Kh_usraw's host some were slain and others  wandered distractedly over the field of battle. Mulla Husayn quartered his  host in a fort near the burial-place of _Sh_ay_kh_ Tabarsi, and, being  aware of the wishes of the community, relaxed and interrupted the march.  This detachment was subsequently further reinforced by Mirza Muhammad-'Ali  of Mazindaran with a number of other persons, so that the garrison of the  fort numbered three hundred and thirteen souls. Of these, however, all  were not capable of fighting, only one hundred and ten persons being  prepared for war. Most of them were doctors or students whose companions  had been during their whole life books and treatises; yet, in spite of the  fact that they were unaccustomed to war or to the blows of shot and sword,  four times were camps and armies arrayed against them and they were  attacked and hemmed in with cannons, muskets, and bomb-shells, and on all  four occasions they inflicted defeat, while the army was completely routed  and dispersed. On the occasion of the fourth defeat Abbas-Quli _Kh_an of  Larijan was captain of the forces and Prince Mihdi-Quli Mirza commander in  the camp. The _Kh_an above mentioned used at nights to conceal and hide  himself in disguise amongst the trees of the forest outside the camp,  while during the day he was present in the encampment. The last battle  took place at night and the army was routed. The Babis fired the tents and  huts, and night became bright as day. The foot of Mulla Husayn's horse  caught in a noose, for he was riding, the others being on foot. Abbas-Quli  _Kh_an recognized him from the top of a tree afar off, and with his own  hand discharged several bullets. At the third shot he threw him from his  feet. He was borne by his followers to the fort, and there they buried  him. Notwithstanding this event [the troops] could not prevail by superior  force. At length the Prince made a treaty and covenant, and swore by the  Holy Imams, confirming his oath by vows plighted on the glorious Qur'an,  to this effect: \"You shall not be molested; return to your own places.\"  Since their provisions had for some time been exhausted, so that even of  the skins and bones of horses naught remained, and they had subsisted for  several days on pure water, they agreed. When they arrived at the army  food was prepared for them in a place outside the camp. They were engaged  in eating, having laid aside their weapons and armor, when the soldiers  fell on them on all sides and slew them all. Some have accounted this  valor displayed by these people as a thing miraculous, but when a band of  men are besieged in some place where all avenues and roads are stopped and  all hope of deliverance is cut off they will assuredly defend themselves  desperately and display bravery and courage.    In Zanjan and Nayriz likewise at the decree of erudite doctors and notable  lawyers a bloodthirsty military force attacked and besieged. In Zanjan the  chief was Mulla Muhammad-'Ali the mujtahid, while in Nayriz Siyyid Yahya  of Darab was the leader and arbiter. At first they sought to bring about a  reconciliation, but, meeting with cruel ferocity, they reached the pitch  of desperation; and, the overpowering force of the victorious troops  having cut off every passage of flight, they unclosed their hands in  resistance. But although they were very strong in battle and amazed the  chiefs of the army by their steadfastness and endurance, the overwhelming  military force closed the passage of flight and broke their wings and  feathers. After numerous battles they too at last yielded to covenants and  compacts, oaths and promises, vows registered on the Qur'an, and the  wonderful stratagems of the officers, and were all put to the edge of the  sword.    Were we to occupy ourselves in detail with the wars of Nayriz and Zanjan,  or to set forth these events from beginning to end, this epitome would  become a bulky volume. So, since this would be of no advantage to history,  we have passed them over briefly.    During the course of the events which took place at Zanjan the Prime  Minister devised a final and trenchant remedy. Without the royal command,  without consulting with the ministers of the subject-protecting court, he,  acting with arbitrary disposition, fixed determination, and entirely on  his own authority, issued commands to put the Bab to death. This befell in  brief as follows. The governor of A_dh_irbayjan, Prince Hamzih Mirza, was  unwilling that the execution of this sentence should be at his hands, and  said to the brother of the Amir, Mirza Hasan _Kh_an, \"This is a vile  business and an easy one; anyone is capable and competent. I had imagined  that His Excellency the Regent would commission me to make war on the  Afghans or Uzbegs or appoint me to attack and invade the territory of  Russia or Turkey.\" So Mirza Hasan _Kh_an wrote his excuse in detail to the  Amir.    Now the Siyyid Bab had disposed all His affairs before setting out from  _Ch_ihriq towards Tabriz, had placed His writings and even His ring and  pen-case in a specially prepared box, put the key of the box in an  envelope, and sent it by means of Mulla Baqir, who was one of His first  associates, to Mulla 'Abdu'l-Karim of Qazvin. This trust Mulla Baqir  delivered over to Mulla 'Abdu'l-Karim at Qum in presence of a numerous  company. At the solicitations of those present he opened the lid of the  box and said, \"I am commanded to convey this trust to Baha'u'llah: more  than this ask not of me, for I cannot tell you.\" Importuned by the  company, he produced a long epistle in blue, penned in the most graceful  manner with the utmost delicacy and firmness in a beautiful minute  _sh_ikastih hand, written in the shape of a man so closely that it would  have been imagined that it was a single wash of ink on the paper. When  they had read this epistle [they perceived that] He had produced three  hundred and sixty derivatives from the word Baha. Then Mulla 'Abdu'l-Karim  conveyed the trust to its destination.    Well, we must return to our original narrative. The Prime Minister issued  a second order to his brother Mirza Hasan _Kh_an, the gist of which order  was this: \"Obtain a formal and explicit sentence from the learned doctors  of Tabriz who are the firm support of the Church of Ja'far (upon him be  peace) and the impregnable stronghold of the _Sh_i'ite faith; summon the  Christian regiment of Urumiyyih; suspend the Bab before all the people;  and give orders for the regiment to fire a volley.\"    Mirza Hasan _Kh_an summoned his chief of the farra_sh_es, and gave him his  instructions. They removed the Bab's turban and sash which were the signs  of His Siyyid-hood, brought Him with four of His followers to the barrack  square of Tabriz, confined Him in a cell, and appointed forty of the  Christian soldiers of Tabriz to guard Him.    Next day the chief of the farra_sh_es delivered over the Bab and a young  man named Aqa Muhammad-'Ali who was of a noble family of Tabriz to Sam  _Kh_an, colonel of the Christian regiment of Urumiyyih, at the sentences  of the learned divine Mulla Muhammad of Mamaqan, of the second  ecclesiastical authority Mulla Mirza Baqir, and of the third  ecclesiastical authority Mulla Murtada-Quli and others. An iron nail was  hammered into the middle of the staircase of the very cell wherein they  were imprisoned, and two ropes were hung down. By one rope the Bab was  suspended and by the other rope Aqa Muhammad-'Ali, both being firmly bound  in such wise that the head of that young man was on the Bab's breast. The  surrounding housetops billowed with teeming crowds. A regiment of soldiers  ranged itself in three files. The first file fired; then the second file,  and then the third file discharged volleys. From the fire of these volleys  a mighty smoke was produced. When the smoke cleared away they saw that  young man standing and the Bab seated by the side of His amanuensis Aqa  Siyyid Husayn in the very cell from the staircase of which they had  suspended them. To neither one of them had the slightest injury resulted.    Sam _Kh_an the Christian asked to be excused; the turn of service came to  another regiment, and the chief of the farra_sh_es withheld his hand. Aqa  Jan Big of _Kh_amsih, colonel of the bodyguard, advanced; and they again  bound the Bab together with that young man to the same nail. The Bab  uttered certain words which those few who knew Persian understood, while  the rest heard but the sound of His voice.    The colonel of the regiment appeared in person: and it was before noon on  the twenty-eighth day of _Sh_a'ban in the year [A.H.] one thousand two  hundred and sixty-six.(14) Suddenly he gave orders to fire. At this volley  the bullets produced such an effect that the breasts [of the victims] were  riddled, and their limbs were completely dissected, except their faces,  which were but little marred.    Then they removed those two bodies from the square to the edge of the moat  outside the city, and that night they remained by the edge of the moat.  Next day the Russian consul came with an artist and took a picture of  those two bodies in"]]]
