One day he caught sight of  the handsome Italian girl, with bare feet in the sand, red skirt tightly  pleated around her, and unbleached linen sleeves tucked up to the  shoulders, catching eels out of a large gleaming wet net. The silvery  scales glistening through the meshes full of water, the golden river  and scarlet petticoat, the beautiful black eyes deep and pensive, which  seemed darkened in their musing by the surrounding sunlight struck the  artist, perhaps even rather trivially, like some coloured print on the  titlepage of a song in a music-seller's window.    [Illustration: p060-071]    It so chanced that the girl was heart-whole, having till now bestowed  her affections on a big tom-cat, yellow and sly, also a great fisher of  eels, who bristled up all over when anyone approached his mistress.    [Illustration: p061-072]    Beasts and men, our lover managed to tame all these folk, was married at  Santa-Maria of the Transtevera and brought back to France the beautiful  Assunta and her _cato_.    Ah! poor fellow, he ought also to have brought away at the same time  some of the sunlight of that country, a scrap of the blue sky, the  eccentric costume and the bulrushes of the Tiber, and the large swing  nets of the _Ponte Rotto_; in fact the frame with the picture. Then he  would have been spared the cruel disenchantment he experienced when,  having settled in a modest flat on the fourth storey, on the heights of  Montmartre, he saw his handsome Transteverina decked out in a crinoline,  a flounced dress, and a Parisian bonnet, which, constantly out of  balance on the top of her heavy braids, assumed the most independent  attitudes. Under the clear cold light of Parisian skies, the unfortunate  man soon perceived that his wife was a fool, an irretrievable fool. Not  a single idea even lurked in the velvety depths of those beautiful black  eyes, lost in infinite contemplation. They glittered like an animal's  in the calm of digestion, or in a chance gleam of light, nothing more.  Withal the lady was common, vulgar, accustomed to govern by a slap all  the little world of her native hut, and the least opposition threw her  into uncontrollable rages.    Who would have guessed that the fine mouth, straitened by silence into  the purest shape of an antique face, would suddenly open to let flow  torrents of vulgar abuse? Without respect for herself or for him, out  loud, in the street, at the theatre, she would pick a quarrel with him,  and indulge in scenes of fearful jealousy. To crown all, devoid of  any artistic feeling, she was completely ignorant of her husband's  profession and language, of manners, in fact of everything. The little  French she could be taught, only made her forget Italian, and the result  was that she composed a kind of half and half jargon which had the most  comical effect. In short this love story, begun like one of Lamartine's  poems, was ending like a novel of Champfleury's. After having for a long  time struggled to civilise this wild woman, the poet saw he must abandon  the task. Too honourable to leave her, probably still too much in love,  he made up his mind to shut himself up, see no one, and work hard. The  few intimate friends he admitted to his house, saw that they embarrassed  him and ceased to come.    [Illustration: p064-075]    Hence it was that for the last fifteen years he had been living boxed up  in his household like in a leper's cell.    As I pondered over this wretched existence, I watched the strange couple  walking before me. He, slender, tall and round-shouldered.    [Illustration: p065-076]    She, squarely built, heavy, shaking her shawl by an impatient shrug  of her shoulders, with a free gait like a man's. She was tolerably  cheerful, her speech was loud, and from time to time she turned round to  see if we followed, familiarly shouting and calling by name those of us  she happened to know, accentuating her words by much gesticulation as  she would have hailed a fishing boat on the Tiber. When we reached their  house, the _concierge_, furious at seeing so noisy a crew at such an  unearthly hour, tried to prevent our entry. The Italian and he had a  fearful row on the staircase. We were all dotted about on the winding  stairs dimly lighted by the dying gas, ill at ease, uncomfortable,  hardly knowing if we ought not to come down again.    \"Come, quick, let us go up,\" said the poet in a low tone, and we  followed him silently, while, leaning over the banisters that shook  under her weight and anger, the Italian let fly a volley of abuse in  which Roman imprecations alternated with the vocabulary of the  back slums. What a return home for the poet who had just roused the  admiration of artistic Paris, and still retained in his fevered eyes  the dazzling intoxication of his first performance! What a humiliating  recall to every-day life!    It was only by the fireside in his little sitting room that the icy  chill caused by this silly adventure was dispelled, and we should soon  have completely forgotten it, had it not been for the piercing voice and  bursts of laughter of the signora whom we heard in the kitchen telling  her maid how soundly she had rated that _choulato!_ When the table was  laid and supper ready, she came and seated herself amongst us, having  taken off her shawl, bonnet and veil, and I was able to examine her at  my leisure. She was no longer handsome. The square face, the broad heavy  jaw, the coarse hair turning grey, and above all the vulgar expression  of the mouth, contrasted singularly with the eternal and meaningless  reverie of the dreamy gaze. Resting her elbows on the table, familiar  and shapeless, she joined in the conversation without for an instant  losing sight of her plate. Just over her head, proud amid all the  melancholy rubbish of the drawing-room, a large portrait signed by an  illustrious name, stood out of the surrounding shade,--it was Maria  Assunta at twenty. The purple costume, the milky white of the pleated  wimple, the bright gold of the over-abundant imitation jewelry, set off  magnificently the brilliancy of a sunny complexion, the velvety shades  of the thick hair growing low on the forehead, which seemed to be united  by an almost imperceptible down to the superb and straight line of  the eyebrows. How could such an exuberance of life and beauty have  deteriorated and become such a mass of vulgarity? And curiously while  the Transteverina talked, I interrogated her lovely eyes, so deep and  soft on the canvas.    [Illustration: p068-079]    The excitement of the meal had put her in a good humour. To cheer up  the poet, to whom his mingled failure and glory were doubly painful,  she thumped him on the back, laughed with her mouth full, saying in her  hideous jargon, that it was not worth while for such a trifle to fling  oneself head downwards from the _campanile del Duomo_.    [Illustration: p069-080]    \"Isn't it true, _il cato?_\" she added turning to the old tom-cat  crippled by rheumatism, snoring in front of the fire. Then suddenly, in  the middle of an interesting discussion, she screamed out to her husband  in a voice senseless and brutal as the crack of a rifle:    \"Hey! artist! _la lampo qui filo!_\"    The poor fellow immediately interrupted his conversation to wind up the  lamp, humble, submissive, anxious to avoid the scene he dreaded, and  which in spite of all, he did not escape.    On returning from the theatre we had stopped at the _Maison d'Or_ to get  a bottle of choice wine to wash down the _estoufato_. All along the road  Maria Assunta had piously carried it under her shawl, and on her arrival  she had placed it on the table where she could cast tender looks upon  it, for Roman women are fond of good wine. Already twice or three times  mistrustful of her husband's absence of mind, and the length of his  arms, she had said:    \"Mind the _boteglia_--you're going to break it.\"    At last, as she went off to the kitchen to take up with her own hands  the famous _estoufato_, she again called out to him:    \"Whatever you do, don't break the _boteglia_.\"    Unluckily, the moment his wife had disappeared, the poet seized the  opportunity to talk about art, theatres, success, so freely and with so  much gusto and vivacity, that--crash! By a gesture more eloquent than  the others, the wonderful bottle was thrown down and fell to the ground  in a thousand pieces. Never have I beheld such terror. He stopped short,  and became deadly pale. At the same moment, Assunta's contralto was  heard in the next room, and the Italian appeared on the threshold with  flashing eyes, lips swollen with rage, red with the heat of the kitchen  range.    \"The _boteglia!_\" she roared in a terrible voice.    Then timidly bending down to me, he whispered:    \"Say it's you.\"    And the poor devil was so frightened, that I felt his long legs tremble  under the table.    [Illustration: p075-086]          A COUPLE OF SINGERS.    How could they help falling in love? Handsome and famous as they both  were, singing in the same operas, living each night during five whole  acts the same artificial and passionate existence. You cannot play with  fire without being burnt. You cannot say twenty times a month: \"I love  you!\" to the sighing of a flute or the tremolos of a violin, without at  last being caught by the emotion of your own voice. In course of time,  passion awoke in the surrounding harmonies, the rhythmical surprises,  the gorgeousness of costume and scenery. It was wafted to them through  the window that Elsa and Lohengrin threw wide open on a night vibrating  with sound and luminousness:    \"Come let us breathe the intoxicating perfumes.\"    It slipped in between the white columns of the Capulets' balcony,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22523"],[0,"The History of the American Expedition Fighting the Bolsheviki (#5)"],[1,"the men stood  guard in the drizzly rain in water up to their knees and between  listening post tricks labored to cut branches enough to build up a dry  platform for rest. The veteran French soldier had built him a fire at  each post to dry his socks and breeches legs, but \"the strict old  disciplinarian,\" Major Young, ordered \"No fires on the outpost.\"    And this was war. Far up the railroad track \"at the military crest\" an  outpost trench was dug in strict accordance with army book plans. The  first night we had a casualty, a painful wound in a doughboy's leg from  the rifle of a sentry who cried halt and fired at the same time. An  officer and party on a handcar had been rattling in from a visit to the  front outguard. All the surrounding roads and trails were patrolled.    Armed escorts went with British intelligence officers to outlying  villages to assemble the peasants and tell them why the soldiers were  coming into North Russia and enlist their civil co-operation and inspire  them to enlist their young men in the Slavo-British Allied Legion, that  is to put on brass buttoned khaki, eat British army rations, and drill  for the day when they should go with the Allies to clear the country of  the detested Bolsheviki. To the American doughboys it did not seem as  though the peasants' wearied-of-war countenances showed much elation  nor much inclination to join up.    The inhabitants of Obozerskaya had fled for the most part before the  Reds. Some of the men and women had been forced to go with the Red  Guards. They now crept back into their villages, stolidly accepted the  occupancy of their homes by the Americans, hunted up their horses which  they had driven into the wilderness to save them from the plundering  Bolo, greased up their funny looking little droskies, or carts, and  began hauling supplies for the Allied command and begging tobacco from  the American soldiers.    Captain Donoghue with two platoons of \"K\" Company, the other two having  been dropped temporarily at Issaka Gorka to guard that railroad repair  shop and wireless station, now moved right out by order of Colonel  Guard, on September seventh, on a trail leading off toward Tiogra and  Seletskoe. Somewhere in the wilds he would find traces of or might  succor the handful of American sailors and Scots who, under Col.  Hazelden, a British officer, had been cornered by the Red Guards.    \"Reece, reece,\" said the excited drosky driver as he greedily accepted  his handful of driver's rations. He had not seen rice for three years.  Thankfully he took the food. His family left at home would also learn  how to barter with the generous doughboy for his tobacco and bully beef  and crackers, which at times, very rarely of course, in the advanced  sectors, he was lucky enough to exchange for handfuls of vegetables that  the old women plucked out of their caches in the rich black mould of the  small garden, or from a cellar-like hole under a loose board in the log  house.    \"Guard duty at Archangel\" was aiming now to be a real war, on a small  scale but intensive. Obozerskaya, about one hundred miles south of  Archangel, in a few days took on the appearance of an active field base  for aggressive advance on the enemy. Here were the rapid assembling of  fighting units; of transport and supply units; of railroad repairing  crews, Russian, under British officers; of signals; of armored  automobile, our nearest approach to a tank, which stuck in the mud and  broke through the frail Russki bridges and was useless; of the feverish  clearing and smoothing of a landing field near the station for our  supply of spavined air-planes that had already done their bit on the  Western Front; of the improvement of our ferocious-looking armored  train, with its coal-car mounted naval guns, buttressed with sand bags  and preceded by a similar car bristling with machine guns and Lewis  automatics in the hands of a motley crew of Polish gunners and Russki  gunners and a British sergeant or two. This armored train was under the  command of the blue-coated, one-armed old commander Young, hero of the  Zeebrugge Raid, who parked his train every night on the switch track  next to the British Headquarters car, the Blue Car with the Union Jack  flying over it and the whole Allied force. Secretly, he itched to get  his armored train into point-blank engagement with the Bolshevik armored  train.    \"All patrols must be aggressive,\" directed a secret order of Col. Guard,  the British officer commanding this \"A\" Force on the railroad, \"and it  must be impressed on all ranks that we are fighting an offensive war,  and not a defensive one, although for the time being it is the duty of  everybody to get the present area in a sound state of defense. All posts  must be held to the last as we do not intend to give up any ground which  we have made good.\"    And within a week after landing in Russia the American soldier was  indeed making head on an offensive campaign, for on September 11th two  platoons of \"M\" Company reconnoitering in force met a heavy force of  Bolos on similar mission and fought the first engagement with the Red  Guards, driving the Reds from the station at Verst 466 and taking  possession of the bridge at Verst 464.    We had ridden out past the outguard on the armored train, left it and  proceeded along the railway. Remember that first Bolo shell? Well, yes.  That thing far down the straight track three miles away Col. Guard,  before going to the rear, derisively told Lieut. Danley could not be a  Bolo armored train but was a sawmill smoke stack. Suddenly it flashed.  Then came the distant boom. Came then the whining, twist-whistling shell  that passed over us and showered shrapnel near the trenches where lay  our reserves. He shortened his range but we hurried on and closed with  his infantry with the decision in the American doughboy's favor in his  first fight. He had learned that it takes many shrapnel shells and  bullets to hit one man, that to be hit is not necessarily to be killed.    A few days later \"L\" Company supported in the nick of time by two  platoons of \"I\" Company repulsed a savage counter-attack staged by the  Red Guards, September 16th, on a morning that followed the capture of a  crashing Red bombing plane in the evening and the midnight conflagration  in \"L\" Company's fortified camp that might have been misinterpreted as  an evacuation by the Bolo. In this engagement Lieut. Gordon B. Reese and  his platoon of \"I\" Company marked themselves with distinction by  charging the Reds as a last resort when ammunition had been exhausted in  a vain attempt to gain fire superiority against the overwhelming and  enveloping Red line, and gave the Bolshevik soldiers a sample of the  fighting spirit of the Americans. And the Reds broke and ran. Also our  little graveyard of brave American soldiers at Obozerskaya began to  grow.    It was the evening before when the Bolo airman, who had dropped two  small bombs at the Americans at Obozerskaya, was obliged to volplane to  earth on the railroad near the 464 outguard. Major Young was there at  the time. He declared the approaching bomb-plane by its markings was  certainly an Allied plane, ordered the men not to discharge their Lewis  gun which they had trained upon it, and as the Bolos hit the dirt two  hundred yards away, he rushed out shouting his command, which afterwards  became famous, \"Don't fire! We are Americans.\" But the Bolo did not  \"pahneemahya\" and answered with his own Lewis gun sending the impetuous  American officer to cover where he lay even after the Bolo had darted  into the woods and the doughboys ran up and pulled the moss off their  battalion commander whom they thought had been killed by the short burst  of the Bolo's automatic fire, as the major had not arisen to reply with  his trusty six shooter.    Meanwhile \"K\" Company had met the enemy on the Seletskoe-Kodish front as  will be related later, and plans were being laid for a converging attack  by the Kodish, Onega and Railroad columns upon Plesetskaya. \"L\" Company  was sent to support \"K\" Company and the Railroad Force marked time till  the other two columns could get into position for the joint drive.  Machine gun men and medical men coming to us from Archangel brought  unverified stories of fighting far up the Dvina and Onega Rivers where  the Bolshevik was gathering forces for a determined stand and had caused  the digging of American graves and the sending back to Archangel of  wounded men. This is told elsewhere. Our patrols daily kept in contact  with Red Guard outposts on the railroad, occasionally bringing in  wounded Bolos or deserters, who informed us of intrenchments and armored  trains and augmenting Bolshevik regiments.    Our Allied force of Cossacks proved unreliable and officer's patrols of  Americans served better but owing to lack of maps or guides were able to  gain but little information of the forest trails of the area. British  intelligence officers depending on old forester's maps and on deserters  and prisoners and neutral natives allowed the time for \"Pat Rooney's  work,\" personal reconnaissance, to go by till one day, September 28th,  General Finlayson arrived at Obozerskaya in person at noon and  peremptorily ordered an advance to be started that afternoon on the  enemy's works at Versts 458 and 455. Col. Sutherland was caught  unprepared but had to obey.    Calling up one company of the resting French troops under the veteran  African fighter, Captain Alliez, for support, Col. Sutherland asked  Major Young to divide his two American companies into two detachments  for making the flank marches and attacks upon the Red positions. The  marches to be made to position in the afternoon and night and the  attacks to were be put on at dawn. The armored train and other guns  manned by the Poles were to give a barrage on the frontal positions as  soon as the American soldiers had opened their surprise flank and"]]]
