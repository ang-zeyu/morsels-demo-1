To be sure, Rusty knew that she  was a prisoner in her own house; for it was plain that she dared not  leave it so long as Miss Kitty Cat stayed on the roof, ready to grab  Mrs. Wren the moment she stepped out of her doorway.    \"Your wife is very shy,\" Miss Kitty remarked to Rusty Wren with a sly  smile. \"I've been hoping to get more acquainted with her. That's why I  climbed up and sat on your roof. When people are shy and don't invite  me inside their houses I believe in making myself at home outside, while  I wait for them to appear.\"    From her doorway Mrs. Wren called to her husband, \"Don't let her deceive  you with her pretty talk! Remember what I told you! She's  mealy-mouthed.... If you had seen her trying to reach her paw through  the door you'd know how dangerous she is.\"    \"There!\" said Miss Kitty Cat with a sigh. \"People never seem to  understand my ways. I was only trying to shake hands!\"    \"With her claws!\" cried the muffled voice of Rusty Wren's wife. \"Ugh!  She's a wicked creature if ever there was one.\"    \"Go away!\" Rusty Wren scolded. \"Get off my roof! Get out of my cherry  tree!\"    By this time feathered neighbors of the Wren family were arriving from  all directions. They didn't hesitate to call Miss Kitty Cat names. And  some of them even darted quite near her, as if they meant to peck her  eyes out.    Miss Kitty began to have a worried look.    \"Goodness! Where do they all live?\" she asked herself. \"I had no idea  there were so many birds around here. There's better hunting than I  supposed.\"    Try as they would, the birds couldn't budge Miss Kitty Cat from the top  of Rusty's house. He was frantic, poor fellow!    \"I don't know what to do,\" he wailed. \"My wife will starve in there--and  the children, too.\"    Just then little Mr. Chippy came hurrying up to him.    \"Don't worry!\" Mr. Chippy cried. \"He's coming! He's on the way now; and  he can get you out of your trouble if anybody can.\"    Miss Kitty Cat pricked up her ears. She couldn't help hearing what Mr.  Chippy said.    \"I shall stay right where I am,\" she declared. \"Nobody can make me  move.\"    She had scarcely finished speaking when a most unexpected sound startled  her.    It was \"_Meaow!_\"          XIV    CATCALLS      PERCHED on top of Rusty Wren's tin house, Miss Kitty Cat had been  enjoying herself thoroughly, while the birds made a great how-dy-do and  tried in vain to frighten her away.    When she heard all at once an unexpected _meaow_ she showed that it  startled her.    \"A cat!\" cried Miss Kitty. \"I didn't suppose there was another cat for  miles around.\" She looked about on all sides, on the ground and in the  tree-tops. And there was no cat anywhere in sight.    Meanwhile the birds were all exclaiming, \"There! He's here. Now Miss  Kitty Cat had better watch out.\"    Again a strange, mocking catcall sounded from somewhere. There was a  sort of jeer about it that aroused Miss Kitty Cat's anger.    \"He's come, has he?\" she exclaimed to little Mr. Chippy, who chattered  at her from a good, safe distance. \"If he's looking for a fight I'd be  pleased to have him come and get it.\"    Whoever the stranger was, and wherever he was, he knew how to tease Miss  Kitty Cat. Now he howled at her from the thicket of lilac bushes on the  edge of the flower garden. Now he mewed at her from the hedge in front  of the farmhouse. And though Miss Kitty Cat tried to get a glimpse of  him, she couldn't see anything that even faintly resembled a cat.    The annoying cries moved from one place to another. She was sure of  that. But the one that made them managed to stay hidden.    \"This is queer!\" Miss Kitty Cat said to herself. \"Can it be that there's  a cat's voice around here, and nothing more? A cat without a voice  wouldn't be so strange. But a voice without a cat--that's the oddest  thing I ever heard of!\"    At last Rusty Wren seemed to take heart. And his wife, inside their  house, abused Miss Kitty Cat loudly--or as loudly as she could from  inside the tin syrup can.    \"I always knew you were a coward,\" she told Miss Kitty. \"You're always  ready to attack us small people. But you don't dare fight anybody of  your own size.\"    \"How can I fight a person that I can't see?\" Miss Kitty asked. \"If this  noisy stranger would come out in the open I'd soon show you whether I'd  fight him or not. I'd teach him--if I could get hold of him--not to come  here and interfere when I'm making a neighborly call.\"    \"Nonsense!\" cried Mrs. Wren. \"You don't mean half you say. If you  weren't a fraud you'd go and find this person that's jeering at you.\"    _\"Meaow-ow-ow!\"_ Again that mocking call grated on Miss Kitty's ears.    \"There!\" Mrs. Wren exclaimed. \"There it is again. It would make me  pretty angry to be talked to like that. But I don't suppose it bothers  you. Probably you're used to having people caterwaul at you.\"    That was a little more than Miss Kitty Cat could stand. She scrambled  down from the old cherry tree and ran across the yard to the row of  currant bushes, whence the last catcalls had come.    As she drew near, a slim slate-colored bird gave a harsh laugh as he  flew up from the bushes. It was Mr. Catbird. And Miss Kitty Cat felt  sheepish enough when she saw him. She knew that he had succeeded in  fooling her with his mocking cries.    The birds--with Mr. Catbird among them, and Mrs. Wren, too--all gathered  round Miss Kitty and made such a clamor that she crept away and hid in  the haymow. She never could endure much noise, unless she made most of  it herself--by the light Of the moon.          XV    MOUSETRAPS      \"I DON'T understand,\" said old dog Spot to Miss Kitty Cat one day, \"why  Mrs. Green wants to keep you around the house when she can buy  mousetraps at the village.\" Old Spot eyed Miss Kitty slyly. He dearly  loved to watch her whiskers bristle and her tail grow big. And he could  make both those things happen almost any time he wanted to.    If anybody wished to see Miss Kitty Cat turn up her nose he had only to  mention mousetraps. Of all worthless junk she thought they were the  worst.    \"They can't catch any but the dull-witted mice,\" she used to say. \"A  mouse that knows anything won't go near a trap unless he's hungry. If he  wants to go to a little trouble to get a piece of stale cheese he can  usually spring the trap without getting caught in it--even if he has to  use his tail to do it.\"    \"But a mousetrap,\" Spot objected, \"is little or no care. One doesn't  have to feed it except when he wants it to catch a mouse. And everybody  knows that Mrs. Green feeds you several times a day. Besides, the fewer  mice you catch, the more food she has to waste on you.\"    \"Rubbish!\" Miss Kitty Cat sniffed. \"You eat ten times as much as I do.  And I never heard of your catching a mouse, either.\"    \"Ah!\" said Spot. \"Don't forget that I drive the cows and watch the house  and the barns at night. And during my spare moments I hunt woodchucks.  You couldn't expect a person of my importance to fritter away his  valuable time catching mice. Mousetraps couldn't do my work,\" old dog  Spot continued. \"There never was a mousetrap made that could drive a  cow.\"    \"That's one reason why I don't like them,\" said Miss Kitty Cat. \"They're  not only poor at catching mice, but they're useless at anything else.  Now, whenever I capture a mouse I always make matters as pleasant as  possible for, him. I always play with him for as long a time as I can  spare. But a trap just goes _snap_! A trap doesn't seem to _want_ to  make friends with anybody.\"    Old dog Spot laughed right in Miss Kitty's face.    \"Much you care for your friends the mice!\" he chuckled. \"And much they  care for you! If you knew what they call you, you'd be pretty angry.\"    \"What's that?\" Miss Kitty demanded.    \"I don't want to tell you,\" said Spot. \"I don't want to hurt your  feelings.\" He knew (the rogue) that he could tease Miss Kitty more by  leaving her to wonder what name the mice had for her.    Much as she wanted to know it, Miss Kitty Cat was too proud and haughty  to ask him again. And, jumping up suddenly, she walked stiffly away.    \"I shall have to find a mouse somewhere,\" she muttered under her breath.  \"I shall have to find a mouse somewhere and make him tell me what old  Spot won't.\"          XVI    A MIDNIGHT MEAL      DOWN in the cellar of the farmhouse a fat couple known as Mr. and Mrs.  Moses Mouse crept out of a hole under the pantry floor and ran down a  post to the cellar bottom.    \"Things have come to a pretty pass!\" Mr. Mouse grumbled. \"Mrs. Green  never did leave more than a crumb or two in the pantry where a fellow  could get it. And since Miss Snooper came to live here there's less to  eat than ever.\"    Mrs. Mouse nodded her head somewhat dolefully.    \"Do you remember, Moses,\" she said to her husband, \"what delicious bits  of stale cheese Mrs. Green used to serve for us here in the cellar,  stuck on a short piece of wire? To be sure, she was somewhat  thoughtless--the way she left that dangerous loop caught back, so it  would snap over and catch you behind the ears if you weren't careful.  But you were always very skillful at avoiding that.\"    \"Ah! Those were happy days--or, I should say, _nights_!\" Mr. Mouse  exclaimed with a sigh. \"It makes me sad just to think of that fine, old,  stale, moldy cheese.\"    \"I suppose Mrs. Green gives it all to that horrid Miss Snooper now,\"  said Mrs. Mouse, as she climbed to a shelf and looked at the labels on  several jars of jam and jelly that stood there in a row.    Moses Mouse watched her hopefully. Being quite plump, he was a bit  lazy. And he did not care to scramble up to a shelf for nothing.    \"There isn't one without a cover, is there?\" he inquired.    \"No!\" his wife replied.    \"There isn't one with a little sweetness oozing down the side of it, is  there?\" he asked her.    \"No!\" said Mrs. Mouse. \"Not one! I suppose Miss Snooper"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21081"],[0,"Scientific  American, Volume XLIII., No. 25, December 18, 1880 (#5)"],[1," locomotive.    It is, perhaps, needless to mention the advantages a motor of this kind  possesses over the steam locomotive. The absence of smoke and noise  renders it particularly desirable for tunnels, elevated roads, and, in  fact, for any city railroad.    Further information in regard to this important invention may be  obtained by addressing Mr. R. Ten Broeck, at the Windsor Hotel, New  York.           *       *       *       *       *          TELEGRAPH WIRES UNDERGROUND.      Philadelphia newspapers report that the American Union Telegraph  Company are about to try in that city the experiment of putting their  wires underground. The plan works well enough in European cities, and  there would seem to be no reason why it should not succeed here, save  the indisposition of the companies to bear the first cost of making the  change. For some months the Western Union Telegraph Company has had the  matter under consideration, but will probably wait until pressed by a  rival company before it undertakes the more serious task of taking down  its forest of poles and sinking the wires which contribute so much to  the prevailing ugliness of our streets. Sooner or later the poles and  wires must come down; and it is altogether probable that the change will  be beneficial to the companies in the long run, owing to the smaller  cost of maintaining a subterranean system. It will certainly be an  advantage to the community.           *       *       *       *       *          IMPROVED SAFETY NUT.      That a safety nut so simple and so obviously efficient as the one shown  in the annexed engraving should be among the recent inventions in this  line instead of being among the first, is a curious example of the  manner in which inventors often overlook the simplest means of  accomplishing an end. The principle on which this nut operates will be  understood by reference to the engraving. Two nuts are represented on  each bolt, simply for the purpose of showing the difference between the  nut when loose and when screwed down. In practice only one nut is  required to each bolt.    The square nut shown in Fig. 1 is concaved on its under side, so that it  touches its bearings only at the corners and in the outer face of the  nut there are two slots at right angles to each other. When this nut is  screwed home the outer portion is contracted so as to clamp the bolt  tightly.    The hexagonal nut shown in Fig. 2 has but a single transverse slot, and  the nut is made concave on the under surface, so that when the nut is  screwed home it will contract the outer portion and so clamp the bolt.    This nut may be removed and replaced by means of the wrench, but it will  not become accidentally loosened, and the bolt to which it is applied  will always remain tight, as the nut possesses a certain amount of  elasticity. The action of this nut is such as to prevent stripping the  threads of either bolt or nut.    As only one nut is used with each bolt, and as no washer or other extra  appliance is required, it is obvious that a great saving is effected by  this invention.    We are informed that several of the leading railroads have adopted this  nut, and use it on the tracks, engines, cars, and machinery. The Atwood  Safety Nut Company manufacture this article in a variety of forms.    [Illustration: THE ATWOOD SAFETY NUT.]    Further information may be obtained by addressing J. W. Labaree,  Secretary and Treasurer, Room 2, Agawam Bank Building, Springfield,  Mass.           *       *       *       *       *          PETROLEUM PROSPECTS.      The total oil production of the Pennsylvania oil regions for the month  of October was 2,094,608 barrels. The conditions in the producing field  are gradually giving warrant for permanently higher prices of crude. The  confidence of the trade is daily becoming more fixed in the definiteness  and limit of the Bradford field, as the last of the several \"rich  streaks\" in the region are being worked.    We entertain an increased belief that the coming year will exhibit a  continued falling off in the volume of production, notwithstanding all  the modern improvements in drilling and the great energy with which they  are employed.    For the past few weeks the markets of both crude and refined seem to  have been rigorously and artificially held by the refining interest. The  refined has been quoted at 12 cts. for four weeks without change--and as  a consequence the exporter has taken oil very sparingly. The exports of  last year to November 1, as compared with the exports of this year to  November 1, show a decrease of 1,269,646 barrels in crude equivalent.  The falling off of production, taken together with the increased demand  which must result from the present reluctance of exporters, unite in  warranting us in the belief above expressed, in enhanced prices for the  coming year.    Our figures show a decrease in production for last month, compared with  the preceding month, of 933 barrels per day, notwithstanding the number  of wells drilled was slightly greater than in the preceding month. It  will be noticed, too, that the average per well of the new wells for  last month is a little less than that of the new wells for the month  before, besides, it is generally recognized that the force of the gas in  the region is gradually becoming less, and pumping is more commonly  resorted to. As nearly as we can ascertain, about one-eighth of all the  wheels of the Bradford region are now pumping. We believe, however, on  the whole, judging the character of the Bradford producing field, that  the falling off of production will be quite gradual. Our reason for this  is that the Bradford field is essentially different from its  predecessor--the Butler field. The wells in the Butler field were often  close together, many of them were very large and fell off rapidly; while  the wells of the Bradford region are smaller, farther apart, much  greater in number, have a greater area from which to draw oil, and  consequently decline very much more slowly.--_Stowell's Reporter_.           *       *       *       *       *          TOOL FOR DRIVING AND CLINCHING NAILS.      A novel method of making a nail hole and driving and clinching the nail  is shown in the annexed engraving. The instrument for making the hole  has a notched end which leaves a ridge in the center of the hole at the  bottom. The nail driving tool consists of a socket provided with a  suitable handle, and containing a follower which rests upon the head of  the nail to be driven, and receives the blows of the hammer in the  operation of driving the nail. The nail is split for one half its  length, and the two arms thus formed are slightly separated at the  point, so that when they meet the ridge at the bottom of the hole they  will be still further separated and will clinch in the body of the wood.    [Illustration: TOOL FOR DRIVING AND CLINCHING NAILS.]    This invention was recently patented by Mr. Charles P. Ball, of  Danville, Ky.           *       *       *       *       *          AUTOMATIC BALANCE ATTACHMENT FOR VALVES.      It is well known that in all air compressors and water pumps the  pressure in cylinder of air compressors or in working barrel or cylinder  of pumps is much greater at the point of opening the delivery valves  than the actual pressure in the air receivers of compressors or in water  column of pumps because of the difference in area between the top and  bottom of delivery valves. In some air compressors a hundred and  twenty-five pounds pressure to the square inch is required in the  cylinder to eighty pounds in the receiver, and in some instances a  hundred pounds pressure is required in the cylinder to eighty pounds  pressure in the receiver or column.    The engraving shows an invention designed to remedy this defect in air  compressors and pumps, to provide a device which will enable the  compressors and pumps to operate with equal pressure on both sides of  the delivery valve.    The invention consists of an auxiliary valve arranged outside of the  cylinder, where it is not subjected to back pressure, and connected with  the delivery valve by a hollow valve stem.    In the engraving, which is a sectional view, the cylinder of an air  compressor is represented, on the end of which there is a ring  containing delivery ports, through which the air from the cylinder is  forced into a receiver or conducting pipe. This ring is provided with an  inner flange or valve seat on which rests the delivery valve. These  parts are similar to those seen in some of the air compressors in common  use, and with this construction and arrangement one hundred pounds  pressure to the square inch in the cylinder is required to open the  valve against eighty pounds pressure in the receiver or in the  conducting pipes.    [Illustration: AUTOMATIC BALANCE ATTACHMENT FOR DELIVERY VALVES OF AIR  COMPRESSORS AND WATER PUMPS.]    A drum having an open end is connected with the cylinder head by  inclined standards, and contains a piston connected with the valve by  means of a rod that extends centrally through the cylinder head. On the  outer end of this rod is screwed an adjusting nut, by means of which the  piston may be adjusted. This rod is bored longitudinally, establishing  communication between the compressor cylinder and the drum containing  the piston.    It will be seen that the upper face of the piston is exposed so as to be  subjected to atmospheric pressure only, and when the compressor is in  operation a portion of the air in the compressor cylinder passes through  the hollow rod into the space beneath the piston, and there exerts  sufficient pressure, in combination with the pressure on the inner face  of the valve, to open the valve against an equal pressure in the  receiver or conducting pipes, so that when the pressure in the cylinder  equals the pressure in the receivers the valve is opened and held in  place until the piston"]]]
