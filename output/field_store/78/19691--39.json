The Dominant Primordial Beast      The dominant primordial beast was strong in Buck, and under the fierce  conditions of trail life it grew and grew. Yet it was a secret growth.  His newborn cunning gave him poise and control. He was too busy  adjusting himself to the new life to feel at ease, and not only did  he not pick fights, but he avoided them whenever possible. A certain  deliberateness characterized his attitude. He was not prone to rashness  and precipitate action; and in the bitter hatred between him and Spitz  he betrayed no impatience, shunned all offensive acts.    On the other hand, possibly because he divined in Buck a dangerous  rival, Spitz never lost an opportunity of showing his teeth. He even  went out of his way to bully Buck, striving constantly to start the  fight which could end only in the death of one or the other. Early in  the trip this might have taken place had it not been for an unwonted  accident. At the end of this day they made a bleak and miserable camp  on the shore of Lake Le Barge. Driving snow, a wind that cut like a  white-hot knife, and darkness had forced them to grope for a camping  place. They could hardly have fared worse. At their backs rose a  perpendicular wall of rock, and Perrault and Francois were compelled to  make their fire and spread their sleeping robes on the ice of the lake  itself. The tent they had discarded at Dyea in order to travel light.  A few sticks of driftwood furnished them with a fire that thawed down  through the ice and left them to eat supper in the dark.    Close in under the sheltering rock Buck made his nest. So snug and warm  was it, that he was loath to leave it when Francois distributed the  fish which he had first thawed over the fire. But when Buck finished his  ration and returned, he found his nest occupied. A warning snarl told  him that the trespasser was Spitz. Till now Buck had avoided trouble  with his enemy, but this was too much. The beast in him roared. He  sprang upon Spitz with a fury which surprised them both, and Spitz  particularly, for his whole experience with Buck had gone to teach him  that his rival was an unusually timid dog, who managed to hold his own  only because of his great weight and size.    Francois was surprised, too, when they shot out in a tangle from the  disrupted nest and he divined the cause of the trouble. \"A-a-ah!\"  he cried to Buck. \"Gif it to heem, by Gar! Gif it to heem, the dirty  t'eef!\"    Spitz was equally willing. He was crying with sheer rage and eagerness  as he circled back and forth for a chance to spring in. Buck was no less  eager, and no less cautious, as he likewise circled back and forth for  the advantage. But it was then that the unexpected happened, the thing  which projected their struggle for supremacy far into the future, past  many a weary mile of trail and toil.    An oath from Perrault, the resounding impact of a club upon a bony  frame, and a shrill yelp of pain, heralded the breaking forth of  pandemonium. The camp was suddenly discovered to be alive with skulking  furry forms,--starving huskies, four or five score of them, who had  scented the camp from some Indian village. They had crept in while Buck  and Spitz were fighting, and when the two men sprang among them with  stout clubs they showed their teeth and fought back. They were crazed  by the smell of the food. Perrault found one with head buried in the  grub-box. His club landed heavily on the gaunt ribs, and the grub-box  was capsized on the ground. On the instant a score of the famished  brutes were scrambling for the bread and bacon. The clubs fell upon them  unheeded. They yelped and howled under the rain of blows, but struggled  none the less madly till the last crumb had been devoured.    In the meantime the astonished team-dogs had burst out of their nests  only to be set upon by the fierce invaders. Never had Buck seen such  dogs. It seemed as though their bones would burst through their skins.  They were mere skeletons, draped loosely in draggled hides, with blazing  eyes and slavered fangs. But the hunger-madness made them terrifying,  irresistible. There was no opposing them. The team-dogs were swept back  against the cliff at the first onset. Buck was beset by three huskies,  and in a trice his head and shoulders were ripped and slashed. The din  was frightful. Billee was crying as usual. Dave and Sol-leks, dripping  blood from a score of wounds, were fighting bravely side by side. Joe  was snapping like a demon. Once, his teeth closed on the fore leg of  a husky, and he crunched down through the bone. Pike, the malingerer,  leaped upon the crippled animal, breaking its neck with a quick flash of  teeth and a jerk, Buck got a frothing adversary by the throat, and was  sprayed with blood when his teeth sank through the jugular. The warm  taste of it in his mouth goaded him to greater fierceness. He flung  himself upon another, and at the same time felt teeth sink into his own  throat. It was Spitz, treacherously attacking from the side.    Perrault and Francois, having cleaned out their part of the camp,  hurried to save their sled-dogs. The wild wave of famished beasts rolled  back before them, and Buck shook himself free. But it was only for a  moment. The two men were compelled to run back to save the grub, upon  which the huskies returned to the attack on the team. Billee, terrified  into bravery, sprang through the savage circle and fled away over the  ice. Pike and Dub followed on his heels, with the rest of the team  behind. As Buck drew himself together to spring after them, out of the  tail of his eye he saw Spitz rush upon him with the evident intention  of overthrowing him. Once off his feet and under that mass of huskies,  there was no hope for him. But he braced himself to the shock of Spitz's  charge, then joined the flight out on the lake.    Later, the nine team-dogs gathered together and sought shelter in the  forest. Though unpursued, they were in a sorry plight. There was not  one who was not wounded in four or five places, while some were wounded  grievously. Dub was badly injured in a hind leg; Dolly, the last husky  added to the team at Dyea, had a badly torn throat; Joe had lost an eye;  while Billee, the good-natured, with an ear chewed and rent to ribbons,  cried and whimpered throughout the night. At daybreak they limped warily  back to camp, to find the marauders gone and the two men in bad tempers.  Fully half their grub supply was gone. The huskies had chewed through  the sled lashings and canvas coverings. In fact, nothing, no matter how  remotely eatable, had escaped them. They had eaten a pair of Perrault's  moose-hide moccasins, chunks out of the leather traces, and even two  feet of lash from the end of Francois's whip. He broke from a mournful  contemplation of it to look over his wounded dogs.    \"Ah, my frien's,\" he said softly, \"mebbe it mek you mad dog, dose many  bites. Mebbe all mad dog, sacredam! Wot you t'ink, eh, Perrault?\"    The courier shook his head dubiously. With four hundred miles of trail  still between him and Dawson, he could ill afford to have madness break  out among his dogs. Two hours of cursing and exertion got the harnesses  into shape, and the wound-stiffened team was under way, struggling  painfully over the hardest part of the trail they had yet encountered,  and for that matter, the hardest between them and Dawson.    The Thirty Mile River was wide open. Its wild water defied the frost,  and it was in the eddies only and in the quiet places that the ice held  at all. Six days of exhausting toil were required to cover those thirty  terrible miles. And terrible they were, for every foot of them was  accomplished at the risk of life to dog and man. A dozen times,  Perrault, nosing the way broke through the ice bridges, being saved by  the long pole he carried, which he so held that it fell each time across  the hole made by his body. But a cold snap was on, the thermometer  registering fifty below zero, and each time he broke through he was  compelled for very life to build a fire and dry his garments.    Nothing daunted him. It was because nothing daunted him that he had been  chosen for government courier. He took all manner of risks, resolutely  thrusting his little weazened face into the frost and struggling on from  dim dawn to dark. He skirted the frowning shores on rim ice that bent  and crackled under foot and upon which they dared not halt. Once, the  sled broke through, with Dave and Buck, and they were half-frozen and  all but drowned by the time they were dragged out. The usual fire was  necessary to save them. They were coated solidly with ice, and the two  men kept them on the run around the fire, sweating and thawing, so close  that they were singed by the flames.    At another time Spitz went through, dragging the whole team after him up  to Buck, who strained backward with all his strength, his fore paws on  the slippery edge and the ice quivering and snapping all around. But  behind him was Dave, likewise straining backward, and behind the sled  was Francois, pulling till his tendons cracked.    Again, the rim ice broke away before and behind, and there was no escape  except up the cliff. Perrault scaled it by a miracle, while Francois  prayed for just that miracle; and with every thong and sled lashing and  the last bit of harness rove into a long rope, the dogs were hoisted,  one by one, to the cliff crest. Francois came up last, after the sled  and load. Then came the search for a place to descend, which descent was  ultimately made by the aid of the rope, and night found them back on the  river with a quarter of a mile to the day's credit.    By the time they made the Hootalinqua and good ice, Buck was played out.  The rest of the dogs were in like condition; but Perrault, to make  up lost time, pushed them late and early.

For in September, 1409, Pope Alexander V, when  making a grant of Indulgences to those who visited and gave alms at the  church on Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, Holy Saturday, and the Feast of  the Assumption, expressly mentions the reconstruction of the Cloisters  and Chapter House by the Prior among the reasons which had induced him  to confer the privilege.    When the monastery was suppressed, the archway leading into the east  cloister from the church was built up, and the doors were taken from  it--in all probability to be transferred (in 1544) to the principal  entrance at the western end of the truncated building.    In the reconstruction attempted by the Dominican Friars, it seems that,  instead of re-opening the cloister-arch to its full extent, they  contented themselves with inserting a smaller doorway within it, the  jambs and lintel of which were discovered in the rubble masonry when the  arch was opened out in 1905. On the suppression of the Dominicans by  Queen Elizabeth, the cloisters passed again into secular hands, and  disappear from history until the year 1742, when there is a record of  the stabling that occupied the ruins till our own day, with the  temporary interruption of a fire in 1830, which brought most of the  eastern side to the ground. The stables were afterwards rebuilt, and  left undisturbed till 1900, when negotiations were opened for the  purchase of the freehold from the owners.    It was not till Michaelmas, 1904, that possession, even of a part,  could be obtained, as there were various leasehold interests to be  reckoned with, and many beneficiaries to be satisfied, whose rights will  not be finally extinguished until June, 1926. But excavation was at once  commenced, and the actual rebuilding in 1905. It need hardly be said  that all that has been discovered of the ancient work, here and  elsewhere, whether above or below ground, has been carefully preserved,  and incorporated (as far as possible _in situ_) into the restoration.

[3] Cottonian MS.     [4] _Ibid._     [5] This Richard de Belmeis (Beauvais) was the first of two       bishops of the same name, and held the See of London for twenty       years (1108-1128).         The name of Rahere, which appears in various forms, suggests a       French origin; and from the fact that it occurs in the       signature, or attestation, of certain documents discovered in       Brittany, as well as from the close relations between the       bishop and the founder of St. Bartholomew's, it is conjectured       that they both came from the same neighbourhood. Otherwise       their joint interest in the foundation at Smithfield is       sufficiently accounted for by the benevolent object and the       situation within the London diocese.         Leland gives the credit of the foundation to Henry I, as having       granted the land out of the royal domain.     [6] The Canons Regular of St. Augustine (of Hippo) are said to       have been founded at Avignon in or about 1061. Their first       establishment in England was at Colchester (_circa_ 1105),       where the picturesque ruins of the Priory Church, dedicated to       St. Botolph, are all that remain of the monastic buildings. The       habit consisted of a black cassock with a white rochet, over       which a black cloak and hood were worn, thus leading to their       familiar name of the Black Canons--not to be confused with the       Black _Friars_, a Dominican Order of mendicants, introduced at       St. Bartholomew's Priory under Queen Mary. From an anecdote       related by Matthew Paris (under the year 1250), and quoted in       most accounts of the Priory, it seems that the inmates, while       recognizing the authority of the Bishop of London, were       extremely jealous of outside interference. The Archbishop of       Canterbury (Boniface of Savoy) had ventured to include St.       Bartholomew's in one of his visitations. He was received with       becoming dignity by the sub-prior, but politely warned against       going beyond his jurisdiction. This so enraged his Grace that       he struck the sub-prior in the face, and, \"with many oaths,\"       rent in pieces the rich cope he was wearing, treading it under       his feet, and thrusting the sub-prior against a pillar of the       chancel with such violence as almost to kill him. A general       conflict followed between the Canons and the Archbishop's       attendants, which was taken up outside and set the whole city       in an uproar.     [7] _Vide_ Dr. Norman Moore's edition from the copy in the       Record Office.     [8] There had been a decline in public interest for some years       before 1691, when the abuses which had grown round the       celebration led to its reduction from fourteen to four days:       but the fair lingered on in a degenerate state till it was last       proclaimed by the Lord Mayor in 1850, and finally ceased in       1855. The live cattle market, so vividly described, with its       attendant nuisances, in the twenty-first chapter of \"Oliver       Twist,\" was closed at the same time, and the business       transferred to the new Caledonian Market. The open pens at       Smithfield have been superseded by covered buildings, to which       the old Newgate Market has been removed, and considerably       developed, for the sale of meat, the slaughtering for the most       part being done locally in the various places whence the       supplies are derived.         The memory of old associations is preserved in the street which       runs along the north side of the church, and still bears the       name of \"Cloth Fair\": and the site of \"Pye Corner,\" where the       great fire of 1666 reached its limit, is marked by a tablet in       the wall, at the entrance to Cock Lane in Giltspur Street, a       short distance to the south-west. The place took its name from       the \"Court of Pie-Powder,\" which was held during the fair here,       as at similar gatherings throughout the country, to deal       expeditiously with disturbers of the peace. The etymology is       traced to the old French _pied pouldre_, with supposed       reference to the dusty feet of pedlars and others who came       before the court--now extinguished in the more modern Petty       Sessions.         A lively description of the fair, in its palmy days, is given       in a tract, printed in 1641 for Richard Harper at the \"Bible       and Harp\" in Smithfield, entitled, \"Bartholomew Fair, or       varieties of fancies, where you may find a faire of wares, and       all to please your mind, with the several enormityes and       misdemeanours which are there seen and heard.\"         Among the more gloomy associations of Smithfield are the       martyrdoms which took place there during the Marian persecution       of 1555-57. Of the victims, John Rogers, John Bradford, and       John Philpot are commemorated in a modern tablet let into the       wall of the hospital facing the square where they suffered. The       church to their memory, referred to in the inscription, is in       St. John Street Road, where it was built as a Chapel-of-Ease to       the parish church of St. John-of-Jerusalem, founded by the       Knights Hospitallers in 1185.     [9] The late Mr. J. H. Parker was inclined to think there was a       tower in each corner (though two only could be represented in       the seal), as was not unusual in France and elsewhere, but       rarely the case in England. (See his lecture delivered in the       church on 13th July, 1863.)    [10] _Vide_ \"Henry VIII and the English Monasteries,\" by the       Rt. Rev. Abbot Gasquet, D.D., O.S.B., for an able statement of       the case for the communities: and an article by G. G. Perry       (\"Eng. Hist. Review,\" April, 1889), on \"Episcopal Visitations       of the Austin Canons,\" for some cases of laxity.    [11] The Dominicans were introduced at St. Bartholomew's in       1556, when their old monastery (dating from 1276), near the       north end of Blackfriars Bridge, was no longer available.       Possibly their work and reputation in making converts may have       had some influence on the choice of the Order, which, moreover,       was governed by the Augustinian rule, adopted (with additions)       by their founder in 1215, and so far brought the community       under the traditions of their predecessors. The members at       Smithfield consisted of English, Spanish, and Belgian friars,       and Fr. William Perrin, O.P., was appointed as their chief.       When he died in 1558, Fr. Richard Hargrave was elected in his       place, but was not allowed to take office, apparently in view       of the suppression which was impending when the Letters Patent       from the General, "]]]
