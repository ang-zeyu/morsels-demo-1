Whether, however, a hog's bristle can turn into a feather or not,  it is vital that you should know the present difference between them.    The scientific people will tell you that a feather is composed of three  parts--the down, the laminae, and the shaft.    But the common-sense method of stating the matter is that a feather is  composed of two parts, a shaft with lateral filaments. For the greater  part of the shaft's length, these filaments are strong and nearly  straight, forming, by their attachment, a finely warped sail, like that  of a wind-mill. But towards the root of the feather they suddenly  become weak, and confusedly flexible, and form the close down which  immediately protects the bird's body.    To show you the typical arrangement of these parts, I choose, as I have  said, the robin; because, both in his power of flying, and in his  color, he is a moderate and balanced bird;--not turned into nothing but  wings, like a swallow, or nothing but neck and tail, like a peacock.  And first for his flying power. There is one of the long feathers of  robin's wing, and here (Fig. 1) the analysis of its form.    31. First, in pure outline (A), seen from above, it is very nearly a  long oval, but with this peculiarity, that it has, as it were,  projecting shoulders at _a_ 1 and _a_ 2. I merely desire you to observe  this, in passing, because one usually thinks of the contour as sweeping  unbroken from the root to the point. I have not time to-day to enter on  any discussion of the reason for it, which will appear when we examine  the placing of the wing feathers for their stroke.    Now, I hope you are getting accustomed to the general method in which I  give you the analysis of all forms--leaf, or feather, or shell, or  limb. First, the plan; then the profile; then the cross-section.    I take next, the profile of my feather (B, Fig. 1), and find that it is  twisted as the sail of a windmill is, but more distinctly, so that you  can always see the upper surface of the feather at its root, and the  under at its end. Every primary wing-feather, in the fine flyers, is  thus twisted; and is best described as a sail striking with the power  of a cimeter, but with the flat instead of the edge.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.]    (Twice the size of reality.)    A    _a_ 1    _a_ 2    B]    32. Further, you remember that on the edges of the broad side of  feathers you find always a series of undulations, irregularly sequent,  and lapping over each other like waves on sand. You might at first  imagine that this appearance was owing to a slight ruffling or disorder  of the filaments; but it is entirely normal, and, I doubt not, so  constructed, in order to insure a redundance of material in the plume,  so that no accident or pressure from wind may leave a gap anywhere. How  this redundance is obtained you will see in a moment by bending any  feather the wrong way. Bend, for instance, this plume, B, Fig. 2, into  the reversed curve, A, Fig. 2; then all the filaments of the plume  become perfectly even, and there are no waves at the edge. But let the  plume return into its proper form, B, and the tissue being now  contracted into a smaller space, the edge waves are formed in it  instantly.    [Illustration: FIG. 2.    A    B]    Hitherto, I have been speaking only of the filaments arranged for the  strength and continuity of the energetic plume; they are entirely  different when they are set together for decoration instead of force.  After the feather of the robin's wing, let us examine one from his  breast.    33. I said, just now, he might be at once outshone by a brickbat.  Indeed, the day before yesterday, sleeping at Lichfield, and seeing,  the first thing when I woke in the morning, (for I never put down the  blinds of my bedroom windows,) the not uncommon sight in an English  country town of an entire house-front of very neat, and very flat, and  very red bricks, with very exactly squared square windows in it; and  not feeling myself in anywise gratified or improved by the spectacle, I  was thinking how in this, as in all other good, the too much destroyed  all. The breadth of a robin's breast in brick-red is delicious, but a  whole house-front of brick-red as vivid, is alarming. And yet one  cannot generalize even that trite moral with any safety--for infinite  breadth of green is delightful, however green; and of sea or sky,  however blue.    You must note, however, that the robin's charm is greatly helped by the  pretty space of gray plumage which separates the red from the brown  back, and sets it off to its best advantage. There is no great  brilliancy in it, even so relieved; only the finish of it is exquisite.    34. If you separate a single feather, you will find it more like a  transparent hollow shell than a feather (so delicately rounded the  surface of it),--gray at the root, where the down is,--tinged, and only  tinged, with red at the part that overlaps and is visible; so that,  when three or four more feathers have overlapped it again, all  together, with their joined red, are just enough to give the color  determined upon, each of them contributing a tinge. There are about  thirty of these glowing filaments on each side, (the whole being no  larger across than a well-grown currant,) and each of these is itself  another exquisite feather, with central quill and lateral webs, whose  filaments are not to be counted.    The extremity of these breast plumes parts slightly into two, as you  see in the peacock's, and many other such decorative ones. The  transition from the entirely leaf-like shape of the active plume, with  its oblique point, to the more or less symmetrical dualism of the  decorative plume, corresponds with the change from the pointed green  leaf to the dual, or heart-shaped, petal of many flowers. I shall  return to this part of our subject, having given you, I believe, enough  of detail for the present.    35. I have said nothing to-day of the mythology of the bird, though I  told you that would always be, for us, the most important part of its  natural history. But I am obliged, sometimes, to take what we  immediately want, rather than what, ultimately, we shall need chiefly.  In the second place, you probably, most of you, know more of the  mythology of the robin than I do, for the stories about it are all  northern, and I know scarcely any myths but the Italian and Greek. You  will find under the name \"Robin,\" in Miss Yonge's exhaustive and  admirable \"History of Christian Names,\" the various titles of honor and  endearment connected with him, and with the general idea of  redness,--from the bishop called \"Bright Red Fame,\" who founded the  first great Christian church on the Rhine, (I am afraid of your  thinking I mean a pun, in connection with robins, if I tell you the  locality of it,) down through the Hoods, and Roys, and Grays, to Robin  Goodfellow, and Spenser's \"Hobbinol,\" and our modern \"Hob,\"--joining on  to the \"goblin,\" which comes from the old Greek [Greek: Kobalos]. But I  cannot let you go without asking you to compare the English and French  feeling about small birds, in Chaucer's time, with our own on the same  subject. I say English and French, because the original French of the  Romance of the Rose shows more affection for birds than even Chaucer's  translation, passionate as he is, always, in love for any one of his  little winged brothers or sisters. Look, however, either in the French  or English at the description of the coming of the God of Love, leading  his carol-dance, in the garden of the Rose.    His dress is embroidered with figures of flowers and of beasts; but  about him fly the _living_ birds. The French is:        Il etoit tout convert d'oisiaulx      De rossignols et de papegaux      De calendre, et de mesangel.      Il semblait que ce fut une angle      Qui fuz tout droit venuz du ciel.    36. There are several points of philology in this transitional French,  and in Chaucer's translation, which it is well worth your patience to  observe. The monkish Latin \"angelus,\" you see, is passing through the  very unpoetical form \"angle,\" into \"ange;\" but, in order to get a rhyme  with it in that angular form, the French troubadour expands the bird's  name, \"mesange,\" quite arbitrarily, into \"mesangel.\" Then Chaucer,  not liking the \"mes\" at the beginning of the word, changes that  unscrupulously into \"arch;\" and gathers in, though too shortly, a  lovely bit from another place about the nightingales flying so close  round Love's head that they strike some of the leaves off his crown of  roses; so that the English runs thus:        But nightingales, a full great rout      That flien over his head about,      The leaves felden as they flien      And he was all with birds wrien,      With popinjay, with nightingale,      With chelaundre, and with wodewale,      With finch, with lark, and with archangel.      He seemed as he were an angell,      That down were comen from Heaven clear.    Now, when I first read this bit of Chaucer, without referring to the  original, I was greatly delighted to find that there was a bird in his  time called an archangel, and set to work, with brightly hopeful  industry, to find out what it was. I was a little discomfited by  finding that in old botany the word only meant \"dead-nettle,\" but was  still sanguine about my bird, till I found the French form descend, as  you have seen, into a mesangel, and finally into mesange, which is a  provincialism from [Greek: meion], and means, the smallest of  birds--or, specially here,--a titmouse. I have seldom had a less  expected or more ignominious fall from the clouds.    37. The other birds, named here and in the previous description of the  garden, are introduced, as far as I can judge, nearly at random, and  with no precision of imagination like that of Aristophanes; but with a  sweet childish delight in crowding as many birds as possible into the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21189"],[0,"Aesop, in Rhyme: Old Friends in a New Dress (#5)"],[1,"that by thee I stand,  Impatient of thy ruling hand;  How oft I've wish'd to break the lines  Thy wisdom for my lot assigns!  How oft indulged a vain desire  For something more or something higher!  And but for grace and love divine,  A fall thus dreadful had been mine.\"    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE RATS AND THE CHEESE.      If bees a government maintain,  Why may not rats of stronger brain  And greater power, as well bethought  By Machiavelian axioms taught?  And so they are, for thus of late  It happened in the rats' free state.  Their prince (his subjects more to please)  Had got a mighty Cheshire cheese,  In which his ministers of state  Might live in plenty and grow great.  A powerful party straight combined,  And their united forces join'd,  To bring their measures into play,  For none so loyal were as they;  And none such patriots, to support  As well the country as the court.  No sooner were those Dons admitted  But (all those wondrous virtues quitted)  They all the speediest means devise  To raise themselves and families.  Another party well observing  These pamper'd were, while they were starving,  Their ministry brought in disgrace,  Expelled them and supplied their place;  These on just principles were known  The true supporters of the throne,  And for the subjects liberty  They'd (marry would they) freely die;  But being well fix'd in their station,  Regardless of their prince and nation,  Just like the others, all their skill  Was how they might their paunches fill.  On this a rat, not quite so blind  In state intrigues as human kind,  But of more honor, thus replied:  \"Confound ye all on either side;  All your contentions are but these,  Whose arts shall best secure the cheese.\"    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    AURELIA AND THE SPIDER.      The muslin torn, from tears of grief  In vain Aurelia sought relief;  In sighs and plaints she pass'd the day;  The tatter'd frock neglected lay:  While busied at the weaving trade,  A spider heard the sighing maid  And kindly stopping in a trice,  Thus offer'd (gratis) her advice:  \"Turn, little girl! behold in me  A stimulus to industry  Compare your woes, my dear, with mine,  Then tell me who should most repine:  This morning, ere you left your room,  The chambermaid's remorseless broom  In one sad moment that destroy'd,  To build which thousands were employ'd!  The shock was great; but as my life  I saved in the relentless strife,  I knew lamenting was in vain,  So patient went to work again.  By constant work, a day or more,  My little mansion did restore:  And if each tear which you have shed  Had been a needle-full of thread,  If every sigh of sad despair  Had been a stitch of proper care,  Closed would have been the luckless rent,  Nor thus the day have been misspent.\"    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE REDBREAST AND THE  SPARROW.      Perch'd on a tree, hard by a rural cot,  A redbreast singing cheer'd the humble spot;  A sparrow on the thatch in critic spleen  Thus took occasion to reprove the strain:  \"Dost thou,\" cried he, \"thou dull dejected thing,  Presume to emulate the birds of spring?  Can thy weak warbling dare approach the thrush  Or blackbird's accents in the hawthorn bush?  Or with the lark dost thou poor mimic, vie,  Or nightingale's unequal'd melody?  These other birds possessing twice thy fire  Have been content in silence to admire.\"  \"With candor judge,\" the minstrel bird replied,  \"Nor deem my efforts arrogance or pride;  Think not ambition makes me act this part,  I only sing because I love the art:  I envy not, indeed, but much revere  Those birds whose fame the test of skill will bear;  I feel no hope arising to surpass,  Nor with their charming songs my own to class;  Far other aims incite my humble strain.  Then surely I your pardon may obtain,  While I attempt the rural vale to move  By imitating of the lays I love.\"          [Illustration]    THE POET AND THE COBWEBS.      A bard, whose pen had brought him more  Of fame than of the precious ore,  In Grub Street garret oft reposed  With eyes contemplative half-closed.  Cobwebs around in antique glory,  Chief of his household inventory,  Suggested to his roving brains  Amazing multitude of scenes.    \"This batch,\" said he, \"of murder-spinners  Who toil their brains out for their dinners,  Though base, too long unsung has lain  By kindred brethren of Duck Lane,  Unknowing that its little plan  Holds all the cyclopedia of man.    \"This one, whose radiant thread  Is every where from centre spread,  Like orbs in planetary skies,  Enclosed with rounds of various size,  This curious frame I aptly call  A cobweb mathematical.    \"In secret holes, that dirty line,  Where never sun presumes to shine,  With straws, and filth, and time beset,  Where all is fish that comes to net,  That musty film, the Muse supposes  Figures the web of Virtuosos.    \"You, where the gaudy insect sings,  Are cobwebs of the court of kings,  Where gilded threads conceal the gin.  And broider'd knaves are caught therein.    \"That holly, fix'd 'mid mildew'd panes,  Of cheerless Christmas the remains  (I only dream and sing its cheer,  My Muse keeps Lent throughout the year)  That holly, labor'd o'er and o'er,  Is cobwebs of the lawyer's lore,  Where frisky flies, on gambols borne,  Find out the snare, when lost, undone.    \"These dangling webs, with dirt and age,  Display their tatter'd equipage,  So like the antiquarian crew,  That those in every thread I view.    \"Here death disseminated lies,  In shrunk anatomies of flies;  And amputated limbs declare  What vermin lie in ambush there:  A baited lure with drugg'd perdition,  A cobweb, not misnamed physician.    \"Those plaited webs, long pendent there,  Of sable bards a subtle snare,  Of all-collective disposition,  Which holds like gout of inquisition,  May well denominated be,  The trap-webs of divinity.\"    But whilst our bard described the scene,  A bee stole through a broken pane;  Fraught with the sweets of every flower,  In taking his adventurous tour,  Is there entrapp'd. Exert thy sting,  Bold bee, and liberate thy wing!  The poet kindly dropp'd his pen,  And freed the captive from its den;  Then musing o'er his empty table,  Forgot the moral of his fable.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE EPICURE AND THE PHYSICIAN.      Two hundred years ago, or more,  An heir possess'd a miser's store;  Rejoiced to find his father dead,  Till then on thrifty viands fed;  Unnumber'd dishes crown'd his board,  With each unwholesome trifle stored.  He ate--and long'd to eat again,  But sigh'd for appetite in vain:  His food, though dress'd a thousand ways,  Had lost its late accustom'd praise;  He relish'd nothing--sickly grew--  Yet long'd to taste of something new.  It chanced in this disastrous case,  One morn betimes he join'd the chase:  Swift o'er the plain the hunters fly,  Each echoing out a joyous cry;  A forest next before them lay;  He, left behind, mistook his way,  And long alone bewildered rode,  He found a peasant's poor abode;  But fasting kept, from six to four,  Felt hunger, long unfelt before;  The friendly swain this want supplied,  And Joan some eggs and bacon fried.  Not dainty now, the squire in haste  Fell to, and praised their savory taste;  Nay, said his meal had such a _gout_  He ne'er in tarts and olios knew.  Rejoiced to think he'd found a dish,  That crown'd his long unanswer'd wish,  With gold his thankful host he paid,  Who guides him back from whence he stray'd;  But ere they part, so well he dined,  His rustic host the squire enjoin'd  To send him home next day a stock  Of those same eggs and charming hock.  He hoped this dish of savory meat  Would prove that still 'twas bliss to eat;  But, ah! he found, like all the rest,  These eggs were tasteless things at best;  The bacon not a dog would touch,  So rank--he never tasted such!  He sent express to fetch the clown,  And thus address'd him with a frown:  \"These eggs, this bacon, that you sent,  For Christian food were never meant;  As soon I'll think the moon's a cheese,  As those you dress'd the same with these.  Little I thought\"--\"Sir,\" says the peasant,  \"I'm glad your worship is so pleasant:  You joke, I'm sure: for I can swear,  The same the fowls that laid them are!  And know as well that all the bacon  From one the self-same flitch was taken:  The air, indeed, about our green  Is known to make the stomach keen.\"  \"Is that the case?\" the squire replied;  \"That air shall be directly tried.\"  He gave command--a house he hired,  And down he goes with hope inspired,  And takes his cooks--a favorite train;  But still they ply their art in vain.  Perhaps 'twas riding did the feat:  He rides,--but still he cannot eat.  At last a friend, to physic bred,  Perceived his case, and thus he said:  \"Be ruled by me, you soon shall eat,  With hearty gust, the plainest meat;  A pint of milk each rising morn,  Procure from cow of sable horn;  Shake in three drops of morning dew  From twig of ever-verdant yew;  It must by your own hand be done,  Your face turn'd westward from the sun.  With this, ere half an hour is past,  Well crumb'd with biscuit, break your fast;  Which done, from food (or all is vain)  For twice three hours and one abstain--  Then dine on one substantial dish,  If plainly dress'd, of flesh or fish.\"  Grave look'd the doctor as he spake--  The squire concludes th' advice to take,  And, cheated into temperance, found  The bliss his former luxury drown'd.
