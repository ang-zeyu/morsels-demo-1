Altogether there are some 500 or more in Cairo, as well as a great  number of lesser shrines where the people worship. I will tell you how  this comes about. We have often read in the \"Arabian Nights\" in what a  high-handed and frequently unjust manner the property of some poor  unfortunate would be seized and given to another. This was very much  the case in Cairo in the olden days, and khalifs and cadis, muftis and  pashas, were not very scrupulous about whose money or possessions they  administered, and even to-day in some Mohammedan countries it is not  always wise for a man to grow rich.    [Illustration: A MOSQUE INTERIOR.]    And so it was that in order to escape robbery in the name of law many  wealthy merchants preferred to build during their lifetime a mosque or  other public building, while money left for this purpose was regarded  as sacred, and so the many beautiful sebils and mosques of Cairo  came into existence.    Egypt is so old that even the Roman times appear new, and one is  tempted to regard these glorious buildings of the Mohammedan era as  only of yesterday. Yet many of the mosques which people visit and  admire are older than any church or cathedral in England. We all think  of Lincoln Cathedral or Westminster Abbey as being very venerable  buildings, and so they are; but long before they were built the  architecture of the Mohammedans in Egypt had developed into a perfect  style, and produced many of the beautiful mosques in which the Cairene  prays to-day.    As a rule the mosque was also the tomb of its founder, and the dome  was designed as a canopy over his burial-place, so that when a mosque  is _domed_ we know it to be the mausoleum of some great man, while the  beautiful minaret or tower is common to all mosques, whether  tomb-mosque or not.    One of the most striking features of a mosque is the doorway, which is  placed in a deep arched recess, very lofty and highly ornamented. A  flight of stone steps lead from the street to the door, which is often  of hammered bronze and green with age, and from a beam which spans the  recess hang curious little lamps, which are lit on fete days.    At the top of the steps is a low railing or barrier which no one may  cross _shod_, for beyond this is holy ground, where, as in the old  days of Scripture, every one must \"put off his shoes from off his  feet.\"    The interior of the mosque is often very rich and solemn. It is  usually built in the form of a square courtyard, open to the sky, in  which is the \"hanafieh,\" or tank, where \"the faithful\" wash before  prayers. The court is surrounded by cloisters supported by innumerable  pillars, or else lofty horseshoe arches lead into deep bays or  recesses, the eastern one of which, called the \"kibleh,\" is the  holiest, and corresponds to our chancel, and in the centre of the wall  is the \"mirhab,\" or niche, which is in the direction of Mecca, and the  point towards which the Moslem prays.    Marble pavements, beautiful inlay of ivory and wood, stained-glass  windows, and elaborately decorated ceilings and domes, beautify the  interior, and go to form a rich but subdued coloured scheme, solemn  and restful, and of which perhaps my picture will give you some idea.    Attached to most mosques is a sebil, also beautiful in design. The  lower story has a fountain for the use of wayfarers; above, in a  bright room open to the air, is a little school, where the boys and  girls of the quarter learn to recite sundry passages from the Koran,  and which until recently was practically all the education they  received.    And now I must tell you something about the bazaars, which, after the  mosques, are the most interesting relics in Cairo, and in many cases  quite as old. First, I may say that the word \"bazaar\" means \"bargain,\"  and as in the East a fixed price is unusual, and anything is worth  just what can be got for it, making a purchase is generally a matter  of patience, and one may often spend days in acquiring some simple  article of no particular value. An exception is the trade in copper  ware, which is sold by weight, and it is a common practice among the  poorer classes to invest their small savings in copper vessels of  which they have the benefit, and which can readily be sold again  should money be wanted. This trade is carried on in a very picturesque  street, called the \"Suk-en-Nahassin,\" or street of the coppersmiths,  where in tiny little shops 4 or 5 feet square, most of the copper and  brass industry of Cairo is carried on. Opening out of this street are  other bazaars, many very ancient, and each built for some special  trade. So we have the shoemaker's bazaar, the oil, spice, Persian and  goldsmith's bazaars, and many others, each different in character, and  generally interesting as architecture. The Persian bazaar is now  nearly demolished, and the \"Khan Khalili,\" once the centre of the  carpet trade, and the most beautiful of all, is now split up into a  number of small curio shops, for the people are becoming Europeanized,  and the Government, alas! appear to have no interest in the  preservation of buildings of great historic interest and beauty.    One other feature of old Cairo I must notice before leaving the  subject. In the old days of long caravan journeys, when merchants from  Persia, India, and China brought their wares to Cairo overland, it was  their custom to travel in strong companies capable of resisting  possible attacks by the wild desert tribes, and in Cairo special  \"khans,\" or inns, were built to accommodate the different  nationalities or trades. In the central court the horses and camels of  the different caravans were tethered; surrounding it, and raised  several feet above the ground, were numerous bays in which the goods  were exposed for sale. Above, several storeys provided sleeping  accommodation for the travellers. Like the bazaars, many of these  khans are very ancient, and are most interesting architecturally as  well as being fast disappearing relics of days which, until the  introduction of railways and steamers, perpetuated in our own time  conditions of life and trade which had continued uninterruptedly since  that time so long ago when Joseph first built his store cities and  granaries in Egypt.    It is impossible in a few pages to convey any real impression of  Cairo, and I have only attempted to describe a few of its most  characteristic features. There is, however, a great deal more to  see--the citadel, built by that same Saladin against whom our  crusaders fought in Palestine, and which contains many ancient mosques  and other buildings of historic interest, and the curious well called  Joseph's Well, where, by means of many hundreds of stone steps, the  visitor descends into the heart of the rock upon which the citadel is  built, and which until recently supplied it with water. Close by is  the parapet from which the last of the Memluks made his desperate  leap for freedom, and became sole survivor of his class so  treacherously murdered by Mohammed Ali; behind, crowning the Mokhattam  Hills, is the little fort built by Napoleon the Great to command the  city, while in every direction are views almost impossible of  description. To the east is that glorious cemetery known as the \"tombs  of the khalifs,\" which contains many of the finest architectural gems  of mediaeval Egypt; to the west is Fostat, the original \"city of the  tent,\" from which Cairo sprang, while over the rubbish heaps of old  Babylon, the Roman aqueduct stretches towards Rhoda, that beautiful  garden island on whose banks tradition has it that the infant Moses  was found, while still further across the river, sail-dotted and  gleaming in the sun, the great Pyramids mark the limit of the Nile  Valley and the commencement of that enormous desert which stretches to  the Atlantic Ocean. Looking south, past Memphis and the Pyramids of  Sakkara and Darshur, the Nile loses itself in the distant heat  haze, while to the north is stretched before us the fertile plains of  the Delta.    [Illustration: A STREET IN CAIRO.]    At our feet lies the wonderful Arab town, whose domes and minarets  rise high above the dwellings which screen the streets from view, but  whose seething life is evidenced by the dull roar which reaches you  even at this distance. It is a city of sunlight, rich in buildings of  absorbing interest and ablaze with colour. As for the people, ignorant  and noisy though they are, they have much good-humour and simple  kindness in their natures, and it is worth notice that a stranger may  walk about in safety in the most squalid quarters of the city, and of  what European capital could this be said?          CHAPTER V    THE NILE--I      I have already told you how the land of Egypt was first formed by the  river which is still its source of life; but before saying anything  about the many monuments on its banks or the floating life it carries,  I want you to look at the map with me for a moment, and see what we  can learn of the character of the river itself.    The Nile is one of the world's _great_ rivers, and is about 3,400  miles long. As you will see, it has its source in the overflow from  Lake Victoria Nyanza, when it flows in a generally northern direction  for many hundreds of miles, receiving several tributaries, such as the  River Sobat and the Bahr-el-Ghazal, whose waters, combining with the  Bahr-el-Abiad, or White Nile, as it is called, maintain the steady  constant flow of the river.    Eventually it is joined by the Bahr-el-Azrak, or Blue Nile, which  rises among the mountains of Abyssinia and enters the White Nile at  Khartum.    During a great part of the year this branch is dry, but filled by the  melting snow and torrential rains of early spring, the Blue Nile  becomes a surging torrent, and pours its muddy water, laden with  alluvial soil and forest debris, into the main river, causing it to  rise far"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18674"],[0,"A Chinese Wonder Book (#5)"],[1,"baser elements had again refused to blend into a united whole.    With a bitter cry which touched the hearts of all those present, the  unhappy Kwan-yu fell upon the floor. This time he did not bow before his  master, for at the sight of the miserable conglomeration of useless  metals his courage failed him, and he fainted. When at last he came to,  the first sight that met his eyes was the scowling face of Yung-lo. Then  he heard, as in a dream, the stern voice of the Son of Heaven:    \"Unhappy Kwan-yu, can it be that you, upon whom I have ever heaped my  favours, have twice betrayed the trust? The first time, I was sorry  for you and willing to forget, but now that sorrow has turned into  anger--yea, the anger of heaven itself is upon you. Now, I bid you mark  well my words. A third chance you shall have to cast the bell, but if on  that third attempt you fail--then by order of the Vermilion Pencil both  you and Ming-lin, who recommended you, shall pay the penalty.\"    For a long time after the Emperor had departed, Kwan-yu lay on the floor  surrounded by his attendants, but chief of all those who tried to  restore him was his faithful daughter. For a whole week he wavered  between life and death, and then at last there came a turn in his  favour. Once more he regained his health, once more he began his  preparations.    Yet all the time he was about his work his heart was heavy, for he felt  that he would soon journey into the dark forest, the region of the great  yellow spring, the place from which no pilgrim ever returns. Ko-ai, too,  felt more than ever that her father was in the presence of a great  danger.    \"Surely,\" she said one day to her mother, \"a raven must have flown over  his head. He is like the proverb of the blind man on the blind horse  coming at midnight to a deep ditch. Oh, how can he cross over?\"    Willingly would this dutiful daughter have done anything to save her  loved one. Night and day she racked her brains for some plan, but all to  no avail.    On the day before the third casting, as Ko-ai was sitting in front of  her brass mirror braiding her long black hair, suddenly a little bird  flew in at the window and perched upon her head. Immediately the  startled maiden seemed to hear a voice as if some good fairy were  whispering in her ear:    \"Do not hesitate. You must go and consult the famous juggler who even  now is visiting the city. Sell your jade-stones and other jewels, for  this man of wisdom will not listen unless his attention is attracted  by huge sums of money.\"    The feathered messenger flew out of her room, but Ko-ai had heard enough  to make her happy. She despatched a trusted servant to sell her jade and  her jewels, charging him on no account to tell her mother. Then, with a  great sum of money in her possession she sought out the magician who was  said to be wiser than the sages in knowledge of life and death.    \"Tell me,\" she implored, as the greybeard summoned her to his presence,  \"tell me how I can save my father, for the Emperor has ordered his death  if he fails a third time in the casting of the bell.\"    The astrologer, after plying her with questions, put on his  tortoise-shell glasses and searched long in his book of knowledge. He  also examined closely the signs of the heavens, consulting the mystic  tables over and over again. Finally, he turned toward Ko-ai, who all the  time had been awaiting his answer with impatience.    \"Nothing could be plainer than the reason of your father's failure, for  when a man seeks to do the impossible, he can expect Fate to give him no  other answer. Gold cannot unite with silver, nor brass with iron, unless  the blood of a maiden is mingled with the molten metals, but the girl  who gives up her life to bring about the fusion must be pure and good.\"    With a sigh of despair Ko-ai heard the astrologer's answer. She loved  the world and all its beauties; she loved her birds, her companions, her  father; she had expected to marry soon, and then there would have been  children to love and cherish. But now all these dreams of happiness must  be forgotten. There was no other maiden to give up her life for Kwan-yu.  She, Ko-ai, loved her father and must make the sacrifice for his sake.    And so the day arrived for the third trial, and a third time Yung-lo  took his place in Kwan-yu's factory, surrounded by his courtiers. There  was a look of stern expectancy on his face. Twice he had excused his  underling for failure. Now there could be no thought of mercy. If the  bell did not come from its cast perfect in tone and fair to look upon,  Kwan-yu must be punished with the severest punishment that could be  meted out to man--even death itself. That was why there was a look of  stern expectancy on Yung-lo's face, for he really loved Kwan-yu and did  not wish to send him to his death.    As for Kwan-yu himself, he had long ago given up all thought of success,  for nothing had happened since his second failure to make him any surer  this time of success. He had settled up his business affairs, arranging  for a goodly sum to go to his beloved daughter; he had bought the coffin  in which his own body would be laid away and had stored it in one of the  principal rooms of his dwelling; he had even engaged the priests and  musicians who should chant his funeral dirge, and, last but not least,  he had arranged with the man who would have charge of chopping off his  head, that one fold of skin should be left uncut, as this would bring  him better luck on his entry into the spiritual world than if the head  were severed entirely from the body.    And so we may say that Kwan-yu was prepared to die. In fact, on the  night before the final casting he had a dream in which he saw himself  kneeling before the headsman and cautioning him not to forget the  binding agreement the latter had entered into.    Of all those present in the great foundry, perhaps the devoted Ko-ai was  the least excited. Unnoticed, she had slipped along the wall from the  spot where she had been standing with her mother and had planted herself  directly opposite the huge tank in which the molten, seething liquid  bubbled, awaiting the signal when it should be set free. Ko-ai gazed at  the Emperor, watching intently for the well-known signal. When at last  she saw his head move forward she sprang with a wild leap into the  boiling liquid, at the same time crying in her clear, sweet voice:    \"For thee, dear father! It is the only way!\"    The molten white metal received the lovely girl into its ardent embrace,  received her, and swallowed her up completely, as in a tomb of liquid  fire.    And Kwan-yu--what of Kwan-yu, the frantic father? Mad with grief at the  sight of his loved one giving up her life, a sacrifice to save him, he  had sprung forward to hold her back from her terrible death, but had  succeeded only in catching one of her tiny jewelled slippers as she sank  out of sight for ever--a dainty, silken slipper, to remind him always of  her wonderful sacrifice. In his wild grief as he clasped this pitiful  little memento to his heart he would himself have leaped in and followed  her to her death, if his servants had not restrained him until the  Emperor had repeated his signal and the liquid had been poured into the  cast. As the sad eyes of all those present peered into the molten river  of metals rushing to its earthen bed, they saw not a single sign  remaining of the departed Ko-ai.    This, then, my children, is the time-worn legend of the great bell  of Peking, a tale that has been repeated a million times by poets,  story-tellers and devoted mothers, for you must know that on this third  casting, when the earthen mould was removed, there stood revealed the  most beautiful bell that eye had ever looked upon, and when it was swung  up into the bell-tower there was immense rejoicing among the people. The  silver and the gold and the iron and the brass, held together by the  blood of the virgin, had blended perfectly, and the clear voice of the  monster bell rang out over the great city, sounding a deeper, richer  melody than that of any other bell within the limits of the Middle  Kingdom, or, for that matter, of all the world. And, strange to say,  even yet the deep-voiced colossus seems to cry out the name of the  maiden who gave herself a living sacrifice, \"Ko-ai! Ko-ai! Ko-ai!\" so  that all the people may remember her deed of virtue ten thousand years  ago. And between the mellow peals of music there often seems to come a  plaintive whisper that may be heard only by those standing near, \"Hsieh!  hsieh\"--the Chinese word for slipper. \"Alas!\" say all who hear it,  \"Ko-ai is crying for her slipper. Poor little Ko-ai!\"    And now, my dear children, this tale is almost finished, but there is  still one thing you must by no means fail to remember. By order of the  Emperor, the face of the great bell was graven with precious sayings  from the classics, that even in its moments of silence the bell might  teach lessons of virtue to the people.    \"Behold,\" said Yung-lo, as he stood beside the grief-stricken father,  \"amongst all yonder texts of wisdom, the priceless sayings of our  honoured sages, there is none that can teach to my children so sweet a  lesson of filial love and devotion as that one last act of your devoted  daughter. For though she died to save you, her deed will still be sung  and extolled by my people when you are passed away, yea, even when the  bell itself has crumbled into ruins.\"          THE STRANGE TALE OF DOCTOR DOG    [Illustration]      Far up in the mountains of the Province of Hunan in the central part of  China, there once lived in a small village a rich gentleman who had only  one child.
