She was very slight of body, with an ill-developed  chest, and, from her appearance, could not have enjoyed robust health.  It was at once evident that this was an admirable case by which to  test the views advocated. Accordingly, the author addressed the young  lady as follows:    \"Your voice is beautiful in quality, and carries well; you observe the  registers properly; but your vocalization is feeble, and your singing  is ineffective. This is due largely to the lack of robustness in your  voice, but not wholly. You do not tell your story in song so that the  listener may know what you have to say to him. The imperfections in  your method of speaking, so common in America--an imperfect  articulation and a limp texture of voice--are evident in your singing;  you do not phrase well, and you paint all in one color. This is due  chiefly to your breathing and your attacks. One may observe that at no  time do you fill your chest completely. You use the lower chest and  the diaphragm correctly, but you rob yourself of one half of your  breathing power, and your chest is not at all well developed. You do  not use the parts above your voice-box with vigor and efficiency, and  you direct so much attention to the quality of the tone that you  neglect its quantity and the ideas to be expressed. You have been  correctly but inadequately instructed. Your teachers have evidently  understood registers practically, as few do, but they have only half  taught you breathing and attack. Their fidelity to that high ideal of  quality of tone as the final consideration wins my respect.\"    The writer thought, but did not say, that they must have understood  little of vocal physiology, or they would not have left this young  lady so ill-developed physically, at least so far as the chest is  concerned.    I then asked this earnest and intelligent student, as she proved to  be, to take a full breath. She did not understand this, and was  absolutely incapable of doing it. She had been taught to begin  breathing below, to expand from the lower chest upward, and, as a  natural result, she never filled the upper chest. She was at once  shown how it was done, when she seemed greatly surprised, and said: \"I  never have done that in my whole life.\" \"Did you not run and shout as  a child?\" \"No, I never did run enough or shout enough to fill up my  chest.\" The latter was small, and flat.    The method of attack was next explained and illustrated, first without  reference to words, and then to show its importance in conveying  ideas, and the causes of the defects in speaking were indicated, and  the corrections named and illustrated. The lady was then asked to sing  again, making the improvements suggested, with the result that it was  clear that every principle set forth had been clearly apprehended,  though of course as yet only imperfectly carried out. The student was  recommended to take walking exercise, and to practice filling the  chest in the manner to be explained later.    After six weeks she again asked to be heard. The change effected was  wonderful; she was another type of vocalist now. Without any loss in  quality her voice had a volume and intensity that made it adequate for  singing in at least a small hall; her attacks were good, though not  perfect; and at the end of a very large room it could easily be seen  that her chest was, when necessary, filled full, so that she was able  to produce a large and prolonged tone. But, best of all, her health  had greatly improved, and she had gained in size and weight.    It is but fair to point out that, in the present case, the student was  an unusually intelligent and thoughtful person. Had it been otherwise,  more consultations would have been necessary, with probably many  detailed instructions and much practice before the teacher. But the  case sufficed to convince me afresh that only physiological teaching  meets the needs of pupil and teacher. I do not claim, of course, that  it is a panacea. It will not supply the lack of a musical ear or an  artistic temperament. Vocalization does not make an artist, but there  can be no artist without sound vocalization.    All the author's experience as a laryngologist tended to convince him  that most of those evils from which speakers and singers suffer,  whatever the part of the vocal mechanism affected, arise from faulty  methods of voice-production, or excess in the use of methods in  themselves correct. A showman may have a correct method of  voice-production--indeed, the writer has often studied the showman  with admiration--but if he speak for hours in the open air in all  sorts of weather, a disordered throat is but the natural consequence;  and the Wagnerian singer who will shout instead of sing must not  expect to retain a voice of musical quality, if, indeed, he retain one  at all.    Throughout this work it will be assumed that the speaker and the  singer should employ essentially the same vocal methods. The singer  should be a good speaker, even a good elocutionist, and the speaker  should be able to produce tones equal in beauty, power, and  expressiveness to those of the singer, but, of course, within a more  limited range, and less prolonged, as a rule. To each alike is  voice-training essential, if artistic results are to follow; neither  rhetorical training on the one hand nor musical training on the other  will alone suffice.    So that it may be clear that the same physiological principles apply  to the vocal mechanism as to all others in the body, a short chapter  dealing with this subject is introduced, before taking up the  structure and functions of any part of that apparatus by which the  speaker or singer produces his results as a specialist.    The laws of health known as hygiene follow so naturally on those of  physiology that brief references to this subject, from time to time,  with a chapter at the end of the work bearing specially on the life of  the voice-user, will probably suffice.          CHAPTER II.    GENERAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS.      The principle that knowledge consists in a perception of relations  will now be applied to the structure and functions or uses of the  different parts of the body.    The demonstration that all animals, even all living things, have  certain properties or functions in common is one of the great results  of modern science. Man no longer can be rightly viewed apart from  other animals. In many respects he is in no wise superior to them. The  most desirable course to pursue is to learn wherein animals resemble  and wherein they differ, without dwelling at great length on the  question of relative superiority or inferiority. It may be  unhesitatingly asserted that all animals live, move, and have their  being, in every essential respect, in the same way. Whether one  considers those creatures of microscopic size living in stagnant  ponds, or man himself, it is found that certain qualities characterize  them all. That minute mass of jelly-like substance known as  protoplasm, constituting the one-celled animal amoeba, may be  described as _ingestive_, _digestive_, _secretory_, _excretory_,  _assimilative_, _respiratory_, _irritable_, _contractile_, and  _reproductive_: that is to say, the amoeba must take in food;  must digest it, or change its form; must produce some fluid within  itself which acts on food; must cast out from itself what is no longer  of any use; must convert the digested material into its own  substance--perhaps the most wonderful property of living things; must  take up into its own substance oxygen, and expel carbonic acid gas  (carbon dioxide); and possess the power to respond to a stimulus, or  cause of change, the property of changing form, and, finally, the  ability to bring into being others like itself.

Muscle-fibres from the heart, much magnified,  showing cross-stripings, nuclei, or the darkly stained central bodies  very important to the life of the cell, also the divisions and points  of union.

Between the muscle-cells proper a form of  binding tissue may be seen.]    [Illustration: FIG. 3. Muscle-cells isolated from the muscular coats  of the intestine. Similar cells are found in some part of most of the  internal organs, including the bronchial tubes. These cells are less  ready in responding to a stimulus, contract more slowly, and tend to  remain longer contracted when they pass into this condition than  striped muscle cells. (Schaefer.)]    Before justifying these statements in detail it will be desirable to  say something of the anatomy or structure of a mammal, and we may  select man himself, though it is to be remembered that one might apply  exactly the same treatment to a dog, pig, mouse, or any other member  of this group of animals. The amoeba and creatures like it live  immersed in water; man, at the bottom of an ocean of air. Both move in  their own medium, the amoeba creeping with extreme slowness, man  moving with a speed incalculably greater. In each case the movements  are determined by some cause from without which is termed by  physiologists a _stimulus_. The slightest movement of the thin  cover-glass placed over the drop of water in which an amoeba is  immersed, on a microscopic slide, suffices to act as a stimulus, and  serves much the same purpose as an electric shock to the muscles of a  man. In man an elaborate apparatus exists for the process known as  respiration, but in this and in all other cases the mechanism is  composed of what is known technically as _cells_, the latter being the  units of structure, the individual bricks of the building, so to  speak; and just as any edifice is made up of individual pieces some of  which differ from one another while others do not to any"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19881"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Carlisle (#5)"],[1,"from the  arch opposite. Just beneath this window a doorway (now blocked up)  formerly led from the cloisters into the nave.    Up to the year 1870 the nave was used as a parish church. The cathedral  from its beginning as the priory church, in accordance with a very  common practice of the Augustinian body, contained two churches  belonging to two separate bodies quite independent of each other.    The choir and transepts formed the priory church, in the possession of  the prior and canons until the dissolution of the monastery, when it  passed to the dean and chapter. The nave formed the parish church of St.  Mary, and belonged to the parishioners. After the civil wars it was cut  off from the transepts by a stone wall, and furnished with galleries and  a pulpit. A new church to accommodate the parishioners having been built  in the abbey grounds in 1870, all these additions were removed, and the  nave was restored to the cathedral, adding greatly to the general  effect. An interesting event in the history of the parish church was the  marriage of Sir Walter Scott to Miss Carpenter on the 24th December  1797.    He had made the acquaintance of Miss Carpenter at Gilsland in July while  touring in the Lake district. She had \"a form that was fashioned as  light as a fay's, a complexion of the clearest and lightest olive; eyes  large, deep-set, and dazzling, of the finest Italian brown; and a  profusion of silken tresses black as the raven's wing.\" Scott was  strongly attracted to her, and within six months she became his wife.    A tombstone under the west window shows the matrix of what was once a  magnificent brass.    The #Font#, standing on a fine marble flooring close to the west window,  has bronze figures of St. John Baptist, the Virgin and Child, and St.  Philip. It was designed by Sir A. Blomfield, and presented by Archdeacon  Prescott 1891.    [Illustration: LONGITUDINAL SECTION, NORTH.]    The #Organ.#--The former organ built by Avery, London, has been given  to Hexham Abbey Church. The present one extends from one side of the  eastern tower arch to the other. It was built by Willis (1856), and the  diaper work was executed by Hardman. About the year 1877 it was enlarged  at a cost of nearly L 1000.    #North Transept.#--The transept is very lofty and very dark. It is about  22 feet wide, and its length from north to south is nearly 114 feet.    Standing near the entrance to the north choir aisle, looking southwards  and across the nave, a capital general view of the remains of the Norman  portion of the cathedral can be obtained.    This end of the transept was rebuilt after the fire of 1292. Having been  greatly injured by another fire that broke out about a hundred years  later, Bishop Strickland rebuilt it (1400-19.) During the restoration of  the cathedral it was once again rebuilt.    On the west side is a Norman arch, the entrance to the north aisle of  the nave. The sinking of the tower piers has partly crushed it out of  shape. The portion of an arch visible above, acts as a buttress to the  tower arches. To the right is a late thirteenth-century window filled  with glass in memory of the Rev. Walter Fletcher, Chancellor of Carlisle  (died 1846). This window exhibits plate tracery--tracery cut, as it  were, out of a flat plate of stone, without mouldings, not built up in  sections. It is the transitional link between the lancet and tracery  systems.    The doorway in the corner communicates with the transept roof.    The north window is very large, and is filled with stained glass in  memory of five children of A.C. Tait, Dean of Carlisle, afterwards  Archbishop of Canterbury. They all died of scarlet fever in the short  space of five weeks, 6th March to 9th April 1858.    This end of the transept was till quite recently railed off, and used as  the consistory court of the Chancellor of Carlisle.    Originally the transept had a chapel on the eastern side opening with a  single arch, similar to St. Catherine's Chapel in the south transept.    The opening to the north choir aisle is Decorated in style; above this  is a portion of an arch for buttressing the tower-arches.    [Illustration: VIEW ACROSS THE TRANSEPTS IN 1840. From Billings.]    To the right is the blocked-up entrance of the old Norman choir aisle,  an exact counterpart of the present south choir aisle entrance.    The roof is now an open timber one of the original pitch.    Near the north-east pier of the tower is a well, completely covered  over. This, it is said, was done by a former dean, on the supposition  that the well, or the water, in some occult fashion, affected the music  in the cathedral.    The #Tower# was rebuilt by Bishop Strickland (1400-19), who used the  Norman piers, and placed upon them other columns of about the same  length. The Early Norman piers have square-fluted capitals and are a  little higher than the arches of the nave. The added columns have  capitals carved with birds and foliage, and are carried up to the arches  of the tower. This rebuilding was rendered necessary by the shifting of  its foundations. The piers sank nearly one foot, and the arches near  them have been to some extent distorted. Springs of water are said to  run across the transept from north to south, and this may explain the  sinking, which probably happened before the erection of the present  choir.    Clustered columns uphold the transept arches, but the western and  eastern arches are supported on each side by a single column terminating  in a bracket at about the level of the base of the triforium. This was  arranged so as to increase the width of the passage between the piers  from the choir to the nave.    The decoration of the eastern arch capitals consists of the badges of  the Percy family--the crescent and fetterlock. Hotspur was Governor of  the town and Warden of the Marches under Henry IV., and it is probable  that he aided in the work of the bishop. The western arch capitals have,  as decoration, the rose and escallop shell alternately--badges of the  Dacres and Nevilles, who also may have been benefactors to the  cathedral.    Across the north transept from the upper capitals is a depressed arch of  stone with Perpendicular tracery.    #South Transept.#--With the exception of the wall itself, the south arm  of the transept is modern. The ancient wall, eight feet thick, is quite  suitable for a fortress. A richly-decorated modern doorway has been  made, and above it is a window by Powell, representing the \"Days of  Creation.\"    [Illustration: PART OF SOUTH TRANSEPT AND ST. CATHERINE'S CHAPEL. From  Billings.]    The west wall is out of the perpendicular through the shifting of the  tower piers, and the Norman arch, opening to the south aisle of the nave  has also been distorted. To the left is a round-headed window, filled  with glass in memory of the Rev. W. Vansittart, canon and prebendary of  Carlisle 1824.    The triforium has a plain rounded opening.    The clerestory is very much like that of the nave, but is not so regular  in construction, the architecture being merely massive and destitute of  ornament, except in the case of the capitals, which are very sparingly  decorated.    On the east side of the transept, the second arch from the doorway, is  the entrance to the south choir aisle. It is Norman, ornamented with a  simply executed but very pleasing zigzag: the capitals of the piers are  cushioned. On the whole, it is much the same as the arch immediately  opposite, opening on the south aisle of the nave.    All this side of the transept, with the exception of the small doorway  (which was built a few years later), dates from about 1101.    #St Catharine's Chapel.#--Between the choir aisle entrance and the  modern doorway is another Norman arch, which is the entrance to St.  Catherine's Chapel--a chantry of Early Decorated style erected on the  walls of a former Norman building.    Jefferson says: \"In most large churches, altars, distinct from that in  the chancel, were founded by wealthy and influential individuals, at  which masses might be sung for the repose of the dead; the portion thus  set apart, which was generally the east end of one of the aisles, was  then denominated a chantry: in it the tomb of the founder was generally  placed, and it was separated from the rest of the church by a screen. In  the fourteenth century this custom greatly increased, and small  additional side aisles and transepts were often annexed to churches and  called mortuary chapels; these were used indeed as chantries, but they  were more independent in their constitution, and in general more ample  in their endowments. The dissolution of all these foundations followed  soon after that of the monasteries.    \"In the year 1422 Bishop Whelpdale at his death left the sum of L 200,  for the purpose of founding and endowing a chantry for the performance  of religious offices for the souls of Sir Thomas Skelton, knight, and  Mr. John Glaston, two gentlemen with whom he had been on terms of  intimate friendship, and who were buried in the cathedral. Nicholson  thinks it probable this was the chantry of St. Roch; its revenues were  valued at L 2, 14s. per annum.    [Illustration: ONE BAY OF THE NAVE.]    \"There was another chantry dedicated to St. Cross; but the period at  which, and the person by whom it was founded are not known. It was  granted by Edward VI. 'with all messuages, lands, tenements, profits,  and hereditaments belonging thereto,' valued at L 3, 19s. per annum, to  Henry Tanner and Thomas Bucher.    \"The chapel of St. Catherine in the Cathedral of Carlisle was founded  at an early period by John de Capella, a wealthy citizen, and endowed by  him with certain rents, lands, and burgage houses. In the year 1366 a  portion of its revenues being fraudulently detained, Bishop Appleby  commanded the chaplains of St. Mary's and St. Cuthbert's to give public  notice that the offenders were required to make"]]]
