It's just gettin' 'old of the right little  woman, and 'aving a nice little 'ome of your own to go back to at  night.\"    \"Mac,\" said Billie admiringly, \"you talk like a Tin Pan Alley song  hit, except that you've left out the scent of honeysuckle and Old  Mister Moon climbing up over the trees. Well, you're quite right.  I'm all for the simple and domestic myself. If I could find the  right man, and he didn't see me coming and duck, I'd become one of  the Mendelssohn's March Daughters right away. Are you going,  George? There's a rehearsal at two-thirty for cuts.\"    \"I want to get the evening papers and send off a cable or two. See  you later.\"    \"We shall meet at Philippi.\"    Mac eyed George's retreating back till he had turned the corner.    \"A nice pleasant gentleman, Mr. Bevan,\" he said. \"Too bad 'e's got  the pip the way 'e 'as, just after 'avin' a big success like this  'ere. Comes of bein' a artist, I suppose.\"    Miss Dore dived into her vanity case and produced a puff with which  she proceeded to powder her nose.    \"All composers are nuts, Mac. I was in a show once where the  manager was panning the composer because there wasn't a number in  the score that had a tune to it. The poor geek admitted they  weren't very tuney, but said the thing about his music was that it  had such a wonderful aroma. They all get that way. The jazz seems  to go to their heads. George is all right, though, and don't let  anyone tell you different.\"    \"Have you know him long, miss?\"    \"About five years. I was a stenographer in the house that published  his songs when I first met him. And there's another thing you've  got to hand it to George for. He hasn't let success give him a  swelled head. The money that boy makes is sinful, Mac. He wears  thousand dollar bills next to his skin winter and summer. But he's  just the same as he was when I first knew him, when he was just  hanging around Broadway, looking out for a chance to be allowed to  slip a couple of interpolated numbers into any old show that came  along. Yes. Put it in your diary, Mac, and write it on your cuff,  George Bevan's all right. He's an ace.\"    Unconscious of these eulogies, which, coming from one whose  judgment he respected, might have cheered him up, George wandered  down Shaftesbury Avenue feeling more depressed than ever. The sun  had gone in for the time being, and the east wind was frolicking  round him like a playful puppy, patting him with a cold paw,  nuzzling his ankles, bounding away and bounding back again, and  behaving generally as east winds do when they discover a victim who  has come out without his spring overcoat. It was plain to George  now that the sun and the wind were a couple of confidence  tricksters working together as a team. The sun had disarmed him  with specious promises and an air of cheery goodfellowship, and had  delivered him into the hands of the wind, which was now going  through him with the swift thoroughness of the professional hold-up  artist. He quickened his steps, and began to wonder if he was so  sunk in senile decay as to have acquired a liver.    He discarded the theory as repellent. And yet there must be a  reason for his depression. Today of all days, as Mac had pointed  out, he had everything to make him happy. Popular as he was in  America, this was the first piece of his to be produced in London,  and there was no doubt that it was a success of unusual dimensions.  And yet he felt no elation.    He reached Piccadilly and turned westwards. And then, as he passed  the gates of the In and Out Club, he had a moment of clear vision  and understood everything. He was depressed because he was bored,  and he was bored because he was lonely. Mac, that solid thinker,  had been right. The solution of the problem of life was to get hold  of the right girl and have a home to go back to at night. He was  mildly surprised that he had tried in any other direction for an  explanation of his gloom. It was all the more inexplicable in that  fully 80 per cent of the lyrics which he had set in the course of  his musical comedy career had had that thought at the back of them.    George gave himself up to an orgy of sentimentality. He seemed to  be alone in the world which had paired itself off into a sort of  seething welter of happy couples. Taxicabs full of happy couples  rolled by every minute. Passing omnibuses creaked beneath the  weight of happy couples. The very policeman across the Street had  just grinned at a flitting shop girl, and she had smiled back at  him. The only female in London who did not appear to be attached  was a girl in brown who was coming along the sidewalk at a  leisurely pace, looking about her in a manner that suggested that  she found Piccadilly a new and stimulating spectacle.    As far as George could see she was an extremely pretty girl, small  and dainty, with a proud little tilt to her head and the jaunty  walk that spoke of perfect health. She was, in fact, precisely the  sort of girl that George felt he could love with all the stored-up  devotion of an old buffer of twenty-seven who had squandered none  of his rich nature in foolish flirtations. He had just begun to  weave a rose-tinted romance about their two selves, when a cold  reaction set in. Even as he paused to watch the girl threading her  way through the crowd, the east wind jabbed an icy finger down the  back of his neck, and the chill of it sobered him. After all, he  reflected bitterly, this girl was only alone because she was on her  way somewhere to meet some confounded man. Besides there was no  earthly chance of getting to know her. You can't rush up to pretty  girls in the street and tell them you are lonely. At least, you  can, but it doesn't get you anywhere except the police station.  George's gloom deepened--a thing he would not have believed  possible a moment before. He felt that he had been born too late.  The restraints of modern civilization irked him. It was not, he  told himself, like this in the good old days.    In the Middle Ages, for example, this girl would have been a  Damsel; and in that happy time practically everybody whose  technical rating was that of Damsel was in distress and only too  willing to waive the formalities in return for services rendered by  the casual passer-by. But the twentieth century is a prosaic age,  when girls are merely girls and have no troubles at all. Were he  to stop this girl in brown and assure her that his aid and comfort  were at her disposal, she would undoubtedly call that large  policeman from across the way, and the romance would begin and end  within the space of thirty seconds, or, if the policeman were a  quick mover, rather less.    Better to dismiss dreams and return to the practical side of life  by buying the evening papers from the shabby individual beside him,  who had just thrust an early edition in his face. After all notices  are notices, even when the heart is aching. George felt in his  pocket for the necessary money, found emptiness, and remembered  that he had left all his ready funds at his hotel. It was just one  of the things he might have expected on a day like this.    The man with the papers had the air of one whose business is  conducted on purely cash principles. There was only one thing to be  done, return to the hotel, retrieve his money, and try to forget  the weight of the world and its cares in lunch. And from the hotel  he could despatch the two or three cables which he wanted to send  to New York.    The girl in brown was quite close now, and George was enabled to  get a clearer glimpse of her. She more than fulfilled the promise  she had given at a distance. Had she been constructed to his own  specifications, she would not have been more acceptable in George's  sight. And now she was going out of his life for ever. With an  overwhelming sense of pathos, for there is no pathos more bitter  than that of parting from someone we have never met, George hailed  a taxicab which crawled at the side of the road; and, with all the  refrains of all the sentimental song hits he had ever composed  ringing in his ears, he got in and passed away.    \"A rotten world,\" he mused, as the cab, after proceeding a couple  of yards, came to a standstill in a block of the traffic. \"A dull,  flat bore of a world, in which nothing happens or ever will happen.  Even when you take a cab it just sticks and doesn't move.\"    At this point the door of the cab opened, and the girl in brown  jumped in.    \"I'm so sorry,\" she said breathlessly, \"but would you mind hiding  me, please.\"        CHAPTER 3.    George hid her. He did it, too, without wasting precious time by  asking questions. In a situation which might well have thrown the  quickest-witted of men off his balance, he acted with promptitude,  intelligence and despatch. The fact is, George had for years been  an assiduous golfer; and there is no finer school for teaching  concentration and a strict attention to the matter in hand. Few  crises, however unexpected, have the power to disturb a man who has  so conquered the weakness of the flesh as to have trained himself  to bend his left knee, raise his left heel, swing his arms well out  from the body, twist himself into the shape of a corkscrew and use  the muscle of the wrist, at the same time keeping his head still  and his eye on the ball. It is estimated that there are  twenty-three important points to be borne in mind simultaneously  while making a drive at golf; and to the man who has mastered the  art of remembering them all the task of hiding girls in taxicabs is  mere child's play.

Ellen Willoughby, aged nine months, admitted for Meningitis; at present  suckled by a woman who has been _delivered one year and nine months_.           *       *       *       *       *    With respect to the manner in which protracted lactation causes the  complaint that forms the subject of these remarks, I formerly was  undecided; but have now no doubt whatever of its arising _secondarily_  from derangement in the functions of the abdominal viscera, occasioned  by the depraved condition of the breast-milk.    It is universally allowed among medical men that irritations in the  stomach and bowels will, through the agency of particular nerves,  produce sympathetic irritation in the brain,--that peculiar action  being thus elicited which terminates in the effusion of serum,  constituting the disease named Hydrocephalus.--'The continued irritation  of important or very sensible nerves is, perhaps,' says Mr. Burns, '_one  of the most common causes_' (of Hydrocephalus); 'hence it may follow  dentition, and _very often arises from a bad state of the chylopoietic  viscera_.'    It is also no less generally known that food of a bad quality or  improper description will produce derangements in the digestive organs.  Now, having already shewn that the milk when lactation is protracted  becomes deteriorated, it plainly appears that such milk is capable of  occasioning derangement of the chylopoietic viscera; and it being  allowed that derangement of these viscera, from any source, may give  rise to inflammation of the brain, I conceive it follows that protracted  lactation must be admitted as one cause of such effect. This train of  reasoning, therefore, from generally admitted data, seems to _prove that  Meningitis_, or inflammation of the brain, _in children can be produced  by their being suckled for too long a period_, and _that it is so  produced I assert from repeated experience_.    An accidental perusal of Mr. Dendy's able work on the cutaneous diseases  of children, published shortly after the appearance of my paper before  referred to in the Medical and Physical Journal, has recently afforded  me the pleasure of finding that the author had been led to entertain  similar general views on the subject under discussion with myself; I  have, therefore, taken the opportunity of adding that gentleman's  testimony to my own, by quoting the following passage from his work  above mentioned.    'It may be truly said, that _the infantine disease excited by milk of a  deleterious, or simply impoverished quality, \"grows by what it feeds  on;\"_ and we shall witness the internal debility and the infantine  disorder running their course together. Tabes is the natural consequence  of this error; but its effect is evinced by the occurrence of other  disorders. A defective degree of nutrition, as I have elsewhere stated,  predisposes the system to become influenced by comparatively slight  excitement; and thus, in addition to the direct excitement of disease,  it becomes indirectly its predisposing cause. _Under its influence the  serous_[L] and mucous _membranes become readily the seat of  inflammatory action_.'    Those who feel a difficulty in relinquishing old opinions and adopting  new views upon any particular subject, may perhaps ask how it has  happened, if inflammation of the brain from protracted suckling be so  common as the preceding observations and cases would appear to prove,  that medical men of more advanced age and far greater experience than  myself have not previously noticed the circumstance. I would observe, in  reply, that until Harvey pointed out the circulation of the blood, no  one ever suspected the existence of such a phenomenon; yet now the  wonder appears to be, not that Harvey made the discovery, but that  others had not previously done the same. Multitudes, it may be added,  and among them the great Newton, had witnessed the fall of objects to  the ground without thinking of the cause which produced their downward  tendency; the propitious moment, however, arrived--the apple fell, and  the philosopher was led to those deductions which have rendered his name  immortal. So is it with observers of every class, from those most  distinguished by intellectual superiority and its successful  application, down to the humble writer of the present observations.  Facts are continually passing before us unnoticed, till, from their  repeated coincidence, or some accidental impulse, we attempt, and  finally are enabled, to trace their origin.    Thus, until the possibility of Meningitis originating from protracted  lactation had been suggested, practitioners were, of course, unable to  notice the fact--not from its non-occurrence, but because their  unconsciousness of its existence must necessarily preclude the inquiries  from which alone its cause could be determined. Hence a practitioner may  have treated many hundred cases of water on the brain in children,  without being able to attribute any one of them to protracted suckling;  yet this is no proof that such cases did not happen, for, had he made  the requisite inquiries, very probably many among them might have been  found which had thus arisen.    Another objection that may possibly be made to my views, is, that  instances might be adduced where lactation had been persevered in for a  very long period, without any ill effects supervening. That such  frequently occur, there is no doubt; and with respect to them, I have  merely to observe, that they do not in the slightest degree invalidate  the correctness of my conclusions. As well might it be argued, that  because persons have fallen from a very great height without sustaining  any injury, or, because poisonous doses of various drugs have sometimes  been swallowed without death supervening, that, therefore, there is no  danger in jumping from a precipice, or in taking a virulent poison; or  that death never occurs from these causes. Such cases, unless far more  numerous than I imagine them, can only be regarded as exceptions to the  general rule; and, consequently, do not lessen its authority, there  being no rule without an exception.    Some practitioners, with whom I have conversed on the subject, though  willing to allow that protracted suckling, by depraving the milk, may be  the means of occasioning Meningitis in infants during or shortly after  the time they are supplied with this improper food, yet could not  conceive how it can act as a cause of that disease at some future  period; I do not myself, while attempting to account for it, discover  any pathological difficulty.    In these cases it is very probable, that although the protracted  suckling was not sufficient to produce actual Meningitis at its  conclusion, yet that it so weakened the system in general, and the brain  in particular, as to render the latter especially predisposed to  inflammatory action; and that we have reason to suppose this not only  possible, but probable, from analogy, cannot be denied, since it is  known that scrofulous children, in whom there is great laxity and  debility of habit, are inordinately liable to be affected with  Hydrocephalus, or Water in the Brain.    'Dr. Perceval observes, that of twenty-two cases of which he kept notes,  _eleven were certainly strumous children_, and _four were probably so_.'  'From my own observations,' remarks Dr. Cheyne, 'I should think this  proportion a very moderate one. When a whole family is swept away by  Hydrocephalus, I suspect _it is intimately connected with this strumous  taint_.' The testimony of Sauvages may also be adduced, who says, 'Novi  familiam cujus infantes circa sextum aetatis annum omnes periere ex hoc  morbo, _Scrofula huic effusioni ansam praebente_.' The brain, in  consequence of this local debility, may become affected from causes  which otherwise would, perhaps, have produced no injurious consequences  whatever; and hence it is, that when labouring under other diseases, and  especially Hooping-cough, those children who have been suckled too long  appear so very liable to have the head secondarily affected. It is  worthy of notice, that among the cases which have been detailed in the  foregoing pages, were fourteen in whom affection of the head supervened  during the progress of other diseases, and in ten of them the disease  was Hooping-cough.    The treatment of Meningitis arising from protracted suckling will not  differ from what is proper when it has been produced by other causes;  except that the depletory measures should not be carried to so great an  extent, as it must be remembered that the disease is existing in  constitutions _already debilitated_.    It should consist generally in the application of leeches to the  temples--cold lotions to the head--purgatives, and blisters placed  behind the ears, the discharge from which is to be kept up by means of  irritating dressings--these afford the surest chance of subduing the  malady, and in many instances, if employed sufficiently early, will have  the desired effect. It is, of course, almost superfluous to observe,  that weaning, if the child be above nine months old, must be  immediately enforced; or, if considerably younger, the diseased or  debilitated nurse ought to be exchanged for one who has a supply of  healthy milk of a corresponding age. If such cannot be procured, the  child must be brought up by hand; for, so long as it is allowed to  imbibe the noxious milk, there is little hope, in my mind, of the  medical treatment being of any great service; while on the contrary, it  is encouraging to know that many infants previously manifesting symptoms  of incipient Meningitis have completely recovered _soon after they were  weaned_[M].    When my attention first became directed to the subject, I was chiefly  struck with the ill effects resulting to the child from"]]]
