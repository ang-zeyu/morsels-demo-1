It is curious that, in spite of all the force that  was mustered against us, as soon as they saw that we were determined to  resist them, they immediately began to parley. The Sfaxee is an immense  talker, and great allowance must be made for what he says. In reality,  we shall never be able to know the exact truth with respect to this  affair. Dr. Overweg confesses that he was terribly alarmed as well he  might be. For my part, I was more used to desert dangers, and slept all  night. Dr. Barth very kindly refused to allow anybody to awaken me.          CHAPTER II.

The little fighi came, as  usual, to see me. I showed him the Arabic New Testament. He read a few  sentences, and then laid the book aside. I offered it to him, but he  refused to accept the inestimable present. He represents the feelings of  all the Muslims of these countries. They have not even any _curiosity_  to know the contents of the Gospel, much less the inclination to study  or appreciate them. They remain in a state of immovable, absolute  indifference. Even the beautiful manner in which the Arabic letters are  printed scarcely excites their surprise. En-Noor paid me his usual  morning visit, drank tea, and ate pickles and marmalade. We asked him  about meteors. He recollects the fall of many. One, he says, fell upon a  house, and terrified the inhabitants, who came running to him.  Afterwards they dug to the depth of a man, and found nothing, for it had  buried itself deep in the earth. According to him, a great profusion of  meteors denotes abundance of rain and herbage: but these phenomena exert  also a sinister influence like comets, signifying the death of some  great personage. I have no doubt that extraordinary meteors are very  frequent in this part of the Sahara. En-Noor was very condescending, as  usual: no change is observable in his manners.    It turned out that he had come with the intention of speaking on a very  delicate subject, but had refrained. We learned what it was afterwards.  Dr. Overweg was sent for in the course of the day to attend upon one of  En-Noor's wives, who had been frightfully beaten by his highness the  previous evening. This domestic broil formed the common topic of  conversation in Tintalous. Every scandal-monger has got hold of one  version of the story. From what we could gather, the great man was lying  down quietly, when suddenly, without any apparent provocation, he  started up, took a large stick from the fire, one of its ends still  burning, and with this terrific weapon belaboured his wife over the  face, striking especially at the mouth, and cutting the upper lip in  two. The poor woman is now very ill. No cause can be discovered for this  piece of brutality. En-Noor has, they pretend, two wives here, and one  on his estate at Damerghou; but he has only one son and three daughters.  No larger family has this great man, with all his wealth and slaves,  been able to bring up.    Beating a wife is so common in these countries, that, only when the act  is attended with features of unusual atrocity, as in this case of  En-Noor, does it excite any attention. There cannot be a question of the  fact, that our friend the Sultan is a great despot in every point of  view. Perhaps in no other way could he maintain any authority amongst  these semi-barbarian Kailouees. This, nevertheless, cannot excuse the  atrocity of beating his wife with burning fagots. Some say that the  exciting cause of his brutality was the eternal loquacity of the woman,  of which his highness began to be afraid. This may be true, or be only  an excuse invented by his courtiers. Supposing, however, the cause to  have been her _infidelity_, let us examine what can be reasonably  expected from these African women. They are not allowed scarcely to  believe themselves to possess souls; they have no moral motives to be  chaste, and certainly none of family and honour, being mostly slaves.  Then the greater part of the young girls of consequence are married to  old men, who are worn out by their sensual habits and indulgence with  innumerable concubines. These young women are thus left, though married,  like so many widows, without education or religious motives, and with  all their passions alive, to the first opportunity which presents  itself. We know what they do, and we cannot expect anything else from  them.    We have often dancing now of evenings. Yesterday, hearing the  tambourines and other instruments strike up, I went to the house of the  Sfaxee to see what was going on. They were dancing again their Mourzuk  dances before a number of delighted Kailouees, male and female; amongst  the rest Lady En-Noor herself. The whole beauty and appropriateness of  this exercise amongst the Moors consists, as is well known, in gross  imitations of natural acts. No further description or comment can I  permit myself. I have often thought that the present dance must be an  inheritance from very ancient times. There seems to be a part of our  nature to which it is adapted. The performances at European Operas are  often nearly as indelicate.    Evil communications corrupt good manners. One of our servants has  learned to act the Tuarick. He quarrelled with Yusuf, and on being told  to go away replied, \"Yes. I will go; but when you get up to Damerghou I  will bring down the people upon these Christians, and they shall be  eaten up!\"    _11th._--Zangheema, En-Noor's principal slave, came early this morning  for Dr. Overweg, that he might attend the \"beaten wife.\" My privileged  friend went accordingly, and visited at the same time all the women of  the household. They received him in a very friendly manner: some of them  proved nearly white.    _12th._--This day I finished my Kailouee vocabulary, which contains  about a thousand words. I have never yet collected so large a quantity  of materials of any of the languages of Africa. I carefully packed up my  vocabulary for England, and got it ready, with other matters, to send by  the first opportunity.    Dr. Overweg has again visited the belaboured wife this morning, and  reports her to be improving. The Sultan seems now to repent what he has  done, and is endeavouring to obtain forgiveness by kind and courteous  behaviour.    There was a great deal of wind to day, but it did not come in puffs,  endangering our tents. I sometimes wonder, however, how the flimsy huts  of which part of Tintalous is composed are not swept away. They are made  of the dry stalk of that excellent herb bou rekabah, called in Kailouee  _afada_.    _13th._--No news stirring to-day; nothing said of razzias; so much the  better. We are living very quietly here, and the climate agrees with me  extremely well. Some of our people, however, are sick.    _14th._--The mornings continue cold; 65 deg. outside the tent, and a few  degrees higher inside. This fresh weather, no doubt, accounts for my  good health.    According to a Tibboo merchant now here, and going with our caravan, the  people of Wadai would receive a Christian well, and allow him to visit  their country. He represents Wadai as a very rocky region, like Aheer,  with two large rivers in it running from south to north--not season  streams, but continual. He says that the people are all blacks, and a  very tall race. They have a language of their own, which is difficult to  learn. Warrah is the capital. The natives drink a great deal of _bouza_,  and are nearly always intoxicated. Such is a summary account of Wadai  from the mouth of a Tibboo geographer.    This morning, Madame En-Noor sent me by Zangheema a pair of pewter  earrings, in exchange for some rings. It is extremely difficult to make  a good bargain with these people. With respect to our merchandise, it  all sells lower here than we paid for it at Mourzuk. The profits come  from the purchase of slaves. A burnouse of forty mahboubs will sell in  Soudan for little more than its cost, if dollars or money is to be  given; but if slaves are taken in exchange, three slaves, perhaps, may  be obtained, which, in Tripoli, may be sold at forty or fifty dollars  each. Hence the profit of the Soudan commerce. The article which yields  the greatest profit is loaf sugar, which, costing half a dollar in  Mourzuk, is said to sell for a full dollar in Bornou. To be sure there  is all the risk and the heavy freight of such an article, especially if  conveyed up during the rainy season.    I wrote yesterday a despatch to Government, requesting letters of  recommendation to be sent up to me in Kordofan, pointing out the route  of Egypt as the probable one by which I shall return to the  Mediterranean. I had a long dispute with Overweg about the letter  _ghain_, which he persists in pronouncing like a strong _k_. Yusuf was  called in, and declared that the _ghain_ was the letter which  distinguished Arabic from all other languages. In Kailouee Tuarick there  is no _kaf_ or _ghain_. These Berber dialects have, however, the hard  _g_ in a thousand words, and have also the _k_ in a great number of  cases, but the hard _g_ and the _t_ are the consonants most frequently"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18556"],[0,"Catalogue of Violent and Destructive Earthquakes in the Philippines (#5)"],[1,"       |     |Laguna, Rizal, and Nueva Ecija.
