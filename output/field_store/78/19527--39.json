Said the Glass of Wine to his paler brother:  \"Let us tell tales of the past to each other;  I can tell of banquet and revel and mirth,  Where I was king, for I ruled in might;  For the proudest and grandest souls of earth  Fell under my touch, as though struck with blight.  From the heads of kings I have torn the crown;  From the heights of fame I have hurled men down.  I have blasted many an honored name;  I have taken virtue and given shame;  I have tempted youth with a sip, a taste,  That has made his future a barren waste.  Far greater than any king am I,  Or than any army beneath the sky.  I have made the arm of the driver fail,  And sent the train from the iron rail.  I have made good ships go down at sea.  And the shrieks of the lost were sweet to me.  Fame, strength, wealth, genius before me fall;  And my might and power are over all!  Ho, ho, pale brother,\" said the Wine,  \"Can you boast of deeds as great as mine?\"    Said the Water Glass: \"I cannot boast  Of a king dethroned, or a murdered host;  But I can tell of hearts that were sad,  By my crystal drops made bright and glad;  Of thirsts I have quenched and brows I have laved,  Of hands I have cooled, and souls I have saved.  I have leaped through the valley, dashed down the mountain,  Slipped from the sunshine, and dripped from the fountain,  I have burst my cloud-fetters, and dropped from the sky,  And everywhere gladdened the prospect and eye;  I have eased the hot forehead of fever and pain,  I have made the parched meadows grow fertile with grain.  I can tell of the powerful wheel of the mill,  That ground out the flour, and turned at my will.  I can tell of manhood debased by you  That I have uplifted and crowned anew;  I cheer, I help, I strengthen and aid,  I gladden the heart of man and maid;  I set the wine-chained captive free,  And all are better for knowing me.\"    These are the tales they told each other,  The Glass of Wine, and its paler brother,  As they sat together, filled to the brim,  On a rich man's table, rim to rim.        _Ella Wheeler Wilcox._            Abraham Lincoln    (_Written after Lincoln's death by Tom Taylor, famous cartoonist of the  London \"Punch.\"_)      _You_ lay a wreath on murdered Lincoln's bier!    _You_, who with mocking pencil wont to trace,  Broad for the self-complacent British sneer,    His length of shambling limb, his furrowed face,    His gaunt, gnarled hands, his unkempt, bristling hair,    His garb uncouth, his bearing ill at ease,  His lack of all we prize as debonair,    Of power or will to shine, of art to please!    _You_, whose smart pen backed up the pencil's laugh,    Judging each step, as though the way were plain;  Reckless, so it could point its paragraph,    Of chief's perplexity, or people's pain!    Beside this corpse, that bears for winding-sheet    The Stars and Stripes he lived to rear anew,  Between the mourners at his head and feet--    Say, scurril jester, is there room for you?    Yes, he had lived to shame me from my sneer--    To lame my pencil and confute my pen--  To make me own this hind, of princes peer,    This rail-splitter, a true-born king of men.    My shallow judgment I had learned to rue,    Noting how to occasion's height he rose;  How his quaint wit made home-truth seem more true,    How, iron-like, his temper grew by blows;    How humble, yet how hopeful he could be;    How in good fortune and in ill the same;  Nor bitter in success, nor boastful he,    Thirsty for gold, nor feverish for fame.    He went about his work--such work as few    Ever had laid on head, and heart, and hand--  As one who knows where there's a task to do,    Man's honest will must Heaven's good grace command;    Who trusts the strength will with the burden grow,    That God makes instruments to work His will,  If but that will we can arrive to know,    Nor tamper with the weights of good and ill.    So he went forth to battle, on the side    That he felt clear was Liberty's and Right's,  As in his peasant boyhood he had plied    His warfare with rude nature's thwarting mights;--    The uncleared forest, the unbroken soil,    The iron bark that turns the lumberer's axe,  The rapid, that o'erbears the boatman's toil,    The prairie, hiding the mazed wanderer's tracks,    The ambushed Indian and the prowling bear--    Such were the needs that helped his youth to train:  Rough culture--but such trees large fruit may bear,    If but their stocks be of right girth and grain.    So he grew up, a destined work to do,    And lived to do it: four long, suffering years  Ill-fate, ill-feeling, ill-report, lived through,    And then he heard the hisses change to cheers,    The taunts to tribute, the abuse to praise,    And took both with the same unwavering mood;  Till, as he came on light, from darkling days,    And seemed to touch the goal from where he stood,    A felon hand, between the goal and him,    Beached from behind his back, a trigger prest--  And those perplexed and patient eyes were dim,    Those gaunt, long-laboring limbs were laid to rest!    The words of mercy were upon his lips,    Forgiveness in his heart and on his pen,  When this vile murderer brought swift eclipse    To thoughts of peace on earth, goodwill to men.    The Old World and the New, from sea to sea,    Utter one voice of sympathy and shame!  Sore heart, so stopped when it at last beat high;    Sad life, cut short as its triumph came!          The Old Clock on the Stairs      Somewhat back from the village street  Stands the old-fashioned country-seat;  Across its antique portico  Tall poplar trees their shadows throw;  And, from its station in the hall,  An ancient timepiece says to all,         \"Forever--never!          Never--forever!\"    Half-way up the stairs it stands,  And points and beckons with its hands,  From its case of massive oak,  Like a monk who, under his cloak,  Crosses himself, and sighs, alas!  With sorrowful voice to all who pass,         \"Forever--never!          Never--forever!\"    By day its voice is low and light;  But in the silent dead of night,  Distinct as a passing footstep's fall,  It echoes along the vacant hall,  Along the ceiling, along the floor,  And seems to say at each chamber door,         \"Forever--never!          Never--forever!\"    Through days of sorrow and of mirth,  Through days of death and days of birth,  Through every swift vicissitude  Of changeful time, unchanged it has stood,  And as if, like God, it all things saw,  It calmly repeats those words of awe,         \"Forever--never!          Never--forever!\"    In that mansion used to be  Free-hearted Hospitality;  His great fires up the chimney roared;  The stranger feasted at his board;  But, like the skeleton at the feast,  That warning timepiece never ceased,--         \"Forever--never!          Never--forever!\"    There groups of merry children played;  There youths and maidens dreaming strayed;  Oh, precious hours! oh, golden prime  And affluence of love and time!  Even as a miser counts his gold,  Those hours the ancient timepiece told,--         \"Forever--never!          Never--forever!\"    From that chamber, clothed in white,  The bride came forth on her wedding night;  There, in that silent room below,  The dead lay, in his shroud of snow;  And, in the hush that followed the prayer,  Was heard the old clock on the stair,--         \"Forever--never!          Never--forever!\"    All are scattered, now, and fled,--  Some are married, some are dead;  And when I ask, with throbs of pain,  \"Ah! when shall they all meet again?\"  As in the days long since gone by,  The ancient timepiece makes reply,--         \"Forever--never!          Never-forever!\"    Never here, forever there,  Where all parting, pain, and care,  And death, and time, shall disappear,--  Forever there, but never here!  The horologe of Eternity  Sayeth this incessantly,--         \"Forever--never!          Never--forever!\"        _H.W. Longfellow._          Christ in Flanders      We had forgotten You, or very nearly--  You did not seem to touch us very nearly--    Of course we thought about You now and then;  Especially in any time of trouble--  We knew that you were good in time of trouble--    But we were very ordinary men.    And there were always other things to think of--  There's lots of things a man has got to think of--    His work, his home, his pleasure, and his wife;  And so we only thought of You on Sunday--  Sometimes, perhaps, not even on a Sunday--    Because there's always lots to fill one's life.    And, all the while, in street or lane or byway--  In country lane, in city street, or byway--    You walked among us, and we did  not see.  Your feet were bleeding as You walked our pavements--  How did we miss Your footprints on our pavements?--    Can there be other folk as blind as we?    Now we remember; over here in Flanders--  (It isn't strange to think of You in Flanders)--    This hideous warfare seems to make things clear.  We never thought about You much in England--  But now that we are far away from England--    We have no doubts, we know that You are here.    You helped us pass the jest along the trenches--  Where, in cold blood, we waited in the trenches--    You touched its ribaldry and made it fine.  You stood beside us in our pain and weakness--  We're glad to think You understand our weakness--    Somehow it seems to help us not to whine.    We think about You kneeling in the Garden--  Ah, God, the agony of that dread Garden--    We know You prayed for us upon the cross.  If anything could make us glad to bear it--  'Twould be the knowledge that You willed to bear it--    Pain--death--the uttermost of human loss.    Though we forgot You--You will not forget us--  We feel so sure that You will not forget us--    But stay with us until this dream is "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18910"],[0,"Diary of a Nursing Sister on the Western Front, 1914-1915 (#5)"],[1,"farewells of Matron and our friends, at 9.30 this morning. We are still  in the same train, and shall not reach Le Mans till 11 P.M. Then what?  Perhaps Station Duty, perhaps Hospital. There is said to be any amount  of work at Le Mans. We have an R.H.A. Battery on this train with guns,  horses, five officers, and trucks full of shouting and yelling men all  very fit, straight from home. One big officer said savagely, \"The first  man not carrying out orders will be sent down to the base,\" to one of  his juniors, as the worst threat. The spirits of the men are  irrepressible. The French people rush up wherever we stop (which is  extremely often and long) and give them grapes and pears and cigarettes.  We have had cider, coffee, fruit, chocolate, and biscuits-and-cheese at  intervals. It is difficult to get anything, because no one, French or  English, ever seems to know when the train is going on.    We have been reading in 'The Times' of September 3, 4, 5, and 7, all  day, and re-reading last night's mail from home.    What a marvellous spirit has been growing in all ranks of the Army (and  Navy) these last dozen years, to show as it is doing now. And the  technical perfection of all one saw at the Military Tournament this year  must have meant a good deal--for this War.    (We are still shunting madly in and out of Angers.)          II.

There is but one task for all--            For each one life to give,            Who stands if freedom fall?            Who dies if England live?\"              --RUDYARD KIPLING.          II.    Le Mans.    WOUNDED FROM THE AISNE.    _September 15, 1914, to October 11, 1914._    Station duty--On train duty--Orders again--Waiting to go--Still at Le  Mans--No.-- Stationary Hospital--Off at last--The Swindon of France.      _Tuesday, September 15th._--The train managed to reach Le Mans at 1 A.M.  this morning, and kindly shunted into a siding in the station till 6.30  A.M., so we got out our blankets and had a bit of a sleep. At 7 a motor  ambulance took us up to No.-- Stationary Hospital, which is a rather  grimy Bishop's Palace, pretty full and busy. The Sisters there gave us  tea and biscuits, and we were then sorted out by the Senior Matron, and  billeted singly. I'm in a nice little house with a garden with an old  French lady who hasn't a word of English, and fell on my neck when she  found I could understand her, and patter glibly and atrociously back.  My little room has a big window over the garden, and will, I suppose, be  my headquarters for the present in between train and station duty, which  I believe is to be our lot. We go to a rather dim cafe for meals, and  shall then learn what the duty is to be. It is yet a long time coming.  We haven't had a meal since the day before yesterday, so I shall be glad  when 12 o'clock comes. Now for a wash.      _Wednesday, September 16th._--Still here: only four of the twenty-five  (five sets of five) who formed our unit have been found jobs so far: two  are taking a train of sick down to St Nazaire, and two have joined No.--  Stationary Hospital in the town. We still await orders! This is a  first-class War for awaiting orders for some of us.    Yesterday it poured all day. We explored the Cathedral, which is  absolutely beautiful, perched high up over an open space--now crowded  with transport and motor ambulances. We made tea in my quarters, and  then explored the town; narrow streets thronged with Tommies as usual.    We have lunch at eleven and dinner at seven, at a dingy little inn  through a smelly back yard; there is not much to eat, and you fill up  with rather nasty bread and unripe pears, and drink a sort of flat  cider, as the water is not good.    To-day it is sunny again. I have just been to High Mass (Choral), and  taken photos of the Cathedral and the Market below, where I got four  ripe peaches for 1-1/2d.    Writing in the garden of Mme. Bontevin, my landlady.    There is any amount of work here at the Bishop's Palace; more than they  can get through on night duty with bad cases, and another Jesuit College  has been opened as No.-- Stationary. Went up to No.-- S. this afternoon  where F---- has been sent, to see her; she asked me to go out and buy  cakes for six wounded officers. They seemed highly pleased with them;  they are on beds, the men on stretchers; all in holland sheets and brown  blankets; only bare necessaries, as the Stationary Hospitals have to be  very mobile: stretchers make very decent beds, but they are difficult  for nursing.    They have had a good many deaths, surgical and medical, at L'Eveche;  they have pneumonias, and paralysis, and septic wounds, and an officer  shot through the head, with a temperature of 106 and paralysis; there is  a civil surgeon with a leg for amputation at No.-- Stationary.      _Friday, September 18th._--Meme chose. We go up to the Hospital and ask  for orders, and to-night we were both told to get into ward uniform in  the morning, and wait there in case a job turns up. I've just come  to-night from No.-- Station where F---- is, to take her some things she  asked me to get for her officers.    They have been busy at the station to-day doing dressings on the trains.  A lot have come down from this fighting on the Marne.    Yesterday I think one touched the bottom of this waiting business. The  food at the dingy inn has derange my inside, and I lay down all day  yesterday. The Sergeant at the Dispensary prescribed lead and opium  pills for me when I asked for chlorodyne, as he said he'd just cured a  General with the same complaint--from the sour bread, he said. Fanny,  the fat cook here, and Isabel the maid, were overcome with anxiety over  my troubles, and fell over each other with hot bottles, and drinks, and  advice. They are perfect angels. Madame Bontevin pays me a state call  once a day; she has to have all the windows shut, and we sit close and  converse with animation. Flowery French compliments simply fly between  us. We often have to help the Tommies out with their shopping; their  attempts to buy Beecham's Pills are the funniest.    This afternoon I found 'The Times' of September 15th (Tuesday of this  week) in a shop and had a happy time with it. It referred, in a  Frenchman's letter, to a sunset at Havre on an evening that he would  never forget--nor shall I--with an American cruiser and a troopship  going out. (See page 24 of this effusion.)      _Saturday, September 19th._--It seems that we five No.--s who came up  last Monday are being kept to staff another Stationary Hospital farther  up, when it is ready; at least that is what it looks like from sundry  rumours--if so--good enough.    We have been all day in caps and aprons at L'Eveche, marking linen and  waiting for orders on the big staircase. I've also been over both  hospitals. The bad cases all seem to be dropped here off the trains;  there are some awful mouth, jaw, head, leg, and spine cases, who can't  recover, or will only be crippled wrecks. You can't realise that it has  all been done on purpose, and that none of them are accidents or  surgical diseases. And they seem all to take it as a matter of course;  the bad ones who are conscious don't speak, and the better ones are all  jolly and smiling, and ready \"to have another smack.\" One little room  had two wounded German prisoners, with an armed guard. One who was shot  through the spine died while I was there--his orderly and the Sister  were with him. The other is a spy--nearly well--who has to be very  carefully watched.    They are all a long time between the field and the Hospital. One told me  he was wounded on Tuesday--was one day in a hospital, and then  travelling till to-day, Saturday. No wonder their wounds are full of  straw and grass. (Haven't heard of any more tetanus.) Most haven't had  their clothes off, or washed, for three weeks, except face and hands.    No war news to-day, except that the Germans are well fortified and  entrenched in their positions N. of Rheims.      _Sunday, September 20th._--Began with early service at the Jesuit School  Hospital at 6.30, and the rest of the day one will never forget. The  fighting for these concrete entrenched positions of the Germans behind  Rheims has been so terrific since last Sunday that the number of  casualties has been enormous. Three trains full of wounded, numbering  altogether 1175 cases, have been dressed at the station to-day; we were  sent down at 11 this morning. The train I was put to had 510 cases. You  boarded a cattle-truck, armed with a tray of dressings and a pail; the  men were lying on straw; had been in trains for several days; most had  only been dressed once, and many were gangrenous. If you found one  urgently needed amputation or operation, or was likely to die, you  called an M.O. to have him taken off the train for Hospital. No one  grumbled or made any fuss. Then you joined the throng in the  dressing-station, and for hours doctors of all ranks, Sisters and  orderlies, grappled with the stream of stretchers, and limping,  staggering, bearded, dirty, fagged men, and ticketed them off for the  motor ambulances to the Hospitals, or back to the train, after dressing  them. The platform was soon packed with stretchers with all the bad  cases waiting patiently to be taken to Hospital. We cut off the silk  vest of a dirty, brigandish-looking officer, nearly finished with a  wound through his lung. The Black Watch and Camerons were almost  unrecognisable in their rags. The staple dressing is tincture of iodine;  you don't attempt anything but swabbing with lysol, and then gauze  dipped in iodine. They were nearly all shrapnel shell wounds--more  ghastly than anything I have ever seen or smelt; the Mauser wounds of  the"]]]
