The solemn dedication  of the palace took place on January 14th, of the year 26 before Christ.  Here he lived, sleeping always in the same small cubiculum, for  twenty-eight years; that is to say, until the third year after Christ,  when the palace was almost destroyed by fire.    As soon as the news of the disaster spread throughout the empire, an  almost incredible amount of money was subscribed at once, by all orders  of citizens, to provide him with a new residence; and altho, with his  usual moderation, he would consent to accept only one denarius from each  individual subscribed, it is easy to imagine how many millions he must  have realized in spite of his modesty. A new, magnificent palace rose  from the ruins of the old one, but it does not appear that the plan and  arrangement were changed; otherwise Augustus could not have continued to  sleep in the same room during the last ten years of his life, as we are  told positively that he did.    The work of Augustus was continued by his successor and kinsman,  Tiberius, who built a new wing near the northwest corner of the hill,  overlooking the Velabrum. Caligula filled with new structures the whole  space between the \"domus Tiberiana\" and the Roman forum. Nero, likewise,  occupied with a new palace the south-east corner of the hill,  overlooking the valley, where the Coliseum was afterward built. Domitian  rebuilt the \"domus Augustana,\" injured by fire, adding to its  accommodations a stadium for gymnastic sports. The same emperor raised  an altogether new palace, in the space between the house of Augustus, on  one side, and those of Caligula and Tiberius on the other. Septimius  Severus and his son restored the whole group of imperial buildings,  adding a new wing at the southwest corner, known under the name of  Septizonium. The latest additions, of no special importance, took place  under Julia Mamaea and Heliogabalus.    Every emperor, to a certain extent, enlarged, altered, destroyed, and  reconstructed the work of his predecessors; cutting new openings,  walling up old ones, subdividing large rooms into smaller apartments,  and changing their destination. One section alone of the imperial  Palatine buildings remained unaltered, and kept the former simplicity of  its plans down to the fall of the Empire--the section built by Augustus  across the center of the hill, which comprised the main entrance, the  portico surrounding the temple of Apollo, the temple itself, the Greek  and Latin libraries, the shrine of Vesta, and the imperial residence.    The architectural group raised by Augustus on the Palatine, formed, as  it were, the vestibule to his own imperial residence. We know with  absolute certainty that it contained at least one hundred and twenty  columns of the rarest kinds of marbles and breccias, fifty-two of which  were of Numidian marble, with capitals of gilt bronze; a group of  Lysias, comprising one chariot, four horses and two drivers, all cut in  a single block of marble; the Hercules of Lysippus; the Apollo of  Scopas; the Latona of Cephisodotos, the Diana of Timotheos; the  bas-reliefs of the pediment by Bupalos and Anthermos; the quadriga of  the sun in gilt bronze; exquisite ivory carvings; a bronze colossus  fifty feet high; hundreds of medallions in gold, silver, and bronze;  gold and silver plate; a collection of gems and cameos; and, lastly,  candelabras which had been the property of Alexander the Great, and the  admiration of the East.    Has the world ever seen a collection of greater artistic and material  value exhibited in a single building? And we must recollect that the  group built by Augustus comprises only a very modest section of the  Palatine; that to his palace we must join the palaces of Tiberius,  Caligula, Nero, Vespasian, Domitian, Septimius Serverus, Julia Mamaea,  and Heliogabalus; that each one of these imperial residences equalled  the residence of Augustus, if not in pure taste, certainly in wealth, in  luxury, in magnificence, in the number and value of works of art  collected and stolen from Greece and the East, from Egypt and Persia. By  multiplying eight or ten times the list I have given above, the reader  will get an approximate idea of the \"home\" of the Roman emperors in its  full pride and glory. I have deliberately excluded from my description  the residence or private house of Augustus, because he himself had  deliberately excluded from it any trace of that grandeur he had so  lavishly bestowed on the buildings which constituted the approach to  it....    During the rule of Claudius, the successor of Caligula, little or  nothing was done toward the enlargement or the embellishment of the  palace of the Caesars. Nero, however, the successor of Claudius,  conceived the gigantic plan of renewing and of rebuilding from the very  foundations, not only the imperial residence, but the whole metropolis.  In the rebuilding of the city the emperor secured for himself the lion's  share; and his Golden House, of which we possess such beautiful remains,  occupied the whole extent from the Palatine to the Quirinal, where now  the central railway station has been erected. Its area amounted to  nearly a square mile, and this enormous district was appropriated, or  rather usurped, by the emperor, right in the center of a city numbering  about two million inhabitants.    Of the wonders of the Golden House it is enough to say that there were  comprised within the precincts of the enchanting residence waterfalls  supplied by an aqueduct fifty miles long, lakes and rivers shaded by  dense masses of foliage, with harbors and docks for the imperial  galleys; a vestibule containing a bronze colossus one hundred and twenty  feet high; porticos three thousand feet long; farms and vineyards,  pasture grounds and woods teeming with the rarest and costliest kind of  game, zoological and botanical gardens; sulfur baths supplied from  springs twelve miles distant; sea baths supplied from the waters of the  Mediterranean, sixteen miles distant at the nearest point; thousands of  columns crowned with capitals of Corinthian gilt metal; thousands of  statues stolen from Greece and Asia Minor; walls encrusted with gems and  mother-of-pearl; banqueting-halls with ivory ceilings, from which rare  flowers and precious perfumes could fall gently on the recumbent  guests.    More marvelous still was the ceiling of the state dining-room. It was  spherical in shape, and cut in ivory, to represent the constellated  skies, and kept in constant motion by machinery in imitation of the  movements of the stars and planets. All these details sound like  fairy-tales, like the dream of a fertile imagination; still they are  described minutely by contemporary and serious writers, by Suetonius, by  Martial and by Tacitus. Suetonius adds that the day Nero took possession  of his Golden House, he was heard to exclaim, \"At last I am lodged like  a man.\"    The wonders created by him, however, did not last very long. Otho, his  successor, on the very day of his election to the throne, signed an  order of fifty millions of sesterces (two million dollars) to bring the  Golden House to perfection; but after his murder Vespasian and Titus  gave back to the people the greater portion of the ground usurped by  Nero. They built the Coliseum on the very site of Nero's artificial  lake, and the thermae of Titus on the foundation of his private palace;  they respected only that portion of Nero's insane construction which was  comprised within the boundaries of the Palatine hill.          THE COLISEUM[8]    BY GEORGE STILLMAN HILLARD      The Venerable Bede, who lived in the eighth century, is the first person  who is known to have given to the Flavian amphitheater its comparatively  modern and now universal designation of the Coliseum; tho the name,  derived from a colossal statue of the emperor Nero which stood near it,  was probably then familiar to men's ears, as we may infer from his so  calling it without explanation or remark.    When in its perfect state, the exterior, with its costly ornaments in  marble, and its forest of columns, lost the merit of simplicity without  gaining that of grandeur. The eye was teased with a multitude of  details, not in themselves good; the same defects were repeated in each  story, and the real height was diminished by the projecting and  ungraceful cornices. The interior arrangements were admirable; and  modern architects can not sufficiently commend the skill with which  eighty thousand spectators were accommodated with seats; or the  ingenious contrivances, by which, through the help of spacious  corridors, multiplied passages, and staircases, every person went  directly to his place, and immense audiences were dispersed in less time  than is required for a thousand persons to squeeze through the entries  of a modern concert-room. We know that this interior of the Coliseum was  decorated with great splendor. The principal seats were of marble, and  covered with cushions. Gilded gratings, ornaments of gold, ivory, and  amber, and mosaics of precious stones, displayed the generosity of the  emperors, and gratified the taste of the people.    How, or at what period, the work of ruin first began does not distinctly  appear. An earthquake may have first shattered its ponderous arches, and  thus made an opening for the destroying hand of time. There can be no  doubt that it suffered violence from the hands of civil and foreign war.  But more destructive agencies than those of earthquake, conflagration or  war, were let loose upon it. Its massive stones, fitted to each other  with such nice adaptation, presented a strong temptation to the cupidity  of wealthy nobles and cardinals, with whom building was a ruling  passion; and for many ages the Coliseum became a quarry. The Palazzo  della Cancelleria, the Palazzo Barberini, the Palazzo"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18846"],[0,"Voodoo Planet (#5)"],[1," three  from the _Queen_--lifting over the rim of mountains behind the  fortress-palace and speeding north with the rising sun a flaming ball to  the east. Below, the country was stark--rocks and peaks, deep purple  shadows marking the veins of crevices. But that was swiftly behind and  they were over a sea of greens, many shades of green, with yellow, blue,  even red cutting into the general verdant carpet of treetops. Another  chain of heights and then open land, swales of tall grass already burnt  yellow by the steady sun. There was a river here, a crazy, twisted  stream coiling nearly back upon itself at times.    Once more broken land, land so ravished by prehistoric volcanic action  that it was a grotesque nightmare of erosion-whittled outcrops and  mesas. Asaki pointed to the east. There was a dark patch widening out  into a vast wedge.    \"The swamp of Mygra. It has not yet been explored.\"    \"You could air map it,\" Tau began.    The Chief Ranger was frowning. \"Four flitters have been lost trying  that. Com reports fail when they cross that last mountain ridge  eastward. There is some sort of interference which we do not yet  understand. Mygra is a place of death; later we may be able to travel  along its fringe and then you shall see. Now--\" He spoke to the pilot in  his own tongue and the flitter pointed up-nose at an angle as they  climbed over the highest peak they had yet seen in this mountainous  land, to reach at last a country of open grass dotted with small forest  stands. Jellico nodded approvingly.    \"Zoboru?\"    \"Zoboru,\" Asaki assented. \"We shall go up to the northern end of the  preserve. I wish to show you the roosts of the fastals. This is their  nesting season and the sight is one you will long remember. But we shall  take an eastern course; I have two Ranger stations to check on the way.\"    It was after they left the second station that the flitter swung  farther out eastward, again climbing over the chain of heights to sight  one of the newly discovered wonders the staff at the last station had  reported--a crater lake.    And the flitter skimmed down across water which was a rich emerald in  hue, filling the crater from one rock wall to the other with no beach at  the foot of those precipitant cliffs. As the machine arose to clear the  far wall, Dane tensed. One of his duties aboard the _Queen_ was flitter  pilot for planetwise trips. And ever since they had taken off that  morning he had unconsciously flown with the Khatkan pilot, anticipating  each change or adjustment of the controls. Now he felt that sluggish  response to the other's lift signal, and instinctively his own hand went  out to adjust a power feed lever.    They made the rise, were well above the danger of the cliff wall. But  the machine was not responding properly. Dane did not need to watch the  pilot's swiftly moving hands to guess that they were in trouble. And his  slight concern deepened into something else as the flitter began to drop  nose again. In front of him, Captain Jellico shifted uneasily, and Dane  knew that he, too, was alerted.    Now the pilot had plunged the power adjuster to the head against the  control board. But the nose of the flitter acted as if it were  overweighted or magnetically attracted by the rocks below. The best  efforts of the man flying it could not keep it level. They were being  drawn earthward, and all the pilot could do only delayed the inevitable  crack-up. The Khatkan was turning the machine north to avoid what lay  below, for here a long arm of the Mygra swamp clasped about the foot of  the mountain.    The Chief Ranger spoke into the mike of the com unit while the pilot  continued to fight against the pull which was bringing them down. Now  the small machine was below the level of the volcanic peak which cradled  the lake, and the mountain lay between them and the preserve.    Asaki gave a muffled exclamation, slapped the com box, spoke more  sharply into the mike. It was apparent he was not getting the results  he wanted. Then with a quick glance about he snapped an order:    \"Strap in!\"    His Terran companions had already buckled the wide webbing belts  intended to save them from crash shock. Dane saw the pilot push the  button to release fend cushions. In spite of his pounding heart, a small  fraction of his brain recognized the other's skill as the Khatkan took a  course to bring them down on a relatively level patch of sand and  gravel.    Dane raised his head from the shelter of his folded arms. The Chief  Ranger was busy with the pilot, who lay limply against the controls.  Captain Jellico and Tau were already pulling at the buckles of their  protective crash belts. But one look at the front of the flitter told  Dane that it would not take to the air again without extensive repairs.  Its nose was bent up and back, obscuring the forward view completely.  However, the pilot had made a miraculously safe landing considering the  terrain.    Ten minutes later, the pilot restored to consciousness and the gash in  his head bandaged, they held a council of war.    \"The com was off, too. I did not have a chance to report before the  crash,\" Asaki put the situation straightly. \"And our exploring parties  have not yet mapped this side of the range; it has a bad reputation  because of the swamp.\"    Jellico measured the heights now to their west with resigned eyes.  \"Looks as if we climb.\"    \"Not here,\" the Chief Ranger corrected him. \"There is no passing through  the crater lake region on foot. We must travel south along the edge of  the mountain area until we do find a scalable way into the preserve  region.\"    \"You seem very certain we are not going to be rescued if we stay right  here,\" Tau observed. \"Why?\"    \"Because I'm inclined to believe that any flitter that tries to reach us  may run into the same trouble. Also, they have no com fix on us. It will  be at least a day or more before they will even begin to count us  missing, and then they will have the whole northern portion of the  preserve to comb; there are not enough men here--I can give you a  multitude of reasons, Medic.\"    \"One of which might be sabotage?\" demanded Jellico.    Asaki shrugged. \"Perhaps. I am not loved in some quarters. But there may  also be something fatal to flitters here as there is over Mygra. We  thought the crater lake district safely beyond the swamp influence, but  it may not be so.\"    But you took the chance of traveling over it, Dane thought, though he  did not comment aloud. Was this another of the Chief Ranger's attempts  to involve them in some private trouble of his own? Though to  deliberately smash up a flitter and set them all afoot in this  wilderness was a pretty drastic move.    Asaki had started to unload emergency supplies from the flitter. They  each had a trail bag for a pack. But when the pilot staggered over to  pull out a set of stass belts and Jellico began to uncoil them, the  Chief Ranger shook his head.    \"With the feeder beam shut off by the mountains, I fear those will no  longer work.\"    Jellico tossed one on the crumpled nose of the flitter and punched its  button with the tip of the needler barrel. Then he threw a rock at the  dangling belt. The stone landed, taking the wide protective band with it  to the ground. That force field which should have warded off the missile  was not working.    \"Oh, fine!\" Tau opened his trail bag to pack concentrates. Then he  smiled crookedly. \"We aren't signed in for killing licenses, sir. Do you  pay our fines if we are forced to shoot a hole through something that  disputes the right of way?\"    To Dane's surprise, the Chief Ranger laughed. \"You are off preserve now,  Medic Tau. The rules do not cover wild land. But I would suggest we now  hunt a cave before nightfall.\"    \"Lions?\" asked Jellico.    Dane, remembering the black and white beast Lumbrilo had presented, did  not enjoy that thought. They had--his gaze went from man to man checking  weapons--the needler Asaki carried, and another the pilot had slung by  its carrying strap over his shoulder. Tau and the captain both were  armed with blasters and he had a fire ray and a force blade, both  considered small arms but deadly enough perhaps even to dampen a lion's  enthusiasm for the chase.    \"Lions, graz, rock apes,\" Asaki fastened the mouth of his trail bag.  \"All are hunters or killers. The graz send out scouts, and they are big  and formidable enough to have no enemies. Lions hunt with intelligence  and skill. Rock apes are dangerous, but luckily they cannot keep silent  when they scent their prey and so give one warning.\"    As they climbed up-slope from the flitter, Dane, looking back, saw that  perhaps Asaki was right in his belief that they had better try to help  themselves rather than wait for rescue. Putting aside the excuse of  fearing another crack-up, the wrecked flitter made no outstanding mark  on the ground. The higher they climbed, the less it could be  distinguished from the tumble of rocks about it.    He had lagged a little behind and, when he hurried to catch up, found  Jellico standing with his distance vision lenses to his eyes, directing  them toward that shadow marking the swamp. As the younger spaceman  reached him, the captain lowered the glasses and spoke:    \"Take your knife, Thorson, and hold it close to that rock--over there.\"  He pointed to a rounded black knob protruding from the soil a little off  their path.    Dane obeyed, only to have the blade jerk in his hand. And when he  loosened his hold in amazement, the steel slapped tight against the  stone.    \"Magnetic!\"    \"Yes. Which might explain our crash. Also this.\" Jellico held out a  field compass to demonstrate that its needle had gone completely mad.    \"We can use the mountain range itself for a guide,\" Dane said with more  confidence than he felt.    \"True enough. But we may have trouble when we head west again.\" Jellico  let the lenses swing free on their cord about "]]]
