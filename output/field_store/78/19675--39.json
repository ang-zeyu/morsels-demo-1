Thank goodness,  she's rheumatic or something, and we can open our mouths there.  I say,\"  added he, looking critically at my hands, \"you'd better give those nails  of yours a cut, or you'll get potted again.\"    I was grateful for this hint, and felt in my pocket for my knife.  In  doing so I encountered the box of sweets Mrs Hudson had left in my hand  yesterday, and which, amid other distractions, I had positively  forgotten.  \"Oh, look here,\" said I, producing the box, delighted to be  able to do a good turn to my friendly schoolfellow.  \"Have some of  these, will you?\"    Flanagan's face, instead of breaking out into grateful smiles, as I  anticipated, assumed a sudden scowl, and at the same moment Miss  Henniker entered the dormitory!    Quick as thought I plunged the box back into my pocket, and looked as  unconcerned as it was possible to do under the trying circumstances.    \"Flanagan and Batchelor, a bad mark each for talking,\" said the now  painfully familiar voice.  \"What have you there, Batchelor?\" added she,  holding out her hand.  \"Something Mrs Hudson gave me,\" I replied.    \"I wish to see it.\"    I was prepared to resist.  I could stand a good deal, but sheer robbery  was a thing I never fancied.  However, a knowing look on Flanagan's face  warned me to submit, and I produced the box.    The lady took it and opened it.  Then closing it, she put it in her own  pocket, saying--    \"This is confiscated till the end of the term.  Flanagan and Batchelor,  `Show nails.'\"    We did show nails.  Mine still needed some trimming before they were  satisfactory, and then I was bidden descend to the parlour for prayers.    Prayers at Stonebridge House consisted of a few sentences somewhat  quickly uttered by Mr Ladislaw, who put in an appearance for the  occasion, followed by a loud \"Amen\" from Miss Henniker, and in almost  the same breath, on this occasion, the award of a bad mark to Philpot  for having opened his eyes twice during the ceremony.    After this we partook of a silent breakfast, and adjourned for study.  Miss Henniker dogged us wherever we went and whatever we did.  She sat  and glared at us all breakfast time; she sat and glared at us while Mr  Ladislaw, or Mr Hashford, the usher, were drilling Latin grammar and  arithmetic into us.  She sat and glared while we ate our dinner, and she  stood and glared when after school we assembled in the boot-room and  prepared to escape to the playground.  Even there, if we ventured to  lift our voices too near the house, a bad mark was shot at us from a  window, and if an unlucky ball should come within range of her claws it  was almost certainly \"confiscated.\"    I don't suppose Stonebridge House, except for Miss Henniker, was much  worse than most schools for \"backward and troublesome boys.\"  We were  fairly well fed, and fairly well taught, and fairly well quartered.  I  even think we might have enjoyed ourselves now and then, had we been  left to ourselves.  But we never _were_ left to ourselves.  From morning  to night, and, for all we could tell, from night till morning, we were  looked after by the lady housekeeper, and that one fact made Stonebridge  House almost intolerable.    We were lounging about in the so-called \"playground\" that afternoon, and  I was beginning to discover a little more about some of my new  schoolfellows, when there appeared walking towards us down the gravel  path a boy about my own age.    He was slender and delicate-looking, I remember, and his pale face  contrasted strangely with his almost black clustering hair and his dark  big eyes.  He wasn't a handsome boy, I remember thinking; but there was  something striking about him, for all that.  It may have been his solemn  expression, or his square jaw, or his eyes, or his brow, or his hair, or  the whole of them put together.  All I know is, that the sight of him as  he appeared that afternoon walking towards us in the playground, has  lived in my memory ever since, and will probably live there till I die.    \"Here comes the new boy,\" said Philpot.  Of course we all knew it must  be he.    \"And a queer fish, too, by all appearances,\" responded Flanagan.    \"Very queer indeed,\" said Hawkesbury.  Hawkesbury was one of the two  \"backwards,\"--but for all that he was the cleverest boy, so the others  told me, in the whole school.    \"He doesn't seem very bashful,\" said another.    Nor indeed did he.  He sauntered slowly down the path, looking solemnly  now on one side, now on the other, and now at us all, until presently he  stood in our midst, and gazed half inquiringly, half doubtfully, from  one to the other.    I know I felt a good deal more uncomfortable than he did himself, and  was quite glad when Flanagan broke the solemn silence.    \"Hullo, youngster, who are you, eh?\"    \"Smith,\" laconically replied the new boy, looking his questioner in the  face.    There was nothing impudent in the way he spoke or looked; but somehow or  other his tone didn't seem quite as humble and abject as old boys are  wont to expect from new.  Flanagan's next inquiry therefore was a little  more roughly uttered.    \"What's your Christian name, you young donkey?  You don't suppose you're  the only Smith in the world, do you?\"    We laughed at this.  It wasn't half bad for Flanagan.    The new boy, however, remained quite solemn as he replied, briefly,  \"John Smith.\"    \"And where do you come from?\" said Philpot, taking up the questioning,  and determining to get more out of the new-comer than Flanagan had; \"and  who's your father, do you hear? and how many sisters have you got? and  why are you sent here? and are you a backward or a troublesome, eh?\"    The new boy gazed in grave bewilderment at the questioner during this  speech.  When it was ended, he quietly proceeded to move off to another  part of the playground without vouchsafing any reply.    But Philpot, who was on his mettle, prevented this manoeuvre by a sudden  and dexterous grip of the arm, and drew him back into the circle.    \"Do you hear what I say to you?\" said he, roughly, emphasising his  question with a shake.  \"What on earth do you mean by going off without  answering?\"    \"It's no business of yours, is it?\" said the new boy, mildly.    \"Yes,\" exclaimed Philpot, \"it is.  You don't suppose we fellows are  going to be humbugged by a young sneak like you, do you?\"    \"I sha'n't tell you, then!\" quietly replied Smith.    This astounding reply, quietly as it was uttered, quite took away  Philpot's breath, and the breath of all of us.  We were so astonished,  indeed, that for some time no one could utter a word or make up his mind  what to do next.    Then gradually it dawned on the company generally that this defiant,  stuck-up youngster must immediately be put down.    \"Come here!\" said Philpot, as majestically as he could.    Smith remained where he was, as solemn as ever.  But I, who stood near,  could detect a queer light in his black eyes that looked rather ominous.    When one fellow, in the presence of an admiring audience, grandly orders  a junior to \"Come here!\" and when that junior coolly declines to move,  it is a very critical situation both for the boy who orders and the boy  who disobeys.  For the one, unless he follows up his brag, will pretty  certainly be laughed at; and the other, unless he shows the white  feather and runs away, will generally come in for a little rough usage.  This seemed likely to happen now.  As Smith would not come to Philpot  for a thrashing, Philpot must go to Smith and thrash him where he stood.  And so doubtless he would have done, had not Mr Hashford appeared at  that very moment on the gravel walk and summoned us in to preparation.    This interruption was most unsatisfactory.  Those who wanted to see what  the new boy was made of were disappointed, and those whose dignity  wanted putting to-rights were still more disappointed.    But there was no helping it.  We trailed slowly indoors, Philpot vowing  he would be quits with the young cub some day, and Hawkesbury, in his  usual smiling way, suggesting that \"the new boy didn't seem a very nice  boy.\"    \"I know what _I_ should do,\" said Flanagan, \"if I--\"    \"A bad mark to Flanagan for not coming in quietly,\" said the voice of  Miss Henniker; and at the sound the spirit went out from us, and we  remembered we were once more in Stonebridge House.    \"Preparation\" was a dreadful time.  I knew perfectly well, though I  could not see her, that Miss Henniker's eyes were upon me all the time.  I could feel them on the back of my head and the small of my back.  You  never saw such an abject spectacle as we nine spiritless youths appeared  bending over our books, hardly daring to turn over a leaf or dip a pen,  for fear of hearing that hateful voice.  I could not help, however,  turning my eyes to where the new boy sat, to see how he was faring.  He,  too, seemed infected with the depressing air of the place, and was  furtively looking round among his new schoolfellows.  I felt half  fascinated by his black eyes, and when presently they turned and met  mine, I almost thought I liked the new boy.  My face must somehow have  expressed what was passing through my mind, for as our eyes met there  was a very faint smile on his lips, which I could not help returning.    \"Batchelor and Smith, a bad mark each for inattention.  That makes four  bad marks to Batchelor in one day.  No playground for half a week!\"    Cheerful!  I was getting used to the lady by this time, and remember  sitting for the rest of the time calculating that if I got four bad  marks every day of the week, that would be twenty-eight a week, or a  hundred and twelve a month; and that if four bad marks deprived me of  half a week's playground, one month's bad marks would involve an absence  of precisely fourteen weeks from that peaceful retreat; whereat I bit my  pen, and marvelled inwardly."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21059"],[0,"The Adventures of Dick Maitland: A Tale of Unknown Africa (#5)"],[1,"whether or not he  should say more; then he gazed abstractedly at his carefully kept finger  nails, and his right hand wandered to his waistcoat pocket.  Then,  looking up, he extended the hand toward Dick, saying:    \"Just lend me your penknife a moment, will you?\"    Dick produced the knife and held it out to Humphreys, who looked at it,  then shrank back.    \"Good heavens, man,\" he exclaimed, \"I asked for a penknife, not for an  adder!  Where did you get that brute from?\"    With an inarticulate cry, and an expression of unutterable disgust and  loathing, Maitland dropped the penknife to the floor, and then stamped  on it savagely, grinding the heel of his boot on it as though grinding  the head of a snake into the ground.    \"Why, Dick!\" exclaimed Humphreys, looking his assistant square in the  eye; \"what are you doing?  What has that good knife been doing to you  that you should treat it in that barbarous manner?\"    Maitland stared back blankly into the Doctor's smiling eyes for a  moment, then looked long at the penknife on the floor, and finally  stooped and cautiously took it between his forefinger and thumb, eyeing  it doubtfully the while.  Then he suddenly sat down, pulled out his  pocket handkerchief, and mopped off the perspiration that freely bedewed  his face.    \"Well, I'll be shot!\" he ejaculated.  \"What an extraordinary experience!  Will you believe me, Doctor, when I tell you that as I drew this  penknife out of my waistcoat pocket it actually seemed to change into an  adder in my hand?  There was the flat, wicked-looking head, the  malevolent eyes, the characteristic markings of the body, and, above  all, there was the feeling of it writhing strongly in my grasp, as  though it were trying to get enough of its length clear to turn and  strike me!  Talk about Aaron's rod and those of the old Egyptian  necromancers turning into serpents!  Why, I could have sworn that this  knife of mine did precisely the same thing!  Now, there is a problem for  you, Doctor: What sort of mental aberration was it that caused me to  imagine such an extraordinary thing as that, eh?\"    \"Simply, my dear boy, that I hypnotised you `unbeknownst', so to speak,  in illustration of what I have been telling you,\" answered the Doctor,  laying his hand upon Dick's shoulder.  \"Hope I didn't scare you very  severely, eh?\"    \"N-o,\" answered Dick slowly, \"you did not actually scare me, Doctor; but  you managed to give me such a thrill of horror and disgust as I have not  experienced for many a long day.  But, I say, do you really mean to tell  me, in sober earnest, that that abominable experience was due to  hypnotic suggestion on your part?\"    \"Yes, I do,\" answered Humphreys.  \"I wanted to bring home to you in a  very convincing manner the power which the hypnotist exercises over his  subject.  I could have done it even more convincingly, perhaps, by  commanding you to take that perfectly cold poker in your hand, and then  suggesting to you that it was red hot, when--despite the fact of the  poker being cold--your hand would have been most painfully blistered.  But probably the `adder' experiment was convincing enough, eh?\"    \"It was indeed,\" assented Dick with a little reminiscent shudder.  \"But  look here, Doctor, you say that you hypnotised me.  When did you do it?  I didn't see you do anything peculiar.\"    \"No, my boy, of course you didn't, because I adopted my own especial  method, which is instantaneous and undetectable, and which I will teach  you if you care to learn it; for I seem to foresee that there may be  occasions, by and by, when you get out to South Africa, when you may  find the power extremely useful to you, particularly if you should get  any medical or surgical work to do.  In such a case just hypnotise your  patient in the way that I will teach you, then powerfully suggest to him  that your treatment is going to cure him--and it will do so.  As to when  I got you under my influence, it was done while I asked you to lend me  your penknife.\"    \"By Jove!\" exclaimed Dick; \"it is marvellous, perfectly marvellous; and  if I did not know you to be an absolutely truthful man I do not think I  could bring myself to believe it.  Now I can understand what you meant  when you spoke of the potency of hypnotism for good or for evil, and  why, as I understand, you have never yet dared to pass on the secret of  your power to anyone else.  But I swear to you, Doctor, that, if you  will entrust it to me, I will never, under any circumstances whatsoever,  use it except for a good purpose, nor will I ever pass on the secret to  anyone else except with your express permission.  And now that you have  given me an idea of its capabilities I simply long to know the secret,  for it seems to me that a chap with your powers could come very near to  working miracles.\"    \"Yes,\" assented Humphreys quietly, \"that is so; indeed, even with my  imperfect knowledge--for I have not yet nearly mastered all the  possibilities of the science--I have done things that without its aid  would have been impossible.  And now, if you like, I will initiate you  into the secret of my power, which is very simple after all, and which,  once known, will enable you to do everything that I can do.  First of  all, however, I propose to throw you into a cataleptic sleep, in order  that, while you are in that condition, I may imbue you with an absolute  faith in yourself, without which everything that I can teach you would  be practically useless, at least until you had acquired faith in  yourself by the somewhat slow and laborious process which I had to  pursue.  I had to acquire faith in myself and my powers by repeated  experiments extending over a period of several months; but you have not  time for that, so I must imbue you with it by the process of suggestion  while you are in a state of trance.  Now, are you ready?\"    \"Yes, quite,\" answered Dick, with a quick indrawing of the breath; for  now that it came to the point he suddenly found that to submit himself  unreservedly to the hands of even his friend Humphreys, for the purposes  of an experiment that smacked rather strongly of the uncanny, was  something of a nerve-trying experience.  Humphreys evidently noted his  momentary hesitation, for he said:    \"You need not have the least fear; you will be profoundly unconscious  during the period of sleep, and will awake without the slightest trace  of any unpleasant feeling.  Now, stretch yourself out comfortably on  that sofa, and do exactly as I tell you.\"    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    When Dick descended to the surgery, a few minutes late, the next  morning, he found his friend Humphreys, with his coat off, his shirt  sleeves rolled up, and his clothes protected by a white apron extending  from his throat to the tops of his boots, busily engaged in dusting his  bottles and the shelves whereon they stood.    As Dick entered, the Doctor, mounted upon a step ladder, looked down at  him with a smile and nod of welcome, and said:    \"Well, my boy, how did you sleep, and how do you feel after your ordeal  of last night?\"    Dick laughed joyously.  \"My `ordeal'!\" he exclaimed.  \"I hope I may  never have to undergo a more trying ordeal than that.  I slept like a  top, thank you, and feel as fit as a fiddle this morning, indeed I don't  know that I ever felt so fit in all my life before.  But that is not  all: I have not the remotest idea what mysterious thing you did to me  last night, but this I know, that you have imparted to me a something  that I have never hitherto possessed.  I feel this morning a buoyancy of  spirit that it seems to me no amount of disappointment could damp or  lessen for a moment, and I have a belief in myself so complete, so  boundless, that I feel I cannot help but be successful in this new  venture of mine upon which I am about to embark.\"    \"Yes,\" said Humphreys, nodding his head in a manner which very clearly  expressed his satisfaction, \"that is the result of your `ordeal', and it  will be quite permanent.  Mind you, I don't say that you will always  feel quite so buoyant and confident as you do at this moment, for it is  beyond the power of any man to make another absolutely immune to  circumstances; but in spite of circumstances, however adverse, you will  always retain some at least of your present buoyancy and confidence.  I  do not think you will ever sink into that condition of utter and abject  despair which overwhelms some people and drives them to suicide.  To  change the subject.  Are you still minded to go to the docks this  morning in quest of a shipmaster benevolently enough inclined to allow  you to work your passage out to South Africa?\"    \"Rather!\" answered Dick.  \"That is to say, if you think you can spare me  for a few hours.\"    \"Of course I can spare you,\" answered Humphreys.  \"And I would advise  you to go immediately after breakfast, for, as you know, `it is the  early bird that catches the worm.'  But how do you propose to set about  your quest?  Not quite haphazard, I suppose?\"    \"No,\" answered Dick.  \"I thought of getting the _Shipping Gazette_, and  perhaps the _Telegraphy_ and consulting their advertisement pages, with  the view of learning what ships are on the berth for South African  ports, where they are lying, and their date of sailing.\"    \"An excellent idea,\" declared the Doctor.  \"As soon as Polly has put  breakfast upon the table we will send her out to get the papers, and you  can consult them and prepare a list of likely vessels before you go  out.\"    This was done; and by nine o'clock, Dick, having breakfasted, was ready  to sally forth on the first stage of his journey in quest of fortune,  duly armed with a slip of paper containing a list of some half-dozen  ships loading for South Africa, \"with quick dispatch.\"    And two hours later he returned to the surgery, his visage beaming with  satisfaction.    \"Hurrah, Doctor!\" he"]]]
