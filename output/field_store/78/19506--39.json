These remarks apply especially to Chopin's later compositions; but his  peculiarities are already distinctly traceable in many of his earlier  works; and Elsner, his teacher, was sufficiently clear-sighted and  frank to write the following words: \"The achievements of Mozart and  Beethoven as pianists have long been forgotten; and their pianoforte  compositions, although undoubtedly classical works, must give way to  the diversified artistic treatment of that instrument by the modern  school.\" Mr. Joseph Bennett quotes this sentence in his Biography of  Chopin, and adds an exclamation point in brackets after it, to  express his surprise. Mr. Bennett is considered one of the leading  London critics; yet I must say that I have never seen so much  ignorance in a single exclamation point in brackets. Note the  difference between Elsner and Bennett. Elsner adds to the sentence  just quoted, that the _other_ works of Mozart and Beethoven--their  symphonies, operas, quartets, etc., \"will not only continue to live,  but will, perhaps, remain unequalled by anything of the present day.\"  This is genuine discriminative criticism, which renders unto Caesar  what is Caesar's due: whereas, Mr. Bennett is guided by the vicious old  habit of fancying that because Mozart and Beethoven are great masters,  therefore they must be superior to everybody in everything. Is it not  about time to put an end to this absurd Jumboism in music?    The fact is, we are living in an age of division of labor and  specialism; and those who, like Robert Franz and Richard Wagner,  devote themselves to a single branch of music have a better chance of  reaching the summit of Parnassus than those who dissipate their  energies in too many directions. Chopin was the pianoforte genius _par  excellence_, and in his field he stands above the greatest of the  German composers, whatever their names. Mendelssohn once wrote to his  mother that Chopin \"produces effects on the piano as novel as those of  Paganini on the violin, and he performs marvels which no one would  have believed to be possible.\" Mendelssohn benefited to a slight  extent by Chopin's example, but he did not add anything new to the  treatment of the pianoforte. Nor does even Liszt mark an advance on  Chopin from a purely pianistic point of view. Paradoxical as it may  seem, Liszt, the greatest pianist the world has known, was really a  born _orchestral_ composer. He was never satisfied with the piano, but  constantly wanted to convert it into an orchestra. His innovations  were all in the service of these orchestral aspirations, and hence it  is that his rhapsodies, for example, are much more effective in their  orchestral garb than in their original pianoforte version. The same is  true of many of Rubinstein's pianoforte works--the Bal Masque, for  instance, which always has such an electric effect on Mr. Theodore  Thomas's audiences. Not so with Chopin. Liszt remarks, somewhere, that  Chopin might have easily written for orchestra, because his  compositions can be so readily arranged for it. I venture to differ  from this opinion. Chopin's Funeral March has been repeatedly arranged  for orchestra--first by Reber at Chopin's funeral (when Meyerbeer  regretted that he had not been asked to do this labor of love); and  more recently by Mr. Theodore Thomas. Mr. Thomas's version is very  clever and effective, yet I very _much_ prefer this sublime dirge on  the piano. In a small room the piano has almost as great a capacity  for dynamic shading as the orchestra has in a large hall; and, as I  have just pointed out, one who knows how to use the pedal can secure  an endless (almost orchestral) variety of tone-colors on the piano,  thanks to the hundreds of overtones which can be made to accompany the  tones played. Chopin spoke the language of the piano. His pieces are  so idiomatic that they cannot be translated into orchestral language  any more than Heine's lyrics can be translated into English. Chopin  exhausted the possibilities of the pianoforte, and the piano exhausts  the possibilities of Chopin's compositions.    The innovations of Chopin which I have so far alluded to, have been to  some extent adopted by all modern composers, and the more they have  adopted them the more their works ingratiate themselves in the favor  of amateurs. But there is another epoch-making feature of Chopin's  style, which is less easy, especially to Germans, because it is a  Slavic characteristic; I mean the _tempo rubato_. This is a phrase  much used among musicians, but if pressed for an exact definition, few  would be able to give one. Let us see first what Chopin's  contemporaries have to say of the way in which he himself treats it.  Chopin visited England in 1848, and on June 21 gave a concert in  London. Mr. Chorley, the well-known critic, wrote a criticism on this  occasion for \"The Athenaeum,\" in which he says: \"The delicacy of M.  Chopin's tone and the elasticity of his passages are delicious to the  ear. He makes a free use of _tempo rubato_, leaning about within his  bars more than any player we recollect, but still subject to a  presiding sentiment of measure, such as presently habituates the ear  to the liberties taken. In music not his own, we happen to know he can  be as staid as a metronome; while his Mazurkas, etc., lose half that  wildness if played without a certain freedom and license--impossible  to imitate, but irresistible if the player at all feels the music.  This we have always fancied while reading Chopin's works:--we are now  sure of it after hearing him perform them.\"    Moscheles wrote to his wife that Chopin's \"_ad libitum_ playing,  which, with the interpreters of his music degenerates into offences  against correct time, is, in his own case, merely a pleasing  originality of style.\" He compares him to \"a singer who, little  concerned with the accompaniment, follows entirely his feelings.\"  Karasovski says that Chopin \"played the bass in quiet, regular time,  while the right hand moved about with perfect freedom, now following  the left hand, now ... going its own independent way. 'The left hand,'  said Chopin, 'must be like an orchestral conductor; not for a moment  must it be uncertain and vacillating.'\" Thus his playing, free from  the fetters of _tempo_, acquired a unique charm; thanks to this  _rubato_, his melody was \"like a vessel rocked upon the waves of the  sea.\"    The world suffered a great loss when a band of ignorant soldiers found  the bundles of letters which Chopin had written from Paris to his  parents, and used them to feed the fire which cooked their supper. But  it lost a still greater treasure when Chopin tore up the manuscript of  his pianoforte method, which he began to write in the last years of  his life, but never finished. In it he would no doubt have given many  valuable hints regarding the correct use of the _rubato_. In the  absence of other authentic hints beyond the one just quoted, Liszt  must be depended upon as the best authority on the subject; for it is  well known that Liszt could imitate Chopin so nicely that his most  intimate friends were once deceived in a dark room, imagining that  Chopin was playing when Liszt was at the piano. \"Chopin,\" Liszt  writes, \"was the first who introduced into his compositions that  peculiarity which gave such a unique color to his impetuosity, and  which he called _tempo rubato_:--an irregularly interrupted movement,  subtile, broken, and languishing, at the same time flickering like a  flame in the wind, undulating, like the surface of a wheat-field, like  the tree-tops moved by a breeze.\" All his compositions must be played  in this peculiarly accented, spasmodic, insinuating style, a style  which he succeeded in imparting to his pupils, but which can hardly be  taught without example. As with the pedal, so with the _rubato_,  Chopin often neglected to mark its use in later years, taking it for  granted that those who understood his works would know where to apply  it.    Perhaps the importance of the _rubato_ in Chopin cannot be more  readily realized than by his concession that he could never play a  Viennese waltz properly, and by the fact that sometimes, when he was  in a jocular mood, he would play one of his mazurkas in strict,  metronomic time, to the great amusement of those who had heard him  play them properly.    When Liszt speaks of the _tempo rubato_ as a unique characteristic of  Chopin's style, he must not be understood too literally. As a matter  of fact, the _rubato_ is too important an element of expression not to  have been partially anticipated in the works of some of Chopin's  predecessors, just as Wagner's leading motives had imperfect  prototypes in the works of some preceding composers. As early as 1602,  the Italian, Caccini, describes what he calls the \"Stile Nobile, in  which the singer,\" he says, \"emancipates himself from the fetters of  the measure, by prolonging or diminishing the duration of a note by  one-half, according as the sense of the word requires it.\" But it is  probable that the Italian singers of that period, as to-day, used  this kind of _rubato_ merely to display the beauty of their voice on a  loud high note, and not, like Chopin, for the sake of emphasizing a  pathetic or otherwise expressive note or chord.    Of the Germans it may be said that, as a rule, they had, until  recently, no special liking for the _tempo rubato_. Dr. Hanslick, the  eminent Viennese critic, referred to it thirty years ago, as \"a morbid  unsteadiness of _tempo_.\" Mendelssohn, who always liked a \"nice, swift  _tempo_,\" repeatedly expressed his aversion to Chopin's _rubato_.  Nevertheless, traces of it may be found in the rhythms of the  classical school. Although Mozart's _tempo_ in general was as strict"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18564"],[0,"The Religion of Ancient Rome (#5)"],[1,"established on the opposite hills of the Quirinal  and Viminal, and ultimately the two communities united, enclosing  within their boundaries the Capitol and their meeting-place in the  valley which separated them--the Forum. In this way was formed the Rome  of the Four Regions, which represents the utmost extent of its  development during the period which gave rise to the genuine Roman  religion. All these stages have left their mark on the customs of  religion. _Roma quadrata_ comes to the fore in the Lupercalia: not  merely is the site of the ceremony a grotto on the Palatine  (_Lupercal_), but when the _Luperci_ run their purificatory course  around the boundaries, it is the circuit of the Palatine hill which  marks its limits. Annually on the 11th of December the festival of the  Septimontium was celebrated, not by the whole people, but by the  _montani_, presumably the inhabitants of those parts of Rome which  were included in the second settlement. Finally, the addition of the  Quirinal settlement is marked by the inclusion among the great  state-gods of Quirinus, who must have been previously the local deity  of the Quirinal community.    But more important for us than the history of the early settlement is  its character. We have spoken of early Rome as an agricultural  community: it would be more exact and more helpful to describe it as a  community of agricultural households. The institutions of Rome, legal  as well as religious, all point to the household (_familia_) as the  original unit of organisation: the individual, as such, counted for  nothing, the community was but the aggregate of families. Domestic  worship then was not merely independent of the religion of the  community: it was prior to it, and is both its historical and logical  origin. Yet the life of the early Roman agriculturalist could not be  confined to the household: in the tilling of the fields and the care of  his cattle he meets his neighbour, and common interests suggest common  prayer and thanksgiving. Thus there sprung up the great series of  agricultural festivals which form the basis of the state-calendar, but  were in origin--as some of them still continued to be--the independent  acts of worship of groups of agricultural households. Gradually, as the  community grew on the lines we have just seen, there grew with it a  sense of an organised state, as something more than the casual  aggregation of households or clans (_gentes_). As the feeling of union  became stronger, so did the necessity for common worship of the gods,  and the state-cult came into being primarily as the repetition on  behalf of the community as a whole of the worship which its members  performed separately in their households or as joint-worshippers in the  fields. But the conception of a state must carry with it at least two  ideas over and beyond the common needs of its members: there must be  internal organisation to secure domestic tranquillity, and--since there  will be collision with other states--external organisation for purposes  of offence and defence. Religion follows the new ideas, and in two of  the older deities of the fields develops the notions of justice and  war. Organisation ensues, and the general conceptions of state-deities  and state-ritual are made more definite and precise.    It will be at once natural and convenient that we should consider these  three departments of religion in the order that has just been  suggested--the worship of the household, the worship of the fields, the  worship of the state. But it must not be forgotten that both the  departments themselves and the evidence for them frequently overlap.  The domestic worship is not wholly distinguishable from that of the  fields, the state-cult is, as we have seen, very largely a replica of  the other two. The evidence for the domestic and agricultural cults is  in itself very scanty, and we shall frequently have to draw inferences  from their counterparts in the state. Above all, it is not to be  supposed that any hard and fast line between the three existed in the  Roman's mind; but for the purposes of analysis the distinction is  valuable and represents a historical reality.          CHAPTER V    WORSHIP OF THE HOUSEHOLD      =1. The Deities.=--The worship of the household seems to have  originated, as has been suggested, in the sense of the sacredness of  certain objects closely bound up with the family life--the door, the  protection against the external world, by which the household went out  to work in the morning and returned at evening, the hearth, the giver  of warmth and nourishment, and the store-cupboard, where was preserved  the food for future use. At first, in all probability, the worship was  actually of the objects themselves, but by the time that Rome can be  said to have existed at all, 'animism' had undoubtedly transformed it  into a veneration of the indwelling spirits, Ianus, Vesta, and the  Penates.    Of the domestic worship of Ianus no information has come down to us,  but we may well suppose that as the defence of the door and its main  use lay with the men of the household, so they, under the control of  the _pater familias_, were responsible for the cult of its spirit.  Vesta was, of course, worshipped at the hearth by the women, who most  often used it in the preparation of the domestic meals. In the original  round hut, such as the primitive Roman dwelt in--witness the models  which he buried with his dead and which recent excavations in the Forum  have brought to light--the 'blazing hearth' (such seems to be the  meaning of Vesta) would be the most conspicuously sacred thing; it is  therefore not surprising to find that her simple cult was the most  persistent of all throughout the history of Rome, and did not vary from  its original notion. Even Ovid can tell the inquirer 'think not Vesta  to be ought else than living flame,' and again, 'Vesta and fire require  no effigy'--notions in which he has come curiously near to the  conceptions of the earliest religion. The Penates in the same way were  at first 'the spirits'--whoever they might be--who preserved and  increased the store in the cupboard. Then as the conception of  individual deities became clearer, they were identified with some one  or other of the gods of the country or the state, among whom the  individual householder would select those who should be the particular  Penates of his family: Ceres, Iuno, Iuppiter, Pales would be some of  those chosen in the earlier period. Nor are we to suppose that  selection was merely arbitrary: the tradition of family and clan, even  possibly of locality, would determine the choice, much as the  patron-saints of a church are now determined in a Roman Catholic  country.    Two other deities are very prominent in the worship of the early  household, and each is a characteristic product of Roman religious  feeling, the Lar Familiaris and the Genius. The Lares[5] seem to have  been in origin the spirits of the family fields: they were worshipped,  as Cicero tells us, 'on the farm in sight of the house,' and they had  their annual festival in the Compitalia, celebrated at the  _compita_--places where two or more properties marched. But one of  these spirits, the _Lar Familiaris_, had special charge of the house  and household, and as such was worshipped with the other domestic gods  at the hearth. As his protection extended over all the household,  including the slaves, his cult is placed specially in the charge of the  bailiff's wife (_vilica_). He is regularly worshipped at the great  divisions of the month on Calends, Nones, and Ides, but he has also an  intimate and beautiful connection with the domestic history of the  family. An offering is made to the Lar on the occasion of a birth, a  wedding, a departure, or a return, and even--a characteristically Roman  addition--on the occasion of the first utterance of a word by a son of  the house: finally, a particularly solemn sacrifice is made to him  after a death in the family.    The Genius is perhaps the most difficult conception in the Roman  religion for the modern mind to grasp. It has been spoken of as the  'patron-saint' or 'guardian-angel,' both of them conceptions akin to  that of the Genius, but both far too definite and anthropomorphic: we  shall understand it best by keeping the '_numen_' notion clearly in  mind and looking to the root-meaning of the word (_genius_ connected  with the root of _gignere_, to beget). It was after all only a natural  development of the notions of 'animism' to imagine that man too, like  other objects, had his indwelling spirit--not his 'soul' either in our  sense of moral and intellectual powers, or in the ancient sense of the  vital principle--but rather as the derivation suggests, in origin  simply the spirit which gave him the power of generation. Hence in the  house, the sphere of the Genius is no longer the hearth but the  marriage-bed (_lectus genialis_). This notion growing somewhat wider,  the Genius comes to denote all the full powers, almost the personality,  of developed manhood, and especially those powers which make for  pleasure and happiness: this is the origin of such common phrases as  _genium curare_, _genio indulgere_, meaning practically to 'look after  oneself,' 'to indulge oneself.' Every man, then, has this 'spirit of  his manhood' in his Genius, and correspondingly every woman her Iuno,  or spirit of womanhood, which are worshipped on the birthdays of their  owners. No doubt later the Genius was accredited with powers over the  fortune and misfortune of his possessor, but he never really developed  anything like the independence of a god, and remained always rather a  _numen_. The individual revered his own Genius, but the household cult  was concerned, as one would expect, with the Genius of the master of  the house, the pre-eminent Genius of the family. Its special locality  was, for the reason just noticed, the"]]]
