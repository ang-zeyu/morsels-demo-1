Architecture depends on Order (in Greek [Greek: taxis]), Arrangement  (in Greek [Greek: diathesis]), Eurythmy, Symmetry, Propriety, and  Economy (in Greek [Greek: oikonomia]).    2. Order gives due measure to the members of a work considered  separately, and symmetrical agreement to the proportions of the whole.  It is an adjustment according to quantity (in Greek [Greek: posotes]).  By this I mean the selection of modules from the members of the work  itself and, starting from these individual parts of members,  constructing the whole work to correspond. Arrangement includes the  putting of things in their proper places and the elegance of effect  which is due to adjustments appropriate to the character of the work.  Its forms of expression (Greek [Greek: ideai]) are these: groundplan,  elevation, and perspective. A groundplan is made by the proper  successive use of compasses and rule, through which we get outlines for  the plane surfaces of buildings. An elevation is a picture of the front  of a building, set upright and properly drawn in the proportions of the  contemplated work. Perspective is the method of sketching a front with  the sides withdrawing into the background, the lines all meeting in the  centre of a circle. All three come of reflexion and invention. Reflexion  is careful and laborious thought, and watchful attention directed to the  agreeable effect of one's plan. Invention, on the other hand, is the  solving of intricate problems and the discovery of new principles by  means of brilliancy and versatility. These are the departments belonging  under Arrangement.    3. Eurythmy is beauty and fitness in the adjustments of the members.  This is found when the members of a work are of a height suited to their  breadth, of a breadth suited to their length, and, in a word, when they  all correspond symmetrically.    4. Symmetry is a proper agreement between the members of the work  itself, and relation between the different parts and the whole general  scheme, in accordance with a certain part selected as standard. Thus in  the human body there is a kind of symmetrical harmony between forearm,  foot, palm, finger, and other small parts; and so it is with perfect  buildings. In the case of temples, symmetry may be calculated from the  thickness of a column, from a triglyph, or even from a module; in the  ballista, from the hole or from what the Greeks call the [Greek:  peritretos]; in a ship, from the space between the tholepins [Greek:  (diapegma)]; and in other things, from various members.    5. Propriety is that perfection of style which comes when a work is  authoritatively constructed on approved principles. It arises from  prescription [Greek: (thematismo)], from usage, or from nature. From  prescription, in the case of hypaethral edifices, open to the sky, in  honour of Jupiter Lightning, the Heaven, the Sun, or the Moon: for these  are gods whose semblances and manifestations we behold before our very  eyes in the sky when it is cloudless and bright. The temples of  Minerva, Mars, and Hercules, will be Doric, since the virile strength of  these gods makes daintiness entirely inappropriate to their houses. In  temples to Venus, Flora, Proserpine, Spring-Water, and the Nymphs, the  Corinthian order will be found to have peculiar significance, because  these are delicate divinities and so its rather slender outlines, its  flowers, leaves, and ornamental volutes will lend propriety where it is  due. The construction of temples of the Ionic order to Juno, Diana,  Father Bacchus, and the other gods of that kind, will be in keeping with  the middle position which they hold; for the building of such will be an  appropriate combination of the severity of the Doric and the delicacy of  the Corinthian.    6. Propriety arises from usage when buildings having magnificent  interiors are provided with elegant entrance-courts to correspond; for  there will be no propriety in the spectacle of an elegant interior  approached by a low, mean entrance. Or, if dentils be carved in the  cornice of the Doric entablature or triglyphs represented in the Ionic  entablature over the cushion-shaped capitals of the columns, the effect  will be spoilt by the transfer of the peculiarities of the one order of  building to the other, the usage in each class having been fixed long  ago.    7. Finally, propriety will be due to natural causes if, for example, in  the case of all sacred precincts we select very healthy neighbourhoods  with suitable springs of water in the places where the fanes are to be  built, particularly in the case of those to Aesculapius and to Health,  gods by whose healing powers great numbers of the sick are apparently  cured. For when their diseased bodies are transferred from an unhealthy  to a healthy spot, and treated with waters from health-giving springs,  they will the more speedily grow well. The result will be that the  divinity will stand in higher esteem and find his dignity increased, all  owing to the nature of his site. There will also be natural propriety in  using an eastern light for bedrooms and libraries, a western light in  winter for baths and winter apartments, and a northern light for picture  galleries and other places in which a steady light is needed; for that  quarter of the sky grows neither light nor dark with the course of the  sun, but remains steady and unshifting all day long.    8. Economy denotes the proper management of materials and of site, as  well as a thrifty balancing of cost and common sense in the construction  of works. This will be observed if, in the first place, the architect  does not demand things which cannot be found or made ready without great  expense. For example: it is not everywhere that there is plenty of  pitsand, rubble, fir, clear fir, and marble, since they are produced in  different places and to assemble them is difficult and costly. Where  there is no pitsand, we must use the kinds washed up by rivers or by the  sea; the lack of fir and clear fir may be evaded by using cypress,  poplar, elm, or pine; and other problems we must solve in similar ways.    9. A second stage in Economy is reached when we have to plan the  different kinds of dwellings suitable for ordinary householders, for  great wealth, or for the high position of the statesman. A house in town  obviously calls for one form of construction; that into which stream the  products of country estates requires another; this will not be the same  in the case of money-lenders and still different for the opulent and  luxurious; for the powers under whose deliberations the commonwealth is  guided dwellings are to be provided according to their special needs:  and, in a word, the proper form of economy must be observed in building  houses for each and every class.          CHAPTER III    THE DEPARTMENTS OF ARCHITECTURE      1. There are three departments of architecture: the art of building, the  making of timepieces, and the construction of machinery. Building is, in  its turn, divided into two parts, of which the first is the construction  of fortified towns and of works for general use in public places, and  the second is the putting up of structures for private individuals.  There are three classes of public buildings: the first for defensive,  the second for religious, and the third for utilitarian purposes. Under  defence comes the planning of walls, towers, and gates, permanent  devices for resistance against hostile attacks; under religion, the  erection of fanes and temples to the immortal gods; under utility, the  provision of meeting places for public use, such as harbours, markets,  colonnades, baths, theatres, promenades, and all other similar  arrangements in public places.    2. All these must be built with due reference to durability,  convenience, and beauty. Durability will be assured when foundations are  carried down to the solid ground and materials wisely and liberally  selected; convenience, when the arrangement of the apartments is  faultless and presents no hindrance to use, and when each class of  building is assigned to its suitable and appropriate exposure; and  beauty, when the appearance of the work is pleasing and in good taste,  and when its members are in due proportion according to correct  principles of symmetry.          CHAPTER IV    THE SITE OF A CITY      1. For fortified towns the following general principles are to be  observed. First comes the choice of a very healthy site. Such a site  will be high, neither misty nor frosty, and in a climate neither hot nor  cold, but temperate; further, without marshes in the neighbourhood. For  when the morning breezes blow toward the town at sunrise, if they bring  with them mists from marshes and, mingled with the mist, the poisonous  breath of the creatures of the marshes to be wafted into the bodies of  the inhabitants, they will make the site unhealthy. Again, if the town  is on the coast with a southern or western exposure, it will not be  healthy, because in summer the southern sky grows hot at sunrise and is  fiery at noon, while a western exposure grows warm after sunrise, is hot  at noon, and at evening all aglow.    2. These variations in heat and the subsequent cooling off are harmful  to the people living on such sites. The same conclusion may be reached  in the case of inanimate things. For instance, nobody draws the light  for covered wine rooms from the south or west, but rather from the  north, since that quarter is never subject to change but is always  constant and unshifting. So it is with granaries: grain exposed to the  sun's course soon loses its good quality, and provisions and fruit,  unless stored in a place unexposed to the sun's course, do not keep  long.    3. For heat is a universal solvent, melting out of things their power of  resistance, and sucking away and removing their natural strength"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20248"],[0,"The Necessity of Atheism (#5)"],[1," still maintained by the synagogue. His  Martian intellect is unable to comprehend the logic of a God who would  demand human and animal sacrifice, and the story of Abraham about to  sacrifice his son Isaac fills him with disgust. His estimate of the  mentality of Jehovah receives a severe jolt when he reads in Leviticus  XVI, \"Herewith shall Aaron come unto the holy place with a young bullock  for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering. He shall put on the  holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen breeches upon his flesh,  and he shall be girded with the linen girdle, and with the linen mitre  shall he be attired; they are the holy garments; and he shall bathe his  flesh in water and put them on. And he shall take of the congregation of  the children of Israel two he-goats for a sin offering, and one ram for  a burnt offering. And Aaron shall present the bullock of the sin  offering, which is for himself, and he shall make atonement for himself  and for his houses. And he shall take the two goats and set them before  the Lord at the door of the tent of the meeting.\"    Our visitor reads on to Leviticus XVIII, after which he must stop to  question the Hebrew, for here he finds, \"None of you shall approach to  any that is near of kin to him, to uncover their nakedness; I am the  Lord. The nakedness of thy father, even the nakedness of thy mother,  shalt thou not uncover; she is thy mother; thou shalt not uncover her  nakedness. The nakedness of thy father's wife shalt thou not uncover; it  is thy father's nakedness. The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of  thy father, or daughter of thy mother, whether she be born at home, or  abroad, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover. The nakedness of  thy son's wife--the nakedness of the wife of thy father--the nakedness  of thy father's sister, thy mother's sister, the nakedness of thy  daughter-in-law, thy brother's wife, the nakedness of a woman and her  daughter, thou shalt not uncover. And unto a woman separated by her  uncleanliness thou shalt not approach to uncover her nakedness. Thou  shalt not be carnally with thy neighbor's wife, to defile thyself with  her. Thou shalt not be with mankind as with womankind. And thou shalt  not be with any beast to defile thyself thereto; neither shall any woman  stand before a beast to lie down thereto; it is confusion.\"    The Martian, totally aghast, is constrained to exclaim that he cannot  believe that a Deity should find it necessary to place this in a divine  revelation. The Hebrew Zealot relents somewhat to explain that perhaps  this was not revealed, but found its way into the divine text as a  moral lesson to the primitive tribes for which it was written. To this,  our guest counters with the remark that if this be a parable of manners  and morals, then, from what he observes on the earth, we, Earthlings,  have certainly outgrown the need for such coarse and obscene statements  made some 2000 years ago; and that on Mars, although the inhabitants are  not blessed with such divine revelations, common sense and reason have  taught their most primitive men the same lessons in morality while they  were yet in their infancy.    Reflecting on this maze of contradictions, the Martian determines to  analyze the Old Testament and the Hebrew religion in the same manner  that he would investigate any other problem presented to him.    Thirty-five hundred years ago, the Hebrews were a pastoral, primitive  people inhabiting the wilderness known today as the Arabian Desert.  Their religion was that of all other primitive peoples--Animism, an  illusion which made primitive man recognize everywhere spirits similar  to his own spirit. They worshiped the spirits of the sun and the moon,  the mountains and rocks, as well as the spirits of the dead.    It appears certain that the barrenness of this desert land necessitated  these wandering tribes to migrate to adjacent areas of greater  fertility. To the north lay the fertile valleys of the Tigris and  Euphrates and the coast of the Mediterranean Sea; to the west lay the  land of the Egyptians. Time and time again, these Bedouin tribes hurled  themselves against the inhabitants of the northern fertile valleys.  Babylonia, to the northeast, was the first country to be invaded, and  later Canaan to the northwest. Successful at times in establishing  themselves in Babylonia and Canaan, they were at other times driven back  into the desert when the native inhabitants in turn attacked the  invaders. Migrating into Egypt in search of food, they were made a  captive nation and escaped again into the desert when the Egyptians were  engaged in fighting the savage invaders from Libya.    The leader of this flight from Egypt was the prophet Moses. The Martian  decides to investigate the character and deeds of this influential  figure at another time. It is probable that the exodus gave the proper  stimulus for the beginnings of a distinctive Hebrew religion, and was  the reason for their finally establishing themselves in Canaan, with  Jehovah as their chief deity. It has often been proclaimed that the  value of Judaism has been in first establishing a religion of  monotheism; but it must not be forgotten that centuries before the  Hebrews escaped into the desert, the Egyptians were tending to  monotheism. It is known that one god was exalted over all the rest in  Egypt, and that as far back as 1375 B.C. King Ikhnaton made the religion  of Egypt an absolute monotheism. The Hebrews, in proclaiming their  Yahveh as the one and supreme deity, were but following what they had  assimilated from the Egyptians. The faith of these desert marauders, at  the time of their entrance into Canaan, was as crude and savage as the  Hebrews themselves. Brought into contact with the gods of the  Phoenicians and Babylonians, their Yahveh underwent a change, as have  all other creeds since that time when brought into contact with another  creed. The final idea of Yahveh accepted by the Hebrews was not the  product of a sudden revelation but of a gradual evolution.    The Hebrews, about the twelfth century B.C., gained access into Canaan,  and at first were successful in warfare, so that under King David they  presented the aspect of a united nation. However, following the  extravagant reign of King Solomon, the nation was embroiled in a  revolution, and the land was divided into two kingdoms--Israel in the  north, Judah in the south. These two tiny kingdoms were habitually at  war with each other and, finally, in 722 B.C. Israel was conquered,  while in 586 B.C., Judah was defeated and its population either  scattered or taken into captivity.    In 538 B.C., Cyrus of Persia conquered Babylonia and set the exiles  free. Returning to their own land, the exiles took back with them the  law code which the priests had manufactured for them. Then began a  period of priestly domination and corruption, a period of subjugation to  Rome, of insurrection against Rome, and the capture and destruction of  Jerusalem in 70 A.D. With the capture of Jerusalem, the Hebrew nation  was finally dispersed.    Just as the Martian was able to trace the evolution of the Hebrews from  the stage of the marauding tribes of the Arabian desert who wandered  into Egypt, Canaan, and Babylonia, and finally established a kingdom for  themselves which was dispersed by Rome; just so could he trace the  evolution of their religious beliefs from their incipient crudities to  their not too great refinement at 70 A.D. This evolution of the Hebrew  religion is best exemplified by an analysis of the Old Testament itself.    There are several canons, or official collection of books which comprise  the Old Testament. The Jews and Protestants accept fewer books than the  Roman Catholics. The Jewish Canon consists of those so-called sacred  books of which the Synagogue possessed Hebrew texts about a century  before the Christian era. \"About 150 B.C. the sacred books of the Jews  were translated into Greek for the use of those Egyptian Jews who could  not read Hebrew. This translation is called the Septuagint, from a  tradition that seventy or seventy-two translators had worked upon it.\"  (_Salomon Reinach, \"Orpheus._\") The earliest manuscripts of the Hebrew  Bible date only from the tenth century A.D., but there are very much  older manuscripts of the Greek and Latin translations in existence. At  the time of Jesus Christ, three divisions of the Old Testament were  recognized. These were, the Law, the Prophets, and the other Scriptures.  The first five books, Genesis, Exodus, Numbers, Leviticus, and  Deuteronomy, are known as the Pentateuch, and are attributed to Moses  himself; although, as has been noted, they contain the account of his  death. This conception of the Mosaic origin of the Pentateuch was  accepted by the Israelites as early as the fifth century B.C. and has  been maintained by the Synagogue since that time. Following the example  of the Hebrews, the Christian Churches accepted this version as to  origin, and the Roman Catholic Church still upholds this view. The  Jewish Synagogue and the various Christian Churches further hold that  the Old Testament is a collection of works inspired or dictated by God.  Even as late as 1861, the famous Dean Burgon, in a sermon preached at  Oxford University, declared, \"The Bible is none other than the voice of  Him that sitteth upon the throne. Every book of it, every chapter of it,  every verse of it, every syllable of it, every letter of it, is the  direct utterance of the Most High. The Bible is none other than the Word  of God, not some part of it more, some part of it less, but all alike  the utterance of Him who sitteth upon the throne, faultless, unerring,  supreme.\" The Martian compared this statement with the words of the  scholar Loisy, \"If God himself wrote the Bible, we must believe Him to  be either ignorant or untruthful.\"    As he delves further into the intricacies of the"]]]
