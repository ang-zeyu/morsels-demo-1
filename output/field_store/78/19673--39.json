First in worth        Among the twice-born was this poet, known      As Shudraka far over all the earth,        His virtue's depth unfathomed and alone.                   3    [1.14. S.    And again:        The Samaveda, the Rigveda too,      The science mathematical, he knew;      The arts wherein fair courtezans excel,      And all the lore of elephants as well.      Through Shiva's grace, his eye was never dim;      He saw his son a king in place of him.      The difficult horse-sacrifice he tried      Successfully; entered the fiery tide,      One hundred years and ten days old, and died.                4    And yet again:        Eager for battle; sloth's determined foe;        Of scholars chief, who to the Veda cling;      Rich in the riches that ascetics know;      Glad, gainst the foeman's elephant to show        His valor;--such was Shudraka, the king.                   5    And in this work of his,        Within the town, Avanti named,      Dwells one called Charudatta, famed      No less for youth than poverty;      A merchant's son and Brahman, he.        His virtues have the power to move      Vasantasena's inmost love;      Fair as the springtime's radiancy,      And yet a courtezan is she.                                  6        So here king Shudraka the tale imparts      Of love's pure festival in these two hearts,      Of prudent acts, a lawsuit's wrong and hate,      A rascal's nature, and the course of fate.                   7    [_He walks about and looks around him._] Why, this music-room of  ours is empty. I wonder where the actors have gone. [_Reflecting._]  Ah, I understand.    P. 4.7]        Empty his house, to whom no child was born;        Thrice empty his, who lacks true friends and sure;      To fools, the world is empty and forlorn;        But all that is, is empty to the poor.                     8    I have finished the concert. And I've been practising so long that  the pupils of my eyes are dancing, and I'm so hungry that my eyes  are crackling like a lotus-seed, dried up by the fiercest rays of the  summer sun. I'll just call my wife and ask whether there is anything  for breakfast or not.    Hello! here I am--but no! Both the particular occasion and the  general custom demand that I speak Prakrit. [_Speaking in Prakrit._]  Confound it! I've been practising so long and I'm so hungry that  my limbs are as weak as dried-up lotus-stalks. Suppose I go home  and see whether my good wife has got anything ready or not. [_He  walks about and looks around him._] Here I am at home. I'll just go  in. [_He enters and looks about._] Merciful heavens! Why in the world  is everything in our house turned upside down? A long stream of  rice-water is flowing down the street. The ground, spotted black  where the iron kettle has been rubbed clean, is as lovely as a girl  with the beauty-marks of black cosmetic on her face. It smells so  good that my hunger seems to blaze up and hurts me more than  ever. Has some hidden treasure come to light? or am I hungry  enough to think the whole world is made of rice? There surely isn't  any breakfast in our house, and I'm starved to death. But everything  seems topsyturvy here. One girl is preparing cosmetics, another  is weaving garlands of flowers. [_Reflecting._] What does it all  mean? Well, I'll call my good wife and learn the truth. [_He looks  toward the dressing-room._] Mistress, will you come here a moment?    [_Enter an actress._]    _Actress._ Here I am, sir.    _Director._ You are very welcome, mistress.    _Actress._ Command me, sir. What am I to do?    [3.8. S.    _Director._ Mistress, I've been practising so long and I'm so hungry  that my limbs are as weak as dried-up lotus-stalks. Is there anything  to eat in the house or not?    _Actress._ There's everything, sir.    _Director._ Well, what?    _Actress._ For instance--there's rice with sugar, melted butter, curdled  milk, rice; and, all together, it makes you a dish fit for  heaven. May the gods always be thus gracious to you!    _Director._ All that in our house? or are you joking?    _Actress._ [_Aside._] Yes, I will have my joke. [_Aloud._] It's in the  market-place, sir.    _Director._ [_Angrily._] You wretched woman, thus shall your own  hope be cut off! And death shall find you out! For my expectations,  like a scaffolding, have been raised so high, only to fall again.    _Actress._ Forgive me, sir, forgive me! It was only a joke.    _Director._ But what do these unusual preparations mean? One girl  is preparing cosmetics, another is weaving garlands, and the very  ground is adorned with sacrificial flowers of five different colors.    _Actress._ This is a fast day, sir.    _Director._ What fast?    _Actress._ The fast for a handsome husband.    _Director._ In this world, mistress, or the next?    _Actress._ In the next world, sir.    _Director._ [_Wrathfully._] Gentlemen! look at this. She is sacrificing  my food to get herself a husband in the next world.    _Actress._ Don't be angry, sir. I am fasting in the hope that you  may be my husband in my next birth, too.    _Director._ But who suggested this fast to you?    _Actress._ Your own dear friend Jurnavriddha.    _Director._ [_Angrily._] Ah, Jurnavriddha, son of a slave-wench!  When, oh, when shall I see King Palaka angry with you? Then  you will be parted, as surely as the scented hair of some young  bride.    P. 8.10]    _Actress._ Don't be angry, sir. It is only that I may have you in the  next world that I celebrate this fast. [_She falls at his feet._]    _Director._ Stand up, mistress, and tell me who is to officiate at this  fast.    _Actress._ Some Brahman of our own sort whom we must invite.    _Director._ You may go then. And I will invite some Brahman of  our own sort.    _Actress._ Very well, sir.                              [_Exit._    _Director._ [_Walking about._] Good heavens! In this rich city of  Ujjayini how am I to find a Brahman of our own sort? [_He looks  about him._] Ah, here comes Charudatta's friend Maitreya. Good!  I'll ask him. Maitreya, you must be the first to break bread in  our house to-day.    _A voice behind the scenes._ You must invite some other Brahman.  I am busy.    _Director._ But, man, the feast is set and you have it all to yourself.  Besides, you shall have a present.    _The voice._ I said no once. Why should you keep on urging me?    _Director._ He says no. Well, I must invite some other Brahman.                                                             [_Exit._    END OF THE PROLOGUE          ACT THE FIRST    THE GEMS ARE LEFT BEHIND      [_Enter, with a cloak in his hand, Maitreya._]    _Maitreya._    \"You must invite some other Brahman. I am busy.\" And yet I really ought  to be seeking invitations from a stranger. Oh, what a wretched state of  affairs! When good Charudatta was still wealthy, I used to eat my fill  of the most deliciously fragrant sweetmeats, prepared day and night with  the greatest of care. I would sit at the door of the courtyard, where I  was surrounded by hundreds of dishes, and there, like a painter with his  paint-boxes, I would simply touch them with my fingers and thrust them  aside. I would stand chewing my cud like a bull in the city market. And  now he is so poor that I have to run here, there, and everywhere, and  come home, like the pigeons, only to roost. Now here is this  jasmine-scented cloak, which Charudatta's good friend Jurnavriddha has  sent him. He bade me give it to Charudatta, as soon as he had finished  his devotions. So now I will look for Charudatta. [_He walks about and  looks around him._] Charudatta has finished his devotions, and here he  comes with an offering for the divinities of the house.    [_Enter Charudatta as described, and Radanika._]    _Charudatta._ [_Looking up and sighing wearily._]        Upon my threshold, where the offering        Was straightway seized by swans and flocking cranes,      The grass grows now, and these poor seeds I fling        Fall where the mouth of worms their sweetness stains.      9    [_He walks about very slowly and seats himself._]    _Maitreya_. Charudatta is here. I must go and speak to him.  [_Approaching._] My greetings to you. May happiness be yours.    P. 13.1]    _Charudatta._ Ah, it is my constant friend Maitreya. You are very  welcome, my friend. Pray be seated.    _Maitreya._ Thank you. [_He seats himself._] Well, comrade, here is a  jasmine-scented cloak which your good friend Jurnavriddha has  sent. He bade me give it you as soon as you had finished your devotions.  [_He presents the cloak. Charudatta takes it and remains  sunk in thought._] Well, what are you thinking about?    _Charudatta._ My good friend,        A candle shining through the deepest dark        Is happiness that follows sorrow's strife;      But after bliss when man bears sorrow's mark,        His body lives a very death-in-life.                       10    _Maitreya._ Well, which would you rather, be dead or be poor?    _Charudatta._ Ah, my friend,        Far better death than sorrows sure and slow;      Some passing suffering from death may flow,      But poverty brings never-ending woe.                         11    _Maitreya._ My dear friend, be not thus cast down. Your wealth has  been conveyed to them you love, and like the moon, after she has  yielded her nectar to the gods, your waning fortunes win an added  charm.    _Charudatta._ Comrade, I do not grieve for my ruined fortunes. But        This is my sorrow. They whom I      Would greet as guests, now pass me by.      \"This is a poor man's house,\" they cry.
