The witch was just considering what to do next, when her lion-headed  servitors informed her that one of the company had resisted her  enchantment, and was wandering about the garden. So the witch put on her  cloak of invisibility, and going down to the garden, found poor Florian  wandering disconsolately under the trees. She saw at once that it was  the little golden bird which had protected him from her magic; and being  afraid of the charm and yet unable to work the poor lad any harm while  the bird was in his possession, she decided to rid herself of Florian by  transporting her castle, gardens and all, over to the other side of the  world. So she uttered a spell, and everything disappeared.    When Florian woke the next morning, and found that the castle was gone,  his heart sank. Nevertheless, he did not despair, but taking from his  pocket the little scarlet ball which his master the Enchanter had given  him, he put it on the ground, and bade it guide him back to the  Enchanted Garden.    The little ball immediately began rolling ahead at Florian's own pace;  at night it glowed with a scarlet fire. Day after day, month after  month, the scarlet ball rolled on; it led Florian over hill and down  dale, through the land of the men who have only one eye, through the  country of the dwarfs, and the valley of the talking trees, never  stopping till it reached the gate of the witch's garden.    A year, meanwhile, had gone by, and during that year the witch had done  everything she could to induce Prince Florizel to accept her ugly  daughter. First she had tried frightening him, then she had tried to win  him by giving splendid fetes, then she had tried terrifying him again;  but as the Prince was neither to be terrified nor cajoled, she came to  her wits' end.  Finally she told the Prince that, if he were not willing  to accept her daughter in marriage on the very next day, she would turn  him into a hare and set her dogs upon him. The Prince made no answer to  her terrible threat, and the witch went ahead and made preparation for  the grandest of weddings. On that night, Florian arrived at the garden.    When it was very late, and the moon, which was a quarter full, had  disappeared behind a bank of clouds, Florian crept unobserved to the  door of Florizel's prison; for the witch had locked him up so securely  that she had not taken the trouble to find a watchman. Alas! the poor  Prince lay at the top of a high tower, and twenty different doors, each  one opened by a different key, stood between him and the ground.    But Florian was not to be daunted, and drawing from his bosom the key  which the Enchanter had given him, he opened one door after the other  till he arrived in the cell occupied by the Prince.    The poor Prince lay chained on a bed of straw, trying to read a book by  the light of a single candle. He was very unhappy, for he had resolved  to let himself be torn in pieces rather than marry the ugly witch  maiden. You may be sure he was glad to see Florian.    \"Dear Florian,\" said the unhappy Prince, \"if I had only obeyed your  counsel, all would have been well.\" And he begged Florian to tell him  where he had been all the long year.    So Florian told the Prince of his adventures.    Now, the chains which the Prince wore were riveted cruelly upon him, and  since there was no lock to them, the magic key was of no avail. At  length, however, Florizel managed to work them off; but in doing so, he  injured his foot, and found to his dismay that he could only limp along.    Little by little the freshened air and the stir of leaves began to  foretell the coming of the dawn. Finally, just as the dawn-star began to  pale, Florizel and Florian hurried out of the prison through the twenty  doors, and fled to the highroad.    But they had traveled only a few miles, when the wicked witch discovered  Florizel's flight, and, dreadfully enraged, commanded that her dragon  car be got ready in order that she might go in pursuit of him. So the  car was brought forth, and into it the witch leaped, and mounted into  the sky. Hearing the hissing and roaring of the dragons in the air,  Florian and Florizel tried to hide under some trees; but the witch  instantly saw them, and pronounced a spell to turn them into hares. But  though the hate of the witch was quick, the woman's heart of Isabella  was quicker, and sacrificing herself for the man she loved, she threw  the chain and the golden bird over the Prince's head. An instant later  she had turned into a little gray hare crouching at Florizel's feet. At  the same moment, the cruel witch, who had arrived at her castle, let  loose her pack of fierce hunting dogs, who soon took up the trail of the  hare and came bounding toward her in full cry.    The poor Prince picked up the hare and hobbled forward as fast as he  could go, forgetting the dreadful pain it caused him; but the dogs were  running a hundred times faster than he. Nearer and nearer came the pack,  their red tongues lolling from their black throats. By good fortune,  just as the leader of the pack was not more than fifty feet away,  Isabella had wit enough to remember the promise which the Enchanter had  made her, and called upon him. Immediately a strong glass wall, as high  as a castle tower, shot up from the ground behind Isabella and the  Prince; and the pack, hurrying forward, found themselves baulked of  their prey. Snarling and yelling, they threw themselves against the  magic wall; but in vain.    In another instant, the Enchanter himself stood before them, and  touching the hare with his wand, restored Isabella to her human form.  She still wore the garments of Florian, however, and the Prince still  thought her a boy.    Suddenly a shadow fell on the ground near them, and looking up, all  beheld the wicked witch and her ugly daughter, who had ridden out in the  dragon car to enjoy Florizel's cruel death. The Enchanter immediately  caused the dragon car to vanish, and the witch and her daughter fell  tumbling through the air into a pond, and were changed into ugly little  fishes. Then the Enchanter carried Florizel and Florian back to the  witch's castle, where they found the tables spread and the dinner being  prepared which was to celebrate the wedding of Florizel and the witch's  daughter. Last of all, he released Florizel's company from the witch's  spell.    Now, one of the ladies, when she heard how the witch had tried to match  Florizel with her daughter, and saw the preparations for the wedding,  told the Prince that it was a pity that the Princess Rosamond were not  at hand, so that there might be a wedding after all.    \"A wedding? No,\" said Florizel, \"not till I have found a wife who shall  have proved herself as faithful and true as little Florian.\"    \"She is already here,\" said the Enchanter. And he touched Florian with  his wand.    Immediately there was a flash of flame, and out of it, Florian no  longer, but her own self, appeared Isabella. Her hair had grown long  again, and the Enchanter had clad her in the most magnificent of gowns.  Never was there a lovelier girl to be seen on earth. You may be sure  that the Prince stepped forward, took her by the hand, and claimed her  for his bride.    Soon the parents of Florizel, who had been summoned by the Enchanter,  arrived, and there was a wedding after all. When the merrymaking was  over, the Enchanter went back to his castle on the Black Rock, while  Florizel and Isabella returned to their own country, and lived there  happily to a good old age.             THE SELLER OF DREAMS    Once upon a time a mother called her only son into the kitchen, gave him  a basket of fine, fresh eggs, and bade him carry them to his Aunt Jane,  who lived a few miles down the valley. The son, a lively lad about  twelve years of age, obeyed his mother with joy, and clapping his little  green hat on his head, stepped forth into the road. It was a beautiful  clear morning in the spring, and the earth, released from the icy chains  of winter, was rejoicing in her freedom and the return of the sun. A few  birds, just back from the southland, rocked on twigs swollen with  bursting buds, a thousand rills flowing from everywhere and in every  direction sparkled and sang, and the air was sweet with the odor of  ploughed fields.    The boy, whose name was Peter, walked along whistling. Suddenly he saw a  spot on the road shining as dazzlingly as if a bit of the sun itself had  fallen to the earth. \"A bit of glass,\" thought Peter. But it was not a  bit of glass after all, but a fine golden florin which must have dropped  from somebody's purse.    Peter stooped, picked up the gold piece, put it in his pocket, and  walked off whistling louder than ever. In a little while he came to a  place where the road wound down a little hill, and Peter saw, trudging  up this hill, a very strange looking old man. He was a very old man; his  face was puckered up into a thousand wrinkles like the skin of a  shrunken apple, and he had long, snow-white hair and a white beard which  reached almost to his waist. Moreover, he was strangely dressed in a  robe of cherry scarlet, and wore golden shoes. From a kind of belt hung  two horns on silver chains, one an ordinary cow's horn, the other a  beautiful horn carved of the whitest ivory, and decorated with little  figures of men and animals.    \"Dreams to sell! Dreams to sell!\" called out the old man as soon as he  caught sight of Peter. \"Don't you want to buy a dream, young man?\"    \"What kind of dreams have you?\" asked Peter.    \"Good, bad, true, false--all kinds,\" replied the seller of dreams. \"I  have even a few thrilling nightmares. Dreams to sell! Dreams to sell!\"    \"How much does a dream cost?\" asked Peter.    \"A golden florin,\" answered the merchant.    \"I'll have one, please,\" said Peter; and he handed over the florin he  had found.    The old man took a kind of wonderful sugarplum out of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19209"],[0,"The Andes and the Amazon; Or, Across the Continent of South America (#5)"],[1,"basking in the hot sun, or asleep with their mouths wide open.    [Footnote 10: The mango of Asia is superior in size and flavor to that  of America. It is eaten largely in Brazil by negroes and cattle. The  cocoa-palm is also of Asiatic origin, and is most abundant in Ceylon. It  has a swollen stem when young, but becomes straight and tall when  mature. The flowers burst into a long plume of soft, cream-colored  blossoms. It is worthy of remembrance that the most beautiful forms of  vegetation in the tropics are at the same time most useful to man.]    Eight hours after leaving the Malecon we arrived at Bodegas, a little  village of two thousand souls, rejoicing in the synonym of Babahoyo.  This has been a place of deposit for the interior from the earliest  times. In the rainy season the whole site is flooded, and only the upper  stories are habitable. Cock-fighting seems to be the chief amusement. We  breakfasted with the governor, a portly gentleman who kept a little  dry-goods store. His excellency, without waiting for a formal  introduction, and with a cordiality and courtesy almost confined to the  Latin nations, received us into his own house, and honored us with a  seat at his private table, spread with the choicest viands of his  kingdom, serving them himself with a grace to which we can not do  justice. Much as we find to condemn in tropical society, we can not  forget the kindness of these simple-hearted people. Though we may  portray, in the coming pages, many faults and failings according to a  New York standard, we wish it to be understood that there is another  side to the picture; that there are virtues on the Andes to which the  North is well-nigh a stranger. \"How many times (says an American  resident of ten years) I have arrived at a miserable hut in the heart  of the mountains, tired and hungry, after traveling all day without any  other companion than the arriero, to receive a warm-hearted welcome, the  best, perhaps the only chair or hammock offered to me, the fattest  chicken in the yard killed on my account, and more than once they have  compelled me by force to take the only good bed, because I must be  tired, and should have a good night's rest. A man may travel from one  end of the Andes to the other, depending altogether on the good people  he meets.\"    At Bodegas travelers take to mules or horses for the mountains, hiring  one set for Guaranda and another at that village for Quito; muleteers  seldom allow their animals to pass from one altitude to the other. These  _arrieros_, or muleteers, form a very important class in Ecuador. Their  little caravans are the only baggage and express trains in the republic;  there is not a single regularly established public conveyance in the  land. The _arrieros_ and their servants (_peons_) are Indians or  half-breeds. They wear a straw or felt hat, a poncho striped like an  Arab's blanket, and cotton breeches ending at the knees. For food they  carry a bag of parched corn, another bag of roasted barley-meal  (_mashka_), and a few red peppers. The beasts are thin, decrepit jades,  which threaten to give out the first day; yet they must carry you  halfway up the Andes. The distance to the capital is nearly two hundred  miles. The time required is usually eight or nine days; but officials  often travel it in four.    [Illustration: Equipped for the Andes.]    We left Bodegas at noon. It was impossible to start the muleteer a  moment earlier, though he had promised to be ready at seven. Patience is  a necessary qualification in a South American traveler. In our company  were a Jesuit priest, with three attendants, going to Riobamba, and a  young Quito merchant, with his mother--the mother of only twenty-five  children. This merchant had traveled in the United States, and could not  help contrasting the thrift and enterprise of our country with the  beggary and laziness of his own, adding, with a show of sincerity, \"I am  sorry I have Spanish blood in my veins.\" The suburbs of Bodegas reminded  us of the outskirts of Cairo; but the road soon entered a broad savannah  instead of a sandy desert. At 3 P.M. we passed through La Mona, a  village of twenty-five bamboo huts, all on stilts, for in the rainy  season the whole town is under water. Signs of indolence and neglect  were every where visible. Idle men, with an uncertain mixture of  European, Negro, and Indian blood; sad-looking Quichua women, carrying a  naked infant or a red water-jar on the back; black hogs and lean poultry  wandering at will into the houses--such is the picture of the motley  life in the inland villages. Strange was the contrast between human  poverty and natural wealth. We were on the borders of a virgin forest,  and the overpowering beauty of the vegetation soon erased all memory of  the squalor and lifelessness of La Mona. Our road--a mere path, suddenly  entered this seemingly impenetrable forest, where the branches crossed  overhead, producing a delightful shade. The curious forms of tropical  life were all attractive to one who had recently rambled over the  comparatively bleak hills of New England. Delight is a weak term to  express the feelings of a naturalist who for the first time wanders in a  South American forest. The superb banana, the great charm of equatorial  vegetation, tossed out luxuriantly its glossy green leaves, eight feet  in length; the slender but graceful bamboo shot heavenward, straight as  an arrow; and many species of palm bore aloft their feathery heads,  inexpressibly light and elegant. On the branches of the independent  trees sat tufts of parasites, many of them orchids, which are here  epiphytal; and countless creeping plants, whose long flexible stems  entwined snake-like around the trunks, or formed gigantic loops and  coils among the limbs. Beneath this world of foliage above, thick beds  of mimosae covered the ground, and a boundless variety of ferns attracted  the eye by their beautiful patterns.[11] It is easy to specify the  individual objects of admiration in these grand scenes, but it is not  possible to give an adequate idea of the higher feelings of wonder,  astonishment, and devotion which fill and elevate the mind. This road to  the Andes is a paradise to the contemplative man. \"There is something in  a tropical forest (says Bates) akin to the ocean in its effects on the  mind. Man feels so completely his insignificance, and the vastness of  nature.\" The German traveler Burmeister observes that \"the contemplation  of a Brazilian forest produced on him a painful impression, on account  of the vegetation displaying a spirit of restless selfishness, eager  emulation, and craftiness.\" He thought the softness, earnestness, and  repose of European woodland scenery were far more pleasing, and that  these formed one of the causes of the superior moral character of  European nations. Live and let live is certainly not the maxim taught in  these tropical forests, and it is equally clear that selfishness is not  wanting among the people. Here, in view of so much competition among  organized beings, is the spot to study Darwin's \"Origin of Species.\" We  have thought that the vegetation under the equator was a fitter emblem  of the human world than the forests of our temperate zone. There is here  no set time for decay and death, but we stand amid the living and the  dead; flowers and leaves are falling, while fresh ones are budding into  life. Then, too, the numerous parasitic plants, making use of their  neighbors as instruments for their own advancement, not inaptly  represent a certain human class.    [Footnote 11: Ferns constitute one sixth of the flora of South America;  Spruce counted 140 species within the space of three square miles. Their  limits of growth are 500 and 7000 feet above the sea.]          CHAPTER II.

We reached Savaneta at 5 P.M. This little village of hardly twenty  houses becomes the Bodegas, or place of deposit for the mountains six  months in the year, for in the _invierno_ the roads are flooded, and  canoes take the place of mules from Savaneta to Babahoyo. Even in the  dry season the dampness of this wilderness is so great that the  traveler's sugar and chocolate are melted into one, and envelopes seal  themselves. We put up at a _tambo_, or wayside inn, a simple two-storied  bamboo hovel, thatched with plantain leaves without and plastered with  cobwebs within, yet a palace compared with what sheltered us afterward.  The only habitable part was the second story, which was reached by a  couple of notched bamboo sticks. A hammock, two earthen kettles, two  plates, and a few calabashes constituted the household furniture. The  dormitory was well ventilated, for two sides were open. Our lodging,  however, cost us nothing; travelers only pay for _yerba_ for their  beasts. Though this has been the royal road to Quito for three  centuries, there is but one _posada_ between Guayaquil and Ambato, a  distance of one hundred and fifty miles; travelers must carry their own  bedding and provisions.    [Illustration: Ascending the Andes.]    Leaving Savaneta at dawn, and breakfasting at a wayside hut owned by an  old negro, we struck about noon the Rio Charriguajaco, dashing down the  mountains in hot haste for the Guayas. It was refreshing to look upon  living waters for the first time since leaving the hills of our  native country. Fording this stream we know not how many times, and  winding through the dense forest in narrow paths often blockaded by  laden donkeys that doggedly disputed the passage, we soon found  ourselves slowly creeping up the Andes. We frequently met mountaineers  on their way to Bodegas with loads of potatoes, peas, barley, fowls,  "]]]
