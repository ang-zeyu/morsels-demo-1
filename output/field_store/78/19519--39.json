Verily I seek  patience only in God, and Him do I regard as the goal of My desire. This  signifieth that I have the undoubted Truth on My side.    If thou art not apprehensive that the truth might be revealed and the  works of the ungodly be brought to naught, why summonest thou not the  divines of the land, and then summon Me, so that I may confound them  forthwith, even as those disbelievers whom I have previously confounded?  This is My sure testimony unto thee and unto them, if they speak the  truth. Summon thou all of them. Should they then be able to utter words  like unto this, thou wouldst know that their cause is worthy of attention.  Nay, by the righteousness of My Lord! They are bereft of power, nor are  they endued with perception. They professed faith in the past without  understanding its significance, then later they repudiated the Truth; for  they are devoid of discernment.    If thou hast decided to shed My blood, wherefore dost thou delay? Thou art  now endowed with power and authority. For Me it will prove an infinite  bounty conferred by God, while for thee and for them that would commit  such an act it will amount to a chastisement meted out by Him.    How great the blessedness that would await Me, wert thou to pass a verdict  such as this; and what immense joy would be Mine, shouldst thou agree to  do this! This is a bounty which God hath reserved for them that enjoy near  access to His court. Give then thy leave and wait no longer. In truth,  mighty is thy Lord, the Avenger.    Art thou not ashamed in the presence of God for consenting to the  consignment to a fortress of Him Who is the Testimony of God, and His  being made captive in the hands of the faithless? Woe betide thee and them  who rejoice at this moment in inflicting so dire a humiliation upon Me...    I swear by Him Who hath called Me into being, I can discover no trace of  sinfulness in Myself, nor have I followed aught but the Truth; and unto Me  God is sufficient witness. Fie upon the world and its people and upon  those who take delight in earthly riches, while oblivious of the life to  come.    Were the veil to be removed from thine eye thou wouldst crawl unto Me on  thy breast, even through the snow, from fear of the chastisement of God  which is swift and near at hand. By the righteousness of Him Who hath  created thee, wert thou to be acquainted with that which hath transpired  during thy reign, thou wouldst wish not to have issued from thy father's  loins, but rather to have passed into oblivion. However, that which God,  thy Lord, had ordained hath presently come to pass, and woe betide the  oppressors in this day.    Methinks thou hast not perused the unerring Book. If thou art satisfied  with thine own way and dost not wish to follow the Truth, then to Me be My  way and to thee thine. If thou aidest Me not, why dost thou seek to abase  Me? Verily, God is the hearer of the suppliant, and in Him all things find  their highest consummation, both in this world and in the world to come.    Far from the glory of God, the Lord of heaven and earth, the Lord of  creation, be that which is affirmed of Him by the peoples of the world,  except by such as faithfully observe His precepts. May the peace of God  rest upon the sincere among His servants.    All praise be to God, the Lord of all the worlds.          Extracts From A Further Epistle To Muhammad Shah      This is an Epistle from Him Who is the true, the undoubted Leader. Herein  is revealed the law of all things for those who fain would heed His Call  or wish to be reckoned among them that are guided aright. Herein is  enshrined the law of all things for such as would bear witness to the  Revelation of thy Lord in accordance with this clear balance. Verily the  ordinances of God concerning all things were formerly set forth in  eloquent Arabic. Indeed those whose souls have been created through the  splendour of the light of thy Lord recognize the Truth and are numbered  with such as faithfully obey the One True God and are well assured...    O Muhammad! The Decree of thy Lord was fulfilled four years ago; and ever  since the inception of the Cause of thy Lord I have warned thee to fear  God and not to be of the ignorant. I despatched a messenger unto thee with  a truly resplendent Tablet, but the followers of the devil turned him away  disdainfully and interposed themselves between him and thee. They expelled  him from the land whereof thou art the undisputed sovereign. Thus hath the  good of this world and of the next escaped thee, unless thou submit to the  commandment ordained by God and be of them that are rightly guided.    On My return from the sacred House of God(6) I sent thee a Message similar  to, nay even greater than the one I had previously sent unto thee. Indeed  God is the best protector and witness. I despatched a messenger unto thee  with Epistles revealed by Me, that thou mightest obey the command of God  and not be of them that have repudiated the Truth. The oppressor, however,  committed a thing the like of which no one would commit, not even any of  the wicked, nor anyone among the vile wrong-doers...    The tribulations which I have suffered in this land, no one of old hath  suffered. Verily unto God shall revert the whole affair, and He in truth  is the best protector and is cognizant of all. The things which have, from  the first day till now, befallen Me at the hand of thy people are but the  work of Satan.(7) Ever since the Cause of thy Lord hath appeared none of  thy deeds hath been acceptable, and thou hast been lost in palpable error  while all thou couldst see appeared to thee as deeds performed for the  sake of thy Lord. In truth thy day is nigh at hand and thou shalt be  questioned concerning all this, and assuredly God is not heedless of the  deeds of the wicked.    Had it not been for thee, thy supporters would not have disdainfully  rejected Me, though they have gone more widely astray than the foolish.    Dost thou imagine him whom thou hast appointed Chancellor in thy kingdom  to be the best leader and the best supporter? Nay, I swear by thy Lord. He  will bring thee into grievous trouble by reason of that which Satan  instilleth in his heart, and verily, he himself is Satan. He comprehendeth  not a single letter from the Book of God and is seized with fear by reason  of that which his hands have wrought. Fain would he extinguish the light  which thy Lord hath kindled, so that the old impiety which is concealed in  his inner being may not be revealed. Hadst thou not appointed him as thy  Chancellor no one would have paid him the slightest attention. Indeed in  the estimation of the people he is naught but manifest darkness...    Fear thou God and suffer not thy soul to be chastised beyond that with  which it hath already been tormented; for ere long thou shalt pass away  and shalt declare thyself clear of the devil whom thou hast appointed as  thy Chancellor, saying: 'O would that I had not taken the devil as my  Chancellor, nor appointed an impostor as my guide and adviser.'    Why dost thou burden thy soul with that which is far more abject than the  deeds of Pharaoh, and still callest thyself one of the faithful? How dost  thou peruse the verses of the Qur'an, while thou art of the unjust? Never  would the Jews, nor the Christians nor any such people as have rejected  the truth consent to inflict wrongs upon the son of their Prophet's  daughter. Woe betide thee, for the day of chastisement is approaching.  Dost thou not dread the wrath of thy Lord, the Almighty, the Lord of the  heavens, the Lord of all worlds? Indeed these manifest verses are  conclusive testimony for those who seek true guidance.    I have no desire to seize thy property, even to the extent of a grain of  mustard, nor do I wish to occupy thy position. If thou followest Me not,  then unto thee be the things thou dost possess, and unto Me the land of  unfailing security. If thou obeyest Me not, wherefore dost thou look  disdainfully upon Me and seek to treat Me with sore injustice? Verily,  behold My habitation--a lofty mountain wherein no one dwelleth. Woe betide  them that wrongfully do injustice to people, and unjustly and deceitfully  usurp the property of the believers in violation of His lucid Book;  whereas I, Who, in very truth, am the rightful Sovereign of all men,  designated by the true, the undeniable Leader, would never infringe on the  integrity of the substance of the people, were it to the extent of a grain  of mustard, nor would I treat them unjustly. Rather would I consort with  them even as one of themselves, and I would be their witness.    That which devolveth upon Me is but to mention the Book of thy Lord and to  deliver this clear Message. If thou wishest to enter the gates of  Paradise, lo, they are open before thy face and no harm can reach Me from  anyone. Every missive which up till now I have directed unto thee and unto  the custodian of thy affairs hath been but a token of My bounty to you  both, that perchance ye may grow anxious about the day which is nigh at  hand. Nevertheless from the moment ye waxed disdainful, divine judgement  was passed upon you in the Book of God, for in truth ye both have denied  your Lord and are numbered with them that will perish... This is indeed My  last reminder unto you, and I shall make no mention of you hereafter, nor  shall I make any remark other than affirming you as infidels.    Unto God do I commit Mine affair and yours, and He verily is the best  Judge. Were ye to return, however, ye would be granted whatever ye desire  of earthly possessions and of the ineffable delights of the life to come,  and ye would inherit such glorious might and majesty as your minds can  scarce conceive in this mortal life. But if ye fail to return then upon ye  shall be your"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18833"],[0,"With Clive in India; Or, The Beginnings of an Empire (#5)"],[1,"possible till we get about as far as the Cape. After  that, the rows will begin, and by the time we get to India, half the  people won't speak to each other.    \"Have you been down the river before? That's Gravesend. I see the  captain is getting ready to anchor. So, I suppose the tide has nearly  run out. If this wind holds, we shall be fairly out at sea when you  get up tomorrow.    \"You snore, I hope?\"    \"No, sir, I don't think so,\" Charlie said.    \"I hoped you did,\" the doctor said, \"because I'm told I do, sometimes.  However, as I usually smoke a cigar on deck, the last thing, I hope  you will be fairly asleep before I am. If at any time I get very bad,  and keep you awake, you must shake me.\"    Charlie said it took a good deal to keep him awake, and that he should  probably get accustomed to it, ere long.    \"It's better to do that,\" he said with a laugh, \"than to keep on  waking you, for the next four or five months.\"    A week later, the Lizzie Anderson was running down the Spanish coast,  with all sail set. She was out of sight of land, and so far had seen  nothing likely to cause uneasiness. They had met many vessels,  homeward bound from the Mediterranean, and one or two big ships which  the captain pronounced to be Indiamen. That morning, however, a vessel  was seen coming out from the land. She seemed, to Charlie's eyes,  quite a small vessel, and he was surprised to see how often the  captain and officers turned their glasses towards her.    \"I fancy our friend over there is a French privateer,\" the doctor  remarked to him; \"and I should not be surprised if we found ourselves  exchanging shots with her, before many hours are over.\"    \"But she's a little bit of a thing,\" Charlie said. \"Surely she would  never venture to attack a ship like ours.\"    \"It's the size of the guns, not the size of the ship, that counts, my  boy. She has the advantage of being able to sail three feet to our  two; and probably, small as she is, she carries half as many men again  as we do. However, we carry heavy metal, and can give a good account  of ourselves. Those thirty-twos will astonish our friend, if she comes  within range.\"    The stranger was a large schooner, and the tautness of the spars and  rigging showed that she was in beautiful order. She crossed the line  upon which the merchantman was sailing, some two miles in her rear;  and then, bearing up, followed in her wake.    Charlie stood near the captain, who, instead of watching her, was  sweeping the horizon with his glass. Presently he paused, and gazed  intently at a distant object.    \"I thought so,\" he said to the first officer. \"I fancied that fellow  wasn't alone. He would hardly have ventured to try his strength with  us, if he had been. Send a man up to the tops, and let him see what he  can make her out to be. I can only see her topmasts, but I can make  out no yards.\"    Presently the lookout came down, and reported that the distant vessel  appeared to be a large fore-and-aft schooner, bearing down upon them.    \"She will not be up for two hours, yet,\" the captain said. \"It will be  getting dark, then. It is not likely they will engage at night, but  they will keep close, and show their teeth at daybreak.\"    It soon became known that the belief of the captain was that the  vessel in their wake, and that which could be seen approaching on the  beam, were French privateers; and soon all were preparing, in their  own way, for what might happen. The sailors cleared the decks, and  loosed the guns. The gentlemen went below, and shortly returned  bringing up rifles and fowling pieces. Small arms and cutlasses were  brought up, and piled round the masts.    \"Why don't you put on more sail, sir?\" Mr. Ashmead, the member of the  council, said to the captain. \"My wife, sir, objects to the sound of  firearms, and I must really beg that you will increase your speed. As  it is, we are losing rather than gaining upon that vessel behind. The  duty of the ships of the Company is to try not to fight.\"    \"If they can help it,\" the captain added quietly. \"Not to fight, if  they can help it, Mr. Ashmead. But unfortunately, the choice upon the  present occasion lies with the gentlemen yonder, and not with us. It  is not of the slightest use adding to the sail we carry, for at our  very best speed, those schooners could sail round and round us. As  night comes on I intend to shorten sail, and put the ship into  fighting trim. In the morning I shall again increase it, but I shall  not make any attempt to escape a combat which it depends entirely on  those privateers to bring on, or not, as they choose. I am sorry that  Mrs. Ashmead should be exposed to the unpleasantness of listening to  the explosion of firearms, and that my other lady passengers should be  exposed to the danger which cannot but arise, more or less, from a  naval conflict.    \"However, I hope, sir, that there need be no great anxiety as to the  result. The Company has given us a heavy armament, and you may be sure  that we shall all do our best.\"    Seeing the gentlemen go below for their guns, Charlie asked one of the  other young writers, a lad of about his own age, named Peters, with  whom he had become very friendly, to go below with him. He had not yet  examined the arms that his uncle had given him, for he had not thought  of them since he saw the gun cases under his berth, on his first  arrival on board ship. He found the doctor already in his cabin,  putting together a heavy double-barrelled gun.    \"Well, youngster,\" he said, \"so we're likely to have a brush. I see  you have a couple of gun cases under your berth. You are a good deal  better provided than most lads who go out as writers.    \"Ah! That's a beautiful piece of yours,\" he said, as Charlie unlocked  one of the cases and took out a rifle, \"a small bore and a heavy  barrel, and beautifully finished. With a greased patch and a heavy  charge, that ought to carry a bullet far and true. Have you had any  practice?\"    \"Not with this gun, sir. I used, sometimes, to practise shooting at  gulls with a musket, on board the cutter my father commanded; and I  got to be a fair shot with it.\"    \"Then you ought to be able to do good work, with such a piece as that.  What is in the other case?    \"Ah! That's a beauty, too,\" he said, as he examined the  double-barrelled gun. \"Made extra strong and heavy, I see, so as to  carry bullets. You'll find your shoulder ache, at first; but you'll  get accustomed to it, in time. I'm always in favour of heavy barrels.  They shoot stronger and straighter than your light guns, are not so  liable to get bent or bruised, if a stupid servant drops one across a  stone; and, after all, two or three pounds difference in weight does  not make any material difference, when you're accustomed to it.  Although, I grant, a heavy gun does not come quite so quickly up to  the shoulder, for a snap shot.\"    \"Now, Peters,\" Charlie said, \"you take the double barrel. I will use  the rifle. Mine will come into play first, but, as my uncle said when  he gave it me, yours will do most execution at close quarters.\"    At dusk the schooners, having exchanged some signals by flags, took up  their positions, one on each quarter of the ship, at a distance of  some two miles.    \"Do not you think,\" Charlie asked his friend the doctor, \"that they  are likely to try and board us tonight?\"    \"No,\" the doctor said. \"These privateers generally depend upon their  long guns. They know that we shall be on the watch all night, and  that, in a hand-to-hand fight, they would lose a considerable number  of men; while by keeping at a distance, and maintaining a fire with  their long guns, they rely upon crippling their opponents; and then,  ranging up under their stern, pouring in a fire at close quarters  until they surrender.    \"Another thing is that they prefer daylight, as they can then see  whether any other vessel is approaching. Were one of our cruisers to  hear a cannonade in the night, she would come down and take them  unaware. No, I think you will see that at daylight, if the coast is  clear, they will begin.\"    Such was evidently the captain's opinion also, as he ordered sail to  be still further shortened, and all, save the watch on deck, to turn  in at once. The lights were all extinguished, not that the captain had  any idea of evading his pursuers, but that he wished to avoid offering  them a mark for their fire, should they approach in the darkness.        Chapter 3: A Brush With Privateers.      The night passed quietly. Once or twice lights were seen, as the  schooners showed a lantern for a moment to notify their exact position  to each other.    As soon as dawn broke, every man on board the Lizzie Anderson was at  his post. The schooners had drawn up a little, but were still under  easy sail. The moment that the day grew clear enough for it to be  perceived that no other sail could be seen above the horizon, fresh  sail was spread upon the schooners, and they began rapidly to draw up.    On the previous evening the four heavy guns had been brought aft, and  the Indiaman could have made a long running fight with her opponents,  had the captain been disposed. To this, however, he objected strongly,  as his vessel was sure to be hulled and knocked about severely, and  perhaps some of his masts cut down. He was confident in his power to  beat off the two privateers, and he therefore did not add a stitch of  canvas to the easy sail under which he had been holding on all night.    Presently a puff of smoke shot out from the bow of the schooner from  the weather quarter, followed almost instantaneously by one from her  consort. Two round shot struck up the water, the one under the  Indiaman's stern, the other under her forefoot.    \"The rascals are well within range,\" the captain said quietly. \"See,  they are taking off canvas again. They intend to keep at that  distance, and hammer away at us. Just what I thought would"]]]
