[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19511"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: Wimborne Minster and Christchurch Priory (#5)"],[1,"have contented  themselves with adding to the building without removing the work of  their predecessors more than was absolutely necessary. A very cursory  glance at the exterior of the building as one walks round it is  sufficient to show that the church as it stands offers to the student of  architecture examples of every style that has prevailed in this country  from the twelfth century onward, and he will especially rejoice at  seeing so much fourteenth-century work. He will, as he passes along the  narrow footway beneath the east end of the choir, regret that more space  is not available here to get a good view of the most interesting Early  English window. If a small tree were felled, and the wall of a garden  or yard on the side of the footpath opposite to the church pulled down,  so as to throw open the east end of the choir, it would be a great  improvement. But this regret can be endured, as, though the window  cannot be well seen, it is there, and by changing one's position a  pretty accurate idea of its interesting features can be formed; but  far keener is the regret that any lover of antiquity must feel when  he notices, as he examines the church more closely, how busy the  nineteenth-century restorer has been, how he has raised walls, altered  the pitch of roofs, and inserted modern imitations of thirteenth and  fourteenth century work, removing features which existed at the  beginning of this century to make room for his own work; how he has  banished much of the old woodwork in the interior, altered the position  of still more, and generally been far less conservative of the work of  former generations than the mediaeval enlargers of the minster were.  However, his work is now done--nave, towers, and choir were thoroughly  restored about fifty years ago, and the transepts in 1891. No further  work is contemplated at present. In fact, there seems nothing more that  could well be done.    [Illustration: THE MINSTER FROM THE SOUTH-EAST BEFORE 1891.]    The church is built partly of a warm brown sandstone, partly of stone of  a pale yellow or drab colour, the two kinds being in many places mixed  so as to give the walls a chequered appearance. This may be noticed both  outside and inside the building. In some of the walls the stones are  used irregularly, in others they are carefully squared. The red stone is  to be met with in the neighbourhood: some of that used for raising the  transept walls in 1891 was obtained from a bridge in the town that was  being rebuilt; and from marks on some of those stones it appeared that  before being in the bridge they had been used in some ecclesiastical  building, so that they have now returned to their original use. There  is little ornament to be seen outside, save on the upper stage of the  tower; in fact, the whole building excepting the arches of the nave and  the tower may be described as severely plain in character. The college  was never wealthy, hence probably it could not employ a number of  carvers; then again it was not a monastic establishment, so that there  were no monks to occupy their time in the embellishment of the building,  carving, as monks often did, their quaint fancies on bosses and  capitals. We miss the crockets and finials, the ball-flower, and other  ornaments that we meet with in so many fourteenth-century buildings; but  the very simplicity of the work gives the church a dignity that is often  wanting in more highly ornamented structures. The small number of the  buttresses in the body of the church is noteworthy; save at the angles  there are only five--namely, two on each nave aisle, and one on the  north choir aisle. At each of the eastern corners of the choir aisles  the buttresses are set diagonally, as also are those on the northern  corners of the north porch. There is a buttress on each of the side  walls of the north porch, and two set at right angles to each other  at each of the two corners of the north transept, and also at the  south-west corner of the south transept; beneath the east window of the  choir there is a small one. The buttresses at the corner of the choir  project but slightly. The central tower has none, but the west tower has  an octagonal buttress at each corner. The central tower attracts notice  first. From the outside at the angles a small portion of the plain wall  of the triforium stage may be seen, against which the roofs of the choir  and transepts abut; the nave roof, however, hides all of this stage at  the western face: above this face is a band of red-brown sandstone, and  above this the clerestory stage. In each face are two round-headed  windows with a pointed blank arch between them. There are six slender  shafts to support the outer order of moulding over the two windows and  the blank arch, and two of a similar character to support the inner ring  of moulding over each window. At each corner of the tower up to the top  of this stage runs a slender banded shaft. This stage is finished by a  string course, above which the tower walls recede slightly, the walls of  the upper or belfry storey being a little thinner than those below. This  stage, perfectly plain within, is the most richly-ornamented part of the  tower outside: it is the latest Norman work to be found in the minster,  and probably may be dated late in the twelfth century. An arcading of  intersecting round-headed arches runs all round this storey. Seven  pointed arches are thus formed in each face; between these arches stand  slender pillars with well carved capitals which show a great variety of  design. Five of the seven arches on each face were originally open, save  possibly for louvre-boards placed to keep out the rain; now all but the  central one on each face are walled up, and the centre one is glazed.  This filling up was not all done at the same time, as the varying  character of the stone shows. The work was no doubt begun in order to  strengthen the walls when the spire was added, and was continued from  time to time as the necessity for further strengthening arose. Above  the stage was a bold corbel table, and this is the upper limit of the  Norman work. There can be little doubt that the Norman builder, here as  elsewhere, finished his tower with a low pyramidal roof with overhanging  eaves to shoot off the rain. This covering may have been of lead, but  possibly of stone tiles or wooden shingles. About a century later this  Norman roof was removed to make place for a loftier roof or spire. Of  its character and material and height we know nothing--there is no  description of it; and though the minster is represented on an old seal  with one spire-crowned tower, yet the representation of the rest of the  church is so conventional that it cannot be regarded as an authentic  record of the actual appearance of the steeple. It is curious that, as  it stood for about three hundred years and fell only in the later years  of Elizabeth's reign, no drawing remains to show us what this spire was  like. But it passed away, doing some damage to the building in its fall,  and that is the only record it has left behind; but we can well picture  to ourselves how much importance must have been added to the minster by  this spire, which must have been a conspicuous object for many miles  round. The present heavy, ugly battlemented parapet spoils the general  effect of the tower; and though we are adverse to the sweeping away of  any features of an old building, even when the features are inharmonious  and even ugly--because this is, as it were, tearing a page of stone from  the book of the history of the building--yet we must confess we could  have regarded the loss of the seventeenth-century parapet and pinnacles  with much less regret than other features which the restorer has  tampered with.    [Illustration: THE NORTH TRANSEPT BEFORE 1891.]    The #North Porch#, which was evidently always intended to be, as it  is to this day, the chief entrance into the church, consists of two  bays marked externally by buttresses on each side: the inner order of  moulding to the arch giving access to this porch springs from two shafts  of Purbeck marble; the outer orders are carried up from the base without  any capitals or imposts. The height of the crown of the inner arch above  the capitals from which it springs is somewhat less than half the width  at the bottom, and the radius of the curvature of the arches is greater  than the width. Over the arch is a square-headed two-light window,  lighting the room over the entrance. The roof differs from all the other  roofs of the church since it is covered with stone tiles, while the  others are covered with lead. There are buttresses set diagonally at the  two northern angles of the porch.    Between the porch and the transept are three two-light Decorated  windows. The tracery of all these is alike, but differs from that of  the two windows to the west of the porch. The most picturesque feature  of the north transept is the turret containing the staircase by which  access is obtained to the tower. This, before the church was enlarged  in the fourteenth century, formed the north-west angle of the Norman  transept: projecting towards the north, its base is rectangular. This  rectangular portion rises nearly to the level of the tops of the aisle  windows, above this level the turret is circular, and rising above the  transept roof is capped by a low conical roof of stone tiles. Two string  courses run round it, one at the bottom of the circular part, and one a  little higher up. This turret was once known as the \"Ivy Tower,\" from  the ivy that grew on it, but this was all removed at the time when the  transept was altered in 1891. At that time the side walls were raised  about two feet, and the roof was raised to the original pitch of the  Norman transept, and at the same time the tracery of the north window,  which was of a very plain and clumsy character, seventeenth-century  work, was "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19529"],[0,"Nala and Damayanti and Other Poems (#5)"],[1,"narch--in his frenzy will not hear.      Charioteer, to thee my refuge--come I, do thou my behest;      I am not o'er calm in spirit--haply he may perish thus.      Yoke the much-loved steeds of Nala--fleet of foot, as thought, are they,      In the chariot place our children--to Cundina's city go.[61]      Leave the children with my kindred--and the chariot and the steeds;      Then or dwell there at thy pleasure--or depart where'er thou wilt.\"      When the speech of Damayanti--heard king Nala's charioteer,      He, the chief of Nala's council--thus in full divan addressed,      Weighed within their solemn conclave--and their full assent obtained,      With the children in the chariot--to Vidarbha straight he drove.      There he rendered up the horses--with the chariot there he left.      That young maiden Indrasena--Indrasen, that noble boy.      To king Bhima paid his homage--sad, for Nala's fall distressed,      Thence departing, to Ayodhya[62]--took the charioteer his way.      In his grief to Rituparna--that illustrious king, he came,      As his charioteer, the service--entered of the lord of earth.          BOOK IX.          Scarce Varshneya had departed--still the king of men played on,      Till to Pushkara his kingdom--all that he possessed, was lost.      Nala then, despoiled of kingdom--smiling Pushkara bespake:      \"Throw we yet another hazard--Nala, where is now thy stake?      There remains but Damayanti--all thou hast beside, is mine.      Throw we now for Damayanti--come, once more the hazard try.\"      Thus as Pushkara addressed him--Punyasloka's inmost heart      By his grief was rent asunder--not a single word he spake.      And on Pushkara, king Nala--in his silent anguish gazed.      All his ornaments of splendour--from his person stripped he off,      With a single vest, scarce covered,--'mid the sorrow of his friends.      Slowly wandered forth the monarch--fallen from such an height of bliss.      Damayanti with one garment--slowly followed him behind.      Three long nights Nishadha's monarch--there without the gates had dwelt.      Proclamation through the city--then did Pushkara bid make,      \"Whosoe'er befriendeth Nala--shall to instant death be doomed.\"      Thus, as Pushkara gave order--in the terror of his power,      Might the citizens no longer--hospitably serve the king.      Near the walls, of kind reception--worthiest, but by none received;      Three nights longer staid the monarch--water was his only drink,      He in unfastidious hunger--plucked the fruits, the roots of earth.      Then went forth again the outcast:--Damayanti followed slow.      In the agony of famine--Nala, after many days,      Saw some birds around him settling--with their golden tinctured wings.      Then the monarch of Nishadha--thought within his secret heart,      These to-day my welcome banquet--and my treasure these will be.      Over them his single garment--spreading light he wrapped them round:      Up that single garment bearing--to the air they sprang away;      And the birds above him hovering--thus in human accents spake,      Naked as they saw him standing--on the earth, and sad, and lone:--      \"Lo, we are the dice, to spoil thee--thus descended, foolish king!      While thou hadst a single garment--all our joy was incomplete.\"      When the dice he saw departing--and himself without his robe,      Mournfully did Punyasloka--thus to Damayanti speak:      \"They, O blameless, by whose anger--from my kingdom I am driven,      Life-sustaining food unable--in my misery to find--      They, through whom Nishadha's people--may not house their outcast king--      They, the forms of birds assuming--my one robe have borne away.      In the dark extreme of misery--sad and frantic as I am,      Hear me, princess, hear and profit--by thy husband's best advice.      Hence are many roads diverging--to the region of the south,[63]      Passing by Avanti's city[64]--and the height of Rishavan;      Vindhya here, the mighty mountain[65]--and Payoshni's seaward stream;[66]      And the lone retreats of hermits--on the fruits of earth that live;      This will lead thee to Vidarbha--this to Cosala away,[67]      Far beyond the region stretches--southward to the southward clime.\"      In these words to Damayanti--did the royal Nala speak,      More than once to Bhima's daughter--anxious pointing out the way.      She, with voice half choked with sorrow--with her weight of woe oppressed,      These sad words did Damayanti--to Nishadha's monarch speak:--      \"My afflicted heart is breaking--and my sinking members fail,      When, O king, thy desperate counsel--once I think of, once again.      Robbed of kingdom, robbed of riches--naked, thirst and hunger worn;      How shall I depart and leave thee--in the wood by man untrod.      When thou sad and famine-stricken--thinkest of thy former bliss,      In the wild wood, oh, my husband,--I thy weariness will soothe.      Like a wife, in every sorrow--this the wise physicians own,      Healing herb is none or balsam--Nala, 'tis the truth I speak.\"        NALA _spake_.        Slender-waisted Damayanti--true, indeed, is all thou'st said;      Like a wife no friendly medicine--to afflicted man is given.      Fear not that I thee abandon--Wherefore, timid, dread'st thou this?      Oh, myself might I abandon--and not thee, thou unreproached.        DAMAYANTI _spake_.        If indeed, oh mighty monarch--thou wilt ne'er abandon me,      Wherefore then towards Vidarbha--dost thou point me out the way.      Well, I know thee, noble Nala--to desert me far too true,      Only with a soul distracted--would'st thou leave me, lord of earth.      Yet, again, the way thou pointest--yet, again, thou best of men,      Thus my sorrow still enhancing--oh, thou like the immortal gods;      If this be thy better counsel--'to her kindred let her go,'      Be it so, and both together--to Vidarbha set we forth.      Thee Vidarbha's king will honour--honour'd in his turn by thee;      Held in high respect and happy--in our mansion thou shall dwell.          BOOK X.          NALA _spake_.        \"Mighty is thy father's kingdom--once was mine as mighty too;      Never will I there seek refuge--in my base extremity.      There I once appeared in glory--to the exalting of thy pride;      Shall I now appear in misery--to the increasing of thy shame?\"      Nala thus to Damayanti--spake again, and yet again,      Comforting the noble lady--scant in half a garment clad.      Both together by one garment[68]--covered, roamed they here and there;      Wearied out by thirst and famine--to a cabin drew they near.      When they reached that lowly cabin--then did great Nishadha's king      With the princess of Vidarbha--on the hard earth seat them down;      Naked, with no mat to rest on--wet with mire and stained with dust.      Weary then with Damayanti--on the earth he fell asleep.      Sank the lovely Damayanti--by his side with sleep opprest,      She thus plunged in sudden misery--she the tender, the devout.      But while on the cold earth slumbered--Damayanti, all distraught      Nala in his mind by sorrow--might no longer calmly sleep;      For the losing of his kingdom--the desertion of his friends,      And his weary forest wanderings--painful on his thought arose;      \"If I do it, what may follow?--what if I refuse to do?      Were my instant death the better--or to abandon her I love.      But to me too deep devoted--suffers she distress and shame;      Reft of me she home may wander--to her royal father's house;      Faithful wandering ever with me--certain sorrow will she bear,      But if separated from me--chance of solace may be hers.\"      Long within his heart he pondered--and again, again weighed o'er.      Best he thought it Damayanti--to desert, that wretched king.      From her virtue none dare harm her[69]--in the lonely forest way,      Her the fortunate, the noble--my devoted wedded wife.      Thus his mind on Damayanti--dwelt in its perverted thought,      Wrought by Kali's evil influence--to desert his lovely wife.      Of himself without a garment--and of her with only one.      As he thought, approached he near her--to divide that single robe.      \"How shall I divide the garment--by my loved one unperceived?\"      Pondering this within his spirit--round the cabin Nala went;      In that narrow cabin's circuit--Nala wandered here and there,      Till he found without a scabbard--shining, a well-tempered sword.      Then when half that only garment--he had severed, and put on,      In her sleep Vidarbha's princess--with bewildered mind he fled.      Yet, his cruel heart relenting--to the cabin turns he back;      On the slumbering Damayanti--gazing, sadly wept the king;      \"Thou, that sun nor wind hath ever--roughly visited, my love!      On the hard earth in a cabin--sleepest with thy guardian gone.      Thus attired in half a garment--she that aye so sweetly smiled,      Like to one distracted, beauteous--how at length will she awake?      How will't fare with Bhima's daughter--lone, abandoned by her lord,      Wandering in the savage forest--where wild beasts and serpents dwell.      May the suns and winds of heaven--may the genii of the woods,[70]      Noblest, may they all protect thee--thine own virtue thy best guard.\"      To his wife of peerless beauty--on the earth, 'twas thus he spoke.      Then of sense bereft by Kali--Nala hastily set forth;      And departing, still departing--he returned again, again;      Dragged away by that bad demon--ever by his love drawn back.      Nala, thus his heart divided--into two conflicting parts,      Like a swing goes backward, forward--from the cabin, to and fro.      Torn away at length by Kali--flies afar the frantic king,      Leaving there his wife in slumber--making miserable moans.      Reft of sense, possessed by Kali--thinking still on her he left,      Passed he in the lonely forest--leaving his"]]]
