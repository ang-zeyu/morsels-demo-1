Inquiry was made  after the removers; we were discovered and complained of; several of  us were corrected by our fathers; and, though I pleaded the usefulness  of the work, mine convinced me that nothing was useful which was not  honest.    I think you may like to know something of his person and character. He  had an excellent constitution of body, was of middle stature, but well  set, and very strong; he was ingenious, could draw prettily, was  skilled a little in music, and had a clear, pleasing voice, so that  when he played psalm tunes on his violin and sung withal, as he  sometimes did in an evening after the business of the day was over, it  was extremely agreeable to hear. He had a mechanical genius too, and,  on occasion, was very handy in the use of other tradesmen's tools; but  his great excellence lay in a sound understanding and solid judgment  in prudential matters, both in private and publick affairs. In the  latter, indeed, he was never employed, the numerous family he had to  educate and the straitness of his circumstances keeping him close to  his trade; but I remember well his being frequently visited by leading  people, who consulted him for his opinion in affairs of the town or of  the church he belonged to, and showed a good deal of respect for his  judgment and advice: he was also much consulted by private persons  about their affairs when any difficulty occurred, and frequently  chosen an arbitrator between contending parties. At his table he liked  to have, as often as he could, some sensible friend or neighbor to  converse with, and always took care to start some ingenious or useful  topic for discourse, which might tend to improve the minds of his  children. By this means he turned our attention to what was good,  just, and prudent in the conduct of life; and little or no notice was  ever taken of what related to the victuals on the table, whether it  was well or ill dressed, in or out of season, of good or bad flavor,  preferable or inferior to this or that other thing of the kind, so  that I was bro't up in such a perfect inattention to those matters as  to be quite indifferent what kind of food was set before me, and so  unobservant of it, that to this day if I am asked I can scarce tell a  few hours after dinner what I dined upon. This has been a convenience  to me in traveling, where my companions have been sometimes very  unhappy for want of a suitable gratification of their more delicate,  because better instructed, tastes and appetites.    My mother had likewise an excellent constitution: she suckled all her  ten children. I never knew either my father or mother to have any  sickness but that of which they dy'd, he at 89, and she at 85 years of  age. They lie buried together at Boston, where I some years since  placed a marble over their grave,[15] with this inscription:                         Josiah Franklin,                             and                       Abiah his wife,                     lie here interred.           They lived lovingly together in wedlock                      fifty-five years.         Without an estate, or any gainful employment,               By constant labor and industry,                    with God's blessing,               They maintained a large family                        comfortably,              and brought up thirteen children                   and seven grandchildren                         reputably.                 From this instance, reader,          Be encouraged to diligence in thy calling,                 And distrust not Providence.               He was a pious and prudent man;             She, a discreet and virtuous woman.                   Their youngest son,              In filial regard to their memory,                    Places this stone.            J. F. born 1655, died 1744, AEtat 89.            A. F. born 1667, died 1752,----85.        [15] This marble having decayed, the citizens of Boston      in 1827 erected in its place a granite obelisk,      twenty-one feet high, bearing the original inscription      quoted in the text and another explaining the erection      of the monument.    By my rambling digressions I perceive myself to be grown old. I us'd  to write more methodically. But one does not dress for private company  as for a publick ball. 'Tis perhaps only negligence.    To return: I continued thus employed in my father's business for two  years, that is, till I was twelve years old; and my brother John, who  was bred to that business, having left my father, married, and set up  for himself at Rhode Island, there was all appearance that I was  destined to supply his place, and become a tallow-chandler. But my  dislike to the trade continuing, my father was under apprehensions  that if he did not find one for me more agreeable, I should break away  and get to sea, as his son Josiah had done, to his great vexation. He  therefore sometimes took me to walk with him, and see joiners,  bricklayers, turners, braziers, etc., at their work, that he might  observe my inclination, and endeavor to fix it on some trade or other  on land. It has ever since been a pleasure to me to see good workmen  handle their tools; and it has been useful to me, having learnt so  much by it as to be able to do little jobs myself in my house when a  workman could not readily be got, and to construct little machines for  my experiments, while the intention of making the experiment was fresh  and warm in my mind. My father at last fixed upon the cutler's trade,  and my uncle Benjamin's son Samuel, who was bred to that business in  London, being about that time established in Boston, I was sent to be  with him some time on liking. But his expectations of a fee with me  displeasing my father, I was taken home again.          II    BEGINNING LIFE AS A PRINTER      From a child I was fond of reading, and all the little money that came  into my hands was ever laid out in books. Pleased with the _Pilgrim's  Progress_, my first collection was of John Bunyan's works in separate  little volumes. I afterward sold them to enable me to buy R. Burton's  _Historical Collections_; they were small chapmen's books,[16] and  cheap, 40 or 50 in all. My father's little library consisted chiefly  of books in polemic divinity, most of which I read, and have since  often regretted that, at a time when I had such a thirst for  knowledge, more proper books had not fallen in my way, since it was  now resolved I should not be a clergyman. Plutarch's _Lives_ there was  in which I read abundantly, and I still think that time spent to great  advantage. There was also a book of DeFoe's, called an _Essay on  Projects_, and another of Dr. Mather's, called _Essays to do Good_,  which perhaps gave me a turn of thinking that had an influence on  some of the principal future events of my life.        [16] Small books, sold by chapmen or peddlers.    This bookish inclination at length determined my father to make me a  printer, though he had already one son (James) of that profession. In  1717 my brother James returned from England with a press and letters  to set up his business in Boston. I liked it much better than that of  my father, but still had a hankering for the sea. To prevent the  apprehended effect of such an inclination, my father was impatient to  have me bound to my brother. I stood out some time, but at last was  persuaded, and signed the indentures when I was yet but twelve years  old. I was to serve as an apprentice till I was twenty-one years of  age, only I was to be allowed journeyman's wages during the last year.  In a little time I made great proficiency in the business, and became  a useful hand to my brother. I now had access to better books. An  acquaintance with the apprentices of booksellers enabled me sometimes  to borrow a small one, which I was careful to return soon and clean.  Often I sat up in my room reading the greatest part of the night, when  the book was borrowed in the evening and to be returned early in the  morning, lest it should be missed or wanted.    And after some time an ingenious tradesman, Mr. Matthew Adams, who  had a pretty collection of books, and who frequented our  printing-house, took notice of me, invited me to his library, and  very kindly lent me such books as I chose to read. I now took a fancy  to poetry, and made some little pieces; my brother, thinking it might  turn to account, encouraged me, and put me on composing occasional  ballads. One was called _The Lighthouse Tragedy_, and contained an  account of the drowning of Captain Worthilake, with his two daughters:  the other was a sailor's song, on the taking of _Teach_ (or  Blackbeard) the pirate. They were wretched stuff, in the  Grub-street-ballad style;[17] and when they were printed he sent me  about the town to sell them. The first sold wonderfully, the event  being recent, having made a great noise. This flattered my vanity; but  my father discouraged me by ridiculing my performances, and telling me  verse-makers were generally beggars. So I escaped being a poet, most  probably a very bad one; but as prose writing has been of great use to  me in the course of my life, and was a principal means of my  advancement, I shall tell you how, in such a situation, I acquired  what little ability I have in that way.        [17] Grub-street: famous in English literature as the      home of poor writers.    There was another bookish lad in the town, John Collins by name, with  whom I was intimately acquainted. We sometimes disputed, and very fond  we were of argument, and very desirous of confuting one another,  which disputatious turn, by the way, is apt to become a very bad  habit, making people often extremely disagreeable in company by the  contradiction that is necessary to bring it into practice; and thence,  besides souring and spoiling the conversation, is productive of  disgusts and, perhaps enmities where you may have occasion for  friendship."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20220"],[0,"The Mind and Its Education (#5)"],[1,"a circumstance that occurred  yesterday, how do you remember it?

CHAPTER II    ATTENTION      How do you rank in mental ability, and how effective are your mind's  grasp and power? The answer that must be given to these questions will  depend not more on your native endowment than on your skill in using  attention.      1. NATURE OF ATTENTION    It is by attention that we gather and mass our mental energy upon the  critical and important points in our thinking. In the last chapter we  saw that consciousness is not distributed evenly over the whole field,  but \"piled up,\" now on this object of thought, now on that, in obedience  to interest or necessity. _The concentration of the mind's energy on one  object of thought is attention._    THE NATURE OF ATTENTION.--Everyone knows what it is to attend. The story  so fascinating that we cannot leave it, the critical points in a game,  the interesting sermon or lecture, the sparkling conversation--all these  compel our attention. So completely is our mind's energy centered on  them and withdrawn from other things that we are scarcely aware of what  is going on about us.    We are also familiar with another kind of attention. For we all have  read the dull story, watched the slow game, listened to the lecture or  sermon that drags, and taken part in conversation that was a bore. We  gave these things our attention, but only with effort. Our mind's energy  seemed to center on anything rather than the matter in hand. A thousand  objects from outside enticed us away, and it required the frequent  \"mental jerk\" to bring us to the subject in hand. And when brought back  to our thought problem we felt the constant \"tug\" of mind to be free  again.    NORMAL CONSCIOUSNESS ALWAYS IN A STATE OF ATTENTION.--But this very  effort of the mind to free itself from one object of thought that it may  busy itself with another is _because attention is solicited by this  other_. Some object in our field of consciousness is always exerting an  appeal for attention; and to attend _to_ one thing is always to attend  _away from_ a multitude of other things upon which the thought might  rest. We may therefore say that attention is constantly _selecting_ in  our stream of thought those aspects that are to receive emphasis and  consideration. From moment to moment it determines the points at which  our mental energy shall be centered.      2. THE EFFECTS OF ATTENTION    ATTENTION MAKES ITS OBJECT CLEAR AND DEFINITE.--Whatever attention  centers upon stands out sharp and clear in consciousness. Whether it be  a bit of memory, an \"air-castle,\" a sensation from an aching tooth, the  reasoning on an algebraic formula, a choice which we are making, the  setting of an emotion--whatever be the object to which we are attending,  that object is illumined and made to stand out from its fellows as the  one prominent thing in the mind's eye while the attention rests on it.  It is like the one building which the searchlight picks out among a city  full of buildings and lights up, while the remainder are left in the  semilight or in darkness.    ATTENTION MEASURES MENTAL EFFICIENCY.--In a state of attention the mind  may be likened to the rays of the sun which have been passed through a  burning glass. You may let all the rays which can pass through your  window pane fall hour after hour upon the paper lying on your desk, and  no marked effects follow. But let the same amount of sunlight be passed  through a lens and converged to a point the size of your pencil point,  and the paper will at once burst into flame. What the diffused rays  could not do in hours or in ages is now accomplished in seconds.  Likewise the mind, allowed to scatter over many objects, can accomplish  but little. We may sit and dream away an hour or a day over a page or a  problem without securing results. But let us call in our wits from their  wool-gathering and \"buckle down to it\" with all our might, withdrawing  our thoughts from everything else but this _one thing_, and  concentrating our mind on it. More can now be accomplished in minutes  than before in hours. Nay, _things which could not be accomplished at  all before_ now become possible.    Again, the mind may be compared to a steam engine which is constructed  to run at a certain pressure of steam, say one hundred and fifty pounds  to the square inch of boiler surface. Once I ran such an engine; and  well I remember a morning during my early apprenticeship when the  foreman called for power to run some of the lighter machinery, while my  steam gauge registered but seventy-five pounds. \"Surely,\" I thought, \"if  one hundred and fifty pounds will run all this machinery, seventy-five  pounds should run half of it,\" so I opened the valve. But the powerful  engine could do but little more than turn its own wheels, and refused  to do the required work. Not until the pressure had risen above one  hundred pounds could the engine perform half the work which it could at  one hundred and fifty pounds. And so with our mind. If it is meant to do  its best work under a certain degree of concentration, it cannot in a  given time do half the work with half the attention. Further, there will  be much _which it cannot do at all_ unless working under full pressure.  We shall not be overstating the case if we say that as attention  increases in arithmetical ratio, mental efficiency increases in  geometrical ratio. It is in large measure a difference in the power of  attention which makes one man a master in thought and achievement and  another his humble follower. One often hears it said that \"genius is but  the power of sustained attention,\" and this statement possesses a large  element of truth.      3. HOW WE ATTEND    Someone has said that if our attention is properly trained we should be  able \"to look at the point of a cambric needle for half an hour without  winking.\" But this is a false idea of attention. The ability to look at  the point of a cambric needle for half an hour might indicate a very  laudable power of concentration; but the process, instead of  enlightening us concerning the point of the needle, would result in our  passing into a hypnotic state. Voluntary attention to any one object can  be sustained for but a brief time--a few seconds at best. It is  essential that the object change, that we turn it over and over  incessantly, and consider its various aspects and relations. Sustained  voluntary attention is thus a repetition of successive efforts to bring  back the object to the mind. Then the subject grows and develops--it is  living, not dead.    ATTENTION A RELATING ACTIVITY.--When we are attending strongly to one  object of thought it does not mean that consciousness sits staring  vacantly at this one object, but rather that it uses it as a central  core of thought, and thinks into relation with this object the things  which belong with it. In working out some mathematical solution the  central core is the principle upon which the solution is based, and  concentration in this case consists in thinking the various conditions  of the problem in relation to this underlying principle. In the  accompanying diagram (Fig. 4) let A be the central core of some object  of thought, say a patch of cloud in a picture, and let _a_, _b_, _c_,  _d_, etc., be the related facts, or the shape, size, color, etc., of the  cloud. The arrows indicate the passing of our thought from cloud to  related fact, or from related fact to cloud, and from related fact to  related fact. As long as these related facts lead back to the cloud each  time, that long we are attending to the cloud and thinking about it. It  is when our thought fails to go back that we \"wander\" in our attention.  Then we leave _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_, etc., which are related to the cloud,  and, flying off to _x_, _y_, and _z,_ finally bring up heaven knows  where.    [Illustration: FIG. 4]    THE RHYTHMS OF ATTENTION.--Attention works in rhythms. This is to say  that it never maintains a constant level of concentration for any  considerable length of time, but regularly ebbs and flows. The  explanation of this rhythmic action would take us too far afield at this  point. When we remember, however, that our entire organism works within  a great system of rhythms--hunger, thirst, sleep, fatigue, and many  others--it is easy to see that the same law may apply to attention. The  rhythms of attention vary greatly, the fluctuations often being only a  few seconds apart for certain simple sensations, and probably a much  greater distance apart for the more complex process of thinking. The  seeming variation in the sound of a distant waterfall, now loud and now  faint, is caused by the rhythm of"]]]
