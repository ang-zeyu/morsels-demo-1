Anyway, they always act as if they knew; and you  may safely follow the rule that, whatever your feeling is, whether fear  or doubt or confidence, the large and dangerous animals will sense it  instantly and adopt the opposite feeling for their rule of action. That  is the way I have always found it in the wilderness. I met a bear once  on a narrow path--but I must tell about that elsewhere.    The cries had ceased; the woods were all dark and silent when I came  back. I went as swiftly as possible--without heed or caution; for  whatever crackling I made the bear would attribute to the desperate  mother--to the spot where I had turned back. Thence I went on  cautiously, taking my bearings from one great tree on the ridge that  lifted its bulk against the sky; slower and slower, till, just this side  a great windfall, a twig cracked sharply under my foot. It was answered  instantly by a grunt and a jump beyond the windfall--and then the  crashing rush of a bear up the hill, carrying something that caught and  swished loudly on the bushes as it passed, till the sounds vanished in a  faint rustle far away, and the woods were still again.    All night long, from my tent over beyond an arm of the big lake, I heard  the mother calling at intervals. She seemed to be running back and forth  along the ridge, above where the tragedy had occurred. Her nose told her  of the bear and the man; but what awful thing they were doing with her  little one she knew not. Fear and questioning were in the calls that  floated down the ridge and across the water to my little tent.    At daylight I went back to the spot. I found without trouble where the  fawn had fallen; the moss told mutely of his struggle; and a stain or  two showed where Mooween grabbed him. The rest was a plain trail of  crushed moss and bent grass and stained leaves, and a tuft of soft hair  here and there on the jagged ends of knots in the old windfalls. So the  trail hurried up the hill into a wild, rough country where it was of no  use to follow.    As I climbed the last ridge on my way back to the lake, I heard  rustlings in the underbrush, and then the unmistakable crack of a twig  under a deer's foot. The mother had winded me; she was now following  and circling down wind to find out whether her lost fawn were with me.  As yet she knew not what had happened. The bear had frightened her into  extra care of the one fawn of whom she was sure. The other had simply  vanished into the silence and mystery of the great woods.    Where the path turned downward, in sight of the lake, I saw her for a  moment plainly, standing half hid in the underbrush, looking intently at  my old canoe. She saw me at the same instant and bounded away,  quartering up the hill in my direction. Near a thicket of evergreen that  I had just passed, she sounded her hoarse _K-a-a-h, k-a-a-h!_ and threw  up her flag. There was a rush within the thicket; a sharp _K-a-a-h!_  answered hers. Then the second fawn burst out of the cover where she had  hidden him, and darted along the ridge after her, jumping like a big red  fox from rock to rock, rising like a hawk over the windfalls, hitting  her tracks wherever he could, and keeping his little nose hard down to  his one needful lesson of following the white flag.    [Illustration]          ISMAQUES, THE FISHHAWK    [Illustration]      _Whit, whit, ch'wee? Whit, whit, whit, ch'weeeeee!_ over my head went  the shrill whistling, the hunting cry of Ismaques. Looking up from my  fishing I could see the broad wings sweeping over me, and catch the  bright gleam of his eye as he looked down into my canoe, or behind me at  the cold place among the rocks, to see if I were catching anything.  Then, as he noted the pile of fish,--a blanket of silver on the black  rocks, where I was stowing away chub for bear bait,--he would drop lower  in amazement to see how I did it. When the trout were not rising, and  his keen glance saw no gleam of red and gold in my canoe, he would  circle off with a cheery _K'weee!_ the good-luck call of a brother  fisherman. For there is no envy nor malice nor any uncharitableness in  Ismaques. He lives in harmony with the world, and seems glad when you  land a big one, even though he be hungry himself, and the clamor from  his nest, where his little ones are crying, be too keen for his heart's  content.    What is there in going a-fishing, I wonder, that seems to change even  the leopard's spots, and that puts a new heart into the man who hies him  away to the brook when buds are swelling? There is Keeonekh the otter.  Before he turned fisherman he was probably fierce, cruel, bloodthirsty,  with a vile smell about him, like all the other weasels. Now he lives at  peace with all the world and is clean, gentle, playful as a kitten and  faithful as a dog when you make a pet of him. And there is Ismaques the  fishhawk. Before he turned fisherman he was probably hated, like every  other hawk, for his fierceness and his bandit ways. The shadow of his  wings was the signal for hiding to all the timid ones. Jay and crow  cried _Thief! thief!_ and kingbird sounded his war cry and rushed out to  battle. Now the little birds build their nests among the sticks of his  great house, and the shadow of his wings is a sure protection. For owl  and hawk and wild-cat have learned long since the wisdom of keeping well  away from Ismaques' dwelling.    Not only the birds, but men also, feel the change in Ismaques'  disposition. I hardly know a hunter who will not go out of his way for a  shot at a hawk; but they send a hearty good-luck after this winged  fisherman of the same fierce family, even though they see him rising  heavily out of the very pool where the big trout live, and where they  expect to cast their flies at sundown. Along the southern New England  shores his coming--regular as the calendar itself--is hailed with  delight by the fishermen. One state, at least, where he is most  abundant, protects him by law; and even our Puritan forefathers, who  seem to have neither made nor obeyed any game laws, looked upon him with  a kindly eye, and made him an exception to the general license for  killing. To their credit, be it known, they once \"publikly reeprimanded\"  one Master Eliphalet Bodman, a son of Belial evidently, for violently,  with powder and shot, doing away with one fishhawk, and wickedly  destroying the nest and eggs of another.    Whether this last were also done violently, with powder and shot, by  blowing the nest to pieces with an old gun, or in simple boy-fashion by  shinning up the tree, the quaint old town record does not tell. But all  this goes to show that our ancestors of the coast were kindly people at  heart; that they looked upon this brave, simple fisherman, who built his  nest by their doors, much as the German village people look upon the  stork that builds upon their chimneys, and regarded his coming as an  omen of good luck and plenty to the fisher folk.    Far back in the wilderness, where Ismaques builds his nest and goes  a-fishing just as his ancestors did a thousand years ago, one finds the  same honest bird, unspoiled alike by plenty or poverty, that excited our  boyish imagination and won the friendly regard of our ancestors of the  coast. Opposite my camp on the lake, where I tarried long one summer,  charmed by the beauty of the place and the good fishing, a pair of  fishhawks had built their nest in the top of a great spruce on the  mountain side. It was this pair of birds that came daily to circle over  my canoe, or over the rocks where I fished for chub, to see how I fared,  and to send back a cheery _Ch'wee! chip, ch'weeee!_ \"good luck and good  fishing,\" as they wheeled away. It would take a good deal of argument  now to convince me that they did not at last recognize me as a  fellow-fisherman, and were not honestly interested in my methods and  success.    At first I went to the nest, not so much to study the fishhawks as to  catch fleeting glimpses of a shy, wild life of the woods, which is  hidden from most eyes. The fishing was good, and both birds were expert  fishermen. While the young were growing there was always an abundance in  the big nest on the spruce top. The overflow of this abundance, in the  shape of heads, bones and unwanted remnants, was cast over the sides of  the nest and furnished savory pickings for a score of hungry prowlers.  Mink came over from frog hunting in the brook, drawn by the good smell  in the air. Skunks lumbered down from the hill, with a curious, hollow,  bumping sound to announce their coming. Weasels, and one grizzly old  pine marten, too slow or rheumatic for successful tree hunting, glided  out of the underbrush and helped themselves without asking leave.  Wild-cats quarreled like fiends over the pickings; more than once I  heard them there screeching in the night. And one late afternoon, as I  lingered in my hiding among the rocks while the shadows deepened, a big  lucivee stole out of the bushes, as if ashamed of himself, and took to  nosing daintily among the fish bones.    It was his first appearance, evidently. He did not know that the feast  was free, but thought all the while that he was stealing somebody's  catch. One could see it all in his attitudes, his starts and listenings,  his low growlings to himself. He was bigger than anybody else there, and  had no cause to be afraid; but there is a tremendous respect among all  animals for the chase law and the rights of others; and the big cat felt  it. He was hungry for fish; but, big as he was, his every movement  showed that he was ready to take to his heels before the first little  creature that should rise up and screech in his face: \"This is mine!\"  Later, when he grew accustomed to things and the fishhawks' generosity  in providing a feast for all who might"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22107"],[0,"Wood-Carving: Design and Workmanship (#5)"],[1," wide, a small  iron \"bull-nose\" plane, and a keyhole saw, will all be helpful, and save  a lot of unnecessary labor with the carving tools.          CHAPTER III    SHARPENING-STONES--MALLET AND BENCH           Different Stones in use--Case for Stones--Slips--Round Mallet       Best--A Home-Made Bench--A Makeshift Bench--Cramps and Clips.      The stones which are most generally used for the purpose of sharpening  carving tools are \"Turkey\" and \"Washita.\" There are many others, some  equally good, but \"Washita\" is easily procured and very serviceable. It  is to be had in various grades, and it may be just as well to have one  coarse and one fine, but in any case we must have a fine-grained stone  to put a keen edge on the tools. A \"Turkey\" stone is a fine-grained and  slow-cutting one, and may take the place of the finer \"Washita.\" The  \"India\" oilstone is a composition of emery with some kind of stone dust,  and is a useful stone for quickly rubbing down superfluous steel before  putting an edge to the tool. It is better to get these stones without  cases, as they can then be used on both sides, one for flat tools and  one for gouges, which wear the face of a stone into grooves. A case may  be made by hollowing out a block of wood so as to take the stone  loosely; and if at one end a small notch is made in this block, a  screwdriver may be inserted under the stone when it is necessary to turn  it. Two brads or pins should be inserted in holes, having their points  just appearing below the bottom of the block. These prevent it slipping  about when in use. These stones should be lubricated with a mixture of  olive oil and paraffin in equal parts. Bicycle lubricating oil is very  good for this purpose.    [Illustration: FIG. 4.]    For sharpening the insides of tools, \"slips\" are made with rounded edges  of different sizes. One slip of \"Washita\" stone and one of \"Arkansas\"  will be enough for the present, as they will fit moderately well most of  the gouges in the beginner's set of tools; the \"Arkansas\" being used for  the smaller tools. The \"Arkansas\" slip should be what is called  \"knife-edged.\" This is required for sharpening such tools as the veiner  and V tool; it is a very fine marble-like stone, and exceedingly  brittle; care must be taken in handling it, as a fall would in all  probability be fatal.      THE BENCH AND MALLET    _The Mallet._--The carver's mallet is used for driving his tools where  force is required. The most suitable form is the round one, made of  beech; one 4 ins. diameter will be heavy enough.    _The Bench._--Every carver should provide himself with a bench. He may  make one for himself according to the size and construction shown in the  illustration, Fig. 5. The top should be made of two 11 x 2 in. boards,  and, as steadiness is the main feature to be aimed at, the joints should  have some care. Those in illustration are shown to be formed by  checking one piece of wood over the other, with shoulders to resist  lateral strain. Proper tenons would be better, but more difficult to  make. It must have a projecting edge at the front and ends, to receive  the clamps. The bench should have a joiner's \"bench-screw\" attached to  the back leg for holding work which is to be carved on its edges or  ends. The feet should be secured to the floor by means of iron brackets,  as considerable force is applied in carving hard wood, which may move  the bench bodily, unless it is secured, or is very heavy. Professional  carvers use a bench which is composed of beech planks, three or four  inches in thickness, and of length according to shop-room.    [Illustration: FIG. 5.]    [Illustration: FIG. 6]    Should it not be possible to make or procure a bench, then a substitute  must be used. Fig. 6 gives a suggestion for making such a temporary  bench. The top is composed of one piece of board, 11 ins. wide and 1-1/2  in. thick. It should be about 2 ft. 6 ins. long and rest on two blocks  fixed about 1-1/2 in. from the ends, which must project, as in Fig. 6.  This may be used on any ordinary table, to which it should be secured by  means of two 3-1/2-in. clamps. The height from the floor should be 3 ft.  2 ins. to top of board. This gives a good height for working, as carvers  invariably stand to their work. The height can be regulated by making  the blocks, _a_, higher or lower to suit the table which is to be used.    [Illustration: FIG. 7.]    _Cramps._--Cramps for holding the work in position on the bench are of  several kinds. For ordinary thicknesses of wood, two 4-1/2-in. screw  clamps, like the one in Fig. 7, will be sufficient. Wooden blocks may be  also used to hold one end of the work down while the other is held by a  clamp. These blocks are notched out to fit over the thickness of the  board being carved, as in Fig. 7. Carvers use for their heavier work a  \"bench-screw,\" as it is called; that is, a screw which passes through  the bench into the back of the work, which may thus be turned about at  will; also, if the work is very thick, they hold it in position by means  of a bench \"holdfast,\" a kind of combined lever and screw; but neither  of these contrivances is likely to be required by the beginner, whose  work should be kept within manageable dimensions.          CHAPTER IV    WOODS USED FOR CARVING           Hard Wood and Soft Wood--Closeness of Grain Desirable--Advantages       of Pine and English Oak.      The woods suitable for carving are very various; but we shall confine  our attention to those in common use. Of the softer woods, those which  are most easily procured and most adaptable to modern uses are yellow  pine, Bass wood, Kauri pine, and Lime. These are all good woods for the  carver; but we need not at present look for any better qualities than  we shall find in a good piece of yellow pine, free from knots or shakes.    The following woods may be considered as having an intermediate place  between soft and hard: Sycamore, Beech, and Holly. They are  light-colored woods, and Very useful for broad shallow work.    _English Oak._--Of the hard woods in common use, the principal kinds are  Oak, Walnut, and occasionally Mahogany. Of oak, the English variety is  by far the best for the carver, being close in the grain and very hard.  It is beyond all others the carvers' wood, and was invariably used by  them in this country during the robust period of medieval craftsmanship.  It offers to the carver an invigorating resistance to his tools, and its  character determines to a great extent that of the work put upon it. It  takes in finishing a very beautiful surface, when skilfully handled--and  this tempts the carver to make the most of his opportunities by adapting  his execution to its virtues. Other oaks, such as Austrian and American,  are often used, but they do not offer quite the same tempting  opportunity to the carver. They are, by nature, quicker-growing trees,  and are, consequently, more open in the grain. They have tough, sinewy  fibers, alternating with softer material. They rarely take the same  degree of finish as the English oak, but remain somewhat dull in  texture. Good pieces for carving may be got, but they must be picked out  from a quantity of stuff. Chestnut is sometimes used as a substitute for  oak, but it is better fitted for large-scaled work where fineness of  detail is not of so much importance.    _Italian Walnut._--This is a very fine-grained wood, of even texture.  The Italian variety is the best for carving: it cuts with something of  the firmness of English oak, and is capable of receiving even more  finish of surface in small details. It is admirably suited for fine work  in low relief. In choosing this wood for carving, the hardest and  closest in grain should be picked, as it is by no means all of equal  quality. It should be free from sap, which may be known by a light  streak on the edges of the dark brown wood.    English walnut has too much \"figure\" in the grain to be suitable for  carving. American walnut is best fitted for sharply cut shallow carving,  as its fiber is caney. If it is used, the design should be one in which  no fine modeling or detail is required, as this wood allows of little  finish to the surface.    _Mahogany_, more especially the kind known as Honduras, is very similar  to American walnut in quality of grain: it cuts in a sharp caney manner.  The \"Spanish\" variety was closer in grain, but is now almost  unprocurable. Work carved in mahogany should, like that in American  walnut, be broad and simple in style, without much rounded detail.    It is quite unnecessary to pursue the subject of woods beyond the few  kinds mentioned. Woods such as ebony, sandalwood, cherry, brier, box,  pear-tree, lancewood, and many others, are all good for the carver, but  are better fitted for special purposes and small work. As this book is  concerned more with the _art_ of carving than its application, it will  save confusion if we accept yellow pine as our typical soft wood, and  good close-grained oak as representing hard wood. It may be noted in  passing that the woods of all flowering and fruit-bearing trees are very  liable to the attack of worms and rot.    No carving, in whatever wood, should be polished. I shall refer to this  when we come to \"texture\" and \"finish.\"          CHAPTER V    SHARPENING THE TOOLS           The Proper Bevel--Position of Tools on Oilstone--Good and Bad       Edge--Stropping--Paste and Leather--Careless Sharpening--Rubbing       Out the Inside--Stropping Fine Tools--Importance of Sharp Tools.      Having given this brief description of the tools and materials used by  carvers, we shall suppose a piece of work is about to be started. The  first thing the carver will require to do is to sharpen his tools. That  is, if we may assume that they have just come from the manufacturer,  ground but not yet brought to an edge. It will be seen that each has a  long bevel ending in a blunt ridge where the cutting"]]]
