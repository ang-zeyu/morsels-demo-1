Then I made a hike, for I didn't like to hear him sizzle so;     And the heavens scowled, and the huskies howled, and the wind began to blow.     It was icy cold, but the hot sweat rolled       down my cheeks, and I don't know why;     And the greasy smoke in an inky cloak went streaking down the sky.       I do not know how long in the snow I wrestled with grisly fear;     But the stars came out and they danced about ere again I ventured near;     I was sick with dread, but I bravely said:  \"I'll just take a peep inside.     I guess he's cooked, and it's time I looked\";...       then the door I opened wide.       And there sat Sam, looking cool and calm, in the heart of the furnace roar;     And he wore a smile you could see a mile,       and he said:  \"Please close that door.     It's fine in here, but I greatly fear you'll let in the cold and storm --     Since I left Plumtree, down in Tennessee,       it's the first time I've been warm.\"            _There are strange things done in the midnight sun           By the men who moil for gold;          The Arctic trails have their secret tales           That would make your blood run cold;          The Northern Lights have seen queer sights,           But the queerest they ever did see          Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge           I cremated Sam McGee._          My Madonna           I haled me a woman from the street,      Shameless, but, oh, so fair!     I bade her sit in the model's seat      And I painted her sitting there.       I hid all trace of her heart unclean;      I painted a babe at her breast;     I painted her as she might have been      If the Worst had been the Best.       She laughed at my picture and went away.      Then came, with a knowing nod,     A connoisseur, and I heard him say;      \"'Tis Mary, the Mother of God.\"       So I painted a halo round her hair,      And I sold her and took my fee,     And she hangs in the church of Saint Hillaire,      Where you and all may see.          Unforgotten           I know a garden where the lilies gleam,      And one who lingers in the sunshine there;      She is than white-stoled lily far more fair,     And oh, her eyes are heaven-lit with dream!       I know a garret, cold and dark and drear,      And one who toils and toils with tireless pen,      Until his brave, sad eyes grow weary -- then     He seeks the stars, pale, silent as a seer.       And ah, it's strange; for, desolate and dim,      Between these two there rolls an ocean wide;      Yet he is in the garden by her side     And she is in the garret there with him.          The Reckoning           It's fine to have a blow-out in a fancy restaurant,     With terrapin and canvas-back and all the wine you want;     To enjoy the flowers and music, watch the pretty women pass,     Smoke a choice cigar, and sip the wealthy water in your glass.     It's bully in a high-toned joint to eat and drink your fill,     But it's quite another matter when you                                             Pay the bill.       It's great to go out every night on fun or pleasure bent;     To wear your glad rags always and to never save a cent;     To drift along regardless, have a good time every trip;     To hit the high spots sometimes, and to let your chances slip;     To know you're acting foolish, yet to go on fooling still,     Till Nature calls a show-down, and you                                             Pay the bill.       Time has got a little bill -- get wise while yet you may,     For the debit side's increasing in a most alarming way;     The things you had no right to do, the things you should have done,     They're all put down; it's up to you to pay for every one.     So eat, drink and be merry, have a good time if you will,     But God help you when the time comes, and you                                             Foot the bill.          Quatrains           One said:  Thy life is thine to make or mar,     To flicker feebly, or to soar, a star;      It lies with thee -- the choice is thine, is thine,     To hit the ties or drive thy auto-car.       I answered Her:  The choice is mine -- ah, no!     We all were made or marred long, long ago.      The parts are written; hear the super wail:     \"Who is stage-managing this cosmic show?\"       Blind fools of fate and slaves of circumstance,     Life is a fiddler, and we all must dance.      From gloom where mocks that will-o'-wisp, Free-will     I heard a voice cry:  \"Say, give us a chance.\"       Chance!  Oh, there is no chance!  The scene is set.     Up with the curtain!  Man, the marionette,      Resumes his part.  The gods will work the wires.     They've got it all down fine, you bet, you bet!       It's all decreed -- the mighty earthquake crash,     The countless constellations' wheel and flash;      The rise and fall of empires, war's red tide;     The composition of your dinner hash.       There's no haphazard in this world of ours.     Cause and effect are grim, relentless powers.      They rule the world.  (A king was shot last night;     Last night I held the joker and both bowers.)       From out the mesh of fate our heads we thrust.     We can't do what we would, but what we must.      Heredity has got us in a cinch --     (Consoling thought when you've been on a \"bust\".)       Hark to the song where spheral voices blend:     \"There's no beginning, never will be end.\"      It makes us nutty; hang the astral chimes!     The tables spread; come, let us dine, my friend.          The Men That Don't Fit In           There's a race of men that don't fit in,      A race that can't stay still;     So they break the hearts of kith and kin,      And they roam the world at will.     They range the field and they rove the flood,      And they climb the mountain's crest;     Theirs is the curse of the gypsy blood,      And they don't know how to rest.       If they just went straight they might go far;      They are strong and brave and true;     But they're always tired of the things that are,      And they want the strange and new.     They say:  \"Could I find my proper groove,      What a deep mark I would make!\"     So they chop and change, and each fresh move      Is only a fresh mistake.       And each forgets, as he strips and runs      With a brilliant, fitful pace,     It's the steady, quiet, plodding ones      Who win in the lifelong race.     And each forgets that his youth has fled,      Forgets that his prime is past,     Till he stands one day, with a hope that's dead,      In the glare of the truth at last.       He has failed, he has failed; he has missed his chance;      He has just done things by half.     Life's been a jolly good joke on him,      And now is the time to laugh.     Ha, ha!  He is one of the Legion Lost;      He was never meant to win;     He's a rolling stone, and it's bred in the bone;      He's a man who won't fit in.          Music in the Bush           O'er the dark pines she sees the silver moon,      And in the west, all tremulous, a star;     And soothing sweet she hears the mellow tune      Of cow-bells jangled in the fields afar.       Quite listless, for her daily stent is done,      She stands, sad exile, at her rose-wreathed door,     And sends her love eternal with the sun      That goes to gild the land she'll see no more.       The grave, gaunt pines imprison her sad gaze,      All still the sky and darkling drearily;     She feels the chilly breath of dear, dead days      Come sifting through the alders eerily.       Oh, how the roses riot in their bloom!      The curtains stir as with an ancient pain;     Her old piano gleams from out the gloom      And waits and waits her tender touch in vain.       But now her hands like moonlight brush the keys      With velvet grace -- melodious delight;     And now a sad refrain from over seas      Goes sobbing on the bosom of the night;       And now she sings.  (O! singer in the gloom,      Voicing a sorrow we can ne'er express,     Here in the Farness where we few have room      Unshamed to show our love and tenderness,       Our hearts will echo, till they beat no more,      That song of sadness and of motherland;     And, stretched in deathless love to England's shore,      Some day she'll hearken and she'll understand.)       A prima-donna in the shining past,      But now a mother growing old and gray,     She thinks of how she held a people fast      In thrall, and gleaned the triumphs of a day.       She sees a sea of faces like a dream;      She sees herself a queen of song once more;     She sees lips part in rapture, eyes agleam;      She sings as never once she sang before.       She sings a wild, sweet song that throbs with pain,      The added pain of life that transcends art --     A song of home, a deep, celestial strain,      The glorious swan-song of a dying heart.       A lame tramp comes along the railway track,      A grizzled dog whose day is nearly done;     He passes, pauses, then comes slowly back      And listens there -- an audience of one.       She sings -- her golden voice is passion-fraught,      As when she charmed a thousand eager ears;     He listens trembling, and she knows it not,      And down his hollow cheeks roll bitter tears.       She ceases and is still, as if to pray;      There is no sound, the stars are all alight --     Only a wretch who stumbles on his way,      Only a vagrant sobbing in the night.          The Rhyme of the Remittance Man           There's a four-pronged buck a-swinging in the shadow of my cabin,      And it roamed the velvet valley till to-day;     But I tracked it by the river, and I trailed it in the cover,      And I killed it on the mountain miles away.     Now I've had my lazy supper, and the level sun"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2070"],[0,"To the Last Man (#5)"],[1,"will meet me here,\" he said,  his voice ringing deep in his ears.    \"Shore I will,\" she replied, softly, and turned to him.  It seemed then  that Jean saw her face for the first time.  She was beautiful as he had  never known beauty.  Limned against that scene, she gave it life--wild,  sweet, young life--the poignant meaning of which haunted yet eluded  him.  But she belonged there.  Her eyes were again searching his, as if  for some lost part of herself, unrealized, never known before.  Wondering, wistful, hopeful, glad--they were eyes that seemed surprised,  to reveal part of her soul.    Then her red lips parted.  Their tremulous movement was a magnet to  Jean. An invisible and mighty force pulled him down to kiss them.  Whatever the spell had been, that rude, unconscious action broke it.    He jerked away, as if he expected to be struck. \"Girl--I--I\"--he gasped  in amaze and sudden-dawning contrition--\"I kissed you--but I swear it  wasn't intentional--I never thought....\"    The anger that Jean anticipated failed to materialize.  He stood,  breathing hard, with a hand held out in unconscious appeal.  By the  same magic, perhaps, that had transfigured her a moment past, she was  now invested again by the older character.    \"Shore I reckon my callin' y'u a gentleman was a little previous,\" she  said, with a rather dry bitterness.  \"But, stranger, yu're sudden.\"    \"You're not insulted?\" asked Jean, hurriedly.    \"Oh, I've been kissed before.  Shore men are all alike.\"    \"They're not,\" he replied, hotly, with a subtle rush of disillusion, a  dulling of enchantment.  \"Don't you class me with other men who've  kissed you.  I wasn't myself when I did it an' I'd have gone on my  knees to ask your forgiveness.... But now I wouldn't--an' I wouldn't  kiss you again, either--even if you--you wanted it.\"    Jean read in her strange gaze what seemed to him a vague doubt, as if  she was questioning him.    \"Miss, I take that back,\" added Jean, shortly.  \"I'm sorry.  I didn't  mean to be rude.  It was a mean trick for me to kiss you.  A girl alone  in the woods who's gone out of her way to be kind to me!  I don't know  why I forgot my manners.  An' I ask your pardon.\"    She looked away then, and presently pointed far out and down into the  Basin.    \"There's Grass Valley.  That long gray spot in the black.  It's about  fifteen miles.  Ride along the Rim that way till y'u cross a trail.  Shore y'u can't miss it.  Then go down.\"    \"I'm much obliged to you,\" replied Jean, reluctantly accepting what he  regarded as his dismissal.  Turning his horse, he put his foot in the  stirrup, then, hesitating, he looked across the saddle at the girl. Her  abstraction, as she gazed away over the purple depths suggested  loneliness and wistfulness.  She was not thinking of that scene spread  so wondrously before her.  It struck Jean she might be pondering a  subtle change in his feeling and attitude, something he was conscious  of, yet could not define.    \"Reckon this is good-by,\" he said, with hesitation.    \"ADIOS, SENOR,\" she replied, facing him again.  She lifted the little  carbine to the hollow of her elbow and, half turning, appeared ready to  depart.    \"Adios means good-by?\" he queried.    \"Yes, good-by till to-morrow or good-by forever.  Take it as y'u like.\"    \"Then you'll meet me here day after to-morrow?\"  How eagerly he spoke,  on impulse, without a consideration of the intangible thing that had  changed him!    \"Did I say I wouldn't?\"    \"No.  But I reckoned you'd not care to after--\" he replied, breaking  off in some confusion.    \"Shore I'll be glad to meet y'u.  Day after to-morrow about  mid-afternoon.  Right heah.  Fetch all the news from Grass Valley.\"    \"All right.  Thanks.  That'll be--fine,\" replied Jean, and as he spoke  he experienced a buoyant thrill, a pleasant lightness of enthusiasm,  such as always stirred boyishly in him at a prospect of adventure.  Before it passed he wondered at it and felt unsure of himself. He  needed to think.    \"Stranger shore I'm not recollectin' that y'u told me who y'u are,\" she  said.    \"No, reckon I didn't tell,\" he returned.  \"What difference does that  make?  I said I didn't care who or what you are.  Can't you feel the  same about me?\"    \"Shore--I felt that way,\" she replied, somewhat non-plussed, with the  level brown gaze steadily on his face.  \"But now y'u make me think.\"    \"Let's meet without knowin' any more about each other than we do now.\"    \"Shore.  I'd like that.  In this big wild Arizona a girl--an' I reckon  a man--feels so insignificant.  What's a name, anyhow?  Still, people  an' things have to be distinguished.  I'll call y'u 'Stranger' an' be  satisfied--if y'u say it's fair for y'u not to tell who y'u are.\"    \"Fair!  No, it's not,\" declared Jean, forced to confession.  \"My name's  Jean--Jean Isbel.\"    \"ISBEL!\" she exclaimed, with a violent start.  \"Shore y'u can't be son  of old Gass Isbel.... I've seen both his sons.\"    \"He has three,\" replied Jean, with relief, now the secret was out. \"I'm  the youngest.  I'm twenty-four.  Never been out of Oregon till now.  On  my way--\"    The brown color slowly faded out of her face, leaving her quite pale,  with eyes that began to blaze.  The suppleness of her seemed to stiffen.    \"My name's Ellen Jorth,\" she burst out, passionately.  \"Does it mean  anythin' to y'u?\"    \"Never heard it in my life,\" protested Jean.  \"Sure I reckoned you  belonged to the sheep raisers who 're on the outs with my father.  That's why I had to tell you I'm Jean Isbel.... Ellen Jorth. It's  strange an' pretty.... Reckon I can be just as good a--a friend to  you--\"    \"No Isbel, can ever be a friend to me,\" she said, with bitter coldness.  Stripped of her ease and her soft wistfulness, she stood before him one  instant, entirely another girl, a hostile enemy.  Then she wheeled and  strode off into the woods.    Jean, in amaze, in consternation, watched her swiftly draw away with  her lithe, free step, wanting to follow her, wanting to call to her;  but the resentment roused by her suddenly avowed hostility held him  mute in his tracks.  He watched her disappear, and when the  brown-and-green wall of forest swallowed the slender gray form he  fought against the insistent desire to follow her, and fought in vain.        CHAPTER II    But Ellen Jorth's moccasined feet did not leave a distinguishable trail  on the springy pine needle covering of the ground, and Jean could not  find any trace of her.    A little futile searching to and fro cooled his impulse and called  pride to his rescue.  Returning to his horse, he mounted, rode out  behind the pack mule to start it along, and soon felt the relief of  decision and action.  Clumps of small pines grew thickly in spots on  the Rim, making it necessary for him to skirt them; at which times he  lost sight of the purple basin.  Every time he came back to an opening  through which he could see the wild ruggedness and colors and  distances, his appreciation of their nature grew on him. Arizona from  Yuma to the Little Colorado had been to him an endless waste of  wind-scoured, sun-blasted barrenness.  This black-forested rock-rimmed  land of untrodden ways was a world that in itself would satisfy him.  Some instinct in Jean called for a lonely, wild land, into the  fastnesses of which he could roam at will and be the other strange self  that he had always yearned to be but had never been.    Every few moments there intruded into his flowing consciousness the  flashing face of Ellen Jorth, the way she had looked at him, the things  she had said.  \"Reckon I was a fool,\" he soliloquized, with an acute  sense of humiliation.  \"She never saw how much in earnest I was.\"  And  Jean began to remember the circumstances with a vividness that  disturbed and perplexed him.    The accident of running across such a girl in that lonely place might  be out of the ordinary--but it had happened.  Surprise had made him  dull. The charm of her appearance, the appeal of her manner, must have  drawn him at the very first, but he had not recognized that.  Only at  her words, \"Oh, I've been kissed before,\" had his feelings been checked  in their heedless progress.  And the utterance of them had made a  difference he now sought to analyze.  Some personality in him, some  voice, some idea had begun to defend her even before he was conscious  that he had arraigned her before the bar of his judgment.  Such defense  seemed clamoring in him now and he forced himself to listen.  He  wanted, in his hurt pride, to justify his amazing surrender to a sweet  and sentimental impulse.    He realized now that at first glance he should have recognized in her  look, her poise, her voice the quality he called thoroughbred.  Ragged  and stained apparel did not prove her of a common sort.  Jean had known  a number of fine and wholesome girls of good family; and he remembered  his sister.  This Ellen Jorth was that kind of a girl irrespective of  her present environment.  Jean championed her loyally, even after he  had gratified his selfish pride.    It was then--contending with an intangible and stealing glamour, unreal  and fanciful, like the dream of a forbidden enchantment--that Jean  arrived at the part in the little woodland drama where he had kissed  Ellen Jorth and had been unrebuked.  Why had she not resented his  action?  Dispelled was the illusion he had been dreamily and nobly  constructing.  \"Oh, I've been kissed before!\"  The shock to him now  exceeded his first dismay.  Half bitterly she had spoken, and wholly  scornful of herself, or of him, or of all men.  For she had said all  men were alike.  Jean chafed under the smart of that, a taunt every  decent man hated.  Naturally every happy and healthy young man would  want to kiss such red, sweet lips.  But if those lips had been for  others--never for him!  Jean reflected that not since childish games  had he kissed a girl--until this brown-faced Ellen Jorth"]]]
