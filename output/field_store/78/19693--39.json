(#5)"],[1,"fixing the complete frame together, the small projecting ends are  levelled off flush with the cross rails.    GAUGING.--After squaring all the shoulder lines round the timber with the  knife and try square, the mortise gauge should be set so as to strike the  two gauge lines marked G, Figs. 83 and 84, at one operation. If the  worker does not possess a mortise gauge the lines may be marked at two  distinct operations with the aid of the marking gauge (Fig. 82). The  gauge should be adjusted so as to mark the wood into thirds, and the  stock of the gauge (the portion of the gauge containing the thumb screw  in Fig. 82) must be used from the face side of the timber when gauging up  the whole of the pieces forming a frame. The face mark on the work is  indicated by a glorified comma, and the edge mark is shown by X, as in  the various illustrations. Fig. 82 shows the method of holding the gauge  in the right hand whilst gauging the lines on the work.    [Illustration: Fig. 81.--Bridle Joint, open and closed.]    [Illustration: Fig. 82.--Gauging the Timber.]    The joint, when marked out, will appear as at Figs. 83 and 84, and the  portions which are to be cut away may be shaded with a pencil as  indicated; this will prevent mistakes arising whilst cutting the work,  especially by one who is not thoroughly familiar with the joint.    The distance A B, in Fig. 84, must not be less than the distance A B in  Fig. 83.    [Illustration: Fig. 83., Fig. 84. The Two Parts of the Joint  Marked.]    BORING AWAY WASTE.--Examine Fig. 84; the shaded portion in the centre has  to be cut away, and it will greatly facilitate the removal of this waste  piece by boring a hole with a twist bit at the position shown. The twist  bit should be about 1/8 in. less in diameter than the width between the  gauge lines G. The easiest method of boring out this hole is shown at  Fig. 85, which gives the correct position of the worker.    [Illustration: Fig. 85.--Vertical Boring previous to Chiselling.]    SAWING.--The wood should be put in the vice as Fig. 86. Taking up a saw,  with the index finger on the side of the handle, commence sawing, and  proceed until you come to the position indicated by the dotted hand and  saw A; this will leave a saw kerf or cut running diagonally from the  shoulder line to corner of the wood. Release the vice and refix the wood  so that it leans in exactly the opposite direction to Fig. 86; then  reverse your own position and repeat the sawing, so as to cut another  diagonal saw cut from the shoulder line to the corner. Fix the wood  upright, as shown at Fig. 87, and saw as shown, when you will find that  the saw has no tendency to run out of the guide cuts already formed by  the method used at Fig. 86. Remember, when commencing to saw at Fig. 86,  that it is necessary to saw inside the gauge line; otherwise the joint  will be too slack, owing to the amount of sawdust removed by the  thickness of the saw blade. The index finger on the side of the saw,  pointing in the direction of the saw cut, will greatly help the worker  to saw in a straight line, as it is natural to point with this finger to  any object that is to be aimed at.    [Illustration: Fig. 86.--How the Saw is held for the first Cut.]    Cut down the other line in a similar manner, and then with a chisel of  suitable width carefully chop away the waste material. The wood may be  placed edge way upon the bench, or in the vice, and the chisel should be  held vertically. The hole which has been bored with the twist bit will  allow the chips which are cut away to offer little or no resistance to  the chisel blade. The chiselling should not all be done from one side, or  a chipped under-edge will be the result; it is better to chisel the work  until half-way through and then turn the other edge of the wood uppermost  and again begin to chisel from the top. This method will finish the  cutting in the centre of the work and prevent burred and ragged or  chipped edges at the shoulder.    [Illustration: Fig. 87.--Third, or Horizontal Cut.]    [Illustration: Fig. 88.--Chiselling Operation.]    CUTTING THE SHOULDERS.--With regard to working the piece B, Fig. 81,  place the wood against the bench stop or in the vice, and taking up a  3/4-in. chisel carefully cut away a small channel, as shown at Fig. 88;  treat the other shoulder lines in a similar manner. If the marking knife  or penknife blade has been used with a fair amount of pressure so as to  score the fibres of the wood, this small channel, which is to form a  guide for the saw, will quickly and easily be cut. Next place the wood in  the vice or on the cutting board as shown at Fig. 89, and begin by sawing  lightly at the back edge as shown. When the saw has entered the wood 1/4  in. gradually bring the handle down from position A to position B (dotted  lines) whilst the saw is in motion. Continue sawing until just on the  gauge line; then treat the other shoulder lines in a similar manner.    [Illustration: Fig. 89.--Sawing the Shoulders.]    CHISELLING AWAY WASTE.--Fix your wood firmly in any suitable manner, vice  or otherwise, and, holding your chisel tilted as at Fig. 90, pare away  the blacked portion 1; then pare away the blacked portion 2; after which  hold the chisel flat and by gradual operations pare away the dotted lines  3, until you come down to the gauge line; then repeat the method of  cutting on the opposite side of the wood. If any difficulty be  experienced by chipped or ragged edges whilst chiselling, it can easily  be overcome by chiselling alternately from the outside of the wood, so  that the finish of the chisel cut takes place in the centre of the work.  Some prefer to chisel away the waste by placing the wood on its edge and  using the chisel vertically instead of horizontally. The same methods (1,  2 and 3) hold good in this case.    [Illustration: Fig. 90.--Chiselling away Waste.]    JOINTS OTHER THAN AT 90 deg..--The two pieces forming a bridle joint are not  always at right angles, as at Fig. 81; in many instances it is necessary  that the joint be at other than 90 degrees. The work, however, is treated  in a similar manner, with the exception that an adjustable joiner's bevel  is used instead of a try square to mark out the shoulder lines, and that  a change of direction in the grain of the wood will occur when chiselling  out the work. Fig. 91 indicates the change in the grain of the wood, and  the adjustable joiner's bevel is also shown.    [Illustration: Fig. 91.--Bridle Joint at Angle other than Right Angle.]    [Illustration: Fig. 92.--Sawing off Waste from Bridle Joint. (See  reference on page 39.)]          THE TONGUED AND GROOVED JOINT      The tongued and grooved joint is used in one form or another throughout  the whole of the woodworking trades, covering, as it does, a great  variety of work from the laying of flooring boards to the construction of  dressers, bookcases and other cabinet work.    FLOORING and match boarding generally have the tongues worked on the  solid board, and examples of a few of the various types are shown as  follows:--    [Illustration: Fig. 93.--Tongued and Grooved Flooring Board.]    [Illustration: Fig. 94., Fig. 95. Method of Nailing Hardwood  Floors.]    Fig. 93 shows the end view of the ordinary 7/8-in. \"Tongued and Grooved  Flooring board,\" as used in the construction of floors for mills,  workshops and cottage property. This type of flooring is nailed to the  joists in the ordinary manner, no attempt being made to conceal the nails  used.    Fig. 94 is a section of flooring which is generally made of hardwood,  such as maple, oak, or jarrah. It is used in positions such as ballroom  and skating rink floors, etc., the tongue and groove being worked in such  a manner that the joint covers the nails as shown. Each nail is driven  into its position at one edge of the board, the groove holding the next  board and hiding the nail (Fig. 95).    [Illustration: Fig. 96.--Tongued and Grooved Matchboarding, with Bead on  One Side.]    [Illustration: Fig. 97.--Tongued and Grooved Matchboarding, with Bead at  Each Side.]    [Illustration: Fig. 98.--Matchboarding, Tongued, Grooved and Vee'd.]    Fig. 96 shows an example of matchboarding known as \"Tongued, Grooved and  Beaded\" on one side only, and Fig. 97 shows a similar type tongued,  grooved and beaded on both sides. This variety of matchboarding is known  in the trade as \"T. G. and B.\" It is used for nailing on framing to form  partitions for rooms, offices, etc., for panelling corridors, etc., and  for making framed and ledged doors, building tool houses, cycle sheds and  other outhouses.    Fig. 98 is an example of matchboarding that is tongued, grooved and vee'd  on one side, and Fig. 99 shows tongued, grooved and vee'd both sides.  These are used for similar purposes to Figs. 96 and 97, and many prefer  the V matchboarding variety because it is more easily painted than the  beaded variety.    The object of working a bead or beads on matchboarding is to break the  jointing of the various pieces and to aim at ornamental effect; also to  prevent unsightliness should the timber shrink slightly. When a moderate  amount of shrinkage takes place, as is nearly always the case, the joint  at the side of the bead appears to the casual observer to be the fillet  or channel worked at the side of the bead. If the tongues are not painted  before the work is put together, the shrinkage will cause the raw wood to  show and thus make the joint too much in evidence.    [Illustration: Fig. 99.--Matchboarding Vee'd Both Sides.]    [Illustration: Fig. 100.--Double-tongued Matchboarding.]    [Illustration: Fig. 101.--Double-dovetailed, Tongued and Grooved.]    Fig. 100 shows a \"Double tongued and grooved\" joint used in the wholesale  cabinet factories. It is preferred for the jointing of cabinet stock, and  the amateur can make a similar joint by working two grooves and inserting  loose tongues."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21534"],[0,"Textiles and Clothing (#5)"],[1," known as  \"loading\" or \"weighting,\" and gives increased body and weight to the  silk. Silk without weighting is known as \"pure dye,\" of which there is  little made, as such goods take too much silk.      [Illustration: REELING SILK]      For the weighting of white or light colored silk goods, tin crystals  (stanous chloride) are used and for dark shades and black, iron salts  and tannin. By this means the original weight of the fiber may be  increased three or four hundred per cent. This result is not attained,  however, except through the weakening of the fiber.    [Sidenote: Action of Common Salt]    Common salt has a very curious action on weighted silk. It slowly  weakens the fiber. A silk dress may be ruined by being splashed with  salt water at the seashore. Most often holes appear after a dress comes  back from the cleaners; these he may not be to blame for, as salt is  abundant in nearly all the bodily secretions,--tears, perspiration,  urine.    [Sidenote: Artificial Silk]    Artificial silk is made by dissolving cellulose obtained from cotton. It  is lacking in strength and water spoils all kinds manufactured at  present.    [Sidenote: Characteristics of Silk]    Silk, like wool, has the property of absorbing considerable moisture  without becoming perceptibly damp. Like wool and all the animal fibers,  it is harmed by alkalis. The important physical properties of silk are  its beautiful luster, strength, elasticity and the readiness with which  it takes dyes. Silk combines well with other fibers, animal and  vegetable.    [Sidenote: Value of Raw Fibers]    A comparison of the relative value of textile fibers may be seen from  the following approximate prices:         Cotton--$.07 to $.14 per pound; loss in cleaning and bleaching 5       per cent.         Flax--$.12 to $.30 per pound; loss in cleaning and bleaching about       20 per cent.         Wool--$.15 to $.30 per pound; loss in scouring 20 to 60 per cent.         Raw Silk--$7.00 to $10.00 per pound; loss in \"boiling off\" about 30       per cent which is made up and much more by \"loading.\"          MODERN METHODS      All the complex processes and machinery of the textile industry are but  developments of the old-time methods of the home. Brief outlines only  will be given here for the processes are most intricate in detail.      SPINNING    The spinning of cotton yarn (thread) is typical of all the fibers. The  stages may be divided into--    1. Opening and picking.  2. Carding.  3. Combing.  4. Drawing.  5. Spinning.    [Sidenote: Picking and Carding]    The picking and carding have for their object the removal of all foreign  substances with as little damage to the fiber as possible. The foreign  substances in cotton are sand, dirt, pieces of leaves, seed, husk, etc.,  which have become mixed with the fiber during the process of growing,  ginning and transportation.    [Sidenote: Cleaning]    The cotton bales are opened and thrown into the automatic feeder which  carries up a layer of cotton on a spiked apron from which it is removed  by a rapidly revolving \"doffer\" underneath which is a screen which  catches some of the dirt. It is next fed between rolls in front of a  rapidly revolving blunt-edged knife which throws out more of the dirt  through a screen. There is a suction of air through the screen which  helps remove the foreign substances. The cotton passes through several  of such machines, being formed into a soft web or \"lap\" which is wound  into a roll.    [Sidenote: Carding]    The carding machine further cleans the fibers and lays them in a general  parallel position. From this machine the web is formed into \"sliver,\" a  loose rope of cotton fiber about two inches in diameter. This is  received in circular cans.      [Illustration: COTTON OPENER AND PICKER    The cotton from the bale is thrown into _A_, carried by the spiked  aprons _B_ and _C_, evened by _E_, removed from the apron by _F_ (some  of the dirt falls through the screen into box _G_) is beaten by the  revolving \"knife,\" _N P_, more dirt being removed through screen _N_,  then goes through the flue _C_ to the next machine.]      [Sidenote: Combing]    The combing is omitted for short fiber cotton, but is used in worsted  spinning and with long staple cotton to remove the short fibers. Cotton  to be used for making yarn suitable for hosiery, underwear, sewing  thread, lace, and for very fine cotton fabrics is carded.    In drawing, from six to sixteen \"slivers\" are run together and the  fibers drawn out in several stages until the soft rope is about an  eighth of an inch in diameter, called \"roving.\" This tends to get rid of  any unevenness and makes the fibers all parallel. From this machine the  roving is wound on a bobbin ready for the spinning frame.      [Illustration: COTTON CARD    The roll of webbing _A_ is beaten and transferred to the cylinder _H H_,  carded by the spiked belt _E_, removed by the \"doffer\" and formed into a  \"sliver\" which runs into the can _M_.]      [Sidenote: Spinning]    The spinning frame may have a hundred spindles or more, each one of  which is drawing out its supply of \"roving\" to the required size of yarn  and giving it the twist necessary to bind the fibers together. The yarn  to be used for the warp is given a harder twist so that it may be strong  enough to stand the strain in weaving. The yarn for filling is usually  left soft.      [Illustration: COTTON COMB, USED FOR LONG STAPLE]    [Illustration: RECEIVING THE \"SLIVER\" AT THE BACK OF THE DRAWING  FRAME.]    [Illustration: DRAWING FRAME Drawing the Roving Finer.]    [Illustration: A FLY SPINNING FRAME The Spools of Roving Above Are Being  Drawn Out, Given the Twist by the Fliers, and Wound on Bobbins Below.]    [Illustration: MULE DRAWING AND SPINNING FRAME Always used for wool.  Part of the machine moves away from the frame, thus drawing out the  thread, which is then twisted.]    [Illustration: MODERN RING SPINNING FRAME FOR COTTON. SIXTY-EIGHT  SPINDLES Gives the Largest Production.]    [Illustration: A PLAIN POWER LOOM WEAVING LINEN]      The yarn for warp is now usually given a coating or \"sizing\" of starch  and gums so that the thread may not become unwound and break during  weaving.    The process of spinning is much the same for flax and for wool, although  somewhat differently constructed machines must be used. Flax is usually  spun wet.      WEAVING    [Sidenote: Modern Loom]    The modern power driven loom is a wonderful piece of machinery. The  principle of its operation is essentially the same as the hand loom, but  it is almost perfectly automatic in its action, a man or woman being  able to tend from ten to fifteen looms weaving plain cotton goods.    [Sidenote: Warping]    The yarn coming from the spinning frame is sometimes dyed before  weaving. The warp is formed by winding as many threads as the width of  the fabric is to contain on a slowly revolving drum, called a \"beam,\" in  the same relative position in which they are to appear in the finished  cloth. From its position on the beam at the back of the loom, each  thread is brought through its particular loop or eye with the heddle,  then passes through its own slot in the reed, and down to the roller or  \"cloth beam\" that is to take up the woven cloth. This is called \"drawing  in the warp.\" If there is a piece of cloth coming from the loom, the  work is very simple, for the ends of the new warp are tied to the ends  remaining from the warp that has been woven out.    The shuttle with its bobbin, containing the yarn of the filling, is much  the same as is used in the hand looms, except for form and size, which  varies according to the requirements and size of the warp being used. At  first only one shuttle was used, but in 1760 Robert Kay invented a  mechanism by which several shuttles containing different grades or  colors of yarn might be used. Each throw of the shuttle across the width  of the goods is called a \"pick.\"    [Sidenote: The Harness]    In making a cloth with plain weave, that is, with every thread  interlacing with every other, as in darning, only two harnesses are  required, but the modern loom may have up to about twenty-four harnesses  so that an infinite variety of weaves may be obtained. Various cams and  levers move the harness frame and so raise or lower the threads required  for the design.    [Sidenote: Jacquard Loom]    The Jacquard loom is arranged on a different principle. In this loom,  all kinds of fancy weaves may be obtained as in table linen, tapestries  and carpets. Each warp thread is supplied with a separate hook and by  means of perforated card the desired threads are raised or depressed at  each throw of the shuttle. The cards are worked out by the designer. A  set of a thousand or more cards may be required to produce the desired  design. Jacquard looms are sometimes to be seen at fairs and expositions  weaving handkerchiefs with some picture design.      [Illustration: JACQUARD HAND LOOM Weaving Ingrain Carpet at Hull  House.]      WEAVES    The great variety of weaves found in the textiles of to-day are  modifications of a few fundamental weaves invented in the earliest  times.    The chief fundamental weaves are:    (1) Plain weave.  (2) Twills.  (3) Sateen.    To which may be added the derivatives--    (4) Rib weave.  (5) Basket weave.      [Illustration: DIAGRAM OF FANCY KNIT GOODS]      These do not include the many fancy weaves, too numerous to classify,  and the open work weaves, made in the Leno loom, in which some of the  threads are crossed. Knit goods are made by the interlooping of a single  thread, by hand or on circular knitting machines and lace by an  analogous process, using several systems of threads. Felt is made up of  matted fibers of fur and wool and has no thread structure.      [Illustration: WEAVE DIAGRAMS]      [Sidenote: Plain Weave]    The plain weave is the most common, nearly all light weight goods being  thus woven. In plain weaving,"]]]
