They were, he said, notorious  ruffians, but except for rioting and wounding among their compatriots,  with which the police did not concern themselves, they had been able to  find nothing against them, though they strongly suspected that they were  concerned in many crimes. We went down with them to that quarter, and  the police soon found out the place where they lived, but on enquiry  were assured that both men were ill, the old woman who came to the door  declaring that they had been in bed for some days. However, the police  insisted upon entering, and speedily brought them down. Sidi recognized  them at once, and indeed they had scarcely lied in saying that they were  ill, for the eyelids of one were so swollen and blackened that he could  not see out of them, while the other's nose was well-nigh as big as the  rest of his face.    \"They were at once taken before the cadi. He heard my son's evidence,  and then said that had it been proved they attempted to steal the horse,  he would have had their heads smitten off, but that though this was  doubtless their intention, they had not done so. He sentenced them to a  hundred blows with a stick, and to be expelled from the town and  neighbourhood, warning them that should they be found near the town  again, they would assuredly be punished with death. I waited and saw the  blows administered, and although I felt angry that the cadi had not  ordered them to execution, I admit that the punishment was severe  enough, and the wretches howled like whipped curs. I trust that there  will be no more trouble from them. Still, I hope that this will not  prevent your son coming to visit us.\"    \"Certainly not, sheik. He is prepared and ready to go, and he is looking  forward to his stay with you with so much pleasure that even did I wish  it I could not now deprive him of the enjoyment of it. Still, I am  heartily glad that the two fellows have been expelled the town, for I  should never have felt easy as to Edgar's safety so long as they were  here.\"    A few minutes later the party set out. Edgar's valise was fastened to  the saddle of one of the sheik's followers. The road ran along the sandy  dunes that divided the low country, formerly covered by Lake Mareotis,  from the sea, and as soon as they were well out from the town the horses  were broke into a gallop. While in point of actual speed even the best  Arab horses cannot hold their own against a moderate English race-horse,  whose greater height and longer stride gives him an advantage, they are  greatly superior in last, and possess extraordinary endurance and  stamina. Brought up as if belonging to the family of their owners, their  intelligence has been cultivated as has that of dogs. They are  exceedingly docile and affectionate. Their pace is a very easy one, and  Edgar was delighted indeed at the manner in which his new acquisition  flew along without any apparent exertion, continuing the pace without a  check until they reached the Arab encampment in an hour and twenty  minutes from leaving Alexandria.    Here they leapt from their horses in front of a group of black tents.  The oasis was of small extent, extending but two hundred yards across.  In the centre was a group of thirty or forty palm-trees. Near these the  herbage was thick, gradually dwindling away until it became lost in the  sand. In the centre, near the tents, was a well, an irregularly-shaped  pit some five-and-twenty feet deep, with a rough path down to it by  which the women went to get water both for their own use and for that of  the horses. A score of these were tethered on the grass.    \"You are welcome to our tents,\" the sheik said; \"may your visit be a  fortunate one! Mulick,\" he called to one of the Arab boys, \"take Beauty;  but first,\" he went on to Edgar, \"it were best that you talked to him a  little, and gave him some sweets. He will soon get to love you, and it  is well that he should hear your voice as often as possible.\"    \"I will lead him out myself,\" Edgar replied, \"and then Mulick can tether  him. I shall know another time how to do it myself.\"    Then he patted the Arab's glossy neck, rubbed its ears, and praised it,  giving it a handful of sweets while he did so. Beauty evidently  appreciated the attentions, and replied to him by a low whinny. Then he  took off its saddle and led it to a spot Mulick pointed out, and then  watched the boy tether it, and took off the bridle and carried it back  to the tents. A woman came out from the largest of these. She was not  veiled, for except when they go into the towns the Bedouin women seldom  conceal their faces.    \"Ayala,\" the sheik said, \"this is the young white lord who saved Sidi  from those who attacked him; henceforth he is as one of our tribe.\"    \"May the blessings of Allah fall upon you!\" the woman said. \"Sidi is our  only child. Had he been taken from us our lives would have been desolate  indeed.\"    \"I am very glad that I happened to come along at the time,\" Edgar said.  \"It has been a most fortunate occurrence for me, as much indeed as for  Sidi. I have no friends of my own age, and it will be great pleasure to  me to have him as a sort of brother. I am sure that we shall get on  capitally together. Besides which, your husband has given me a grand  horse, such as I could never have obtained for money. Sidi will be able  to teach me Arab ways, and I daresay I shall be able to show him  something of our customs and life.\"    Edgar was now shown a tent that had been newly erected for his use. The  furniture was simple, consisting only of a handsome Eastern carpet,  which covered the ground, and a pile of rugs for sofa and bed. Hanging  from one of the sticks that supported the tent was a porous jar of  water. When he had hung up his rifle and pistols, powder-horn and  bullet-pouch, its furnishing was complete.    \"Is this all your tribe?\" he asked Sidi, as he came out from his tent.    \"Oh, no! our tribe dwells in a large oasis a hundred miles to the south,  and fifty miles west of Cairo. There are other portions of the tribe  dwelling not far from the same spot, and we can ride five hundred strong  when we go to fight the Berbers of Morocco. But my father is only sheik  of his section. There are generally but six tents left here to keep  possession, and we are often away for months. We find that we can buy  such goods as the tribe requires cheaper at Alexandria than at Cairo,  where, indeed, we do not often go, for ill-blood exists between us and  the authorities there, who ventured on some complaint to send out a  party of Mamelukes against us. We beat them back handsomely, but had to  leave our oasis for a time, as we could not withstand the force they  would be sure to send against us. That was thirty years ago. They filled  up our wells and cut down our palm-trees. The wells were soon cleared  out again, and the palm groves have grown up. They have not interfered  with us again, but even now we care not to visit Cairo, though it may be  that the matter is altogether forgotten there.\"    Edgar remained a fortnight with his new friends, and enjoyed the life  much. He took lessons from Sidi in hurling a lance, and discovered that  it would need a long practice indeed to enable him to do so with the  accuracy shown by the Arabs. He also practised with his rifles and  pistols. When he left he gave a warm invitation to Sidi to come and stay  with him. This, however, the Arab lad declined.    \"I should not be comfortable in your European dwelling,\" he said. \"I  should be miserable, sitting on one of those chairs. Your father is  busy, and so are you; I should be altogether out of my element.\"    \"But I might have said the same thing here, Sidi?\"    \"Oh, no! it is easy to fling off restraint, to throw yourself on the  sand, to ride and shoot and hurl the spear. Those are sports that you  can enjoy as much as I do. I will come over often and see you, but do  not ask me to stay.\"    Edgar saw that it was better not to press the matter, at any rate for  the present. In time, when Sidi became more accustomed to European ways  he might perhaps come to stay, but if he came now it would be a penance  rather than a pleasure. After that time the young Arab rode over  frequently, leaving his camp at daybreak and arriving in time to spend a  long day with Edgar. Sometimes they rode together, sometimes walked  along the sea-shore, and Sidi soon learned to enjoy as much as his  friend a row or a sail on the water, which to him was at first  altogether a novelty. The merchant possessed several boats, which he  used in his business, and a pretty gig which carried a sail, in which he  himself went off to visit ships which brought goods for him. This was at  other times at Edgar's service. He had learned, even before going to  school, to manage it, and it therefore was unnecessary to take anyone  with them.    Sidi at first did not take kindly to an oar. Trained to hard exercise on  horseback and in the sports of the tribe, he had yet a great aversion to  anything like steady labour, and was unable even to understand Edgar's  willingness to exert himself at an oar when he could have had men to row  him about. In time, however, when he had mastered the initial  difficulties of the art, he took to the exercise, and they often spent  the whole day in the boat, either coasting along Aboukir Bay, or, more  often, shooting on the lakes.    The arrival of the British fleet had created quite an excitement in  Alexandria, and the news they brought, that a large French fleet had  left Toulon, carrying many thousands of troops, destined, it was  believed, to operate in Egypt, had caused an intense feeling of dismay  among the British merchants settled there, and a corresponding  exultation among the French.    \"Will the French fleet be "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22245"],[0,"Steve and the Steam Engine (#5)"],[1," to give the waiting employee  a nod of greeting, he did not meet his eye or evince any sign of  recognition, and he sensed that the light that had flashed into the  man's face at sight of him died out as quickly as it had come. The boy  had an uncomfortable realization as he climbed to the seat of the truck  and took his place beside its driver that O'Malley must be rating him as  a snob. No one but a cad would accept a stranger's kindness and then cut  him dead the next time he encountered him. It was better to endure this  misjudgment, however, than to acknowledge a previous acquaintance with  the mechanic and thereby arouse his father's suspicion and curiosity.  Hence, without further parley, he settled himself and in silence the  truck started off.    For some minutes he waited, expecting that when they were well out of  earshot of the family the man at the wheel would turn and with a laugh  make some reference to the adventure of the past week. It certainly must  have amused him to find the great red car again stalled in the same  spot, and what would be more natural than that he should comment on the  coincidence and perhaps make a joke of the circumstance? But to the  boy's chagrin the teamster did no such thing. Instead he kept his eyes  fixed on the road and gave no evidence that he had ever before seen the  lad at his elbow.    Stephen was aghast. It was not possible the workman had forgotten the  happening. He began to feel very uncomfortable. As the landscape slipped  past and the car sped on, the distance to Torrington lessened. Still  there seemed to be no prospect of the stranger at the wheel breaking his  silence. If it had merely been a silence perhaps Steve would not have  minded so much; but there was an implied rebuke in the stillness that  nettled and stung and left him with a consciousness of being ignored by  a superior being.    \"I say!\" he burst out, when he could endure the ignominy of his position  no longer, \"don't you remember me, Mr. O'Malley?\"    The man who guided the car did not turn his head but he nodded.    \"I remember you all right,\" replied he politely. \"I just thought you did  not remember me.\"    \"Oh, I remembered you right away,\" declared Steve eagerly.    \"Did you?\"    There was a subtle irony in the tone that the lad was not clever enough  to detect.    \"Of course.\"    \"Is that so!\" came dryly from O'Malley.    \"Yes, indeed! I remembered you right away,\" Steve stumbled on. \"You are  the man who gave me the gasoline when I was stuck here Wednesday.\"    \"I am.\"    \"I knew you the first minute I saw you,\" repeated Stephen.    \"I did not notice any sign that you did,\" was the terse response.    \"Oh--well--you see, I couldn't very well speak back there,\" explained  Steve with confusion. \"They would all have wanted to know where I--I  mean I would have to--it would just have made a lot of talk,\" concluded  he lamely.    For the first time the elder man, moving his eyes from the ribbon of  gleaming highway, confronted him.    \"So your father did not know you had the car out the other day?\" said  he.    \"N--o.\"    The workman showed no surprise.    \"I guessed as much,\" he remarked. \"But of course you have told him  since.\"    \"Not yet,\" Steve stammered. \"I was going to--honest I was; but things  kept interrupting until it got to be so late that it seemed silly to  rake the matter all up. Besides, I shan't do it again, so what is the  use of jawing about it?\"    He stopped, awaiting a response from the railroad employee; but none  came.    \"Anyhow,\" he argued with rising irritability, \"what good does it do to  discuss things that are over and done with? You can't undo them.\"    The man at the wheel vouchsafed no answer.    \"It is because I forgot to stop for more gas when I went home the other  day that we are in this fix now,\" Steve finally blurted out, finding  relief in brutal confession.    Still the only reply to his monologue was the chugging of the engine.    At last his voice rose to a higher pitch and there was anger in it.    \"I'm talking to you,\" he shouted in exasperation.    \"I am listening.\"    \"Well, why don't you say something?\"    \"What is there to say?\"    \"Why--eh--you could tell me what you think.\"    \"I guess you know that already.\"    Stephen's face turned scarlet.    \"I did intend to tell my father,\" repeated he, instantly on the  defensive. \"Straight goods, I did.\"    The man shrugged his shoulders.    \"It was only that it didn't seem to come right. You know how things go  sometimes.\"    He saw the workman's lip curl.    \"You think I ought to have told.\"    \"Have I said so?\"    \"No, but I know you do think so.\"    \"I wasn't aware I'd expressed any opinion.\"    \"No--but--well--hang it all--you think I am a coward for not making a  clean breast of the whole thing!\" cried Stephen, now thoroughly enraged.    \"What do you think yourself?\" O'Malley suddenly inquired with  disconcerting directness.    \"Oh, I know I've been rotten,\" admitted the boy. \"Still, even now--\" He  paused.    \"You mean that even now it isn't too late?\" put in the truckman, his  face lighting to a smile.    \"N--o; that wasn't exactly what I was going to say,\" began the lad,  resuming his argumentative tone. \"What I mean is that--\"    A swift frown replaced the elder man's smile.    \"Here we are at the garage,\" he broke in. \"They will do whatever you  want them to.\"    He seemed in a hurry and as Stephen could find no excuse for lingering  he climbed reluctantly out of the truck and stood balancing himself on  the curb that edged the sidewalk.    \"I'm much obliged to you for bringing me over,\" he observed awkwardly.    \"That's all right.\"    The man in the brown jeans started his engine.    \"Say, Mr. O'Malley!\" called Stephen desperately.    \"Well?\"    \"You--you--won't tell my father about my taking the car, will you?\" he  pleaded wretchedly.    \"_I_ tell him?\"    Never had he heard so much scorn compressed into three words.    \"You need have no worries,\" declared the man over his shoulder, a  contemptuous sneer curling his lips. \"I confess my own wrong-doing but I  do not tattle the sins of other people. Your father will never be the  wiser about you so far as I am concerned. Whatever you want him to know  you will have to tell him yourself.\"    Baffled, mortified, and stinging with humiliation as if he had been  whipped, Stephen watched him disappear round the bend of the road.    O'Malley despised him, that he knew; and he did not at all relish being  despised.          CHAPTER III    A SECOND CALAMITY      While hunting up the garage and negotiating for gasoline Steve thrust  resolutely from his mind his encounter with O'Malley and the galling  sense of inferiority it carried with it; but once on the highroad again  the smart returned and the sting lingering behind the man's scorn was  not to be allayed. It required every excuse his wounded dignity could  muster to bolster up his pride and make out for himself the plausible  case that had previously comforted him and lulled his conscience to  rest. It was now more impossible than ever for him to make any  confession, he decided; for having denied in his father's presence  O'Malley's acquaintance it would be ridiculous to acknowledge that he  had known the truck driver all along. Of course he could not do that.  Whatever he might have said or done at the time, it was entirely too  late to go back on his conduct now. One event had followed on the heels  of another until to slip out a single stone of the structure he had  built up would topple over the whole house.    If he had spoken in the beginning that would have been quite simple. All  he could do now was to let bygones be bygones and in the pleasure of  to-day forget the mistakes of yesterday. Consoled by this reflection he  managed to recapture such a degree of his self-esteem that by the time  he rejoined the family he was once more holding his head in the air and  smiling with his wonted lightness of heart.    \"We shall get you to Northampton now, daughter, without more delay, I  hope,\" Mrs. Tolman affirmed when the car was again skimming along. \"We  may be a bit behind schedule; nevertheless a late arrival by motor will  be pleasanter than to have made the trip by train.\"    \"I should say so!\" was the fervent ejaculation.    \"Come, come!\" interrupted Mr. Tolman. \"I shall not sit back and allow  you two people to cry down the railroads. They are not perfect, I will  admit, and unquestionably trains do not always go at the hours we wish  they did; a touring car is, perhaps, a more comfortable and luxurious  method of travel, especially in summer. But just as it is an improvement  over the train, so the train was a mighty advance over the stagecoach of  olden days.\"    \"Oh, I don't know, Dad,\" Stephen mused. \"I am not so sure that I should  not have liked stagecoaches better. Think what jolly sport it must have  been to drive all over the country!\"    \"In fine weather, yes--that is, if the roads had been as excellent as  they are now; but you must remember that in the old coaching days  road-building had not reached its present perfection. Traveling by  stage over a rough highway in a conveyance that had few springs was not  so comfortable an undertaking as it is sometimes pictured. Furthermore  you must not forget that it was also perilous, for not only was there  danger from accident on these poorly constructed, unlighted  thoroughfares but there was in addition the menace from highwaymen in  the less populated districts. It took a great while to make a journey of  any length, too, and to sleep in a coach where one was cramped, jolted,  and either none too warm or miserably hot was not an unalloyed delight,  as I am sure you will agree.\"    \"I had not thought of any of those things,\" owned Stephen. \"It just  seemed on the face of it as if it must have been fun to ride on top of  the coach and see the sights as one does from the Fifth Avenue or London  buses.\"    \"Oh,\""]]]
