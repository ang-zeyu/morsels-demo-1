[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2005"],[0,"Piccadilly Jim (#5)"],[1," of a man is your friend, Mr. Smethurst?\"    \"Do you mean Smithers, Miss Ann?\"    \"I knew it was either Smithers or Smethurst. The dog man, I mean.  Is he a man you can trust?\"    \"With my last buck. I've known him since we were kids.\"    \"I don't mean as regards money. I am going to send Ogden to him  for treatment, and I want to know if I can rely on him to help  me.\"    \"For the love of Mike.\"    Jerry Mitchell, after an instant of stunned bewilderment, was  looking at her with worshipping admiration. He had always known  that Miss Ann possessed a mind of no common order, but this, he  felt, was genius. For a moment the magnificence of the idea took  his breath away.    \"Do you mean that you're going to kidnap him, Miss Ann?\"    \"Yes. That is to say, _you_ are--if I can persuade you to do  it for me.\"    \"Sneak him away and send him to Bud Smithers' dog-hospital?\"    \"For treatment. I like Mr. Smithers' methods. I think they would  do Ogden all the good in the world.\"    Jerry was enthusiastic.    \"Why, Bud would make him part-human. But, say, isn't it taking  big chances? Kidnapping's a penitentiary offence.\"    \"This isn't that sort of kidnapping.\"    \"Well, it's mighty like it.\"    \"I don't think you need be afraid of the penitentiary. I can't  see aunt Nesta prosecuting, when it would mean that she would  have to charge us with having sent Ogden to a dogs' hospital. She  likes publicity, but it has to be the right kind of publicity.  No, we do run a risk, but it isn't that one. You run the risk of  losing your job here, and I should certainly be sent to my  grandmother for an indefinite sentence. You've never seen my  grandmother, have you, Jerry? She's the only person in the world  I'm afraid of! She lives miles from anywhere and has family  prayers at seven-thirty sharp every morning. Well, I'm ready to  risk her, if you're ready to risk your job, in such a good cause.  You know you're just as fond of uncle Peter as I am, and Ogden is  worrying him into a breakdown. Surely you won't refuse to help  me, Jerry?\"    Jerry rose and extended a calloused hand.    \"When do we start?\"    Ann shook the hand warmly.    \"Thank you, Jerry. You're a jewel. I envy Maggie. Well, I don't  think we can do anything till they come back from England, as  aunt Nesta is sure to take Ogden with her.\"    \"Who's going to England?\"    \"Uncle Peter and aunt Nesta were talking just now of sailing to  try and persuade a young man named Crocker to come back here.\"    \"Crocker? Jimmy Crocker? Piccadilly Jim?\"    \"Yes. Why, do you know him?\"    \"I used to meet him sometimes when he was working on the  _Chronicle_ here. Looks as if he was cutting a wide swathe in dear  old London. Did you see the paper to-day?\"    \"Yes, that's what made aunt Nesta want to bring him over. Of  course, there isn't the remotest chance that she will be able to  make him come. Why should he come?\"    \"Last time I saw Jimmy Crocker,\" said Jerry, \"it was a couple of  years ago, when I went over to train Eddie Flynn for his go with  Porky Jones at the National. I bumped into him at the N. S. C. He  was a good deal tanked.\"    \"He's always drinking, I believe.\"    \"He took me to supper at some swell joint where they all had the  soup-and-fish on but me. I felt like a dirty deuce in a clean  deck. He used to be a regular fellow, Jimmy Crocker, but from  what you read in the papers it begins to look as if he was  hitting it up too swift. It's always the way with those boys when  you take them off a steady job and let them run around loose with  their jeans full of mazuma.\"    \"That's exactly why I want to do something about Ogden. If he's  allowed to go on as he is at present, he will grow up exactly  like Jimmy Crocker.\"    \"Aw, Jimmy Crocker ain't in Ogden's class,\" protested Jerry.    \"Yes, he is. There's absolutely no difference between them.\"    \"Say! You've got it in for Jim, haven't you, Miss Ann?\" Jerry  looked at her wonderingly. \"What's your kick against him?\"    Ann bit her lip. \"I object to him on principle,\" she said. \"I  don't like his type. . . . Well, I'm glad we've settled this  about Ogden, Jerry. I knew I could rely on you. But I won't let  you do it for nothing. Uncle Peter shall give you something for  it--enough to start that health-farm you talk about so much.  Then you can marry Maggie and live happily ever afterwards.\"    \"Gee! Is the boss in on this, too?\"    \"Not yet. I'm going to tell him now. Hush! There's some one  coming.\"    Mr. Pett wandered in. He was still looking troubled.    \"Oh, Ann--good morning, Mitchell--your aunt has decided to go to  England. I want you to come, too.\"    \"You want me? To help interview Jimmy Crocker?\"    \"No, no. Just to come along and be company on the voyage. You'll  be such a help with Ogden, Ann. You can keep him in order. How  you do it, I don't know. You seem to make another boy of him.\"    Ann stole a glance at Jerry, who answered with an encouraging  grin. Ann was constrained to make her meaning plainer than by the  language of the eye.    \"Would you mind just running away for half a moment, Jerry?\" she  said winningly. \"I want to say something to uncle Peter.\"    \"Sure. Sure.\"    Ann turned to Mr. Pett as the door closed.    \"You'd like somebody to make Ogden a different boy, wouldn't you,  uncle Peter?\"    \"I wish it was possible.\"    \"He's been worrying you a lot lately, hasn't he?\" asked Ann  sympathetically.    \"Yes,\" sighed Mr. Pett.    \"Then that's all right,\" said Ann briskly. \"I was afraid that you  might not approve. But, if you do, I'll go right ahead.\"    Mr. Pett started violently. There was something in Ann's voice  and, as he looked at her, something in her face which made him  fear the worst. Her eyes were flashing with an inspired light of  a highly belligerent nature, and the sun turned the red hair to  which she owed her deplorable want of balance to a mass of flame.  There was something in the air. Mr. Pett sensed it with every  nerve of his apprehensive person. He gazed at Ann, and as he did  so the years seemed to slip from him and he was a boy again,  about to be urged to lawless courses by the superior will of his  boyhood's hero, Hammond Chester. In the boyhood of nearly every  man there is a single outstanding figure, some one youthful  hypnotic Napoleon whose will was law and at whose bidding his  better judgment curled up and died. In Mr. Pett's life Ann's  father had filled this role. He had dominated Mr. Pett at an age  when the mind is most malleable. And now--so true is it that  though Time may blunt our boyish memories the traditions of  boyhood live on in us and an emotional crisis will bring them to  the surface as an explosion brings up the fish that lurk in the  nethermost mud--it was as if he were facing the youthful Hammond  Chester again and being irresistibly impelled to some course of  which he entirely disapproved but which he knew that he was  destined to undertake. He watched Ann as a trapped man might  watch a ticking bomb, bracing himself for the explosion and  knowing that he is helpless. She was Hammond Chester's daughter,  and she spoke to him with the voice of Hammond Chester. She was  her father's child and she was going to start something.    \"I've arranged it all with Jerry,\" said Ann. \"He's going to help  me smuggle Ogden away to that friend of his I told you about who  keeps the dog-hospital: and the friend is going to keep him until  he reforms. Isn't it a perfectly splendid idea?\"    Mr. Pett blanched. The frightfulness of reality had exceeded  anticipation.    \"But, Ann!\"    The words came from him in a strangled bleat. His whole being was  paralysed by a clammy horror. This was beyond the uttermost limit  of his fears. And, to complete the terror of the moment, he knew,  even while he rebelled against the insane lawlessness of her  scheme, that he was going to agree to it, and--worst of all--that  deep, deep down in him there was a feeling toward it which did  not dare to come to the surface but which he knew to be approval.    \"Of course Jerry would do it for nothing,\" said Ann, \"but I  promised him that you would give him something for his trouble.  You can arrange all that yourselves later.\"    \"But, Ann! . . . But, Ann! . . . Suppose your aunt finds out who  did it!\"    \"Well, there will be a tremendous row!\" said Ann composedly.  \"And you will have to assert yourself. It will be a splendid  thing for you. You know you are much too kind to every one, uncle  Peter. I don't think there's any one who would put up with what  you do. Father told me in one of his letters that he used to call  you Patient Pete as a boy.\"    Mr. Pett started. Not for many a day had a nickname which he  considered the most distasteful of all possible nicknames risen  up from its grave to haunt him. Patient Pete! He had thought the  repulsive title buried forever in the same tomb as his dead  youth. Patient Pete! The first faint glimmer of the flame of  rebellion began to burn in his bosom.    \"Patient Pete!\"    \"Patient Pete!\" said Ann inexorably.    \"But, Ann,\"--there was pathos in Mr. Pett's voice--\"I like a  peaceful life.\"    \"You'll never have one if you don't stand up for yourself. You  know quite well that father is right. You do let every one  trample on you. Do you think father would let Ogden worry him and  have his house filled with affected imitation geniuses so that he  couldn't find a room to be alone in?\"    \"But, Ann, your father is different. He likes fusses. I've known  your father contradict a man weighing two hundred pounds out of  sheer exuberance. There's a lot of your father in you, Ann. I've  often noticed it.\"    \"There is! That's why I'm going to make you put your foot down  sooner or later. You're going to turn all these loafers out of  the house. And first of all you're going to help us send Ogden  away to Mr. Smithers.\"    There was a long silence.    \"It's your red hair!\" said Mr. Pett at length, with the air of a  man who has "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20069"],[0,"Caruso and Tetrazzini on the Art of Singing (#5)"],[1,"of vowels and consonants. And the  singer with this voice production usually concentrates her entire  attention on diction.    The cure for this tone emission is, first of all, the cultivation of the  breath prop, then attacking the vowel sound o o in the medium voice,  which requires a low position of the larynx, and exercises on the  ascending scale until the higher notes have been brought down, as it  were, and gain some of the body and support of the lower notes without  losing their quality.    The singer's expression must concern itself chiefly with the play of  emotion around the eyes, eyebrows and forehead. You have no idea how  much expression you can get out of your eyebrows, for instance, until  you study the question and learn by experiment that a complete emotional  scale can be symbolized outwardly in the movements of the eyelids and  eyebrows.    A very drooping eyebrow is expressive of fatigue, either physical or  mental. This lowered eyelid is the aspect we see about us most of the  time, particularly on people past their first youth. As it shows a lack  of interest, it is not a favorite expression of actors and is only  employed where the role makes it necessary.    Increasing anxiety is depicted by slanting the eyebrows obliquely in a  downward line toward the nose.    Concentrated attention draws the eyebrows together over the bridge of  the nose, while furtiveness widens the space again without elevating the  eyebrows.    In the eyebrows alone you can depict mockery, every stage of anxiety or  pain, astonishment, ecstasy, terror, suffering, fury and admiration,  besides all the subtle tones between.    In singing roles of songs it is necessary to practice before the mirror  in order to see that this facial expression is present and that it is  not exaggerated; that the face is not contorted by lines of suffering or  by the lines of mirth.    Another thing the young singer must not forget in making her initial bow  before the public is the question of dress. When singing on the platform  or stage, dress as well as you can. Whenever you face the public have at  least the assurance you are looking your very best; that your gowns hang  well, are well fitted and are of a becoming color.    It is not necessary that they should be gorgeous or expensive, but let  them always be suitable, and for big cities let them be just as  sumptuous as you can afford. At morning concerts in New York, velvets  and hand-painted chiffons are considered good form, while in the  afternoon handsome silk or satin frocks of a very light color are worn  with hats.    If a singer chooses to wear a hat let her be sure that its shape will  not interfere with her voice.    A very large hat, for instance, with a wide brim that comes down over  the face, acts as a sort of blanket to the voice, eating up the sound  and detracting from the beauty of tone, which should go forth into the  audience. It is also likely to shade the singer's features too much and  hide her from view from those sitting in the balconies or galleries. As  a rule, the singer's hat should be small or with a flaring brim, which  does not detract from the tone.    Another word on the subject of corsets. There is no reason in the world  why a singer should not wear corsets, and if singers have a tendency to  grow stout a corset is usually a necessity. A singer's corset should be  especially well fitted around the hips and should be extremely loose  over the diaphragm.    If made in this way it will not interfere in the slightest degree with  the breath.    Now as to diet and the general mode of life. Every singer must take care  of her health. But that does not necessarily mean that she must wrap  herself in cotton batting and lead a sequestered existence. I don't  believe that any person who wants to make a public career can accomplish  it and also indulge in social dissipations. Society must be cut out of  the life of the would-be singer, for the demands made by it on time and  vitality can only be given at a sacrifice to one's art.    The care of the health is an individual matter, and what agrees well  with me would cause others to sicken. I eat the simplest food always,  and naturally, being an Italian, I prefer the food of my native land.  But simple French or German cookery agrees with me quite as well. And I  allow the tempting pastry, the rich and overspiced pate, to pass me by  untouched and console myself with quantities of fruit and fresh  vegetables.    Personally I never wear a collar and have hardened my throat to a  considerable extent by wearing slightly cutout gowns always in the  house, and even when I wear furs I do not have them closely drawn around  the neck. I try to keep myself at an even bodily temperature, and fresh  air has been my most potent remedy at all times when I have been  indisposed.          Appreciative Attitude and Critical Attitude      There is nothing so beneficial to the young artist as the kindly and  just criticism of a person who knows and nothing so stimulating as his  praise.    Among my most priceless possessions I treasure the words of  encouragement given me by Patti and Sembrich, those wonderful artists,  when I was beginning my career.    Mme. Patti is a splendid example of the many sidedness necessary to  artistic perfection. Her wonderful voice was always supplemented by  complete knowledge of the art of singing, and her mastery of languages  and of different fields of art made her not only a great artist, but a  most interesting woman.    To hear an artist of this kind is one of the most profitable parts of a  musical education.    But there are two ways of listening to a singer. There is the  appreciative way, and there is the entirely critical. The beginner  usually tries to show her knowledge by her intensely critical attitude.    The older you become in your art the more readily you will be able to  appreciate and learn from the singers you hear on the opera or concert  stage.    The greatest and the humblest singer can teach you something. But to  learn you must be in a receptive attitude.    The public has no real conception of what an amount of intelligent work  besides talent and art is necessary to achieve the results which it sees  or hears. Only those whose lives are devoted to the same ideals can  understand the struggles of other artists, and it is for that reason  that appreciation and not condemnation should be on the tongues of those  who themselves have studied.    The artist may demand the greatest things of herself, and what may be  good enough for others is not good enough for her. As the poet says,  \"Art is long,\" though life may be short, and singing is one of the most  fleeting of all arts, since once the note is uttered it leaves only a  memory in the hearer's mind and since so many beautiful voices, for one  reason or other, go to pieces long before their time.    If the singer's health is good the voice should end only with life  itself, provided, of course, it has been used with understanding and  with art.    In performing before the public one should be governed by the tastes of  the public, not by one's own tastes. Just as the comedian usually wishes  to play Hamlet and the man of tragic mien thinks he could be a comedy  star, the singer who could make a fortune at interpreting chansonnettes  usually wishes to sing operatic roles, and the singer with a deep and  heavy voice is longing to inflict baby songs on a long suffering public.    It is easy enough to find out what the public wishes to hear, and,  though one should always be enlarging one's repertory, it is not a bad  idea to stick to that field for which one is particularly fitted vocally  and physically.    In studying a role after one has mastered the technical difficulties one  should try to steep one's personality into that of the character one is  to portray, and for that reason all study, no matter what it is, and  reading of all kinds help one in developing a part.    The great Italian tragedienne, Duse, told me that one of her greatest  pleasures was to wander about the streets incognito watching the types  of people, following them round, observing them in their daily lives and  remembering all the small details of action, gesture or expression which  she could some day embody into a role.    The more one sees and studies people with sympathy, the more points one  gets for the study of life which is embodied in the art one gives forth.  But it is sympathy with one's fellow beings and kindly observation  which help one here, never the critical attitude.    An artist can only afford to be coldly critical toward his own work and  not toward the work of others.    Recently a young woman who started her vocal career as a contralto has  sung the most difficult of Wagnerian soprano parts. Her high notes, it  is true, were not the high notes of a natural soprano voice, but the  care and perfection with which each high note was attacked were worthy  of closest attention and admiration and defied criticism.    Hearing the smaller singers, the beginners who are still struggling with  their art, should awaken in the heart of the intelligent listener not  contemptuous criticism, but should be one means of realizing one's own  vocal defects and the possible ways of overcoming them.    There are bad singing teachers, of course, but often the pupils are  worse and will not listen to advice. The large and shrieking voice  usually belongs to this type of pupil, for it is easier to force the  voice when the temperament is robust and the vocal cords equally strong  than it is to learn gently and quietly the correct and natural position  in voice placement, and it is easier to make a noise as best you can  than to use intelligently the different resonance cavities for the  blending of the perfect tone.    Another fault severely criticised in the youthful singer is a lack of  correct pronunciation or diction. It is"]]]
