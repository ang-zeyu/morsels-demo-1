But as they did not acquire this hope save through  Christ, the further they were removed from Christ in point of time,  the further they were from obtaining what they hoped for. Hence the  Apostle says (Heb. 11:13): \"All these died according to faith, not  having received the promises, but beholding them afar off.\" Now the  further off a thing is the less distinctly is it seen; wherefore  those who were nigh to Christ's advent had a more distinct knowledge  of the good things to be hoped for.    Reply Obj. 2: Progress in knowledge occurs in two ways. First, on the  part of the teacher, be he one or many, who makes progress in  knowledge as time goes on: and this is the kind of progress that  takes place in sciences devised by man. Secondly, on the part of the  learner; thus the master, who has perfect knowledge of the art, does  not deliver it all at once to his disciple from the very outset, for  he would not be able to take it all in, but he condescends to the  disciple's capacity and instructs him little by little. It is in this  way that men made progress in the knowledge of faith as time went on.  Hence the Apostle (Gal. 3:24) compares the state of the Old Testament  to childhood.    Reply Obj. 3: Two causes are requisite before actual generation can  take place, an agent, namely, and matter. In the order of the active  cause, the more perfect is naturally first; and in this way nature  makes a beginning with perfect things, since the imperfect is not  brought to perfection, except by something perfect already in  existence. On the other hand, in the order of the material cause, the  imperfect comes first, and in this way nature proceeds from the  imperfect to the perfect. Now in the manifestation of faith, God is  the active cause, having perfect knowledge from all eternity; while  man is likened to matter in receiving the influx of God's action.  Hence, among men, the knowledge of faith had to proceed from  imperfection to perfection; and, although some men have been after  the manner of active causes, through being doctors of faith,  nevertheless the manifestation of the Spirit is given to such men for  the common good, according to 1 Cor. 12:7; so that the knowledge of  faith was imparted to the Fathers who were instructors in the faith,  so far as was necessary at the time for the instruction of the  people, either openly or in figures.    Reply Obj. 4: The ultimate consummation of grace was effected by  Christ, wherefore the time of His coming is called the \"time of  fulness [*Vulg.: 'fulness of time']\" (Gal. 4:4). Hence those who were  nearest to Christ, whether before, like John the Baptist, or after,  like the apostles, had a fuller knowledge of the mysteries of faith;  for even with regard to man's state we find that the perfection of  manhood comes in youth, and that a man's state is all the more  perfect, whether before or after, the nearer it is to the time of his  youth.  _______________________    EIGHTH ARTICLE [II-II, Q. 1, Art. 8]    Whether the Articles of Faith Are Suitably Formulated?    Objection 1: It would seem that the articles of faith are unsuitably  formulated. For those things, which can be known by demonstration, do  not belong to faith as to an object of belief for all, as stated above  (A. 5). Now it can be known by demonstration that there is one God;  hence the Philosopher proves this (Metaph. xii, text. 52) and many  other philosophers demonstrated the same truth. Therefore that \"there  is one God\" should not be set down as an article of faith.    Obj. 2: Further, just as it is necessary to faith that we should  believe God to be almighty, so is it too that we should believe Him to  be \"all-knowing\" and \"provident for all,\" about both of which points  some have erred. Therefore, among the articles of faith, mention  should have been made of God's wisdom and providence, even as of His  omnipotence.    Obj. 3: Further, to know the Father is the same things as to know  the Son, according to John 14:9: \"He that seeth Me, seeth the Father  also.\" Therefore there ought to be but one article about the Father  and Son, and, for the same reason, about the Holy Ghost.    Obj. 4: Further, the Person of the Father is no less than the  Person of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Now there are several  articles about the Person of the Holy Ghost, and likewise about the  Person of the Son. Therefore there should be several articles about  the Person of the Father.    Obj. 5: Further, just as certain things are said by appropriation, of  the Person of the Father and of the Person of the Holy Ghost, so too  is something appropriated to the Person of the Son, in respect of His  Godhead. Now, among the articles of faith, a place is given to a work  appropriated to the Father, viz. the creation, and likewise, a work  appropriated to the Holy Ghost, viz. that \"He spoke by the prophets.\"  Therefore the articles of faith should contain some work appropriated  to the Son in respect of His Godhead.    Obj. 6: Further, the sacrament of the Eucharist presents a special  difficulty over and above the other articles. Therefore it should  have been mentioned in a special article: and consequently it seems  that there is not a sufficient number of articles.    On the contrary stands the authority of the Church who formulates the  articles thus.    _I answer that,_ As stated above (AA. 4, 6), to faith those things in  themselves belong, the sight of which we shall enjoy in eternal life,  and by which we are brought to eternal life. Now two things are  proposed to us to be seen in eternal life: viz. the secret of the  Godhead, to see which is to possess happiness; and the mystery of  Christ's Incarnation, \"by Whom we have access\" to the glory of the  sons of God, according to Rom. 5:2. Hence it is written (John 17:3):  \"This is eternal life: that they may know Thee, the . . . true God,  and Jesus Christ Whom Thou hast sent.\" Wherefore the first  distinction in matters of faith is that some concern the majesty of  the Godhead, while others pertain to the mystery of Christ's human  nature, which is the \"mystery of godliness\" (1 Tim. 3:16).    Now with regard to the majesty of the Godhead, three things are  proposed to our belief: first, the unity of the Godhead, to which the  first article refers; secondly, the trinity of the Persons, to which  three articles refer, corresponding to the three Persons; and  thirdly, the works proper to the Godhead, the first of which refers  to the order of nature, in relation to which the article about the  creation is proposed to us; the second refers to the order of grace,  in relation to which all matters concerning the sanctification of man  are included in one article; while the third refers to the order of  glory, and in relation to this another article is proposed to us  concerning the resurrection of the dead and life everlasting. Thus  there are seven articles referring to the Godhead.    In like manner, with regard to Christ's human nature, there are seven  articles, the first of which refers to Christ's incarnation or  conception; the second, to His virginal birth; the third, to His  Passion, death and burial; the fourth, to His descent into hell; the  fifth, to His resurrection; the sixth, to His ascension; the seventh,  to His coming for the judgment, so that in all there are fourteen  articles.    Some, however, distinguish twelve articles, six pertaining to the  Godhead, and six to the humanity. For they include in one article the  three about the three Persons; because we have one knowledge of the  three Persons: while they divide the article referring to the work of  glorification into two, viz. the resurrection of the body, and the  glory of the soul. Likewise they unite the conception and nativity  into one article.    Reply Obj. 1: By faith we hold many truths about God, which the  philosophers were unable to discover by natural reason, for instance  His providence and omnipotence, and that He alone is to be worshiped,  all of which are contained in the one article of the unity of God.    Reply Obj. 2: The very name of the Godhead implies a kind of watching  over things, as stated in the First Part (Q. 13, A. 8). Now in beings  having an intellect, power does not work save by the will and  knowledge. Hence God's omnipotence includes, in a way, universal  knowledge and providence. For He would not be able to do all He wills  in things here below, unless He knew them, and exercised His  providence over them.    Reply Obj. 3: We have but one knowledge of the Father, Son, and Holy  Ghost, as to the unity of the Essence, to which the first article  refers: but, as to the distinction of the Persons, which is by the  relations of origin, knowledge of the Father does indeed, in a way,  include knowledge of the Son, for He would not be Father, had He not  a Son; the bond whereof being the Holy Ghost. From this point of  view, there was a sufficient motive for those who referred one  article to the three Persons. Since, however, with regard to each  Person, certain points have to be observed, about which some happen  to fall into error, looking at it in this way, we may distinguish  three articles about the three Persons. For Arius believed in the  omnipotence and eternity of the Father, but did not believe the Son  to be co-equal and consubstantial with the Father; hence the need for  an article about the Person of the Son in order to settle this point.  In like manner it was necessary to appoint a third article about the  Person of the Holy Ghost, against Macedonius. In the same way"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18757"],[0,"Prince Henry the Navigator, the Hero of Portugal and of Modern Discovery, (#5)"],[1,"igners; but these are the only ones that  have survived from a much larger number.]    This earlier and discredited map avoided all the more serious  perversions of Ptolemy. Africa was cut off at the limit of actual  knowledge, about Cape Non on the west and Cape Guardafui on the east;  and the \"Cinnamon-bearing Coast,\" between these points, was fringed by  the Mountains of AEthiopia, where the Nile rose. This was the theory  which revived on the decline of the Ptolemaic, and which encouraged the  Portuguese sailors with hopes of a quick approach to India round Africa,  as the great eastern bend of the Guinea coast seemed to suggest.  Further, on this pre-Ptolemaic map the Southern Ocean was left untouched  by a supposed Southern Continent, and except for an undue shrinkage of  the Old World in general as an island in the midst of the vast  surrounding ocean, a reliable description of Western Asia and Central  Europe and North Africa was in the hands of the learned world two  hundred years before Christ.    It is true that Strabo's China is cramped and cut short; that his Ceylon  (Taprobane) is even larger than Ptolemy's; that Ireland (Ierne) appears  to the _north_ of Britain; and that the Caspian joins the North Sea by a  long and narrow channel; but the true shape of India, of the Persian  Gulf and the Euxine, of the Sea of Azov and the Mediterranean, is marked  rightly enough in general outline. This earlier chart has not the  elaborate completeness of Ptolemy's, but it is free from his enormous  errors, and it has all the advantage of science, however imperfect, over  brilliant guessing.    Of course, even in Ptolemy, this guess-work pure and simple only comes  in at intervals and does not so much affect the central and, for his  day, far more important tracts of the Old World, but we have yet to see  how, in the mediaeval period and under Arabic imagination, all geography  seemed likely to become an exercise of fancy.    The chief Greek descriptions of the world, we must clearly remember,  were before the mediaeval workers, Christian and Moslem, from the first;  these men took their choice, and the point is that they, and specially  the Arabs, chose with rare exceptions the last of these, the Ptolemaic  system, because it was the more ambitious, symmetrical, and pretty.    Let us trace for a moment the gradual development of this geographical  mythology.    Starting with the notion of the world as a disc, or a ball, the centre  of the universe, round which moved six celestial circles, of the  Meridian, the Equator, the Ecliptic, the two Tropics, and the Horizon,  the Arab philosophers on the side of the earth's surface worked out a  doctrine of a Cupola or Summit of the world, and on the side of the  heavens a pseudo-science of the Anoua or Settings of the Constellations,  connected with the twelve Pillars of the Zodiac and the twenty-eight  Mansions of the Moon.    With Arabic astrology we are not here concerned; it is only worth noting  in this connection as the possible source of early Christian knowledge  of the Southern Cross and other stars famous in the story of  exploration, such as Dante shows in the first canto of his _Purgatorio_.  But the geographical doctrines of Islam, compounded from the Hebrew  Pentateuch and the theoretical parts of Ptolemy, had a more immediate  and reactionary effect on knowledge. The symmetrical Greek divisions of  land into seven zones or climates; and of the world's surface,[10] into  three parts water and one part _terra firma_; the Indian fourfold  arrangement of \"Romeland\" and the East; the similar fourfold Chinese  partition of China, India, Persia, and Tartary: all these reappeared  confusedly in Arabic geography. From India and the Sanscrit \"Lanka,\"  they seem to have got their first start on the myth of Odjein, Aryn, or  Arim, \"the World's Summit\"; from Ptolemy the sacred number of 360  degrees of longitude was certainly derived, beautifully corresponding to  the days of the year, and neatly divided into 180 of land or habitable  earth and 180 of sea, or unharvested desert. With the seven climates  they made correspond the great Empires of the world--chief among which  they reckoned the Caliphate (or Bagdad), China, Rome, Turkestan, and  India.    [Footnote 10: In which the habitable quarter of the world, situated  mainly in the Northern Hemisphere, was just about twice as long as it  was broad.]    The sacred city of Odjein had been the centre of most of the earlier  Oriental systems; in the Arabic form of Arim (\"The Cupola of the  Earth\"), it became the fixed point round which circled mediaeval theories  of the world's shape. \"Somewhere in the Indian Ocean between Comorin and  Madagascar,\" became the compromise when the mountain could not be found  off any of the known coast-lines; it was mixed up with notions of the  Roc, and the Moon Mountains in Africa, of the Magnet Island and of the  Eastern Kingdom made out of one vast pearl; and even in Roger Bacon it  serves as an algebraic sign for a mathematical centre of the world.    The enlargement of knowledge, though forcing upon Arabic science a  conviction of Ptolemy's mistake in over-extending the limits of the  world known to him, only led to the invention of a scholastic  distinction between the real and the traditional East and West, while  the confusion was made perfect by the travestied history always so  popular among Orientals. The \"Gades of Alexander and Hercules,\" the  farthest points east and west, were named after the mythical conquests  of the real Iskander and the mythical hero of Greeks and Phoenicians.  Arim in the middle, with the pillars of Hercules and Alexander, and the  north and south poles at equal distance from it--the centre and the four  corners of the world as neatly fixed as geometry could define--this was  the map, first of the Arabs, and then of their Christian scholars.    To form any idea of the complete spell thus cast over thought both in  Islam and Christendom, we may look at the words of European scholars of  the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, living far from Islam, long after  its intellectual glory had begun to decay, and at a time when Christian  scholastic philosophy had reached an independent position. Gerard of  Cremona and Adelard of Bath (the translator of the great Arabic  geographer, Mohammed Al-Kharizmy) in the twelfth century, Roger Bacon  and Albertus Magnus in the later thirteenth, are all as clear about  their geographical postulates as about their theological or ethical  rules. And what concerns us here is that they exactly reflect the mind  of the Arabic science or pseudo-science of the time just preceding, so  that their words may represent to us the state of Mohammedan thought  between the eighth and twelfth centuries, between the writers at the  Court of Caliph Almamoun (813-833) and Edrisi at the Court of King Roger  of Sicily (1150).    (1.) _Adelard_, summarising Mohammed Al-Kharizmy with the results of his  Paris education, tells us of the Arabic \"Examination of planets and of  time, starting from the centre of the world, called _Arim_, from which  place to the four ends of the earth the distance is equal, viz., ninety  degrees, answering to the fourth part of the world's circumference. It  is tedious and unending to attempt to place all the countries of the  world and to fix all the marks of time. So the meridian is taken as the  measure of the latter and _Arim_ of the former, and from this  starting-point it is not hard to fix other countries.\" \"Arim,\" he  concludes, \"is under the equator, at the point where there is no  latitude,\" and he plainly implies that there were then existing among  the Arabs tables calculating all the chief places of every country from  the meridian of _Arim_.    (2.) _Gerard_ of Cremona, who, though for some time a resident at  Toledo, is essentially an Italian, tells us about the \"Middle of the  World,\" from which longitudes were calculated, \"called Arim,\" and \"said  to be in India,\" whose longitude from west to east or from east to west  is ninety degrees.    In his _Theory of the Planets_ Gerard tells us still more wonderful  things. Arim was a geographical centre known and used by Hermes  Trismegistus and by Ptolemy, as well as by the great Arab geographers;  Alexander of Macedon marched just as far to the east of Arim as Hercules  to the west; both reached the encircling ocean, and accordingly \"Arim  is equidistant from both the Gades, 90 degrees; likewise from each pole,  north and south, the same, 90 degrees.\" This all recurs in the tables of  Alphonso the Wise of Castille about A.D. 1260, and two of the greatest  of mediaeval thinkers, Albert and Roger Bacon, reproduced the essential  points of this doctrine, its false symmetry, and its balance of the true  and the traditional, with variations of their own.    (3.) _Albert the Great_, Albertus Magnus, second only to Aquinas among  the Continental Schoolmen, in his _View of Astronomy_, repeats Adelard  upon the question of Arim, \"where there is no latitude,\" while (4)  _Roger Bacon_ discusses not only the true and the traditional East and  West, but even a twofold Arim, one \"under the solstice, the other under  the equinoctial zone.\" Arim he finds not to be in the centre of the real  world, but only of the traditional. In another passage of the _Opus  Majus_, Bacon, our first English worker in the exact sciences, allows  the world-summit not to be exactly 90 degrees from the east, although so  placed by mathematicians. Yet there is no contradiction, he urges,  because the men of theory are \"speaking of the habitable world known to  them, according to the true understanding of latitude and longitude,\"  and this \"true understanding\" is \"not as great as has been realised in  travel by Pliny and others.\" \"The longitude of the habitable world is  more than half of the whole circuit.\" This, reproduced in the _Imago  Mundi_ of Cardinal Peter Ailly (1410), fell into "]]]
