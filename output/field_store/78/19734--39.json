Marusia returned home sadder    than ever. The night went by; next morning, when she awoke,    her mother lay dead! She cried all day long; but when the    sun set, and it grew dark around, Marusia became afraid of    being left alone; so she went to her companions.      \"Why, whatever's the matter with you? you're clean out of    countenance!\"[21] say the girls.      \"How am I likely to be cheerful? Yesterday my father    died, and to-day my mother.\"      \"Poor thing! Poor unhappy girl!\" they all exclaim sympathizingly.      Well, the time came to say good-bye. \"See me off, Marusia,\"    says the Fiend. So she went out to see him off.      \"Tell me; were you in the church?\"      \"No.\"      \"And saw what I was doing?\"      \"No.\"      \"Very well! To-morrow evening you will die yourself!\"      Marusia spent the night with her friends; in the morning    she got up and considered what she should do. She bethought    herself that she had a grandmother--an old, very old woman,    who had become blind from length of years. \"Suppose I go    and ask her advice,\" she said, and then went off to her grandmother's.      \"Good-day, granny!\" says she.      \"Good-day, granddaughter! What news is there with you?    How are your father and mother?\"      \"They are dead, granny,\" replied the girl, and then told    her all that had happened.      The old woman listened, and said:--      \"Oh dear me! my poor unhappy child! Go quickly to the    priest, and ask him this favor--that if you die, your body shall    not be taken out of the house through the doorway, but that the    ground shall be dug away from under the threshold, and that    you shall be dragged out through that opening. And also beg    that you may be buried at a crossway, at a spot where four    roads meet.\"      Marusia went to the priest, wept bitterly, and made him promise    to do everything according to her grandmother's instructions.    Then she returned home, bought a coffin, lay down in it,    and straightway expired.      Well, they told the priest, and he buried, first her father and    mother, and then Marusia herself. Her body was passed underneath    the threshold and buried at a crossway.      Soon afterwards a seigneur's son happened to drive past    Marusia's grave. On that grave he saw growing a wondrous    flower, such a one as he had never seen before. Said the    young seigneur to his servant:--      \"Go and pluck up that flower by the roots. We'll take    it home and put it in a flower-pot. Perhaps it will blossom    there.\"      Well, they dug up the flower, took it home, put it in a glazed    flower-pot, and set it in a window. The flower began to grow    larger and more beautiful. One night the servant hadn't gone    to sleep somehow, and he happened to be looking at the window,    when he saw a wondrous thing take place. All of a sudden the    flower began to tremble, then it fell from its stem to the ground,    and turned into a lovely maiden. The flower was beautiful, but    the maiden was more beautiful still. She wandered from room    to room, got herself various things to eat and drink, ate and    drank, then stamped upon the ground and became a flower    as before, mounted to the window, and resumed her place upon    the stem. Next day the servant told the young seigneur of the    wonders which he had seen during the night.      \"Ah, brother!\" said the youth, \"why didn't you wake me?    To-night we'll both keep watch together.\"      The night came; they slept not, but watched. Exactly at    twelve o'clock the blossom began to shake, flew from place to    place, and then fell to the ground, and the beautiful maiden    appeared, got herself things to eat and drink, and sat down to    supper. The young seigneur rushed forward and seized her by    her white hands. Impossible was it for him sufficiently to look    at her, to gaze on her beauty!      Next morning he said to his father and mother, \"Please    allow me to get married. I've found myself a bride.\"      His parents gave their consent. As for Marusia, she said:      \"Only on this condition will I marry you--that for four years    I need not go to church.\"      \"Very good,\" said he.      Well, they were married, and they lived together one year,    two years, and had a son. But one day they had visitors at    their house, who enjoyed themselves, and drank, and began    bragging about their wives. This one's wife was handsome;    that one's was handsomer still.      \"You may say what you like,\" says the host, \"but a handsomer    wife than mine does not exist in the whole world!\"      \"Handsome, yes!\" reply the guests, \"but a heathen.\"      \"How so?\"      \"Why, she never goes to church.\"      Her husband found these observations distasteful. He    waited till Sunday, and then told his wife to get dressed for    church.      \"I don't care what you may say,\" says he. \"Go and get    ready directly.\"      Well, they got ready, and went to church. The husband    went in--didn't see anything particular. But when she looked    round--there was the Fiend sitting at a window.      \"Ha! here you are, at last!\" he cried. \"Remember old    times. Were you in the church that night?\"      \"No.\"      \"And did you see what I was doing there?\"      \"No.\"      \"Very well! To-morrow both your husband and your son will    die.\"      Marusia rushed straight out of the church and away to her    grandmother. The old woman gave her two phials, the one full    of holy water, the other of the water of life, and told her what    she was to do. Next day both Marusia's husband and her son    died. Then the Fiend came flying to her and asked:--      \"Tell me; were you in the church?\"      \"I was.\"      \"And did you see what I was doing?\"      \"You were eating a corpse.\"      She spoke, and splashed the holy water over him; in a    moment he turned into mere dust and ashes, which blew to the    winds. Afterwards she sprinkled her husband and her boy with    the water of life: straightway they revived. And from that    time forward they knew neither sorrow nor separation, but they    all lived together long and happily.[22]    Another lively sketch of a peasant's love-making is given in the  introduction to the story of \"Ivan the widow's son and Grisha.\"[23]  The tale is one of magic and enchantment, of living clouds and  seven-headed snakes; but the opening is a little piece of still-life  very quaintly portrayed. A certain villager, named Trofim, having been  unable to find a wife, his Aunt Melania comes to his aid, promising to  procure him an interview with a widow who has been left well provided  for, and whose personal appearance is attractive--\"real blood and  milk! When she's got on her holiday clothes, she's as fine as a  peacock!\" Trofim grovels with gratitude at his aunt's feet. \"My own  dear auntie, Melania Prokhorovna, get me married for heaven's sake!  I'll buy you an embroidered kerchief in return, the very best in the  whole market.\" The widow comes to pay Melania a visit, and is induced  to believe, on the evidence of beans (frequently used for the purpose  of divination), that her destined husband is close at hand. At this  propitious moment Trofim appears. Melania makes a little speech to the  young couple, ending her recommendation to get married with the  words:--    \"I can see well enough by the bridegroom's eyes that the bride is to  his taste, only I don't know what the bride thinks about taking him.\"    \"I don't mind!\" says the widow. \"Well, then, glory be to God! Now,  stand up, we'll say a prayer before the Holy Pictures; then give each  other a kiss, and go in Heaven's name and get married at once!\" And so  the question is settled.    From a courtship and a marriage in peasant life we may turn to a death  and a burial. There are frequent allusions in the Skazkas to these  gloomy subjects, with reference to which we will quote two stories,  the one pathetic, the other (unintentionally) grotesque. Neither of  them bears any title in the original, but we may style the first--        THE DEAD MOTHER.[24]      In a certain village there lived a husband and wife--lived happily,    lovingly, peaceably. All their neighbors envied them; the    sight of them gave pleasure to honest folks. Well, the mistress    bore a son, but directly after it was born she died.    The poor moujik moaned and wept. Above all he was in despair    about the babe. How was he to nourish it now? how to    bring it up without its mother? He did what was best, and    hired an old woman to look after it. Only here was a wonder!    all day long the babe would take no food, and did nothing but    cry; there was no soothing it anyhow. But during (a great    part of) the night one could fancy it wasn't there at all, so silently    and peacefully did it sleep.      \"What's the meaning of this?\" thinks the old woman; \"suppose    I keep awake to-night; may be I shall find out.\"      Well, just at midnight she heard some one quietly open the    door and go up to the cradle. The babe became still, just as if    it was being suckled.      The next night the same thing took place, and the third    night, too. Then she told the moujik about it. He called his    kinsfolk together, and held counsel with them. They determined    on this; to keep awake on a certain night, and to spy out    who it was that came to suckle the babe. So at eventide they    all lay down on the floor, and beside them they set a lighted    taper hidden in an earthen pot.      At midnight the cottage door opened. Some one stepped    up to the cradle. The babe became still. At that moment one    of the kinsfolk suddenly brought out the light. They looked,    and saw the dead mother, in the very same clothes in which    she had been buried, on her knees besides the cradle, over    which she bent as she suckled the babe at her dead breast.      The moment the light shone in the cottage she stood up,    gazed sadly on her little "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22381"],[0,"Myths and Legends of Ancient Greece and Rome (#5)"],[1,"of beings, being as  strong and powerful as those of the Silver Age were weak and enervated.  Everything which surrounded them was of brass; their arms, their tools,  their dwellings, and all that they made. Their characters seem to have  resembled the metal in which they delighted; their minds and hearts were  hard, obdurate, and cruel. They led a life of strife and contention,  introduced into the world, which had hitherto known nothing but peace and  tranquillity, the scourge of war, and were in fact only happy when fighting  and quarrelling with each other. Hitherto Themis, the goddess of Justice,  had been living among mankind, but becoming disheartened at their evil  doings, she abandoned the earth, and winged her flight back to heaven. At  last the gods became so tired of their evil deeds and continual  dissensions, that they removed them from the face of the earth, and sent  them down to Hades to share the fate of their predecessors.    We now come to the men of the Iron Age. The earth, no longer teeming with  fruitfulness, only yielded her increase after much toil and labour. The  goddess of Justice having abandoned mankind, no influence remained  sufficiently powerful to preserve them from every kind of wickedness and  sin. This condition grew worse as time went on, until at last Zeus in his  anger let loose the water-courses from above, and drowned every {24}  individual of this evil race, except Deucalion and Pyrrha.    The theory of Hesiod,[8] the oldest of all the Greek poets, was that the  Titan Prometheus, the son of Iapetus, had formed man out of clay, and that  Athene had breathed a soul into him. Full of love for the beings he had  called into existence, Prometheus determined to elevate their minds and  improve their condition in every way; he therefore taught them astronomy,  mathematics, the alphabet, how to cure diseases, and the art of divination.  He created this race in such great numbers that the gods began to see the  necessity of instituting certain fixed laws with regard to the sacrifices  due to them, and the worship to which they considered themselves entitled  from mankind in return for the protection which they accorded them. An  assembly was therefore convened at Mecone in order to settle these points.  It was decided that Prometheus, as the advocate of man, should slay an ox,  which should be divided into two equal parts, and that the gods should  select one portion which should henceforth, in all future sacrifices, be  set apart for them. Prometheus so divided the ox that one part consisted of  the bones (which formed of course the least valuable portion of the  animal), artfully concealed by the white fat; whilst the other contained  all the edible parts, which he covered with the skin, and on the top of all  he laid the stomach.    Zeus, pretending to be deceived, chose the heap of bones, but he saw  through the stratagem, and was so angry at the deception practised on him  by Prometheus that he avenged himself by refusing to mortals the gift of  fire. {25} Prometheus, however, resolved to brave the anger of the great  ruler of Olympus, and to obtain from heaven the vital spark so necessary  for the further progress and comfort of the human race. He accordingly  contrived to steal some sparks from the chariot of the sun, which he  conveyed to earth hidden in a hollow tube. Furious at being again  outwitted, Zeus determined to be revenged first on mankind, and then on  Prometheus. To punish the former he commanded Hephaestus (Vulcan) to mould a  beautiful woman out of clay, and determined that through her  instrumentality trouble and misery should be brought into the world.    The gods were so charmed with the graceful and artistic creation of  Hephaestus, that they all determined to endow her with some special gift.  Hermes (Mercury) bestowed on her a smooth persuasive tongue, Aphrodite gave  her beauty and the art of pleasing; the Graces made her fascinating, and  Athene (Minerva) gifted her with the possession of feminine  accomplishments. She was called Pandora, which means all-gifted, having  received every attribute necessary to make her charming and irresistible.  Thus beautifully formed and endowed, this exquisite creature, attired by  the Graces, and crowned with flowers by the Seasons, was conducted to the  house of Epimetheus[9] by Hermes the messenger of the gods. Now Epimetheus  had been warned by his brother not to accept any gift whatever from the  gods; but he was so fascinated by the beautiful being who suddenly appeared  before him, that he welcomed her to his home, and made her his wife. It was  not long, however, before he had cause to regret his weakness.    He had in his possession a jar of rare workmanship, containing all the  blessings reserved by the gods for mankind, which he had been expressly  forbidden to open. But woman's proverbial curiosity could not withstand so  great a temptation, and Pandora determined to solve the mystery at any  cost. Watching her opportunity she raised the lid, and immediately all the  blessings which {26} the gods had thus reserved for mankind took wing and  flew away. But all was not lost. Just as Hope (which lay at the bottom) was  about to escape, Pandora hastily closed the lid of the jar, and thus  preserved to man that never-failing solace which helps him to bear with  courage the many ills which assail him.[10]    Having punished mankind, Zeus determined to execute vengeance on  Prometheus. He accordingly chained him to a rock in Mount Caucasus, and  sent an eagle every day to gnaw away his liver, which grew again every  night ready for fresh torments. For thirty years Prometheus endured this  fearful punishment; but at length Zeus relented, and permitted his son  Heracles (Hercules) to kill the eagle, and the sufferer was released.           *       *       *       *       *    THIRD DYNASTY--OLYMPIAN DIVINITIES.    ZEUS[11] (JUPITER).    Zeus, the great presiding deity of the universe, the ruler of heaven and  earth, was regarded by the Greeks, first, as the god of all aerial  phenomena; secondly, as the personification of the laws of nature; thirdly,  as lord of state-life; and fourthly, as the father of gods and men.    As the god of aerial phenomena he could, by shaking his aegis,[12] produce  storms, tempests, and intense darkness. At his command the mighty thunder  rolls, the lightning flashes, and the clouds open and pour forth their  refreshing streams to fructify the earth.    As the personification of the operations of nature, he represents those  grand laws of unchanging and harmonious order, by which not only the  physical but also {27} the moral world is governed. Hence he is the god of  regulated time as marked by the changing seasons, and by the regular  succession of day and night, in contradistinction to his father Cronus, who  represents time absolutely, _i.e._ eternity.    As the lord of state-life, he is the founder of kingly power, the upholder  of all institutions connected with the state, and the special friend and  patron of princes, whom he guards and assists with his advice and counsel.  He protects the assembly of the people, and, in fact, watches over the  welfare of the whole community.    As the father of the gods, Zeus sees that each deity performs his or her  individual duty, punishes their misdeeds, settles their disputes, and acts  towards them on all occasions as their all-knowing counsellor and mighty  friend.    As the father of men, he takes a paternal interest in the actions and  well-being of mortals. He watches over them with tender solicitude,  rewarding truth, charity, and uprightness, but severely punishing perjury,  cruelty, and want of hospitality. Even the poorest and most forlorn  wanderer finds in him a powerful advocate, for he, by a wise and merciful  dispensation, ordains that the mighty ones of the earth should succour  their distressed and needy brethren.    The Greeks believed that the home of this their mighty and all-powerful  deity was on the top of Mount Olympus, that high and lofty mountain between  Thessaly and Macedon, whose summit, wrapt in clouds and mist, was hidden  from mortal view. It was supposed that this mysterious region, which even a  bird could not reach, extended beyond the clouds right into Aether, the  realm of the immortal gods. The poets describe this ethereal atmosphere as  bright, glistening, and refreshing, exercising a peculiar, gladdening  influence over the minds and hearts of those privileged beings permitted to  share its delights. Here youth never ages, and the passing years leave no  traces on its favoured inhabitants. On the cloud-capped summit of Olympus  was the palace of {28} Zeus and Hera, of burnished gold, chased silver, and  gleaming ivory. Lower down were the homes of the other gods, which, though  less commanding in position and size, were yet similar to that of Zeus in  design and workmanship, all being the work of the divine artist Hephaestus.  Below these were other palaces of silver, ebony, ivory, or burnished brass,  where the Heroes, or Demi-gods, resided.    As the worship of Zeus formed so important a feature in the religion of the  Greeks, his statues were necessarily both numerous and magnificent. He is  usually represented as a man of noble and imposing mien, his countenance  expressing all the lofty majesty of the omnipotent ruler of the universe,  combined with the gracious, yet serious, benignity of the father and friend  of mankind. He may be recognized by his rich flowing beard, and the thick  masses of hair, which rise straight from the high and intellectual forehead  and fall to his shoulders in clustering locks. The nose is large and finely  formed, and the slightly-opened lips impart an air of sympathetic  kindliness which invites confidence. He is always accompanied by an eagle,  which either surmounts his sceptre, or sits at his feet; he generally bears  in his uplifted hand a sheaf of"]]]
