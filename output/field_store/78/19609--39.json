I will pump on it,\" the coachman said.  \"He's a bad-tempered brute, and I wonder the squire keeps it.\"    \"The brute ought to be killed,\" Reuben grumbled angrily. \"I have  never teased it or worried it, in any way. I wish you had stuck  that fork into him, instead of hitting him with it. If you hadn't  been within reach, he would have taken the bit out of me. He will  kill somebody some day, and it were best to kill him, first.\"    The gardener pumped for some time on Reuben's leg; and then, going  into the kitchen, he got some strips of rag from the cook and bound  it up.    \"You had best go home now,\" he said. \"I will tell the gardener,  when he comes round, what has happened to you. I doubt you will  have to lay up, for a day or two.\"    As Reuben limped home, he met Tom Thorne walking with another boy.    \"Hello, Reuben!\" the latter exclaimed. \"What's come to you? Yer  trousers bee all tore.\"    \"That brute of a house dog at the squire's has had hold of me,\"  Reuben answered. \"The savage beast has had a try, a good many  times; but this time he got hold, and he has bit me pretty sharp.\"    Reuben had to keep his leg quiet for three days but, the third  evening, he was well enough to go down the village to the  schoolhouse. After the lesson was over he walked for some distance  up the road, for his leg was very stiff; and he thought it would be  a good thing to try and walk it off, as he intended to go to work  next morning. On getting up early in the morning, however, he found  it was still stiff and sore; but he thought he had better go and  try to work for a bit.    \"I am glad you are back again,\" the gardener said, when he saw him,  \"for there's a lot of work on hand; but I see you are still lame.  The coachman tells me it were a nasty bite.\"    \"It's pretty sore still,\" Reuben replied, \"and I don't think I can  walk about much; but I thought I might help in some other way.\"    \"Very well,\" the gardener said. \"There are a lot of plants which  want shifting into larger pots. You do them, and I will take up the  fork and dig up that piece of ground I want to put the young  lettuces into.\"    Reuben worked hard till half-past eight, and then went off to his  breakfast. On his return, he was told the squire wished to speak to  him.    \"It's about that dog, I expect,\" the gardener remarked. \"I suppose  you know he were poisoned last night.\"    \"No, I didn't know,\" Reuben replied; \"but it's a precious good job.  I wish he had been poisoned before he got his teeth into me.\"    Reuben, on going round to the back door, was shown into the  library, where the squire was sitting. The coachman was with him.    \"Now then, Reuben,\" the squire said, \"I want you to tell me the  truth about this matter. The coachman told me, three days ago, that  you had been bitten by the yard dog, and I made up my mind to get  rid of him, on the first opportunity; but I find he was poisoned,  yesterday evening.\"    He stopped as if expecting Reuben to say something; but the boy,  having nothing to say, merely replied:    \"Yes, sir, so the gardener has told me.\"    \"What do you know about it, Reuben?\"    \"I don't know anything about it, sir,\" Reuben replied, opening his  eyes.    \"Now, look here, lad,\" the squire said gravely, \"I am disposed to  think well of you; and although I consider it a serious offence  your poisoning the dog, I shall consider it very much worse if you  deny it.\"    \"But I didn't poison it, sir,\" Reuben affirmed. \"I never dreamt of  such a thing.\"    The squire set his lips hard together.    \"Just tell me your story over again,\" he said to the coachman.    \"Well, yesterday evening, squire, I went down into the village to  buy some 'bacca. Just as I got back to the gate, out runs a boy. It  was too dark for me to see his face, but I naturally supposed it  were Reuben, so I said, 'Hello, Reuben, how's the leg?' But the  moment I spoke, he turned off from the path and ran away.    \"Well, I thought it was queer, but I went on to the stable. About a  quarter of an hour afterwards, and as I was a-cleaning up the bits,  I heard Wolf howl. He kept on at it, so I took a lantern and went  out to see what was the matter. He was rolling about, and seemed  very bad. I stood a-looking at him, wondering what were best to do,  when sudden he gave a sort of yell, and rolled over, and he was  dead. I thought it was no good telling you about it till this  morning; and thinking it over, and seeing how sudden like it was, I  come to the 'pinion as how he had been poisoned; and naturally  thinking that, as he had bit Reuben, and as how Reuben said he  ought to be killed, and seeing as I had met the boy a quarter an  hour afore the dog was took bad, it came to me as how he had done  it.    \"This morning I knew for certain as the dog had been poisoned, for  just outside of the reach of his chain there was that piece of  paper a-lying, as you have got before you.\"    It was a piece of blue paper, about four inches square, on which  was printed: \"Rat poison.\"    \"You hear that, Reuben? What have you to say?\" the squire asked.    \"I have got nothing to say, sir,\" Reuben answered, \"except that  whoever the boy was, it wasn't me, and that I know nothing about  it.\"    \"Well, Reuben, it will be easy for you to clear yourself, by saying  where you were at the time.    \"What o'clock was it, Robert, that you saw the boy?\"    \"It was just a quarter past eight, squire. The quarter struck just  as I opened the gate.\"    \"Were you out or at home at that hour, Reuben?\"    \"I was out, sir. I went to the schoolmaster's.\"    \"What time did you leave there?\"    \"I left at eight, sir.\"    \"Then if you got in just after eight, it is clear that you were not  the boy,\" the squire said. \"If your mother tells me that you were  in at five minutes past eight, that settles the question, as far as  you are concerned.\"    \"I didn't get in till half-past eight, sir,\" Reuben said. \"I walked  about for a bit, after I came out from school, to try and get the  stiffness out of my leg, so as to be able to come to work this  morning.\"    \"Was anyone with you, Reuben? Is there anyone to say what you did  with yourself, between eight and half-past eight?\"    \"No, sir,\" Reuben said quietly. \"I didn't speak to a soul; and  didn't see a soul, so far as I know, from the time I came out of  the gate of the schoolhouse till I got home.\"    \"Does your mother sell packets of this poison?\" the squire said,  pointing to the paper.    Reuben looked at the paper.    \"Yes, sir; I believe she does.\"    \"Well, my lad,\" the squire said, \"you must acknowledge that the  case looks very ugly against you. You are known to have borne bad  feelings against the dog; naturally enough, I admit. A boy about  your size was seen by Robert in the dark, coming out of the gate;  and that he was there for no good purpose is proved by the fact  that he ran away when spoken to. A quarter of an hour later, the  dog dies of poison. That poison you certainly could get at home  and, by your own admission, you were out and about at the time the  dog was poisoned. The case looks very bad against you.\"    \"I don't care how bad it looks,\" Reuben said, passionately. \"It  wasn't me, squire, if that were the last word I ever had to speak.\"    \"Very well,\" the squire said coldly. \"In my mind, the evidence is  overwhelming against you. I have no intention of pursuing the  matter further; nor will I, for your father's and mother's sake,  bring public disgrace upon you; but of course I shall not retain  you here further, nor have anything to do with you, in the future.\"    Without a word, Reuben turned and left the room. Had he spoken, he  would have burst into a passion of tears. With a white face, he  walked through the village and entered his mother's shop.    \"What? Back again, Reuben?\" she said. \"I thought your leg was too  bad to work.\"    \"It isn't my leg, mother,\" he said, in a choking voice. \"The squire  has dismissed me. He says I have poisoned his dog.\"    \"Says you poisoned his dog, Reuben! Whatever put such an idea into  his head?\"    \"The coachman saw a boy coming out of the yard, at a quarter past  eight last night. It was too dark for him to say for certain, but  he thought it was me. A quarter of an hour later the dog died of  poison, and this morning they picked up a cover of one of those rat  powders you sell. I couldn't say where I was at a quarter past  eight, when the coachman saw the boy; for as you know, mother, I  told you I had walked out a bit, after I came out from the school,  to get the stiffness out of my leg. So, altogether, the squire has  made up his mind 'tis me, and so he has sent me away.\"    Reuben had summed up the points against himself in a broken voice,  and now broke into a passion of tears. His mother tried in vain to  pacify him; but indeed her own indignation, at her boy being  charged with such a thing, was so great that she could do little to  console him.    \"It's shameful!\" she exclaimed, over and over again. \"I call it  downright wicked of the squire to suspect you of such a thing.\"    \"Well, mother, it does look very bad against me,\" Reuben said,  wiping his eyes at last, \"and I don't know as the squire is so much  to be blamed for suspecting me. I know and you know that it wasn't  me; but there's no reason why the squire should know it. Somebody  has poisoned his dog, and that somebody is a boy. He knows that I  was unfriendly with the dog so, putting things together, I don't  see as he could help suspecting me, and only my word the other way.  It seems to me as if somebody must have done it to get me in a row,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20034"],[0,"Scottish Ghost Stories (#5)"],[1," it as that of a woman, tall and thin, and with a total absence of  hair, which was emphasised in the most lurid and ghastly fashion. With  a snakelike movement, the evil thing slithered out of the wardrobe,  and, gliding past Letty, approached the bed. Letty was obliged to  follow every proceeding. She saw the thing deftly snatch the bolster  from under the sleeping head; noted the gleam of hellish satisfaction  in its eyes as it pressed the bolster down; and watched the murdered  creature's contortions grow fainter, and fainter, until they finally  ceased. The eyes then left the room; and from afar off, away below, in  the abysmal cellars of the house, came the sound of digging--faint,  very faint, but unquestionably digging. This terminated the grim,  phantasmal drama for that night at least, and Letty, chilled to the  bone, but thoroughly alert, escaped to her room. She spent her few  remaining hours of rest wide-awake, determining never to go to bed  again without fastening one of her arms to the iron staples.    With regard the history of the house, Letty never learned anything  more remarkable than that, long ago, an idiot child was supposed to  have been murdered in the haunted attic--by whom, tradition did not  say. The Admiral and his family left Pringle's Mansion the year Letty  became Miss South's nurse, and as no one would stay in the house,  presumably on account of the hauntings, it was pulled down, and an  inexcusably inartistic edifice was erected in its place.                                   CASE III        THE BOUNDING FIGURE OF \"---- HOUSE,\" NEAR        BUCKINGHAM TERRACE, EDINBURGH      No one is more interested in Psychical Investigation Work than Miss  Torfrida Vincent, one of the three beautiful daughters of Mrs. H. de  B. Vincent, who is, herself, still in the heyday of life, and one of  the loveliest of the society women I have met. Though I have known her  sisters several years, I only met Torfrida for the first time a few  months ago, when she was superintending the nursing of her mother, who  had just undergone an operation for appendicitis. One day, when I was  visiting my convalescent friend, Torfrida informed me that she knew of  a haunted house in Edinburgh, a case which she felt sure would arouse  my interest and enthusiasm. \"It is unfortunate,\" she added somewhat  regretfully, \"that I cannot tell you the number of the house, but as  I have given my word of honour to disclose it to no one, I feel sure  you will excuse me. Indeed, my friends the Gordons, who extracted the  promise from me, have got into sad trouble with their landlord for  leaving the house under the pretext that it was haunted, and he has  threatened to prosecute them for slander of title.\"    The house in question has no claim to antiquity. It may be eighty years  old--perhaps a little older--and was, at the time of which I speak, let  out in flats. The Gordons occupied the second storey; the one above  them was untenanted, and used as a storage place for furniture; the  first floor and ground floor were divided into chambers and offices.  They had not been in their new quarters more than a week, when Mrs.  Gordon asked the night porter who it was that made such a noise, racing  up their stairs between two and three in the morning. It had awakened  her every night, she told him, and she would be glad if the disturbance  were discontinued. \"I am sorry, Madam, but I cannot imagine who it can  be,\" the man replied. \"Of course, it may be some one next door, sounds  are so often deceptive; no one inhabits the rooms above you.\" But Mrs.  Gordon was not at all convinced, and made up her mind to complain to  the landlord should it occur again. That night nothing happened, but  the night after she was roused from her sleep at two o'clock, by a  feeling that something dreadful, some dire catastrophe, was about to  take place. The house was very still, and beyond the far-away echoes of  a policeman's patrol on the hard pavement outside, nothing, absolutely  nothing, broke the universal, and as it seemed to her, unnatural  silence. Generally at night-time there are sounds one likes to assure  oneself are too trivial to be heard during the day--the creaking of  boards, stairs (nearly always stairs), and the tapping of some leaf (of  course some leaf) at the windows. Who has not heard such sounds, and  who in his heart of hearts has not been only too well aware that they  are nocturnal, exclusively nocturnal. The shadows of evening bring with  them visitors; prying, curious visitors; grim and ghastly visitors;  grey, esoteric visitors; visitors from a world seemingly inconsequent,  wholly incomprehensible. Mrs. Gordon did not believe in ghosts. She  scoffed at the idea of ghosts, and, like so many would-be wits,  unreasonably brave by day, and the reverse by night, had hitherto  attributed banshees and the like to cats and other animals. But  now,--now when all was dark,--pitch dark and hushed, and she, for aught  she knew to the contrary, the only one, in that great rambling  building, awake, she reviewed again and again, in her mind, that  rushing up the stairs. The wind! It could not have been the wind. The  wind shuts doors, and rattles windows, and moans, and sighs, and howls  and screeches, but it does not walk the house in boots. Neither do  rats! And if she had imagined the noises, why did she not imagine other  things; why, for example, did she not see tables dance, and tea-urns  walk? All that would be fancy, unblushing, genuine fancy, and if she  conjured up one absurdity, why not another! That was a conundrum for  any sceptic. Thus did she argue, naturally and logically, in the quite  sensible fashion of a lawyer, or a scientist; yet, all the while, her  senses told her that the atmosphere of the house had undergone some  profoundly subtle and unaccountable change,--a change that brought with  it a presence, at once sinister and hostile. She longed to strike a  light and awake one of her daughters--Diana, by preference; since Diana  was the least likely to mind being disturbed, and had the strongest  nerves. She made a start, and, loosening the bedclothes that she always  liked tightly tucked round her, thrust out a quivering toe. The next  instant she drew it back with a tiny gasp of terror. The cold darkness  without had suggested to her mind a great, horny hand, mal-shaped and  murderous, that was lying in wait to seize her. A deadly sickness  overcame her, and she lay back on the pillow, her heart beating with  outrageous irregularity and loudness. Very slowly she recovered, and,  holding her breath, sidled to the far edge of the bed, and with a  dexterous movement, engendered by the desperation of fear, made a  lightning-like dab in the direction of the electric bell. Her soft,  pink finger missed the mark, and coming in violent contact with the  wall, bent the carefully polished nail. She bit her lips to stop a cry  of pain, and shrinking back within the folds of her dainty lace  embroidered nightdress, abandoned herself to despair. Her consciousness  of the Unknown Presence increased, and she instinctively felt the thing  pass through the closed door, down on to the landing outside, when it  dashed upstairs with a loud clatter, and, entering the lumber-room  immediately overhead, began bounding as if its feet were tied together,  backwards and forwards across the floor. After continuing for fully  half an hour, the noises abruptly ceased and the house resumed its  accustomed quiet. At breakfast, Mrs. Gordon asked her daughters if they  had heard anything in the night, and they laughingly said \"No, not even  a mouse!\"    There was now an intermission of the disturbances, and no further  demonstration occurred for about a month. Diana was then sleeping in  her mother's room, Mrs. Gordon being away on a visit to Lady Voss, who  was entertaining a party of friends at her shooting-box in Argyle. One  evening, as Diana was going into her bedroom to prepare for dinner,  she saw the door suddenly swing open, and something, she could not  tell what--it was so blurred and indistinct--come out with a bound.  Tearing past her on to the landing, it rushed up the stairs with so  much clatter that Diana imagined, though she could see nothing, that  it must have on its feet, heavy lumbering boots. Filled with an  irresistible curiosity, in spite of her alarm, Diana ran after it,  and, on reaching the upper storey, heard it making a terrific racket  in the room above the one in which she now slept. Nothing daunted,  however, she boldly approached, and, flinging open the door, perceived  its filmy outline standing before a shadowy and very antique eight-day  clock, which apparently it was in the habit of winding. A great fear  now fell on Diana. What was the thing? And supposing it should turn  round and face her, what should she see? She was entirely isolated  from her sisters, and the servants--alone--the light fading--in a big,  gloomy room full of strange old furniture which suggested  hiding-places for all sorts of grim possibilities. She was assured now  that the thing she had followed was nothing human, neither was it a  delusion, for when she shut her eyes and opened them, it was still  there--and, oddly enough, it was now more distinct than it was when  she had seen it downstairs. A curious feeling of helplessness stole  over Diana; the power of speech forsook her; and her limbs grew rigid.  She was so fearful, too, of attracting the notice of the mysterious  thing that she hardly dare breathe, and each pulsation of her heart  sent cold chills of apprehension down her spine. Once she endured  agonies through a mad desire to sneeze, and once her lips opened to  scream as something suspiciously like the antennae of a huge beetle,  and which she subsequently discovered was a \"devil's coach-horse,\"  tickled the calf of her leg. She fancied, too, that all sorts of queer  shapes lurked in the passage behind her,"]]]
