[HW: Dist 1  Ex-Slave #107]    JANE MICKENS TOOMBS OF WASHINGTON-WILKES  Age approx. 82    by  Minnie Branham Stonestreet  Washington-Wilkes  GEORGIA  [Date Stamp: JAN 26 1937]  [Date Stamp: MAY 8 1937]      A story of happiness and contentment on a big plantation where there  were \"a heap of us slaves\" is told by Jane Mickens Toombs who said she  was \"five er six years ole when de Wah come on (1860), or maby a lit'le  ol'er.\"    She is a bright old woman, well and spry despite the fact she \"wuz  conjured onst when I wuz young an' dat lef' me lame an' dis eye plum'  out an' de t'other bad.\"    When asked about the conjuring she said: \"No'm, I don't 'zackly know how  t'wuz, but enyhow somebody whut knowed how ter 'wu'k roots' got me lame  on dis side, an' my eye out, jess kase I wuz a decent, nice lookin' gal,  an' went on 'tendin' ter my business an' payin' dem no mind. Dat's de  way dey done in dem days, jess jealous of nice colored niggers. Yassum,  I wuz sick fer nigh on ter two years an' de doctuhs never knowed what  ailed me. Dey done everything dey could, but I wuz conjured an' dey  couldn't hep' me. A doctuh-man frum up yander in New Yalk cum down here  ter see his folks, an' he tried to kure [HW: cyore] me, but doctuhs  kain't [HW: kaan't] kure [HW: cyore] conjured folks, so I had ter lay  an' suffer 'til de conjure wore out. Dem whut done dat knowed dey done  me wrong, but I kep' trustin' in my Lawd, an' now dey's gone an' I'se er  stumblin' roun' yit. No mam, I never knowed jess whut dey done ter me,  but hit wuz bad, I kin tell yer dat, hit might nigh kilt me.\"    Aunt Jane was born on the Gullatt Plantation on the line of Wilkes and  Lincoln counties. Her Mother was Liza Gullatt and her father John  Mickens who belonged to Mr. Augustus McMekin. \"Yassum, my Pa wuz John  'Mickens an' his Marster bought him in Alabamy. All de slaves whut  belonged to de McMekins called dey selves 'Mickens. I wuz one of fifteen  chillun an' cum er long in betweenst de oldest 'uns an' de youngest  sum'ers. I wuz named fer my Mistess Jane Gullatt whut died. Young Marse  George Gullatt choosed me out, dough, an' I'd er been his'en ef Freedom  hadn't er come. You know dat's de way dey use ter do back in slavery  time, de young Mistesses an' Marsters choosed out de little niggers dey  wanted fer their'n.\"    This is another case where the father and mother belonged to different  families. The father had a pass to go and come as he pleased, although  his family lived a little distance away. Jane said her father's master  would have bought her mother if the War hadn't come on and they were set  free.    Jane told of the log cabins in the Quarters where all the negroes lived.  She said they were all in a row \"wid er street in de front, er wide  street all set thick wid white mulberry trees fer ter mak' shade fer de  chillun ter play in.\" They never had any punishment only [HW: except]  switchings by their Mistess, and that was not often. They played dolls,  \"us had home-made rag dolls, nice 'uns, an' we'd git dem long grass  plumes (Pampas grass) an' mak' dolls out'n dem too. Us played all day  long every day. My Mistess' chillun wuz all growed up so jess us little  niggers played tergether.    \"My Mother spun an' wove de cloth, an' dyed hit, but our Mistess made  our clothes. My Grandma, Nancy, wuz de cook an' she fed all de little  'uns in de big ole kitchen whut sot out in de yard. She had a tray she  put our victuals on an Uh, Uh, whut good things we had ter eat, an' er  plenty of everything! Us et jess whut our white folks had, dey didn't  mak' no difference in us when hit cum ter eatin'. My Grandaddy looked  atter de meat, he done everything 'bout dat, an' he sho' knowed how ter  fix it, too.    \"De fust thing I recollects is bein' round in de kitchen when dey wuz  makin' ginger cakes an' my Mistess givin' me de pan she made 'em in fer  me ter sop hit out. Dey ain't nothin' whut smells good lak' de cookin'  in dem days, I kain't smell no victuals lak' dat now. Everything wuz  cooked on a big ole open fire place in one end of de kitchen. Dem good  ole days done gone now. Folkes done got wiser an' wickeder--dey ain't  lak' dey use ter be.\"    At Christmas Santa Claus found his way to the Quarters on the Gollatt  plantation and each little slave had candy, apples, and \"sich good  things as dat.\" Aunt Jane gave a glowing description of the preparation  for the Christmas season: \"Lawdy, how de folks wu'ked gittin' ready fer  Chris'mus, fer three er fo' days dey stayed in de kitchen er cookin' an'  er bakin'--daye wuz de bes' light bread--great big loaves baked on de  fire place, an' cakes an' mo' good ginger cakes. Dey wuz plenty cooked  up to las' er long time. An' another thing, dare want no cookin' on  Sunday, no mam, no wu'k of no kind. My Mistess had de cook cookin' all  day Fridays an' Saddays so when Sunday come dare wuz hot coffee made an'  dat wuz all, everything else wuz cooked up an' cold. Everybody went to  Church, de grown folks white and black, went to de preachin' an' den all  de little niggers wuz called in an de Bible read an' 'splained ter dem.    \"Dare wuz preachin' down in de Quarters, but dat wuz at night an' wuz  led by de colored preachers. I recollects one night dare wuz a service  gwine on in one of de cabins an' all us wuz dare an' ole Uncle Alex  Frazier wuz up a linin' off a hymn 'bout      'Broad is de road dat leads ter Death     An' there an' here we travel.'    when in come some mens atter a colored feller whut had stole some sheep  an' hogs. Dey kotch 'im, but sho broke up de meetin'. In de hot summer  time Uncle George Gullatt use ter preach ter de slaves out under de  trees. Uncle George waz a kind of er preacher.    \"My Pa didn't 'low his chillun ter go 'roun'. No'm, he kep' us home  keerful lak. Young folks in dem days didn't go all over de country lak  dey does now, dey stayed at home, an' little chillun wuz kep' back an'  dey didn' know no badness lak de chillun do terday. Us never even heared  de ole folks talk nothin' whut we oughtn't ter hear. Us jess played an'  stayed in a child's place. When we wuz sick de white folks seed dat we  wuz 'tended to. Dey use ter mak Jerusalem Oak candy an' give us. Dey  took de leaves of dat bush an' boiled 'em an' den use dat water dey wuz  boiled in an' put sugar 'nough in hit ter mak candy. An dey used plenty  of turpentine on us too--plenty ov hit, an' I believes in dat terday,  hit's er good medicine.\"    When asked about the War, Aunt Jane said she didn't remember much about  it. \"But dare's one thing 'bout hit I sho' does 'member, an' dat's my  young Mistess Beckie's husband, Mr. Frazier, being off fightin' in de  Wah, an' she gittin' er letter frum him sayin' he wuz comin' home sich  an' sich er day. She wuz so happy she had all de grown slaves wu'kin'  gittin' ready fer him. Den dey brung her er letter sayin' he had been  kilt, an' she wuz in de yard when she read hit an' if dey hadn't er  kotch her she'd ov fell. I 'members de women takin' her in de house an'  gittin' her ter bed. She wuz so up sot an' took hit so hard. Dem wuz  sho' hard times an' sad 'uns too. 'Course I wuz too small ter know much  whut wuz gwine on, but I could tell hit wuz bad frum de way de older  folks looked.    \"I recollects when dey say Freedom had cum. Dare wuz a speakin' fer de  slaves up here in town in Barnett's Grove. Dat mornin' Ole Miss sont all  de oldes' niggers to de speakin' an' kep' us little 'uns dat day. She  kep' us busy sweepin' de yards an' sich as dat. An' she cooked our  dinner an' give hit to us herself. I 'members de grown folks leavin'  early dat mornin' in a great big waggin.    \"A while after de Wah, Pa took us over to de McMekins place an' we lived  dare fer a long time. He died an' lef' us an' den us had ter do de bes'  we could. Col. Tolbert hired me fer ter nuss his chillun an' I went over  ter his place ter live.\"    Aunt Jane said she isn't superstitious, but likes to see the new moon  clear and bow to it for good luck. She said it is better to show it a  piece of money, but as she doesn't always have money handy, she \"jess  bows to hit nice an' polite\". She keeps up with the weather by her  rheumatism and the cat: \"Ef I has de reumatics I knows hit's gwine ter  rain, an' when de cat comes 'round an' sets washin' her face, look fer  rain, kase hit's er comin'. I've heared folks say dat hit's bad luck ter  stump yo' lef' foot, but I don't know boud dat. But I tell yer, when I  meets er cat I allus turns er round 'fore I goes on, dat turns de bad  luck er way.\"    When 19 years of age Jane married Albert Toombs. He belonged to the  Toombs family of Wilkes county. Aunt Jane said Albert brought her many  gifts while he was courting: \"He warnt much on bringin' candy an'  nothin' lak dat ter eat, but he brung me shawls an' shoes--sumpin' I  could wear.\" They had four children, but only one is living.    \"When I wuz a growin' up\", said Aunt Jane, \"folks had ter wu'k.\" She  worked on the farm, spun, wove, \"done seamster wu'k\" and knitted  stockings, sox and gloves. She said she carded too, \"an' in dem times ef  a nigger wanted ter git de kinks out'n dey hair, dey combed hit wid de  cards. Now dey puts all kinds ov grease on hit, an' buy straightenin'  combs. Sumpin' dat costs money, dat's all dey is, old fashion cards'll  straighten hair jess as well as all dis high smellin' stuff dey sells  now.\"    Aunt Jane likes to tell of those days of long ago. Her memory is  excellent and she talks well. She says she is living out her Miss Jane's  time. \"Yassum, my Miss Jane died when she wuz so young, I specks I jess  livin' out her days kase I named fer her.

Robert Burns, the chief of the peasant poets of Scotland, was born in  a little mud-walled cottage on the banks of Doon, near \"Alloway's auld  haunted kirk,\" in the shire of Ayr, on the 25th day of January, 1759.  As a natural mark of the event, a sudden storm at the same moment  swept the land: the gabel-wall of the frail dwelling gave way, and the  babe-bard was hurried through a tempest of wind and sleet to the  shelter of a securer hovel. He was the eldest born of three sons and  three daughters; his father, William, who in his native  Kincardineshire wrote his name Burness, was bred a gardener, and  sought for work in the West; but coming from the lands of the noble  family of the Keiths, a suspicion accompanied him that he had been  out--as rebellion was softly called--in the forty-five: a suspicion  fatal to his hopes of rest and bread, in so loyal a district; and it  was only when the clergyman of his native parish certified his loyalty  that he was permitted to toil. This suspicion of Jacobitism, revived  by Burns himself, when he rose into fame, seems not to have influenced  either the feelings, or the tastes of Agnes Brown, a young woman on  the Doon, whom he wooed and married in December, 1757, when he was  thirty-six years old. To support her, he leased a small piece of  ground, which he converted into a nursery and garden, and to shelter  her, he raised with his own hands that humble abode where she gave  birth to her eldest son.    The elder Burns was a well-informed, silent, austere man, who endured  no idle gaiety, nor indecorous language: while he relaxed somewhat the  hard, stern creed of the Covenanting times, he enforced all the  work-day, as well as sabbath-da"]]]
