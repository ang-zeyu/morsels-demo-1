But let not any one shift the load upon his shoulder at his own  will, without the turning both of the white and of the yellow  key.[3] And let him deem every permutation foolish, if the thing  laid down be not included in the thing taken up, as four in  six.[4] Therefore whatever thing is, through its own worth, of  such great weight that it can draw down every balance, cannot be  made good with other spending.    [1] See Leviticus, xxvii., in respect to commutation allowed.    [2] That is, as the subject matter of the vow, the thing of which  sacrifice is made.    [3] Without the turning of the keys of St. Peter, that is,  without clerical dispensation; the key of gold signifying  authority, that of silver, knowledge. Cf. Purgatory, Canto IX.    [4] The matter substituted must exceed in worth that of the  original vow, but not necessarily in a definite proportion.      \"Let not mortals take a vow in jest; be faithful, and not  squint-eyed in doing this, as Jephthah was in his first.  offering;[1] to whom it better behoved to say, 'I have done ill,'  than, by keeping his vow, to do worse. And thou mayest find the  great leader of the Greeks in like manner foolish; wherefore  Iphigenia wept for her fair face, and made weep for her both the  simple and the wise, who heard speak of such like observance. Be,  ye Christians, more grave in moving; be not like a feather on  every wind, and think not that every water can wash you. Ye have  the Old and the New Testament, and the Shepherd of the Church,  who guides you; let this suffice you for your salvation. If evil  covetousness cry aught else to you, be ye men, and not silly  sheep, so that the Jew among you may not laugh at you. Act not  like the lamb, that leaves the milk of his mother, and, simple  and wanton, at its own pleasure combats with itself.\"    [1] See Judges, xi.      Thus Beatrice to me, even as I write; then all desireful turned  herself again to that region where the world is most alive.[1]  Her silence, and her transmuted countenance imposed silence on my  eager mind, which already had new questions in advance. And even  as an arrow, that hits the mark before the bowstring is quiet, so  we ran into the second realm.[2] Here I saw my lady so joyous as  she entered into the light of that heaven, that thereby the  planet became more lucent. And if the star war, changed and  smiled, what did I become, who even by my nature am transmutable  in every wise!    [1] Looking upward, toward the Empyrean.    [2] The Heaven of Mercury, where blessed spirits who have been  active in the pursuit of honor and fame show themselves.      As in a fishpond, which is tranquil and pure, the fish draw to  that which comes from without in such manner that they deem. it  their food, so indeed I saw more than a thousand splendors  drawing toward. us, and in each one was heard,--\"Lo, one who  shall increase our loves!\"[1] And as each came to us, the shade  was seen full of joy in the bright effulgence that issued from  it.    [1] By giving us occasion to manifest our love.      Think, Reader, if that which is here begun should not proceed,  how thou wouldst have distressful want of knowing more; and by  thyself thou wilt see how desirous I was to hear from these of  their conditions, as they became manifest to mine eyes. \"O  well-born,[1] to whom Grace concedes to see the thrones of the  eternal triumph ere the warfare is abandoned,[2] with the light  which spreads through the whole heaven we are enkindled, and  therefore if thou desirest to make thyself clear concerning us,  at thine own pleasure sate thyself.\" Thus was said to me by one  of those pious spirits; and by Beatrice, \"Speak, speak securely,  and trust even as to gods.\" \"I see clearly, how thou dost nest  thyself in thine ownlight, and that by thine eyes thou drawest  it, because they sparkle when thou smilest; but I know not who  thou art, nor why thou hast, O worthy soul, thy station in the  sphere which is veiled to mortals by another's rays.\"[3] This I  said, addressed unto the light which first had spoken to me;  whereon it became more lucent far than it had been. Even as the  sun, which, when the heat has consumed the tempering of dense  vapors, conceals itself by excess of light, so, through greater  joy, the holy shape bid itself from me within its own radiance,  and thus close enclosed, it answered me in the fashion that the  following canto sings.    [1] That is, born to good, to attain blessedness.    [2] Ere thy life on earth, as a member of the Church Militant, is  ended.    [3] Mercury is veiled by the Sun.        CANTO VI. Justinian tells of his own life.--The story of the  Roman Eagle.--Spirits in the planet Mercury.--Romeo.    After Constantine turned the Eagle counter to the course of the  heavens which it had followed behind the ancient who took to wife  Lavinia,[1] a hundred and a hundred years and more[2] the bird of  God held itself on the verge of Europe, near to the Mountains[3]  from which it first came forth, and there governed the world  beneath the shadow of the sacred wings, from hand to hand, and  thus changing, unto mine own arrived. Caesar I was,[4] and am  Justinian, who, through will of the primal Love which I feel,  drew out from among the laws what was superfluous and vain.[5]  And before I was intent on this work, I believed one nature to be  in Christ, not more,[6] and with such faith was content. But the  blessed Agapetus, who was the supreme pastor, directed me to the  pure faith with his words. I believed him; and that which was in  his faith I now see clearly, even as thou seest every  contradiction to be both false and true.[7] Soon as with the  Church I moved my feet, it pleased God, through grace, to inspire  me with the high labor, and I gave myself wholly to it. And I  entrusted my armies to my Belisarius, to whom the right hand of  Heaven was so joined that it was a sign that I should take  repose.    [1] Constantine, transferring the seat of Empire from Rome to  Byzantium, carried the Eagle from West to East, counter to the  course along which Aeneas had borne it when he went from Troy to  found the Roman Empire.    [2] From A. D. 324, when the transfer was begun, to 527, when  Justinian became Emperor.    [3] Of the Troad, opposite Byzantium.    [4] On earth Emperor, but in Heaven earthly dignities exist no  longer.    [5] The allusion is to Justinian's codification of the Roman Law.    [6] The divine nature only. Dante here follows Brunetto Latini  (Li Tresor, I. ii. 87) in an historical error.    [7] Of the two terms of a contradictory proposition one is true,  the other false.      \"Now here to the first question my answer comes to the stop; but  its nature constrains me to add a sequel to it, in order that  thou mayst see with how much reason[1] move against the ensign  sacrosanct, both he who appropriates it to himself,[2] and he who  opposes himself to it.[3] See how great virtue has made it worthy  of reverence,\" and he began from the hour when Pallas[4] died to  give it a kingdom. \"Thou knowest it made in Alba its abode for  three hundred years and move, till at the end the three fought  with the three[4] for its sake still. And thou knowest what it  did, from the wrong of the Sabine women clown to the sorrow of  Lucretia, in seven kings, conquering the neighboring  peoples round about. Thou knowest what it did when borne by the  illustrious Romans against Brennus, against Pyrrhus, and against  the other chiefs and allies; whereby Torquatus, and Quinctius who  was named from his neglected locks, the Decii and the Fabii  acquired the fame which willingly I embalm. It struck to earth  the pride of the Arabs, who, following Hannibal, passed the  Alpine rocks from which thou, Po, glidest. Beneath it, in their  youth, Scipio and Pompey triumphed, and to that hill beneath  which thou wast born, it seemed bitter.[5] Then, near the time  when all Heaven willed to bring the world to its own serene  mood, Caesar by the will of Rome took it: and what it did from  the Var even to the Rhine, the Isere beheld, and the Saone, and  the Seine beheld, and every valley whence the Rhone is filled.  What afterward it did when it came forth from Ravenna, and leaped  the Rubicon, was of such flight that neither tongue nor pen  could follow it. Toward Spain it wheeled its troop; then  toward Dyrrachium, and smote Pharsalia so that to the  warm Nile the pain was felt. It saw again Antandros and  Simois, whence it set forth, and there where Hector lies; and  ill for Ptolemy then it shook itself. Thence it swooped  flashing down on Juba; then wheeled again unto your west,  where it heard the Pompeian trumpet. Of what it did with the  next standard-bearer,[7] Bruttis and Cassius are barking in  Hell; and it made Modena and Perugia woful. Still does the  sad Cleopatra weep therefor, who, fleeing before it, took  from the asp sudden and black death. With him it ran far as  the Red Sea shore; with him it set the world in peace so  great that on Janus his temple was locked up. But what the  ensign which makes me speak had done before, and after  was to do, through the mortal realm that is subject to it,  becomes in appearance little and obscure, if in the hand of  the third Caesar[8] it be looked at with clear eye, and with  pure affection. For the living Justice which inspires me  granted to it, in the hand of him of whom I speak, the glory  of doing vengeance for Its own ire[9]--now marvel here at that  which I unfold to thee,--then with Titus it ran to do vengeance  for the avenging of the ancient sin.[2] And when the Lombard  tooth bit the Holy Church, under its wings Charlemagne,  conquering, succored her.

And foure woodhouses (? _wooden horses_) drew the mount till  it came before the queene, and then the king and his companie  descended and dansed. Then, suddenlie, the mount opened, and out came  six ladies in crimsin sattin and plunket, embrodered with gold and  pearle, with French hoods on their heads, and they dansed alone. Then  the lords of the mount tooke the ladies and dansed together; and the  ladies re-entered, and the mount closed, and so was conveied out of  the hall. Then the king shifted him, and came to the queene, and sat  at the banket, which was verie sumptuous.\"    1514, \"This Christmasse, on New Yeares night, the king, the Duke of  Suffolke, and two other were in mantels of cloath of silver, lined  with blew velvet; the silver was pounced in letters, that the velvet  might be seene through; the mantels had great capes like to the  Portingall slops, and all their hosen, dublets, and coats were of the  same fashion cut, and of the same stuffe. With them were foure ladies  in gowns, after the fashion of Savoie, of blew velvet, lined with  cloath of gold, the velvet all cut, and mantels like tipets knit  togither all of silver, and on their heads bonets of burned gold: the  foure torch-bearers were in sattin white and blew. This strange  apparell pleased much everie person, and in especiall the queene. And  thus these foure lords and foure ladies came into the queenes chamber  with great light of torches, and dansed a great season, and then put  off their visors, and were all well knowne, and then the queene  hartily thanked the king's grace for her goodlie pastime and desport.    \"Likewise on the Twelve night, the king and the queene came into the  hall at Greenewich, and suddenlie entered a tent of cloath of gold; and  before the tent stood foure men of armes, armed at all points, with  swords in their hands; and, suddenlie, with noise of trumpets entered  foure other persons all armed, and ran to the other foure, and there  was a great and fierce fight. And, suddenlie, out of a place like a  wood, eight wild men, all apparelled in greene mosse, made with sleved  silke, with ouglie weapons, and terrible visages, and there fought  with the knights eight to eight: and, after long fighting, the armed  knights drove the wild men out of their places, and followed the chase  out of the hall, and when they were departed, the tent opened, and  there came out six lords and six ladies richlie apparelled, and dansed  a great time. When they had dansed their pleasure, they entered the  tent againe, which was conveied out of the hall: then the king and  queene were served with a right sumptuous banket.\"    In 1515, \"The king kept a solemne Christmasse at his manor of Eltham;  and on the Twelfe night, in the hall was made a goodlie castell,  wounderously set out: and in it certeine ladies and knights; and when  the king and queene were set, in came other knights and assailed the  castell, where manie a good stripe was given; and at the last the  assailants were beaten awaie. And then issued out knights and ladies  out of the castell, which ladies were rich and strangelie disguised;  for all their apparell was in braids of gold, fret with moving  spangles of silver and gilt, set on crimsin sattin, loose and not  fastned; the men's apparell of the same sute made like Julis of  Hungarie, and the ladies heads and bodies were after the fashion of  Amsterdam. And when the dansing was done, the banket was served in of  five hundred dishes, with great plentie to everie bodie.\"    In 1517, \"the king kept his Christmasse at his manor of Greenwich, and  on the Twelfe night, according to the old custome, he and the queene  came into the hall; and when they were set, and the queene of Scots  also, there entered into the hall a garden artificiall, called the  garden of _Esperance_. This garden was towred at everie corner, and  railed with railes gilt; all the banks were set with flowers  artificiall of silke and gold, the leaves cut of green sattin, so that  they seemed verie flowers. In the midst of this garden was a piller of  antique worke, all gold set with pearles and stones, and on the top of  the piller, which was six square, was a lover, or an arch embowed,  crowned with gold; within which stood a bush of roses red and white,  all of silk and gold, and a bush of pomegranats of the like stuffe. In  this garden walked six knights, and six ladies richlie apparelled, and  then they descended and dansed manie goodlie danses, and so ascended  out of the hall, and then the king was served with a great banket.\"    In 1518 was the fearful plague of the \"sweating sickness,\" and the  chronicler says \"this maladie was so cruell that it killed some within  three houres, some merrie at dinner, and dead at dinner.\" It even  invaded the sanctity of the Court, and the king reduced his  _entourage_, and kept no Christmas that year.    In 1520, \"the king kept his Christmas at Greenwich with much  noblenesse and open Court. On Twelfe daie his grace and the earle of  Devonshire, with foure aids, answered at the tournie all commers,  which were sixteene persons. Noble and rich was their apparell, but in  feats of armes the king excelled the rest.\"    The next one recorded is that of 1524, when \"before the feast of  Christmasse, the lord Leonard Graie, and the lord John Graie, brethren  to the Marquesse Dorset, Sir George Cobham, sonne to the lord Cobham,  William Carie, Sir John Dudleie, Thomas Wiat, Francis Pointz, Francis  Sidneie, Sir Anthonie Browne, Sir Edward Seimor, Oliver Manners,  Percivall Hart, Sebastian Nudigate, and Thomas Calen, esquiers of the  king's houshold, enterprised a challenge of feats of armes against the  feast of Christmas, which was proclaimed by Windsore the herald, and  performed at the time appointed after the best manners, both at tilt,  tourneie, barriers, and assault of a castell erected for that purpose  in the tilt-yard at Greenewich, where the king held a roiall  Christmasse that yeare, with great mirth and princelie pastime.\"    Of the next Christ-tide we are told, \"In this winter there was great  death in London, so that the terme was adjourned: and the king kept  his Christmasse at Eltham, with a small number, and therefore it was  called the Still Christmasse.\"    In 1526, \"the king kept a solemne Christmasse at Greenewich with  revelles, maskes, disguisings and bankets; and the thirtith daie of  December, was an enterprise of iusts made at the tilt by six  gentlemen, against all commers, which valiantlie furnished the same,  both with speare and sword; and like iustes were kept the third daie  of Januarie, where were three hundred speares broken. That same night,  the king and manie yoong gentlemen with him, came to Bridewell, and  there put him and fifteene other, all in masking apparell, and then  tooke his barge and rowed to the cardinal's place, where were at  supper a great companie of lords and ladies, and then the maskers  dansed, and made goodlie pastime; and when they had well dansed, the  ladies plucked awaie their visors, and so they were all knowen, and to  the king was made a great banket.\"    This is the last recorded Christ-tide of this reign, and, doubtless,  as the king grew older and more sedate, he did not encourage the  sports which delighted him in his hot youth.          CHAPTER III         Historic Christ-tides--Edward VI., 1551--Mary--Elizabeth--James       I.--The Puritans--The Pilgrim Fathers--Christmas's       Lamentation--Christ-tide in the Navy, 1625.      Only one is noted in the reign of Edward VI., that of 1551, of which  Holinshed writes, \"Wherefore, as well to remove fond talke out of  men's mouths, as also to recreat and refresh the troubled spirits of  the young king; who seemed to take the trouble of his uncle[5]  somewhat heavilie; it was devised, that the feast of Christ's  nativitie, commonlie called Christmasse, then at hand, should be  solemnlie kept at Greenwich, with open houshold and frank resorte to  Court (which is called keeping of the hall), what time of old  ordinarie course there is alwaies one appointed to make sport in the  Court, called commonlie lord of misrule: whose office is not unknowne  to such as have beene brought up in noble men's houses, and among  great house-keepers, which use liberall feasting in that season. There  was, therefore, by orders of the Councell, a wise gentleman, and  learned, named George Ferrers, appointed to that office for this  yeare; who, being of better credit and estimation than commonlie his  predecessors had beene before, received all his commissions and  warrants by the name of the maister of the king's pastimes. Which  gentleman so well supplied his office, both in shew of sundrie sights  and devises of rare inventions, and in act of diverse interludes, and  matters of pastime plaied by persons, as not onely satisfied the  common sort, but, also, were very well liked and allowed by the  councell, and others of skill in the like pastimes; but, best of all,  by the yoong king himselfe, as appeered by his princelie liberalitie  in rewarding that service.    [Footnote 5: The Duke of Somerset had just been condemned to death,  and was beheaded the 22nd January following.]    \"On mondaie, the fourth of Januarie, the said lord of merie disports  came by water to London, and landed at the Tower wharffe, where he was  received by Vanse, lord of misrule to John Mainard, one of the  shiriffes of London, and so conducted through the citie with a great  companie of yoong lords and gentlemen to the house of Sir George  Barne, lord maior, where he, with the cheefe of his companie dined,  and, after, had a great banket: and at his departure the lord maior  gave him a standing cup with a cover of silver and guilt, of the value  of ten pounds, for a reward, and also set a hogshed of wine, and a  barrell of beere at his gate, for his traine that followed him.
