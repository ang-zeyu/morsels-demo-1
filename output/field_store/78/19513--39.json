[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1874"],[0,"The Railway Children (#5)"],[1,"you were at that time still young enough to be interested in everything  you saw, you will remember that you found yourself quite unable to  resist the temptation to poke your finger into the soft round of dough  that curved inside the pan like a giant mushroom. And you will remember  that your finger made a dent in the dough, and that slowly, but quite  surely, the dent disappeared, and the dough looked quite the same as it  did before you touched it. Unless, of course, your hand was extra dirty,  in which case, naturally, there would be a little black mark.    Well, it was just like that with the sorrow the children had felt at  Father's going away, and at Mother's being so unhappy. It made a deep  impression, but the impression did not last long.    They soon got used to being without Father, though they did not forget  him; and they got used to not going to school, and to seeing very little  of Mother, who was now almost all day shut up in her upstairs room  writing, writing, writing. She used to come down at tea-time and read  aloud the stories she had written. They were lovely stories.    The rocks and hills and valleys and trees, the canal, and above all, the  railway, were so new and so perfectly pleasing that the remembrance of  the old life in the villa grew to seem almost like a dream.    Mother had told them more than once that they were 'quite poor now,' but  this did not seem to be anything but a way of speaking. Grown-up people,  even Mothers, often make remarks that don't seem to mean anything in  particular, just for the sake of saying something, seemingly. There was  always enough to eat, and they wore the same kind of nice clothes they  had always worn.    But in June came three wet days; the rain came down, straight as lances,  and it was very, very cold. Nobody could go out, and everybody shivered.  They all went up to the door of Mother's room and knocked.    \"Well, what is it?\" asked Mother from inside.    \"Mother,\" said Bobbie, \"mayn't I light a fire? I do know how.\"    And Mother said: \"No, my ducky-love. We mustn't have fires in June--coal  is so dear. If you're cold, go and have a good romp in the attic.  That'll warm you.\"    \"But, Mother, it only takes such a very little coal to make a fire.\"    \"It's more than we can afford, chickeny-love,\" said Mother, cheerfully.  \"Now run away, there's darlings--I'm madly busy!\"    \"Mother's always busy now,\" said Phyllis, in a whisper to Peter. Peter  did not answer. He shrugged his shoulders. He was thinking.    Thought, however, could not long keep itself from the suitable  furnishing of a bandit's lair in the attic. Peter was the bandit, of  course. Bobbie was his lieutenant, his band of trusty robbers, and, in  due course, the parent of Phyllis, who was the captured maiden for whom  a magnificent ransom--in horse-beans--was unhesitatingly paid.    They all went down to tea flushed and joyous as any mountain brigands.    But when Phyllis was going to add jam to her bread and butter, Mother  said:--    \"Jam OR butter, dear--not jam AND butter. We can't afford that sort of  reckless luxury nowadays.\"    Phyllis finished the slice of bread and butter in silence, and followed  it up by bread and jam. Peter mingled thought and weak tea.    After tea they went back to the attic and he said to his sisters:--    \"I have an idea.\"    \"What's that?\" they asked politely.    \"I shan't tell you,\" was Peter's unexpected rejoinder.    \"Oh, very well,\" said Bobbie; and Phil said, \"Don't, then.\"    \"Girls,\" said Peter, \"are always so hasty tempered.\"    \"I should like to know what boys are?\" said Bobbie, with fine disdain.  \"I don't want to know about your silly ideas.\"    \"You'll know some day,\" said Peter, keeping his own temper by what  looked exactly like a miracle; \"if you hadn't been so keen on a row, I  might have told you about it being only noble-heartedness that made me  not tell you my idea. But now I shan't tell you anything at all about  it--so there!\"    And it was, indeed, some time before he could be induced to say  anything, and when he did it wasn't much. He said:--    \"The only reason why I won't tell you my idea that I'm going to do is  because it MAY be wrong, and I don't want to drag you into it.\"    \"Don't you do it if it's wrong, Peter,\" said Bobbie; \"let me do it.\" But  Phyllis said:--    \"_I_ should like to do wrong if YOU'RE going to!\"    \"No,\" said Peter, rather touched by this devotion; \"it's a forlorn hope,  and I'm going to lead it. All I ask is that if Mother asks where I am,  you won't blab.\"    \"We haven't got anything TO blab,\" said Bobbie, indignantly.    \"Oh, yes, you have!\" said Peter, dropping horse-beans through his  fingers. \"I've trusted you to the death. You know I'm going to do a lone  adventure--and some people might think it wrong--I don't. And if Mother  asks where I am, say I'm playing at mines.\"    \"What sort of mines?\"    \"You just say mines.\"    \"You might tell US, Pete.\"    \"Well, then, COAL-mines. But don't you let the word pass your lips on  pain of torture.\"    \"You needn't threaten,\" said Bobbie, \"and I do think you might let us  help.\"    \"If I find a coal-mine, you shall help cart the coal,\" Peter  condescended to promise.    \"Keep your secret if you like,\" said Phyllis.    \"Keep it if you CAN,\" said Bobbie.    \"I'll keep it, right enough,\" said Peter.    Between tea and supper there is an interval even in the most greedily  regulated families. At this time Mother was usually writing, and Mrs.  Viney had gone home.    Two nights after the dawning of Peter's idea he beckoned the girls  mysteriously at the twilight hour.    \"Come hither with me,\" he said, \"and bring the Roman Chariot.\"    The Roman Chariot was a very old perambulator that had spent years of  retirement in the loft over the coach-house. The children had oiled its  works till it glided noiseless as a pneumatic bicycle, and answered to  the helm as it had probably done in its best days.    \"Follow your dauntless leader,\" said Peter, and led the way down the  hill towards the station.    Just above the station many rocks have pushed their heads out through  the turf as though they, like the children, were interested in the  railway.    In a little hollow between three rocks lay a heap of dried brambles and  heather.    Peter halted, turned over the brushwood with a well-scarred boot, and  said:--    \"Here's the first coal from the St. Peter's Mine. We'll take it home in  the chariot. Punctuality and despatch. All orders carefully attended to.  Any shaped lump cut to suit regular customers.\"    The chariot was packed full of coal. And when it was packed it had to  be unpacked again because it was so heavy that it couldn't be got up the  hill by the three children, not even when Peter harnessed himself to the  handle with his braces, and firmly grasping his waistband in one hand  pulled while the girls pushed behind.    Three journeys had to be made before the coal from Peter's mine was  added to the heap of Mother's coal in the cellar.    Afterwards Peter went out alone, and came back very black and  mysterious.    \"I've been to my coal-mine,\" he said; \"to-morrow evening we'll bring  home the black diamonds in the chariot.\"    It was a week later that Mrs. Viney remarked to Mother how well this  last lot of coal was holding out.    The children hugged themselves and each other in complicated wriggles of  silent laughter as they listened on the stairs. They had all forgotten  by now that there had ever been any doubt in Peter's mind as to whether  coal-mining was wrong.    But there came a dreadful night when the Station Master put on a pair  of old sand shoes that he had worn at the seaside in his summer holiday,  and crept out very quietly to the yard where the Sodom and Gomorrah heap  of coal was, with the whitewashed line round it. He crept out there, and  he waited like a cat by a mousehole. On the top of the heap something  small and dark was scrabbling and rattling furtively among the coal.    The Station Master concealed himself in the shadow of a brake-van that  had a little tin chimney and was labelled:--         G. N. and S. R.            34576      Return at once to    White Heather Sidings    and in this concealment he lurked till the small thing on the top of  the heap ceased to scrabble and rattle, came to the edge of the heap,  cautiously let itself down, and lifted something after it. Then the arm  of the Station Master was raised, the hand of the Station Master fell  on a collar, and there was Peter firmly held by the jacket, with an old  carpenter's bag full of coal in his trembling clutch.    \"So I've caught you at last, have I, you young thief?\" said the Station  Master.    \"I'm not a thief,\" said Peter, as firmly as he could. \"I'm a  coal-miner.\"    \"Tell that to the Marines,\" said the Station Master.    \"It would be just as true whoever I told it to,\" said Peter.    \"You're right there,\" said the man, who held him. \"Stow your jaw, you  young rip, and come along to the station.\"    \"Oh, no,\" cried in the darkness an agonised voice that was not Peter's.    \"Not the POLICE station!\" said another voice from the darkness.    \"Not yet,\" said the Station Master. \"The Railway Station first. Why,  it's a regular gang. Any more of you?\"    \"Only us,\" said Bobbie and Phyllis, coming out of the shadow of another  truck labelled Staveley Colliery, and bearing on it the legend in white  chalk: 'Wanted in No. 1 Road.'    \"What do you mean by spying on a fellow like this?\" said Peter, angrily.    \"Time someone did spy on you, _I_ think,\" said the Station Master. \"Come  along to the station.\"    \"Oh, DON'T!\" said Bobbie. \"Can't you decide NOW what you'll do to us?  It's our fault just as much as Peter's. We helped to carry the coal  away--and we knew where he got it.\"    \"No, you didn't,\" said Peter.    \"Yes, we did,\" said Bobbie. \"We knew all the time. We only pretended we  didn't just to humour you.\"    Peter's cup was full. He"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18751"],[0,"A Text-book of Assaying: For the Use of Those Connected with Mines. (#5)"],[1," between the avoirdupois  and metric systems, a ton is taken as 2000 lbs. There, too, the custom  is adopted of reporting the gold and silver contents of an ore as so  many dollars and cents to the ton. In the case of gold, an ounce is  considered to be worth 20.6718 dollars. With silver, the _nominal_ value  is 1.2929 dollars per ounce, but frequently in assay reports it is taken  as one dollar. The practice is objectionable. The prices of metals vary  with the fluctuations of the market, and if the assayer fixed the price,  the _date_ of his report would be all important; if, on the other hand,  he takes a fixed price which does not at all times agree with the market  one, it leaves a path open for the deception of those unacquainted with  the custom. American \"dollars on the ton of 2000 lbs.\" may be converted  into \"ounces in the ton of 2240 lbs.\" by dividing by 1.1544 in the case  of silver, and by 18.457 in the case of gold.    ~Laboratory Books and Report Forms.~--The record which the assayer makes  of his work must be clear and neat, so that reference, even after an  interval of years, should be certain and easy.

For general purposes the form given on p. 12 is  useful.    ~The quantity of substance~ to be taken for any particular assay depends  largely upon the method of assay adopted. There are, however, some  general considerations which should be remembered, and some devices for  simplifying the calculations which should be discussed.    The smaller the percentage of the substance to be determined, the larger  should be the amount of the ore taken. The following table will give a  general idea as to this:--    Percentage of the substance    Amount of ore, &c. to       to be determined.             be weighed.          100-10                      1 gram.           10-5                       2 grams.            5-1                       5   \"            1-0.1                    10   \"          0.1-0.01                   20   \"    [Illustration: ASSAY NOTE]    The rougher the method of assay adopted, the larger should be the  quantity of ore taken. If the degree of accuracy attainable with the  methods and instruments at the assayer's service is known, it is easy to  calculate what quantity should be taken for any particular case. If the  results are good within 0.001 gram, then, taking 1 gram of ore we can  report within 0.1 per cent., or if they are good within 0.0002 gram,  taking 20 grams of ore, we can report within 1 part per 100,000, or very  closely within 6-1/2 dwt. to the ton. If it is wished to be yet more  particular in reporting, larger quantities must be taken. The difficulty  of manipulating very small or very large precipitates, &c., must be  borne in mind. So, too, must the fact that the greater the weight of the  final product of an assay, the less, as a rule, is the percentage error.  The distinction between absolute and percentage error, often overlooked,  is important. If 0.5 gram of silver be cupelled with 20 grams of lead,  there may be obtained a button of 0.495 gram; the absolute loss is 0.005  gram, and this equals 1 per cent. of the silver present. Similarly,  cupelling 0.1 gram, the resulting button may be 0.098; the absolute loss  is only 0.002 gram, but this equals 2 per cent. of the silver present.  In the same way the student should see that the two results, 91.5 per  cent. and 92.0 per cent., are really more concordant than the results  9.1 per cent. and 9.2 per cent.    A device often adopted in practice where a large number of assays of one  kind are made, and the report is given as so many ounces or pounds to  the ton, is that known as the _assay ton_. The assay ton may be any  arbitrary and convenient weight, but its subdivisions must bear to it  the same relations as pounds and ounces bear to the actual ton. On the  other hand, in a laboratory where many kinds of work are performed,  different sets of weights of this kind would only tend to confusion,  even if they were not unnecessary. With a set of gram weights and its  subdivisions anything may be done. If"]]]
