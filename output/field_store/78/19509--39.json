The notion of  three distinct functions of government approximating what we today term  the legislative, the executive, and the judicial, is set forth in  Aristotle's Politics,[29] but it was the celebrated Montesquieu who, by  joining the idea to the notion of a \"mixed constitution\" of \"checks and  balances\", in Book XI of his Spirit of the Laws, brought Aristotle's  discovery to the service of the rising libertarianism of the eighteenth  century. It was Montesquieu's fundamental contention that \"men entrusted  with power tend to abuse it\". Hence it was desirable to divide the  powers of government, first, in order to keep to a minimum the powers  lodged in any single organ of government; secondly, in order to be able  to oppose organ to organ.    In the United States libertarian application of the principle was  originally not too much embarrassed by inherited institutions. In its  most dogmatic form the American conception of the Separation of Powers  may be summed up in the following propositions: (1) There are three  intrinsically distinct functions of government, the legislative, the  executive, and the judicial; (2) these distinct functions ought to be  exercised respectively by three separately manned departments of  government; which, (3) should be constitutionally equal and mutually  independent; and finally, (4) a corollary doctrine stated by Locke--the  legislature may not delegate its powers.[30]    Prior even to Franklin D. Roosevelt this entire colligation of ideas had  been impaired by three developments in national governmental practice:  first, the growth of Presidential initiative in legislation; secondly,  the delegation by Congress of legislative powers to the President;  thirdly, the delegation in many instances of like powers to so-called  independent agencies or commissions, in which are merged in greater or  less measure the three powers of government of Montesquieu's postulate.  Under Roosevelt the first two of these developments were brought to a  pitch not formerly approximated, except temporarily during World War I.    The truth is that the practice of delegated legislation is inevitably  and inextricably involved with the whole idea of governmental  intervention in the economic field, where the conditions to be regulated  are of infinite complexity and are constantly undergoing change. Granted  such intervention, it is simply out of the question to demand that  Congress should attempt to impose upon the shifting and complex scene  the relatively permanent molds of statutory provision, unqualified by a  large degree of administrative discretion. One of the major reasons  urged for governmental intervention is furnished by the need for gearing  the different parts of the industrial process with one another for a  planned result. In wartime this need is freely conceded by all; but its  need in economic crisis is conceivably even greater, the results sought  being more complex. So in the interest both of unity of design and of  flexibility of detail, presidential power today takes increasing toll  from both ends of the legislative process--both from the formulation of  legislation and from its administration. In other words, as a barrier  capable of preventing such fusion of presidential and congressional  power, the principle of the Separation of Powers does not appear to have  retained much of its original effectiveness; for on only one  occasion[31] prior to the disallowance, in Youngstown _v._ Sawyer,[32]  President Truman's seizure in April 1952 of the steel industry has the  Court been constrained to condemn, as in conflict with that principle, a  congressional delegation of legislative power. Indeed, its application  in the field of foreign relations has been virtually terminated by  Justice Sutherland's opinion in the Curtiss-Wright Case.[33]    The Youngstown Opinion appears to rest on the proposition that since  Congress could have ordered the seizure, e.g., under the necessary and  proper clause, the President, in making it on his own, usurped  \"legislative power\" and thereby violated the principle of the Separation  of Powers. In referring to this proposition, the Chief Justice (in his  dissenting opinion, for himself and Justices Reed and Minton) quoted as  follows from a 1915 brief of the then Solicitor General of the United  States on this same question:         The function of making laws is peculiar to Congress, and the       Executive can not exercise that function to any degree. But       this is not to say that all of the _subjects_ concerning which       laws might be made are perforce removed from the possibility       of Executive influence. The Executive may act upon things and       upon men in many relations which have not, though they might       have, been actually regulated by Congress.         In other words, just as there are fields which are peculiar to       Congress and fields which are peculiar to the Executive, so       there are fields which are common to both, in the sense that       the Executive may move within them until they shall have been       occupied by legislative action. These are not the fields of       legislative prerogative, but fields within which the lawmaking       power may enter and dominate whenever it chooses. This       situation results from the fact that the President is the       active agent, not of Congress, but of the Nation.[34]    Or, in more general terms, the fact that one of the three departments  may apply its distinctive techniques to a certain subject matter sheds  little or no light on the question whether one of the other departments  may deal with the same subject matter according to its distinctive  techniques. Indeed, were it otherwise, the action of the Court in  disallowing President Truman's seizure order would have been of very  questionable validity, inasmuch as the President himself conceded that  Congress could do so.    The conception of the Separation of Powers doctrine advanced in  Youngstown appears to have been an ad hoc discovery for the purpose of  disposing of that particular case.    To sum up the argument to this point: War, the Roosevelt-Truman  programs, and the doctrines of Constitutional Law on which they rest,  and the conception of governmental function which they incorporate, have  all tremendously strengthened forces which even earlier were making,  slowly, to be sure, but with \"the inevitability of gradualness,\" for the  concentration of governmental power in the United States, first in the  hands of the National Government; and, secondly, in the hands of the  national Executive. In the Constitutional Law which the validation of  the Roosevelt program has brought into full being, the two main  structural elements of government in the United States in the past, the  principle of Dual Federalism and the doctrine of the Separation of  Powers, have undergone a radical and enfeebling transformation which war  has, naturally, carried still further.      III    A Government of Laws and Not of Men    The earliest repositories of executive power in this country were the  provincial governors. Being the point of tangency and hence of  irritation between imperial policy and colonial particularism, these  officers incurred a widespread unpopularity that was easily generalized  into distrust of their office. So when Jefferson asserted in his  _Summary View_, in 1774, that the King \"is no more than the chief  officer of the people, appointed by the laws and circumscribed with  definite powers, to assist in working the great machine of  government,\"[35] he voiced a theory of executive power which, impudently  as it flouted historical fact, had the support of the draftsmen of the  first American constitutions. In most of these instruments the governors  were elected annually by the legislative assemblies, were stripped of  every prerogative of their predecessors in relation to legislation, and  were forced to exercise the powers left them subject to the advice of a  council chosen also by the assembly, and from its own members if it so  desired. Finally, out of abundant caution the constitution of Virginia  decreed that executive powers were to be exercised \"according to the  laws of\" the Commonwealth, and that no power or prerogative was ever to  be claimed \"by virtue of any law, statute or custom of England.\"  \"Executive power\", in short, was left entirely to legislative definition  and was cut off from all resources of the common law and the precedents  of English monarchy.    Fortunately or unfortunately, the earlier tradition of executive power  was not to be exorcised so readily. Historically, this tradition traces  to the fact that the royal prerogative was residual power, that the  monarch was first on the ground, that the other powers of government  were off-shoots from monarchical power. Moreover, when our forefathers  turned to Roman history, as they intermittently did, it was borne in  upon them that dictatorship had at one time been a normal feature of  republican institutions.    And what history consecrated, doctrine illumined. In Chapter XI of John  Locke's Second Treatise on Civil Government, from the pages of which  much of the opening paragraphs of the Declaration of Independence comes,  we read: \"Absolute arbitrary power, or governing without settled  standing laws, can neither of them consist with the ends of society and  government\".[36] In Chapter XIV of the same work we are told,  nevertheless, that \"prerogative\" is the power \"to act according to  discretion without the prescription of the law and sometimes against  it\"; and that this power belongs to the executive, it being \"impossible  to foresee and so by laws to provide for all accidents and necessities  that may concern the public, or make such laws as will do no harm if  they are executed with inflexible"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1864"],[0,"Hero Tales from American History (#5)"],[1,"that his only quarrel was with  the British, and that if the other inhabitants would stay in their own  homes they would not be molested. Sending the duck-hunter ahead, Clark  took up his march and entered the town just after nightfall. The news  conveyed by the released hunter astounded the townspeople, and they  talked it over eagerly, and were in doubt what to do. The Indians, not  knowing how great might be the force that would assail the town, at once  took refuge in the neighboring woods, while the Creoles retired to their  own houses. The British knew nothing of what had happened until the  Americans had actually entered the streets of the little village.  Rushing forward, Clark's men soon penned the regulars within their  fort, where they kept them surrounded all night. The next day a party  of Indian warriors, who in the British interest had been ravaging the  settlements of Kentucky, arrived and entered the town, ignorant that  the Americans had captured it. Marching boldly forward to the fort,  they suddenly found it beleaguered, and before they could flee they were  seized by the backwoodsmen. In their belts they carried the scalps of  the slain settlers. The savages were taken redhanded, and the American  frontiersmen were in no mood to show mercy. All the Indians were  tomahawked in sight of the fort.    For some time the British defended themselves well; but at length their  guns were disabled, all of the gunners being picked off by the backwoods  marksmen, and finally the garrison dared not so much as appear at a  port-hole, so deadly was the fire from the long rifles. Under such  circumstances Hamilton was forced to surrender.    No attempt was afterward made to molest the Americans in the land they  had won, and upon the conclusion of peace the Northwest, which had been  conquered by Clark, became part of the United States.          THE BATTLE OF TRENTON         And such they are--and such they will be found:       Not so Leonidas and Washington,       Their every battle-field is holy ground       Which breathes of nations saved, not worlds undone.       How sweetly on the ear such echoes sound!       While the mere victor's may appal or stun       The servile and the vain, such names will be       A watchword till the future shall be free.                          --Byron.      In December, 1776, the American Revolution was at its lowest ebb. The  first burst of enthusiasm, which drove the British back from Concord  and met them hand to hand at Bunker Hill, which forced them to abandon  Boston and repulsed their attack at Charleston, had spent its force. The  undisciplined American forces called suddenly from the workshop and the  farm had given way, under the strain of a prolonged contest, and had  been greatly scattered, many of the soldiers returning to their homes.  The power of England, on the other hand, with her disciplined army and  abundant resources, had begun to tell. Washington, fighting stubbornly,  had been driven during the summer and autumn from Long Island up the  Hudson, and New York had passed into the hands of the British. Then  Forts Lee and Washington had been lost, and finally the Continental army  had retreated to New Jersey. On the second of December Washington was  at Princeton with some three thousand ragged soldiers, and had escaped  destruction only by the rapidity of his movements. By the middle of the  month General Howe felt that the American army, unable as he believed  either to fight or to withstand the winter, must soon dissolve, and,  posting strong detachments at various points, he took up his winter  quarters in New York. The British general had under his command in his  various divisions twenty-five thousand well-disciplined soldiers, and  the conclusion he had reached was not an unreasonable one; everything,  in fact, seemed to confirm his opinion. Thousands of the colonists were  coming in and accepting his amnesty. The American militia had left the  field, and no more would turn out, despite Washington's earnest appeals.  All that remained of the American Revolution was the little Continental  army and the man who led it.    Yet even in this dark hour Washington did not despair. He sent in every  direction for troops. Nothing was forgotten. Nothing that he could do  was left undone. Unceasingly he urged action upon Congress, and at the  same time with indomitable fighting spirit he planned to attack the  British. It was a desperate undertaking in the face of such heavy odds,  for in all his divisions he had only some six thousand men, and even  these were scattered. The single hope was that by his own skill and  courage he could snatch victory from a situation where victory seemed  impossible. With the instinct of a great commander he saw that his only  chance was to fight the British detachments suddenly, unexpectedly,  and separately, and to do this not only required secrecy and perfect  judgment, but also the cool, unwavering courage of which, under such  circumstances, very few men have proved themselves capable. As Christmas  approached his plans were ready. He determined to fall upon the British  detachment of Hessians, under Colonel Rahl, at Trenton, and there strike  his first blow. To each division of his little army a part in the  attack was assigned with careful forethought. Nothing was overlooked and  nothing omitted, and then, for some reason good or bad, every one of  the division commanders failed to do his part. As the general plan was  arranged, Gates was to march from Bristol with two thousand men; Ewing  was to cross at Trenton; Putnam was to come up from Philadelphia; and  Griffin was to make a diversion against Donop. When the moment came,  Gates, who disapproved the plan, was on his way to Congress; Griffin  abandoned New Jersey and fled before Donop; Putnam did not attempt  to leave Philadelphia; and Ewing made no effort to cross at Trenton.  Cadwalader came down from Bristol, looked at the river and the  floating ice, and then gave it up as desperate. Nothing remained except  Washington himself with the main army, but he neither gave up, nor  hesitated, nor stopped on account of the ice, or the river, or the  perils which lay beyond. On Christmas Eve, when all the Christian  world was feasting and rejoicing, and while the British were enjoying  themselves in their comfortable quarters, Washington set out. With  twenty-four hundred men he crossed the Delaware through the floating ice,  his boats managed and rowed by the sturdy fishermen of Marblehead from  Glover's regiment. The crossing was successful, and he landed about nine  miles from Trenton. It was bitter cold, and the sleet and snow drove  sharply in the faces of the troops. Sullivan, marching by the river,  sent word that the arms of his soldiers were wet. \"Tell your general,\"  was Washington's reply to the message, \"to use the bayonet, for the  town must be taken.\" When they reached Trenton it was broad daylight.  Washington, at the front and on the right of the line, swept down the  Pennington road, and, as he drove back the Hessian pickets, he heard the  shout of Sullivan's men as, with Stark leading the van, they charged in  from the river. A company of jaegers and of light dragoons slipped away.  There was some fighting in the streets, but the attack was so strong and  well calculated that resistance was useless. Colonel Rahl, the British  commander, aroused from his revels, was killed as he rushed out to rally  his men, and in a few moments all was over. A thousand prisoners fell  into Washington's hands, and this important detachment of the enemy was  cut off and destroyed.    The news of Trenton alarmed the British, and Lord Cornwallis with seven  thousand of the best troops started at once from New York in hot pursuit  of the American army. Washington, who had now rallied some five thousand  men, fell back, skirmishing heavily, behind the Assunpink, and when  Cornwallis reached the river he found the American army awaiting him on  the other side of the stream. Night was falling, and Cornwallis, feeling  sure of his prey, decided that he would not risk an assault until the  next morning. Many lessons had not yet taught him that it was a fatal  business to give even twelve hours to the great soldier opposed to him.  During the night Washington, leaving his fires burning and taking  a roundabout road which he had already reconnoitered, marched to  Princeton. There he struck another British detachment. A sharp fight  ensued, the British division was broken and defeated, losing some five  hundred men, and Washington withdrew after this second victory to the  highlands of New Jersey to rest and recruit.    Frederick the Great is reported to have said that this was the most  brilliant campaign of the century. With a force very much smaller than  that of the enemy, Washington had succeeded in striking the British at  two places with superior forces at each point of contact. At Trenton he  had the benefit of a surprise, but the second time he was between two  hostile armies. He was ready to fight Cornwallis when the latter reached  the Assunpink, trusting to the strength of his position to make up for  his inferiority of numbers. But when Cornwallis gave him the delay of a  night, Washington, seeing the advantage offered by his enemy's mistake,  at once changed his whole plan, and, turning in his tracks, fell upon  the smaller of the two forces opposed to him, wrecking and defeating  it before the outgeneraled Cornwallis could get up with the main army.  Washington had thus shown the highest form of military skill, for  there is nothing that requires so much judgment and knowledge, so much  certainty of movement and quick decision, as to meet a superior enemy at  different points, force the fighting, and at each point to outnumber and  overwhelm him.    But the military part of this great campaign was not all. Many great  soldiers have not been statesmen, and"]]]
