Then we would heave about, make sail in  chase, drive her off the coast, and work in as close to the river's  mouth as we dared venture, when the ship was to be brought to an anchor,  and the boats manned, armed, and dispatched into the river.    Meanwhile, as previously arranged, Captain Harrison was aroused, and  informed of the fact that the decoy schooner, or what was assumed to be  such, had made her appearance and was now fairly at sea, steering a  little to the northward of west under a heavy press of sail; and close  upon the heels of the returning messenger the worthy skipper himself  appeared.  He sprang upon a gun-carriage and peered intently shoreward  under the shade of his hand; but only the upper canvas of the stranger  was visible from our deck; and he impatiently hailed the look-out aloft  to give him a detailed description of the vessel.  The fellow in the  cross-trees happened, however, to be a poor sort of unintelligent  fellow, and could say very little about the craft beyond stating the  fact that she was a schooner, painted black; that she sat deep in the  water, showed an immense spread of canvas, and appeared to be very fast.    \"I have no sort of doubt that yonder schooner is the craft whose duty it  is to draw us off the coast and leave the way clear for the other  fellows to get out to sea,\" he said.  \"But I should like to have a  somewhat better description of her than that `sodger' up aloft there  seems able to give.\"    He glanced round the deck and his eye fell upon me.    \"Ah, Mr Fortescue,\" he exclaimed, \"you will doubtless be able to do  what I want.  Just slip down into my cabin; you will find my glass  hanging above the head of my bunk.  Throw the strap of it over your  shoulder, and shin up alongside that fellow in the cross-trees; take a  good look at the stranger; and report to me any peculiarities that you  may detect in her, will ye.\"    \"Ay, ay, sir,\" I replied, touching my hat; and five minutes later I was  sitting in the main-topmast cross-trees, with the long barrel of the  telescope steadied against the topmast-head, and my eye glued to the  eye-piece.  From this elevation I commanded a complete, if distant, view  of the low land about the river entrance, with its fringe of mangrove  trees running away inland, the sand hummocks, sparsely clothed with  coarse, reedy grass and trailing plants, and the endless line of the  surf-beaten African beach.  Also through the skipper's powerful lenses I  obtained a most excellent view of the strange schooner, from her trucks  to her water-line, including such details as I could have discerned with  the naked eye at a distance of about half a mile.  I saw, for example,  that, as the look-out had already reported, she was a large schooner--I  estimated her to be one hundred and eighty tons burthen at the least; I  verified the statement that her hull was painted all black from the rail  to the top of her copper; that she showed an enormous spread of canvas;  and that she sat very low in the water.  But I noticed a few other  peculiarities as well; I saw that her bowsprit was painted black, while  her jib-booms were scraped and varnished; that her foremast, fore-  topmast, and fore-topgallant and royal-mast were varnished, while the  mast heads were painted black, and that the whole of the mainmast, from  the cap down, was painted _white_, which was a peculiarity that ought to  have been sufficient to identify her as far as one could see her.  And  so it was; for the moment that I reported it the skipper hailed--    \"Thank you, Mr Fortescue; that will do; you may come down.  Or--hold on  a minute.  Is the stranger far enough out of the river to enable her to  get clear away, think ye?\"    \"She is fully a mile from the mouth of the river, sir,\" I answered.    \"Ah, that will do, then, thank you; you may both come down,\" answered  the skipper.  And as I swung myself down through the cross-trees to the  topmast rigging, I heard him give the order to \"Wear ship and make  sail.\"    Five minutes later the _Psyche_ was heading to the northward, close-  hauled on the port tack, under all plain sail to her royals, doing  nearly seven knots, and laying a course that, with nice steering, would  just enable us to fetch the river's mouth handsomely without breaking  tacks.  The schooner, meanwhile, was romping along at a pace of at least  twelve knots per hour, on the starboard tack, throwing the spray over  her weather bow to half the height of her lower yard, and shaping a  course which would enable her to pass us at a distance of fully eight  miles dead to windward.  We allowed her to go on her way unmolested.    It was just noon when, having arrived off the mouth of the river, we  made a flying moor of it, letting go the first and then the second bower  anchor in ten fathoms, at a distance of about one and a half miles from  the shore, and at a spot from which the river mouth and perhaps half a  mile of the river itself were in plain view.  The town of King Olomba,  it was understood, was situated at a distance of about thirty-two miles  from our anchorage; and as the captain was anxious that the journey  should be made at an easy pace, so that the men might arrive  comparatively fresh, and in fit condition for the rather stiff bit of  work that lay at the end of it, eight hours were to be allowed for the  passage of the boats to their destination.  And as it was highly  undesirable that the expedition should be unduly exposed in the boats to  the pestiferous effects of the miasmatic night-fogs which gather upon  most of the West African rivers after sunset, it had already been  arranged that the attacking party should not start until the following  morning, at an hour which would enable us to reach the scene of  operations in time to make a reconnaissance and arrange the plan of  attack by nightfall.  The remainder of that day was therefore employed  in getting the boats ready, stocking them with three days' rations of  provisions and water, overhauling the boat guns and slinging them ready  for lowering, filling the ammunition boxes, sharpening cutlasses, fixing  new flints to the pistols, where necessary, and generally completing our  preparations.  We also sent down royal and topgallant yards and housed  the topgallant-masts, in order that, should it by any chance come on to  blow heavily from the westward during our absence the ship might ride  the more easily at her anchors.  We also made preparation, in view of  the foregoing contingency, for backing the bowers with the two stream  anchors, and otherwise made every possible preparation for the safety of  the ship during our absence; for the expedition in which we were about  to engage was one of very considerable importance, and the task which we  had set ourselves to perform was so formidable that, in order to insure  success, it would be necessary to employ practically the entire ship's  company, leaving the vessel in charge of the second lieutenant and only  enough hands to keep a look-out and perform such tasks as, for example,  the letting go of the stream anchors in case of necessity, the paying  out of the additional amount of cable, the keeping of the ship  reasonably clean, and so on.    On the following morning, having washed decks and partaken of breakfast,  the hands were mustered and inspected, the boats lowered, guns secured  in the bows of the launch, pinnace, and first and second cutters,  ammunition boxes passed down, masts stepped, sails cast loose, yards  hooked on, and, in short, everything made ready for a start.  Then we  went down over the side and took our places in the boats to which we  were severally appointed, the captain going as usual in his own gig,  while Mr Perry, the first luff, was in command of the launch; Mr  Hoskins, the third lieutenant, commanding the pinnace; Mr Marline, the  master, having charge of the first cutter, while Mr Tompson, the  gunner, commanded the second cutter.  The skipper took me, as he  generally did, in his own boat, but the other three mids. were left on  board the _Psyche_ to keep Mr Purchase company.  For the rest, Nugent,  the master's mate, went with the first lieutenant, while Peter Futtock,  the boatswain, accompanied the third lieutenant in the pinnace.    We mustered ninety all told, and were none too many for the work that we  had undertaken to do, which was--to capture three, if not four, large  ships; capture and demolish the shore batteries which the slavers very  frequently erected for the defence of their strongholds; and also, most  likely, fight King Olomba and a whole flotilla of war canoes.  The task  was indeed a formidable one; the more so that we, the attacking party,  would be, at least at the beginning of the fight, huddled closely  together in boats, while our antagonists would have all the advantage of  roomy decks to move about on, and steady gun platforms from which to  pour in their fire, to say nothing of a tremendous superiority in point  of numbers.  We thought nothing of all this, however; we were going to  have a change from the monotony of shipboard life; we should be certain  to see new sights of a more or less interesting character; there was the  excitement and exhilaration of a stiff fight awaiting us at the end of  our journey; and, finally, there was the prospect of a pocketful of  prize-money as a wind-up to the whole affair.  What more could any  reasonable individual desire?    Like most African rivers, the Fernan Vaz has a bar, but the sea breaks  upon it only when the wind blows fresh from the north-west, owing to the  fact that as far up as the town of Olomba the river flows parallel to  the line of coast, being separated from the open Atlantic by a low,  sandy peninsula, varying from one to three miles in breadth, terminating  in a spit which ordinarily shelters the bar from the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21077"],[0,"The Mind and the Brain (#5)"],[1,"with, the perception we have  of this last.    If we open a work on physics or physiology we shall note with  astonishment how the above considerations are misunderstood. Observers  of nature who seek, and rightly, to give the maximum of exactness to  their observations, show that they are obsessed by one constant  prejudice: they mistrust sensation.    A great part of their efforts consists, by what they say, in reducing  the role of sensation to its fitting part in science; and the  invention of mechanical aids to observation is constantly held up as a  means of remedying the imperfection of our senses. In physics the  thermometer replaces the sensation of heat that our skin--our hand,  for example--experiences by the measurable elevation of a column of  mercury, and the scale-pan of a precise balance takes the place of the  vague sensation of trifling weights; in physiology a registering  apparatus replaces the sensation of the pulse which the doctor feels  with the end of his forefinger by a line on paper traced with  indelible ink, of which the duration and the intensity, as well as the  varied combinations of these two elements, can be measured line by  line.    Learned men who pride themselves on their philosophical attainments  vaunt in very eloquent words the superiority of the physical  instrument over mere sensation. Evidently, however, the earnestness of  this eulogy leads them astray. The most perfect registering apparatus  must, in the long-run, after its most scientific operations, address  itself to our senses and produce in us some small sensation. The  reading of the height reached by the column of mercury in a  thermometer when heated is accomplished by a visual sensation, and it  is by the sight that the movements of the balance are controlled; and  that the traces of the sphygmograph are analysed. We may readily admit  to physicists and physiologists all the advantages of these apparatus.  This is not the question. It simply proves that there are sensations  and sensations, and that certain of these are better and more precise  than others. The visual sensation of relation in space seems to be  _par excellence_ the scientific sensation which it is sought to  substitute for all the rest. But, after all, it is but a sensation.    Let us recognise that there is, in all this contempt on the part of  physicists for sensation, only differences in language, and that a  paraphrase would suffice to correct them without leaving any trace. Be  it so. But something graver remains. When one is convinced that our  knowledge of the outer world is limited to sensations, we can no  longer understand how it is possible to give oneself up, as physicists  do, to speculations upon the constitution of matter.    Up to the present there have been three principal ways of explaining  the physical phenomena of the universe. The first, the most abstract,  and the furthest from reality, is above all verbal. It consists in the  use of formulas in which the quality of the phenomena is replaced by  their magnitude, in which this magnitude, ascertained by the most  precise processes of measurement, becomes the object of abstract  reasoning which allows its modifications to be foreseen under given  experimental conditions. This is pure mathematics, a formal science  depending upon logic. Another conception, less restricted than the  above, and of fairly recent date, consists in treating all  manifestations of nature as forms of energy. This term \"energy\" has a  very vague content. At the most it expresses but two things: first, it  is based on a faint recollection of muscular force, and it reminds one  dimly of the sensation experienced when clenching the fists; and,  secondly, it betrays a kind of very natural respect for the forces of  nature which, in all the images man has made of them, constantly  appear superior to his own. We may say \"the energy of nature;\" but we  should never say, what would be experimentally correct; \"the weakness  of nature.\" The word \"weakness\" we reserve for ourselves. Apart from  these undecided suggestions, the term energy is quite the proper term  to designate phenomena, the intimate nature of which we do not seek to  penetrate, but of which we only wish to ascertain the laws and measure  the degrees.    A third conception, more imaginative and bolder than the others, is  the mechanical or kinetic theory. This last absolutely desires that we  should represent to ourselves, that we should imagine, how phenomena  really take place; and in seeking for the property of nature the most  clearly perceived, the easiest to define and analyse, and the most apt  to lend itself to measurement and calculation, it has chosen motion.  Consequently all the properties of matter have been reduced to this  one, and in spite of the apparent contradiction of our senses, it has  been supposed that the most varied phenomena are produced, in the last  resort, by the displacement of material particles. Thus, sound, light,  heat, electricity, and even the nervous influx would be due to  vibratory movements, varying only by their direction and their  periods, and all nature is thus explained as a problem of animated  geometry. This last theory, which has proved very fertile in  explanations of the most delicate phenomena of sound and light, has so  strongly impressed many minds that it has led them to declare that  the explanation of phenomena by the laws of mechanics alone has the  character of a scientific explanation. Even recently, it seemed heresy  to combat these ideas.    Still more recently, however, a revulsion of opinion has taken place.  Against the physicists, the mathematicians in particular have risen  up, and taking their stand on science, have demonstrated that all the  mechanisms invented have crowds of defects. First, in each particular  case, there is such a complication that that which is defined is much  more simple than the definition; then there is such a want of unity  that quite special mechanisms adapted to each phenomenal detail have  to be imagined; and, lastly--most serious argument of all--so much  comprehensiveness and suppleness is employed, that no experimental law  is found which cannot be understood mechanically, and no fact of  observation which shows an error in the mechanical explanation--a sure  proof that this mode of explanation has no meaning.    My way of combating the mechanical theory starts from a totally  different point of view. Psychology has every right to say a few words  here, as upon the value of every kind of scientific theory; for it is  acquainted with the nature of the mental needs of which these theories  are the expression and which these theories seek to satisfy. It has  not yet been sufficiently noticed that psychology does not allow  itself to be confined, like physics or sociology, within the logical  table of human knowledge, for it has, by a unique privilege, a right  of supervision over the other sciences. We shall see that the  psychological discussion of mechanics has a wider range than that of  the mathematicians.    Since our cognition cannot go beyond sensation, shall we first recall  what meaning can be given to an explanation of the inmost nature of  matter? It can only be an artifice, a symbol, or a process convenient  for classification in order to combine the very different qualities of  things in one unifying synthesis--a process having nearly the same  theoretical value as a _memoria technica_, which, by substituting  letters for figures, helps us to retain the latter in our minds. This  does not mean that figures are, in fact, letters, but it is a  conventional substitution which has a practical advantage. What  _memoria technica_ is to the ordinary memory, the theory of mechanics  should be for our needed unification.    Unfortunately, this is not so. The excuse we are trying to make for  the mechanicians is illusory. There is no mistaking their ambition,  Notwithstanding the prudence of some and the equivocations in which  others have rejoiced, they have drawn their definition in the absolute  and not in the relative. To take their conceptions literally, they  have thought the movement of matter to be something existing outside  our eye, our hands, and our sense; in a word, something _noumenal_, as  Kant would have said. The proof that this is their real idea, is that  movement is presented to us as the true outer and explanatory cause of  our sensations, the external excitement to our nerves. The most  elementary works on physics are impregnated with this disconcerting  conception. If we open a description of acoustics, we read that sound  and noise are subjective states which have no reality outside our  auditory apparatus; that they are sensations produced by an external  cause, which is the vibratory movement of sonorous bodies--whence the  conclusion that this vibratory movement is not itself a sensation. Or,  shall we take another proof, still more convincing. This is the  vibratory and silent movement which is invoked by physicists to  explain the peculiarities of subjective sensation; so that the  interferences, the pulsations of sound, and, in fine, the whole  physiology of the ear, is treated as a problem in kinematics, and is  explained by the composition of movements.    What kind of reality do physicists then allow to the displacements of  matter? Where do they place them, since they recognise otherwise that  the essence of matter is unknown to us? Are we to suppose that,  outside the world of _noumena_, outside the world of phenomena and  sensations, there exists a third world, an intermediary between the  two former, the world of atoms and that of mechanics?    A short examination will, moreover, suffice to show of what this  mechanical model is formed which is presented to us as constituting  the essence of matter. This can be nothing else than the sensations,  since we are incapable of perceiving or imagining"]]]
