Old father Grey Beard,    Without tooth or tongue;    If you'll give me your finger,    I'll give you my thumb.        Jockey was a piper's son,    And he fell in love when he was young,    And the only tune he could play    Was, \"Over the hills and far away\";    Over the hills and a great way off,    And the wind will blow my top-knot off.

There was an old woman in Surrey,    Who was morn, noon and night in a hurry;    Called her husband a fool,    Drove the children to school,    The worrying old woman of Surrey.        Little Tommy Grace had a pain in his face,    So bad he could not learn a letter;    When in came Dicky Long,    Singing such a funny song,    That Tommy laughed, and found his face much better.        There was an old woman had three cows,    Rosy, and Colin, and Dun;    Rosy and Colin were sold at the fair,    And Dun broke his head in a fit of despair;    And there was the end of her three cows,    Rosy, and Colin, and Dun.

The greedy man is he who sits      And bites bits out of plates,    Or else takes up an almanac      And gobbles all the dates.

An old woman lived in Nottingham town,    Who owned a small house, and painted it brown;    And yet this old woman grew crazy with fright,    Lest some one should burn her house in the night.        Bryan O'Lin and his wife, and wife's mother,    They all went over the bridge together:    The bridge broke down, and they all fell in,--    The deuce go with all! said Bryan O'Lin.        Little Miss Lily, you're dreadfully silly      To wear such a very long skirt:    If you take my advice, you would hold it up nice      And not let it trail in the dirt.

With a pair of bag-pipes under her arm:    She could sing nothing but fiddle cum fee,    The mouse has married the bumble-bee;    Pipe, cat--dance, mouse,    We'll have a wedding at our good house.

Bat, bat, come under my hat,      And I'll give you a slice of bacon;    And when I bake, I'll give you a cake,      If I am not mistaken.

Grandfather's books in the parlour--oh, they ain't books. They're  furniture.\"    But she had a little bookcase whose shelves were filled with her  patterns--in her dressmaking she never used a fashion plate.    \"I like to make 'em up and cut 'em out,\" she sometimes told her friends.  \"I don't care nothing whatever about the dresses when they get  done--more fool the women for ornamenting themselves up like lamp  shades, I always think. But I just do love to fuss with the paper and  make it do like I say. Land, I've got my cupboard full of more patterns  than I'd ever get orders for if I lived to be born again.\"    She sat down before the cooking stove and drew off her woolen mittens.  She folded a hand on her cheek, forcing the cheek out of drawing by her  hand's pressure. There was always about her gestures a curious  nakedness--indeed, about her face and hands. They were naive, perfectly  likely to reveal themselves in their current awkwardness and ugliness of  momentary expression which, by its very frankness, made a new law as it  broke an old one.    \"Don't you tell folks I've been house cleaning,\" she warned Jenny. \"The  town would think I was crazy, with the thermometer acting up zero so.  Anyway, I ain't been house cleaning. I just simply got so sick to death  of all the truck piled up in this house that I had to get away from it.  And this morning it looked so clean and white and smooth outdoors that I  felt so cluttered up I couldn't sew. I begun on this room--and then I  kept on with the parlour. I've took out the lambrequins and 'leven  pictures and the what-not and four moth-catching rugs and four sofa  pillows, and I've packed the whole lot of 'em into the attic. I've done  the same to my bedroom. I've emptied my house out of all the stuff the  folks' and the folks' folks and their folks--clear back to Grandmother  Hackett had in here--I mean the truck part. Not the good. And I guess  now I've got some room to live in.\"    Jenny looked at her admiringly, and asked: \"How did you ever do it? I  can't bear to throw things away. I can't bear to move things from where  they've been.\"    \"I didn't use to want to,\" said Mary, \"but lately--I do. The Winter's so  clean, you kind of have to, to keep up. What's the news?\"    \"Here's a letter,\" Jenny said, and handed it. \"I didn't look to see who  it's from. I guess it's a strange Writing, anyway.\"    Mary glanced indifferently at it. \"It's from Lily's boy, out West,\" she  said, and laid the letter on the shelf. \"I meant, what's the news about  you?\"    Jenny's eyes widened swiftly. \"News about me?\" she said. \"Who said there  was any news about me?\"    \"Nobody,\" Mary said evenly; \"but you've been gone most a year, ain't  you?\"    \"Oh,\" Jenny said, \"yes....\"    For really, when Old Trail Town stopped to think of it, Jenny Wing was  Mrs. Bruce Rule, and had been so for a year. But no one thought of  calling her that. It always takes Old Trail Town several years to adopt  its marriages. They would graduate first to \"Jenny Wing that was,\" and  then to \"Jenny Wing What's-name,\" and then to \"Mis' Rule that was Jenny  Wing....\"    \"... You tell me some news,\" Jenny added. \"Mother don't ever write much  but the necessaries.\"    \"That's all there's been,\" Mary Chavah told her; \"we ain't had no  luxuries for news in forever.\"    \"But there's that notice in the post office,\" cried Jenny. \"I come home  to spend Christmas, and there's that notice in the post office. Mother  wrote nobody was going to do anything for Christmas, but she never wrote  me that. I've brought home some little things I made----\"    \"Oh--Christmas!\" Mary said. \"Yes, they all got together and concluded  best not have any. You know, since the failure--\"    Mary hesitated--Ebenezer Rule was Bruce Rule's uncle.    \"I know,\" said Jenny, \"it's Uncle Ebenezer. I don't know how I'm going  to tell Bruce when he comes. To think it's in our family, the reason  they can't have any Christmas....\"    \"Nonsense,\" said Mary, briskly; \"no Christmas presents is real  sensible, my way of thinking. It's been 'leven years since I've given a  Christmas present to anybody. The first Christmas after mother died, I  couldn't--I just couldn't. That kind of got me out of the idea, and  then I see all the nonsense of it.\"    \"The _nonsense_?\" Jenny repeated.    \"If you don't like folks, you don't want to give nothing to them or take  nothing from them. And if you do like 'em you don't want to have to wait  to Christmas to give 'em things. Ain't that so?\" Mary Chavah put it.    \"_No_,\" said Jenny; \"it ain't. Not a bit so.\" And when Mary laughed,  questioned her, pressed her, \"It seems perfectly awful to me not to have  a Christmas,\" Jenny could say only, \"I feel like the Winter didn't have  no backbone to it.\"    \"It's a dead time, Winter,\" Mary assented. \"What's the use of tricking  it up with gewgaws and pretending it's a live time? Besides, if you  ain't got the money, you ain't got the money. And nobody has, this year.  Unless they go ahead and buy things anyway, like the City.\"    Jenny shook her head. \"I got seven Christmas-present relatives and ten  Christmas-present friends, and I've only spent Two Dollars and Eighty  cents on 'em all,\" she said, \"for material. But I've made little things  for every one of 'em. It don't seem as if that much had ought to hurt  any one.\"    Jenny looked past her out the window, somewhere beyond the snow.    \"They's something else,\" she added, \"it ain't all present giving....\"    \"Nonsense,\" said Mary Chavah, \"take the present trading away from  Christmas and see how long it'd last. I was in the City once for  Christmas. I'll never forget it--never. I never see folks work like the  folks worked there. The streets was Bedlam. The stores was worse.  'What'll I get him?...' 'I've just got to get something for her....' 'It  don't seem as if this is nice enough after what she give me last  year....' I can hear 'em yet. They spent money wicked. And I said to  myself that I was glad from my head to my feet that I was done with  Christmas. And I been preaching it ever since. And I'm pleased this town  has had to come to it.\"    \"It ain't the way I feel,\" said Jenny. She got up and wandered to the  window and hardly heard while Mary went on with more of the sort. \"It  seems kind of like going back on the ways things are,\" Jenny said, as  she turned. Then, as she made ready to go, she broke off and smote her  hands together.    \"Oh,\" she said, \"it don't seem as if I could bear it not to have  Christmas--not _this_ year.\"    \"You mean your and Bruce's first Christmas,\" said Mary. \"Mark my words,  he'll be glad to be rid of the fuss. Men always are. Come on out the  front door if you're going,\" said Mary. \"You might as well use it when  it's open.\"    As Jenny passed the open parlour door, she looked in again at the bare  room.    \"Don't you _like_ pictures?\" she asked abruptly.    \"I like 'em when I like 'em,\" Mary answered. \"I didn't like them I had  up here--I had a shot stag and a fruit piece and an eagle with a child  in its claws. I've loathed 'em for years, but I ain't ever had the heart  to throw 'em out till now. They're over behind the coal bin.\"    Jenny thought. \"They's a picture over to mother's,\" she said, \"that she  ain't put up because she ain't had the money to frame it. I guess I'll  bring it over after supper and see if you don't want it up here--frame  or no frame.\" She looked at Mary and laughed. \"If I bring it to you  to-night,\" she said, \"it ain't a Christmas present--legal. But if I want  to call it a Christmas present inside me, the town can't help that.\"    \"What's the picture?\" Mary asked.    \"I don't know who it represents,\" said Jenny, \"but it's nice.\"    When Jenny had gone, Mary Chavah stood in the snow shaking the rug she  had left outside, and looking at the clean, white town.    \"It looks like it was waiting for something,\" she thought.    A door opened and shut. A child shouted. In the north east a shining  body had come sparkling above the trees--Capella of the brightness of  one hundred of our suns, being born into the twilight like a little  star....    Mary closed the parlour windows and stood for a moment immersed in the  quiet and emptiness of the clean rooms.    \"This looks like it was waiting for something, too,\" she thought. \"But  it ought to know it won't get it,\" she added whimsically.    Then she went back to the warm room and saw the letter on the shelf. She  meant to go in a moment to the stable to make it safe there for the  night; so, with the gray shawl still binding her head and falling to her  feet, she sat by the stove and read the letter.          V           \"... because she wasn't sick but two days and we never thought of       her dying till she was dead. Otherwise we'd have telegraphed. She       was buried yesterday, right here, and we'll get some kind of stone.       You say how you think it'd ought to be marked. That's about all       there is to tell except about _Yes_. He's six years old now and       Aunt Mary this ain't a place for him. He's a nice little fellow and       I hate for him to get rough and he will if he stays here. I'll do       the best I can and earn money to help keep him but I want he should       come and live with you....\"    \"I won't have him!\" said Mary Chavah, aloud.         \"... he could come alone with a tag all right and I could send his       things by freight.
