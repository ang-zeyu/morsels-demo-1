Wendell Phillips said that the glory of free men is that  they trample unjust laws under their feet. That is how they repeal them.  If a human being submits to having his lips sealed, to be in silence  reduced to vassalage, he may have all else, but he is still lacking in  all that dignifies and glorifies real manhood.    \"Now, notwithstanding this fundamental provision in the national law,  Socialists' meetings have been broken up all over this country.  Socialist speakers have been arrested by hundreds and flung into jail,  where many of them are lying now. In some cases not even a charge was  lodged against them--guilty of no crime except the crime of attempting  to exercise the right guaranteed to them by the Constitution of the  United States.    \"I have told you that I am no lawyer, but it seems to me that I know  enough to know that if Congress enacts any law that conflicts with this  provision in the Constitution, that law is void. If the Espionage law  finally stands, then the Constitution of the United States is dead. If  that law is not the negation of every fundamental principle established  by the Constitution, then certainly I am unable to read or to understand  the English language.    \"War does not come by chance. War is not the result of accident. There  is a definite cause for war, especially a modern war. The war that began  in Europe can readily be accounted for. For the last forty years, under  this international capitalist system, this exploiting system, these  various nations of Europe have been preparing for the inevitable. And  why? In all these nations the great industries are owned by a relatively  small class. They are operated for the profit of that class. And great  abundance is produced by the workers, but their wages will only buy back  a small part of their product. What is the result? They have a vast  surplus on hand; they have got to export it; they have got to find a  foreign market for it. As a result of this, these nations are pitted  against each other. They begin to arm themselves to open, to maintain  the market and quickly dispose of their surplus. There is but the one  market. All these nations are competitors for it, and sooner or later  every war of trade becomes a war of blood.    \"Now, where there is exploitation there must be some form of militarism  to support it. Wherever you find exploitation you find some form of  military force. In a smaller way you find it in this country. It was  there long before war was declared. For instance, when the miners out in  Colorado entered upon a strike about four years ago, the state militia,  that is under the control of the Standard Oil Company, marched upon a  camp, where the miners and their wives and children were in tents. And  by the way, a report of this strike was issued by the United States  Commission on Industrial Relations. When the soldiers approached the  camp at Ludlow, where these miners, with their wives and children, were,  the miners, to prove that they were patriotic, placed flags above their  tents, and when the state militia, that is paid by Rockefeller and  controlled by Rockefeller, swooped down upon that camp, the first thing  they did was to shoot those United States flags into tatters. Not one  of them was indicted or tried because he was a traitor to his country.  Pregnant women were killed, and a number of innocent children slain.  This in the United States of America,--the fruit of exploitation. The  miners wanted a little more of what they had been producing. But the  Standard Oil Company wasn't rich enough. It insisted that all they were  entitled to was just enough to keep them in working order. There is  slavery for you. And when at last they protested, when they were  tormented by hunger, when they saw their children in tatters, they were  shot down as if they had been so many vagabond dogs.    \"And while I am upon this point, let me say just another word. Working  men who organize, and who sometimes commit overt acts, are very often  condemned by those who have no conception of the conditions under which  they live. How many men are there, for instance, who know anything of  their own knowledge about how men work in a lumber camp--a logging camp,  a turpentine camp? In this report of the United States Commission on  Industrial Relations, you will find the statement proved that peonage  existed in the state of Texas. Out of these conditions springs such a  thing as the I. W. W.--when men receive a pittance for their pay, when  they work like galley slaves for a wage that barely suffices to keep  their protesting souls within their tattered bodies. When they can  endure the condition no longer, and they make some sort of a  demonstration, or perhaps commit acts of violence, how quickly are they  condemned by those who do not know anything about the conditions under  which they work.    \"Five gentlemen of distinction, among them Professor John Graham Brooks,  of Harvard University, said that a word that so fills the world as the  I. W. W. must have something in it. It must be investigated. And they  did investigate it, each along their own lines; and I wish it were  possible for every man and woman in this country to read the result of  their investigation. They tell you why and how the I. W. W. was  instituted. They tell you, moreover, that the great corporations, such  as the Standard Oil Company, such as the Coal Trust, and the Lumber  Trust, have, through their agents, committed more crimes against the I.  W. W. than the I. W. W. have ever committed against them.    \"I was asked not long ago if I was in favor of shooting our soldiers in  the back. I said, 'No. I would not shoot them in the back. I wouldn't  shoot them at all. I would not have them shot.' Much has been made of a  statement that I declared that men were fit for something better than  slavery and cannon fodder. I made the statement. I make no attempt to  deny it. I meant exactly what I said. Men are fit for something better  than slavery and cannon fodder; and the time will come, though I shall  not live to see it, when slavery will be wiped from the earth, and when  men will marvel that there ever was a time when men who called  themselves civilized rushed upon each other like wild beasts and  murdered one another, by methods so cruel and barbarous that they defy  the power of language to describe. I can hear the shrieks of the  soldiers of Europe in my dreams. I have imagination enough to see a  battlefield. I can see it strewn with the wrecks of human beings, who  but yesterday were in the flush and glory of their young manhood. I can  see them at eventide, scattered about in remnants, their limbs torn from  their bodies, their eyes gouged out. Yes, I can see them, and I can hear  them. I look above and beyond this frightful scene. I think of the  mothers who are bowed in the shadow of their last great grief--whose  hearts are breaking. And I say to myself: 'I am going to do the little  that lies in my power to wipe from this earth that terrible scourge of  war.'    \"If I believed in war I could not be kept out of the first line  trenches. I would not be patriotic at long range. I would be honest  enough, if I believed in bloodshed, to shed my own. But I do not believe  that the shedding of blood bears any actual testimony to patriotism, to  love of country, to civilization. On the contrary, I believe that  warfare in all of its forms is an impeachment of our social order, and a  rebuke to our vaunted Christian civilization.    \"And now, gentlemen of the jury, I am not going to detain you too long.  I wish to admit everything that has been said respecting me from this  witness chair. I wish to admit everything that has been charged against  me except what is embraced in the indictment from which I have read to  you. I cannot take back a word. I cannot repudiate a sentence. I stand  before you guilty of having made this speech. I stand before you  prepared to accept the consequences of what there is embraced in that  speech. I do not know, I cannot tell, what your verdict may be; nor does  it matter much, so far as I am concerned.    \"Gentlemen, I am the smallest part of this trial. I have lived long  enough to appreciate my own personal insignificance in relation to a  great issue, that involves the welfare of the whole people. What you may  choose to do to me will be of small consequence after all. I am not on  trial here. There is an infinitely greater issue that is being tried  today in this court, though you may not be conscious of it. American  institutions are on trial here before a court of American citizens. The  future will tell.\"      5. DEBS TALKS TO THE JUDGE    The jury found Eugene Debs guilty and on Saturday morning the judge  pronounced sentence. Before the sentence was given, Debs had another  opportunity to tell someone about Socialism--this time it was the judge.    Debs never loses a chance. When the clerk asked him whether he had  anything to say he made another Socialist speech. Said he:    \"Your Honor, years ago I recognized my kinship with all living beings,  and I made up my mind that I was not one bit better than the meanest of  earth. I said then, I say now, that while there is a lower class, I am  in it; while there is a criminal element, I am of it; while there is a  soul in prison, I am not free....    \"If the law under which I have been convicted is a good law, then there  is no reason why sentence should not be pronounced upon me. I listened  to all that was said in this court in support and justification of this  law, but my mind remains unchanged. I look upon it as a despotic  enactment in flagrant conflict with democratic principles and with the  spirit of free institutions.    \"Your Honor, I have stated in this court that I am opposed to the form  of our present Government; that I am opposed to the social system in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2069"],[0,"The Religion of Babylonia and Assyria (#5)"],[1,"god  of the heavens.                                    The gods.    Here the narrative is defective, and is continued by Damascius in his  /Doubts and Solutions of the First Principles/, in which he states  that, after Anos (Anu), come Illinos (Ellila or Bel, \"the lord\" /par  excellence/) and Aos (Aa, Ae, or Ea), the god of Eridu. Of Aos and  Dauke (the Babylonian Aa and Damkina) is born, he says, a son called  Belos (Bel-Merodach), who, they (apparently the Babylonians) say, is  the fabricator of the world--the creator.                            The designs against them.    At this point Damascius ends his extract, and the Babylonian tablet  also becomes extremely defective. The next deity to come into  existence, however, would seem to have been Nudimmud, who was  apparently the deity Aa or Ea (the god of the sea and of rivers) as  the god of creation. Among the children of Tauthe (Tiawath) enumerated  by Damascius is one named Moumis, who was evidently referred to in the  document at that philosopher's disposal. If this be correct, his name,  under the form of Mummu, probably existed in one of the defective  lines of the first portion of this legend--in any case, his name  occurs later on, with those of Tiawath and Apsu (the Deep), his  parents, and the three seem to be compared, to their disadvantage,  with the progeny of Lahmu and Lahame, the gods on high. As the ways of  these last were not those of Tiawath's brood, and Apsu complained that  he had no peace by day nor rest by night on account of their  proceedings, the three representatives of the chaotic deep, Tiawath,  Apsu, and Mummu, discussed how they might get rid the beings who  wished to rise to higher things. Mummu was apparently the prime mover  in the plot, and the face of Apsu grew bright at the thought of the  evil plan which they had devised against \"the gods their sons.\" The  inscription being very mutilated here, its full drift cannot be  gathered, but from the complete portions which come later it would  seem that Mummu's plan was not a remarkably cunning one, being simply  to make war upon and destroy the gods of heaven.                             Tiawath's preparations.    The preparations made for this were elaborate. Restlessly, day and  night, the powers of evil raged and toiled, and assembled for the  fight. \"Mother Hubur,\" as Tiawath is named in this passage, called her  creative powers into action, and gave her followers irresistible  weapons. She brought into being also various monsters--giant serpents,  sharp of tooth, bearing stings, and with poison filling their bodies  like blood; terrible dragons endowed with brilliance, and of enormous  stature, reared on high, raging dogs, scorpion-men, fish-men, and many  other terrible beings, were created and equipped, the whole being  placed under the command of a deity named Kingu, whom she calls her  \"only husband,\" and to whom she delivers the tablets of fate, which  conferred upon him the godhead of Anu (the heavens), and enabled their  possessor to determine the gates among the gods her sons.                               Kingu replaces Absu.    The change in the narrative which comes in here suggests that this is  the point at which two legends current in Babylonia were united.  Henceforward we hear nothing more of Apsu, the begetter of all things,  Tiawath's spouse, nor of Mummu, their son. In all probability there is  good reason for this, and inscriptions will doubtless ultimately be  found which will explain it, but until then it is only natural to  suppose that two different legends have been pieced together to form a  harmonious whole.                                  Tiawath's aim.    As will be gathered from the above, the story centres in the wish of  the goddess of the powers of evil and her kindred to retain creation--the  forming of all living things--in her own hands. As Tiawath means  \"the sea,\" and Apsu \"the deep,\" it is probable that this is a kind of  allegory personifying the productive power seen in the teeming life of  the ocean, and typifying the strange and wonderful forms found  therein, which were symbolical, to the Babylonian mind, of chaos and  confusion, as well as of evil.                         The gods hear of the conspiracy.    Aa, or Ea, having learned of the plot of Tiawath and her followers  against the gods of heaven, naturally became filled with anger, and  went and told the whole to Ansar, his father, who in his turn gave way  to his wrath, and uttered cries of the deepest grief. After  considering what they would do, Ansar applied to his son Anu, \"the  mighty and brave,\" saying that, if he would only speak to her, the  great dragon's anger would be assuaged, and her rage disappear. In  obedience to this behest, Anu went to try his power with the monster,  but on beholding her snarling face, feared to approach her, and turned  back. Nudimmud was next called upon to become the representative of  the gods against their foe, but his success was as that of Anu, and it  became needful to seek another champion.                      And choose Merodach as their champion.    The choice fell upon Merodach, the Belus (Bel-Merodach) of Damascius's  paraphrase, and at once met with an enthusiastic reception. The god  asked simply that an \"unchangeable command\" might be given to him--that  whatever he ordained should without fail come to pass, in order  that he might destroy the common enemy. Invitations were sent to the  gods asking them to a festival, where, having met together, they ate  and drank, and \"decided the fate\" for Merodach their avenger,  apparently meaning that he was decreed their defender in the conflict  with Tiawath, and that the power of creating and annihilating by the  word of his mouth was his. Honours were then conferred upon him;  princely chambers were erected for him, wherein he sat as judge \"in  the presence of his fathers,\" and the rule over the whole universe was  given to him. The testing of his newly acquired power followed. A  garment was placed in their midst:      \"He spake with his mouth, and the garment was destroyed,    He spake to it again, and the garment was reproduced.\"                            Merodach proclaimed king.    On this proof of the reality of the powers conferred on him, all the  gods shouted \"Merodach is king!\" and handed to him sceptre, throne,  and insignia of royalty. An irresistible weapon, which should shatter  all his enemies, was then given to him, and he armed himself also with  spear or dart, bow, and quiver; lightning flashed before him, and  flaming fire filled his body. Anu, the god of the heavens, had given  him a great net, and this he set at the four cardinal points, in order  that nothing of the dragon, when he had defeated her, should escape.  Seven winds he then created to accompany him, and the great weapon  called /Abubu/, \"the Flood,\" completed his equipment. All being ready,  he mounted his dreadful, irresistible chariot, to which four steeds  were yoked--steeds unsparing, rushing forward, rapid in flight, their  teeth full of venom, foam-covered, experienced in galloping, schooled  in overthrowing. Being now ready for the fray, Merodach fared forth to  meet Tiawath, accompanied by the fervent good wishes of \"the gods his  fathers.\"                             The fight with Tiawath.    Advancing, he regarded Tiawath's retreat, but the sight of the enemy  was so menacing that even the great Merodach (if we understand the  text rightly) began to falter. This, however, was not for long, and  the king of the gods stood before Tiawath, who, on her side, remained  firm and undaunted. In a somewhat long speech, in which he reproaches  Tiawath for her rebellion, he challenges her to battle, and the two  meet in fiercest fight. To all appearance the type of all evil did not  make use of honest weapons, but sought to overcome the king of the  gods with incantations and charms. These, however, had not the  slightest effect, for she found herself at once enclosed in Merodach's  net, and on opening her mouth to resist and free herself, the evil  wind, which Merodach had sent on before him, entered, so that she  could not close her lips, and thus inflated, her heart was  overpowered, and she became a prey to her conqueror. Having cut her  asunder and taken out her heart, thus destroying her life, he threw  her body down and stood thereon. Her followers then attempted to  escape, but found themselves surrounded and unable to get forth. Like  their mistress, they were thrown into the net, and sat in bonds, being  afterwards shut up in prison. As for Kingu, he was raised up, bound,  and delivered to be with Ugga, the god of death. The tablets of fate,  which Tiawath had delivered to Kingu, were taken from him by Merodach,  who pressed his seal upon them, and placed them in his breast. The  deity Ansar, who had been, as it would seem, deprived of his rightful  power by Tiawath, received that power again on the death of the common  foe, and Nudimmud \"saw his desire upon his enemy.\"                                 Tiawath's fate.    The dismemberment of Tiawath then followed, and her veins having been  cut through, the north wind was caused by the deity to carry her blood  away into secret places, a statement which probably typifies the  opening of obstructions which prevent the rivers flowing from the  north from running into the southern seas, helped thereto by the north  wind. Finally her body was divided, like \"a /masde/-fish,\" into two  parts, one of which was made into a covering for the heavens--the  \"waters above the firmament\" of Genesis i. 7.                         Merodach orders the world anew.    Then came the ordering of the universe anew. Having made a covering  for the heavens with half the body of the defeated Dragon of Chaos,  Merodach set the Abyss, the abode of Nudimmud, in front, and made a  corresponding edifice above--the heavens--where he founded stations  for"]]]
