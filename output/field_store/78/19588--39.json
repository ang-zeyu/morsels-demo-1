The  child's name was Ernest. \"Mother,\" said he, while the Titanic visage  smiled on him, \"I wish that it could speak, for it looks so very kindly  that its voice must be pleasant. If I were to see a man with such a  face, I should love him dearly.\"    \"If an old prophecy should come to pass,\" answered his mother, \"we may  see a man, some time or other, with exactly such a face as that.\"    \"What prophecy do you mean, dear mother?\" eagerly inquired Ernest. \"Pray  tell me all about it!\"    So his mother told him a story that her own mother had told to her, when  she herself was younger than little Ernest; a story, not of things that  were past, but of what was yet to come; a story, nevertheless, so very  old that even the Indians, who formerly inhabited this valley, had heard  it from their forefathers, to whom, they believed, it had been murmured  by the mountain streams, and whispered by the wind among the tree tops.  The story said that at some future day a child should be born hereabouts  who was destined to become the greatest and noblest man of his time, and  whose countenance, in manhood, should bear an exact resemblance to the  Great Stone Face.    \"O mother, dear mother!\" cried Ernest, clapping his hands above his  head, \"I do hope that I shall live to see him!\" His mother was an  affectionate and thoughtful woman, and felt that it was wisest not to  discourage the hopes of her little boy. She only said to him, \"Perhaps  you may,\" little thinking that the prophecy would one day come true.    And Ernest never forgot the story that his mother told him. It was  always in his mind whenever he looked upon the Great Stone Face. He  spent his childhood in the log cottage where he was born, and was  dutiful to his mother, and helpful to her in many things, assisting her  much with his little hands, and more with his loving heart. In this  manner, from a happy yet thoughtful child, he grew to be a mild, quiet,  modest boy, sun-browned with labor in the fields, but with more  intelligence in his face than is seen in many lads who have been taught  at famous schools. Yet Ernest had had no teacher, save only that the  Great Stone Face became one to him. When the toil of the day was over,  he would gaze at it for hours, until he began to imagine that those vast  features recognized him, and gave him a smile of kindness and  encouragement in response to his own look of [v]veneration. We must not  take upon us to affirm that this was a mistake, although the Face may  have looked no more kindly at Ernest than at all the world besides. For  the secret was that the boy's tender simplicity [v]discerned what other  people could not see; and thus the love, which was meant for all, became  his alone.      II    About this time, there went a rumor throughout the valley that the great  man, foretold from ages long ago, who was to bear a resemblance to the  Great Stone Face, had appeared at last. It seems that, many years  before, a young man had left the valley and settled at a distant  seaport, where, after getting together a little money, he had set up as  a shopkeeper. His name--but I could never learn whether it was his real  one, or a nickname that had grown out of his habits and success in  life--was Gathergold.    It might be said of him, as of [v]Midas in the fable, that whatever he  touched with his finger immediately glistened, and grew yellow, and was  changed at once into coin. And when Mr. Gathergold had become so rich  that it would have taken him a hundred years only to count his wealth,  he bethought himself of his native valley, and resolved to go back  thither, and end his days where he was born. With this purpose in view,  he sent a skillful architect to build him such a palace as should be fit  for a man of his vast wealth to live in.    As I have said above, it had already been rumored in the valley that Mr.  Gathergold had turned out to be the person so long and vainly looked  for, and that his visage was the perfect and undeniable likeness of the  Great Stone Face. People were the more ready to believe that this must  needs be the fact when they beheld the splendid edifice that rose, as if  by enchantment, on the site of his father's old weather-beaten  farmhouse. The exterior was of marble, so dazzling white that it seemed  as though the whole structure might melt away in the sunshine, like  those humbler ones which Mr. Gathergold, in his young playdays, had been  accustomed to build of snow. It had a richly ornamented portico,  supported by tall pillars, beneath which was a lofty door, studded with  silver knobs, and made of a kind of variegated wood that had been  brought from beyond the sea. The windows, from the floor to the ceiling  of each stately apartment, were each composed of but one enormous pane  of glass. Hardly anybody had been permitted to see the interior of this  palace; but it was reported to be far more gorgeous than the outside,  insomuch that whatever was iron or brass in other houses was silver or  gold in this; and Mr. Gathergold's bedchamber, especially, made such a  glittering appearance that no ordinary man would have been able to close  his eyes there. But, on the other hand, Mr. Gathergold was now so  accustomed to wealth that perhaps he could not have closed his eyes  unless where the gleam of it was certain to find its way beneath his  eyelids.    In due time, the mansion was finished; next came the upholsterers, with  magnificent furniture; then a whole troop of black and white servants,  the harbingers of Mr. Gathergold, who, in his own majestic person, was  expected to arrive at sunset. Our friend Ernest, meanwhile, had been  deeply stirred by the idea that the great man, the noble man, the man of  prophecy, after so many ages of delay, was at length to appear in his  native valley. He knew, boy as he was, that there were a thousand ways  in which Mr. Gathergold, with his vast wealth, might transform himself  into an angel of beneficence, and assume a control over human affairs as  wide and [v]benignant as the smile of the Great Stone Face. Full of  faith and hope, Ernest doubted not that what the people said was true,  and that now he was to behold the living likeness of those wondrous  features on the mountain side. While the boy was still gazing up the  valley, and fancying, as he always did, that the Great Stone Face  returned his gaze and looked kindly at him, the rumbling of wheels was  heard, approaching swiftly along the winding road.    \"Here he comes!\" cried a group of people who were assembled to witness  the arrival. \"Here comes the great Mr. Gathergold!\"    A carriage, drawn by four horses, dashed round the turn of the road.  Within it, thrust partly out of the window, appeared the face of a  little old man, with a skin as yellow as gold. He had a low forehead,  small, sharp eyes, puckered about with innumerable wrinkles, and very  thin lips, which he made still thinner by pressing them forcibly  together.    \"The very image of the Great Stone Face!\" shouted the people. \"Sure  enough, the old prophecy is true.\"    And, what greatly perplexed Ernest, they seemed actually to believe that  here was the likeness which they spoke of. By the roadside there chanced  to be an old beggar woman and two little beggar children, stragglers  from some far-off region, who, as the carriage rolled onward, held out  their hands and lifted up their doleful voices, most piteously  beseeching charity. A yellow claw--the very same that had clawed  together so much wealth--poked itself out of the coach window, and  dropped some copper coins upon the ground; so that, though the great  man's name seems to have been Gathergold, he might just as suitably have  been nicknamed Scattercopper. Still, nevertheless, with an earnest  shout, and evidently with as much good faith as ever, the people  bellowed:    \"He is the very image of the Great Stone Face!\"    But Ernest turned sadly from the wrinkled shrewdness of that visage and  gazed up the valley, where, amid a gathering mist, gilded by the last  sunbeams, he could still distinguish those glorious features which had  impressed themselves into his soul. Their aspect cheered him. What did  the benign lips seem to say?    \"He will come! Fear not, Ernest; the man will come!\"    The years went on, and Ernest ceased to be a boy. He had grown to be a  young man now. He attracted little notice from the other inhabitants of  the valley, for they saw nothing remarkable in his way of life, save  that, when the labor of the day was over, he still loved to go apart and  gaze and meditate upon the Great Stone Face. According to their idea of  the matter, however, it was a pardonable folly, for Ernest was  industrious, kind, and neighborly, and neglected no duty for the sake of  this idle habit. They knew not that the Great Stone Face had become a  teacher to him, and that the sentiment which was expressed in it would  enlarge the young man's heart, and fill it with wider and deeper  sympathies than other hearts. They knew not that thence would come a  better wisdom than could be learned from books, and a better life than  could be molded on the example of other human lives. Neither did Ernest  know that the thoughts and affections which came to him so naturally, in  the fields and at the fireside, were of a higher tone than those which  all men shared with him. A simple soul,--simple as when his mother first  taught him the old prophecy,--he beheld the marvelous features beaming  down the valley, and still wondered that their human counterpart was so  long in making his appearance.    By this time poor Mr. Gathergold was dead and buried; and the oddest  part of the matter was that his wealth, which was the body and spirit of  his existence, had disappeared before his death, leaving nothing of him  but a living skeleton, covered over with a wrinkled, yellow skin. Since  the melting away of his gold, it had been very"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19722"],[0,"A Child's Garden of Verses (#5)"],[1,"again,      The kirk and the palace, the ships and the men      And as long as I live and where'er I may be,      I'll always remember my town by the sea.
