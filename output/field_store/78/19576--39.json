Such patience, perseverance, and skill must count in the long run.    His factory made him quite a rich man.    Some of the southern states showed their gratitude.    In 1817, Mr. Whitney married Miss Edwards of Connecticut.    He had a son and three daughters.    The people of New Haven respected him.    They gave him great honor.    He died on January 8, 1825.    The little cotton-gin had done a great work.    The sunny South was covered with beautiful plantations.    The cotton fields shone in the sunlight.      [Illustration]    Riches were beginning to fill the pockets of the planters.    Only one blight remained upon the land.    This was the dreadful system of slavery.    And that, too, has been destroyed.    We wish that Mr. Whitney might see the South of to-day.    He did not live to know how great a curse slavery might be.    He did not foresee that his cotton-gin might help to cause a great  war.    Yet the blue and the gray fought and died.    The blood of many a hero stained a southern field.    All this that the cotton-pickers might be free!    All this that our country might be truly \"the land of the free and  the home of the brave!\"            [Illustration: S.F.B. MORSE.]          SAMUEL FINLEY BREESE MORSE.      If everything were now as it was in 1791, what a queer place this  world of ours would be to us!    A hundred years ago!    Suppose we imagine ourselves living in the year 1800.    The railroads then were very few and poor.    \"Fulton's Folly,\" the first steamboat, had not yet frightened the  sailors in New York Harbor, with its long line of black smoke.    Lighting by means of gas was yet unknown.    Electric lights were not even dreamed of.    Even kerosene, which we think makes so poor a light, was then  unused.    So there are many, many things, common and useful to us now, which  were unknown to the world in 1800.    You have heard of the giant, Steam.    There is yet another giant which God has placed in the world for  man's use.    This is Electricity.    Is it not strange that this great power should have been so long  unused in the world?    Boys and girls can understand how useful this power now is.    So you will be interested in knowing something of the man who helped  to introduce to the world this great giant, electricity.    The baby who was given this long name, Samuel Finley Breese Morse,  was born in Charlestown, Massachusetts.    The date of his birth was April 27, 1791.    He was called Samuel Finley for his great-grandfather.    His mother's name, as a girl, was Elizabeth Breese.    You will see that he won fame enough to cover each and every one of  these names.    Finley Morse had, as he grew older, two brothers younger than  himself.    Their names were Sidney E. Morse, and Richard Cary Morse.    Finley was sent first to an old lady's school.    He was but four years old when he started.    The school was very near his home.    The school mistress was known as, \"Old Ma'am Rand.\"    She was an invalid and unable to leave her chair.    So she had a long rattan.    When the children did not mind, she could, with her long rattan,  reach them at the further side of the room.    One punishment of Mrs. Rand's was to pin a naughty child to her  dress.    As early as this part of his life, Finley Morse tried his hand at  drawing.    He drew Mrs. Rand's picture upon a chest of drawers.    Instead of a pencil he used a pin.    So Mrs. Rand pinned him to her dress.    Of course he did not like that.    He tried to get away.    This tore the dress.    Then Mrs. Rand had to use her rattan.    When seven years of age Finley was sent to school at Andover.    He went to Phillip's Academy.    While there the father wrote letters to his boy.    He gave his boy good advice.    He told him about George Washington.    He also told him about another great man.    This man was a statesman of Holland.    He did all the business for that republic.    Yet he had time to go to evening amusements.    Some one asked this statesman how he did this.    He said there was nothing so easy, for that it was only doing one  thing at a time, and never putting off anything until to-morrow that  could be done to-day.    Finley's parents were always kind to him.    He soon became a manly boy.    He was the kind of boy who seemed to know that he must one day be a  man.    So he worked hard at school.    He began early to think and act for himself.    When he was but thirteen he wrote a sketch of the \"Life of  Demosthenes.\"    He sent it to his father.    This his father kept carefully.    It showed the genius, learning and taste of his boy.    This bright boy was ready for college at the age of fourteen.    But his father thought it best to keep him at home for a year.    Finley, when a boy, was always fond of drawing.    When but fifteen, he painted a fairly good picture in water colors.    This represented a room in his father's house.    His father, his two brothers and himself stood by a table.    His mother sat in a chair.    On the table was a globe, at which they were all looking.    His room at college was covered with pictures of his own making.    One of these was called, \"Freshmen Climbing the Hill of Science.\"    The poor fellows were scrambling to the top of a hill on their hands  and knees.    Finley had taken no lessons in art, yet he drew many portraits.    The other boys were all delighted to have their pictures drawn by  him.    They paid him a dollar apiece.    This kept him in spending money.    He also painted upon ivory.    For these he had five dollars each.    So, when Finley Morse graduated from Yale college, he was more fond  of drawing and painting than of anything else.    Finley at this time was a fine looking boy.    He had a pleasant smile.    He was always courteous.    Every one liked him.    He was as fond of a frolic as any one.    At one time the college cooks did not do their work to suit the  boys.    So the boys gave them a mock trial.    They sent a report of the trial to the college president.    The bad cooks were dismissed.    Afterwards the boys had better things to eat.    At another time the boys went to a paper mill near by.    They bought a great quantity of paper.    This they made into a baloon.    It was eighteen feet in length.    They filled it with air, and sent it on its journey.    It sailed finely, and soon was out of sight.    They tried it again.    The second time it took fire and was soon nothing but ashes.    About this time Finley heard his first lecture upon electricity.    After graduating, he returned to his father's house in Charlestown.    There he wrote a letter to his brothers with a queer kind of ink.    The writing did not show at all until heated by fire.    His brothers had to write to him to find out how to read it.    About this time Finley made a new friend.    This friend was Washington Allston.    Mr. Allston was a great painter.    He learned to love Finley Morse.    Mr. Allston spent most of his time in London.    Finley begged his people to allow him to go to London with Mr.  Allston.    They finally gave their consent.    So Mr. Morse made his first voyage across the Atlantic.    They landed at Liverpool.    They had to go from there to London in a stage coach.    As soon as he arrived he wrote to his parents.    In his letter he said that he wished they could hear from each other  in an instant.    \"But three thousand miles are not passed over in an instant.    So we must wait four long weeks before we can hear from each other  again.\"    Even then he longed for a telegraph.    In London he had the help of another great artist.    This was Benjamin West.    He, too, was an American.    Mr. Morse wished to become a student in the Royal Academy.    He had to make a drawing of Hercules.    Hercules, you know, was one of the heroes of early Greece.    The story is that he did very many brave deeds.    Finley's drawing was to be taken to Mr. West.    He worked very hard upon it for two weeks.    Then he went to Mr. West with it.    Mr. West said, \"Very well, sir, very well; go on and finish it.\"    \"It is finished,\" replied Finley.    \"Oh, no,\" said Mr. West. \"Look here, and here, and here.\"    So, when the mistakes were pointed out, Finley saw them.    He took the drawing home and worked patiently for another week.    Then he brought it to Mr. West again.    Mr. West handed it back to Mr. Morse, saying:    \"Very well indeed, sir. Go on and finish it.\"    \"Is it not finished?\" said Mr. Morse, for he was almost discouraged.    \"See,\" said Mr. West, \"you have not marked this muscle nor that  finger joint.\"    So another three days were spent on the drawing.    Again it was taken back.    \"Very clever indeed,\" said Mr. West, \"very clever. Now go on and  finish it.\"    \"I cannot finish it,\" replied Mr. Morse.    Then the old man patted him on the shoulder and said:    \"Well, I have tried you long enough.    \"Now, sir, you have learned more by this drawing than you would have  learned in double the time by a dozen half finished drawings.    \"Finish one picture, sir, and you are a painter.\"    Mr. Morse took this good advice.    He went to work upon a large picture.    It was a picture of the \"Dying Hercules.\"    He first modeled his picture in clay.    This he did so well that he received a gold medal for it. This was  on May 13, 1813.    His picture, too, was given great praise.    It was counted as one of the twelve best among the two thousand  pictures.    So Mr. Morse went on patiently and carefully in this work.    He made many good friends in London.    One of these friends was the poet, Coleridge.    Mr. Morse was a great comfort to his parents.    He was careful with his money.    He and a young Mr. Leslie, lived and painted together.    He spent all his money to get helps in his work.    He visited all the picture galleries, and spent days in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19549"],[0,"The Mind of the Child, Part II (#5)"],[1,"--Child strikes on keys of piano; pleased with singing  of canary-bird (89).
