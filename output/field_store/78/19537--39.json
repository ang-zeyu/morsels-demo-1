Where was Paddy's room going to  be, if he piled up the mud that way? But he didn't like to ask  questions, so he kept right on helping. Paddy would dive down to the  bottom and then come up with double handfuls of mud, which he held  against his chest. He would scramble out onto the platform and waddle  over to the pile in the middle, where he would put the mud and pat it  down. Then back to the bottom for more mud.    And so the mud pile grew and grew, until it was quite two feet high.  \"Now,\" said Paddy, \"I'll build the walls, and I guess you can't help me  much with those. I'm going to begin them to-morrow night. Perhaps you  will like to see me do it, Cousin Jerry.\"    \"I certainly will,\" replied Jerry, still puzzling over that pile of mud  in the middle.          XI    PETER RABBIT AND JERRY MUSKRAT ARE PUZZLED      Jerry Muskrat was more and more sure that his big cousin, Paddy the  Beaver, didn't know quite so much as he might about house-building.  Jerry would have liked to offer some suggestions, but he didn't quite  dare. You see, he was very anxious not to displease his big cousin. But  he felt that he simply had got to speak his mind to some one, so he swam  across to where he had seen Peter Rabbit almost every night since Paddy  began to build. Sure enough, Peter was there, sitting up very straight  and staring with big round eyes at the platform of mud and sticks out in  the water where Paddy the Beaver was at work.    [Illustration: \"Why it's a house you stupid. It's Paddy's new house,\"  replied Jerry. _Page 57_.]    \"Well, Peter, what do you think of it?\" asked Jerry.    \"What is it?\" asked Peter innocently. \"Is it another dam?\"    Jerry threw back his head and laughed and laughed.    Peter looked at him suspiciously. \"I don't see anything to laugh at,\"  said he.    \"Why, it's a house, you stupid. It's Paddy's new house,\" replied Jerry,  wiping the tears of laughter from his eyes.    \"I'm not stupid!\" retorted Peter. \"How was I to know that that pile of  mud and sticks is meant for a house? It certainly doesn't look it. Where  is the door?\"    \"To tell you the truth, I don't think it is much of a house myself,\"  replied Jerry. \"It has got a door, all right. In fact, it has got three.  You can't see them because they are under water, and there is a passage  from each right up through that platform of mud and sticks, which is the  foundation of the house. It really is a very fine foundation, Peter; it  really is. But what I can't understand is what Paddy is thinking of by  building that great pile of mud right in the middle. When he gets his  walls built, where will his bedroom be? There won't be any room at all.  It won't be a house at all--just a big useless pile of sticks and mud.\"    Peter scratched his head and then pulled his whiskers thoughtfully as he  gazed out at the pile in the water where Paddy the Beaver was at work.    \"It does look foolish, that's a fact,\" said he. \"Why don't you point  out to him the mistake he is making, Jerry? You have built such a  splendid house yourself that you ought to be able to help Paddy and show  him his mistakes.\"    Jerry had smiled a very self-satisfied smile when Peter mentioned his  fine house, but he shook his head at the suggestion that he should give  Paddy advice.    \"I--I don't just like to,\" he confessed. \"You know, he might not like it  and--and it doesn't seem as if it would be quite polite.\"    Peter sniffed. \"That wouldn't trouble me any if he were my cousin,\"  said he.    Jerry shook his head. \"No, I don't believe it would,\" he replied, \"but  it does trouble me and--and--well, I think I'll wait awhile.\"    Now all this time Paddy had been hard at work. He was bringing the  longest branches which he had cut from the trees out of which he had  built his dam, and a lot of slender willow and alder poles. He pushed  these ahead of him as he swam. When he reached the foundation of his  house, he would lean them against the pile of mud in the middle with  their big ends resting on the foundation. So he worked all the way  around until by and by the mud pile in the middle couldn't be seen. It  was completely covered with sticks, and they were cunningly fastened  together at the tops.          XII    JERRY MUSKRAT LEARNS SOMETHING      If you think you know it all    You are riding for a fall.    Use your ears and use your eyes,    But hold your tongue and you'll be wise.      Jerry Muskrat will tell you that is as true as true can be.    Jerry knows. He found it out for himself. Now he is very careful what  he says about other people or what they are doing. But he wasn't so  careful when his cousin, Paddy the Beaver, was building his house. No,  Sir, Jerry wasn't so careful then. He thought he knew more about  building a house than Paddy did. He was sure of it when he watched  Paddy heap up a great pile of mud right in the middle where his room  ought to be, and then build a wall of sticks around it. He said as much  to Peter Rabbit.    Now it is never safe to say anything to Peter Rabbit that you don't  care to have others know. Peter has a great deal of respect for Jerry  Muskrat's opinion on house-building. You see, he very much admires  Jerry's snug house in the Smiling Pool. It really is a very fine house,  and Jerry may be excused for being proud of it. But that doesn't  excuse Jerry for thinking that he knows all there is to know about  house-building. Of course Peter told every one he met that Paddy the  Beaver was making a foolish mistake in building his house, and that  Jerry Muskrat, who ought to know, said so.    So whenever they got the chance, the little people of the Green Forest  and the Green Meadows would steal up to the shore of Paddy's new pond  and chuckle as they looked out at the great pile of sticks and mud which  Paddy had built for a house, but in which he had forgotten to make a  room. At least they supposed that he had forgotten this very important  thing. He must have, for there wasn't any room. It was a great joke.  They laughed a lot about it, and they lost a great deal of the respect  for Paddy which they had had since he built his wonderful dam.    Jerry and Peter sat in the moonlight talking it over. Paddy had stopped  bringing sticks for his wall. He had dived down out of sight, and he was  gone a long time. Suddenly Jerry noticed that the water had grown very,  very muddy all around Paddy's new house. He wrinkled his brows trying to  think what Paddy could be doing. Presently Paddy came up for air. Then  he went down again, and the water grew muddier than ever. This went on  for a long time. Every little while Paddy would come up for air and a  few minutes of rest. Then down he would go, and the water would grow  muddier and muddier.    At last Jerry could stand it no longer. He just had to see what was  going on. He slipped into the water and swam over to where the water was  muddiest. Just as he got there up came Paddy.    \"Hello, Cousin Jerry!\" said he. \"I was just going to invite you over to  see what you think of my house inside. Just follow me.\"    Paddy dived, and Jerry dived after him. He followed Paddy in at one of  the three doorways under water and up a smooth hall right into the  biggest, nicest bedroom Jerry had ever seen in all his life. He just  gasped in sheer surprise. He couldn't do anything else. He couldn't find  his tongue to say a word. Here he was in this splendid great room up  above the water, and he had been so sure that there wasn't any room at  all! He just didn't know what to make of it.    Paddy's eyes twinkled. \"Well,\" said he, \"what do you think of it?\"    \"I--I--think it is splendid, just perfectly splendid! But I don't  understand it at all, Cousin Paddy. I--I--Where is that great pile of  mud I helped you build in the middle?\" Jerry looked as foolish as he  felt when he asked this.    \"Why, I've dug it all away. That's what made the water so muddy,\"  replied Paddy.    \"But what did you build it for in the first place?\" Jerry persisted.    \"Because I had to have something to rest my sticks against while I was  building my walls, of course,\" replied Paddy. \"When I got the tops  fastened together for a roof, they didn't need a support any longer, and  then I dug it away to make this room. I couldn't have built such a big  room any other way. I see you don't know very much about house-building,  Cousin Jerry.\"    \"I--I'm afraid I don't,\" confessed Jerry sadly.          XIII    THE QUEER STOREHOUSE      Everybody knew that Paddy the Beaver was laying up a supply of food for  the winter, and everybody thought it was queer food. That is, everybody  but Prickly Porky the Porcupine thought so. Prickly Porky likes the same  kind of food, but he never lays up a supply. He just goes out and gets  it when he wants it, winter or summer. What kind of food was it? Why,  bark, to be sure. Yes, Sir, it was just bark--the bark of certain kinds  of trees.    Now Prickly Porky can climb the trees and eat the bark right there, but  Paddy the Beaver cannot climb, and if he should just eat the bark that  he can reach from the ground it would take such a lot of trees to keep  him filled up that he would soon spoil the Green Forest. You know, when  the bark is taken off a tree all the way around, the tree dies. That is  because all the things that a tree draws out of the ground to make it  grow and keep it alive are carried up from the roots in the sap, and the  sap cannot go up the tree trunks and into the branches when the bark is  taken off, because it is up the inside of the bark that it travels. So  when the bark is taken from a tree all the way around the trunk, the  tree just starves to death.    Now Paddy the Beaver loves the Green Forest as dearly as you and I do,  and perhaps even a little more dearly. You see, it is his home. Besides,  Paddy never is wasteful. So he cuts down a tree so that he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19098"],[0,"Christmas in Ritual and Tradition, Christian and Pagan (#5)"],[1,"was Notker, a monk of  the abbey of St. Gall, near |33| the Lake of Constance. Among those  that are probably his work is the Christmas \"Natus ante saecula Dei  filius.\" The most famous Nativity sequence, however, is the \"Laetabundus,  exsultet fidelis chorus\" of St. Bernard of Clairvaux (d. 1153), once sung  all over Europe, and especially popular in England and France. Here are  its opening verses:--       \"Laetabundus,      Exsultet fidelis chorus;          Alleluia!      Regem regum      Intactae profudit thorus;          Res miranda!        Angelus consilii      Natus est de Virgine,          Sol de stella!      Sol occasum nesciens,      Stella semper rutilans,          Semper clara.\"[11]{4}    The \"Laetabundus\" is in rhymed stanzas; in this it differs from most  early proses. The writing of rhymed sequences, however, became common  through the example of the Parisian monk, Adam of St. Victor, in the  second half of the twelfth century. He adopted an entirely new style of  versification and music, derived from popular songs; and he and his  successors in |34| the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries wrote  various proses for the Christmas festival.    If we consider the Latin Christmas hymns from the fourth century to the  thirteenth, we shall find that however much they differ in form, they have  one common characteristic: they are essentially theological--dwelling on  the Incarnation and the Nativity as part of the process of man's  redemption--rather than realistic. There is little attempt to imagine  the scene in the stable at Bethlehem, little interest in the Child as a  child, little sense of the human pathos of the Nativity. The explanation  is, I think, very simple, and it lights up the whole observance of  Christmas as a Church festival in the centuries we are considering:  _this poetry is the poetry of monks, or of men imbued with the monastic  spirit_.    The two centuries following the institution of Christmas saw the break-up  of the Roman Empire in the west, and the incursions of barbarians  threatening the very existence of the Christian civilization that had  conquered classic paganism. It was by her army of monks that the Church  tamed and Christianized the barbarians, and both religion and culture  till the middle of the twelfth century were predominantly monastic. \"In  writing of any eminently religious man of this period\" [the eleventh  century], says Dean Church, \"it must be taken almost as a matter of  course that he was a monk.\"{5} And a monastery was not the place for  human feeling about Christmas; the monk was--at any rate in ideal--cut  off from the world; not for him were the joys of parenthood or tender  feelings for a new-born child. To the monk the world was, at least in  theory, the vale of misery; birth and generation were, one may almost  say, tolerated as necessary evils among lay folk unable to rise to the  heights of abstinence and renunciation; one can hardly imagine a true  early Benedictine filled with \"joy that a man is born into the world.\"  The Nativity was an infinitely important event, to be celebrated with a  chastened, unearthly joy, but not, as it became for the later Middle Ages  and the Renaissance, a matter upon which human affection might lavish  itself, which imagination might deck with vivid concrete detail. In the  later Christmas |35| the pagan and the Christian spirit, or delight in  earthly things and joy in the invisible, seem to meet and mingle; to the  true monk of the Dark and Early Middle Ages they were incompatible.    What of the people, the great world outside the monasteries? Can we  imagine that Christmas, on its Christian side, had a deep meaning for  them? For the first ten centuries, to quote Dean Church again,  Christianity \"can hardly be said to have leavened society at all.... It  acted upon it doubtless with enormous power; but it was as an extraneous  and foreign agent, which destroys and shapes, but does not mingle or  renew.... Society was a long time unlearning heathenism; it has not done  so yet; but it had hardly begun, at any rate it was only just beginning,  to imagine the possibility of such a thing in the eleventh century.\"{6}    \"The practical religion of the illiterate,\" says another ecclesiastical  historian, Dr. W. R. W. Stephens, \"was in many respects merely a survival  of the old paganism thinly disguised. There was a prevalent belief in  witchcraft, magic, sortilegy, spells, charms, talismans, which mixed  itself up in strange ways with Christian ideas and Christian worship....  Fear, the note of superstition, rather than love, which is the  characteristic of a rational faith, was conspicuous in much of the  popular religion. The world was haunted by demons, hobgoblins, malignant  spirits of divers kinds, whose baneful influence must be averted by  charms or offerings.\"{7}    The writings of ecclesiastics, the decrees of councils and synods, from  the fourth century to the eleventh, abound in condemnations of pagan  practices at the turn of the year. It is in these customs, and in secular  mirth and revelry, not in Christian poetry, that we must seek for the  expression of early lay feeling about Christmas. It was a feast of  material good things, a time for the fulfilment of traditional heathen  usages, rather than a joyous celebration of the Saviour's birth. No doubt  it was observed by due attendance at church, but the services in a tongue  not understanded of the people cannot have been very full of meaning to  them, and we can imagine |36| their Christmas church-going as rather a  duty inspired by fear than an expression of devout rejoicing. It is  noteworthy that the earliest of vernacular Christmas carols known to us,  the early thirteenth-century Anglo-Norman \"Seignors, ore entendez a nus,\"  is a song not of religion but of revelry. Its last verse is typical:       \"Seignors, jo vus di par Noel,      E par li sires de cest hostel,              Car bevez ben;      E jo primes beverai le men,      E pois aprez chescon le soen,          Par mon conseil;      Si jo vus di trestoz, 'Wesseyl!'      Dehaiz eit qui ne dirra, 'Drincheyl!'\"[12]{8}    Not till the close of the thirteenth century do we meet with any  vernacular Christmas poetry of importance. The verses of the  _troubadours_ and _trouveres_ of twelfth-century France had little to do  with Christianity; their songs were mostly of earthly and illicit love.  The German Minnesingers of the thirteenth century were indeed pious, but  their devout lays were addressed to the Virgin as Queen of Heaven, the  ideal of womanhood, holding in glory the Divine Child in her arms, rather  than to the Babe and His Mother in the great humility of Bethlehem.    The first real outburst of Christmas joy in a popular tongue is found in  Italy, in the poems of that strange \"minstrel of the Lord,\" the  Franciscan Jacopone da Todi (b. 1228, d. 1306). _Franciscan_, in that  name we have an indication of the change in religious feeling that came  over the western world, and |37| especially Italy, in the thirteenth  century.{9} For the twenty all-too-short years of St. Francis's  apostolate have passed, and a new attitude towards God and man and the  world has become possible. Not that the change was due solely to St.  Francis; he was rather the supreme embodiment of the ideals and  tendencies of his day than their actual creator; but he was the spark  that kindled a mighty flame. In him we reach so important a turning-point  in the history of Christmas that we must linger awhile at his side.    Early Franciscanism meant above all the democratizing, the humanizing of  Christianity; with it begins that \"carol spirit\" which is the most  winning part of the Christian Christmas, the spirit which, while not  forgetting the divine side of the Nativity, yet delights in its simple  humanity, the spirit that links the Incarnation to the common life of the  people, that brings human tenderness into religion. The faithful no  longer contemplate merely a theological mystery, they are moved by  affectionate devotion to the Babe of Bethlehem, realized as an actual  living child, God indeed, yet feeling the cold of winter, the roughness  of the manger bed.    St. Francis, it must be remembered, was not a man of high birth, but the  son of a silk merchant, and his appeal was made chiefly to the traders  and skilled workmen of the cities, who, in his day, were rising to  importance, coming, in modern Socialist terms, to class-consciousness.  The monks, although boys of low birth were sometimes admitted into the  cloister, were in sympathy one with the upper classes, and monastic  religion and culture were essentially aristocratic. The rise of the  Franciscans meant the bringing home of Christianity to masses of  town-workers, homely people, who needed a religion full of vivid  humanity, and whom the pathetic story of the Nativity would peculiarly  touch.    Love to man, the sense of human brotherhood--that was the great thing  which St. Francis brought home to his age. The message, certainly, was  not new, but he realized it with infectious intensity. The second great  commandment, \"Thou shall love thy neighbour as thyself,\" had not indeed  been forgotten by |38| mediaeval Christianity; the common life of  monasticism was an attempt to fulfil it; yet for the monk love to man was  often rather a duty than a passion. But to St. Francis love was very  life; he loved not by duty but by an inner compulsion, and his burning  love of God and man found its centre in the God-man, Christ Jesus. For no  saint, perhaps, has the earthly life of Christ been the object of such  passionate devotion as for St. Francis; the Stigmata were the awful, yet,  to his contemporaries, glorious fruit of his meditations on the Passion;  and of the ecstasy with which he kept his Christmas at Greccio we shall  read when we come to consider the _Presepio_. He had a peculiar affection  for the festival of the Holy Child; \"the"]]]
