He ventured to raise his eyes again, and found his supernatural  visitor confronting him in an erect attitude, with its chain wound over  and about its arm.    The apparition walked backward from him; and, at every step it took, the  window raised itself a little, so that, when the spectre reached it, it  was wide open. It beckoned Scrooge to approach, which he did. When they  were within two paces of each other, Marley's Ghost held up its hand,  warning him to come no nearer. Scrooge stopped.    Not so much in obedience as in surprise and fear; for, on the raising of  the hand, he became sensible of confused noises in the air; incoherent  sounds of lamentation and regret; wailings inexpressibly sorrowful and  self-accusatory. The spectre, after listening for a moment, joined in  the mournful dirge; and floated out upon the bleak, dark night.    Scrooge followed to the window: desperate in his curiosity. He looked  out.    The air was filled with phantoms, wandering hither and thither in  restless haste, and moaning as they went. Every one of them wore chains  like Marley's Ghost; some few (they might be guilty governments) were  linked together; none were free. Many had been personally known to  Scrooge in their lives. He had been quite familiar with one old ghost in  a white waistcoat, with a monstrous iron safe attached to its ankle, who  cried piteously at being unable to assist a wretched woman with an  infant, whom it saw below upon a doorstep. The misery with them all was,  clearly, that they sought to interfere, for good, in human matters, and  had lost the power for ever.    Whether these creatures faded into mist, or mist enshrouded them, he  could not tell. But they and their spirit voices faded together; and the  night became as it had been when he walked home.    Scrooge closed the window, and examined the door by which the Ghost had  entered. It was double locked, as he had locked it with his own hands,  and the bolts were undisturbed. He tried to say \"Humbug!\" but stopped at  the first syllable. And being, from the emotion he had undergone, or the  fatigues of the day, or his glimpse of the Invisible World, or the dull  conversation of the Ghost, or the lateness of the hour, much in need of  repose, went straight to bed without undressing, and fell asleep upon  the instant.          STAVE TWO    THE FIRST OF THE THREE SPIRITS      When Scrooge awoke it was so dark, that, looking out of bed, he could  scarcely distinguish the transparent window from the opaque walls of his  chamber. He was endeavouring to pierce the darkness with his ferret  eyes, when the chimes of a neighbouring church struck the four quarters.  So he listened for the hour.    To his great astonishment, the heavy bell went on from six to seven, and  from seven to eight, and regularly up to twelve; then stopped. Twelve!  It was past two when he went to bed. The clock was wrong. An icicle must  have got into the works. Twelve!    He touched the spring of his repeater, to correct this most preposterous  clock. Its rapid little pulse beat twelve, and stopped.    \"Why, it isn't possible,\" said Scrooge, \"that I can have slept through a  whole day and far into another night. It isn't possible that anything  has happened to the sun, and this is twelve at noon!\"    The idea being an alarming one, he scrambled out of bed, and groped his  way to the window. He was obliged to rub the frost off with the sleeve  of his dressing-gown before he could see anything; and could see very  little then. All he could make out was, that it was still very foggy and  extremely cold, and that there was no noise of people running to and  fro, and making a great stir, as there unquestionably would have been if  night had beaten off bright day, and taken possession of the world.  This was a great relief, because \"Three days after sight of this First  of Exchange pay to Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge or his order,\" and so forth,  would have become a mere United States security if there were no days to  count by.    Scrooge went to bed again, and thought, and thought, and thought it over  and over, and could make nothing of it. The more he thought, the more  perplexed he was; and, the more he endeavoured not to think, the more he  thought.    Marley's Ghost bothered him exceedingly. Every time he resolved within  himself, after mature inquiry, that it was all a dream, his mind flew  back again, like a strong spring released, to its first position, and  presented the same problem to be worked all through, \"Was it a dream or  not?\"    Scrooge lay in this state until the chime had gone three quarters more,  when he remembered, on a sudden, that the Ghost had warned him of a  visitation when the bell tolled one. He resolved to lie awake until the  hour was passed; and, considering that he could no more go to sleep than  go to Heaven, this was, perhaps, the wisest resolution in his power.    The quarter was so long, that he was more than once convinced he must  have sunk into a doze unconsciously, and missed the clock. At length it  broke upon his listening ear.    \"Ding, dong!\"    \"A quarter past,\" said Scrooge, counting.    \"Ding, dong!\"    \"Half past,\" said Scrooge.    \"Ding, dong!\"    \"A quarter to it,\" said Scrooge.    \"Ding, dong!\"    \"The hour itself,\" said Scrooge triumphantly, \"and nothing else!\"    He spoke before the hour bell sounded, which it now did with a deep,  dull, hollow, melancholy ONE. Light flashed up in the room upon the  instant, and the curtains of his bed were drawn.    The curtains of his bed were drawn aside, I tell you, by a hand. Not the  curtains at his feet, nor the curtains at his back, but those to which  his face was addressed. The curtains of his bed were drawn aside; and  Scrooge, starting up into a half-recumbent attitude, found himself face  to face with the unearthly visitor who drew them: as close to it as I am  now to you, and I am standing in the spirit at your elbow.    It was a strange figure--like a child: yet not so like a child as like  an old man, viewed through some supernatural medium, which gave him the  appearance of having receded from the view, and being diminished to a  child's proportions. Its hair, which hung about its neck and down its  back, was white, as if with age; and yet the face had not a wrinkle in  it, and the tenderest bloom was on the skin. The arms were very long and  muscular; the hands the same, as if its hold were of uncommon strength.  Its legs and feet, most delicately formed, were, like those upper  members, bare. It wore a tunic of the purest white; and round its waist  was bound a lustrous belt, the sheen of which was beautiful. It held a  branch of fresh green holly in its hand: and, in singular contradiction  of that wintry emblem, had its dress trimmed with summer flowers. But  the strangest thing about it was, that from the crown of its head there  sprung a bright clear jet of light, by which all this was visible; and  which was doubtless the occasion of its using, in its duller moments, a  great extinguisher for a cap, which it now held under its arm.    Even this, though, when Scrooge looked at it with increasing steadiness,  was _not_ its strangest quality. For, as its belt sparkled and  glittered, now in one part and now in another, and what was light one  instant at another time was dark, so the figure itself fluctuated in its  distinctness: being now a thing with one arm, now with one leg, now with  twenty legs, now a pair of legs without a head, now a head without a  body: of which dissolving parts no outline would be visible in the dense  gloom wherein they melted away. And, in the very wonder of this, it  would be itself again; distinct and clear as ever.    \"Are you the Spirit, sir, whose coming was foretold to me?\" asked  Scrooge.    \"I am!\"    The voice was soft and gentle. Singularly low, as if, instead of being  so close beside him, it were at a distance.    \"Who and what are you?\" Scrooge demanded.    \"I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.\"    \"Long Past?\" inquired Scrooge; observant of its dwarfish stature.    \"No. Your past.\"    Perhaps Scrooge could not have told anybody why, if anybody could have  asked him; but he had a special desire to see the Spirit in his cap; and  begged him to be covered.    \"What!\" exclaimed the Ghost, \"would you so soon put out, with worldly  hands, the light I give? Is it not enough that you are one of those  whose passions made this cap, and force me through whole trains of years  to wear it low upon my brow?\"    Scrooge reverently disclaimed all intention to offend or any knowledge  of having wilfully \"bonneted\" the Spirit at any period of his life. He  then made bold to inquire what business brought him there.    \"Your welfare!\" said the Ghost.    Scrooge expressed himself much obliged, but could not help thinking that  a night of unbroken rest would have been more conducive to that end. The  Spirit must have heard him thinking, for it said immediately:    \"Your reclamation, then. Take heed!\"    It put out its strong hand as it spoke, and clasped him gently by the  arm.    \"Rise! and walk with me!\"    It would have been in vain for Scrooge to plead that the weather and the  hour were not adapted to pedestrian purposes; that bed was warm, and  the thermometer a long way below freezing; that he was clad but lightly  in his slippers, dressing-gown, and nightcap; and that he had a cold  upon him at that time. The grasp, though gentle as a woman's hand, was  not to be resisted. He rose: but, finding that the Spirit made towards  the window, clasped its robe in supplication.    \"I am a mortal,\" Scrooge remonstrated, \"and liable to fall.\"    \"Bear but a touch of my hand _there_,\" said the Spirit, laying it upon  his heart, \"and you shall be upheld in more than this!\"    As the words were spoken, they passed through the wall, and stood upon  an open country road, with fields on either hand. The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19354"],[0,"Lessons in Music Form (#5)"],[1,"in the following examples, serves  also to point out the significant resemblance between the structure of  language and of music.  The principal melody is, as it were, the voice  of the speaker, whose message is framed wholly out of the primary  tones, or letters of the musical alphabet.  The association of primary  tone-units, in successive order, results first in the figure, then in  the motive, then the phrase, period, and so forth, in the manner of  natural growth, till the narrative is ended.  The following example,  though extending beyond our present point of observation, is given as  an illustration of this accumulative process (up to the so-called  Period):--    [Illustration: Example 6.  Fragment of Beethoven.]    [Illustration: Example 6 continued.]    The tones bracketed _a_ are the Figures; two (in the last measures,  three) of these are seen to form Motives; two of these motives make the  Phrase; and the whole sentence, of two phrases, is a Period.  See also  Ex. 1 and Ex. 2, in which the formation of figures is very distinct.    The pregnancy and significance of each of these tiny musical \"words\"  (or figures, as we are to call them),--small and apparently imperfect  as they are,--can best be tested by concentrating the attention upon  each as if it stood alone upon the page; it is such vitality of the  separate particles that invests a musical masterwork with its power and  permanency of interest.          *      *      *      *      *      *    DEFINING THE FIGURES.--It is not always easy to distinguish the figures  in a melodic sentence.  While they are unquestionably analogous to the  words in speech, they are by no means as concrete, nor are they  separated as distinctly, as the words upon a written or printed sheet.  This is in keeping with the intangible quality of music, and the  peculiar vagueness of its medium of expression; the quality which veils  its intrinsic purport from the mass of music admirers, and lends it  such exquisite and inexplicable charm to all hearers alike.    In a word, it is not the common practice for a composer to cut up his  melodic sentences into separately recognizable small particles, by  distinctly marking each component _figure_.  Here and there it is done,  by way of contrast, or emphasis, or for a definite rhythmic effect,--as  shown in Ex. 2 and Ex. 6.  But more generally the figures are so  closely interlinked that the whole sentence may impress the hearer as  one coherent strain, with an occasional interruption.  The very minute  \"breaks\" between figures are often nearly or quite imperceptible; and  in many cases it is possible to define the figures of a motive in  various, equally plausible ways, simply because the \"breaks\" (which are  of course surely present, and become more and more apparent between the  larger members of a composition) are likely to be too inconsiderable  among these, smallest factors of the melodic form.    The following three guides may serve to indicate the extremities of the  melodic figures:--    (1) A brief rest, or a longer tone, usually marks the end of a figure.  This is fully illustrated in Ex. 6.  See also Ex. 10, Ex. 12.    (2) Similarity of formation (rhythm and melodic direction) almost  invariably defines the mutually opposed, and therefore separable,  divisions of the melody,--both small and large.  For example (the  figures are bracketed _a_):--    [Illustration: Example 7.  Fragments of Czerny, Mendelssohn, and  Schumann.]    See also Ex. 1.  The operation of this exceedingly important rule of  \"corresponding formation\" (about which more will be said later on) is  seen--on a larger scale--in Ex. 2, Ex. 5, and Ex. 6, where it defines  the whole _motive_.    (3) In default of more definite signs, the figures may be found to  correspond to the metric groups (that is, in lengths of whole or half  measures).  Thus:--    [Illustration: Example 8.  Fragments of Beethoven.]    This example illustrates the interlinking of the figures, and suggests  the difficulty that may be encountered in the effort to define melodic  figures.  The difficulty is probably greatest in melodies of a lyric  character, where it is necessary to sustain the coherency of the  sentence; for instance, in many of the Songs Without Words,--see No.  40, No. 22, and others, in which an entirely definite separation of the  figures is well-nigh a hopeless task.    For this reason,--that is, because the melodic divisions are so minute  and vague between these smaller particles of the musical sentence,--it  is advisable _to give no heed to any factor smaller than the \"motive,\"_  and to undertake the analysis of nothing less than the latter; for even  the most scrupulous \"phrasing,\" in the playing of a composition, must  avoid the risk of incoherency almost certain to result from distinctly  separating all the figures.  The melodies in Ex. 8 should not betray  the secret of their formation.      THE MELODIC MOTIVE OR PHRASE-MEMBER.--This, as has already been stated,  is a somewhat longer section, compounded of two or more figures.  Being  thus longer, the \"breaks\" or spaces between motives are generally more  emphatic and recognizable than those between the figures, and therefore  it is easier, as a rule, to define the extremities of motives.    Melodic motives differ in length from one to four measures; by far the  most common extent, however, is two measures, and the student will do  wisely to accept this dimension and analyze accordingly, unless there  is unmistakable evidence to the contrary.  The indications are  precisely the same as those illustrated in the preceding two examples  as guides for the definition of figures.    For example:--    [Illustration: Example 9.  Fragments of Beethoven, Mendelssohn, and  Mozart.]    In the first of these examples the extent of the motives is proven by  each of the three given guides: the rest, which marks the end of the  first member; the similarity of melodic and rhythmic formation, which  proclaims the beginning of the second member, parallel with that of the  first; and the regular (two-measure) dimension.  In Nos. 2 and 3 there  are no rests between the motives, and the melodic formation differs;  here it is the standard of two measures that defines the members.    Ex. 3 is a two-measure motive.  In Exs. 2, 5, and 6, the motives are  all two measures in length.    In the following:--    [Illustration: Example 10.  Fragment of Beethoven.]    one is tempted to call each _single_ measure a motive, because of the  number of tones it contains, and the weight (length) of the final tone,  which makes a much more emphatic interruption than commonly occurs  between figures.    And in the following, on the other hand:--    [Illustration: Example 11.  Fragment of Beethoven.]    the entire four-measure sentence is evidently one motive, for there is  no recognizable indication of an interruption at any point.  The same  is true of the two melodies given in Ex. 8.    The following illustrates an irregular (uneven) association of  members:--    [Illustration: Example 12.  Fragment of Mozart.]    Here again, there may be a disposition to adopt the upper line of  brackets, assigning a single measure to each motive.  But both here,  _and in Ex. 10_, the student is advised to adhere to the two-measure  standard; he will avoid much needless confusion by so doing,--at least  until he shall have so developed and sharpened his sense of melodic  syntax that he can apprehend the finer shades of distinction in the  \"motion and repose\" of a melody.  Adopting the lower line of brackets,  we discover successive members of unequal length, the first one  containing two, the next one three measures.      PRELIMINARY TONES.--It is a singularly effective and pregnant quality  of the element of musical rhythm, that its operations are not bounded  by the vertical bars which mark off the measures.  That is to say, a  rhythmic figure (and, in consequence, a melodic figure or motive) does  not necessarily extend from bar to bar, but may run from the middle (or  any other point) of one measure, to the middle (or corresponding point)  of the next; precisely as prosodic rhythm comprises poetic feet which  begin either with an accented or with an unaccented syllable.  See Ex.  10.  Hence the significant rule, _that a melodic member may begin at  any part of a measure_, upon an accented or an unaccented beat, or upon  any fraction of a beat.  For example:--    [Illustration: Example 13.  Fragments of Mendelssohn.]    [Illustration: Example 13 continued.  Fragments of Mendelssohn and  Mozart.]      In No. 1, the motive begins squarely with the measure, upon the  accented beat.  In No. 2, the same motive is enlarged by two tones at  the outset, which locates its beginning upon the fourth 8th--the second  half of the second beat.  In No. 3 the motive begins upon an accented  beat, but it is the lighter (secondary) accent of the 3d beat.  The  various conditions of unaccented beginnings in Nos. 4, 5 and 6 are  easily recognizable.  In No. 7 quite a large fraction of a measure  precedes the first accent (at the beginning of the full measure).  Examine, also, all the preceding examples, and note the different  accented or unaccented locations of the first tone, in each figure and  motive.    When a figure or motive starts at the accented beat, it begins, so to  speak, in the right place; _any tone or tones which precede the accent  are merely preliminary or introductory tones_.  While they are very  desirable and necessary, in the fulfilment of certain purposes, they  are not an _essential_ part of the motive; they appear to represent the  ornamental rather than the stable element of the melodic sentence, and  their employment is therefore a matter of option and taste rather than  of absolute necessity.  The accent indicates the point where the body  of the motive begins; the accent is the point where the stake is  driven; all that goes before is"]]]
