[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19285"],[0,"The Promulgation of Universal Peace (#5)"],[1,"  the divine bounty is not fully manifest.    In Persia among the various religions and sects there were intense  differences. Baha'u'llah appeared in that country and founded the  spiritual civilization. He established affiliation among the various  peoples, promoted the oneness of the human world and unfurled the banner  of the Most Great Peace. He wrote special Epistles covering these facts to  all the kings and rulers of nations. Sixty years ago He conveyed His  message to the leaders of the political world and to high dignitaries of  the spiritual world. Therefore, spiritual civilization is progressing in  the Orient, and oneness of humanity and peace among the nations is being  accomplished step by step. Now I find a strong movement for universal  peace emanating from America. It is my hope that this standard of the  oneness of the world of humanity may be upraised with the utmost solidity  so that the Orient and Occident may become perfectly reconciled and attain  complete intercommunication, the hearts of the East and West become united  and attracted, real union become unveiled, the light of guidance shine,  divine effulgences be seen day by day so that the world of humanity may  find complete tranquillity, the eternal happiness of man become evident  and the hearts of the people of the world be as mirrors in which the rays  of the Sun of Reality may be reflected. Consequently, it is my request  that you should strive so that the light of reality may shine and the  everlasting felicity of the world of man become apparent.    I will pray for you so you may attain this everlasting happiness. When I  arrived in this city, I was made very happy, for I perceived that the  people here have capacity for divine bestowals and have worthiness for the  civilization of heaven. I pray that you may attain to all merciful  bounties.    O Almighty! O God! O Thou compassionate One! This servant of Thine has  hastened to the regions of the West from the uttermost parts of the East  that, perchance, these nostrils may be perfumed by the fragrances of Thy  bestowals; that the breeze of the rose garden of guidance may blow over  these cities; that the people may attain to the capacity of receiving Thy  favors; that the hearts may be rejoiced through Thy glad tidings; that the  eyes may behold the light of reality; that the ears may hearken to the  call of the Kingdom. O Almighty! Illumine the hearts. O kind God! Make the  souls the envy of the rose garden and the meadow. O incomparable Beloved!  Waft the fragrance of Thy bounty. Radiate the lights of compassion so that  the hearts may be cleansed and purified and that they may take a share and  portion from Thy confirmations. Verily, this congregation is seeking Thy  path, searching for Thy mystery, beholding Thy face and desiring to be  characterized with Thine attributes.    O Almighty! Confer Thou infinite bounties. Bestow Thine inexhaustible  treasury so that these impotent ones may become powerful.    Verily, Thou art the Kind. Thou art the Generous. Thou art the Omniscient,  the Omnipotent.          14 April 1912  Talk at Union Meeting of Advanced Thought Centers  Carnegie Lyceum  West Fifty-seventh Street, New York      Notes by Mountfort Mills and Howard MacNutt    I have come from distant lands to visit the meetings and assemblies of  this country. In every meeting I find people gathered, loving each other;  therefore, I am greatly pleased. The bond of union is evidenced in this  assembly today, where the power of God has brought together in faith,  agreement and concord those who are engaged in furthering the development  of the human world. It is my hope that all mankind may become similarly  united in the bond and agreement of love. Unity is the expression of the  loving power of God and reflects the reality of Divinity. It is  resplendent in this Day through the bestowals of light upon humanity.    Throughout the universe the divine power is effulgent in endless images  and pictures. The world of creation, the world of humanity may be likened  to the earth itself and the divine power to the sun. This Sun has shone  upon all mankind. In the endless variety of its reflections the divine  Will is manifested. Consider how all are recipients of the bounty of the  same Sun. At most the difference between them is that of degree, for the  effulgence is one effulgence, the one light emanating from the Sun. This  will express the oneness of the world of humanity. The body politic, or  the social unity of the human world, may be likened to an ocean, and each  member, each individual, a wave upon that same ocean.    The light of the sun becomes apparent in each object according to the  capacity of that object. The difference is simply one of degree and  receptivity. The stone would be a recipient only to a limited extent;  another created thing might be as a mirror wherein the sun is fully  reflected; but the same light shines upon both.    The most important thing is to polish the mirrors of hearts in order that  they may become illumined and receptive of the divine light. One heart may  possess the capacity of the polished mirror; another, be covered and  obscured by the dust and dross of this world. Although the same Sun is  shining upon both, in the mirror which is polished, pure and sanctified  you may behold the Sun in all its fullness, glory and power, revealing its  majesty and effulgence; but in the mirror which is rusted and obscured  there is no capacity for reflection, although so far as the Sun itself is  concerned it is shining thereon and is neither lessened nor deprived.  Therefore, our duty lies in seeking to polish the mirrors of our hearts in  order that we shall become reflectors of that light and recipients of the  divine bounties which may be fully revealed through them.    This means the oneness of the world of humanity. That is to say, when this  human body politic reaches a state of absolute unity, the effulgence of  the eternal Sun will make its fullest light and heat manifest. Therefore,  we must not make distinctions between individual members of the human  family. We must not consider any soul as barren or deprived. Our duty lies  in educating souls so that the Sun of the bestowals of God shall become  resplendent in them, and this is possible through the power of the oneness  of humanity. The more love is expressed among mankind and the stronger the  power of unity, the greater will be this reflection and revelation, for  the greatest bestowal of God is love. Love is the source of all the  bestowals of God. Until love takes possession of the heart, no other  divine bounty can be revealed in it.    All the Prophets have striven to make love manifest in the hearts of men.  Jesus Christ sought to create this love in the hearts. He suffered all  difficulties and ordeals that perchance the human heart might become the  fountain source of love. Therefore, we must strive with all our heart and  soul that this love may take possession of us so that all humanity--whether  it be in the East or in the West--may be connected through the bond of this  divine affection; for we are all the waves of one sea; we have come into  being through the same bestowal and are recipients from the same center.  The lights of earth are all acceptable, but the center of effulgence is  the sun, and we must direct our gaze to the sun. God is the Supreme  Center. The more we turn toward this Center of Light, the greater will be  our capacity.    In the Orient there were great differences among races and peoples. They  hated each other, and there was no association among them. Various and  divergent sects were hostile, irreconcilable. The different races were in  constant war and conflict. About sixty years ago Baha'u'llah appeared upon  the eastern horizon. He caused love and unity to become manifest among  these antagonistic peoples. He united them with the bond of love; their  former hatred and animosity passed away; love and unity reigned instead.  It was a dark world; it became radiant. A new springtime appeared through  Him, for the Sun of Truth had risen again. In the fields and meadows of  human hearts variegated flowers of inner significance were blooming, and  the good fruits of the Kingdom of God became manifest.    I have come here with this mission: that through your endeavors, through  your heavenly morals, through your devoted efforts a perfect bond of unity  and love may be established between the East and the West so that the  bestowals of God may descend upon all and that all may be seen to be the  parts of the same tree--the great tree of the human family. For mankind may  be likened to the branches, leaves, blossoms and fruit of that tree.    The favors of God are unending, limitless. Infinite bounties have  encompassed the world. We must emulate the bounties of God, and just as  each one of them--the bounty of life, for instance--surrounds and  encompasses all, so likewise must we be connected and blended together  until each part shall become the expression of the whole.    Consider: We plant a seed. A complete and perfect tree appears from it,  and from each seed of this tree another tree can be produced. Therefore,  the part is expressive of the whole, for this seed was a part of the tree,  but therein potentially was the whole tree. So each one of us may become  expressive or representative of all the bounties of life to mankind. This  is the unity of the world of humanity. This is the bestowal of God. This  is the felicity of the human world, and this is the manifestation of the  divine favor.          15 April 1912  Talk at Home of Mountfort Mills  327 West End Avenue, New York      Compiled from Stenographic Notes by Howard MacNutt    A few days ago I arrived in New York, coming direct from Alexandria. On a  former trip I traveled to Europe, visiting Paris and London. Paris is most  beautiful in outward appearance. The evidences of material"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19287"],[0,"Selections from the Writings of `Abdu'l-Bahá (#5)"],[1,"above the horizon of  oneness, His lights streaming out from the dayspring of might, and the  announcement of the Most Great Glad-Tidings by His Herald, the One, the  Incomparable. Verily in this is a brilliant proof for the company of those  who know.    Among His signs is His being manifest, being seen by all, standing as His  own proof, and His presence among witnesses in every region, among peoples  who fell upon Him even as wolves, and compassed Him about from every side.    Among His signs is His withstanding powerful nations and all-conquering  states, and a host of enemies thirsting for His blood, intent at every  moment upon His ruin, wheresoever He might be. Verily this is a matter  deserving the scrutiny of those who ponder the signs and tokens of God.    Another of His signs is the marvel of His discourse, the eloquence of His  utterance, the rapidity with which His Writings were revealed, His words  of wisdom, His verses, His epistles, His communes, His unfolding of the  Qur'an, both the abstruse verses thereof and the clear. By thy very life!  This thing is plain as day to whoever will regard it with the eye of  justice.    Again among His signs is the dawning sun of His knowledge, and the rising  moon of His arts and skills, and His demonstrating perfection in all His  ways, as testified by the learned and accomplished of many nations.    And again among His signs is the fact that His beauty stayed inviolate,  and His human temple was protected as He revealed His splendours, despite  the massed attacks of all His foes, who came against Him in their  thousands with their darting arrows, spears and swords. Herein is verily a  wonder and a warning to any fair judge.    And among His signs is His long-suffering, His tribulations and His woes,  His agony in His chains and fetters, and His calling out at every moment:  'Come unto Me, come unto Me, ye righteous! Come unto Me, come unto Me, ye  lovers of the good! Come unto Me, come unto Me, ye dawning points of  light!' Verily the gates of mystery are opened wide--but still do the  wicked disport themselves with their vain cavillings!(14)    Yet another of His signs is the promulgation of His Book, His decisive  Holy Text wherein He reproved the kings, and His dire warning to that  one(15) whose mighty rule was felt around the world--and whose great throne  then toppled down in a matter of brief days--this being a fact clearly  established and widely known.    And among His signs is the sublimity of His grandeur, His exalted state,  His towering glory, and the shining out of His beauty above the horizon of  the Prison: so that heads were bowed before Him and voices lowered, and  humble were the faces that turned His way. This is a proof never witnessed  in the ages gone before.    Again among His signs are the extraordinary things He continually did, the  miracles He performed, the wonders appearing from Him without interruption  like the streaming down of His clouds--and the acknowledgement, even by  unbelievers, of His powerful light. By His own life! This was clearly  verified, it was demonstrated to those of every persuasion who came into  the presence of the living, the self-subsisting Lord.    And yet another of His signs is the wide-spreading rays of the sun of His  era, the rising moon of His times in the heaven of all the ages: His day,  which standeth at the summit of all days, for its rank and power, its  sciences and its arts, reaching far and wide, that have dazzled the world  and astonished the minds of men.    Verily is this a matter settled and established for all time.            5: THE WORLD'S GREAT LIGHT, ONCE RESPLENDENT UPON ALL ...      The world's great Light, once resplendent upon all mankind, hath set, to  shine everlastingly from the Abha Horizon, His Kingdom of fadeless glory,  shedding splendour upon His loved ones from on high and breathing into  their hearts and souls the breath of eternal life.    Ponder in your hearts that which He hath foretold in His Tablet of the  Divine Vision that hath been spread throughout the world. Therein He  saith: 'Thereupon she wailed and exclaimed: \"May the world and all that is  therein be a ransom for Thy woes. O Sovereign of heaven and earth!  Wherefore hast Thou left Thyself in the hands of the dwellers of this  prison-city of Akka? Hasten Thou to other dominions, to Thy retreats  above, whereon the eyes of the people of names have never fallen.\" We  smiled and spake not. Reflect upon these most exalted words, and  comprehend the purpose of this hidden and sacred mystery.'    O ye beloved of the Lord! Beware, beware lest ye hesitate and waver. Let  not fear fall upon you, neither be troubled nor dismayed. Take ye good  heed lest this calamitous day slacken the flames of your ardour, and  quench your tender hopes. Today is the day for steadfastness and  constancy. Blessed are they that stand firm and immovable as the rock and  brave the storm and stress of this tempestuous hour. They, verily, shall  be the recipients of God's grace; they, verily, shall receive His divine  assistance, and shall be truly victorious. They shall shine amidst mankind  with a radiance which the dwellers of the Pavilion of Glory laud and  magnify. To them is proclaimed this celestial call, revealed in His Most  Holy Book: 'Let not your hearts be perturbed, O people, when the glory of  My Presence is withdrawn, and the ocean of My utterance is stilled. In My  presence amongst you there is a wisdom, and in My absence there is yet  another, inscrutable to all but God, the Incomparable, the All-Knowing.  Verily, We behold you from Our realm of glory, and shall aid whosoever  will arise for the triumph of Our Cause with the hosts of the Concourse on  high and a company of Our favoured angels.'    The Sun of Truth, that Most Great Light, hath set upon the horizon of the  world to rise with deathless splendour over the Realm of the Limitless. In  His Most Holy Book He calleth the firm and steadfast of His friends: 'Be  not dismayed, O peoples of the world, when the day-star of My beauty is  set, and the heaven of My tabernacle is concealed from your eyes. Arise to  further My Cause, and to exalt My Word amongst men.'            6: O YE PEOPLES OF THE KINGDOM! HOW MANY A SOUL ...      O ye peoples of the Kingdom! How many a soul expended all its span of life  in worship, endured the mortification of the flesh, longed to gain an  entry into the Kingdom, and yet failed, while ye, with neither toil nor  pain nor self-denial, have won the prize and entered in.    It is even as in the time of the Messiah, when the Pharisees and the pious  were left without a portion, while Peter, John and Andrew, given neither  to pious worship nor ascetic practice, won the day. Wherefore, thank ye  God for setting upon your heads the crown of glory everlasting, for  granting unto you this immeasurable grace.    The time hath come when, as a thank-offering for this bestowal, ye should  grow in faith and constancy as day followeth day, and should draw ever  nearer to the Lord, your God, becoming magnetized to such a degree, and so  aflame, that your holy melodies in praise of the Beloved will reach upward  to the Company on high; and that each one of you, even as a nightingale in  this rose garden of God, will glorify the Lord of Hosts, and become the  teacher of all who dwell on earth.            7: O YE SPIRITUAL FRIENDS OF 'ABDU'L-BAHA! A TRUSTED ...      O ye spiritual friends of 'Abdu'l-Baha! A trusted messenger hath arrived  and hath, in the world of the spirit, delivered a message from God's loved  ones. This auspicious courier bringeth fragrances of great ardour and  wafteth the life-giving breezes of the love of God. He maketh the heart to  dance for joy and filleth up the soul with an ecstasy of love and rapture.  So intensely hath the glory of Divine Unity penetrated souls and hearts  that all are now bound one to another with heavenly ties, and all are even  as a single heart, a single soul. Wherefore reflections of the spirit and  impressions of the Divine are now mirrored clear and sharp in the deep  heart's core. I beg of God to strengthen these spiritual bonds as day  followeth day, and make this mystic oneness to shine ever more brightly,  until at last all shall be as troops marshalled together beneath the  banner of the Covenant within the sheltering shade of the Word of God;  that they may strive with all their might until universal fellowship,  close and warm, and unalloyed love, and spiritual relationships, will  connect all the hearts in the world. Then will all humankind, because of  this fresh and dazzling bounty, be gathered in a single homeland. Then  will conflict and dissension vanish from the face of the earth, then will  mankind be cradled in love for the beauty of the All-Glorious. Discord  will change to accord, dissension to unison. The roots of malevolence will  be torn out, the basis of aggression destroyed. The bright rays of union  will obliterate the darkness of limitations, and the splendours of heaven  will make the human heart to be even as a mine veined richly with the love  of God.    O ye loved ones of the Lord! This is the hour when ye must associate with  all the earth's peoples in extreme kindliness and love, and be to them the  signs and tokens of God's great mercy. Ye must become the very soul of the  world, the living spirit in the body of the children of men. In this  wondrous Age, at this time when the Ancient Beauty, the Most Great Name,  bearing unnumbered gifts, hath risen above the horizon of the world, the  Word of God hath infused such awesome power into the inmost essence of  humankind that He hath stripped men's human qualities of all effect, and  hath, with His all-conquering might, unified the peoples in a vast sea of  oneness.    Now is the time for the lovers of God to raise high the banners of unity,  to intone, in the assemblages of the world, the verses of friendship"]]]
