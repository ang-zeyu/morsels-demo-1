(#5)"],[1," arise.    _Through form._--Forms of decorated objects exercise a strong influence  upon the decorative designs employed. It would be more difficult to  tattoo the human face or body with straight lines or rectilinear  patterns than with curved ones. An ornament applied originally to a  vessel of a given form would accommodate itself to that form pretty much  as costume becomes adjusted to the individual. When it came to be  required for another form of vessel, very decided changes might be  necessary.    With the ancient Pueblo peoples rectilinear forms of meander patterns  were very much in favor and many earthen vessels are found in which  bands of beautiful angular geometric figures occupy the peripheral  zone, Fig. 480 _a_, but when the artist takes up a mug having a row of  hemispherical nodes about the body, _b_, he finds it very difficult to  apply his favorite forms and is almost compelled to run spiral curves  about the nodes in order to secure a neat adjustment.    [Illustration: FIG. 480.--Variations in a motive through the influence  of form.]    _Through methods of realisation_.--It will readily be seen that the  forms assumed by a motive depend greatly upon the character of the  mechanical devices employed. In the potter's art devices for holding and  turning the vessel under manipulation produce peculiar results.    In applying a given idea to clay much depends upon the method of  executing it. It will take widely differing forms when executed by  incising, by modeling, by painting, and by stamping.    Intimately associated with methods of execution are peculiarities of  construction, the two agencies working together in the processes of  modification and development of ornament.    I have previously shown how our favorite ornament, the scroll, in its  disconnected form may have originated in the copying of natural forms or  through the manipulation of coils of clay. I present here an example of  its possible origin through the modification of forms derived from  constructional features of basketry. An ornament known as the guilloche  is found in many countries. The combination of lines resembles that of  twisted or platted fillets of wood, cane, or rushes, as may be seen at a  glance, Fig. 481 _a_. An incised ornament of this character, possibly  derived from basketry by copying the twisted fillets or their  impressions in the clay, is very common on the pottery of the mounds of  the Mississippi Valley, and its variants form a most interesting study.  In applying this to a vessel the careless artist does not properly  connect the ends of the lines which pass beneath the intersecting  fillets, and the parts become disconnected, _b_. In many cases the ends  are turned in abruptly as seen in _c_, and only a slight further change  is necessary to lead to the result, _d_, the running scroll with  well-developed links. All of these steps may be observed in a single  group of vessels.    It may be thought by some that the processes of development indicated  above are insufficient and unsatisfactory. There are those who, seeing  these forms already endowed with symbolism, begin at what I conceive to  be the wrong end of the process. They derive the form of symbol directly  from the thing symbolized. Thus the current scroll is, with many races,  found to be a symbol of water, and its origin is attributed to a literal  rendition of the sweep and curl of the waves. It is more probable that  the scroll became the symbol of the sea long after its development  through agencies similar to those described above, and that the  association resulted from the observation of incidental resemblances.  This same figure, in use by the Indians of the interior of the  continent, is regarded as symbolic of the whirlwind, and it is probable  that any symbol-using people will find in the features and phenomena of  their environment, whatever it may be, sufficient resemblance to any of  their decorative devices to lead to a symbolic association.    [Illustration: FIG. 481.--Theoretical development of the current  scroll.]    One secret of modification is found in the use of a radical in more than  one art, owing to differences in constructional characters. For example,  the tendency of nearly all woven fabrics is to encourage, even to  compel, the use of straight lines in the decorative designs applied.  Thus the attempt to employ curved lines would lead to stepped or broken  lines. The curvilinear scroll coming from some other art would be forced  by the constructional character of the fabric into square forms, and the  rectilinear meander or fret would result, as shown in. Fig. 482, _a_  being the plain form, painted, engraved, or in relief, and _b_ the same  idea developed in a woven fabric. Stone or brick-work would lead to like  results, Fig. 483; but the modification could as readily move in the  other direction. If an ornament originating in the constructional  character of a woven fabric, or remodeled by it, and hence rectilinear,  should be desired for a smooth structureless or featureless surface, the  difficulties of drawing the angular forms would lead to the delineation  of curved forms, and we would have exactly the reverse of the order  shown in Figs. 482 and 483. The two forms given in Fig. 484 actually  occur in one and the same design painted upon an ancient Pueblo vase.  The curved form is apparently the result of careless or hurried work,  the original angular form, having come from, a textile source.    [Illustration: _a_, free-hand form. _b_, form imposed, by fabric.  FIG. 482.--Forms of the same motive expressed in different arts.]    [Illustration: _a_, free-hand form. _b_, form imposed by masonry.  FIG. 483.--Forms of the same motive expressed in different arts.]    [Illustration: _a_ _b_ FIG. 484.--Variations resulting from change  of method.]    Many excellent examples illustrative of this tendency to modification  are found in Pueblo art. Much of the ornament applied to pottery is  derived from the sister art, basketry. In the latter art the forms of  decorative figures are geometric and symmetrical to the highest degree,  as I have frequently pointed out. The rays of a radiating ornament,  worked with the texture of a shallow basket, spring from the center and  take uniform directions toward the margin, as shown in Fig. 485. But  when a similar idea derived from basketry (as it could have no other  origin) is executed in color upon an earthen vessel, we observe a  tendency to depart from symmetry as well as from consistency. I call  attention here to the arrangement of the parts merely, not to the  motives employed, as I happen to have no examples of identical figures  from the two arts.    [Illustration: FIG. 485.--Geometric form, of textile ornament.]    [Illustration: FIG. 486.--Loss of geometric accuracy in painting.]    It will be seen by reference to the design given in Fig. 486, taken from  the upper surface of an ancient vase, that although the spirit of the  decoration is wonderfully well preserved the idea of the origin of all  the rays in the center of the vessel is not kept in view, and that by  carelessness in the drawing two of the rays are crowded out and  terminate against the side of a neighboring ray. In copying and  recopying by free-hand methods, many curious modifications take place in  these designs, as, for example, the unconformity which occurs in one  place in the example given may occur at a number of places, and there  will be a series of independent sections, a small number only of the  bands of devices remaining true rays.    [Illustration: FIG. 487.--Design painted upon pottery.]    A characteristic painted design from the interior of an ancient bowl is  shown in Fig. 487, in which merely a suggestion of the radiation is  preserved, although the figure is still decorative and tasteful. This  process of modification goes on without end, and as the true geometric  textile forms recede from view innovation robs the design of all traces  of its original character, producing much that is incongruous and  unsatisfactory.    The growth of decorative devices from the elementary to the highly  constituted and elegant is owing to a tendency of the human mind to  elaborate because it is pleasant to do so or because pleasure is taken  in the result, but there is still a directing and shaping agency to be  accounted for.    I have already shown that such figures as the scroll and the guilloche  are not _necessarily_ developed by processes of selection and  combination of simple elements, as many have thought, since they may  have come into art at a very early stage almost full-fledged; but there  is nothing in these facts to throw light upon the processes by which  ornament followed particular lines of development throughout endless  elaboration. In treating of this point, Prof. C.F. Hartt[2] maintained  that the development of ornamental designs took particular and uniform  directions owing to the structure of the eye, certain forms being chosen  and perpetuated because of the pleasure afforded by movements of the eye  in following them. In connection with this hypothesis, for it is nothing  more, Mr. Hartt advanced the additional idea, that in unison with  the general course of nature decorative forms began with simple  elements and developed by systematic methods to complex forms. Take for  example the series of designs shown in Fig. 488. The meander _a_ made up  of simple parts would, according to Mr. Hartt, by further elaboration  under the supervision of the muscles of the eye, develop into _b_. This,  in time, into _c_, and so on until the elegant anthemium was achieved.  The series shown in Fig. 489 would develop in a similar way, or  otherwise would be produced by modification in free-hand copying of the  rectilinear series. The processes here suggested, although to all  appearances reasonable enough, should not be passed over without careful  scrutiny.

But if I had fled toward  Mira,[5] when I was overtaken at Oriaco, I should still be yonder  where men breathe.

Her fate seems the more pitiable that she does not pray Dante to  seek for her the prayers of any living person. The last words of  Pia are obscure, and are interpreted variously. Possibly the  \"betrothed before\" hints at a source of jealousy as the motive of  her murder.        CANTO VI.

When a game of dice is broken up, he who loses remains sorrowful,  repeating the throws, and, saddened, learns; with the other all  the folk go along; one goes before and one plucks him from  behind, and at his side one brings himself to mind. He does not  stop; listens to one and the other the man to whom he reaches  forth his hand presses on him no longer, and thus from the throng  he defends himself. Such was I in that dense crowd, turning my  face to them this way and that; and, promising, I loosed myself  from them.    Here was the Aretine,[1] who from the fierce arms of Ghin di  Tacco had his death; and the other who was drowned when running  in pursuit. Here Federigo Novello [2] was praying with hands  outstretched, and he of Pisa, who made the good Marzucco seem  strong.[3] I saw Count Orso; and the soul divided from its body  by spite and by envy, as it said, and not for fault committed,  Pierre do la Brosse,[5] I mean; and here let the Lady of Brabant  take forethought, while she is on earth, so that for this she be  not of the worse flock.    [1] The Aretine was Messer Benincasa da Laterina, a learned  judge, who had condemned to death for their crimes two relatives  of Ghin di Tacco, the most famous freebooter of the day, whose  headquarters were between Siena and Rome. Some time after, Messer  Benincasa sitting as judge in Rome, Ghino entered the city with a  band of his followers, made his way to the tribunal, slew  Benincasa, and escaped unharmed.    [2] Another Aretine, of the Tarlati family, concerning whose  death the early commentators are at variance. Benvenuto da Imola  says that, hotly pursuing his enemies, his horse carried him into  a marsh, from which he could not extricate himself, so that his  foes turned upon him and slew him with their arrows.    [3] Federigo, son of the Count Guido Novello, of the  circumstances of whose death, said to have taken place in 1291,  nothing certain is known. Benvenuto says, he was multum probus, a  good youth, and therefore Dante mentions him.    [4] Of him of Pisa different stories are told. Benvenuto says, \"I  have heard from the good Boccaccio, whom I trust more than the  others, that Marzucco was a good man of the city of Pisa, whose  son was beheaded by order of Count Ugolino, the tyrant, who  commanded that his body should remain unburied. In the evening  his father went to the Count, as a stranger unconcerned in the  matter, and, without tears or other sign of grief, said, 'Surely,  my lord, it would be to your honor that that poor body should be  buried, and not left cruelly as food for dogs.' Then the Count,  recognizing him, said astonished, 'Go, your patience overcomes my  obduracy,' and immediately Marzucco went and buried his son.\"    [5] Of Count Orso nothing is known with certainty.    [6] Pierre de is Brosse was chamberlain and confidant of Philip  the Bold of France. He lost the king's favor, and charges of  wrong-doing being brought against him he was hung. It was  reported that his death was brought about through jealousy by  Mary of Brabant, the second wife of Philip. She lived till 1321,  so that Dante's warning may have reached her ears.      When I was free from each and all those shades who prayed only  that some one else should pray, so that their becoming holy may  be speeded, I began, \"It seems that thou deniest to me, O Light  of mine, expressly, in a certain text, that orison can bend  decree of Heaven, and this folk pray only for this, -- shall then  their hope be vain? or is thy saying not rightly clear to me?[1]    [1] Virgil represents Palinurus as begging to be allowed to cross  the Styx, while his body was still unburied and without due  funeral rites. To this petition the Sibyl answers:--Desine fata  Deum flecti sperare precando:--Cease to hope that the decrees of  the gods can be changed by prayer.\"--Aeneid, vi. 376.      And he to me, \"My writing is plain, and the hope of these is not  fallacious, if well it is regarded with sound mind; for top of  judgment vails not itself because a fire of love may, in one  instant, fulfil that which he who is stationed here must satisfy.  And there where I affirmed this proposition, defect was not  amended by a prayer, because the prayer was disjoined from God.  But truly in regard to so deep a doubt decide thou not, unless  she tell thee who shall be a light between the truth and the  understanding.[1] I know not if thou understandest; I speak of  Beatrice.
