This tour popularized her name as the representative of  the oppressed, her eloquence ringing from coast to coast.  In  California Emma Goldman became friendly with the members of the Isaak  family, and learned to appreciate their efforts for the Cause.  Under  tremendous obstacles the Isaaks first published the FIREBRAND and,  upon its suppression by the Postal Department, the FREE SOCIETY.  It  was also during this tour that Emma Goldman met that grand old rebel  of sexual freedom, Moses Harman.    During the Spanish-American war the spirit of chauvinism was at its  highest tide.  To check this dangerous situation, and at the same  time collect funds for the revolutionary Cubans, Emma Goldman became  affiliated with the Latin comrades, among others with Gori, Esteve,  Palaviccini, Merlino, Petruccini, and Ferrara.  In the year 1899  followed another protracted tour of agitation, terminating on the  Pacific Coast.  Repeated arrests and accusations, though without  ultimate bad results, marked every propaganda tour.    In November of the same year the untiring agitator went on a second  lecture tour to England and Scotland, closing her journey with the  first International Anarchist Congress at Paris.  It was at the time of  the Boer war, and again jingoism was at its height, as two years  previously it had celebrated its orgies during the Spanish-American  war.  Various meetings, both in England and Scotland, were disturbed  and broken up by patriotic mobs.  Emma Goldman found on this occasion  the opportunity of again meeting various English comrades and  interesting personalities like Tom Mann and the sisters Rossetti, the  gifted daughters of Dante Gabriel Rossetti, then publishers of the  Anarchist review, the TORCH.  One of her life-long hopes found here  its fulfillment: she came in close and friendly touch with Peter  Kropotkin, Enrico Malatesta, Nicholas Tchaikovsky, W. Tcherkessov,  and Louise Michel.  Old warriors in the cause of humanity, whose  deeds have enthused thousands of followers throughout the world, and  whose life and work have inspired other thousands with noble idealism  and self-sacrifice.  Old warriors they, yet ever young with the  courage of earlier days, unbroken in spirit and filled with the firm  hope of the final triumph of Anarchy.    The chasm in the revolutionary labor movement, which resulted from  the disruption of the INTERNATIONALE, could not be bridged any more.  Two social philosophies were engaged in bitter combat.  The  International Congress in 1889, at Paris; in 1892, at Zurich, and in  1896, at London, produced irreconcilable differences.  The majority  of Social Democrats, forswearing their libertarian past and becoming  politicians, succeeded in excluding the revolutionary and Anarchist  delegates.  The latter decided thenceforth to hold separate  congresses.  Their first congress was to take place in 1900, at  Paris.  The Socialist renegade, Millerand, who had climbed into the  Ministry of the Interior, here played a Judas role.  The congress of  the revolutionists was suppressed, and the delegates dispersed two  days prior to their scheduled opening.  But Millerand had no  objections against the Social Democratic Congress, which was  afterwards opened with all the trumpets of the advertiser's art.    However, the renegade did not accomplish his object.  A number of  delegates succeeded in holding a secret conference in the house of a  comrade outside of Paris, where various points of theory and tactics  were discussed.  Emma Goldman took considerable part in these  proceedings, and on that occasion came in contact with numerous  representatives of the Anarchist movement of Europe.    Owing to the suppression of the congress, the delegates were in  danger of being expelled from France.  At this time also came the bad  news from America regarding another unsuccessful attempt to liberate  Alexander Berkman, proving a great shock to Emma Goldman.  In  November, 1900, she returned to America to devote herself to her  profession of nurse, at the same time taking an active part in the  American propaganda.  Among other activities she organized monster  meetings of protest against the terrible outrages of the Spanish  government, perpetrated upon the political prisoners tortured in  Montjuich.    In her vocation as nurse Emma Goldman enjoyed many opportunities of  meeting the most unusual and peculiar characters.  Few would have  identified the \"notorious Anarchist\" in the small blonde woman,  simply attired in the uniform of a nurse.  Soon after her return from  Europe she became acquainted with a patient by the name of Mrs.  Stander, a morphine fiend, suffering excruciating agonies.  She  required careful attention to enable her to supervise a very  important business she conducted,--that of Mrs. Warren.  In Third  Street, near Third Avenue, was situated her private residence, and  near it, connected by a separate entrance, was her place of business.  One evening, the nurse, upon entering the room of her patient,  suddenly came face to face with a male visitor, bull-necked and of  brutal appearance.  The man was no other than Mr. Jacobs, the  detective who seven years previously had brought Emma Goldman a  prisoner from Philadelphia and who had attempted to persuade her, on  their way to New York, to betray the cause of the workingmen.  It  would be difficult to describe the expression of bewilderment on the  countenance of the man as he so unexpectedly faced Emma Goldman, the  nurse of his mistress.  The brute was suddenly transformed into a  gentleman, exerting himself to excuse his shameful behavior on the  previous occasion.  Jacobs was the \"protector\" of Mrs. Stander, and  go-between for the house and the police.  Several years later, as one  of the detective staff of District Attorney Jerome, he committed  perjury, was convicted, and sent to Sing Sing for a year.  He is now  probably employed by some private detective agency, a desirable  pillar of respectable society.    In 1901 Peter Kropotkin was invited by the Lowell Institute of  Massachusetts to deliver a series of lectures on Russian literature.  It was his second American tour, and naturally the comrades were  anxious to use his presence for the benefit of the movement.  Emma  Goldman entered into correspondence with Kropotkin and succeeded in  securing his consent to arrange for him a series of lectures.  She  also devoted her energies to organizing the tours of other well known  Anarchists, principally those of Charles W. Mowbray and John Turner.  Similarly she always took part in all the activities of the movement,  ever ready to give her time, ability, and energy to the Cause.    On the sixth of September, 1901, President McKinley was shot by Leon  Czolgosz at Buffalo.  Immediately an unprecedented campaign of  persecution was set in motion against Emma Goldman as the best known  Anarchist in the country.  Although there was absolutely no  foundation for the accusation, she, together with other prominent  Anarchists, was arrested in Chicago, kept in confinement for several  weeks, and subjected to severest cross-examination.  Never before in  the history of the country had such a terrible man-hunt taken place  against a person in public life.  But the efforts of police and press  to connect Emma Goldman with Czolgosz proved futile.  Yet the episode  left her wounded to the heart.  The physical suffering, the  humiliation and brutality at the hands of the police she could bear.  The depression of soul was far worse.  She was overwhelmed by  realization of the stupidity, lack of understanding, and vileness  which characterized the events of those terrible days.  The attitude  of misunderstanding on the part of the majority of her own comrades  toward Czolgosz almost drove her to desperation.  Stirred to the very  inmost of her soul, she published an article on Czolgosz in which she  tried to explain the deed in its social and individual aspects.  As  once before, after Berkman's act, she now also was unable to find  quarters; like a veritable wild animal she was driven from place to  place.  This terrible persecution and, especially, the attitude of  her comrades made it impossible for her to continue propaganda.  The  soreness of body and soul had first to heal.  During 1901-1903 she  did not resume the platform.  As \"Miss Smith\" she lived a quiet life,  practicing her profession and devoting her leisure to the study of  literature and, particularly, to the modern drama, which she  considers one of the greatest disseminators of radical ideas and  enlightened feeling.    Yet one thing the persecution of Emma Goldman accomplished.  Her name  was brought before the public with greater frequency and emphasis  than ever before, the malicious harassing of the much maligned  agitator arousing strong sympathy in many circles.  Persons in  various walks of life began to get interested in her struggle and her  ideas.  A better understanding and appreciation were now beginning to  manifest themselves.    The arrival in America of the English Anarchist, John Turner, induced  Emma Goldman to leave her retirement.  Again she threw herself into  her public activities, organizing an energetic movement for the  defense of Turner, whom the Immigration authorities condemned to  deportation on account of the Anarchist exclusion law, passed after  the death of McKinley.    When Paul Orleneff and Mme. Nazimova arrived in New York to acquaint  the American public with Russian dramatic art, Emma Goldman became  the manager of the undertaking.  By much patience and perseverance  she succeeded in raising the necessary funds to introduce the Russian  artists to the theater-goers of New York and Chicago.  Though  financially not a success, the venture proved of great artistic  value.  As manager of the Russian theater Emma Goldman enjoyed some  unique experiences.  M. Orleneff "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21630"],[0,"Bibliomania in the Middle Ages (#5)"],[1,"arranged; not squeezed too tight, lest it should injure or confuse them,  but so placed that they might be easily distinguished, and those who  sought them might find them without delay or impediment.[18]  Bibliomaniacs have not been remarkable for their memory or punctuality,  and in the early times the borrower was often forgetful to return the  volume within the specified time. To guard against this, many rules were  framed, nor was the armarian allowed to lend the books, even to  neighboring monasteries, unless he received a bond or promise to restore  them within a certain time, and if the person was entirely unknown, a  book of equal value was required as a security for its safe return. In  all cases the armarian was instructed to make a short memorandum of the  name of the book which he had lent or received. The \"great and precious  books\" were subject to still more stringent rules, and although under the  conservation of the librarian, he had not the privilege of lending them  to any one without the distinct permission of the abbot.[19] This was,  doubtless, practised by all the monastic libraries, for all generously  lent one another their books. In a collection of chapter orders of the  prior and convent of Durham, bearing date 1235, it is evident that a  similar rule was observed there, which they were not to depart from  except at the desire of the bishop.[20] According to the constitutions  for the government of the Abingdon monastery, the library was under the  care of the Cantor, and all the writings of the church were consigned to  his keeping. He was not allowed to part with the books or lend them  without a sufficient deposit as a pledge for their safe return, except to  persons of consequence and repute.[21] This was the practice at a much  later period. When that renowned bibliomaniac, Richard de Bury, wrote his  delightful little book called _Philobiblon_, the same rules were strictly  in force. With respect to the lending of books, his own directions are  that, if any one apply for a particular volume, the librarian was to  carefully consider whether the library contained another copy of it; if  so, he was at liberty to lend the book, taking care, however, that he  obtained a security which was to exceed the value of the loan; they were  at the same time to make a memorandum in writing of the name of the book,  and the nature of the security deposited for it, with the name of the  party to whom it was lent, with that of the officer or librarian who  delivered it.[22]    We learn by the canons before referred to, that the superintendence of  all the writing and transcribing, whether in or out of the monastery,  belonged to the office of the armarian, and that it was his duty to  provide the scribes with parchment and all things necessary for their  work, and to agree upon the price with those whom he employed. The monks  who were appointed to write in the cloisters he supplied with copies for  transcription; and that no time might be wasted, he was to see that a  good supply was kept up. No one was to give to another what he himself  had been ordered to write, or presume to do anything by his own will or  inclination. Nor was it seemly that the armarian even should give any  orders for transcripts to be made without first receiving the permission  of his superior.[23]    We here catch a glimpse of the quiet life of a monkish student, who  labored with this monotonous regularity to amass his little library. If  we dwell on these scraps of information, we shall discover some marks of  a love of learning among them, and the liberality they displayed in  lending their books to each other is a pleasing trait to dwell upon. They  unhesitatingly imparted to others the knowledge they acquired by their  own study with a brotherly frankness and generosity well becoming the  spirit of a student. This they did by extensive correspondence and the  temporary exchange of their books. The system of loan, which they in  this manner carried on to a considerable extent, is an important feature  in connection with our subject; innumerable and interesting instances of  this may be found in the monastic registers, and the private letters of  the times. The cheapness of literary productions of the present age  render it an absolute waste of time to transcribe a whole volume, and  except with books of great scarcity we seldom think of borrowing or  lending one; having finished its perusal we place it on the shelf and in  future regard it as a book of reference; but in those days one volume did  the work of twenty. It was lent to a neighboring monastery, and this  constituted its publication; for each monastery thus favored, by the aid  perhaps of some half dozen scribes, added a copy to their own library,  and it was often stipulated that on the return of the original a correct  duplicate should accompany it, as a remuneration to its author. Nor was  the volume allowed to remain unread; it was recited aloud at meals, or  when otherwise met together, to the whole community. We shall do well to  bear this in mind, and not hastily judge of the number of students by a  comparison with the number of their books. But it was not always a mere  single volume that the monks lent from their library. Hunter has  printed[24] a list of books lent by the Convent of Henton, A. D. 1343, to  a neighboring monastery, containing twenty volumes. The engagement to  restore these books was formally drawn up and sealed.    In the monasteries the first consideration was to see that the library  was well stored with those books necessary for the performance of the  various offices of the church, but besides these the library ought,  according to established rules, to contain for the \"edification of the  brothers\" such as were fit and needful to be consulted in common study.  The Bible and great expositors; _Bibliothecae et majores expositores_,  books of martyrs, lives of saints, homilies, etc.;[25] these and other  large books the monks were allowed to take and study in private, but the  smaller ones they could only study in the library, lest they should be  lost or mislaid. This was also the case with respect to the rare and  choice volumes. When the armarian gave out books to the monks he made a  note of their nature, and took an exact account of their number, so that  he might know in a moment which of the brothers had it for perusal.[26]  Those who studied together were to receive what books they choose; but  when they had satisfied themselves, they were particularly directed to  restore them to their assigned places; and when they at any time received  from the armarian a book for their private reading, they were not allowed  to lend it to any one else, or to use it in common, but to reserve it  especially for his own private reading. The same rule extended to the  singers, who if they required books for their studies, were to apply to  the abbot.[27] The sick brothers were also entitled to the privilege of  receiving from the armarian books for their solace and comfort; but as  soon as the lamps were lighted in the infirmary the books were put away  till the morning, and if not finished, were again given out from the  library.[28] In the more ancient monasteries a similar case was observed  with respect to their books. The rule of St. Pacome directed that the  utmost attention should be paid to their preservation, and that when the  monks went to the refectory they were not to leave their books open, but  to carefully close and put them in their assigned places. The monastery  of St. Pacome contained a vast number of monks; every house, says  Mabillon, was composed of not less than forty monks, and the monastery  embraced thirty or forty houses. Each monk, he adds, possessed his book,  and few rested without forming a library; by which we may infer that the  number of books was considerable.[29] Indeed, it was quite a common  practice in those days, scarce as books were, to allow each of the monks  one or more for his private study, besides granting them access to the  library. The constitutions of Lanfranc, in the year 1072, directed the  librarian, at the commencement of Lent, to deliver a book to each of the  monks for their private reading, allowing them a whole year for its  perusal.[30] There is one circumstance connected with the affairs of the  library quite characteristic of monkish superstition, and bearing painful  testimony to their mistaken ideas of what constituted \"good works.\" In  Martene's book there is a chapter, _De Scientia et Signis_--degrading and  sad; there is something withal curious to be found in it. After enjoining  the most scrupulous silence in the church, in the refectory, in the  cloister, and in the dormitory, at all times, and in all seasons;  transforming those men into perpetual mutes, and even when \"actually  necessary,\" permitting only a whisper to be articulated \"in a low voice  in the ear,\" _submissa voce in aure_, it then proceeds to describe a  series of fantastic grimaces which the monks were to perform on applying  to the armarian for books. The general sign for a book, _generali signi  libri_, was to \"extend the hand and make a movement as if turning over  the leaves of a book.\" For a missal the monk was to make a similar  movement with a sign of the cross; for the gospels the sign of the cross  on the forehead; for an antiphon or book of responses he was to strike  the thumb and little finger of the other hand together; for a book of  offices or gradale to make the sign of a cross and kiss the fingers; for  a tract lay the hand on the abdomen and apply the other hand to the  mouth; for a capitulary make the general sign and extend the clasped  hands to heaven; for a psalter place the hands upon the head in the form  of a crown, such as the king is wont to wear.[31] Religious intolerance  was rampant when this rule was framed; hot and rancorous denunciation was  lavished with"]]]
