In England this  period extends from about 1180 to 1200; in Scotland it extends  considerably into the thirteenth century. The characteristics of the  style are the gradual introduction of the pointed arch and its use  along with some of the decorative features of the Norman style. \"The  pointed arch shows the advent of the new style, but the ornaments of the  old style continue to linger for a time. The first pointed style was not  complete till these old ornaments were abandoned, and the more vigorous  enrichments of the new style were introduced. The other constructive  features of the Norman style gradually changed at the same time as the  arch. The buttresses by degrees assumed the projecting form of the first  pointed style, and the pinnacles and spires of the latter style were in  course of time introduced.\"[15]      3. SCOTTISH FIRST POINTED PERIOD    \"The pointed Gothic style which had its origin in the north of France  about the middle of the twelfth century appeared in England about 1170,  but can scarcely be said to have reached Scotland till after the close  of the twelfth century.... The pointed arch, for example, although  generally adopted, did not entirely displace, as it had done in the  south, the round form of the Normans, a feature which, especially in  doorways, continued to be employed not only in the thirteenth century,  but throughout the whole course of Gothic art in Scotland. In other  respects the thirteenth century style in this country corresponds very  closely with that of England. Its features are however, generally  speaking, plainer and the structures are smaller.\"[16]    \"This new departure sprung from the necessity which arose for the  invention of an elastic system of vaulting which should admit of all the  arches, forming vaults over spaces of any form or plan, being carried to  the same height at the ridge. This requirement led to the introduction  of the pointed arch in the vaulting, and from that departure it soon  spread to all the other arched features of the architecture.\"[17]  Architecture, which had hitherto been confined to the monasteries, was  now undertaken by laymen, and while the great monasteries were either  rebuilt or founded, the cathedrals mostly belong to this period. To  these attention was chiefly devoted, and the number of parish churches  constructed was comparatively small. This partly arose from the large  number of parish churches built during the Norman period. In Scotland  the cathedrals of St. Andrews, Dunblane, Glasgow (the choir and crypt),  Elgin, Brechin, Dunkeld, Caithness, the choir of St. Magnus in Orkney  and Galloway belong in whole or in part to this epoch.[18]      4. SCOTTISH MIDDLE POINTED OR DECORATED PERIOD    The period from 1214 to 1286 comprised the first pointed work in  Scotland. The country was during the time prosperous, and is believed to  have been more wealthy than at any time till after the Union with  England.[19] The disputed succession after the death of Alexander III.  gave Edward I. the opportunity of asserting his claims to the Scottish  throne; war followed, and with it poverty and barbarism. \"The first note  of contest,\" says Dr. Joseph Robertson, \"banished every English priest,  monk, and friar from the northern realm. Its termination was followed by  the departure of those great Anglo-Norman lords--the flower of the  Scottish baronage--who, holding vast possessions in both countries, had  so long maintained among the rude Scottish hills the generous example of  English wealth and refinement. Then it was that De la Zouche and De  Quincy, Ferrars and Talbot, Beaumont and Umfraville, Percy and Wake,  Moubray and Fitz-Warine, Balliol and Cumyn, Hastings and De Coursi,  ceased to be significant names beyond the Tweed--either perishing in  that terrible revolution or withdrawing to their English domains, there  to perpetuate in scutcheon and pedigree the memory of their rightful  claims to many of the fairest lordships of Albany, and to much of the  reddest blood of the north.\"[20] This had a twofold consequence to  architecture. Comparatively few buildings arose in the north, and these  were in a smaller scale. And England now becoming an hereditary enemy,  no longer supplied models for the churches north of the Tweed, which  received the impress of France. In England the First Pointed was  succeeded about 1272 by the Middle Pointed or Decorated, which swayed  for about a century, being succeeded by the Third Pointed or  Perpendicular, whose reign, beginning about 1377, ended with the  Reformation.[21] The Decorated style did not reach Scotland till it had  passed away in England, and the Scottish representatives of the style  are scanty in number and late in date.[22] When the country revived  after the long struggle with England, and building began towards the  close of the fourteenth or the beginning of the fifteenth century, few  new works were undertaken, energy and resources were concentrated on the  rebuilding or completion of the edifices that had been destroyed or left  unfinished. This period, along with the Third Pointed in Scotland, is  regarded as the work of native architects.[23]      5. SCOTTISH THIRD OR LATE POINTED PERIOD    The Middle Pointed passed by a gentle gradation into the Late Pointed  style, and it is difficult to say when the one ceased and the other  began. Yet there are some characteristics of the Third Pointed which are  peculiar to it and render it a distinct epoch. The large churches are  nearly all restorations, and no new churches of great size were  undertaken. The Scottish churches are usually smaller in size than the  English ones, and consist of single compartments without aisles. The  east end frequently terminates with a three-sided apse--a feature which  owes its origin to the Scottish alliance and intercourse with France.  The leading and distinguishing feature is, however, the vaulting--the  pointed barrel vault being almost universally employed. The windows of  these churches are necessarily low, so as to allow the point of the  arch-head to come beneath the spring of the main vault. The buttresses  are generally somewhat stunted. The windows are almost always pointed,  and contain simple tracery derived from the earlier styles. The doorways  are generally of the old round-headed form, with late foliage and  enrichments. Porches are occasionally introduced, and coats of arms are  commonly carved on shields of the period, and are useful in determining  the dates of portions of the buildings. Towers were generally erected or  intended, and are somewhat stunted, finished with short spires, having  small dormer windows inserted in them. Monuments are of frequent  occurrence, and are frequently placed in arched and canopied recesses.  Richly carved sacrament-houses are occasionally introduced, and perhaps  some of the good carving may be due to the French masons who were  numerous in Scotland during the reigns of James IV. and James V. The  structures of the period were either parish or collegiate churches.[24]          CHAPTER III      1. DIOCESE OF ST. ANDREWS    The connection between St. Andrews and the neighbouring Pictish Church  at Abernethy was, during the early period, very close. Dr. Skene thinks  that the first church at Abernethy was built during the visit of St.  Ninian to the Southern Picts, or the people living between the Forth and  the territory south of the Grampians; it was endowed with lands by King  Nectan in 460 A.D., and dedicated to St. Bride;[25] and between 584 and  596, during St. Columba's visit, and as a result of his mission, a  church was rebuilt by Gartnaidh, King of the Picts.[26] St. Columba is  distinctly stated to have preached among the tribes on the banks of the  Tay,[27] and to have been assisted in this work by St. Cainnech, who  founded a church in the east end of the province of Fife, near where the  Eden pours its waters into the German Ocean, at a place called  Rig-Monadh, or the royal mount, which afterwards became famous as the  site on which the church of St. Andrews was founded, and as giving to  that place the name of Kilrimont.[28] The earliest Celtic church at St.  Andrews was probably, like that of Iona, constructed with wattles and  turf and roofed with thatch. It was customary to have caves or places  of retirement for the hermits; they were used, too, as oratories or  places of penance, and one such there is at St. Andrews, known as St.  Rule's cave:--        Where good Saint Rule his holy lay,      From midnight to the dawn of day,      Sang to the billows' sound.[29]    The connection of the place with St. Andrew has no historical basis till  between 736 and 761, when a cathedral was dedicated to St. Andrew, and a  portion of his relics was brought by Acca, Bishop of Northumbria, who  was banished from that country in 732, and founded a church among the  Picts. Dr. Skene points to the similarity of the events which succeeded  one another in Northumbria and Southern Pictland in the eighth century.  In the former country the Columban clergy were expelled, secular clergy  were introduced, dedications were made to St. Peter, and afterwards  Hexham was dedicated to St. Andrew and received the relics of the  Apostle, brought there by one of its bishops; in the latter country,  sixty years later, the Picts expelled the Columban monks, introduced the  secular clergy, placed the kingdom under the patronage of St. Peter, and  then receiving from some unknown quarter the relics of St. Andrew,  founded the church in honour of that Apostle, who became the national  patron-saint.[30] This \"cathedral,\" dedicated to St. Andrew, was  probably of stone, and was the church intervening between the early  Celtic Church and that of St. Regulus. Angus, King of the Picts, endowed  it with lands.    On the destruction of Iona by the Danes, the bishopric was first  transferred to Dunkeld (850-864); then to Abernethy (865-"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21692"],[0,"The Pirate City: An Algerine Tale (#5)"],[1,"right to propitiate their consul; but, as you are aware, the treaties  which we have recently formed with various nations are not to our  advantage.  The peace recently forced upon us by America has stopped  suddenly the annual flow of a very considerable amount of tribute, (see  Note 1), and the constant efforts made by that nation of ill-favoured  dogs, the British, to bring about peace between us and Portugal will, I  fear, soon dry up another source of revenue, if things go on as they  have been doing of late, it is plain to me that we shall soon be at  peace with all the world, and be under the necessity of turning our  hands to farming or some such work for a livelihood!\"    \"Fear not, Sidi Omar,\" replied the Dey, with a short laugh, \"this fair  and ancient city has lived too long by war to be capable of  condescending now to arts of peace.  We shall have no difficulty in  picking a quarrel with any nation that seems most desirable when our  coffers begin to grow empty--in regard to which, let us be thankful,  they show no signs at present.  But have a care, Omar, how you speak  disrespectfully of the British.  They are apt, like their representative  at your heels, to spring when you least expect it, and they have  powerful claws and teeth.  Besides, they are my very good friends, and  some of their statesmen have a great regard for me.  Being at war, as  you know, with some of the most powerful European nations just now, they  know that I do them good service in the Mediterranean by rendering trade  difficult and hazardous to all except those with whom I am at peace.  Spain being on friendly terms with us at present, I will receive the  Spanish consul.  Go, let him know my pleasure, and see that thou hast my  scrivano instilled with all requisite information to refute him.\"    Sidi Omar bowed low, and retired without venturing a reply.  At the same  time a man of curious aspect stepped from the doorway which conducted  from the terrace to the lower parts of the house.  His Eastern costume  was almost equal to that of the Dey in magnificence, but there was a  tinselly look about the embroidery, and a glassy sheen in the jewels,  which, added to the humorous and undignified cast of his countenance,  bespoke him one of low degree.  He was the Dey's story-teller, and  filled much the same office at the palace that was held by court jesters  in the olden time.  The presence of some such individual in Achmet's  court, even in the first quarter of the present century, was rendered  necessary by the fact that the Dey himself had risen from the ranks, and  was an illiterate man.    Advancing towards his master with a freedom that no other domestic of  the palace would have dared to assume, he, with affected solemnity,  demanded an audience.    \"I cannot refuse it, Hadji Baba, seeing that thou dost swagger into my  presence unbidden,\" said Achmet, with a smile, as he sat down in the  usual oriental fashion--cross-legged on a low couch--and patted the head  of the noble animal which he had chosen as his companion, and which  appeared to regard him with the affection of a dog--    \"What may be your news?\"    \"I have no news,\" replied Baba, with humility.  \"News cannot be conveyed  to one who knows all things, by one who is a dog and knows nothing.\"    \"Thou knowest at all events how to look well after that which concerns  thyself,\" replied the Dey.  \"What hast thou to say to me?\"    \"That the man with the proboscis, who struts when he walks, and snivels  when he speaks, desires a favour of your highness.\"    \"Speak not in riddles,\" returned the Dey sharply.  \"I have no time to  waste with thee to-day.  Say thy say and be gone.\"    Hadji Baba, who was indeed thoroughly alive to his own interest, was  much too prudent to thwart the humour of his master.  Briefly, though  without changing his tone or manner, he informed him that the Spanish  consul awaited his pleasure below.    \"Let him wait,\" said the Dey, resuming the pipe which for some minutes  he had laid aside, and caressing the lion's head with the other hand.    \"May I venture to say that he seems anxious?\" added the story-teller.    \"How much did he give thee for thus venturing to interrupt me, at the  risk of thy head?\" demanded the Dey sternly.    \"Truly,\" replied the jester, with a rueful air, \"not much more than  would buy gold thread to sew my head on again, were your highness  pleased to honour me by cutting it off.\"    \"Be gone, caitiff,\" said the Dey, with a slight smile.    Baba vanished without further reply.    Meanwhile Sidi Omar left the palace and directed his steps to his own  quarters, which stood on the little fortified island in front of  Algiers.  This islet, having been connected with the mainland by a pier  or neck of masonry about a hundred yards long, formed the insignificant  harbour which gave shelter to the navy of small craft owned by the  pirates.  At the present day the French have constructed there a  magnificent harbour, of which that now referred to is a mere corner in  the vicinity of the old light-house.  Although small, the port was well  fortified, and as the Minister of Marine descended towards it, his eye  glanced with approval over the double and treble tiers of guns which  frowned from its seaward battlements.  In passing over the connecting  pier, Sidi Omar paused to observe a gang of slaves at work repairing  some of the buildings which covered the pier stretching from the  mainland to the island.    Although slaves, they were not of the black colour or thick-lipped,  flat-nosed aspect which we are apt to associate with the name of slave.  They were, indeed, burnt to the deepest brown, and many of them also  blistered, by the sun, but they were all \"white men,\" and contemptuously  styled, by their Mohammedan task-masters, Christians.  The pier on which  they wrought had been constructed long before by thirty thousand such  slaves; and the Algerine pirates, for above three centuries previous to  that, had expended the lives of hundreds of thousands of them in the  building of their fortifications and other public works; in the  cultivation of their fields and gardens, and in the labours of their  domestic drudgery.    Some of the slaves thus observed by the Minister of Marine had been  sailors and merchants and mechanics, military and naval officers,  clerks, scholars, and other gentlefolks from Italy, Portugal, America,  and all the lands which chanced to be \"at war\" with his highness the  Dey.  Formerly there had been hosts of English, French, Spanish,  etcetera, but their governments having bowed their heads, opened their  purses, and sent consuls to the piratical city, they were now graciously  exempted from thraldom.  It was hardish work for men accustomed to  cooler climates to be obliged, in the sunshine of an African summer, to  harness themselves to carts like oxen, and lift huge stones and hods of  mortar with little more than a ragged shirt and trousers to cover them  from the furnace-heat of day or the dews of night.  Men who carry  umbrellas and wear puggeries now-a-days on the Boulevard de la  Republique of Algiers have but a faint conception of what some of their  forefathers endured down at the \"Marina\" not much more than fifty years  ago, and of what they themselves could endure, perhaps, if fairly tried!  It must not be supposed, however, that all the slaves stood the trial  equally well.  Some were old, others were young; some were feeble,  others strong; all were more or less worn--some terribly so.    Yonder old man carrying the block of stone which might tax the energies  of a stout youth, and to whom a taskmaster has just administered a cut  with the driving-whip, looks like one who has seen better days.  Even in  his ragged shirt, broken-brimmed straw hat, and naked feet, he looks  like a gentleman.  So he is; and there is a gentle lady and a stout son,  and two sweet daughters, in Naples, who are toiling almost as hard as he  does--if hours be allowed to count for pains--in order to make up his  ransom.  The strong bull-necked man that follows him with a hod of  mortar is an unmistakable seaman of one of the Mediterranean ports.  He  is a desperate character, and in other lands might be dangerous; but he  is safe enough here, for the bastinado is a terrible instrument of  torture, and the man is now not only desperate in wrath, but is  sometimes desperately frightened.  His driver takes a fiendish pleasure  in giving him an extra cut of the whip, just to make him apparently a  willing horse, whether he will or not.  The poor youth beside him is a  very different character.  His training has been more gentle, and his  constitution less robust, for he has broken down under the cruel toil,  and is evidently in the last stages of consumption.  The taskmaster does  not now interfere with him as he was wont to do when he first arrived.  He knows that the day is not far distant when neither the bastinado nor  any other species of torture will have power to force work out of him.  He also knows that overdriving will only shorten the days of his  usefulness; he therefore wisely lets him stagger by unmolested, with his  light load.    But why go on enumerating the sorrows of these slaves?  Sidi Omar looked  at them with a careless glance, until he suddenly caught sight of  something that caused his eyes to flash and his brows to contract.  A  sbirro, or officer of justice, stood near him, whether by chance or  otherwise we know not.  Touching the sbirro on the shoulder, he pointed  to a group under the shade of an archway, and said in a low tone--    \"Go, fetch hither that scoundrel Blindi.\"    The sbirro at once stepped towards the group, which consisted of two  persons.  One was an old, apparently dying, slave; the other was a  strong middle-aged man, in a quaint blue gown, who knelt by his side,  and poured something from a flask into his mouth.    The sbirro seized this man rudely by the neck, "]]]
