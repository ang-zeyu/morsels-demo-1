This was soon found not to be severe, and the lad was laid at the foot  of the king's bed, glad and proud to hear the king's words of praise.    Then Sir Bedevere entered, saying that the murderers had fled as soon  as they found they were discovered.    'But, my lord king,' he said, 'this is no murderous attempt by one  insolent lord. It means, my king, that thou wilt have to fight for thy  kingdom. It is civil war!'    'What mean you, Sir Bedevere?'    'Sir Turquine is but one of them, my king,' replied Bedevere. 'He is  but the tool of the six kings who have put such great despite upon you.  For with them also in this midnight murder-raid I saw King Nentres of  Garlot and Duke Cambenet.'    Suddenly, as he spoke, the tall grey form of Merlin took shape before  them, for so great and marvellous was the power of this wizard, that he  could come and go unseen, except when he willed that men should see  him.    'Sir,' said Merlin, 'ye owe your life to this brave lad here, and he  shall be a passing good man when he shall have attained his full  strength, and he doth deserve your high and gracious favour.'    'That shall he have,' said the king, and smiled at young Owen, and the  smile made the lad forget all the burning of his wound for very pride  and gladness.    'And now,' said Merlin, 'if ye will gather your men I will lead you to  the hold of those murderous kings by a secret way, and ye should give  them such a sudden blow as will discomfit them.'    In a little while all was ready, and then, silently, with muffled arms,  the men of Arthur were marching forth down the narrow dark lanes of the  town to where the place was ruinous with old houses left forsaken by  their Roman masters when they had gone from Britain fifty years before.    Merlin led them to a great squat tower which stood beside the wall,  wherein a single light gleamed at a high window. Causing some to  surround this place, Merlin led others to a broken door, and there they  entered in. Then was there a sudden uproar and fierce fighting in the  rooms and up the narrow stairs.    In the darkness King Lot, with a hundred knights, burst out through a  rear door, and thought to escape; but King Arthur with his knights  waylaid them, and slew on the right and on the left, doing such deeds  that all took pride in his bravery and might of arms. Fiercely did King  Lot press forward, and to his aid came Sir Caradoc, who set upon King  Arthur in the rear.    Arthur drew from his side the sword he had so marvellously taken from  the stone, and in the darkness it flashed as if it were thirty torches,  and it dazzled his enemies' eyes, so that they gave way.    By this time the common people of Caerleon had heard the great outcry  and the clang of swords on armour. Learning of the jeopardy of their  beloved king from midnight murderers, they ran to the tower, and with  clubs and staves and bills they slew many of the men of the evil kings,  putting the rest to flight. But the six kings were still unharmed, and  with the remnant of their knights fled and departed in the darkness.    A few days later King Arthur journeyed back to London, and on an  evening when, in the twilight, he stood upon the roof of the palace  overlooking the broad Thames, he was aware of a shadow beside him where  no shadow had been before. Before he could cross himself against the  evil powers of wizardry and glamour, the steel-blue eyes of Merlin  looked out from the cloud, and the magician's voice spoke to him as if  from a great distance.    'I stand beneath the shaggy brows of the Hill of Tanyshane,' said the  voice, 'and I look down into the courtyard of the castle of King Lot.  There I see the gathering of men, the flash of torches on their  hauberks, the glitter of helms, and the blue gleams of swords. I have  passed through these northern lands, from the windswept ways of Alclwyd  to the quaking marshes of the Humber. Eleven castles have I seen, and  each is filled with the clang of beating iron, the glow of smiths'  fires and the hissing of new-tempered steel. Call thy council, and  abide my return, for now you must fight for your kingdom, O king, and  for your very life.'    The voice ceased, and the shadow and the vivid eyes it half concealed  died away with it.    Into the council-chamber three days later, while men waited for they  knew not what, Merlin entered.    'What news do you bring, Merlin?' they cried.    'Of civil war!' he said. 'I warn you all that the six kings ye gave a  check to at Caerleon have taken to themselves four others and a mighty  duke. They will to thrust Arthur, whom they call base-born, out of his  life. Mark you, they are passing strong and as good fighting men as any  alive--pity it is that great Uriens is with them, the wisest and  noblest fighter of them all!--and unless Arthur have more men of arms  and chivalry with him than he can get within this realm, he will be  overcome!'    'Oh, but we be big enough!' cried some.    'That ye are not!' said Merlin. 'Which of ye have single-handed beaten  back the pagan hordes from your lands? Which of ye can match King Lot  for subtlety and craft, or the great Uriens of Reged for wisdom in  war?'    'What is to do, then? Tell us your counsel,' said they all.    'This is my advice,' replied the wizard. 'Ye must send an embassy to  King Ban of Brittany and King Bors of Gaul, promising to aid them when  King Claudas, their common enemy, shall fight them again, if they will  come and aid our king in this his fight for life and kingdom.'    In a few weeks this was done. King Ban of Brittany and his brother,  King Bors, crossed into Britain with five thousand good knights, sworn  to aid Arthur in this great conflict.    With King Ban came his son, young Lancelot, who was later to make more  fame and more dole than any knight of Arthur's court.    On a day in early spring, the hosts of Arthur and his two allies were  encamped in Sherwood Forest, and the fore-riders or scouts, which  Merlin had sent out, came hastening in to say that the host of the  eleven kings was but a few miles to the north of Trent water. By secret  ways, throughout that night, Merlin led the army of Arthur until they  came near where the enemy lay. Then did he order an ambush to be made  by some part of their men, with King Ban and King Bors, by hiding in a  hollow filled with trees.    In the morning, when either host saw the other, the northern host was  well comforted, for they thought King Arthur's force was but small.    With the pealing of trumpets and the shouts of the knights, King Arthur  ordered his men to advance, and in their midst was the great silken  banner with the fierce red dragon ramping in its folds. This had been  blessed by the Archbishop of London at a solemn service held before the  host left London.    All day the battle raged. Knight hurled and hurtled against knight,  bowmen shot their short Welsh arrows, and men-at-arms thrust and maimed  and slashed with the great billhooks and spears.    King Arthur, with his bodyguard of four--Sir Kay, Sir Baudwin, Sir  Ulfius, and Sir Bedevere--did feats of arms that it was marvel to see.  Often the eleven kings did essay to give deadly strokes upon the king,  but the press of fighting kept some of them from him, and others  withdrew sore wounded from the attack upon him and his faithful four.    Once the five held strong medley against six of the rebel kings, and  these were King Lot, King Nentres, King Brandegoris, King Idres, King  Uriens, and King Agwisance; and so fiercely did they attack them that  three drew off sore wounded, whilst King Lot, King Uriens and King  Nentres were unhorsed, and all but slain by the men-at-arms.    At length it appeared to Arthur that his host was yielding before the  weight of numbers of the enemy, and then he bethought him of a  strategy. He took counsel of his nobles, and they approved; he sent a  trusty messenger to the Kings Ban and Bors, who still lay in ambush;  and then, commanding his trumpets to sound, he ordered a retreat.    As had been agreed on, the knights on Arthur's side made their retreat  in a confusion that seemed full of fear; and the enemy, joyfully  shouting their cries of triumph, pursued them headlong.    King Lot's host, led onward thus unthinking, were sure of victory. But  their cries of triumph were short and quickly turned to woe; for when  they had passed the place of ambush, they heard cries of terror in  their rear, and turning, they found a great host pouring forth from the  hollow combe, thick as angry bees from a hive.    Then, indeed, taken in the rear and in the front, there was little hope  of victory, and King Lot's men fought for dear life.    Seeing King Bors, where he hewed terribly in the press of battle, King  Lot, who knew him well, cried out:    'Ah, Mary, now defend us from death and from horrible maims, for I see  well we be in fear of quick death! Yonder is King Bors, one of the most  worshipful and best knights in the world; and there is his twin  brother, King Ban, as terrible as he. How came they and their host into  Britain, and we not know it, alas?'    'By the arts of that wizard Merlin, I doubt not,' said King Uriens.  'And I doubt not we shall all be sped. Look you, Lot,' he went on,  'whoever that Arthur may be, I'll swear by my head he is not of  low-born breeding, but a very man and a marvellous fighter.'    'If you lose heart now, why, go and swear fealty to him!' sneered King  Lot.    'Keep your sneers,' said Uriens sternly. 'I'll pay the price of  rebellion to my last breath, as I have vowed.'    By now the great mass of King Lot's host was either slain or run away,  and the evening drew on; but the eleven kings, wounded, spent, and full  of anguish at defeat, drew together with a few hundred"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22397"],[0,"Shakespearean Playhouses (#5)"],[1,"Council over actors  and acting.    In 1573 the situation seems to have approached a crisis. The Lord  Mayor had become strongly puritanical, and in his efforts to suppress  \"stage-plays\" was placing more and more obstacles in the way of the  actors. The temper of the Mayor is revealed in two entries in the  records of the Privy Council. On July 13, 1573, the Lords of the  Council sent a letter to him requesting him \"to permit liberty to  certain Italian players\"; six days later they sent a second letter,  repeating the request, and \"marveling that he did it not at their  first request.\"[28] His continued efforts to suppress the drama  finally led the troupes to appeal for relief to the Privy Council. On  March 22, 1574, the Lords of the Council dispatched \"a letter to the  Lord Mayor to advertise their Lordships what causes he hath to  restrain plays.\" His answer has not been preserved, but that he  persisted in his hostility to the drama is indicated by the fact that  in May the Queen openly took sides with the players. To the Earl of  Leicester's troupe she issued a special royal license, authorizing  them to act \"as well within our city of London and liberties of the  same, as also within the liberties and freedoms of any our cities,  towns, boroughs, etc., whatsoever\"; and to the mayors and other  officers she gave strict orders not to interfere with such  performances: \"Willing and commanding you, and every of you, as ye  tender our pleasure, to permit and suffer them herein without any your  lets, hindrances, or molestation during the term aforesaid, any act,  statute, proclamation, or commandment heretofore made, or hereafter to  be made, to the contrary notwithstanding.\"    [Footnote 28: Dasent, _Acts of the Privy Council_, VIII, 131, 132.]    This license was a direct challenge to the authority of the Lord  Mayor. He dared not answer it as directly; but on December 6, 1574, he  secured from the Common Council the passage of an ordinance which  placed such heavy restrictions upon acting as virtually to nullify the  license issued by the Queen, and to regain for the Mayor complete  control of the drama within the city. The Preamble of this remarkable  ordinance clearly reveals the puritanical character of the City  Government:         Whereas heretofore sundry great disorders and inconveniences       have been found to ensue to this city by the inordinate       haunting of great multitudes of people, specially youths, to       plays, interludes, and shews: namely, occasion of frays and       quarrels; evil practises of incontinency in great inns       having chambers and secret places adjoining to their open       stages and galleries; inveigling and alluring of maids,       specially orphans and good citizens' children under age, to       privy and unmeet contracts; the publishing of unchaste,       uncomly, and unshamefaced speeches and doings; withdrawing       of the Queen's Majesty's subjects from divine service on       Sundays and holy days, at which times such plays were       chiefly used; unthrifty waste of the money of the poor and       fond persons; sundry robberies by picking and cutting of       purses; uttering of popular, busy, and seditious matters;       and many other corruptions of youth, and other enormities;       besides that also sundry slaughters and maimings of the       Queen's subjects have happened by ruins of scaffolds,       frames, and stages, and by engines, weapons, and powder used       in plays. And whereas in time of God's visitation by the       plague such assemblies of the people in throng and press       have been very dangerous for spreading of infection.... And       for that the Lord Mayor and his brethren the Aldermen,       together with the grave and discreet citizens in the Common       Council assembled, do doubt and fear lest upon God's       merciful withdrawing his hand of sickness from us (which God       grant), the people, specially the meaner and most unruly       sort, should with sudden forgetting of His visitation,       without fear of God's wrath, and without due respect of the       good and politique means that He hath ordained for the       preservation of common weals and peoples in health and good       order, return to the undue use of such enormities, to the       great offense of God....[29]    [Footnote 29: For the complete document see W.C. Hazlitt, _The English  Drama and Stage_, p. 27.]    The restrictions on playing imposed by the ordinance may be briefly  summarized:    1. Only such plays should be acted as were free from all unchastity,  seditiousness, and \"uncomely matter.\"    2. Before being acted all plays should be \"first perused and allowed  in such order and form, and by such persons as by the Lord Mayor and  Court of Aldermen for the time being shall be appointed.\"    3. Inns or other buildings used for acting, and their proprietors,  should both be licensed by the Lord Mayor and the Aldermen.    4. The proprietors of such buildings should be \"bound to the  Chamberlain of London\" by a sufficient bond to guarantee \"the keeping  of good order, and avoiding of\" the inconveniences noted in the  Preamble.    5. No plays should be given during the time of sickness, or during any  inhibition ordered at any time by the city authorities.    6. No plays should be given during \"any usual time of divine service,\"  and no persons should be admitted into playing places until after  divine services were over.    7. The proprietors of such places should pay towards the support of  the poor a sum to be agreed upon by the city authorities.    In order, however, to avoid trouble with the Queen, or those noblemen  who were accustomed to have plays given in their homes for the private  entertainment of themselves and their guests, the Common Council  added, rather grudgingly, the following proviso:         Provided alway that this act (otherwise than touching the       publishing of unchaste, seditious, and unmeet matters) shall       not extend to any plays, interludes, comedies, tragedies, or       shews to be played or shewed in the private house, dwelling,       or lodging of any nobleman, citizen, or gentleman, which       shall or will then have the same there so played or shewed       in his presence for the festivity of any marriage, assembly       of friends, or other like cause, without public or common       collections of money of the auditory or beholders thereof.    Such regulations if strictly enforced would prove very annoying to the  players. But, as the Common Council itself informs us, \"these orders  were not then observed.\" The troupes continued to play in the city,  protected against any violent action on the part of the municipal  authorities by the known favor of the Queen and the frequent  interference of the Privy Council. This state of affairs was not, of  course, comfortable for the actors; but it was by no means desperate,  and for several years after the passage of the ordinance of 1574 they  continued without serious interruption to occupy their inn-playhouses.    The long-continued hostility of the city authorities, however, of  which the ordinance of 1574 was an ominous expression, led more or  less directly to the construction of special buildings devoted to  plays and situated beyond the jurisdiction of the Common Council. As  the Reverend John Stockwood, in _A Sermon Preached at Paules Crosse,  1578_, indignantly puts it:         Have we not _houses of purpose_, built with great charges       for the maintenance of plays, and that _without the       liberties_, as who would say \"_There, let them say what they       will say, we will play!_\"    Thus came into existence playhouses; and with them dawned a new era in  the history of the English drama.    [Illustration: THE SITE OF THE FIRST PLAYHOUSES    Finsbury Field and Holywell. The man walking from the Field towards  Shoreditch is just entering Holywell Lane.    (From Agas's _Map of London_, representing the city as it was about  1560.)]          CHAPTER III    THE THEATRE      The hostility of the city to the drama was unquestionably the main  cause of the erection of the first playhouse; yet combined with this  were two other important causes, usually overlooked. The first was the  need of a building specially designed to meet the requirements of the  players and of the public, a need yearly growing more urgent as plays  became more complex, acting developed into a finer art, and audiences  increased in dignity as well as in size. The second and the more  immediate cause was the appearance of a man with business insight  enough to see that such a building would pay. The first playhouse, we  should remember, was not erected by a troupe of actors, but by a  money-seeking individual.[30] Although he was himself an actor, and  the manager of a troupe, he did not, it seems, take the troupe into  his confidence. In complete independence of any theatrical  organization he proceeded with the erection of his building as a  private speculation; and, we are told, he dreamed of the \"continual  great profit and commodity through plays that should be used there  every week.\"    [Footnote 30: I emphasize this point because the opposite is the  accepted opinion. We find it expressed in _The Cambridge History of  English Literature_, VI, 431, as follows: \"Certain players, finding  the city obdurate, and unwilling to submit to its severe regulations,  began to look about them for some means of carrying on their business  out of reach of the mayor's authority,\" etc.]    This man, \"the first builder of playhouses,\"--and, it might have been  added, the pioneer in a new field of business,--was James Burbage,  originally, as we are told by one who knew him well, \"by occupation a  joiner; and reaping but a small living by the same, gave it over and  became a common player in plays.\"[31] As an actor he was more  successful, for as early as 1572 we find him at the head"]]]
