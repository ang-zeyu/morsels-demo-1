It has been called  a small fort, an amphitheatre, a stadium, and several other things.  But a fort should be larger and would indeed be somewhat hard to account  for at this spot; while a stadium should have a rounded end and, if it  was of orthodox length, would have extended outside the town into or  almost into the Severn. Interest attaches to a water-channel along the  main (north and south) street. This was found to have at intervals slits  in each side which were plainly meant for sluice-gates to be let down;  Mr. Bushe-Fox thinks that the channel was a water-supply, and not an  outfall, and that by the sluice-gates the water was dammed up so as,  when needed, to flow along certain smaller channels into the private  houses which stood beside the road. If so, the discovery has much  interest; the arrangement is peculiar, but no other explanation seems  forthcoming.    Small finds were many and good. Mr. Bushe-Fox gathered 571 coins ranging  from three British and one or two Roman Republican issues, to three  early coins of the Emperor Arcadius, over 200 Samian potters' stamps,  and much Samian datable to the period about A.D. 75-130, with a few rare  pieces of the pre-Flavian age. There was a noticeable scarcity of both  Samian and coins of the post-Hadrianic, Antonine period; it was also  observed that recognizable 'stratified deposits' did not occur after the  age of Hadrian. Among individual objects attention is due to a small  seal-box, with wax for the seal actually remaining in it.    It appears that it will probably not be possible to continue this  excavation, even on a limited scale, next summer. Mr. Bushe-Fox's report  for 1913 is noticed below, p. 52.    (xvi) _Lincoln._ At Lincoln an inscribed fragment found in 1906 has now  come to light. It bears only three letters, IND, being the last letters  of the inscription; these plainly preserve a part of the name of the  town, Lindum. See below, p. 34.    (xvii) _Gloucester._ Here, in March 1914, a mosaic floor, 16 feet  square, with a complex geometrical pattern in red, white, and blue, has  been found 9 feet below the present surface, at 22 Northgate Street.  Some painted wall-plaster from the walls of the room to which it  belonged were found with it.    (xviii) Discoveries in _London_ have been limited to two groups of  rubbish-pits in the City, (_a_) At the General Post Office the pits  opened in 1913 (see my Report, p. 22) were further carefully explored  in 1914 by Mr. F. Lambert, Mr. Thos. Wilson, and Dr. Norman; the Post  Office gave full facilities. Over 100 'potholes' were detected, of which  about forty yielded more or less datable rubbish, mainly potsherds.  Four contained objects of about A.D. 50-80, though not in great  quantity--four bits of decorated Samian and eight Samian stamps--and  fourteen contained objects of about A.D. 70-100; the rest seemed to  belong to the second century, with some few later items intermixed.  One would infer that a little rubbish was deposited here before the  Flavian period, but that after about A.D. 70 or 80 the site was freely  used as a rubbish-ground for three generations or more. Two objects may  be noted, a gold ring bearing the owner's initials Q. D. D. and a bit  of inscribed wood from the lining of a well or pit (p. 35). (_b_) At the  top of King William Street, between Sherborne Lane and Abchurch Lane,  not so far from the Mansion House, five large pits were opened in the  summer of 1914, in the course of ordinary contractors' building work.  They could not be so minutely examined as the Post Office pits, but  it was possible to observe that their datable potsherds fell roughly  within the period A.D. 50-100, and that a good many potsherds were  earlier than the Flavian age; there must have been considerable deposit  of rubbish here before A.D. 70 or thereabouts, and it must have ceased  about the end of the century. A full account of both groups of pits was  given to the Society of Antiquaries by Mr. F. Lambert on February 11,  1915; illustrated notices of the Post Office finds were contributed by  Mr. Thos. Wilson to the Post Office Magazine, _St. Martin-le-Grand_  (January and July, 1914); Mr. D. Atkinson helped with the dating of the  pottery.    Much gratitude is due to those who have so skilfully collaborated to  achieve these results. So far as it is permissible to argue from two  sites only, they seem to throw real light on the growth of the earliest  Roman London. The Post Office pits lie in the extreme north-west of the  later Londinium, just inside the walls; the King William Street pits  are in its eastern half, not far from the east bank of the now vanished  stream of Wallbrook, which roughly bisected the whole later extent of  the town. It may be assumed that, at the time when the two groups of  pits were in use, the inhabited area had not yet spread over their  sites, though it had come more or less close. That would imply that the  earliest city lay mainly, though perhaps not wholly, on the east bank  of Wallbrook; then, as the houses spread and the town west of Wallbrook  developed, the King William Street pits were closed, while the Post  Office pits came more into use, during and after the Flavian age.    This conclusion is tentative. It must be remembered that the  stratification of rubbish-pits, ancient as well as modern, is often very  peculiar. It is liable to be confused by all sorts of cross-currents.  In particular, objects are constantly thrown into rubbish-pits many  years, perhaps even centuries, after those objects have passed out of  use. Whenever, even in a village, an old cottage is pulled down or a new  one built, old rubbish gets shifted to new places and mixed with rubbish  of a quite different age. At Caerwent, as Dr. T. Ashby once told me, a  deep rubbish-pit yielded a coin of about A.D. 85 at a third of the way  down, and at the very bottom a coin of about 315. That is, the pit was  in use about or after 315; some one then shovelled into it debris of  much earlier date. The London pits now in question are, however, fairly  uniform in their contents, and their evidence may be utilized at least  as a base for further inquiries.    (xix-xxii) _Rural dwellings._ Three Roman 'villas'--that is,  country-houses or farms--have been explored in 1914. All are small.    [Illustration: FIG. 12. BATH-HOUSE, EAST GRIMSTEAD]    (xix) At _East Grimstead_, five miles south-east from Salisbury, on  Maypole Farm near Churchway Copse[5], a bath-house has been dug out and  planned by Mr. Heywood Sumner, to whom I owe the following details. The  building (fig. 12) measures only 14 x 28 feet and contains only four  rooms, (1) a tile-paved apartment which probably served as entrance and  dressing-room, (2) a room over a pillared hypocaust, which may be called  the tepidarium, (3) a similar smaller room, nearer the furnace and  therefore perhaps hotter, which may be the caldarium--though really it  is hardly worth while to distinguish between these two rooms--and (4) a  semicircular bath, lined with pink mortar and fine cement, warmed with  flues from rooms 3 and with box-tiles, and provided with an outfall  drain; east of rooms 3 and 4 was the furnace. Small finds included  window glass, potsherds, two to three hundred oyster-shells, and five  Third Brass coins (two Constantinian, three illegible). Large stone  foundations have been detected close by; presumably this was the  detached bath-house for a substantial residence which awaits excavation.  Such detached bath-houses are common; I may instance one found in 1845  at Wheatley (Oxon.), which had very similar internal arrangements and  stood near a substantial dwelling-house not yet explored (_Archaeol.  Journal_, ii. 350). A full description of the Grimstead bath, by Mr.  Sumner, is in the press.    [Footnote 5: The words Church, Chapel, and Chantry often form parts of  the names of Roman sites, where the ruined masonry has been popularly  mistaken for that of deserted ecclesiastical buildings.]    (xx) Three miles south-west of Guildford, at Limnerslease in the  parish of _Compton_, Mr. Mill Stephenson has helped to uncover a house  measuring 53 x 76 feet, with front and back corridors, and seven rooms,  including baths. Coins suggested that it was inhabited in the early  fourth century--a period when our evidence shows that many  Romano-British farms and country-houses were occupied.[6]    [Footnote 6: I may refer to my _Romanization of Britain_ (third edition,  p. 77). This does not, of course, mean that they were not also occupied  earlier.]    [Illustration: FIG. 13. HOUSE AT NORTH ASH, KENT]    (xxi) A third house is supplied by Kent. This was found in June about  six miles south of Gravesend, near the track from _North Ash_ to  Ash Church, on the farm of Mr. Geo. Day. Woodland was being cleared for  an orchard, flint foundations were encountered, and the site was then  explored by Mr. Jas. Kirk, Mr. S. Priest, and others of the Dartford  Antiquarian Society, to whom I am indebted for information: the Society  will in due course issue a full Report. The spade (fig. 13) revealed a  rectangular walled enclosure of 53 x 104 feet. The entrance was at  the east end; the dwelling-rooms (including a sunk bath, 7 feet square,  lined with plaster) were, so far as traced, in the west and south-west  portion; much of the walled space may have been farmyard or wooden  sheds. Many bits of Samian and other pottery were found (among them  a mortarium stamped MARTINVSF), and many oyster-shells. Other  Romano-British foundations have been suspected close by.    The structure somewhat resembles the type of farm-house which might  fairly be called, from its best-known example--the only one now  uncovered to view--the Carisbrooke type.[7] That, however, usually has  rooms at both"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19116"],[0,"How to Sing (#5)"],[1,"still troubles me.    _Niem._ Indeed; and what do you practise?    _I._ Long, slow scales.    _Niem._ Even if you are hoarse?    _I._ Yes; if I want to sing, or have to, I try it.    _Niem._ Well, what are they? Show me.    _The great scale, the infallible cure._    I showed them to him; he sang them, with words of abuse in the  meantime; but gradually his hoarseness grew better. He did not send  word of his inability to appear in the evening, but sang, and better  than ever, with enormous success.    I myself had to sing _Norma_ in Vienna some years ago, and got up in  the morning quite hoarse. By nine o'clock I tried my infallible  remedy, but could not sing above A flat, though in the evening I  should have to reach high D flat and E flat. I was on the point of  giving up, because the case seemed to me so desperate. Nevertheless, I  practised till eleven o'clock, half an hour at a time, and noticed  that I was gradually getting better. In the evening I had my D flat  and E flat at my command and was in brilliant form. People said they  had seldom heard me sing so well.    I could give numberless instances, all going to show that you never  can tell early in the day how you are going to feel in the evening. I  much prefer, for instance, not to feel so very well early in the day,  because it may easily happen that the opposite may be the case later  on, which is much less agreeable. If you wish to sing only when you  are in good form, you must excuse yourself ninety-nine times out of a  hundred. You must learn to know your own vocal organs thoroughly and  be able to sing; must do everything that is calculated to keep you in  good condition. This includes chiefly rest for the nerves, care of the  body, and gymnastics of the voice, that you may be able to defy all  possible chances.    Before all, never neglect to practise every morning, regularly, proper  singing exercises through the whole compass of the voice. Do it with  _painful_ seriousness; and never think that vocal gymnastics weary the  singer. On the contrary, they bring refreshment and power of endurance  to him who will become master of his vocal organs.          SECTION V    EQUALIZING THE VOICE; BREATH; FORM      Through the lowering of the pillars of the fauces, which is the same  as raising the soft palate, the outflowing breath is divided into two  parts.    I have sketched the following representation of it:--    Division of the breath.    By raising the pillars of the fauces, which closes off the throat from  the cavities of the head, the chest voice is produced; that is, the  lowest range of all kinds of voices. This occurs when the main stream  of breath, spreading over against the high-arched palate, completely  utilizes all its resonating surfaces. This is the palatal resonance,  in which there is the most power (Plate A).    [Illustration: A    Red lines denote division of the breath in palatal resonance, lower  range of male and female voices.]    When the soft palate is raised high behind the nose, the pillars of  the fauces are lowered, and this frees the way for the main stream of  breath to the head cavities. This now is poured out, filling the nose,  forehead, and head cavities. This makes the head tone. Called head  tone in women, falsetto in men, it is the highest range of all classes  of voices, the resonance of the head cavities (Plate C).    [Illustration: C    Resonance of the cavity of the forehead.    Red lines denote division of the breath in the resonance of the head  cavity, high range.]    Between these two extreme functions of the palate and breath, one  stream of breath gives some of its force to the other; and when  equally divided they form the medium range of all classes of voices  (Plate B).    [Illustration: B    Red lines denote division of the breath in the middle range.]    The singer must always have in his mind's eye a picture of this  divided stream of breath.    As I have already said, in the lowest tones of all voices the main  stream of breath is projected against the palate; the pillars of the  fauces, being stretched to their fullest extent, and drawn back to the  wall of the throat, allow _almost_ no breath to reach the head  cavities.    I say _almost_ none, for, as a matter of fact, a branch stream of  breath, however small, must be forced back, behind and above the  pillars, first into the nose, later into the forehead and the cavities  of the head. This forms the overtones (head tones) which must vibrate  with all tones, even the lowest. These overtones lead over from the  purest chest tones, slowly, with a constantly changing mixture of both  kinds of resonance, first to the high tones of bass and baritone, the  low tones of tenor, the middle tones of alto and soprano, finally, to  the purest head tones, the highest tones of the tenor-falsetto or  soprano. (See the plates.)    The extremely delicate gradation of the scale of increase of the  resonance of the head cavities in ascending passages, and of increase  of palatal resonance in descending, depends upon the skill to make the  palate act elastically, and to let the breath, under control of the  abdominal and chest pressure, flow uninterruptedly in a gentle stream  into the resonating chambers. Through the previous preparation of the  larynx and tongue, it must reach its resonating surfaces as though  passing through a cylinder, and must circulate in the form previously  prepared for it, proper for each tone and vowel sound. This form  surrounds it gently but firmly. The supply of air remains continuously  the same, _rather increasing than diminishing_, notwithstanding the  fact that the quantity which the abdominal pressure has furnished the  vocal cords from the supply chamber is a very small one. That it may  not hinder further progression, the form must remain elastic and  sensitive to the most delicate modification of the vowel sound. If the  tone is to have life, it must always be able to conform to any vowel  sound. The least displacement of the form or interruption of the  breath breaks up the whirling currents and vibrations, and  consequently affects the tone, its vibrancy, its strength, and its  duration.    In singing a continuous passage upward, the form becomes higher and  more pliant; the most pliable place on the palate is drawn upward.  (See Plate A.)    When I sing a single tone I can give it much more power, much more  palatal or nasal resonance, than I could give in a series of ascending  tones. In a musical figure I must attack the lowest note in such a way  that I can easily reach the highest. I must, therefore, give it much  more head tone than the single tone requires. (Very important.) When  advancing farther, I have the feeling on the palate, above and behind  the nose, toward the cavities of the head, of a strong but very  elastic rubber ball, which I fill like a balloon with my breath  streaming up far back of it. And this filling keeps on in even  measure. That is, the branch stream of the breath, which flows into  the head cavities, must be free to flow very strongly without  hindrance. (See Plate B.)    I can increase the size of this ball above, to a pear shape, as soon  as I think of singing higher; and, indeed, I heighten the form  _before_ I go on from the tone just sung, making it, so to speak,  _higher_ in that way, and thus keep the form, that is, the  \"propagation form,\" ready for the next higher tone, which I can now  reach easily, as long as no interruption in the stream of breath  against the mucous membrane can take place. For this reason the breath  must _never be held back_, but must always be emitted in a more and  more powerful stream. The higher the tone, the more numerous are the  vibrations, the more rapidly the whirling currents circulate, and the  more unchangeable must the form be.    Catarrh often dries up the mucous membrane; then the tones are  inclined to break off. At such times one must sing with peculiar  circumspection, and with an especially powerful stream of breath  behind the tone: it is better to take breath frequently. In a  descending scale or figure I must, on the contrary, preserve very  carefully the form taken for the highest tone. I must not go higher,  nor yet, under any circumstances, lower, but must imagine that I  remain at the same pitch, and must suggest to myself that I am  striking the same tone again. The form may gradually be a little  modified at the upper end: that is, the soft palate is lowered very  carefully behind the nose: keeping almost always to the form employed  for the highest tone, sing the figure to its end, toward the nose,  with the help of the vowel _oo_. (This auxiliary vowel _oo_ means  nothing more than that the larynx is slowly lowered in position.)    When this happens, the resonance of the head cavities is diminished,  that of the palate increased; for the soft palate sinks, and the  pillars of the fauces are raised more and more. Yet the head tone must  not be entirely free from palatal resonance. Both remain to the last  breath united, mutually supporting each other in ascending and  descending passages, and alternately but inaudibly increasing and  diminishing.    These things go to make up the form:--    The raising and lowering of the soft palate, and the corresponding  lowering and raising of the pillars of the fauces.    The proper position of the tongue: the tip rests on the lower front  teeth--mine even as low as the roots of the teeth.    The back of the tongue must stand high and free from the throat, ready  for any movement. A furrow must be formed in the tongue, which is  least prominent in the lowest tones, and in direct head tones may even  completely disappear. As soon as the tone demands the palatal  resonance, the furrow must be made prominent and kept so. In my case  it can always be seen. This is one of the most important matters, upon  which too much emphasis can hardly be laid. As soon as the furrow in  the"]]]
