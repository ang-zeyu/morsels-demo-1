The German declaration of war on Russia at once dispersed all doubts and  hesitations in the many millions of the population of the Russian  Empire. Some may put in the forefront of this war the struggle with the  uncivilizing militarism of Prussia. Others may see in it, above all  things, a struggle for the national principle and for the inured rights  of nationalities--Serbians, Poles, and Belgians. Others, again, see in  the war the only means of securing the peaceful future of Russia and her  allies from the extravagant pretensions of Germany. But all alike feel  that this war is a great, popular, liberating work, which starts a new  epoch in the history of the world. Thus the war against united Germany  and Austria-Hungary has become in Russia a truly national war. That is  the enormous difference between it and the war with Japan, whose  political grounds and objects, apart from self-defense against a hostile  attack, were alien to the public conscience.    There is one other consideration which cannot be passed over in silence.  In Russia many are convinced, and others instinctively feel, that a  victorious war will contribute to the internal recovery and regeneration  of the State. Many barriers have already fallen, national and political  feuds have been softened, new conditions are being created for the  mutual relations of the people and the Government. There is every reason  to think that some members of the Government--unfortunately, it is true,  not all--have understood that at the present time of complete national  union many of the old methods of administration and all the old  Government psychology are not only out of place, but simply impossible.  In one question, the Polish, this conviction has received the supreme  sanction of the sovereign and of the Commander in Chief, and a striking  expression in the latter's manifesto to the Poles. Further than this,  the actual attitude of Russian Liberals and Radicals toward a whole  series of problems and relations cannot fail to be changed. Thus the war  will help to reconcile and soften many internal contradictions in  Russia.    How far we are, with this state of public opinion and these perspectives  of the internal development of Russia, from those fantastic pictures of  civil disunion and revolutionary conflagration which were anticipated  before the war and have sometimes been, even since the war, portrayed in  the German and Austro-Hungarian press! Our enemies counted on these  domestic divisions, and they have made a bitter mistake. Constitutional  Russia, precisely because of the radical internal transformation which  it has experienced in the period that began with the Japanese war, has  proved to be fully equal to the immense universal and national task that  has devolved upon it. The national and political consciousness of Russia  not only has not weakened, but has wonderfully strengthened and taken  shape. As one who has had a close and constant share in the struggle for  the Russian Constitution, I can only note with the greatest satisfaction  the striking result of Russia's entry into the number of constitutional  States, a result which has so plainly showed itself in the tremendous  part that Russia is playing in the great world-crisis of 1914.          Prince Trubetskoi's Appeal to Russians to Help the Polish Victims of War    [Russkia Vedomosti, No. 231, Oct. 8, (21,) 1914, P. 2.]      A new era of Russian-Polish relations has begun, and the noble  initiative of A.J. Konovalov, who has donated 10,000 rubles for the  needs of the war victims of Poland, offers a shining testimony.    Up to the present the Polish people have had relations with official  Russia only. The war has brought them for the first time into immediate  touch with _the Russian people_. Thousands of Polish exiles have gone  forth to our central provinces. In Moscow alone there are not less than  1,000 former inhabitants of Kalisz, to say nothing of fleeing people  from other provinces. Moscow, of course, attracts the largest number of  these unfortunates. Some particular instinctive faith draws the Poles to  Moscow, to the centre of popular Russia. To my query why she had chosen  Moscow among all Russian cities, a poor Polish woman, the wife of a  reservist, said:    \"I was sent here by the military chief. 'Go to Moscow,' said he. 'You  won't perish there.'\"    And indeed in Moscow the Polish exiles have not perished. They have  found here brotherly love, shelter, and food. The municipality of  Moscow, numerous philanthropists, both Polish and Russian, are rendering  them assistance.    It is needless to describe the impression made upon the Poles by this  attitude of the people of Russia. A prominent municipal worker of the  City of Kalisz, with tears in his eyes, told me: \"Up to the present  moment Poland has been segregated from Russia by a wall of officialdom  erected by the Germans; now for the first time this wall has been broken  down, two peoples are seeing each other and feeling each other.\"    A tremendous process of mutual understanding has begun before our eyes!  It has barely begun as yet; for what has been accomplished by Russia for  Poland is but a drop as compared with what still remains to be done. It  is not enough to help the Polish immigrants in our central provinces.  Our help must be carried to the provinces devastated by the German and  Austrian hordes. Right there the scenes of misery make the hair stand  upon our heads.    Let us realize that the City of Kalisz alone has suffered not less than  40,000,000 rubles in loss of property. Representatives of Polish  municipalities with whom I had opportunity to discuss the situation told  me that in the City of Kalisz there is no longer a single drug store,  nor a grocery store, and there were about three thousand of them before.    There are numerous cities and villages where everything has been  pillaged by the German requisitions. Horses, cows, food, even  mattresses, have been taken away, and for all these ironical receipts  have been tendered: \"So much worth of goods have been taken; the payment  for same will be made by the Russian Government.\"    Owing to the destruction of the inventory and the stock in the villages,  there is nothing to till the soil with, and the fields have to remain  unseeded.    Poland is indeed the Belgium of Russia. Belgium is aided by England and  France, but there is nobody to help Poland except us. The appeal of the  Commander in Chief has promised, in case of Russian victory, the  political regeneration of Poland, with her own religion, with her own  language, and with her own self-government. But before the political  regeneration we have to think of the saving of the unfortunate country  from starvation.    _This must be above all our national, Russian affair._ Let the  exhausted, suffering people of Poland feel that the people of Russia are  their real brothers; let them see that our words are backed up by deeds.  Perhaps in this way we shall forever clear away their ancient distrust  toward us, a distrust which unfortunately had ground in the past  relations between Russia and Poland.    We are not speaking of a commonplace charity at the present moment.  There is need for a help which should mark the beginning of a historical  change in the lives of both peoples. Both peoples should not only  silence their material sufferings, but they should draw a spiritual  comfort from this great historical trial and make it a source of their  moral vigor.    They should feel that their sufferings and their sacrifices have not  been in vain, that no matter what their further resolutions might be the  popular affair should by all means be carried on right now, and that  irrespective of the outcome of the present war one tremendous result has  already been accomplished. The Polish affair has already become a  Russian national affair. And this means that henceforth there shall be  no discrepancy between words and deeds in the relations of both peoples.    The whole might of the people of Russia and their ideals, expressed by  the Supreme Commander in Chief, shall be the bond for the Poles,  guaranteeing them the realization of the dreams of their forefathers for  the resurrection of Poland.    Let us Russians prepare this resurrection and help it by all means  within our power. Now or never the aid to the suffering people of Poland  shall grow into a national Russian demonstration. Let all Russian papers  throw open their columns for subscriptions for aid to the people of  Poland suffering from war, without prejudice to their religion and race.  As the funds will be forthcoming, a national Russian committee shall be  organized to take charge of their distribution.    Let us not fear for the modest beginnings. The tremendous wave of  sympathy and love which has now swept over the Russian people can create  wonders, if need be, for the success of the Russian national issue.    Let us hope that wonders will happen even now. I myself witnessed in our  neighborhood the following dramatic scene: The small provincial City of  Kaluga was getting ready in August to receive the wounded. Unexpectedly  it got many times more than at first had been contemplated. The wounded  had to be placed on the floor, without straw, without linen, without  food. But within two days all were comfortably placed, fed, and clothed.  _Unknown_ persons secured straw, other _unknown_ persons sent  mattresses, linens, and pillows, _unknown peasants_ brought food from  their villages.    All this was done as a matter of course, without a previous concert,  without any organization, through an elementary popular movement.    This elementary movement which can heal the wounds is needed at this  moment in most tremendous proportions. It is not a question of a few  wounded individuals, not even a question of thousands of wounded, but  the problem of a whole wounded Polish nation.    Let the great"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18891"],[0,"Dot and the Kangaroo (#5)"],[1,"must go and tell  it to the whole bush. So they flew away, and far and near, for hours,  the bush echoed with chuckling and cackling, and wild bursts of  laughter, as the kookooburras told that grand joke everywhere.    \"Now,\" said the Kookooburra, when all the others had gone, \"a bit of  snake is just the right thing for breakfast. Will you have some, little  Human?\"    Dot shuddered at the idea of eating snake for breakfast, and the  Kookooburra thought she was afraid of being poisoned.    \"It won't hurt you,\" he said kindly, \"I took care that it did not bite  itself. Sometimes they do that when they are dying, and then they're not  good to eat. But this snake is all right, and won't disagree like  cockchafers: the scales are quite soft and digestible,\" he added.    But Dot said she would rather wait for the berries the Kangaroo was  bringing, so the Kookooburra remarked that if she would excuse it he  would like to begin breakfast at once, as the fight had made him hungry.  Then Dot saw him hold the reptile on the branch with his foot, whilst he  took its tail into his beak, and proceeded to swallow it in a leisurely  way. In fact the Kookooburra was so slow that very little of the snake  had disappeared when the Kangaroo returned.    [Illustration: THE FIGHT BETWEEN THE KOOKOOBURRA AND THE SNAKE]    The Kangaroo had brought a pouch full of berries, and in her hand  a small spray of the magic ones, by eating which Dot was able to  understand the talk of all the bush creatures. All the time she was  wandering in the bush the Kangaroo gave her some of these to eat daily,  and Dot soon found that the effect of these strange berries only lasted  until the next day.    The Kangaroo emptied out her pouch, and Dot found quite a large  collection of roots, buds, and berries, which she ate with good  appetite.    The Kangaroo watched her eating with a look of quiet satisfaction.    \"See,\" she said, \"how easily one can live in the bush without hurting  anyone; and yet Humans live by murdering creatures and devouring them.  If they are lost in the scrub they die, because they know no other way  to live than that cruel one of destroying us all. Humans have become so  cruel, that they kill, and kill, not even for food, but for the love of  murdering. I often wonder,\" she said, \"why they and the dingoes are  allowed to live on this beautiful kind earth. The Black Humans kill and  devour us; but they, even, are not so terrible as the Whites, who  delight in taking our lives, and torturing us just as an amusement.  Every creature in the bush weeps that they should have come to take the  beautiful bush away from us.\"    Dot saw that the sad brown eyes of the Kangaroo were full of tears, and  she cried too, as she thought of all that the poor animals and birds  suffer at the hands of white men. \"Dear Kangaroo,\" she said, \"if I ever  get home, I'll tell everyone of how you unhappy creatures live in fear,  and suffer, and ask them not to kill you poor things any more.\"    But the Kangaroo sadly shook her head, and said, \"White Humans are  cruel, and love to murder. We must all die. But about your lost way,\"  she continued in a brisk tone, by way of changing this painful subject;  \"I've been asking about it, and no one has seen it anywhere. Of course  someone must know where it is, but the difficulty is to find the right  one to ask.\" Then she dropped her voice, and came a little nearer to  Dot, and stooping down until her little black hands hung close to the  ground, she whispered in Dot's ear, \"They say I ought to consult the  Platypus.\"    \"Could the Platypus help, do you think?\" Dot asked.    \"I _never_ think,\" said the Kangaroo, \"but as the Platypus never goes  anywhere, never associates with any other creature, and is hardly ever  seen, I conclude it knows everything--it must, you know.\"    \"Of course,\" said Dot, with some doubt in her tone.    \"The only thing is,\" continued the Kangaroo, once more sitting up and  pensively scratching her nose. \"The only thing is, I can't bear the  Platypus; the sight of it gives me the creeps: it's such a queer  creature!\"    \"I've never seen a Platypus,\" said Dot. \"Do tell me what it is like!\"    \"I couldn't describe it,\" said the Kangaroo, with a shudder, \"it seems  made up of parts of two or three different sorts of creatures. None of  us can account for it. It must have been an experiment, when all the  rest of us were made: or else it was made up of the odds and ends of the  birds and beasts that were left over after we were all finished.\"    Little Dot clapped her hands. \"Oh, dear Kangaroo,\" she said, \"do take me  to see the Platypus! there was nothing like that in my Noah's ark.\"    \"I should say not!\" remarked the Kangaroo. \"The animals in the Ark said  they were each to be of its kind, and every sort of bird and beast  refused to admit the Platypus, because it was of so many kinds; and at  last Noah turned it out to swim for itself, because there was such a  row. That's why the Platypus is so secluded. Ever since then no Platypus  is friendly with any other creature, and no animal or bird is more than  just polite to it. They couldn't be, you see, because of that trouble in  the Ark.\"    \"But that was so long ago,\" said Dot, filled with compassion for the  lonely Platypus; \"and, after all, this is not the same Platypus, nor are  all the bush creatures the same now as then.\"    \"No,\" returned the Kangaroo, \"and some say there was no Ark, and no fuss  over the matter, but that, of course, doesn't make any difference, for  it's a very ancient quarrel, so it must be kept up. But if we are to go  to the Platypus we had better start now; it is a good time to see it--so  come along, little Dot,\" said the Kangaroo.          CHAPTER IV      \"Good-bye, Kookooburra!\" cried Dot, as they left the cave; and the bird  gave her a nod of the head, followed by a wink, which was supposed to  mean hearty good-will at parting. He would have spoken, only he had  swallowed but part of the Snake, and the rest hung out of the side of  his beak, like an old man's pipe; so he couldn't speak. It wouldn't have  been polite to do so with his beak full.    Dot was so rested by her sleep all night that she did not ride in the  Kangaroo's pouch; but they proceeded together, she walking, and her  friend making as small hops as she could, so as not to get too far  ahead. This was very difficult for the Kangaroo, because even the  smallest hops carried her far in front. After a time they arranged that  the friendly animal should hop a few yards, then wait for Dot to catch  her up, and then go on again. This she did, nibbling bits of grass as  she waited, or playing a little game of hide-and-seek behind the bushes.    Sometimes when she hid like this, Dot would be afraid that she had lost  her Kangaroo, and would run here and there, hunting round trees, and  clusters of ferns, until she felt quite certain she had lost the kind  animal; when suddenly, clean over a big bush, the Kangaroo would bound  into view, landing right in front of her. Then Dot would laugh, and rush  forward, and throw her arms around her friend; and the Kangaroo, with a  quiet smile, would rub her little head against Dot's curls, and they  were both very happy. So, although it was a long and rough way to the  little creek where the Platypus lived, it did not seem at all far.    The stream ran at the bottom of a deep gully, that had high rocky sides,  with strangely shaped trees growing between the rocks. But, by the  stream, Dot thought they must be in fairyland; it was so beautiful. In  the dark hollows of the rocks were wonderful ferns; such delicate ones  that the little girl was afraid to touch them. They were so tender and  green that they could only grow far away from the sun, and as she peeped  into the hollows and caves where they grew, it seemed as if she was  being shown the secret store-house of Nature, where she kept all the  most lovely plants, out of sight of the world. A soft carpet seemed to  spring under Dot's feet, like a nice springy mattress, as she trotted  along. She asked the Kangaroo why the earth was so soft, and was told  that it was not earth, but the dead leaves of the tree-ferns above them,  that had been falling for such a long, long time, that no kangaroo could  remember the beginning.    Then Dot looked up, and saw that there was no sky to be seen; for they  were passing under a forest of tree-ferns, and their lovely spreading  fronds made a perfect green tent over their heads. The sunlight that  came through was green, as if you were in a house made of green glass.  All up the slender stems of these tall tree-ferns were the most  beautiful little plants, and many stems were twined, from the earth to  their feather-like fronds, with tender creeping ferns--the fronds of  which were so fine and close, that it seemed as if the tree-fern were  wrapped up in a lovely little fern coat. Even crumbling dead trees, and  decaying tree-ferns, did not look dead, because some beautiful moss, or  lichen, or little ferns had clung to them, and made them more beautiful  than when alive.    Dot kept crying out with pleasure at all she saw; especially when little  Parrakeets, with feathers as green as the ferns, and gorgeous red  breasts, came in flocks, and welcomed her to their favourite haunt; and,  as she had eaten the berries of understanding, and was the friend of the  Kangaroo, they were not frightened, but perched on her shoulders and  hands, and chatted their merry talk together. The Kangaroo did not share  Dot's enthusiasm for the beauties of the gully. She said it was pretty,  certainly, but a bad place for kangaroos, because there was no grass.  For her part, she didn't think any sight in nature so lovely as a big  plain, green with the little blades of new spring grass. The gully was  very showy, but not to her mind so beautiful as the other.    Then they came to a stream that gurgled melodiously as it rippled "]]]
