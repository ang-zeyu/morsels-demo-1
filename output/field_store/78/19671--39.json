There is good reason to believe that it was intended to issue the  ultimatum on October 2, a week before its actual date; but there  occurred the unpleasant surprise of finding that neither in food nor  in ammunition were the supplies at hand sufficient to justify an  immediate forward movement. The defect of imperfect transport  organisation, inherent to hastily levied irregular troops, made itself  at once felt. The delay doubtless strengthened both parties, but, as  usual, inured most to the benefit of the one then on the defensive.    The first transports from India began to arrive on Tuesday, October 3,  on which day also the bulk of the Natal volunteers were expected to be  in their places; and in the six intervening days, preceding the  ultimatum, eleven {p.036} more steamers entered Durban with troops  which were at once despatched to the front. General Symons took  command at Dundee, Sir George White of the main body at Ladysmith.    The number of the Boers near at hand, and capable of being brought  against either of the British posts, was variously estimated at the  moment at from 8,000 to 13,000. There can be little doubt, however,  that the latter figure was much more nearly correct; that, in fact, on  October 11, the available force for the invasion rather exceeded than  fell short of the higher figure. Although precise information is still  lacking, there can be no doubt, from the character of the Boer  operations, that rapid subsequent accessions raised their numbers in  Natal to near 30,000 before the middle of November.    It is well here, on the verge of opening hostilities, to recall what  has before been indicated, that the projection of the narrow neck of  Natal, forming an acute salient angle between two hostile borders,  gave especial facilities to the Boers to combine their movements  outside the observation of the enemy, and {p.037} to strike suddenly  either at one of the British detachments, or at the railroad uniting  them. Small bodies began to make their appearance from both quarters  almost immediately after the expiry of the time set by the ultimatum,  and for three or four days the ordinary reports of outpost  observations and shots exchanged were continually received.    The uncertainty consequent upon these divergent demonstrations, some  of which from the Free State seemed to aim at the rear of Ladysmith  itself, was balanced and checked by the knowledge that the principal  Transvaal force had assembled round Zandspruit, in its own territory,  near the railroad, and some fifteen miles beyond Majuba Hill. There  was reason also to believe that the Transvaalers would be found more  enterprising and numerous than the Free State men. It was, therefore,  natural to expect that the main attack would come from the north along  the railroad, and from the east, where the approach from the Transvaal  boundary, which is there marked by the Buffalo River, is over a  country much more practicable than the western mountain range. These  considerations in {p.038} fact appear to have dictated the first  combination of the Boers.    Within a week from the opening of hostilities, the latter had occupied  Newcastle, thirty-seven miles by rail from Glencoe. On the 18th  further demonstrations caused General Symons to withdraw the outpost  stationed at Glencoe to the camp, which was a mile and a half west of  Dundee. The following day, Thursday, he received information, which  proved to be in the main accurate, that a combined movement was in  progress by which his position was to be simultaneously attacked from  the north and from the east. The force in the latter direction was  given at 7,000--probably an excessive estimate; although, as several  commandos had been reported on Wednesday to be moving from the  northern toward the eastern column, it is probable that the latter was  expected to make the chief attack. A British reconnaissance on the  same evening had showed the enemy apparently in force some ten miles  to the northward on the railway; but, if an attack from that quarter  were intended, the Boer combination failed, for none was made.  General {p.039} Joubert, in reporting the results, said, \"Commandant  Lucas Meyer (commanding the eastern force) has had an engagement with  the British at Dundee. Meyer made a plan of campaign by messenger with  Commandant Erasmus, who, however, did not put in an appearance.\"  Convergent attacks, intended to be simultaneous, but starting from  different quarters, are particularly liable to such mishaps.    While these two columns on the 18th were moving on Dundee, a third  force of about 1,000 mounted men, under General Koch, coming from the  north, passed round Glencoe to the westward, crossing the Biggarsberg,  a lofty spur of nearly 6,000 feet, that extends from the western  mountains almost across Natal, with occasional depressions, through  one of which the railroad passes. On Thursday these took possession of  Elandslaagte, a station sixteen miles north of Ladysmith, capturing  one train and nearly intercepting another. Railroad communication in  the rear of Symons was thus intercepted, at the moment that Meyer was  advancing from the east, expecting to fall upon him in conjunction  {p.040} with the northern column. During the night of the 19th Meyer's  force crossed the Buffalo River at Landman's Drift, ten miles east of  Dundee, at 2.30 A.M. drove in the British pickets in that direction,  and at daybreak was seen dotting the hill-ridges, about three miles  east of the camp.    The scene of the approaching action of October 20 is the valley of a  small stream, the general course of which, as nearly as can be judged  from the maps, is north and south. The river-bed, or donga--to use the  conveniently short South African term--is half a mile east of Dundee,  the ground sloping easily toward it; while on the other side the  watershed rises, slowly at first, afterward more rapidly, for a mile  or more, to the ridge occupied by the Boers, which the road to  Landman's crosses at a depression called Smith's Nek. The enemy were  on both sides of the latter when first seen by the British. To the  north of the Nek--to the Boer right--is Talana Hill, where the  decisive fighting occurred, and which had to be carried by direct  assault, lasting, with the intervals of cover, for nearly six hours.  The {p.041} characteristics of the Hill itself, therefore, need to be  understood. As described by an eye-witness, it is about eight hundred  feet high from the level of the donga. The summit presents the flat  table-like sky line, frequently noted in South African travel, of  which Table Mountain, in Cape Town, is the conspicuous example. After  a few hundred yards of gentle acclivity through open ground a wood is  reached, near which is a homestead called Smith's Farm. Half way  between the wood and the top is a stone wall supporting a terrace.  Between the wood and this wall the ground is steep, broken and rocky.  Immediately above the wall the terrace, though easy, is wide and open,  and consequently exposed. The terrace crossed, the remainder of the  ascent is almost perpendicular; a matter therefore of strenuous  climbing under fire.    It appears from this description that the wood and the terrace  afforded a certain amount of cover, as did the donga; that the first  rush from the latter could be made rapidly, with, however,  comparatively little shelter from a long-range fire, while to climb  the wall {p.042} and cross the terrace, though a short process,  involved the utmost exposure. Concerning the last scene of the drama,  the scaling the nearly precipitous fronts which skirted the Boers'  position, the difficulty of the achievement caused the losses of the  assailants there to be heaviest. It may be added that, owing to the  unexpected and rapid developments of the day, most of the British  fought without breakfast or other food.    As soon as the enemy were discovered a company of infantry occupied  the donga, where successive reinforcements were received, and under  cover of which the line prepared for the assault. At 5.30 the Boers  surprised the British by opening with artillery--six guns--at an  estimated distance of 5,400 yards from the British camp. To this three  batteries replied, two of which were soon moved down to the town side  of the donga. The artillery duel, at a range of 2,000 to 3,000 yards,  continued until toward eight o'clock, when the Boers ceased firing,  and General Symons gave the order to prepare for the assault.  Difficult as was the task, and inferior though the assailants were in  number, the conditions were {p.043} such that the weak garrison of  Dundee had no prospect of ultimate escape, unless they could rout the  enemy with which they were engaged before the co-operating body from  the north arrived.    While the action was in its early stages, at 10 A.M., scouts reported  a large force approaching along the railroad. The small detachment  left to guard the British camp moved out to meet and, if possible, to  delay this new enemy. Besides the purely local conditions, it was  essential, in the general plan of campaign, during the waiting period  of inferiority, while their reinforcements were still on the sea, that  the British should risk much to demoralise and daunt an enemy who,  whatever their advantages otherwise, had not that military training  and cohesion which facilitates rapid recovery from a reverse. Whatever  the first mistake of advancing their position so far, it is impossible  to withhold admiration from the rapidity and energy of the measures  taken in the first fortnight of the campaign.    It was a dull, drizzling morning when the line of hungry British  soldiers leaped from the donga {p.044} and rushed for the wood; their  batteries to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2099"],[0,"A History of the Moravian Church (#5)"],[1,"open-air meetings. They rejected purgatory,  masses and the worship of saints. They condemned incense, images, bells,  relics and fasting. They declared that priests were an unnecessary  nuisance. They celebrated the Holy Communion in barns, and baptized  their babies in ponds and brooks. They held that every man had the right  to his own interpretation of the Bible; they despised learning and art;  and they revelled in pulling churches down and burning monks to death.    Next came the Chiliasts, who fondly believed that the end of all things  was at hand, that the millennial reign of Christ would soon begin, and  that all the righteous--that is, they themselves--would have to hold the  world at bay in Five Cities of Refuge. For some years these mad fanatics  regarded themselves as the chosen instruments of the Divine displeasure,  and only awaited a signal from heaven to commence a general massacre  of their fellow men. As that signal never came, however, they were  grievously disappointed.    Next in folly came the Adamites, so called because, in shameless  wise, they dressed like Adam and Eve before the fall. They made their  head-quarters on an island on the River Nesarka, and survived even after  Ziska had destroyed their camp.    But of all the heretical bodies in Bohemia the most influential were the  Waldenses. As the history of the Waldenses is still obscure, we cannot  say for certain what views they held when they first came from Italy  some fifty or sixty years before. At first they seem to have been almost  Catholics, but as the Hussite Wars went on they fell, it is said,  under the influence of the Taborites, and adopted many radical Taborite  opinions. They held that prayer should be addressed, not to the Virgin  Mary and the Saints, but to God alone, and spoke with scorn of the  popular doctrine that the Virgin in heaven showed her breast when  interceding for sinners. As they did not wish to create a disturbance,  they attended the public services of the Church of Rome; but they did  not believe in those services themselves, and are said to have employed  their time at Church in picking holes in the logic of the speaker. They  believed neither in building churches, nor in saying masses, nor in the  adoration of pictures, nor in the singing of hymns at public worship.  For all practical intents and purposes they rejected entirely the  orthodox Catholic distinction between things secular and things sacred,  and held that a man could worship God just as well in a field as in a  church, and that it did not matter in the least whether a man's body  was buried in consecrated or unconsecrated ground. What use, they asked,  were holy water, holy oil, holy palms, roots, crosses, holy splinters  from the Cross of Christ? They rejected the doctrine of purgatory, and  said that all men must go either to heaven or to hell. They rejected  the doctrine of Transubstantiation, and said that the wine and bread  remained wine and bread. For us, however, the chief point of interest  lies in the attitude they adopted towards the priests of the Church of  Rome. At that time there was spread all over Europe a legend that the  Emperor, Constantine the Great, had made a so-called \"Donation\" to  Pope Sylvester; and the Waldenses held that the Church of Rome, by thus  consenting to be endowed by the State, had become morally corrupt, and  no longer possessed the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven. For this reason  they utterly despised the Roman priests; and contended that, being  worldly men of bad character, they were qualified neither to administer  the sacraments nor to hear confessions. At this point we lay our finger  on the principle which led to the foundation of the Moravian Church.  What ideal, we ask, did the Waldenses now set before them? We can answer  the question in a sentence. The whole object the Waldenses had now in  view was to return to the simple teaching of Christ and the Apostles.  They wished to revive what they regarded as true primitive Christianity.  For this reason they brushed aside with scorn the bulls of Popes and the  decrees of Councils, and appealed to the command of the New Testament  Scriptures. For them the law of Christ was supreme and final; and,  appealing to His teaching in the Sermon on the Mount, they declared that  oaths were wicked, and that war was no better than murder. If the law of  Christ were obeyed, said they, what need would there be of government?  How long they had held these views we do not know. Some think they had  held them for centuries; some think they had learned them recently from  the Taborites. If scholars insist on this latter view, we are forced  back on the further question: Where did the Taborites get their  advanced opinions? If the Taborites taught the Waldenses, who taught the  Taborites? We do not know. For the present all we call say is that  the Waldenses in a quiet way were fast becoming a mighty force in the  country. They addressed each other as brother and sister; they are said  to have had their own translations of the Bible; they claimed a descent  from the Apostles; and they are even held by some (though here we tread  on very thin ice) to have possessed their own episcopal succession.    But the method of the Taborites was different. If the Kingdom of God  was to come at all, it must come, they held, by force, by fire, by  the sword, by pillage and by famine. What need to tell here the  blood-curdling story of the Hussite Wars? What need to tell here how  Pope Martin V. summoned the whole Catholic world to a grand crusade  against the Bohemian people? What need to tell how the people of Prague  attacked the Town Hall, and pitched the burgomaster and several aldermen  out of the windows? For twenty years the whole land was one boiling  welter of confusion; and John Ziska, the famous blind general, took the  lead of the Taborite army, and, standing on a wagon, with the banner  above him emblazoned with the Hussite Cup, he swept the country from end  to end like a devouring prairie fire. It is held now by military experts  that Ziska was the greatest military genius of the age. If military  genius could have saved Bohemia, Bohemia would now have been saved. For  some years he managed to hold at bay the finest chivalry of Europe; and  he certainly saved the Hussite cause from being crushed in its birth.  For faith and freedom he fought--the faith of Hus and the freedom of  Bohemia. He formed the rough Bohemian peasantry into a disciplined army.  He armed his men with lances, slings, iron-pointed flails and clubs. He  formed his barricades of iron-clad wagons, and whirled them in murderous  mazes round the field. He made a special study of gunpowder, and taught  his men the art of shooting straight. He has often been compared to  Oliver Cromwell, and like our Oliver he was in many ways. He was stern  in dealing with his enemies, and once had fifty Adamites burned to  death. He was sure that God was on his side in the war. \"Be it known,\"  he wrote to his supporters, \"that we are collecting men from all parts  of the country against these enemies of God and devastators of our  Bohemian land.\" He composed a stirring battle song, and taught his men  to sing it in chorus when they marched to meet the foe.       Therefore, manfully cry out:     \"At them! rush at them.\"     Wield bravely your arms!     Pray to your Lord God.     Strike and kill! spare none!    What a combination of piety and fury! It was all in vain. The great  general died of a fever. The thunderbolt fell. At a meeting in Prague  the Utraquists and Catholics at last came to terms, and drew up a  compromise known as the \"Compactata of Basle\" (1433). For nearly two  hundred years after this these \"Compactata\" were regarded as the law  of the land; and the Utraquist Church was recognised by the Pope as the  national self-governing Church of Bohemia. The terms of the Compactata  were four in number. The Communion was to be given to laymen in both  kinds; all mortal sins were to be punished by the proper authorities;  the Word of God was to be freely preached by faithful priests and  deacons; and no priests were to have any worldly possessions. For  practical purposes this agreement meant the defeat of the advanced  reforming movement. One point the Utraquists had gained, and one alone;  they were allowed to take the wine at the Communion. For the rest these  Utraquist followers of Hus were as Catholic as the Pope himself. They  adored the Host, read the masses, kept the fasts, and said the prayers  as their fathers had done before them. From that moment the fate of the  Taborite party was sealed. At the battle of Lipan they were defeated,  routed, crushed out of existence. {1434}. The battle became a massacre.  The slaughter continued all the night and part of the following day, and  hundreds were burned to death in their huts.    Was this to be the end of Hus's strivings? What was it in Hus that was  destined to survive? What was it that worked like a silent leaven amid  the clamours of war? We shall see. Amid these charred and smoking ruins  the Moravian Church arose.          CHAPTER IV. -- PETER OF CHELCIC, 1419-1450.    Meanwhile a mighty prophet had arisen, with a clear and startling  message. His name was Peter, and he lived down south, in the little  village of Chelcic.[3] As the historian rummages among the ancient  records, he discovers to his sorrow that scarcely anything is known of  the life of this great man; but, on the other hand, it is a joy to  know that while his story is wrapped in mystery, his teaching has been  preserved, and that some of the wonderful books he wrote are treasured  still in his native land as gems of Bohemian literature. In later years  it was commonly said that he began life as a cobbler; but that story,  at least, may be dismissed as a legend. He enlisted, we are told, in  the army. He then discovered that a soldier's life was wicked; he then"]]]
