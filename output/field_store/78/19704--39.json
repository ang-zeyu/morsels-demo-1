Vaulting from their foaming steeds  they tied them to the stockades of the little fortress, which they  entered in a body.    Hot haste was in every motion of these men.  They were trappers, they  said, on their way to the Rocky Mountains to hunt and trade furs.  But  one of their number had been treacherously murdered and scalped by a  Pawnee chief, and they resolved to revenge his death by an attack on one  of the Pawnee villages.  They would teach these \"red reptiles\" to  respect white men, they would, come of it what might; and they had  turned aside here to procure an additional supply of powder and lead.    In vain did the major endeavour to dissuade these reckless men from  their purpose.  They scoffed at the idea of returning good for evil, and  insisted on being supplied.  The log hut was a store as well as a place  of defence, and as they offered to pay for it there was no refusing  their request--at least so the major thought.  The ammunition was  therefore given to them, and in half an hour they were away again at  full gallop over the plains on their mission of vengeance.  \"Vengeance  is Mine, I will repay, saith the Lord.\"  But these men knew not what God  said, because they never read His Word, and did not own His sway.    Young Varley's enthusiasm was considerably damped when he learned the  errand on which the trappers were bent.  From that time forward he gave  up all desire to visit the mountains in company with such men, but he  still retained an intense longing to roam at large among their rocky  fastnesses, and gallop out upon the wide prairies.    Meanwhile he dutifully tended his mother's cattle and sheep, and  contented himself with an occasional deer-hunt in the neighbouring  forests.  He devoted himself also to the training of his dog Crusoe--an  operation which at first cost him many a deep sigh.    Every one has heard of the sagacity and almost reasoning capabilities of  the Newfoundland dog.  Indeed, some have even gone the length of saying  that what is called instinct in these animals is neither more nor less  than reason.  And, in truth, many of the noble, heroic, and sagacious  deeds that have actually been performed by Newfoundland dogs incline us  almost to believe that, like man, they are gifted with reasoning powers.    But every one does not know the trouble and patience that is required in  order to get a juvenile dog to understand what its master means when he  is endeavouring to instruct it.    Crusoe's first lesson was an interesting, but not a very successful one.  We may remark here that Dick Varley had presented Fan to his mother to  be her watch-dog, resolving to devote all his powers to the training of  the pup.  We may also remark, in reference to Crusoe's appearance (and  we did not remark it sooner, chiefly because up to this period in his  eventful history he was little better than a ball of fat and hair), that  his coat was mingled jet-black and pure white, and remarkably glossy,  curly, and thick.    A week after the shooting match Crusoe's education began.  Having fed  him for that period with his own hand, in order to gain his affection,  Dick took him out one sunny forenoon to the margin of the lake to give  him his first lesson.    And here again we must pause to remark that, although a dog's heart is  generally gained in the first instance through his mouth, yet, after it  is thoroughly gained, his affection is noble and disinterested.  He can  scarcely be driven from his master's side by blows, and even when thus  harshly repelled is always ready, on the shortest notice and with the  slightest encouragement, to make it up again.    Well, Dick Varley began by calling out, \"Crusoe!  Crusoe! come here,  pup.\"    Of course Crusoe knew his name by this time, for it had been so often  used as a prelude to his meals, that he naturally expected a feed  whenever he heard it.  This portal to his brain had already been open  for some days; but all the other doors were fast locked, and it required  a great deal of careful picking to open them.    \"Now, Crusoe, come here.\"    Crusoe bounded clumsily to his master's side, cocked his ears, and  wagged his tail--so far his education was perfect.  We say he bounded  _clumsily_, for it must be remembered that he was still a very young  pup, with soft, flabby muscles.    \"Now, I'm goin' to begin yer edication, pup; think o' that.\"    Whether Crusoe thought of that or not we cannot say, but he looked up in  his master's face as he spoke, cocked his ears very high, and turned his  head slowly to one side, until it could not turn any further in that  direction; then he turned it as much to the other side, whereat his  master burst into an uncontrollable fit of laughter, and Crusoe  immediately began barking vociferously.    \"Come, come,\" said Dick, suddenly checking his mirth, \"we mustn't play,  pup, we must work.\"    Drawing a leathern mitten from his belt, the youth held it to Crusoe's  nose, and then threw it a yard away, at the same time exclaiming in a  loud, distinct tone, \"_Fetch it_.\"    Crusoe entered at once into the spirit of this part of his training; he  dashed gleefully at the mitten, and proceeded to worry it with intense  gratification.  As for \"_Fetch it_,\" he neither understood the words nor  cared a straw about them.    Dick Varley rose immediately, and rescuing the mitten, resumed his seat  on a rock.    \"Come here, Crusoe,\" he repeated.    \"Oh! certainly, by all means,\" said Crusoe--no! he didn't exactly _say_  it, but really he _looked_ these words so evidently, that we think it  right to let them stand as they are written.  If he could have finished  the sentence he would certainly have said, \"Go on with that game over  again, old boy; it's quite to my taste--the jolliest thing in life, I  assure you!\"  At least, if we may not positively assert that he would  have said that, no one else can absolutely affirm that he wouldn't.    Well, Dick Varley did do it over again, and Crusoe worried the mitten  over again--utterly regardless of \"_Fetch it_.\"    Then they did it again, and again, and again, but without the slightest  apparent advancement in the path of canine knowledge,--and then they  went home.    During all this trying operation Dick Varley never once betrayed the  slightest feeling of irritability or impatience.  He did not expect  success at first; he was not, therefore, disappointed at failure.    Next day he had him out again--and the next--and the next--and the next  again, with the like unfavourable result.  In short, it seemed at last  as if Crusoe's mind had been deeply imbued with the idea that he had  been born expressly for the purpose of worrying that mitten, and he  meant to fulfil his destiny to the letter.    Young Varley had taken several small pieces of meat in his pocket each  day, with the intention of rewarding Crusoe when he should at length be  prevailed on to fetch the mitten, but as Crusoe was not aware of the  treat that awaited him, of course the mitten never was \"fetched.\"    At last Dick Varley saw that this system would never do, so he changed  his tactics, and the next morning gave Crusoe no breakfast, but took him  out at the usual hour to go through his lesson.  This new course of  conduct seemed to perplex Crusoe not a little, for on his way down to  the beach he paused frequently and looked back at the cottage, and then  expressively up at his master's face.  But the master was inexorable; he  went on and Crusoe followed, for _true_ love had now taken possession of  the pup's young heart, and he preferred his master's company to food.    Varley now began by letting the learner smell a piece of meat which he  eagerly sought to devour, but was prevented, to his immense disgust.  Then the mitten was thrown as heretofore, and Crusoe made a few steps  towards it, but being in no mood for play he turned back.    \"_Fetch it_,\" said the teacher.    \"I won't,\" replied the learner mutely, by means of that expressive  sign--_not doing it_.    Hereupon Dick Varley rose, took up the mitten, and put it into the pup's  mouth.  Then, retiring a couple of yards, he held out the piece of meat  and said, \"_Fetch it_.\"    Crusoe instantly spat out the glove and bounded towards the meat--once  more to be disappointed.    This was done a second time, and Crusoe came forward _with the mitten in  his mouth_.  It seemed as if it had been done accidentally, for he  dropped it before coming quite up.  If so it was a fortunate accident,  for it served as the tiny fulcrum on which to place the point of that  mighty lever which was destined ere long to raise him to the pinnacle of  canine erudition.  Dick Varley immediately lavished upon him the  tenderest caresses and gave him a lump of meat.  But he quickly tried it  again lest he should lose the lesson.  The dog evidently felt that if he  did not fetch that mitten he should have no meat or caresses.  In order,  however, to make sure that there was no mistake, Dick laid the mitten  down beside the pup, instead of putting it into his mouth, and, retiring  a few paces, cried, \"_Fetch it_.\"    Crusoe looked uncertain for a moment, then he _picked up_ the mitten and  laid it at his master's feet.  The lesson was learned at last!  Dick  Varley tumbled all the meat out of his pocket on the ground, and, while  Crusoe made a hearty breakfast, he sat down on a rock and whistled with  glee at having fairly picked the lock, and opened _another_ door into  one of the many chambers of his dog's intellect!        CHAPTER FOUR.    OUR HERO ENLARGED UPON--GRUMPS.    Two years passed away--the Mustang Valley settlement advanced  prosperously, despite one or two attacks made upon it by the savages,  who were, however, firmly repelled; Dick Varley had now become a man,  and his pup Crusoe had become a full-grown dog.  The \"silver rifle,\" as  Dick's weapon had come "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21736"],[0,"The Gorilla Hunters (#5)"],[1,"owl if you can.  I have just replenished both the fires, so  you can lean your back against that palm-tree and take it easy for  three-quarters of an hour or so.  After that you'll have to heap on more  wood.\"    I looked at Jack, who was now lying quite unconscious, breathing with  the slow, deep regularity of profound slumber, and with his mouth wide  open.    \"What a chance for some waggish baboon to drop a nut or a berry in!\"  said Peterkin, winking at me with one eye as he lay down in the spot  from which I had just risen.    He was very sleepy, poor fellow, and could hardly smile at his own  absurd fancy.  He was asleep almost instantly.  In fact, I do not  believe that he again opened the eye with which he had winked at me, but  that he merely shut the other and began to slumber forthwith.    I now began to feel quite interested in my responsible position as  guardian of the camp.  I examined my rifle to see that it was in order  and capped; then leaning against the palm-tree, which was, as it were,  my sentry-box, I stood erect and rubbed my hands and took off my cap, so  that the pleasant night air might play about my temples, and more  effectually banish drowsiness.    In order to accomplish this more thoroughly I walked round both fires  and readjusted the logs, sending up showers of sparks as I did so.  Then  I went to the edge of the circle of light, in the centre of which our  camp lay, and peered into the gloom of the dark forest.    There was something inexpressibly delightful yet solemn in my feelings  as I gazed into that profound obscurity where the great tree-stems and  the wild gigantic foliage nearest to me appeared ghost-like and  indistinct, and the deep solitudes of which were peopled, not only with  the strange fantastic forms of my excited fancy, but, as I knew full  well, with real wild creatures, both huge and small, such as my  imagination at that time had not fully conceived.  I felt awed, almost  oppressed, with the deep silence around, and, I must confess, looked  somewhat nervously over my shoulder as I returned to the fire and sat  down to keep watch at my post.        CHAPTER THREE.    WHEREIN I MOUNT GUARD, AND HOW I DID IT, ETCETERA.    Now it so happened that the battle which I had to fight with myself  after taking my post was precisely the converse of that which I fought  during the earlier part of that night.  Then, it was a battle with  wakefulness; now, it was a struggle with sleep; and of the two fights  the latter was the more severe by far.    I began by laying down my rifle close by my side, leaning back in a  sitting posture against the palm-tree, and resigning myself to the  contemplation of the fire, which burned merrily before me, while I  pondered with myself how I should best employ my thoughts during the  three long hours of my watch.  But I had not dwelt on that subject more  than three minutes, when I was rudely startled by my own head falling  suddenly and heavily forward on my chest.  I immediately roused myself.  \"Ah!  Ralph, Ralph,\" said I to myself in a whisper, \"this won't do, lad.  To sleep at your post! shame on you!  Had you been a sentinel in time  of war that nod would have cost you your life, supposing you to have  been caught in the act.\"    Soliloquising thus, I arose and shook myself.  Then I slapped my chest  several times and pulled my nose and sat down again.  Only a few minutes  elapsed before the same thing occurred to me again, so I leaped up, and  mended the fires, and walked to and fro, until I felt thoroughly awake,  but in order to make sure that it should not occur again, I walked to  the edge of the circle of light and gazed for some time into the dark  forest, as I had done before.  While standing thus I felt my knees give  way, as if they had been suddenly paralysed, and I awoke just in time to  prevent myself falling to the ground.  I must confess I was much amazed  at this, for although I had often read of soldiers falling asleep  standing at their posts, I had never believed the thing possible.    I now became rather anxious, \"for,\" thought I, \"if I go to sleep and the  fires die down, who knows but wild beasts may come upon us and kill us  before we can seize our arms.\"  For a moment or two I meditated awaking  Jack and begging him to keep me company, but when I reflected that his  watch was to come immediately after mine, I had not the heart to do it.  \"No!\" said I (and I said it aloud for the purpose of preventing  drowsiness)--\"no; I will fight this battle alone!  I will repeat some  stanzas from my favourite authors.  Yes, I will try to remember a  portion of `A Midsummer-Night's Dream.'  It will be somewhat appropriate  to my present circumstances.\"    Big with this resolve, I sat down with my face to the fire and my back  to the palm-tree, and--fell sound asleep instantly!    How long I lay in this condition I know not, but I was suddenly awakened  by a yell so appalling that my heart leaped as if into my throat, and my  nerves thrilled with horror.  For one instant I was paralysed; then my  blood seemed to rebound on its course.  I sprang up and attempted to  seize my rifle.    The reader may judge of my state of mind when I observed that it was  gone!  I leaped towards the fire, and grasping a lighted brand, turned  round and glared into the woods in the direction whence the yell came.    It was grey dawn, and I could see things pretty distinctly; but the only  living object that met my gaze was Peterkin, who stood with my rifle in  his hand laughing heartily!    I immediately turned to look at Jack, who was sitting up in the spot  where he had passed the night, with a sleepy smile on his countenance.    \"Why, what's the meaning of this?\"  I inquired.    \"The meaning of it?\" cried Peterkin, as he advanced and restored the  rifle to its place.  \"A pretty fellow you are to mount guard! we might  have been all murdered in our sleep by niggers or eaten alive by  gorillas, for all that you would have done to save us.\"    \"But, Peterkin,\" said I gravely, \"you ought not to have startled me so;  you gave me a terrible fright.  People have been driven mad before now,  I assure you, by practical jokes.\"    \"My dear fellow,\" cried Peterkin, with much earnestness, \"I know that as  well as you.  But, in the first place, you were guilty of so heinous a  crime that I determined to punish you, and at the same time to do it in  a way that would impress it forcibly on your memory; and in the second  place, I would not have done it at all had I not known that your nerves  are as strong as those of a dray-horse.  You ought to be taking shame to  yourself on account of your fault rather than objecting to your  punishment.\"    \"Peterkin is right, my boy,\" said Jack, laughing, \"though I must say he  had need be sure of the nerves of any one to whom he intends to  administer such a ferocious yell as that.  Anyhow, I have no reason to  complain; for you have given me a good long sleep, although I can't say  exactly that you have taken my watch.  It will be broad daylight in half  an hour, so we must be stirring, comrades.\"    On considering the subject I admitted the force of these remarks, and  felt somewhat crestfallen.  No doubt, my companions had treated the  thing jocularly, and, to say truth, there was much that was comical in  the whole affair; but the more I thought of it, the more I came to  perceive how terrible might have been the consequences of my  unfaithfulness as a sentinel.  I laid the lesson to heart, and I can  truly say that from that day to this I have never again been guilty of  the crime of sleeping at my post.    We now busied ourselves in collecting together the dying embers of our  fire and in preparing breakfast, which consisted of tea, hard biscuit,  and cold monkey.  None of us liked the monkey; not that its flesh was  bad--quite the contrary--but it looked so like a small roasted baby that  we could not relish it at all.  However, it was all we had; for we had  set off on this hunting excursion intending to live by our rifles, but  had been unfortunate, having seen nothing except a monkey or two.    The kettle was soon boiled, and we sat down to our meagre fare with  hearty appetites.  While we are thus engaged, I shall turn aside for a  little and tell the reader, in one or two brief sentences, how we got to  this place.    We shipped in a merchant ship at Liverpool, and sailed for the west  coast of Africa.  Arrived there we found a party, under the command of a  Portuguese trader, about to set off to the interior.  He could speak a  little English; so we arranged to go with him as far as he intended to  proceed, learn as much of the native language as possible while in his  company, and then obtain a native guide to conduct us to the country in  which the gorillas are found.  To this native guide, we arranged, should  be explained by the trader our object in visiting the country, so that  he might tell the tribes whom we intended to visit.  This, we found, was  an absolutely needful precaution, on the following ground.    The natives of Africa have a singular and very bad style of carrying on  trade with the white men who visit their shores.  The traffic consists  chiefly of ivory, barwood (a wood much used in dyeing), and indiarubber.  The natives of the far interior are not allowed to convey these  commodities directly to the coast, but by the law of the land (which  means the law of the strongest, for they are absolute savages) are  obliged to deliver their goods to the care of the tribe next to them;  these pass them on to the next tribe; and so on they go from tribe to  tribe till they reach the coast, where they are sold by the tribe there.  The price obtained, which usually consists of guns, powder and shot,  looking-glasses, cloth, and sundry other articles and trinkets useful to  men in a savage state, is returned to the owners in the far interior  through the same channel; but as each"]]]
