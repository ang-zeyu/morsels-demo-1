Although filled with  admiration, Lawrence was by no means surprised, for he knew well that in  the Pampas, or plains, to which region her father belonged, the Indians  are celebrated for their splendid horsemanship.  Indeed, their little  children almost live on horseback, commencing their training long before  they can mount, and overcoming the difficulty of smallness in early  youth, by climbing to the backs of their steeds by means of a fore-leg,  and not unfrequently by the tail.    The costume of the girl was well suited to her present mode of life,  being a sort of light tunic reaching a little below the knees, with  loose leggings, which were richly ornamented with needlework.  A straw  hat with a simple feather, covered her head, beneath which her curling  black hair flowed in unconfined luxuriance.  She wore no ornament of any  kind, and the slight shoes that covered her small feet were perfectly  plain.  In short, there was a modest simplicity about the girl's whole  aspect and demeanour which greatly interested the Englishman, inducing  him to murmur to himself, \"What an uncommonly pretty girl she would be  if she were only white!\"    The colour of her skin was, indeed, unusually dark, but that fact did  not interfere with the classic delicacy of her features, or the natural  sweetness of her expression.    The order of progress in narrow places was such that Manuela rode behind  Pedro and in front of Lawrence, Quashy bringing up the rear.  In more  open places the young Englishman used occasionally to ride up abreast of  Manuela and endeavour to engage her in conversation.  He was, to say  truth, very much the reverse of what is styled a lady's man, and had all  his life felt rather shy and awkward in female society, but being a  sociable, kindly fellow, he felt it incumbent on him to do what in him  lay to lighten the tedium of the long journey to one who, he thought,  must naturally feel very lonely with no companions but men.  \"Besides,\"  he whispered to himself, \"she is only an Indian, and of course cannot  construe my attentions to mean anything so ridiculous as love-making--  so, I will speak to her in a fatherly sort of way.\"    Filled with this idea, as the party came out upon a wide and beautiful  table-land, which seemed like a giant emerald set in a circlet of grand  blue mountains, Lawrence pushed up alongside, and said--    \"Poor girl, I fear that such prolonged riding over these rugged passes  must fatigue you.\"  Manuela raised her dark eyes to the youth's face,  and, with a smile that was very slight--though not so slight but that it  revealed a double row of bright little teeth--she replied softly--    \"W'at you say?\"    \"Oh!  I forgot, you don't speak English.  How stupid I am!\" said  Lawrence with a blush, for he was too young to act the \"fatherly\" part  well.    He felt exceedingly awkward, but, observing that the girl's eyes were  again fixed pensively on the ground, he hoped that she had not noticed  the blush, and attempted to repeat the phrase in Spanish.  What he said  it is not possible to set down in that tongue, nor can we gratify the  reader with a translation.  Whatever it was, Manuela replied by again  raising her dark eyes for a moment--this time without a smile--and  shaking her head.    Poor Lawrence felt more awkward than ever.  In despair he half thought  of making trial of Latin or Greek, when Pedro came opportunely to the  rescue.  Looking back he began--    \"Senhor Armstrong--\"    \"I think,\" interrupted the youth, \"that you may dispense with `Senhor.'\"    \"Nay, I like to use it,\" returned the guide.  \"It reminds me so forcibly  of the time when I addressed your good old father thus.\"    \"Well, Senhor Pedro, call me what you please.  What were you about to  say?\"    \"Only that we are now approaching one of the dangerous passes of the  mountains, where baggage-mules sometimes touch the cliffs with their  packs, and so get tilted over the precipices.  But our mules are quiet,  and with ordinary care we have nothing to fear.\"    The gorge in the mountains, which the travellers soon afterwards  entered, fully justified the guide's expression \"dangerous.\"  It was a  wild, rugged glen, high up on one side of which the narrow pathway  wound--in some places rounding a cliff or projecting boulder, which  rendered the passage of the baggage-mules extremely difficult.  Indeed,  one of the mules did slightly graze a rock with its burden; and,  although naturally sure-footed, was so far thrown off its balance as to  be within a hair's-breadth of tumbling over the edge and being dashed to  pieces on the rocks below, where a turbulent river rushed tumultuously  at the bottom of the glen.    One of the snow-clad peaks of the higher Andes lay right before them.  One or two guanacos--animals of the lama species--gazed at them from the  other side of the gorge, and several ill-omened vultures wheeled in the  sky above, as if anticipating a catastrophe which would furnish them  with a glorious meal.    \"A most suitable place for the depredations of banditti, or fellows like  Conrad of the Mountains, I should think,\" said Lawrence.    \"Bandits are sometimes met with here,\" returned Pedro, quietly.    \"And what if we should meet with such in a place where there is scarcely  room to fight?\"    \"Why then,\" returned the guide, with a slight curl of his moustache, \"we  should have to try who could fight best in the smallest space.\"    \"Not a pleasant prospect in the circumstances,\" said Lawrence, thinking  of Manuela.    For some time they rode together in silence; but Quashy, who had  overheard, the conversation, and was of a remarkably combative  disposition, though the reverse of bad-tempered or quarrelsome, could  not refrain from asking--    \"W'y de Guv'mint not hab lots ob sojers an' pleece in de mountains to  squash de raskils?\"    \"Because Government has enough to do to squash the rascals nearer home,  Quashy,\" answered Pedro.  \"Have a care, the track gets rather steep  here.\"    He glanced over his shoulder at the Indian girl as he spoke.  She was  riding behind with an air of perfect ease and self-possession.    \"Fall to the rear, Quashy,\" said Pedro.    The black obeyed at once, and a minute later they turned the corner of a  jutting rock, which had hitherto shut out from view the lower part of  the gorge and the track they were following.    The sight that met their view was calculated to try the strongest  nerves, for there, not a hundred paces in advance, and coming towards  them, were ten of the most villainous-looking cut-throats that could be  imagined, all mounted, and heavily armed with carbine, sword, and  pistol.    Taken completely by surprise, the bandits--for such Pedro knew them to  be--pulled up.  Not so our guide.  It was one of the peculiarities and  strong points of Pedro's character that he was never taken by surprise,  or uncertain what to do.    Instantly he drew his sword with one hand, a pistol with the other, and,  driving his spurs deep into his mule, dashed down the steep road at the  banditti.  In the very act he looked back, and, in a voice that caused  the echoes of the gorge to ring, shouted in Spanish--    \"Come on, comrades! here they are at last! close up!\"    A yell of the most fiendish excitement and surprise from Quashy--who was  only just coming into view--assisted the deception.  If anything was  wanting to complete the effect, it was the galvanic upheaval of  Lawrence's long arms and the tremendous flourish of his longer legs, as  he vaulted over his mule's head, left it scornfully behind, uttered a  roar worthy of an African lion, and rushed forward on foot.  He grasped  his great cudgel, for sword and pistol had been utterly forgotten!    Like a human avalanche they descended on the foe.  That foe did not  await the onset.  Panic-stricken they turned and went helter-skelter  down the pass--all except two, who seemed made of sterner stuff than  their fellows, and hesitated.    One of these Pedro rode fairly down, and sent, horse and all, over the  precipice.  Lawrence's cudgel beat down the guard of the other,  flattened his sombrero, and stopping only at his skull, stretched him on  the ground.  As for those who had fled, the appalling yells of Quashy,  as he pursued them, scattered to the winds any fag-ends of courage they  might have possessed, and effectually prevented their return.  So  tremendous and sudden was the result, that Manuela felt more inclined to  laugh than cry, though naturally a good deal frightened.    Lawrence and Pedro were standing in consultation over the fallen bandit  when the negro came back panting from the chase.    \"Da's wan good job dooed, anyhow,\" he said.  \"What's you be do wid  _him_?\"    \"What would you recommend?\" asked Pedro.    The negro pointed significantly to the precipice, but the guide shook  his head.    \"No, I cannot kill in cold blood, though I have no doubt he richly  deserves it.  We'll bind his hands and leave him.  It may be weakness on  my part, but we can't take him on, you know.\"    While Pedro was in the act of binding the robber, a wild shriek, as of  some one in terrible agony, startled them.  Looking cautiously over the  precipice, where the sound seemed to come from, they saw that the man  whom Pedro had ridden down was hanging over the abyss by the boughs of a  small shrub.  His steed lay mangled on the rocks of the river bank at  the bottom.  There was an agonised expression in the man's countenance  which would have touched a heart much less soft than that of Lawrence  Armstrong.  Evidently the man's power of holding on was nearly  exhausted, and he could not repress a shriek at the prospect of the  terrible death which seemed so imminent.    Being a practised mountaineer, Lawrence at once, without thought of  personal danger, and moved only by pity, slipped over the crags, and,  descending on one or two"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21717"],[0,"Battles with the Sea (#5)"],[1,"ce.  They had seen the flashing of the rockets and faintly  heard the thunder of the alarm-guns fired by the lightships.  They had  seen the lights of the steamer while she searched in vain for them on  first reaching the sands, had observed the smaller light of the boat in  tow, whose crew would have been so glad to save them, and had shouted in  vain to them as they passed by on their errand of mercy to other parts  of the sands, leaving them a prey to darkness and despair.  But a  merciful and loving God had seen and heard them all the time, and now  sent them aid at the eleventh hour.    When the lifeboat at last made in towards them the ebb tide was running  strongly, and, from the position of the wreck, it was impossible to  anchor to windward and drop down to leeward in the usual fashion.  They  had, therefore, to adopt the dangerous plan of running with the wind,  right in upon the fore-rigging, and risk being smashed by the mast,  which was beating about with its living load like an eccentric  battering-ram.  But these Ramsgate men would stick at nothing.  They  rushed in and received many severe blows, besides dashing into the iron  windlass of the wreck.  Slowly, and one by one, the enfeebled men  dropped from the mast into the boat.  Sixteen--all saved!  There was  great shaking of hands, despite the tossings of the hungry surf, and  many fervid expressions of thankfulness, as the sail was hoisted and the  men of the Demerara were carried away to join the other rescued ones,  who by that time thronged the little Aid almost to overflowing.    At Ramsgate that morning--the morning of the 4th--it was soon known to  the loungers on the pier that the lifeboat was out, had been out all  night, and might be expected back soon.  Bright and clear, though cold,  was the morn which succeeded that terrible night; and many hundreds of  anxious, beating, hopeful hearts were on the lookout.  At last the  steamer and her warrior-boat appeared, and a feeling of great gladness  seemed to spread through the crowd when it was observed that a flag was  flying at the mast-head, a well-known sign of victory.    On they came, right gallantly over the still turbulent waves.  As they  passed the pier-heads, and the crowd of pale faces were seen gazing  upwards in smiling acknowledgment of the hearty welcome, there burst  forth a deep-toned thrilling cheer, which increased in enthusiasm as the  extent of the victory was realised, and culminated when it became known  that at one grand swoop the lifeboat, after a fight of sixteen hours,  had rescued a hundred and twenty souls from the grasp of the raging sea!    Reader, there was many a heart-stirring incident enacted that night  which I have not told you, and much more might be related of that great  battle and glorious victory.  But enough, surely, has been told to give  you some idea of what our coast heroes dare and do in their efforts to  rescue the perishing.        CHAPTER THREE.    LIGHT AND SHADE IN LIFEBOAT WORK.    But victory does not always crown the efforts of our lifeboats.  Sometimes we have to tell of partial failure or defeat, and it is due to  the lifeboat cause to show that our coast heroes are to the full as  daring, self-sacrificing, and noble, in the time of disaster as they are  in the day of victory.    A splendid instance of persevering effort in the face of absolutely  insurmountable difficulty was afforded by the action of the Constance  lifeboat, belonging to Tynemouth, on the night of the 24th November,  1864.    On that night the coast of Northumberland was visited by one of the  severest gales that had been experienced for many years, and a  tremendous sea was dashing and roaring among the rocks at the mouth of  the Tyne.  Many ships had sought refuge in the harbour during the day,  but, as the shades of evening began to descend, the risk of attempting  an entrance became very great.  At last, as the night was closing in,  the schooner Friendship ran on the rocks named the Black Middens.    Shortly afterwards a large steamer, the Stanley, of Aberdeen, with  thirty passengers (most of whom were women), thirty of a crew, a cargo  of merchandise, and a deckload of cattle, attempted to take the river.  On approaching she sent up rockets for a pilot, but none dared venture  out to her.  The danger of putting out again to sea was too great.  The  captain therefore resolved to attempt the passage himself.  He did so.  Three heavy seas struck the steamer so severely as to divert her from  her course, and she ran on the rocks close to the Friendship, so close  that the cries of her crew could be heard above the whistling winds and  thundering waves.  As soon as she struck, the indescribable  circumstances of a dread disaster began.  The huge billows that had  hitherto passed onward, heaving her upwards, now burst over her with  inconceivable violence and crushed her down, sweeping the decks  continuously--they rocked her fiercely to and fro; they ground her sides  upon the cruel rocks; they lifted her on their powerful crests, let her  fall bodily on the rocks, stove in her bottom, and, rushing into the  hold, extinguished the engine fires.  The sound of her rending planks  and timbers was mingled with the piercing cries of the female passengers  and the gruff shouting of the men, as they staggered to and fro, vainly  attempting to do something, they knew not what, to avert their doom.    It was pitch dark by this time, yet not so dark but that the sharp eyes  of earnest daring men on shore had noted the catastrophe.  The men of  the coastguard, under Mr Lawrence Byrne, their chief officer, got out  the rocket apparatus and succeeded in sending a line over the wreck.  Unfortunately, however, owing to mismanagement of those on board the  steamer, it proved ineffective.  They had fastened the hawser of the  apparatus to the forecastle instead of high up on the mast, so that the  ropes became hopelessly entangled on the rocks.  Before this  entanglement occurred, however, two men had been hauled ashore to show  the possibility of escape and to give the ladies courage.  Then a lady  ventured into the sling-lifebuoy, or cradle, with a sailor, but they  stuck fast during the transit, and while being hauled back to the wreck,  fell out and were drowned.  A fireman then made the attempt.  Again the  cradle stuck, but the man was strong and went hand over hand along the  hawser to the shore, where Mr Byrne rushed into the surf and caught  hold of him.  The rescuer nearly lost his life in the attempt.  He was  overtaken by a huge wave, and was on the point of being washed away when  he caught hold of a gentleman who ran into the surf to save him.    The rocket apparatus having thus failed, owing to the simple mistake of  those in the wreck having fastened the hawser _too low_ on their vessel,  the crew attempted to lower a boat with four seamen and four ladies in  it.  One of the davits gave way, the other swung round, and the boat was  swamped.  Three of the men were hauled back into the steamer, but the  others perished.  The men would not now launch the other boats.  Indeed  it would have been useless, for no ordinary boat could have lived in  such a sea.  Soon afterwards all the boats were washed away and  destroyed, and the destruction of the steamer itself seemed about to  take place every moment.    While this terrible fight for dear life was going on, the lifeboat-men  were not idle.  They ran out their good boat, the Constance, and  launched her.  And what a fearful launching that was!  This boat  belonged to the Institution, and her crew were justly proud of her.    According to the account given by her gallant coxswain, James Gilbert,  they could see nothing whatever at the time of starting but the white  flash of the seas as they passed over boat and crew, without  intermission, twelve or thirteen times.  Yet, as quickly as the boat was  filled, she emptied herself through her discharging-tubes.  Of these  tubes I shall treat hereafter.  Gilbert could not even see his own men,  except the second coxswain, who, I presume, was close to him.  Sometimes  the boat was \"driven to an angle of forty or forty-five degrees in  clearing the rocks.\"  When they were in a position to make for the  steamer, the order was given to \"back all oars and keep her end-on to  the sea.\"  The men obeyed; they seemed to be inspired with fresh vigour  as they neared the wreck.  Let Gilbert himself tell the rest of the  story as follows.    \"When abreast of the port bow, two men told us they had a rope ready on  the starboard bow.  We said we would be there in a moment.  I then  ordered the bow-man to be ready to receive the rope.  As soon as we were  ready we made two dashing strokes, and were under the bowsprit,  expecting to receive the rope, when we heard a dreadful noise, and the  next instant the sea fell over the bows of the Stanley, and buried the  lifeboat.  Every oar was broken at the gunwale of the boat, and the  outer ends were swept away.  The men made a grasp for the spare oars.  Three were gone; two only remained.  We were then left with the rudder  and two oars.  The next sea struck the boat almost over end on board the  Friendship, the boat at the time being nearly perpendicular.  We then  had the misfortune to lose four of our crew.  As the boat made a most  fearful crash, and fell alongside the vessel, James Grant was, I  believe, killed on the spot, betwixt the ship and the boat; Edmund  Robson and James Blackburn were thrown out, Joseph Bell jumped as the  boat fell.  My own impression is that the men all jumped from the boat  on to the vessel.  We saw them no more.  There were four men standing in  a group before the mainmast of the schooner.  We implored them to come  into the boat, but no one answered.\"    Little wonder at that, James Gilbert!  The massive wreck must have  seemed--at least to men who did not know the qualities of a lifeboat--a  surer"]]]
