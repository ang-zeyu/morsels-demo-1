They  made him a great number of flattering speeches, and he gravely listened  to their compliments, but as to the reasons they gave for breaking their  promises in the past he dealt very frankly with them. He reminded them  of their treacheries, and cruelties of all kinds, and of their failure  to restore their captives after they had pledged themselves to do so,  and he said, \"This army shall not leave your country till you have fully  complied with every condition that is to precede my treaty with you....  I give you twelve days from this date to deliver into my hands all  the prisoners in your possession, without any exception; Englishmen,  Frenchmen, women and children, whether adopted into your tribes, married  or living amongst you under any pretense whatsoever, together with  all negroes. And you are to furnish the said prisoners with clothing,  provisions, and horses, to carry them to Fort Pitt.... You shall then  know on what terms you may obtain the peace you sue for.\"    [Illustration: Indians delivering up captives 041]    These words are said to have quite broken the spirit of the savages,  already overawed by the presence of such an army as they had never seen  in their country before. One of the great chiefs of the Delawares said:  \"With this string of wampum we wipe the tears from your eyes, we deliver  you these prisoners... we gather and bury with this belt all the bones  of the people that have been killed during this unhappy war, which  the Evil Spirit occasioned among us. We cover the bones that have been  buried, that they may never more be remembered. We again cover their  place with leaves that it may no more be seen. As we have been long  astray, and the path between you and us stopped, we extend this belt  that it may be again cleared.... While you hold it fast by one end, and  we by the other, we shall always be able to discover anything that may  disturb our friendship.\"    Bouquet answered that he had heard them with pleasure, and that in  receiving these last prisoners from them he joined with them in burying  the bones of those who had fallen in the war, so that the place might no  more be known. \"The peace you ask for, you shall now have,\" he said, but  he told them that it was his business to make war, and the business of  others to make peace, and he instructed them how and with whom they were  to treat. He took hostages from them, and he dealt with the other tribes  on the same terms as they brought in their captives. On the 18th of  November, he broke up his camp and marched back to Fort Pitt, with more  than two hundred men, women, and children whom he had delivered from  captivity among the savages.    It is believed that six hundred others were never given up. The captives  were not always glad to go back to their old homes, and the Indians had  sometimes to use force in bringing them to the camp where their friends  and kindred who had come with Bouquet's army were waiting to receive  them. Many had been taken from their homes when they were so young that  they could not remember them, and they had learned to love the Indians,  who had brought them up like their own children, and treated them as  lovingly as the fathers and mothers from whom they had been stolen. In  the charm of the savage life these children of white parents had really  become savages; and certain of the young girls had grown up and married  Indian husbands to whom they were tenderly attached. The scenes of  parting between all these were very touching on both sides, and it is  told of one Indian who had married a Virginian girl that he followed  her back to the frontier at the risk of his life from her people. The  Indians gave up the captives often so dear to them, with tears and  lamentations, while on the other hand their kindred waited to receive  them in an anguish of hope and fear. As the captives came into the  camp, parents sought among them for the little ones they had lost, and  husbands for the wives who had been snatched from their desolated homes.  Brothers and sisters met after a parting so long that one or other had  forgotten the language they once spoke in common. The Indians still hung  about the camp, and came every day to visit their former prisoners and  bring them gifts. When the army took up its march some of them asked  leave to follow it back to Fort Pitt, and on the way they supplied their  adopted children and brothers with game, and sought in every way to show  their love for them.    Bouquet reached Pittsburg in ten days, without the loss of a single life  at the hands of the savages, and with all his men in excellent health.  Each day of his march he had pitched his camp among scenes of sylvan  loveliness, on the banks of the pleasant streams that watered the  fertile levels and the wild meadows, or wound through the rich valleys  between the low hills. It would have been wonderful if his Pennsylvanian  and Virginian recruits had not looked upon the land with covetous eyes:  even the fathers and husbands and brothers who had come seeking their  kindred among the Indians, had seen it with a longing to plant their  homes in it. Its charms had been revealed to great numbers of the people  who had known of it only from the traders before, and the savage was  doomed from that time to lose it; for it already belonged to the king of  England, and it rested with the English colonists to come and take it;  or so, at least, they thought.          IV. THE FORTY YEARS' WAR FOR THE WEST.    The French king gave up the West to the English king in 1763, but, as we  have seen, the Indians had no part in the bargain. They only knew that  they were handed over by those who had been their friends to those who  had been their enemies, and they did not consent. They had made war  upon the English colonists before, and now, in spite of the failure of  Pontiac, and in spite of Bouquet's march into the Ohio country,  they kept up their warfare for forty years, with a truce when it was  convenient, and a treaty of peace when it was convenient, but with a  steadfast purpose to drive the English settlers out, and to hold the  wilderness for themselves. It was not until long after their power was  broken by the American arms in 1794 that their struggle ended in the  region which ten years later became the state of Ohio.    There was misunderstanding on both sides. The Indians naturally supposed  that their own country belonged to them, and the colonists supposed  that their eastern and western borders were the two oceans. These were  commonly the boundaries which the English king had given them; and when  he had not been quite clear about it in his grants of territory which he  had never even imagined, they did not allow him to deal less splendidly  with them than such a prince ought. He had, as we know, given the Ohio  Company of Virginia a large tract of the best land beyond the Ohio  even while the French still claimed the West, and he had encouraged the  Virginians to believe they had a right to settle it and to fortify it.  But after the capture of Quebec, when the West, as well as Canada,  fell into the power of Great Britain, the English king, or rather his  ministers, began to change their minds about letting the colonists take  up lands in the Back Country, as they called it. The jealousy between  the colonies grew less, but the jealousy between them and Great Britain  grew greater; there were outbreaks here and there against her rule, and  there was discontent nearly everywhere. The colonists were disappointed  and embittered that the West should be treated as a part of Canada, by  the mother country, when it ought to have been shared among the English  provinces. The British government tried to hinder the settlement of  the whites on the Indians' lands; and though it could not keep them off  altogether, it did enough to make the savages feel that it was their  friend against its own subjects. In 1774, Parliament passed a law which  declared the whole West, between the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, and  below the Great Lakes, a part of the Province of Quebec. This was felt  by our colonies to be so great an injury that it was charged against  Great Britain in the Declaration of Independence, as one of the causes  for separation. It was in fact an act hostile to a people of the British  race, language, and religion, and it was meant not so much to help  the savages, as to hurt the colonists, though it did really help the  savages. When the Revolutionary War broke out a year or two later, the  British government did not scruple to make use of the cruel hatred of  the Indians against its rebellious subjects.    [Illustration: Indian war parties joining the English 047]    It set on the war parties that harried the American border, and when the  blood-stained braves came back with their plunder, their captives, and  the scalps of the men, women, and children they had murdered, they were  welcomed at the British forts as friends and allies. In certain cases,  to be sure, British officers did what they could to soften the hard fate  of the prisoners, but the British government was guilty, nevertheless,  of the barbarous deeds done by the Indians. Its agents furnished them  with arms and ammunition, and its ministers upheld them in the same  atrocities against the American rebels as the French in their time had  urged and tempted them to commit against the settlers when they were  English subjects.    At the end of the Revolutionary War, the Indians were as slow to lay  down their arms as they had been after the French War. In each case they  fought the victors, as far as they could get at them in the persons  of the hapless backwoodsmen and their wives and children.

The time had arrived when, as Park felt, he must either again submit to  the tyrannical treatment of Ali, or perish possibly in attempting to  escape.  At night he got ready a bundle of clothes, consisting of two  shirts and two pair of trousers, with a cloak and a _few_ other  articles; but he had not a single bead to purchase food for himself or  his horse.  About daybreak Johnson came and told him that the Moors were  asleep.  The awful crisis had now arrived; a cold perspiration stood on  his brow as he thought of the dreadful alternative and reflected that  one way or the other his fate must be decided in the course of the day.  To deliberate was to lose the only chance of escape; so, taking up his  bundle, he stepped gently over the negroes sleeping in the air, mounted  his horse, bade Johnson farewell, desiring him to take particular care  of the papers with which he had intrusted him, and to say that he had  left him in good health, on his way to Bambarra.    He rode on, expecting every moment to be overtaken by the Moorish  horsemen.  Some shepherds he encountered followed, hooting and throwing  stones at him.  Scarcely was he out of their reach, and was again  indulging in the hopes of escaping, when he heard somebody call behind  him, and on looking back, he saw three Moors on horseback galloping at  full speed and brandishing their weapons.  To escape was vain.  He  stopped, and one of them, presenting his musket, told him that he must  go back to Ali.  The effect of this announcement was to benumb his  faculties.  He rode back with apparent unconcern, but he had not gone  far when the Moors, stopping, ordered him to untie his bundle.  Having  examined the articles, they found nothing worth taking except his cloak,  and one of them, pulling it off, wrapped it about himself.  It had  served to protect him from the rain in the day and the dews at night,  and was of the greatest value to him.  He earnestly begged the robbers  to return it, but his petition was unheeded.  As he attempted to follow  them to regain his cloak, one of the robbers struck his horse over the  head, and presenting his musket, ordered him to proceed no further.  Finding that the sole object of the Moors had been to plunder him, he  turned his horse's head towards the east, thankful to have escaped with  his life.    As soon as he was out of sight of the robbers, he struck into the woods  and pushed on with all possible speed.  He had at length obtained his  liberty--his limbs felt light, even the desert looked pleasant.  He soon  recollected, however, that he had no means of procuring food, nor a  prospect of finding water.    He directed his course by compass in the hopes of at length reaching  some town or village in the kingdom of Bambarra.    His thirst, in consequence of the burning heat of the sun, reflected  with double violence on the sand, became intense.  He climbed a tree in  the hopes of seeing some human habitation.  Nothing appeared around but  thick underwood and hillocks of white sand.    At sunset he again climbed a tree, but the same sight met his eyes.  Descending, after taking the saddle off his horse's back, he was  suddenly seized with giddiness, and fell to the ground believing that  the hour of death was fast approaching.  He recovered, however, just as  the sun was sinking behind the trees, and now, summoning up all his  resolution, he determined to make another effort to prolong his  existence.    He had gone on some distance further when he perceived some lightening  in the north-east, a delightful sight, for it promised rain, and soon he  heard the wind roaring among the bushes.  He was expecting the  refreshing drops, when in an instant he was covered with a cloud of  sand.  It continued to fly for nearly an hour; then more lightening  followed and then down came a few heavy drops of rain, enabling him to  quench his thirst by wringing and sucking his clothes.    He travelled on during the night, which was intensely dark, till he  perceived a light ahead.  Cautiously approaching it he heard the lowing  of cattle and the clamorous tongues of the herdsmen, which made him  suspect that it was a watering-place belonging to the Moors.  Rather  than run the risk of falling into their hands he retreated, but being  dreadfully thirsty, and fearing the approach of the burning day, he  thought it prudent to search for the wells which he expected to find at  no great distance.    While thus engaged he was perceived by a woman, who screaming out, two  people ran to her assistance from the neighbouring tents and passed  close to him.    Happily he escaped from them and, plunging again into the woods, after  proceeding a mile he heard a loud and confused noise.  Great was his  delight to find that it arose from the croaking of frogs, which was  music to his ears.    At daybreak he reached some shallow pools full of large frogs, which so  frightened his horse that he was obliged to keep them quiet by beating  the water till he had drank.  Having quenched his own thirst, he  ascended a tree to ascertain the best course to take, when he observed a  pillar of smoke about twelve miles off.  Directing his course to it he  reached a Foulah village belonging to Ali.  Hunger compelled him to  enter it, but he was denied admittance to the _dooty's_ house, and could  not obtain even a handful of corn.  Reaching, however, a humble hut at  which an old motherly-looking woman sat spinning cotton, he made signs  that he was hungry.  She immediately laid down her distaff, and desired  him in Arabic to come in, setting before him a dish of _kous-kous_.  In  return he gave her one of his pocket-handkerchiefs, and asked for a  little corn for his horse, which she readily brought him.    While his horse was feeding the people collected round him, and from  their conversation he discovered that they proposed seizing him and  conveying him back to Ali.  He therefore tied up his corn and, lest it  might be supposed that he was running from the Moors, driving his horse  before him he took a northerly direction, followed by the boys and girls  of the town.  Having got rid of his troublesome attendants he struck  into the woods, where he was compelled to pass the night with his saddle  for a pillow.  He was awakened by three Foulahs, who, taking him for a  Moor, told him that it was time to pray.  Without answering them he  saddled his horse and made his escape.    The next day he took shelter in the tent of a Foulah shepherd, who  charitably gave him boiled corn and dates, although he was recognised as  a Christian.  He here purchased some corn in exchange for some brass  buttons, and again took the road to Bambarra, which he resolved to  follow for the night.  Hearing some people approaching, he thought it  prudent to hide himself, which he did in the thick brushwood.  He there  sat holding his horse by the nose to prevent him neighing, equally  afraid of the natives without and the wild beasts within the forest.  The former took their departure, and he went on till past midnight, when  the croaking of frogs induced him to turn off from the road, that he and  his steed might quench their thirst.  Having discovered an open place  with a single tree in the midst of it, he lay down for the night.  He  was disturbed towards morning by the sound of wolves, which made him  once more mount.    On the morning of the 5th of July he reached a negro town in the  confines of Bambarra.  It was a small place surrounded by high walls,  inhabited by a mixture of Mandingoes and Foulahs, chiefly employed in  the cultivation of corn.  The people were suspicious of his character,  some supposing him to be an Arab, others a Moorish sultan, but the  _dooty_, or chief magistrate, who had been at Gambia, took his part, and  assured them that he was a white man.  On its being reported that he was  going to Sego, the capital, several women came and begged that he would  enquire of Mansong what had become of their children, who had been  carried off to fight.    He was allowed to take his departure without molestation, and on the 6th  reached the town of Dingyee.    When he was about to depart the next morning, the landlord begged him to  give him a lock of his hair, understanding that white men's hair made a  _saphie_, or charm, which would bestow on the possessor all their  knowledge.  This he willingly promised to do, but the landlord's thirst  for learning was such that he cropped nearly the whole of one side of  his head, and would have done the same with the other had not Park told  him that he wished to reserve some of this precious merchandise for a  future occasion.    Having reached the town of Wassiboo, shortly afterwards eight fugitive  Kaartan negroes, who had escaped from the tyrannical government of the  Moors, arrived, on their road to offer their allegiance to the king of  Bambarra.  Park gladly accepted their invitation to accompany them on  their road.    His horse at the end of three days, becoming completely knocked up, he  dismounted and desired his companions to ride on, telling them he would  follow; but they declined leaving him, declaring that lions were  numerous, and that, though they would not attack a body of people, they  would soon find out a single individual and destroy him.  One of the  party, therefore, insisted on remaining with him, and he and his friend,  after he had rested, overtook their companions, passing through several  of the numerous towns in this part of the country.  His horse, now  becoming weaker and weaker, he was"]]]
