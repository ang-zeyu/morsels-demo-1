He in whom that feeling is destroyed, and taken out with the very  root, finds rest by day and by night.    251. There is no fire like passion, there is no shark like hatred, there  is no snare like folly, there is no torrent like greed.    252. The fault of others is easily perceived, but that of oneself is  difficult to perceive; a man winnows his neighbour's faults like chaff,  but his own fault he hides, as a cheat hides the bad die from the  gambler.    253. If a man looks after the faults of others, and is always inclined  to be offended, his own passions will grow, and he is far from the  destruction of passions.    254. There is no path through the air, a man is not a Samana by outward  acts. The world delights in vanity, the Tathagatas (the Buddhas) are  free from vanity.    255. There is no path through the air, a man is not a Samana by outward  acts. No creatures are eternal; but the awakened (Buddha) are never  shaken.          Chapter XIX. The Just    256, 257. A man is not just if he carries a matter by violence; no, he  who distinguishes both right and wrong, who is learned and leads others,  not by violence, but by law and equity, and who is guarded by the law  and intelligent, he is called just.    258. A man is not learned because he talks much; he who is patient, free  from hatred and fear, he is called learned.    259. A man is not a supporter of the law because he talks much; even if  a man has learnt little, but sees the law bodily, he is a supporter of  the law, a man who never neglects the law.    260. A man is not an elder because his head is grey; his age may be  ripe, but he is called `Old-in-vain.'    261. He in whom there is truth, virtue, love, restraint, moderation, he  who is free from impurity and is wise, he is called an elder.    262. An envious greedy, dishonest man does not become respectable by  means of much talking only, or by the beauty of his complexion.    263. He in whom all this is destroyed, and taken out with the very root,  he, when freed from hatred and wise, is called respectable.    264. Not by tonsure does an undisciplined man who speaks falsehood  become a Samana; can a man be a Samana who is still held captive by  desire and greediness?    265. He who always quiets the evil, whether small or large, he is called  a Samana (a quiet man), because he has quieted all evil.    266. A man is not a mendicant (Bhikshu) simply because he asks others  for alms; he who adopts the whole law is a Bhikshu, not he who only  begs.    267. He who is above good and evil, who is chaste, who with knowledge  passes through the world, he indeed is called a Bhikshu.    268, 269. A man is not a Muni because he observes silence (mona, i.e.  mauna), if he is foolish and ignorant; but the wise who, taking the  balance, chooses the good and avoids evil, he is a Muni, and is a Muni  thereby; he who in this world weighs both sides is called a Muni.    270. A man is not an elect (Ariya) because he injures living creatures;  because he has pity on all living creatures, therefore is a man called  Ariya.    271, 272. Not only by discipline and vows, not only by much learning,  not by entering into a trance, not by sleeping alone, do I earn the  happiness of release which no worldling can know. Bhikshu, be not  confident as long as thou hast not attained the extinction of desires.          Chapter XX. The Way    273. The best of ways is the eightfold; the best of truths the four  words; the best of virtues passionlessness; the best of men he who has  eyes to see.    274. This is the way, there is no other that leads to the purifying of  intelligence. Go on this way! Everything else is the deceit of Mara (the  tempter).    275. If you go on this way, you will make an end of pain! The way was  preached by me, when I had understood the removal of the thorns (in the  flesh).    276. You yourself must make an effort. The Tathagatas (Buddhas) are only  preachers. The thoughtful who enter the way are freed from the bondage  of Mara.    277. `All created things perish,' he who knows and sees this becomes  passive in pain; this is the way to purity.    278. `All created things are grief and pain,' he who knows and sees this  becomes passive in pain; this is the way that leads to purity.    279. `All forms are unreal,' he who knows and sees this becomes passive  in pain; this is the way that leads to purity.    280. He who does not rouse himself when it is time to rise, who, though  young and strong, is full of sloth, whose will and thought are weak,  that lazy and idle man will never find the way to knowledge.    281. Watching his speech, well restrained in mind, let a man never  commit any wrong with his body! Let a man but keep these three roads of  action clear, and he will achieve the way which is taught by the wise.    282. Through zeal knowledge is gotten, through lack of zeal knowledge is  lost; let a man who knows this double path of gain and loss thus place  himself that knowledge may grow.    283. Cut down the whole forest (of lust), not a tree only! Danger comes  out of the forest (of lust). When you have cut down both the forest (of  lust) and its undergrowth, then, Bhikshus, you will be rid of the forest  and free!    284. So long as the love of man towards women, even the smallest, is not  destroyed, so long is his mind in bondage, as the calf that drinks milk  is to its mother.    285. Cut out the love of self, like an autumn lotus, with thy hand!  Cherish the road of peace. Nirvana has been shown by Sugata (Buddha).    286. `Here I shall dwell in the rain, here in winter and summer,' thus  the fool meditates, and does not think of his death.    287. Death comes and carries off that man, praised for his children and  flocks, his mind distracted, as a flood carries off a sleeping village.    288. Sons are no help, nor a father, nor relations; there is no help  from kinsfolk for one whom death has seized.    289. A wise and good man who knows the meaning of this, should quickly  clear the way that leads to Nirvana.          Chapter XXI. Miscellaneous    290. If by leaving a small pleasure one sees a great pleasure, let a  wise man leave the small pleasure, and look to the great.    291. He who, by causing pain to others, wishes to obtain pleasure for  himself, he, entangled in the bonds of hatred, will never be free from  hatred.    292. What ought to be done is neglected, what ought not to be done is  done; the desires of unruly, thoughtless people are always increasing.    293. But they whose whole watchfulness is always directed to their body,  who do not follow what ought not to be done, and who steadfastly do what  ought to be done, the desires of such watchful and wise people will come  to an end.    294. A true Brahmana goes scatheless, though he have killed father and  mother, and two valiant kings, though he has destroyed a kingdom with  all its subjects.    295. A true Brahmana goes scatheless, though he have killed father and  mother, and two holy kings, and an eminent man besides.    296. The disciples of Gotama (Buddha) are always well awake, and their  thoughts day and night are always set on Buddha.    297. The disciples of Gotama are always well awake, and their thoughts  day and night are always set on the law.    298. The disciples of Gotama are always well awake, and their thoughts  day and night are always set on the church.    299. The disciples of Gotama are always well awake, and their thoughts  day and night are always set on their body.    300. The disciples of Gotama are always well awake, and their mind day  and night always delights in compassion.    301. The disciples of Gotama are always well awake, and their mind day  and night always delights in meditation.    302. It is hard to leave the world (to become a friar), it is hard to  enjoy the world; hard is the monastery, painful are the houses; painful  it is to dwell with equals (to share everything in common) and the  itinerant mendicant is beset with pain. Therefore let no man be an  itinerant mendicant and he will not be beset with pain.    303. Whatever place a faithful, virtuous, celebrated, and wealthy man  chooses, there he is respected.    304. Good people shine from afar, like the snowy mountains; bad people  are not seen, like arrows shot by night.    305. He alone who, without ceasing, practises the duty of sitting  alone and sleeping alone, he, subduing himself, will rejoice in the  destruction of all desires alone, as if living in a forest.          Chapter XXII. The Downward Course    306. He who says what is not, goes to hell; he also who, having done a  thing, says I have not done it. After death both are equal, they are men  with evil deeds in the next world.    307. Many men whose shoulders are covered with the yellow gown are  ill-conditioned and unrestrained; such evil-doers by their evil deeds go  to hell.    308. Better it would be to swallow a heated iron ball, like flaring  fire, than that a bad unrestrained fellow should live on the charity of  the land.    309. Four things does a wreckless man gain who covets his neighbour's  wife,--a bad reputation, an uncomfortable bed, thirdly, punishment, and  lastly, hell.    310. There is bad reputation, and the evil way (to hell), there is the  short pleasure of the frightened in the arms of the frightened, and  the king imposes heavy punishment; therefore let no man think of his  neighbour's wife.    311. As a grass-blade, if badly grasped, cuts the arm, badly-practised  asceticism leads to hell.    312. An act carelessly performed, a broken vow, and hesitating obedience  to discipline, all this brings no great reward.    313. If anything is to be done, let a man do it, let him attack it  vigorously! A careless pilgrim only scatters the dust of his passions  more widely.    314. An evil deed is better left undone, for a man repents "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20191"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Durham (#5)"],[1,"has, curiously enough, also lost its  original character. The western doorway of the cathedral is hidden on  the exterior by the Galilee or Lady Chapel, which was added by Pudsey in  1175. Above the Galilee roof is the large window inserted about the year  1346, while John Fossor was prior. The pointed arch of this window has  over it, on the exterior, the original great semi-circular arch. Above  this again, and between the two flanking western towers, is a small  gable. The west end of the cathedral, when seen from the opposite side  of the river, is extremely picturesque. The projecting mass of the  Galilee, the western towers, the foreshortened nave roof, and the  majestic central tower behind and above, form a group of high and rare  excellence.    The #North Door# is now the principal entrance to the cathedral.  Externally the present porch is the work of Wyatt. The first porch was  Norman, of four orders depth, with detached shafts in the recesses.  Above this was a high-pitched gable and roof, the front being ornamented  with a semi-circular-headed wall arcading. The inner side of the doorway  is of two orders only, and is probably the only remaining portion of the  original. The outer shaft is left plain, while the inner one, in each  case, is most elaborately carved. The capitals are all carved, and the  arch moulds richly ornamented with chevrons, foliage, and lozenges, as  well as many curious figure subjects. While examining this doorway,  notice should be taken of the ironwork of the door itself, and  particularly of the sanctuary knocker. In mediaeval times all churches  afforded sanctuary to wrong-doers, but at places where the shrines of  saints existed the sanctuary privileges were much greater. Durham being  one of these, there are many curious cases on record of persons claiming  the privilege, and protection from the secular law. The earliest  instance, of which any record has been kept, of sanctuary being claimed  at the shrine of S. Cuthbert is during the episcopate of Cynewulf, who  was bishop from 740 to 748, and the last recorded was in 1524. Criminals  claiming sanctuary were admitted by two janitors, who occupied two  small chambers over the doorway, traces of which may still be observed.  The knocker itself, as may be seen from the illustration, is a great  grotesque head, made of bronze, and hanging from its grinning mouth is a  ring. Originally, there is no doubt, the eyes were filled with crystals  or enamel, as small claw-like pieces of bronze remain by which the  filling was attached. The age of this piece of work is probably the same  as that of the doorway itself.    [Illustration: Detail Of Ironwork.]    [Illustration: The Sanctuary Knocker.]    [Illustration: Ironwork On Doors of Cloisters.]    The #South Doorways.#--There are two doorways into the south aisle,  one, known as the Monks' Door, opening from the western portion of the  cloisters and immediately opposite the north porch just described. On  the cloister side this shows a Norman arch resting on double shafts,  which are enriched with a lozenge pattern. On the inner or aisle side  there are two orders, with shafts in the recesses, which are also  decorated with the lozenge. The inner arch is carved with chevrons, and  the outer with conventional foliage and medallions. The capitals are  richly carved with foliage and grotesques. On the abacus and arch of  this doorway occurs a leaf pattern strongly suggesting the Byzantine  influence which at one time was found in Norman decoration. Here again,  on the door itself, we have a fine specimen of very elaborate and  characteristic Norman iron-work. The second, known as the Priors' Door,  opens into the south aisle from the eastern alley of the cloister, is  also Norman. The outer or cloister side is of the time of Bishop Pudsey,  and has an arch of four orders, with three shafts in the recesses on  either side. Its once elaborate sculpture is now much decayed, not  enough remaining to suggest that in its original state this doorway must  have been a noble specimen of the architectural design of its period. On  the inner side it exhibits work of Carileph's time, with an early arch,  cushion capitals, and shafts.    [Illustration: Ornament On South Doorway.]    The #Western Doorway.#--The exterior of this great doorway is now within  the Galilee chapel. It was built by Flambard (1099-1128), and is  comparatively plain. On the Galilee side it consists of an arch of four  orders ornamented with chevrons. The inner face is very similar to the  outer, but is shallower, having only two orders. The shafts and capitals  are without decoration, and the arch ornamented with chevron and a leaf  pattern with medallions carved with grotesque animals. In order to  reopen this doorway and make a carriage road up to it, Wyatt proposed  pulling down the Galilee chapel.    [Illustration: The Cloister.]    The #Cloister# occupies a large open space, bounded on the south,  east, and west by the various monastic buildings, and on the north by  the cathedral itself. The existing cloister was commenced during the  time of Bishop Skirlaw (1388 to 1406), and was completed by Cardinal  Langley (who held the see from 1406 till 1438), probably in the earlier  part of his episcopate. The contracts (the first dated 1398) for  building the cloister are still preserved in the treasury. We are  indebted to Bishop Skirlaw for their very existence, as it is recorded  that he contributed sums of money for this purpose, both during his life  and by his will. The cloister, as seen to-day, has been very much  altered and restored, and probably the only original feature remaining  is the fine oaken ceiling. This is panelled, and moulded, and decorated  with shields, upon which are painted and gilded various coats of arms.  In the centre of the cloister garth are the remains of what was the  monks' lavatory. It was erected in the years 1432 and 1433, and was of  octagonal shape. Some of the stone for its construction was brought from  Egglestone-on-Tees, on payment of rent to the abbot of that place to  quarry it. It is said to have had twenty-four brass spouts, seven  windows, and in its upper storey a dovecote, the roof of which was  covered with lead.    There is no doubt that there was a cloister attached to the monastery in  its early days, but of this no trace remains. It is also probable that  one was erected by Bishop Pudsey, though this also has entirely  vanished, unless (as suggested by Canon Greenwell) some marks of a  lean-to roof on the north and east walls may be traces of its presence.  In the western alley of the cloister is the old treasury, rich in  records, and the vestries for canons, king's scholars, and choristers.  The alley opens at the end into what is now called the crypt (see p.  85). This was undoubtedly the common hall of the monks. It is a spacious  stone-vaulted chamber. The columns are low and massive, with simple  moulded caps, from which the chamfered vaulting ribs diverge. Over the  hall or crypt is the dormitory, which for a long time formed part of a  residence attached to one of the stalls. It is now, however, used as a  library. It occupies the whole of the western side of the cloister, and  is 194 feet long. It was originally subdivided, by wooden partitions,  into separate sleeping-rooms for each monk. Its massive roof of oak is  worthy of attention, the tree trunks being merely roughly squared with  an axe (see p. 99).    In the south alley was the refectory and the monks' common dining-hall.  The original building is now entirely altered, though there remains  beneath it a very early crypt, with plain, short square piers, and a  simple quadripartite vault without ribs. Another portion is covered by a  wagon-head vault. Whether the original refectory was of similar  architectural character it is now impossible to say, as, whatever it may  have been, it was removed early in the sixteenth century and rebuilt,  and after the dissolution of the monastery was used by the Minor Canons  of the church as a common hall. It seems to have fallen into a bad state  of repair, and was again entirely reconstructed by Dean Sudbury  (1661-1684), who was elected to that office immediately after the  Restoration. He converted it into a library, to which use it is still  put. The account of this building, given in the \"Antiquities of Durham,\"  is of sufficient interest to bear quotation.        \"In the _South_ Alley of the Cloysters,\" says our authority, \"is a      large Hall, called the Frater-house, finely wainscotted on the      _North_ and _South_ sides; and in the _West_ and nether Part      thereof, is a long Bench of Stone in Mason-work, from the Cellar      Door to the Pantry or Cove Door: Above the Bench is Wainscot Work      two Yards and a Half high, finely carved, and set with imboss'd Work      in Wainscot, and gilded under the carved Work. Above the Wainscot      was a large Picture of our Saviour Christ, the blessed Virgin      _Mary_, and _S. John_, in fine gilt Work, and most excellent      Colours; which Pictures having been washed over with Lime did long      appear through it. This Wainscot had engraven on the Top of it,      _Thomas Castell_, Prior, Anno Domini, 1518 Mensis Julij. Whence it      is manifest that Prior _Castell_ wainscotted the Frater-house round      about.        \"Within the Frater-house Door, on the Left Hand at entering, is a      strong Almery in the Wall, wherein a great Mazer, called the Grace      Cup, stood, which every day served the Monks after Grace, to drink      out of round the Table; which cup was finely edged about with      Silver, and double Gilt. In the same place were kept many large and      great Mazers of the same sort.... Every Monk had his Mazer severally      by himself to drink in, and had all other Things that served the      whole Convent, and the Frater-house in their daily Service, at their      Diet, and at their "]]]
