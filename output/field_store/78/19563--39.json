Tablets of Abdul-Baha Abbas  Volume I  Published by  BAHAI PUBLISHING SOCIETY  P. O. Box 283  CHICAGO, U.S.A.          Introduction      This book is a reproduction of the Tablets of Abdul-Baha as contained in  the archives of the House of Spirituality(1) of Bahais of Chicago from the  recipients for the purpose of safe preservation in accordance with the  purpose mentioned in the following letter sent out by that Body:    March 21, 1908.    To the Friends of God in the Light of El-Abha, throughout America.    Greeting:--    For a number of years the House of Spirituality has been gathering copies  of Tablets, received by the Friends in America from Abdul-Baha Abbas, for  sacred preservation in its archives, in accord with permission from him to  do so in a Tablet addressed to it dated April 21, 1903, as follows: \"As to  the compiling of the Tablets in a Book for the House of Spirituality, this  depends upon the consent of the receivers of the Tablets; if the owners of  the Tablets consent, copies should be kept and collected in the House of  Spirituality and it will be acceptable.\"    Although many Tablets, both published and unpublished, were known to be in  circulation among the believers, and notwithstanding the restriction to  collect only copies sent in with the consent of the recipients, yet, in  the spring of 1907, through the hearty response and co-operation in this  endeavor about 500 copies of different Tablets had been received,  acknowledge and filed with data concerning each in a safety deposit vault  equipped with all modern appliances for protection.    We believe the Friends everywhere will be further interested in knowing  that at that time a draft of the Tablets was made by the Librarian of the  House of Spirituality for the Bahai Publishing Society (who contemplated  issuing same in book form), with all references to personalities  eliminated, and said compilation was taken by Mr. Agnew to the presence of  Abdul-Baha, who inquired especially as to elimination of all names of  persons and everything of a clearly personal nature, and as to whether the  recipients of the Tablets had consented to publication of them, etc.--to  all of which he gave approval and instructed the Publishing Society to  proceed with the work.    The purpose of this communication is therefore twofold: First, that the  endeavor be continued to preserve a copy of every Tablet obtainable; and  second, that it be accomplished at the earliest possible moment in order  to make the forthcoming Volumes of Tablets (now being prepared by the  Publishing Society) as complete as possible, for only the Tablets in the  archives of the House will be used, as therein is recorded the desire of  the recipients.    In sending copies of Tablets, kindly see in so far as possible that  together with each is given: (1) Full name of recipient (2) present  address, mentioning street number, city or town, and state, (3) on or  about date translation, (4) name of translator, (5) clearly state whether  or not permission to publish all or only a portion of same is granted.  Should there be any doubt as to whether or not a copy of any certain  Tablet is already in the archives, you may be assured in knowing that  every Tablet received has been acknowledged on a special printed form,  signed by the Librarian.    Concerning this important matter the following words of Abdul-Baha will be  of interest to all: \"Verily know, that the Tablets (Book) of Abdul-Baha  and his address is a hidden mystery and concealed fact; no one is informed  of its greatness and importance at these times. But in the course of times  and future centuries, the signs thereof will be manifested, the lights  thereof will dawn, the fragrance thereof will be diffused, and the  greatness, the importance thereof will be known. The truth I say unto  thee, that each leaflet from Abdul-Baha will be a wide-spread Book; nay,  rather, a glistening Gem on the Glorious Crown. Know thou Its value and  hold great Its station!\"    Thanking you in advance, we are your fellow servants in the Vineyard of  El-Abha,    The House of Spirituality          \"A sufficient number of Tablets having been gathered together,...\"      A sufficient number of Tablets having been gathered together, they have  been entrusted to the Baha'i Publishing Society for publication in this  concrete form for the enlightenment of the English-speaking world.    The Tablets appear in the book in the order received and filed in the  archives, i.e. the first to respond to the above letter sent out by the  House of Spirituality appear first in the book, and, so far as possible,  all the Tablets to any one person or to a family or to an assembly have  been placed together.    Regarding publications, the following Tablet from Abdul-Baha was received  by this Society in October, 1906:          \"He is God!...\"      He is God! O ye heavenly Assemblage!    Your letter was received and its contents became known. Ye have written  concerning the printing and publication of the Tablets.    The translation of the Surat-ul-Hykl(2) is of the utmost difficulty. It  must be translated by a committee who are exceedingly efficient both in  Persian and English, exercising the closest and most minute attention.  Otherwise the text would not become intelligible. The same rule applieth  to other Writings and Tablets. For the present the organization of such a  committee of translators is not possible and there is no other means than  the translations made by individuals. In the future, God willing, means  will be brought about. Translations will be made by a committee composed  of two most erudite Persians and two learned Americans, all of them having  the utmost proficiency in both languages and possessing a certain  knowledge of sciences and arts. Then others from among the scholars and  thinkers must assist. At that time Tablets will be translated correctly  and published. What ye have in your hands and what is already printed will  impart a certain degree of information. Whatever matter the spiritual  Boards of Council in New York, Chicago, Washington and Kenosha unanimously  deem advisable to print and publish, ye may print and publish; and have  the utmost union and oneness with each other.    Regarding the Tablets of Abdul-Baha: Each of them is important. Print ye  those which are in detail.    As to the question of annihilation and destruction of the Spirits(3) : Mr.  Phelps hath not not fully understood the matter or else the translator  hath made some mistake. It was not intended to convey the idea that the  unbelieving souls are absolutely annihilated. Nay, rather, it was meant  that the existence of the evil spirits in comparison to the existence of  the sanctified souls was like unto annihilation. As you clearly behold,  the existence of mineral in comparison with the existence of man is like  unto non-being. When the body of man is destroyed and disintegrated, it  returneth to the mineral.    Concerning the income of the printing and publishing society, as ye write,  it must be expended for charitable purposes.    O ye believers of God! I am pleased with you and seek for your assistance  and confirmation. I hope that ye may, day by day, add to your love,  steadfastness, purity of intention and service to the Cause of God.    Upon ye be greeting and praise!    Abdul-Baha Abbas.          \"These Tablets were originally written in Persian and all...\"      These Tablets were originally written in Persian and all bear the caption,  \"He is God!\"(4) and close with expressions of good will, such as, \"Upon ye  be greetings and praise!\" These expressions have been omitted from this  compilation; also such portions as are clearly of a personal nature, as  well as names of persons, as instructed by Abdul-Baha.    Omission of names of persons has been designated by the sign, thus  ........; omission of purely personal portions of the text have been  designated by the sign, thus ***. The translator's interpolations are  enclosed in parentheses, thus ( ); editor's interpolations are enclosed in  brackets, thus [ ]. For messages within Tablets a special sign has been  found necessary and these messages are enclosed within this special sign,  thus ~ ~. Quotations are shown by the usual sign, thus \" \".    The great labor of translating these Tablets from the original language  has been entrusted to the following translators, whose inestimable service  is hereby gratefully acknowledged: Anton Haddad, Mirza S. M. Raffie, Mirza  Housein Rouhy, Ali Kuli Khan, Dr. Ameen U. Fareed, H. S. M. Taki Manshadi,  Mirza Ahmad Esphahani, Mrs. Getsinger, Miss Barney and Mirza Moneer Zane.    The House of Spirituality desires to thank all who have assisted in this  matter of gathering in copies of Tablets for preservation in its archives,  and requests"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19317"],[0,"Gallipoli Diary,  Volume 1 (#5)"],[1,"ch, 1915, having entered the  harbour at the very same instant as le general d'Amade.    Hurried over at once to a meeting aboard that lovely sea monster, H.M.S.  _Queen Elizabeth_.    Present:--      Admiral de Robeck,    Commodore Roger Keyes,    Admiral Guepratte, cmdg. French Fleet,    General d'Amade,    General Braithwaite,    Admiral Wemyss,    Captain Pollen,    Myself.    De Robeck greeted me in the friendliest fashion. He is a fine looking  man with great charm of manner. After a word or two to d'Amade and being  introduced to Wemyss, Guepratte and Keyes, we sat down round a table and  the Admiral began. His chief worry lies in the clever way the enemy are  now handling their mobile artillery. He can silence the big fortress  ordnance, but the howitzers and field guns fire from concealed  positions and make the clearing of the minefields something of a V.C.  sort of job for the smaller craft. Even when the Fleet gets through,  these moveable guns will make it very nasty for store ships or  transports which follow. The mine-sweepers are slow and bad with worn  out engines. Some of the civilian masters and crews of the trawlers have  to consider wives and kids as well as V.C.s. The problem of getting the  Fleet through or of getting submarines through is a problem of clearing  away the mines. With a more powerfully engined type of mine-sweeper and  regular naval commanders and crews to man them, the business would be  easy. But as things actually stand there is real cause for anxiety as to  mines.    The Peninsula itself is being fortified and many Turks work every night  on trenches, redoubts and entanglements. Not one single living soul has  been seen, since the engagement of our Marines at the end of February,  although each morning brings forth fresh evidences of nocturnal  activity, in patches of freshly turned up soil. All landing places are  now commanded by lines of trenches and are ranged by field guns and  howitzers, which, thus far, cannot be located as our naval seaplanes are  too heavy to rise out of rifle range. There has been a muddle about  these seaplanes. Nominally they possess very powerful Sunbeam engines;  actually the d----d things can barely rise off the water. The naval  guns do not seem able to knock the Turkish Infantry out of their deep  trenches although they can silence their fire for awhile. This was  proved at that last landing by Marines. The Turkish searchlights are  both fixed and mobile. They are of the latest pattern and are run by  skilled observers. He gave us, in fact, to understand that German  thoroughness and forethought have gripped the old go-as-you-please Turk  and are making him march to the _Parade-schritt_.    The Admiral would prefer to force a passage on his own, and is sure he  can do so. Setting Constantinople on one side for the moment, _if_ the  Fleet gets through and the Army _then_ attacks at Bulair, we would have  the Turkish Army on the Peninsula in a regular trap. Therefore, whether  from the local or the larger point of view, he has no wish to call us in  until he has had a real good try. He means straightway to put the whole  proposition to a practical test.    His views dovetail in to a hair's breadth with K.'s views. The Admiral's  \"real good try\" leads up towards K.'s \"after every effort has been  exhausted.\"    That's a bit of luck for our kick-off, anyway. What we soldiers have to  do now is to hammer away at our band-o-bast[5] whilst the Navy pushes as  hard, as fast and as far as its horsepower, manpower and gunpower will  carry it.    The Admiral asked to see my instructions and Braithwaite read them out.  When he stopped, Roger Keyes, the Commodore, inquired, \"Is that all?\"  And when Braithwaite confessed that it was, everyone looked a little  blank.    Asked what I meant to do, I said I proposed to get ready for a landing,  as, whether the Fleet forces the passage and disembarked us on the  Bosphorus; or, whether the Fleet did not force the passage and we had to  \"go for\" the Peninsula, the _band-o-bast_ could be made to suit either  case.    The Admiral asked if I meant to land at Bulair? I replied my mind was  open on that point: that I was a believer in seeing things for myself  and that I would not come to any decision on the map if it were possible  to come to it on the ground. He then said he would send me up to look at  the place through my own glasses in the Phaeton to-morrow; that it would  not be possible to land large forces on the neck of Bulair itself as  there were no beaches, but that I should reconnoitre the coast at the  head of the Gulf as landing would be easier with every few miles we drew  away towards the North. I told him it would be useless to land at any  distance from my objective, for the simple reason that I had no  transport, mechanical or horse, wheeled or pack, to enable me to support  myself further than five or six miles from the Fleet and it would take  many weeks and many ships to get it together; however, I ended, I would  to-morrow see for myself.    The air of the Aegean hardly differs so much from the North Sea haze as  does the moral atmosphere of Tenedos differ from that of the War Office.  This is always the way. Until the plunge is taken, the man in the arm  chair clamps rose coloured spectacles on to his nose and the man on the  spot is anxious; _but_, once the men on the spot jump off they become  as jolly as sandboys, whilst the man in the arm chair sits searching for  a set-back with a blue lens telescope.    Here, the Peninsula looks a tougher nut to crack than it did on Lord K.'s  small and featureless map. I do not speak for myself for I have so far  only examined the terrain through a field glass. I refer to the tone of  the sailors, which strikes me as being graver and less irresponsible  than the tone of the War Office.    The Admiral believes that, at the time of the first bombardment, 5000  men could have marched from Cape Helles right up to the Bulair lines.  (Before leaving the ship I learnt that some of the sailors do not  agree). Now that phase has passed. Many more troops have come down,  German Staff Officers have grappled with the situation, and have got  their troops scientifically disposed and heavily entrenched. This  skilful siting of the Turkish trenches has been admired by all competent  British observers; the number of field guns on the Peninsula is now many  times greater than it was.    After this the discussion became informal. Referring again to my  instructions, I laid stress on the point that I was a waiting man and  that it was the Admiral's innings for so long as he could keep his  wicket up. Braithwaite asked a question or two about the trenches and  all of us deplored the lack of aeroplanes whereby we were blinded in our  attack upon an enemy who espied every boat's crew moving over the  water.    The more I revolve these matters in my mind, the more easy does it seem  to accept K.'s order not to be in too great a hurry to bring the Army to  the front. I devoutly hope indeed (and I think the fiercest of our  fellows agree) that the Navy will pull us out the chestnuts from the  fire.    At the close of the sitting I made these notes of what had happened and  drafted a first cable to Lord K., giving him an epitome of the Admiral's  opening statement about the enemy's clever use of field guns to hinder  the clearing of the minefields; his good entrenchments and the nightly  work thereon; our handicap in all these matters because the type of  seaplanes sent us \"are too heavy to rise out of effective rifle  range\"--(one has to put these things mildly). I add that the Admiral,  \"while not making light of dangers was evidently determined to exhaust  every effort before calling upon the soldiers for their help on a large  scale\"; and I wind up by telling him Lemnos seems a bad base and that I  am off to-morrow on an inspection of the coasts of the Peninsula. Having  got these matters off my chest on to the chest of K., was then taken  round the ship by the Flag Captain, G.P.W. Hope. By this time it was  nearly 7 so I stayed and dined with the Admiral--a charming host. After  dinner got back here.    _18th March, 1915._ _H.M.S. \"Phaeton.\"_ Cleared Tenedos Harbour at 4  a.m. and reached Lemnos at 6 a.m. I never saw so many ships collected  together in my life; no, not even at Hong Kong, Bombay or New York.  Filled up with oil fuel and at 7 a.m. d'Amade and Major-General Paris,  commanding the Royal Naval Division, came on board with one or two Staff  Officers. After consulting these Officers as well as McLagan, the  Australian Brigadier, cabled Lord K. to say Alexandria _must_ be our  base as \"the Naval Division transports have been loaded up as in peace  time and they must be completely discharged and every ship reloaded,\" in  war fashion. At Lemnos, where there are neither wharfs, piers, labour  nor water, the thing could not be done. Therefore, \"the closeness of  Lemnos to the Dardanelles, as implying the rapid transport of troops, is  illusory.\"    The moment I got this done, namely, at 8.30 a.m., we worked our way out  of the long narrow neck of Mudros Harbour and sailed for the Gulf of  Saros. Spent the first half of the sixty mile run to the Dardanelles in  scribbling. Wrote my first epistle to K., using for the first time the  formal \"Dear Lord Kitchener.\" My letters to him will have to be formal,  and dull also, as he may hand them around. I begin, \"I have just sent  you off a cable giving my first impressions of the situation, and am now  steaming in company with Generals d'Amade and Paris to inspect the  North-western coast of the Gallipoli Peninsula.\" I tell him that the  real place \"looks a much tougher nut to crack than it did over the  map,\"--I say that his \"impression that the ground between Cape Helles  and Krithia was clear of the enemy,\" was mistaken. \"Not a bit of it.\" I  say, \"The Admiral tells me that there is a large number of men tucked"]]]
