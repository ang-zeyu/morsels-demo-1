Its vertical wall is cast in a single  piece, and has at the top a flange or bead extending inwardly, against  which the compressing plate abuts when the spring is not compressed,  as shown in Fig. 2. A bottom plate completes the case.    The spiral components of the spring are inclosed in tubes, as shown in  Figs. 1 and 3. It is not deemed essential that these tubes should be  seamless, or that their edges, brought together in bending, should be  soldered, brazed, or welded. They act merely as guides to compel the  component springs to expand or contract in vertical lines, and need  only be strong enough for that purpose.    The compressing plate is formed with concentric steps or ledges,  as shown in Fig. 2, so that with light loads, only a portion of the  component spirals act. With a heavier load a new series of spirals is  brought into action, and so on, till the spring is loaded to its full  capacity. This feature is novel, and as important as novel, as it  gives the spring a far more easy and flexible carriage, with light  loads, than would be the case if all the spirals were permitted to  act.    In putting the spring together, the vertical part of the case is  inverted. The compressing plate is then placed within the case,  resting upon the inner flange of the case above described. The tubes  with their inclosed springs are then arranged in position, as shown in  the plan view, Fig. 3. The bottom plate of the case is then placed in  position, and held to its place by lugs and rivets, as shown in Fig.  1; the spring is then ready for use.    The employment of tubes in the manner described, enables springs of  the greatest practical length to be used, without the sectional or  division plates met with in other spiral car springs. A greater  and easier movement is therefore obtained. These springs can, it  is claimed, compete in price with any spring in market, and are  guaranteed by the manufacturers.

This device is the invention of A. G. Buzby, of Philadelphia, Pa. It  is a combined writing and copying case. Besides the usual recesses  or chambers for pen, ink, paper, etc., it is provided with a book of  copying paper, in which copies of important letters may be made, by  damping the letters in the usual way, and pressing them between the  leaves of the copying book; or the transfer paper may be used, so that  the letter will be copied as it is written, if preferred.    [Illustration]           *       *       *       *       *          HOW WALKING STICKS ARE MADE.      Sticks are manufactured both from large timber of from two to six  feet girth, and from small underwood of about the thickness of a man's  thumb. The timber, which is chiefly beech, is first sawed into battens  of about three feet in length and as many inches in width; and  from each of these battens two square sticks, with square heads are  afterwards cut in opposite directions, so that the middle portion  is waste wood. The corners of each are afterwards rounded off by a  planing process called \"trapping,\" and the square head is reduced, by  a small saw, to a curve or rectangular bend, so as to form a handle.  When the sticks are brought in this way to the exact size and pattern,  they are polished with great care, are finely varnished, and packed  in boxes or bundles for the market. Many sawn sticks, however, are  supplied with bone and horn handles, which are fastened on with glue;  and then of course there is less wood waste, as a larger number of  them may be cut from one batten.    A very different process takes place in the manufacture of sticks  from small underwood, in which there is no sawing required. The rough  unfashioned sticks, which are generally of hazel, ash, oak and thorn,  are cut with a bill in the same way as kidney bean sticks, and are  brought to the factory in large bavins or bundles, piled on a timber  tug. There must of course, be some little care in their selection, yet  it is evident that the woodmen are not very particular on this score,  for they have in general an ungainly appearance; and many are so  crooked and rough, that no drover or country boy would think it worth  while to polish the like of them with his knife. Having arrived at  this place, however, their numerous excrescences are soon pruned away,  and their ugliness converted into elegance. When sufficiently seasoned  and fit for working, they are first laid to soak in wet sand, and  rendered more tough and pliable; a workman then takes them one by one,  and securing them with an iron stock, bends them skillfully this way  and that, so as to bring out their natural crooks, and render them at  last all straight even rods. If they are not required to be knotted,  they next go to the \"trapper,\" who puts them through a kind of  circular plane, which takes off knots, and renders them uniformly  smooth and round. The most important process of all is that of giving  them their elegantly curved handles, for which purpose they are passed  over to the \"crooker.\" Every child knows that if we bend a tough stick  moderately when the pressure is discontinued, it will soon fly back,  more or less, to its former position; and if we bend it very much,  it will break. Now the crooker professes to accomplish the miracle of  bending a stick as it might be an iron wire, so that it shall neither  break nor \"backen.\" To prevent the breaking, the wood is rendered  pliant by further soaking in wet sand; and a flexible band of metal  is clamped down firmly to that portion of the stick that will form the  outside of the curve; the top end is then fitted into a grooved iron  shoulder which determines the size of the crook, the other end being  brought round so as to point in the opposite direction; the metal  band during this process binding with increasing tightness against the  stretching fibers of the wood, so that they cannot snap or give way  under the strain. The crook having been made, the next thing is to fix  it, or remove from the fibers the reaction of elasticity, which would  otherwise, on the cessation of the bending force, cause it to backen  more or less, and undo the work. In the old process of crooking by  steam, as timber bending is effected, the stick was merely left till  it was cold to acquire a permanent set; but in the new process, a more  permanent set is given by turning the handle about briskly over a jet  of gas. The sticks being now fashioned, it only remains to polish  and stain or varnish them; and they are sometimes scorched or  burned brown, and carved with foliage, animal heads and other  devices.--_Chambers' Journal_.           *       *       *       *       *      FLOWERING OF THE VICTORIA REGIA IN THE OPEN AIR.--Joseph Mager, Esq.,  has succeeded in flowering the Victoria lily, in his pond in England.  The pond is perfectly open, but the water is heated by hot water pipes  coming from a boiler near the pond, carefully concealed. The seeds  of the Victoria were planted in May last, and the first flower was  produced Sept. 10th. Afterwards seven other flowers opened. The plant  has eight leaves, of which the largest is five feet two inches in  diameter. Mr. Mager has also succeeded in flowering a large number of  other tropical lilies in his pond.           *       *       *       *       *      JUTE, a material largely used in combination with hemp, for making  cordage, sacking, mats, and carpets, is produced in India to the  extent of 300,000 tuns per annum. The scarcity of fuel prevents its  manufacture on the spot, except by the rudest and most primitive  means, so that the bulk of the growth is sent to Great Britain.           *       *       *       *       *          VENTILATION OF THE LIVERPOOL TUNNEL.      This tunnel, which forms an ascending incline of a mile and a quarter  length from the terminal station in Lime-street London and N. W.  Railroad, was worked until recently by a rope and stationary engine,  to avoid fouling the air of the tunnel by the passage of locomotives;  but the increase of the traffic having necessitated the abandonment of  the rope and the substitution of locomotives for bringing the trains  up through the tunnel, it became requisite to provide some efficient  means of ventilation for clearing the tunnel speedily of the smoke and  steam after the passage of each train. A large exhausting fan has been  designed by Mr. John Ramsbottom for this purpose, which works in a  chamber situated near the middle of the length of the tunnel, and  draws the air in from the tunnel, through a cross drift; discharging  it up a tapering chimney that extends to a considerable hight above  the surface of the ground over the tunnel. The fan is about thirty  feet diameter, and is made with straight radial vanes; it revolves  on a horizontal shaft at a speed of about forty-five revolutions per  minute, within a brick casing, built concentric with the fan for the  first half of the circumference, and afterwards expanding gradually  for discharging into the base of the chimney, the air from the tunnel  being drawn in at the center of the fan at each side, and discharged  from the circumference of the fan by the revolution of the vanes.  The engine driving the fan is started by telegraph signal at each  departure of a train from the terminal station, and the fan is kept  running until the discharge from it becomes quite clear, showing that  no steam or smoke remains in the tunnel; this is usually the case in  about eight minutes after the time of the train entering the lower end  of the tunnel, the passage of the train through the tunnel occupying  about three minutes. The fan draws air in at both ends of the tunnel  simultaneously, and begins to clear the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19192"],[0,"What is Darwinism?

The offspring also will thus have a better  chance of surviving, for, of the many individuals of any species which  are periodically born, but a small number can survive. I have called  this principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved,  by the term Natural Selection, in order to mark its relation to man's  power of selection. But the expression often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer  of the Survival of the Fittest, is more accurate, and sometimes is  equally convenient.\" (p. 72). \"Slow though the progress of selection may  be, if feeble man can do so much by artificial selection, I can see no  limit to the amount of change, to the beauty and infinite complexity of  the co-adaptations between all organic beings, one with another, and  with their physical conditions of life, which may be effected in the  long course of time by nature's power of selection, or the survival of  the fittest.\" (p. 125). \"It may be objected that if organic beings thus  tend to rise in the scale, how is it that throughout the world a  multitude of the lowest forms still exist; and how is it that in each  great class some forms are far more highly developed than others?... On  our theory the continuous existence of lowly forms offers no difficulty;  for natural selection, or the survival of the fittest, does not  necessarily include progressive development, it only takes advantage of  such variations as arise and are beneficial to each creature under its  complex relations of life.... Geology tells us that some of the lowest  forms, the infusoria and rhizopods, have remained for an enormous period  in nearly their present state.\" (p. 145). \"The fact of little or no  modification having been effected since the glacial period would be of  some avail against those who believe in an innate and necessary law of  development, but is powerless against the doctrine of natural selection,  or the survival of the fittest, which implies only that variations or  individual differences of a favorable nature occasionally arise in a few  species and are then preserved.\" (p. 149)    This process of improvement under the law of natural selection includes  not only changes in the organic structure of animals, but also in their  instincts and intelligence. On entering on this part of his subject, Mr.  Darwin says, \"I would premise that I have nothing to do with the origin  of the primary mental powers, any more than I have with that of life  itself. We are concerned only with the diversities of instinct and of  other mental qualities within the same class.\" (p. 255) He shows that  even in a state of nature the instincts of animals of the same species  do in some degree vary, and that they are transmitted by inheritance. A  mastiff has imparted courage to a greyhound, and a greyhound has  transmitted to a shepherd-dog a disposition to hunt hares. Among  sporting dogs, the young of the pointer or retriever have been known to  point or to retrieve without instruction. \"If,\" he says, \"it can be  shown that instincts do vary ever so little, then I can see no  difficulty in natural selection preserving and continually accumulating  variations of instinct to any extent that was profitable. It is thus, as  I believe, that all the most complex and wonderful instincts have  arisen.\" (p. 257) He was rather unguarded in saying that he saw no  difficulty in accounting for the most wonderful instincts of animals. He  admits that he has found very great difficulty. He selects three cases  which he found it specially hard to deal with: that of the cuckoo, that  of the cell-building bee, and of the slave-making ant. He devotes much  space and labor in endeavoring to show how the instinct of the bee, for  example, in the construction of its cell, _might_ have been gradually  acquired. It is clear, however, that he was not able fully to satisfy  even his own mind; for he admits that \"it will be thought that I have an  over-weening confidence in the principle of natural selection, when I do  not admit that such wonderful and well established facts do not  annihilate the theory.\" (p. 290) This remark was made with special  reference to the instincts of the ant, which he finds very hard to  account for. He adds, \"No doubt many instincts of very difficult  explanation could be opposed to the theory of natural selection: cases  in which we cannot see how an instinct could possibly have originated;  cases in which no intermediate gradations are known to exist; cases of  instinct of such trifling importance that they could hardly have been  acted upon by natural selection; cases of instincts almost identically  the same in animals so remote in the scale of nature, that we cannot  account for their similarity by inheritance from a common progenitor,  and consequently cannot believe that they were independently acquired  through natural selection. I will not here enter on those cases, but  will confine myself to one special difficulty which at first appeared to  me insuperable, and actually fatal to the whole theory. I allude to  neuters, or sterile females in insect communities; for these neuters  often differ widely in instinct and structure from both the males and  the fertile females, and yet, from being sterile, they cannot propagate  their kind.\" (p. 289) He is candid enough to say, in conclusion, \"I do  not pretend that the facts given in this chapter (on instinct)  strengthen in any great degree my theory; but none of the cases of  difficulty, to the best of my judgment, annihilate it.\" (p. 297) When it  is remembered that his theory is, that slight variations occurring in an  individual advantageous to it (not to its associates), in the struggle  for life, is perpetuated by inheritance, it is no wonder that the case  of sterile ants gave him so much trouble. Accidental sterility is not  favorable to the individual, and its being made permanent by  inheritance, is out of the question, for the sterile have no  descendants. Yet these sterile females are not degenerations, they are  in general larger and more robust than their associates.    We have thus seen that, according to Mr. Darwin, all the infinite  variety of structure in plants and animals is due to the law of natural  selection. \"On the principle of natural selection with divergence of  character,\" he says, \"it does not seem incredible that, from some such  low and intermediate form, both animals and plants have been developed,  and if we admit this, we must likewise admit that all the organized  beings which have ever lived on this earth may be descended from some  one primordial form.\" (p. 573) We have seen also that he does not  confine his theory to organic structure, but applies it to all the  instincts and all the forms of intelligence manifested by irrational  creatures. Nor does he stop there; he includes man within the sweep of  the same law. \"In the distant future I see open fields for far more  important researches. Psychology will be based on a new foundation, that  of the _necessary_ acquirement of each mental power and capacity by  gradation. Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history.\"  (p. 577)    The \"distant future\" was near at hand. In his introduction to his work  on the \"Descent of Man,\" he says, he had determined not to publish on  that subject, \"as I thought that I should thus only add to the  prejudices against my views. It seemed to me sufficient to indicate, in  the first edition of my 'Origin of Species,' that by this work 'light  would be thrown on the origin of man and his history;' and this implies  that man must be included with other organic beings in any general  conclusion respecting his manner of appearance on this earth. Now the  case wears a wholly different aspect. When a naturalist like Carl Vogt  (we shall see in what follows what kind of a witness he is) ventures to  say in his address as President of the National Institution of Geneva  (1869), 'Personne, en Europe au moins, n'ose plus soutenir la creation  independante et de toutes pieces, des especes,'--it is manifest that at  least a large number of naturalists must admit that species are the  modified descendants of other species; and this especially holds good of  the younger and rising naturalists.... Of the older and honored chiefs  in natural science, many unfortunately are still opposed to evolution in  every form.\" Carl Vogt would not write thus. To him no man is honored  who does agree with him, and any man who believes in God he execrates.    In 1871, Mr. Darwin ventured on the publication of his \"Descent of Man.\"  In that work, he endeavors to show that the proximate progenitor of man  is the ape. He says \"there is less difference of structure between the  two, than between the higher and lower forms of apes themselves.\" Not  only so, but he attempts to show that the mental faculties of man are  derived by slight variations, long continued, from the measure of  intellect possessed by lower animals. He even says, that there is less  difference in intelligence between man and the higher mammals, than  there is between the intelligence of the ant and that of the coccus,  insects of the same class.[7]    In like manner he teaches that man's moral nature has been evolved by  slow degrees from the social instincts common to many animals. (pp. 68,  94) The moral element, thus derived, he admits might lead to very  different lines of conduct. \"If men,\" he says, \"were reared under the  same conditions as hives-bees, there can hardly be a doubt, that our  unmarried females would, like the worker-bees, think it a sacred duty to  kill all their brothers, and mothers would strive to kill their fertile  daughters; and no one would think of interfering. (vol. i. p. 70)    \"Lower animals, especially the dog, manifest love, reverence, fidelity,  and obedience; and it is from these elements that the religious  sentiment in man has been slowly evolved by "]]]
