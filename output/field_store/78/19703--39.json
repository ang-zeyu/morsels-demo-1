Peterkin did as he was directed, and we both burst into uncontrollable  laughter at the changes that instantly passed over his expressive  countenance.  No sooner had he put the nut to his mouth, and thrown back  his head in order to catch what came out of it, than his eyes opened to  twice their ordinary size with astonishment, while his throat moved  vigorously in the act of swallowing.  Then a smile and a look of intense  delight overspread his face, except, indeed, the mouth, which, being  firmly fixed to the hole in the nut, could not take part in the  expression; but he endeavoured to make up for this by winking at us  excessively with his right eye.  At length he stopped, and drawing a  long breath, exclaimed:    \"Nectar! perfect nectar!--I say, Jack, you're a Briton--the best fellow  I ever met in my life--Only taste that!\" said he, turning to me and  holding the nut to my mouth.  I immediately drank, and certainly I was  much surprised at the delightful liquid that flowed copiously down my  throat.  It was extremely cool, and had a sweet taste, mingled with  acid; in fact, it was the likest thing to lemonade I ever tasted, and  was most grateful and refreshing.  I handed the nut to Jack, who, after  tasting it, said, \"Now, Peterkin, you unbeliever!  I never saw or tasted  a cocoa-nut in my life before, except those sold in shops at home; but I  once read that the green nuts contain that stuff; and you see it is  true.\"    \"And, pray,\" asked Peterkin, \"what sort of `stuff' does the ripe nut  contain?\"    \"A hollow kernel,\" answered Jack, \"with a liquid like milk in it; but it  does not satisfy thirst so well as hunger.  It is very wholesome food, I  believe.\"    \"Meat and drink on the same tree!\" cried Peterkin; \"washing in the sea,  lodging on the ground--and all for nothing!  My dear boys, we're set up  for life!  It must be the ancient Paradise--hurrah!\" and Peterkin tossed  his straw hat in the air and ran along the beach, hallooing like a  madman with delight.    We afterwards found, however, that these lovely islands were very unlike  Paradise in many things.  But more of this in its proper place.    We had now come to the point of rocks on which the ship had struck, but  did not find a single article, although we searched carefully among the  coral rocks, which at this place jutted out so far as nearly to join the  reef that encircled the island.  Just as we were about to return,  however, we saw something black floating in a little cove that had  escaped our observation.  Running forward, we drew it from the water,  and found it to be a long, thick, leather boot, such as fishermen at  home wear; and a few paces farther on, we picked up its fellow.  We at  once recognised these as having belonged to our captain, for he had worn  them during the whole of the storm in order to guard his legs from the  waves and spray that constantly washed over our decks.  My first thought  on seeing them was that our dear captain had been drowned; but Jack soon  put my mind more at rest on that point by saying that if the captain had  been drowned with the boots on, he would certainly have been washed  ashore along with them, and that he had no doubt whatever he had kicked  them off while in the sea that he might swim more easily.    Peterkin immediately put them on; but they were so large that, as Jack  said, they would have done for boots, trousers, and vest too.  I also  tried them; but although I was long enough in the legs for them, they  were much too large in the feet for me.  So we handed them to Jack, who  was anxious to make me keep them; but as they fitted his large limbs and  feet as if they had been made for him, I would not hear of it, so he  consented at last to use them.  I may remark, however, that Jack did not  use them often, as they were extremely heavy.    It was beginning to grow dark when we returned to our encampment; so we  put off our visit to the top of a hill till next day, and employed the  light that yet remained to us in cutting down a quantity of boughs and  the broad leaves of a tree of which none of us knew the name.  With  these we erected a sort of rustic bower, in which we meant to pass the  night.  There was no absolute necessity for this, because the air of our  island was so genial and balmy that we could have slept quite well  without any shelter; but we were so little used to sleeping in the open  air that we did not quite relish the idea of lying down without any  covering over us.  Besides, our bower would shelter us from the  night-dews or rain, if any should happen to fall.  Having strewed the  floor with leaves and dry grass, we bethought ourselves of supper.    But it now occurred to us, for the first time, that we had no means of  making a fire.    \"Now, there's a fix!  What shall we do?\" said Peterkin, while we both  turned our eyes to Jack, to whom we always looked in our difficulties.  Jack seemed not a little perplexed.    \"There are flints enough, no doubt, on the beach,\" said he; \"but they  are of no use at all without a steel.  However, we must try.\"  So  saying, he went to the beach, and soon returned with two flints.  On one  of these he placed the tinder, and endeavoured to ignite it; but it was  with great difficulty that a very small spark was struck out of the  flints, and the tinder, being a bad, hard piece, would not catch.  He  then tried the bit of hoop-iron, which would not strike fire at all; and  after that the back of the axe, with no better success.  During all  these trials Peterkin sat with his hands in his pockets, gazing with a  most melancholy visage at our comrade, his face growing longer and more  miserable at each successive failure.    \"Oh dear!\" he sighed; \"I would not care a button for the cooking of our  victuals--perhaps they don't need it--but it's so dismal to eat one's  supper in the dark, and we have had such a capital day that it's a pity  to finish off in this glum style.  Oh, I have it!\" he cried, starting  up: \"the spy-glass--the big glass at the end is a burning-glass!\"    \"You forget that we have no sun,\" said I.    Peterkin was silent.  In his sudden recollection of the telescope he had  quite overlooked the absence of the sun.    \"Ah, boys, I've got it now!\" exclaimed Jack, rising and cutting a branch  from a neighbouring bush, which he stripped of its leaves.  \"I recollect  seeing this done once at home.  Hand me the bit of whip-cord.\"  With the  cord and branch Jack soon formed a bow.  Then he cut a piece about three  inches long off the end of a dead branch, which he pointed at the two  ends.  Round this he passed the cord of the bow, and placed one end  against his chest, which was protected from its point by a chip of wood;  the other point he placed against the bit of tinder, and then began to  saw vigorously with the bow, just as a blacksmith does with his drill  while boring a hole in a piece of iron.  In a few seconds the tinder  began to smoke; in less than a minute it caught fire; and in less than a  quarter of an hour we were drinking our lemonade and eating cocoa-nuts  round a fire that would have roasted an entire sheep, while the smoke,  flames, and sparks flew up among the broad leaves of the overhanging  palm-trees, and cast a warm glow upon our leafy bower.    That night the starry sky looked down through the gently rustling trees  upon our slumbers, and the distant roaring of the surf upon the coral  reef was our lullaby.        CHAPTER FIVE.    MORNING, AND COGITATIONS CONNECTED THEREWITH--WE LUXURIATE IN THE SEA,  TRY OUR DIVING POWERS, AND MAKE ENCHANTING EXCURSIONS AMONG THE CORAL  GROVES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN--THE WONDERS OF THE DEEP ENLARGED  UPON.    What a joyful thing it is to awaken on a fresh, glorious morning, and  find the rising sun staring into your face with dazzling brilliancy! to  hear the birds twittering in the bushes, and to hear the murmuring of a  rill, or the soft, hissing ripples as they fall upon the seashore!  At  any time, and in any place, such sights and sounds are most charming;  but more especially are they so when one awakens to them, for the first  time, in a novel and romantic situation, with the soft, sweet air of a  tropical climate mingling with the fresh smell of the sea, and stirring  the strange leaves that flutter overhead and around one, or ruffling the  plumage of the stranger birds that fly inquiringly around as if to  demand what business we have to intrude uninvited on their domains.  When I awoke on the morning after the shipwreck, I found myself in this  most delightful condition; and as I lay on my back upon my bed of  leaves, gazing up through the branches of the cocoa-nut trees into the  clear blue sky, and watched the few fleecy clouds that passed slowly  across it, my heart expanded more and more with an exulting gladness,  the like of which I had never felt before.  While I meditated, my  thoughts again turned to the great and kind Creator of this beautiful  world, as they had done on the previous day when I first beheld the sea  and the coral reef, with the mighty waves dashing over it into the calm  waters of the lagoon.    While thus meditating, I naturally bethought me of my Bible, for I had  faithfully kept the promise which I gave at parting to my beloved  mother--that I would read it every morning; and it was with a feeling of  dismay that I remembered I had left it in the ship.  I was much troubled  about this.  However, I consoled myself with reflecting that I could  keep the second part of my promise to her--namely, that I should never  omit to say my prayers.  So I rose quietly lest I should disturb my  companions, who were still asleep, and stepped aside into the bushes for  this purpose.    On my return I found them still slumbering, so I again lay down to think  over our situation.  Just at that moment I was attracted by the sight of  a very small parrot, which Jack afterwards told me was called"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21724"],[0,"The Handbook of Soap Manufacture (#5)"],[1,"----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Lignoceric     | C_{23}H_{47}COOH  | 80.5    | Arachis oil.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Carnaubic      | C_{23}H_{47}COOH  |  ...    | Carnauba wax.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Pisangcerylic  | C_{23}H_{47}COOH  |  ...    | Pisang wax.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Hyaenic         | C_{24}H_{49}COOH |  ...    | Hyaena fat.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Cerotic        | C_{25}H_{51}COOH  | 78      | Beeswax, China wax, spermaceti.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Melissic       | C_{29}H_{59}COOH  | 89      | Beeswax.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Psyllostearylic| C_{32}H_{65}COOH  |  ...    | Psylla wax.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Theobromic     | C_{63}H_{127}COOH |  ...    | Cacao butter  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Medullic and margaric acids, which were formerly included in this  series, have now been shown to consist of mixtures of stearic and  palmitic, and stearic palmitic and oleic acids respectively.    The acids of this group are saturated compounds, and will not combine  directly with iodine or bromine. The two first are liquid at ordinary  temperatures, distil without decomposition, and are miscible with water  in all proportions; the next four are more or less soluble in water and  distil unchanged in the presence of water, as does also lauric acid,  which is almost insoluble in cold water, and only slightly dissolved by  boiling water. The higher acids of the series are solid, and are  completely insoluble in water. All these acids are soluble in warm  alcohol, and on being heated with solid caustic alkali undergo no  change.    II. _Oleic Series:_--    --------------------------------------------------------------------------  Acid.       | Formula.          | Melting |   Found in              |                   | Point,  |              |                   |  deg.C. |  --------------------------------------------------------------------------  Tiglic      | C_{4}H_{7}COOH    | 64.5    |   Croton oil.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------  Moringic    | C_{14}H_{27}COOH  |  0      |   Ben oil.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------  Physetoleic | C_{15}H_{29}COOH  | 30      |   Sperm oil.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------  Hypogaeic    | C_{15}H_{29}COOH | 33      |   Arachis and maize oils.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------  Oleic       | C_{17}H_{33}COOH  | 14      |   Most oils and fats.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------  Rapic       | C_{17}H_{33}COOH  | ...     |   Rape oil.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------  Doeglic     | C_{18}H_{35}COOH  | ...     |   Bottle-nose oil.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------  Erucic      | C_{21}H_{41}COOH  | 34      |   Mustard oils, marine animal              |                   |         |     oils, rape oil.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------    The unsaturated nature of these acids renders their behaviour with  various reagents entirely different from that of the preceding series.  Thus, they readily combine with bromine or iodine to form addition  compounds, and the lower members of the series are at once reduced, on  treatment with sodium amalgam in alkaline solution, to the corresponding  saturated acids of Series I. Unfortunately, this reaction does not apply  to the higher acids such as oleic acid, but as the conversion of the  latter into solid acids is a matter of some technical importance from  the point of view of the candle-maker, a number of attempts have been  made to effect this by other methods.    De Wilde and Reychler have shown that by heating oleic acid with 1 per  cent. of iodine in autoclaves up to 270 deg.-280 deg. C., about 70 per cent. is  converted into stearic acid, and Zuerer has devised (German Patent  62,407) a process whereby the oleic acid is first converted by the  action of chlorine into the dichloride, which is then reduced with  nascent hydrogen. More recently Norman has secured a patent (English  Patent 1,515, 1903) for the conversion of unsaturated fatty acids of  Series II. into the saturated compounds of Series I., by reduction with  hydrogen or water-gas in the presence of finely divided nickel, cobalt  or iron. It is claimed that by this method oleic acid is completely  transformed into stearic acid, and that the melting point of tallow  fatty acids is raised thereby about 12 deg. C.    Another method which has been proposed is to run the liquid olein over  a series of electrically charged plates, which effects its reduction to  stearin.    Stearic acid is also formed by treating oleic acid with fuming hydriodic  acid in the presence of phosphorus, while other solid acids are obtained  by the action of sulphuric acid or zinc chloride on oleic acid.    Acids of Series II. may also be converted into saturated acids by  heating to 300 deg.C. with solid caustic potash, which decomposes them into  acids of the stearic series with liberation of hydrogen. This reaction,  with oleic acid, for example, is generally represented by the equation--      C_{18}H_{34}O_{2} + 2KOH = KC_{2}H_{3}O_{2} + KC_{16}H_{31}O_{2} + H_{2},    though it must be really more complex than this indicates, for, as Edmed  has pointed out, oxalic acid is also formed in considerable quantity.  The process on a commercial scale has now been abandoned.    One of the most important properties of this group of acids is the  formation of isomeric acids of higher melting point on treatment with  nitrous acid, generally termed the _elaidin reaction_. Oleic acid, for  example, acted upon by nitrous acid, yields elaidic acid, melting at  45 deg., and erucic acid gives brassic acid, melting at 60 deg.C. This reaction  also occurs with the neutral glycerides of these acids, olein being  converted into elaidin, which melts at 32 deg.C.    The lead salts of the acids of this series are much more soluble in  ether, and the lithium salts more soluble in alcohol than those of the  stearic series, upon both of which properties processes have been based  for the separation of the solid from the liquid fatty acids.

They are  unaffected by nitrous acid, and their lead salts are soluble in ether.
