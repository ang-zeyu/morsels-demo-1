She hesitated a moment, then threw open the door wider.    \"You must come in. We can talk here in the hall. Do I understand Mr. Lyne  has not sent you?\"    \"Mr. Lyne was very anxious that I should come,\" he said. \"I am betraying  his confidence, but I do not think that he has any claim upon my loyalty.  I don't know why I've bothered you at all, except that I feel that you  ought to be put on your guard.\"    \"Against what?\" she asked.    \"Against the machinations of a gentleman to whom you have been----\" he  hesitated for a word.    \"Very offensive,\" she finished for him.    \"I don't know how offensive you've been,\" he laughed, \"but I gather you  have annoyed Mr. Lyne for some reason or other, and that he is determined  to annoy you. I do not ask your confidence in this respect, because I  realise that you would hardly like to tell me. But what I want to tell  you is this, that Mr. Lyne is probably framing up a charge against  you--that is to say, inventing a charge of theft.\"    \"Of theft?\" she cried in indignant amazement. \"Against me? Of theft? It's  impossible that he could be so wicked!\"    \"It's not impossible that anybody could be wicked,\" said Tarling of the  impassive face and the laughing eyes. \"All that I know is that he even  induced Mr. Milburgh to say that complaints have been made by Milburgh  concerning thefts of money from your department.\"    \"That's absolutely impossible!\" she cried emphatically. \"Mr. Milburgh  would never say such a thing. Absolutely impossible!\"    \"Mr. Milburgh didn't want to say such a thing, I give him credit for  that,\" said Tarling slowly, and then gave the gist of the argument,  omitting any reference, direct or indirect, to the suspicion which  surrounded Milburgh.    \"So you see,\" he said in conclusion, \"that you ought to be on your guard.  I suggest to you that you see a solicitor and put the matter in his  hands. You need not move against Mr. Lyne, but it would strengthen your  position tremendously if you had already detailed the scheme to some  person in authority.\"    \"Thank you very, very much, Mr. Tarling,\" she said warmly, and looked up  into his face with a smile so sweet, so pathetic, so helpless, that  Tarling's heart melted towards her.    \"And if you don't want a solicitor,\" he said, \"you can depend upon me.  I will help you if any trouble arises.\"    \"You don't know how grateful I am to you, Mr. Tarling, I didn't receive  you very graciously!\"    \"If you will forgive my saying so, you would have been a fool to have  received me in any other way,\" he said.    She held out both hands to him: he took them, and there were tears in her  eyes. Presently she composed herself, and led him into her little  drawing-room.    \"Of course, I've lost my job,\" she laughed, \"but I've had several offers,  one of which I shall accept. I am going to have the rest of the week to  myself and to take a holiday.\"    Tarling stopped her with a gesture. His ears were superhumanly sensitive.    \"Are you expecting a visitor?\" he asked softly.    \"No,\" said the girl in surprise.    \"Do you share this flat with somebody?\"    \"I have a woman who sleeps here,\" she said. \"She is out for the evening.\"    \"Has she a key?\"    The girl shook her head.    The man rose, and Odette marvelled how one so tall could move so swiftly,  and without so much as a sound, across the uncarpeted hallway. He  reached the door, turned the knob of the patent lock and jerked it open.  A man was standing on the mat and he jumped back at the unexpectedness  of Tarling's appearance. The stranger was a cadaverous-looking man, in a  brand-new suit of clothes, evidently ready-made, but he still wore  on his face the curious yellow tinge which is the special mark of the  recently liberated gaol-bird.    \"Beg pardon,\" he stammered, \"but is this No. 87?\"    Tarling shot out a hand, and gripping him by the coat, drew the helpless  man towards him.    \"Hullo, what are you trying to do? What's this you have?\"    He wrenched something from the man's hand. It was not a key but a  flat-toothed instrument of strange construction.    \"Come in,\" said Tarling, and jerked his prisoner into the hall.    A swift turning back of his prisoner's coat pinioned him, and then with  dexterousness and in silence he proceeded to search. From two pockets he  took a dozen jewelled rings, each bearing the tiny tag of Lyne's Store.    \"Hullo!\" said Tarling sarcastically, \"are these intended as a loving gift  from Mr. Lyne to Miss Rider?\"    The man was speechless with rage. If looks could kill, Tarling would have  died.    \"A clumsy trick,\" said Tarling, shaking his head mournfully. \"Now go back  to your boss, Mr. Thornton Lyne, and tell him that I am ashamed of an  intelligent man adopting so crude a method,\" and with a kick he dismissed  Sam Stay to the outer darkness.    The girl, who had been a frightened spectator of the scene, turned her  eyes imploringly upon the detective.    \"What does it mean?\" she pleaded. \"I feel so frightened. What did that  man want?\"    \"You need not be afraid of that man, or any other man,\" said Tarling  briskly. \"I'm sorry you were scared.\"    He succeeded in calming her by the time her servant had returned and then  took his leave.    \"Remember, I have given you my telephone number and you will call me up  if there is any trouble. Particularly,\" he said emphatically, \"if there  is any trouble to-morrow.\"    But there was no trouble on the following day, though at three o'clock in  the afternoon she called him up.    \"I am going away to stay in the country,\" she said. \"I got scared last  night.\"    \"Come and see me when you get back,\" said Tarling, who had found it  difficult to dismiss the girl from his mind. \"I am going to see Lyne  to-morrow. By the way, the person who called last night is a protege of  Mr. Thornton Lyne's, a man who is devoted to him body and soul, and  he's the fellow we've got to look after. By Jove! It almost gives me an  interest in life!\"    He heard the faint laugh of the girl.    \"Must I be butchered to make a detective's holiday?\" she mocked, and he  grinned sympathetically.    \"Any way, I'll see Lyne to-morrow,\" he said.    The interview which Jack Tarling projected was destined never to take  place.    On the following morning, an early worker taking a short cut through Hyde  Park, found the body of a man lying by the side of a carriage drive. He  was fully dressed save that his coat and waistcoat had been removed.  Wound about his body was a woman's silk night-dress stained with blood.  The hands of the figure were crossed on the breast and upon them lay a  handful of daffodils.    At eleven o'clock that morning the evening newspapers burst forth with  the intelligence that the body had been identified as that of Thornton  Lyne, and that he had been shot through the heart.          CHAPTER V    FOUND IN LYNE'S POCKET      \"The London police are confronted with a new mystery, which has features  so remarkable, that it would not be an exaggeration to describe this  crime as the Murder Mystery of the Century. A well-known figure in London  Society, Mr. Thornton Lyne, head of an important commercial organisation,  a poet of no mean quality, and a millionaire renowned for his  philanthropic activities, was found dead in Hyde Park in the early hours  of this morning, in circumstances which admit of no doubt that he was  most brutally murdered.    \"At half-past five, Thomas Savage, a bricklayer's labourer employed by  the Cubitt Town Construction Company, was making his way across Hyde Park  _en route_ to his work. He had crossed the main drive which runs parallel  with the Bayswater Road, when his attention was attracted to a figure  lying on the grass near to the sidewalk. He made his way to the spot and  discovered a man, who had obviously been dead for some hours. The body  had neither coat nor waistcoat, but about the breast, on which his two  hands were laid, was a silk garment tightly wound about the body, and  obviously designed to stanch a wound on the left side above the heart.    \"The extraordinary feature is that the murderer must not only have  composed the body, but had laid upon its breast a handful of daffodils.  The police were immediately summoned and the body was removed. The police  theory is that the murder was not committed in Hyde Park, but the  unfortunate gentleman was killed elsewhere and his body conveyed to the  Park in his own motor-car, which was found abandoned a hundred yards from  the scene of the discovery. We understand that the police are working  upon a very important clue, and an arrest is imminent.\"    Mr. J. O. Tarling, late of the Shanghai Detective Service, read the short  account in the evening newspaper, and was unusually thoughtful.    Lyne murdered! It was an extraordinary coincidence that he had been  brought into touch with this young man only a few days before.    Tarling knew nothing of Lyne's private life, though from his own  knowledge of the man during his short stay in Shanghai, he guessed that  that life was not wholly blameless. He had been too busy in China to  bother his head about the vagaries of a tourist, but he remembered dimly  some sort of scandal which had attached to the visitor's name, and  puzzled his head to recall all the circumstances.    He put down the newspaper with a little grimace indicative of regret. If  he had only been attached to Scotland Yard, what a case this would have  been for him! Here was a mystery which promised unusual interest.    His mind wandered to the girl, Odette Rider. What would she think of it?  She would be shocked, he thought--horrified. It hurt him to feel that she  might be indirectly, even remotely associated with such a public scandal,  and he realised with a sudden sense of dismay that nothing was less  unlikely than that her name would be mentioned as one who had quarrelled  with the dead man.    \"Pshaw!\" he muttered,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20915"],[0,"Field's Chromatography (#5)"],[1," usual conditions of painting,  and the common circumstances to which works of art are exposed, that  entitles a colour to the character of permanency; and it is the  not-so-enduring which attaches to it rightly the opposite character of  evanescence: while a pigment may obtain a false repute for either, by  accidental preservation or destruction under unusually favourable or  fatal circumstances.    Many have imagined that colours vitrified by intense heat are  consequently durable when levigated for painting in oil or water. Had  this been the case, the artist need not have looked farther for the  furnishing of his palette than to a supply of well-burnt and levigated  enamel pigments. But though such colours for the most part stand well  when fluxed on glass, or in the glazing of enamel, they are nearly,  without exception, subject to the most serious changes when ground to  the degree of fineness necessary to their application as pigments, and  become liable to all the chemical changes and affinities of the  substances which compose them. These remarks even apply in a measure to  native products, such as coloured earths and metallic ores.    Others have not unreasonably supposed that when pigments are locked up  in varnishes and oils, they are safe from all possibility of change. The  assumption would be more warranted if we had an impenetrable  varnish--and even that would not resist the action of light, however  well it might exclude the influence of air and moisture. But, in fact,  varnishes and oils themselves yield to changes of temperature, to the  action of a humid atmosphere, and to other influences: their protection  of colour from change is therefore far from perfect.    Want of attention to the unceasing mutability of all chemical  substances, as well as to their reciprocal actions, has occasioned those  changes of colour to be ascribed to fugitiveness of the pigment, which  belong to the affinities of other substances with which it has been  improperly mixed and applied. It is thus that the best pigments have  suffered in reputation under the injudicious processes of the painter;  although, owing to a desultory practice, the effects and results have  not been uniform. If a colour be not extremely permanent, dilution will  render it in some measure more weak and fugitive; and this occurs in  several ways--by a too free use of the vehicle; by complex mixture in  the formation of tints; by distribution, in glazing or lackering, of  colours upon the lights downward, or scumbling colours upon the shades  upward; or by a mixed mode very common among the Venetian painters, in  which opaque pigments are combined, as umber and lake.    The fugitive colours do less injury in the shadows than in the lights of  a picture, because they are employed pure, and in greater body in  shadows, and are therefore less liable to decay by the action of light,  and by mixture. Through partially fading, moreover, they balance any  tendency to darken, to which the dead colouring of earthy and metallic  pigments is disposed.    The foregoing circumstances, added to the variableness of pigments by  nature, preparation, and sophistication, have often rendered their  effects equivocal, and their powers questionable. These considerations  enforce the expediency of using colours as pure and free from  unnecessary mixture as possible; for simplicity of composition and  management is equally a maxim of good mechanism, good chemistry, and  good colouring. Accordingly, in respect to the latter, Sir Joshua  Reynolds remarks, \"Two colours mixed together will not preserve the  brightness of either of them single, nor will three be as bright as two:  of this observation, simple as it is, an artist who wishes to colour  bright will know the value.\"    There prevail, notwithstanding, two principles of practice on the  palette, opposed to each other--the one, simple; the other, multiple.  The first is that of having as few pigments as possible; and consists,  when carried to the extreme, in employing the three primary colours  only. The second is that of having a number of pigments; and consists,  also when carried to the extreme, of employing as many, if possible, as  there are hues and shades of colour.    On the former plan, every tint requires to be compounded; on the latter,  one pigment supplies the place of two or more. Now, the more pigments  are mixed, the more they are deteriorated in colour, attenuated, and  chemically set at variance. Original pigments, that is, such as are not  made up of two or more colours, are purer in hue and generally more  durable than those compounded. Hence pure intermediate tints in single,  permanent, original pigments, are to be preferred to pigments  compounded, often to the dilution and injury of their colours. Cadmium  Orange, for instance, which is _naturally_ an orange pigment and not  composed of red and yellow, is superior to many mixtures of those  colours in a chemical sense, and to all such mixtures in an artistic  sense. At the same time, it is quite possible for the artist to multiply  his pigments unnecessarily. Colours are sometimes brought out under new  names which have no claim to be regarded as new colours, being, indeed,  mere mixtures. Compound pigments like these may most frequently be  dispensed with, in favour of hues and tints composed extemporaneously of  original colours upon the palette.    It may be inferred from the foregoing that, between the modes of  employing as few pigments as possible, and of having as many as there  are hues and shades of colour, a middle course is the best. But,  whatever the practice adopted, permanent _original_ pigments should be  used as often as the case will admit; it being borne in mind, that a  pigment may be compound, although its colour may be primary. As a rule,  the less colours are mixed, the purer, brighter, and more lasting they  will be found.    To the practice of producing tints and hues by _grinding_ pigments  together, instead of _blending_ them on the palette, may be attributed  some of the peculiarities of the tints and textures of the Flemish  school; they being, perhaps, results of intimate combination from  grinding, and consequently of a more powerful chemical action among the  ingredients compounded. This method has, in a great measure, fallen into  disuse, and undoubtedly it conduced to foulness when the colours of the  pigments ground were not pure and true, and did not assimilate well in  mixture chemically.    The superiority of Rubens and the Flemings, and of Titian and the  Venetian school, in colouring and effect, is due in a considerable  degree to their sketching their designs in colours experimentally with a  full palette. This practice, as derived from Reynolds, is common with  the best masters of our own school, who, in executing their works,  resort also to nature, with an improved knowledge of colours and  colouring. Such attention to colouring and effect, from the first study  and ground of a picture to the finishing, contributes a beauty to the  painting no superinduced colouring can accomplish.    The durability of colour in substances is to a great extent dependent  upon the condition in which they exist chemically. If pigments, for  example, be in a state which chemists have termed _pro_toxide, they are  liable to absorb oxygen on exposure to light, air, or moisture, and  becoming what is called _per_oxidized, may, by consequence, change or  fade. In like manner, lakes and carmines thrown down upon a base, may  owe some of their fugacity to the oxidation of that base, as well as to  the natural infirmity of their colouring matter. On the other hand,  pigments and bases are subject to _de_oxidation, or to a loss of oxygen,  in which case the colour is apt to deepen. Pigments generally are more  affected by oxidation and fading in a water vehicle, and by deoxidation  and darkening in one of oil.    A principal test of permanency in pigments is the impunity with which  they bear exposure to light and air, an artistic proof of their  stability the mere chemist is apt to neglect. Provided the colour remain  unaffected by sulphuretted hydrogen, &c., he seldom hesitates to  pronounce it safe. But a pigment may be fast in one sense and fugitive  in another, believed in by the laboratory, and found wanting by the  studio. It has happened before now that the same colour has been dubbed  durable and the reverse, by the man of science and the man of art. The  former, we take it, looks upon a pigment as a coloured substance of a  certain composition, possessing maybe an acid and a base, either, or  neither, or both of which, gases and other reagents may injure or  destroy. The latter views a colour chiefly as part and parcel of his  picture--that picture which _may_ meet with foul exhalations, but _must_  be exposed to light and air. And he too often thinks as little of the  effects of an impure atmosphere or injudicious admixture, as the chemist  considers the action of air and light.    With the exception of madder, those colours mostly affected by _light  and air_ are of organic origin, such as gallstone, Indian yellow, and  the yellow dye-wood lakes; the red and purple lakes of cochineal;  indigo; and sap green. To these may be added the semi-organic Prussian  blue; and the inorganic yellows and orange of arsenic.    The pigments liable to injury from _sulphuretted hydrogen_, &c., are  notably those obtained from lead and copper; and that treacherous  compound of iodine and mercury, known as pure scarlet.    Many colours are apt to change from the action of white _lead_ and other  lead pigments, &c., principally those which are altered by light and  air.    Many, too, cannot safely come into contact with iron, or ferruginous  pigments; especially the yellows of arsenic, the lakes of cochineal, and  the blues and greens of copper. With these an iron palette knife is best  avoided, one of ivory or horn being"]]]
