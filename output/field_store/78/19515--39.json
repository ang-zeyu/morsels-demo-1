A boatman on the river Thames, in England, once laid a wager that he and  his dog would leap from the centre arch of Westminster Bridge, and land  at Lambeth within a minute of each other. He jumped off first, and the  dog immediately followed; but as he was not in the secret, and fearing  that his master would be drowned, he seized him by the neck, and dragged  him on shore, to the great diversion of the spectators.    [Illustration: NEWFOUNDLAND DOG, SAVING A CHILD FROM DROWNING]    Some years ago, a gentleman of Queen's College, Oxford, went to pass the  Christmas vacation at his father's in the country. An uncle, a brother,  and other friends, were one day to dine together. It was fine, frosty  weather; the two young gentlemen went out for a forenoon's  recreation, and one of them took his skates with him. They were followed  by a favorite greyhound. When the friends were beginning to long for  their return, the dog came home at full speed, and by his apparent  anxiety, his laying hold of their clothes to pull them along, and all  his gestures, he convinced them that something was wrong. They followed  the greyhound, who led them to a piece of water frozen over. A hat was  seen on the ice, near which was a fresh aperture. The bodies of the  young gentlemen were soon found, but, alas! though every means were  tried, life could not be restored.    There is another story which places the sagacity of the greyhound in  still stronger light. A Scotch gentleman, who kept a greyhound and a  pointer, being fond of coursing, employed the one to find the hares, and  the other to catch them. It was, however, discovered, that when the  season was over, the dogs were in the habit of going out by themselves,  and killing hares for their own amusement. To prevent this, a large iron  ring was fastened to the pointer's neck by a leather collar, and hung  down so as to prevent the dog from running or jumping over dikes. The  animals, however, continued to stroll out to the fields together; and  one day, the gentleman suspecting that all was not right, resolved to  watch them, and, to his surprise, found that the moment they thought  they were unobserved, the greyhound took up the ring in his mouth, and  carrying it, they set off to the hills, and began to search for hares,  as usual. They were followed; and it was observed that whenever the  pointer scented the hare, the ring was dropped, and the greyhound stood  ready to pounce upon the game the moment the other drove her from her  form; but that he uniformly returned to assist his companion, after he  had caught his prey.    [Illustration: AN ENCAMPMENT OF GIPSIES.]    Some of the dogs belonging to the gipsies possess a great deal of  shrewdness. The gipsies, you know, are a very singular race of people.  They are scattered over a great portion of Europe, wandering from place  to place, and living in miserable tents, or huts. You can form a pretty  correct notion of a gipsy encampment, by the picture on another page.  Here you see the gipsy men and women, sitting and standing around a  fire, over which is a pot, evidently containing the material for their  meal. If you notice the picture carefully, you will observe, also, a  little, insignificant looking dog, who is apparently asleep, and, for  aught I know, dreaming about the exploits of the day. You will no doubt  smile, and wonder what exploits such a cur is able to perform; but I  assure you that if he is at all like some of the gipsy dogs I have heard  of, he has been taught a good many very shrewd tricks. The dogs of the  gipsies are sometimes trained to steal for their masters. The thief  enters a store with some respectably dressed man, whom the owner of the  dog will commission for the purpose, and--the man having made certain  signals to the animal--the gipsy cur, after loitering about the store,  perhaps for hours, waiting a favorable opportunity, will steal the  articles which were designated, and run away with them to his master's  tent.    I made the acquaintance of a dog at Niagara Falls, last summer, who was  an ardent admirer of the beautiful and grand in nature. The little  steamer called the \"Maid of the Mist\" makes several trips daily, from a  point some two miles down the river, to within a few rods of the Canada  Fall. I went up in this boat, one morning, and the trip afforded me one  of the finest views I had of this inimitable cataract. Among the  passengers in this boat, at the time, was the dog who was so fond of the  sublime. He walked leisurely on board, just before the hour of starting,  and during the entire excursion seemed to enjoy the scene as much as any  of the rest of the passengers. As the boat approached the American  Fall, he took his station in the bow, where he remained, completely  deluged in the spray, until the boat passed the same Fall, on its  return. This, however, is not the most remarkable part of the story. The  captain informed me that such was the daily practice of the dog. Every  morning, regularly, at the hour of starting, he makes his appearance,  though he is not owned by any one engaged in the boat, and treats  himself to this novel excursion.    There is a dog living on Staten Island, who has for some time been  acting the part of a philanthropist, on a large scale. He makes it a  great share of his business to administer to the necessities of the sick  and infirm dogs in the neighborhood. As soon as he learns that a dog is  sick, so that he is unable to take care of himself, he visits the  invalid, and nurses him; and he even goes from house to house, searching  out those who need his assistance. Frequently he brings his patient to  his own kennel, and takes care of him until he either gets well or dies.  Sometimes he has two or three sick dogs in his hospital, at the same  time. I have these facts on the authority of my friend Mr. Ranlett, the  editor of the \"Architect,\" a gentleman of unquestionable veracity, who  has seen the dog thus imitating the example of the Good Samaritan.    [Illustration: RUSSIAN SLEDGE.]    Captain Parry, an adventurous sailor, who went out from England on a  voyage of discovery in the northern seas, relates some amusing anecdotes  about the dogs among the Esquimaux Indians. These dogs are trained to  draw a vehicle called a sledge, made a little like what we call a  sleigh. In some parts of Russia many people travel in the same manner.  Here is a picture of one of the Russian sledges. It is made in very  handsome style, as you see. The greater portion of them are constructed  much more rudely. The Esquimaux Indian is famous for his feats in  driving dogs. When he wants to take a ride, he harnesses up several  pairs of these dogs, and off he goes, almost as swift as the wind. The  dogs are rather unruly, however, sometimes, and get themselves sadly  snarled together, so that the driver is obliged to go through the  harnessing process several times in the course of a drive of a few  miles. When the road is level and pretty smoothly worn, eight or ten  dogs, with a weight only of some six or seven hundred pounds attached to  them, are almost unmanageable, and will run any where they choose at the  rate of ten miles an hour.    The following anecdote we have on the authority of the Newark (N. J.)  Daily Advertiser: An officer of the army, accompanied by his dog, left  West Point on a visit to the city of Burlington, N. J., and while there,  becoming sick, wrote to his wife and family at West Point, in relation  to his indisposition. Shortly after the reception of his letter, the  family were aroused by a whining, barking and scratching, at the door of  the house, and when opened to ascertain the cause, in rushed the  faithful dog. After being caressed, and every attempt made to quiet him,  the dog, in despair at not being understood, seized a shawl in his  teeth, and, placing his paws on the lady's shoulders, deposited there  the shawl! He then placed himself before her, and, fixing his gaze  intently upon her, to attract her attention, seized her dress, and began  to drag her to the door. The lady then became alarmed, and sent for a  relative, who endeavored to allay her fears, but she prevailed upon him  to accompany her at once to her husband, and on arriving, found him  dangerously ill in Burlington. The distance traveled by the faithful  animal, and the difficulties encountered, render this exploit almost  incredible, especially as the boats could not stop at West Point, on  account of the ice, it being in the winter.    There is a dog in the city of New York, who, according to unquestionable  authority, is accustomed every day not only to bring his mistress the  morning paper, as soon as it is thrown into the front yard, but to  select the one belonging to the lady, when, as is frequently the case,  there is one lying with it belonging to another member of the family.    An unfortunate dog, living in England, in order to make sport for some  fools, had a pan tied to his tail, and was sent off on his travels  toward a village a few miles distant. He reached the place utterly  exhausted, and lay down before the steps of a tavern, eyeing most  anxiously the horrid annoyance hung behind him, but unable to move a  step further, or rid himself of the torment. Another dog, a Scotch  colly, came up at the time, and seeing the distress of his crony, laid  himself down gently beside him, and gaining his confidence by a few  caresses, proceeded to gnaw the string by which the noisy appendage was  attached to his friend's tail, and by about a quarter of an hour's  exertion, severed the cord, and started to his legs, with the pan  hanging from the string in his mouth, and after a few joyful"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18779"],[0,"Physiology and Hygiene for Secondary Schools (#5)"],[1,"unfit for supplying their needs, food and oxygen must be continually added  to this fluid, and waste materials must be continually removed. This is  not an easy task. As a matter of fact, the preparation, distribution, and  purification of the nutrient fluid requires the direct or indirect aid of  practically all parts of the body. It supplies for this reason a broad  basis for the division of labor on the part of the cells.    *Relation of the Body to its Environment.*--While life is directly  dependent upon the internal nutrient fluid, it is indirectly dependent  upon the physical surroundings of the body. Herein lies the need of the  _external_ organs--the feet and legs for moving about, the hands for  handling things, the eyes for directing movements, etc. That the great  needs of the body are supplied from its surroundings are facts of common  experience. Food, shelter, air, clothing, water, and the means of  protection are external to the body and form a part of its environment. In  making the things about him contribute to his needs, man encounters a  problem which taxes all his powers. Only by toil and hardship, \"by the  sweat of his brow,\" has he been able to wrest from his surroundings the  means of his sustenance.    *The Main Physiological Problems.*--The study of the body is thus seen to  resolve itself naturally into the consideration of two main problems:    1. _That of maintaining in the body a nutrient fluid for the cells._    2. _That of bringing the body into such relations with its surroundings as  will enable it to secure materials for the nutrient fluid and satisfy its  other needs._    The first problem is _internal_ and includes the so-called vital  processes, known as digestion, circulation, respiration, and excretion.  The second problem is _external_, as it were, and includes the work of the  external organs--the organs of motion and of locomotion and the organs of  special sense. These problems are closely related, since they are the two  divisions of the one problem of maintaining life. Neither can be  considered independently of the other. In the chapter following is taken  up the first of these problems.    *Summary.*--The individual parts, or units, that form the body organization  are known as cells. These consist of minute but definitely arranged  portions of protoplasm and are held together by the intercellular  material. They build up the body and carry on its different activities.  The tissues are groups of like cells. By certain general activities the  cells maintain their existence in the tissues and by the exercise of  certain special activities they adapt the tissues to their purposes in the  body. The body, as a cell organization, has its activities directed under  normal conditions toward a single purpose--that of maintaining life. In the  accomplishment of this purpose a nutrient fluid is provided for the cells  and proper relations between the body and its surroundings are  established.    *Exercises.*--1. If a tissue be compared to a brick wall, to what do the  separate bricks correspond? To what the mortar between the bricks?    2. Draw an outline of a typical cell, locating and naming the main  divisions.    3. How do the cells enable the body to grow? Describe the process of  cell-division.    4. How does the general work of cells differ from their special work?  Define absorption, excretion, and assimilation as applied to the cells.    5. Compare the conditions surrounding a one-celled animal, living in  water, to the conditions surrounding the cells in the body.    6. What is meant by the term \"environment\"? How does man's environment  differ from that of a fish?    7. What is the necessity for a nutrient fluid in the body?    8. Why is the maintenance of life necessarily the chief aim of all the  activities of the body?    9. State the two main problems in the study of the body.        PRACTICAL WORK      *Observations.*--1. Make some scrapings from the inside of the cheek with a  dull knife and mix these with a little water on a glass slide. Place a  cover-glass on the same and examine with a compound microscope. The large  pale cells that can be seen in this way are a variety of epithelial cells.    2. Mount in water on a glass slide some thin slices of cartilage and  examine first with a low and then with a high power of microscope.  (Suitable slices may be cut, with a sharp razor, from the cartilage found  at the end of the rib of a young animal.) Note the small groups of cells  surrounded by, and imbedded in, the intercellular material.    3. Mount and examine with the microscope thin slices of elder pith,  potato, and the stems of growing plants. Make drawings of the cells thus  observed.    4. Examine with the microscope a small piece of the freshly sloughed off  epidermis of a frog's skin. Examine it first in its natural condition, and  then after soaking for an hour or two in a solution of carmine. Make  drawings.    5. Mount on a glass slide some of the scum found on stagnant water and  examine it with a compound microscope. Note the variety and relative size  of the different things moving about. The forms most frequently seen by  such an examination are one-celled plants. Many of these have the power of  motion.    6. Examine tissues of the body, such as nervous, muscular, and glandular  tissues, which have been suitably prepared and mounted for microscopic  study, using low and high powers of the microscope. Make drawings of the  cells in the different tissues thus observed.          CHAPTER IV - THE BLOOD      Two liquids of similar nature are found in the body, known as the blood  and the lymph. These are closely related in function and together they  form the nutrient fluid referred to in the preceding chapter. The blood is  the more familiar of the two liquids, and the one which can best be  considered at this time.    *The Blood: where Found.*--The blood occupies and moves through a system of  closed tubes, known as the blood vessels. By means of these vessels the  blood is made to circulate through all parts of the body, but from them it  does not escape under normal conditions. Though provisions exist whereby  liquid materials may both enter and leave the blood stream, it is only  when the blood vessels are cut or broken that the blood, as blood, is able  to escape from its inclosures.    *Physical Properties of the Blood.*--Experiments such as those described at  the close of this chapter reveal the more important physical properties of  the blood. It may be shown to be heavier and denser than water; to have a  faint odor and a slightly salty taste; to have a bright red color when it  contains oxygen and a dark red color when oxygen is absent; and to  undergo, when exposed to certain conditions, a change called coagulation.  These properties are all accounted for through the different materials  that enter into the formation of the blood.                                     [Fig. 8]        Fig. 8--Blood corpuscles, highly magnified. _A._ Red corpuscles as they     appear in diluted blood. _B._ Arrangement of red corpuscles in rows    between which are white corpuscles, as may be seen in undiluted blood.             _C._ Red corpuscles much enlarged to show the form.      *Composition of the Blood.*--To the naked eye the blood appears as a thick  but simple liquid; but when examined with a compound microscope, it is  seen to be complex in nature, consisting of at least two distinct  portions. One of these is a clear, transparent liquid; while the other is  made up of many small, round bodies that float in the liquid. The liquid  portion of the blood is called the _plasma_; the small bodies are known as  _corpuscles_. Two varieties of corpuscles are described--the _red_  corpuscles and the _white_ corpuscles (Fig. 8). Other round particles,  smaller than the corpuscles, may also be seen under favorable conditions.  These latter are known as _blood platelets_.    *Red Corpuscles.*--The red corpuscles are classed as cells, although, as  found in the blood of man and the other mammals (Fig. 9), they have no  nuclei.(6) Each one consists of a little mass of protoplasm, called the  _stroma_, which contains a substance having a red color, known as  _hemoglobin_. The shape of the red corpuscle is that of a circular disk  with concave sides. It has a width of about 1/3200 of an inch (7.9  microns(7)) and a thickness of about 1/13000 of an inch (1.9 microns). The  red corpuscles are exceedingly numerous, there being as many as five  millions in a small drop (one cubic millimeter) of healthy blood. But the  number varies somewhat and is greatly diminished during certain forms of  disease.                                     [Fig. 9]      Fig. 9--Red corpuscles from various animals. Those from mammals are without     nuclei, while those from birds and cold-blooded animals have nuclei.      It is the _function_ of the red corpuscles to serve as _oxygen carriers_  for the cells. They take up oxygen at the lungs and release it at the  cells in the different tissues.(8) The performance of this function  depends upon the hemoglobin.    *Hemoglobin.*--This substance has the remarkable property of forming, under  certain conditions, a weak chemical union with oxygen and, when the  conditions are reversed, of separating from it. It forms about nine tenths  of the solid matter of the red corpuscles and to it is due the colors of  the blood. When united with the oxygen it forms a compound, called  _oxyhemoglobin_, which has a bright red color; the hemoglobin alone has a  dark red color. These colors are the same as those of the blood as it  takes on and gives off oxygen. The stroma, which forms only about one  tenth of the solid matter of the corpuscles, serves as a contrivance for  holding the hemoglobin. The conditions which cause the hemoglobin to unite  with oxygen in the lungs and to separate from it in the tissues, will be  considered later (Chapter"]]]
