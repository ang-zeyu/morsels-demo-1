Contact would discharge the  torpedo and bend this iron rod. This would reverse the action of the  engine and cause the torpedo vessel to return right back from whence  it came, ready to carry another torpedo.\"    Unfortunately the torpedo boat was not ready in time to go with the  ship carrying the contributions for Greece. It was stored in Mr.  Cooper's factory (he had then turned his attention to glue) and was  destroyed by the burning of the factory. It seems to have been quite a  promising affair for the time. Mr. Cooper says:    \"I experimented with it at once to see how far it could be guided. I  made a steel wire ten miles long and went down to the Narrows to test  the matter. I had steel yards fastened to one end of the wire, and to  the other end the torpedo vessel as attached. It got about six miles  away when a vessel coming into the harbor crossed the wire and broke  it. Although the experiment was not complete it showed that for at  least six miles I could guide the vessel as easily as I could guide a  horse.\"    Mr. Cooper's work as the pioneer locomotive builder in this country;  his later inventions and improvements in the manufacture of railway  iron and wrought iron beams for fireproof buildings; his application  of anthracite coal to iron puddling, and his other successes are  almost as widely known as his philanthropic efforts for the education  and advancement of the industrial classes of this city.    After all, we are not sure but the story of his long and varied and  always honorable career, told by himself, would not be worth, to young  people who have to make their way in life through many difficulties,  more even than the advantages of the noble institution which bears his  name.           *       *       *       *       *      TASTE FOR READING.--Sir John Herschel has declared that \"if he were to  pray for a taste which should stand under every variety of  circumstance and be a source of happiness and cheerfulness to him  through life, it would be a taste for reading.\" Give a man, he  affirms, that taste, and the means of gratifying it, and you cannot  fail of making him good and happy; for you bring him in contact with  the best society in all ages, with the tenderest, the bravest, and the  purest men who have adorned humanity, making him a denizen of all  nations, a contemporary of all times, and giving him a practical proof  that the world has been created for him, for his solace, and for his  enjoyment.           *       *       *       *       *      AFRICA CROSSED AGAIN.

At the meeting of the New York Academy of Sciences February 17th, the  article in the March number of _Harper's Magazine_, entitled \"Gary's  Magnetic Motor,\" was incidentally alluded to, and Prof. C. A. Seeley  made the following remarks: The article claims that Mr. Gary has made  a discovery of a neutral line or surface, at which the polarity of an  induced magnet, while moving in the field of the inducing pole, is  changed. The alleged discovery appears to be an exaggerated statement  of some curious facts, which, although not new, are not commonly  recognized. If a bar of iron be brought up, end on, near a magnetic  pole, the bar becomes an induced magnet, but an induced magnet quite  different from what our elementary treatises seem to predict. On the  first scrutiny it is a magnet without a neutral point, and only one  kind of magnetism--namely, that of the inducing pole. Moreover, the  single pole is pretty evenly distributed over the whole surface, so  that if iron filings be sprinkled on the bar they will be attracted at  all points and completely cover it. Now, if while the bar is covered  by filings it be moved away from the inducing pole, the filings will  gradually and progressively fall, beginning at the end nearest the  inducing pole and continuing to some point near the middle of the bar;  the filings at the remote end will generally be held permanently. When  the bar is carried beyond the field of the inducing pole it is simply  a weak magnet of ordinary properties--_i. e._, of two poles and a  neutral point between them.    A plausible and simple explanation of this case is that the inducing  pole holds or binds the induced magnetism of opposite name, so that it  has no external influence; the two magnetisms are related to each  other as are the positive and negative electricities of the Leyden  jar. Let the inducing pole be N.; the S. of the bar will be attracted  by it and bound, while the N. of the bar becomes abnormally free and  active. On moving the bar from the pole the bound magnetism is  released and a part becomes residual magnetism. Now when the residual  balances the free magnetism which is of opposite name, we are on  Gary's neutral line. In a restricted sense there is a change of  polarity over the half of the bar contiguous to the inducing pole; on  the other half there is no change of pole in any sense. Experiment  with a shingle nail in the place of the filings, _a la_ Gary,  bring the nail to the induced bound pole, and it may be held, except  at the neutral line. Now if one will read the magazine article with  such ideas as these he will feel pretty sure that the writer of it has  used words recklessly, that Gary has not made an original discovery,  and that the \"neutral\" line, whatever it be, has only an imagined  relation to the \"principle\" of the motor.    The Gary Motor as a perpetual motion scheme, of course, is not worthy  of serious notice from a society devoted to science. It has no  noteworthy novelty of construction or conception. Mr. Gary is  afflicted with the very old delusion of the cut-off or shield of  magnetism, which is to cost less than what comes from it. His cut-off  is a sheet of iron, which we know acts simply as an armature.           *       *       *       *       *          A NEW PHENOMENON IN STATICAL ELECTRICITY.      M. E. Duter, in a paper read before the French Academy in December,  showed that when a Leyden jar is charged with either positive or  negative electricity its internal volume increases, and that this  effect is a new phenomenon, unexplainable by either a theory of an  increase of temperature or of an electrical pressure. The experiment  was performed by means of a flask-shaped Leyden jar with a long tube  attached to its neck, and containing a liquid which served as the  inner armature. The author's attention had been called to the fact  that this phenomenon had been observed ten years ago by M. Gori.    His researches, just made public, leave no doubt of the accuracy of M.  Duter's view, that the glass of the jar really expands. According to  the theory of elasticity, the effect of an internal pressure in a  hollow sphere is in the inverse ratio of its thickness. M. Duter,  therefore, had three flasks made of the same volume, but of  thicknesses of 4 mm., 0.8 mm., and 0.5 mm. respectively. They were  filled with water and enveloped by tin foil. Each carried a capillary  thermometer tube, in which the variations of the height of liquid  served to measure the changes in volume due to electrification. He  found that these changes were imperceptible in the thick glass, very  marked in the flask of mean thickness, and rose to 30 mm. in the  thinnest. The variations in volume were very nearly in inverse ratio  of the square roots of the thicknesses.           *       *       *       *       *          A NEW ORE CRUSHER.      The accompanying engravings represent an improved ore crusher, which  is said to be very effective and economical in the use of power.    [Illustration: Fig. 1.--BROWN'S ORE CRUSHER.]    [Illustration: Fig. 2.--HORIZONTAL SECTION.]    A short vertical cast iron cylinder, A, having in one side a discharge  opening, H, contains all of the movable parts.    The upper portion of the cylinder is lined with chilled iron plates,  L, and an inclined chute, X, leads to the discharge opening, H.    A rigid shaft, B, carries the circular crusher, C, and moves in a ball  and socket joint at the upper end, and extends eccentrically through  the boss of a bevel wheel, G, at its lower end, and rests on a step  supported by a lever that may be adjusted by the screw, R. The wheel,  G, is driven by the pinion, P, on whose shaft there are a pulley and a  fly-wheel.    The double gyratory motion of the crusher, C, causes it to approach  all portions of the lining, L, crushing whatever lies between.    It is said that this machine is capable of crushing 10 tons of the  hardest ore per hour. Its weight is 6,500 lbs.--_Musee de  l'Industrie._           *       *       *       *       *          RECENT AMERICAN PATENTS.      Enos Richmond, of Troy, N.

A blow upon the knob at the top  of the plunger forces the chisel-pointed rods through holes in the  casing into the meat, the casing resting on the surface of the steak.    Messrs. A. W.

The Zuni and the Arapaho Indians have a language with a complex grammar  and copious vocabulary well adapted to the expression of the thoughts  incident to their customs and status of culture, and they have no more  difficulty in conveying their thoughts with their language by night than  Englishmen have in conversing without gaslight. An example from each of  three eminent authors has been taken to illustrate the worthlessness of  a vast body of anthropologic material to which even the best writers  resort.    Anthropology needs trained devotees with philosophic methods and keen  observation to study every tribe and nation of the globe almost _de  novo_; and from, materials thus collected a science may be established.
