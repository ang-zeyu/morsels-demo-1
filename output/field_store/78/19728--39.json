This they will readily discover, if they are heartily  willing to examine two things. First, if their nature is lively, warm  and violent, (I speak not of stupid tempers) they will find, from time  to time, that they make slips, in which trouble and emotion have some  share. Even then they are useful to humble and annihilate them. (But  when annihilation is perfected all passion is gone--it is incompatible  with this state.) They will find that there often arises in them  certain motions of anger, but the sweetness of grace holds them back.  They would easily transgress, if in any wise they gave way to these  motions. There are persons who think themselves very mild because  nothing thwarts them. It is not of such that I am speaking. Mildness  which has never been put to the proof, is often only counterfeit. Those  persons who, when unmolested, appear to be saints are no sooner  exercised by vexing occurrences than there starts up in them a strange  number of faults. They had thought them dead which only lay dormant  because nothing awakened them.    I followed my religious exercises. I shut myself up all day to read and  pray. I gave all I had to the poor taking even linen to their houses. I  taught them the catechism and when my parents dined out I made them eat  with me and served them with great respect. I read the works of St.  Francis de Sales and the life of Madam de Chantal. There I first  learned what mental prayer was, and I besought my confessor to teach me  that kind of prayer. As he did not, I used my own endeavors to practice  it, though without success, as I then thought, because I could not  exercise the imagination, I persuaded myself, that that prayer could  not be made without forming to one's self certain ideas and reasoning  much. This difficulty gave me no small trouble, for a long time. I was  very assiduous and prayed earnestly to God to give me the gift of  prayer. All that I saw in the life of M. de Chantal charmed me. I was  so much a child, that I thought I ought to do everything I saw in it.  All the vows she had made I made also. One day as I was reading that  she had put the name of Jesus on her heart, to follow the counsel, \"Set  me as a seal upon thy heart.\" For this purpose she had taken a hot  iron, whereupon the holy name was engraven. I was very much afflicted  that I could not do the same. I decided to write that sacred and  adorable name, in large characters, on paper, then with ribbons and a  needle I fastened it to my skin in four places. In that position it  continued a long time.    After this, I turned all my thoughts to become a nun. Because the love  which I had for St. Francis de Sales did not permit me to think of any  other community than the one of which he was the founder, I frequently  went to beg the nuns there to receive me into their convent. Often I  stole out of my father's house to go and repeatedly solicit my  admission there. Though it was what they eagerly desired, even as a  temporal advantage, yet they never dared let me enter, as they very  much feared my father, to whose fondness for me they were no strangers.    There was at that house a niece of my father's, to whom I am under  great obligations. Fortune had not been very favorable to her father.  It had reduced her in some measure to depend on mine, to whom she made  known my desire. Although he would not for anything in the world have  hindered a right vocation, yet he could not hear of my design without  shedding tears. As he happened at this time to be abroad, my cousin  went to my confessor, to desire him to forbid my going to the  visitation. He dared not, however, do it plainly, for fear of drawing  on himself the resentment of that community. I still wanted to be a  nun, and importuned my mother excessively to take me to that house. She  would not do it, for fear of grieving my father, who was absent.          CHAPTER 5      No sooner was my father returned home, than he became violently ill. My  mother was at the same time indisposed in another part of the house. I  was all alone with him, ready to render him every kind of service I was  capable of, and to give him all the dutiful marks of a most sincere  affection. I do not doubt but my assiduity was very agreeable to him. I  performed the most menial offices unperceived by him taking the time  for it when the servants were not at hand; as well to mortify myself as  to pay due honor to what Jesus Christ said, that He came not to be  ministered to, but to minister. When father made me read to him, I read  with such heartfelt devotion that he was surprised. I remembered the  instruction my sister had given me, and the ejaculatory prayers and  praises I had learned.    She had taught me to praise Thee, O my God, in all Thy works. All that  I saw called upon me to render Thee homage. If it rained, I wished  every drop to be changed into love and praises. My heart was nourished  insensibly with Thy love; and my spirit was incessantly engrossed with  the remembrance of Thee. I seemed to join and partake in all the good  that was done in the world, and could have wished to have the united  hearts of all men to love Thee. This habit rooted itself so strongly in  me, that I retained it throughout my greatest wanderings.    My cousin helped not a little, to support me in these good sentiments;  I was often with her, and loved her, as she took great care of me, and  treated me with much gentleness. Her fortune being equal neither to her  birth nor her virtue, she did with charity and affection what her  condition obliged her to do. My mother grew jealous, fearing I should  love my cousin too well and herself too little. She who had left me in  my young years to the care of her maids, and since that to my own, only  requiring if I was in the house. Troubling herself no further, now  required me always to stay with her, and never suffered me to be with  my cousin but with great reluctance. My cousin fell ill. My mother took  that occasion to send her home, which was a very severe stroke to my  heart, as well as to that grace which began to dawn in me.    My mother was a very virtuous woman. She was one of the most charitable  women of her age. She not only gave the surplus, but even the  necessities of the house. Never were the needy neglected. Never any  wretched one came to her without succor. She furnished poor mechanics  wherewith to carry on their work, and needy tradesmen wherewith to  supply their shops. From her, I think, I inherited my charity and love  for the poor. God favored me with the blessing of being her successor  in that holy exercise. There was not one in the town, or its environs,  who did not praise her for this virtue. She sometimes gave to the last  penny in the house, though she had a large family to maintain, and yet  she did not fail in her faith.    My mother's only care about me had been all along to have me in the  house, which indeed is one material point for a girl. This habit of  being so constantly kept within, proved of great service after my  marriage. It would have been better had she kept me more in her own  apartment, with an agreeable freedom and inquired oftener what part of  the house I was in.    After my cousin left me, God granted me the grace to forgive injuries  with such readiness, that my confessor was surprised. He knew that some  young ladies had, out of envy, traduced me and that I spoke well of  them as occasion offered. I was seized with an ague, which lasted four  months, in which I suffered much. During that time, I was enabled to  suffer with much resignation and patience. In this frame of mind and  manner of life I persevered, so long as I continued the practice of  mental prayer.    Later we went to pass some days in the country. My father took along  with us one of his relations, a very accomplished young gentleman. He  had a great desire to marry me; but my father, resolved not to give me  to any near kinsman on account of the difficulty obtaining  dispensations, put him off, without alleging any false or frivolous  reasons for it. As this young gentleman was very devout, and every day  said the office of the Virgin, I said it with him. To have time for it,  I left off prayer which was to me the first inlet of evils. Yet, I kept  up for a long time some share of the spirit of piety; for I went to  seek out the little shepherdesses, to instruct them in their religious  duties. This spirit gradually decayed, not being nourished by prayer. I  became cold toward God. All my old faults revived to which I added an  excessive vanity. The love I began to have for myself extinguished what  remained in me of the love of God.    I did not wholly leave off mental prayer, without asking my confessor's  leave. I told him I thought it better to say the office of the Virgin  every day than to practice prayer; I had not time for both. I saw not  that this was a stratagem of the enemy to draw me from God, to entangle  me in the snares he had laid for me. I had time sufficient for both, as  I had no other occupation than what I prescribed to myself. My  confessor was easy in the matter. Not being a man of prayer he gave his  consent to my great hurt.    Oh, my God, if the value of prayer were but known, the great advantage  which accrues to the soul from conversing with Thee, and what  consequence it is of to salvation, everyone would be assiduous in it.  It is a stronghold into which the enemy cannot enter. He may attack it,  besiege it, make a noise about its walls; but while we are faithful and  hold our station, he cannot hurt us. It is alike requisite to dictate  to children the necessity of prayer as of their salvation. Alas!  unhappily, it is thought sufficient to tell them that there is a Heaven  and a Hell; that they must endeavor to avoid the latter and attain the  former; yet they are not taught the shortest and easiest way of  arriving at it."]]]
