[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20729"],[0,"At the Point of the Bayonet: A Tale of the Mahratta War (#5)"],[1,"Puntojee, had  been living quietly on the farm of Ramdass; and no suspicion  whatever had been excited in the minds of the neighbours, or of any  of the people of Jooneer, that he was aught but what he seemed--the  son of Soyera. Once a week he was re-stained; and even his  playmates, the two sons of Ramdass, believed that he was, like  themselves, a young Mahratta. They knew that, sometimes, their aunt  talked to the child for hours in a strange language; but she led  them to believe it was the dialect of Bombay, which she thought it  might be useful for him to learn.    The child was shrewd and intelligent, and strictly obeyed Soyera's  instructions never, on any account, to talk in that language with  her except when they were alone; for she said that, if he did so,  some great misfortune would happen to him.    Thus, at six, he was able to speak English and Mahratta with equal  facility. As soon as his hair began to grow, it had also been dyed;  for its colour was fair, and would at once have excited attention.  He was a sturdy boy, and had never known a day's illness.    Four more years passed, and Soyera then revealed to him the fact  that she was not, as he supposed, his mother, but that he was of  English parents; and related to him the manner in which they had  come by their death, and how she had saved him.    \"The language which you are speaking,\" she said, \"is English. I  spoke truly, when I said it was the language in use in Bombay; for  it is the tongue of the white men there. Now you will understand  why I wanted you not to speak in it, to anyone but myself; and why  I have stained your skin, once a week. At present we are at peace  with the English; but there may be war again, at any time, and in  that case were it known that you are white, your life would not be  safe for a moment; or you might be thrown into some dungeon, where  you would perish miserably.\"    She then explained to him why she had not attempted to take him  down to Bombay, and restore him to his countrymen. She had always  hoped the time would come when she could do so but, until he grew  up to manhood, it was necessary that he should stay with her; for,  being without friends in Bombay he would, as a boy, be unable to  earn his living.    The boy was greatly affected at the news. There were things that he  had never been able to understand; especially why Soyera should  consider it necessary to wash him with dye so often, when neither  his cousins nor the other children of his acquaintance were so  treated--as far as he knew, for as he had been strictly charged  never to speak of the process, which he considered an infliction,  he had never asked questions of others. He had never, therefore,  for a moment suspected that he was not like those around him. He  knew that he was stronger than other boys of his own age; more fond  of exercise, and leader in all their games; but he had accepted  this as a natural accident. The fact that he belonged to the race  that were masters of southern India, and had conquered and slain  the Nabob of Bengal, was a gratification to him but, at present,  the thought that he might some day have to join them, and leave all  those he loved behind, far overpowered this feeling.    \"I shall never become English, if you do not go with me,\" he said.  \"You saved my life, and have been a mother to me. Why should I go  away from your side, to people that I know nothing of, whose ways  would be all strange to me?\"    \"It is right that you should do so, Puntojee--I will not call you  by your proper name, Harry Lindsay, lest it should slip out before  others. Your life should be spent among your own people; who, I  think, will some day rule over all India. They are a great people,  with learning of many things unknown here, from whom I always  received the greatest kindness. They are not, like the Mahrattas,  always quarrelling among themselves; they are not deceitful, and  they are honourable. You should be proud to belong to them, and I  have no doubt some day you will be so; though at present it is  natural that, knowing no place but this, you should not like the  thought of leaving.\"    Harry Lindsay, whose spirits had hitherto been almost  inexhaustible, and who had never been happy when sitting quiet, was  greatly impressed with what he had heard and, for some time, he  withdrew himself almost entirely from the sports of his friends,  hiding himself in the groves from their importunities, and thinking  over the strange position in which he was placed.    Soyera at last remonstrated with him.    \"If I had thought you would take this matter to heart, Puntojee, I  should not have told you about it. I did so because I thought you  could scarcely be stained, much longer, without demanding the  reason for what must have seemed so strange a thing.    \"I do not want you to withdraw yourself from your playmates, or to  cease from your games. Your doing so will, if it continues, excite  talk. Your friends will think that a spell has fallen upon you, and  will shun you. I want you to grow up such as your father  was--strong and brave, and skilful in arms--and to do this you must  be alert and active. It may well be that you should not join your  countrymen until you are able to play the part of a man, which will  not be for ten years yet; but you know that my cousin Sufder has  promised that, as soon as you are able to carry arms, he will  procure a post for you under Scindia.    \"There you will learn much, and see something of the world whereas,  if you remain here, you would grow up like other cultivators, and  would make but a bad impression among your countrymen, when you  join them. Sufder himself has promised to teach you the use of arms  and, as all say he is very skilful, you could have no better  master.    \"At any rate, I wish you to resume your former habits, to exercise  your body in every way, so that you may grow up so strong and  active that, when you join your countrymen, they will feel you are  well worthy of them. They think much of such things, and it is by  their love for exercise and sport that they so harden their frames  that, in battle, our bravest peoples cannot stand against them.\"    \"But the Mahrattas are strong, mother?\"    \"Yes, they can stand great fatigues; living, as they do, so  constantly on horseback but, like all the people of India, they are  not fond of exercise, save when at war. That is the difference  between us and the English. These will get up at daybreak, go for  long rides, hunt the wild boar or the tigers in the jungles of the  Concan, or the bears among the Ghauts. Exercise to them is a  pleasure; and we in the service of the English have often wondered  at the way in which they willingly endure fatigues, when they might  pass their time sitting quietly in their verandahs. But I came to  understand that it was to this love of theirs, for outdoor  exercise, that they owed their strength and the firmness of their  courage. None can say that the Mahrattas are not brave but,  although they will charge gallantly, they soon disperse if the day  goes against them.    \"So also with the soldiers of Tippoo. They overran Arcot and  threatened Madras; Tanjore and the Carnatic were all in their  hands; and yet the English never lost their firmness and, little by  little, drove Tippoo's troops from the lands they had conquered;  and it may be that, ere long, Tippoo will be a fugitive, and his  dominions divided among those whom he has provoked.    \"Is it not wonderful that, while not very many years ago the Whites  were merely a handful, living on sufferance in Calcutta, Madras,  and Bombay, they are now masters of southern India and half of  Bengal; and even venture to engage a great empire like that of the  Mahrattas, stretching from the sea on the west to Delhi, and  holding the mastery over all central India? There must be something  extraordinary about these men. Why, you would scarce believe it,  but I have seen often, and wondered always; when they have an  entertainment, instead of sitting quietly 'and having dancing girls  to posture for their amusement, they dance themselves with their  women--not a mere movement of the body and hands, such as you see  among our dancers, but violent dancing, exhausting themselves till  the perspiration streams from their faces--and this both men and  women regard as amusement; so, Puntojee, if you are to take your  place among your countrymen again, you must accustom yourself to  fatigues, and strengthen your body in every way; or you will be  regarded with contempt as one who, although of their blood, has  grown degenerate and unworthy of them.\"    \"I will do so,\" the boy said. \"You shall not complain of me, again.  Hitherto I have played for amusement, and because I liked to  exercise my limbs, and to show the others that I could run faster  and was stronger than they were; but in future I shall have a  motive in doing so, and will strive to be worthy of my father.\"    From that time, Harry Lindsay devoted himself to exercises. He  learnt from Sufder, when he visited his native town, and from old  soldiers, when he was away, to use a sword and dagger, to hurl a  light spear accurately, to shoot straight with a musket, that  Sufder had picked up on the field of battle at Karlee, and also  with the pistol. He rose at daybreak, and walked for miles before  coming in to his morning meal; and exercised the muscles of his  arms, not only by the use of the sword, but by holding heavy stones  at arm's length.    Soyera, although still retaining her own religion, had carefully  instructed him in that of the English; with which she had, during  her service, become fully acquainted.    \"I am only a servant, an ignorant woman, and it is not for me to  decide which religion is the best, and I have never thought of  giving up that of my people; but the religion of the Christians is  much simpler than ours. They believe in one God, only; and in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20730"],[0,"For the Sake of the School (#5)"],[1,"would have noticed that if any  loud tone or undue hilarity made itself heard, it was instantly and  firmly repressed by one or two who seemed in authority. That the meeting  was more in the nature of a convention than a mere pleasure-gathering  was evident both from the demeanour of the assemblage and from the  various badges pinned on the girls' coats. No teacher was present, but  there was an air of general expectancy, as if the coming of somebody  were awaited. To the pupils at The Woodlands this night's ceremony was a  very special occasion, for it was the autumn reunion of the Camp-fire  League, an organization which, originally of American birth, had been  introduced at the instigation of Miss Teddington, and had taken great  root in the school. Any girl was eligible as a candidate, but before she  could gain admission to even the initial rank she had to prove herself  worthy of the honour of membership, and pass successfully through her  novitiate.    The organizer and leader of the branch which to-night was to celebrate  its third anniversary was a certain Mrs. Arnold, a charming young  American lady who lived in the neighbourhood. She had been an  enthusiastic supporter of the League in Pennsylvania before her  marriage, and was delighted to pass on its traditions to British  schoolgirls. Her winsome personality made her a prime favourite at The  Woodlands, where her influence was stronger even than she imagined. Miss  Teddington, though it was she who had asked Mrs. Arnold to institute and  take charge of the meetings, had the discretion to keep out of the  League herself, realizing that the presence of teachers might be a  restraint, and that the management was better left in the hands of a  trustworthy outsider.    To become an authorized Camp-fire member was an ambition with most of  the girls, and spurred many on to greater efforts than they would  otherwise have attempted. All looked forward to the meetings, and there  could be no greater punishment for certain offences than a temporary  withdrawal of League privileges.    This September, after the long summer holiday, the reunion seemed of  even more than ordinary importance.    The sun had set, the last gleam of the afterglow had faded, and the  glade had grown full of dim shadows by the time everybody was present in  the grove. The gentle rustle of the leafy boughs overhead, and the  persistent tumbling rush of the stream, seemed like a faint orchestral  accompaniment of Nature for the ceremonial.    \"Is it a Quakers' Meeting or a Freemasons' Lodge? You're all very mum,\"  asked Rona, whom curiosity had led out with the others.    \"Sh-sh! We're waiting for our 'Guardian of the Fire',\" returned Ulyth,  trying to suppress the loudness of the high-pitched voice. \"Mrs.  Arnold's generally very punctual. Oh, there! I believe I hear her  ringing her bicycle bell now. I'm going down the field to meet her.\"    Ulyth regarded Mrs. Arnold with that intense adoration which a girl of  fifteen often bestows on a woman older than herself. She ran now through  the wood, hoping she might be in time to catch her idol on the drive and  have just a few precious moments with her before she was joined by the  others. There were many things she wanted to pour into her friend's  ready ears, but she knew it would be impossible to monopolize her as  soon as the rest of the girls knew of her arrival. She fled as on wings,  therefore, and had the supreme satisfaction of being the first in the  field. Mrs. Arnold, young, very fair, graceful, and golden-haired,  looked a picture in her blue cycling costume as she leaned her machine  against a tree and greeted her enthusiastic admirer.    \"Oh, you darling! I've such heaps to tell you!\" began Ulyth, clasping  her tightly by the arm. \"Rona Mitchell has come, and she's the most  awful creature! I never was so disappointed in my life. Don't you  sympathize with me, when I expected her to be so ripping? She's absolute  backwoods!\"    \"Yes, I've heard all about her. Poor child! She must have had a strange  training. It's time indeed she began to learn something.\"    \"She's not learned anything in New Zealand. Oh, her voice will just  grate on you! And her manners! She's hopeless! Everything she does and  says is wrong. And to think she's been foisted on to me, of all people!\"    \"Poor child!\" repeated Mrs. Arnold. (\"Which of us does she mean?\"  thought Ulyth.) \"She's evidently raw material. Every diamond needs  polishing. What an opportunity for a Torch-bearer!\"    Ulyth dropped her friend's arm suddenly. It was not at all the answer  she had expected. Moreover, at least a dozen girls had come running up  and were claiming their chief's attention. In a species of triumphant  procession Mrs. Arnold was escorted into the glade and installed on her  throne of state, a seat made of logs and decorated with ferns. Everyone  clustered round to welcome her, and for the moment she was the centre of  an enthusiastic crowd. Ulyth followed more slowly. She was feeling  disturbed and put out. What did Mrs. Arnold mean? Surely not----? A  sudden thought had flashed into her mind but she thrust it away  indignantly. Oh no, that was quite impossible! It was outrageous of  anybody to make the suggestion. And yet--and yet--the uneasy voice that  had been haunting her for the last four days began to speak with even  more vehemence. With a sigh of relief she heard the signal given for  \"Attention\", and cast the matter away from her for the moment. Every eye  was fixed on their leader. The ceremony was about to begin.    Mrs. Arnold rose, and in her clear, sweet voice proclaimed:    \"The Guardian of the Fire calls on the Wood-gatherers to bring their  fuel.\"    At once a dozen girls came forward, each dragging a tolerably large  bundle of brushwood. They deposited these in a circle, saluted, and  retired.    \"Fire-makers, do your work!\" commanded the leader.    Eight girls responded, Ulyth among the number, and seizing the  brushwood, they built it deftly into a pile. All stood round, waiting in  silence while their chief struck a match and applied a light to some  dried leaves and bracken that had been placed beneath. The flame rose up  like a scarlet ribbon, and in a few moments the dry fuel was ablaze and  crackling. The gleam lighting up the glade displayed a picturesque  scene. The boles of the trees might have been the pillars in some  ancient temple, with the branches for roof. Close by the cascade of the  stream leapt white against a background of dim darkness. The harvest  moon, full and golden, was rising behind the crest of Cwm Dinas. An owl  flew hooting from the wood higher up the glen. Mrs. Arnold stood waiting  until the bonfire was well alight, then she turned to the expectant  girls.    \"I've no need to tell most of you why we have met here to-night; but for  the benefit of a few who are new-comers to The Woodlands I should like  briefly to explain the objects of the Camp-fire League. The purpose of  the organization is to show that the common things of daily life are the  chief means of beauty, romance, and adventure, to cultivate the outdoor  habit, and to help girls to serve the community--the larger home--as  well as the individual home. In these ultra-modern times we must  especially devote ourselves to the service of the country, and try by  every means in our power to make our League of some national use. First  let us repeat together the rules of the Camp-fire League:        \"'1. Seek beauty.        2. Give service.        3. Pursue knowledge.        4. Be trustworthy.        5. Hold on to health.        6. Glorify work.        7. Be happy.'    \"Seeking beauty includes more than looking for superficial adornment.  Beauty is in all life, in Nature, in people, in the love of one's heart,  in virtue and a radiant disposition. The value of service depends  largely upon the attitude of mind of the one rendering it. Joy in the  performance of some needed service in behalf of parent, teacher,  friend, or country constitutes a part of the very essence of goodness,  and multiplies the good already abiding in the heart. This is the third  anniversary of the founding of a branch of the League at The Woodlands.  So far the work has been very encouraging, and I am glad to say that  to-night we have candidates eligible for all three ranks. It shall now  be the business of the meeting formally to admit them. Candidates for  Wood-gatherers, present yourselves!\"    Six of the younger girls came forward and saluted.    \"Can you repeat, and will you promise to obey, the seven rules of the  Camp-fire law?\"    Each responded audibly in the affirmative.    \"Then you are admitted to the initial rank of Wood-gatherers, you are  awarded the white badge of service, and may sign your names as accepted  members of the League.\"    The six retired to make way for a higher grade, and eight other girls  stepped into the firelight.    \"Candidates for Fire-makers, you have passed three months with good  characters as Wood-gatherers, and you have proved your ability to render  first aid, keep accounts, tie knots, and prepare and serve a simple  meal; you have each committed to memory some good poem, and have  acquainted yourself with the career of some able, public-spirited woman.  Having thus shown your wish to serve the community, repeat the  Fire-maker's desire.\"    And all together the eight girls chanted:        \"As fuel is brought to the fire       So I purpose to bring       My strength,       My ambition,       My heart's desire,       My joy,       And my sorrow       To the fire       Of human kind.       For I will tend       As my fathers have tended       And my fathers' fathers       Since time began,       The fire that is called       The love of man for man,       The love of man for God.\"    Mrs. Arnold said a few kind words to each as she pinned on their red  badges.
