Two petitions for the abolition of slavery and the slave-trade were  presented February 11 and 12, 1790, to the very first Congress convened  under the Constitution.[3] After full discussion in the House of  Representatives, it was determined, with regard to the first-mentioned  subject, \"that Congress have no authority to interfere in the  emancipation of slaves, or in the treatment of them within any of the  States\"; and, with regard to the other, that no authority existed to  prohibit the migration or importation of such persons as the States  might think proper to admit--\"prior to the year 1808.\" So distinct and  final was this statement of the limitations of the authority of Congress  considered to be that, when a similar petition was presented two or  three years afterward, the Clerk of the House was instructed to return  it to the petitioner.[4]    In 1807, Congress, availing itself of the very earliest moment at which  the constitutional restriction ceased to be operative, passed an act  prohibiting the importation of slaves into any part of the United States  from and after the first day of January, 1808. This act was passed with  great unanimity. In the House of Representatives there were one hundred  and thirteen (113) yeas to five (5) nays; and it is a significant fact,  as showing the absence of any sectional division of sentiment at that  period, that the five dissentients were divided as equally as possible  between the two sections: two of them were from Northern and three from  Southern States.[5]    The slave-trade had thus been finally abolished some months before the  birth of the author of these pages, and has never since had legal  existence in any of the United States. The question of the maintenance  or extinction of the system of negro servitude, already existing in any  State, was one exclusively belonging to such State. It is obvious,  therefore, that no subsequent question, legitimately arising in Federal  legislation, could properly have any reference to the merits or the  policy of the institution itself. A few zealots in the North afterward  created much agitation by demands for the abolition of slavery within  the States by Federal intervention, and by their activity and  perseverance finally became a recognized party, which, holding the  balance of power between the two contending organizations in that  section, gradually obtained the control of one, and to no small degree  corrupted the other. The dominant idea, however, at least of the  absorbed party, was sectional aggrandizement, looking to absolute  control, and theirs is the responsibility for the war that resulted.    No moral nor sentimental considerations were really involved in either  the earlier or later controversies which so long agitated and finally  ruptured the Union. They were simply struggles between different  sections, with diverse institutions and interests.    It is absolutely requisite, in order to a right understanding of the  history of the country, to bear these truths clearly in mind. The  phraseology of the period referred to will otherwise be essentially  deceptive. The antithetical employment of such terms as _freedom_ and  _slavery_, or \"anti-slavery\" and \"pro-slavery,\" with reference to the  principles and purposes of contending parties or rival sections, has had  immense influence in misleading the opinions and sympathies of the  world. The idea of freedom is captivating, that of slavery repellent to  the moral sense of mankind in general. It is easy, therefore, to  understand the effect of applying the one set of terms to one party, the  other to another, in a contest which had no just application whatever to  the essential merits of freedom or slavery. Southern statesmen may  perhaps have been too indifferent to this consideration--in their ardent  pursuit of principles, overlooking the effects of phrases.    This is especially true with regard to that familiar but most fallacious  expression, \"the extension of slavery.\" To the reader unfamiliar with  the subject, or viewing it only on the surface, it would perhaps never  occur that, as used in the great controversies respecting the  Territories of the United States, it does not, never did, and never  could, imply the addition of a single slave to the number already  existing. The question was merely whether the slaveholder should be  permitted to go, with his slaves, into territory (the common property of  all) into which the non-slaveholder could go with _his_ property of any  sort. There was no proposal nor desire on the part of the Southern  States to reopen the slave-trade, which they had been foremost in  suppressing, or to add to the number of slaves. It was a question of the  distribution, or dispersion, of the slaves, rather than of the  \"extension of slavery.\" Removal is not extension. Indeed, if  emancipation was the end to be desired, the dispersion of the negroes  over a wider area among additional Territories, eventually to become  States, and in climates unfavorable to slave-labor, instead of  hindering, would have promoted this object by diminishing the  difficulties in the way of ultimate emancipation.    The distinction here defined between the distribution, or dispersion, of  slaves and the extension of slavery--two things altogether different,  although so generally confounded--was early and clearly drawn under  circumstances and in a connection which justify a fuller notice.    Virginia, it is well known, in the year 1784, ceded to the United  States--then united only by the original Articles of Confederation--her  vast possessions northwest of the Ohio, from which the great States of  Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin, and part of Minnesota,  have since been formed. In 1787--before the adoption of the Federal  Constitution--the celebrated \"Ordinance\" for the government of this  Northwestern Territory was adopted by the Congress, with the full  consent, and indeed at the express instance, of Virginia. This Ordinance  included six definite \"Articles of compact between the original States  and the people and States in the said Territory,\" which were to \"for  ever remain unalterable unless by common consent.\" The sixth of these  articles ordains that \"there shall be neither slavery nor involuntary  servitude in the said Territory, otherwise than in the punishment of  crimes whereof the party shall have been duly convicted.\"    In December, 1805, a petition of the Legislative Council and House of  Representatives of the Indiana Territory--then comprising all the area  now occupied by the States of Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and  Wisconsin--was presented to Congress. It appears from the proceedings of  the House of Representatives that several petitions of the same purport  from inhabitants of the Territory, accompanied by a letter from William  Henry Harrison, the Governor (afterward President of the United States),  had been under consideration nearly two years earlier. The prayer of  these petitions was for a _suspension_ of the sixth article of the  Ordinance, so as to permit the introduction of slaves into the  Territory. The whole subject was referred to a select committee of seven  members, consisting of representatives from Virginia, Ohio,  Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Kentucky, and New York, and the delegate  from the Indiana Territory.    On the 14th of the ensuing February (1806), this committee made a report  favorable to the prayer of the petitioners, and recommending a  suspension of the prohibitory article for ten years. In their report the  committee, after stating their opinion that a qualified suspension of  the article in question would be beneficial to the people of the Indiana  Territory, proceeded to say:        \"The suspension of this article is an object almost universally      desired in that Territory. It appears to your committee to be a      question entirely different from that between slavery and      freedom, inasmuch as it would merely occasion the removal of      persons, already slaves, from one part of the country to      another. The good effects of this suspension, in the present      instance, would be to accelerate the population of that      Territory, hitherto retarded by the operation of that article of      compact; as slaveholders emigrating into the Western country      might then indulge any preference which they might feel for a      settlement in the Indiana Territory, instead of seeking, as they      are now compelled to do, settlements in other States or      countries permitting the introduction of slaves. The condition      of the slaves themselves would be much ameliorated by it, as it      is evident, from experience, that the more they are separated      and diffused the more care and attention are bestowed on them by      their masters, each proprietor having it in his power to      increase their comforts and conveniences in proportion to the      smallness of their numbers.\"    These were the dispassionate utterances of representatives of every part  of the Union--men contemporary with the origin of the Constitution,  speaking before any sectional division had arisen in connection with the  subject. It is remarkable that the very same opinions which they express  and arguments which they adduce had, fifty years afterward, come to be  denounced and repudiated by one half of the Union as partisan and  sectional when propounded by the other half.    No final action seems to have been taken on the subject before the  adjournment of Congress, but it was brought forward at the next session  in a more imposing form. On the 20th of January, 1807, the Speaker laid  before the House of Representatives a letter from Governor Harrison,  inclosing certain resolutions formally and _unanimously_ adopted by the  Legislative Council and House of Representatives of the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19846"],[0,"Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th Edition, \"Bulgaria\" to \"Calgary\" (#5)"],[1," their original population and  sheltered large numbers of the fugitives. The passage of the Turkish armies  during the wars with Austria, Poland and Russia led to further Bulgarian  emigrations. The flight to the Banat, where 22,000 Bulgarians still remain,  took place in 1730. At the beginning of the 19th century the majority of  the population of the Eastern Rumelian plain was Turkish. The Turkish  colony, however, declined, partly in consequence of the drain caused by  military service, while the Bulgarian remnant increased, notwithstanding a  considerable emigration to Bessarabia before and after the Russo-Turkish  campaign of 1828. Efforts were made by the Porte to strengthen the Moslem  element by planting colonies of Tatars in 1861 and Circassians in 1864. The  advance of the Russian army in 1877-1878 caused an enormous exodus of the  Turkish population, of which only a small proportion returned to settle  permanently. The emigration continued after the conclusion of peace, and is  still in progress, notwithstanding the efforts of the Bulgarian government  to arrest it. In twenty years (1879-1899), at least 150,000 Turkish  peasants left Bulgaria. Much of the land thus abandoned still remains  unoccupied. On the other hand, a considerable influx of Bulgarians from  Macedonia, the vilayet of Adrianople, Bessarabia, and the Dobrudja took  place within the same period, and the inhabitants of the mountain villages  show a tendency to migrate into the richer districts of the plains.    The northern slopes of the Balkans from Belogradchik to Elena are inhabited  almost exclusively by Bulgarians; in Eastern Rumelia the national element  is strongest in the Sredna Gora and Rhodope. Possibly the most genuine  representatives of the race are the Pomaks or Mahommedan Bulgarians, whose  conversion to Islam preserved their women from the licence of the Turkish  conqueror; they inhabit the highlands of Rhodope and certain districts in  the neighbourhood of Lovtcha (Lovetch) and Plevna. Retaining their  Bulgarian speech and many ancient national usages, they may be compared  with the indigenous Cretan, Bosnian and Albanian Moslems. The Pomaks in the  principality are estimated at 26,000, but their numbers are declining. In  the north-eastern district between the Yantra and the Black Sea the  Bulgarian race is as yet thinly represented; most of the inhabitants are  Turks, a quiet, submissive, agricultural population, which unfortunately  shows a tendency to emigrate. The Black Sea coast is inhabited by a variety  of races. The Greek element is strong in the maritime towns, and displays  its natural aptitude for navigation and commerce. The Gagaeuzi, a peculiar  race of Turkish-speaking Christians, inhabit the littoral from Cape Emine  to Cape Kaliakra: they are of Turanian origin and descend from the ancient  Kumani. The valleys of the Maritza and Arda are occupied by a mixed  population consisting of Bulgarians, Greeks and Turks; the principal Greek  colonies are in Stanimaka, Kavakly and Philippopolis. The origin of the  peculiar Shop tribe which inhabits the mountain tracts of Sofia, Breznik  and Radomir is a mystery. The Shops are conceivably a remnant of the  aboriginal race which remained undisturbed in its mountain home during the  Slavonic and Bulgarian incursions: they cling with much tenacity to their  distinctive customs, apparel and dialect. The considerable Vlach or Ruman  colony in the Danubian districts dates from the 18th century, when large  numbers of Walachian peasants sought a refuge on Turkish soil from the  tyranny of the boyars or nobles: the department of Vidin alone contains 36  Ruman villages with a population of 30,550. Especially interesting is the  race of nomad shepherds from the Macedonian and the Aegean coast who come  in thousands every summer to pasture their flocks on the Bulgarian  mountains; they are divided into two tribes--the Kutzovlachs, or \"lame  Vlachs,\" who speak Rumanian, and the Hellenized Karakatchans or \"black  shepherds\" (compare the Morlachs, or Mavro-vlachs, [Greek: mauroi blaches],  of Dalmatia), who speak Greek. The Tatars, a peaceable, industrious race,  are chiefly found in the neighbourhood of Varna and Silistria; they were  introduced as colonists by the Turkish government in 1861. They may be  reckoned at 12,000. The gipsies, who are scattered in considerable numbers  throughout the country, came into Bulgaria in the 14th century. They are  for the most part Moslems, and retain their ancient Indian speech. They  live in the utmost poverty, occupy separate cantonments in the villages,  and are treated as outcasts by the rest of the population. The Bulgarians,  being of mixed origin, possess few salient physical characteristics. The  Slavonic type is far less pronounced than among the kindred races; the  Ugrian or Finnish cast of features occasionally asserts itself in the  central Balkans. The face is generally oval, the nose straight, the jaw  somewhat heavy. The men, as a rule, are rather below middle height,  compactly built, and, among the peasantry, very muscular; the women are  generally deficient in beauty and rapidly grow old. The upper class, the  so-called _intelligenzia_, is physically very inferior to the rural  population.    _National Character._--The character of the Bulgarians presents a singular  contrast to that of the neighbouring nations. Less quick-witted than the  Greeks, less prone to idealism than the Servians, less apt to assimilate  the externals of civilization than the Rumanians, they possess in a  remarkable degree the qualities of patience, perseverance and endurance,  with the capacity for laborious effort peculiar to an agricultural race.  The tenacity and determination with which they pursue their national aims  may eventually enable them to vanquish their more brilliant competitors in  the struggle for hegemony in the Peninsula. Unlike most southern races, the  Bulgarians are reserved, taciturn, phlegmatic, unresponsive, and extremely  suspicious of foreigners. The peasants are industrious, peaceable and  orderly; the vendetta, as it exists in Albania, Montenegro and Macedonia,  and the use of the knife in quarrels, so common in southern Europe, are  alike unknown. The tranquillity of rural life has, unfortunately, been  invaded by the intrigues of political agitators, and bloodshed is not  uncommon at elections. All classes practise thrift bordering on parsimony,  and any display of wealth is generally resented. The standard of sexual  morality is high, especially in the rural districts; the unfaithful wife is  an object of public contempt, and in former times was punished with death.  Marriage ceremonies are elaborate and protracted, as is the case in most  primitive communities; elopements are frequent, but usually take place with  the consent of the parents on both sides, in order to avoid the expense of  a regular wedding. The principal amusement on Sundays and holidays is the  _choro_ ([Greek: choros]), which is danced on the village green to the  strains of the _gaida_ or bagpipe, and the _gusla_, a rudimentary fiddle.  The Bulgarians are religious in a simple way, but not fanatical, and the  influence of the priesthood is limited. Many ancient superstitions linger  among the peasantry, such as the belief in the vampire and the evil eye;  witches and necromancers are numerous and are much consulted.    _Government._--Bulgaria is a constitutional monarchy; by Art. iii. of the  Berlin Treaty it was declared hereditary in the family of a prince \"freely  elected by the population and confirmed by the Sublime Porte with the  assent of the powers.\" According to the constitution of Trnovo, voted by  the Assembly of Notables on the 29th of April 1879, revised by the Grand  Sobranye on the 27th of May 1893, and modified by the proclamation of a  Bulgarian kingdom on the 5th of October 1908, the royal dignity descends in  the direct male line. The king must profess the Orthodox faith, only the  first elected sovereign and his immediate heir being released from this  obligation. The legislative power is vested in the king in conjunction with  the [v.04 p.0778] national assembly; he is supreme head of the army,  supervises the executive power, and represents the country in its foreign  relations. In case of a minority or an interregnum, a regency of three  persons is appointed. The national representation is embodied in the  Sobranye, or ordinary assembly (Bulgarian, _S[)u]branie_, the Russian form  _Sobranye_ being usually employed by foreign writers), and the Grand  Sobranye, which is convoked in extraordinary circumstances. The Sobranye is  elected by manhood suffrage, in the proportion of 1 to 20,000 of the  population, for a term of five years. Every Bulgarian citizen who can read  and write and has completed his thirtieth year is eligible as a deputy.  Annual sessions are held from the 27th of October to the 27th of December.  All legislative and financial measures must first be discussed and voted by  the Sobranye and then sanctioned and promulgated by the king. The  government is responsible to the Sobranye, and the ministers, whether  deputies or not, attend its sittings. The Grand Sobranye, which is elected  in the proportion of 2 to every 20,000 inhabitants, is convoked to elect a  new king, to appoint a regency, to sanction a change in the constitution,  or to ratify an alteration in the boundaries of the kingdom. The executive  is entrusted to a cabinet of eight members--the ministers of foreign  affairs and religion, finance, justice, public works, the interior,  commerce and agriculture, education and war. Local administration, which is  organized on the Belgian model, is under the control of the minister of the  interior. The country is divided into twenty-two departments (_okr[)u]g_,  pl. _okr[)u]zi_), each administered by a prefect (_upravitel_), assisted by  a departmental council, and eighty-four sub-prefectures "]]]
