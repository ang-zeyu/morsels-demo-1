From their black tents, long files of horse, they stream'd;      As when some grey November morn the files,      In marching order spread, of long-neck'd cranes      Stream over Casbin and the southern slopes      Of Elburz, from the Aralian estuaries,      Or some frore Caspian reed-bed, southward bound      For the warm Persian sea-board--so they stream'd.      The Tartars of the Oxus, the King's guard,      First, with black sheep-skin caps and with long spears;      Large men, large steeds; who from Bokhara come      And Khiva, and ferment the milk of mares.      Next, the more temperate Toorkmuns of the south,      The Tukas, and the lances of Salore,      And those from Attruck and the Caspian sands;      Light men and on light steeds, who only drink      The acrid milk of camels, and their wells.      And then a swarm of wandering horse, who came      From far, and a more doubtful service own'd;      The Tartars of Ferghana, from the banks      Of the Jaxartes, men with scanty beards      And close-set skull-caps; and those wilder hordes      Who roam o'er Kipchak and the northern waste,      Kalmucks and unkempt Kuzzaks, tribes who stray      Nearest the Pole, and wandering Kirghizzes,      Who come on shaggy ponies from Pamere;      These all filed out from camp into the plain.    Matthew Arnold gives to the Tartar camp tents of lattice-work,  thick-piled carpets; to the Tartar leaders woollen coats, sandals,  and the sheep-skin cap which is still the national head-dress of the  Bulgarians. More important, in proof of his idea of their civilisation,  he credits them with a high sense of chivalry and a faithful regard for  facts. _Sohrab and Rustum_ is, of course, a flight of poetic fancy; but  its \"local colour\" is founded on good evidence. Probably the Huns,  despite the terrors of their name, the echoes of which still come down  the corridors of time; despite the awful titles which their leaders won  (such as Attila, \"the Scourge of God\"), were not on a very much lower  plane of civilisation than the Goths with whom they fought, or with the  other barbarians who tore at the prostrate body of the Roman Empire. One  may see people of very much the same type to-day on the outer edges of  Islam in some desert quarters; one may see and, if one has such taste  for the wild and the free in life as has Cunninghame Graham, one may  admire:        There in the Sahara the wild old life, the life in which man and      the animals seem to be nearer to each other than in the      countries where we have changed beasts into meat-producing      engines deprived of individuality, still takes its course, as it      has done from immemorial time. Children respect their parents,      wives look at their husbands almost as gods, and at the tent      door elders administer what they imagine justice, stroking their      long white beards, and as impressed with their judicial      functions as if their dirty turbans or ropes of camels' hair      bound round their heads, were horse-hair wigs, and the torn mat      on which they sit a woolsack or a judge's bench, with a carved      wooden canopy above it, decked with the royal arms.        Thus, when the blue baft-clad, thin, wiry desert-dweller on his      lean horse or mangy camel comes into a town, the townsmen look      on him as we should look on one of Cromwell's Ironsides, or on a      Highlander, of those who marched to Derby and set King George's      teeth, in pudding time, on edge.    The Huns' movement from the north-east was the first Asiatic invasion of  Europe since the fall of the Persian Empire. Almost simultaneously with  it the Saracen first entered from the south, as the ally of the  Christian Emperor against the Goths; and another Gothic chronicler,  Ammianus, tells how the Saracen warriors inspired also a lively horror  in the Gothic mind. They came into battle almost naked, and having  sprung upon a foe \"with a hoarse and melancholy howl, sucked his  life-blood from his throat.\" The Saracen of Ammianus was the forerunner  of the Turk, the Hun of Jordanes, the forerunner of the Bulgarian. In  neither case, of course, can the Gothic chronicler be accepted as an  unprejudiced witness. But it is interesting to note how the first  warriors from the Asiatic steppes impressed their contemporaries!    The first effect of the invasion of the country of the Goths by the Huns  was to force the Goths to recross the Danube and trespass again on Roman  territory. They sought leave from the Emperor Valens to do this. A  contemporary historian records:        The multitude of the Scythians escaping from the murderous      savagery of the Huns, who spared not the life of woman or of      child, amounted to not less than 200,000 men of fighting age      [besides old men, women, and children]. These, standing upon the      river-bank in a state of great excitement, stretched out their      hands from afar with loud lamentations, and earnestly      supplicated that they might be allowed to cross over the river,      bewailing the calamity that had befallen them, and promising      that they would faithfully adhere to the Imperial alliance if      this boon were granted them.    [Illustration: A WOMAN OF THRACE, OF THE SHOP TRIBE, AND OF MACEDONIA  The Shops inhabit the Mountain District of Sofia]    The Emperor Valens allowed the Gothic host to cross the Danube into  Bulgaria and Thrace, and having given them shelter, starved them and  treated them so harshly and cruelly that they were close to rebellion  when another great Gothic host, under King Fritigern, crossed the Danube  without leave and came down as far as Marcianople (now Schumla). Here he  was entertained at a \"friendly\" banquet by the Roman general Lupicinus.  But whilst the banquet was in progress disorder arose among the Goths  and the Romans outside the hall. The Gothic historians tell:        News of this disturbance was brought to Lupicinus as he was      sitting at his gorgeous banquet, watching the comic performers      and heavy with wine and sleep. He at once ordered that all the      Gothic soldiers, who, partly to do honour to their rank, and      partly as a guard to their persons, had accompanied the generals      into the palace, should be put to death. Thus, while Fritigern      was at the banquet, he heard the cry of men in mortal agony, and      soon ascertained that it proceeded from his own followers shut      up in another part of the palace, whom the Roman soldiers at the      command of their general were attempting to butcher. He drew his      sword in the midst of the banqueters, exclaimed that he alone      could pacify the tumult which had been raised among his      followers, and rushed out of the dining-hall with his      companions. They were received with shouts of joy by their      countrymen outside; they mounted their horses and rode away,      determined to revenge their slaughtered comrades.        Delighted to march once more under the generalship of one of the      bravest of men, and to exchange the prospect of death by hunger      for death on the battlefield, the Goths at once rose in arms.      Lupicinus, with no proper preparation, joined battle with them      at the ninth milestone from Marcianople, was defeated, and only      saved himself by a shameful flight. The barbarians equipped      themselves with the arms of the slain legionaries, and in truth      that day ended in one blow the hunger of the Goths and the      security of the Romans; for the Goths began thenceforward to      comport themselves no longer as strangers but as inhabitants,      and as lords to lay their commands upon the tillers of the soil      throughout all the Northern provinces.    That began a war which inflicted the third great blow on the Roman  Empire--the defeat and death of the Emperor Valens before Adrianople.  The Goths in this campaign seem to have brought in some of their old  enemies, the Huns, as allies--pretty clear proof of the contention I  have set up that the Huns were not such desperate savages; but these  Asiatics made the war rather more brutal than was usual for those days,  without a doubt. Theodosius, the younger (son of that brave general who  had just won back Britain for the Roman Empire), restored somewhat the  Roman power in the provinces south of the Balkans for a time. But in  the year 380 the Romans made peace again with the Goths, allowing them  to settle in Bulgaria as well as north of the Danube as allies of the  Roman Power.    In the latter part of the fourth century and the first half of the fifth  century the Huns fill the pages of Bulgarian history. Then came the  Slavs; and then, in the seventh century, the Bulgars, almost certainly a  Hun tribe, but Huns modified by two centuries of time. But the death of  Valens may be said to have ended the Roman Empire as a World Power. Let  us retrace our steps a little and give the chief facts as to how a  Bulgarian Empire for a time--a very short time--replaced the Roman  Empire over a great area of the Balkan Peninsula.          CHAPTER III    THE SCRAP-HEAP OF RACES      The historian, rightly, must always march under a banner inscribed  \"Why?\" The facts of history bring no real informing to the human mind  unless they can be traced to their causes, and thus a chain of events  followed link by link to see why some happening was so fruitful in  results, and to search for the relation of apparently isolated and  accidental incidents.    The Balkan Peninsula has to-day just emerged from a most bloody war. It  prepares for another to break out as soon as the exhaustion of the  moment has passed. Since ever the pages of history were inscribed it has  been vexed by savage wars. Why?    There is an explanation near at hand and clear. In the Balkans there is  a geographical"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22260"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Abbey Church of Tewkesbury (#5)"],[1,"been in the body of the church,  were removed into the chancel.    In 1603 \"the roof of lead over the chancel was taken down, new framed,  laid lower, and covered new,\" at the expense of the town.    In 1607 a large grey marble slab was discovered buried in the church.  It measured 13 feet 8 inches by 3 feet 6 inches, and 7 inches thick.  This was placed for some time in the middle of the chancel and was  used for a Communion table.       [Illustration: THE DETACHED BELL-TOWER, DEMOLISHED IN 1817.     _From Bennett's \"Tewkesbury\" lent by Mr. S. Browett._]    In 1653-54 there is an interesting entry in the churchwardens'  accounts: \"Item. Paid the ringers 24th December, my Lord Protector  being proclaimed that day--who was the Grand Rebel.\" (The last few  words are by a different hand, perhaps that of the other  churchwarden.)    In 1661 the west window was blown in, and was rebuilt in 1686.    In 1720 the external re-roofing of the nave was carried out, and the  western gable, occupying the space between the two western turrets,  disappeared in the process.    By 1720 the \"long roof,\" repaired in 1593, was again in want of  repair, and to raise money a brief was granted by Parker, the Lord  Chancellor. During the years 1723-26 the work was carried out and  finished. Before this, the eaves of the roof overlapped the side walls  of the nave.    In 1726 the \"old wall at the East end of the Chancel\" was taken down,  and foundations were dug upon which an altar-piece was to be erected.    About the same time, the marble Communion table, which Mr. Gough  called \"the finest Communion table in the kingdom,\" was moved into the  nave. It was then cut longitudinally into two pieces, which were used  as seats in the porch.    In 1737 the organ now in the choir was erected over the old screen.    A stone altar-piece, Doric in character, with an elliptical pediment,  was set up in 1725, the cost being partly met by private  subscriptions. It must have struck most people as incongruous, for it  was not liked, and in 1848 it was removed.    A flood in 1770 rose to such a height that service could not be held  in the church; and the old feoffee book states that \"the graves in the  church were shocking to behold, for scarce a stone was to be seen that  was not removed from its proper situation. Several parts of this  venerable building were materially injured, particularly the large  pillar next the seats of the Corporation, and the arch over the same.\"    In January, 1795, it was agreed at a parish meeting that \"the church  shall be whitewashed as soon as convenient, and other repairs be done  ... that shall appear necessary.\" The part of the church that was in  use was re-pewed, galleries were put up in the two transepts, and in  the easternmost bay of the aisles of the nave.    During the years 1824-30, the exterior of the tower, probably  untouched from the date of its first completion, was repaired, all  decayed stones being made good. The windows which had been partially  bricked up were opened, and shelving stones inserted instead. One of  the pinnacles was entirely rebuilt, and the three others repaired. The  turrets on the west front were also restored.    At this time also the transept walls and the roofs were repaired and  strengthened. The interior of the church previous to its  colour-washing was scraped and cleaned, and the walls and pillars  were repaired, pointed, and cemented. All the tombs were cleaned and  most of them restored. The greater part of the nave was paved with  Painswick stone, and in the rest of the church the gravestones were  relaid.       [Illustration: THE WEST END IN 1840.     By _Rev. J.L. Petit_.]    In 1825 the vicar and churchwardens posted to Worcester, that they  might inspect the colouring of the Cathedral and other churches there  with a view to decorating the Abbey. The committee decided in favour  of colour-washing the Abbey, and this was done three years later.    1828. The monuments of Sir Hugh le Despenser and Sir Guy de Brien,  being very dilapidated, were extensively repaired. Most of the  buttresses and pinnacles were entirely renewed. All this restoration  involved the outlay of a considerable amount of money, and if more had  been forthcoming more would have been undertaken, such as the  restoration of all the tombs and chapels, and the old windows in the  choir.    The font in 1828 was removed from the nave and placed in the apsidal  chapel in the south transept, from which position it was again removed  in 1878.    A final restoration was set on foot in 1864, and Sir Gilbert Scott  reported that L15,000 was necessary to make good the dilapidation and  decay which extended, in his opinion, from the foundations to the  roof. The necessary amount was not forthcoming for several years. Then  a new committee was appointed, with Sir Edmund Lechmere as its  chairman. In 1875 the restoration began, the choir being undertaken  first. For this purpose the church was divided into two parts by means  of a hoarding. When the pavement in the choir was removed, the graves  there were all carefully examined and their identification verified  where possible. Many fragments of historic stonework were found, and  these have been grouped together in the south-east chapel, which forms  a kind of museum.    After the work in the choir was advanced enough, the nave was  undertaken and thoroughly done; the floor was relaid on a foundation  of cement, all open graves being filled up.    On September 23, 1879, the building was re-dedicated with a service  modelled somewhat on the lines of the original dedication service in  1123.    During the last twenty years little has been done to the fabric.  Windows and other decoration have been lavished upon the interior, the  money expended amounting to several thousands of pounds, a sum which  might have been spent with more benefit to the fabric, upon purchasing  the precincts, and on repairing the timber-work which supports the  roof.    Interesting though the general question of the \"restoration\" of  ancient buildings is, and interesting though Tewkesbury is as a  particular case, this is not the place to go into it, but it may be  well to quote from Mackail's \"Life of William Morris,\" vol. i., p.  340, a letter which William Morris wrote to the _Athenaeum_ about the  restorations proposed at Tewkesbury.    \"My eye just now caught the word 'restoration' in the morning paper,  and, on looking closer, I saw that this time it is nothing less than  the Minster of Tewkesbury that is to be destroyed by Sir Gilbert  Scott. Is it altogether too late to do something to save it--it and  whatever else of beautiful and historical is still left us on the  sites of the ancient buildings we were once so famous for? Would it  not be of some use once for all, and with the least delay possible, to  set on foot an association for the purpose of watching over and  protecting these relics, which, scanty as they are now become, are  still wonderful treasures, all the more priceless in this age of the  world, when the newly-invented study of living history is the chief  joy of so many of our lives? Your paper has so steadily and  courageously opposed itself to these acts of barbarism which the  modern architect, parson, and squire call 'restoration,' that it would  be waste of words to enlarge here on the ruin that has been wrought by  their hands; but, for the saving of what is left, I think I may write  a word of encouragement, and say that you by no means stand alone in  the matter, and that there are many thoughtful people who would be  glad to sacrifice time, money, and comfort in defence of those ancient  monuments; besides, though I admit that the architects are, with very  few exceptions, hopeless, because interest, habit, and ignorance bind  them, and that the clergy are hopeless, because their order, habit,  and an ignorance yet grosser, bind them; still there must be many  people whose ignorance is accidental rather than inveterate, whose  good sense could surely be touched if it were clearly put to them that  they were destroying what they, or, more surely still, their sons and  sons' sons, would one day fervently long for, and which no wealth or  energy could ever buy again for them.    \"What I wish for, therefore, is that an association shall be set on  foot to keep a watch on old monuments, to protest against all  'restoration' that means more than keeping out wind and weather, and,  by all means, literary and other, to awaken a feeling that our ancient  buildings are not mere ecclesiastical toys, but sacred monuments of  the nation's growth and hope.\"    The interest of the quotation lies in the fact that the Society for  the Preservation of Ancient Buildings was formed, with Morris as its  first secretary--a very practical outcome to such a very forcibly  expressed letter.       [Illustration: THE CHOIR BEFORE RESTORATION.     _From an old photograph._]       [Illustration: THE NAVE BEFORE RESTORATION.     _From an old photograph._]    A chance presented itself in 1883 of re-purchasing the Abbey House, a  building which stood in its own grounds on lands embracing the site of  the whole of the original monastic buildings. Subscriptions poured in,  and at the auction, held in the town, the Abbey House Estate was  bought for L10,500, and became once more, after 344 years, the  property of the church. This estate included the Abbey House, the  Abbey Gateway, three cottages, and about nine acres of land. A portion  of the latter, viz., that which comprised the Cloister Walk, was added  to the churchyard. The Abbey House comprises portions of the infirmary  and perhaps of the misericord, which survived destruction at the time  of the suppression of the monastery. Part of the original wall remains  on the north side, between the gateway and the church. It is a pity  that the inscription under the bay window is illegible.    At the sale there was a curious lot ("]]]
