In Ethel Harrogate conventionality crowned itself  with a perfection and splendour of its own. Proud of her father's  prosperity, fond of fashionable pleasures, a fond daughter but an arrant  flirt, she was all these things with a sort of golden good-nature that  made her very pride pleasing and her worldly respectability a fresh and  hearty thing.    They were in an eddy of excitement about some alleged peril in the  mountain path they were to attempt that week. The danger was not from  rock and avalanche, but from something yet more romantic. Ethel had  been earnestly assured that brigands, the true cut-throats of the modern  legend, still haunted that ridge and held that pass of the Apennines.    \"They say,\" she cried, with the awful relish of a schoolgirl, \"that  all that country isn't ruled by the King of Italy, but by the King of  Thieves. Who is the King of Thieves?\"    \"A great man,\" replied Muscari, \"worthy to rank with your own Robin  Hood, signorina. Montano, the King of Thieves, was first heard of in the  mountains some ten years ago, when people said brigands were extinct.  But his wild authority spread with the swiftness of a silent revolution.  Men found his fierce proclamations nailed in every mountain village; his  sentinels, gun in hand, in every mountain ravine. Six times the Italian  Government tried to dislodge him, and was defeated in six pitched  battles as if by Napoleon.\"    \"Now that sort of thing,\" observed the banker weightily, \"would never  be allowed in England; perhaps, after all, we had better choose another  route. But the courier thought it perfectly safe.\"    \"It is perfectly safe,\" said the courier contemptuously. \"I have been  over it twenty times. There may have been some old jailbird called a  King in the time of our grandmothers; but he belongs to history if not  to fable. Brigandage is utterly stamped out.\"    \"It can never be utterly stamped out,\" Muscari answered; \"because armed  revolt is a recreation natural to southerners. Our peasants are like  their mountains, rich in grace and green gaiety, but with the fires  beneath. There is a point of human despair where the northern poor take  to drink--and our own poor take to daggers.\"    \"A poet is privileged,\" replied Ezza, with a sneer. \"If Signor Muscari  were English he would still be looking for highwaymen in Wandsworth.  Believe me, there is no more danger of being captured in Italy than of  being scalped in Boston.\"    \"Then you propose to attempt it?\" asked Mr Harrogate, frowning.    \"Oh, it sounds rather dreadful,\" cried the girl, turning her glorious  eyes on Muscari. \"Do you really think the pass is dangerous?\"    Muscari threw back his black mane. \"I know it is dangerous:\" he said. \"I  am crossing it tomorrow.\"    The young Harrogate was left behind for a moment emptying a glass of  white wine and lighting a cigarette, as the beauty retired with the  banker, the courier and the poet, distributing peals of silvery satire.  At about the same instant the two priests in the corner rose; the  taller, a white-haired Italian, taking his leave. The shorter priest  turned and walked towards the banker's son, and the latter was  astonished to realize that though a Roman priest the man was an  Englishman. He vaguely remembered meeting him at the social crushes  of some of his Catholic friends. But the man spoke before his memories  could collect themselves.    \"Mr Frank Harrogate, I think,\" he said. \"I have had an introduction, but  I do not mean to presume on it. The odd thing I have to say will come  far better from a stranger. Mr Harrogate, I say one word and go: take  care of your sister in her great sorrow.\"    Even for Frank's truly fraternal indifference the radiance and derision  of his sister still seemed to sparkle and ring; he could hear her  laughter still from the garden of the hotel, and he stared at his sombre  adviser in puzzledom.    \"Do you mean the brigands?\" he asked; and then, remembering a vague fear  of his own, \"or can you be thinking of Muscari?\"    \"One is never thinking of the real sorrow,\" said the strange priest.  \"One can only be kind when it comes.\"    And he passed promptly from the room, leaving the other almost with his  mouth open.    A day or two afterwards a coach containing the company was really  crawling and staggering up the spurs of the menacing mountain range.  Between Ezza's cheery denial of the danger and Muscari's boisterous  defiance of it, the financial family were firm in their original  purpose; and Muscari made his mountain journey coincide with theirs. A  more surprising feature was the appearance at the coast-town station of  the little priest of the restaurant; he alleged merely that business  led him also to cross the mountains of the midland. But young Harrogate  could not but connect his presence with the mystical fears and warnings  of yesterday.    The coach was a kind of commodious wagonette, invented by the modernist  talent of the courier, who dominated the expedition with his scientific  activity and breezy wit. The theory of danger from thieves was banished  from thought and speech; though so far conceded in formal act that some  slight protection was employed. The courier and the young banker carried  loaded revolvers, and Muscari (with much boyish gratification) buckled  on a kind of cutlass under his black cloak.    He had planted his person at a flying leap next to the lovely  Englishwoman; on the other side of her sat the priest, whose name was  Brown and who was fortunately a silent individual; the courier and the  father and son were on the banc behind. Muscari was in towering spirits,  seriously believing in the peril, and his talk to Ethel might well have  made her think him a maniac. But there was something in the crazy and  gorgeous ascent, amid crags like peaks loaded with woods like orchards,  that dragged her spirit up alone with his into purple preposterous  heavens with wheeling suns. The white road climbed like a white cat;  it spanned sunless chasms like a tight-rope; it was flung round far-off  headlands like a lasso.    And yet, however high they went, the desert still blossomed like the  rose. The fields were burnished in sun and wind with the colour of  kingfisher and parrot and humming-bird, the hues of a hundred flowering  flowers. There are no lovelier meadows and woodlands than the English,  no nobler crests or chasms than those of Snowdon and Glencoe. But  Ethel Harrogate had never before seen the southern parks tilted on the  splintered northern peaks; the gorge of Glencoe laden with the fruits  of Kent. There was nothing here of that chill and desolation that in  Britain one associates with high and wild scenery. It was rather like a  mosaic palace, rent with earthquakes; or like a Dutch tulip garden blown  to the stars with dynamite.    \"It's like Kew Gardens on Beachy Head,\" said Ethel.    \"It is our secret,\" answered he, \"the secret of the volcano; that is  also the secret of the revolution--that a thing can be violent and yet  fruitful.\"    \"You are rather violent yourself,\" and she smiled at him.    \"And yet rather fruitless,\" he admitted; \"if I die tonight I die  unmarried and a fool.\"    \"It is not my fault if you have come,\" she said after a difficult  silence.    \"It is never your fault,\" answered Muscari; \"it was not your fault that  Troy fell.\"    As they spoke they came under overwhelming cliffs that spread almost  like wings above a corner of peculiar peril. Shocked by the big shadow  on the narrow ledge, the horses stirred doubtfully. The driver leapt to  the earth to hold their heads, and they became ungovernable. One horse  reared up to his full height--the titanic and terrifying height of  a horse when he becomes a biped. It was just enough to alter the  equilibrium; the whole coach heeled over like a ship and crashed through  the fringe of bushes over the cliff. Muscari threw an arm round Ethel,  who clung to him, and shouted aloud. It was for such moments that he  lived.    At the moment when the gorgeous mountain walls went round the poet's  head like a purple windmill a thing happened which was superficially  even more startling. The elderly and lethargic banker sprang erect in  the coach and leapt over the precipice before the tilted vehicle could  take him there. In the first flash it looked as wild as suicide; but in  the second it was as sensible as a safe investment. The Yorkshireman had  evidently more promptitude, as well as more sagacity, than Muscari had  given him credit for; for he landed in a lap of land which might  have been specially padded with turf and clover to receive him. As  it happened, indeed, the whole company were equally lucky, if less  dignified in their form of ejection. Immediately under this abrupt turn  of the road was a grassy and flowery hollow like a sunken meadow; a  sort of green velvet pocket in the long, green, trailing garments of  the hills. Into this they were all tipped or tumbled with little damage,  save that their smallest baggage and even the contents of their pockets  were scattered in the grass around them. The wrecked coach still hung  above, entangled in the tough hedge, and the horses plunged painfully  down the slope. The first to sit up was the little priest, who scratched  his head with a face of foolish wonder. Frank Harrogate heard him say to  himself: \"Now why on earth have we fallen just here?\"    He blinked at the litter around him, and recovered his own very clumsy  umbrella. Beyond it lay the broad sombrero fallen from the head of  Muscari, and beside it a sealed business letter which, after a glance  at the address, he returned to the elder Harrogate. On the other side of  him the grass partly hid Miss Ethel's sunshade, and just beyond it lay a  curious little glass bottle hardly two inches long. The priest picked it  up; in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22305"],[0,"The Naval History of the United States. Volume 1 (#5)"],[1," munitions of war; yet the pirates, fighting with the bravery of  desperate men, were victorious, and the city fell into their hands.  Then followed days of murder, plunder, and debauchery. Morgan saw his  followers, maddened by liquor, scoff at the idea of discipline and  obedience. Fearing that while his men were helplessly drunk the  Spaniards would rally and cut them to pieces, he set fire to the city,  that the stores of rum might be destroyed. After sacking the town, the  vandals packed their plunder on the backs of mules, and retraced their  steps to the seaboard. Their booty amounted to over two millions of  dollars. Over the division of this enormous sum great dissensions  arose, and Morgan saw the mutinous spirit spreading rapidly among his  men. With a few accomplices, therefore, he loaded a ship with the  plunder, and secretly set sail; leaving over half of his band, without  food or shelter, in a hostile country. Many of the abandoned  buccaneers starved, some were shot or hanged by the enraged Spaniards;  but the leader of the rapacious gang reached Jamaica with a huge  fortune, and was appointed governor of the island, and made a baronet  by the reigning king of England, Charles the Second.    Such were some of the exploits of some of the more notorious of the  buccaneers. It may be readily imagined, that, with hordes of  desperadoes such as these infesting the waters of the West Indies,  there was little opportunity for the American Colonies to build up any  maritime interests in that direction. And as the merchantmen became  scarce on the Spanish Main, such of the buccaneers as did not turn  landward in search of booty put out to sea, and ravaged the ocean  pathways between the Colonies and England. It was against these  pirates, that the earliest naval operations of the Colonies were  directed. Several cruisers were fitted out to rid the seas of these  pests, but we hear little of their success. But the name of one  officer sent against the pirates has become notorious as that of the  worst villain of them all.    It was in January, 1665, that William III., King of England, issued  \"to our true and well-beloved Capt. William Kidd, commander of the  ship 'Adventure,'\" a commission to proceed against \"divers wicked  persons who commit many and great piracies, robberies, and  depredations on the seas.\" Kidd was a merchant of New York, and had  commanded a privateer during the last war with France. He was a man of  great courage, and, being provided with a stanch ship and brave crew,  set out with high hopes of winning great reputation and much prize  money. But fortune was against him. For months the \"Adventure\"  ploughed the blue waves of the ocean, yet not a sail appeared on the  horizon. Once, indeed, three ships were seen in the distance. The men  of the \"Adventure\" were overjoyed at the prospect of a rich prize. The  ship was prepared for action. The men, stripped to the waist, stood at  their quarters, talking of the coming battle. Kidd stood in the  rigging with a spy-glass, eagerly examining the distant vessels. But  only disappointment was in store; for, as the ships drew nearer, Kidd  shut his spy-glass with an oath, saying,--    \"They are only three English men-o'-war.\"    Continued disappointment bred discontent and mutiny among the crew.  They had been enlisted with lavish promises of prize money, but saw  before them nothing but a profitless cruise. The spirit of discontent  spread rapidly. Three or four ships that were sighted proved to be  neither pirates nor French, and were therefore beyond the powers of  capture granted Kidd by the king. Kidd fought against the growing  piratical sentiment for a long time; but temptation at last overcame  him, and he yielded. Near the Straits of Babelmandeb, at the entrance  to the Red Sea, he landed a party, plundered the adjoining country for  provisions, and, turning his ship's prow toward the straits, mustered  his crew on deck, and thus addressed them:--    \"We have been unsuccessful hitherto, my boys,\" he said, \"but take  courage. Fortune is now about to smile upon us. The fleet of the  'Great Mogul,' freighted with the richest treasures, is soon to come  out of the Red Sea. From the capture of those heavily laden ships, we  will all grow rich.\"    The crew, ready enough to become pirates, cheered lustily: and,  turning his back upon all hopes of an honorable career, Kidd set out  in search of the treasure fleet. After cruising for four days, the  \"Adventure\" fell in with the squadron, which proved to be under convoy  of an English and a Dutch man-of-war. The squadron was a large one,  and the ships greatly scattered. By skilful seamanship, Kidd dashed  down upon an outlying vessel, hoping to capture and plunder it before  the convoying men-of-war could come to its rescue. But his first shot  attracted the attention of the watchful guardians; and, though several  miles away, they packed on all sail, and bore down to the rescue with  such spirit that the disappointed pirate was forced to sheer off. Kidd  was now desperate. He had failed as a reputable privateer, and his  first attempt at piracy had failed. Thenceforward, he cast aside all  scruples, and captured large ships and small, tortured their crews,  and for a time seemed resolved to lead a piratical life. But there are  evidences that at times this strange man relented, and strove to  return to the path of duty and right. On one occasion, a Dutch ship  crossed the path of the \"Adventure,\" and the crew clamorously demanded  her capture. Kidd firmly refused. A tumult arose. The captain drew his  sabre and pistols, and gathering about him those still faithful,  addressed the mutineers, saying,--    \"You may take the boats and go. But those who thus leave this ship  will never ascend its sides again.\"    The mutineers murmured loudly. One man, a gunner, named William Moore,  stepped forward, saying,--    \"You are ruining us all. You are keeping us in beggary and starvation.  But for your whims, we might all be prosperous and rich.\"    At this outspoken mutiny, Kidd flew into a passion. Seizing a heavy  bucket that stood near, he dealt Moore a terrible blow on the head.  The unhappy man fell to the deck with a fractured skull, and the other  mutineers sullenly yielded to the captain's will. Moore died the next  day; and months after, when Kidd, after roving the seas, and robbing  ships of every nationality, was brought to trial at London, it was  for the murder of William Moore that he was condemned to die. For  Kidd's career subsequent to the incident of the Dutch ship was that of  a hardened pirate. He captured and robbed ships, and tortured their  passengers. He went to Madagascar, the rendezvous of the pirates, and  joined in their revelry and debauchery. On the island were five or six  hundred pirates, and ships flying the black flag were continually  arriving or departing. The streets resounded with shouts of revelry,  with curses, and with the cries of rage. Strong drinks were freely  used. Drunkenness was everywhere. It was no uncommon thing for a  hogshead of wine to be opened, and left standing in the streets, that  any might drink who chose. The pirates, flush with their ill-gotten  gains, spent money on gambling and kindred vices lavishly. The women  who accompanied them to this lawless place were decked out with  barbaric splendor in silks and jewels. On the arrival of a ship, the  debauchery was unbounded. Such noted pirates as Blackbeard, Steed  Bonnet, and Avary made the place their rendezvous, and brought thither  their rich prizes and wretched prisoners. Blackbeard was one of the  most desperate pirates of the age. He, with part of his crew, once  terrorized the officials of Charleston, S.C., exacting tribute of  medicines and provisions. Finally he was killed in action, and sixteen  of his desperate gang expiated their crimes on the gallows.    To Madagascar, too, often came the two female pirates, Mary Read and  Anne Bonny. These women, masquerading in men's clothing, were as  desperate and bloody as the men by whose side they fought. By a  strange coincidence, these two women enlisted on the same ship. Each  knowing her own sex, and being ignorant of that of the other, they  fell in love; and the final discovery of their mutual deception  increased their intimacy. After serving with the pirates, working at  the guns, swinging a cutlass in the boarding parties, and fighting a  duel in which she killed her opponent, Mary Read determined to escape.  There is every evidence that she wearied of the evil life she was  leading, and was determined to quit it; but, before she could carry  her intentions into effect, the ship on which she served was captured,  and taken to England, where the pirates expiated their crimes on the  gallows, Mary Read dying in prison before the day set for her  execution.    After some months spent in licentious revelry at Madagascar, Kidd set  out on a further cruise. During this voyage he learned that he had  been proscribed as a pirate, and a price set on his head. Strange as  it may appear, this news was a surprise to him. He seems to have  deceived himself into thinking that his acts of piracy were simply the  legitimate work of a privateersman. For a time he knew not what to do;  but as by this time the coarse pleasures of an outlaw's life were  distasteful to him, he determined to proceed to New York, and endeavor  to prove himself an honest man. This determination proved to be an  unfortunate one for him; for hardly had he arrived, when he was taken  into custody, and sent to England for trial. He made an able defence,  but was found guilty, and sentenced to be hanged; a sentence which was  executed some months later, in the presence of a vast multitude of  people, who applauded in the death of Kidd the end of the reign of  outlaws upon the ocean.
