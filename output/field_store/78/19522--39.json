[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18854"],[0,"The Gourmet's Guide to Europe (#5)"],[1,"it is necessary to be in a hurry, and they can serve a dinner very  quickly. At the Champeaux, which has much history behind it, the  _Chateaubriand_ was invented which gives eternal honour to the  restaurant.    I am told that Sylvain's remains a good dining place, but I have not  been within its doors since the days when it attained celebrity as a  supper place in favour with the butterfly ladies of Paris.      Across the River    On the south side of the Seine there are three restaurants worthy the  consideration of the gourmet,--the Tour d'Argent, La Peyrouse, and  Foyot's. The Tour d'Argent is on the Quai de la Tourelle, just beyond  the island on which Notre Dame stands. It is a little old-fashioned  place with a narrow entrance hall and a low-ceilinged parlour. Frederic  is its proprietor, and since Joseph of the Marivaux died Frederic  remains the one great \"character\" in the dining world of Paris. In  appearance he is the double of Ibsen, the same sweeping whiskers, the  same wave of hair brushed straight off from the forehead. He is an  inventor of dishes, and it is well to ask for a list of his \"creations,\"  which are of fish, eggs, meat, and fruit, and are generally named after  some patron of the establishment,--_Canape Clarence Mackay_, _Filet de  Sole Gibbs_, _Filet de Lievre Arnold White_, _Oeufs Claude Lowther_,  _Poire Wannamaker_, and so on. A marquis, M. de Lauzieres de Themines,  has written a long poem about Frederic, which is printed on the back of  the list of \"creations,\" and an artist has painted a portrait of the  great man which will be shown to you if you have proved yourself a real  gourmet. Madame Frederic, or his daughter, will hold the canvas for your  inspection, and Frederic himself, brushing back his whiskers, will stand  beside it in order that you may see what an excellent likeness it is. It  is as well to interest Frederic in the ordering of your meal, and if you  give him an idea of your requirements, he will select two or three of  his \"creations\" which will make up a perfect meal. I always ask for a  _Filet de Sole Cardinal_, which is one of his best dishes, and look to  him to group a couple of other _plats_ with it to make a perfect  breakfast, for I look on the Tour d'Argent as being a better place to  breakfast at than to dine at, owing to its distance from the centre of  Paris. Frederic thinking out his dishes drops into a reverie and turns  his eyes up to the ceiling. I once took a lady to breakfast at the  Tour--she had selected it as being quite close to the Morgue, which she  wanted to see after lunch, having a liking for cheerful sights--and she  had the daring to interrupt Frederic's reverie. \"And for the eggs?\" I  had said insinuatingly to the creator of dishes, and he had dropped into  deepest thought. \"_Uffs a la plat_,\" said the lady, who fancied we were  both at a loss as to how eggs could be cooked. Frederic came back from  the clouds and gave the lady one look. It was not a look of anger, or  contempt, but simply an expression of pity for the whole of her sex.  Frederic, as Joseph did, holds that a dinner to be good must be short,  which is, I believe, the first axiom that every true gourmet should  enunciate and hold by, and an excellent proof that he holds to his  tenets was once given me. When the Behring Sea Conference sat in Paris,  the American and English members used frequently to dine together after  their labours. Lord Hannen had heard of the Tour d'Argent, and sent his  secretary, a clever barrister, to order dinner there for all the  members. He went to the Quai de la Tourelle, saw Frederic, and sketched  out to him a regular Eaton Square dinner, two entrees, a joint, sorbet,  game, an iced pudding, a savoury, and fruit. Frederic heard him out, and  then very politely suggested that he should go elsewhere, for such a  barbarous feast could not be served in the Tour d'Argent. If you are in  great favour Frederic will cook you a dish himself, and will bustle  into the room with the \"creation\" in his hands and great beads of  perspiration, drawn out by the kitchen fire, on his broad brow. I am  sorry, however, to have to write that the last time I saw Frederic, at  the close of 1902, he was very ill. He complained of his chest, said  that the weather oppressed him, and lamented the death of Joseph which  had taken a friend and a brother artist away. His hair had lost its bold  curve and his whiskers their glory. I told him in all sincerity that he  must get over his malady, for that as there are so few \"creators\" and  great _maitres-d'hotel_ left we cannot spare one of the most original  and most accomplished of them.    La Peyrouse on the Quai des Grands Augustins, is a little house with  many small rooms. It is known to the students of the \"Quartier\" as \"Le  Navigateur.\" It is a favourite resort of the members of the Paris bar,  has its special dishes, one of which is, as a matter of course, _Filets  de Sole La Peyrouse_, and a most excellent cellar of Burgundies and  white Bordeaux. The Cerons at 3 francs is excellent money's worth.    The Restaurant Foyot is almost opposite the Luxembourg Gallery, and is a  very handy restaurant to dine at when going to the Odeon. _Potage  Foyot_, _Riz de Veau Foyot_, _Homard Foyot_, and _Biscuit Foyot_ are  some of the dishes of the house, and all to be recommended. The  anarchists once tried to blow up Foyot's with a bomb; but the only  person injured was an anarchist poet, who has so far been false to his  tenets as to dine in the company of aristocrats, and was tranquilly  eating a _Truite Meuniere_, in company with a beautiful lady, when his  friends outside let off their firework. The _hors-d'oeuvre_ at Foyot's  are particularly good. It is, however, a restaurant at which it is  exceptionally difficult to get one's bill when one is in a hurry.      Summer Restaurants    Of the restaurants in the Champs Elysees, Laurent's and Paillard's are  the most aristocratic. At Laurent's I generally find in summer some of  the younger members of the staffs of the Embassies breakfasting under  the trees behind the hedge which shuts the restaurant off from the  bustle of Paris outside. Of the special dishes of the house the _Canard  Pompeienne_ remains to me an especially grateful memory. It is a cold  duck stuffed with most of the rich edible things of this world, _foie  gras_ predominating, and it is covered with designs in red and black on  a white ground.    Paillard's _bonbonniere_, in the Champs Elysees, is in the hands of the  company which also owns Maire's Restaurant, to which I have already  alluded. M. Paillard and the company formed under his name settled a  disagreement in the law courts, with the result that M. Paillard  retained the restaurant at the corner of the Chaussee d'Antin as his  property, and the company took possession of the Restaurant Maire and  the Pavillion des Champs Elysees. This, however, is mere history, for  the Pavillion serves its meals with all the quiet luxury of the parent  house, and I have a memory of a _Potage Creme d'Antin_ which was  especially excellent.    Ledoyen's has attained a particular celebrity as the restaurant where  every one lunches on the _vernissage_ day of the Salon. At dinner-time,  on a fine evening, every table on the stretch of gravel before the  little villa is occupied, and the good bourgeois, the little clerk  taking his wife and mother-in-law out to dinner, are just as much in  evidence, and more so, than the \"smarter\" classes of Parisians. The  service is rather haphazard on a crowded night, and scurrying waiters  appeal to the carvers in pathetic tones to wheel the moving tables on  which the joints are kept hot up to their particular tables. The food is  good, but not always served as hot as it should be--the fault of all  open-air dining places. The wine-list is a good one, and I have drunk at  Ledoyen's excellent champagne of the good brands and the great years at  a comparatively small price. Guillemin, who was cook to the Duc de  Vincennes, brought Ledoyen's into great favour in the fifties of the  last century.    The Bouillon Riche, just behind the Alcazar, with its girl waiters I  have generally found even more haphazard than Ledoyen's. Its food is  neither noticeably good nor is it indifferent.    The Ambassadeurs prides itself on being quite a first-class restaurant,  and it is one of the special experiences of the foreigner in Paris to  dine at one of the tables in the balcony looking towards the stage, and  to listen to the concert while you drink your coffee and sip your _fine  champagne_. I have kept the menu of one such dinner, very well cooked  and well served in spite of the crowded balcony and general hubbub of  the evening, on a Grand Prix night. What the amount of the bill was that  the host of the party had to pay I did not inquire, but I feel sure that  it was a very long one.    This is the menu:--                   Melon.          Potage Ambassadeurs.            Hors-d'oeuvre.       Truite Gelee Maconnaise.        Ris de Veau Financiere.      Demi-Vierge en Chaud-Froid.        Poulets de Grain Rotis.          Salade de Romaine.           Asperges Froides.            Coupes Jacques.                Dessert.            Petites Fraises.    The cold trout was excellent, and the wine was De St-Marceaux '89.    The Alcazar has a restaurant somewhat similar to that of the  Ambassadeurs.    Chevillard's, at the Rond Point des Champs Elysees, is not an  out-of-doors restaurant, but it is a favourite place to breakfast at on  the way out to the races. The cooking is good. Sometimes the restaurant  is crowded, and it is as well to secure a table in advance.    There are half-a-dozen cafes, farms where milk is sold, and other  refreshment places in the Bois; but the two restaurants which the  travelling gourmet is likely to dine at are the Pavillion d'Armenonville  and the Chateau de Madrid. The first is very \"smart,\" and the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18857"],[0,"A Journey to the Centre of the Earth (#5)"],[1,"with awe, and for some minutes she could not speak.    \"Well?\" I at last said, rather anxiously.    \"What a magnificent journey. If I were only a man! A journey worthy of  the nephew of Professor Hardwigg. I should look upon it as an honor to  accompany him.\"    \"My dear Gretchen, I thought you would be the first to cry out against  this mad enterprise.\"    \"No; on the contrary, I glory in it. It is magnificent, splendid--an  idea worthy of my father. Henry Lawson, I envy you.\"    This was, as it were, conclusive. The final blow of all.    When we entered the house we found my uncle surrounded by workmen and  porters, who were packing up. He was pulling and hauling at a bell.    \"Where have you been wasting your time? Your portmanteau is not  packed--my papers are not in order--the precious tailor has not brought  my clothes, nor my gaiters--the key of my carpet bag is gone!\"    I looked at him stupefied. And still he tugged away at the bell.    \"We are really off, then?\" I said.    \"Yes--of course, and yet you go out for a stroll, unfortunate boy!\"    \"And when do we go?\"    \"The day after tomorrow, at daybreak.\"    I heard no more; but darted off to my little bedchamber and locked  myself in. There was no doubt about it now. My uncle had been hard at  work all the afternoon. The garden was full of ropes, rope ladders,  torches, gourds, iron clamps, crowbars, alpenstocks, and  pickaxes--enough to load ten men.    I passed a terrible night. I was called early the next day to learn that  the resolution of my uncle was unchanged and irrevocable. I also found  my cousin and affianced wife as warm on the subject as was her father.    Next day, at five o'clock in the morning, the post chaise was at the  door. Gretchen and the old cook received the keys of the house; and,  scarcely pausing to wish anyone good-by, we started on our adventurous  journey into the centre of the earth.          CHAPTER 5    First Lessons in Climbing      At Altona, a suburb of Hamburg, is the Chief Station of the Kiel  railway, which was to take us to the shores of the Belt. In twenty  minutes from the moment of our departure we were in Holstein, and our  carriage entered the station. Our heavy luggage was taken out, weighed,  labeled, and placed in a huge van. We then took our tickets, and exactly  at seven o'clock were seated opposite each other in a firstclass railway  carriage.    My uncle said nothing. He was too busy examining his papers, among which  of course was the famous parchment, and some letters of introduction  from the Danish consul which were to pave the way to an introduction to  the Governor of Iceland. My only amusement was looking out of the  window. But as we passed through a flat though fertile country, this  occupation was slightly monotonous. In three hours we reached Kiel, and  our baggage was at once transferred to the steamer.    We had now a day before us, a delay of about ten hours. Which fact put  my uncle in a towering passion. We had nothing to do but to walk about  the pretty town and bay. At length, however, we went on board, and at  half past ten were steaming down the Great Belt. It was a dark night,  with a strong breeze and a rough sea, nothing being visible but the  occasional fires on shore, with here and there a lighthouse. At seven in  the morning we left Korsor, a little town on the western side of  Seeland.    Here we took another railway, which in three hours brought us to the  capital, Copenhagen, where, scarcely taking time for refreshment, my  uncle hurried out to present one of his letters of introduction. It was  to the director of the Museum of Antiquities, who, having been informed  that we were tourists bound for Iceland, did all he could to assist us.  One wretched hope sustained me now. Perhaps no vessel was bound for such  distant parts.    Alas! a little Danish schooner, the <i>Valkyrie</i>, was to sail on the  second of June for Reykjavik. The captain, M. Bjarne, was on board, and  was rather surprised at the energy and cordiality with which his future  passenger shook him by the hand. To him a voyage to Iceland was merely a  matter of course. My uncle, on the other hand, considered the event of  sublime importance. The honest sailor took advantage of the Professor's  enthusiasm to double the fare.    \"On Tuesday morning at seven o'clock be on board,\" said M. Bjarne,  handing us our receipts.    \"Excellent! Capital! Glorious!\" remarked my uncle as we sat down to a  late breakfast; \"refresh yourself, my boy, and we will take a run  through the town.\"    Our meal concluded, we went to the Kongens-Nye-Torw; to the king's  magnificent palace; to the beautiful bridge over the canal near the  Museum; to the immense cenotaph of Thorwaldsen with its hideous naval  groups; to the castle of Rosenberg; and to all the other lions of the  place-none of which my uncle even saw, so absorbed was he in his  anticipated triumphs.    But one thing struck his fancy, and that was a certain singular steeple  situated on the Island of Amak, which is the southeast quarter of the  city of Copenhagen. My uncle at once ordered me to turn my steps that  way, and accordingly we went on board the steam ferry boat which does  duty on the canal, and very soon reached the noted dockyard quay.    In the first instance we crossed some narrow streets, where we met  numerous groups of galley slaves, with particolored trousers, grey and  yellow, working under the orders and the sticks of severe taskmasters,  and finally reached the Vor-Frelser's-Kirk.    This church exhibited nothing remarkable in itself; in fact, the worthy  Professor had only been attracted to it by one circumstance, which was,  that its rather elevated steeple started from a circular platform, after  which there was an exterior staircase, which wound round to the very  summit.    \"Let us ascend,\" said my uncle.    \"But I never could climb church towers,\" I cried, \"I am subject to  dizziness in my head.\"    \"The very reason why you should go up. I want to cure you of a bad  habit.\"    \"But, my good sir--\"    \"I tell you to come. What is the use of wasting so much valuable time?\"    It was impossible to dispute the dictatorial commands of my uncle. I  yielded with a groan. On payment of a fee, a verger gave us the key. He,  for one, was not partial to the ascent. My uncle at once showed me the  way, running up the steps like a schoolboy. I followed as well as I  could, though no sooner was I outside the tower, than my head began to  swim. There was nothing of the eagle about me. The earth was enough for  me, and no ambitious desire to soar ever entered my mind. Still things  did not go badly until I had ascended 150 steps, and was near the  platform, when I began to feel the rush of cold air. I could scarcely  stand, when clutching the railings, I looked upwards. The railing was  frail enough, but nothing to those which skirted the terrible winding  staircase, that appeared, from where I stood, to ascend to the skies.    \"Now then, Henry.\"    \"I can't do it!\" I cried, in accents of despair.    \"Are you, after all, a coward, sir?\" said my uncle in a pitiless tone.  \"Go up, I say!\"    To this there was no reply possible. And yet the keen air acted  violently on my nervous system; sky, earth, all seemed to swim round,  while the steeple rocked like a ship. My legs gave way like those of a  drunken man. I crawled upon my hands and knees; I hauled myself up  slowly, crawling like a snake. Presently I closed my eyes, and allowed  myself to be dragged upwards.    \"Look around you,\" said my uncle in a stern voice, \"heaven knows what  profound abysses you may have to look down. This is excellent practice.\"    Slowly, and shivering all the while with cold, I opened my eyes. What  then did I see? My first glance was upwards at the cold fleecy clouds,  which as by some optical delusion appeared to stand still, while the  steeple, the weathercock, and our two selves were carried swiftly along.  Far away on one side could be seen the grassy plain, while on the other  lay the sea bathed in translucent light. The Sund, or Sound as we call  it, could be discovered beyond the point of Elsinore, crowded with white  sails, which, at that distance looked like the wings of seagulls; while  to the east could be made out the far-off coast of Sweden. The whole  appeared a magic panorama.    But faint and bewildered as I was, there was no remedy for it. Rise and  stand up I must. Despite my protestations my first lesson lasted quite  an hour. When, nearly two hours later, I reached the bosom of mother  earth, I was like a rheumatic old man bent double with pain.    \"Enough for one day,\" said my uncle, rubbing his hands, \"we will begin  again tomorrow.\"    There was no remedy. My lessons lasted five days, and at the end of that  period, I ascended blithely enough, and found myself able to look down  into the depths below without even winking, and with some degree of  pleasure.          CHAPTER 6    Our Voyage to Iceland      The hour of departure came at last. The night before, the worthy Mr.  Thompson brought us the most cordial letters of introduction for Baron  Trampe, Governor of Iceland, for M. Pictursson, coadjutor to the bishop,  and for M. Finsen, mayor of the town of Reykjavik. In return, my uncle  nearly crushed his hands, so warmly did he shake them.    On the second of the month, at two in the morning, our precious cargo of  luggage was taken on board the good ship <i>Valkyrie</i>. We followed, and  were very politely introduced by the captain to a small cabin with two  standing bed places, neither very well ventilated nor very comfortable.  But in the cause of science men are expected to suffer.    \"Well, and have we a fair wind?\" cried my uncle, in his most mellifluous  accents.    \"An excellent wind!\" replied Captain Bjarne; \"we shall leave the Sound,  going free with all sails set.\"    A few minutes afterwards, the schooner started before the wind,"]]]
