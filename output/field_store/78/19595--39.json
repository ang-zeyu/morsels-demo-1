But the criticism  is often made that the true significance of the celebration of the  birth of Christ is lost in the mere idea of bartering Christmas  presents. \"She didn't give me anything last year, so I'm not going to  give her anything this year.\"    One wise superintendent determined to teach his Sunday School pupils  the precious lesson of the beauty of giving. He called his teachers  together a few weeks before Christmas and proposed to eliminate  entirely the idea of \"getting something,\" and in its stead to try to  teach something of the true spirit of Christmas, the blessedness of  giving.    The children were told that while at home they would receive all the  usual presents, of course they would not get anything whatever from  the Sunday School. The story of Jesus and how He gave His life, and  how He liked best the gifts that cost us something, love, thought,  foresight, charity, money--was told to the children and they were  asked to save their pennies, instead of spending them for candy and  nuts, to brighten the Christmas Day for God's poor and unfortunate.    It was put to a vote and every little hand was raised, although it may  be confessed that a few went up a little reluctantly.    Teachers and young ladies met a few evenings later and made little  stockings out of cheap cambric, with a cord put into the top of each  in such a manner that it could be drawn together so the pennies would  not be lost out. The stockings were about five inches long, and of  various bright colors, and there were enough for every child. These  were given out two weeks before Christmas.    On Christmas Eve, near the close of the regular program, a large tree  was disclosed, but without a single present on it. The Minister made a  short talk on the joys of giving to the poor and the children marched  up, singing a Christmas carol, and attached their little stocking-bags  to the tree.    Six little boys and girls passed among the congregation with larger  stockings, collecting donations for the tree. These stockings had  their tops neatly sewed around little circles of wire to keep them  open.    The program consisted of Christmas hymns and carols, interspersed with  recitations--all breathing the spirit of the White Christmas.      REMARKS ON THE PRODUCTION.    SCENERY.    Hang the rear and the sides of the stage with dark blue curtains,  spangled with small silver bits of tinfoil, to represent very tiny  stars. If the blue curtains are not available, use white sheets.    Cover the floor with white sheets. Have two or three small evergreen  trees at rear, covered with white calcimine and diamond powder. Soak  long rags, shaped like icicles, in a strong solution of alum, and then  let them crystallize, then attach them to the trees.    [Illustration]    Down right, near the audience, is a doorway, supposed to be the  entrance to the inn. This may be simply an opening between two wooden  columns, with a step or two leading in. A lantern hangs over the door.  A small bench stands by the inn.    Down left, near the audience, is the manger, a building extending out  from left about seven feet. It has a back and one side of scenery or  dark draperies and a thatched roof, covered with twigs or evergreen  branches. There may be a door leading into the manger from the stage,  but this is not necessary, as the characters can go out behind the  manger. A front curtain, of dark goods, conceals the interior of the  manger from the audience until it is withdrawn by Joseph.    The interior of the manger is covered with hay. Rude boxes and farm  implements all around. A large upturned chair with wooden legs may  simulate the crib, if it is concealed by enough straw. An electric  light bulb is concealed in this straw and shines on the face of Mary,  bending over the crib.    If desired, the manger scene may be presented in the choir loft, the  manger hidden by curtains until revealed by Joseph. In this case have  the evergreen trees at the left of the stage and arrange the manger  scene at the rear and elevated above the other scene. This will prove  most feasible in churches where the choir loft is immediately behind  and above the platform.      LIGHTS.    Dim all the lights in the audience. Have a powerful searchlight,  engine headlight or two powerful auto lights shining on the stage from  a concealed elevation at the left. Shade these lights with a blue  isinglass shield, thus casting a blue light over the entire stage. Use  a strong yellow light on the manger scene, the rest of the stage being  in darkness.      PROPERTIES.    If it is possible have bits of white confetti or finely cut paper fall  from above during the shepherds' scene in Act II.    The bases of the trees should be covered with cotton.    Three rough crooks for the shepherds.    Chimes to ring off the stage. A dinner gong or set of chimes will  answer.    For the lamb use a white muff, being careful to shield it from the  direct gaze of the audience.    A spray of cherries.    A small bird of blue feathers.    A ball.    A crown and scepter made of gilded wood.    A censor made of metallic butter dish suspended by chains.    A fancy jewel case, supposed to contain myrrh.    Bench in front of inn.    Rude box in front of manger.      COSTUMES.    MARY--A sweet-faced blonde. Long tunic of light blue, falling straight  from neck to the ankles. White stockings. Sandals. Hair in two long  braids either side of face. White veil draped around head and  shoulders, bound about the brow with circlet. Dark red mantle,  fastened to left shoulder and draped around body. This mantle may  trail on the ground. The tunic may be made of cotton crepon, the  mantle of dyed muslin.    JOSEPH--A virile, bearded man of about fifty. Sandals. Long black  cassock, easily obtained from an Episcopal choir. Striped couch cover  may serve as mantle. This should be draped about head and body. Long  staff.

This serves as a mantle, draped over head and  body. Hair hanging. A woman of thirty-five. Sandals. If desired, a  blue veil may be draped around the head and neck and the mantle draped  over the body.    THOMAS--A boy of seven. Sandals. Brown strips criss-crossed on legs  from sandals to hips. Short white tunic cut like a boy's nightgown,  but coming only to knees. Dark blue mantle. Small crook.    RUTH--A girl of eleven. Blue tunic hanging in straight folds from neck  to three or four inches above ankles. Border of figured goods, to  simulate oriental embroidery, around bottom of robe and down the  front. This should be about two inches wide. Sandals. White stockings.  Hair hanging. White veil draped around head and shoulders. Later she  enters with striped mantle.    DEBORAH--A dignified matron of about forty-five. Sandals. Long kimono  of solid color. Sash of yellow. Hair in two long braids on either side  of face. Yellow drapery over head and shoulders. Rich striped mantle  draped over the costume.    RACHEL--Sandals. White tunic trimmed with red figured cloth to  simulate oriental embroidery. Red sash. Wreath of red roses on head.  Mantle made of a square white sheet with stripes of red sewed on it.  Bracelets, armlets and anklets of silver paper.    PRISCILLA--Sandals. Light green tunic. Dark green mantle. Gold paper  armlets, etc.    MELCHOIR--Tall, dark man with dark mustache. Long black cassock may be  borrowed from an Episcopal Church. Over this is a red or yellow  kimono. Sandals. Turban on head. This turban may be made from a calico  covered crown of an old derby, with red and white striped rim. He  wears many rich ornaments. Curtain chains around neck and on arms.  This costume may sometimes be borrowed from a lodge of Shriners,  Knights Templar, Royal Arch Masons or Odd Fellows.    GASPAR--Similar to Melchoir. He is a young king aged about twenty-two.  Wear white drapery on head and over it a golden (paper) crown. May  wear sword. Sandals.    BALTASAR--Old king with white hair. Long rich robe or kimono over a  cassock. Red sash. Red head drapery. Golden crown. Sandals.    ANGELS--Invisible to the audience.    PROLOGUE--Stately lady in trailing Grecian robe of white. Hair  powdered. This character should be played by a lady with distinct  dramatic ability.    NOTE.--If it is desired to simplify these costumes, kimonos, cassocks  and cottas from Episcopal choirs, draperies of sheets and couch  covers, and sandals made of a sole bound to foot with brown cloth  cords, will answer admirably in the dim blue light.    Nightgowns, dressing gowns, fur rugs, fur muffs opened, fur stoles,  opera capes, spangled tunics, window cords and chains, etc., will make  valuable substitutes for the oriental garments.
