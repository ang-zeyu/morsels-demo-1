The walls  of this room were carved with knights and their coats of arms.    [Illustration: Peterborough Cathedral--Remains of Cloisters.]    Whilst Edward was preparing for war against Scotland, he sent five  successive times to this abbey for money to assist him in carrying on  his enterprise, and Godfrey gave him in all about L500. His other gifts  and entertainments were sumptuous and large, and the sum of money which  he expended during his abbacy was L3646 4s. 3d. This remarkable man  died in 1321, after a splendid rule of twenty-two years. The value of  the monastery possessions in his time, about _Peterborough_ alone,  was L621 16s. 3d; but this sum was but a small portion of the vast  property which then belonged to the church.    Adam de Boothby was the next abbot. He entertained the king, queen, and  royal household, in the year 1327, which cost him L327 15s. Prince  Edward, with his sisters and servants, were likewise hospitably treated  at this abbey during a stay of eight weeks. Like Godfrey, Boothby was a  generous man, but the expenses which the royal family cost him and his  predecessors must have been a heavy impost upon the monastery. He died  in 1338, in the eighteenth year of his rule.    Henry de Morcot was installed in February, 1338. There is nothing of  any moment recorded of him, except that he was engaged in successful  litigation with a baron for the recovery of some church lands. He died  in 1346, having ruled eight years.    \"Henry being dead, was buried betwixt the quire and the great altar,  near unto his predecessor Adam. His grave being, in the year 1648,  opened to receive the body of John Towers, late head bishop of this  place, there was found a seal of lead (the instrument wholly consumed),  having on one side these letters thus inscribed:--'SPA SPE,' over their  several effigies; on the reverse--'CLEMENS P P VI.' (Gunton, p. 47-48).  It is probable that the instrument was some indulgence gotten at the  jubilee, which was but three years before.\"    Robert Ramsey succeeded to the abbacy in 1346, but of him nothing  particular is recorded.    Henry de Overton was Abbot in 1361, and was followed by Nicholas, who  was noted for his prudence and economy.    We now come to the rule of William Genge, who was elected in 1396, and  ruled twelve years. He was, according to Gunton the first abbot of this  monastery who was dignified with a mitre. In the supplement to Gunton's  history, it is stated \"that they put on mitres in token they had  episcopal jurisdiction, and being advanced to the dignity of barons,  and to sit in parliament which no other abbots had done.\" During his  abbacy, the church which was then situate in St. John's close, in  Boongate, was taken down, and re-erected on its present site. The cause  of this removal was the fearful inundations to which, from its  proximity to the fens, it was exposed.    Between 1408 and 1438 the monastery was presided over by John Deeping.  During his abbacy great complaints were made of the conduct of the  Monks, and the heads of the Benedictine order were summoned before the  King at Westminster, to answer the charge of abuses, which they could  not deny, but promised to reform.    Richard Ashton was appointed abbot in 1438, and ruled 33 years. He made  many visits to the neighbouring monasteries, and likewise received many  from their abbots. He granted several corrodies to persons who endowed  his abbey. One to John Delaber, bishop of St. David's, is worthy of  notice.--This John had his choice, whether to remain at _Peterburgh_  for life, and receive a pension of L32 per annum, or retreat to the  abbot's manor at Eyebury[14] with the same advantages.    There was another corrody granted to Alice Garton, the widow of Thomas  Garton, who was a benefactor to the Cathedral, and whose name is  engraved on stone, in characters of an hieroglyphic kind, over the  large painted window at the west end of the building; it is well worth  examining. It was in the year 1439 that king Henry granted a charter  unto this abbot to hold a fair \"for three days,\" commencing on St.  Matthew's day, (O.S.) in a field, (now named the Mending,) which joins  the counties of Huntingdon and Northampton together. This fair, on  account of its vicinity to the bridge, was called \"Brigge Fair,\" by  which name it is still known. Ashton was called to parliament at  Westminster, but being too infirm to attend, he deputed William  Tresham, (probably one of his monks) to appear for him. He afterwards  took the oaths of allegiance to his sovereign, at Coventry. During his  rule it is stated that 33 monks died in the monastery, and many  festivals were suspended in consequence, there not being a sufficient  number left to perform the ceremonies. This abbot made several  additions to the church; and the building at the east end, according to  Britton, was commenced by him.    Mr. Davys is of opinion that, \"though we read of no further additions  being made to the church between the time of Godfrey, (1299), and that  of abbot Ashton, much took place in this interval. Almost all the  windows of the church must have been transformed from their original  character into their present shapes, and those which escaped this  mutilation, as in the transepts and clerestory, were filled with their  present unsuitable tracery, about the conclusion of the fourteenth  century.    \"The porch, or chapel, now used as the Chapter Library, standing within  the central arch of the West Front, was probably built soon after this  time. The reason why it was erected will be evident to any one who will  examine the front carefully; for it will be seen that the clustered  column, between the northern and middle arch, leans out to a very great  extent, and were it not for the support it receives from this chapel,  very serious consequences must ensue. The whole front also leans to the  westward, though not so much so as this column. This inclination is  evidently of very early date, and probably took place shortly after the  completion of the front. This chapel was therefore added as a support  to the front; its insertion is, nevertheless, much to be regretted, as  it materially diminishes the beauty of the finest part of the  Cathedral.    \"Many alterations, and additions, seems to have taken place in this  abbey, during the time when the decorated style was prevalent in  England; and consequently between the time when the Infirmary Church  was built, and the last-mentioned structure was erected, at the west  end of the church. Of these may be mentioned, the two elegant spires on  the north and south towers of the West Front, and the great south-west  tower of the church, which has since been materially diminished in  height. The present Chapter School, which was originally the chancel of  Thomas a Becket's Chapel, was also built at this period; its nave was  taken down in the time of Abbot Genge, who presided here between the  years 1396 and 1408, and the materials were given to the inhabitants of  Peterborough to re-build their parish church with, in a more convenient  situation. The eastern and western arches of the lantern must also have  been altered into their present shape about this time, and the first  story of a tower, which, if it had been completed, would have been one  of the finest in England, built upon them: this is now remaining, and  forms all the pretence that this Cathedral can show to a central  tower.\"    Ashton resigned in 1471, to the Bishop of Lincoln, and was succeeded by  William Ramsey, in the same year, who, with the assistance of prior  Maldon, erected a \"brazen eagle\" in the church, to which the bible and  mass book were chained. This eagle is now in the choir of the  Cathedral, and used when reading the lessons. Ashton was indicted[15] in  1480, for releasing a felon from the gaol at _Peterburgh_, and  accepting a bribe for the same. He was tried and convicted, and was  obliged to find sureties for better conduct. The original judgment is  yet retained in the chapter-house; with the names of the abbot's  sureties. He died in 1496, after a rule of 25 years.    Robert Kirton was made abbot in 1496. During his rule the regulations  of the monastery were in a measure broken up; many of the monks had  become disorderly and even licentious, and one of them robbed the  shrine of St. Oswald of a number of jewels, and other valuable  articles, for the purpose of paying a woman in the town the wages of  her prostitution. Others gave themselves up to bacchanalian riots in a  neighbouring tavern, and, instead of devoting their nights to \"prayer,\"  gave themselves up to the vulgar \"company of dancers and ballad  singers.\"    These irregularities took place in the 19th year of this abbot's rule.  They were, however, speedily terminated by the Bishop of Lincoln, who,  hearing of such notorious infringements of the monastic rules, came in  person to restore those licentious members of the fraternity to their  duty.    Abbot Kirton had many contests with his tenants, \"but notwithstanding,\"  says Gunton, \"he forgat not to enlarge and beautify his monastery, for  he built that goodly building at the east end of the church, now  commonly known by the name of the new building,\"[16] wherein he placed  three altars, opposite three pair of stairs, descending from the back  of the great altar. He likewise built a chamber in the abbey house,  which is still called \"heaven-gate chamber.\" He made also a beautiful  window in the great hall \"overlooking the cloyster.\" He added many  pictures to those which were already in the chapel of St. Mary, or the  Lady's Chapel, as it is now called, all which have since been  destroyed. The gate that leads to the deanery is likewise of his  workmanship, and bears his signature in hieroglyphics, viz:"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2097"],[0,"The Sign of the Four (#5)"],[1,"have the kindness?  I have grave doubts as  to my mitral valve, if you would be so very good.  The aortic I may  rely upon, but I should value your opinion upon the mitral.\"    I listened to his heart, as requested, but was unable to find anything  amiss, save indeed that he was in an ecstasy of fear, for he shivered  from head to foot.  \"It appears to be normal,\" I said.  \"You have no  cause for uneasiness.\"    \"You will excuse my anxiety, Miss Morstan,\" he remarked, airily. \"I am  a great sufferer, and I have long had suspicions as to that valve.  I  am delighted to hear that they are unwarranted.  Had your father, Miss  Morstan, refrained from throwing a strain upon his heart, he might have  been alive now.\"    I could have struck the man across the face, so hot was I at this  callous and off-hand reference to so delicate a matter.  Miss Morstan  sat down, and her face grew white to the lips.  \"I knew in my heart  that he was dead,\" said she.    \"I can give you every information,\" said he, \"and, what is more, I can  do you justice; and I will, too, whatever Brother Bartholomew may say.  I am so glad to have your friends here, not only as an escort to you,  but also as witnesses to what I am about to do and say.  The three of  us can show a bold front to Brother Bartholomew.  But let us have no  outsiders,--no police or officials.  We can settle everything  satisfactorily among ourselves, without any interference.  Nothing  would annoy Brother Bartholomew more than any publicity.\"  He sat down  upon a low settee and blinked at us inquiringly with his weak, watery  blue eyes.    \"For my part,\" said Holmes, \"whatever you may choose to say will go no  further.\"    I nodded to show my agreement.    \"That is well!  That is well!\" said he.  \"May I offer you a glass of  Chianti, Miss Morstan?  Or of Tokay?  I keep no other wines. Shall I  open a flask?  No?  Well, then, I trust that you have no objection to  tobacco-smoke, to the mild balsamic odor of the Eastern tobacco.  I am  a little nervous, and I find my hookah an invaluable sedative.\"  He  applied a taper to the great bowl, and the smoke bubbled merrily  through the rose-water.  We sat all three in a semicircle, with our  heads advanced, and our chins upon our hands, while the strange, jerky  little fellow, with his high, shining head, puffed uneasily in the  centre.    \"When I first determined to make this communication to you,\" said he,  \"I might have given you my address, but I feared that you might  disregard my request and bring unpleasant people with you. I took the  liberty, therefore, of making an appointment in such a way that my man  Williams might be able to see you first.  I have complete confidence in  his discretion, and he had orders, if he were dissatisfied, to proceed  no further in the matter.  You will excuse these precautions, but I am  a man of somewhat retiring, and I might even say refined, tastes, and  there is nothing more unaesthetic than a policeman.  I have a natural  shrinking from all forms of rough materialism. I seldom come in contact  with the rough crowd.  I live, as you see, with some little atmosphere  of elegance around me.  I may call myself a patron of the arts.  It is  my weakness.  The landscape is a genuine Corot, and, though a  connoisseur might perhaps throw a doubt upon that Salvator Rosa, there  cannot be the least question about the Bouguereau.  I am partial to the  modern French school.\"    \"You will excuse me, Mr. Sholto,\" said Miss Morstan, \"but I am here at  your request to learn something which you desire to tell me.  It is  very late, and I should desire the interview to be as short as  possible.\"    \"At the best it must take some time,\" he answered; \"for we shall  certainly have to go to Norwood and see Brother Bartholomew.  We shall  all go and try if we can get the better of Brother Bartholomew.  He is  very angry with me for taking the course which has seemed right to me.  I had quite high words with him last night.  You cannot imagine what a  terrible fellow he is when he is angry.\"    \"If we are to go to Norwood it would perhaps be as well to start at  once,\" I ventured to remark.    He laughed until his ears were quite red.  \"That would hardly do,\" he  cried.  \"I don't know what he would say if I brought you in that sudden  way.  No, I must prepare you by showing you how we all stand to each  other. In the first place, I must tell you that there are several  points in the story of which I am myself ignorant.  I can only lay the  facts before you as far as I know them myself.    \"My father was, as you may have guessed, Major John Sholto, once of the  Indian army.  He retired some eleven years ago, and came to live at  Pondicherry Lodge in Upper Norwood.  He had prospered in India, and  brought back with him a considerable sum of money, a large collection  of valuable curiosities, and a staff of native servants.  With these  advantages he bought himself a house, and lived in great luxury.  My  twin-brother Bartholomew and I were the only children.    \"I very well remember the sensation which was caused by the  disappearance of Captain Morstan.  We read the details in the papers,  and, knowing that he had been a friend of our father's, we discussed  the case freely in his presence.  He used to join in our speculations  as to what could have happened.  Never for an instant did we suspect  that he had the whole secret hidden in his own breast,--that of all men  he alone knew the fate of Arthur Morstan.    \"We did know, however, that some mystery--some positive  danger--overhung our father.  He was very fearful of going out alone,  and he always employed two prize-fighters to act as porters at  Pondicherry Lodge.  Williams, who drove you to-night, was one of them.  He was once light-weight champion of England.  Our father would never  tell us what it was he feared, but he had a most marked aversion to men  with wooden legs.  On one occasion he actually fired his revolver at a  wooden-legged man, who proved to be a harmless tradesman canvassing for  orders.  We had to pay a large sum to hush the matter up.  My brother  and I used to think this a mere whim of my father's, but events have  since led us to change our opinion.    \"Early in 1882 my father received a letter from India which was a great  shock to him.  He nearly fainted at the breakfast-table when he opened  it, and from that day he sickened to his death. What was in the letter  we could never discover, but I could see as he held it that it was  short and written in a scrawling hand. He had suffered for years from  an enlarged spleen, but he now became rapidly worse, and towards the  end of April we were informed that he was beyond all hope, and that he  wished to make a last communication to us.    \"When we entered his room he was propped up with pillows and breathing  heavily.  He besought us to lock the door and to come upon either side  of the bed.  Then, grasping our hands, he made a remarkable statement  to us, in a voice which was broken as much by emotion as by pain.  I  shall try and give it to you in his own very words.    \"'I have only one thing,' he said, 'which weighs upon my mind at this  supreme moment.  It is my treatment of poor Morstan's orphan.  The  cursed greed which has been my besetting sin through life has withheld  from her the treasure, half at least of which should have been hers.  And yet I have made no use of it myself,--so blind and foolish a thing  is avarice.  The mere feeling of possession has been so dear to me that  I could not bear to share it with another.  See that chaplet dipped  with pearls beside the quinine-bottle.  Even that I could not bear to  part with, although I had got it out with the design of sending it to  her. You, my sons, will give her a fair share of the Agra treasure. But  send her nothing--not even the chaplet--until I am gone. After all, men  have been as bad as this and have recovered.    \"'I will tell you how Morstan died,' he continued.  'He had suffered  for years from a weak heart, but he concealed it from every one.  I  alone knew it.  When in India, he and I, through a remarkable chain of  circumstances, came into possession of a considerable treasure.  I  brought it over to England, and on the night of Morstan's arrival he  came straight over here to claim his share.  He walked over from the  station, and was admitted by my faithful Lal Chowdar, who is now dead.  Morstan and I had a difference of opinion as to the division of the  treasure, and we came to heated words.  Morstan had sprung out of his  chair in a paroxysm of anger, when he suddenly pressed his hand to his  side, his face turned a dusky hue, and he fell backwards, cutting his  head against the corner of the treasure-chest.  When I stooped over him  I found, to my horror, that he was dead.    \"'For a long time I sat half distracted, wondering what I should do.  My first impulse was, of course, to call for assistance; but I could  not but recognize that there was every chance that I would be accused  of his murder.  His death at the moment of a quarrel, and the gash in  his head, would be black against me. Again, an official inquiry could  not be made without bringing out some facts about the treasure, which I  was particularly anxious to keep secret. He had told me that no soul  upon earth knew where he had gone.  There seemed to be no necessity why  any soul ever should know.    \"'I was still pondering over the matter, when, looking up, I saw my  servant, Lal Chowdar, in the doorway.  He stole in and bolted the door  behind him.  \"Do not fear, Sahib,\" he said.  \"No one need know that you  have killed him.  Let us hide him away, and who is the wiser?\" \"I did  not kill him,\" said I.  Lal Chowdar shook his head and smiled.  \"I  heard it all, Sahib,\" said he.  \"I heard you quarrel, and I heard the  blow.  But my lips are sealed. All are asleep in the house.  Let us put  him away together.\" That was enough to decide"]]]
