[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19042"],[0,"Animal Figures in the Maya Codices (#5)"],[1,"are seen, and in figs. 4, 6, the  anthropomorphic tendency is further shown by providing the insect with  two pairs of limbs each with four or five digits, and a conventionalized  face, eyes and mouth. In Pl. 2, fig. 1, the bee is represented without  mouthparts but antennae only. This may indicate a drone or a queen bee  that takes no active part in the work of gathering honey or making comb.  Fig. 2 is perhaps the least reduced of any of the figures and shows the  worker bee with antennae and mouthparts.    The so-called \"cloud balls\" of the day sign _Cauac_ (Pl. 2, fig. 8) may  represent the honey comb. _Cauac_ is usually supposed to have some  connection with lightening[TN-6] and thunder although Valentini agrees with  the authors in associating _Cauac_ with the bees and honey. The  _Cauac_-like forms in Pl. 2, figs. 7, 10, have been described above as  hives. The representation of legs in the full drawing of a bee as four  large limbs, an anterior and a posterior pair, coupled with the method  of drawing the insect as seen from above and in front, may have led to  its final expression by an X-shaped mark shown in connection with the  hives (Pl. 2, figs. 7, 10). The X is also seen in the day sign _Cauac_.    Apiculture was common among the various peoples of Central America and  Mexico. Las Casas speaks of hives of bees and Gomara states that the  bees were small and the honey rather bitter. Clavigero (Vol. 1, p.  68)[300-*] mentions six varieties of bees which were found in  Mexico;--the first is the same as the common bee of Europe, the second  differs from the first only in having no sting and is the bee of Yucatan  and Chiapas which makes the fine clear honey of aromatic flavor. The  third species resembles in its form the winged ants but is smaller than  the common bee and without a sting. The fourth is a yellow bee, smaller  than the common one but, like it, furnished with a sting. The fifth is a  small bee without a sting which constructs hives of an orbicular form in  subterranean cavities and the honey is sour and somewhat bitter. The  _Tlalpipiolli_, which is the sixth species, is black and yellow, of the  size of the common bee, but has no sting.    The natives of the country at the present time often cultivate hives of  bees in logs which they hollow out for this purpose and keep in a  specially constructed shelter. It is, however, rather the ceremonial  side of apiculture that is the interesting feature and this is clearly  emphasized in the Tro-Cortesianus. The section in this manuscript (80b,  103-112), as has been noted, is taken up almost exclusively with the  culture of the bee and in all probability represents a definite  religious ceremony or series of rites which are connected intimately  with bees and honey. Landa (1864, p. 292)[300-[+]] states that in the  month _Tzoz_ the natives prepare for a ceremony in behalf of the bees  which takes place in the following month, _Tzec_. In the month _Mol_  another fiesta is undertaken in behalf of these insects so that the  gods may provide an abundance of flowers for the bees (Landa, 1864, p.  306).[301-*]    It seems clear therefore that we have represented in the pages of the  Tro-Cortesianus referred to, the rites carried out in this connection.  The more or less realistic drawings of the bees (Pl. 2, figs. 1-6, 9)  represent the god of the bees and to him offerings of food and incense  are being made. Pl. 2, fig. 11, shows the war god (M) with his eagle  head-dress offering a mass of honey in the comb to the god of the bees.    Curiously enough the bee does not seem to be represented in the Dresden  Codex. Foerstemann's identification of the head-dress of the goddess in  Dresden 9a as a bee does not seem to us to be correct.    In addition to the bees, there occurs in the Nuttall Codex 4 (Pl. 3,  fig. 4) a curious representation of an insect with a pointed beak-like  structure and a spine at the posterior extremity of its human-like body.  It is engaged in apparent conflict with a man and may represent a  hornet.    BLOW-FLY (_Sarcophaga_). Two figures in the Tro-Cortesianus (Pl. 3,  figs. 1, 2) are of special interest since they appear to have been  frequently regarded as picturing snakes attacking men. These are  thick-bodied sinuous creatures distinguished by the curious conformation  of the mouth and by a lateral row of dots that may represent the  metameric spiracles or, as commonly, a demarcation between dorsal and  ventral surfaces. That these are maggots of a blow-fly (_Sarcophaga_)  there can be little doubt, not only on account of their mouth parts  which are similar to those of the agave maggot (see later) but also  because of their relation to God F whom they are devouring. The latter  in fig. 1 is doubtless dead as shown by the closed eye and it is the  habit of the blow-fly to deposit its eggs in the nasal cavity of dead  animals as well as elsewhere on the body. The fact that in each case a  maggot is attacking the god's nose may indicate that this habit was  known to the artist who, consequently, shows the larvae in this  position. In Pl. 3, fig. 2, the god's eye is not closed but his passive  attitude while the maggot devours his hand and nose does not indicate  that he is in full possession of his strength. In addition to the  blow-fly, a screw-fly (_Chrysomyia_) lays its eggs on the bodies of  animals, often on persons sleeping, and these may hatch almost at once  into small maggots that penetrate the skin. It may be, therefore, that  the larvae here considered belong to this genus.    In addition to god F, in Tro-Cortesianus 24d, there is another  representation of the same god being attacked by a vulture. This bird is  evidently eating his nose. In this case the god is shown with the closed  eye as in 27d. In Tro-Cortesianus 25d the fly seems to be attacking the  mouth of god F. From the fact that no other god is ever found in this  connection it may be suggested that there may be some relation between  god F as a god of human sacrifice and the fact that his dead body is  being eaten by blow-flies and vultures. A portion of the body of the  person sacrificed was usually eaten by those taking part in the  ceremony.    LEPIDOPTEROUS INSECTS. In Tro-Cortesianus 28c (Pl. 3, fig. 3) is shown a  second insect larva with curiously formed mouth parts. It is represented  as attacking agave which is springing from the ground as shown by the  _Caban_ signs in the codex. Hough (1908, p. 591) has shown this to be  the larva of _Acentrocneme kollari_ Felder, \"called by the Mexicans  _guson_, and in Nahuatl _mescuillin_.\" This grub, he says, is white,  about an inch long, and tunnels the fleshy leaves of the agave. It is  greatly prized as an article of food for \"_gusones_ to this day are  collected in April, boiled, wrapped in the epidermis of the agave, sold  on the streets of Mexico, and are eaten with avidity. To all appearances  they are nourishing and palatable, and it is said that connoisseurs  prefer them to oysters or swallows' nests.\" Hough believes \"that the  discovery of the sap-yielding quality of the agave was through search  for these larvae.\"    In the Nuttall Codex occur numerous representations of insects, some of  which appear to represent butterflies or moths (Pl. 3, figs. 5-8) but  these are quite unidentifiable. That shown in fig. 6 is colored blue in  the original, while the others are of various colors. Possibly the round  markings on the wings in figs. 5, 8, represent the ocelli on the wings  of certain species of moths. In this connection, too, it is interesting  to compare the conventionalized butterfly with its single eye and  pointed antennae from the Aubin manuscript (Pl. 3, fig. 9) with one  drawn on the same plan from the Nuttall Codex (Pl. 3, fig. 8).      MYRIAPODA    Representations of a centipede (probably a species of _Scolopendra_)  occur in the Dresden Codex and in several others examined. That shown in  Pl. 5, fig. 1, from the Vaticanus 3773, is perhaps the least  conventionalized.[303-*] This figure appears partly to encircle a  temple, behind which the major portion of its length is hidden and hence  is not here shown. The bipartite structure coming from the animal's head  doubtless represents the mouthparts, and at its base on either side  arise antennae. The first pair only of legs is shown with a pinching  claw, possibly intended as a conventionalized hand, while the rest are  simple. The plumes decorating the posterior extremity are of course  extraneous and represent the tail of the quetzal or trogon.    In the Dresden Codex, god D constantly appears in connection with a  head-dress from which depends a centipede, greatly reduced and  conventionalized. Two forms of this centipede are shown in Pl. 3, figs.  15, 18. The body appears to consist of four or five segments each with  its pair of ambulatory appendages (though there may not always be the  same number of each) terminated by a circular segment with a  conventionalized three-knobbed structure, apparently corresponding to  the portion that bears the quetzal plume in Pl. 5, fig. 1. The outline  of the head in Pl. 3, fig. 15, is shown in dotted line but by solid line  in fig. 18. One of the antennae appears to be omitted from the former  figure, also, but both are present in the latter. The insect-like head  is made on much the same plan as that of the bee (Pl. 2, fig. 11), the  facial portion divided by a median line into a right and a left half  with a small triangle below for a mouth. The eyes, however, instead of  being circular like those of the bee are made as narrow elongated  projections extending inward from the dorsal margin of the facial disc.    The glyphs for god D in Dresden 7b (Pl. 3, fig. 11), Dresden 7c, and  Dresden 14b (Pl. 3, fig. 12) undoubtedly show three forms of the sign  for god D, only one of which (fig. 12) is given by Schellhas (1904, p.  22) among the signs of this god. In each of these cases the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19053"],[0,"Theory of Circulation (#5)"],[1,"was appointed by the convention to report on  my theory. They reported favorably to the succeeding convention at  Buffalo, which adopted the report, and I published and circulated it.  This committee I had been allowed to choose, and it consisted of my  friend, Prof. Twiss--the first believer in the theory--and Mr. Fellows,  that Professor of Natural Philosophy, who formerly assisted in making my  apparatus.    Mr. Fellows carried the report to Buffalo, and when he read it in the  convention, editors immediately came to him to request copies for the  press. But, by the influence of physicians, they afterwards declined it  when offered. It seemed to be the general plan of the regular faculty  (in the Eastern, not the Western, States) to put the theory into a  condition resembling the algide state of cholera, where it would die of  coldness; but, by the aid of Divine Providence, it will, like its  author, restore itself by its own inherent vitality--the vitality of  immortal truth.      SECTION IV.    Proofs from Dr. Cartwright's Great Experiments on      Alligators--Resuscitation of Dr. Ely's Child--Dr. Bowling, Editor of      the Nashville Medical Journal, endorses Dr. Washington, who, in that      journal, \"crushes out\" all Opposition to the Theory--Dr. Draper's      Acknowledgment of it in New York--Homoeopathists--Conclusion.    TO DR. MARCY. Thus, for thirty years, had I maintained, not only without  public support, but against discouragements, these great truths, of  which I had been allowed for myself such life-giving evidence. But early  in December, 1851, Dr. Cartwright, then of New Orleans, announced in a  letter to me that he had publicly become my advocate. His name will ever  be connected with the theory, on account of the remarkable experiments  by which he demonstrated its truth. In the presence of eminent  physicians, and other scientific persons, he resuscitated an alligator  which had been killed by tying the trachea. After an hour, when neither  fire nor the dissecting knife produced signs of pain, Dr. Dowler[7] laid  bare the lungs and the heart. Then a hole was cut in the trachea, below  the ligature, and a blow-pipe was introduced, which Professor Forshey[7]  worked with violence. At length, a faint quivering of moving blood was  seen in the diaphanous veins of the lungs. The inflating process being  continued, the blood next began to run in streams from the lungs into  the quiescent heart. The heart began first to quiver, then to pulsate;  and signs of life elsewhere appearing, the animal began to move; and  soon, strong men could not hold him. Again they bound him to the table,  and kept the trachea tied until life was apparently extinct; when, again  inflating his lungs, he so thoroughly revived that he became dangerous,  snapping at everything, and breaking his cords. For the third time, the  trachea was ligatured--the animal expired, and was resuscitated.    Dr. Cartwright says in his letter to me, published in the Boston Medical  Journal, January 7th, 1852, \"By this resuscitation, your theory of the  motive power of the circulation of the blood was established beyond all  doubt or dispute.\" \"This vivisection clearly proved that the _primum  mobile_ of the circulation, and the chief motive powers of the blood,  are in the lungs, and not in the heart.\" Dr. Cartwright mentioned, in  the same letter, a case in which his faith in my theory had saved the  life of a breathless infant--inducing him to unwonted perseverance in  inflating its lungs.    Able opposers to the theory, however, arose in New Orleans, some of whom  believed that the resuscitation might have been effected by applications  to the nerves. Dr. Cartwright procured, from Gen. Jackson's battle  ground, another alligator, which was publicly killed and vivisected. The  doctor's opponents first tried their means to bring the animal to life,  and failed. Then he, by artificial respiration, restored the huge  reptile as before;--thus proving that artificial respiration could  restore suspended animation when nothing else could.    Dr. Ely was one who had opposed and written against the theory. In the  meantime, his infant son had cholera, and expired. His medical friends  had left him, and crape was tied to the handle of the front door.  Standing by the side of his lifeless babe, Dr. Ely said to himself, \"If  this theory should be true, I might yet save my child.\" And profiting by  the example of Dr. Cartwright in restoring the dead alligator, he  restored his child to life. Remitting his efforts too soon--again the  infant ceased to breathe. And again, and yet the third time, the father  restored him--when the resuscitation proved complete; and months after,  the child was living and in perfect health. Dr. Ely then came promptly  forward, and, like a nobly honest man, reported the case as convincing  evidence of a truth which he had formerly opposed.[8]    Whoever wishes to know the history of theories concerning the motive  powers of the blood as they then stood, may learn them by looking over  files of the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal, edited by Dr. J. V. C.  Smith, for the years 1852-'53, and a part of 1854. Dr. Cartwright wrote  for it during those years; and, encouraged by his protection, I  frequently answered objections, which flowed in from various medical  opponents. The objection derived from the foetal circulation, I answered  thus, in the Journal, of May, 1852: \"The change occurring at birth, so  far from falsifying this theory, affords presumptive proof of its truth.  When first the air enters the trachea of a new born infant, and animal  combustion begins, the inflation of the lungs must open the vessels and  vesicles prepared to receive the venous blood. To fill the new-made  vacuum, the whole of the blood from the right ventricle rushes through  the pulmonary tube, leaving none to go through the _ductus arteriosus_,  thus made useless, and henceforth to be abolished. But what is to move  the blood from the capillaries of the lungs? The heart's force,  insufficient before without aid from the mother's respiration, is now  divided, while its work is doubled. A new power must then be generated  by the meeting of the air with the carbon of the blood, enkindled by the  peculiar functional vitality of the lungs. Without such a power, no  perceptible cause exists sufficient to move the blood onward to the left  ventricle. But it is moved thither, and with a power which presses down  and closes the valve of the _foramen ovale_, thus clearly manifesting  that this current exceeds in force that in the right ventricle. Grant  that the new function of respiration has furnished a new power, and this  astonishing instantaneous metamorphosis from amphibious to mammalian  life becomes perfectly intelligible, and the wisdom of the Creator is  fully vindicated; showing that His work has been truly interpreted.\"    In the _Boston Journal_, of April 21st, 1852, is an article from  Dr. Cartwright, entitled \"Confirmation of the Willardian, or Important  American Discovery,\" in which the author endeavors to remove what  doubtless has been one cause of the delay in acknowledging its truth.  \"Those members of the profession,\" he says, \"whom science has only  _perfumed_, are the most apt 'to look down with proud disdain' on any  discovery originating 'with individuals not indoctrinated.' They do not  make the proper distinction between selfish quacks who seek publicity  'to line the pocket,' and those 'who, prompted by some mysterious  power,' come forward against their interest, and at the risk of their  reputation. 'Rather than to contemn and ridicule, it were better to  study the manifestations of that mysterious power.' They do not consider  that the truth thus brought to light, while they fail to acknowledge it,  is affording 'to selfish quackery' a capital to trade on.\"    To the same effect is the advice given to the profession by Dr. B. F.  Washington, of Hannibal, Mo. He says, in the Nashville _Journal of  Medicine_, July, 1854, \"it is time for us to be acting; the honor of the  profession is in danger. The theory of respiration is a truth which will  cut its way; and if we do not take it up and teach it, in a few years we  may see the mortifying spectacle of the community teaching the  profession scientific truths. Quacks have already taken it up, and we  have inhalers and air cures of various kinds.\"[9]    The first appearance of Dr. Washington as the advocate of my theory was  in the _Nashville Journal_, March, 1854; and his fertile genius had  there brought a new illustration of its truth. It had, he said, opened  his eyes to the explanation of a fact which had puzzled him from his  boyhood. \"In slaughtering animals, if the trachea was cut, scarcely any  haemorrhage resulted; while, if that was left untouched, full haemorrhage  occurred. By the Willardian theory, the fact is readily susceptible of  explanation. The blood, filling the trachea, suspended respiration, and  of course the impelling power of the blood was suspended, and the  haemorrhage ceased. The engine could not work without steam. When the  trachea was not cut, respiration went on, and kept up the circulation,  until the animal was nearly exsanguineous, and the powers of life gave  way.\" This fact was clearly ascertained by Dr. W. K. Bowling, the  well-known editor of the _Nashville Journal_, and able professor of the  theory and practice of medicine in the university of that place. He sent  me the Journal containing this welcome endorsement of my theory from one  who was, as Dr. Bowling assured me, \"an observer of superior tact and  learning,\" known by his medical compositions as well in Europe as  America. Since that time (March, 1854), that Journal, though not  excluding articles which oppose, has been understood to be in favor of  the theory. Dr. Washington has written repeatedly, answering all  objections;[10] and he has, in the Journal ("]]]
