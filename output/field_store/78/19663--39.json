He did stand there!--but high  up, beyond the lawn and at the very top of the tower to which, on that  first morning, little Flora had conducted me. This tower was one of  a pair--square, incongruous, crenelated structures--that were  distinguished, for some reason, though I could see little difference,  as the new and the old. They flanked opposite ends of the house and were  probably architectural absurdities, redeemed in a measure indeed by  not being wholly disengaged nor of a height too pretentious, dating, in  their gingerbread antiquity, from a romantic revival that was already a  respectable past. I admired them, had fancies about them, for we could  all profit in a degree, especially when they loomed through the dusk,  by the grandeur of their actual battlements; yet it was not at such an  elevation that the figure I had so often invoked seemed most in place.    It produced in me, this figure, in the clear twilight, I remember, two  distinct gasps of emotion, which were, sharply, the shock of my first  and that of my second surprise. My second was a violent perception of  the mistake of my first: the man who met my eyes was not the person  I had precipitately supposed. There came to me thus a bewilderment of  vision of which, after these years, there is no living view that I can  hope to give. An unknown man in a lonely place is a permitted object  of fear to a young woman privately bred; and the figure that faced me  was--a few more seconds assured me--as little anyone else I knew as  it was the image that had been in my mind. I had not seen it in  Harley Street--I had not seen it anywhere. The place, moreover, in the  strangest way in the world, had, on the instant, and by the very fact of  its appearance, become a solitude. To me at least, making my statement  here with a deliberation with which I have never made it, the whole  feeling of the moment returns. It was as if, while I took in--what I did  take in--all the rest of the scene had been stricken with death. I can  hear again, as I write, the intense hush in which the sounds of evening  dropped. The rooks stopped cawing in the golden sky, and the friendly  hour lost, for the minute, all its voice. But there was no other change  in nature, unless indeed it were a change that I saw with a stranger  sharpness. The gold was still in the sky, the clearness in the air,  and the man who looked at me over the battlements was as definite as a  picture in a frame. That's how I thought, with extraordinary quickness,  of each person that he might have been and that he was not. We were  confronted across our distance quite long enough for me to ask myself  with intensity who then he was and to feel, as an effect of my inability  to say, a wonder that in a few instants more became intense.    The great question, or one of these, is, afterward, I know, with regard  to certain matters, the question of how long they have lasted. Well,  this matter of mine, think what you will of it, lasted while I caught at  a dozen possibilities, none of which made a difference for the better,  that I could see, in there having been in the house--and for how long,  above all?--a person of whom I was in ignorance. It lasted while I  just bridled a little with the sense that my office demanded that there  should be no such ignorance and no such person. It lasted while this  visitant, at all events--and there was a touch of the strange freedom,  as I remember, in the sign of familiarity of his wearing no hat--seemed  to fix me, from his position, with just the question, just the scrutiny  through the fading light, that his own presence provoked. We were too  far apart to call to each other, but there was a moment at which, at  shorter range, some challenge between us, breaking the hush, would have  been the right result of our straight mutual stare. He was in one of the  angles, the one away from the house, very erect, as it struck me, and  with both hands on the ledge. So I saw him as I see the letters I  form on this page; then, exactly, after a minute, as if to add to the  spectacle, he slowly changed his place--passed, looking at me hard  all the while, to the opposite corner of the platform. Yes, I had the  sharpest sense that during this transit he never took his eyes from me,  and I can see at this moment the way his hand, as he went, passed from  one of the crenelations to the next. He stopped at the other corner, but  less long, and even as he turned away still markedly fixed me. He turned  away; that was all I knew.          IV      It was not that I didn't wait, on this occasion, for more, for I was  rooted as deeply as I was shaken. Was there a \"secret\" at Bly--a mystery  of Udolpho or an insane, an unmentionable relative kept in unsuspected  confinement? I can't say how long I turned it over, or how long, in  a confusion of curiosity and dread, I remained where I had had my  collision; I only recall that when I re-entered the house darkness had  quite closed in. Agitation, in the interval, certainly had held me and  driven me, for I must, in circling about the place, have walked three  miles; but I was to be, later on, so much more overwhelmed that this  mere dawn of alarm was a comparatively human chill. The most singular  part of it, in fact--singular as the rest had been--was the part I  became, in the hall, aware of in meeting Mrs. Grose. This picture comes  back to me in the general train--the impression, as I received it on my  return, of the wide white panelled space, bright in the lamplight and  with its portraits and red carpet, and of the good surprised look of  my friend, which immediately told me she had missed me. It came to  me straightway, under her contact, that, with plain heartiness, mere  relieved anxiety at my appearance, she knew nothing whatever that could  bear upon the incident I had there ready for her. I had not suspected  in advance that her comfortable face would pull me up, and I somehow  measured the importance of what I had seen by my thus finding myself  hesitate to mention it. Scarce anything in the whole history seems to  me so odd as this fact that my real beginning of fear was one, as I  may say, with the instinct of sparing my companion. On the spot,  accordingly, in the pleasant hall and with her eyes on me, I, for  a reason that I couldn't then have phrased, achieved an inward  resolution--offered a vague pretext for my lateness and, with the plea  of the beauty of the night and of the heavy dew and wet feet, went as  soon as possible to my room.    Here it was another affair; here, for many days after, it was a queer  affair enough. There were hours, from day to day--or at least there were  moments, snatched even from clear duties--when I had to shut myself up  to think. It was not so much yet that I was more nervous than I could  bear to be as that I was remarkably afraid of becoming so; for the truth  I had now to turn over was, simply and clearly, the truth that I could  arrive at no account whatever of the visitor with whom I had been so  inexplicably and yet, as it seemed to me, so intimately concerned. It  took little time to see that I could sound without forms of inquiry  and without exciting remark any domestic complications. The shock I had  suffered must have sharpened all my senses; I felt sure, at the end of  three days and as the result of mere closer attention, that I had not  been practiced upon by the servants nor made the object of any \"game.\"  Of whatever it was that I knew, nothing was known around me. There was  but one sane inference: someone had taken a liberty rather gross. That  was what, repeatedly, I dipped into my room and locked the door to say  to myself. We had been, collectively, subject to an intrusion; some  unscrupulous traveler, curious in old houses, had made his way in  unobserved, enjoyed the prospect from the best point of view, and then  stolen out as he came. If he had given me such a bold hard stare, that  was but a part of his indiscretion. The good thing, after all, was that  we should surely see no more of him.    This was not so good a thing, I admit, as not to leave me to judge that  what, essentially, made nothing else much signify was simply my charming  work. My charming work was just my life with Miles and Flora, and  through nothing could I so like it as through feeling that I could throw  myself into it in trouble. The attraction of my small charges was a  constant joy, leading me to wonder afresh at the vanity of my original  fears, the distaste I had begun by entertaining for the probable gray  prose of my office. There was to be no gray prose, it appeared, and no  long grind; so how could work not be charming that presented itself as  daily beauty? It was all the romance of the nursery and the poetry of  the schoolroom. I don't mean by this, of course, that we studied  only fiction and verse; I mean I can express no otherwise the sort  of interest my companions inspired. How can I describe that except by  saying that instead of growing used to them--and it's a marvel for a  governess: I call the sisterhood to witness!--I made constant fresh  discoveries. There was one direction, assuredly, in which these  discoveries stopped: deep obscurity continued to cover the region of the  boy's conduct at school. It had been promptly given me, I have noted,  to face that mystery without a pang. Perhaps even it would be nearer the  truth to say that--without a word--he himself had cleared it up. He had  made the whole charge absurd. My conclusion bloomed there with the  real rose flush of his innocence: he was only too fine and fair for the  little horrid, unclean school world, and he had paid a price for it. I  reflected acutely that the sense of such differences, such superiorities  of quality, always, on the part of the majority--which could include  even stupid, sordid headmasters--turn infallibly to the vindictive.    Both the children had a gentleness (it was their "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20906"],[0,"The Journal of Negro History, Volume 3, 1918 (#5)"],[1,"also of Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton  Hart, R. C. L. Bevan, and Professor Fowler. But he was then the hero  of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin.\" The English people had read of him. They then  wanted to see him. He spoke at the Victoria Park Tabernacle and held  in London a farewell meeting in Spurgeon's Tabernacle. The buildings  were thronged to their utmost capacity and eager crowds on the outside  made desperate efforts to see him. He was then called to Scotland that  the people farther north might also see this hero. Just as Henson  reached Edinburgh the crowning honor of his life was to come. He  received a telegram from Queen Victoria inviting him to visit her the  following day. After addressing an unusually large audience, Henson  proceeded immediately to London. The next day he and his wife were  dined by a group of distinguished gentlemen and were then taken to  Windsor Castle, where they were presented to Queen Victoria. Her  majesty informed him that he had known of him ever since she was a  little girl. She expressed her surprise at seeing him look so  different from what she had imagined he would. She briefly discussed  with him the state of affairs in Canada, and in bidding him and his  wife farewell expressed her wish for his continued prosperity, gave  him a token of her respect and esteem, consisting of a full length  cabinet photograph of herself in an elegant easel frame of gold.    On his return to the United States Henson visited the old plantation  in Montgomery County near Rockville, Maryland, finding his old  master's wife still living. He then proceeded to Washington to see  again the old haunts which he frequented when serving as the market  man of his plantation. While in the National Capital he went to the  White House to call on his Excellency President Hayes, who chatted  with him about his trip across the sea while Mrs. Hayes showed  Henson's wife through the executive mansion. When he left the  President extended him a cordial invitation to call to see him again.  This was the last thing of note in his life. He returned to his home  in Canada and resumed the best he could the work he was prosecuting,  but old age and sickness overtook him and he passed away in 1881 in  the ninety-second year of his life.                                       W. B. HARTGROVE      FOOTNOTES:    [1] On account of ill health Mr. W. B. Hartgrove, who was preparing  this article, had to turn over his unfinished manuscript to the  editor, who completed it. The story is based on the \"_Life of Josiah  Henson_,\" \"_Father Henson's Story of His Own Life_\" and \"_Uncle Tom's  Story of His Life_.\"--THE EDITOR.    [2] Henson, \"_Uncle Tom's Story of his Life_,\" p. 15.    [3] Henson, \"_Uncle Tom's own Story of his Life_,\" p. 53.    [4] Henson gives this interesting conversation:    \"How far is it to Canada?\" He gave me a peculiar look, and in a minute  I saw he knew all. \"Want to go to Canada? Come along with us, then.  Our captain's a fine fellow. We're going to Buffalo.\" \"Buffalo; how  far is that from Canada?\" \"Don't you know, man? Just across the  river.\" I now opened my mind frankly to him, and told him about my  wife and children. \"I'll speak to the captain,\" said he. He did so,  and in a moment the captain took me aside, and said, \"The Doctor says  you want to go to Buffalo with your family.\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Well why not  go with me?\" was his frank reply. \"Doctor says you've got a family.\"  \"Yes, sir.\" \"Where do you stop?\" \"About a mile back.\" \"How long have  you been here.\" \"No time,\" I answered, after a moment's hesitation.  \"Come, my good fellow, tell us all about it. You're running away,  ain't you?\" Henson saw that he was a friend, and opened his heart to  him. \"How long will it take you to get ready?\" \"Be here in half an  hour, sir.\" \"Well go along and get them.\" Off I started; but, before I  had run fifty feet, he called me back. \"Stop,\" said he; \"you go on  getting the grain in. When we get off, I'll lay to over opposite that  island, and send a boat back. There's a lot of regular nigger-catchers  in the town below, and they might suspect if you brought your party  out of the bush by daylight.\" I worked away with a will. Soon the two  or three hundred bushels of corn were aboard, the hatches fastened  down, the anchor raised, and the sails hoisted. I watched the vessel  with intense interest as she left her moorings. Away she went before  the free breeze. Already she seemed beyond the spot at which the  captain agreed to lay to, and still she flew along. My heart sank  within me; so near deliverance, and again to have my hopes blasted,  again to be cast on my own resources. I felt that they had been making  a mock of my misery. The sun had sunk to rest, and the purple and gold  of the west were fading away into gray. Suddenly, however, as I gazed  with weary heart the vessel swung round into the wind, the sails  flapped, and she stood motionless. A moment more, and a boat was  lowered from her stern, and with steady stroke made for the point at  which I stood. I felt that my hour of release had come. On she came,  and in ten minutes she rode up handsomely on the beach. My black  friend and two sailors jumped out, and we started on at once for my  wife and children. To my horror, they were gone from the place where I  left them. Overpowered with fear, I supposed they had been found and  carried off. There was no time to lose, and the men told me I would  have to go alone. Just at the point of despair, however, I stumbled on  one of the children. My wife it seemed, alarmed at my long absence,  had given up all for lost, and supposed I had fallen into the hands of  the enemy. When she heard my voice, mingled with those of the others,  she thought my captors were leading me back to make me discover my  family, and in the extremity of her terror she had tried to hide  herself. I had hard work to satisfy her. Our long habits of  concealment and anxiety had rendered her suspicious of every one; and  her agitation was so great that for a time she was incapable of  understanding what I said, and went on in a sort of paroxysm of  distress and fear. This, however, was soon over, and the kindness of  my companions did much to facilitate the matter.\"--Father Henson's  Story of his own Life, p. 121.    [5] Henson, \"_Uncle Tom's Story of his Life_,\" p. 162.    [6] Years thereafter when taking dinner with a distinguished gentleman  in London the thought of enjoying such privileges while his only  brother was in slavery dawned suddenly and impressed itself so  forcefully upon him that he immediately arose from the table, unable  to eat. He soon returned to America and at once proceeded to devise  means to free his brother. Mr. William Chaplain, of New York, had  repeatedly urged him to flee by way of the underground railroad, but  he was so demoralized and stultified by slavery that he would not make  an effort. Mr. Chaplain made a second effort to induce him to escape  but he still refused. Henson finally arranged to sell the narrative of  his life to secure funds for his liberation. The book sold well in New  England and the requisite four hundred dollars being raised his  brother was freed and enabled to join him in Canada.--Father Henson's  _Story of his own Life_, pp. 209-212.    [7] _Liberator_, April 11, 1851.          ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING AND THE NEGRO      Elizabeth Barrett Browning was a poetic artist who was intensely  concerned with the large human movements of the world and the age into  which she was thrown. Her whole life was one great heart-throb. While  the condition of her health and the nature of her early training were  such as to cultivate her rather bookish and romantic temperament, she  followed with eagerness the great social reforms in England in the  reign of William IV and the early years of Victoria; and _The Cry of  the Children_ and _The Cry of the Human_ indicated what was to be one  of her chief lines of interest. In her later years she threw herself  heart and soul into the cause of Italian independence and unity,  welcoming Napoleon III as a benefactor. Her political judgment was not  always sound: her distinguished husband could not possibly follow her  in her admiration for Napoleon, whom he regarded as to some extent at  least a charlatan, and Cavour simply represented his countrymen in his  amazement and chagrin at the terms of the Peace of Villafranca;  nevertheless the great heart of Elizabeth Barrett Browning was ever  moved by the demands of liberty, whether the immediate impulse was a  child in the sweatshops of England, an Italian wishing to be free of  Austria, or the exiled Victor Hugo, and there was no exaggeration in  the tribute placed on the wall of Casa Guidi after her death:              Qui scrisse e mori       Elizabetta Barrett Browning     che in cuore di donna conciliava    scienza di dotto e spirito di poeta     e fece del suo verso aureo anello         fra Italia e Inghilterra            pone questa lapide              Firenze grata                 1861[8]    To such a woman the Negro, held in slavery in a great free republic,  made a ready appeal. The first concrete connection, however, was one  directly affecting the fortunes of the Barrett family. For some years  Mr. Barrett had made his home at a beautiful estate in Herefordshire  known as Hope End. He had inherited from his maternal grandfather a  large estate in Jamaica, where the families of both his parents had  been established for two or three generations. The abolition of  slavery in the British colonies in 1833 inflicted great financial  embarrassment upon him, as a result of which he was forced to sell  Hope End and to remove his family, first to Sidmouth in Devonshire,  and subsequently to London. Elizabeth Barrett foreshadowed this change  of fortunes in a letter to her friend Mrs. Martin dated Sidmouth, May  27, 1833:         The West Indians are irreparably ruined if the Bill passes.
