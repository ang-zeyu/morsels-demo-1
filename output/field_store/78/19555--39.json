In order that these future tasks may be carried out with dispatch,  efficiency, harmony and in strict accordance with the administrative and  spiritual principles of our Faith, the Latin American promoters of the  present Seven Year Plan must focus their attention on the requirements of  the present hour, close their ranks, reinforce the bonds of unity, of  solidarity and of cooperation which unite them, rededicate themselves  individually to the sacred, all-important and vital task of teaching,  exert strenuous endeavors to deepen their knowledge of the history and  fundamentals of their Faith, steep themselves in the spirit and the love  of its teachings and acquire special training for future pioneer activity  throughout the length and breadth of the vast stretches of territory which  extend from the confines of the great republic in the north to the Straits  of Magellan in the south.    The process of the steady multiplication of spiritual assemblies, already  numbering thirty-seven, of groups whose number equals that of the  assemblies, and of the forty localities where isolated believers reside,  must vigorously and uninterruptedly continue. The incorporation of  well-grounded spiritual assemblies, following the example set by the  spiritual assemblies of San Jose, Costa Rica, of Bogota, Colombia, and of  Asuncion, Paraguay, as a preliminary to the incorporation of the future  national assemblies to be established in Latin America, must be  strenuously and efficiently carried out. A beginning, however modest,  should be made in the direction of establishing local Funds, supported by  native believers and designed to supplement the financial assistance  extended by the parent community in North America, for the furtherance of  pioneer activity, for the dissemination of Baha'i literature, for the  maintenance of local Baha'i headquarters, for the gradual initiation of  Baha'i endowments, such as the land offered for a Baha'i Temple in Chile,  for the holding of conferences and of summer schools, for the creation of  publicity agencies, and for the conduct and expansion of youth activities.    Strong and sustained support should be given to the vitally needed and  meritorious activities started by the native Latin American traveling  teachers, particularly in the pioneer field, who, as the mighty task  progresses, must increasingly bear the brunt of responsibility for the  propagation of the Faith in their homelands. Full advantage should be  taken of the facilities provided by the use of practical workshop courses  in Latin American pioneering at the International School at Temerity  Ranch. The two summer schools in Azeiza and Santiago, as well as one  planned in Vera Cruz, should be utilized, not only as centers for the  acquisition of Baha'i learning, but as training grounds for pioneering  among the Spanish and Portuguese speaking populations of all the republics  of Latin America. The regional conferences held in Buenos Aires and Panama  should be followed by conferences of a similar character, at which a  growing number of attendants from among the ranks of Latin American  believers will assume an ever-increasing share of responsibility in the  initiation and conduct of the affairs of a continually evolving community.  A deliberate effort should be made to increase, through correspondence  teaching and its extension to all the Spanish speaking countries, the  number of the active supporters of the Faith, so desperately needed in  view of the vastness of the field, the mighty responsibilities that have  been incurred, the smallness of the number of laborers, and the shortness  of the time at their disposal.    Other agencies, such as publicity and advertising in the press, the  multiplication of accurate and improved radio scripts, the extension of  teaching projects through regional teaching committees, visual education  and the organization of public meetings, should be fully utilized to  capture the attention, win the sympathy, and secure the active and  unreserved support of a steadily increasing proportion of the population  of the various Latin American republics. The publishing activities of a  constantly growing community should, likewise, be stimulated, their scope  should be continually widened, the quality of Baha'i publications in  Spanish, Portuguese and French be improved, and their dissemination over a  wide area be insured. The two Spanish bulletins, the one already published  in Santiago and the other planned in San Jose, should, likewise, as an  adjunct to Baha'i publications, be developed and widely circulated. The  contact established with the two hundred and forty-four Masonic Lodges  should be reinforced by similar contacts with schools as well as business  firms established throughout the various republics, for the sole purpose  of giving further publicity to the Faith, and winning ultimately fresh  recruits to the strength of its followers.            IMPORTANCE OF THE AMERICAN INDIANS      Particular attention, I feel, should, at this juncture, be directed to the  various Indian tribes, the aboriginal inhabitants of the Latin republics,  whom the Author of the Tablets of the Divine Plan has compared to the  \"ancient inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsula.\" \"Attach great importance,\"  is His admonition to the entire body of the believers in the United States  and the Dominion of Canada, \"to the indigenous population of America. For  these souls may be likened unto the ancient inhabitants of the Arabian  Peninsula, who, prior to the Mission of Muhammad, were like unto savages.  When the light of Muhammad shone forth in their midst, however, they  became so radiant as to illumine the world. Likewise, these Indians,  should they be educated and guided, there can be no doubt that they will  become so illumined as to enlighten the whole world.\" The initial contact  already established, in the concluding years of the first Baha'i century,  in obedience to 'Abdu'l-Baha's Mandate, with the Cherokee and Oneida  Indians in North Carolina and Wisconsin, with the Patagonian, the Mexican  and the Inca Indians, and the Mayans in Argentina, Mexico, Peru and  Yucatan, respectively, should, as the Latin American Baha'i communities  gain in stature and strength, be consolidated and extended. A special  effort should be exerted to secure the unqualified adherence of members of  some of these tribes to the Faith, their subsequent election to its  councils, and their unreserved support of the organized attempts that will  have to be made in the future by the projected national assemblies for the  large-scale conversion of Indian races to the Faith of Baha'u'llah.    Nor should the peculiar position of the Republic of Panama be overlooked  at the present stage in the development of the Faith in Latin America.  \"All the above countries,\" 'Abdu'l-Baha, referring to the Central American  republics in one of the Tablets of His Divine Plan, has affirmed, \"have  importance, but especially the Republic of Panama, wherein the Atlantic  and Pacific Oceans come together through the Panama Canal. It is a center  for travel and passage from America to other continents of the world, and  in the future it will gain most great importance.\" \"Likewise,\" He moreover  has written, \"ye must give great attention to the Republic of Panama, for  in that point the Occident and the Orient find each other united through  the Panama Canal, and it is also situated between the two great oceans.  That place will become very important in the future. The teachings, once  established there, will unite the East and the West, the North and the  South.\"    The manifold activities initiated since the launching of the first Seven  Year Plan should, under no circumstances, be neglected or allowed to  stagnate. The excellent publicity accorded the Faith, and the contact  established with several leaders in that republic should be followed up,  systematically and with the greatest care, by the growing community within  its confines. The initial contact with the Indians should be developed  with assiduous care and unfailing patience. Furthermore, the strengthening  of the bonds now being forged between the North American communities and  their sister communities in Latin America must constitute, owing to the  unique and central position occupied by that republic, one of the chief  objectives of the Panamanian believers, the progress of whose activities  deserves to rank as one of the most notable chapters of recent Latin  American Baha'i history.    Nor should the valuable and meritorious labors accomplished since the  inception of the first Seven Year Plan in Punta Arenas de Magallanes, that  far-off center situated not only on the southern extremity of the Western  Hemisphere, but constituting the southernmost outpost of the Faith in the  whole world, be for a moment neglected in the course of the second stage  in the development of the Divine Plan. The assembly already constituted in  that city, the remarkable radio publicity secured by the believers there,  the assistance extended by them to the teaching work in other parts of  Chile, should be regarded only as a prelude to the work of consolidation  which must be indefatigably pursued. This work, if properly carried out,  in conjunction with the activities associated with the assemblies of  Santiago, Valparaiso and Vina del Mar, and the groups of Puerto Montt,  Valdivia, Quilpue, Temuco, Sewell, Chorrillos, Muelchen and other smaller  ones, as well as several isolated localities in that republic, may well  hasten the advent of the day when the Chilean followers of the Faith of  Baha'u'llah will have established the first independent national spiritual  assembly to be formed by any single nation of Latin America.            BAHA'U'LLAH'S"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19270"],[0,"Directives from the Guardian (#5)"],[1,"Book was the power of the Covenant.    \"The 'Crimson Book' refers to the Book of His Covenant, and the reference  above means the power for unity which the Covenant possesses and radiates.  On page 238 of 'God Passes By' you will find the cross-reference to the  'Crimson Book' and the 'Epistle to the Son of the Wolf.'\"            47: CRITICISM      \"When criticism and harsh words arise within a Baha'i community, there is  no remedy except to put the past behind one, and persuade all concerned to  turn over a new leaf, and for the sake of God and His Faith refrain from  mentioning the subjects which have led to misunderstanding and inharmony.  The more the friends argue back and forth and maintain, each side, that  their point of view is the right one, the worse the whole situation  becomes.    \"When we see the condition the world is in today, we must surely forget  these utterly insignificant internal disturbances, and rush, unitedly, to  the rescue of humanity. You should urge your fellow Baha'is to support you  in a strong effort to suppress every critical thought and every harsh  word, in order to let the spirit of Baha'u'llah flow into the entire  community, and unite it in His love and in His service.\"            48: CRITICISM (ON)      \"...Vicious criticism is indeed a calamity. But its root is lack of faith  in the system of Baha'u'llah, i.e., the Administrative Order--and lack of  obedience to Him--for He has forbidden it! If the Baha'is would follow the  Baha'i laws in voting, in electing, in serving and in abiding by Assembly  decisions, all this waste of strength through criticizing others could be  diverted into cooperation and achieving the Plan...\"            49: DANIEL, THE PROPHECY OF      \"Regarding the Prophecy of Daniel: The passage in Esselmont should be  changed to state that this prophecy refers to the one-hundredth  anniversary of the Declaration of Baha'u'llah, in the Garden of Ridvan,  Ba_gh_dad--reference to this can be found in 'The Passing of 'Abdu'l-Baha  in quotation from two of His Tablets.\"            50: DISPENSATION OF BAHA'U'LLAH      \"With reference to ... the Dispensation of Baha'u'llah, he wishes me to  explain that although 'Abdu'l-Baha's station is not that of a  Manifestation of God, nevertheless supplications may be addressed to Him.  It is essential, however, that every believer should realize that while  doing so he is directing his thoughts toward the Master as an intermediary  between him and the Manifestation, and not as the Source of Divine  Revelation and Spiritual Guidance. Provided this distinction is clearly  established, there can be no harm or objection in addressing prayers to  'Abdu'l-Baha.\"            51: DISPUTES, INDIVIDUAL--(CONSULTATION WITH ASSEMBLY)      \"Regarding consultation: Any person can refer a matter to the Assembly for  consultation whether the other person wishes to or not. In matters which  affect the Cause the Assembly should, if it deems it necessary, intervene  even if both sides don't want it to, because the whole purpose of the  Assemblies is to protect the Faith, the Communities and the individual  Baha'is as well.\"            52: DRAMA--MANIFESTATIONS (DRAMATIC WORKS)      \"With reference to your question whether the Figures of the Bab and  Baha'u'llah should be made to appear as characters in dramatic works  written by the believers, Shoghi Effendi's opinion is that such an attempt  to dramatize the Manifestations would be highly disrespectful, and hence  should be avoided by the friends, even in the case of the Master. Besides  it would be practically impossible to carry out such a plan faithfully,  and in a dignified and befitting manner.\"            53: DRAMA OF THE FAITH      \"The Faith can certainly be dramatized, but two things must be remembered:  No personal presentation of the Bab, Baha'u'llah or the Master, only their  Words can be used, but no figure must represent Them; great dignity must  be the keynote.\"            54: ECONOMIC TEACHINGS      \"With regard to your wish for reorganizing your business along Baha'i  lines, Shoghi Effendi deeply appreciates the spirit that has permitted you  to make such a suggestion. But he feels nevertheless that the time has not  yet come for any believer to bring about such a fundamental change in the  economic structure of our society, however restricted may be the field for  such an experiment. The economic teachings of the Cause, though well known  in their main outline, have not as yet been sufficiently elaborated and  systematized to allow anyone to make an exact and thorough application of  them even on a restricted scale.\"            55: ECONOMICS--BAHA'I      \"As you say, the Writings are not so rich on this subject and many issues  at present baffling the minds of the world are not even mentioned. The  primary consideration is the spirit that has to permeate our economic  life, and this will gradually crystallize itself into definite  institutions and principles that will help to bring about the ideal  condition foretold by Baha'u'llah.\"    \"No, Baha'u'llah did not bring a complete system of economics to the  world. Profit sharing is recommended as a solution to one form of economic  problems. There is nothing in the teachings against some kind of  capitalism; its present form, though, would require adjustments to be  made.\"    \"There are practically no technical teachings on economics in the Cause,  such as banking, the price system, and others. The Cause is not an  economic system, nor its Founders be considered as having been technical  economists. The contribution of the Faith to this subject is essentially  indirect, as it consists of the application of spiritual principles to our  present-day economic system. Baha'u'llah has given us a few basic  principles which should guide future Baha'i economists in establishing  such institutions which will adjust the economic relationships of the  world...    \"Social inequality is the inevitable outcome of the natural inequality of  man. Human beings are different in ability and should, therefore, be  different in their social and economic standing. Extremes of wealth and  poverty should, however, be abolished...    \"The Master has definitely stated that wages should be unequal, simply  because that men are unequal in their ability and hence should receive  wages that would correspond to their varying capacities and resources.\"            56: ECONOMIC TEACHINGS      \"As regards the activities of the economic committee of the National  Assembly; Shoghi Effendi fully sympathizes with the desire of some of the  members to see the Committee find ways and means to put into practice the  economic teachings of the Cause, as explained in some of the recorded  Writings and Sayings of Baha'u'llah and the Master. But he believes that  the time is not yet ripe for such activities. First we have to study the  economic teachings in the light of modern problems more thoroughly so that  we may advocate what the Founders of the Faith say and not what we  conjecture from Their Writings. There is great difference between sounding  a great general principle and finding its application to actual prevailing  conditions. Secondly, the Cause is not financially in a position to launch  itself in such undertakings at present. Such plans need great financial  backing to be worked out in a permanent form. In time, Shoghi Effendi  hopes all these things will come to pass. For the present we have to  consolidate our basic institutions and spread the teachings and spirit of  the Faith among the public.\"            57: EDUCATION (ON INABILITY OF MODERN EDUCATION TO PRODUCE A MATURE MIND)      \"People today indeed do tend to be very superficial in their thinking, and  it would seem as if the educational systems in use are sorely lacking in  ability to produce a mature mind in a person who has reached supposedly  adult life! All the outside influences that surround the individual seem  to have an intensely distracting effect, and it is a hard job to get the  average person to do any deep thinking or even a little meditation on the  problems facing him and the world at large.    \"Over and over again Baha'u'llah cried out against the heedlessness of  humanity, and warns of the fate such an attitude must lead to. Did we not  know what God plans to, and will do, with the world in the future, we  should certainly be as hopeless as many of the best thinkers of our  generation have become.\"            58: ELDERS (FOUR AND TWENTY)      \"Regarding the four and twenty elders: The Master, in a Tablet, stated  that they were the Bab, the eighteen Letters of the Living, and five  others who would be known in the future. So far we do not know who these  five others are.\"            59: ELECTION (ACCEPTANCE OF)      \"Concerning the question of refusal by certain believers to accept  election to an administrative post: The Guardian strongly feels that  criticism, opposition, or confusion do not provide sufficient grounds for  either refusal or resignation. Only cases of physical or mental  incapacity, which, by their very nature, are extremely rare, constitute  valid reasons for such an act. The difficulties and tests involved in the  acceptance of Administrative posts, far from inducing the believers to  dissociate themselves from the work of the Cause, should spur them on to  greater exertions and to a more active participation in the privileged  task of resolving the problems that confront the Baha'i community.    \"Only in cases where individual believers, without any valid reason,  deliberately refuse the repeated exhortations, pleas, and warnings  addressed to them by their Assemblies, should action be taken in removing  them from the voting list. This is a measure designed to sustain the  institutions of the Faith at the present time, and to insure that the  abilities and talents of its, as yet, limited number of supporters are  properly consecrated to its service.
