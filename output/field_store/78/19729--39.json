Frank's experience seemed to be highly  satisfactory, for he reappeared grinning cheerfully. Perhaps he had  cause, but he did not reveal it, and when his brother came forth from  the clutches of the sorceress, he insisted that he should have his  horoscope cast.    As there seemed no hope of finding the lady they sought until the crowd  should have thinned a little, Jack laughed and entered the  silver-spangled tent. The seeress was gowned in white, with silver  chains and bracelets and girdle, and a long white veil completely  enveloped her except the face, and this was concealed by her yashmak up  to her mocking gray eyes, with their dark, level brows. There was  something in her eyes that attracted Jack, and made him believe in her  uncanny powers quite against his will, and even while he told himself  that this was but the foolishness of the hour. He gave her the necessary  data, and she consulted her charts, and gave him a rapid and wonderfully  correct delineation of his character, \"a nature which combines the  characteristics of Scorpio with some of those of Sagitarrius, as is the  case,\" she explained gravely, \"with persons born near the cusp,\" a term  which produced no impression upon his mind, though he said, \"Oh,  indeed,\" politely. She made some cabalistic marks on a square of paper  and turned to him with a somewhat startled expression, which faded at  once, and the mocking eyes looked full into his as she went on.    \"You do not believe in anything I am telling you, and therefore I shall  speak quite frankly, certain that you will be neither cast down nor  elated by anything I can say. I think you are a physician; if not you  ought to be; you seem to have come from afar, and to be about to begin a  new phase in your life. It is well that you have two of the greatest of  the planets, Mars and Jupiter, as controlling influences, for you will  need them, and that very soon. You are at this moment in greater danger  than ever before has been your lot.\"    Jack could not repress a laugh. With youth, health, ability and love he  felt that it would take more than a stray comet to turn the currents of  his life awry. But the woman did not smile; he could see that much  through the gauzy yashmak, and her eyes grew grave and her forehead  contracted.    \"I am glad you don't believe it,\" she said, \"because I should not like  to tell you what I see if you did; before morning you will know whether  it is all the foolishness you think it.\"    He apologized. \"I'm immensely interested,\" he said, \"but I didn't know  any one regarded this sort of thing seriously. So far as you've gone  you've hit me off very well, and I don't mind telling you that I am a  physician, and I'm just back from the far East.\"    \"Thank you,\" she said gravely. \"Have you ever heard that if a man has  made love to a girl under the constellation of Cassiopeia he should not  marry until he has also made love under the Southern Cross? There is a  conjunction of malign planets at this time; they threaten your happiness  through love, through hate, through accident. If you have become  interested in any person born under Saturn, that is between the  twenty-first of December and the twentieth of January, particularly  about the seventh of January, you should certainly take time to consider  carefully, for there is nothing but wretchedness and misunderstanding in  such an alliance; there may be much that is attractive on the surface,  but you will find a complete lack of harmony, of similarity of tastes  and ambition that would leave you forever alone, and there is much  selfishness and stubborness of will. Saturn and Scorpio are not good  marital allies.\" He gave her a searching glance, for the seventh of  January was Leonora's birthday, but her face was quite inscrutable.    \"There is something here I do not understand; this accident does not  happen to you, nor to any one near you, yet it has a lasting and a  terrible effect upon your life----\" she shuddered and pushed the charts  away from her. \"I will not tell you any more,\" she said, \"but I wonder  whether you would do me the favor of giving me your name and address. I  want to cast your horoscope carefully, and I will send you the chart.\"    He thanked her and wrote down his name as requested, somewhat impressed  in spite of himself. As he rose to go she stood also and lifted her hand  as if she would have drawn him back, then let it drop heavily. If it was  a piece of acting, he told himself it was perfectly done. \"Do be careful  for the next twenty-four hours,\" she said, \"and beware of the evil that  may come out of good.\"    That last Delphic utterance stamped the whole affair as a clever piece  of mind-reading, guesswork and acting, and, somewhat annoyed that he  should have been hoaxed even for a moment, Jack withdrew.    The hour was growing late and the crowd dispersing when they turned  from the fortune-telling booths and entered the ballroom, and presently  Jack said to his sister, \"There she is; the one in the green gown.\"    \"Yes, that is Silvia Holland. What a superb dancer, and how democratic!  The man she is dancing with is at the head of one of the labor  organizations that is championing woman's suffrage. Come, Jack, let us  have a whirl, as of old, and I will then bring your 'Mystery' over to  the box.\"    In a moment they were in the midst of the waltz, and at its close Hilda  had so managed that they were near Miss Holland. Stepping up to her on  Jack's arm she presented her brother, and, accepting Hilda's invitation,  Miss Holland joined their party.    \"Did I not see you a year ago on the streets in London, the time I was  arrested?\" she naively asked Jack.    \"Yes, but you were very busy. How in the world could you remember me?\"    \"Don't be flattered by the apparent compliment. While I was delivering  my little speech to the police I noted how closely you followed me and  that you were the only American around, and I had determined to appeal  to you for assistance if they undertook to jail the feeble old woman  who was with us. They didn't disturb her, and so you were not called  upon, but you see how near you came to being a militant English  suffragette and perhaps a prisoner for thirty days,\" she said, half  seriously and half smilingly.    \"The word of command would have made me both,\" he answered, with so much  emphasis that Frank broke into the conversation with, \"I wonder if the  open door of an English jail would convert me?\"    \"That would depend upon who was directing your footsteps toward the  jail,\" suggested his brother-in-law.    \"Not at all; I think I am hopeless after having heard so much of the  theoretical benefits of suffrage and seen the utter lack of effect in  Colorado, where I live.\"    Silvia Holland turned her great, intense eyes upon him. They were  glowing, and he felt the same fascination he had experienced in the  afternoon.    \"You from Colorado and talk this way!\" she said in amazement. \"Surely  you are jesting. Take the effect on the polling places alone. Compare  those of New York with those of Denver, and I have seen them in full  operation in both places. In the first is the atmosphere of barrooms; in  the second the manners and air of drawing-rooms. If I were a Colorado  man I should be proud of the result upon Colorado women of their  responsibility in citizenship. I know women of all nationalities, but I  know none where the average of intelligence or womanly grace and real  accomplishments are greater than with your Colorado women.\"    \"I am a railroad attorney, sent out by the owners of some of the lines  traversing Colorado to look after their interests,\" he answered. \"It is  possible that my conclusions have been influenced by my occupation. I am  prepared to admit that. But I have rather old-fashioned notions in  relation to the proper place for women being in the home and not in  politics.\"    \"Oh, you American professional men, particularly you corporation  lawyers\"--she was smiling now. \"You might as well be living in the  middle ages, for you take no note of the tremendous revolution that is  going on all around you. What we call politics is in reality government,  and home is the basis of all good government, and government to serve  its legitimate aim in a democracy must reflect the sentiments of all  the members of the society that created it, women as well as men, and  the higher the aspirations of society the higher the purposes of  government.\"    The others were enjoying this little scene. \"Bravo, bravo, Silvia!\"  exclaimed Hilda. \"Do make a convert of him!\"    \"You know,\" said Miss Holland, and she put as much sarcasm in her tone  as possible without leaving a sting, \"that this thing called government  only needs a good house-cleaning and the application of a few vermin  extinguishers, such as every good housekeeper knows how to administer,  to make this country a congenial habitation for the gods of the  Twentieth Century--the enlightened, progressive, responsible citizens of  a democracy.

It had  more life-like figures, attendants, benign and malignant, terrifying  demons. Before these impassive gods, in a fervor of devotion it bent the  figures of donors, men and women, sometimes veritable portraits. With even  greater breadth it portrayed the disciples of Sakyamuni, those anchorites  and hermits who under the name of Lohan[10] have entered into Chinese  Buddhist legend. Indian priests with harsh, strongly marked features and  wrinkled faces, preachers of a foreign race, disfigured by scourging or  else the calm full visage of the ecstatic in contemplation,--such are the  types that appeared.

[10] Indian _Arhat_; Japanese _Rakan_.--TRANSLATOR.          IV. THE T'ANG PERIOD--SEVENTH TO TENTH CENTURIES      The T'ang dynasty was the really vital period of Chinese Buddhism. Among  the painters who gave it its highest expression Wu Tao-tz[)u] holds first  place. His memory dwells in history as that of one of the greatest masters  in China and legend has still further enhanced the might of his genius. It  is highly probable that his work is entirely destroyed, but by the aid of  copies, incised stones and wood engravings of the twelfth century, an idea  of the painter's conception can be formed. He seems to have been the  creator of a Chinese type of Kwanyin, the Buddhist incarnation of mercy  and charity. Drapery covers the high drawn hair. She is attired in the  harmonious folds of a plain and ample garment and expresses supreme  authority, the sublimity of divine love.    If to these fragments of an immense plastic production is added the  analysis furnished by the written records, we can define with some degree  of certitude the place occupied by Wu Tao-tz[)u] in the history of Chinese  painting. The books state that the lines from his brush fairly vibrated;  all united in marvelling at the spirituality emanating from forms thus  defined. He adhered almost exclusively to the use of powerful ink-lines  and denied himself the use of any color, whether scattered or prominent,  which would have robbed his painting of the austerity which was the source  of its surpassing feeling. But in order to appreciate the full value of  the new ideas introduced by Wu into Chinese painting, it is necessary to  understand the exact nature of the technique that was in practice up to  the seventh and eighth centuries, at the opening of the T'ang dynasty.      [Illustration: PLATE VIII. WHITE EAGLE. SUNG PERIOD    Collection of R. Petrucci.]    At that time there prevailed the analytic, painstaking, detailed and very  considered drawing that is common to all periods preceding great  constructive work. This technique admitted the use of two fundamental  methods: one called _double contour_, the other _contour_ or _single  contour_. The method of _double contour_ was applied chiefly to the  drawing of plant life in landscape. It consisted in outlining leaves or  branches by means of two lines of ink placed in apposition. The space thus  enclosed was filled with color. Any peculiarities of formation, knots in  wood and veins in leaves were added subsequently. The name of _single  contour_ was applied to drawings wherein a single ink line outlined the  object, the space enclosed being then filled with color.    If the application of these analytic methods was sometimes carried to the  extreme of delicacy it never became labored. Throughout its entire  evolution the art of the T'ang period is characterized by a sense of the  magnificent. Once the study of forms was exhausted, this type of work was  bound to be superceded. Wu Tao-tz[)u] profited by the work of his  predecessors. Combining in a single stroke of the brush, vigor and an  eclectic character of line, with values and fluidity of tone, he brought  to a supreme unity the two great principles by which things are made  manifest in all the magic of their essential structure. But it must be  understood that this patient investigation of forms was not limited to  preparing the way for a single master. The logical outcome was an  independent movement to which the origin of modern Chinese painting can be  traced.    \"Painting has two branches,\" the books say, \"that of the North and that of  the South; the separation occurred in the T'ang period.\" These terms  _Northern School_ and _Southern School_ must not be taken literally. They  serve merely to characterize styles which, in the eighth century,  liberated themselves from methods demanding such close study and exact  definition of forms. The style of the Northern School is strong, vehement  and bold; the style of the Southern School is melancholy and dreamy. The  ideal of Northern China, impregnated with barbarian elements, is brought  into contrast with that of Southern China, heir to an already ancient  civilization, and under the spell of Taoist legends and the bewildered  dreams of its philosophers.[11]      [11] These divisions of Northern and Southern Schools do not    correspond, as might be imagined, to geographical limitations.    Painters of the South worked in the style of the North and painters of    the North likewise used the Southern style. Moreover the same master    was able to employ one or the other according to the inspiration of    the moment. These works were produced for a receptive people capable    of understanding both styles.      [Illustration: PLATE IX. HORSEMAN FOLLOWED BY TWO ATTENDANTS    Sung Period. Collection of A. Stoclet.]    Li Ssu-hsuen and his son Li Chao-tao (eighth century) are considered to be  the founders of the Northern School. The paintings attributed to them show  the character which the Northern style preserved up to the Ming period and  which was to be emphasized to the point of brutality at the hands of  certain masters in the Yuean period. At the outset, in its brilliancy and  precision, the Northern style held to a certain refinement of line; later  the line is drawn with a firm and powerful brush and strong colors are  applied almost pure.    In direct contrast the Southern style is made up of half-tints, with a  feeling of reserve and intentional restraint, which gives it, with equal  power, at times a more appealing charm. The lines are pliant, immersed in  shading, color is suggested in a subtle fashion and, in contrast to the  almost brutal emphasis of the North, it finds expression in chiaroscuro  and concealed harmonies.    The foundation of the Southern School is attributed to a great landscape  painter of the eighth century, Wang Wei. Nothing could better determine  his tendencies than monochrome[12] painting in Chinese ink. According to  the records, this was first practiced by him. It constitutes what in  China, as well as in Japan, is called the _literary man's painting_ and  is, in reality, quite closely related to calligraphy. The variety of  shadings and relative colors of objects depend entirely upon the tones of  ink washes. Wang Wei seems to have treated monochrome mainly from the  standpoint of chiaroscuro, in his search for an atmospheric perspective  which should be both fluid and ethereal. It appears that the accentuation  of lines according to rule that is seen later on, where forms are  synthetized--sometimes to an excessive degree--was only a derivation of  the work of Wang Wei and caused by the intrusion of calligraphic  virtuosity into the domain of painting.      [12] \"Monochrome is a starved and lifeless term to express the    marvellous range and subtlety of tones of which the preparation of    black soot known as Chinese ink is capable.\" Laurence Binyon in \"The    Flight of the Dragon.\"--TRANSLATOR.    When we arrive at Wang Wei, landscape is treated as a special subject and  with its own resources. It was he who discovered the principles which  govern the fading of colors and forms in the distance, and who formulated  the laws of atmospheric perspective. Paintings in his style are all  executed in a predominating color which the Chinese call _luo-ts'ing_, a  mineral color of varying shades ranging from a malachite green to a  lapis-lazuli blue. It will be seen why _luo-ts'ing_ gave its name to the  style of Wang Wei.    By means of bluish tints he painted the distant expanse of landscape.  Mountains forming screens in the backgrounds and masses of trees lost in  the distance, are all indicated by the azure tints which intervening  layers of air give to remote objects. But as the foreground is approached,  rightful colors begin to prevail and the azure tints are subtly graded,  passing into a fresh and brilliant green amongst wooded declivities, and  into the natural hue in the foliage of trees. Often heavy mists, spreading  at the foot of high mountains, veil the outlines and still further  emphasize the feeling of limitless space.[13]      [13] I have not seen nor do I know of any paintings which can be said    with certainty to be from the hand of Wang Wei. But from the records    as well as from works directly inspired by him, an idea of his style    and technique can be formed. Ancient paintings in _luo-ts'ing_ are    found in Japan as well as in China. The British Museum of London has a    scroll painted by Chao Meng-fu, in the manner of Wang Wei, dated 1309.      [Illustration: PLATE X. LANDSCAPE IN THE STYLE OF HSIA KUEI    Sung Period. Collection of Martin White.]    But when a master has carried his study of the fading of colors and of  their relative values thus far, he must have considered not only the  element of color itself, but also the collective tones which color is  capable of expressing. From this to monochrome painting in Chinese ink is  but a step; historical testimony shows that Wang Wei took this step. By  the simple opposition of black and"]]]
