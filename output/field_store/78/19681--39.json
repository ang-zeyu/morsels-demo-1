Opimius had been impeached after his year  of office, but acquitted, which the senate might claim as a confirmation  of the right, in spite of the _lex_ of Gaius Gracchus, which confirmed  the right of _provocatio_ in all cases. In B.C. 100 the tribune  Saturninus and the praetor Glaucia were arrested in consequence of a  similar decree, which this time joined the other magistrates to the  consuls as authorized to protect the Republic: their death, however, was  an act of violence on the part of a mob. Its legality had been impugned  by Caesar's condemnation of Rabirius, as _duovir capitalis_, but to a  certain extent confirmed by the failure to secure his conviction on the  trial of his appeal to the people. In B.C. 88 and 83 this decree of the  senate was again passed, in the first case in favour of Sulla against  the tribune Sulpicius, who was in consequence put to death; and in the  second case in favour of the consuls (partisans of Marius) against the  followers of Sulla. Again in B.C. 77 the decree was passed in  consequence of the insurrection of the proconsul Lepidus, who, however,  escaped to Sardinia and died there.    In every case but one this decree had been passed against the popular  party. The only legal sanction given to the exercise of the _imperium  sine provocatione_ was the acquittal of the consul Opimius in B.C. 120.  But the jury which tried that case probably consisted entirely of  senators, who would not stultify their own proceedings by condemning  him. To rely upon such precedents required either great boldness (never  a characteristic of Cicero), or the most profound conviction of the  essential righteousness of the measure, and the clearest assurance that  the safety of the state--the supreme law--justified the breach of every  constitutional principle. Cicero was not left long in doubt as to  whether there would be any to question his proceeding. On the last day  of the year, when about to address the people, as was customary, on  laying down his consulship, the tribune Q. Caecilius Metellus Nepos  forbade him to speak, on the express ground that he \"had put citizens to  death uncondemned\"--_quod cives indemnatos necavisset_. Cicero consoled  himself with taking the required oath as to having observed the laws,  with an additional declaration that he had \"saved the state.\"  Nevertheless, he must have felt deeply annoyed and alarmed at the action  of Metellus, for he had been a _legatus_ of Pompey, and was supposed to  represent his views, and it was upon the approbation and support of  Pompey, now on the eve of his return from the East, that Cicero  particularly reckoned.    [Sidenote: Letters after B.C. 63.]    The letters in our collection now recommence. The first of the year  (B.C. 62) is one addressed to Pompey, expressing some discontent at the  qualified manner in which he had written on recent events, and affirming  his own conviction that he had acted in the best interests of the state  and with universal approval. But indeed the whole correspondence to the  end of Cicero's exile is permeated with this subject directly or  indirectly. His quarrel with Metellus Nepos brought upon him a  remonstrance from the latter's brother (or cousin), Metellus Celer  (Letters XIII, XIV), and when the correspondence for B.C. 61 opens, we  find him already on the eve of the quarrel with Publius Clodius which  was to bring upon him the exile of B.C. 58.    [Sidenote: Publius Clodius Pulcher.]    P. CLODIUS PULCHER was an extreme instance of a character not uncommon  among the nobility in the last age of the Republic. Of high birth, and  possessed of no small amount of ability and energy, he belonged by  origin and connexion to the Optimates; but he regarded politics as a  game to be played for his personal aggrandizement, and public office as  a means of replenishing a purse drained by boundless extravagance and  self-indulgence. His record had been bad. He had accompanied his  brother-in-law Lucullus, or had joined his staff, in the war with  Mithridates, and had helped to excite a mutiny in his army in revenge  for some fancied slight. He had then gone to Cilicia, where another  brother-in-law, Q. Marcus Rex, was propraetor, and while commanding a  fleet under him had fallen into the hands of pirates, and when freed  from them had gone--apparently in a private capacity--to Antioch, where  he again excited a mutiny of Syrian troops engaged in a war against the  Arabians (B.C. 70-65). On his return to Rome he attempted to make  himself conspicuous by prosecuting Catiline, but accepted a bribe to  withdraw. In B.C. 64, on the staff of the governor of Gallia  Narbonensis, he is accused of having enriched himself with plunder. For  a time after that he was still acting as a member of the party of the  Optimates; seems to have supported Cicero during the Catiline  conspiracy; and in B.C. 62 stood for the quaestorship and was elected.  His violation of the mysteries was alleged to have been committed in  December of that year, and before he could go to the province allotted  to him as quaestor in Sicily he had to stand a trial for sacrilege. Such  an offence--penetrating in disguise into the house of the Pontifex  Maximus, when his wife was engaged in the secret rites of the Bona  Dea--would place him under a curse, and not only prevent his entering  upon his quaestorship, but would disfranchise and politically ruin him.  Clodius would seem not to have been a person of sufficient character or  importance to make this trial a political event. But not only had he  powerful backers, but his opponents also, by proposing an innovation in  the manner of selecting the jurors for trying him, had managed to give a  spurious political importance to the case. One of the most brilliant of  the early letters (XV, p. 37) gives us a graphic picture of the trial.  Clodius was acquitted and went to his province, but returned in B.C. 60,  apparently prepared for a change of parties. Cicero and he had  quarrelled over the trial. He had said sarcastic things about the sacred  consulship, and Cicero had retaliated by bitter speeches in the senate,  and by giving evidence at the trial of having seen Clodius in Rome three  hours before he professed to have been at Interamna, on the day of the  alleged sacrilege. It is perhaps possible that his alibi may have been  true in substance, for he may have been well out of Rome on his way to  Interamna after seeing Cicero. But, however that may be, he nourished a  grudge against Cicero, which he presently had an opportunity of  satisfying. The year of his return to Rome from Sicily (B.C. 60) was the  same as that of Caesar's return from Spain. Pompey--who had returned the  year before--was at enmity with the senate on account of the  difficulties raised to the confirmation of his _acta_ and the allotments  for his veterans. Caesar had a grievance because of the difficulties put  in the way of his triumph. The two coalesced, taking in the millionaire  Crassus, to form a triumvirate or coalition of three, with a view to  getting measures they desired passed, and offices for themselves or  their partisans. This was a great blow to Cicero, who clung feverously  to Pompey as a political leader, but could not follow him in a coalition  with Caesar: for he knew that the object of it was a series of measures  of which he heartily disapproved. His hope of seeing Pompey coming to  act as acknowledged leader of the Optimates was dashed to the ground. He  could not make up his mind wholly to abandon him, or, on the other hand,  to cut himself adrift from the party of Optimates, to whose policy he  had so deeply committed himself. Clodius was troubled by no such  scruples. Perhaps Caesar had given him substantial reasons for his change  of policy. At any rate, from this time forward he acts as an extreme  _popularis_--much too extreme, as it turned out, for Pompey's taste. As  a patrician his next step in the official ladder would naturally have  been the aedileship. But that peaceful office did not suit his present  purpose. The tribuneship would give him the right to bring forward  measures in the _comitia tributa_, such as he desired to pass, and would  in particular give him the opportunity of attacking Cicero. The  difficulty was that to become tribune he must cease to be a patrician.  He could only do that by being adopted into a plebeian gens. He had a  plebeian ready to do it in B.C. 59. But for a man who was _sui iuris_ to  be adopted required a formal meeting of the old _comitia curiata_, and  such a meeting required the presence of an augur, as well as some kind  of sanction of the pontifices. Caesar was Pontifex Maximus, and Pompey  was a member of the college of augurs. Their influence would be  sufficient to secure or prevent this being done. Their consent was, it  appears, for a time withheld. But Caesar was going to Gaul at the end of  his consulship, and desired to have as few powerful enemies at Rome  during his absence as possible. Still he had a personal feeling for  Cicero, and when it was known that one of Clodius's objects in seeking  to become a plebeian and a tribune was to attack him, Caesar offered him  two chances of honourable retreat--first as one of the commissioners to  administer his land law, and again as one of his _legati_ in Gaul. But  Cicero would not accept the first, because he was vehemently opposed to  the law itself: nor the second, because he had no taste for provincial  business, even supposing the proconsul to be to his liking; and because  he could not believe that P. Clodius would venture to attack him, or  would succeed if he did. Caesar's consulship of B.C. 59 roused his worst  fears for the Republic; and, though he thought little of the  statesmanship or good sense of Caesar's hostile colleague Bibulus, he was  thoroughly disgusted with the policy of the triumvirs, with the  contemptuous treatment of the senate, with the high-handed"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21254"],[0,"In Africa: Hunting Adventures in the Big Game Country (#5)"],[1,"and considerable photographing.  Then the rest of the passengers went ashore and spent several hours at  the custom house. All personal luggage was passed through, and we  embarked on a little train for Mombasa. The next day we registered our  firearms and had Smith, Mackenzie and Company do the rest. This firm is  ubiquitous in Mombasa and Zanzibar. They attend to everything for you,  and relieve you from much worry, vexation and rupees. They pay your  customs duties, get your mountains of stuff on the train for Nairobi,  and all you have to do is to pay them a commission and look pleasant.  The customs duty is ten per cent. on everything you have, and the  commission is five per cent. But in a hot climate, where one is apt to  feel lazy, the price is cheap.    Thanks to the governor, our party of four was invited to go to Nairobi  on his special train. It left Mombasa on the morning of the nineteenth  of September, and at once began to climb toward the plateau on which  Nairobi is situated, three hundred and twenty-seven miles away. We had  dreaded the railway ride through the lowlands along the coast, for that  district has a bad reputation for fever and all such ills. But again we  were pleasantly disappointed. The country was beautiful and interesting,  and at four o'clock in the afternoon we arrived at Voi, a spot that is  synonymous with human ailments. It is one of the famous ill health  resorts of Africa, but on this occasion it was on its good behavior. We  stopped four hours, inspected everything in sight, and at eight o'clock  the special began to climb toward the plateau of East Africa. At nine  o'clock we stopped at Tsavo, a place made famous by the two man-eating  lions whose terrible depredations have been so vividly described by  Colonel Patterson in his book, _The Man Eaters of Tsavo_. These two  lions absolutely stopped all work on the railroad for a period of  several weeks. They were daring beyond belief, and seemed to have no  fear of human beings. For a time all efforts to kill them were in vain.  Twenty-eight native workmen were eaten by them, and doubtless many more  were unrecorded victims of their activity. The whole country was  terrorized until finally, after many futile attempts, they were at last  killed.    No book on Africa seems complete unless this incident is mentioned  somewhere within its pages.    We looked out at Tsavo with devouring interest. All was still, with the  dead silence of a tropical night. Then the train steamed on and we had  several hours in a berth to think the matter over. In the early hours of  morning, we stopped at Simba, the \"Place of Lions,\" where the  station-master has many lion scares even now. In the cold darkness of  the night we bundled up in thick clothes and went forward to sit on the  observation seat of the engine. Slowly the eastern skies became gray,  then pink, and finally day broke through heavy masses of clouds. It was  intensely cold. In the faint light we could see shadowy figures of  animals creeping home after their night's hunting. A huge cheetah  bounded along the track in front of us. A troop of giraffes slowly  ambled away from the track. A gaunt hyena loped off into the scrub near  the side of the railroad and then, as daylight became brighter, we found  ourselves in the midst of thousands of wild animals. Zebras,  hartebeests, Grant's gazelles, Thompson's gazelles, impalla, giraffes,  wildebeests, and many other antelope species cantered off and stood to  watch the train as it swept past them. It was a wonderful ride, perhaps  the most novel railway ride to be found any place in the world. On each  side of the Uganda Railroad there is a strip of land, narrow on the  north and wide on the south, in which game is protected from the  sportsman, and consequently the animals have learned to regard these  strips as sanctuary. There were many tales of lions as we rode along,  and the imagination pictured a slinking lion in every patch of reeds  along the way. I heard one lion story that makes the man-eaters of Tsavo  seem like vegetarians. It was told to me by a gentleman high in the  government service--a man of unimpeachable veracity. He says the story  is absolutely true, but refused to swear to it.    Once upon a time, so the story goes, there was a caravan of slaves  moving through the jungles of Africa. The slave-drivers were cruel and  they chained the poor savages together in bunches of ten. Each slave  wore an iron ring around his neck and the chain passed through this ring  and on to the rest of the ten. For days and weeks and months they  marched along, their chains clanking and their shoulders bending beneath  the heavy weight. From time to time the slave-drivers would jog them  along with a few lashes from a four-cornered \"hippo\" hide _kiboko_, or  whip. Quite naturally the life was far from pleasant to the chain-gang  and they watched eagerly for a chance to escape. Finally one dark night,  when the sentinels were asleep, a bunch of ten succeeded in creeping  away into the darkness. They were unarmed and chained from neck to neck,  one to another. For several days they made their way steadily toward the  coast. All seemed well. They ate fruit and nuts and herbs and began to  see visions of a pleasant arrival at the coast.    [Drawing: _They Made Their Way Steadily Toward the Coast_]    But, alas! Their hopes were soon to be dispelled. One night a deep  rumbling roar was heard in the jungle through which they were picking  their unanimous way. A shudder ran through the slaves. \"_Simba_,\" they  whispered in terror. A little while later there was another rumble, this  time much closer. They speedily became more frightened. Here they were,  ten days' march from the coast, unarmed, and quite defenseless against a  lion.    Presently the lion appeared, his cruel, hungry eyes gleaming through the  night. They were frozen with horror, as slowly, slowly, slowly the great  animal crept toward them with his tail sibilantly lashing above his  back. They were now thoroughly alarmed and realized to the utmost that  the lion's intentions were open to grave suspicion. Breathlessly they  waited, or perhaps they tried to climb trees, but being chained together  they could not climb more than one tree. And there was not a single tree  big enough to hold more than nine of them. The record of the story is  now obscure, but the horrid tale goes on to relate that the lion gave a  frightful roar and leaped upon the tenth man, biting him to death in a  single snap. The dilemma of the others is obvious. They knew better than  to disturb a lion while it is eating. To do so would be to court sudden  death. So they sat still and watched the beast slowly and greedily  devour their comrade. Having finished his meal the great beast,  surfeited with food, slowly moved off into the jungle.    [Drawing: _The Lion's Intentions Were Open to Grave Suspicions_]    Immediately the nine remaining slaves took to their heels, dragging the  empty ring and chain of the late number ten. All night long they ran  until finally they became exhausted and fell asleep. In the afternoon  they again resumed their march, hopeful once more. But alas! again.    Along about supper-time they heard the distant roar of a lion. Presently  it sounded nearer and soon the gleaming eyes of the lion appeared once  more among the jungle grass. Once again they were frozen with horror as  the hungry beast devoured the last man in the row--number nine. Again  they sat helpless while the man-eater slowly finished his supper, and  again they were overjoyed to see him depart from their midst. As soon as  the last vestige of his tail had disappeared from view they scrambled up  and hiked briskly toward the coast, nine days away.    [Drawing: _While the Man-Eater Finished His Supper_]    They were now thoroughly alarmed, and almost dreaded the supper hour.  The next night the lion caught up with them again and proceeded to  devour number eight. He then peacefully ambled away, leaving another  empty ring.    The next night there was a spirited contest to see which end of the  chain should be last, but a vote was taken and it was decided six to one  in favor of continuing in their original formation. The one who voted  against was eaten that night and the remaining six, with the four empty  rings clanking behind them, resumed their mournful march to the coast,  six days away.    [Drawing: _Two to One_]    For five nights after this, the lion caught up with them and diminished  their number by five. Finally there was only one left and the coast was  a full day's march away. Could he make it? It looked like a desperate  chance, but he still had hopes. He noticed with pleasure that the lion  was becoming fat and probably could not travel fast. But he also noticed  with displeasure that he had forty feet of chain and nine heavy iron  neck rings to lug along and that extra weight naturally greatly  handicapped him. It was a thrilling race--the coast only one day away  and life or death the prize! Who can imagine the feelings of the poor  slave? But with a stout heart he struggled on through poisonous  morasses, and pushed his way through snaky creepers. The afternoon sun  slowly sank toward the western horizon and--    The locomotive at this point of the story screeched loudly. The wheels  grated on the track and my official friend leaped off the cow-catcher.    \"Here!\" I shouted, \"what's the finish of that story?\"    \"I'll tell you the rest the next time I see you,\" he sang out, and so I  don't know just how the story ended.
