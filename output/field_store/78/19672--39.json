This is the view taken in recent years by Canon Stewart. He shews  it was the current local opinion at the beginning of the eighteenth  century. Dr. Tanner, who wrote the account of Ely in Browne Willis's  \"Mitred Abbies,\" takes this view, and speaks of the south arm of the  transept as the \"old Galilee\" and the north arm as the \"new Galilee.\" In  the plan in Willis's \"Survey of Cathedrals,\" 1727, the south part is  described as the \"South galilee, now the church workhouse,\" while on the  north side we read, \"Ruined part of Galilee.\" No doubt the character of  the architecture is not inconsistent with the theory that the northern  part may have been built or finished by Bishop Eustace, soon after he  was appointed, in intentional imitation of the pronounced Norman work  adjacent. Canon Stewart also points out that Bishop Eustace is known to  have rebuilt S. Mary's Church, where the rough masonry and plain lancets  are wholly unlike the beautiful work in the west porch. And he adds: \"It  is evident that Eustace had nothing to do with the erection of any part  of the present cathedral. The galilee which he built has totally  disappeared, and the porch which has gone under that name of late years  must be the work of some unknown benefactor, who had probably seen Hugh  de Northwold's presbytery, and determined to lengthen the church  westward as it had been extended in the opposite direction.\"[7] The more  generally received opinion, however, is that Bishop Eustace did really  build what is now called the galilee. This is accepted by Bentham,  Essex, and Miller, and more recently by Sir G. G. Scott.    [Illustration: The Interior Of The Galilee Before Restoration,  _c._ 1817. _From Stevenson's Supplement to Bentham_.]    No one can doubt that the entire west front, when standing, was much  improved by the addition of this great porch. The front indeed never had  the painfully flat appearance presented at some cathedrals, for its  extreme length was not very great, and the projecting turrets at each  end would greatly relieve the impression that it was the side, and not  the end, of a building. But it requires something more than a tower in  the centre of the front to give a true finish to a composition in which  there runs at the top a single horizontal line from north to south.  Richly traceried windows are not sufficient. Deeply recessed doorways  are better; but here there was only one, of the nature of which we have  no account. The great porch is exactly what was wanted.    In 1757 Essex recommended the removal of the galilee as being an  encumbrance. The roof was ruinous, the walls were in bad condition; it  was \"neither ornamental nor useful\"; it would cost a large sum to put it  into decent repair. Happily this advice was not followed. In the course  of the renovation then undertaken it was discovered that the remains of  an older porch had been incorporated with the present one.    Bishop Northwold (1229-1254) commenced the building of the present  presbytery.[8] There are now nine bays between the screen and the east  end. The apse, if such were the termination of the Norman church, was  situated between what are now on each side the fourth and fifth piers  from the screen. A line drawn from the west side of the fifth piers  north and south would just touch the eastern end of the apse. Bishop  Northwold pulled down the apse and one bay west of it, and extended the  presbytery four more bays to the east, building in all six bays, of  which two were included in the ritual choir, and four were to the east  of the high altar. All this was done between the years 1235 and 1251.  The bishop also erected a lofty timber spire on the west tower, which  remained until the present Decorated stage was built.    We have no account of the consecration of the Norman choir. But after  this extension of the building eastwards we read that the whole church  was solemnly dedicated on September 17, 1252, in honour of Saints Mary,  Peter, and Etheldreda. King Henry III. was present, as well as Prince  Edward, afterwards king. When the new portion of the church was ready,  the remains of the four saints were removed further east. In the Norman  church the high altar was in the chord of the apse, assuming one to have  been built; after Bishop Northwold's alterations it was placed at the  east end of the present sixth bay, where the apse terminated. The shrine  of the foundress was placed some feet further to the east, its eastern  face standing about twelve feet in front of the existing altar.    This work of Bishop Northwold completed the plan of the cathedral as it  now stands. The lady-chapel was indeed built afterwards, but that is to  all intents and purposes a separate building. Nor is there any later  thirteenth-century work in the church itself. The building operations of  the second half of the century were confined to the domestic part of the  monastery. As these were doubtless carried out by the convent from its  own resources, there is little notice to be found of them in the records  of the see. It is known that the rectory, now in the deanery grounds,  belonged to this period. It was finished in the time of Prior  Hemmingston (1274-1288).    [Illustration: THE SHRINE OF S. ETHELDREDA AS GIVEN IN BENTRAM'S \"HISTORY  AND ANTIQUITIES\"]    The first half of the next century was a time of great and important  work at the church. In 1321 the first stone of the lady-chapel was laid  by Alan de Walsingham, the sub-prior, afterwards sacrist. It was  finished in 1349; and though John of Wisbech had the charge of the  erection, the sacrist having more important work to do at the church  itself, we can hardly doubt that the designs were by Walsingham. The  position of the lady-chapel, to the north-east of the north transept, is  unique. At Bristol it is to the north of the north choir aisle. At  Peterborough the lady-chapel (destroyed during the Commonwealth) was in  a nearly similar situation, projecting eastward from the north  transept. Whatever may have been the reason at Peterborough for this  unusual position (some say that a public road close to the apse  prevented an extension of the choir to the east), there is no necessity  to question the accuracy of the explanation generally given of the site  of the lady-chapel here--namely, that the place of honour, east of the  high altar, was already appropriated to the shrine of S. Etheldreda.    On the night of February 12, 1322, the eve of S. Ermenilda's day, the  central tower fell. Its insecurity had long been known. The monks had  just left their matin service in S. Catharine's Chapel. Some persons  conclude from this fact that the choir had already been disused as being  unsafe; but unless there is other evidence of this, the mere fact of the  monastic matins being held in the chapel nearest to the domestic  buildings seems hardly sufficient to justify the conclusion. The chapel  here named was not (according to Dean Stubbs) the one now dedicated to  S. Catharine at the west end of the cathedral, but one that adjoined the  chapter-house. The fall of the tower destroyed three bays of the choir.  Different opinions are held as to the character of the architecture of  the bays thus destroyed. Some hold that Bishop Northwold built the choir  and presbytery, from the central tower to the east end, in the Early  English style, and that three of his bays were thrown down by the fall  of the tower[9]; others think that the bays now ruined were part of the  Norman work.[10] It is most probable that Northwold, designing to  increase the length of the presbytery, only pulled down so much of the  Norman work as was necessary for his purpose, leaving the western arches  standing. This opinion is adopted in the account of his work given  above. If this is correct, there would have been _four_ Norman arches  left standing between the tower and the Early English work. Of these,  three on each side fell. When the new choir was constructed, the octagon  taking up the space of the first bay, the fourth bay--presumably left  uninjured--was removed, as being out of keeping between the Early  English and the new Decorated bays; and hence three new bays were built,  reaching to Bishop Northwold's work. All accounts agree that _three_  bays were destroyed. But if both choir and presbytery were of Early  English date, there must have been _four_ bays overthrown, because the  three Decorated bays now existing do not correspond in position to the  three destroyed, for the present third bay from the screen is where the  fourth bay was when the tower was standing.    No one could possibly have been found in the whole kingdom better  qualified to cope with the great disaster that took place at Ely in 1322  than the officer of the house who had the special custody of the fabric.  The originality and skill with which he designed and carried out the  noble work that takes the place of the central tower, which is without a  rival in the architecture of the whole world, are beyond all praise. The  exquisite work in the lady-chapel would in itself have been sufficient  to establish Walsingham's reputation as an architect of the very highest  order of merit; but it would have revealed nothing, if it stood alone,  of the consummate constructive genius which he displayed in the  conception of the octagon. Of the design itself we shall speak  hereafter. No time was lost in removing the mass of ruins; and we can  imagine, as the ground was cleared and the grandeur of the opportunity  gradually dawned upon Walsingham's mind, how he formed the design of  dispensing with the four central pillars, and thereby securing eight  instead of four for the support of his substitute for a central tower.  At the same time the weight which these supports would have to bear was  very much less than that of a massive tower of stone; so that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21007"],[0,"The Bird Study Book (#5)"],[1,"from a living pitch-pine  tree.  This, in itself, is very unusual for any of our eastern  Woodpeckers.  The bird, however, has a still stranger habit.  For two  or three feet above the {36} entrance hole, and for five or six feet  below it, all around the tree, innumerable small openings are dug  through to the inner bark.  From these little wells pour streams of  soft resin that completely cover the bark and give the trunk a white,  glistening appearance, which is visible sometimes for a quarter of a  mile.  Just why they do this has never been explained.  It is true,  however, that the sticky resin prevents ants and flying squirrels from  reaching the nest, and both of these are known to be troublesome to  eggs and young birds.    A simple plan, which is usually successful in finding out if a  Woodpecker is at home in its nesting hole, is to strike a few sharp  blows on the tree with some convenient club or rock.  After a little  treatment of this kind the bird will often come to the entrance and  look down, as if to inquire into the meaning of all the disturbance.  If the nest has been newly made many fragments of small chips of wood  will be found on the ground beneath the tree.    _Variety of Situations._--The student who takes up {37} the subject of  nest architecture will soon be impressed not only with the wide  assortment of materials used, but also with the wonderful variety of  situations chosen.    [Illustration: The Grebe or \"Water Witch\"]    The Grebe, or \"Water Witch,\" builds one of the most remarkable nests of  any American bird.  It is a floating raft, the buoyant part of which is  the green {38} stems of water plants, not bent over, but severed from  their roots and piled across one another.  On this platform is  collected decaying vegetation gathered from beneath the water.  Here  the eggs are deposited, and are carefully covered with more decaying  vegetation when the bird desires to be absent from the nest.    _Variation in Families._--Sometimes there is wide variety in the  character of the nests of different species classified as belonging to  the same family.  The Flycatcher group is a good example of this fact.  Here we have as one member of the family the Kingbird, that makes a  heavy bulky nest often on one of the upper, outermost limbs of an apple  tree.  The Wood Pewee's nest is a frail, shallow excuse for a nest,  resting securely on a horizontal limb of some well-grown tree.  Then  there is the Phoebe, that plasters its cup-shaped mass of nesting  material with mud, thus securing it to a rafter or other projection  beneath a bridge, outbuilding, or porch roof.  Still farther away from  the typical Flycatcher's {39} nest is that made by a perfectly regular  member of the family, the Great-crested Flycatcher.  The straw and  other substances it collects as a bed for its eggs and young is carried  into some hollow tree, old Woodpecker hole, or nesting box.  Often a  cast-off skin of a snake is used, and sometimes the end is permitted to  hang out of the hole--a sort of \"scare-crow,\" perhaps, intended for the  notice of annoying neighbours.    [Illustration: A male plumbous gnatcatcher feeding young]    _Meagre Nests._--Heretofore, mention has been made only of the nests of  birds built with much labour and usually constructed in trees or  bushes.  A very large number of species, however, lay their eggs on the  ground with little or no attempt to gather around or beneath them any  special nesting material.  The Killdeer's eggs are simply deposited in  a slight hole scratched in the earth, usually in an open field or on a  rocky hillside.  The only lining is a few grass blades or smooth  pebbles.  To protect them from enemies the birds depend much upon the  peculiar marking of the eggs, which makes them look like the {40}  ground on which they lie, and this seems to be a sufficient safeguard  for the eggs and offspring of the species.  The Nighthawk lays her two  eggs on the bare ground in a field or open woods; and the  Whip-poor-will's nest is on the fallen leaves of a thicket at any spot  which the bird happens to select.    The Gulls so common along our coast and about the larger lakes make  substantial nests, as a rule--but not always.  I have found them on the  islands along the coast of Maine containing not a dozen blades of  grass, a seemingly scant protection against the danger of rolling away  to destruction.    On the sandy islands of the Atlantic Coast, from Long Island southward,  many species of Terns make nests by simply burrowing a slight  depression in the sand among the sea-shells.  Some of the sea birds of  the far North, as, for example, the Murres and Auks, often lay their  eggs on the shelving cliffs exposed to the sweep of the ocean gales.  These are shaped as if designed by nature to prevent them rolling off  the rocks.  They are very large at one {41} end and toward the other  taper sharply.  When the wind blows they simply swing around in circles.    Although we sometimes speak of the bird's nest as its home, such really  is not the case, for the nest of the wild bird is simply the cradle for  the young.  When the little ones have flown it is seldom that either  they or their parents ever return to its shelter.          {42}    CHAPTER III    DOMESTIC LIFE OF THE BIRDS    It is a privilege to be so situated that one may watch from day to day  the occurrences about a wild bird's nest.  Here feathered life reaches  its greatest heights of emotion, and comedies and threatened tragedies  are of daily occurrence.  The people we know best are those whom we  have seen at their play and at their work, in moments of elation and  doubt, and in times of great happiness and dire distress.  And so it is  that he who has followed the activities of a pair of birds through all  the joys and anxieties of nest building, brooding, and of caring for  the young, may well lay claim to a close acquaintanceship with them.    In watching a nest one will learn, for example, that with most of our  small birds both parents engage in {43} the pleasant duty of feeding  the young, at times shielding the little ones from the hot rays of the  sun with their half-extended wings, and now and then driving away  intruders.  The common passerine birds also attend carefully to the  sanitation of the nest and remove the feces, which is inclosed in a  membrane and is thus easily carried in the bill.  This is usually  dropped several yards away.  If allowed to accumulate on the ground  beneath the nest it might attract the attention of some prowling enemy  and lead to a disastrous discovery.    _Parental Care of Young._--There is a wide difference in the relative  helplessness of nesting birds, and a corresponding difference in the  methods of parental care.  The young of praecocial birds are able to  run or swim with their parents almost as soon as hatched, for they not  only have the strength to do this, but their bodies being covered with  down they are protected from the sun or cold.  Examples of such birds  are the Quail, Grouse, Sandpipers, Plovers, and Ducks.  The young of  these and allied species are {44} able from the beginning to pick up  their food, and they quickly learn from the example of their parents  what is desirable.  Soon they are able to shift for themselves,  although one or both of the parents continue to attend them until grown.    With the altricial birds the young are hatched in an absolutely  helpless condition, being both blind and naked, and it is necessary  that they be fed by the parents, not only while occupying the nest, but  also for several weeks afterward.  To this group belong most of the  small birds we are accustomed to see about the house.  When newly born  the food they receive is first digested in the crop or the stomach of  the parent from which it is regurgitated into the mouth of the young.  Flickers, Hummingbirds, Doves, and some others continue to feed their  young in this manner, but usually the method soon gives way to that,  more commonly observed, of simply supplying soft-bodied insects which  have been captured and killed but not eaten.    In the case of Pelicans, Cormorants, and Ibises, {45} the young thrust  their bills far down the throats of the parents to procure the  regurgitated food.  From this custom the ancients may have got the idea  that Pelicans feed their young with their own life blood.  The  suggestion still persists, and on the seal of one of our large life  insurance companies of America a Pelican and her young are represented  accompanied with the motto: \"I live and die for those I love.\"  The  great seal of the State of Louisiana uses a similar picture without the  motto.    Hawks and Owls tear their prey to pieces and on this the young feed at  infrequent intervals.  Sometimes several hours pass between the visits  of the food-laden parents, but the supply is usually adequate when at  length it arrives.    _Sharing the Labours._--Most young birds, however, are fed with great  frequency.  For more than an hour one day the writer watched a pair of  Georgia Mockingbirds feeding their young.  The one that appeared to be  the female visited the nest with food on an average once every two  minutes, and the male {46} made a similar trip about once in twelve  minutes.  He could have done better had he not spent so much time  flying aimlessly about and scolding imaginary enemies.    Some birds have what seem to be very curious habits at the nesting  time.  The jealous-hearted Hornbill of the Old World never trusts his  spouse to wander away from the nest after her duties there once begin.  In order that he may always know just where she is he quite willingly  undertakes to supply her with all her food during the days while the  incubation of the eggs is going forward.  With mud he daubs up the  entrance to the hollow in the tree where she is sitting, leaving only a  small opening through which food may be passed.  When the"]]]
