Rupert was the more lively of the two, and  generally did the largest share of talking when they were together; but  Edgar, although he talked less, had the more lively sense of humour, and  the laughter that broke out in the garden was caused by some quiet  remark of his. Captain Clinton turned sharply round upon hearing a sigh  from his wife.    \"Well, Lucy, I know what you are thinking: another holiday over, and we  are no nearer to the truth. I own that our plan has failed so far, for I  can't see in either of the boys a shadow of resemblance either to you or  myself. Some people profess to see likenesses. Mr. Tomline remarked  yesterday that he should have known Rupert anywhere as my son, but then  Colonel Wilson said the day before that Edgar had got just your  expression. I don't see a scrap of likeness either way, and I begin to  think, dear, that I don't want to see it.\"    \"No, I don't want to see it either, Percy; I love one as well as the  other. Still I should like to know which is our own.\"    \"I used to think so too, Lucy; but I have been doubting for some time  about it, and now I am quite sure that I don't want to know. They are  both fine lads, and, as you say, we love one just as well as the other.  Parental instinct, you see, goes for nothing. I should like to know that  one of them was my son, but on the other hand I should be very sorry to  know that the other wasn't. I think, dear, that it is much better as it  is. We have got two sons instead of one; and after all, the idea that  there would be a great satisfaction in the real one inheriting all our  landed property has very little in it. There is plenty for them both,  and each of them will be just as happy on three thousand a year as he  would on six.    \"As matters stand now, I have divided the property as nearly as possible  equally between them. Madge, of course, will have her share; and I have  left it in my will that they shall draw lots which shall have the part  with the house and park on it, while the other is to have a sum of money  sufficient to build an equally good house on his share of the estate. We  can only hope that chance will be wiser than we, and will give the old  house to the right boy. However, whether our son or our adopted son,  whichever be which, gets it, does not concern me greatly. There is  enough for our son to hold a good position and be comfortable and happy.  Beyond this I do not trouble. At any rate the grievance, if there is a  grievance, is a sentimental one; while it would be a matter of real  grief to me should either of them, after having always looked upon us as  his parents, come to know that he does not belong to us, and that he has  been all along in a false position, and has been in fact but an  interloper here. That would be terribly hard for him--so hard that I  have ceased to wish that the matter should ever be cleared up, and to  dread rather than hope that I should discover an unmistakable likeness  to either of us in one or other of them.\"    \"You are right, Percy; and henceforth I will worry no more about it. It  would be hard, dreadfully hard, on either of them to know that he was  not our son; and henceforth I will, like you, try to give up wishing  that I could tell which is which. I hope they will never get to know  that there is any doubt about it.\"    \"I am afraid we can hardly hope that,\" Captain Clinton said. \"There are  too many people who know the story. Of course it was talked about at  every station in India at the time, and I know that even about here it  is generally known. No, it will be better some day or other to tell it  them ourselves, making, of course, light of the matter, and letting them  see that we regard them equally as our sons, and love and care for them  alike, and that even if we now knew the truth it could make no  difference in our feelings towards them. It is much better they should  learn it from us than from anyone else.\"    At eleven o'clock the dog-cart came to the door. The boys were ready.  Captain Clinton drove them to the station four miles away, and in two  hours after leaving home they arrived at Cheltenham with a large number  of their school-fellows, some of whom had been in the train when they  entered it, while others had joined them at Gloucester. At Cheltenham  there was a scramble for vehicles, and they were soon at the  boarding-house of Mr. River-Smith, which had the reputation of being the  most comfortable of the Cheltenham boarding-houses.    There was a din of voices through the house, and in the pleasure of  meeting again and of exchanging accounts of how the holidays had been  spent, the few lingering regrets that school-time had come round again  completely vanished. Then there was a discussion as to the football  prospects and who would get their house colours in place of those who  had gone, and whether River-Smith's was likely to retain the position it  had won by its victories over other houses in the previous season; and  the general opinion was that their chances were not good.    \"You see,\" Skinner, the captain of the team, said to a party gathered in  the senior boys' study, \"Harrison and White will be better than last  year, but Wade will of course be a great loss; his weight and strength  told tremendously in a scrimmage. Hart was a capital half-back too, and  there was no better goal-keeper in the college than Wilson. We have not  got any one to take their places, and there are four other vacancies in  the team, and in each case those who have left were a lot bigger and  stronger than any of the young ones we have got to choose from. I don't  know who they will be yet, and must wait for the trial matches before we  decide; but I think there is plenty of good material to choose from, and  we shall be nearly all up to last year's mark, except in point of  weight--there is a terrible falling off there, and we have no one who  can fill the place of Wade. He was as strong as a bull; yes, he is an  awful loss to us! There was not a fellow in the college who could go  through a grease as he could. You remember last year how he rolled those  fellows of Bishop's over and carried the ball right through them, and  then kicked the deciding goal? That was grand! Why don't some of you  fellows grow up like him?\" And he looked round reproachfully at his  listeners. \"Over thirteen stone Wade was, and there is not one of you  above eleven and a half--anyhow, not more than a few pounds.\"    \"Why don't you set us an example?\" Edgar Clinton asked; and there was a  laugh, for the captain of the team was all wire and muscle and could not  turn ten stone.    \"I am not one of that kind,\" he said; \"but there is Wordsworth, who is  pretty near six feet in length, and who, if he gave his mind to it and  would but eat his food quietly instead of bolting it, might put some  flesh on those spindle-shanks of his and fill himself out till he got  pretty near to Wade's weight. A fellow ought to do something for his  house, and I call it a mere waste of bone when a fellow doesn't put some  flesh on him.\"    \"I can run,\" Wordsworth said apologetically.    \"Yes, you can run when you get the ball,\" Skinner said in a tone of  disgust; \"but if a fellow half your height runs up against you, over you  go. You must lay yourself out for pudding, Wordsworth. With that, and  eating your food more slowly, you really might get to be of some use to  the house.\"    Wordsworth grumbled something about his having done his share last year.    \"It all depends what you think your share is,\" Skinner said severely.  \"You did your best, I have no doubt, and you certainly got a good many  goals, but that arose largely from the fact that there was nothing  tangible in you. You see, you were something like a jointed  walking-stick, and, naturally, it puzzled fellows. You have grown wider  a bit since then, and must therefore try to make yourself useful in some  other line. What we want is weight, and the sooner you put weight on the  better. I see Easton has not come yet.\"    \"He never comes until the evening train,\" another said. \"He always  declares it has something to do with cross lines not fitting in.\"    \"It takes him so long,\" Skinner growled, \"to fold up his things without  a crease, to scent his pocket-handkerchief, and to get his hair to his  satisfaction, that you may be quite sure he cannot make an early start.  As he is not here, and all the rest that are left out of last year's  team are, it is a good opportunity to talk him over. I did not like  having him in the team last year, though he certainly did better than  some. What do you think? Ought we to have him this year or not? I have  been thinking a lot about it.\"    \"I don't care for him,\" Scudamore said, \"but I am bound to say he does  put off all that finicking nonsense when he gets his football jersey on,  and plays a good, hard game, and does not seem to mind in the least how  muddy or dirty he gets. I should certainly put him in again, Skinner, if  I were you.\"    There was a murmur of assent from three or four of the others.    \"Well, I suppose he ought to play,\" Skinner said; \"but it does rile me  to see him come sauntering up as if it was quite an accident that he was  there, and talk in that drawling, affected sort of way.\"    \"It is riling,\" another said; \"but besides that I do not think there is  much to complain about him, and his making an ass of himself at other  times does not affect us so long as he plays well in the team.\"    \"No, I do not know that it does, but all the same it is a nuisance when  one fellow keeps himself to himself and never seems to go in for  anything.

General notice.      _Ahir, [13] Gaoli, Guala, Golkar, Gaolan, Rawat, Gahra, Mahakul._--The  caste, of cowherds, milkmen and cattle-breeders. In 1911 the Ahirs  numbered nearly 750,000 persons in the Central Provinces and Berar,  being the sixth caste in point of numbers. This figure, however,  excludes 150,000 Gowaris or graziers of the Maratha Districts,  and if these were added the Ahirs would outnumber the Telis and  rank fifth. The name Ahir is derived from Abhira, a tribe mentioned  several times in inscriptions and the Hindu sacred books. Goala,  a cowherd, from Gopala, [14] a protector of cows, is the Bengali  name for the caste, and Gaoli, with the same signification, is now  used in the Central Provinces to signify a dairyman as opposed to  a grazier. The Gaolans appear to be an inferior class of Gaolis in  Berar. The Golkars of Chanda may be derived from the Telugu Golars or  graziers, with a probable admixture of Gond blood. They are described  as wild-looking people scattered about in the most thickly forested  tracts of the District, where they graze and tend cattle. Rawat, a  corruption of Rajputra or a princeling, is the name borne by the Ahir  caste in Chhattisgarh; while Gahra is their designation in the Uriya  country. The Mahakul Ahirs are a small group found in the Jashpur  State, and said to belong to the Nandvansi division. The name means  'Great family.'        2. Former dominance of the Abhiras.      The Abhiras appear to have been one of the immigrant tribes from  Central Asia who entered India shortly before or about the commencement  of the Christian era. In the Puranas and Mahabharata they are spoken  of as Dasyu or robbers, and Mlechchhas or foreigners, in the story  which says that Arjuna, after he had burned the dead bodies of  Krishna and Balaram at Dwarka, was proceeding with the widows of the  Yadava princes to Mathura through the Punjab when he was waylaid by  the Abhiras and deprived of his treasures and beautiful women. [15]  An inscription of the Saka era 102, or A.D. 180, speaks of a grant  made by the Senapati or commander-in-chief of the state, who is  called an Abhira, the locality being Sunda in Kathiawar. Another  inscription found in Nasik and assigned by Mr. Enthoven to the fourth  century speaks of an Abhira king, and the Puranas say that after the  Andhrabhrityas the Deccan was held by the Abhiras, the west coast  tract from the Tapti to Deogarh being called by their name. [16]  In the time of Samudragupta in the middle of the fourth century  the Abhiras were settled in Eastern Rajputana and Malwa. [17] When  the Kathis arrived in Gujarat in the eighth century, they found the  greater part of the country in the possession of the Ahirs. [18] In the  Mirzapur District of the United Provinces a tract known as Ahraura is  considered to be named after the tribe; and near Jhansi another piece  of country is called Ahirwar. [19] Elliot states that Ahirs were also  Rajas of Nepal about the commencement of our era. [20] In Khandesh,  Mr. Enthoven states, the settlements of the Ahirs were important. In  many castes there is a separate division of Ahirs, such as the Ahir  Sunars, Sutars, Lohars, Shimpis, Salis, Guraos and Kolis. The fort  of Asirgarh in Nimar bordering on Khandesh is supposed to have been  founded by one Asa Ahir, who lived in the beginning of the fifteenth  century. It is said that his ancestors had held land here for seven  hundred years, and he had 10,000 cattle, 20,000 sheep and 1000 mares,  with 2000 followers; but was still known to the people, to whom  his benevolence had endeared him, by the simple name of Asa. This  derivation of Asirgarh is clearly erroneous, as it was known as  Asir or Asirgarh, and held by the Tak and Chauhan Rajputs from the  eleventh century. But the story need not on that account, Mr. Grant  says, [21] be set down as wholly a fable. Firishta, who records it,  has usually a good credit, and more probably the real existence of  a line of Ahir chieftains in the Tapti valley suggested a convenient  ethnology for the fortress. Other traditions of the past domination  of the pastoral tribes remain in the Central Provinces. Deogarh on  the Chhindwara plateau was, according to the legend, the last seat  of Gaoli power prior to its subversion by the Gonds in the sixteenth  century. Jatba, the founder of the Deogarh Gond dynasty, is said to  have entered the service of the Gaoli rulers, Mansur and Gansur, and  subsequently with the aid of the goddess Devi to have slain them and  usurped their kingdom. But a Gaoli chief still retained possession of  the fort of Narnala for a few years longer, when he also was slain by  the Muhammadans. Similarly the fort of Gawilgarh on the southern crest  of the Satpuras is said to be named after a Gaoli chief who founded  it. The Saugor traditions bring down the Gaoli supremacy to a much  later date, as the tracts of Etawa and Khurai are held to have been  governed by their chieftains till the close of the seventeenth century.        3. Ahir dialects.      Certain dialects called after the Abhiras or Ahirs still remain. One,  known as Ahirwati, is spoken in the Rohtak and Gurgaon Districts of  the Punjab and round Delhi. This is akin to Mewati, one of the forms  of Rajasthani or the language of Rajputana. The Malwi dialect of  Rajasthani is also known as Ahiri; and that curious form of Gujarati,  which is half a Bhil dialect, and is generally known as Khandeshi,  also bears the name of Ahirani. [22] The above linguistic facts seem  to prove only that the Abhiras, or their occupational successors,  the Ahirs, were strongly settled in the Delhi country of the Punjab,  Malwa and Khandesh. They do not seem to throw much light on the origin  of the Abhiras or Ahirs, and necessarily refer only to a small section  of the existing Ahir caste, the great bulk of whom speak the Aryan  language current where they dwell. Another authority states, however,  that the Ahirs of Gujarat still retain a dialect of their own, and  concludes that this and the other Ahir dialects are the remains of  the distinct Abhira language.        4. The Yadavas and Krishna.      It cannot necessarily be assumed that all the above traditions relate  to the Abhira tribe proper, of which the modern Ahir caste are scarcely  more than the nominal representatives. Nevertheless, it may fairly be  concluded from them that the Abhiras were widely spread over India  and dominated considerable tracts of country. They are held to have  entered India about the same time as the Sakas, who settled in Gujarat,  among other places, and, as seen above, the earliest records of the  Abhiras show them in Nasik and Kathiawar, and afterwards widely spread  in Khandesh, that is, in the close neighbourhood of the Sakas. It has  been suggested in the article on Rajput that the Yadava and other lunar  clans of Rajputs may be the representatives of the Sakas and other  nomad tribes who invaded India shortly before and after the Christian  era. The god Krishna is held to have been the leader of the Yadavas,  and to have founded with them the sacred city of Dwarka in Gujarat. The  modern Ahirs have a subdivision called Jaduvansi or Yaduvansi, that is,  of the race of the Yadavas, and they hold that Krishna was of the Ahir  tribe. Since the Abhiras were also settled in Gujarat it is possible  that they may have been connected with the Yadavas, and that this may  be the foundation for their claim that Krishna was of their tribe. The  Dyashraya-Kavya of Hemachandra speaks of a Chordasama prince reigning  near Junagarh as an Abhira and a Yadava. But this is no doubt very  conjectural, and the simple fact that Krishna was a herdsman would be  a sufficient reason for the Ahirs to claim connection with him. It is  pointed out that the names of Abhira chieftains given in the early  inscriptions are derived from the god Siva, and this would not have  been the case if they had at that epoch derived their origin from  Krishna, an incarnation of Vishnu. \"If the Abhiras had really been  the descendants of the cowherds (Gopas) whose hero was Krishna, the  name of the rival god Siva would never have formed components of the  names of the Abhiras, whom we find mentioned in inscriptions. Hence  the conclusion may safely be drawn that the Abhiras were by no means  connected with Krishna and his cowherds even as late as about A.D. 300,  to which date the first of the two inscriptions mentioned above is  to be assigned. Precisely the same conclusion is pointed to by the  contents of the Harivansha and Bhagwat Purana. The upbringing of  Krishna among the cowherds and his flirtations with the milkmaids are  again and again mentioned in these works, but the word Abhira does not  occur even once in this connection. The only words we find used are  Gopa, Gopi and Vraja. This is indeed remarkable. For the descriptions  of the removal of Krishna as an infant to Nanda, the cowherd's hut,  of his childhood passed in playing with the cowherd boys, and of his  youth spent in amorous sports with the milkmaids are set forth at  great length, but the word Abhira is not once met with. From this  only one conclusion is possible, that is, that the Abhiras did not  originally represent the Gopas of Krishna. The word Abhira occurs for  the first time in connection with the Krishna legend about A.D. 550,  from which it follows that the Abhiras came to be identified with  the Gopas shortly before that date.\" [23]    This argument is"]]]
