I found his hat    On Ararat,    And hurried on as quick as scat.      In a day or two    I found his shoe    Where he had sailed for Timbuktu.      I met the goat    That ate his coat    Upon the road to Terre Haute.      At last all worn    And quite forlorn    I chased him up the Matterhorn.            SOMEBODY        Somebody give me a peanut,    Somebody give me a pear;    I want to go down to the circus    And feed all the animals there.      [Illustration]            CONSOLATION        A dime and a dollar    Took me by the collar    And whispered this word in my ear:      \"We must leave you to-morrow,    But prithee don't sorrow,    We'll come back to see you next year.\"            THE ROBIN AND THE SQUIRREL        Said the Robin to the Squirrel,    \"How d' you do?\"    Said the Squirrel to the Robin,    \"How are you?\"    \"Oh, I've got some cherry pies,    And a half a dozen flies,    And a kettle full of beetles on to stew.\"      [Illustration]      Said the Squirrel to the Robin,    \"How d' you do?\"    Said the Robin to the Squirrel,    \"How are you?\"    \"I've a nest that's nice and neat,    And a wife that can't be beat,    And I'm every bit as happy now as you.\"            THE KING HAD A PLATTER        The King had a platter    Of brisket and batter,    The Prince had a Bellington bun,    The Queen had a rose    To put to her nose    As soon as the dinner was done.            [Illustration]      RAIN        The lightning split the sky in two    And set the clouds to leaking    Just as dear old Pastor Brown    Began his Sunday speaking.      He told about the awful rain    That fell in Noah's day,    And one by one the happy smiles    Began to fade away.      In half an hour the people all    Put on their rubber coats,    And when he finished everyone    Was out and building boats.            OLD FATHER McNETHER        Old Father McNether    He sorts out the weather    And takes what he pleases, I'm told,    With a big turkey-feather    He mixes the weather,    And makes it blow hot and blow cold.      [Illustration: OLD FATHER McNETHER]            JERRY WAS A JOKER        Jerry was a joker.    He carried off the poker    And dressed it up from head to heel    In clover-tops and orange-peel    And fed it bones and barley meal.    Poor old Rusty Poker!            [Illustration]      KING KOKEM        King Kokem lay snoozing upon his brass bed--    Oh, play an old tune on your fiddle!    With shoes on his feet, and a crown on his head--    Oh, tune up your rusty old fiddle!      He dreamed of a land where the lions were tame,    Where they fried their lamb-chops on a griddle,    Where they called all the parrots and monkeys by name--    Oh, play us a tune on your fiddle!      He dreamed of a sea filled with raspberry pop,    With a cocoanut isle in the middle,    Where the stones and the boulders had icing on top--    Go strike up a tune on your fiddle!      He dreamed of a sky where the moonbeams all danced    While a comet was telling a riddle,    Where the stars and the planets and sun-dogs all pranced    While the moon played his fiddle de diddle.      [Illustration]            [Illustration]      OLD MISSUS SKINNER        Old Missus Skinner    Had dumplings for dinner    And sat on a very high stool;    When she cut thru the hide    There was nothing inside,    Which I'm sure was not often the rule.            [Illustration: OH MOTHER, OH MOTHER, COME QUICKLY AND SEE]      OH, MOTHER        Oh, Mother, Oh, Mother,    Come quickly and see,    The house and the farmyard    Have gone on a spree.      The pig's in the pantry,    The chickens are out,    The parrot is perched    On the tea kettle spout.      And mercy, Oh, mercy,    Oh, what shall I do?    A rat has run off    With my very best shoe.            CELLA REE AND TOMMY TO        Two funny friends that you all know    Are Cella Ree and Tommy To.    About as queer as friends can be,    Are Tommy To and Cella Ree.    For hours they sit there grim and stable    Side by side upon the table.    Tom is red and Cella pale,    His blushes are of no avail;    She sits, in spite of his endeavor,    As firm and undisturbed as ever,    A funny pair, you must agree,    This Tommy To and Cella Ree.      [Illustration]            [Illustration]      IF I WERE RICHER        If I were richer    I'd buy a pitcher    With scenery on it.    'Jolica ware--    Storks here and there,    And a funny affair    With ladies on it.      In half a minute    I'd mix up in it    A wonderful drink--    Peppermint, ice,    Lemons and spice--    Taste pretty nice,    What do you think?            THE ARMY OF THE QUEEN        O the Army of the Queen,    The Army of the Queen,    Some are dressed in turkey-red    And some are dressed in green;    A colonel and a captain,    A corporal in between,    Their guns are filled with powder    And their swords are bright and keen;    So toot your little trumpet    For the Army of the Queen.      [Illustration: TOOT YOUR LITTLE TRUMPET FOR THE ARMY OF THE QUEEN]            ROMULUS        Romulus, Romulus,    Father of Rome,    Ran off with a wolf    And he wouldn't come home.      When he grew up    He founded a city    With an eagle, a bear,    And a tortoise-shell kitty.            [Illustration]      THE HERO        My dad was a soldier and fought in the wars,    My grandfather fought on the sea,    And the tales of their daring and valor of course    Put the sand and the ginger in me.      I'm not scared of tigers or any wild beast,    I could fight with a lion all right,    I wouldn't be 'fraid of a bear in the least--    Excepting, perhaps, in the night.      But sister, she's skeery as skeery can be,    She's even afraid of the bark of a tree.            PENSIVE PERCY        Percy when a little boy    Was quiet as a mouse,    He never set the barn afire    Nor battered down the house.      He used to sit for hours and hours    Just gazing at the moon,    And feeding little fishes    Sarsaparilla from a spoon.      [Illustration]            [Illustration]      MOON, O MOON IN THE EMPTY SKY        Moon, O Moon in the empty sky,    Why do you swing so low?    Pretty moon with the silver ring    And the long bright beams where the fairies cling,    Where do you always go?      I go to the land of the Siamese,    Ceylon and the Great Plateau,    Over the seas where Sinbad sailed,    Where Moses crossed and Pharaoh failed,--    There's where I always go.

I'll sing you twenty--    I've been hoping you would ask me all along.\"            WHENEVER I GO OUT TO WALK        Whenever I go out to walk,    All the geese begin to gawk;    And when I start to wander back,    All the ducks begin to quack.

BILLY BUMPKINS        Heigho, Billy Bumpkins,    How d' you grow your pumpkins?    \"At six o'clock I sows 'em,    At ten o'clock I hoes 'em,    An' jes before I goes to bed    I puts 'em in the pumpkin shed.\"      Tell us, Billy Bumpkins,    How d' you sell your pumpkins?    \"I lends 'em to the ladies,    I gives 'em to the babies,    An' trades a hundred for a kiss    To any pretty little miss.\"      [Illustration]            BLUE FLAMES AND RED FLAMES        Blue flames and red flames    In a world all dark;    Blue flames and red flames,    And a tiny spark    Hurrying to heaven, lest it should be late;    Lest the cautious seraphim close the shining gate,    And leave the little wanderer forevermore to fly    Like an orphan angel through the endless sky.            TIMOTHY GRADY        Poor little Timothy Grady    Screwed up his face at a lady,    And, jiminy jack!    It wouldn't come back.    The louder he hollered    The tighter it grew,    His eyes are all red    And his lips are all blue.    Oh, mercy me, what in the world will he do?    Poor little Timothy Grady!            CAPTAIN TICKLE AND HIS NICKEL        Captain Tickle had a nickel    In a paper sack,    He threw it in the river    And he couldn't get it back.    Captain Tickle spent his nickel    For a rubber ball,    And when he cut it open    There was nothing there at all.
