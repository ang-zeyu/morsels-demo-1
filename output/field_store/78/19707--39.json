And unless the husband is a broad-minded  man and loves her truly and unless she made a clean breast of  everything to him before marriage, her life is continuous torture. But  even if the girl escaped pregnancy, the mere finding out that she had  an illicit experience deprives her of social standing, or makes her a  social outcast and entirely destroys or greatly minimizes her chances  of ever marrying and establishing a home of her own. She must remain a  lonely wanderer to the end of her days.    The enormous difference in the results of a misstep in a boy and a  girl is clearly seen, and for this reason alone, if for no other, sex  instruction is of more importance to the girl than it is to the boy.    But there are other important reasons, and one of them is beautifully  and truthfully expressed by Byron in his two well-known lines.        Man's love is of man's life a thing apart,      'Tis woman's whole existence.    Yes, love is a woman's whole life.    Some modern women might object to this. They might say that this was  true of the woman of the past, who was excluded from all other avenues  of human activity. The woman of the present day has other interests  besides those of Love. But I claim that this is true of only a small  percentage of women; and in even this small minority of women, social,  scientific and artistic activities cannot take the place of love; no  matter how busy and successful these women may be, they will tell you  if you enjoy their confidence that they are unhappy, if their love  life is unsatisfactory. Nothing, nothing can fill the void made by the  lack of love. The various activities may help to cover up the void, to  protect it from strange eyes, they cannot fill it. For essentially  woman is made for love. Not exclusively, but essentially, and a woman  who has had no love in her life has been a failure. The few exceptions  that may be mentioned only emphasize the rule.    But not only psychically is a woman's love and sex life more important  than a man's, physically she is also much more cognizant of her sex  and much more hampered by the manifestation of her sex nature than  man is. To take but one function, menstruation. From the age 13 or 14  to the age of forty-five or fifty it is a monthly reminder to woman  that she is a woman, that she is a creature of sex; and, while to many  women this periodically recurring function is only a source of some  annoyance or discomfort, to a great number it is a cause of pain,  headache, suffering, or complete disability. Man has no such  phenomenon to annoy him practically his whole life.    But more important are the results of love-union, of sex relations. A  man after a sexual relation is just as free as he was before. A woman,  if the relation has resulted in a pregnancy, which is generally the  case, unless special pains are taken it should not so result, has nine  troublesome months before her, months of discomfort if not of actual  suffering; she then has an extremely trying and painful ordeal, that  of childbirth, and then there is another trying period, the period of  lactation or of nursing and of bringing up the baby. The penalty seems  almost too great.    And when the woman is on the point of ceasing to menstruate she does  not do so smoothly and comfortably. She has to go through a period  called the menopause, which may last one or two years and which may  bring discomforts and dangers of its own. Man does not have to go  through such a distinct period of demarcation separating his sexual  from his non-sexual life. Altogether it cannot be denied that woman is  much more a slave of her sex nature than man is of his. Yes, Nature  has handicapped woman much more heavily than she has man.    In short, both in view of the fact that sexual ignorance with its  possible missteps has much more disastrous consequences for the girl  than it has for the boy, and in view of the fact that the sex instinct  and its physical and psychic manifestations occupy a much more  important part in woman's life than they do in the life of man, we  consider the necessity of sex instruction much greater in the case of  woman than in the case of man. I do not wish to be misunderstood as  underestimating the need of sex instruction for the male--only I  consider the need even greater in the case of the female.

The organs which primarily distinguish one sex from the other are the  sex organs. It is by the aid of the sex organs that children are  begotten and brought into the world, that the race is _reproduced_ and  perpetuated. It is for this reason that the sex organs are also called  the Reproductive Organs.    The first thing we must do is to become familiar with the _structure_  and _location_ of the sex organs; in other words, we must get a fair  idea of their _Anatomy_.    The female sex organs, also called the reproductive or generative  organs, are divided into internal and external. The internal are the  most important and consist of: the ovaries, Fallopian tubes, uterus  or womb, and vagina. The external sex organs of the female are: the  vulva, hymen, and clitoris. Among the external organs are also  generally included the mons Veneris and the breasts or mammary glands.      SUBCHAPTER A    THE INTERNAL SEX ORGANS        [Illustration: OVARY.]    =The Ovaries.= The ovaries are the essential organs of reproduction.  For it is they that generate the eggs, or _ova_, or _ovules_, which,  after becoming _fertilized_ or _fecundated_ by the spermatozoa of the  male, develop into children. Without the ovaries of the female, the  same as without the testicles of the male (to which they correspond),  no children could be begotten, and the entire human race would quickly  disappear from our planet. The ovaries are two in number; they are  embedded in the _broad ligaments_ which support the womb in the  pelvis, one on each side of the womb. They are of a grayish or whitish  pink color, and are about an inch and a half long, three-quarters of  an inch wide, and one-third of an inch thick. They weigh from  one-eighth to one-quarter of an ounce. Their surface is either smooth  or rough and puckered. Think of a large blanched almond and you will  have a pretty fair idea of the size and shape of an ovary.    =The Fallopian Tubes.= The Fallopian tubes (so called from Fallopius,  a great anatomist, who discovered them; also called oviducts: egg  conductors, because they conduct the eggs from the ovary into the  uterus) are two very thin tubes, extending one from each upper angle  of the womb to the ovaries; but at their ovarian end they expand into  a fringed and trumpet-shaped extremity. The fringes are referred to as  _fimbria_. They are about five inches long and only about  one-sixteenth of an inch in diameter; the function of the tubes is to  catch the ova as they burst forth from the ovaries and to convey them  to the uterus. Taking into consideration the very narrow _lumen_, or  _caliber_, of the Fallopian tubes, it is easy to understand why even a  very slight inflammation is apt to clog them up, to seal their mouths  or openings, thus rendering the woman _sterile_, or incapable of  having children. For, if the Fallopian tubes are \"clogged\" up, the  eggs, or ova, have no way of reaching the uterus.    The Greek name for the Fallopian tube is salpinx (salpinx in Greek  means tube). An inflammation of the Fallopian tube is therefore called  salpingitis. (A salpingitis has the same effect in causing sterility  in the female as has an epididymitis in the male.) Salpingectomy is  the cutting away of the whole or of a piece of the Fallopian tube  (corresponds to vasectomy in the male).    =The Uterus.= The uterus or womb is the organ in which the fertilized  ovum, or egg, grows and develops into a child. It is a hollow muscular  organ, about the size of a pear, with thick walls, capable under the  influence of pregnancy of great expansion and growth. The broad part  of the pear is called the _body_ of the uterus; the lower narrow part  is called the _neck_ of the uterus, or _cervix_. The uterus in the  adult girl or woman is about three inches long, two inches broad in  its upper part and nearly an inch thick. It weighs from an ounce to an  ounce and a half. When the uterus is in a pregnant condition, it  increases enormously, both in size and in weight, as we will see in a  future chapter. The cavity of the uterus is somewhat triangular in  shape; at each upper angle is the small opening communicating with the  Fallopian tube; the upper portion of the uterus is called the fundus;  the external opening of the womb, situated in the center of the  cervix, is called the mouth of the womb, or the _os_, or external os.       [Illustration: 1. OPENINGS INTO THE FALLOPIAN TUBES. 2. MOUTH OF     THE WOMB.]    The uterus is situated in the center of the pelvis, between the  bladder and the rectum. It is supported by certain ligaments, the  chief of which are the broad ligaments; but, on account of general  weakness, too hard physical labor, or lifting heavy weights, the  ligaments may stretch, and the uterus may sink down low in the vagina,  and we then have the condition known as prolapse of the womb. Or, the  womb may turn forward, when we have a condition of _anteversion_. If  the womb is _bent_ (or _flexed_) forward on itself the condition is  called _anteflexion_. If the womb is turned backwards, the condition  is called _retroversion_; if it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21880"],[0,"The Medallic History of the United States of America 1776-1876 (#5)"],[1,"    and the rank of the donee, _individuality_. To obtain the       likeness, a first-rate miniature painter should, of course, be       employed.         The _reverse_ receives the device, appropriate to the events       commemorated. To obtain this, it is suggested that the       resolutions and despatches, belonging to the subject, be       transmitted to a master in the art of design--say Prof. Weir, at       West Point--for a drawing--including, if practicable, this       inscription:                                  PALO ALTO;                           RESACA DE LA PALMA:                           MAY 8 AND 9, 1846.         A third artist--all to be well paid--is next to be employed--a       die-sinker. The mint of the United States will do the coinage.         Copies, in cheaper metal, of all our gold medals, should be given       to the libraries of the Federal and State Governments, to those       of the colleges, etc.         The medals voted by the Revolutionary Congress were       executed--designs and dies--under the superintendence of Mr.       Jefferson,[12] in Paris, about the year 1786. Those struck in       honour of victories, in our War of 1812, were all--at least so       far as it respected the land service--done at home, and not one       of them presented, I think, earlier than the end of Mr. Monroe's       administration (1825). The delay principally resulted from the       want of good die-sinkers. There was only one of mediocre merit       (and he a foreigner) found for the army. What the state of this       art may now be in the United States I know not. But I beg leave       again to suggest that the honour of the country requires that       medals, voted by Congress, should always exhibit the arts       involved, in their highest state of perfection _wherever_ found:       for letters, science, and the fine arts constitute but _one_       republic, embracing the world. So thought our early Government,       and Mr. Jefferson--a distinguished member of that general       republic.         All which is respectfully submitted to the Secretary of War.                       [Footnote 12: This is an error. See page xi.]    Whatever may be the weight of General Scott's opinion on such a   (p. xxvi)  subject, and whether or not it is important, as he insists, that  medals should possess high artistic value, in order that they may be  not only the rewards of merit and monuments of history, but also  favorable specimens of contemporary art, it must be acknowledged that  those struck since 1840 differ widely, in many respects, from those of  the preceding period. While the earlier works are of a pure and lofty  style, the later ones are not always in good taste. The former are  conceived generally in strict observance of classical rules, and will  bear comparison with the numismatic masterpieces of antiquity; the  latter reflect the realistic tendency of their day.    The Indian medals, with the exception of that of President Jefferson  and a few others, which are very fine, possess only an historic value.  These pieces owe their origin to the custom, in the colonial times, of  distributing to the chiefs of Indian tribes, with whom treaties were  concluded, medals bearing on the obverse the effigy of the reigning  British sovereign, and on the reverse friendly legends and emblems of  peace. Mr. Kean, member of the Continental Congress from South  Carolina, on April 20, 1786, moved: \"That the Board of Treasury  ascertain the number and value of the medals received by the  commissioners appointed to treat with the Indians, from said Indians,  and have an equal number, with the arms of the United States, made of  silver, and returned to the chiefs from whom they were received.\" The  result was the Indian series, which bear on their obverses the busts  of the respective Presidents under whom they were issued (none   (p. xxvii)  exists of President Harrison, who died a month after his inauguration);  but it should be borne in mind that these are mere Indian peace  tokens, struck only for distribution as presents to friendly chiefs.    I have called in question the discernment of some of the Federal  administrations in their choice of engravers; unfortunately, I have  also to draw attention to an unaccountable delay in the execution of  one of the medals. It seems scarcely credible that the one voted in  1857 to Dr. Elisha Kent Kane for his discoveries in the Arctic Seas  has not yet been struck. Elder, in his \"Life of E. K. Kane\" (page  228), says:         \"Congress having failed at its first session after his (Kane's)       return to appropriate, by a national recognition, the honors he       had won for his country, had no other opportunity for repairing       the neglect till after his death; then a gold medal was ordered,       of which, I believe, nothing has been heard since the passage of       the resolution.\"    To complete my undertaking, it was necessary not only to study the  composition and history of all our national medals, but also to have  plates of them engraved, which could only be done from the originals  or copies, or, as a last resort, from casts.    My first step was to apply to the Mint in Philadelphia for bronze  copies of all the medals. In 1855 the director of that establishment  had been authorized by the Secretary of the Treasury, to strike from  the original dies, copies of the medals for sale, as is the custom at  the Paris Mint. But when he sought to avail himself of this  authorization, it was discovered that many of the dies were missing.  It was thought probable that those of the medals which had been (p. xxviii)  struck in France during the War of Independence would be found there,  and the French Government was communicated with, in 1861, in regard to  the following: \"Washington before Boston; General Wayne, for capture  of Stony Point; Colonel Fleury, for same; Captain Stewart, for same;  Major Lee, for capture of Paulus Hook; Colonel John Eager Howard, for  Cowpens; Colonel William Washington, for same; Major-General Greene,  for Eutaw Springs; Captain John Paul Jones, for capture of the Serapis  by the Bonhomme Richard.\"[13]                       [Footnote 13: See H, page xlvii.]    But the Paris Mint possessed only the dies of the two Washington, of  the Howard, and of the John Paul Jones medals; moreover, the rules of  that establishment did not permit them to be given up. Bronze copies  of the four were obtained, however, and from them Messrs. George  Eckfeldt and R. Jefferson of the Philadelphia Mint cut new dies.    In Washington, in January, 1872, I was informed by Mr. Spofford, of  the Library of Congress, that after the fire which destroyed a portion  of that library, December 24, 1851, the bronze copies of the medals  formerly deposited there had been transferred to the Smithsonian  Institution. At the latter place I was shown the remains of the  collection, all more or less injured by fire. Moreover, the five  wanted were not to be found; and further investigations made in  December, 1877, in the Philadelphia Mint, showed that four of the  dies, namely, those of Generals Greene and Wayne, and of  Lieutenant-Colonel de Fleury and Major Stewart, are still missing from  that establishment.    During the year 1872, I obtained permission from the Honorable  Hamilton Fish, Secretary of State, to examine in the archives of  (p. xxix)  his department the official papers relating to the medals of the War  of Independence, and was fortunate enough to find the correspondence  concerning the Diplomatic medal between Jefferson, William Short, the  Marquis de la Luzerne, and the Count de Moustier. Afterward, in the  reports of the Massachusetts Historical Society (vol. vi., 3d series),  I found a description which seemed to apply to this same medal. I then  went to Philadelphia to see the writer of the description, Joshua  Francis Fisher, Esq., but he was on his death-bed, and it was  impossible to prosecute the inquiry. After his decease, I was informed  that no medal of the kind described was contained in his collection.    In 1790, President Washington ordered two Diplomatic medals to be  struck and presented, one to the Marquis de la Luzerne, French  Minister to the United States, and the other to his successor, the  Count de Moustier. In Paris, in 1874, I made application to the  present heads of those families, the Count de Vibray[14] and the  Marquis de Moustier,[15] for information concerning these medals; but  no trace of the object of my search could be found among their family  papers.                       [Footnote 14: The Count de Vibray is the                     representative in the female line of the de la                     Luzerne family, which is extinct in the male line.]                       [Footnote 15: The Marquis de Moustier is the                     great-grandson of the Count de Moustier.]    About this time, Mr. Charles I. Bushnell, of New York city, kindly  sent me plaster casts of an obverse and of a reverse, in which I at  once recognized the Diplomatic medal, but neither bore the signature  of Dupre. Nevertheless, I had a plate engraved from them, hoping by  its aid to find the original.    I then turned once more to M. Gatteaux, the son of M. Nicolas      (p. xxx)  Marie Gatteaux, who had shown me, in 1868, in his house in the Rue de  Lille, Paris, the wax model of the obverse of the medal of General  Gates, and the designs for those of General Wayne and Major Stewart,  but, the house having been burnt during the reign of the Commune in  1871, he could furnish no information, and I was as far as ever from  discovering the original of this piece.    In 1876 I showed to M. Augustin Dumont, the celebrated sculptor,[16]  and the godson of Augustin Dupre, the plate engraved from the plaster  casts, and from him I learned that M. Narcisse Dupre, the son of  Augustin, was still living in the south of France, at Montpellier. M."]]]
