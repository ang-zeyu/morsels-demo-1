So I called upon him, either that same day or the next;       and I found that he, like most other people, had read the passage       in Vasari's life of Giotto, in which it is explicitly said, that       the portrait of Dante had been painted with others in the Palazzo       del Podesta, and was to be seen at the time the historian was       writing; but that he had not read, or had not put any confidence       in, the note of the Florence edition of Vasari published in       1832--1838, in which it is stated, that the Palazzo del Podesta had       now become a prison--the Bargello; that the Chapel had been turned       into a _dispensa_, (it was more like a coal-hole where the rags and       much of the filth of the prison was deposited); that the walls of       this dispensa exhibited nothing but a dirty coating, and that       Moreni speaks of the painting in some published work; the annotator       concluding thus--'It is hoped that some day or other we shall be       able to see what there is under the coating of the walls.' So       everybody hoped that some day or other the thing would be done, but       nobody set about heartily to do it; and it is inconceivable to me       that Mr. Kirkup, who shows in this letter, if it be his, such       jealousy for the credit of the recovery, should have lived so many       years in Florence either entirely ignorant of that which every       shop-boy knew, or knowing there were chances of bringing such a       treasure to light, that he should have never moved one step for       that purpose. That Mr. Kirkup took no active part in this matter at       any time, is quite proved by two admissions I find in the letter of       your correspondent. He first says, 'I remember that the first time       I passed to the Bargello to see it, I found Marini on a scaffold,'       &c. The fact is, that several months had elapsed between the first       presentation of the memorial and the erection of the scaffold,       during which Mr. Kirkup admits that he never thought of visiting       the place, while I had spent hours and hours there, under not very       pleasant circumstances, and had detected raised aureolas and other       evidences of old fresco. But he continues--'Marini was permitted to       return to the work on account of the government; and at that point       Bezzi returned to England. It was _some months afterwards that I       heard that Marini had found certain figures_, and soon afterwards       the discovery of Dante himself\" (sic.) These two passages       sufficiently show the nature of Mr. Kirkup's labors, and how far he       was really eager in the pursuit of this object, both during the       time when I was most deeply engaged in it, and also for 'some       months' after I had quitted Florence. But to resume: Mr. Kirkup,       however ignorant, or culpably negligent, or a little of both, he       might previously have been on the subject, yet when I brought it       before him, he at once admitted its importance, and made a liberal       offer of money, if any should be required, to carry out the       experiment. Thus encouraged by Mr. Wilde and by Mr. Kirkup, I       sought and found among English, American, and Italian friends and       acquaintances, many that were ready to assist the plan. Then it was       that I drew up a memorial to the Grand Duke; not because I am an       'advocate,' as your correspondent is pleased to call me, for that       is not the case, but simply because, having taken pains to organize       the means of working out the common object, the cooeperators thought       that I could best represent what this common object was. In the       memorial, I stated that, according to what Vasari, Moreni, and       others had written, it was just possible that a treasure was lying       hidden under the dirty coatings of the walls of the dispensa in the       Bargello; that a society was already formed for the purpose of       seeking with all care for this treasure; that all expenses would be       gladly borne by the society; that should anything be found, we       would either leave the paintings untouched, or have them removed at       our expense to the gallery of the Uffizi, and that we begged of the       Grand Duke the necessary sanction to begin our operations. The       answer was favorable, and I was referred to Marchese Nerli, and to       the Director of the Academy, to make the necessary arrangements.       Then the real difficulties began: first, I was put off on account       of the precautions that were to be taken in working in a prison;       then, the Director was ill, or unavoidably engaged, or absent; I       found, in short, that the object was to tire me out, and that I had       to contend with the same power that had defeated Moreni and my       other predecessors in the attempt. This battle continued many       months. I have already spoken too much of my share in the pursuit       of this object, and I will not enter into further details--some of       them ludicrous--of this contention; but I will say explicitly,       that, besides his encouragement, and his repeated offers of money,       (which were not accepted because money was not wanted, at least not       to any amount, and what was wanted I furnished myself,) Mr. Kirkup       did not afford me any assistance. At this stage of the business, I       met indeed with a most valuable ally, without whom I believe I       should have been beaten; and that was Paolo Feroni, a Florentine       nobleman and artist, to whom I have before expressed and now repeat       my best acknowledgments. At the end of this long contention against       obstacles which often eluded my grasp, the Grand Duke, in       consequence of a second memorial I presented to him, issued a       decree appointing a commission to carry out the proposed       experiments. This commission was composed of two members I had       myself proposed, viz. the sculptor Bartolini, and the Marchese       Feroni, of myself, of the Direttore of the Edifizi Pubblici Machese       Nerli, and of the Direttore of the Accademia delle Arti, the two       latter ex-officio: further, the decree declines the proposed       voluntary subscriptions, and places at the disposal of the       Commissioners a sum of money which proved more than sufficient to       cover all the expenses of the restoration of the fresco. The       Commissioners employed the painter Marini, and the happy result of       his carefulness and ability is now before the world.         \"I will now conclude by asserting, that I had nothing to do with       what has been said or written at Florence of this recovery, either       in the _Strenna_, or at the meeting of the Scienziati, which was       held in 1841, I believe, and at which the fresco of Giotto was       naturally a great object of interest. I left Florence in May 1840,       before the portrait of Dante was actually uncovered, so that I only       saw a portion of the fresco. I have never heard, or read, or said,       or written, anything tending to disparage the real cooeperation of       Mr. Kirkup, or of my late lamented friend Mr. Wilde, or of anybody       else in this matter,--nay, that it was at my request that the       editor of the English translation of Kugler's Handbook of the       History of Painting, published in 1842, has in the preface of that       book mentioned Mr. Kirkup as having assisted materially in the       recovery. Besides the Marchese Feroni and the artist Signor Marini,       there are many disinterested witnesses who have stated, and if       called upon will repeat again, all the material points of my       narrative; but, better than all, there is now in London an English       gentleman, whom I am happy to be allowed to call my friend, who was       in Florence part of the time, and saw with his own eyes the share I       had in this laborious undertaking, which ought not to have brought       this bitter contention upon me: he was an intimate friend of Mr.       Wilde, with whom he had a long correspondence on this very subject,       after Mr. Wilde's return to America.\"    We believe Mr. Bezzi is in error as to the incompleteness of Mr. Wilde's  Life of Dante. Mr. Wilde, more than a year before his death, informed us  that his work was nearly ready for the printer; and at the same time he  confided to us for perusal his admirable translations of specimens of  Italian Lyric Poets. We hope the descendants of our learned and  ingenious friend will place these works, so creditable to his temper,  scholarship, and genius, before the world.          GEORGE CORNEWALL LEWIS.      A work on _The Influence of Authority in Matters of Opinion_ has lately  attracted much and apparently well-deserved attention in England. It is  by George Cornewall Lewis, M.P. for Herefordshire, and Under Secretary  of State for the Home Department. He is the eldest son of the Right  Honorable Sir Thomas Frankland Lewis, Bart., M.P. for Radnor District,  was born in London, in 1806, and received his school education at Eton,  which he entered in 1819, and where he was a pupil of Doctor Hawtrey,  the present head master. The _Illustrated London News_ furnishes the  following particulars of his subsequent career:    At Christmas, 1824, he left Eton, and in the following year entered  Christ Church, Oxford, where as a student he was one of the few who gave  attention to modern languages, and especially German, from which,  jointly with Mr. Tufnell, he translated Mueller's \"Dorians.\" In 1828 he  took his University degree as a first-class man in classics, and a  second-class in mathematics. In the same year he entered"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21530"],[0,"The Angel of Terror (#5)"],[1,"time, Miss Briggerland,\" he said,  \"and you're likely to want. You have arrived just a little too late.\"    The girl's eyes fell upon the parson.    \"Too late,\" she said slowly, \"then he is married?\"    She bit her red lips and nodded, then she looked at Lydia, and the blue  eyes were expressionless.    Meredith had disappeared. Lydia looked round for him in her distress,  but he had gone. She wondered if he had gone out to the police, to make  his surrender, and she was still wondering when there came the sound of  a shot.    It was from the outside of the house, and at the sound Glover ran  through the doorway, crossed the hall and flew into the open. It was  still snowing, and there was no sign of any human being. He raced along  a path which ran parallel with the house, turned the corner and dived  into a shrubbery. Here the snow had not laid, and he followed the garden  path that twisted and turned through the thick laurel bushes and ended  at a roughly-built tool house. As he came in sight of the shed he  stopped.    A man lay on the ground, his arm extended, his head in a pool of blood,  his grey hand clutching a revolver.    Jack uttered an exclamation of horror and ran to the side of the fallen  man.    It was James Meredith, and he was dead.          Chapter V      Jack Glover heard footsteps coming down the path, and turned to meet a  man who had \"detective\" written largely all over him. Jack turned and  looked down again at the body as the man came up.    \"Who is this?\" asked the officer sharply.    \"It is James Meredith,\" said Jack simply.    \"Dead?\" said the officer, startled. \"He has committed suicide!\"    Jack did not reply, and watched the inspector as he made his brief,  quick examination of the body. A bullet had entered just below the left  temple, and there was a mark of powder near the face.    \"A very bad business, Mr. Glover,\" said the police officer seriously.  \"Can you account for this man being here?\"    \"He came to get married,\" said Jack listlessly. \"I dare say that  startles you, but it is the fact. He was married less than ten minutes  ago. If you will come up to the house I will explain his presence here.\"    The detective hesitated, but just then another of his comrades came on  the scene, and Jack led the way back to the house through a back door  into Rennett's study.    The lawyer was waiting for them, and he was alone.    \"If I'm not very much mistaken, you're Inspector Colhead, of Scotland  Yard,\" said Glover.    \"That is my name,\" nodded the officer. \"Between ourselves, Mr. Glover, I  don't think I should make any statement which you are not prepared to  verify publicly.\"    Jack noted the significance of the warning with a little smile, and  proceeded to tell the story of the wedding.    \"I can only tell you,\" he said in answer to a further inquiry, \"that Mr.  Meredith came into this house at a quarter to eight this morning, and  surrendered himself to my partner. At eight o'clock exactly, as you are  well aware, Mr. Rennett telephoned to Scotland Yard to say that Mr.  Meredith was here. During the period of his waiting he was married.\"    \"Did a parson happen to be staying here, sir?\" asked the police officer  sarcastically.    \"He happened to be staying here,\" said Jack calmly, \"because I had  arranged for him to be here. I knew that if it was humanly possible, Mr.  Meredith would come to this house, and that his desire was to be  married, for reasons which my partner will explain.\"    \"Did you help him to escape? That is asking you a leading question,\"  smiled the detective.    Jack shook his head.    \"I can answer you with perfect truth that I did not, any more than the  Home Secretary helped him when he gave him permission to go to a nursing  home.\"    Soon after the detective returned to the shed, and Jack and his partner  were left alone.    \"Well?\" said Rennett, in a shaking voice, \"what happened?\"    \"He's dead,\" said Jack quietly.    \"Suicide?\"    Jack looked at him oddly.    \"Did Bulford commit suicide?\" he asked.    \"Where is the angel?\"    \"I left her in the drawing-room with Mrs. Rennett and Miss Beale.\"    \"Mrs. Meredith,\" corrected Jack quietly.    \"This complicates matters,\" said Rennett, \"but I think we can get out of  our share of the trouble, though it is going to look a little black.\"    They found the three women in the drawing-room. Lydia, looking very  white, came to meet them.    \"What happened?\" she asked, and then she guessed from his face. \"He's  not dead?\" she gasped.    Jack nodded. All the time his eyes were on the other girl. Her  beautiful lips were drooped a little. There was a look of pain and  sorrow in her eyes that caught his breath.    \"Did he shoot himself?\" she asked in a low voice.    Jack regarded her coldly.    \"The only thing that I am certain about,\" and Lydia winced at the  cruelty in his voice, \"is that you did not shoot him, Miss Briggerland.\"    \"How dare you!\" flamed Jean Briggerland. The quick flush that came to  her cheek was the only other evidence of emotion she betrayed.    \"I dare say a lot,\" said Jack curtly. \"You asked me if it is a case of  suicide, and I tell you that it is not--it is a case of murder. James  Meredith was found with a revolver clutched in his right hand. He was  shot through the left temple, and if you'll explain to me how any man,  holding a pistol in a normal way, can perform that feat, I will accept  your theory of suicide.\"    There was a dead silence.    \"Besides,\" Jack went on, with a little shrug, \"poor Jimmy had no  pistol.\"    Jean Briggerland had dropped her eyes, and stood there with downcast  head and compressed lips. Presently she looked up.    \"I know how you feel, Mr. Glover,\" she said gently. \"I can well  understand, believing such dreadful things about me as you do, that you  must hate me.\"    Her mouth quivered and her voice grew husky with sorrow.    \"I loved James Meredith,\" she said, \"and he loved me.\"    \"He loved you well enough to marry somebody else,\" said Jack Glover, and  Lydia was shocked.    \"Mr. Glover,\" she said reproachfully, \"do you think it is right to say  these things, with poor Mr. Meredith lying dead?\"    He turned slowly toward her, and she saw in his humorous eyes a hardness  that she had not seen before.    \"Miss Briggerland has told us that I hate her,\" he said in an even  voice, \"and she spoke nothing but the truth. I hate her perhaps beyond  understanding--Mrs. Meredith.\" He emphasised the words, and the girl  winced. \"And one day, if the Circumstantialists spare me----\"    \"The Circumstantialists,\" said Jean Briggerland slowly. \"I don't quite  understand you.\"    Jack Glover laughed, and it was not a pleasant laugh.    \"Perhaps you will,\" he said shortly. \"As to your loving poor Jim--well,  you know best. I am trying to be polite to you, Miss Briggerland, and  not to gloat over the fact that you arrived too late to stop this  wedding! And shall I tell you why you arrived too late?\" His eyes were  laughing again. \"It was because I had arranged with the vicar of St.  Peter's to be here at nine o'clock this morning, well knowing that you  and your little army of spies would discover the hour of the wedding,  and would take care to be here before. And then I secretly sent for an  old Oxford friend of mine to be here at eight--he was here last night.\"    Still she stood regarding him without visible evidence of the anger  which Lydia thought would have been justified.    \"I had no desire to stop the wedding,\" said the girl, in a low, soft  voice. \"If Jim preferred to be married in this way to somebody who does  not know him, I can only accept his choice.\" She turned to the girl and  held out her hand. \"I am very sorry that this tragedy has come to you,  Mrs. Meredith,\" she said. \"May I wish you a greater happiness than any  you have found?\"    Lydia was touched by the sincerity, hurt a little by Glover's  uncouthness, and could only warmly grip the little hand that was held  out to her.    \"I'm sorry too,\" she said a little unsteadily. \"For you more than  for--anything else.\"    The girl lowered her eyes and again her lips quivered, and then without  a word she walked out of the room, pulling her sable wrap about her  throat.    It was noon before Rennett's car deposited Lydia Meredith at the door of  her lodging.    She found Mrs. Morgan in a great state of anxiety, and the stout little  woman almost shed tears of joy at the sight of her.    \"Oh, miss, you've no idea how worried I've been,\" she babbled, \"and  they've been round here from your newspaper office asking where you are.  I thought you had been run over or something, and the _Daily Megaphone_  have sent to all the hospitals----\"    \"I have been run over,\" said Lydia wearily. \"My poor mind has been under  the wheels of a dozen motor-buses, and my soul has been in a hundred  collisions.\"    Mrs. Morgan gaped at her. She had no sense of metaphor.    \"It's all right, Mrs. Morgan,\" laughed her lodger over her shoulder as  she went up the stairs. \"I haven't really you know, only I've had a  worrying time--and by the way, my name is Meredith.\"    Mrs. Morgan collapsed on to a hall chair.    \"Meredith, miss?\" she said incredulously. \"Why I knew your father----\"    \"I've been married, that's all,\" said Lydia grimly. \"You told me  yesterday that I should be married romantically, but even in the wildest  flights of your imagination, Mrs. Morgan, you could never have supposed  that I should be married in such a violent, desperate way. I'm going to  bed.\" She paused on the landing and looked down at the dumbfounded  woman. \"If anybody calls for me, I am not at home. Oh, yes, you can tell  the _Megaphone_ that I came home very late and that I've gone to bed,  and I'll call to-morrow to explain.\"    \"But, miss,\" stammered the woman, \"your husband----\"    \"My husband is dead,\" said the girl calmly. She felt a brute, but  somehow she could not raise any note of sorrow. \"And if that lawyer man  comes, will you "]]]
