It became evident that  the verses of the Qur'an agreed with existing facts, and that the  Ptolemaic system was imaginary.    In short, many Oriental peoples have been reared for thirteen centuries  under the shadow of the religion of Muhammad. During the Middle Ages,  while Europe was in the lowest depths of barbarism, the Arab peoples were  superior to the other nations of the earth in learning, in the arts,  mathematics, civilization, government and other sciences. The Enlightener  and Educator of these Arab tribes, and the Founder of the civilization and  perfections of humanity among these different races, was an illiterate  Man, Muhammad. Was this illustrious Man a thorough Educator or not? A just  judgment is necessary.          8: THE BAB      As for the Bab--may my soul be His sacrifice!--at a youthful age, that is to  say, when He had reached the twenty-fifth year of His blessed life, He  stood forth to proclaim His Cause.(15) It was universally admitted by the  _Sh_i'is that He had never studied in any school and had not acquired  knowledge from any teacher; all the people of _Sh_iraz bear witness to  this. Nevertheless, He suddenly appeared before the people, endowed with  the most complete erudition. Although He was but a merchant, He confounded  all the 'ulama of Persia.(16) All alone, in a way which is beyond  imagination, He upheld the Cause among the Persians, who are renowned for  their religious fanaticism. This illustrious Soul arose with such power  that He shook the supports of the religion, of the morals, the conditions,  the habits and the customs of Persia, and instituted new rules, new laws  and a new religion. Though the great personages of the State, nearly all  the clergy, and the public men arose to destroy and annihilate Him, He  alone withstood them and moved the whole of Persia.    Many 'ulama and public men, as well as other people, joyfully sacrificed  their lives in His Cause, and hastened to the plain of martyrdom.    The government, the nation, the doctors of divinity and the great  personages desired to extinguish His light, but they could not do so. At  last His moon arose, His star shone forth, His foundations became firmly  established, and His dawning-place became brilliant. He imparted divine  education to an unenlightened multitude and produced marvelous results on  the thoughts, morals, customs and conditions of the Persians. He announced  the glad tidings of the manifestation of the Sun of Baha to His followers  and prepared them to believe.    The appearance of such wonderful signs and great results; the effects  produced upon the minds of the people, and upon the prevailing ideas; the  establishment of the foundations of progress; and the organization of the  principles of success and prosperity by a young merchant, constitute the  greatest proof that He was a perfect Educator. A just person will never  hesitate to believe this.          9: BAHA'U'LLAH      Baha'u'llah(17) appeared at a time when the Persian Empire was immersed in  profound obscurantism and ignorance and lost in the blindest fanaticism.    In the European histories, no doubt, you have read detailed accounts of  the morals, customs and ideas of the Persians during the last centuries.  It is useless to repeat them. Briefly, we will say that Persia had fallen  so low that to all foreign travelers it was a matter of regret that this  country, which in former times had been so glorious and highly civilized,  had now become so decayed, ruined and upset, and that its population had  lost its dignity.    It was at this time that Baha'u'llah appeared. His father was one of the  viziers, not one of the 'ulama. As all the people of Persia know, He had  never studied in any school, nor had He associated with the 'ulama or the  men of learning. The early part of His life was passed in the greatest  happiness. His companions and associates were Persians of the highest  rank, but not learned men.    As soon as the Bab became manifested, Baha'u'llah said, \"This great Man is  the Lord of the righteous, and faith in Him is incumbent upon all.\" And He  arose to assist the Bab and gave many proofs and positive evidences of His  truth, in spite of the fact that the 'ulama of the state religion had  constrained the Persian government to oppose and resist Him and had  further issued decrees ordering the massacre, pillage, persecution and  expulsion of His followers. In all the provinces they began to kill, to  burn, to pillage the converts and even to assault the women and children.  Regardless of this, Baha'u'llah arose to proclaim the word of the Bab with  the greatest firmness and energy. Not for one moment was He in  concealment; He mixed openly with His enemies. He was occupied in showing  forth evidences and proofs and was recognized as the Herald of the Word of  God. In many changes and chances He endured the greatest misfortunes, and  at every moment He ran the risk of being martyred.    He was put into chains and confined in an underground prison. His vast  property and inheritance were pillaged and confiscated. He was exiled four  times from land to land and found rest only in the \"Greatest Prison.\"(18)    In spite of all this He never ceased for one instant His proclamation of  the greatness of the Cause of God. He manifested such virtue, knowledge  and perfections that He became a wonder to all the people of Persia. So  much so that in Tihran, Ba_gh_dad, Constantinople, Rumelia, and even in  Akka, every one of the learned and scientific men who entered His  presence, whether friend or enemy, never failed to receive the most  sufficient and convincing answer to whatever question was propounded. All  frequently acknowledged that He was alone and unique in all perfections.    It often happened that in Ba_gh_dad certain Muhammadan 'ulama, Jewish  rabbis and Christians met together with some European scholars, in a  blessed reunion: each one had some question to propose, and although they  were possessed of varying degrees of culture, they each heard a sufficient  and convincing reply, and retired satisfied. Even the Persian 'ulama who  were at Karbila and Najaf chose a wise man whom they sent on a mission to  Him; his name was Mulla Hasan 'Amu. He came into the Holy Presence, and  proposed a number of questions on behalf of the 'ulama, to which  Baha'u'llah replied. Then Hasan 'Amu said, \"The 'ulama recognize without  hesitation and confess the knowledge and virtue of Baha'u'llah, and they  are unanimously convinced that in all learning he has no peer or equal;  and it is also evident that he has never studied or acquired this  learning; but still the 'ulama say, 'We are not contented with this; we do  not acknowledge the reality of his mission by virtue of his wisdom and  righteousness. Therefore, we ask him to show us a miracle in order to  satisfy and tranquilize our hearts.'\"    Baha'u'llah replied, \"Although you have no right to ask this, for God  should test His creatures, and they should not test God, still I allow and  accept this request. But the Cause of God is not a theatrical display that  is presented every hour, of which some new diversion may be asked for  every day. If it were thus, the Cause of God would become mere child's  play.    \"The 'ulamas must, therefore, assemble, and, with one accord, choose one  miracle, and write that, after the performance of this miracle they will  no longer entertain doubts about Me, and that all will acknowledge and  confess the truth of My Cause. Let them seal this paper, and bring it to  Me. This must be the accepted criterion: if the miracle is performed, no  doubt will remain for them; and if not, We shall be convicted of  imposture.\" The learned man, Hasan 'Amu, rose and replied, \"There is no  more to be said\"; he then kissed the knee of the Blessed One although he  was not a believer, and went. He gathered the 'ulama and gave them the  sacred message. They consulted together and said, \"This man is an  enchanter; perhaps he will perform an enchantment, and then we shall have  nothing more to say.\" Acting on this belief, they did not dare to push the  matter further.(19)    This man, Hasan 'Amu, mentioned this fact at many meetings. After leaving  Karbila he went to Kirman_sh_ah and Tihran and spread a detailed account  of it everywhere, laying emphasis on the fear and the withdrawal of the  'ulama.    Briefly, all His adversaries in the Orient acknowledged His greatness,  grandeur, knowledge and virtue; and though they were His enemies, they  always spoke of Him as \"the renowned Baha'u'llah.\"    At the time when this great Light suddenly arose upon the horizon of  Persia, all the people, the ministers, the 'ulama and men of other classes  rose against Him, pursuing Him with the greatest animosity, and  proclaiming \"that this man wishes to suppress and destroy the religion,  the law, the nation and the empire.\" The same was said of Christ. But  Baha'u'llah alone and without support resisted them all, without ever  showing the least weakness. At last they said, \"As long as this man is in  Persia, there will be no peace and tranquillity; we must banish him, so  that Persia may return to a state of quietude.\"    They proceeded to use violence toward Him to oblige Him to ask for  permission to leave Persia, thinking that by this means the light of His  truth would be extinguished, but the result was quite the contrary. The  Cause became magnified, and its flame more intense. At first it spread  throughout Persia only, but the exile of Baha'u'llah caused the diffusion  of the Cause throughout other countries. Afterward His enemies said,  \"'Iraq-i-'Arab(20) is not far enough from Persia; we must send him to a  more distant kingdom.\" This is why the Persian government determined to  send Baha'u'llah from 'Iraq to Constantinople.

[Exeunt.]         END OF THE FIRST ACT          ACT II          SCENE I.--SIR PETER and LADY TEAZLE    SIR PETER. Lady Teazle--Lady Teazle I'll not bear it.    LADY TEAZLE. Sir Peter--Sir Peter you--may scold or smile, according to  your Humour[,] but I ought to have my own way in everything, and what's  more I will too--what! tho' I was educated in the country I know very  well that women of Fashion in London are accountable to nobody after  they are married.    SIR PETER. Very well! ma'am very well! so a husband is to have no  influence, no authority?    LADY TEAZLE. Authority! no, to be sure--if you wanted authority over me,  you should have adopted me and not married me[:] I am sure you were old  enough.    SIR PETER. Old enough--aye there it is--well--well--Lady Teazle, tho'  my life may be made unhappy by your Temper--I'll not be ruined by your  extravagance--    LADY TEAZLE. My extravagance! I'm sure I'm not more extravagant than a  woman of Fashion ought to be.    SIR PETER. No no Madam, you shall throw away no more sums on such  unmeaning Luxury--'Slife to spend as much to furnish your Dressing Room  with Flowers in winter as would suffice to turn the Pantheon into a  Greenhouse, and give a Fete Champetre at Christmas.    LADY TEAZLE. Lord! Sir Peter am I to blame because Flowers are dear in  cold weather? You should find fault with the Climate, and not with me.  For my Part I'm sure I wish it was spring all the year round--and that  Roses grew under one's Feet!    SIR PETER. Oons! Madam--if you had been born to those Fopperies I  shouldn't wonder at your talking thus;--but you forget what your  situation was when I married you--    LADY TEAZLE. No, no, I don't--'twas a very disagreeable one or I should  never nave married you.    SIR PETER. Yes, yes, madam, you were then in somewhat a humbler  Style--the daughter of a plain country Squire. Recollect Lady Teazle  when I saw you first--sitting at your tambour in a pretty figured linen  gown--with a Bunch of Keys at your side, and your apartment hung round  with Fruits in worsted, of your own working--    LADY TEAZLE. O horrible!--horrible!--don't put me in mind of it!    SIR PETER. Yes, yes Madam and your daily occupation to inspect  the Dairy, superintend the Poultry, make extracts from the Family  Receipt-book, and comb your aunt Deborah's Lap Dog.    LADY TEAZLE. Abominable!    SIR PETER. Yes Madam--and what were your evening amusements? to draw  Patterns for Ruffles, which you hadn't the materials to make--play Pope  Joan with the Curate--to read a sermon to your Aunt--or be stuck down to  an old Spinet to strum your father to sleep after a Fox Chase.    LADY TEAZLE. Scandalous--Sir Peter not a word of it true--    SIR PETER. Yes, Madam--These were the recreations I took you from--and  now--no one more extravagantly in the Fashion--Every Fopery adopted--a  head-dress to o'er top Lady Pagoda with feathers pendant horizontal and  perpendicular--you forget[,] Lady Teazle--when a little wired gauze with  a few Beads made you a fly Cap not much bigger than a blew-bottle, and  your Hair was comb'd smooth over a Roll--    LADY TEAZLE. Shocking! horrible Roll!!    SIR PETER. But now--you must have your coach--Vis-a-vis, and three  powder'd Footmen before your Chair--and in the summer a pair of white  cobs to draw you to Kensington Gardens--no recollection when y ou were  content to ride double, behind the Butler, on a docked Coach-Horse?    LADY TEAZLE. Horrid!--I swear I never did.    SIR PETER. This, madam, was your situation--and what have I not done  for you? I have made you woman of Fashion of Fortune of Rank--in short I  have made you my wife.    LADY TEAZLE. Well then and there is but one thing more you can make me  to add to the obligation.    SIR PETER. What's that pray?    LADY TEAZLE. Your widow.--    SIR PETER. Thank you Madam--but don't flatter yourself for though your  ill-conduct may disturb my Peace it shall never break my Heart I promise  you--however I am equally obliged to you for the Hint.    LADY TEAZLE. Then why will you endeavour to make yourself so  disagreeable to me--and thwart me in every little elegant expense.    SIR PETER. 'Slife--Madam I pray, had you any of these elegant expenses  when you married me?    LADY TEAZLE. Lud Sir Peter would you have me be out of the Fashion?    SIR PETER. The Fashion indeed!--what had you to do with the Fashion  before you married me?    LADY TEAZLE. For my Part--I should think you would like to have your  wife thought a woman of Taste--    SIR PETER. Aye there again--Taste! Zounds Madam you had no Taste when  you married me--    LADY TEAZLE. That's very true indeed Sir Peter! after having married you  I should never pretend to Taste again I allow.    SIR PETER. So--so then--Madam--if these are your Sentiments pray how  came I to be honour'd with your Hand?    LADY TEAZLE. Shall I tell you the Truth?    SIR PETER. If it's not too great a Favour.    LADY TEAZLE. Why the Fact is I was tired of all those agreeable  Recreations which you have so good naturally [naturedly] Described--and  having a Spirit to spend and enjoy a Fortune--I determined to marry the  first rich man that would have me.    SIR PETER. A very honest confession--truly--but pray madam was there no  one else you might have tried to ensnare but me.    LADY TEAZLE. O lud--I drew my net at several but you were the only one I  could catch.    SIR PETER. This is plain dealing indeed--    LADY TEAZLE. But now Sir Peter if we have finish'd our daily Jangle I  presume I may go to my engagement at Lady Sneerwell's?    SIR PETER. Aye--there's another Precious circumstance--a charming set of  acquaintance--you have made there!    LADY TEAZLE. Nay Sir Peter they are People of Rank and Fortune--and  remarkably tenacious of reputation.    SIR PETER. Yes egad they are tenacious of Reputation with a vengeance,  for they don't chuse anybody should have a Character but themselves!  Such a crew! Ah! many a wretch has rid on hurdles who has done less  mischief than these utterers of forged Tales, coiners of Scandal, and  clippers of Reputation.    LADY TEAZLE. What would you restrain the freedom of speech?    SIR PETER. Aye they have made you just as bad [as] any one of the  Society.    LADY TEAZLE. Why--I believe I do bear a Part with a tolerable Grace--But  I vow I bear no malice against the People I abuse, when I say an  ill-natured thing, 'tis out of pure Good Humour--and I take it for  granted they deal exactly in the same manner with me, but Sir Peter you  know you promised to come to Lady Sneerwell's too.    SIR PETER. Well well I'll call in, just to look after my own character.    LADY TEAZLE. Then, indeed, you must make Haste after me, or you'll be  too late--so good bye to ye.    SIR PETER. So--I have gain'd much by my intended expostulation--yet  with what a charming air she contradicts every thing I say--and how  pleasingly she shows her contempt of my authority--Well tho' I can't  make her love me, there is certainly a great satisfaction in quarrelling  with her; and I think she never appears to such advantage as when she is  doing everything in her Power to plague me.

SURFACE. Yes--yes the Epigram by all means.    SiR BENJAMIN. O plague on't unkle--'tis mere nonsense--    CRABTREE. No no; 'fore gad very clever for an extempore!    SIR BENJAMIN. But ladies you should be acquainted with the  circumstances. You must know that one day last week as Lady Betty  Curricle was taking the Dust in High Park, in a sort of duodecimo  Phaeton--she desired me to write some verses on her Ponies--upon which I  took out my Pocket-Book--and in one moment produced--the following:--       'Sure never were seen two such beautiful Ponies;     Other Horses are Clowns--and these macaronies,     Nay to give 'em this Title, I'm sure isn't wrong,     Their Legs are so slim--and their Tails are so long.    CRABTREE. There Ladies--done in the smack of a whip and on Horseback  too.    SURFACE. A very Phoebus, mounted--indeed Sir Benjamin.    SIR BENJAMIN. Oh dear Sir--Trifles--Trifles.         Enter LADY TEAZLE and MARIA    MRS. CANDOUR. I must have a Copy--    LADY SNEERWELL. Lady Teazle--I hope we shall see Sir Peter?    LADY TEAZLE. I believe He'll wait on your Ladyship presently.    LADY SNEERWELL. Maria my love you look grave. Come, you sit down to  Piquet with Mr. Surface.    MARIA. I take very little Pleasure in cards--however, I'll do as you  Please.    LADY TEAZLE. I am surprised Mr. Surface should sit down her--I thought  He would have embraced this opportunity of speaking to me before Sir  Peter came--[Aside.]    MRS. CANDOUR. Now, I'll die but you are so scandalous I'll forswear your  society.    LADY TEAZLE. What's the matter, Mrs. Candour?    MRS. CANDOUR. They'll not allow our friend Miss Vermillion to be  handsome.    LADY SNEERWELL. Oh, surely she is a pretty woman. . . .    [CRABTREE.] I am very glad you think so ma'am.    MRS. CANDOUR. She has a charming fresh Colour.    CRABTREE. Yes when it is fresh put on--    LADY TEAZLE. O fie! I'll swear her colour is natural--I have seen it  come and go--    CRABTREE. I dare swear you have, ma'am: it goes of a Night, and comes  again in the morning.    SIR BENJAMIN. True, uncle, it not only comes and goes but what's more  egad her maid can fetch and carry it--    MRS. CANDOUR. Ha! ha! ha! how I hate to hear you talk so! But surely,  now, her Sister, is or was very handsome.    CRABTREE. Who? Mrs. Stucco? O lud! she's six-and-fifty if she's an hour!    MRS. CANDOUR.
