Moreover  Ivar Bardsen's account[11-2] of Greenland, which is entirely trustworthy,  gives a distinct impression that the colonists did not come into conflict  with the Eskimos until the fourteenth century.    There is consequently no valid reason for doubting that the savages  described in the sagas were natives of Vinland and Markland. But whether  it can ever be satisfactorily demonstrated that the Norse explorers came  in contact with Algonquin, Micmac, or Beothuk Indians, and just where  they landed, are not matters of essential importance. The  incontrovertible facts of the various Norse expeditions are that Leif  Ericson and Thorfinn Karlsefni are as surely historical characters as  Christopher Columbus, that they visited, in the early part of the  eleventh century, some part of North America where the grape grew, and  that in that region the colonists found savages, whose hostility upset  their plans of permanent settlement.    According to the usually accepted chronology, Leif's voyage from Norway  to Greenland (during which voyage he found Vinland) was made in the year  1000, and Karlsefni's attempt at colonization within the decade  following. On the basis of genealogical records (so often treacherous)  some doubt has recently been cast on this chronology by Vigfusson, in  _Origines Islandicae_[12-1] (1905). Vigfusson died in 1889, sixteen years  before the publication of this work. He had no opportunity to consider  the investigations of Dr. Storm, who accepts without question the first  decade of the eleventh century for the Vinland voyages. Nor do Storm's  evidences and arguments on this point appear in the work as published.  Therefore we are obliged to say of Vigfusson's observations on the  chronology of the Vinland voyages, that they stand as question-marks  which call for confirmation.    We are surprised, moreover, to find that _Origines Islandicae_ prints the  Flat Island Book story first, apparently on account of the belief that  this story contains the \"truer account of the first sighting of the  American continent\" by Biarni Herjulfson.[12-2] It is impossible to  believe that this would have been done, if the editors (Vigfusson and  Powell) had known the results of Dr. Storm's work, which is not  mentioned. There is, furthermore, no attempt in the _Origines Islandicae_  to refute or explain away an opinion on AM. 557 expressed by the same  authorities, in 1879,[12-3] to the effect that \"it is free from grave  errors of fact which disfigure the latter [the Flat Island Book saga].\"  We are almost forced to the conclusion that a hand less cunning than  Vigfusson's has had to do with the unfinished section of the work.    In regard to the extract from Adam of Bremen, which we print, it should  be observed that its only importance lies in the fact that it  corroborates the Icelandic tradition of a land called Vinland, where  there were grapes and \"unsown grain,\" and thus serves to strengthen faith  in the trustworthiness of the saga narrative. The annals and papal  letters that follow need no further discussion, we think, than that  contained in the annotations.    Besides the texts in Icelandic, already described, by Rafn, Reeves,  Vigfusson and Powell, and Storm, it may be mentioned that the Flat Island  text is given in Vol. I. of _Flateyjar-bok_, ed. Vigfusson and Unger,  Christiania, 1860. There are translations of both texts in Beamish,  _Discovery of North America by the Northmen_ (London, 1841), in Slafter,  _Voyages of the Northmen_ (Boston, 1877), and in De Costa, _Pre-Columbian  Discovery of America by the Northmen_ (Albany, 1901). But most of these  are confused in arrangement, and the best is that by the late Mr. Reeves,  which by the kind consent of his representatives we are permitted to use  in this volume.    JULIUS E.

[7-1] Snorri, the Icelandic historian, says that \"it was more than 240  years from the settlement of Iceland (about 870) before sagas began to be  written\" and that \"Ari (1067-1148) was the first man who wrote in the  vernacular stories of things old and new.\"    [7-2] \"Among the mediaeval literatures of Europe, that of Iceland is  unrivalled in the profusion of detail with which the facts of ordinary  life are recorded, and the clearness with which the individual character  of numberless real persons stands out from the historic background....  The Icelanders of the Saga-age were not a secluded self-centred race;  they were untiring in their desire to learn all that could be known of  the lands round about them, and it is to their zeal for this knowledge,  their sound historical sense, and their trained memories, that we owe  much information regarding the British Isles themselves from the ninth to  the thirteenth century. The contact of the Scandinavian peoples with the  English race on the one hand, and the Gaelic on the other, has been an  important factor in the subsequent history of Britain; and this is  naturally a subject on which the Icelandic evidence is of the highest  value.\" Prefatory Note to _Origines Islandicae_.

[8-3] The Kristni-Saga, which tells of the conversion of Iceland, says:  \"That summer [1000] King Olaf [of Norway] went out of the country to  Wendland in the south, and he sent Leif Eric's son to Greenland to preach  the faith there. It was then that Leif discovered Vinland the Good. He  also discovered a crew on the wreck of a ship out in the deep sea, and so  he got the name of Leif the Lucky.\" For passages from other sagas that  corroborate Leif's discovery on his voyage from Norway to Greenland  (_i.e._, in the year that Olaf Tryggvason fell, namely, 1000), see  Reeves, _The Finding of Wineland the Good_ (London, 1895), pp. 7-18.

[12-2] In other respects the editors speak highly of the saga as found in  Hauk's Book and AM. 557: \"This saga has never been so well known as the  other, though it is probably of even higher value. Unlike the other, it  has the form and style of one of the 'Islendinga Sogor' [the Icelandic  sagas proper]; its phrasing is broken, its dialogue is excellent, it  contains situations of great pathos, such as the beautiful incident at  the end of Bearne's self-sacrifice, and scenes of high interest, such as  that of the Sibyl's prophesying in Greenland....\" II. 591.

THE SAGA OF ERIC THE RED    ALSO CALLED THE SAGA OF THORFINN KARLSEFNI[14-1]      _The Saga of Eric the Red, also called the Saga of Thorfinn Karlsefni and  Snorri Thorbrandsson._[14-2]--Olaf was the name of a warrior-king, who  was called Olaf the White. He was the son of King Ingiald, Helgi's son,  the son of Olaf, Gudraud's son, son of Halfdan Whiteleg, king of the  Uplands-men.[14-3] Olaf engaged in a Western freebooting expedition and  captured Dublin in Ireland and the Shire of Dublin, over which he became  king.[14-4] He married Aud the Wealthy, daughter of Ketil Flatnose, son  of Biorn Buna, a famous man of Norway. Their son was called Thorstein the  Red. Olaf was killed in battle in Ireland, and Aud and Thorstein went  then to the Hebrides; there Thorstein married Thurid, daughter of Eyvind  Easterling, sister of Helgi the Lean; they had many children. Thorstein  became a warrior-king, and entered into fellowship with Earl Sigurd the  Mighty, son of Eystein the Rattler. They conquered Caithness and  Sutherland, Ross and Moray, and more than the half of Scotland. Over  these Thorstein became king, ere he was betrayed by the Scots, and was  slain there in battle. Aud was at Caithness when she heard of Thorstein's  death; she thereupon caused a ship to be secretly built in the forest,  and when she was ready, she sailed out to the Orkneys. There she bestowed  Groa, Thorstein the Red's daughter, in marriage; she was the mother of  Grelad, whom Earl Thorfinn, Skull-cleaver, married. After this Aud set  out to seek Iceland, and had on board her ship twenty freemen. Aud  arrived in Iceland, and passed the first winter at Biarnarhoefn with her  brother, Biorn. And afterwards took possession of all the Dale country  between Doegurdar river and Skraumuhlaups river. She lived at Hvamm, and  held her orisons at Krossholar, where she caused crosses to be erected,  for she had been baptized and was a devout believer. With her there came  out [to Iceland] many distinguished men, who had been captured in the  Western freebooting expedition, and were called slaves. Vifil was the  name of one of these: he was a highborn man, who had been taken captive  in the Western sea, and was called a slave, before Aud freed him; now  when Aud gave homesteads to the members of her crew, Vifil asked  wherefore she gave him no homestead as to the other men. Aud replied,  that this should make no"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18581"],[0,"Adrift in New York: Tom and Florence Braving the World (#5)"],[1,"nden, going to the  secretary, and examining it. He did not, however, miss the will, but  only the roll of bills. \"Give me back the money you have taken from  me, you young rascal!\"    \"I took nothing, sir.\"    \"It's a lie! The money is gone, and no one else could have taken it.\"    \"I don't allow no one to call me a liar. Just take that back, old man,  or I----\"    \"Indeed, uncle, he took nothing, for he had only just opened the  secretary when I woke up and spoke to him.\"    \"You stand by him, of course, shameless girl! I blush to think that  you are my niece. I am glad to think that my eyes are opened before it  is too late.\"    The old merchant rang the bell violently, and aroused the house.  Dodger made no attempt to escape, but stood beside Florence in the  attitude of a protector. But a short time elapsed before Curtis Waring  and the servants entered the room, and gazed with wonder at the  _tableau_ presented by the excited old man and the two young people.    \"My friends,\" said John Linden, in a tone of excitement, \"I call you  to witness that this girl, whom I blush to acknowledge as my niece,  has proved herself unworthy of my kindness. In your presence I cut her  off, and bid her never again darken my door.\"    \"But what has she done, uncle?\" asked Curtis. He was prepared for the  presence of Dodger, whom he rightly concluded to be the agent of Tim  Bolton, but he could not understand why Florence should be in the  library at this late hour. Nor was he able to understand the evidently  friendly relations between her and the young visitor.    \"What has she done?\" repeated John Linden. \"She has introduced that  young ruffian into the house to rob me. Look at that secretary! He has  forced it open, and stolen a large sum of money.\"    \"It is not true, sir,\" said Dodger, calmly, \"about taking the money, I  mean. I haven't taken a cent.\"    \"Then why did you open the secretary?\"    \"I did mean to take money, but she stopped me.\"    \"Oh, she stopped you?\" repeated Linden, with withering sarcasm. \"Then,  perhaps, you will tell me where the money is gone?\"    \"He hasn't discovered about the will,\" thought Curtis, congratulating  himself; \"if the boy has it, I must manage to give him a chance to  escape.\"    \"You can search me if you want to,\" continued Dodger, proudly. \"You  won't find no money on me.\"    \"Do you think I am a fool, you young burglar?\" exclaimed John Linden,  angrily.    \"Uncle, let me speak to the boy,\" said Curtis, soothingly. \"I think he  will tell me.\"    \"As you like, Curtis; but I am convinced that he is a thief.\"    Curtis Waring beckoned Dodger into an adjoining room.    \"Now, my boy,\" he said, smoothly, \"give me what you took from the  secretary, and I will see that you are not arrested.\"    \"But, sir, I didn't take nothing--it's just as I told the old duffer.  The girl waked up just as I'd got the secretary open, and I didn't  have a chance.\"    \"But the money is gone,\" said Curtis, in an incredulous tone.    \"I don't know nothing about that.\"    \"Come, you'd better examine your pockets. In the hurry of the moment  you may have taken it without knowing it.\"    \"No, I couldn't.\"    \"Didn't you take a paper of any kind?\" asked Curtis, eagerly.  \"Sometimes papers are of more value than money.\"    \"No, I didn't take no paper, though Tim told me to.\"    Curtis quietly ignored the allusion to Tim, for it did not suit his  purpose to get Tim into trouble. His unscrupulous agent knew too much  that would compromise his principal.    \"Are you willing that I should examine you?\"    \"Yes, I am. Go ahead.\"    Curtis thrust his hand into the pockets of the boy, who, boy as he  was, was as tall as himself, but was not repaid by the discovery of  anything. He was very much perplexed.    \"Didn't you throw the articles on the floor?\" he demanded,  suspiciously.    \"No, I didn't.\"    \"You didn't give them to the young lady?\"    \"No; if I had she'd have said so.\"    \"Humph! this is strange. What is your name?\"    \"Dodger.\"    \"That's a queer name; have you no other?\"    \"Not as I know of.\"    \"With whom do you live?\"    \"With my father. Leastways, he says he's my father.\"    There was a growing suspicion in the mind of Curtis Waring. He scanned  the boy's features with attention. Could this ill-dressed boy--a  street boy in appearance--be his long-lost and deeply wronged cousin?    \"Who is it that says he is your father?\" he demanded, abruptly.    \"Do you want to get him into trouble?\"    \"No, I don't want to get him into trouble, or you either. Better tell  me all, and I will be your friend.\"    \"You're a better sort than I thought at first,\" said Dodger. \"The man  I live with is called Tim Bolton.\"    \"I though so,\" quickly ejaculated Curtis. He had scarcely got out the  words before he was sensible that he had made a mistake.    \"What! do you know Tim?\" inquired Dodger, in surprise.    \"I mean,\" replied Curtis, lamely, \"that I have heard of this man  Bolton. He keeps a saloon on the Bowery, doesn't he?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"I thought you would be living with some such man. Did he come to the  house with you tonight?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Where is he?\"    \"He stayed outside.\"    \"Perhaps he is there now.\"    \"Don't you go to having him arrested,\" said Dodger, suspiciously.    \"I will keep my promise. Are you sure you didn't pass out the paper  and the money to him? Think now.\"    \"No, I didn't. I didn't have a chance. When I came into the room  yonder I saw the gal asleep, and I thought she wouldn't hear me, but  when I got the desk open she spoke to me, and asked me what I was  doin'.\"    \"And you took nothing?\"    \"No.\"    \"It seems very strange. I cannot understand it. Yet my uncle says the  money is gone. Did anyone else enter the room while you were talking  with Miss Linden?\"    \"I didn't see any one.\"    \"What were you talking about?\"    \"She said the old man wanted her to marry you, and she didn't want  to.\"    \"She told you that?\" exclaimed Curtis, in displeasure.    \"Yes, she did. She said she'd rather marry the dude that was here  early this evenin'.\"    \"Mr. de Brabazon!\"    \"Yes, that's the name.\"    \"Upon my word, she was very confidential. You are a queer person for  her to select as a confidant.\"    \"Maybe so, sir; but she knows I'm her friend.\"    \"You like the young lady, then? Perhaps you would like to marry her  yourself?\"    \"As if she'd take any notice of a poor boy like me. I told her if her  uncle sent her away, I'd take care of her and be a brother to her.\"    \"How would Mr. Tim Bolton--that's his name, isn't it?--like that?\"    \"I wouldn't take her to where he lives.\"    \"I think, myself, it would hardly be a suitable home for a young lady  brought up on Madison Avenue. There is certainly no accounting for  tastes. Miss Florence----\"    \"That's her name, is it?\"    \"Yes; didn't she tell you?\"    \"No; but it's a nice name.\"    \"She declines my hand, and accepts your protection. It will certainly  be a proud distinction to become Mrs. Dodger.\"    \"Don't laugh at her!\" said Dodger, suspiciously.    \"I don't propose to. But I think we may as well return to the  library.\"    \"Well,\" said Mr. Linden, as his nephew returned with Dodger.    \"I have examined the boy, and found nothing on his person,\" said  Curtis; \"I confess I am puzzled. He appears to have a high admiration  for Florence----\"    \"As I supposed.\"    \"She has even confided to him her dislike for me, and he has offered  her his protection.\"    \"Is this so, miss?\" demanded Mr. Linden, sternly.    \"Yes, uncle,\" faltered Florence.    \"Then you can join the young person you have selected whenever you  please. For your sake I will not have him arrested for attempted  burglary. He is welcome to what he has taken, since he is likely to  marry into the family. You may stay here to-night, and he can call for  you in the morning.\"    John Linden closed the secretary, and left the room, leaving Florence  sobbing. The servants, too, retired, and Curtis was left alone with  her.    \"Florence,\" he said, \"accept my hand, and I will reconcile my uncle to  you. Say but the word, and----\"    \"I can never speak it, Curtis! I will take my uncle at his word.  Dodger, call for me to-morrow at eight, and I will accept your  friendly services in finding me a new home.\"    \"I'll be on hand, miss. Good-night!\"    \"Be it so, obstinate girl!\" said Curtis, angrily. \"The time will come  when you will bitterly repent your mad decision.\"          Chapter VII.  Florence Leaves Home.      Florence passed a sleepless night. It had come upon her so suddenly,  this expulsion from the home of her childhood, that she could not  fully realize it. She could not feel that she was taking her last look  at the familiar room, and well-remembered dining-room, where she had  sat down for the last time for breakfast. She was alone at the  breakfast table, for the usual hour was half-past eight, and she had  appointed Dodger to call for her at eight.    \"Is it true, Miss Florence, that you're going away?\" asked Jane, the  warm-hearted table girl, as she waited upon Florence.    \"Yes, Jane,\" answered Florence, sadly.    \"It's a shame, so it is! I didn't think your uncle would be so  hard-hearted.\"    \"He is disappointed because I won't marry my Cousin Curtis.\"    \"I don't blame you for it, miss. I never liked Mr. Waring. He isn't  half good enough for you.\"    \"I say nothing about that, Jane; but I will not marry a man I do not  love.\"    \"Nor would I, miss. Where are you going, if I may make so bold?\"    \"I don't know, Jane,\" said Florence, despondently.    \"But you can't walk about the streets.\"    \"A trusty friend is going to call for me at eight o'clock; when he  comes admit him.\"    \"It is a--a young gentleman?\"    \"You wouldn't call him such. He is a boy, a poor boy; but I think he  is a true friend. He says he will find me a comfortable room  somewhere, where I can settle down and look for work.\"    \"Are you going to work for a living, Miss Florence?\" asked Jane,"]]]
