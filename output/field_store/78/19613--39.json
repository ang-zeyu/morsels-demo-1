Fourthly, the later conception, of Jahveh as a  destroying fire, and the way in which the God of Israel is conceived in  connection with fire, and as manifesting himself in fire,[24] betray,  even in the midst of a more advanced religious development, an original  relationship with the like conceptions of the other Semites. Fifthly,  even in the orthodox Jahveh-worship, some symbols, as the twelve oxen in  the porch of the temple,[25] the horns of the altar for  burnt-offerings,[26] perhaps also the in part oxlike form of the  cherubim,[27] point to an earlier worship of the deity under the form of  an ox, the symbol of the highest might, especially among the Semitic  races.[28]    In confirmation of the supposition thus suggested of a community of  origin in the religion of the Israelites and in that of the nations  related to them, there is also to be remarked, firstly, the sympathy  always felt among the people of Israel for the worship of Baal and  Molech, in face of the strongest opposition on the part of the  prophets;[29] secondly, the statement of Amos,[30] that even in the  wilderness the Israelites worshiped Molech; thirdly, the fact that in  the time of the Judges, Jephthah offered his daughter to Jahveh,[31] and  still later the feeling, not driven out even by Mosaism, that the wrath  of Jahveh must be appeased by human blood,[32] a necessity which David  recognizes;[33] fourthly, the ancient custom in Israel, as in the  nations related to them, of worshiping the deity on mountains and  heights,[34] against which the priestly legislation strove in the  interest of the pure worship of Jahveh;[35] fifthly, the heterodox  worship of Jahveh in the kingdom of the ten tribes under the form of a  calf.[36]    From all this it seems fair to conclude that the religion of the oldest  forefathers of Israel had its root originally in one and the same soil  with the religion of the other Semites. Out of an earlier  nature-religion there developed among the Semites the conception of  Baal, the lord of nature, and of Molech with his inhuman worship. While,  however, the other Semites remained in this lower stage, or rather sank  back more and more into the immorality of the nature-religion,--an  hypothesis suggested by a comparison of the religious state of the  nations of Canaan in Abraham's time with their state at the time of the  conquest of the land by Joshua and afterwards,--in the family of  Abraham, religious consciousness rose to the recognition of a deity,  who, although he had a right to human sacrifices, yet did not claim such  sacrifices, but was satisfied with men's willingness to bring them to  him. With this higher development of religion, the names of the Supreme  Being, Baal and Molech, originally common to the whole race, came more  and more into contempt, and were regarded as the expression of  abominable idolatry,[37] while even the worship of Jahveh under the form  of a calf, originally permitted, was later branded by the prophets as  heresy.    Though it was in the family of Abraham that even in Mesopotamia[38] the  beginning of this higher development of the Semitic religion showed  itself, which, after his migration to Canaan became the heritage of his  family, yet the patriarch of Israel did not stand alone in this respect  among the Semites. The old Canaanitish chieftains also of the  patriarchal period, Melchizedek and Abimelech, worship the same God as  he,[39] while on the other hand in his own family not all traces of  polytheistic superstition have disappeared,[40] and these traces are  also visible still later in Israel.[41]    The patriarchal religion, which afterwards with the great majority fell  into oblivion, was recalled afresh to men's minds by Moses, and the God  of the fathers was preached by him under the name before unknown of  Jahveh,[42] to whom, with the exclusion of all other gods, religious  worship is due.[43] The Jahveh of Moses, like the El Eljon of the  patriarchs, is the one only object of worship (Deus Unus), yet without  excluding the possibility of other gods existing.[44] Not until later  did the more developed conception of Jahveh arise as the one only God  (Deus unicus),[45] who is throned in heaven, and like the Elohim of the  patriarchs, encircled by celestial beings (Bene Elohim, Malakim,  Angels), who execute his commands, yet are not objects of religious  adoration.    The religious standpoint of Moses is the legal. Jehovah stands related  to his people as the Holy, as lawgiver and judge; and the true moral  consecration to God is symbolically expressed in the ritual, especially  in the sacrifice, while the relation of the people to God is based upon  the mediation of the priests. Along with this, and out of Mosaism, after  the time of Samuel, prophetism was developed, in which independent  religious conviction, outside the limits of the priesthood, and without  distinction of rank or birth,[46] awoke among the people. Prophetism, in  the domain of religion, is the development of the religious spirit to  individual independence and freedom. The prophet, rising above the legal  standpoint and outward ceremonial, puts the essence of true worship in  morality,[47] but recognizes also along with the deepest feeling of  dependence upon God, in the independence[48] and spontaneity of the  religious and moral life, the irresistible power of the divine spirit,  by which the Most High, though apart from the world and throned in  heaven, puts himself into the closest and most intimate communion with  the true worshiper. Thus the gulf which divided Jahveh, as a God afar  off, from the world and his worshipers, closed up more and more. With  the conviction of the pureness and truth[49] of her religion, Israel  felt the calling to raise it to the religion of the world, and in the  realization of this she saw the ideal of the future.[50]      _b. The Israelitish religion after the Captivity._    The free character which distinguished prophetism in the religion of  Israel changed, after the return of the people from captivity,  especially with the party of the Pharisees, to literalness and  formalism. The prophets gave place to the synagogue, the living  proclamation of the truth to scriptural erudition, the spirit of  freedom to slavish subjection to Scripture and tradition. As the ancient  productions of the Indian literature, originally the expression of the  popular thought of India, were elevated by the Brahmins into Veda, holy,  inspired scripture, so also the religious literature of Israel took on  the character of a closed Canon, so that what was once the expression of  religious life became now rule of faith. The standpoint of the law which  prophetism had already overcome was again strongly maintained, the law  enriched with a number of new ordinances, and the essence of religion  made to consist partly in dogmatic speculation, partly in a merely  outward service, devoid of inner life. The Messianic prediction, or the  expectation that the kingdom, divided in Rehoboam's reign, once more  united under a prince of the house of David, should be exalted to new  bloom and lustre,--which in the older prophets was the natural and  historically explicable form in which the ideal of Israel's future  presented itself to the seer, but which, under the influence of the  changed political conditions, had already been replaced in the later  prophecy by the more general conception of a future triumph of the true  religion of which Israel was the bringer,--[51]returned, yet not as the  ideal of the prophetic spirit, but as a dogma, the product of scriptural  interpretation. The pure monotheism, by which formerly a place in the  Providence of God had been allotted to everything, even to moral  evil,[52] became corrupted, under the influence of Parsism, by the  conception of two kingdoms, of God and of the Devil. The angels,  originally the messengers of Providence, became under mythological  names, Gabriel, Raphael, Michael, &c., so many middle beings who filled  the space between the Deity, existing apart from the world, and the  world. The lower world (sheol, [Greek: aides]), formerly the general  abode of the dead, of bad and good without distinction, was split into  two parts, paradise and gehenna, and became a place of recompense, and,  along with this, religion, once an end, became the means of warding off  a dreaded punishment, or of gaining a future of bliss. The doctrine of  immortality, as the continuation of man's moral development, which was  formerly unknown in Israel, appeared, as in the later Parsism, in the  form of a bodily resurrection of the dead, at first of the righteous  only, but afterwards in the form of a general resurrection, by mediation  of the Messiah, at whose appearing, which was expected just before the  end of the present state of things, the great judgment of the world, of  living and dead, was to be held, heaven and earth renewed, and the  kingdom of God founded. Beside the learned party of the Pharisees stood  the Sadducees, who subordinated religion to politics, rejected the  Messianic idea and the authority of tradition, and, in denying  immortality in the form of a bodily resurrection, failed to perceive the  truth of immortality, for whose recognition the premises and germs  existed in the religion of Israel, though not as yet developed. The  third party, that of the Essenes, was marked by quiet piety, and in many  respects also by excessive asceticism. In the midst of the Pharisaic  formalism, the unbelief of the Sadducees, and the pietism of the  Essenes, there was yet in Israel a seed of true worshipers, who, though  not above the dogmatic prejudices of their time, had heart and mind open  for the true religion, and who set the true blessing to be looked for  from the Messiah in the satisfying of their religious and moral needs.      3. THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION.    The Israelitish religion, which reached its"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20153"],[0,"The American Journal of Archaeology, 1893-1 (#5)"],[1," which stood upon the higher level           to the south. If Pausanias had wished to pass from the           Erechtheion to the temple of Athena standing(?) beside it, the           opening words of c. 26.6 ([Greek: Iera men tes Athenas estin e           te alle polis kte.]) would have formed the best possible           transition; but those words introduce the mention of the           ancient [Greek: agalma] which was in the Erechtheion. That           Pausanias then, without any warning, jumps into another temple           of Athena, is something of which even his detractors would           hardly accuse him, and I hope I have shown that he is innocent           of that offence.             [Footnote 14: Frg. 146, JAHN-MICH., _Paus. Discr. Arcis. Ath._,           c. 27.2.8.]             Pausanias, then, does not mention the temple under discussion.             Xenophon (_Hell._ I. 6) says that, in the year 406 B.C. [Greek:           o palaios naos tes Athenas enepresthe]. Until recently this  page 7   statement was supposed to apply to the Erechtheion, called           \"ancient temple\" because it took the place of the original           temple of Athena, from which the great temple (the Parthenon)           was to be distinguished. Of course, the new _building_ of the           Erechtheion was not properly entitled to the epithet \"ancient,\"           but as a _temple_ it could be called ancient, being regarded as           the original temple in renewed form. If, however, the newly           discovered temple was in existence alongside the Erechtheion in           406, the expression [Greek: palaios naos] applied to the           Erechtheion would be confusing, for the other temple was a much           older _building_ than the Erechtheion. If the temple discovered           in 1886 existed in 406 B.C., it would be natural to suppose that           it was referred to by Xenophon as [Greek: o palaios naos]. But           this passage is not enough to prove that the temple existed in           406 B.C.             Demosthenes (xxiv, 136) speaks of a fire in the opisthodomos.           This is taken by Dörpfeld (_Mitth_., xii, p. 44) as a reference           to the opisthodomos of the temple under discussion, and this           fire is identified with the fire mentioned by Xenophon. But           hitherto the opisthodomos in question has been supposed to be           the rear part of the Parthenon, and there is no direct proof           that Demosthenes and Xenophon refer to the same fire. If the           temple discovered in 1886 existed in 406 B.C., it is highly           probable that the passages mentioned refer to it, but the           passages do not prove that it existed.             It remains for us to sift the evidence for the existence of the           temple from the Persian War to 406 B.C. This has been collected           by Dörpfeld[15] and Lolling,[16] who agree in thinking that the           temple continued in existence throughout the fifth and fourth           centuries, however much their views differ in other respects.           But it seems to me that even thus much is not proved. I believe           that, after the departure of the Persians, the Athenians           partially restored the temple as soon as possible, because I do           not see how they could have got along without it, inasmuch as           it was used as the public treasury; but my belief, being           founded upon little or no positive evidence, does not claim the           force of proof.             [Footnote 15: _Mitth._, XII, p. 25, ff.; 190 ff.; XV, p. 420,           ff.]             [Footnote 16: [Gree: Ecatompedon] in the periodical [Greek:           Athena] 1890, p. 628, ff. The inscription there published           appears also in the [Greek: Deltion Archaiologicon], 1890, p.           12, and its most important part is copied, with some           corrections, by Dörpfeld, XV, p. 421.]    Page 8   Dörpfeld (XV, p. 424) says that the Persians left the walls of           the temple and the outer portico standing; that this is evident           from the present condition of the architraves, triglyphs and           cornices, which are built into the Acropolis wall. These           architectural members were ... taken from the building while it           still stood, and built into the northern wall of the           citadel. But, if the Athenians had wished to restore the temple           as quickly as possible, they would have left these members           where they were. It seems, at least, rather extravagant to take           them carefully away and then restore the temple without a           peristyle, for the restored building would probably need at           least cornices if not triglyphs or architraves; then why not           repair the old ones? It appears by no means impossible that, as           Lolling (p. 655) suggests, only a part of the temple was           restored.[17] Still more natural is the assumption, that the           Athenians carried off the whole temple while they were about           it. I do not, however, dare to proceed to this assumption,           because I do not know where the Athenians would have kept their           public monies if the entire building had been removed. Perhaps           part of the peristyle was so badly injured by the Persians that           it could not be repaired. At any rate, the Athenians intended           (as Dörpfeld, XII, p. 202, also believes) to remove the whole           building so soon as the great new temple should be completed. I           think they carried out their intention.             [Footnote 17: LOLLING does not say how much of the temple was           restored; but, as he assumes the continuation of a worship           connected with the building, he would seem to imply that at           least part (and in that case, doubtless, the whole) of the           cella was restored, and he also maintains the continued           existence of the opisthodomos and the two small chambers. E.           CURTIUS, _Stadtgeschichte von Athen_, p. 132, believes that           only the western half of the temple was restored. DÖRPFELD, p.           425, suggests the possibility that the entire building, even           the peristyle, was restored, and that the peristyle remained           until the erection of the Erechtheion.]             This brings us to the discussion of the names and uses of the           various parts of the older temple and of the new one (the           Parthenon), the evidence for the continued existence of the           older temple being based upon the occurrence of these names in           inscriptions and elsewhere. As these matters have been fully           discussed by Dörpfeld and Lolling, I shall accept as facts           without further discussion all points which seem to me to have           been definitively settled by them.    Page 9   Lolling, in the article referred to above, publishes an           inscription put together by him from forty-one fragments. It           belongs to the last quarter of the sixth century B.C., and           relates to the pre-Persian temple. Part of the inscription is           too fragmentary to admit of interpretation, but the meaning of           the greater part (republished by Dörpfeld) is clear at least in           a general way. The [Greek: tamiai] are to make a list of           certain objects on the Acropolis with certain exceptions. The           servants of the temple, priests, _etc_., are to follow certain           rules or be punished by fines. The [Greek: tamiai] are to open           in person the doors of the chambers in the temple. These rules           would not concern us except for the fact that the various parts           of the building are mentioned. The whole building is called           [Greek: to Ecatompedon]; parts of it are the [Greek: proneion],           the [Greek: neôs], the [Greek: oikema tamieion] and [Greek: ta           oikemata]. There can be no doubt that these are respectively           the eastern porch, the main cella, the large western room and           the two smaller chambers of the pre-Persian temple. But most           important of all is the fact that the whole building was called           in the sixth century B.C. [Greek: to Ekatompedon.]. The word           [Greek: opisthodomos] does not occur in the inscription, and we           cannot tell whether the western half of the building was called           opisthodomos in the sixth century or not. Very likely it was.             Lolling (p. 637) says: \"No one, I think, will doubt that [Greek:           to Ecatompedon] is the [Greek: neô o Ecatompedos] often           mentioned in the inscriptions of the [Greek: tamiai] and           elsewhere.\" If this is correct, the eastern cella of the           Parthenon cannot be the [Greek: veôs o Ecatompedos]. Lolling           maintains that the eastern cella of the Parthenon was the           _Parthenon_ proper, that the western room of the Parthenon was           the opisthodomos, and that the [Greek: neôs o Ecatompedos],           was the pre-Persian temple. Besides the official name [Greek:           Ecatompedon] or [Greek: neô o Ekatompedos], Lolling thinks the           pre-Persian temple was also called [Greek: archaios (palaios)           neôs].[18] Dörpfeld maintains that the western cella of the           Parthenon was the _Parthenon_ proper, the western part of the  Page 10  \"old temple\" was the opisthodomos, and the eastern cella of the           Parthenon was the [Greek: neôs o Ekatompedos], leaving the           question undecided whether the \"old temple\" was still called           [Greek: to Ecatompedon] in the fifth century, but laying great           stress upon the difference in the expressions [Greek: to           Ecatompedon] and [Greek: o neôs o Ecatompedos].[19] Both Lolling           and Dörpfeld agree that the [Greek: "]]]
