I must hurry back to the store.\"    Roswell was already gone. His pride would not permit him to stand by  while Dick was conversing with a boot-black. He felt that his position  would be compromised. As for Dick, he was so well dressed that nobody  would know that he had ever been in that business. The fact is, Roswell,  like a great many other people, was troubled with a large share of  pride, though it might have puzzled himself to explain what he had to be  proud of. Had Dick been at all like him he would have shunned all his  former acquaintances, and taken every precaution against having it  discovered that he had ever occupied a similar position. But Dick was  above such meanness. He could see that Tom, for instance, was far  superior in all that constituted manliness to Roswell Crawford, and,  boot-black though he was, he prepared to recognize him as a friend.    When Dick reached the store, he did not immediately see Mr. Rockwell.    He accordingly entered the counting-room where Gilbert, the book-keeper,  was seated at a desk.    \"Here are the letters, Mr. Gilbert,\" said Dick.    \"Lay them down,\" said the book-keeper, sourly. \"You've been gone long  enough. How many did you drop on the way?\"    \"I didn't know I was expected to drop any,\" said Dick. \"If I had been  told to do so, I would have obeyed orders cheerfully.\"    Mr. Gilbert was about to remark that Dick was an impudent young rascal,  when the sudden entrance of Mr. Rockwell compelled him to suppress the  observation, and he was obliged to be content with muttering it to  himself.    \"Back already, Richard?\" said his employer, pleasantly. \"Where are the  letters?\"    \"Here, sir,\" said Dick.    \"Very well, you may go to Mr. Murdock, and see what he can find for you  to do.\"    Mr. Rockwell sat down to read his letters, and Dick went as directed to  the head clerk.    \"Mr. Rockwell sent me to you, Mr. Murdock,\" he said. \"He says you will  find something for me to do.\"    \"Oh, yes, we'll keep you busy,\" said the head clerk, with a manner very  different from that of the book-keeper. \"At present, however, your  duties will be of rather a miscellaneous character. We shall want you  partly for an entry clerk, and partly to run to the post-office, bank,  and so forth.\"    \"All right, sir,\" said Dick. \"I'm ready to do anything that is required  of me. I want to make myself useful.\"    \"That's the right way to feel, my young friend. Some boys are so  big-feeling and put on so many airs, that you'd think they were partners  in the business, instead of beginning at the lowest round of the ladder.  A while ago Mr. Gilbert brought round a cousin of his, about your age,  that he wanted to get in here; but the young gentleman was altogether  too lofty to suit me, so we didn't take him.\"    \"Was the boy's name Roswell Crawford?\"    \"Yes; do you know him?\"    \"Not much. He thinks I'm too far beneath him for him to associate with,  but he was kind enough to walk up Nassau Street with me this morning,  just to encourage me a little.\"    \"That was kind in him, certainly,\" said the head clerk, smiling. \"Unless  I am very much mistaken, you will be able to get along without his  patronage.\"    \"I hope so,\" said Dick.    The rest of the day Dick was kept busy in various ways. He took hold  with a will, and showed himself so efficient that he made a favorable  impression upon every one in the establishment, except the book-keeper.  For some reason or other Mr. Gilbert did not like Dick, and was  determined to oust him from his situation if an opportunity should  offer.          CHAPTER IV.    LIFE AT THE BOARDING-HOUSE.      Dick found his new quarters in Bleecker Street very comfortable. His  room was kept in neat order, which was more than could be said of his  former home in Mott Street. There once a fortnight was thought  sufficient to change the sheets, while both boys were expected to use  the same towel, and make that last a week. Indeed, Mrs. Mooney would  have considered the boys \"mighty particular\" if they had objected to  such an arrangement. Mrs. Browning, fortunately, was very different, and  Dick found nothing to complain of either in his chamber or in the board  which was furnished.    Dick had felt rather awkward on his first appearance at the table, but  he was beginning to feel more at his ease. It was rather remarkable,  considering his past life, how readily he adapted himself to an  experience so different. He left the store at five o'clock, and got to  his boarding-house in time to get ready for dinner. Dick had now got to  be quite particular about his appearance. He washed his face and hands  thoroughly, and brushed his hair carefully, before appearing at the  table.    Miss Peyton, the lively young lady who has already been mentioned in the  first chapter, sat near the boys, and evidently was quite prepossessed  in their favor. Both had bright and attractive faces, though Dick would  undoubtedly be considered the handsomest. He had a fresh color which  spoke of good health, and was well-formed and strong. Henry Fosdick was  more delicate in appearance; his face was thinner, and rather pale. It  was clear that he was not as well able to fight his way through life as  Dick. But there was something pleasant and attractive in his quiet  sedateness, as well as in the frank honesty and humor that could be read  in the glance of our friend Dick.    \"Won't you and your friend stop a little while and sing?\" asked Miss  Peyton, addressing Henry Fosdick on the evening of the second day of  Dick's business career.    Fosdick hesitated.    \"My friend has an engagement this evening,\" he said.    \"I suppose I may not ask where,\" said she.    \"I am invited to spend the evening with some friends on Madison Avenue,\"  said Dick.    \"Indeed?\" said Miss Peyton, surprised. \"I wasn't aware you had such  fashionable friends, or I couldn't have expected to retain you.\"    \"All my friends are not as fashionable,\" said Dick, wondering what the  young lady would say if she could see his late fellow-lodgers at Mrs.  Mooney's, on Mott Street.    \"If I can't hope to keep you this evening, you must promise to stay  awhile to-morrow evening. I hope to have the pleasure of hearing you  sing, Mr. Hunter.\"    \"When I give a concert,\" said Dick, \"I'll be sure to let you in  gratooitous.\"    \"Thank you,\" said Miss Peyton. \"I shall remind you of it. I hope that  time will come very soon.\"    \"Just as soon as I can engage the Academy of Music on reasonable terms.\"    \"You'd better try first in the parlor here. We'll take up a  contribution, to pay you for your exertions.\"    \"Thank you,\" said Dick. \"You're very kind, as the man said to the judge  when he asked him when it would be perfectly agreeable for him to be  hung.\"    Miss Peyton laughed at this remark, and Dick went upstairs to get ready  for his visit to Madison Avenue.    Our hero felt a little bashful about this visit. He was afraid that he  would do or say something that was improper, or that something would  slip out which would betray his vagabond life of the streets.    \"I wish you was going with me, Fosdick,\" he said.    \"You'll get along well enough alone, Dick. Don't be afraid.\"    \"You see I aint used to society, Fosdick.\"    \"Nor I either.\"    \"But it seems to come natural to you. I'm always makin' some blunder.\"    \"You'll get over that in time, Dick. It's because you have so much fun  in you. I am more sober. Miss Peyton seems very much amused by your odd  remarks.\"    \"I have to talk so; I can't think of anything else to say.\"    \"There's one thing, Dick, we mustn't give up at any rate.\"    \"What's that?\"    \"Studying. We don't either of us know as much as we ought to.\"    \"That's so.\"    \"You can see how much good studying has done for you so far. If it  hadn't been for that, you wouldn't have been able to go into Mr.  Rockwell's employment.\"    \"That's true enough, Fosdick. I'm afraid I don't know enough now.\"    \"You know enough to get along very well for the present, but you want to  rise.\"    \"You're right. When I get to be old and infirm I don't want to be an  errand-boy.\"    \"Nor I either. So, Dick, I think we had better make up our minds to  study an hour or an hour and a half every evening. Of course, you can't  begin this evening, but there are very few when you can't find the  time.\"    \"I'll send a circ'lar to my numerous friends on Fifth Avenue and  Madison, tellin' 'em how much I'm obliged for their kind invitations,  but the claims of literatoor and science can't be neglected.\"    \"Do you know, Dick, I think it might be well for us to begin French?\"    \"I wonder what Johnny Nolan would say if I should inquire after his  health in the polly-voo language?\"    \"It wouldn't be the first time you have astonished him.\"    \"Well, Fosdick, I'm in for it if you think it's best. Now tell me what  necktie I shall wear?\"    Dick displayed two. One was bright red with large figures, which he had  bought soon after he began to board in Mott Street. The other was a  plain black.    \"You'd better wear the black one, Dick,\" said Fosdick, whose taste was  simpler and better than his friend's.    \"It seems to me it don't look handsome enough,\" said Dick, whose taste  had not yet been formed, and was influenced by the Bowery style of  dress.    \"It's more modest, and that is all the better.\"    \"All right. I suppose you know best. Before I get ready I must give a  new shine to my boots. I'm going to make them shine so you can see your  face in them.\"    \"Better let me do that for you, Dick. I can do it while you're dressing,  and that will save time.\"    \"No, Fosdick, I was longer in the business than you, and none of the  boys could beat me on shines.\"    \"I don't know but you're right, Dick. I freely yield the palm to you in  that.\"    Dick stripped off his coat and vest and went to work with a will.

The value of the method for the  elementary education of musicians was immediately recognized and some  slight idea obtained of the part it might play in general elementary  education. It has been made clear that the method had its origin in the  attempt to give life and reality to musical education, to give a  foundational development on which specialized music study could be  based, and that it had grown naturally and gradually as the result of  observation and experiment. Now it began to be apparent that something  still greater than the original aim had been achieved, that the system  evolved was one which, properly used, might be of enormous value in the  education of children. With characteristic energy Jaques-Dalcroze,  inspired by the new idea, took up the study of psychology, in which he  was helped by his friend, the psychologist Claparede, who early saw the  value which the new ideas might have in educational practice. The change  of outlook which now took place in the master's mind can best be made  clear by a translation of his own words.[1]        [1] Address to students, Dresden, 1911 (_Der Rhythmus_,      vol. i, p. 33).        \"It is true that I first devised my method as a      musician for musicians. But the further I carried my      experiments, the more I noticed that, while a method      intended to develop the sense for rhythm, and indeed      based on such development, is of great importance in      the education of a musician, its chief value lies in      the fact that it trains the powers of apperception and      of expression in the individual and renders easier the      externalization of natural emotions. Experience teaches      me that a man is not ready for the specialized study of      an art until his character is formed, and his powers of      expression developed.\"    In 1906 was held the first training-course for teachers; how the method  has since grown can be realized by noting that a fortnight was then  considered a sufficient period of training, whilst now the teachers'  course at Hellerau requires from one to three years' steady work. In the  years 1907-9 the short teachers' courses were repeated; in the latter  year the first diploma was granted, experience having shown the need of  this, for already individuals in all parts of the world, after but a few  days' training, in some cases after merely being spectators at lessons,  were advertising themselves as teachers of the method. In 1910  Jaques-Dalcroze was invited by the brothers Wolf and Harald Dohrn to  come to Dresden, where, in the garden suburb of Hellerau, they have  built him a College for Rhythmic Training, a true Palace of Rhythm.      II. PRACTICE[1]        [1] In the preparation of this chapter free use has      been made of the writings of M. Jaques-Dalcroze and of      Dr. Wolf Dohrn, Director of the College of Music and      Rhythm, Hellerau, Dresden.      The method naturally falls into three divisions--        (_a_) Rhythmic gymnastics proper.      (_b_) Ear training.      (_c_) Improvisation (practical harmony).    (_a_) Is essentially the Jaques-Dalcroze method--that which is  fundamentally new. As it is this part of the method which is likely to  prove of great value in all systems of education, not merely as a  preparation for the study of music, but as a means to the utmost  development of faculty in the individual, it will be dealt with in  detail.    (_b_) Is of the greatest importance as an adjunct to rhythmic  gymnastics, since it is through the ear that rhythm-impressions are most  often and most easily obtained. Jaques-Dalcroze naturally uses his own  methods of ear-training, which are extremely successful, but he does not  lay stress on them; he does, however, emphasize the need of such  training, whatever the method, as shall give the pupil an accurate sense  of pitch, both absolute and relative, and a feeling for tonality. The  more these are possessed the greater the use which can be made of  rhythmic gymnastics.        [Illustration: Beating 4/4.]        [Illustration: Movements for the Semibreve.]    (_c_) This is not required in the _pupil_, however valuable it may be as  an additional means of self-expression; it is, however, absolutely  necessary for the successful _teacher_ of rhythmic gymnastics, who must  be able to express, on some instrument--most conveniently the  piano--whatever rhythms, simple or compound, he may wish to use in the  training of his pupils. This subject, therefore, naturally forms an  important part of the normal course at the Hellerau College, since this  course is planned to meet the needs of students preparing for the  teaching diploma in Eurhythmics. Here, too, Jaques-Dalcroze has his own  system, with which he obtains results often remarkable, but, as in the  case of the ear-training, this is a detail not peculiar to the method as  a whole.    To repeat: the essentials are that the teacher have the power of free  expression on some musical instrument, the pupil that of hearing  correctly.           *       *       *       *       *    The system of exercises known as rhythmic gymnastics is based upon two  ideas, (i) _time_ is shown by movements of the arms, (ii) _time-values_,  i.e., note-duration, by movements of the feet and body. In the early  stages of the training this principle is clearly observed; later it may  be varied in many ingenious ways, for instance in what is known as  plastic counterpoint, where the actual notes played are represented by  movements of the arms, while the counterpoint in crotchets, quavers or  semiquavers, is given by the feet.    The system of beating time with the arms provides for all tempi from  2/4 to 12/4 and includes 5/4 7/4 9/4.    In the series of movements to represent note-values the crotchet is  taken as the unit; this is represented by a step; higher values, from  the minim to the whole note of twelve beats, are represented by a step  with one foot and a movement or movements with the other foot or with  the body, but without progression, e.g., a minim by one step and a knee  bend, a dotted minim by a step and two movements without progression, a  whole note of twelve beats by a step and eleven movements. Thus for  each note in the music there is one step, one progression in space,  while at the same time the note, if of greater length than a crotchet,  is analysed into crotchets.    Notes of shorter duration than the crotchet, i.e., quavers, triplets,  etc., are expressed also by steps which become quicker in proportion to  their frequency.    When the movements corresponding to the notes from the crotchet to the  whole note of twelve beats have, with all their details, become a habit,  the pupil need only make them mentally, contenting himself with one step  forward. This step will have the exact length of the whole note, which  will be mentally analysed into its various elements. Although these  elements are not individually performed by the body, their images and  the innervations suggested by those images take the place of the  movements.    The process is similar to that of the child learning to read; at first  it reads aloud, then to itself, still, however, moving its lips, i.e.,  still making all the innervations necessary for the pronunciation of the  words. Only after much practice does the process become sufficiently  automatic for these lip and tongue innervations to be dropped. Indeed,  many adults show traces of them when they read. To what degree our power  to read is based upon such innervations is shown by the fact that old  people, as their inhibitory powers become weaker, often revert to making  these lip movements. From this we may conclude that such innervations,  although they do not find their natural expression, still exist and  have effect, i.e., they are necessary. The Jaques-Dalcroze method aims  at nothing more or less than the training of rhythmic innervations.    The whole training aims at developing the power of rapid physical  reaction to mental impressions. These latter are more commonly obtained  through the ear, chiefly from the music played; naturally, however, the  teacher needs at times to give commands during an exercise. For this  purpose he invariably uses the word _hopp_, a word chosen for its clear  incisiveness.    Before each exercise it is clearly stated what the word is to represent  in that particular case, e.g., omit one beat, omit one bar, beat time  twice as fast with the arms, etc.; often the word will be used in series  in an exercise, each _hopp_ meaning some additional change. As the  command generally falls on the second half of the beat preceding the one  in which the change is to be made, very rapid mental and physical  response is necessary, especially if the music be at all quick.  Exercises of this class soon give the power of rapid muscular  innervation and inhibition, and are of extraordinary value in education,  quite apart from their purely rhythmic side.    We will now consider the exercises in some detail, taking, as a matter  of convenience, the order and grouping generally adopted at  demonstrations of the method. In actual practice such strict grouping is  neither possible nor necessary; the actual form which the lessons take  will depend upon the genius of teacher and pupils, the possibilities of  variety being infinite.        [Sidenote: =MOVEMENTS TO INDICATE VARIOUS TEMPI=]    Simple music is played to which the pupils march. As they grasp the beat  they mark it by an accented step; when this becomes easy, the  corresponding arm movements are added, and the strong beat, at this  stage always the first, is marked by full contraction of the arm  muscles. Practice is given until at _hopp_ the pupil can stop suddenly,  discontinue accenting with one or both arms or with one or both feet,  substitute an arm-movement for a foot "]]]
