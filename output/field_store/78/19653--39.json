Did decency permit I could show  conclusively how Whall and Bullen are right and the mere collector  wrong. It must suffice, however, for me to say that the term  'Hog's-eye' or 'Hog-eye' had nothing whatever to do with the optic of  the 'man' who was sung about. I could multiply instances, but this one  is typical and must suffice.    We hear a great deal of the coarseness and even lewdness of the  shanty, but I could wish a little more stress were laid on the  sailor's natural delicacy. Jack was always a gentleman in feeling.  Granted his drinking, cursing, and amours--but were not these, until  Victorian times, the hall-mark of every gentleman ashore? The  Rabelaisian jokes of the shantyman were solos, the sound of which  would not travel far beyond the little knot of workers who chuckled  over them. The choruses--shouted out by the whole working party--would  be heard all over the ship and even penetrate ashore if she were in  port. Hence, in not a single instance do the choruses of any shanty  contain a coarse expression.      EDITORIAL METHODS    As regards the tunes, I have adhered to the principle of giving each  one as it was sung by some individual singer. This method has not been  applied to the words. Consequently the verses of any given shanty may  have derived from any number of singers. Since there was no connection  or relevancy between the different verses of a shanty, the only  principle I have adhered to is that whatever verses are set down  should have been sung to me at some time or other by some sailor or  other.    Of course I have had to camouflage many unprintable expressions, and  old sailors will readily recognize where this has been done. Sometimes  a whole verse (after the first line) has needed camouflage, and the  method adopted is best expressed as follows:         There was a young lady of Gloucester       Who couldn't eat salt with her egg,       And when she sat down       She could never get up,       And so the poor dog had none.    As regards the accompaniments, I have been solely guided by the  necessity of preserving the character of the melodies in all their  vigour and vitality, and have tried, even in obviously modal tunes,  not to obscure their breeziness by academic treatment.      ACKNOWLEDGMENTS    Amongst those to whom I owe thanks, I must number the Editors of _The  Music Student_ and _Music and Letters_, for allowing me to incorporate  in this Preface portions of articles which I have written for them.  Also to Capt. W.J. Dowdy, both for singing shanties to me himself, and  affording me facilities for interviewing inmates of the Royal Albert  Institution, over which he presides. I also wish to express my  gratitude to those sailors who have in recent years sung shanties to  me, especially Capt. R.W. Robertson, Mr. Geo. Vickers, Mr. Richard  Allen, of Seahouses, and Mr. F.B. Mayoss. And last, but not least, to  Mr. Morley Roberts, who has not only sung shanties to me, but has also  given me the benefit of his ripe nautical experience.    R.R.T.    _Hampstead_, 1921.          NOTES ON THE SHANTIES      1. BILLY BOY    This is undoubtedly a coast song 'made into a shanty.' I heard it in  Northumberland, both on shore and in ships, when I was a boy. The  theme of a 'Boy Billy' seems common to folk-songs in different parts  of the country. The tunes are different, and the words vary, but the  topic is always the same: 'Billy' is asked where he has been all the  day; he replies that he has been courting; he is then questioned as to  the qualifications of his _inamorata_ as a housewife. Dr.  Vaughan-Williams's 'My Boy Billie' is in print and well known, as is  also Mr. Cecil Sharp's 'My Boy Willie' ['English Folk-Songs,' vol. i,  page 98]. I have also collected different versions in Warwickshire and  Somerset. The version of line 1, page 3, bars 2 and 3, is older than  the one given in my arrangement for male-voice chorus (Curwen Edition  50572), so, upon consideration, I decided to give it here. There are  many more verses, but they are not printable, nor do they readily lend  themselves to camouflage. The tune has not appeared in print until  now.      2. BOUND FOR THE RIO GRANDE    The variants of this noble tune are legion. But this version, which a  sailor uncle taught me, has been selected, as I think it the most  beautiful of all. I used to notice, even as a boy, how it seemed to  inspire the shantyman to sentimental flights of _Heimweh_ that at  times came perilously near poetry. The words of the well-known song,  'Where are you going to, my pretty maid?' were frequently sung to this  shanty, and several sailors have told me that they had also used the  words of the song known as 'The Fishes.' Capt. Whall gives 'The  Fishes' on pages 96 and 97 of his book, and says that the words were,  in his time, sometimes used to the tune of 'Blow the man down.'      3. GOOD-BYE, FARE YE WELL    This is one of the best beloved of shanties. So strongly did its  sentiment appeal to sailors that one never heard the shantyman  extemporize a coarse verse to it. Whall prints a version, page 71.      4. JOHNNY COME DOWN TO HILO    This is clearly of negro origin. I learnt several variants of it, but  for its present form I am indebted to Capt. W.J. Dowdy.      5. CLEAR THE TRACK, LET THE BULLGINE RUN    The tune was a favourite in Yankee Packets. It does not appear in  Whall. 'Bullgine' was American negro slang for 'engine.' I picked up  this version in boyhood from Blyth seamen.      6. LOWLANDS    For another version see Whall (page 80), who says it is of American  origin and comes from the cotton ports of the old Southern States. It  was well known to every sailor down to the time of the China Clippers.  My version is that of Capt. John Runciman, who belonged to that  period. I have seldom found it known to sailors who took to the sea  after the early seventies. The tune was sung in very free time and  with great solemnity. It is almost impossible to reproduce in print  the elusive subtlety of this haunting melody. In North-country ships  the shantyman used to make much of the theme of a dead lover appearing  in the night. There were seldom any rhymes, and the air was  indescribably touching when humoured by a good hand. A 'hoosier,' by  the way, is a cotton stevedore. An interesting point about this shanty  is that, whether by accident or design, it exhibits a rhythmic device  commonly practised by mediaeval composers, known as _proportio  sesquialtera_. Expressed in modern notation it would mean the  interpolation of bars of three-four time in the course of a  composition which was in six-eight time. The number of quavers would,  of course, be the same in each bar; but the rhythm would be different.  The barring here adopted does not show this.      7. SALLY BROWN    For another version of this universally known shanty see Whall, page  64. Although its musical form is that of a halliard shanty, it was  always used for the capstan. I never heard it used for any other  purpose than heaving the anchor. The large-sized notes given in the  last bar are those which most sailors sing to me nowadays; the small  ones are those which I most frequently heard when a boy.      8. SANTY ANNA    This fine shanty was a great favourite, and in defiance of all history  the sailor presents 'Santy Anna' in the light of an invariable victor.  The truth is that Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna (1795-1876) was the  last President of Mexico before the annexation by America of  California, Texas, and New Mexico. He defeated the Spaniards at  Zampico, and held Vera Cruz against the French, but was badly beaten  at Molina del Rey by the United States Army under General Taylor  (1847). He was recalled to the Presidency in 1853, but overthrown in  1855. He attempted to overturn the Republic in 1867; was captured and  sentenced to death, but was pardoned on condition that he left the  country. He retired to the United States until 1872, when a general  amnesty allowed his return to Mexico. Like other Mexican Presidents,  he lived a stormy life, but unlike most of them he died a natural  death. Whall gives a version on page 89.      9. SHENANDOAH    This is one of the most famous of all shanties. I never met a sailor  to whom it was unknown, nor have I ever found any two who sang it  exactly alike. This version (sung to me by Capt. Robertson) is almost,  but not quite, identical with the one I learnt as a boy. Shenandoah  (English seamen usually pronounced it 'Shannandore') was a celebrated  Indian chief after whom an American town is named. A branch of the  Potomac river bears the same name. The tune was always sung with great  feeling and in very free rhythm. Whall gives a version on page 1.      10. STORMALONG JOHN    This is one of the many shanties with 'Stormy' as their hero. Whatever  other verses were extemporized, those relating to digging his grave  with a silver spade, and lowering him down with a golden chain, were  rarely omitted. Other favourite verses were:         (_a_) I wish I was old Stormy's son.       (_b_) I'd build a ship a thousand ton.    Who 'Stormy' was is undiscoverable, but more than a dozen shanties  mourn him.      11. THE HOG'S-EYE MAN    Of the numberless versions of this shanty I have chosen that of Capt.  Robertson as being the most representative. Of the infinite number of  verses to this fine tune hardly one is printable. There has been much  speculation as to the origin of the title. As a boy my curiosity was  piqued by reticence, evasion, or declarations of ignorance, whenever I  asked the meaning of the term. It was only in later life that I learnt  it from Mr. Morley Roberts. His explanation made it clear why every  _sailor_ called it either 'hog-eye' or 'hog's-eye,' and why only  _landsmen_ editors ever get the word wrong. One collector labels the  shanty 'The hog-eyed man,' and another goes still further wide of"]]]
