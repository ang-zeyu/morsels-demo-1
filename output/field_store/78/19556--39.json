We should rather add  to our zeal and persist in our prayers and endeavours... It always takes  time for a people to change from one administration to another. Up to the  present they have been accustomed to think of the local assemblies as next  only to the Center of the Cause, and it will take some time and training  before they can admit another superior.    [From the Guardian:]    I have cabled to Bombay and will soon confirm it by letter. I have urged  them to support consistently and whole-heartedly the very essential and  vital institutions of the National Fund and the National Assembly. It must  be made clear to them all that continuous support to these twin  institutions is the corner-stone of all future achievements, the  mainspring from which all future blessings will flow. Persevere in your  heroic effort and remember that the end is glorious and bright.    September 7, 1926    I take pleasure in thanking you on behalf of our dear Guardian, Shoghi  Effendi, for your letter...    As it announced the election of a new body to take up the responsible but  lofty work of supervising and guiding the promulgation of the Baha'i Cause  throughout India and Burma, Shoghi Effendi wishes me to take this  opportunity and assure each and every member of that distinguished body  not only of his heartfelt congratulations and prayers but also of the high  hopes that he cherishes for you all. It is from you and through you that  he expects to see emanating that glorious spirit for which our departed  Master gave his entire life; and with your earnest endeavours, your  consummate wisdom and your unflinching faith he awaits to see you lead the  humble workers of that great country to an ultimate victory.    May I also take this opportunity and express the great desire of Shoghi  Effendi that the National Assembly should try to be in close communication  with him. To him it is a joy beyond words to try to do all in his power to  help you in the noble work you have undertaken.    [From the Guardian:]    Now that the N.S.A. has been properly constituted and its officers duly  appointed, it is incumbent upon each and all to introduce and promote such  measures as will consolidate the work that you have so well begun. The  institution of the National Fund, a Baha'i Bulletin similar to the News  Letter issued by the American N.S.A., a rigorous and well-conceived  campaign of Teaching, a continuous and purposeful endeavour to coordinate  the activities of the local Assemblies and groups throughout India and  Burma and the sending of detailed and frequent reports to the Holy Land  are among the most primary and urgent requirements of the new day that has  dawned upon India. I eagerly await your reports and assure you of my  continued prayers for the success of your arduous labours.    October 28, 1926          Publication of Kaukab      The news that the difficulties, which for a time prevailed and threatened  grave disturbances between the N.S.A. and the Local Assemblies, have  vanished, was a source of great satisfaction and gratification to him. We  were quite sure that it was all due to misunderstandings and that they  would be easily overcome...    In a letter which I have lately written to Seyed Jenabe Ali on behalf of  Shoghi Effendi, I intimated his desire that a special committee of the  N.S.A. should be created to undertake the management of everything  pertaining to the Kaukab. Furthermore, if a certain sum is offered to the  National Fund with the expressed desire that it should be spent for the  Kaukab, i.e., if the offer is labelled, then the N.S.A. should take into  consideration the wish of the giver and spend it only for that purpose.  Though the friends are advised to give unlabelled contributions they  cannot in any way be prevented from using their choice in the way it  should be spent.    Though the Local Assemblies should give the N.S.A. all the moral and  financial support the latter needs, it is the duty of the N.S.A. to  inspire the necessary confidence in keeping the management of its work as  efficiently as possible.    In a cable recently sent to the N.S.A. Shoghi Effendi recommended the  publication of the Kaukab. He desires this paper to play an important role  in drawing the attention of the more thoughtful and seeking people to the  potency of this divine Cause. I herein enclose a cheque for L19 which  Shoghi Effendi desires to be spent for this all important organ of the  Cause in India.    [From the Guardian:]    I am enclosing a general message, clearly worded, emphatically expressed,  and vitally important in all its bearings, conveyed through Mirza Mahmood  to the National Assembly for the information of all Baha'is in India and  Burma. I am sure you will promptly and effectively take all necessary  measures for its dissemination throughout India and Burma. The 'Kaukab'  must, at all costs be continued, and I feel that its two editors ... are  the most suitable to form a committee which will conduct its affairs under  the direct supervision of the National Assembly. Whatever is contributed  to the National Assembly for a specific purpose should be expended for  that purpose only, but I would encourage the friends to send unlabelled  contributions in order not to tie the hands of the National Assembly  although I do not in the least require them to do so. I will pray for your  success from all my heart.    November 16, 1926          The Baha'i News      It is most gratifying to him to hear that the difficulties that darkened  the horizon of the Cause in India have vanished and the National as well  as Local Assemblies are united to further the interests of the Cause. He  hopes that Kaukab will become a Baha'i organ administered even better than  before.    Shoghi Effendi hopes that Aqa Mirza Moneer will cause another stir in  India and draw many individuals into a full understanding of the movement.  His zeal as well as knowledge of the Cause stand to his credit and are  sure to win him success wherever he goes. Please convey to him Shoghi  Effendi's loving greetings and assure him of his prayers.    [From the Guardian:]    I hope to hear soon of the re-establishment and circulation of the Kaukab.  The matter of the publication of a Baha'i News Letter issued by the  National Assembly is also of utmost importance. May the support to the  National Fund be such as to render it a truly worthy and representative  Baha'i periodical. Persevere in your splendid efforts and do not lose  heart for I will continue to pray for you from the depth of my heart.    December 21, 1926          Widen the Scope of Activities      With the opening of this new Baha'i year our Guardian trusts that it will  be marked by a new and greater effort, by a more intense cooperation among  the friends in India and Burma and by an unsurpassed record of success.    Now that Mrs. Schopflocker has in many places broken the ground, it  devolves upon the faithful workers in India to follow up the work, to  seize every opportunity and to give to her hasty and in many places  insufficient services a more permanent and lasting character.    I express the hopes of our Guardian without disregard to your many  problems and difficulties, but the field is so vast and the ground so  fresh and fertile that it cannot but evoke almost unreasonable  expectations. This feeling and yearning, I am sure, is much more yours  than ours could be.    [From the Guardian:]    I urge you to take every means at your disposal ... to follow up the work  that has been so splendidly begun by Mrs. Schopflocker. I would also urge  you to arrange for the preparation of an annual report by the National  Assembly of the activities of the friends in India and Burma, to be  forwarded to the American National Spiritual Assembly for insertion in the  next issue of the Annual Baha'i Year Book. A representative group  photograph of the Baha'is of divers races and creeds in that land would  also greatly enhance the Year Book, if such a thing is possible.    April 25, 1927    He is very glad to learn of the good work of Nabilzadeh and Mrs.  Schopflocker and hopes that the friends will follow up their work in order  to obtain some definite and permanent results. For a teacher to fly from  one end of India to another is not sufficient, there must be somebody who  can stay long enough in one place and start regular gatherings.    The latter function naturally falls upon the friends in India and he  earnestly hopes that the new year may bring fresh and lasting  achievements.    Shoghi Effendi awaits eagerly the results of the election of the N.S.A.  and he should like to see that body accomplish something more than routine  work. They should take new steps and carry out a regular campaign in India  and Burma.    [From the Guardian:]    It is my hope and prayer that the newly-elected National and Local  Assemblies may widen the scope of their activities, initiate new and  valuable measures, extend the circle of their correspondence with foreign  Baha'i centres, and promote the independence and distinctiveness of the  Baha'i Faith. I would urge you to inform the Year Book Committee through  Mr. Holley of the results of all elections in India and to send if  possible an annual report to that Committee. Wishing you success and  happiness.    May 24, 1927    In the midst of his work and many responsibilities, it is a source of  comfort for him to feel that the initiative and guidance of the Cause in  India is in such able hands and he trusts to see in the near future  greater and fuller results.    True, the minds of many are turned away from all that sounds religious,  but it is only because they are ill-advised as to the meaning of true  religion and it is just that mission that devolves upon us--to give a new  viewpoint, to revive fresh hopes and to guide by the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19274"],[0,"Letters from the Guardian to Australia and New Zealand (#5)"],[1,"next Annual Convention; the Guardian  believes that the fact that a certain assembly or community is not in a  financial position to defray the expenses of its delegate or delegates  does not constitute sufficient justification for depriving it from its  sacred right of participation in the national elections and other  activities of the Convention. Every assembly, no matter how poor, is  entitled to take part in the Convention proceedings by sending one or more  delegates to that meeting. It is absolutely essential that this principle  be clearly understood and faithfully applied by the friends. Financial  considerations can under no circumstances invalidate it, or allow the  least compromise in its application. It is the duty of every N.S.A. to  ensure that it will be carried out whenever the Convention elections are  held.    With loving greetings,    Yours in the Guardian's Service,  H. Rabbani.    [From the Guardian:]    Dear and valued co-worker:    I would be very pleased to receive two more copies of the registration  form of the Auckland Assembly and three copies of the form of the Adelaide  Assembly some of which I shall place in the Mansion of Baha'u'llah at  Bahji. Will you also send me three copies of the registration form of  every Assembly which will be incorporated in the future. The foundations  which your National Assembly is now laying with such assiduous care and  exemplary loyalty constitute a service that is truly historic and is  highly meritorious in the sight of God. I feel deeply indebted to you for  such splendid achievements. Persevere and never lose heart.    Your true and grateful brother,  Shoghi.            LETTER OF DECEMBER 1ST, 1936      December 1st, 1936    Dear Miss Brooks,    The Guardian has just received the first issue of the newsletter published  by the N.S.A. of the Baha'i's of Australia and New-Zealand, and has read  it all through with deepest pleasure and satisfaction. He wishes me to ask  you to transmit to your fellow-members in that body his warmest thanks for  this new step they have taken for the further consolidation of the  Administration in their country, as well as his most hearty  congratulations upon the ever-increasing success that is attending their  labours in this field.    It is his fervent hope that this organ your Assembly has initiated will  fully serve its purpose by intensifying the spirit of cooperation between  the N.S.A. and all local assemblies, groups and isolated believers  throughout Australia and New-Zealand. Such a medium, if properly utilized,  can be of inestimable value to the believers, by further enriching their  knowledge and understanding of the principles and actual functioning of  the Administrative order of the Faith, and by maintaining alive, nay  intensifying in them the desire to promote and safeguard its interests.    He would, therefore, earnestly appeal to every believer in Australia and  New-Zealand to make full and continued use of this bulletin, and consider  it as a most effective means to closer fellowship and to a deeper  understanding of his duties and responsibilities as builder of the New  World Order of Baha'u'llah.    He is ardently praying to the Almighty to ever bless and guide your  Assembly's endeavours in this connection,    Yours in His Service,  H. Rabbani.            LETTER OF FEBRUARY 4TH, 1937      February 4th, 1937    Dear Miss Brooks,    I am instructed by the Guardian to inform you of the receipt of your  letter of the 2nd January, and of the enclosed reports of the Adelaide and  Auckland spiritual assemblies, and to renew to you, and through you to  your fellow-members in the N.S.A., his grateful appreciation of the warm  welcome you have so lovingly extended to that dear and distinguished  servant of the Cause Mr. Siegfried Schopflocher during his visit to  Australia and New-Zealand. It is his fervent hope that the spirit his  visit has released will long serve to sustain the friends in their heavy  task of expanding the foundations of the Administrative Order throughout  that continent.    Regarding Mr. Bolton's question as to whether the Guardian has given any  instructions to the friends as to the best way to make their investments  secure during the coming world crisis; I am instructed to inform you that  no such directions have been given either to any individual believer or to  any assembly. The only advice which the Guardian wishes to give is that  whatever investment the friends make they should do it with the utmost  caution, as economic and financial conditions are at present most unstable  and even precarious.    Shoghi Effendi has been very deeply grieved to learn of Mr. ...'s  resignation from both the N.S.A. and the Sydney local Assembly, and of his  request to leave altogether the Cause. He wishes me, however, to assure  your Assembly not to feel discouraged at this truly sad happening, but to  confidently strive to bring him back into the community. Should he  persistently refuse to return, the best thing would be to leave him to  himself, and to pray for him that Baha'u'llah may, in His infinite mercy  and love, open again his eyes, and lead him out of the state of spiritual  lethargy into which he has so sadly fallen.    With the assurance of the Guardian's best wishes, and of his continual  prayers for you, and for your distinguished fellow-members in the N.S.A.,    Yours Sincerely in His Service,  H. Rabbani.    [From the Guardian:]    Dear and prized co-worker:    I am delighted with the progress of your activities and with your splendid  achievements in both the teaching and administrative spheres of Baha'i  service. The National Spiritual Assembly is laying a firm and unassailable  foundation for the administrative Order of the Faith, and I wish to  congratulate all its members and committees on the marvellous progress  thus far achieved. I will continue to pray for them from all my heart. I  will specially supplicate for the success of this coming Convention. May  your hopes be fulfilled in every respect.    Gratefully and affectionately,  Shoghi.            LETTER OF MARCH 18TH, 1937      March 18th, 1937    Dear Miss Brooks,    On behalf of the Guardian I acknowledge with thanks the receipt of your  letter of the 17th February with the enclosed report of the Sydney local  assembly, and wish to express his gratification at the news of the  progress which that community is making in the teaching work. He has noted  with deep satisfaction that two new names have been added to their  membership roll, and hopes that this step will mark the beginning of a new  era of teaching expansion throughout that center. He wishes you to kindly  congratulate the Sydney Assembly for this splendid success which their  teaching efforts have won, and to urge them to continue in their  endeavours for the attraction and confirmation of New Souls. May the  Beloved aid, sustain and ever bless them in His service.    The Guardian is delighted to learn that the necessary arrangements for the  holding of your next Annual Convention have been completed, and while he  deplores the fact that owing to the long distances that separate the  centers full attendance at this national gathering would not be feasible,  he nevertheless hopes that it will be a most successful meeting, and will  be marked all through by a perfect spirit of unity and fellowship. He  wishes you to assure the delegates of his prayers for the success of their  deliberations, and to convey to them his warmest greetings and best wishes  for a happy Ridvan.    Yours ever in His Service,  H. Rabbani.    P.S. Shoghi Effendi wishes me to express his thanks for the four  reproductions of the Adelaide Assembly registration form and trust which  you had enclosed in your letter, one of which he has ordered to be placed  in Baha'u'llah's Mansion at Bahji, and another one he wishes to  incorporate in the manuscript of the next \"Baha'i World\" (vol. VII).    H.R.    [From the Guardian:]    Dear and valued co-worker:    I am truly gratified and delighted to receive so many evidences of the  zeal, the loyalty and the devotion with which the believers in Australia  and New-Zealand are extending the range of their historic activities. I  feel deeply grateful to them. I will most assuredly pray for them that the  Beloved may bless their high endeavours and aid them to establish His  Cause and proclaim far and wide its verities and teachings.    Shoghi.            LETTER OF AUGUST 29TH, 1937      August 29th, 1937    Beloved Baha'i Sister,    Your welcome communication of June 30 written on behalf of the N.S.A., as  well as the accompanying papers and reports have all been received, and  their contents read with keenest interest and appreciation by our beloved  Guardian.    How rejoiced he feels to witness the increasing evidences of the growing  progress of the community of the Australian and New-Zealand believers. The  considerable work that they have accomplished during the last few years,  in both the teaching and the administrative fields, could not indeed have  been carried out without the wise and effective leadership of your N.S.A.  who, ever since its inception, has been functioning with a loyalty and  efficiency that are truly remarkable.    The success of this year's Convention, as evidenced by the report of the  proceedings you had sent, marks a further step in the process of steady  consolidation through which the N.S.A. is passing, and indicates how  strong are the loyalty and attachment which it has awakened among the body  of the believers throughout Australia and New-Zealand.    It is the Guardian's fervent hope that this confidence which your Assembly  has inspired will be further strengthened during the course of this year,  and that this in turn will deepen in the members the sense of the heavy  responsibility they have to shoulder for the extension and consolidation  of Baha'i work throughout that continent.
