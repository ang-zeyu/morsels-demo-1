She was so unutterably beautiful  that he almost swooned away in ecstacy.    Presently the maiden went to bed and fell into an uneasy sleep. The  light of a single candle shed a faint radiance over her face making it  lovelier than ever. Through all the long hours of night Danilo stood  perfectly still, gazing at her, afraid almost to breathe lest he should  disturb her.    \"Unless I win her for wife,\" he thought to himself, \"I shall nevermore  be happy!\"    When morning came the maiden awoke with a start and said:    \"There's some one looking at me! Who is it? Who is it?\"    \"It's only your poor Danilo,\" a voice answered.    \"Danilo? Who is Danilo?\"    \"The youth whom you have been treating so cruelly. But though you have  treated me cruelly, I love you still!\"    \"If you love me still,\" the maiden said, \"let me see you.\"    Danilo took off the magic cap and there he stood, a handsome youth, at  the foot of her bed. Then the crafty maiden spoke him fair and Danilo  told her about the magic cap, and when she said to him that she repented  having treated him so cruelly and asked him to let her see the cap, the  poor young man was so dazzled by her beauty and her seeming kindness  that he handed it to her at once.    Instantly she clapped it on her head and disappeared. Then she laughed  in derision and called out loudly to the guards:    \"Ho, there! Take out this young man and drive him forth! Let him return  when he has another treasure to offer me!\"    So the guards dragged Danilo out and drove him away.    With no more gold, with no more magic cap, Danilo returned to his  father's house.    \"Perhaps there are other treasures hidden away,\" he thought. \"I'll  search further.\"    In his search he came upon an old pitcher and thinking it might be  silver he began rubbing it. Instantly there was a clap of thunder and a  company of soldiers appeared. Their captain saluted Danilo respectfully  and said:    \"We are the servants of that magic pitcher. What does our master wish?\"    \"Magic pitcher?\" stammered Danilo. \"And am I your master?\"    \"Yes,\" said the captain, \"you are our master as long as you hold the  magic pitcher in your hands.\"    \"You may disappear now,\" Danilo said. \"I will rub the pitcher when I  need you.\"    Delighted with this unexpected good fortune, he hurried off to the woods  to the hut of the old woman who had befriended him before. He showed her  the pitcher and demonstrated for her how it worked. Then he asked her to  carry a message to Peerless Beauty.    \"Tell her,\" he said, \"that unless she consents to marry me at once I'll  lead a mighty army against her, take her captive, and then send her off  in exile to that howling wilderness which people call the Donkeys'  Paradise.\"    \"I will deliver your message,\" the old woman said, \"on condition that  you promise me to be on your guard this time. Don't let the maiden trick  you again. She is under an enchantment that makes her cruel and crafty  and the enchantment will never be broken until she meets a man upon whom  her wiles have no effect.\"    \"Trust me this time,\" Danilo said. \"I've had my lesson.\"    So the old woman delivered the message and when Peerless Beauty  received it with scorn, Danilo at once set out for the castle with the  magic pitcher in his hand. He began rubbing and every time he rubbed a  company of soldiers appeared. Soon the castle was surrounded by a great  army and in fright and dismay Peerless Beauty sent out word that she was  ready to make an unconditional surrender.    When Danilo entered the castle he found her humble and meek.    \"I have treated you cruelly,\" she said. \"Now I am in your power, do with  me what you will.\" And she began weeping softly until the sight of her  tears drove Danilo distracted.    \"Weep no more, dear lady!\" he cried. \"You have nothing to fear from me!  I love you! I am your slave!\"    The Peerless one slowly dried her tears.    \"If you love me as you say you do, you will tell me by what magic you  have raised this great army.\"    Then Danilo, forgetting the old woman's warning, took the magic pitcher  out of his shirt and showed the maiden how it worked.    \"Ah!\" she murmured wonderingly. \"It looks like any old pitcher! Please,  Danilo, let me see it in my own hands.\"    Danilo handed her the pitcher and, quick as a flash, she rubbed it.  There was a clap of thunder, a company of soldiers appeared, and their  captain saluting her respectfully said:    \"What does the mistress of the pitcher want?\"    \"Nay!\" cried Danilo, \"it is I who own the pitcher, not she!\"    \"We are the servants,\" the captain said, \"of whoever holds the pitcher.\"    At that Peerless Beauty laughed loud and scornfully until the castle  rang with her merriment.    \"Seize that wretch!\" she said, pointing to Danilo. \"Tie his hands and  drive him out in exile to the Donkeys' Paradise! Let him stay there  until he has another treasure to present me!\"    So they drove Danilo out to the wilderness and left him there.    He wandered about for many days hungry and thirsty, subsisting on roots  and berries, and having for drink only the water that collected in the  hoof prints of the wild beasts.    \"See what I've come to!\" he cried aloud. \"Why didn't I heed the old  woman's warning! If I had, I should have broken the evil enchantment  that binds my Peerless Beauty and all would have been well!\"    One day as he wandered about he came upon a vine that was laden with  great clusters of luscious red grapes. He fell upon them ravenously and  ate bunch after bunch. Suddenly he felt something in his hair and  lifting his hands he found that horns had grown out all over his head.    \"Fine grapes these are!\" he exclaimed, \"to bring out horns on a person's  head!\"    However, he was so hungry that he kept on eating until his head was one  mass of horns.    The next day he found a vine that had clusters of white grapes. He began  eating the white grapes and he hadn't finished a bunch before the horns  all fell off his head.    \"Ha!\" he said. \"The red grapes put horns on and the white grapes take  them off! That's a trick worth knowing!\"    He took some reeds and fashioned two baskets one of which he filled with  red grapes and the other with white grapes. Then staining his face with  the dark juice of a leaf until he looked brown and sunburned like a  countryman, he went back to Peerless Beauty's castle. There he marched  up and down below the Peerless one's window crying his wares like a  huckster:    \"Sweet grapes for sale! Who wants my fresh sweet grapes!\"    Now it was not the season for grapes, so Peerless Beauty when she heard  the cry was surprised and said to her serving maid:    \"Go quickly and buy me some grapes from that huckster and mind you don't  eat one yourself!\"    The serving maid hurried out to Danilo and he sold her some of the red  grapes. As she carried them in, she couldn't resist the temptation of  slipping a few into her mouth. Instantly some horns grew out on her  head.    \"That's to punish me for disobeying my mistress!\" the poor girl cried.  \"Oh, dear, what shall I do?\"    She was afraid to show herself to Peerless Beauty, so she pretended she  was taken sick and she went to bed and pulled the sheet over her head  and sent in the grapes by another serving maid.    Peerless Beauty ate them all before she discovered their frightful  property. Then there was a great to-do, and cries of anger and of  fright, and a quick sending out of the guards to find the huckster. But  the huckster had disappeared.    What could Peerless Beauty do now? She tried to pull the horns out but  they wouldn't come. She tried to cut them off but they resisted the edge  of the sharpest knife. She was too proud to show herself with horns, so  she swathed her head with jewels and ribbons and pretended she was  wearing an elaborate head-dress.    Then she sent heralds through the land offering a huge reward to any one  who could cure her serving maid of some strange horns that had grown out  on her head. You see she thought if she could get hold of some one who  would cure the maid, then she could make him cure her, too.    Well, doctors and quacks and all sorts of people came and tried every  kind of remedy, but all in vain. The horns stayed firmly rooted.    A whole week went by and when the last of the quacks had come and gone,  Danilo, disguised as an old physician, presented himself and craved  audience with the Peerless one. He carried two small jars in his hands  one of which was filled with a conserve made from the white grapes and  the other with a conserve made from the red grapes.    Peerless Beauty, her horns swathed in silk and gleaming with jewels,  received him coldly.    \"Are you one more quack?\" she asked.    \"Not a quack,\" he said, bowing low, \"but a man who has happened upon a  strange secret of nature. I can cure your serving maid of her horns  provided she confess to me all her misdeeds and hand over to me anything  she has that does not belong to her.\"    Peerless Beauty had him shown to the room where the serving maid lay in  bed. The poor frightened girl at once confessed that she had stolen a  few of her mistress's grapes and eaten them. Danilo spoke kindly to her,  gave her some of the white grape conserve, and as soon as she had tasted  it the horns of course dropped off.    Thereupon Peerless Beauty led Danilo to her own chamber, ordered all her  people out, and then acknowledged that she, too, was suffering from  horns.    \"I am sure I can cure you,\" Danilo told her, \"provided you confess to me  all your misdeeds and hand over to me whatever you have that belongs to  some one else.\"    \"I cheated a foolish young man out "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19714"],[0,"With Frederick the Great: A Story of the Seven Years' War (#5)"],[1,"of war, and so  puzzled because no one could mak' out what it was about, that they  did more gossiping than marketing. So when the time came for the  market to close, I got half a young pig at less than I should hae  paid for a joint, as the woman did not want to carry it home  again.\"    \"That is lucky. As you are from Perth, Donald, it is possible you  may know this gentleman. He is Mr. Fergus Drummond, of Tarbet.\"    \"I kenned his father weel; aye, and was close beside him at  Culloden, for when our company was broken I joined one that was  making a stand, close by, and it was Drummond who was leading it.  Stoutly did we fight, and to the end stood back to back, hewing  with our claymores at their muskets.    \"At last I fell, wounded, I couldna say where at the time. When I  came to myself and, finding that all was quiet, sat up and felt  myself over, I found that it was a musket bullet that had ploughed  along the top of my head, and would ha' killed me had it not been  that my skull was, as my father had often said when I was a boy,  thicker than ordinary. There were dead men lying all about me; but  it was a dark night, and as there was no time to be lost if I was  to save my skin, I crawled away to some distance from the field;  and then took to my heels, and did not stop till next morning, when  I was far away among the hills.\"    While he was talking, Donald had been occupied in adding a second  plate and knife and fork and glass, and the two officers sat down  to their meal. Fergus asked the soldier other questions as to the  fight in which his father had lost his life; for beyond that he had  fought to the last with his face to the foe, the lad had never  learnt any particulars, for of the clansmen who had accompanied his  father not one had ever returned.    \"Mr. Drummond will take the empty room next to mine, Donald. I am  going down now with him, to the inn where he has left his horse. As  he has a few things there, you had best come with us and bring them  here.\"    The landlord of the inn, on hearing that Fergus wished to sell his  horse, said that there were two travellers in the house who had  asked him about horses; as both had sold, to officers, fine animals  they had brought in from the country, there being at present a  great demand for horses of that class. One of these persons came in  as they were speaking, and after a little bargaining Fergus sold  the horse to him, at a small advance on the price he had given for  it at Stettin. The landlord himself bought the saddle and bridle,  for a few marks; saying that he could, at any time, find a customer  for such matters. Donald took the valises and cloak, and carried  them back to the palace.    \"That matter is all comfortably settled,\" Lindsay said. \"Now we are  free men, but my liberty won't last long. I shall have to go on  duty again, in half an hour. But at any rate, there is time to go  first with you to the tailor's, and put your uniform in hand.\"    \"I wish to be measured for the uniform of the 3rd Royal Dragoon  Guards,\" Fergus said, as he entered the shop and the proprietor  came up to him.    \"Yes, Herr Tautz; and his excellency, Marshal Keith,\" Lindsay put  in, \"wishes you to know that the dress suit must be made instantly,  or quicker if possible; for his majesty may, at any moment, order  Mr. Drummond to attend upon him. Mr. Drummond is appointed one of  the marshal's aides-de-camp; and as, therefore, he will often come  under the king's eye, you may well believe that the fit must be of  the best, or you are likely to hear of it, as well as Mr.  Drummond.\"    \"I will put it in hand at once, lieutenant. It shall be cut out  without delay; and in three hours, if Mr. Drummond will call here,  it shall be tacked together in readiness for the first trying on.  By eight o'clock tomorrow morning it shall be ready to be properly  fitted, and unless my men have bungled, which they very seldom do,  it shall be delivered by midday.\"    \"Mr. Drummond lodges in the next room to myself,\" the lieutenant  said; \"and my servant is looking after him, till he gets one of his  own, so you can leave it with him.\"    While the conversation was going on, two of the assistants were  measuring Fergus.    \"Will you have the uniform complete, with belts, helmet, and all  equipments?\"    \"Everything except the sword,\" Fergus said.    \"At least I suppose, Lindsay, we can carry our own swords.\"    \"Yes, the king has made that concession, which is a wonderful one,  for him, that Scottish officers in his service may carry their own  swords. You see, ours are longer and straighter than the German  ones, and most of us have learnt our exercises with them, and  certainly we would not fight so well with others; besides, the iron  basket protects one's hand and wrist vastly better than the foreign  guard. The concession was first made only to generals, field  officers and aides-de-camp; but Keith persuaded the king, at last,  to grant it to all Scottish officers, pointing out that they were  able to do much better service with their own claymores, than with  weapons to which they were altogether unaccustomed; and that  Scottish men were accustomed to fight with the edge, and to strike  downright sweeping blows, whereas the swords here are fitted only  for the point, which, although doubtless superior in a duel, is far  less effective in a general melee.\"    \"I should certainly be sorry to give up my own sword,\" Fergus said.  \"It was one of my father's, and since the days when I was big  enough to begin to use it, I have always exercised myself with it;  though I, too, have learned to use the point a great deal, as I had  a German instructor, as well as several Scottish ones.\"    \"Except in a duel,\" Lindsay said, \"I should doubt if skill goes for  very much. I have never tried it myself, for I have never had the  luck to be in battle; but I fancy that in a cavalry charge strength  goes for more than skill, and the man who can strike quickly and  heavily will do more execution than one trained to all sorts of  nice points and feints. I grant that these are useful, when two men  are watching each other; but in the heat of a battle, when every  one is cutting and thrusting for his life, I cannot think that  there is any time for fooling about with your weapon.\"    They had by this time left the shop, and were strolling down the  streets.    \"Is there much duelling here?\"    \"It is strictly forbidden,\" Lindsay said, with a laugh; \"but I need  hardly say that there is a good deal of it. Of course, pains are  taken that these affairs do not come to his majesty's ears. Fever,  or a fall from a horse, account satisfactorily enough for the  absence of an officer from parade, and even his total disappearance  from the scene can be similarly explained. Should the affair come  to the king's ears, 'tis best to keep out of his way until it has  blown over.    \"Of course, with us it does not matter quite so much as with  Prussian officers. Frederick's is not the only service open to us.  Good swords are welcome either at the Russian or Austrian courts,  to say nothing of those of half a dozen minor principalities. At  all of these we are sure to find countrymen and friends, and if  England really enters upon the struggle--and it seems to me that if  there is a general row she can scarcely stand aloof--men who have  learned their drill and seen some service might be welcomed, even  if their fathers wielded their arms on the losing side, ten years  ago.    \"Of course, to a Prussian officer it would be practical ruin to be  dismissed from the army. This is so thoroughly well understood  that, in cases of duels, there is a sort of general conspiracy on  the part of all the officers and surgeons of a regiment to hush the  matter up. Still, if an officer is insulted--or thinks that he is  insulted, which is about the same thing--he fights, and takes the  consequences.    \"I am not altogether sorry that I am an aide-de-camp, and I think  that you can congratulate yourself on the same fact; for we are not  thrown, as is a regimental officer, into the company of Prussians,  and there is therefore far less risk of getting into a quarrel.    \"I have no doubt the marshal, himself, will give you a few lessons  shortly. He is considered to be one of the finest swordsmen in  Europe, and in many respects he is as young as I am, and as fond of  adventure. He gave me a few when I first came to him, but he said  that it was time thrown away, for that I must put myself in the  hands of some good maitre d'armes before he could teach me anything  that would be useful. I have been working hard with one since, and  know a good deal more about it than I did; but my teacher says that  I am too hot and impetuous to make a good swordsman, and that  though I should do well enough in a melee, I shall never be able to  stand up against a cool man, in a duel. Of course the marshal had  no idea of teaching me arms, but merely, as he said, of showing me  a few passes that might be useful to me, on occasion. In reality he  loves to keep up his sword play, and once or twice a week Van  Bruff, who is the best master in Berlin, comes in for half an  hour's practice with him, before breakfast.\"    After Lindsay had left him at the entrance to the palace, Fergus  wandered about the town for some hours, and then went to the  tailor's and had his uniform tried on. Merely run together though  it was, the coat fitted admirably.    \"You are an easy figure to fit, Herr Drummond,\" the tailor said.  \"There is no credit in putting together a coat for you. Your  breeches are a little too tight--you have a much more powerful leg  than is common--but that, however, is easily altered.    \"Here are a dozen pairs of high boots. I noticed the size of your  foot, and have no doubt that you will find some of these to fit  you.\"    This was indeed the case, and among a similar collection of  helmets, Fergus also had no difficulty"]]]
