A few venturesome ones kept to their purpose and started  on ahead, promising to meet the laggards at Lake Bennett with boats of  their own making in which to journey down the river and lakes to Dawson.    Their promises were never fulfilled.    While they, in company with hundreds of others as venturesome, trudged  heavily up the narrow trail, a roar as of an earthquake suddenly sounded  their death-knell. Swiftly down the mountain side above them tore the  terrible avalanche, a monster formation of ice, snow and rock, the  latter loosened and ground off the face of old Chilkoot by the rushing  force of the moving snowslide urged on by a mighty wind. In an instant's  time a hundred men and women were brushed, like flies from a ceiling,  off the face of the mountain into their death below, leaving a space  cleared of all to the bare earth where only a few seconds before had  stood the patient toilers on the trail.    Only one thing remained for the living to do, and that was to drop all  else and rescue, if possible, the dying and engulfed ones. This they  did. When the wind had died away the snow in the air cleared, and  hundreds of men threw themselves into the rescue work. Many were injured  but lived. Some were buried in snow but found their way to light again.  One man was entirely covered except one arm which he used energetically  to inform those above him of his whereabouts. He was taken out unharmed,  and lived to welcome the writer of this to Dawson, where he carted and  delivered her trunk faithfully.    But Carrie N. had remained at Sheep Camp and was safe. Then her  experience in nursing stood her in good stead; and while men brought the  dead to camp, she, with others, for hours performed the services which  made the bodies ready for burial. It was a heart-rending undertaking and  required a cool head and steady hand, both of which Carrie N. possessed.  Two men of her party thus lost their lives, and it was not until days  afterward that the last of the poor unfortunates were found. Nearly one  hundred lives were lost in this terrible disaster, but there were  undoubtedly those whose bodies were never found, and whose death still  remains a mystery.          CHAPTER IV.    THE RUSH.      Since the discovery of gold by George Carmack on Bonanza Creek in  September, 1896, the growth of this country has been phenomenal, more  especially so to the one who has visited and is familiar with Dawson and  the Klondyke mining section.    As to the entire yield of gold from the Klondyke Creeks, none can say  except approximately; for the ten per cent. royalty imposed by the  Canadian government has always met a phase of human nature which prompts  to concealment and dishonesty, so that a truthful estimate cannot be  made.    The Canadian Dominion government is very oppressive. Mining laws are  very arbitrary and strictly enforced. A person wishing to prospect for  gold must first procure a miner's license, paying ten dollars for it. If  anything is discovered, and he wishes to locate a claim, he visits the  recorder's office, states his business, and is told to call again. In  the meantime, men are sent to examine the locality and if anything of  value is found, the man wishing to record the claim is told that it is  already located. The officials seize it. The man has no way of  ascertaining if the land was properly located, and so has no redress. If  the claim is thought to be poor, he can locate it by the payment of a  fifteen dollar fee.    One half of all mining land is reserved for the crown, a quarter or more  is gobbled by corrupt officials, and a meagre share left for the daring  miners who, by braving hardship and death, develop the mines and open up  the country.    \"Any one going into the country has no right to cut wood for any  purpose, or to kill any game or catch any fish, without a license for  which a fee of ten dollars must be paid. With such a license it is  unlawful to sell a stick of wood for any purpose, or a pound of fish or  game.\" The law is strictly enforced. To do anything, one must have a  special permit, and for every such permit he must pay roundly.    The story is told of a miner in a hospital who was about to die. He  requested that the Governor be sent for. Being asked what he wanted with  the Governor, he replied: \"I haven't any permit, and if I should  undertake to die without a permit, I should get myself arrested.\"    It is a well-known fact that many claims on Eldorado, Hunker and Bonanza  Creeks have turned out hundreds of thousands of dollars. One pan of  gravel on Eldorado Creek yielded $2100. Frank Dinsmore on Bonanza Creek  took out ninety pounds of solid gold or $24,480 in a single day. On  Aleck McDonald's claim on Eldorado, one man shoveled in $20,000 in  twelve hours. McDonald, in two years, dug from the frozen ground  $2,207,893. Charley Anderson, on Eldorado, panned out $700 in three  hours. T. S. Lippy is said to have paid the Canadian government $65,000  in royalties for the year 1898 and Clarence Berry about the same.    On Skukum Gulch $30,000 were taken from two boxes of dirt. Frank  Phiscator of Michigan, after a few months' work, brought home $100,000  in gold, selling one-third of his claim interests for $1,333,000, or at  the rate of $5,000,000 for the whole.    When a man is compelled to pay one thousand dollars out of every ten  thousand he digs from the ground, he will boast little of large  \"clean-ups\"; and for this reason it is hard to estimate the real amount  of gold extracted from the Klondyke mines.    Captain James Kennedy, an old pioneer and conservative mining man,  estimates the output for the season of 1899 as $25,000,000, or fifty  tons of dust and nuggets.    The most commendable thing about the Canadian Government is their strict  enforcement of order. Stealing is an almost unheard of thing, and petty  thieving does not exist. Mounted police in their brown uniforms and  soldiers in their red coats are everywhere seen in and around Dawson,  and they practice methods, which, to the uninitiated, make them very  nearly omnipresent.    While walking down street in Dawson one morning about nine o'clock, I  passed a group of men all wearing sober faces. \"They're done for now,\"  said a rough miner, glancing in the direction of the Barracks, where a  black flag was fluttering at the top of a staff.    \"How so?\" asked another, just come up to the group.    \"Three men hung over there, an hour ago. They're goin' to bury 'em now,\"  and the speaker twitched his thumbs first toward the Barracks, then  farther east, where a rough stretch of ground lay unused. Here could be  seen policemen and soldiers, evidently in the midst of some performance  not on their daily routine.    A number of prisoners wearing the regulation garb of  convicts,--pantaloons of heavy mackinaw, one leg of yellow and the other  of black,--were carrying long, rough boxes, while others were digging  shallow graves.    Upon inquiry I found that what the miner had said was true. Three  prisoners, two of them Indian murderers, with another man notoriously  bad, had indeed been hung about eight o'clock that morning in the  barracks courtyard. In less than two hours afterward they were interred,  and in as many days they were forgotten.    By the middle of July, 1899, the steamers leaving Dawson on their way  down the Yukon to St. Michael and the new gold fields at Nome, were well  filled with those who were anxious to try their luck in Uncle Sam's  territory where they can breathe, dig, fish, hunt, or die without buying  a license.    By August the steamers coming from St. Michael brought such glowing  accounts of the Nome gold fields, that while few people came in, they  carried as many out as they could accommodate.    By September the rush down the Yukon was tremendous, and of the twelve  thousand people in Dawson many hundreds left for Nome.    When, after six weeks spent in curiously studying conditions and  things,--not to say people,--in the great mining camp, it was decided  that I should accompany my brother down the Yukon to Cape Nome, and so  \"out\" home to San Francisco, I felt a very distinct sense of  disappointment. The novelty of everything, the excitement which came  each day in some form or other, was as agreeable as the beautiful summer  weather with the long, quiet evenings only settling into darkness at  midnight.    In September came the frosts. Men living in tents moved their little  Yukon stoves inside, and brought fresh sawdust and shavings from the  mills for their beds. Others packed their few possessions into small  boats, hauled down their tents, whistled to their dogs, and rolling up  their sleeves, pulled laboriously up the swift little Klondyke to their  winter \"lays\" in the mines.    Hundreds were also leaving for the outside. Steamers, both large and  small, going to White Horse and Bennett, carried those who had  joyfully packed their bags and smilingly said good-bye; for they were  going home to the \"States.\" How we strained our eyes from our cabin  window or from the higher bank above, to see the people on the decks of  the out-going boats. How the name of each tug and even freight-carrier  became a familiar household word, and how many were the conjectures as  to whether \"she\" would get through to White Horse Rapids in the low  water before a freeze-up!    [Illustration: A KLONDYKE CLAIM.]    One day our own steamer came. She was a magnificently equipped river  boat called the \"Hannah,\" belonging to the Alaska Commercial Company,  and had cost one hundred thousand dollars. This was to be her last trip  for the season, and with us it was \"home now, or here all winter,\" and  we made ready to leave.

The quail has many children, and I will ask her for one of them.\"    The owl went to the quail and said, \"Will you let me have one of your  children to come and live with me?\"    \"Live with you? No,\" answered the quail. \"I would as soon let my child  live with the serpent. You are hidden in the tree all day long, and when  it is dark, you come down like a thief and catch little animals that are  fast asleep in their nests. You shall never have one of my children.\"    \"I _will_ have one,\" thought the owl.    She waited till the night had come. It was dark and gloomy, for the moon  was not to be seen, and not a star twinkled in the sky. Not a leaf  stirred, and not a ripple was on the pond. The owl crept up to the  quail's home as softly as she could. The young birds were chattering  together, and she listened to their talk.    \"My mother is gone a long time,\" said one. \"It is lonely, and I am  afraid.\"    \"What is there to be afraid of?\" asked another. \"You are a little  coward. Shut your eyes and go to sleep. See me! I am not afraid, if it  is dark and gloomy. Oh, oh!\" cried the boaster, for the owl had seized  him and was carrying him away from home and his little brothers.    When the mother quail came home, she asked, \"Where is your brother?\" The  little quails did not know. All they could say was that something had  seized him in the darkness and taken him away.    \"It crept up to the nest in the dark,\" said one.    \"And oh, mother, never, never go away from us again!\" cried another. \"Do  not leave us at home all alone.\"    \"But, my dear little ones,\" the mother said, \"how could you have any  food if I never went away from our home?\"    The mother quail was very sad, and she would have been still more  sorrowful if she had known what was happening to her little son far away  in the owl's nest. The cruel owl had pulled and pulled on the quail's  bill and legs, till they were so long that his mother would not have  known him.    One night the mole came to the quail and said, \"Your little son is in  the owl's nest.\"    \"How do you know?\" asked the quail.    \"I cannot see very well,\" answered the mole, \"but I heard him call, and  I know that he is there.\"    \"How shall I get him away from the owl?\" the quail asked the mole.    \"The owl crept up to your home in the dark,\" said the mole, \"but you  must go to her nest at sunrise when the light shines in her eyes and she  cannot see you.\"    At sunrise the quail crept up to the owl's nest and carried away her  dear little son to his old home. As the light grew brighter, she saw  what had happened to him. His bill and his legs were so long that he  did not look like her son.    \"He is not like our brother,\" said the other little quails.    \"That is because the cruel owl that carried him away has pulled his bill  and his legs,\" answered the mother sorrowfully. \"You must be very good  to him.\"    But the other little quails were not good to him. They laughed at him,  and the quail with the long bill and legs was never again merry and glad  with them. Before long he ran away and hid among the great reeds that  stand in the water and on the shores of the pond.    \"I will not be called quail,\" he said to himself, \"for quails never have  long bills and legs. I will have a new name, and it shall be snipe. I  like the sound of that name.\"    So it was that the bird whose name was once quail came to be called  snipe. His children live among the reeds of the pond, and they, too, are  called snipes.          WHY THE SERPENT SHEDS HIS SKIN.      The serpent is the grandfather of the owl, and once upon a time if the  owl needed help, she would say, \"My grandfather will come and help me,\"  but now he never comes to her. This story tells why.    When the owl carried away the little quail, she went to the serpent and  said, \"Grandfather, you will not tell the quail that I have her son,  will you?\"    \"No,\" answered the serpent, \"I will keep your secret. I will not whisper  it to any one.\" So when the mother quail asked all the animals, \"Can you  tell me who has carried away my little son?\" the serpent answered, \"I  have been sound asleep. How could I know?\"    After the quail had become a snipe and had gone to live in the marsh  among the reeds, the cruel owl looked everywhere for him, and at last  she saw him standing beside a great stone in the water.    She went to the serpent and said, \"Grandfather, will you do something  for me?\"    \"I will,\" hissed the serpent softly, \"What is it?\"    \"Only to take a drink of water,\" answered the owl. \"Come and drink all  the water in the marsh, and then I can catch the quail that I made into  a snipe.\"    The serpent drank and drank, but still there was water in the marsh.    \"Why do you not drink faster?\" cried the owl. \"I shall never get the  snipe.\"    The serpent drank till he could drink no more, and still the water stood  in the marsh. The owl could not see well by day, and the serpent could  not see above the reeds and rushes, so they did not know that the water  from the pond was coming into the marsh faster than the serpent could  drink it.    Still the serpent drank, and at last his skin burst.    \"Oh,\" he cried, \"my skin has burst. Help me to fasten it together.\"    \"My skin never bursts,\" said the owl. \"If you will drink the water from  the marsh, I will help you, but I will not fasten any skin together till  I get that snipe.\"    The serpent had done all that he could to help the owl, and now he was  angry. He was afraid, too, for he did not know what would happen to him,  and he lay on the ground trembling and quivering. It was not long before  his old skin fell off, and then he saw that under it was a beautiful new  one, all bright and shining. He sheds his old skin every year now, but  never again has he done anything to help the owl.    [Illustration]          WHY THE DOVE IS TIMID.      A spirit called the manito always watches over the Indians. He is glad  when they are brave, but if they are cowardly, he is angry.    One day when the manito was walking under the pine-trees, he heard a cry  of terror in the forest.    \"What is that?\" said he. \"Can it be that any of my Indian children are  afraid?\"    As he stood listening, an Indian boy came running from the thicket,  crying in fear.    \"What are you afraid of?\" asked the manito.    \"My mother told me to go into the forest with my bow and arrows and  shoot some animal for food,\" said the boy.    \"That is what all Indian boys must do,\" said the manito. \"Why do you not  do as she said?\"    \"Oh, the great bear is in the forest, and I am afraid of him!\"    \"Afraid of Hoots?\" asked the manito. \"An Indian boy must never be  afraid.\"    \"But Hoots will eat me, I know he will,\" cried the boy. \"Boo-hoo,  boo-hoo!\"    \"A boy must be brave,\" said the manito, \"and I will not have a coward  among my Indians. You are too timid ever to be a warrior, and so you  shall be a bird. Whenever Indian boys look at you, they will say, 'There  is the boy who was afraid of Hoots.'\"    The boy's cloak of deerskin fell off, and feathers came out all over his  body. His feet were no longer like a boy's feet, they were like the feet  of a bird. His bow and arrows fell upon the grass, for he had no longer  any hands with which to hold them. He tried to call to his mother, but  the only sound he could make was \"Hoo, hoo!\"    \"Now you are a dove,\" said the manito, \"and a dove you shall be as long  as you live. You shall always be known as the most timid of birds.\"    Again the dove that had once been a boy tried to call, but he only said,  \"Hoo, hoo!\"    \"That is the only sound you will ever make,\" said the manito, \"and when  the other boys hear it, they will say, 'Listen! He was afraid of Hoots,  the bear, and that is why he says Hoo, hoo!'\"          WHY THE PARROT REPEATS THE WORDS OF MEN.      In the olden times when the earth was young, all the birds knew the  language of men and could talk with them. Everybody liked the parrot,  because he always told things as they were, and they called him the bird  that tells the truth.    This bird that always told the truth lived with a man who was a thief,  and one night the man killed another man's ox and hid its flesh.    When the other man came to look for it in the morning, he asked the  thief, \"Have you seen my ox?\"    \"No, I have not seen it,\" said the man.    \"Is that the truth?\" the owner asked.    \"Yes, it is. I have not seen the ox,\" repeated the man.    \"Ask the parrot,\" said one of the villagers. \"He always tells the  truth.\"    \"O bird of truth,\" said they to the parrot, \"did this man kill an ox and  hide its flesh?\"    \"Yes, he did,\" answered the parrot.    The thief knew well that the villagers would punish him the next day, if  he could not make them think that the parrot did not always tell the  truth.    \"I have it,\" he said to himself at last. \"I know what I can do.\"    When night came he put a great jar over the parrot. Then he poured water  upon the jar and struck it many times with a tough piece of oak. This he  did half the night. Then he went to bed and was soon fast asleep.    In the morning the men came to punish him.    \"How do you know that I killed the ox?\" he asked.    \"Because the bird of truth says that you did,\" they answered.    \"The bird of truth!\" he cried. \"That parrot is no bird of truth. He will  not tell the truth even about what happened last night. Ask him if the  moon was shining.\"    \"Did the moon shine last night?\" the men asked.    \"No,\" answered the parrot. \"There was no moon, for the rain fell, and  there was a great storm in the heavens. I heard the thunder half the  night.\"    \"This bird has always told the truth before,\" said the villagers, \"but  there was no storm last night and the moon was bright. What shall we do"]]]
