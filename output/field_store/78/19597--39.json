In the whole realm of Nature there is nothing more wonderful than this  matter of protective colouration. Animals do not monopolise the art. It  extends through the whole world of living creatures. The fact that  individual animals have no voluntary control over their own colour is  eloquent testimony as to the existence of mysterious life forces and  racial evolutions which are still far beyond the grasp of man's  understanding. To see a tiny chameleon adapt his colouring to his  environment, be it red, green, or yellow, in the twinkling of an eye, is  to have seen an argument for God Himself.          II    ANIMAL MUSICIANS      _\"Nay, what is Nature's self,    But an endless strife towards    Music, euphony, rhyme?\"_      --WATSON.      The great thinkers of the age believe that the world is one marvellous  blending of innumerable and varied voices. This unison of sound forms  the great music of the spheres, which the poets and philosophers have  written so much about. Even from a purely scientific point of view,  there is no denying that this music exists. Aviators tell us that when  they listen from a distance to the myriads of noises and sounds that  arise over a great city, these are all apparently lost in a modulated  hum precisely like the vibrations of an immense tuning-fork, and  appearing as but a single tone. Thus the immense noise going from our  world is musically digested into one tone, and the aviator soaring above  the earth hears only the one sound--the music of the spheres.    The deep appreciation that animals have for music is becoming a  generally known fact among those who have studied them closely. Every  one must admit that there is much truth in the old saying that \"music  hath charms to soothe the savage breast.\" Music is composed of  vibrations, which act with great power upon the nervous system of men  and animals alike. Each is affected according to his particular physical  and mental development.    Professor Tarchanoff has made a careful study of the influence of music  upon men and animals. He has demonstrated, by means of a machine which  carefully registers the various activities of the hands and fingers,  that when the hands are so tired and fatigued that they cannot make any  marks except a straight line on the cylinder which registers the  movements, music will so stimulate the nerves as to cause all fatigue to  disappear. And as soon as the fingers again touch the cylinder, they  begin to draw lines of various kinds and heights, thus proving that the  music had rested the fingers and placed them under control. Various  kinds of music were used: that of a melancholy nature had precisely the  opposite effect to that of a lively, cheerful character; the nerves of  the hands could either be contracted or expanded according to the nature  of the music.    Like all real scientists, Professor Tarchanoff does not claim to give  any positive explanation of these facts. He believes, however, that the  voluntary muscles act in the same relation to the music as the  heart--that is, that cheerful, happy music affects the excito-motor  nerves, sets up a vibration in those nerves which produces cheer and  good feeling; while sad, morbid music plays along the depressant nerves  and produces sadness and depression.    In view of these facts, it is easy to see how animals, with their  nervous temperaments and ready response to outside stimuli, are greatly  influenced by various kinds of music. It is scientifically recognised  that music tends to increase the elimination of carbonic acid and  increases not only the consumption of oxygen, but even the activities of  the skin. There is no doubt that good music at meal time aids the  digestion.    [Illustration: _American Museum of Natural History, New York_    MONKEYS ARE THE MOST MUSICAL OF ALL ANIMALS. WHEN THEY CONGREGATE FOR  \"CONCERTS,\" AS SOME OF THE TRIBES DO, THE AIR IS FILLED WITH WEIRD  STRAINS OF MONKEY-MUSIC.]    [Illustration: CATS, UNLIKE DOGS, ARE VERY FOND OF MUSIC. AND IT HAS  BEEN PROVED THAT THEIR MUSIC-SENSE CAN BE DEVELOPED TO A REMARKABLE  DEGREE.]    Cats have a species of unbeautiful music all their own, generally  produced at late hours of the night on the house tops, garden walls, and  in the alleys of our dwellings. Miss Cat's songs are far too chromatic  to be appreciated by human ears; as a result her concertos and solos are  rarely spoken of by human critics. However, Nature does sometimes  produce a Tetrazzini, Alice Neilson, or Caruso, in the form of a cat,  which really delights in harmonious combinations of sound. I know, for  instance, of a cat called \"Nordica\" owned by Presson Miller, who  apparently takes the greatest delight in hearing good vocal and  instrumental music. Another well-educated musical cat belongs to a  friend who plays a guitar. This cat delights in touching the strings  with his dainty, soft paws, and springs with delight as the notes are  produced.    The _Animal World_ speaks of five musical cats, which were carried to  various parts of the world and exhibited as \"bell-ringers,\" and their  owner made a fortune out of their concerts. Five bells were suspended  from a hoop, which hung above the stage, and to each bell was attached a  small rope. At a given signal, each cat would seize a bell and give it a  pull. This was done with such perfect time and spirit that one might  well believe it was the work of human musicians and not of cats.    Cows are responsive to certain kinds of music. A funeral march makes  them sad, and ragtime so disturbs them that they give but little milk.  The newspapers claim that Charles W. Ward, who owns a ranch near Eureka,  California, says that the right kind of music will increase the  production of milk, and that he uses a phonograph in the dairy barn.    A friend, who has travelled much, tells the story of a musical cow. He,  in company with two other friends, was coming up a river in a small boat  singing. Just as they turned a bend, they saw a small brown cow,  suckling her calf, along with several other cows in a nearby pasture.  The cow seemed so fascinated with the music that she plunged into the  water and waded up to her head trying to reach the boat. As they rowed  along, she ran up and down the bank, cutting capers in a most  astonishing manner and lowing and bellowing in testimony of her delight  in the music. She would leap, skip, roll on the grass, paw up the earth,  like an angry bull, and chase off like a playful kitten, always with a  low plaintive bellow as a final farewell. These friends often rowed up  the river just to see if the musical cow was there, and she always  greeted them in the usual appreciative manner.    Lions and tigers are proverbially fond of music. Professional trainers  tell us that these animals, when tamed, will not do their stunts without  the accompaniment of music. The story is told of a group of tigers which  recently refused to perform, because the musicians, while the  performance was going on, went on a strike. At once when the music  ceased, the animals returned to their respective seats and no amount of  encouragement would induce them to continue their performance. No  amount of threats would induce them to work without music. The trainer  dared not punish them too severely, yet he feared that if they were not  forced to perform, they might continue to strike. But such was not the  case, for on the morrow when the musicians returned they acted as never  before.    Sheep, both tame and wild, are exceedingly fond of music, and the  shepherds of Scotland have used it with their sheep for ages. When the  shepherd plays upon his flute or bagpipe, they gather around him and  listen apparently with great satisfaction; when the music ceases, they  wander out to feed, and in the evening he leads them home by the single  strains of his flute.    Circus horses are not only fond of music, but are partial to certain  tunes, and demand that these be played while they are doing their turn.  If for any reason the band changes the tune during a performance, they  immediately refuse to go on with their stunts.    The original fountain of all music was based on the various voices and  sounds of animals--and each musical instrument was originally devised to  imitate these sounds. For all instruments--the bass drum, flute,  clarinet, trombone, trumpet, violin, and even pipe organ--an animal may  be mentioned that owns the fundamental tones in its voice, and which  man has imitated. Castanets, for example, were imitations of the  rattlesnakes; the first musical instruments of any savage tribe of men  are made so as to represent the voices of the chief animals of that  particular locality.    Every animal of the higher order, with the exception of a few mute dogs  that belong to very hot or cold climates, is possessed of some sort of  musical tone, expressive of pain or joy, and by means of which he can  express certain emotions. Darwin claimed that the voice of the gibbon,  while extremely loud, was very musical; and Waterhouse said that this  musician sang the scale with considerable accuracy, at least  sufficiently well for a trained violinist to accompany him.    Often when dogs hear music they howl, or attempt to sing. Some show a  decided preference for certain kinds of music, and actually try to  imitate it. Gross tells of a friend of his who had a dog with which he  often gave performances. The dog would accompany his master, when he  sang in falsetto, with howls that were unmistakably attempts at singing,  and which readily adapted themselves to the pitch of the tone. This was  a musical accomplishment of which he was very proud.    On a subject of which so little is known, there are, of course, diverse  opinions. Scheitlin believed that music is actually disagreeable to a  dog, but he says"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19855"],[0,"Louis' School Days: A Story for Boys (#5)"],[1,"that had given place to the desire  of assisting another.    Louis always seemed in a hurry, and never did any thing well. His mind  was unsettled, and, like every thing else belonging to him at present,  in a state of undesirable confusion.    There was one resource which Louis had which would have set all to  rights, but his weakness of disposition often prevented him from taking  advantage of even the short intervals for prayer allowed by the rules  of the school, and he was often urged at night into telling stories  till he dropped asleep, and hurried down by the morning bell, before  he could summon up courage to brave the remarks of his school-fellows  as to his being so very _religious_, &c., and sometimes did not feel  sorry that there was some cause to prevent these solemn and precious  duties. I need not say he was not happy. He enjoyed nothing thoroughly;  he felt he was not steadily in earnest. Every day he came with a  beating heart to his class, never certain that he could get through  a single lesson.    One morning he was endeavoring to stammer through a few lines of some  Greek play, and at last paused, unable to proceed.    \"Well, sir,\" said his master quietly,--\"as usual, I suppose--I shall  give you only a few days' longer trial, and then, if you cannot do  better, you must go down.\"    \"Who is that, Mr. Danby?\" said a voice behind Louis, that startled him,  and turning his blanched face round, he saw Dr. Wilkinson standing near.  \"Who is that, Mr. Danby?\" he repeated, in a deep stern voice.    \"Louis Mortimer, sir,\" replied Mr. Danby. \"Either he is totally unfit  for this class, or he is very idle; I can make nothing of him.\"    Dr. Wilkinson fixed his eyes searchingly on Louis, and replied, in a  tone of much displeasure:    \"If you have the same fault to find the next two days, send him into a  lower class. It is the most disgraceful idleness, Louis.\"    Louis' heart swelled with sorrow and shame as the doctor walked away.  He stood with downcast eyes and quivering lids, hardly able to restrain  his tears, until the class was dismissed, and he was desired to stay in  and learn his unsaid lesson.    Reginald followed his brother into the study, where Louis took his books  to learn more quietly than he could do in the school-room.    \"My dear Louis,\" he said, \"you must try; the doctor will be so displeased  if you go into a lower class; and just think what a disgrace it will be.\"    \"I know,\" said Louis, wiping his eyes: \"I can't tell how it is, every  thing seems to go wrong with me--I am not at all happy, and I am sure  I wish to please everybody.\"    \"A great deal too much, dear Louis,\" said Reginald. \"You are always  teaching everybody else, and you know you have scarcely any time  for yourself. You must tell them you _won't_ do it; I can't be always  at your elbow; I've quarrelled more with the boys than ever I did,  since you came, on your account.\"    \"Oh dear! I am sorry I came,\" sighed Louis, \"I do so long to be a little  quiet. Reginald, dear, I am so sorry I should give you any trouble. Oh,  I have lost all my happy thoughts, and I know every thing is sure to  go wrong.\"    Louis remained sadly silent for a few minutes, and then, raising his  tearful eyes to his brother, who was sitting with his chin on his hands,  watching him, he begged him to leave him, declaring he should not learn  any thing while Reginald was with him.    Thus urged, Reginald took his departure, though, with his customary  unselfish affection, he would rather have stayed and helped him.    When he was gone, Louis began slowly to turn over the leaves of his  Lexicon, in order to prepare his lesson. He had not been long thus  employed, when he was interrupted by the irruption of the greatest  dunce in the school, introduced to the reader in the former chapter  as Churchill, _alias_ Oars, a youth of fifteen, who had constant  recourse to Louis for information. He now laid his dog's-eared  Eutropius before Louis, and opened his business with his usual  \"Come now, tell us, Louis--help us a bit, Louis.\"    \"Indeed, Harry, it is impossible,\" said Louis sorrowfully. \"I have all  my own to do, and if I do not get done before dinner I shall go into the  third class--no one helps me, you know.\"    \"It won't take you a minute,\" said Churchill.    \"It does take much more. You know I was an hour last night writing your  theme; and, Churchill, I do not think it is right.\"    \"Oh stuff! who's been putting that nonsense into your head?\" replied  Churchill. \"It's all right and good, and like your own self, you're  such a good-natured fellow.\"    \"And a very foolish one, sometimes,\" said Louis. \"Can't you get somebody  else to show you?\"    \"Goodness gracious!\" cried Churchill, \"who do you think would do it  now? and no one does it so well as you. Come, I say--come now--that's  a good fellow,--now do.\"    \"But how is it that you want to learn your lesson now,\" asked Louis?  \"Won't the evening do?\"    \"No; Dr. Wilkinson has given me leave to go out with my uncle this  afternoon, if I learn this and say it to old Norton before I go; and  I am sure I shan't get it done if you don't help me.\"    \"I cannot,\" said poor Louis.    \"Now I know you're too good-natured to let me lose this afternoon's fun.  Come, you might have told me half.\"    And against his better judgment, Louis spent half an hour in hearing  this idle youth a lesson, which, with a little extra trouble he might  easily have mastered himself in three quarters of an hour.    \"Thank you, Louis, you're a capital fellow; I know it now, don't I?\"    \"I think so,\" replied Louis; \"and now you must not talk to me.\"    \"What are you doing?\" said Churchill, looking at his book; \"oh,  'Kenrick's Greek Exercises.' If I can't tell you, I can help you  to something that will. Here's a key.\" As he spoke, he took down  the identical book taken from Harrison on the day of Louis' arrival,  and threw it on the table before him.    \"Is that a key?\" asked Louis, opening the book; \"put it back, Harry,  I cannot use it.\"    \"Why not?\"    \"It would not be right. Oh no! I will not, Churchill; put it up.\"    \"How precise you are!\" said Churchill; \"it's quite a common thing for  those who can get them--Thompson and Harcourt always use one.\"    \"Thompson ought to be ashamed of himself,\" cried Louis, \"to be trying  for a prize, and use a key.\"    \"Well, so he ought, but you won't get a prize if you begin now, and  try till breaking-up day; so you hurt nobody, and get yourself out of  a scrape. Don't be a donkey, Louis.\"    When Churchill left him alone Louis looked at the title-page, and  felt for an instant strongly tempted to avail himself of the assistance  of the book; but something checked him, and he laid his arms suddenly  on the table, and buried his face on them. A heavy hand laid on his  shoulder roused him from this attitude; and looking up, with his eyes  full of tears, he found Hamilton and Trevannion standing beside him.    \"What's the matter, Louis?\" said the former.    \"I have so much to do;--I--I've been very careless and idle,\"  stammered Louis.    \"I can readily believe that,\" said Hamilton.    \"A candid confession, at any rate,\" remarked Trevannion.    \"And do you imagine that your brains will be edified by coming in  contact with these books?\" asked Hamilton. \"What have you to do?\"    \"I have this exercise to re-write, and my Greek to  learn,--and--and--twenty lines of Homer to write out.  I can't do all now--I shall have to stay in this afternoon.\"    \"I should think that more than probable,\" said Trevannion.    \"What have we here?\" said Hamilton, taking up the key. \"Hey! what!  Louis! Is this the way you are going to cheat your masters?\"    \"Pray don't think it?\" said Louis, eagerly.    \"If you use keys, I have done with you.\"    \"Indeed I did not,--I never do,--I wasn't going. One of the boys left it  here. I am sure I did not mean to do so,\" cried Louis in great confusion.    \"Put it back,\" said Hamilton, gravely, \"and then I will go over your  lessons with you, and see if I can make you understand them better.\"    \"Thank you, thank you,--how kind you are!\" said poor Louis, who hastily  put the dangerous book away, and then sat down.    Hamilton smiled, and remarked, \"It is but fair that one should be  assisted who loses his character in playing knight errant for all  those who need, or fancy they need, his good services: but, Louis,  you are very wrong to give up so much of your time to others; your  time does not belong to yourself; your father did not send you here  to assist Dr. Wilkinson--or, rather, I should say, to save a set of  idle boys the trouble of doing their own work. There is a vast  difference between weakness and good-nature; but now to business.\"    Trevannion withdrew with a book to the window, and Hamilton sat down by  Louis, and took great pains to make him give his mind to his business;  and so thoroughly did he succeed with his docile pupil, that, although  he had come in rather late, all, with the exception of the imposition,  was ready for Mr. Danby by the time the dinner-bell rang.    Louis overwhelmed Hamilton with the expression of his gratitude, and  again and again laid his little hand on that of his self-instituted  tutor. Hamilton did not withdraw his hand, though he never returned  the pressure, nor made any reply to Louis' thanks, further than an  abrupt admonition from time to time to \"mind what he was about,\"  and to \"go on.\"    Several inquiries were made at the open window after Louis, but all were  answered by Trevannion, and our hero was left undisturbed to his studies.    That evening Louis had the satisfaction of being seated near his friend  Hamilton, who, with a good-natured air of authority, kept him steadily  at work until his business was properly concluded. Unhappily for Louis,  Hamilton was not unfrequently with the doctor in the evenings, or he  might generally have relied on his protection and assistance:"]]]
