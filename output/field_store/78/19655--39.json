[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20781"],[0,"Heidi (#5)"],[1,"n, Heidi, and fetch your bowl  and the bread.\"    Heidi obeyed and returned instantly. The grandfather milked a full  bowl from the white goat, cut a piece of bread for the child, and told  her to eat. \"Afterwards you can go to bed. If you need some shirts and  other linen, you will find them in the bottom of the cupboard. Aunt  Deta has left a bundle for you. Now good-night, I have to look after  the goats and lock them up for the night.\"    \"Good-night, grandfather! Oh, please tell me what their names are,\"  called Heidi after him.    \"The white one's name is Schwaenli and the brown one I call Baerli,\" was  his answer.    \"Good-night, Schwaenli! Good-night, Baerli,\" the little girl called  loudly, for they were just disappearing in the shed. Heidi now sat  down on the bench and took her supper. The strong wind nearly blew her  from her seat, so she hurried with her meal, to be able to go inside  and up to her bed. She slept in it as well as a prince on his royal  couch.    Very soon after Heidi had gone up, before it was quite dark, the old  man also sought his bed. He was always up in the morning with the sun,  which rose early over the mountain-side in those summer days. It was a  wild, stormy night; the hut was shaking in the gusts and all the  boards were creaking. The wind howled through the chimney and the old  fir-trees shook so strongly that many a dry branch came crashing down.  In the middle of the night the grandfather got up, saying to himself:  \"I am sure she is afraid.\" Climbing up the ladder, he went up to  Heidi's bed. The first moment everything lay in darkness, when all of  a sudden the moon came out behind the clouds and sent his brilliant  light across Heidi's bed. Her cheeks were burning red and she lay  peacefully on her round and chubby arms. She must have had a happy  dream, for she was smiling in her sleep. The grandfather stood and  watched her till a cloud flew over the moon and left everything in  total darkness. Then he went down to seek his bed again.          III    ON THE PASTURE      Heidi was awakened early next morning by a loud whistle. Opening her  eyes, she saw her little bed and the hay beside her bathed in golden  sunlight. For a short while she did not know where she was, but when  she heard her grandfather's deep voice outside, she recollected  everything. She remembered how she had come up the mountain the day  before and left old Ursula, who was always shivering with cold and sat  near the stove all day. While Heidi lived with Ursula, she had always  been obliged to keep in the house, where the old woman could see her.  Being deaf, Ursula was afraid to let Heidi go outdoors, and the child  had often fretted in the narrow room and had longed to run outside.  She was therefore delighted to find herself in her new home and hardly  could wait to see the goats again. Jumping out of bed, she put on her  few things and in a short time went down the ladder and ran outside.  Peter was already there with his flock, waiting for Schwaenli and  Baerli, whom the grandfather was just bringing to join the other goats.    \"Do you want to go with him to the pasture?\" asked the grandfather.    \"Yes,\" cried Heidi, clapping her hands.    \"Go now, and wash yourself first, for the sun will laugh at you if he  sees how dirty you are. Everything is ready there for you,\" he added,  pointing to a large tub of water that stood in the sun. Heidi did as  she was told, and washed and rubbed herself till her cheeks were  glowing. In the meanwhile the grandfather called to Peter to come into  the hut and bring his bag along. The boy followed the old man, who  commanded him to open the bag in which he carried his scanty dinner.  The grandfather put into the bag a piece of bread and a slice of  cheese, that were easily twice as large as those the boy had in the  bag himself.    \"The little bowl goes in, too,\" said the Uncle, \"for the child does  not know how to drink straight from the goat, the way you do. She is  going to stay with you all day, therefore milk two bowls full for her  dinner. Look out that she does not fall over the rocks! Do you hear?\"    Just then Heidi came running in. \"Grandfather, can the sun still laugh  at me?\" she asked. The child had rubbed herself so violently with the  coarse towel which the grandfather had put beside the tub that her  face, neck and arms were as red as a lobster. With a smile the  grandfather said: \"No, he can't laugh any more now; but when you come  home to-night you must go into the tub like a fish. When one goes  about like the goats, one gets dirty feet. Be off!\"    They started merrily up the Alp. A cloudless, deep-blue sky looked  down on them, for the wind had driven away every little cloud in the  night. The fresh green mountain-side was bathed in brilliant sunlight,  and many blue and yellow flowers had opened. Heidi was wild with joy  and ran from side to side. In one place she saw big patches of fine  red primroses, on another spot blue gentians sparkled in the grass,  and everywhere the golden rock-roses were nodding to her. In her  transport at finding such treasures, Heidi even forgot Peter and his  goats. She ran far ahead of him and then strayed away off to one side,  for the sparkling flowers tempted her here and there. Picking whole  bunches of them to take home with her, she put them all into her  little apron.    Peter, whose round eyes could only move about slowly, had a hard time  looking out for her. The goats were even worse, and only by shouting  and whistling, especially by swinging his rod, could he drive them  together.    \"Heidi, where are you now?\" he called quite angrily.    \"Here,\" it sounded from somewhere. Peter could not see her, for she  was sitting on the ground behind a little mound, which was covered  with fragrant flowers. The whole air was filled with their perfume,  and the child drew it in, in long breaths.    \"Follow me now!\" Peter called out. \"The grandfather has told me to  look out for you, and you must not fall over the rocks.\"    \"Where are they?\" asked Heidi without even stirring.    \"Way up there, and we have still far to go. If you come quickly, we  may see the eagle there and hear him shriek.\"    That tempted Heidi, and she came running to Peter, with her apron full  of flowers.    \"You have enough now,\" he declared. \"If you pick them all to-day,  there won't be any left to-morrow.\" Heidi admitted that, besides which  she had her apron already full. From now on she stayed at Peter's  side. The goats, scenting the pungent herbs, also hurried up without  delay.    Peter generally took his quarters for the day at the foot of a high  cliff, which seemed to reach far up into the sky. Overhanging rocks on  one side made it dangerous, so that the grandfather was wise to warn  Peter.    After they had reached their destination, the boy took off his bag,  putting it in a little hollow in the ground. The wind often blew in  violent gusts up there, and Peter did not want to lose his precious  load. Then he lay down in the sunny grass, for he was very tired.    Heidi, taking off her apron, rolled it tightly together and put it  beside Peter's bag. Then, sitting down beside the boy, she looked  about her. Far down she saw the glistening valley; a large field of  snow rose high in front of her. Heidi sat a long time without  stirring, with Peter asleep by her side and the goats climbing about  between the bushes. A light breeze fanned her cheek and those big  mountains about her made her feel happy as never before. She looked up  at the mountain-tops till they all seemed to have faces, and soon they  were familiar to her, like old friends. Suddenly she heard a loud,  sharp scream, and looking up she beheld the largest bird she had ever  seen, flying above her. With outspread wings he flew in large circles  over Heidi's head.    \"Wake up, Peter!\" Heidi called. \"Look up, Peter, and see the eagle  there!\"    Peter got wide wake, and then they both watched the bird breathlessly.  It rose higher and higher into the azure, till it disappeared at last  behind the mountain-peak.    \"Where has it gone?\" Heidi asked.    \"Home to its nest,\" was Peter's answer.    \"Oh, does it really live way up there? How wonderful that must be! But  tell me why it screams so loud?\" Heidi inquired.    \"Because it has to,\" Peter replied.    \"Oh, let's climb up there and see its nest!\" implored Heidi, but  Peter, expressing decided disapproval in his voice, answered: \"Oh  dear, Oh dear, not even goats could climb up there! Grandfather has  told me not to let you fall down the rocks, so we can't go!\"    Peter now began to call loudly and to whistle, and soon all the goats  were assembled on the green field. Heidi ran into their midst, for she  loved to see them leaping and playing about.    Peter in the meantime was preparing dinner for Heidi and himself, by  putting her large pieces on one side and his own small ones on the  other. Then he milked Baerli and put the full bowl in the middle. When  he was ready, he called to the little girl. But it took some time  before she obeyed his call.       [Illustration: SHE HANDED HIM ALSO THE WHOLE SLICE OF CHEESE]    \"Stop jumping, now,\" said Peter, \"and sit down; your dinner is ready.\"    \"Is this milk for me?\" she inquired.    \"Yes it is; those large pieces also belong to you. When you are  through with the milk, I'll get you some more. After that I'll get  mine.\"    \"What milk do you get?\" Heidi inquired.    \"I get it from my own goat, that speckled one over there. But go ahead  and eat!\" Peter commanded again. Heidi obeyed, and when the bowl was  empty, he filled it again. Breaking off a piece of bread for herself,  she gave Peter the rest, which was still bigger than his own portion  had been. She handed him also the whole slice of cheese, saying: \"You  can eat that, I have had enough!\"    Peter was speechless with surprise, for it would have been impossible  for him ever to give up any of his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20785"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#5)"],[1,"cullud woman leave, and he gave her a swell home  right there on the place, and she is still there I guess.

Most of the folks have themselves a regular birthday but this old  colored man just pick out any of the days during the year--one day  just about as good as another.    I been around a long time but I don't know when I got here. That's the  truth. Nearest I figures it the year was 1850--the month don't make no  difference nohow.    But I know the borning was down in Taloga County, Alabama, near the  county seat town. Miss Abby was with my Mammy that day. She was the  wife of Master John Brown. She was with all the slave women every time  a baby was born, or when a plague of misery hit the folks she knew  what to do and what kind of medicine to chase off the aches and pains.  God bless her! She sure loved us Negroes.    Most of the time there was more'n three hundred slaves on the  plantation. The oldest ones come right from Africa. My Grandmother was  one of them. A savage in Africa--a slave in America. Mammy told it to  me. Over there all the natives dressed naked and lived on fruits and  nuts. Never see many white mens.    One day a big ship stopped off the shore and the natives hid in the  brush along the beach. Grandmother was there. The ship men sent a  little boat to the shore and scattered bright things and trinkets on  the beach. The natives were curious. Grandmother said everybody made a  rush for them things soon as the boat left. The trinkets was fewer  than the peoples. Next day the white folks scatter some more. There  was another scramble. The natives was feeling less scared, and the  next day some of them walked up the gangplank to get things off the  plank and off the deck.    The deck was covered with things like they'd found on the beach.  Two-three hundred natives on the ship when they feel it move. They  rush to the side but the plank was gone. Just dropped in the water  when the ship moved away.    Folks on the beach started to crying and shouting. The ones on the  boat was wild with fear. Grandmother was one of them who got fooled,  and she say the last thing seen of that place was the natives running  up and down the beach waving their arms and shouting like they was  mad. The boat men come up from below where they had been hiding and  drive the slaves down in the bottom and keep them quiet with the whips  and clubs.    The slaves was landed at Charleston. The town folks was mighty mad  'cause the blacks was driven through the streets without any clothes,  and drove off the boat men after the slaves was sold on the market.  Most of that load was sold to the Brown plantation in Alabama.  Grandmother was one of the bunch.    The Browns taught them to work. Made clothes for them. For a long time  the natives didn't like the clothes and try to shake them off. There  was three Brown boys--John, Charley and Henry. Nephews of old Lady  Hyatt who was the real owner of the plantation, but the boys run the  place. The old lady she lived in the town. Come out in the spring and  fall to see how is the plantation doing.    She was a fine woman. The Brown boys and their wives was just as good.  Wouldn't let nobody mistreat the slaves. Whippings was few and nobody  get the whip 'less he need it bad. They teach the young ones how to  read and write; say it was good for the Negroes to know about such  things.    Sunday was a great day around the plantation. The fields was  forgotten, the light chores was hurried through and everybody got  ready for the church meeting.    It was out of the doors, in the yard fronting the big log where the  Browns all lived. Master John's wife would start the meeting with a  prayer and then would come the singing. The old timey songs.    The white folks on the next plantation would lick their slaves for  trying to do like we did. No praying there, and no singing.    The Master gave out the week's supply on Saturday. Plenty of hams,  lean bacon, flour, corn meal, coffee and more'n enough for the week.  Nobody go hungry on that place! During the growing season all the  slaves have a garden spot all their own. Three thousand acres on that  place--plenty of room for gardens and field crops.    Even during the war foods was plentiful. One time the Yankee soldiers  visit the place. The white folks gone and I talks with them. Asks me  lots of questions--got any meats--got any potatoes--got any this--some  of that--but I just shake my head and they don't look around.    The old cook fixes them up though. She fry all the eggs on the place,  skillet the ham and pan the biscuits! Them soldiers fill up and leave  the house friendly as anybody I ever see!    The Browns wasn't bothered with the Ku Klux Klan either. The Negroes  minded their own business just like before they was free.    I stayed on the plantation 'til the last Brown die. Then I come to  Oklahoma and works on the railroad 'til I was too old to hustle the  grips and packages. Now I just sits thinking how much better off would  I be on the old plantation.    Homesick! Just homesick for that Alabama farm like it was in them good  old times!          Oklahoma Writers' Project  Ex-Slaves    SALLIE CARDER  Age 83 yrs.  Burwin, Okla.      I was born in Jackson, Tennessee, and I'm going on 83 years. My mother  was Harriett Neel and father Jeff Bills, both of them named after  their masters. I has one brother, J. B. Bills, but all de rest of my  brothers and sisters is dead.    No sir, we never had no money while I was a slave. We jest didn't have  nothing a-tall! We ate greens, corn bread, and ash cake. De only time  I ever got a biscuit would be when a misdemeanor was did, and my  Mistress would give a buttered biscuit to de one who could tell her  who done it.    In hot weather and cold weather dere was no difference as to what we  wore. We wore dresses my mother wove for us and no shoes a-tall. I  never wore any shoes till I was grown and den dey was old brogans wid  only two holes to lace, one on each side. During my wedding I wore a  blue calico dress, a man's shirt tail as a head rag, and a pair of  brogan shoes.    My Master lived in a three-story frame house painted white. My  Mistress was very mean. Sometimes she would make de overseer whip  negroes for looking too hard at her when she was talking to dem. Dey  had four children, three girls and one boy.    I was a servant to my Master, and as he had de palsy I had to care for  him, feed him and push him around. I don't know how many slaves, but  he had a good deal of 'em.    About four o' clock mornings de overseer or negro carriage driver who  stayed at the Big House would ring de bell to git up and git to work.  De slaves would pick a heap of cotton and work till late on  moonshining nights.    Dere was a white post in front of my door with ropes to tie the slaves  to whip dem. Dey used a plain strap, another one with holes in it, and  one dey call de cat wid nine tails which was a number of straps plated  and de ends unplated. Dey would whip de slaves wid a wide strap wid  holes in it and de holes would make blisters. Den dey would take de  cat wid nine tails and burst de blisters and den rub de sores wid  turpentine and red pepper.    I never saw any slaves auctioned off but I seen dem pass our house  chained together on de way to be sold, including both men and women  wid babies all chained to each other. Dere was no churches for slaves,  but at nights dey would slip off and git in ditches and sing and pray,  and when dey would sometimes be caught at it dey would be whipped.  Some of de slaves would turn down big pots and put dere heads in dem  and pray. My Mistress would tell me to be a good obedient slave and I  would go to heaven. When slaves would attempt to run off dey would  catch dem and chain dem and fetch 'em back and whip dem before dey was  turned loose again.    De patrollers would go about in de quarters at nights to see if any of  de slaves was out or slipped off. As we sleep on de dirt floors on  pallets, de patrollers would walk all over and on us and if we even  grunt dey would whip us. De only trouble between de whites and blacks  on our plantation was when de overseer tied my mother to whip her and  my father untied her and de overseer shot and killed him.    Negroes never was allowed to git sick, and when dey would look  somewhat sick, de overseer would give dem some blue-mass pills and oil  of some sort and make dem continue to work.    During de War de Yankees would pass through and kill up de chickens,  and hogs, and cattle, and eat up all dey could find. De day of freedom  de overseer went into de field and told de slaves dat dey was free,  and de slaves replied, \"free how?\" and he told dem: \"free to work and  live for demselves.\" And dey said dey didn't know what to do, and so  some of dem stayed on. I married Josh Forch. I am mother of four  children and 35 grand children.    I like Abraham Lincoln. I think he was a good man and president. I  didn't know much who Jeff Davis was. What I heard 'bout Booker T.  Washington, he was a good man.    Now dat slavery is over, I don't want to be in nary 'nother slavery,  and if ever nary 'nothern come up I wouldn't stay here.
