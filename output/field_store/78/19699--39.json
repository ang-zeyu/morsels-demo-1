These five ladies filled the front row of chairs on one  side, as did the gentlemen accompanying them on the other side. Eight  other ladies, all in full dress,--one wearing an ermine  cape,--followed, each with a gentleman; and these were seated in the  second row.    When for a few brief moments I first caught sight of all this  elegance, I felt as though I were in a dream; then came a rush of  emotion, because I loved the fair young bride, and was touched at the  thought of the solemn place in which she stood,--forsaking home and  friends and native land to go to what seems to these home-dwelling  Germans a far, strange country, all for the sake of a young man whom a  year ago she had never seen. I was as sorry for the mother, too, as I  could be for one so handsome and so dignified. How fast one feels and  thinks in such a time! Before the hush which followed the procession  and the temporary change while all were finding their appropriate  seats, the feeling of sympathy had given place to one of stimulated  imagination, and this dim old soldiers' church, with the majestic  music filling all its spaces, seemed merely the setting for some scene  at a royal court in the olden time, where beauty and brilliance and  grandeur were a matter of course.    The music ceased, all present rose, while Pastor Frommel read a brief  service from the book, and said \"Amen.\" Then we sat down again, and  the pastor preached the wedding sermon, which we were told is a matter  of course at a German marriage. The sermon over, the bride and groom  stood up before him, and he looked down with a fatherly glance upon  the bride whom he took into his own house to prepare for confirmation  only a few short years ago, and whom he is now to send with his  marriage benediction across the sea. In a sweet, calm voice he  addressed them; then the bride hands her bouquet to her sister  bridesmaid sitting near, and removes her own glove; the groom takes  from his pocket a ring, and gives it to the minister, who places it on  the bride's finger, speaking a few solemn sentences, of which only the  last reaches my ears: \"What God hath joined together, let not man put  asunder.\" For the first time in the service, the bride and groom kneel  before him who bends over them; then follows a prayer, and it is  finished. They rise, and are seated an instant; then rise again as the  pastor gives his hand in congratulation to the groom; and when he  places his hand with a few words in that of the bride, she bends low  over it and kisses it in a pathetic farewell. The pastor goes first.  The bride and groom bow in silent devotion before the altar until the  time seems a little long, then turn and come down the aisle, followed  by their retinue as they went in, but twain no more. The mother wiped  away a tear quietly once or twice during the service, the unmarried  sister bridesmaid looked as sweet and calm as always she does at home,  but the bride, silently taking farewell of friends and native land,  was deeply moved. No one had any voice for the printed hymn, and the  organ alone supplied its music. The newly married couple went in the  first carriage which rolled homewards, the others followed without  observing precedence, and a small and quiet home reception closed the  day.    In a family where we found a home we were once asked, with other  temporary residents, to attend a small evening gathering. At the usual  hour of half-past eight we were led out to supper by the hostess. The  table was very handsome with its fine linen and an elaborately  embroidered lunch cloth extending through the whole length of a board  at which fourteen were seated. I counted ten tall wine bottles, and at  every plate except two, wine-glasses were standing. Several of the  European ladies drank off three or four glasses as they might have  done so much water. \"You are temperance?\" said a young lady from  Stockholm at my left, in her broken English. I said, Yes; and on  inquiry found she knew something of the great temperance movement in  her own country, of which she told me over her wine. She said she  thought a glass would do me good. I said, \"No, it would flush my face  and do me harm;\" to which, without any intention of discourtesy, she  replied simply, \"I do not believe it.\" Five plates of various sizes  were piled before each individual. The smallest was of glass, for  preserved fruit and sweet pickles, four kinds of which were passed,  all to be deposited, if one partook of all, on the same plate. The  other plates and the whole service were of beautiful old Berlin china,  white, with a line of dark blue and another of gilt around the edge of  each piece, and the monogram of the grandmother to whom it originally  belonged in the centre of each piece in blue letters. The first course  was excellent chicken broth, served to each guest in a china cup, with  a roll. The second course was cold roast beef and hot potatoes, served  in three different ways, with rolls and plenty of wine. The third  course was offered to me first by a handsome serving-maid lately from  the country, with a clear face, bright dark eyes, dark hair, and rosy  cheeks. Admiring her, I cast only a brief and doubtful glance on the  large plate she bore, at one side of which were two lifelike sheep  three or four inches high, with little red ribbons around their necks  and standing in the midst of greenery. \"This is confectionery,\" I  thought, \"and these are sugar sheep for ornament.\" Disposed on other  parts of the plate were sundry rounds and triangles which looked  peculiar; but my custom was, at German tables, \"to prove all things\"  and \"hold fast that which is good.\" So I decided on a creamy-looking  segment, covered with silver-paper, and showing at the sides a  half-inch thickness of what I hoped was custard-cake. The plate was  next passed to a lady at my right, who cut a little piece off a white  substance; and I thought, \"She has ice-cream.\" Before I had touched my  portion, a suspicious odor diverted my attention from the  conversation. I found that the course was cheese and radishes, that my  neighbor had \"Dutch cheese,\" that the sheep were the butter and I had  none for my roll, and that I had possessed myself of perhaps the whole  of one variety of European cheese in tin-foil, the peculiar aroma of  which was anything but agreeable to my cheese-hating sense. I begged a  German Fraeulein who sat near and who was intensely enjoying the  situation to relieve me, when she kindly took about one third of my  delicacy, leaving the rest in solitary state until the end of that  course. Fortunately, the non-winedrinkers were offered a cup of tea  just here, and I ate my roll with it in thankfulness. My American  friend laughingly made a remark to her German neighbor,--a tall and  dignified lady, but very vivacious. She turned her head, saying in  hesitating English, \"Speak on this side; I am _dumb_ in that ear.\"  Meanwhile the conversation, not as at American tables a low hum, but  rather the rattle of artillery, fires away, across the table, along  its whole length, anywhere and everywhere, much sounding, little  meaning, amid infinite ado of demonstration and gesticulation. The  next course was the nearest approach to pie I saw at any German  table,--_apfeltochter_,--a browned and frosted crust, nearly eighteen  inches in diameter, between the parts of which was cooked and  sweetened apple.    I noted the different nationalities at the table,--the mother and her  daughters, Germans of the Germans; a buxom young girl from the  country, a fine singer; the tall German, and the young Swedish lady of  whom I have spoken; another Swedish lady from Gothenburg, tall, very  dignified, with gray eyes and dark hair, an exquisite singer. Then  there was Herr G----, also from Sweden, and Fraeulein von K----, a  young Polish lady, with striking black eyes and hair and a laughing  face. Other guests were two Norwegian gentlemen. One of them, tall,  dark, and with the dress and bearing of a gentleman, said to my  American friend, \"Yes, I speak English _very well_\" which we found to  be the case. As I had mentally completed this summary, my friend said  to me in a low \"aside,\" \"The young lady at your left is a  free-thinker, the Polish lady is a Roman Catholic, Herr G----is a Jew;  the rest Lutherans, except you and me.\" And one of us at home was of  \"Andover,\" and the other \"straight Orthodox\"!    Later, we adjourned to the drawing-room, spacious and handsome after  the German fashion. I asked one of the daughters of the house, who I  knew had spent some years in Russia, if the portrait of a middle-aged  gentleman hanging near me, much decorated and with a gilded crown at  the top of the frame, were not that of the late Czar (Alexander II.),  when she replied, \"It is our Emperor!\" And I had seen his Majesty at  least half a dozen times! But he was a much older man now. One of the  Norwegian gentlemen sat down at the piano and played portions of a  recent opera, and a game of questions and answers followed. Oranges  and little cakes were served before the company broke up at the early  hour of half-past eleven.    Concerts and even the opera and theatre begin early in Germany. Doors  are open usually about half-past five, and the performance seldom  begins later than six or seven. This interferes with the time of the  usual evening meal, so that refreshments at these places are always in  order. One of the most characteristic evenings maybe spent at the  Philharmonie, where the best music is given at popular prices several  times each week. Tickets seldom cost more than fifteen or eighteen  cents, and may be bought by the package for much less. This is a  favorite place with the music-loving Germans, and for many Americans  as well. Nearly all the German ladies take their knitting or  fancy-work. The large and fine hall is filled on these occasions with  chairs clustered around small tables"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21656"],[0,"The Princess of the School (#5)"],[1," assumed  by lawyers.    \"I wouldn't make too sure about that,\" he said slowly. \"I suppose you  know your Uncle Tristram left a child? No! Well, he did, at any rate. I  must hurry on now. I've an appointment to keep at my office. A happy New  Year to you all. Good-by!\"    And, starting his engine, he was off before they had time to reply.    \"What does he mean?\" asked Lilias, watching the retreating bicycle.  \"Uncle Tristram has been dead for thirteen years! We never seem to have  heard anything about him!\"    \"What was that photo we saw on the study table?\" queried Dulcie. \"Don't  you remember--the lady and the baby, and it had written on it: 'My wife  and Leslie, from Tristram.'\"    \"I suppose it was Uncle Tristram's wife and child,\" replied Everard  thoughtfully. \"He must have called the kid 'Leslie' after Grandfather.  They ought to have christened _me_ 'Leslie.' I can't think why they  didn't.\"    \"Have we a cousin Leslie, then, whom we don't know?\"    \"I suppose we must have, somewhere!\"    \"How fearfully thrilling!\"    \"Um! I don't know that it's thrilling at all. It's the first I've heard  of it until to-day. I wish our father had been the eldest son, instead  of Uncle Tristram!\"    \"Why? What does it matter?\"    \"It may matter more than you think. You're a silly little goose, Dulcie,  and, as I often tell you, you never see farther than the end of your own  nose. Surely, after all these years, though, Grandfather _must_----\"    \"Must what?\" asked Lilias curiously.    \"Never you mind! Girls can't know everything!\" snapped Everard, walking  on in front of his sisters with a look of unwonted worry upon his  usually careless and handsome young face.          CHAPTER III    A Valentine Party      Chilcombe Hall, where Lilias and Dulcie had been boarders for the last  two years, was an exceedingly nice school. It stood on a hill-side well  raised above the river, and behind it there was a little wood where  bulbs had been naturalized, and where, in their season, you might find  clumps of pure white snowdrops, sheets of glorious daffodils, and later  on lovely masses of the lily of the valley. In the garden all kinds of  sweet things seemed to be blooming the whole year round. Golden aconite  buds opened with the January term, and in a wild patch above the rockery  the delicious heliotrope-scented _Petasites fragrans_ blossomed to tempt  the bees which an hour's sunshine would bring forth from the hives,  scarlet _Pyrus japanica_ was trained along the wall under the front  windows, and early flowering cherry and almond blossoms made delicate  pink patches of color long before leaves were showing on the trees.    Beautiful surroundings in a school can be quite as important a part of  our education as the textbooks through which we toil. We are made up of  body, mind, and spirit, and the developing soul needs satisfying as much  as the physical or mental part of us. Long years afterwards, though we  utterly forget the lessons we may have learnt as children, we can still  vividly recall the effect of the afternoon sun streaming through the  fuchsia bush outside the open French window where we sat conning those  unremembered tasks. The lovely things of nature, assimilated half  unconsciously when we are young, equip us with a purity of heart and a  refinement of taste that should safeguard us later, and keep our  thoughts at a lofty level.    The \"beauty cult\" was a decided feature of Chilcombe Hall. Miss Walters  was extremely artistic; she painted well in water-colors and had  exquisite taste. Many of the charming decorations in the house had been  done by herself; she had designed and stencilled the frieze of drooping  clusters of wistaria that decorated the dining-hall wall; the framed  landscapes in the drawing-room were her own work, and she herself always  superintended the arrangement of the bowls of flowers that gave such  brightness to the schoolrooms.    Her twenty pupils had on the whole a decidedly pleasant time. There were  just enough of them to develop the community spirit, but not too many  to obliterate the individual, or, as Ida Spenser put it: \"You can get up  a play, or a dance, or any other sort of fun, and yet we all know each  other like a kind of big family.\"    \"Divided up into small families according to bedrooms!\" added Hester  Wilson.    The bedrooms at Chilcombe Hall were rather a speciality. They were  large, and were furnished partly as studies, and girls had their own  bookcases, knick-knacks, and pretty things there. As the house was  provided with central heating, they were warmed, and a certain amount of  preparation was done in them each afternoon. Miss Walters' artistic  faculty had decorated them in schemes of various colors, so that they  were known respectively as The Rose, The Gold, The Green, The Brown, and  The Blue Bedrooms. Lilias and Dulcie Ingleton, Gowan Barbour, and Bertha  Chesters, who occupied the last-named, considered it quite the choicest  of all. They had each made important contributions to its furniture, had  clubbed together to buy a Liberty table-cloth, had provided vases in  lovely shades of turquoise blue, and had worked toilet-mats, nightdress  cases and other accessories to accord with the prevailing tone. \"The  Blue Grotto,\" as they named their dormitory, certainly had points over  rival bedrooms, for it looked down the garden towards the river, and  had the best view of the sunset. Moreover, it was at the very end of the  corridor, so that sudden outbursts of laughter did not meet the ears of  Miss Hardy quite so easily as from the Rose or the Brown room.    The work of the spring term had been in full swing for nearly a month,  when Gowan Barbour, looking at the calendar--hand-painted, with blue  cranesbill geraniums--suddenly discovered that next morning would be the  festival of St. Valentine.    \"Could anything be better?\" she exulted. \"We've won the record for  tidiness three weeks running, so we're entitled to a special indulgence.  I vote we ask to bring tea up here, and have a Valentine party. Don't  you think it would be rather scrumptious? I've all sorts of ideas in my  head.\"    \"Topping!\" agreed Dulcie, pausing in the act of tying her hair ribbon to  consider the important question, \"specially if we could get Miss Walters  to let us send to Glazebrook for a few cakes. I believe she would, if we  wheedled!\"    \"What about visitors?\" asked Lilias. \"It would be much more of a party  if we had a few of the others in.\"    \"We don't want a crowd, or we might as well be in the dining-hall,\"  objected Bertha.    \"Well, of course we shouldn't ask the whole school, naturally, but  perhaps just Noreen and Phillida!\"    \"We must get at the soft spot in Miss Walters' heart,\" decided Gowan.  \"Pick a bunch of early violets if you can find them, lay them on her  study table, talk about flowers and nature for a little while, then ask  if we may have a quiet little party in our bedroom to-morrow afternoon,  with cakes at our own expense.\"    \"Quiet?\" queried Lilias.    \"Well, of course you couldn't call it rowdy, could you? We'll send you  to do the asking. Those dimples of yours generally get what you want,  and on the whole I think you're the pattern one of us, and the most  likely to be listened to.\"    Tea at Chilcombe Hall was a quite informal meal. It partook, indeed more  of the nature of a canteen. The urns were what the girls called \"on tap\"  from four to four-thirty, and during summer any one might take cup,  saucer, and plate into the garden, provided she duly brought them back  afterwards to the dining-hall. Special permission for a bedroom feast  was therefore not very difficult to obtain, and Lilias returned from her  interview in the study with her dimples conspicuously in evidence.    \"Well?\" asked the interested circle in the Blue bedroom.    \"Sweet as honey!\" reported Lilias. \"She said 'Certainly, my dear!' We  may each ask one friend, and we may spend two shillings amongst us on  cakes, if we give the money and the list of what we want to Jones this  afternoon, because he's going into Glazebrook first thing to-morrow  morning.\"    \"Only two shillings!\" commented Gowan.    \"It will go no way!\" pouted Bertha.    \"Well, I can't help it. Miss Walters said 'Two shillings' most  emphatically.\"    \"You might have stuck out for more! Those iced cakes are always half a  crown!\"    \"I didn't dare to stick out for anything. I was so afraid she'd change  her mind, and say 'There's good plain home-made cake with your  schoolroom tea, and you must be content with that,' like she did to Nona  and Muriel.\"    \"We could get twelve twopenny cakes for two shillings,\" calculated  Dulcie; \"but if there are eight of us, that's only one and a half  apiece.\"    \"Best get eight twopenny iced cakes, and eight penny buns,\" suggested  Bertha, taking pencil and paper to write the important order.    \"Right-o! Only be sure you put _pink_ iced cakes, they are so much the  nicest.\"    \"Whom shall we ask? It won't be much of a beano on two shillings. Still,  they'll be keen on coming, I expect.\"    Noreen, Phillida, Prissie, and Edith, the four finally selected  favorites, accepted the invitation with alacrity. Bedroom tea-parties  were indulgences only given to winners of three weeks' dormitory  records, so the less fortunate occupants of the Brown and Rose rooms  were really profiting by the tidiness of their hostesses. The Blue  Grotto was placed in apple-pie order on the afternoon of the fourteenth  of February. A white hemstitched cloth and a bowl of snowdrops adorned  the center table, and the cakes were set out on paper doilies. Both  hostesses and guests were in the dining-hall by four o'clock, awaiting  the appearance of the urns, and each bore her cup of tea and a portion  of bread and butter and scones upstairs with her.    It was a jolly party round the square table, and if the cakes were not  too plentiful, they were at least voted delicious. The"]]]
