Well, and then she used to caution the  little Pony Engine against getting in the way of the big locomotives,  and told it to keep close round after her, and try to do all it could to  learn about shifting empty cars. You see, she knew how ambitious the  little Pony Engine was, and how it wasn't contented a bit just to grow  up in the pony-engine business, and be tied down to the depot all its  days. Once she happened to tell it that if it was good and always did  what it was bid, perhaps a cow-catcher would grow on it some day, and  then it could be a passenger locomotive. Mammas have to promise all  sorts of things, and she was almost distracted when she said that.\"    \"I don't think she ought to have deceived it, papa,\" said the boy. \"But  it ought to have known that if it was a Pony Engine to begin with, it  never could have a cow-catcher.\"    \"Couldn't it?\" asked the little girl, gently.    \"No; they're kind of mooley.\"    The little girl asked the papa, \"What makes Pony Engines mooley?\" for  she did not choose to be told by her brother; he was only two years  older than she was, anyway.    \"Well; it's pretty hard to say. You see, when a locomotive is first  hatched--\"    \"Oh, are they hatched, papa?\" asked the boy.    \"Well, we'll _call_ it hatched,\" said the papa; but they knew he was  just funning. \"They're about the size of tea-kettles at first; and it's  a chance whether they will have cow-catchers or not. If they keep their  spouts, they will; and if their spouts drop off, they won't.\"    \"What makes the spout ever drop off?\"    \"Oh, sometimes the pip, or the gapes--\"    The children both began to shake the papa, and he was glad enough to go  on sensibly. \"Well, anyway, the mother locomotive certainly oughtn't to  have deceived it. Still she had to say _something_, and perhaps the  little Pony Engine was better employed watching its buffers with its  head-light, to see whether its cow-catcher had begun to grow, than it  would have been in listening to the stories of the old locomotives, and  sometimes their swearing.\"    \"Do they swear, papa?\" asked the little girl, somewhat shocked, and yet  pleased.    \"Well, I never heard them, _near by_. But it sounds a good deal like  swearing when you hear them on the up-grade on our hill in the night.  Where was I?\"    \"Swearing,\" said the boy. \"And please don't go back, now, papa.\"    \"Well, I won't. It'll be as much as I can do to get through this story,  without going over any of it again. Well, the thing that the little Pony  Engine wanted to be, the most in this world, was the locomotive of the  Pacific Express, that starts out every afternoon at three, you know. It  intended to apply for the place as soon as its cow-catcher was grown,  and it was always trying to attract the locomotive's attention, backing  and filling on the track alongside of the train; and once it raced it a  little piece, and beat it, before the Express locomotive was under way,  and almost got in front of it on a switch. My, but its mother was  scared! She just yelled to it with her whistle; and that night she sent  it to sleep without a particle of coal or water in its tender.    \"But the little Pony Engine didn't care. It had beaten the Pacific  Express in a hundred yards, and what was to hinder it from beating it as  long as it chose? The little Pony Engine could not get it out of its  head. It was just like a boy who thinks he can whip a man.\"    The boy lifted his head. \"Well, a boy _can_, papa, if he goes to do it  the right way. Just stoop down before the man knows it, and catch him by  the legs and tip him right over.\"    \"Ho! I guess you see yourself!\" said the little girl, scornfully.    \"Well, I _could_!\" said the boy; \"and some day I'll just show you.\"    \"Now, little cock-sparrow, now!\" said the papa; and he laughed. \"Well,  the little Pony Engine thought he could beat the Pacific Express,  anyway; and so one dark, snowy, blowy afternoon, when his mother was off  pushing some empty coal cars up past the Know-Nothing crossing beyond  Charlestown, he got on the track in front of the Express, and when he  heard the conductor say 'All aboard,' and the starting gong struck, and  the brakemen leaned out and waved to the engineer, he darted off like  lightning. He had his steam up, and he just scuttled.    \"Well, he was so excited for a while that he couldn't tell whether the  Express was gaining on him or not; but after twenty or thirty miles, he  thought he heard it pretty near. Of course the Express locomotive was  drawing a heavy train of cars, and it had to make a stop or two--at  Charlestown, and at Concord Junction, and at Ayer--so the Pony Engine  did really gain on it a little; and when it began to be scared it gained  a good deal. But the first place where it began to feel sorry, and to  want its mother, was in Hoosac Tunnel. It never was in a tunnel before,  and it seemed as if it would never get out. It kept thinking, What if  the Pacific Express was to run over it there in the dark, and its mother  off there at the Fitchburg Depot, in Boston, looking for it among the  side-tracks? It gave a perfect shriek; and just then it shot out of the  tunnel. There were a lot of locomotives loafing around there at North  Adams, and one of them shouted out to it as it flew by, 'What's your  hurry, little one?' and it just screamed back, 'Pacific Express!' and  never stopped to explain. They talked in locomotive language--\"    \"Oh, what did it sound like?\" the boy asked.    \"Well, pretty queer; I'll tell you some day. It knew it had no time to  fool away, and all through the long, dark night, whenever, a locomotive  hailed it, it just screamed, 'Pacific Express!' and kept on. And the  Express kept gaining on it. Some of the locomotives wanted to stop it,  but they decided they had better not get in its way, and so it whizzed  along across New York State and Ohio and Indiana, till it got to  Chicago. And the Express kept gaining on it. By that time it was so  hoarse it could hardly whisper, but it kept saying, 'Pacific Express!  Pacific Express!' and it kept right on till it reached the Mississippi  River. There it found a long train of freight cars before it on the  bridge. It couldn't wait, and so it slipped down from the track to the  edge of the river and jumped across, and then scrambled up the  embankment to the track again.\"    \"Papa!\" said the little girl, warningly.    \"Truly it did,\" said the papa.    \"Ho! that's nothing,\" said the boy. \"A whole train of cars did it in  that Jules Verne book.\"    \"Well,\" the papa went on, \"after that it had a little rest, for the  Express had to wait for the freight train to get off the bridge, and the  Pony Engine stopped at the first station for a drink of water and a  mouthful of coal, and then it flew ahead. There was a kind old  locomotive at Omaha that tried to find out where it belonged, and what  its mother's name was, but the Pony Engine was so bewildered it couldn't  tell. And the Express kept gaining on it. On the plains it was chased by  a pack of prairie wolves, but it left them far behind; and the antelopes  were scared half to death. But the worst of it was when the nightmare  got after it.\"    \"The nightmare? Goodness!\" said the boy.    \"I've had the nightmare,\" said the little girl.    \"Oh yes, a mere human nightmare,\" said the papa. \"But a locomotive  nightmare is a very different thing.\"    \"Why, what's it like?\" asked the boy. The little girl was almost afraid  to ask.    \"Well, it has only one leg, to begin with.\"    \"Pshaw!\"    \"Wheel, I mean. And it has four cow-catchers, and four head-lights, and  two boilers, and eight whistles, and it just goes whirling and  screeching along. Of course it wobbles awfully; and as it's only got one  wheel, it has to keep skipping from one track to the other.\"    \"I should think it would run on the cross-ties,\" said the boy.    \"Oh, very well, then!\" said the papa. \"If you know so much more about it  than I do! Who's telling this story, anyway? Now I shall have to go back  to the beginning. Once there was a little Pony En--\"    They both put their hands over his mouth, and just fairly begged him to  go on, and at last he did. \"Well, it got away from the nightmare about  morning, but not till the nightmare had bitten a large piece out of its  tender, and then it braced up for the home-stretch. It thought that if  it could once beat the Express to the Sierras, it could keep the start  the rest of the way, for it could get over the mountains quicker than  the Express could, and it might be in San Francisco before the Express  got to Sacramento. The Express kept gaining on it. But it just zipped  along the upper edge of Kansas and the lower edge of Nebraska, and on  through Colorado and Utah and Nevada, and when it got to the Sierras it  just stooped a little, and went over them like a goat; it did, truly;  just doubled up its fore wheels under it, and jumped. And the Express  kept gaining on it. By this time it couldn't say 'Pacific Express' any  more, and it didn't try. It just said 'Express! Express!' and then  ''Press! 'Press!' and then ''Ess! 'Ess!' and pretty soon only ''Ss!  'Ss!' And the Express kept gaining on it. Before they reached San  Francisco, the Express locomotive's cow-catcher was almost touching the  Pony Engine's tender; it gave one howl of anguish as it felt the Express  locomotive's hot breath on the place where the nightmare had bitten the  piece out, and tore through the end of the San Francisco depot, and  plunged into the Pacific Ocean, and was never seen again. There, now,\"  said the papa, trying to make the children get down, \"that's all. Go to  bed.\" The little girl was crying, and so he tried to comfort her by  keeping her in his lap.    The boy cleared his throat. \"What is the moral, papa?\" he asked,  huskily.    \"Children, obey your parents,\" said the papa.    \"And"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22521"],[0,"The Young Acrobat of the Great North American Circus (#5)"],[1,"to flatter you! You are puffed up enough.\"    \"Are you sorry I jumped into the ring, Ralph?\" asked Kit good-naturedly.    \"I don't believe there was any real danger.\"    \"Then I must congratulate you upon your courage. All the rest of us were  frightened, and even Mr. Barlow admitted that there was danger.\"    \"The lion was half tame. It isn't as if he were wild.\"    \"He looked wild enough to me when I faced him in the ring. I confess  that my knees began to tremble, and I wished myself at home.\"    \"You'd better set up as a lion tamer,\" said Ralph.    \"Thank you; I think I should prefer some other business, where my life  would be safer.\"    \"You are likely to have your wish, then.\"    \"What do you mean?\" asked Kit quickly, detecting a significance in  Ralph's tone.    \"I mean that father intends to have you learn a trade.\"    \"Has he told you so?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Doesn't he propose to consult me?\"    \"Why should he? You are only a boy, and can't judge what is best for  yourself.\"    \"Still I am likely to be more interested than any one else in the way I  am to earn my living. What trade are _you_ going to learn?\"    \"What trade am I going to learn?\" repeated Ralph, with the assumption of  insulted dignity. \"None at all. I shall be a merchant or a professional  man.\"    \"And why should not I be the same?\" asked Kit.    \"Because you're a poor boy. Didn't my father tell you this afternoon  that you had no money coming to you?\"    \"Yes; but that needn't prevent me from becoming a merchant, or studying  a profession.\"    \"So _you_ think. You can't expect my father to pay for sending you to  college, or support you while you are qualifying yourself to be a  merchant.\"    \"I don't know yet what I am entitled to expect.\"    \"You will soon know.\"    \"How soon?\"    \"To-morrow. There's a blacksmith in the next town, Aaron Bickford, who  has agreed to take you as an apprentice.\"    \"So it's all settled, is it?\" Kit asked, full of indignation.    \"Yes, if Mr. Bickford likes your appearance. He's coming to Smyrna on  business to-morrow, and will call here. You're to live at his house.\"    \"Indeed! I am very much obliged for the information.\"    \"Oh, you needn't get grouty about it. I've no doubt you'll have enough  to eat.\"    \"So I am to be a blacksmith, and you a merchant or----\"    \"Lawyer. I think I shall decide to be a lawyer,\" said Ralph,  complacently.    \"That will make quite a difference in our social positions.\"    \"Of course; but I will help you all I can. If you have a shop of your  own, I will have my horses shod at your place.\"    \"Does your father think I am particularly well fitted to be a  blacksmith?\"    \"He thinks you will get along very well in the business, if you are  industrious. A poor boy can't choose. He must take the best he can get.\"    Kit did not sleep very much that night. He was full of anger and  indignation with his uncle. Why should his future be so different from  his cousin's? At school he had distinguished himself more in his  studies, and he did not see why he was not as well fitted to become a  merchant or a lawyer as Ralph.    \"They can't make me a blacksmith without my consent,\" was his final  thought, as he closed his eyes and went to sleep.    Kit was up early the next morning. As breakfast was not ready, he  strolled over to the hotel, which was only five minutes' walk from his  uncle's house.    The circus tent had vanished. Late at night, after the evening  performance was over, the canvas men had busied themselves in taking  them down, and packing them for transportation to a town ten miles  distant on the railroad, where they were to give two exhibitions the  next day. The showy chariots, the lions, tigers, elephants and camels,  with all the performers, were gone. But Mr. Barlow, the owner of the  circus, had remained at the Smyrna Hotel all night, preferring to  journey comfortably the next morning.    He was sitting on the piazza when Kit passed. Though he had never seen  Kit but once, his business made him observant of faces, and he  recognized him immediately.    \"Aha!\" he said, \"this is the young hero of last evening, is it not?\"    Kit smiled.    \"I am the boy who jumped into the ring,\" he said.    \"So I thought. I hope you slept well after the excitement.\"    A sudden thought came to Kit. Mr. Barlow looked like a kind hearted man,  and he had already shown that he was well disposed toward him.    \"I slept very poorly,\" he said.    \"Was it the thought of the danger you had been in?\"    \"No, sir; I learned that my uncle, without consulting me, had arranged  to apprentice me to a blacksmith.\"    Mr. Barlow looked surprised.    \"But you look like a boy of independent means,\" he said, puzzled.    \"I have always supposed that this was the case,\" said Kit, \"but my uncle  told me yesterday, to my surprise, that I was dependent upon him, and  had no expectations.\"    \"You don't want to be a blacksmith?\"    \"No, sir; I consider any kind of work honorable, but that would not suit  me.\"    \"You would succeed well in my business,\" said the showman, \"but I am  very careful how I recommend it to boys. It isn't a good school for  them. They are exposed to many temptations in it. But if a boy has a  strong will, and good principles, he may avoid all the evils connected  with it.\"    Kit had not thought of it before, but now the question suggested itself:  \"Why should I not join the circus. I should like it better than being a  blacksmith.\"    \"How much do you pay acrobats?\" he asked.    \"Are you an acrobat?\" asked Mr. Barlow.    Kit told the story of his practicing with the Vincenti Brothers.    \"Good!\" said Mr. Barlow. \"If they indorse you, it is sufficient. If you  decide to join my company, I will give you, to begin with, ten dollars  a week and your expenses.\"    \"Thank you, sir,\" said Kit, dazzled by the offer, \"Where will you be on  Saturday?\"    \"At Grafton on Saturday, and Milltown on Monday.\"    \"If I decide to join you, I will do so at one or the other of those  places.\"    Here the railroad omnibus came up, and Mr. Barlow entered it, for he was  to leave by the next train.          CHAPTER VII.    AARON BICKFORD, THE BLACKSMITH.      Kit returned to breakfast in good spirits. He saw a way out of his  difficulties. Though he had no false pride, he felt that a blacksmith's  life would be distasteful to him. He was fond of study, and had looked  forward to a college course. Now this was out of the question. It seemed  that he was as poor as his friend, Dan Clark, with his own way to make  in the world. When he left school, at the beginning of the vacation, he  supposed that he would inherit a competence. It was certainly a great  change in his prospects, but now he did not feel dispirited. He thought,  upon the whole, he would enjoy traveling with the circus. His duties  would be light, and the pay liberal.    Before he returned to breakfast, Ralph had come down-stairs, and had a  few words with his father.    \"I think you are going to have trouble with Kit, father,\" he commenced.    \"What makes you think so, and what about?\" asked Mr. Watson.    \"I told him last evening about your plan of apprenticing him to Mr.  Bickford.\"    \"You did wrong. I did not propose to mention the matter to him till Mr.  Bickford's arrival. What did he say?\"    \"He turned up his nose at the idea. He thinks he ought to become a  merchant or a professional man like me. He is too proud to be a  blacksmith.\"    \"Then he must put his pride in his pocket. It will be all I can do to  pay the expenses of your education. I can't provide for two boys.\"    \"When Kit is off your hands won't you increase my allowance, father?\"  asked Ralph, insinuatingly.    \"Suppose we postpone that matter,\" replied Mr. Watson, in a tone of  voice that was not encouraging. \"I have lost some money lately, and I  can't do anything more for you just at present.\"    Ralph looked disappointed, but did not venture to press the subject.    \"Where have you been, Kit?\" he asked, as he saw his cousin entering the  gate, and coming up the path to the front door.    \"I have been taking a walk,\" answered Kit, cheerfully.    \"It's a good idea to rise early.\"    \"Why?\"    \"Because you will probably be required to do so in your new place.\"    \"What new place?\"    \"At the blacksmith's.\"    Kit smiled. To Ralph's surprise he did not appear to be annoyed.    \"I see you are getting reconciled to the idea. Last evening you seemed  to dislike it.\"    \"Your father has not said anything about it to me.\"    \"He will very soon.\"    \"Won't you come round and see me occasionally, Ralph?\" asked Kit, with a  curious smile.    \"Yes; I may call on Saturday. I should like to see how you look.\"    Kit smiled again. He thought it extremely doubtful whether Ralph would  see him at the blacksmith's forge.    Half an hour after breakfast, while Ralph and Kit were in the stable,  the sound of wheels was heard, and a stout, broad-shouldered man, with a  bronzed complexion, drove up in a farm wagon. Throwing his reins over  the horse's neck, he descended from the wagon, and turned in at the  gate. Mr. Watson, who had been sitting at the front window, opened the  door for him.    \"Glad to see you, Mr. Bickford,\" he said.    \"Is the boy ready?\" asked the blacksmith. \"I can take him right over  with me this morning.\"    \"Come into the house, I will send for him.\"    Mr. Bickford noticed the handsome appearance of the hall, and the front  room, the door of which was partly open, and said: \"If the boy's been  used to livin' here, he must be kind of high strung. I can't give him no  such home as this.\"    \"Of course not, Mr. Bickford. He can't expect it. He's a poor boy, and  will have to make his own way in the world. Beggars can't be choosers,  you know.\"    A servant was sent to the stable to summon Kit. Ralph, who thought he  should enjoy the scene, accompanied him.    Kit regarded the blacksmith with some curiosity.    \"This is Mr. Aaron Bickford, of Oakford,"]]]
