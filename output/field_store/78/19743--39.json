[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22542"],[0,"Jesus the Christ (#5)"],[1,"main facts  attested by this scripture as having a direct bearing upon our present  subject are those of the Christ manifesting Himself while yet in His  antemortal state, and of His declaration that He had been chosen from  the foundation of the world as the Redeemer.    Revelation given through the prophets of God in the present dispensation  is replete with evidence of Christ's appointment and ordination in the  primeval world; and the whole tenor of the scriptures contained in the  Doctrine and Covenants may be called in witness. The following instances  are particularly in point. In a communication to Joseph Smith the  prophet, in May, 1833, the Lord declared Himself as the One who had  previously come into the world from the Father, and of whom John had  borne testimony as the Word; and the solemn truth is reiterated that He,  Jesus Christ, \"was in the beginning, before the world was\", and further,  that He was the Redeemer who \"came into the world, because the world was  made by him, and in him was the life of men and the light of men.\"  Again, He is referred to as \"the Only Begotten of the Father, full of  grace and truth, even the Spirit of truth, which came and dwelt in the  flesh.\" In the course of the same revelation the Lord said: \"And now,  verily I say unto you, I was in the beginning with the Father and am the  firstborn.\"[27] On an earlier occasion, as the modern prophet testifies,  he and an associate in the priesthood were enlightened by the Spirit so  that they were able to see and understand the things of God--\"Even those  things which were from the beginning before the world was, which were  ordained of the Father, through his Only Begotten Son, who was in the  bosom of the Father, even from the beginning, of whom we bear record,  and the record which we bear is the fulness of the gospel of Jesus  Christ, who is the Son, whom we saw and with whom we conversed in the  heavenly vision.\"[28]    The testimony of scriptures written on both hemispheres, that of records  both ancient and modern, the inspired utterances of prophets and  apostles, and the words of the Lord Himself, are of one voice in  proclaiming the preexistence of the Christ and His ordination as the  chosen Savior and Redeemer of mankind--in the beginning, yea, even  before the foundation of the world.      NOTES TO CHAPTER 2.    1. Graded Intelligences in the Antemortal State.--That the spirits of  men existed as individual intelligences, of varying degrees of ability  and power, prior to the inauguration of the mortal state upon this earth  and even prior to the creation of the world as a suitable abode for  human beings, is shown in great plainness through a divine revelation to  Abraham: \"Now the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, the intelligences  that were organized before the world was; and among all these there were  many of the noble and great ones; and God saw these souls that they were  good, and he stood in the midst of them, and he said: These I will make  my rulers; for he stood among those that were spirits, and he saw that  they were good; and he said unto me: Abraham, thou art one of them; thou  wast chosen before thou wast born.\" (P. of G.P., Abraham 3:22, 23.)    That both Christ and Satan were among those exalted intelligences, and  that Christ was chosen while Satan was rejected as the future Savior of  mankind, are shown by the portions of the revelation immediately  following that above quoted: \"And there stood one among them that was  like unto God, and he said unto those who were with him: We will go  down, for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and  we will make an earth whereon these may dwell; and we will prove them  herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their  God shall command them; and they who keep their first estate shall be  added upon, and they who keep not their first estate shall not have  glory in the same kingdom with those who keep their first estate; and  they who keep their second estate shall have glory added upon their  heads forever and ever. And the Lord said: Whom shall I send? And one  answered like unto the Son of Man: Here am I, send me. And another  answered and said: Here am I, send me. And the Lord said: I will send  the first. And the second was angry, and kept not his first estate; and,  at that day, many followed after him\" (verses 24-28).    2. The Primeval Council in the Heavens.--\"It is definitely stated in the  Book of Genesis that God said, 'Let us make man in our image, after our  likeness;' and again, after Adam had taken of the forbidden fruit the  Lord said, 'Behold, the man has become as one of us;' and the inference  is direct that in all that related to the work of the creation of the  world there was a consultation; and though God spake as it is recorded  in the Bible, yet it is evident He counseled with others. The scriptures  tell us there are 'Gods many and Lords many. But to us there is but one  God, the Father' (1 Cor. 8:5). And for this reason, though there were  others engaged in the creation of the worlds, it is given to us in the  Bible in the shape that it is; for the fulness of these truths is only  revealed to highly favored persons for certain reasons known to God; as  we are told in the scriptures: 'The secret of the Lord is with them that  fear him; and he will show them his covenant.'--Psalms 25:14.    \"It is consistent to believe that at this Council in the heavens the  plan that should be adopted in relation to the sons of God who were then  spirits, and had not yet obtained tabernacles, was duly considered. For,  in view of the creation of the world and the placing of men upon it,  whereby it would be possible for them to obtain tabernacles, and in  those tabernacles obey laws of life, and with them again be exalted  among the Gods, we are told that at that time, 'the morning stars sang  together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy.' The question then  arose, how, and upon what principle, should the salvation, exaltation  and eternal glory of God's sons be brought about? It is evident that at  that Council certain plans had been proposed and discussed, and that  after a full discussion of those principles, and the declaration of the  Father's will pertaining to His design, Lucifer came before the Father  with a plan of his own, saying, 'Behold [here am] I; send me, I will be  thy son, and I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost,  and surely I will do it; wherefore, give me thine honor.' But Jesus, on  hearing this statement made by Lucifer, said, 'Father, thy will be done,  and the glory be thine forever.' From these remarks made by the well  beloved Son, we should naturally infer that in the discussion of this  subject the Father had made known His will and developed His plan and  design pertaining to these matters, and all that His well beloved Son  wanted to do was to carry out the will of His Father, as it would appear  had been before expressed. He also wished the glory to be given to His  Father, who, as God the Father, and the originator and designer of the  plan, had a right to all the honor and glory. But Lucifer wanted to  introduce a plan contrary to the will of his Father, and then wanted His  honor, and said: 'I will save every soul of man, wherefore give me thine  honor.' He wanted to go contrary to the will of his Father, and  presumptuously sought to deprive man of his free agency, thus making him  a serf, and placing him in a position in which it was impossible for him  to obtain that exaltation which God designed should be man's, through  obedience to the law which He had suggested; and again, Lucifer wanted  the honor and power of his Father, to enable him to carry out principles  which were contrary to the Father's wish.\"--John Taylor--_Mediation and  Atonement_, pp. 93, 94.    3. The Jaredites.--\"Of the two nations whose histories constitute the  Book of Mormon, the first in order of time consisted of the people of  Jared, who followed their leader from the Tower of Babel at the time of  the confusion of tongues. Their history was written on twenty-four  plates of gold by Ether, the last of their prophets, who, foreseeing the  destruction of his people because of their wickedness, hid away the  historical plates. They were afterward found, B.C. 123, by an expedition  sent out by King Limhi, a Nephite ruler. The record engraved on these  plates was subsequently abridged by Moroni, and the condensed account  was attached by him to the Book of Mormon record; it appears in the  modern translation under the name of the Book of Ether.    \"The first and chief prophet of the Jaredites is not mentioned by name  in the record as we have it; he is known only as the brother of Jared.  Of the people, we learn that, amid the confusion of Babel, Jared and his  brother importuned the Lord that He would spare them and their  associates from the impending disruption. Their prayer was heard, and  the Lord led them with a considerable company, who, like themselves,  were free from the taint of idolatry, away from their homes, promising  to conduct them to a land choice above all other lands. Their course of  travel is not given with exactness; we learn only that they reached the  ocean, and there constructed eight vessels, called barges, in which they  set out upon the waters. These vessels were small and dark within; but  the Lord made luminous certain stones, which gave light to the  imprisoned voyagers. After a passage of three hundred and forty-four  days, the colony landed on the western shore of North America, probably  at a place south of the Gulf of California, and north of the Isthmus of  Panama.    \"Here they became a flourishing nation; but, giving way in time to  internal dissensions, they divided into factions, which warred with one  another until the people were totally destroyed. This destruction, which  occurred near the hill Ramah, afterward"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22544"],[0,"A World is Born (#5)"],[1," then it was too late.  One collapsed and was buried. The pilot fell backward, and then other  man died under his body, of a broken neck.    Ward stopped. Gray could see his face, dark and hard and calculating. He  studied Gray and Dio, and the dead men. He turned and looked back at  Caron. Then, deliberately, he stripped off his gun belt, threw down his  gun, and waded into the river.    Gray remembered, then, that Ward too wore rubber boots, and had no metal  on him.           *       *       *       *       *    Ward came on, the glowing ropes sliding surf-like around his boots. Very  carefully. Gray handed Jill to Dio.    \"If I die too,\" he said, \"there's only Caron down there. He's too fat to  stop you.\"    Jill spoke, but he turned his back. He was suddenly confused, and it was  almost pleasant to be able to lose his confusion in fighting. Ward had  stopped some five feet away. Now he untied the length of tough cord that  served him for a belt.    Gray nodded. Ward would try to throw a twist around his ankle and trip  him. Once his body touched those swarming creatures....    He tensed, watchfully. The rat's grin was set on Ward's dark face. The  cord licked out.    But it caught Gray's throat instead of his ankle!    Ward laughed and braced himself. Cursing, Gray caught at the rope. But  friction held it, and Ward pulled, hard. His face purpling, Gray could  still commend Ward's strategy. In taking Gray off guard, he'd more than  made up what he lost in point of leverage.    Letting his body go with the pull, Gray flung himself at Ward. Blood  blinded him, his heart was pounding, but he thought he foresaw Ward's  next move. He let himself be pulled almost within striking distance.    Then, as Ward stepped, aside, jerking the rope and thrusting out a  tripping foot, Gray made a catlike shift of balance and bent over.    His hands almost touched that weird, flowing surf as they clasped Ward's  boot. Throwing all his strength into the lift, he hurled Ward backward.    Ward screamed once and disappeared under the blue fire. Gray clawed the  rope from his neck. And then, suddenly, the world began to sway under  him. He knew he was falling.    Some one's hand caught him, held him up. Fighting down his vertigo as  his breath came back, he saw that it was Jill.    \"Why?\" he gasped, but her answer was lost in a titanic roar of thunder.  Lightning blasted down. Dio's voice reached him, thin and distant  through the clamor.    \"We'll be killed! These damn things will attract the bolts!\"    It was true. All his work had been for nothing. Looking up into that  low, angry sky, Gray knew he was going to die.    Quite irrelevantly, Jill's words in the tunnel came back to him. \"You're  a fool ... lost truth ... not true to lie!\"    Now, in this moment, she couldn't lie to him. He caught her shoulders  cruelly, trying to read her eyes.    Very faintly through the uproar, he heard her. \"I'm sorry for you, Gray.  Good man, gone to waste.\"    Dio stifled a scream. Thunder crashed between the sounding boards of the  cliffs. Gray looked up.    A titanic bolt of lightning shot down, straight for them. The burning  blue surf was agitated, sending up pseudopods uncannily like worshipping  arms. The bolt struck.    The air reeked of ozone, but Gray felt no shock. There was a hiss, a  vast stirring of creatures around him. The blue light glowed, purpled.    Another bolt struck down, and another, and still they were not dead. The  fire-things had become a writhing, joyous tangle of tenuous bodies,  glowing bright and brighter.    Stunned, incredulous, the three humans stood. The light was now an  eye-searing violet. Static electricity tingled through them in eerie  waves. But they were not burned.    \"My God,\" whispered Gray. \"They eat it. They eat lightning!\"    Not daring to move, they stood watching that miracle of alien life, the  feeding of living things on raw current. And when the last bolt had  struck, the tide turned and rolled back down the wind-tunnel, a blinding  river of living light.    Silently, the three humans went down the rocky slope to where Caron of  Mars cowered in the silver ship. No bolt had come near it. And now Caron  came to meet them.    His face was pasty with fear, but the old cunning still lurked in his  eyes.    \"Gray,\" he said. \"I have an offer to make.\"    \"Well?\"    \"You killed my pilot,\" said Caron suavely. \"I can't fly, myself. Take me  off, and I'll pay you anything you want.\"    \"In bullets,\" retorted Gray. \"You won't want witnesses to this.\"    \"Circumstances force me. Physically, you have the advantage.\"    Jill's fingers caught his arm. \"Don't, Gray! The Project....\"    Caron faced her. \"The Project is doomed in any case. My men carried out  my secondary instructions. All the cables in your valley have been cut.  There is a storm now ready to break.    \"In fifteen minutes or so, everything will be destroyed, except the  domes. Regrettable, but....\" He shrugged.    Jill's temper blazed, choking her so that she could hardly speak.    \"Look at him, Gray,\" she whispered. \"That's what you're so proud of  being. A cynic, who believes in nothing but himself. Look at him!\"    Gray turned on her.    \"Damn you!\" he grated. \"Do you expect me to believe you, with the world  full of hypocrites like him?\"    Her eyes stopped him. He remembered Moulton, pleading for her life. He  remembered how she had looked back there at the tunnel, when they had  been sure of death. Some of his assurance was shaken.    \"Listen,\" he said harshly. \"I can save your valley. There's a chance in  a million of coming out alive. Will you die for what you believe in?\"    She hesitated, just for a second. Then she looked at Dio and said,  \"Yes.\"    Gray turned. Almost lazily, his fist snapped up and took Caron on his  flabby jaw.    \"Take care of him, Dio,\" he grunted. Then he entered the ship, herding  the white-faced girl before him.           *       *       *       *       *    The ship hurtled up into airless space, where the blinding sunlight lay  in sharp shadows on the rock. Over the ridge and down again, with the  Project hidden under a surf of storm-clouds.    Cutting in the air motors, Gray dropped. Black, bellowing darkness  swallowed them. Then he saw the valley, with the copper cables fallen,  and the wheat already on fire in several places.    Flying with every bit of his skill, he sought the narrowest part of the  valley and flipped over in a racking loop. The stern tubes hit rock. The  nose slammed down on the opposite wall, wedging the ship by sheer  weight.    Lightning gathered in a vast javelin and flamed down upon them. Jill  flinched and caught her breath. The flame hissed along the hull and  vanished into seared and blackened rock.    \"Still willing to die for principle?\" asked Gray brutally.    She glared at him. \"Yes,\" she snapped. \"But I hate having to die in your  company!\"    She looked down at the valley. Lightning struck with monotonous  regularity on the hull, but the valley was untouched. Jill smiled,  though her face was white, her body rigid with waiting.    It was the smile that did it. Gray looked at her, her tousled black  curls, the lithe young curves of throat and breast. He leaned back in  his seat, scowling out at the storm.    \"Relax,\" he said. \"You aren't going to die.\"    She turned on him, not daring to speak. He went on, slowly.    \"The only chance you took was in the landing. We're acting as lightning  rod for the whole valley, being the highest and best conductor. But, as  a man named Faraday proved, the charge resides on the surface of the  conductor. We're perfectly safe.\"    \"How dared you!\" she whispered.    He faced her, almost angrily.    \"You knocked the props out from under my philosophy. I've had enough  hypocritical eyewash. I had to prove you. Well, I have.\"    She was quiet for some time. Then she said, \"I understand, Duke. I'm  glad. And now what, for you?\"    He shrugged wryly.    \"I don't know. I can still take Caron's other ship and escape. But I  don't think I want to. I think perhaps I'll stick around and give virtue  another whirl.\"    Smoothing back his sleek fair hair, he shot her a sparkling look from  under his hands.    \"I won't,\" he added softly, \"even mind going to Sunday School, if you  were the teacher.\"                 *       *       *       *       *          Transcriber's Note:    The following typographical errors in the original text have been  corrected in this eBook:       Page 62: \"smill\" changed to \"small\"       Page 63: \"and\" changed to \"end\""]]]
