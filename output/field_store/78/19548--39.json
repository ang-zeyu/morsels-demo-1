The ill humor of the commons, thus wantonly irritated by the court, and  finding no gratification in the legal impeachment of Buckingham, sought  other objects on which it might exert itself. The never-failing cry of  Popery here served them in stead. They again claimed the execution of  the penal laws against Catholics; and they presented to the king a list  of persons intrusted with offices, most of them insignificant who were  either convicted or suspected recusants.[*] In this particular they had,  perhaps, some reason to blame the king's conduct. He had promised to the  last house of commons a redress of this religious grievance: but he was  apt, in imitation of his father, to imagine that the parliament, when  they failed of supplying his necessities, had, on their part, freed him  from the obligation of a strict performance. A new odium, likewise, by  these representations, was attempted to be thrown upon Buckingham. His  mother, who had great influence over him, was a professed Catholic; his  wife was not free from suspicion: and the indulgence given to Catholics  was of course supposed to proceed entirely from his credit and  authority. So violent was the bigotry of the times, that it was thought  a sufficient reason for disqualifying any one from holding an office,  that his wife, or relations, or companions were Papists, though he  himself were a conformist.[**]    It is remarkable, that persecution was here chiefly pushed on by laymen;  and that the church was willing to have granted more liberty than would  be allowed by the commons. The reconciling doctrines, likewise, of  Montague failed not anew to meet with severe censures from that zealous  assembly.[***]         * Franklyn, p. 195. Rushworth.         ** See the list in Franklyn and Rushworth.         *** Rushworth, vol. i. p. 209.    The next attack made by the commons, had it prevailed, would have proved  decisive. They were preparing a remonstranace against the levying  of tonnage and poundage without consent of parliament. This article,  together with the new impositions laid on merchandise by James,  constituted near half of the crown revenues; and by depriving the king  of these resources, they would have reduced him to total subjection  and dependence. While they retained such a pledge, besides the supply  already promised, they were sure that nothing could be refused them.  Though, after canvassing the matter near three ninths, they found  themselves utterly incapable of fixing any legal crime upon the duke,  they regarded him as an unable, and perhaps a dangerous minister;  and they intended to present a petition, which would then have been  equivalent to a command, for removing him from his majesty's person and  councils.[*]    The king was alarmed at the yoke which he saw prepared for him.  Buckingham's sole guilt, he thought, was the being his friend and  favorite.[**]         * Rushworth, vol. i. p. 400 Franklyn, p. 199.         ** Franklyn, p. 178.    All the other complaints against him were mere pretences. A little  before, he was the idol of the people. No new crime had since been  discovered. After the most diligent inquiry, prompted by the greatest  malice, the smallest appearance of guilt could not be fixed upon him.  What idea, he asked, must all mankind entertain of his honor, should he  sacrifice his innocent friend to pecuniary considerations? What further  authority should he retain in the nation, were he capable, in the  beginning of his reign, to give, in so signal an instance, such matter  of triumph to his enemies, and discouragement to his adherents? To-day  the commons pretend to wrest his minister from him: to-morrow they  will attack some branch of his prerogative. By their remonstrances, and  promises, and protestations, they had engaged the crown in a war.  As soon as they saw a retreat impossible, without waiting for new  incidents, without covering themselves with new pretences, they  immediately deserted him, and refused him all reasonable supply. It  was evident, that they desired nothing so much as to see him plunged in  inextricable difficulties, of which they intended to take advantage. To  such deep perfidy, to such unbounded usurpations, it was necessary to  oppose a proper firmness and resolution. All encroachments on supreme  power could only be resisted successfully on the first attempt. The  sovereign authority was, with some difficulty, reduced from its ancient  and legal height, but when once pushed downwards, it soon became  contemptible, and would easily, by the continuance of the same effort,  now encouraged by success, be carried to the lowest extremity.    Prompted by these plausible motives, Charles was determined immediately  to dissolve the parliament. When this resolution was known, the house  of peers, whose compliant behavior entitled them to some authority with  him, endeavored to interpose;[*] and they petitioned him, that he would  allow the parliament to sit some time longer. \"Not a moment longer,\"  cried the king hastily;[**] and he soon after ended the session by a  dissolution.    As this measure was foreseen, the commons took care to finish and  disperse their remonstrance, which they intended as a justification of  their conduct to the people. The king likewise, on his part, published  a declaration, in which he gave the reasons of his disagreement with  the parliament, and of their sudden dissolution, before they had time to  conclude any one act.[***] These papers furnished the partisans on  both sides with ample matter of apology or of recrimination. But all  impartial men judged, \"that the commons, though they had not as yet  violated any law, yet, by their unpliableness and independence, were  insensibly changing, perhaps improving, the spirit and genius, while  they preserved the form of the constitution and that the king was acting  altogether without any plan; running on in a road surrounded on all  sides with the most dangerous precipices, and concerting no proper  measures, either for submitting to the obstinacy of the commons, or for  subduing it.\"         * Rushworth, vol. i. p. 398.         ** Sanderson's Life of Charles I., p. 58.         *** Franklyn, p. 203, etc Parliament. Hist. vol. vii p. 300    After a breach with the parliament, which seemed so difficult to repair,  the only rational counsel which Charles could pursue, was immediately to  conclude a peace with Spain, and to render himself, as far as possible,  independent of his people, who discovered so little inclination to  support him, or rather who seemed to have formed a determined resolution  to abridge his authority. Nothing could be more easy in the execution  than this measure, nor more agreeable to his own and to national  interest. But, besides the treaties and engagements which he had entered  into with Holland and Denmark, the king's thoughts were at this time  averse to pacific counsels. There are two circumstances in Charles's  character, seemingly incompatible, which attended him during the whole  course of his reign, and were in part the cause of his misfortunes: he  was very steady, and even obstinate in his purpose; and he was easily  governed, by reason of his facility, and of his deference to men much  inferior to himself both in morals and understanding. His great ends  he inflexibly maintained; but the means of attaining them he readily  received from his ministers and favorites, though not always fortunate  in his choice. The violent, impetuous Buckingham, inflamed with a desire  of revenge for injuries which he himself had committed, and animated  with a love of glory which he had not talents to merit, had at  this time, notwithstanding his profuse licentious life, acquired an  invincible ascendant over the virtuous and gentle temper of the king.    The \"new counsels,\" which Charles had mentioned to the parliament, were  now to be tried, in order to supply his necessities. Had he possessed  any military force on which he could rely, it is not improbable, that  he had at once taken off the mask, and governed without any regard to  parliamentary privileges: so high an idea had he received of kingly  prerogative, and so contemptible a notion of the rights of those popular  assemblies, from which, he very naturally thought, he had met with such  ill usage. But his army was new levied, ill paid, and worse disciplined;  nowise superior to the militia, who were much more numerous, and who  were in a great measure under the influence of the country gentlemen.  It behoved him, therefore, to proceed cautiously, and to cover his  enterprises under the pretence of ancient precedents, which, considering  the great authority commonly enjoyed by his predecessors, could not be  wanting to him.    A commission was openly granted to compound with the Catholics, and  agree for dispensing with the penal laws enacted against them.[*] By  this expedient, the king both filled his coffers, and gratified his  inclination of giving indulgence to these religionists; but he could  not have employed any branch of prerogative which would have been  more disagreeable, or would have appeared more exceptionable to his  Protestant subjects.    From the nobility he desired assistance: from the city he required a  loan of one hundred thousand pounds. The former contributed slowly; but  the latter, covering themselves under many pretences and excuses, gave  him at last a flat refusal.[**]         * Rushworth, vol. i. p. 413. Whitlocke, p. 7.         ** Rushworth, vol. i. p. 415. Franklyn, p. 206.

(#5)"],[1,"importance was bestowed  on them, and men were taught to continue equally obstinate in rejecting  them: that the Presbyterian clergy would go every reasonable length,  rather than, by parting with their livings, expose themselves to a  state of beggary, at best of dependence: and that if their pride were  flattered by some seeming alterations, and a pretence given them for  affirming that they had not abandoned their former principles, nothing  further was wanting to produce a thorough union between those two  parties, which comprehended the bulk of the nation.    It was alleged, on the other hand, that the difference between religious  sects was founded, not on principle, but on passion; and till the  irregular affections of men could be corrected, it was in vain to  expect, by compliances, to obtain a perfect unanimity and comprehension:  that the more insignificant the objects of dispute appeared, with the  more certainty might it be inferred, that the real ground of dissension  was different from that which was universally pretended: that the  love of novelty, the pride of argumentation, the pleasure of making  proselytes, and the obstinacy of contradiction, would forever give  rise to sects and disputes; nor was it possible that such a source of  dissension could ever, by any concessions, be entirely exhausted: that  the church, by departing from ancient practices and principles, would  tacitly acknowledge herself guilty of error, and lose that reverence,  so requisite for preserving the attachment of the multitude; and that  if the present concessions (which was more than probable) should prove  ineffectual, greater must still be made; and in the issue discipline  would be despoiled of all its authority, and worship of all its decency,  without obtaining that end which had been so fondly sought for by these  dangerous indulgences.    The ministry were inclined to give the preference to the latter  arguments; and were the more confirmed in that intention by the  disposition which appeared in the parliament lately assembled. The  royalists and zealous churchmen were at present the popular party in the  nation, and, seconded by the efforts of the court, had prevailed in most  elections. Not more than fifty-six members of the Presbyterian party had  obtained seats in the lower house; [*] and these were not able either to  oppose or retard the measures of the majority. Monarchy, therefore, and  Episcopacy, were now exalted to as great power and splendor as they  had lately suffered misery and depression. Sir Edward Turner was chosen  speaker.         [*] Carte's Answer to the Bystander, p. 79.    An act was passed for the security of the king's person and government.  To intend or devise the king's imprisonment, or bodily harm, or  deposition, or levying war against him, was declared, during the  lifetime of his present majesty, to be high treason. To affirm him to be  a Papist or heretic, or to endeavor by speech or writing to alienate his  subjects' affections from him; these offences were made sufficient to  incapacitate the person guilty from holding any employment in church or  state. To maintain that the long parliament is not dissolved, or that  either or both houses, without the king, are possessed of legislative  authority, or that the covenant is binding, was made punishable by the  penalty of premunire.    The covenant itself, together with the act for erecting the high court  of justice, that for subscribing the engagement, and that for declaring  England a commonwealth, were ordered to be burnt by the hands of the  hangman. The people assisted with great alacrity on this occasion.    The abuses of petitioning in the preceding reign had been attended with  the worst consequences; and to prevent such irregular practices for the  future, it was enacted that no more than twenty hands should be fixed to  any petition, unless with the sanction of three justices, or the major  part of the grand jury, and that no petition should be presented to  the king or either house by above ten persons. The penalty annexed to  a transgression of this law was a fine of a hundred pounds and three  months' imprisonment.    The bishops, though restored to their spiritual authority, were still  excluded from parliament, by the law which the late king had passed  immediately before the commencement of the civil disorders. Great  violence, both against the king and the house of peers, had been  employed in passing this law; and on that account alone the partisans  of the church were provided with a plausible pretence for repealing it.  Charles expressed much satisfaction when he gave his assent to the act  for that purpose. It is certain that the authority of the crown, as well  as that of the church, was interested in restoring the prelates to their  former dignity. But those who deemed every acquisition of the prince  a detriment to the people, were apt to complain of this instance of  complaisance in the parliament.    After an adjournment of some months, the parliament was again assembled,  and proceeded in the same spirit as before. They discovered no design  of restoring, in its full extent, the ancient prerogative of the crown:  they were only anxious to repair all those breaches which had been made,  not by the love of liberty, but by the fury of faction and civil war.  The power of the sword had in all ages been allowed to be vested in the  crown; and though no law conferred this prerogative every parliament,  till the last of the preceding reign, had willingly submitted to an  authority more ancient, and therefore more sacred, than that of any  positive statute. It was now thought proper solemnly to relinquish the  violent pretensions of that parliament, and to acknowledge that neither  one house nor both houses, independent of the king, were possessed of  any military authority. The preamble to this statute went so far as to  renounce all right even of defensive arms against the king; and much  observation has been made with regard to a concession esteemed so  singular. Were these terms taken in their full literal sense, they imply  a total renunciation of limitations to monarchy, and of all privileges  in the subject, independent of the will of the sovereign. For as no  rights can subsist without some remedy, still less rights exposed to  so much invasion from tyranny, or even from ambition; if subjects must  never resist, it follows that every prince, without any effort, policy,  or violence, is at once rendered absolute and uncontrollable; the  sovereign needs only issue an edict abolishing every authority but his  own; and all liberty from that moment is in effect annihilated. But this  meaning it were absurd to impute to the present parliament, who, though  zealous royalists, showed in their measures that they had not cast off  all regard to national privileges. They were probably sensible, that  to suppose in the sovereign any such invasion of public liberty, is  entirely unconstitutional; and that therefore expressly to reserve, upon  that event, any right of resistance in the subject, must be liable to  the same objection. They had seen that the long parliament, under color  of defence, had begun a violent attack upon kingly power; and after  involving the kingdom in blood, had finally lost that liberty for which  they had so imprudently contended. They thought, perhaps erroneously,  that it was no longer possible, after such public and such exorbitant  pretensions, to persevere in that prudent silence hitherto maintained  by the laws; and that it was necessary, by some positive declaration, to  bar the return of like inconveniencies. When they excluded, therefore,  the right of defence, they supposed that the constitution, remaining  firm upon its basis, there never really could be an attack made by the  sovereign. If such an attack was at any time made, the necessity was  then extreme; and the case of extreme and violent necessity, no laws,  they thought, could comprehend; because to such a necessity no laws  could beforehand point out a proper remedy.    The other measures of this parliament still discovered a more anxious  care to guard against rebellion in the subject than encroachments in  the crown; the recent evils of civil war and usurpation had naturally  increased the spirit of submission to the monarch, and had thrown the  nation into that dangerous extreme. During the violent and jealous  government of the parliament and of the protectors, all magistrates  liable to suspicion had been expelled the corporations; and none had  been admitted who gave not proofs of affection to the ruling powers, or  who refused to subscribe the covenant. To leave all authority in such  hands seemed dangerous; and the parliament therefore empowered the king  to appoint commissioners for regulating the corporations, and expelling  such magistrates as either intruded themselves by violence, or professed  principles dangerous to the constitution, civil and ecclesiastical. It  was also enacted, that all magistrates should disclaim the obligation  of the covenant, and should declare both their belief that it was not  lawful, upon any pretence whatsoever, to resist the king, and their  abhorrence of the traitorous position of taking arms by the king's  authority against his person, or against those who were commissioned by  him.    {1662.} The care of the church was no less attended to by this  parliament than that of monarchy; and the bill of uniformity was a  pledge of their sincere attachment to the Episcopal hierarchy, and  of their antipathy to Presbyterianism, Different parties, however,  concurred in promoting this bill, which contained many severe clauses.  The Independents and other sectaries, enraged to find all their schemes  subverted by the Presbyterians, who had once been their associates,  exerted themselves to disappoint that party of the favor and indulgence  to which, from their recent merits in "]]]
