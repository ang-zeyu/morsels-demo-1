Again the old men were assembled    and two demons came among them and the old men took the great Baho    and the nwelas and chased them away. When they were returning, and    were not far north from, their village, they met the Lenbaki    (Cane-Flute, a religious society still maintained) of the Horn    family. The old men would not allow them to come in until Másauwu    appeared and declared them to be good Hopituh. So they built houses    adjoining ours and that made a fine, large village. Then other    Hopituh came in from time to time, and our people would say, \"Build    here, or build there,\" and portioned the land among the new comers.        [Footnote 2: The term by which the Tusayan Indians proper designate      themselves. This term does not include the inhabitants of the      village of Tewa or Hano, who are called Hanomuh.]    The site of the first Snake house in the valley, mentioned in the  foregoing legend, is now barely to be discerned, and the people refuse  to point out the exact spot. It is held as a place of votive offerings  during the ceremony of the Snake dance, and, as its name, Bátni,  implies, certain rain-fetiches are deposited there in small jars buried  in the ground. The site of the village next occupied can be quite easily  distinguished, and is now called Kwetcap tutwi, ash heap terrace, and  this was the village to which the name Walpi was first applied--a term  meaning the place at the notched mesa, in allusion to a broad gap in the  stratum of sandstone on the summit of the mesa, and by which it can be  distinguished from a great distance. The ground plan of this early Walpi  can still be partly traced, indicating the former existence of an  extensive village of clustering, little-roomed houses, with thick walls  constructed of small stones.    The advent of the Lenbaki is still commemorated by a biennial ceremony,  and is celebrated on the year alternating with their other biennial  ceremony, the Snake dance.    The Horn people, to which the Lenbaki belonged, have a legend of coming  from a mountain range in the east.      Its peaks were always snow covered, and the trees were always green.    From the hillside the plains were seen, over which roamed the deer,    the antelope, and the bison, feeding on never-failing grasses.    Twining through these plains were streams of bright water, beautiful    to look upon. A place where none but those who were of our people    ever gained access.      [Illustration: Plate IV. Awatubi (Talla-Hogan), plan.]    This description suggests some region of the head-waters of the Rio  Grande. Like the Snake people, they tell of a protracted migration, not  of continuous travel, for they remained for many seasons in one place,  where they would plant and build permanent houses. One of these halting  places is described as a canyon with high, steep walls, in which was a  flowing stream; this, it is said, was the Tségi (the Navajo name for  Canyon de Chelly). Here they built a large house in a cavernous recess,  high up in the canyon wall. They tell of devoting two years[3] to ladder  making and cutting and pecking shallow holes up the steep rocky side by  which to mount to the cavern, and three years more were employed in  building the house. While this work was in progress part of the men were  planting gardens, and the women and children were gathering stones. But  no adequate reason is given for thus toiling to fit this impracticable  site for occupation; the footprints of Másauwu, which they were  following, led them there.        [Footnote 3: The term yasuna, translated here as \"year,\" is of      rather indefinite significance; it sometimes means thirteen moons      and in other instances much longer periods.]    The legend goes on to tell that after they had lived there for a long  time a stranger happened to stray in their vicinity, who proved to be a  Hopituh, and said that he lived in the south. After some stay he left  and was accompanied by a party of the \"Horn,\" who were to visit the land  occupied by their kindred Hopituh and return with an account of them;  but they never came back. After waiting a long time another band was  sent, who returned and said that the first emissaries had found wives  and had built houses on the brink of a beautiful canyon, not far from  the other Hopituh dwellings. After this many of the Horns grew  dissatisfied with their cavern home, dissensions arose, they left their  home, and finally they reached Tusayan. They lived at first in one of  the canyons east of the villages, in the vicinity of Keam's Canyon, and  some of the numerous ruins on its brink mark the sites of their early  houses. There seems to be no legend distinctly attaching any particular  ruin to the Horn people, although there is little doubt that the Snake  and the Horn were the two first peoples who came to the neighborhood of  the present villages. The Bear people were the next, but they arrived as  separate branches, and from opposite directions, although of the same  Hopituh stock. It has been impossible to obtain directly the legend of  the Bears from the west. The story of the Bears from the east tells of  encountering the Fire people, then living about 25 miles east from  Walpi; but these are now extinct, and nearly all that is known of them  is told in the Bear legend, the gist of which is as follows:    The Bears originally lived among the mountains of the east, not far  distant from the Horns. Continual quarrels with neighboring villages  brought on actual fighting, and the Bears left that region and traveled  westward. As with all the other people, they halted, built houses, and  planted, remaining stationary for a long while; this occurred at  different places along their route.    A portion of these people had wings, and they flew in advance to survey  the land, and when the main body were traversing an arid region they  found water for them. Another portion had claws with which they dug  edible roots, and they could also use them for scratching hand and foot  holes in the face of a steep cliff. Others had hoofs, and these carried  the heaviest burdens; and some had balls of magic spider web, which they  could use on occasion for ropes, and they could also spread the web and  use it as a mantle, rendering the wearer invisible when he apprehended  danger.    They too came to the Tségi (Canyon de Chelly), where they found houses  but no people, and they also built houses there. While living there a  rupture occurred, a portion of them separating and going far to the  westward. These seceding bands are probably that branch of the Bears who  claim their origin in the west. Some time after this, but how long after  is not known, a plague visited the canyon, and the greater portion of  the people moved away, but leaving numbers who chose to remain. They  crossed the Chinli valley and halted for a short time at a place a short  distance northeast from Great Willow water (\"Eighteen Mile Spring\").  They did not remain there long, however, but moved a few miles farther  west, to a place occupied by the Fire people who lived in a large oval  house. The ruin of this house still stands, the walls from 5 to 8 feet  high, and remarkable from the large-sized blocks of stone used in their  construction; it is still known to the Hopituh as Tebvwúki, the  Fire-house. Here some fighting occurred, and the Bears moved westward  again to the head of Antelope (Jeditoh) Canyon, about 4 miles from  Keam's Canyon and about 15 miles east from Walpi. They built there a  rambling cluster of small-roomed houses, of which the ground plan has  now become almost obliterated. This ruin is called by the Hopituh \"the  ruin at the place of wild gourds.\" They seem to have occupied this  neighborhood for a considerable period, as mention is made of two or  three segregations, when groups of families moved a few miles away and  built similar house clusters on the brink of that canyon.      [Illustration: Plate V. Standing walls of Awatubi.]    The Fire-people, who, some say, were of the Horn people, must have  abandoned their dwelling at the Oval House or must have been driven out  at the time of their conflict with the Bears, and seem to have traveled  directly to the neighborhood of Walpi. The Snakes allotted them a place  to build in the valley on the east side of the mesa, and about two miles  north from the gap. A ridge of rocky knolls and sand dunes lies at the  foot of the mesa here, and close to the main cliff is a spring. There  are two prominent knolls about 400 yards apart and the summits of these  are covered with traces of house walls; also portions of walls can be  discerned on all the intervening hummocks. The place is known as  Sikyátki, the yellow-house, from the color of the sandstone of which the  houses were built. These and other fragmentary bits have walls not over  a foot thick, built of small stones dressed by rubbing, and all laid in  mud; the inside of the walls also show a smooth coating of mud plaster.  The dimensions of the rooms are very small, the largest measuring 9½  feet long, by 4½ feet wide. It is improbable that any of these  structures were over two stories high, and many of them were built in  excavated places around the rocky summits of the knolls. In these  instances no rear wall was built; the partition walls, radiating at  irregular angles, abut against the rock itself. Still, the great numbers  of these houses, small as they were, must have been far more than the  Fire-people could have required, for the oval house which they abandoned  measures not more than a hundred feet by fifty. Probably other incoming  gentes, of whom no story has been preserved, had also the ill fate to  build there, for the Walpi people afterward slew all its inhabitants.    There is little or no detail in the legends of the Bear people as to  their life in Antelope Canyon; they can now distinguish only"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19870"],[0,"Illuminated Manuscripts (#5)"],[1,"h,  inaccurate, and harsh. The method is of the kind called _gouache_,  _i.e._ the colours are applied thickly in successive couches or layers,  probably by means of white of egg diluted with fig-tree sap, and  finished in the high lights with touches of gold (Palæograph. Soc., pl.  114, 117). This finishing with touches of gold brings the work within  the range of illumination. There is, indeed, wanting the additional  ornamentation of the initial letter which would bring it fully into the  class of mediæval work; but, such as it is, it may fairly claim to be  suggestive of the future art. Indeed, certain points in the MS.  3225--viz. that Zeus is always red and Venus fair, that certain costumes  and colours of drapery are specially appropriated--would lead to the  supposition that even then there existed a code of rules like those of  the Byzantine Guide, and that therefore the art owed its origin to the  Greeks.    Between this MS. and the first known Christian book work there may have  been many that have now perished, and which, had they remained, would  have marked the transition more gradually. But even as they stand there  is no appreciable difference between the earliest monuments of Christian  art and those of the period which preceded them. Nor shall we find any  break, any distinct start on new principles. It is one continuous series  of processes--the gradual change of methods growing out of experience  alone--not owing to any change of religion or the adoption of a new set  of theological opinions. Of course we shall find that for a very long  time the preponderance of illuminated MSS. will be towards liturgical  works; and we shall also find that where the contents of the MS. are the  same the subjects taken for illustration are also selected according to  some fixed and well-known set of rules. We shall see the explanation of  this by-and-by.    The first example of a Christian illuminated MS. is one containing  portions of the Book of Genesis in Greek preserved in the Imperial  Library at Vienna. It is a mere fragment, only twenty-six leaves of  purple vellum--that is, bearing the imperial stain--yet it contains  eighty-eight pictures. We call them miniatures, but we must remember  that by \"miniator\" a Roman bookseller would not understand what we call  a miniaturist; and, as we have said, the word \"illuminator\" was not then  known.    This Vienna Genesis is not introduced among illuminated books,  therefore, because of its miniatures--pictures we prefer to call  them--but because the text is nearly all written in _gold_ and _silver_  letters. The pictures, according to the Greek manner, are placed in  little square frames. They were executed, no doubt, by a professional  painter, not without technical skill and not hampered by monastic  restrictions. The symbolism which underlies all early art is here shown  in the allegorical figures (such as we shall meet with again in later  Byzantine work), which are introduced to interpret the scene. We see the  same thing in the catacombs. Being a relic of great importance, this  Genesis codex has been often described and examples given of its  pictures. Of course, in a little manual like the present we cannot  pretend to exhibit the literature of our subject. We can scarcely do  more than refer the reader to a single source. In this case perhaps we  cannot do better than send the inquirer to the Victoria and Albert  Museum at South Kensington.    If we select another MS. of this early period it is the one which may be  said to be the oldest existing MS. in which the ornamentation is worthy  of as much notice as the pictures. We refer to the Collection of  Treatises by Greek physicians on plants, fishing, the chase, and kindred  matters in the same library as the Genesis fragment. It goes under the  name of \"Dioscorides,\" who was one of the authors, and dates from the  beginning of the sixth century. The Genesis is a century older.  Engravings from the Dioscorides are given in Labarte's _Arts  industriels, etc._, pl. 78, and in Louandre's _Arts somptuaires, etc._,  i., pl. 2, 3.    Enough has been said on these earlier centuries to show quite clearly  the character of the art known as Early Christian. It is simply a  continuation of such art as had existed from classical times, and had,  in fact, passed from the Greeks, who were artists, to the Romans, who  were rarely better than imitators. It is carried on to the period when  it again is nourished by Greek ideas in the Later Empire, and once more  attains distinction in the splendid revival of art under the Emperor  Justinian.    NOTE.--Julius Capitolinus, in his Life of the exquisite Emperor Maximin,  junior, mentions that the emperor's mother[8] made him a present of a  copy of the poems of Homer, written in golden letters on purple[9]  vellum. This is the earliest recorded instance of such a book in  Christian times. Its date would be about 235 A.D.    [8] Quædam parens sua.    [9] Purpureos libros.          CHAPTER V    BYZANTINE ILLUMINATION    The rebuilding of the city of Byzantium the beginning of Byzantine  art--Justinian's fondness for building and splendour--Description of  Paul the Silentiary--Sumptuous garments--The Gospel-book of  Hormisdas--Characteristics of Byzantine work--Comparative scarcity of  examples--Rigidity of Byzantine rules of art--Periods of Byzantine  art--Examples--Monotony and lifelessness of the style.      The signal event which gave birth to mediæval illumination, or rather to  the ideas which were thereby concentrated upon the production of  magnificent books, was the rebuilding of the Imperial Palace and the  Basilica of Constantine, henceforward to be known as the Church of  Sancta Sophia, or the Divine Wisdom, at Byzantium. The Emperor Justinian  had been reigning six years when a terrific fire, caused by the  conflicts between the various seditions, called Circus factions, of the  time, almost entirely destroyed not only his own palace and the great  Christian church adjoining it, but the city of Constantinople itself. So  important a scheme of reconstruction had probably never been forced upon  a government since the great fire in Rome under Nero. Justinian, whose  early training had been of the most economical kind, and whose  disposition seemed to be rather inclined to parsimony than extravagance,  now came out in his true character. For various reasons he had hitherto  studiously concealed his master-passion; but this catastrophe of the  fire, which seemed at first so disastrous, was really a stroke of  fortune. It afforded the hitherto frugal sovereign the chance he had  long waited for of spending without stint the hoarded savings of his two  miserly predecessors, and gratifying his own tastes for magnificent  architecture and splendour of apparel.    Not only Asia, with its wealth of gold and gems, but all the known world  capable of supplying material for the reconstructions, were called upon,  and ivory, marbles, mosaics, lamps, censers, candelabra, chalices,  ciboria, crosses, furniture, fittings, pictures--in short, everything  that his own taste and the experience of four or five of the ablest  architects of the time could suggest--administered to the gorgeous, the  unspeakable splendour of the new edifices and their furniture.    Paul the Silentiary, an eye-witness of the whole proceeding, has left a  description in verse, and the accurate Du Fresne in prose, which enable  us easily to trace how the Roman city of Constantine became transformed  into the semi-oriental Byzantium of Justinian. During the two centuries  which had elapsed since the days of the first Christian emperor many  foreign luxuries had found their way into the Eastern capital. Byzantine  jewellery and Byzantine silks were already famous. The patterns on the  latter were not merely floral or geometrical, but four-footed animals,  birds, and scenes from outdoor sports formed part of the embellishment,  which, therefore, must have taken the place occupied in later times by  the tapestries of Arras and Fontainebleau.    Hitherto the Byzantines had imported their silks from Persia. After the  rebuilding of the Basilica, Justinian introduced silk-culture into  Greece. The garments ridiculed by Asterius, Bishop of Amasia, in the  fourth century, were repeated in the sixth century. \"When men,\" says he,  \"appear in the streets thus dressed, the passers-by look at them as at  painted walls. Their clothes are pictures which little children point  out to one another. The saintlier sort wear likenesses of Christ, the  Marriage of Galilee...and Lazarus raised from the dead.\"    On the robe of the Empress Theodora--the wife of Justinian, who is shown  in one of the mosaics of St. Vitale at Ravenna as presenting rich gifts  to that church--there is embroidered work along the border, showing the  Adoration of the Magi. _Theodora pia_ was one among the many rôles  played by that all-accomplished actress; but this seems to have been  after her death. Like Lucrezia Borgia, perhaps, she was better than her  reputation. With such surroundings liturgical books could not have  existed without sharing in the universal luxury of enrichment. And, in  point of fact, we still have records of such books. While Justinian  reigned in Byzantium it happened that Hormisdas, a native of Frosinone,  was Pope of Rome. He was a zealous eradicator of heresy (especially of  the Eutychian and Manichæan), and in recognition of his services in this  direction the Greek Emperor, with his thanks, sent him a great  Gospel-book richly decorated, no doubt, with those splendid Eusebian  canons and portraits of the Evangelists, the like of which we see in the  Byzantine examples still preserved at Paris, in London, and elsewhere.  Plates of beaten gold, studded with gems, formed the covers of the  Gospel-book of Hormisdas.    Nor was this sumptuous volume the only, or even a rare, example of its  kind.
