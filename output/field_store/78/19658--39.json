Heard tell as how they have 'em that same trouble down Texas  way--\"    \"But I don't come from the border country.\"    \"Well, Texas sure is a great big piece o' country, so maybe you don't know  'bout them river tricks. Wet hosses--they's hosses what is run off up here,  driven down to th' border where they's swapped for hosses what some Mex  _bandidos_ have thrown a sticky loop over. Then th' Mexes take them Anglo  hosses south an' sell 'em, where their brands ain't gonna git nobody into  noose trouble. An' th' stolen Mex hosses, they's drove up here an' maybe  sold to some of th' same fellas what lost th' others. Hosses git  themselves lost 'long them back-country trails, specially if they's pushed  hard. So them strays join up with th' wild ones. Iffen a mustanger can  rope him one an' bring it in ... well, if it's a good one, maybe so he'll  git a reward from th' man what's lost him. Heard tell that _Don_ Cazar,  he's set some good rewards on a coupla studs as was run off th' Range this  summer.\"    \"_Don_ Cazar has good horses?\"    \"'Bout th' best in these here parts. He runs 'em on th' Range th' old  style--stud an' twenty--twenty-five mares together in a _manada_, all one  color to a band. They sure is a grand sight: band o' roans, then one o'  duns, an' some blacks. He's got one _manada_ all of grullas. Sells some to  th' army, drives more clear to Californy. An' th' old _Dons_ down in  Sonora come up once in a while to pick them out some fancy saddle stock.  He sure would enjoy seem' these grays o' yours. Iffen you ever want to  sell, _Don_ Cazar'd give you top price.\"    \"But I'm not sellin'.\" Drew folded the piece of paper he had been waving  to dry the ink and put it back in the belt pocket. \"What's that?\"    He could almost believe he heard an army bugle, but the call it sounded  was unlike any cavalry signal he had known. Callie was already on his way  to the door.    \"Wagon train's comin'!\" he cried as he ran out.    Drew lingered by Shadow's box. The filly was resting in the straw, her  match-stick legs folded under her, and the mare was munching the extra  feed of oats the Kentuckian had tipped in for her. He could hear the sound  of other running feet outside. It would seem that all Tubacca was turning  out to welcome the wagon train of traders from the south. Drew's curiosity  got the better of him. He went on out to the plaza.            3      Only a well-armed and convoyed set of wagons with a highly experienced and  competent master could dare travel the Apache-infested trails these days.  The first of the freighters, pulled by a sixteen-mule team, fairly burst  into the plaza, outriders fanning about it. One of the mounted men was  dressed in fringed buckskin, his shoulder-length hair and bushy black  beard the badge of a frontier already passing swiftly into history. He  rode a big black mule and carried a long-barreled rifle, not in the saddle  boot, but resting across the horn as if even here in Tubacca there might  be reason for instant action.    The mule trotted on to the middle of the plaza. Then the weapon pointed  skyward as its owner fired into the air, voicing a whoop as wild as the  Rebel Yell from the throat of a charging Texas trooper.    He was answered by cries and shouts from the gathering crowd as five more  wagons, each with a trailer hooked to its main bulk, pulled in around the  edge of the open area, until the center of the town was full and the din  of braying mules was deafening.    Drew retreated to the roofed entrance of the Four Jacks. The extra step of  height there enabled him to get a good look at two more horsemen pushing  past the end wagon. Both wore the dress of Mexican gentlemen, their short  jackets glinting with silver braid and embroidery; their bridles, horse  gear, and saddles were rich in scrolls and decorations of the same metal.  Navajo blankets lay under the saddles, and serapes were folded over the  shoulder of one rider, tied behind the cantle of the other.    They pulled up before the cantina, and one man took the reins of both  mounts. If the riders' clothing and horse furnishings were colorful, the  horses themselves were equally striking. One was a chestnut, a warm,  well-groomed red. But the other ... Drew stared. In all his years about  the stables and breeding farms of Kentucky, and throughout his travels  since, he had never seen a horse like this. Its coat was pure gold, a  perfect match to one of the eagles in his money belt. But the silky locks  of mane and tail were night black. Its breeding was plainly Arab, and it  walked with a delicate pride as gracefully as a man might foot a dance  measure.    Drew had a difficult time breaking his gaze from the horse to the man  dismounting. The ranchero was tall, perhaps an inch or so taller than  Drew, and his body had the leanness of the men who worked the range  country, possessing, too, a lithe youthfulness of carriage. Until one  looked directly into his sun-browned face he could pass as a man still in  his late twenties.    But he was older, perhaps a decade older than that, Drew thought. Too high  and prominent cheekbones with slight hollows below them, and a mouth tight  set, made more for strength of will and discipline of feeling than  conventional good looks. Yet his was a face not easily forgotten, once  seen. Black hair was pepper-salted for a finger-wide space above his ears,  which were fronted by long sideburns, and black brows were straight above  dark eyes. In spite of his below-the-border dress and his coloring, he was  unmistakably Anglo, just as the man looping both horses' reins to the rack  was Mexican.    \"So, you're still wearing your hair in good order? No trouble this trip?\"  Topham had come to the door of the cantina, his hand outstretched.  \"Welcome back, Hunt!\"    \"Paugh!\" The Mexican spat. \"Where is there one Indio who is able to face  _Don_ Cazar on his own ground? The folly of that they learned long ago.\"    _Don_ Cazar smiled. That mask of aloofness was wiped away as if he were  ten years younger and twenty years less responsible than he had been only  seconds earlier. \"And if they did not beware our rifles, Bartolome here  would talk them to death! Is that not so, _amigo_?\" His speech was oddly  formal, as if he were using a language other than his own, but there was a  warmth to the tone which matched that sudden and surprising smile.    Topham's arm went about the shoulders under the black-and-silver jacket,  drawing _Don_ Cazar into the light, music, and excitement of the cantina.  While Drew watched, the stouter back of Bartolome cut off his first good  look at his father.    So ... _that_ was _Don_ Cazar--Hunt Rennie! Drew did not know what he had  expected of their first meeting. Now he could not understand why he felt  so chilled and lost. He had planned it this way--no demands, no claims on a  stranger, freedom to make the decision of when or how he would see his  father; that was the only path he could take. But now he turned slowly  away from that open door, the light, the laughter and singing, and walked  back toward the stable, loneliness cutting into him.    Tubacca had slumbered apathetically before; now the town was wide awake.  In a couple of days the wagon train would head on north to Tucson, but now  the activity in the plaza was a mixture of market day and fiesta. Small  traders from Sonora took advantage of the protection afforded by _Don_  Cazar's outriders and had trailed along with their own products, now being  spread out and hawked.    Parrots shrieked from homemade cages; brightly woven fabrics were draped  to catch the eye. As he wandered about viewing cactus syrup, sweet, brown  panocha-candy, fruit, dried meat, blankets, saddles, Drew was again aware  of the almost strident color of this country. He fingered appreciatively a  horn goblet carved with intricate figures of gods his Anglo eyes did not  recognize. The hum of voices, the bray of mules, the baa-ing and naa-ing  of sheep and goats, kept up a roar to equal surf on a seacoast. Afternoon  was fast fading into evening, but Tubacca, aroused from the post-noon  siesta, was in tumult.    A fighting cock tethered to a cart wheel stretched its neck to the utmost  in an attempt to peck at Drew's spurs. He laughed, attracted, wrenched out  of his own private world. The smell of spicy foods, of fruit, of animals  and people ... the clamor ... the sights....    Drew rounded one end of a wagon and stepped abruptly into yet another  world and time. All the stories which had been dinned warningly into his  ears since he had left the Mississippi now brought his hand to one of the  Colts at his belt. Most of the half-dozen men squatting on their heels  about a fire were three-quarters bare, showing dusty, brown bodies. Two  had dirty calico shirts loose above hide breech-clouts. Dark-brown eyes,  as unreadable as Johnny Shannon's, surveyed Drew, but none of the Indians  moved or spoke.    Common sense took over, and Drew's hand dropped from the gun butt.  Hostiles would not be camping peacefully here in the heart of town. He  could not be facing wild Apaches or Navajos. But they were the first  Indians he had seen this close since he had ridden out of Texas.    \"Somethin' buggin' you, boy?\"    Drew's war-trained muscles took over. He was in a half crouch, the Colt  flipped over and out, pointing into the shadows where the newcomer  emerged. Then the Kentuckian flushed and slammed his weapon back into the  holster. This was the buckskinned man who had whooped the train into town  that morning.    \"Mite quick to show your iron, ain't you?\" There was a chill in the  question, and Drew saw that the long rifle was still held at alert by its  owner.    \"Cat-footin' up on a man ought to make you expect somethin' of a  reception,\" Drew countered.    \"Yep, guess some men has sure got 'em a bellyful of lead doin'"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20842"],[0,"Dreams (#5)"],[1,"made for a very different purpose.  Muensterberg wrote the words correctly; they were, besides, not common  phrases; they were isolated words taken by chance. Here again the word  was exposed during the time too short for it to be entirely perceived.  Now, while the observer was looking at the written word, some one spoke  in his ear another word of a very different significance. This is what  happened: the observer declared that he had seen a word which was not  the written word, but which resembled it in its general form, and which  besides recalled, by its meaning, the word which was spoken in his ear.  For example, the word written was \"tumult\" and the word spoken was  \"railroad.\" The observer read \"tunnel.\" The written word was \"Trieste\"  and the spoken word was the German \"Verzweiflung\" (despair). The  observer read \"Trost,\" which signifies \"consolation.\" It is as if the  word \"railroad,\" pronounced in the ear, wakened, without our knowing it,  hopes of conscious realization in a crowd of memories which have some  relationship with the idea of \"railroad\" (car, rail, trip, etc.). But  this is only a hope, and the memory which succeeds in coming into  consciousness is that which the actually present sensation had already  begun to realize.    Such is the mechanism of true perception, and such is that of the dream.  In both cases there are, on one hand, real impressions made upon the  organs of sense, and upon the other memories which encase themselves in  the impression and profit by its vitality to return again to life.    But, then, what is the essential difference between perceiving and  dreaming? What is sleep? I do not ask, of course, how sleep can be  explained physiologically. That is a special question, and besides is  far from being settled. I ask what is sleep psychologically; for our  mind continues to exercise itself when we are asleep, and it exercises  itself as we have just seen on elements analogous to those of waking, on  sensations and memories; and also in an analogous manner combines them.  Nevertheless we have on the one hand normal perception, and on the other  the dream. What is the difference, I repeat? What are the psychological  characteristics of the sleeping state?    We must distrust theories. There are a great many of them on this point.  Some say that sleep consists in isolating oneself from the external  world, in closing the senses to outside things. But we have shown that  our senses continue to act during sleep, that they provide us with the  outline, or at least the point of departure, of most of our dreams. Some  say: \"To go to sleep is to stop the action of the superior faculties of  the mind,\" and they talk of a kind of momentary paralysis of the higher  centers. I do not think that this is much more exact. In a dream we  become no doubt _indifferent_ to logic, but not _incapable_ of logic.  There are dreams when we reason with correctness and even with subtlety.  I might almost say, at the risk of seeming paradoxical, that the mistake  of the dreamer is often in reasoning too much. He would avoid the  absurdity if he would remain a simple spectator of the procession of  images which compose his dream. But when he strongly desires to explain  it, his explanation, intended to bind together incoherent images, can be  nothing more than a bizarre reasoning which verges upon absurdity. I  recognize, indeed, that our superior intellectual faculties are relaxed  in sleep, that generally the logic of a dreamer is feeble enough and  often resembles a mere parody of logic. But one might say as much of all  of our faculties during sleep. It is then not by the abolition of  reasoning, any more than by the closing of the senses, that we  characterize dreaming.    Something else is essential. We need something more than theories. We  need an intimate contact with the facts. One must make the decisive  experiment upon oneself. It is necessary that on coming out of a dream,  since we cannot analyze ourselves in the dream itself, we should watch  the transition from sleeping to waking, follow upon the transition as  closely as possible, and try to express by words what we experience in  this passage. This is very difficult, but may be accomplished by forcing  the attention. Permit, then, the writer to take an example from his own  personal experience, and to tell of a recent dream as well as what was  accomplished on coming out of the dream.    Now the dreamer dreamed that he was speaking before an assembly, that he  was making a political speech before a political assembly. Then in the  midst of the auditorium a murmur rose. The murmur augmented; it became a  muttering. Then it became a roar, a frightful tumult, and finally there  resounded from all parts timed to a uniform rhythm the cries, \"Out!  Out!\" At that moment he wakened. A dog was baying in a neighboring  garden, and with each one of his \"Wow-wows\" one of the cries of \"Out!  Out!\" seemed to be identical. Well, here was the infinitesimal moment  which it is necessary to seize.    The waking ego, just reappearing, should turn to the dreaming ego, which  is still there, and, during some instants at least, hold it without  letting it go. \"I have caught you at it! You thought it was a crowd  shouting and it was a dog barking. Now, I shall not let go of you until  you tell me just what you were doing!\" To which the dreaming ego would  answer, \"I was doing nothing; and this is just where you and I differ  from one another. You imagine that in order to hear a dog barking, and  to know that it is a dog that barks, you have nothing to do. That is a  great mistake. You accomplish, without suspecting it, a considerable  effort. You take your entire memory, all your accumulated experience,  and you bring this formidable mass of memories to converge upon a  single point, in such a way as to insert exactly in the sounds you heard  that one of your memories which is the most capable of being adapted to  it. Nay, you must obtain a perfect adherence, for between the memory  that you evoke and the crude sensation that you perceive there must not  be the least discrepancy; otherwise you would be just dreaming. This  adjustment you can only obtain by an effort of the memory and an effort  of the perception, just as the tailor who is trying on a new coat pulls  together the pieces of cloth that he adjusts to the shape of your body  in order to pin them. You exert, then, continually, every moment of the  day, an enormous effort. Your life in a waking state is a life of labor,  even when you think you are doing nothing, for at every minute you have  to choose and every minute exclude. You choose among your sensations,  since you reject from your consciousness a thousand subjective  sensations which come back in the night when you sleep. You choose, and  with extreme precision and delicacy, among your memories, since you  reject all that do not exactly suit your present state. This choice  which you continually accomplish, this adaptation, ceaselessly renewed,  is the first and most essential condition of what is called common  sense. But all this keeps you in a state of uninterrupted tension. You  do not feel it at the moment, any more than you feel the pressure of the  atmosphere, but it fatigues you in the long run. Common sense is very  fatiguing.    \"So, I repeat, I differ from you precisely in that I do nothing. The  effort that you give without cessation I simply abstain from giving. In  place of attaching myself to life, I detach myself from it. Everything  has become indifferent to me. I have become disinterested in everything.  To sleep is to become disinterested. One sleeps to the exact extent to  which he becomes disinterested. A mother who sleeps by the side of her  child will not stir at the sound of thunder, but the sigh of the child  will wake her. Does she really sleep in regard to her child? We do not  sleep in regard to what continues to interest us.    \"You ask me what it is that I do when I dream? I will tell you what you  do when you are awake. You take me, the me of dreams, me the totality of  your past, and you force me, by making me smaller and smaller, to fit  into the little circle that you trace around your present action. That  is what it is to be awake. That is what it is to live the normal  psychical life. It is to battle. It is to will. As for the dream, have  you really any need that I should explain it? It is the state into which  you naturally fall when you let yourself go, when you no longer have the  power to concentrate yourself upon a single point, when you have ceased  to will. What needs much more to be explained is the marvelous mechanism  by which at any moment your will obtains instantly, and almost  unconsciously, the concentration of all that you have within you upon  one and the same point, the point that interests you. But to explain  this is the task of normal psychology, of the psychology of waking, for  willing and waking are one and the same thing.\"    This is what the dreaming ego would say. And it would tell us a great  many other things still if we could let it talk freely. But let us sum  up briefly the essential difference which separates a dream from the  waking state. In the dream the same faculties are exercised as during  waking, but they are in a state of tension in the one case, and of  relaxation in the other. The dream consists of the entire mental life  minus the tension, the effort and the bodily movement. We perceive  still, we remember still, we reason still. All this can abound in the  dream; for abundance, in the domain of the mind, does not mean effort.  What requires an effort is the precision of adjustment. To connect the  sound of a barking dog with the memory of a crowd that murmurs and  shouts requires no effort. But in order that this sound should be  perceived as the barking of a dog, a positive effort must be made. It is  this force that the dreamer lacks. It is"]]]
