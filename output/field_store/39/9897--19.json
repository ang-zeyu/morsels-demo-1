Captain Blessington  presided; and next him, on either hand, were the first in seniority,  the two junior occupying the lowest places. The demeanour of the  several officers, serious and befitting the duty they were met to  perform, was rendered more especially solemn from the presence of the  governor, who sat a little to the right of the president, and without  the circle, remained covered, and with his arms folded across his  chest. At a signal given by the president to the orderly in waiting,  that individual disappeared from the room, and soon afterwards Frank  Halloway, strongly ironed, as on the preceding night, was ushered in by  several files of the guard, under Ensign Fortescue himself.    The prisoner having been stationed a few paces on the left of the  president, that officer stood up to administer the customary oath. His  example was followed by the rest of the court, who now rose, and  extending each his right hand upon the prayer book, repeated, after the  president, the form of words prescribed by military law. They then,  after successively touching the sacred volume with their lips, once  more resumed their seats at the table.    The prosecutor was the Adjutant Lawson, who now handed over to the  president a paper, from which the latter officer read, in a clear and  distinct voice, the following charges, viz.--    \"1st. For having on the night of the --th September 1763, while on duty  at the gate of the Fortress of Detroit, either admitted a stranger into  the garrison himself, or suffered him to obtain admission, without  giving the alarm, or using the means necessary to ensure his  apprehension, such conduct being treasonable, and in breach of the  articles of war.    \"2d. For having been accessary to the abduction of Captain Frederick de  Haldimar and private Harry Donellan, the disappearance of whom from the  garrison can only be attributed to a secret understanding existing  between the prisoner and the enemy without the walls, such conduct  being treasonable, and in breach of the articles of war.\"    \"Private Frank Halloway,\" continued Captain Blessington, after having  perused these two short but important charges, \"you have heard what has  been preferred against you; what say you, therefore? Are you guilty, or  not guilty?\"    \"Not guilty,\" firmly and somewhat exultingly replied the prisoner,  laying his hand at the same time on his swelling heart.    \"Stay, sir,\" sternly observed the governor, addressing the president;  \"you have not read ALL the charges.\"    Captain Blessington took up the paper from the table, on which he had  carelessly thrown it, after reading the accusations above detailed, and  perceived, for the first time, that a portion had been doubled back.  His eye now glanced over a third charge, which had previously escaped  his attention.    \"Prisoner,\" he pursued, after the lapse of a minute, \"there is a third  charge against you, viz. for having, on the night of the --th Sept.  1763, suffered Captain De Haldimar to unclose the gate of the fortress,  and, accompanied by his servant, private Harry Donellan, to pass your  post without the sanction of the governor, such conduct being in direct  violation of a standing order of the garrison, and punishable with  death.\"    The prisoner started. \"What!\" he exclaimed, his cheek paling for the  first time with momentary apprehension; \"is this voluntary confession  of my own to be turned into a charge that threatens my life? Colonel de  Haldimar, is the explanation which I gave you only this very hour, and  in private, to be made the public instrument of my condemnation? Am I  to die because I had not firmness to resist the prayer of my captain  and of your son, Colonel de Haldimar?\"    The president looked towards the governor, but a significant motion of  the head was the only reply; he proceeded,--    \"Prisoner Halloway, what plead you to this charge? Guilty, or not  guilty?\"    \"I see plainly,\" said Halloway, after the pause of a minute, during  which he appeared to be summoning all his energies to his aid; \"I see  plainly that it is useless to strive against my fate. Captain de  Haldimar is not here, and I must die. Still I shall not have the  disgrace of dying as a traitor, though I own I have violated the orders  of the garrison.\"    \"Prisoner,\" interrupted Captain Blessington, \"whatever you may have to  urge, you had better reserve for your defence. Meanwhile, what answer  do you make to the last charge preferred?--Are you guilty, or not  guilty?\"    \"Guilty,\" said Halloway, in a tone of mingled pride and sorrow, \"guilty  of having listened to the earnest prayer of my captain, and suffered  him, in violation of my orders, to pass my post. Of the other charges I  am innocent.\"    The court listened with the most profound attention and interest to the  words of the prisoner, and they glanced at each other in a manner that  marked their sense of the truth they attached to his declaration.    \"Halloway, prisoner,\" resumed Captain Blessington, mildly, yet  impressively; \"recollect the severe penalty which the third charge, no  less than the others, entails, and recall your admission. Be advised by  me,\" he pursued, observing his hesitation. \"Withdraw your plea, then,  and substitute that of not guilty to the whole.\"    \"Captain Blessington,\" returned the prisoner with deep emotion, \"I feel  all the kindness of your motive; and if any thing can console me in my  present situation, it is the circumstance of having presiding at my  trial an officer so universally beloved by the whole corps. Still,\" and  again his voice acquired its wonted firmness, and his cheek glowed with  honest pride, \"still, I say, I scorn to retract my words. Of the two  first charges I am as innocent as the babe unborn. To the last I plead  guilty; and vain would it be to say otherwise, since the gate was found  open while I was on duty, and I know the penalty attached to the  disobedience of orders.\"    After some further but ineffectual remonstrance on the part of the  president, the pleas of the prisoner were recorded, and the examination  commenced. Governor de Haldimar was the first witness.    That officer, having been sworn, stated, that on the preceding night he  had been intruded upon in his apartment by a stranger, who could have  obtained admission only through the gate of the fortress, by which also  he must have made good his escape. That it was evident the prisoner had  been in correspondence with their enemies; since, on proceeding to  examine the gate it had been found unlocked, while the confusion  manifested by him on being accused, satisfied all who were present of  the enormity of his guilt. Search had been made every where for the  keys, but without success.    The second charge was supported by presumptive evidence alone; for  although the governor swore to the disappearance of his son, and the  murder of his servant, and dwelt emphatically on the fact of their  having been forcibly carried off with the connivance of the prisoner,  still there was no other proof of this, than the deductions drawn from  the circumstances already detailed. To meet this difficulty, however,  the third charge had been framed.    In proof of this the governor stated, that the prisoner, on being  interrogated by him immediately subsequent to his being relieved from  his post, had evinced such confusion and hesitation, as to leave no  doubt whatever of his guilt; that, influenced by the half promise of  communication, which the court had heard as well as himself, he had  suffered the trial of the prisoner to be delayed until the present  hour, strongly hoping he might then be induced to reveal the share he  had borne in these unworthy and treasonable practices; that, with a  view to obtain this disclosure, so essential to the safety of the  garrison, he had, conjointly with Major Blackwater, visited the cell of  the prisoner, to whom he related the fact of the murder of Donellan, in  the disguise of his master's uniform, conjuring him, at the same time,  if he regarded his own life, and the safety of those who were most dear  to him, to give a clue to the solution of this mysterious circumstance,  and disclose the nature and extent of his connection with the enemy  without; that the prisoner however resolutely denied, as before, the  guilt imputed to him, but having had time to concoct a plausible story,  stated, (doubtless with a view to shield himself from the severe  punishment he well knew to be attached to his offence,) that Captain de  Haldimar himself had removed the keys from the guard-room, opened the  gate of the fortress, and accompanied by his servant, dressed in a  coloured coat, had sallied forth upon the common. \"And this,\"  emphatically pursued the governor, \"the prisoner admits he permitted,  although well aware that, by an order of long standing for the security  of the garrison, such a fragrant dereliction of his duty subjected him  to the punishment of death.\"    Major Blackwater was the next witness examined. His testimony went to  prove the fact of the gate having been found open, and the confusion  manifested by the prisoner. It also substantiated that part of the  governor's evidence on the third charge, which related to the  confession recently made by Halloway, on which that charge had been  framed.    The sergeant of the guard, and the governor's orderly having severally  corroborated the first portions of Major Blackwater's evidence, the  examination on the part of the prosecution terminated; when the  president called on the prisoner Halloway for his defence. The latter,  in a clear, firm, and collected tone, and in terms that surprised his  auditory, thus addressed the Court:--    \"Mr. President, and gentlemen,--Although, standing before you in the  capacity of a private soldier, and, oh! bitter and humiliating  reflection, in that most wretched and disgraceful of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49131"],[0,"Wings over England (#16)"],[1,"on this strange adventure? She had a horror of the sea, yet, if  she went she must be cheerful all the way. \"It's the war,\" she was  thinking. \"When there is a war we have no choice. Duty calls. We must  go.\"    Rounding a curve, a young cyclist came rushing toward her. He slowed up  when he was near. It was Brand. There was a look on his face she had  seldom seen there before.    \"Going home?\" she asked simply.    \"No. Just for a ride.\"    A question was on her lips. She did not ask it. There are times when we  do not ask questions of those we love.    \"I'm going to the village,\" she said simply. \"Perhaps I'll meet you on  the way back.\"    \"Perhaps.\" Again he was on his wheel and away.    \"Riding something down,\" she told herself. \"Something rather terrible.\"  Then, as if a chill blast had swept in from the hills, she shuddered.    At the village she came upon more tragedy. Where the shop of Old John,  the shoemaker, had stood was a pit of darkness. On a stake stuck in the  ground someone had hung a bit of black crepe. This was enough. Turning  she walked straight toward home. Her courage was now at the sticking  point. She would go on that ship with the children. It was the only  thing she could do to help. And everyone must do something.    \"Perhaps,\" she thought, \"I shall go to visit Dave's mother in Florida.\"    Florida. At once she was dreaming of soft, lapping waters, gleaming  sands, waving palm trees, and the eternal breath of spring. When one is  young it is not natural to be sad for long.    She had not gone far on her homeward jaunt when a group of school  children on their way home from school caught her eye. Their actions  amazed her. One moment they were marching along engaged in merry  chatter, the next, like a flock of birds escaping a hawk, they dashed  from the road.    At the side of the road was a deep, dry ditch. Into this the children  tumbled pell-mell. When Cherry came opposite them they were staring  open-mouthed toward the sky.    This held for a full minute. Then one pair of eyes wandered. \"Cherry!\" a  piping young voice cried. \"It's Cherry!\" A small pair of legs  disentangled themselves from the mass and a child came racing up to  Cherry. It was Tillie. In the mass, Cherry had not recognized her. Peggy  followed on her heels. Soon, one on each side of the older girl, they  were marching toward home.    \"What were you doing in that ditch,\" Cherry asked.    \"Playing war,\" was Peggy's quick response. \"It's loads of fun. We play  there is a bombing plane right overhead. One of the boys can whistle  just like the siren. You should hear him! He's wonderful! After that we  all tumble into the ditch and watch for the plane.    \"Of course,\" the little girl added thoughtfully, \"it never comes. But  perhaps some day it really will come.\"    \"Yes,\" Cherry thought. There was a tightness in her throat. \"Yes, some  day perhaps it will. And then--\"    Yes, she would go with those children to America. She must. It was her  duty.                                      _Chapter_ XVIII                            Dave's Strange Craft      That boat-like affair on which Dave climbed after a short swim from the  spot where his plane had sunk was strange indeed. Some sixteen feet long  by eight wide, it rested on the surface of the sea. It was not a boat,  for though it had a small cabin above and a large one below, it was  provided with no form of propelling power, not even oars.    The fact that struck the boy with the force of a blow was its  unquestioned Nazi origin. On its side was painted the hated cross. The  cabin below was fitted with all manner of articles for comfort and  convenience, blankets, towels, boxes of biscuits and chocolate, bottles  of soda water, all that a man could ask. Yet even here was the dreaded  swastika. It was woven into towels and blankets and stamped into the  biscuits.    \"A Jerry hotel of the sea, a one man's paradise,\" he thought.    Then, of a sudden it came to him. It was a float. He had heard of them.  They were for the benefit of Nazi airmen who fell into the sea.    \"Well,\" he sighed, \"I'm no Nazi, but I am cold and wet. So here goes!\"    After stripping off his water-soaked garments he slipped into a coarse,  heavy shirt bearing the hated insignia, a pair of blue trousers, coarse  wool socks and heavy shoes. The shoes were too large, but that did not  count.    \"Now,\" he sighed, \"what next?\"    It struck him with sudden shock that the next thing might well be a  routine visit to the float by an enemy patrol boat. After that he would  be \"Somewhere in Europe\" for the duration of the war.    Climbing to the narrow deck, he scanned the sea. A mist had settled down  over the water. There was a freshness in the air which suggested  impending storm. Here he was. Here he would stay unless--He sat down to  think.    Ten minutes later he sprang into action. There was a compass in the  lower cabin. He studied the wind, then consulted the compass.    \"O. K.,\" he muttered. \"If only--\"    On a shelf he found a hammer and a box of wooden pegs. These, he  concluded, would be for stopping up holes made by machine-gun bullets.    Taking the hammer, he began examining the floor of the lower cabin on  which he stood. The covering was, he discovered, composed of fiber. To  rip it up was but the work of minutes. And there--he uttered a sharp  exclamation of joy,--there, countersunk in the solid steel keel of this  unsailing craft, was a heavy steel nut. \"Thought so,\" he murmured.    He had reasoned that, since this float did not move it must be anchored  by a cable or chain. The cable or chain must be fastened by a  ring-headed bolt with a nut inside the float. And so it was.    Now to remove the nut and let the float go free. He blessed his stars  that from early childhood he had monkeyed with tools. A large nut, he  had discovered years ago, can be turned off simply by hammering at the  corners, thus turning it around little by little, a slow, tedious  process, but sure of success in the end.    For more than an hour, the empty world of sea and air might have heard  the patient tap--tap--tap of a hammer on steel.    Now and then he paused to listen. Only the ever-rising song of the  wind--welcome sound--greeted his ears.    Once he consulted the compass, then climbed to the upper deck to face  the wind. After that he resumed his tapping with increased speed.    At last, as a sigh escaped his lips, the nut slid to one side. At the  same instant a wave larger than all the rest tilted the float half on  its side. There came the grating sound of the threaded bolt slipping  from its place. Then a thin fountain of water spurted up.    \"Hurray! Free! We win!\" he exulted.    \"Not bad,\" he murmured as, after stopping the hole with a towel, he  wrapped himself in a blanket and stretched out for a rest.    This did not last long. He was in no mood for inaction. The battle among  the clouds had set his blood racing. His imagination was fairly running  riot. The storm was picking up, but not half fast enough. What if the  Nazis caught up with him here? They had provided the place with all  manner of comfort but no weapons. Perhaps, after all, this float had  been intended as a trap.    There was a short-wave radio in the corner. After a brief inspection he  discovered that it was both for sending and receiving. Twice his hand  was on a dial. Twice, as his fingers trembled, he removed it. He did  long to get in touch with headquarters. By this time the remnant of  their flight would be back. They would be wondering, dreading, hoping.  He could put these uncertainties to rest at least as far as he was  concerned. A few well-chosen words would assure them that he was safe  and that it was taps for the beloved Johnny.    His heart ached as he recalled his one brief glimpse of the fiddler's  smashed plane before it sank forever beneath black waters. He had seen  no sign of life. Yes, the fiddler was gone. God rest his soul.    \"But that Wick!\" he asked himself. \"What about him?\"    Yes, he thought he could get that radio going and tell the boys at  headquarters about things. But what would the Heinies be doing all that  time? Checking his location, beyond a doubt. Sending out a fast little  craft to pick him up. Oh, no! Not yet. Some things were best left alone.    After a time he made himself a cup of hot chocolate, then drank it, at  the same time munching biscuits and chocolate bar. Very thoughtful of  those Nazis to spend so much time and thought on his comfort.    There was even a checker-board and a deck of cards. He played himself a  game of checkers, then switched to solitaire. This lasted a long time.    When darkness at last settled down upon the sea, he climbed to the upper  deck. Clinging to a rail he watched the waves roll in. Seldom had he  witnessed a wilder scene. Racing clouds, racing sea and a moon that  appeared to race with them.    Once again he checked the direction of the wind. Yes, unless he had  miscalculated, he should land at last on the English coast. When? He had  no way of knowing. One thing was sure, if this storm kept up he'd know  well enough when he did arrive. One good bump would tell him that.    In the meantime? Well, tomorrow would be another day. He'd be needing  all his senses. Might as well sleep while sleeping was good. After  fastening his strange craft down good and snug for the night he rolled  up in a half dozen heavy blankets and fell asleep.                                       _Chapter_ XIX                            Thrilling Sky Drama      That night watchers on the rooftops of London, those hardy men who all  night long, with bags of sand at their side, scan the skies for bombing  planes, witnessed a moving picture against the sky that they would not  soon forget.    A few minutes after the alarm had sounded, just as Big Ben rang out the  hour of nine, the thunder of powerful motors was heard.    At this instant, far above them in the sky, "]]]
