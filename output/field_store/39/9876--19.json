Every  European traveller has some recipe of his own. One chews a  musket-bullet or a small stone. A second smears his legs with butter.  Another eats a crust of dry bread, which exacerbates the torments, and  afterwards brings relief. A fourth throws water over his face and hands  or his legs and feet; a fifth smokes, and a sixth turns his dorsal  region (raising his coat-tail) to the fire. I have always found that  the only remedy is to be patient and not to talk. The more you drink,  the more you require to drinkwater or strong waters. But after the first  two hours abstinence you have mastered the overpowering feeling of  thirst, and then to refrain is easy.  [FN#17] We carried two small brass guns, which, on the line of march,  were dismounted and placed upon camels. At the halt they were restored  to their carriages. The Badawin think much of these harmless articles,  to which I have seen a gunner apply a match thrice before he could  induce a discharge. In a moral point of view, therefore, they are far  more valuable than our twelve-pounders.  [FN#18] Hereabouts the Arabs call these places Bahr milh or Sea of Salt; in  other regions Bahr bila ma, or Waterless Sea.  [FN#19] Being but little read in geology, I submitted, after my return  to Bombay, a few specimens collected on the way, to a learned friend,  Dr. Carter, Secretary to the Bombay branch of the Royal Asiatic  Society. His name is a guarantee of accuracy.  [FN#20] The Arabic language has a copious terminology for the mineral  as well as the botanical productions of the country: with little  alteration it might be made to express all the requirements of our  modern geology.  [FN#21] NOTE TO THIRD EDITION.This country may have contained gold; but  the superficial formation has long been exhausted. At Cairo I washed  some sand brought from the eastern shore of the Red Sea, north of  Al-Wijh, and found it worth my while. I had a plan for working the  diggings, but H.B.M.s Consul, Dr. Walne, opined that gold was becoming  too plentiful, and would not assist me. This wise saying has since then  been repeated to me by men who ought to have known better than Dr.  Walne.    [p.76]CHAPTER XXV.    THE BADAWIN OF AL-HIJAZ.    THE Arab may be divided into three racesa classification which agrees  equally well with genesitic genealogy, the traditions of the country,  and the observations of modern physiologists.[FN#1]    [p.77]The first race, indigens or autochthones, are those sub-Caucasian  tribes which may still be met with in the province of Mahrah, and  generally along the coast between Maskat and Hazramaut. [FN#2] The  Mahrah, the Janabah, and the Gara especially show a low development,  for which hardship and privation alone will not satisfactorily  account.[FN#3] These are Arab al-Aribah for whose inferiority oriental  fable accounts as usual by thaumaturgy.    The principal advenæ are the Noachians, a great Chaldaean or Mesopotamian  tribe which entered Arabia about    [p.78] 2200 A.C., and by slow and gradual encroachments drove before  them the ancient owners and seized the happier lands of the Peninsula.  The great Anzah and the Nijdi families are types of this race, which is  purely Caucasian, and shows a highly nervous temperament, together with  those signs of blood which distinguish even the lower animals, the horse  and the camel, the greyhound and the goat of Arabia. These advenae  would correspond with the Arab al-Mutarribah or Arabicized Arabs of the  eastern historians.[FN#4]    The third family, an ancient and a noble race dating from A.C. 1900,  and typified in history by Ishmael, still occupies the so-called  Sinaitic Peninsula. These Arabs, however, do not, and never did, extend  beyond the limits of the mountains, where, still dwelling in the  presence of their brethren, they retain all the wild customs and the  untamable spirit of their forefathers. They are distinguished from the  pure stock by an admixture of Egyptian blood,[FN#5]    [p.79] and by preserving the ancient characteristics of the Nilotic  family. The Ishmaelities are sub-Caucasian, and are denoted in history  as the Arab al-Mustarribah, the insititious or half-caste Arab.    Oriental ethnography, which, like most Eastern sciences, luxuriates in  nomenclative distinction, recognises a fourth race under the name of  Arab al-Mustajamah. These barbarized Arabs are now represented by such a  population as that of Meccah.    That Aus and Khazraj, the Himyaritic tribes which emigrated to  Al-Hijaz, mixed with the Amalikah, the Jurham, and the Katirah, also  races from Al-Yaman, and with the Hebrews, a northern branch of the  Semitic family, we have ample historical evidence. And they who know  how immutable is race in the Desert, will scarcely doubt that the  Badawi of Al-Hijaz preserves in purity the blood transmitted to him by  his ancestors.[FN#6]    [p.80] I will not apologise for entering into details concerning the  personale of the Badawin[FN#7]; a precise physical portrait of race, it  has justly been remarked, is the sole deficiency in the pages of Bruce  and of Burckhardt.    The temperament of the Hijazi is not unfrequently the pure nervous, as  the height of the forehead and the fine texture of the hair prove.  Sometimes the bilious, and rarely the sanguine, elements predominate;  the lymphatic I never saw. He has large nervous centres, and  well-formed spine and brain, a conformation favourable to longevity.  Bartema well describes his colour as a dark leonine; it varies from the  deepest Spanish to a chocolate hue, and its varieties are attributed by  the people to blood. The skin is hard, dry, and soon wrinkled by  exposure. The xanthous complexion is rare, though not unknown in  cities, but the leucous does not exist. The crinal hair is frequently  lightened by bleaching, and the pilar is browner than the crinal. The  voice is strong and clear, but rather barytone than bass: in anger it  becomes a shrill chattering like the cry of a wild animal. The look of  a chief is dignified and grave even to pensiveness; the respectable mans  is self-sufficient and fierce; the lower orders look ferocious, stupid,  and inquisitive. Yet there is not much difference in this point between  men of the same tribe, who have similar pursuits which engender    [p.81] similar passions. Expression is the grand diversifier of  appearance among civilised people: in the Desert it knows few varieties.    The Badawi cranium is small, ooidal, long, high, narrow, and remarkable  in the occiput for the development of Galls second propensity: the crown  slopes upwards towards the region of firmness, which is elevated;  whilst the sides are flat to a fault. The hair, exposed to sun, wind,  and rain, acquires a coarseness not natural to it[FN#8]: worn in  Kurun[FN#9]ragged elf-locks,hanging down to the breast, or shaved in the  form Shushah, a skull-cap of hair, nothing can be wilder than its  appearance. The face is made to be a long oval, but want of flesh  detracts from its regularity. The forehead is high, broad, and  retreating: the upper portion is moderately developed; but nothing can  be finer than the lower brow, and the frontal sinuses stand out,  indicating bodily strength and activity of character. The temporal  fossa are deep, the bones are salient, and the elevated zygomata  combined with the lantern-jaw, often give a deaths-head appearance to the  face. The eyebrows are long, bushy, and crooked, broken, as it were, at  the angle where Order is supposed to be, and bent in sign of  thoughtfulness. Most popular writers, following De Page,[FN#10]  describe the Arab eye as large, ardent,    [p.82] and black. The Badawi of the Hijaz, and indeed the race  generally, has a small eye, round, restless, deep-set, and fiery,  denoting keen inspection with an ardent temperament and an impassioned  character. Its colour is dark brown or green-brown, and the pupil is  often speckled. The habit of pursing up the skin below the orbits, and  half closing the lids to exclude glare, plants the outer angles with  premature crows-feet. Another peculiarity is the sudden way in which the  eye opens, especially under excitement. This, combined with its fixity  of glance, forms an expression now of lively fierceness, then of  exceeding sternness; whilst the narrow space between the orbits  impresses the countenance in repose with an intelligence not destitute  of cunning. As a general rule, however, the expression of the Badawi  face is rather dignity than that cunning for which the Semitic race is  celebrated, and there are lines about the mouth in variance with the  stern or the fierce look of the brow. The ears are like those of Arab  horses, small, well-cut, castey, and elaborate, with many elevations and  depressions. The nose is pronounced, generally aquiline, but sometimes  straight like those Greek statues which have been treated as prodigious  exaggerations of the facial angle. For the most part, it is a well-made  feature with delicate nostrils, below which the septum appears: in  anger they swell and open like a blood mares. I have, however, seen, in  not a few instances, pert and offensive pugs. Deep furrows descend from  the wings of the nose, showing an uncertain temper, now too grave, then  too gay. The mouth is irregular. The lips are either bordes, denoting  rudeness and want of taste, or they form a mere line. In the latter  case there is an appearance of undue development in the upper portion  of the countenance, especially when the jaws are ascetically thin, and  the chin weakly retreats. The latter  [p.83] feature, however, is generally well and strongly made. The  teeth, as usual among Orientals, are white, even, short and  broadindications of strength. Some tribes trim their mustaches according  to the Sunnat; the Shafei often shave them, and many allow them to hang  Persian-like"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4664"],[0,"Light, Life, and Love: Selections from the German Mystics of the Middle Ages (#16)"],[1,"irit.\"    We may learn from these words that the eternal Word, our Lord Jesus  Christ, had been let down like a fishing-hook or great net, by the  Father of heaven, into the great sea of this world, that He might  catch not fish but men. Hear how He says: \"My word, that goeth forth  out of My mouth shall not return unto Me void, but shall execute  that which I please, and shall prosper in the thing whereto I send  it.\" And this net is drawn by the Father out of the salt sea, to the  peaceful shore of His fatherly heart, full of the elect, of works of  charity, of repentance, patience, humility, obedience, spiritual  exercises, merits and virtues. For Christ drew unto Himself all the  afflictions and good deeds of the good; just as St Paul says, \"I  live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.\" Even so, Christ lives in  all the good, and all who have been willing and obedient instruments  in the hands of Christ. In all such Christ lives and suffers and  works. For whatever good there is in all men, is all God's work.  Therefore Christ, feeling His Father drawing Him, gathered together  in Himself in a wonderful manner all the elect with all their works,  and commended them to His Father, saying, \"My Father, these are  Thine; these are the spoils which I have won by My conquest, by the  sword of the Cross; these are the vessels which I have purchased  with My precious blood; these are the fruits of My labours. Keep in  Thine own name those whom Thou hast given Me. I pray not that Thou  shouldest take them out of the world, but that Thou shouldest keep  them from the evil.\" Thus did Christ commend Himself and all His own  into His Father's hands. Come therefore, O faithful and devout soul,  and contemplate with great earnestness the coming in and the going  out of thy Lord Jesus; follow Him with love and longing, even to the  chamber and bed of joy, which He has prepared for thee in thy  Father's heart. Happy would he be, who could now be dissolved with  Christ, and die with the thief, and hear from the lips of the Lord  that comfortable word, \"This day shalt thou be with Me in paradise.\"  And though this is not granted to us, yet whatever we can here gain  by labours and watchings and fastings and prayers, let us commend it  all with Christ to the Father; let us pour it back again into the  fountain, whence it flowed forth for us; and let nothing be left in  us of empty self-satisfaction, no seeking after human praise or  honour or reward. But whatever our God hath been willing to do in  us, let us return it back into His own hands and say, \"We are  nothing of ourselves. It is He who made us, and not we ourselves.  All good was made by Him, and without Him was not anything made.  When therefore He taketh with Him what He made Himself, we are  absolutely nothing.\"    Lastly, Christ commended His soul into His Father's hands, to show  us how the souls of good and holy men mount up after Him to the  bosom of the eternal Father, who must otherwise have gone down to  hell; for it is He who has opened to us the way of life, and His  sacred soul, by making the journey safe and free from danger, has  been our guide into the kingdom of heaven.              SUSO            SUSO AND HIS SPIRITUAL DAUGHTER    AFTER this, certain very high thoughts arose in the mind of the  servitor's spiritual daughter, concerning which she asked him  whether she might put questions to him. He replied, Yea verily:  since thou hast been led through the proper exercises, it is  permitted to thy spiritual intelligence to enquire about high  things. Ask then whatever thou wilt. She said: Tell me, father, what  is God, and how He is both One and Three? The servitor replied,  These be indeed high questions. As to the first, What is God, you  must know that all the Doctors who ever lived cannot explain it, for  He is above all sense and reason. Yet if a man is diligent, and does  not relax his efforts, he gains some knowledge of God, though very  far off. Yet in this knowledge of God consists our eternal life and  man's supreme happiness. In this way, in former times, certain  worthy philosophers searched for God, and especially that great  thinker Aristotle, who tried to discover the Author of Nature from  the order of nature and its course. He sought earnestly, and he was  convinced from the well-ordered course of nature that there must of  necessity be one Prince and Lord of the whole universe--He whom we  call God. About this God and Lord we know this much, that He is an  immortal Substance, eternal, without before or after, simple, bare,  unchangeable, an incorporeal and essential Spirit, whose substance  is life and energy, whose most penetrating intelligence knows all  things in and by itself, whose essence in itself is an abyss of  pleasures and joys, and who is to Himself, and to all who shall  enjoy Him in a future life, a supernatural, ineffable, and most  sweet happiness. The maiden, when she heard this, looked up, and  said: These things are sweet to tell and sweet to hear, for they  rouse the heart, and lift the spirit up far beyond itself.  Therefore, father, tell me more about these things. The servitor  said: The Divine Essence, about which we speak, is an intelligible  or intellectual Substance of such a kind, that it cannot be seen in  itself by mortal eyes; but it can be discerned in its effects, even  as we recognise a fine artist by his works. As the Apostle teaches  us, \"The invisible things of God from the creation of the world are  clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made.\" For the  creatures are a kind of mirror, in which God shines. This knowledge  is called speculation, by which we contemplate the great Architect  of the world in His works. Come now, look upward and about thee,  through all the quarters of the universe, and see how wide and high  the beautiful heaven is, how swift its motion, and how marvellously  its Creator has adorned it with the seven planets, and with the  countless multitude of the twinkling stars. Consider what  fruitfulness, what riches, the sun bestows upon the earth, when in  summer it sheds abroad its rays unclouded! See how the leaves and  grass shoot up, and the flowers smile, and the woods and plains  resound with the sweet song of nightingales and other birds; how all  the little animals, after being imprisoned by grim winter, come  forth rejoicing, and pair; and how men and women, both old and  young, rejoice and are merry. O Almighty God, if Thou art so lovable  and so pleasant in Thy creatures, how happy and blessed, how full of  all joy and beauty, must Thou be in Thyself? But further, my  daughter, contemplate the elements themselves--Earth, Water, Air,  and Fire, with all the wonderful things which they contain in  infinite variety--men, beasts, birds, fishes, and sea-monsters. And  all of these give praise and honour to the unfathomable immensity  that is in Thee. Who is it, Lord, who preserves all these things,  who nourishes them? It is Thou who providest for all, each in his  own way, for great and small, rich and poor. Thou, O God, doest  this; Thou alone art God indeed! Behold, my daughter, thou hast now  found the God whom thou hast sought so long. Look up, then, with  shining eyes, with radiant face and exulting heart, behold Him and  embrace Him with the outstretched arms of thy soul and mind, and  give thanks to Him as the one and supreme Lord of all creatures. By  gazing on this mirror, there springs up speedily, in one of loving  and pious disposition, an inward jubilation of the heart; for by  this is meant a joy which no tongue can tell, though it pours with  might through heart and soul. Alas, I now feel within me, that I  must open for thee the closed mouth of my soul; and I am compelled,  for the glory of God, to tell thee certain secrets, which I never  yet told to any one. A certain Dominican, well known to me, at the  beginning of his course used to receive from God twice every day,  morning and evening, for ten years, an outpouring of grace like  this, which lasted about as long as it would take to say the \"Vigils  of the Dead\" twice over.[40] At these times he was so entirely  absorbed in God, the eternal Wisdom, that he would not speak of it.  Sometimes he would converse with God as with a friend, not with the  mouth, but mentally; at other times he would utter piteous sighs to  Him; at other times he would weep copiously, or smile silently. He  often seemed to himself to be flying in the air, and swimming  between time and eternity in the depth of the Divine wonders, which  no man can fathom. And his heart became so full from this, that he  would sometimes lay his hand upon it as it beat heavily, saying,  \"Alas, my heart, what labours will befall thee to-day?\" One day it  seemed to him that the heart of his heavenly Father was, in a  spiritual and indescribable manner, pressed tenderly, and with  nothing between, against his heart; and that the Father's  heart--that is, the eternal Wisdom, spoke inwardly to his heart  without forms.[41] Then he began to exclaim joyously in spiritual  jubilation: Behold, now, Thou whom I most fervently love, thus do I  lay bare my heart to Thee, and in simplicity and nakedness of all  created things I embrace Thy formless Godhead! O God, most excellent  of all friends! Earthly friends must needs endure to be distinct and  separate from those whom they love; but Thou, O fathomless sweetness  of all true love, meltest into the heart of Thy beloved, and pourest  Thyself fully into the essence of his soul, that nothing of Thee  remains outside, but Thou art joined and united most lovingly with  Thy beloved.    To this the maiden replied: Truly it is a great grace, when anyone  is thus caught up into God. But I should like to be informed,  whether this is the most perfect kind of union or not? The servitor  answered: No, it is not the most perfect, but a preliminary, gently  drawing a man on, that he may arrive at"]]]
