I am certainly not a  miser,--it would be difficult for me to change myself into one--and  yet the people here think me more disposed to be stingy than  prodigal; and for a beginning that will suffice. So far as pupils  are concerned I can have as many as I want; but I do not want many;  I want better pay than the others, and therefore I am content with  fewer. One must put on a few airs at the beginning or one is lost,  i.e. one must travel the common road with the many.\"    (Vienna, May 26, 1781, to his father.)    210. \"Depend confidently on me. I am no longer a fool, and you  will still less believe that I am a wicked and ungrateful son.  Meanwhile trust my brains and my good heart implicitly, and you  shall never be sorry. How should I have learned to value money? I  never had enough of it in my hands. I remember that once when I  had 20 ducats I thought myself rich. Need alone teaches the value  of money.\"    (Vienna, May 26, 1781, to his father.)    211. \"If it were possible that it should vex me I should do my  best not to notice it; as it is, thank God, there is no need of  my deceiving myself because only the opposite could vex me, and I  should have had to decline, which is always too bad when one is  dealing with a grand gentleman.\"    (Vienna, October 5, 1782, to his father. Mozart had expected to  give music lessons to a princess, but another teacher was chosen.  Continuing in the same letter, he says: \"I need only tell you his  fee and you will easily be able to judge from it the strength of  the master--400 florins. His name is Summerer.\")    212. \"I shall compose an opera but not in order, for the sake of  100 ducats, to see the theatre earn four times as much in a  fortnight. I shall perform my opera at my own cost and make at  least 1,200 florins in three performances; then the director can  have the work for 50 ducats. If he does not want it I shall have  received my pay and can utilize the opera elsewhere. I hope that  you have never observed a tendency to dishonest dealing in me.  One ought not to be a bad fellow, but neither ought one to be a  stupid who is willing to let others benefit from the work which  cost him study, care and labor, and surrender all claims for the  future.\"    (Vienna, October 5, 1782, to his father. Mozart's plans for  exploiting his opera were never realized.)    213. \"Yesterday I dined with the Countess Thun, and tomorrow I  shall dine with her again. I let her hear all that was complete;  she told me that she would wager her life that everything that I  have written up to date would please. In such matters I care  nothing for the praise or censure of anybody until the whole work  has been seen or heard; instead I follow my own judgment and  feelings.\"    (Vienna, August 8, 1781, to his father. The opera in question was  \"Die Entfuhrung aus dem Serail.\")    214. \"Magnanimity and gentleness have often reconciled the worst  enemies.\"    (Vienna, July 8, 1791, to his wife, who had somewhat rudely  repulsed the advances of one of the visitors at Baden where she  was taking the waters.)        IN SUFFERING        It is as difficult to call up in the fancy a picture of a  suffering Mozart as a merry Beethoven. The effect of melancholy  hours is scarcely to be found in Mozart's music. When he  composed,--i.e. according to his own expression \"speculated\"  while walking up and down revolving musical ideas in his mind and  forming them into orderly compositions, so that the subsequent  transcription was a mechanical occupation which required but  little effort,--he was transported to the realm of tones, far  from the miseries of this world. Nor would his happy disposition  permit him long to remain under the influence of grief and care.  None of the letters which sound notes of despair lacks a jest in  which the writer forcibly tears himself away from his gloomy  thoughts. His sufferings came to him from without; the fate of a  Beethoven was spared him. Others brought him pain,--his rivals  through envy, the Archbishop through malevolence, the Emperor  through ignorance. Sufferings of this character challenged  opposition and called out his powers, presenting to us a Mozart  full of temperament and capable of measuring himself with any  opponent.    He never lost hope even when hope seemed most deceptive. It is  therefore impossible to speak of a suffering Mozart in the sense  that we speak of a suffering Beethoven; fate was kind even at his  death, which was preceded by but a brief illness.    215. \"I am still full of gall!...Three times this--I do not  know what to call him--has assailed me to my face with  impertinence and abuse of a kind that I did not want to write  down, my best of fathers, and I did not immediately avenge the  insult because I thought of you. He called me a wretch (Buben),  a licentious fellow, told me to get out and I--suffered it all,  feeling that not only my honor but yours as well was attacked;  but,--it was your wish,--I held my tongue.\"    (Vienna, May 9, 1781, to his father, who had heard with deep  concern of the treatment which his son was enduring at the hands  of the Archbishop of Salzburg, and who feared for his own  position. At the close of the letter Mozart writes: \"I want to  hear nothing more about Salzburg; I hate the archbishop to the  verge of madness.\")    216. \"The edifying things which the Archbishop said to me in the  three audiences, particularly in the last, and what I have again  been told by this glorious man of God, had so admirable a  physical effect on me that I had to leave the opera in the  evening in the middle of the first act, go home, and to bed. I  was in a fever, my whole body trembled, and I reeled like a  drunken man in the street. The next day, yesterday, I remained at  home and all forenoon in bed because I had taken the tamarind  water.\"    (Vienna, May 12, 1781, to his father. The catastrophe  between Mozart and the archbishop is approaching.)    217. \"Twice the Archbishop gave me the grossest impertinences and  I answered not a word; more, I played for him with the same zeal  as if nothing had happened. Instead of recognizing the honesty of  my service and my desire to please him at the moment when I was  expecting something very different, he begins a third tirade in  the most despicable manner in the world.\"    (Vienna, June 13, 1781, to his father. See the chapter  \"Self-Respect and Honor.\")    218. \"All the world asserts that by my braggadocio and criticisms  I have made enemies of the professional musicians! Which world?  Presumably that of Salzburg, for anybody living in Vienna sees  and hears differently; there is my answer.\"    (Vienna, July 31, to his father, who had sent Mozart what the  latter called \"so indifferent and cold a letter,\" when informed  by his son of the great success of his opera, \"Die Entfuhrung aus  dem Serail.\" As on previous occasions Salzburg talebearers had  been busying themselves.)    219. \"I rejoice like a child at the prospect of being with you  again. I should have to be ashamed of myself if people could look  into my heart; so far as I am concerned it is cold,--cold as ice.  Yes, if you were with me I might find greater pleasure in the  courteous treatment which I receive from the people; but as it  is, it is all empty. Adieu!--Love!\"    (Frankfort, September 30, 1790, to his wife. Mozart had made the  journey to Frankfort to give concerts amidst the festivities  accompanying the coronation of Leopold II, hoping that he could  better his financial condition. Not having been sent at the cost  of the Emperor, like other Court musicians, he pawned his silver,  bought a carriage and took with him his brother-in-law, a  violinist named Hofer. \"It took us only six days to make the  journey.\" He was disappointed in his expectations. \"I have now  decided to do as well as I can here and look joyfully towards a  meeting with you. What a glorious life we shall lead; I shall  work--work!\")    220. \"Dreams give me no concern, for there is no mortal man on  earth who does not sometimes dream. But merry dreams! quiet,  refreshing, sweet dreams! Those are the thing! Dreams which, if  they were realities, would make tolerable my life which has more  of sadness in it than merriment.\"    (Munich, December 31, 1778, to his father. During Mozart's  sojourn in Paris the love of Aloysia Weber had grown cold, and  Mozart was in the dolors.)    221. \"Happy man! Now see,--I have got to give still another  lesson in order to earn some money.\"    (1786, to Gyrowetz, on the latter's departure for Italy.)    222. \"You can not doubt my honesty, for you know me too well for  that. Nor can you be suspicious of my words, my conduct or my  mode of life, because you know my conduct and mode of life.  Therefore,--forgive my confidence in you,--I am still very  unhappy,--always between fear and hope.\"    (Vienna, July 17, 1788, to his faithful friend, Puchberg, whom he  has asked for money on account of the severe illness of his  wife.)    223. \"You know my circumstances;--to be brief, since I can not  find a true friend, I am obliged to borrow money from usurers.  But as it takes time to hunt among these un-Christian persons for  those who are the most Christian and to find them, I am so  stripped that I must beg you, dear friend, for God's sake to help  me out with what you can spare.\"    (One of many requests for help sent to Puchberg. It was sent in  1790 and the original bears an endorsement: \"May 17, sent 150  florins.\")    224. \"If you, worthy brother, do not help me out of my present  predicament I shall lose my credit and honor, the only things  which I care now to preserve.\"    (Vienna, June 27, 1788, to Puchberg, who had sent him 200 florins  ten days before. Puchberg was a brother Mason.)    225. \"How I felt then! How I felt then! Such "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4060"],[0,"The Renaissance: studies in art and poetry (#16)"],[1,"time-honoured mode in which the world  stamps its appreciation of one who has thoughts for himself  alone, his high indifference, his intolerance of the common forms  of things; and in the second edition the image was changed into  something fainter and more conventional.  But it is still by a  certain mystery in his work, and something enigmatical beyond  the usual measure of great men, that he fascinates, or perhaps half  repels.  His life is one of sudden [99] revolts, with intervals in  which he works not at all, or apart from the main scope of his  work.  By a strange fortune the pictures on which his more  popular fame rested disappeared early from the world, like the  Battle of the Standard; or are mixed obscurely with the product  of meaner hands, like the Last Supper.  His type of beauty is so  exotic that it fascinates a larger number than it delights, and  seems more than that of any other artist to reflect ideas and views  and some scheme of the world within; so that he seemed to his  contemporaries to be the possessor of some unsanctified and  secret wisdom; as to Michelet and others to have anticipated  modern ideas.  He trifles with his genius, and crowds all his chief  work into a few tormented years of later life; yet he is so  possessed by his genius that he passes unmoved through the most  tragic events, overwhelming his country and friends, like one  who comes across them by chance on some secret errand.    His legend, as the French say, with the anecdotes which every  one remembers, is one of the most brilliant chapters of Vasari.  Later writers merely copied it, until, in 1804, Carlo Amoretti  applied to it a criticism which left hardly a date fixed, and not one  of those anecdotes untouched.  The various questions thus raised  have since that time become, one after another, subjects of  special study, and mere antiquarianism has in this direction little  more to do.  For others remain the editing of [100] the thirteen  books of his manuscripts, and the separation by technical  criticism of what in his reputed works is really his, from what is  only half his, or the work of his pupils.  But a lover of strange  souls may still analyse for himself the impression made on him  by those works, and try to reach through it a definition of the  chief elements of Leonardo's genius.  The legend, as corrected  and enlarged by its critics, may now and then intervene to support  the results of this analysis.    His life has three divisions--thirty years at Florence, nearly  twenty years at Milan, then nineteen years of wandering, till he  sinks to rest under the protection of Francis the First at the  Château de Clou.  The dishonour of illegitimacy hangs over his  birth.  Piero Antonio, his father, was of a noble Florentine house,  of Vinci in the Val d'Arno, and Leonardo, brought up delicately  among the true children of that house, was the love-child of his  youth, with the keen, puissant nature such children often have.  We see him in his boyhood fascinating all men by his beauty,  improvising music and songs, buying the caged birds and setting  them free, as he walked the streets of Florence, fond of odd bright  dresses and spirited horses.    From his earliest years he designed many objects, and  constructed models in relief, of which Vasari mentions some of  women smiling.  His father, pondering over this promise in the  [101] child, took him to the workshop of Andrea del Verrocchio,  then the most famous artist in Florence.  Beautiful objects lay  about there--reliquaries, pyxes, silver images for the pope's  chapel at Rome, strange fancy-work of the middle age, keeping  odd company with fragments of antiquity, then but lately  discovered.  Another student Leonardo may have seen there--a  lad into whose soul the level light and aërial illusions of Italian  sunsets had passed, in after days famous as Perugino.  Verrocchio  was an artist of the earlier Florentine type, carver, painter, and  worker in metals, in one; designer, not of pictures only, but of all  things for sacred or household use, drinking-vessels, ambries,  instruments of music, making them all fair to look upon, filling  the common ways of life with the reflexion of some far-off  brightness; and years of patience had refined his hand till his  work was now sought after from distant places.    It happened that Verrocchio was employed by the brethren of  Vallombrosa to paint the Baptism of Christ, and Leonardo was  allowed to finish an angel in the left-hand corner.  It was one of  those moments in which the progress of a great thing--here, that  of the art of Italy--presses hard on the happiness of an individual,  through whose discouragement and decrease, humanity, in more  fortunate persons, comes a step nearer to its final success.    For beneath the cheerful exterior of the mere [102] well-paid  craftsman, chasing brooches for the copes of Santa Maria  Novella, or twisting metal screens for the tombs of the Medici,  lay the ambitious desire to expand the destiny of Italian art by a  larger knowledge and insight into things, a purpose in art not  unlike Leonardo's still unconscious purpose; and often, in the  modelling of drapery, or of a lifted arm, or of hair cast back from  the face, there came to him something of the freer manner and  richer humanity of a later age.  But in this Baptism the pupil had  surpassed the master; and Verrocchio turned away as one  stunned, and as if his sweet earlier work must thereafter be  distasteful to him, from the bright animated angel of Leonardo's  hand.    The angel may still be seen in Florence, a space of sunlight in the  cold, laboured old picture; but the legend is true only in  sentiment, for painting had always been the art by which  Verrocchio set least store.  And as in a sense he anticipates  Leonardo, so to the last Leonardo recalls the studio of  Verrocchio, in the love of beautiful toys, such as the vessel of  water for a mirror, and lovely needle-work about the implicated  hands in the Modesty and Vanity, and of reliefs, like those  cameos which in the Virgin of the Balances hang all round the  girdle of Saint Michael, and of bright variegated stones, such as  the agates in the Saint Anne, and in a hieratic preciseness and  grace, as of a sanctuary swept and [103] garnished.  Amid all the  cunning and intricacy of his Lombard manner this never left him.  Much of it there must have been in that lost picture of Paradise,  which he prepared as a cartoon for tapestry, to be woven in the  looms of Flanders.  It was the perfection of the older Florentine  style of miniature-painting, with patient putting of each leaf upon  the trees and each flower in the grass, where the first man and  woman were standing.    And because it was the perfection of that style, it awoke in  Leonardo some seed of discontent which lay in the secret places  of his nature.  For the way to perfection is through a series of  disgusts; and this picture--all that he had done so far in his life at  Florence--was after all in the old slight manner.  His art, if it was  to be something in the world, must be weighted with more of the  meaning of nature and purpose of humanity.  Nature was \"the  true mistress of higher intelligences.\"  He plunged, then, into the  study of nature.  And in doing this he followed the manner of the  older students; he brooded over the hidden virtues of plants and  crystals, the lines traced by the stars as they moved in the sky,  over the correspondences which exist between the different  orders of living things, through which, to eyes opened, they  interpret each other; and for years he seemed to those about him  as one listening to a voice, silent for other men.    [104] He learned here the art of going deep, of tracking the  sources of expression to their subtlest retreats, the power of an  intimate presence in the things he handled.  He did not at once or  entirely desert his art; only he was no longer the cheerful,  objective painter, through whose soul, as through clear glass, the  bright figures of Florentine life, only made a little mellower and  more pensive by the transit, passed on to the white wall.  He  wasted many days in curious tricks of design, seeming to lose  himself in the spinning of intricate devices of line and colour.  He  was smitten with a love of the impossible--the perforation of  mountains, changing the course of rivers, raising great buildings,  such as the church of San Giovanni, in the air; all those feats for  the performance of which natural magic professed to have the  key.  Later writers, indeed, see in these efforts an anticipation of  modern mechanics; in him they were rather dreams, thrown off  by the overwrought and labouring brain.  Two ideas were  especially confirmed in him, as reflexes of things that had  touched his brain in childhood beyond the depth of other  impressions--the smiling of women and the motion of great  waters.    And in such studies some interfusion of the extremes of beauty  and terror shaped itself, as an image that might be seen and  touched, in the mind of this gracious youth, so fixed that for the  rest of his life it never left him.  As if catching [105] glimpses of  it in the strange eyes or hair of chance people, he would follow  such about the streets of Florence till the sun went down, of  whom many sketches of his remain.  Some of these are full of a  curious beauty, that remote beauty which may be apprehended  only by those who have sought it carefully; who, starting with  acknowledged types of beauty, have refined as far upon these, as  these refine upon the world of common forms.  But mingled  inextricably with this there is an element of mockery also; so that,  whether in sorrow or scorn, he caricatures Dante even.  Legions  of grotesques sweep under his hand; for has not nature too her  grotesques--the rent rock, the distorting lights of evening on  lonely roads, the unveiled structure of man in the"]]]
