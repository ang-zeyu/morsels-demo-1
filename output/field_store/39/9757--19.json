And I ain't scared of  nothin' neither.    \"I lives here wid my grandchile now on Mr. Bob Davis' place. Us gits  enough to eat, I reckon, but it's tight, I tell you dat!\"          Cheney Cross          *Interview with Cheney Cross*      --_Annie D. Dean_    _GITTIN' MY PENSION_    From all accounts, Aunt Cheney Cross must be quite ninety years old. \"In  jewin' de war,\" she says, \"I had done long pass my thirteenth birthday.\"  Today Aunt Cheney is a true reflection of slavery days and the Southern  mammy.    Away from highways and automobiles, she lives several miles from  Evergreen on a small farm in the piney woods with her \"baby boy.\"    Talk with Aunt Cheney reveals that Evergreen's city marshall, Harry L.  Riley, \"put out to hope\" this old family servant who had \"tended\" to his  father, George Riley; his mother, \"Miss Narciss,\" and \"Miss Lizzible,\"  his sister. She also helped bring his own \"chillun\" into the world.    Aunt Cheney had promised Mr. Riley that she would come in town on a  certain Saturday morning in May, 1937, and would bring a letter from her  young \"mistis\" for me to read.    It was past noon on that particular Saturday when she came up the back  steps, a little out of breath, but smiling. \"Lawd, honey,\" she said,  \"here 'tis pas' dinner time an' I'se jes' makin' my arrivement here.  No'm, I don't wants no dinner, thank you jes' de same. Whut makes me so  late here now, I stopped by Miss Ella Northcutt's. She's my folks too,  you know, an' she done made me eat all I kin hole! No'm, honey, I can't  eat no cabbage. Me an' cabbage never is set horses together much, but I  will thank you for the ice tea.\"    Settling herself down in a low chair, she sighed and began taking off  her shoes. \"Honey, you don't mind ef I resses my feets does you? My  white folks is sp'ilin' me here today. I'll be lookin' for it tomorrrow,  too, an' I won't be gittin' it.\" Her black eyes twinkled in her shiny,  old, wrinkled face as she talked on.    \"I tole Mr. Harry I'se comin'. An' here I is! How'd I come? I come on  Mack and Charlie, dat's how! Yes, ma'am! Dese two boys here, dey brung  me.\" Pushing her feet out for inspection, she leaned forward, smiling  and pleased. \"Dese here foots, dey's Mack an' Charlie. Dey's my whole  pennunce for gittin' about. Don't you worry none. Mr. Harry he'll git be  back home 'gainst dark come on.    \"Lawd, honey, I don't want to know no better folks'n Mr. Harry an' Miss  Emma. I follow dem good folks clean up to Muscle Show! Yessum, I sho'  did. At fust, I tole'm I couldn't go nohow. But dey pull down on me so  hard, look lack I couldn't he'p myself.    \"I stayed on up dere at Muscle Show twell I got so homesick to see my  baby boy I couldn't stan' it no mo'. Now, cose, my baby boy he was den  de father of his own, a boy an' a girl, but to me dat boy is still jes'  my baby, an' I had to come on home.\"    Aunt Cheney's little, old body shook with laughter as she leaned back  and said: \"Yes, ma'am! I ain't been home no time atall neither, 'twell  here come Mr. Harry back to Evergreen wid his own self. Yes, Lawd! I kin  see'm now, comin' up de big hardwood road, his haid raired back,  asmokin' a sugarette lack he's a millinery! Lawd, Lawd! Me nor Mr. Harry  neither one ain't never gona be contentious nowheres but right here. An'  dat's de Gawd's trufe!    \"Iffen Mr. Harry hadn't come on back here, I never woulda seed no  pension. Dat's de Gawd's trufe, too. Nobody here didn't know my eggzack  age, cause dis wasn't my originally home. All dem whut did know close  onto my age done died out an' I knows it. So when Mr. Harry put out to  hope me, I says in my heart 'Thank Gawd!'    \"I tole Mr. Harry dat iffen anybody in de world knowed my age, it was my  young mistis, an' I didn't know eggzackly where she at, but her papa was  Captain Purifire (Purifoy). Back yonder he was de madistra of our town,  an' he had all of dem lawin' books. I figgered dat my birthright would  be down in one of dem books. I knowed in reason dat my mistis still got  dem books wid her, 'cause dey ain't been no burnin's dat I done heard  about. I knowed, too, dat Mr. Harry was gona fine out where she at.    \"I 'members Captain Purifire jes' lack a book. I does dat! Now, cose,  when he come on in home from de war he didn't 'zackly favor hisse'f den,  'cause when I seed him comin' roun' de house he look so ragged an'  ornery I tuck him for de ole Bad Man hisse'f. I tuck out behind de smoke  house, an' when I got a good look at him th'ew a crack it look lack I  could recognize his favor, but I couldn't call his name to save my life.  Lawd, honey! He's a sight! All growed over an' bushy! You couldn't tell  iffen he's man or beas'. I kep' on alookin' whilst he's comin' roun' de  corner, an' den I heard him say 'Cheney, dat you?' I'se so happy, I jes'  melt down.\"    Aunt Cheney was really living over her past. \"You see, it's lack dis,\"  she said: \"My fore parents, dey was bought. My Mistis an' my daddy's  mistis, too, was Miss Mary Fields, an' my daddy was Henry Fields. Den de  Carters bought my daddy from Miss Mary Fields. Well, dey mix up an' down  lack dat, twell now my young mistis, what used to be little Frances  Purifire, she's married to Mr. Cunningham.    \"I was brung up right in de house wid my white folks. Yessum, I slep' on  de little trundler bed what pushed up under de big bed, in durinst de  day. I watched over dem chillun day an' night. I washed 'em an' fed 'em  an' played wid 'em. One of de babies had to take goat's milk. When she  cry, my mistis say, 'Cheney, go on an' git dat goat.' Yes Lawd! An' dat  goat sho' did talk sweet to dat baby! Jes' lack it was her own. She look  at it an' wag her tail so fas' an' say: \"Ma-a-a-a-a!\" Den she lay down  on de flo' whilst us holes her feets an' let de baby suck de milk. All  de time dat goat bees talkin', 'Ma-a-a-a-a,' twell dat baby got  satchified.    \"When us chillun got tuck wid any kind of sickness or zeezes, us tuck  azzifizzity an' garlit. You know, garlit what smell lack onions. Den we  wore some roun' us necks. Dat kep' off flu-anz.    \"Dese days it look lack somepin t'eat don't tas'e lack dat we cooked  back yonder. De coffee us used had to be fresh groun' ever' day. An'  when it commence to bile, I put dese here knees down on de flo' befo' de  fire an' stir dat coffee for de longes'. Den my gran'ma she hung dat pot  up on dem pot hooks over de fire an' washed de meat an' drap it in. Time  she done pick an' overlook de greens an' den wrinched 'em in spring  water, de meat was bilin'. Den she take a great big mess of dem fresh  turnip greens an' squash 'em down in dat pot. Dey jes' melt down an' go  to seasonin'.    \"Nex' thing I knowed, here come my mistis, an' she say: 'Now Cheney, I  wants some pone bread for dinner.' Dem hick'ry coals in dat fire place  was all time ready an' hot. They wouldn't be no finger prints lef' on  dat pone when Cheney got th'ew pattin' it out neither. Better not! Look  lack dem chillun jes' couldn't git 'nuff of dat hard corn bread.    \"Plenty of fancy cookin' went on 'roun' dat fire place, but somehow de  pot licker an' pone bread longside wid de fresh buttermilk stirs my  mem'ry worse'n anything.    \"All dis good eatin' I'se speakin' 'bout tuck place befo' de Yankees  raided us. It was den, too, dat my mistis tuck me down to de spring back  of de house. Down dere it was a holler tree stump, taller'n you is. She  tell me to clam' up to de top of dat holler tree, den she han' me a big  heavy bundle, all wropped up an' tied tight. Hit sho' was heavy! Den she  say: 'Drap it in, Cheney.' I didn't know den whut she's up to, but dat  was de silver an' jew'lry she was hidin'.    \"Yes honey, I 'members dat Yankee raid lack it was jes' yistiddy. I'se  settin' dere in de loom room, an' Mr. Thad Watts' lil' gal, Louise,  she's standin' at the winder. She say: 'O-o-oh! Nannie! Jes' look down  yonder!' 'Baby, what is dat?' I says. 'Dem's de Yankees comin'!' 'Gawd  hep us!' I says, an' befo' I kin ketch my bref, de place is kivvered.  You couldn't stir 'em up wid a stick. Feets sounded lack mutterin'  thunder. Dem bayonets stick up lack dey jes' setting on de mouf of dey  guns. Dey swords hangin' on dey sides singin' a chune whilst dey walk. A  chicken better not pass by. Iffen he do, off come his head!    \"When dey pass on by me, dey put' nigh shuck me outa my skin. 'Where's  de men's?' dey say an' shake me up. 'Where's de arms?' Dey shake me  twell my eye balls loosen up. 'Where's de silver?' Lawd! Was my teefs  drappin' out? Dey didn't give me time to ketch my bref. All de time,  Miss Mary jes' look 'em in de eye an' say nothin'!    \"Dey tuck dem enfield rifles, half as long as dat door, an' bus' in de  smoke house winder. Dey jack me up off'n my feet an' drag me up de  ladder an' say: 'Git dat meat out.' I kep' on th'owin' out Miss Mary's  hams an' sawsidges, twell dey holler 'stop'. I come backin' down dat  ladder lack a squirrel, an' I ain't stop backin' twell I retch Miss  Mary.    \"Yes, Lawd! Dem Yankees loaded up a waggin full of meat an' tuck de  whole barrel of 'lasses! Takin' dat 'lasses kilt us chillun! Our mainest  'musement was makin' 'lasses candy. Den us cake walk 'roun' it. Now dat  was all gone.

Pleasant fighting, and I  had been over there to see him. He was a private in the rear ranks. When  we were coming back to Charleston on a rice steamer, an open boat, the  Yankees were shelling the town. I played with my fingers in the water of  the bay as the steamer went along. We landed at a different landing from  the one where we had started from. When I got off the steamer I was very  much frightened, for they had shot through the hotel where we were  staying.    \"We immediately left the city by train. I hated to leave my husband so  far behind, but I could do nothing about it. In that day the train used  only wood for fuel. Only two trains a day came from Columbia to  Charleston. They made about 18 miles per hour, but that was good  traveling at that time.    \"My brother, Thomas Wilkins, went through the war. My father, Russell,  and Richard were in training when the surrender came. I stayed with my  father at White Plains while my husband was off to war. When we heard  that the Yankees were coming, we had the Negroes to hide all the horses  but two, and to hide the cows and turn the hogs loose to ramble in the  woods.    \"When the Yankees rode up to the yard and got off their horses, we could  easily tell they had been drinking. We told them that our horses were in  the stable and that the Negroes had fled in terror, which was true. They  ate up everything they could find and ransacked the closets and pantry.  They then caught the chickens, took the two horses in the stable and  went away.    \"The darkies came back with the cows and horses, and we got settled for  the night. About nine o'clock, the Yankees came unexpectedly and took  all the horses and cows. They killed the cows, and made our darkies help  them to butcher them and barbecue them. The Yankees soon ate everything  up and left with our horses.    \"My grandmother, Agnes Wood, gave my mother, Elizabeth Wilkins, a  beautiful young mare. The Yankee who took that mare, turned over a pot  of fresh soap when my mother asked him not to take the mare. Our cook,  Matilda, had the soap ready to cut in the pot, so we saved some of it.    \"During the second year of the war I was making me a homespun dress, and  while my father helped me with the weaving he told me of a dress that  one of his friends made during the Nullificatlon days. I carded and spun  the filling for my new dress, wove it, made the dress and wore it to  Charleston when I went to see my husband. It had broad, black stripes  the width of my two fingers, and two green threads between the black  stripes. It also had a little yellow stripe. It was really a beautiful  dress and looked very much like silk.\"          Govan Littlejohn          *I*      *Interview with Govan Littlejohn*      *Park Ave. and Liberty St., Spartanburg, S.C.*      --_Caldwell Sims, Union, S.C._    \"Capt.

Liberty St., Spartanburg, S.C.*      --_F.S. DuPre, Spartanburg, S.C._    Govan Littlejohn, of Spartanburg, told the writer he was 87 years old  and that he remembered slavery times. He said he was born on the farm of  Dicky Littlejohn, located near Grindal Shoals. He said Richard  Littlejohn owned a mill on Pacolet River, though his brother, Jim  Littlejohn, owned the land. This was a grist mill. Govan Littlejohn's  father was a colored man from another farm and his name was Hawkins, but  he took the name of Littlejohn. He remembers the Yankee Soldiers passing  in the public road, but they did not bother any one there; didn't take  or steal anything, and just passed on quietly. He says his master did  not know how to whip anybody, though he remembers him catching hold of  him one day and switching him with a small twig, saying \"You little  rascal, you.\" His master whipped some of the grown negroes but not hard  enough to hurt them, though once or twice he saw a grown negro with bare  back feel the switch. \"But he did not know how to whip anybody.\"    \"Yes, I been conjured,\" he said. \"You see that left foot? Well, once  when I was a young 'buck', I was setting up to a gal and there was  another fellow setting up to her, too. I held a little bit the upper  hand with the gal. But when my left foot began to swell up and pain me,  I had to go to bed. I stayed there three months. Dr. Nott came to see me  and treated me with corn poultices, but they would dry up and fall off  and I didn't get any better. He lanced my foot three times, but nothing  but blood would come. One day a herb doctor came to see me and said he  could cure my foot. He took corn meal poultices, rhubarb roots and some  other things, and it wasn't long before my foot got well. About that  time, my mother found the 'conjuration' right in the front yard at the  door-steps. I must have stepped over it, or got my foot caught in it  some way. The 'conjuration' was, pins, feathers and something else all  tied up in a bag. My mother heard that if it was put in running water,  the conjurer would leave the country. So pretty soon after she put the  stuff in running water, that fellow left the country. He got his arm  caught in a cotton gin not long after he left, and got it chewed off  right to his shoulder.    \"Vegetables should be planted during the dark of the moon. One day, the  man I was working for told me he wanted his Irish potatoes planted. I  told him that wasn't the time to plant potatoes. He told me to plant  some in one particular place that day and call them his potatoes, then  when I thought the time was right, to plant the rest in another place.
