Wherefore, not without just cause, folk had dropped his surname de'  Grimaldi, and called him instead Messer Ermino Avarizia. While thus by  thrift his wealth waxed greater and greater, it so chanced that there came  to Genoa a jester of good parts, a man debonair and ready of speech, his  name Guglielmo Borsiere, whose like is not to be found to-day when jesters  (to the great reproach be it spoken of those that claim the name and  reputation of gentlemen) are rather to be called asses, being without  courtly breeding, and formed after the coarse pattern of the basest of  churls. And whereas in the days of which I speak they made it their  business, they spared no pains, to compose quarrels, to allay  heart-burnings, between gentlemen, or arrange marriages, or leagues of  amity, ministering meanwhile relief to jaded minds and solace to courts by  the sprightly sallies of their wit, and with keen sarcasm, like fathers,  censuring churlish manners, being also satisfied with very trifling  guerdons; nowadays all their care is to spend their time in  scandal-mongering, in sowing discord, in saying, and (what is worse) in  doing in the presence of company things churlish and flagitious, in bringing  accusations, true or false, of wicked, shameful or flagitious conduct  against one another; and in drawing gentlemen into base and nefarious  practices by sinister and insidious arts. And by these wretched and depraved  lords he is held most dear and best rewarded whose words and deeds are the  most atrocious, to the great reproach and scandal of the world of to-day;  whereby it is abundantly manifest that virtue has departed from the earth,  leaving a degenerate generation to wallow in the lowest depths of vice.    But reverting to the point at which I started, wherefrom under stress of  just indignation I have deviated somewhat further than I intended, I say  that the said Guglielmo was had in honour, and was well received by all the  gentlemen of Genoa; and tarrying some days in the city, heard much of the  meanness and avarice of Messer Ermino, and was curious to see him. Now  Messer Ermino had heard that this Guglielmo Borsiere was a man of good  parts, and, notwithstanding his avarice, having in him some sparks of good  breeding, received him with words of hearty greeting and a gladsome mien,  and conversed freely with him and of divers matters, and so conversing, took  him with other Genoese that were of his company to a new and very beautiful  house which he had built, and after shewing him over the whole of it, said  to him:--\"Now, Messer Guglielmo, you have seen and heard many things; could  you suggest to me something, the like of which has not hitherto been seen,  which I might have painted here in the saloon of this house?\" To which  ill-judged question Guglielmo replied:--\"Sir, it would not, I think, be in  my power to suggest anything the like of which has never been seen, unless  it were a sneeze or something similar; but if it so please you, I have  something to suggest, which, I think, you have never seen.\" \"Prithee, what  may that be?\" said Messer Ermino, not expecting to get the answer which he  got. For Guglielmo replied forthwith:--\"Paint Courtesy here;\" which Messer  Ermino had no sooner heard, than he was so stricken with shame that his  disposition underwent a complete change, and he said:--\"Messer, Guglielmo, I  will see to it that Courtesy is here painted in such wise that neither you  nor any one else shall ever again have reason to tell me that I have not  seen or known that virtue.\" And henceforward (so enduring was the change  wrought by Guglielmo's words) there was not in Genoa, while he lived, any  gentleman so liberal and so gracious and so lavish of honour both to  strangers and to his fellow-citizens as Messer Ermino de' Grimaldi.      NOVEL IX.    --  The censure of a Gascon lady converts the King of Cyprus from a churlish to  an honourable temper.  --    Except Elisa none now remained to answer the call of the queen, and she  without waiting for it, with gladsome alacrity thus began:--    Bethink you, damsels, how often it has happened that men who have been  obdurate to censures and chastisements have been reclaimed by some  unpremeditated casual word. This is plainly manifest by the story told by  Lauretta; and by mine, which will be of the briefest, I mean further to  illustrate it; seeing that, good stories, being always pleasurable, are  worth listening to with attention, no matter by whom they may be told.    'Twas, then, in the time of the first king of Cyprus, after the conquest  made of the Holy Land by Godfrey de Bouillon, that a lady of Gascony made a  pilgrimage to the Holy Sepulchre, and on her way home, having landed at  Cyprus, met with brutal outrage at the hands of certain ruffians.  Broken-hearted and disconsolate she determined to make her complaint to the  king; but she was told that it would be all in vain, because so spiritless  and faineant was he that he not only neglected to avenge affronts put upon  others, but endured with a reprehensible tameness those which were offered  to himself, insomuch that whoso had any ill-humour to vent, took occasion to  vex or mortify him. The lady, hearing this report, despaired of redress, and  by way of alleviation of her grief determined to make the king sensible of  his baseness. So in tears she presented herself before him and said:--\"Sire,  it is not to seek redress of the wrong done me that I come here before you:  but only that, so please you, I may learn of you how it is that you suffer  patiently the wrongs which, as I understand, are done you; that thus  schooled by you in patience I may endure my own, which, God knows, I would  gladly, were it possible, transfer to you, seeing that you are so well  fitted to bear them.\" These words aroused the hitherto sluggish and  apathetic king as it were from sleep. He redressed the lady's wrong, and  having thus made a beginning, thenceforth meted out the most rigorous  justice to all that in any wise offended against the majesty of his crown.      NOVEL X.    --  Master Alberto da Bologna honourably puts to shame a lady who sought  occasion to put him to shame in that he was in love with her.  --    After Elisa had done, it only remained for the queen to conclude the day's  story-telling, and thus with manner debonair did she begin:--    As stars in the serene expanse of heaven, as in spring-time flowers in the  green pastures, so, honourable damsels, in the hour of rare and excellent  converse is wit with its bright sallies. Which, being brief, are much more  proper for ladies than for men, seeing that prolixity of speech, when  brevity is possible, is much less allowable to them; albeit (shame be to us  all and all our generation) few ladies or none are left to-day who  understand aught that is wittily said, or understanding are able to answer  it. For the place of those graces of the spirit which distinguished the  ladies of the past has now been usurped by adornments of the person; and she  whose dress is most richly and variously and curiously dight, accounts  herself more worthy to be had in honour, forgetting, that, were one but so  to array him, an ass would carry a far greater load of finery than any of  them, and for all that be not a whit the more deserving of honour. I blush  to say this, for in censuring others I condemn myself. Tricked out,  bedecked, bedizened thus, we are either silent and impassive as statues, or,  if we answer aught that is said to us, much better were it we had held our  peace. And we make believe, forsooth, that our failure to acquit ourselves  in converse with our equals of either sex does but proceed from  guilelessness; dignifying stupidity by the name of modesty, as if no lady  could be modest and converse with other folk than her maid or laundress or  bake-house woman; which if Nature had intended, as we feign she did, she  would have set other limits to our garrulousness. True it is that in this,  as in other matters, time and place and person are to be regarded; because  it sometimes happens that a lady or gentleman thinking by some sally of wit  to put another to shame, has rather been put to shame by that other, having  failed duly to estimate their relative powers. Wherefore, that you may be on  your guard against such error, and, further, that in you be not exemplified  the common proverb, to wit, that women do ever and on all occasions choose  the worst, I trust that this last of to-day's stories, which falls to me to  tell, may serve you as a lesson; that, as you are distinguished from others  by nobility of nature, so you may also shew yourselves separate from them by  excellence of manners.    There lived not many years ago, perhaps yet lives, in Bologna, a very great  physician, so great that the fame of his skill was noised abroad throughout  almost the entire world.    Now Master Alberto (such was his name) was of so noble a temper that, being  now nigh upon seventy years of age, and all but devoid of natural heat of  body, he was yet receptive of the flames of love; and having at an assembly  seen a very beautiful widow lady, Madonna Malgherida de' Ghisolieri, as some  say, and being charmed with her beyond measure, was, notwithstanding his  age, no less ardently enamoured than a young man, insomuch that he was not  well able to sleep at night, unless during the day he had seen the fair  lady's lovely and delicate features. Wherefore he began to frequent the  vicinity of her house, passing to and fro in front of it, now on foot now on  horseback, as occasion"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37329"],[0,"The Domestic Cat (#16)"],[1,"be sick,\"  and pussy forthwith appears as if she couldn't possibly survive another  hour.  Bread pills are manufactured, and forced over the poor cat's  throat, she barely resisting.  Then lullabies, low and sweet, are sung  to her, which pussy enjoys immensely, and presently, joining in the song  herself, goes off to sleep in earnest.    And Alice, pussy's friend, although at times she may use the furry  favourite rather roughly, is kind to her in the main.  Doesn't pussy get  a share of Alice's porridge every morning? doesn't she sup with Alice  every night? and do you think for one moment Alice would go to bed  without her?  Not she.  And still this cat, may be as savage as a she  tiger, to every one else in the house save to her little mistress.  Just  let you or me, reader, attempt to hold her up by the tail--well, I would  a hundred times rather you should try it than I.    The very fact, I think, that faithful pussy is so fond of our innocent  children, and so patient and self-denying towards them, is one reason  why we should be kind to her, and study her comforts a little more than  we do.    But probably one of the most endearing traits in the character of the  domestic cat is her extreme attachment to, and love for, the person who  owns her.  If you once get your cat to really love you, no matter how  fond she may be of the home where she was born and reared, she will go  with you, if you but say the word, to the uttermost parts of the earth.  My poor old favourite, Muffle, has travelled many, many thousands of  miles with me by sea and land, and always watched over both me and my  property _with all the care_ and fidelity of a Highland collie.  Been  lost, too, she has, many a time in the midst of big bustling cities  which were quite strange to her--been lost, but always turned up again.    I know of many instances in which cats have so attached themselves to  their owners, that, when the latter have died, they have refused all  food, and in a few days succumbed to grief, and gone, I fondly hope, to  meet the loved one in a world that's free of care.    \"But the largest cat,\" writes one of my numerous correspondents, \"I ever  saw belonged to my mother's mother, and was wise and sedate in  proportion to its size.  Its good mistress was often distressed with  palpitation of the heart, and during the silent hours of night paced the  bedroom floor in pain--but not alone, for the faithful creature would  walk slowly at her side, seeming by his look to pity her condition, and  when she lay down he would still stand sentinel at her head.  He never  could be persuaded to leave the house while she lived, yet a few hours  before her death he suddenly took flight, but only to the lower  apartments, which my parents occupied, and from which he never stirred  again.\"    I never think, somehow, that a fireside has the same cheerful look of an  evening unless there be a cat there, to sit on the footstool, and sing  duets with the tea-kettle.    And I do not wonder at old women, whose friends have all long since gone  before, and who have no one left to care for them, getting greatly  attached to a faithful pussy; for people must have something to love.    \"But, fancy loving a cat!\"  I think I hear some churl remark.    Yes, cynical reader, and I have, myself, before now, often shared my  heart with stranger pets than cats; and I don't mind betting you that  what I have left of it is bigger than yours now.    Figuratively speaking, I think a man's or a woman's heart is like a  blacksmith's arm--_it grows with use_.    CHAPTER EIGHTEEN.    HINTS UPON BREEDING AND REARING CATS FOR EXHIBITION, AND A WORD ABOUT  CAT-SHOWS.    At nearly all the cat-shows which I have visited of late, I have been  invariably impressed with this one idea: here, in these shows, we see  pussy as she is in the present day--the live mouse-trap, the barn cat,  at best the fireside favourite--but, at all events, the animal, of all  our domestic animals, that is least cared for, and the only animal we  possess, whose improvement in condition and species we have never cared  to study.  What this animal--the domestic cat--can become, the  perfection to which she may attain through judicious selection and  careful breeding, it is for future years to show.    Other nations--such as the Persians and different other Asiatics--know  far more about the domestic cat than we do, and quite put us to the  blush with their splendidly-bred and high-blooded animals.    It is one of the many popular fallacies current in this enlightened land  of ours, that there is in the cat a certain number of bad qualities--a  certain spice of the devil, so to speak--that never can be bred out.  This is simply absurd, for there is no animal that lives and breathes on  God's fair earth but is susceptible of improvement, both physically and  morally; for, remember, a cat, little as you may think of her, has a  mind _and a soul_, as well as you have.  She has thought, and memory,  and reasoning powers; she can love and she can fear, can be happy and  gay, or sad and sorrowful, and she knows something too of the mystery of  death.    With all these qualities will you tell me that she cannot be improved?  I say she can; even as to race; for what can be accomplished with  individual cats, may be accomplished with the whole race.  I can  introduce you to dozens of cat-fanciers in this country, who have made  the peculiarities of pussy's nature their study, and who find that they  can, at will, not only improve the physical condition of their cats; but  even, by careful training, occasional gentle correction, kindness, and  good-feeding, raise them from good to better, and wean them from the  ways which are so objectionable in other, or merely half-domesticated  cats.  And, look you, the progeny of such animals--by a law well-known  to all breeders--take after them, or inherit the good qualities of their  parents.  Hence, I repeat, if you can improve the individual cat,  through time you may improve the _genus_.  That time may be long in  coming--granted; but that the lovers of cats, in this country, have  boldly seized the bull by the horns, and are taking a step in the right  direction, is a positive fact which admits of no denial.    Now, to those who are fond of cats, and would fain improve the  particular breed they have a fancy for, and probably win prizes at our  great shows, I beg to offer the following hints:--    _First_.  Having made up your mind as to what particular breed you mean  to go in for, stick by that breed for a time, at least, and go in for no  other.    _Secondly_.  Be careful in your selection of parents.  For instance: we  will suppose you mean to breed pure white Angoras; well, purchase at a  first-class show a Tom kitten and a queen kitten _from different  litters_.  Choose the liveliest, biggest, and most healthy-looking  kitten of each litter, not, as in choosing pups, the heaviest and  sleepiest-looking.  The funny kitten turns out the best cat, and is more  easily trained than a sulky or frightened one.    Having gotten your purchases home, remember that the royal road to a  kitten's affection is straight through its stomach.  Be, yourself, then,  the first to present pussy with a saucer of warm, creamy milk.    _Thirdly.  How to get size_.  This is accomplished by the quantity and  quality of pussy's food, and the regularity with which she gets her  meals.  Whatever you give a young cat, and a growing cat to eat, do not  let it be too abundant.  Never let her gorge herself; give her little  and often.  Don't let her want for a saucerful of pure water, to which  she can always find access.  Let her allowance of milk be put down to  her and taken up again when she has had all she wants; what she leaves  had better be given to the pigs.  Bad milk is a fruitful source of  diarrhoea, dysentery, and some forms of skin disease.  A little  sulphur--about as much as will lie on a fourpenny-bit--should be given  at least once a fortnight, or half that quantity once a week.    Train your cats early to habits of cleanliness.  Don't forget the  flower-pot saucer; and remember that, if the cats you wish to take  prizes with, belong to any of the finer breeds, they _must_ be parlour  cats, and not kitchen-bred brutes.    If you want your cats to grow large, let their food be nourishing but  not stimulating; boiled cow's or sheep's lights they can eat their  stomachs full of; but avoid beef, it is too gross and heating, and don't  patronise the cat's-meat man.    Kittens and growing cats, in order to grow large, must have plenty of  exercise and fun.  Leaping exercise is best.  Teach them to jump through  a hoop, and keep them at it.  They ought to have a ball as a toy, or a  hare's foot; and ridiculous as it may seem to many, it is a positive  fact, that cats--especially queen cats--thrive best who have a  looking-glass conveniently placed to admire themselves in, and to wash  and dress in front of.    \"Ilka little maks a mickle,\" is a good old Scotch proverb, and believe  me it is attention to little matters, to minutiae, which makes one  successful in properly rearing any animal.    _Fourthly.  How to get Good Pelage on a Cat_.  The feeding of course has  much to do with the length and gloss of the coat.  Fish I have found is  good for the coat, and a mixed diet generally, with not too much  vegetables to scour them.  But your sheet-anchors, after all, are the  brush and the comb.  The comb must be fine, and not too close in the  teeth, and it should be used gently, after which brush the coat briskly  all over with a long-haired soft hair-brush--a baby's brush in fact.  The comb is not only a gentle stimulant to the skin, but it prevents  matting, while the brush removes dust, and gives a nice glitter to the  pelage.  Both together act as a charm.    _Fifthly_.  In cats other than white you will find that certain kinds of  food strengthen the colours of"]]]
