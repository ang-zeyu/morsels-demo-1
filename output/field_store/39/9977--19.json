[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/68"],[0,"Warlord of Mars (#16)"],[1,"we were rapidly approaching the north arctic region.    My knowledge of the efforts that had been made by countless  expeditions to explore that unknown land bade me to caution, for  never had flier returned who had passed to any considerable distance  beyond the mighty ice-barrier that fringes the southern hem of the  frigid zone.    What became of them none knew--only that they passed forever out  of the sight of man into that grim and mysterious country of the  pole.    The distance from the barrier to the pole was no more than a swift  flier should cover in a few hours, and so it was assumed that some  frightful catastrophe awaited those who reached the \"forbidden land,\"  as it had come to be called by the Martians of the outer world.    Thus it was that I went more slowly as we approached the barrier,  for it was my intention to move cautiously by day over the ice-pack  that I might discover, before I had run into a trap, if there  really lay an inhabited country at the north pole, for there only  could I imagine a spot where Matai Shang might feel secure from  John Carter, Prince of Helium.    We were flying at a snail's pace but a few feet above the  ground--literally feeling our way along through the darkness, for  both moons had set, and the night was black with the clouds that  are to be found only at Mars's two extremities.    Suddenly a towering wall of white rose directly in our path, and  though I threw the helm hard over, and reversed our engine, I was  too late to avoid collision. With a sickening crash we struck the  high looming obstacle three-quarters on.    The flier reeled half over; the engine stopped; as one, the patched  buoyancy tanks burst, and we plunged, headforemost, to the ground  twenty feet beneath.    Fortunately none of us was injured, and when we had disentangled  ourselves from the wreckage, and the lesser moon had burst again from  below the horizon, we found that we were at the foot of a mighty  ice-barrier, from which outcropped great patches of the granite  hills which hold it from encroaching farther toward the south.    What fate!  With the journey all but completed to be thus wrecked  upon the wrong side of that precipitous and unscalable wall of rock  and ice!    I looked at Thuvan Dihn.  He but shook his head dejectedly.    The balance of the night we spent shivering in our inadequate  sleeping silks and furs upon the snow that lies at the foot of the  ice-barrier.    With daylight my battered spirits regained something of their  accustomed hopefulness, though I must admit that there was little  enough for them to feed upon.    \"What shall we do?\" asked Thuvan Dihn.  \"How may we pass that which  is impassable?\"    \"First we must disprove its impassability,\" I replied.  \"Nor shall  I admit that it is impassable before I have followed its entire  circle and stand again upon this spot, defeated.  The sooner we  start, the better, for I see no other way, and it will take us more  than a month to travel the weary, frigid miles that lie before us.\"    For five days of cold and suffering and privation we traversed the  rough and frozen way which lies at the foot of the ice-barrier.  Fierce, fur-bearing creatures attacked us by daylight and by dark.  Never for a moment were we safe from the sudden charge of some huge  demon of the north.    The apt was our most consistent and dangerous foe.    It is a huge, white-furred creature with six limbs, four of which,  short and heavy, carry it swiftly over the snow and ice; while the  other two, growing forward from its shoulders on either side of  its long, powerful neck, terminate in white, hairless hands, with  which it seizes and holds its prey.    Its head and mouth are more similar in appearance to those of a  hippopotamus than to any other earthly animal, except that from  the sides of the lower jawbone two mighty horns curve slightly  downward toward the front.    Its two huge eyes inspired my greatest curiosity.  They extend in  two vast, oval patches from the center of the top of the cranium  down either side of the head to below the roots of the horns, so  that these weapons really grow out from the lower part of the eyes,  which are composed of several thousand ocelli each.    This eye structure seemed remarkable in a beast whose haunts were  upon a glaring field of ice and snow, and though I found upon  minute examination of several that we killed that each ocellus is  furnished with its own lid, and that the animal can at will close  as many of the facets of his huge eyes as he chooses, yet I was  positive that nature had thus equipped him because much of his life  was to be spent in dark, subterranean recesses.    Shortly after this we came upon the hugest apt that we had seen.  The creature stood fully eight feet at the shoulder, and was so  sleek and clean and glossy that I could have sworn that he had but  recently been groomed.    He stood head-on eyeing us as we approached him, for we had found  it a waste of time to attempt to escape the perpetual bestial rage  which seems to possess these demon creatures, who rove the dismal  north attacking every living thing that comes within the scope of  their far-seeing eyes.    Even when their bellies are full and they can eat no more, they  kill purely for the pleasure which they derive from taking life,  and so when this particular apt failed to charge us, and instead  wheeled and trotted away as we neared him, I should have been greatly  surprised had I not chanced to glimpse the sheen of a golden collar  about its neck.    Thuvan Dihn saw it, too, and it carried the same message of hope  to us both.  Only man could have placed that collar there, and as  no race of Martians of which we knew aught ever had attempted to  domesticate the ferocious apt, he must belong to a people of the  north of whose very existence we were ignorant--possibly to the  fabled yellow men of Barsoom; that once powerful race which was  supposed to be extinct, though sometimes, by theorists, thought  still to exist in the frozen north.    Simultaneously we started upon the trail of the great beast.  Woola was quickly made to understand our desires, so that it was  unnecessary to attempt to keep in sight of the animal whose swift  flight over the rough ground soon put him beyond our vision.    For the better part of two hours the trail paralleled the barrier,  and then suddenly turned toward it through the roughest and seemingly  most impassable country I ever had beheld.    Enormous granite boulders blocked the way on every hand; deep rifts  in the ice threatened to engulf us at the least misstep; and from  the north a slight breeze wafted to our nostrils an unspeakable  stench that almost choked us.    For another two hours we were occupied in traversing a few hundred  yards to the foot of the barrier.    Then, turning about the corner of a wall-like outcropping of granite,  we came upon a smooth area of two or three acres before the base  of the towering pile of ice and rock that had baffled us for days,  and before us beheld the dark and cavernous mouth of a cave.    From this repelling portal the horrid stench was emanating, and  as Thuvan Dihn espied the place he halted with an exclamation of  profound astonishment.    \"By all my ancestors!\" he ejaculated.  \"That I should have lived to  witness the reality of the fabled Carrion Caves!  If these indeed  be they, we have found a way beyond the ice-barrier.    \"The ancient chronicles of the first historians of Barsoom--so  ancient that we have for ages considered them mythology--record  the passing of the yellow men from the ravages of the green hordes  that overran Barsoom as the drying up of the great oceans drove  the dominant races from their strongholds.    \"They tell of the wanderings of the remnants of this once powerful  race, harassed at every step, until at last they found a way through  the ice-barrier of the north to a fertile valley at the pole.    \"At the opening to the subterranean passage that led to their haven  of refuge a mighty battle was fought in which the yellow men were  victorious, and within the caves that gave ingress to their new  home they piled the bodies of the dead, both yellow and green, that  the stench might warn away their enemies from further pursuit.    \"And ever since that long-gone day have the dead of this fabled  land been carried to the Carrion Caves, that in death and decay they  might serve their country and warn away invading enemies.  Here,  too, is brought, so the fable runs, all the waste stuff of the  nation--everything that is subject to rot, and that can add to the  foul stench that assails our nostrils.    \"And death lurks at every step among rotting dead, for here the fierce  apts lair, adding to the putrid accumulation with the fragments of  their own prey which they cannot devour.  It is a horrid avenue to  our goal, but it is the only one.\"    \"You are sure, then, that we have found the way to the land of the  yellow men?\" I cried.    \"As sure as may be,\" he replied; \"having only ancient legend to  support my belief.  But see how closely, so far, each detail tallies  with the world-old story of the hegira of the yellow race.  Yes,  I am sure that we have discovered the way to their ancient hiding  place.\"    \"If it be true, and let us pray that such may be the case,\" I said,  \"then here may we solve the mystery of the disappearance of Tardos  Mors, Jeddak of Helium, and Mors Kajak, his son, for no other spot  upon Barsoom has remained unexplored by the many expeditions and  the countless spies that have been searching for them for nearly  two years.  The last word that came from them was that they sought  Carthoris, my own brave son, beyond the ice-barrier.\"    As we talked we had been approaching the entrance to the cave, and  as we crossed the threshold I ceased to wonder that the ancient  green enemies of the yellow men had been halted by the horrors of  that awful way."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6812"],[0,"Abraham Lincoln: a History — Volume 01 (#16)"],[1,"within his grasp, if he could once fall in with the requisite  machinery. Consulting with Menton [Footnote: This name has always been  written in Illinois \"Minter,\" but a letter from Mr. Graham's daughter,  Mrs. Bell, says that her father's name is as given in the text.]  Graham, the schoolmaster, in regard to it, and learning the  whereabouts of a vagrant \"Kirkham's Grammar,\" he set off at once and  soon returned from a walk of a dozen miles with the coveted prize. He  devoted himself to the new study with that peculiar intensity of  application which always remained his most valuable faculty, and soon  knew all that can be known about it from rules. He seemed surprised,  as others have been, at the meager dimensions of the science he had  acquired and the ease with which it yielded all there was of it to the  student. But it seemed no slight achievement to the New Salemites, and  contributed not a little to the prevalent impression of his learning.    His name is prominently connected with an event which just at this  time caused an excitement and interest in Salem and the neighboring  towns entirely out of proportion to its importance. It was one of the  articles of faith of most of the settlers on the banks of the Sangamon  River that it was a navigable stream, and the local politicians found  that they could in no way more easily hit the fancy of their hearers  than by discussing this assumed fact, and the logical corollary  derived from it, that it was the duty of the State or the nation to  clear out the snags and give free course to the commerce which was  waiting for an opportunity to pour along this natural highway. At last  one Captain Vincent Bogue, of Springfield, determined to show that the  thing could be done by doing it. The first promise of the great  enterprise appears in the \"Sangsmo Journal\" of January 26, 1832, in a  letter from the Captain, at Cincinnati, saying he would ascend the  Sangamon by steam on the breaking up of the ice. He asked that he  might be met at the mouth of the river by ten or twelve men, having  axes with long handles, to cut away the overhanging branches of the  trees on the banks. From this moment there was great excitement,--  public meetings, appointment of committees, appeals for subscriptions,  and a scattering fire of advertisements of goods and freight to be  bargained for,--which sustained the prevailing interest. It was a day  of hope and promise when the advertisement reached Springfield from  Cincinnati that \"the splendid upper-cabin steamer Talisman\" would  positively start for the Sangamon on a given day. As the paper  containing this joyous intelligence also complained that no mail had  reached Springfield from the east for three weeks, it is easy to  understand the desire for more rapid and regular communications. From  week to week the progress of the _Talisman_, impeded by bad weather  and floating ice, was faithfully recorded, until at last the party  with long-handled axes went down to Beardstown to welcome her. It is  needless to state that Lincoln was one of the party. His standing as a  scientific citizen of New Salem would have been enough to insure his  selection even if he had not been known as a bold navigator. He  piloted the _Talisman_ safely through the windings of the Sangamon,  and Springfield gave itself up to extravagant gayety on the event that  proved she \"could no longer be considered an inland town.\" Captain  Bogue announced \"fresh and seasonable goods just received per  steamboat _Talisman_,\" and the local poets illuminated the columns of  the \"Journal\" with odes on her advent. The joy was short-lived. The  _Talisman_ met the natural fate of steamboats a few months later,  being burned at the St. Louis wharf. Neither State nor nation has ever  removed the snags from the Sangamon, and no subsequent navigator of  its waters has been found to eclipse the fame of the earliest one.          CHAPTER V    LINCOLN IN THE BLACK HAWK WAR      [Sidenote: 1832.]    A new period in the life of Lincoln begins with the summer of 1832. He  then obtained his first public recognition, and entered upon the  course of life which was to lead him to a position of prominence and  great usefulness.    The business of Offutt had gone to pieces, and his clerk was out of  employment, when Governor Reynolds issued his call for volunteers to  move the tribe of Black Hawk across the Mississippi. For several years  the raids of the old Sac chieftain upon that portion of his patrimony  which he had ceded to the United States had kept the settlers in the  neighborhood of Rock Island in terror, and menaced the peace of the  frontier. In the spring of 1831 he came over to the east side of the  river with a considerable band of warriors, having been encouraged by  secret promises of cooperation from several other tribes. These failed  him, however, when the time of trial arrived, and an improvised force  of State volunteers, assisted by General E. P. Gaines and his  detachment, had little difficulty in compelling the Indians to re-  cross the Mississippi, and to enter into a solemn treaty on the 30th  of June by which the former treaties were ratified and Black Hawk  and his leading warriors bound themselves never again to set foot on  the east side of the river, without express permission from the  President or the Governor of Illinois.    [Sidenote: Reynolds, \"Life and Times,\" p. 325.]    [Sidenote: Ford, \"History of Illinois,\" p. 110.]    But Black Hawk was too old a savage to learn respect for treaties or  resignation under fancied wrongs. He was already approaching the  allotted term of life. He had been a chief of his nation for more than  forty years. He had scalped his first enemy when scarcely more than a  child, having painted on his blanket the blood-red hand which marked  his nobility at fifteen years of age. Peace under any circumstances  would doubtless have been irksome to him, but a peace which forbade  him free access to his own hunting-grounds and to the graves of his  fathers was more than he could now school himself to endure. He had  come to believe that he had been foully wronged by the treaty which  was his own act; he had even convinced himself that \"land cannot be  sold,\" a proposition in political economy which our modern socialists  would be puzzled to accept or confute. Besides this, the tenderest  feelings of his heart were outraged by this exclusion from his former  domain. He had never passed a year since the death of his daughter  without making a pilgrimage to her grave at Oquawka and spending hours  in mystic ceremonies and contemplation. He was himself prophet as well  as warrior, and had doubtless his share of mania, which is the  strength of prophets. The promptings of his own broken heart readily  seemed to him the whisperings of attendant spirits; and day by day  these unseen incitements increased around him, until they could not be  resisted even if death stood in the way.    He made his combinations during the winter, and had it not been for  the loyal attitude of Keokuk, he could have brought the entire nation  of the Sacs and Foxes to the war-path. As it was, the flower of the  young men came with him when, with the opening spring, he crossed the  river once more. He came this time, he said, \"to plant corn,\" but as a  preliminary to this peaceful occupation of the land he marched up the  Rock River, expecting to be joined by the Winnebagoes and  Pottawatomies. But the time was passed for honorable alliances among  the Indians. His oath-bound confederates gave him little assistance,  and soon cast in their lot with the stronger party.    This movement excited general alarm in the State. General Henry  Atkinson, commanding the United States troops, sent a formal summons  to Black Hawk to return; but the old chief was already well on his way  to the lodge of his friend, the prophet Wabokishick, at Prophetstown,  and treated the summons with contemptuous defiance. The Governor  immediately called for volunteers, and was himself astonished at the  alacrity with which the call was answered. Among those who enlisted at  the first tap of the drum was Abraham Lincoln, and equally to his  surprise and delight he was elected captain of his company. The  volunteer organizations of those days were conducted on purely  democratic principles. The company assembled on the green, an election  was suggested, and three-fourths of the men walked over to where  Lincoln was standing; most of the small remainder joined themselves to  one Kirkpatrick, a man of some substance and standing from Spring  Creek. We have the word of Mr. Lincoln for it, that no subsequent  success ever gave him such unmixed pleasure as this earliest  distinction. It was a sincere, unsought tribute of his equals to those  physical and moral qualities which made him the best man of his  hundred, and as such was accepted and prized.    [Sidenote: Reynolds, \"Life and Times,\" p. 363.]    At the Beardstown rendezvous, Captain Lincoln's company was attached  to Colonel Samuel Thompson's regiment, the Fourth Illinois, which was  organized at Richland, Sangamon County, on the 21st of April, and  moved on the 27th, with the rest of the command under General Samuel  Whitesides, for Yellow Banks, where the boats with provisions had been  ordered to meet them. It was arduous marching. There were no roads and  no bridges, and the day's task included a great deal of labor. The  third day out they came to the Henderson River, a stream some fifty  yards wide, swift and swollen with the spring thaws, with high and  steep banks. To most armies this would have seemed a serious obstacle,  but these backwoodsmen swarmed to the work like beavers, and in less  than three hours the river was crossed with the loss of only one or  two horses and wagons. When they came to Yellow Banks, on the  Mississippi, the provision-boats had not arrived, and for three days  they waited there"]]]
