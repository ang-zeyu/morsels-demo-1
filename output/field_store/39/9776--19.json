[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3751"],[0,"The Psychology of Beauty (#16)"],[1,"much of the  symmetry appearing in primitive art is due (1) to the conditions  of construction, as in the form of dwellings, binding patterns,  weaving and textile patterns generally; (2) to convenience in  use, as in the shapes of spears, arrows, knives, two-handled  baskets or jars; (3) to the imitation of animal forms, as in  the shapes of pottery, etc.  On the other hand, (1) a very  great deal of symmetrical ornament maintains itself AGAINST the  suggestions of the shape to which it is applied, as the  ornaments of baskets, pottery, and all rounded objects; and  (2) all distortion, disintegration, degradation of pattern-  motives, often so marked as all but to destroy their meaning,  is in the direction of geometrical symmetry.  The early art of  all civilized nations shows the same characteristic.  Now it  might be said that, as there exists an instinctive tendency to  imitate visual forms by motor impulses, the impulses suggested  by the symmetrical form are in harmony with the system of  energies of our bilateral organism, which is a system of double  motor innervations, and thus fulfill our demand for a set of  reactions corresponding to the organism as a whole.  But we  should then expect that all space arrangements which deviate  from complete symmetry, and thus suggest motor impulses which  do not correspond to the natural bilateral type, would fail to  give aesthetic pleasure.  Such, however, is not the case.  Non-symmetrical arrangements of space are often extremely pleasing.    <1> The following is adapted from the author's _Studies in  Symmetry, Harvard Psych. Studies_, vol i, 1902.    This contradiction disappears if we are able to show that the  apparently non-symmetrical arrangement contains a hidden  symmetry, and that all the elements of that arrangement  contribute to bring about just that bilateral type of motor  impulses which is characteristic of geometrical symmetry.    A series of experiments was arranged, in which one of two  unequal lines of white on a black background being fixed in  an upright position a certain distance from the centre, the  other was shifted until the arrangement was felt to be pleasing.  It was found that when two lines of different sizes were opposed,  their relative positions corresponded to the relation of the  arms of a balance, that is, a small line far from the centre  was opposed by a large one near the centre.  A line pointing  out from the centre fitted this formula if taken as \"heavy,\"  and pointing in, if taken as \"light.\"  Similarly, objects of  intrinsic interest and objects suggesting depth in the third  dimension were \"heavy\" in the same interpretation.  All this,  however, did not go beyond the proof that all pleasing space-  arrangements can be described in terms of mechanical balance.  But what was this mechanical balance?  A metaphor explains  nothing, and no one will maintain that the visual representation  of a long line weights more than a short one.  Moreover, the  elements in the balance were so far heterogeneous.  The  movement suggested by an idea had been treated as if equivalent  to the movement actually made by the eye in following a long  line; the intrinsic interest--that is, the ideal interest--of  an object insignificant in form was equated to the attractive  power of a perspective, which has, presumably, a merely  physiological effect on the visual mechanism.    I believe, however, that the justification of this apparent  heterogeneity, and the basis for explanation, is given in the  reduction of all elements to their lowest term,--as objects  for the expenditure of attention.  A large object and an  \"interesting\" object are \"heavy\" for the same reason, because  they call out the attention.  And expenditure of effort is  expenditure of attention; thus, if an object on the outskirts  of the field of vision requires a wide sweep of the eye to take  it in, it demands the expenditure of attention, and so is felt  as \"heavy.\"  But what is \"the expenditure of attention\" in  physiological terms?  It is nothing more than the measure of  the motor impulses directed to the object of attention.  And  whether the motor impulse appears as the tendency to follow  out the suggestions of motion in the object, all reduces to  the same physiological basis.    It may here be objected that our motor impulses are, nevertheless,  still heterogeneous, inasmuch as some are toward the object of  interest, and some along the line of movement.  But it must be  said, first, that these are not felt in the body, but transferred  as values of weight to points in the picture,--it is the amount  and not the direction of excitement that is counted; and secondly,  that even if it were not so, the suggested movement along a line  is felt as \"weight\" at a particular point.    From this point of view the justification of the metaphor of  mechanical balance is quite clear.  Given two lines, the most  pleasing arrangement makes the larger nearer the centre, and  the smaller far from it.  This is balanced because the spontaneous  impulse of attention to the near, large line equals in amount  the involuntary expenditure to apprehend the small, farther one.    We may thus think of a space to be composed as a kind of target,  in which certain spots or territories count more or less, both  according to their distance from the centre and according to what  fills them.  Every element of a picture, in whatever way it gains  power to excite motor impulses, is felt as expressing that power  in the flat pattern.  A noble vista is understood and enjoyed as  a vista, but it is COUNTED in the motor equation, our \"balance,\"  as a spot of so much intrinsic value at such and such a distance  from the centre.  The skillful artist will fill his target in the  way to give the maximum of motor impulses with the perfection of  balance between them.    It is thus in a kind of substitutional symmetry, or balance, that  we have the objective condition or counterpart of aesthetic  repose, or unity.  From this point of view it is clearly seen in  what respect the unity of Hildebrand fails.  He demands in the  statue, especially, but also in the picture, the flat surface as  a unity for the three dimensions.  But it is only with the flat  space, won, if you will, by Hildebrand's method, that the problem  begins.  Every point in the third dimension counts, as has been  said, in the flat.  The Fernbild is the beginning of beauty, but  within the Fernbild favorable stimulation and repose must still  be sought.  And repose or unity is given by symmetry, subjectively  the balance of attention, inasmuch as this balance is a tension  of antagonistic impulses, an equilibrium, and thus an inhibition  of movement.    From this point of view, we are in a position to refute Souriau's  interesting analysis<1> of form as the condition for the  appreciation of content.  He says that form, in a picture for  instance, has its value in its power to produce (through its  fixation and concentration of the eye) a mild hypnosis, in which,  as is well known, all suggestions come to us with bewildering  vividness.  This is, then, just the state in which the contents  of the picture can most vividly impress themselves.  Form, then,  as the means to content, by giving the conditions for suggestion,  is Sourieau's account of it.  In so far as form--in the sense  of unity--gives, through balance and equilibrium of impulses,  the arrest of the personality, it may indeed be compared with  hypnotism.  But this arrest is not only a means, but an end in  itself; that aesthetic repose, which, as the unity of the  personality, is an essential element of the aesthetic emotion  as we have described it.    <1> _La Suggestion en l'Art_.      VI    There is no point of light or color, no contour, no line, no  depth, that does not contribute to the infinite complex which  gives the maximum of experience with the minimum of effort and  which we call beauty of form.  But yet there is another way of  viewing the beautiful object, on which we touched in the  introduction to this chapter.  So far, what we see is only  another name for HOW we see; and the way of seeing has proved  to contain enough to bring to stimulation and repose the  psychophysical mechanism.  But now we must ask, what relation  has meaning to beauty?  Is it an element, coordinate with others,  or something superposed? or is it an end in itself, the supreme  end?  What relation to the beauty of form has that quality of  their works by virtue of which Rembrandt is called a dreamer,  and Rodin a poet in stone?  What do we mean when we speak of  Sargent as a psychologist?  Is it a virtue to be a poet in  stone?  If it is, we must somehow include in our concept of  Beauty the element of expression, by showing how it serves the  infinite complex.  Or is it not an aesthetic virtue, and Rodin  is great artist and poet combined, and not great artist because  poet, as some would say?  What is the relation of the objective  content to beauty of form?  In short, what place has the idea  in Beauty?    In the preceding the place of separate objects which have only  an ideal importance has been made clear.  The gold-embroidered  gauntlet in a picture counts as a patch of light, a trend of  line, in a certain spot; but it counts more there, because it  is of interest for itself, and by thus counting more, the idea  has entered into the spatial balance,--the idea has become  itself form.  Now it is the question whether all \"idea,\" which  seems so heterogeneous in its relation to form, does not undergo  this transmutation.  It is at least of interest to see whether  the facts can be so interpreted.    We have spoken of ideas a parts of an aesthetic whole.  What of  the idea of the whole?  Corot used to say he painted a dream,  and it is the dream of an autumn morning we see in his pictures.  Millet portrays the sad majesty and sweetness of the life near  the soil.

Sparrows and Mice grow dry  and shrivelled, unused, upon the gibbet. Sooner in one case, later in  another, my Necrophori abandon the insoluble problem in mechanics: to  push, ever so little, the movable support and so to unhook the coveted  carcass.    Curious reasoners, in faith! If they had had, but now, a lucid idea of  the mutual relations between the shackled limbs and the suspending peg;  if they had made the Mouse fall by a reasoned manoeuvre, whence comes  it that the present artifice, no less simple than the first, is to them  an insurmountable obstacle? For days and days they work on the body,  examine it from head to foot, without becoming aware of the movable  support, the cause of their misadventure. In vain do I prolong my  watch; never do I see a single one of them push it with his foot or  butt it with his head.    Their defeat is not due to lack of strength. Like the Geotrupes, they  are vigorous excavators. Grasped in the closed hand, they insinuate  themselves through the interstices of the fingers and plough up your  skin in a fashion to make you very quickly loose your hold. With his  head, a robust ploughshare, the Beetle might very easily push the ring  off its short support. He is not able to do so because he does not  think of it; he does not think of it because he is devoid of the  faculty attributed to him, in order to support its thesis, by the  dangerous prodigality of transformism.    Divine reason, sun of the intellect, what a clumsy slap in thy august  countenance, when the glorifiers of the animal degrade thee with such  dullness!    Let us now examine under another aspect the mental obscurity of the  Necrophori. My captives are not so satisfied with their sumptuous  lodging that they do not seek to escape, especially when there is a  dearth of labour, that sovran consoler of the afflicted, man or beast.  Internment within the wire cover palls upon them. So, the Mole buried  and all in order in the cellar, they stray uneasily over the wire-gauze  of the dome; they clamber up, descend, ascend again and take to flight,  a flight which instantly becomes a fall, owing to collision with the  wire grating. They pick themselves up and begin again. The sky is  superb; the weather is hot, calm and propitious for those in search of  the Lizard crushed beside the footpath. Perhaps the effluvia of the  gamy tit-bit have reached them, coming from afar, imperceptible to any  other sense than that of the Sexton-beetles. So my Necrophori are fain  to go their ways.    Can they? Nothing would be easier if a glimmer of reason were to aid  them. Through the wire network, over which they have so often strayed,  they have seen, outside, the free soil, the promised land which they  long to reach. A hundred times if once have they dug at the foot of the  rampart. There, in vertical wells, they take up their station, drowsing  whole days on end while unemployed. If I give them a fresh Mole, they  emerge from their retreat by the entrance corridor and come to hide  themselves beneath the belly of the beast. The burial over, they  return, one here, one there, to the confines of the enclosure and  disappear beneath the soil.    Well, in two and a half months of captivity, despite long stays at the  base of the trellis, at a depth of three-quarters of an inch beneath  the surface, it is rare indeed for a Necrophorus to succeed in  circumventing the obstacle, to prolong his excavation beneath the  barrier, to make an elbow in it and to bring it out on the other side,  a trifling task for these vigorous creatures. Of fourteen only one  succeeded in escaping.    A chance deliverance and not premeditated; for, if the happy event had  been the result of a mental combination, the other prisoners,  practically his equals in powers of perception, would all, from first  to last, discover by rational means the elbowed path leading to the  outer world; and the cage would promptly be deserted. The failure of  the great majority proves that the single fugitive was simply digging  at random. Circumstances favoured him; and that is all. Do not let us  make it a merit that he succeeded where all the others failed.    Let us also beware of attributing to the Necrophori an understanding  more limited than is usual in entomological psychology. I find the  ineptness of the undertaker in all the insects reared under the wire  cover, on the bed of sand into which the rim of the dome sinks a little  way. With very rare exceptions, fortuitous accidents, no insect has  thought of circumventing the barrier by way of the base; none has  succeeded in gaining the exterior by means of a slanting tunnel, not  even though it were a miner by profession, as are the Dung-beetles par  excellence. Captives under the wire dome, but desirous of escape,  Sacred Beetles, Geotrupes, Copres, Gymnopleuri, Sisyphi, all see about  them the freedom of space, the joys of the open sunlight; and not one  thinks of going round under the rampart, a front which would present no  difficulty to their pick-axes.    Even in the higher ranks of animality, examples of similar mental  obfuscation are not lacking. Audubon relates how, in his days, the wild  Turkeys were caught in North America.    In a clearing known to be frequented by these birds, a great cage was  constructed with stakes driven into the ground. In the centre of the  enclosure opened a short tunnel, which dipped under the palisade and  returned to the surface outside the cage by a gentle slope, which was  open to the sky. The central opening, large enough to give a bird free  passage, occupied only a portion of the enclosure, leaving around it,  against the circle of stakes, a wide unbroken zone. A few handfuls of  maize were scattered in the interior of the trap, as well as round  about it, and in particular along the sloping path, which passed under  a sort of bridge and led to the centre of the contrivance. In short,  the Turkey-trap presented an ever-open door. The bird found it in order  to enter, but did not think of looking for it in order to return by it.    According to the famous American ornithologist, the Turkeys, lured by  the grains of maize, descended the insidious slope, entered the short  underground passage and beheld, at the end of it, plunder and the  light. A few steps farther and the gluttons emerged, one by one, from  beneath the bridge. They distributed themselves about the enclosure.  The maize was abundant; and the Turkeys' crops grew swollen.    When all was gathered, the band wished to retreat, but not one of the  prisoners paid any attention to the central hole by which he had  arrived. Gobbling uneasily, they passed again and again across the  bridge whose arch was yawning beside them; they circled round against  the palisade, treading a hundred times in their own footprints; they  thrust their necks, with their crimson wattles, through the bars; and  there, with beaks in the open air, they remained until they were  exhausted.    Remember, inept fowl, the occurrences of a little while ago; think of  the tunnel which led you hither! If there be in that poor brain of  yours an atom of capacity, put two ideas together and remind yourself  that the passage by which you entered is there and open for your  escape! You will do nothing of the kind. The light, an irresistible  attraction, holds you subjugated against the palisade; and the shadow  of the yawning pit, which has but lately permitted you to enter and  will quite as readily permit of your exit, leaves you indifferent. To  recognize the use of this opening you would have to reflect a little,  to evolve the past; but this tiny retrospective calculation is beyond  your powers. So the trapper, returning a few days later, will find a  rich booty, the entire flock imprisoned!    Of poor intellectual repute, does the Turkey deserve his name for  stupidity? He does not appear to be more limited than another. Audubon  depicts him as endowed with certain useful ruses, in particular when he  has to baffle the attacks of his nocturnal enemy, the Virginian Owl. As  for his actions in the snare with the underground passage, any other  bird, impassioned of the light, would do the same.    Under rather more difficult conditions, the Necrophorus repeats the  ineptness of the Turkey. When he wishes to return to the open daylight,  after resting in a short burrow against the rim of the wire cover, the  Beetle, seeing a little light filtering down through the loose soil,  reascends by the path of entry, incapable of telling himself that it  would suffice to prolong the tunnel as far in the opposite direction  for him to reach the outer world beyond the wall and gain his freedom.  Here again is one in whom we shall seek in vain for any indication of  reflection. Like the rest, in spite of his legendary renown, he has no  guide but the unconscious promptings of instinct.        CHAPTER 7. THE BLUEBOTTLE.    To purge the earth of death's impurities and cause deceased animal  matter to be once more numbered among the treasures of life there are  hosts of sausage-queens, including, in our part of the world, the  Bluebottle (Calliphora vomitaria, Lin.) and the Grey Flesh-fly  (Sarcophaga carnaria, Lin.) Every one knows the first, the big,  dark-blue Fly who, after effecting her designs in the ill-watched  meat-safe, settles on our window-panes and keeps up a solemn buzzing,  anxious to be off in the sun and ripen a fresh emission of germs. How  does she lay her eggs, the origin of the loathsome maggot that battens  poisonously on our provisions whether of game or butcher's meat? What  are her stratagems and how can we foil them? This is what I propose to  investigate.    The Bluebottle frequents our homes during autumn and a part of winter,  until the cold becomes severe; but her appearance in the fields dates  back much earlier.
