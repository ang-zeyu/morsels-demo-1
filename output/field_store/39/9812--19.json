It is well described by Chemnitz, and  his figures are very tolerable; yet, like all the authors of that period,  he considered it as a variety of _Helix ampullacea_. From all these  supposed varieties it is, nevertheless, quite distinct; the spire is more  depressed than that of any other species, and the umbilicus is placed near  the bottom of the inner lip: the whole shell is very smooth, and, although  generally of a uniform yellowish olive colour, is sometimes marked by  narrow bands of purple brown. The margin of the outer lip is slightly  reflected, and the colour, beneath the epidermis, almost white. It is a  native of the rivers of India.    From the remarks on this genus, made at Plate 103, the fact of their  opercula being either shelly or horny, is sufficiently established. These  formations, however, there is every reason to suppose, may generally be  detected by the following indications. In such species as have a shelly  operculum, the margin of the aperture is thickened all round, and has a  parallel internal groove for its reception: the probable use of this groove  I have detailed elsewhere. On the other hand, in those species which are  known to have horny opercula, this margin and groove do not exist; and that  part of the shell which is between the top of the aperture and the  umbilicus, is thin and unprotected. This latter formation is by far the  most frequent, and leads to the conclusion that the majority of these  shells have their opercula horny.    On the distinctions between this genus and _Planorbis_, little need be  said. The principal difference consists in the latter having no operculum;  but another, and a very remarkable one, (which seems to have escaped all  writers,) is, that the shells of the latter genus are destitute of any  columella. The _Planorbis cornu-arietis_ of Lamarck, has been removed by  Mr. G. Sowerby to this genus. This shell, it is true, appears to be  intermediate between one and the other; but the only affinity which it  bears to _Ampullaria_, is in the oval form of the aperture; while it is  allied to _Planorbis_ by its discoid form, want of the columella, and being  universally described as without an operculum: the preponderance of  evidence is clearly in favour of the situation originally assigned to it by  Lamarck.    The characters, therefore, given to the genus _Ampullaria_ by Mr. G.  Sowerby, will be found incorrect. There was no necessity for explaining,  much less for altering, (in this instance,) the masterly definitions of  Cuvier and Lamarck. With regard to the second species given by Mr. Sowerby  to illustrate this genus, he is no less in error; for the real _A. rugosa_,  of all authors, is a strikingly distinct shell from that which he has  figured under this name. This will be sufficiently obvious by referring to  the figures either of Lister, Chemnitz, or Lamarck.    Having offered these remarks on a subject to which I have paid some  attention, I wish to refrain from pointedly noticing other errors and  misconceptions into which Mr. G. Sowerby has fallen; rather wishing that  greater experience, and more matured judgment, may lead him to do this  himself, prior to the publication of the system of Conchology which he has  announced.           *       *       *       *       *      GENERAL ALPHABETIC INDEX    OF    LATIN AND ENGLISH NAMES    TO    VOLUME II.

Soon after, as Sheridan pushed forward, the  Washington end twitched vigorously. He managed, however, with his right  arm, Custer, to deal a sledge-hammer blow, which broke to fragments the  Cheyenne Black-kettle and his band. Whether or not that band had been  guilty of the recent murders, the property of the slain was found in  their possession, and the terrible punishment caused the residue of the  tribe to sue for peace. It was the first time for years that the war  spirit had placed any horrors at their doors, and that one terrible  lesson prepared the savage mind for the advent of peace commissioners.    Our brief conference ended, the General bade us good day, and wished us  a pleasant experience. Scarcely had we got beyond his tents, however,  when we were overtaken by a decidedly unpleasant one. On their way to  water, a troop of mules stampeded, and passing us in a cloud of dust,  our brutes took bits in their teeth, and joined company. Happily, the  run was a short one to the creek, where those of us who had not fallen  off before managed to do so then. Poor Gripe was the only person  injured, suffering the fracture of a rib, which necessitated his return  to Topeka, so that we did not see him again until some months afterward,  when we met him on the Solomon.          CHAPTER X.         HAYS CITY BY LAMP-LIGHT--THE SANTA FE       TRADE--BULL-WHACKERS--MEXICANS--SABBATH ON THE PLAINS--THE DARK       AGES--WILD BILL AND BUFFALO BILL--OFF FOR THE SALINE--DOBEEN'S       GHOST-STORY--AN ADVENTURE WITH INDIANS--MEXICAN CANNONADE--A       RUNAWAY.      Hays City by lamp-light was remarkably lively and not very moral. The  streets blazed with the reflection from saloons, and a glance within  showed floors crowded with dancers, the gaily dressed women striving to  hide with ribbons and paint the terrible lines which that grim artist,  Dissipation, loves to draw upon such faces. With a heartless humor he  daubs the noses of the sterner sex a cherry red, but paints under the  once bright eyes of woman a shade dark as the night in the cave of  despair. To the music of violin and stamping of feet, the dance went on,  and we saw in the giddy maze old men who must have been pirouetting on  the very edge of their graves.    Being then the depot for the great Santa Fe trade, the town was crowded  with Mexicans and speculators. Large warehouses along the track were  stored with wool awaiting shipment east, and with merchandise to be  taken back with the returning wagons. These latter are of immense size,  and, from this circumstance, are sometimes called \"prairie schooners;\"  and, in truth, when a train of them is winding its way over the plains,  the white covers flecking its surface like sails, the sight is not  unlike a fleet coming into port. Oxen and mules are both used. When the  former, the drivers rejoice in the title of \"bull-whackers,\" and the  crack of their whips, as loud as the report of a rifle, is something  tremendous.    On the day of our arrival at Hays City, one of these festive individuals  noticed Dobeen gazing, with open mouth, and back towards him, at some  object across the street, and took the opportunity to crack his lash  within an inch of the Irishman's spine. The effect was ludicrous; Shamus  came in on the run to have a ball extracted from his back!    These Mexicans who come through with the ox-trains are a very degraded  race, dark, dirty, and dismal. In appearance, they much resemble  animated bundles of rags, walking off with heads of charcoal. Personal  bravery is not one of their striking characteristics; indeed, they often  run away when to stand still would seem to an American the only safe  course possible. We were desirous of sending back to Hays City some of  the proceeds of our excursion for shipment to friends at St. Louis and  Chicago, and therefore hired two of the Mexican teamsters to go as far  as the Saline, and return with the fruits of our prowess. For this  service, which would occupy about four days, they were to receive  twenty-five dollars each.    The morrow was Sunday, and came to us, as nine-tenths of the mornings on  the plains did afterward, clear and bracing. Compared with the previous  evening, the little town was very quiet. There was no stir in the  streets, although later in the morning a few of the last night's  carousers came out of doors, rubbing their sleepy eyes, and slunk around  town for the remainder of the day. All nature was calm and beautiful; it  almost seemed as if we might hear the chime of Sabbath bells float to us  from somewhere in the depths around.    One of our sea legends recites that ship wrecked bells, fallen from the  society of men to that of mermaids, are straightway hung on coral  steeples, where, when storms roar around the rocks above, they toll for  the deaths of the mariners. Was it impossible, we mused, that ancient  mariners, with whole cargoes of bells, went down on this inland sea  centuries before Rome howled? The earth around us might be as full of  musical tongues as of saurians, and only awaiting the savan's spade and  sympathetic touch to give their dumb eloquence voice. If the people of  those days were navigators, surely they might also have been men of  metal. In the far-away past existed numerous arts which baffle modern  ingenuity. Stones were lifted at sight of which our engineers stand  dismayed. Bodies were embalmed with a skill and perfection which our  medical faculty admire, but have scarcely even essayed to imitate. Is it  impossible that vessels plowed this ancient ocean with a speed which  would have left our Cunarders out of sight? If human spirits freed from  earth take cognizance of following generations, how those old captains  must have laughed when Fulton boarded his wheezing experiment to paddle  up the Hudson! And if our doctor's Darwinian-Pythagorean theory were  correct, Fulton's spirit might have brought the crude idea from some  ancient stoker.    But while we were thus speculating and giving free reins to Fancy's most  erratic moods, the chaplain arrived from the fort, and mounting the  freight platform, read the Episcopal morning service. A crowd gathered  around, and a voice from the past whispering in their ears, a few bowed  their heads during prayer. A drunkard went brawling by, with a sidelong  glance and the leering look of eyes whose watery lids seemed making vain  efforts to quench the fiery balls. How it grated on one's feelings! In a  land so eloquent with voices of the mighty past, it seemed as if even  instinct would cause the knee to bow in homage before its Maker.    Monday was our day of final preparation, and we commenced it by making  the acquaintance of those two celebrated characters, Wild Bill and  Buffalo Bill, or, more correctly, William Hickock and William Cody. The  former was acting as sheriff of the town, and the latter we engaged as  our guide to the Saline.    Wild Bill made his _entree_ into one court of the temple of fame some  years since through Harper's Magazine. Since then his name has become a  household word to residents along the Kansas frontier. We found him very  quiet and gentlemanly, and not at all the reckless fellow we had  supposed. His form won our admiration--the shoulders of a Hercules with  the waist of a girl. Much has been written about Wild Bill that is pure  fiction. I do not believe, for example, that he could hit a nickel  across the street with a pistol-ball, any more than an Indian could do  so with an arrow. These feats belong to romance. Bill is wonderfully  handy with his pistols, however. He then carried two of them, and while  we were at Hays snuffed a man's life out with one; but this was done in  his capacity of officer. Two rowdies devoted their energies to brewing a  riot, and defied arrest until, at Bill's first shot, one fell dead, and  the other threw up his arms in token of submission. During his life time  Bill has probably killed his baker's dozen of men, but he has never, I  believe, been known as the aggressor. To the people of Hays he was a  valuable officer, making arrests when and where none other dare attempt  it. His power lies in the wonderful quickness with which he draws a  pistol and takes his aim. These first shots, however, can not always  last. \"They that take the sword shall perish with the sword;\" and living  as he does by the pistol, Bill will certainly die by it, unless he  abandons the frontier.
