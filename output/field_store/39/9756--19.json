She was an excellent housewife, and did a deal of good among the  poor; for which, I believe, she is at this very time in paradise.  Alas, her death broke old William's heart; he soon followed her, poor  man, and left all to his little daughter, that Marcella by name,  giving charge of her to her uncle, the parson of our parish. When she  came to be fourteen or fifteen years of age, no man set his eyes on  her that did not bless heaven for having made her so handsome; so that  most men fell in love with her, and were ready to run mad for her. All  this while her uncle kept her very close: yet the report of her great  beauty and wealth spread far and near, insomuch that almost all the  young men in our town asked her of her uncle; nay, there flocked whole  droves of suitors, and the very best in the country too, who all  begged, and sued, and teazed her uncle to let them have her. But  though he'd have been glad to have got fairly rid of her, yet would  not he advise or marry her against her will; for he's a good man, I'll  say that for him, and a true Christian every inch of him, and scorns  to keep her from marrying to make a benefit of her estate; and, to his  praise be it spoken, he has been mainly commended for it more than  once, when the people of our parish meet together. \"For I would have  you know, Sir Errant, that here in the country, and in our little  towns, there is not the least thing can be said or done but people  will talk and find fault: indeed, the parson must be essentially good  who could bring his whole parish to give him a good word.\" \"Thou art  in the right,\" cried Don Quixote, \"and therefore go on; for the story  is pleasant, and thou tellest it with a grace.\" \"May I never want  God's grace,\" quoth Pedro, \"for that is most to the purpose. But for  our parson, as I told you before, though he took care to let her know  of all those proposals, yet would she never answer otherwise, but that  she had no mind to wed as yet, as finding herself too young for the  burden of wedlock. But behold, when we least dreamed of it, the coy  lass must needs turn shepherdess; and neither her uncle, nor all those  of the village who advised her against it, could persuade her, but  away she went to the fields to keep her own sheep with the other young  lasses of the town. But then it was ten times worse; for no sooner was  she seen abroad, when I cannot tell how many spruce gallants, both  gentlemen and rich farmers, changed their garb for love of her, and  followed her up and down in shepherd's guise. One of them, as I have  told you, was this same Chrysostome, who now lies dead, of whom it is  said he not only loved, but worshipped her. In this way Marcella does  more harm in this country than the plague would do; for her  courteousness and fair looks draw on every body to love her; but then  her reserve and disdain break their hearts; and all they can do, poor  wretches, is to make a heavy complaint, and call her cruel, unkind,  ungrateful, and a world of such names, whereby they plainly shew what  a sad condition they are in: were you but to stay here some time, you  would hear these hills and valleys ring again with the doleful moans  of those she has denied, who yet have not courage to give over  following her. Here sighs one shepherd, there another moans; here is  one singing doleful ditties, there another is wringing his hands and  making woful complaints. And all this while the hard-hearted Marcella  never minds any one of them, and does not seem to be the least  concerned for them. We are all at a loss to know what will be the end  of all this pride and coyness, and who shall be the happy man that  shall at last succeed in taming her. Now, because there is nothing  more certain than all this, I am the more apt to give credit to what  our comrade has told us, as to the occasion of Chrysostome's death;  and therefore I would needs have you go and see him laid in his grave  to-morrow; which I believe will be worth your while, for he had many  friends, and it is not half a league to the place where it was his  will to be buried.\" \"I intend to be there,\" answered Don Quixote; \"and  in the mean time I return thee many thanks for the extraordinary  satisfaction this story has afforded me.\"          CHAPTER X.    _A continuation of the story of Marcella._      Scarce had day begun to appear from the balconies of the east, when  five of the goatherds got up, and having waked Don Quixote, asked him  if he held to his resolution of going to the funeral, whither they  were ready to bear him company. Thereupon the knight presently arose,  and ordered Sancho to get ready immediately; which he did with all  expedition, and then they set forwards. They had not gone a quarter of  a league before they saw advancing out of a cross path six shepherds  clad in black skins, their heads crowned with garlands of cypress and  bitter rose-bay-tree, with long holly-staves in their hands. Two  gentlemen on horseback, attended by three young lads on foot, followed  them: as they drew near, they saluted one another civilly, and after  the usual question,--\"Which way do you travel?\" they found they were  all going the same way, to see the funeral; and so they all joined  company. \"I fancy, Senior Vivaldo,\" said one of the gentlemen,  addressing himself to the other, \"we shall not think our time misspent  in going to see this famous funeral, for it must of necessity be very  extraordinary, according to the account which these men have given us  of the dead shepherd and his murdering shepherdess.\" \"I am so far of  your opinion,\" answered Vivaldo, \"that I would not stay one day, but a  whole week, rather than miss the sight.\" After this Vivaldo asked the  knight why he travelled so completely armed in so peaceable a country?  \"My profession,\" answered the champion, \"does not permit me to ride  otherwise. Luxurious feasts, sumptuous dresses, and downy ease, were  invented for effeminate courtiers; but labour, vigilance, and arms are  the portion of those whom the world calls knights-errant, of which  number I have the honour to be one, though the most unworthy.\" He  needed to say no more to satisfy them that his brains were out of  order; however, that they might the better understand the nature of  his folly, Vivaldo asked him what he meant by a knight-errant? \"Have  you not read, then,\" cried Don Quixote, \"the Annals and History of  Britain, where are recorded the famous deeds of King Arthur, who,  according to an ancient tradition in that kingdom, never died, but was  turned into a raven by enchantment, and shall one day resume his  former shape, and recover his kingdom again? For which reason, since  that time, the people of Great Britain dare not offer to kill a  raven.\"    After a great deal of conversation of this kind, the travellers were  sufficiently convinced of Don Quixote's frenzy. Nor were they less  surprised than were all those who had hitherto discovered so  unaccountable a distraction in one who seemed a rational creature.  However, Vivaldo, who was of a gay disposition, had no sooner made the  discovery than he resolved to make the best advantage of it that the  shortness of the way would allow him.    \"Methinks, Sir Knight-errant,\" said he, \"you have taken up one of the  strictest and most mortifying professions in the world. I do not think  but that even a Carthusian friar has a better time of it than you  have.\" \"The profession of the Carthusian,\" answered Don Quixote, \"may  be as austere, but ours is perhaps hardly less beneficial to the  world. We knights, like soldiers, execute what they pray for, and  procure those benefits to mankind, by the strength of our arms, and at  the hazard of our lives, for which they only intercede. Nor do we do  this sheltered from the injuries of the air, but under no other roof  than that of the wide heavens, exposed to summer's scorching heat, and  winter's pinching cold. However, gentlemen, do not imagine I would  insinuate as if the profession of a knight-errant was a state of  perfection equal to that of a holy recluse: I would only infer from  what I have said, and what I myself endure, that ours without question  is more laborious, more subject to the discipline of heavy blows, to  maceration, to the penance of hunger and thirst, and, in a word, to  rags, to want, and misery. For if you find that some knights-errant  have at last by their valour been raised to thrones and empires, you  may be sure it has been still at the expense of much sweat and blood.  And had even those happier knights been deprived of those assisting  sages and enchanters, who helped them in all emergencies, they would  have been strangely disappointed of their mighty expectations.\" \"I am  of the same opinion,\" replied Vivaldo. \"But one thing I would ask,  sir, since I understand it is so much the being of knight-errantry to  be in love, I presume you, who are of that profession, cannot be  without a mistress. And therefore, if you do not set up for secrecy,  give me leave to beg of you, in the name of all the company, that you  will be pleased so far to oblige us as to let us know the name and  quality of your lady, the place of her birth, and the charms of her  person. For, without doubt, she cannot but esteem herself fortunate in  being known to all the world to be the object of the wishes of a  knight so accomplished as yourself.\" With that Don Quixote, breathing  out a deep sigh, \"I cannot tell,\" said he, \"whether this lovely enemy  of my repose is the least affected with the world's being informed of  her power over my heart; all I dare say, in compliance with your  request is, that her name is Dulcinea, her country La Mancha, and  Toboso the happy place which she"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/360"],[0,"What is Property? An Inquiry into the Principle of Right and of Government (#16)"],[1,", and as a  dormant faculty without exercise; that for the others, who do enjoy it,  it is susceptible of certain transactions and modifications which do  not harmonize with the idea of a natural right; that, in practice,  governments, tribunals, and laws do not respect it; and finally that  everybody, spontaneously and with one voice, regards it as chimerical.    Liberty is inviolable. I can neither sell nor alienate my liberty;  every contract, every condition of a contract, which has in view the  alienation or suspension of liberty, is null: the slave, when he plants  his foot upon the soil of liberty, at that moment becomes a free man.  When society seizes a malefactor and deprives him of his liberty, it is  a case of legitimate defence: whoever violates the social compact by the  commission of a crime declares himself a public enemy; in attacking the  liberty of others, he compels them to take away his own. Liberty is the  original condition of man; to renounce liberty is to renounce the nature  of man: after that, how could we perform the acts of man?    Likewise, equality before the law suffers neither restriction nor  exception. All Frenchmen are equally eligible to office: consequently,  in the presence of this equality, condition and family have, in many  cases, no influence upon choice. The poorest citizen can obtain judgment  in the courts against one occupying the most exalted station. Let the  millionaire, Ahab, build a chateau upon the vineyard of Naboth: the  court will have the power, according to the circumstances, to order the  destruction of the chateau, though it has cost millions; and to force  the trespasser to restore the vineyard to its original state, and pay  the damages. The law wishes all property, that has been legitimately  acquired, to be kept inviolate without regard to value, and without  respect for persons.    The charter demands, it is true, for the exercise of certain political  rights, certain conditions of fortune and capacity; but all publicists  know that the legislator's intention was not to establish a privilege,  but to take security. Provided the conditions fixed by law are complied  with, every citizen may be an elector, and every elector eligible. The  right, once acquired, is the same for all; the law compares neither  persons nor votes. I do not ask now whether this system is the best; it  is enough that, in the opinion of the charter and in the eyes of every  one, equality before the law is absolute, and, like liberty, admits of  no compromise.    It is the same with the right of security. Society promises its members  no half-way protection, no sham defence; it binds itself to them as  they bind themselves to it. It does not say to them, \"I will shield  you, provided it costs me nothing; I will protect you, if I run no risks  thereby.\" It says, \"I will defend you against everybody; I will save and  avenge you, or perish myself.\"    The whole strength of the State is at the service of each citizen; the  obligation which binds them together is absolute.    How different with property! Worshipped by all, it is acknowledged by  none: laws, morals, customs, public and private conscience, all plot its  death and ruin.    To meet the expenses of government, which has armies to support, tasks  to perform, and officers to pay, taxes are needed. Let all contribute to  these expenses: nothing more just. But why should the rich pay more than  the poor? That is just, they say, because they possess more. I confess  that such justice is beyond my comprehension.    Why are taxes paid? To protect all in the exercise of their natural  rights--liberty, equality, security, and property; to maintain order in  the State; to furnish the public with useful and pleasant conveniences.    Now, does it cost more to defend the rich man's life and liberty than  the poor man's? Who, in time of invasion, famine, or plague, causes  more trouble,--the large proprietor who escapes the evil without  the assistance of the State, or the laborer who sits in his cottage  unprotected from danger?    Is public order endangered more by the worthy citizen, or by the artisan  and journeyman? Why, the police have more to fear from a few hundred  laborers, out of work, than from two hundred thousand electors!    Does the man of large income appreciate more keenly than the poor man  national festivities, clean streets, and beautiful monuments?    Why, he prefers his country-seat to all the popular pleasures; and when  he wants to enjoy himself, he does not wait for the greased pole!    One of two things is true: either the proportional tax affords greater  security to the larger tax-payers, or else it is a wrong.    Because, if property is a natural right, as the Declaration of '93  declares, all that belongs to me by virtue of this right is as sacred as  my person; it is my blood, my life, myself: whoever touches it offends  the apple of my eye. My income of one hundred thousand francs is as  inviolable as the grisette's daily wage of seventy-five centimes; her  attic is no more sacred than my suite of apartments. The tax is not  levied in proportion to strength, size, or skill: no more should it be  levied in proportion to property.    If, then, the State takes more from me, let it give me more in return,  or cease to talk of equality of rights; for otherwise, society is  established, not to defend property, but to destroy it. The State,  through the proportional tax, becomes the chief of robbers; the State  sets the example of systematic pillage: the State should be brought to  the bar of justice at the head of those hideous brigands, that execrable  mob which it now kills from motives of professional jealousy.    But, they say, the courts and the police force are established to  restrain this mob; government is a company, not exactly for insurance,  for it does not insure, but for vengeance and repression. The premium  which this company exacts, the tax, is divided in proportion to  property; that is, in proportion to the trouble which each piece of  property occasions the avengers and repressers paid by the government.    This is any thing but the absolute and inalienable right of property.  Under this system the poor and the rich distrust, and make war upon,  each other. But what is the object of the war? Property. So that  property is necessarily accompanied by war upon property. The liberty  and security of the rich do not suffer from the liberty and security  of the poor; far from that, they mutually strengthen and sustain each  other. The rich man's right of property, on the contrary, has to be  continually defended against the poor man's desire for property. What  a contradiction! In England they have a poor-rate: they wish me to pay  this tax. But what relation exists between my natural and inalienable  right of property and the hunger from which ten million wretched people  are suffering? When religion commands us to assist our fellows, it  speaks in the name of charity, not in the name of law. The obligation  of benevolence, imposed upon me by Christian morality, cannot be imposed  upon me as a political tax for the benefit of any person or poor-house.  I will give alms when I see fit to do so, when the sufferings of others  excite in me that sympathy of which philosophers talk, and in which I do  not believe: I will not be forced to bestow them. No one is obliged to  do more than comply with this injunction: IN THE EXERCISE OF YOUR OWN  RIGHTS DO NOT ENCROACH UPON THE RIGHTS OF ANOTHER; an injunction which  is the exact definition of liberty. Now, my possessions are my own;  no one has a claim upon them: I object to the placing of the third  theological virtue in the order of the day.    Everybody, in France, demands the conversion of the five per cent.  bonds; they demand thereby the complete sacrifice of one species of  property. They have the right to do it, if public necessity requires it;  but where is the just indemnity promised by the charter? Not only  does none exist, but this indemnity is not even possible; for, if the  indemnity were equal to the property sacrificed, the conversion would be  useless.    The State occupies the same position to-day toward the bondholders  that the city of Calais did, when besieged by Edward III, toward its  notables. The English conqueror consented to spare its inhabitants,  provided it would surrender to him its most distinguished citizens to do  with as he pleased. Eustache and several others offered themselves; it  was noble in them, and our ministers should recommend their example to  the bondholders. But had the city the right to surrender them? Assuredly  not. The right to security is absolute; the country can require no one  to sacrifice himself. The soldier standing guard within the enemy's  range is no exception to this rule. Wherever a citizen stands guard,  the country stands guard with him: to-day it is the turn of the one,  to-morrow of the other. When danger and devotion are common, flight is  parricide. No one has the right to flee from danger; no one can serve  as a scapegoat. The maxim of Caiaphas--IT IS RIGHT THAT A MAN SHOULD DIE  FOR HIS NATION--is that of the populace and of tyrants; the two extremes  of social degradation.    It is said that all perpetual annuities are essentially redeemable. This  maxim of civil law, applied to the State, is good for those who wish to  return to the natural equality of labor and wealth; but, from the point  of view of the proprietor, and in the mouth of conversionists, it is  the language of bankrupts. The State is not only a borrower, it is an  insurer and guardian of property; granting the best of security, it  assures the most inviolable possession. How, then, can it force open the  hands of its creditors, who have confidence in it, and then talk to  them of public order and security of property? The State, in such  an operation, is not a debtor who discharges his debt; it is a  stock-comp"]]]
