The \"Prophet's\"  father, who, prior to the discovery of the alleged divine mission of  his son, eked out only a scanty living as a dispenser of cake and root  beer, [170] now became the dispenser of patriarchal blessings at ten  dollars per week and expenses, [171] and later at three dollars per  bless. [172]    [Footnote 170: \"Origin, Rise and Progress of Mormonism,\" 12.]    [Footnote 171: 15 _Millennial Star_, 308.]    [Footnote 172: \"Mormon Portraits,\" 16.]    The Prophet's brothers and friends received a gift of real estate by  revelation, [173] and another brother of the Prophet was retained in a  holy office, though confessedly concealing his property to cheat his  creditors. [174]    [Footnote 173: Doctrine and Covenants, Sec. 94.]    [Footnote 174: 15 _Millennial Star_, 520.]    These are a part and by no means all of the evidence tending to  establish that a desire for money was the inspiring cause of every act  of the Mormon Prophet, the very divinity that moulded his thoughts  and revelations, and brought into being Mormon's books. Before  becoming a Prophet, Joseph Smith's earning capacity as a peep-stone  money digger was $14 per month. [175] Soon after becoming a Prophet he  became president of a bank. [176] In 1842 the Prophet (together with  his brother Hyrum and Sidney Rigdon) took advantage of the bankruptcy  law to avoid creditors, whose claims amounted to one hundred thousand  dollars. [177] A few years later the Prophet was killed, he being at the  time the richest man in Nauvoo.    [Footnote 175: 16 _Millennial Star,_ 151.]    [Footnote 176: \"Gleanings by the Way,\" 334. Sometimes Smith was cashier  and Rigdon President. \"Prophet of Palmyra,\" 135.]    [Footnote 177: 19 _Millennial Star_, 343. 20 _Millennial Star,_  106-216-246. \"Mormonism and Mormons,\" 338.]    Through the whole story of their lives, if we may believe their alleged  revelations to come from on high, God manifests in the conspirators'  behalf a greed for earthly prosperity which would disgrace any decent  man who should attempt to gratify it at the expense of a like number of  poverty-stricken, ignorant unfortunates.    It is perhaps a work of supererogation, yet I cannot readily resist  calling attention to the human side of the conspirators, when they came  to fall out, over the division of the spoils. Many, even Brigham Young  included, suspected Joseph Smith of misappropriating church money. [178]  Brigham, however, had his suspicions allayed, for the Lord actually put  money into his trunk. [179] This would, of course, be very convincing  evidence that a man might have much money without misappropriating  anything, even months later fail with $150,000 of liabilities and  practically though a bank established by revelation, [180] should a few  no assets, and after only eight months of business. [181]    [Footnote 178: _Deseret News,_ April 8, 1857, p. 36.]    [Footnote 179: 2 _Journal of Discourses_, 128. 7 _Deseret News_, 115.]    [Footnote 180: Statement of Warren Parrish, copied in \"An Exposure  of Mormonism,\" 10. _Messenger and Advocate,_ January 1837, copied in  \"Prophet of Palmyra,\" 134. _Deseret News,_ December 21, 1864, Vol. 14,  p. 94, says \"under the direction of the Prophet.\"]    [Footnote 181: Statement of Warren Parrish, copied in \"An Exposure  of Mormonism,\" 11. [The above sentence lacks clearness, but it is  _verbatim_ from Mr. Schroeder's article, and I do not feel at liberty  to suggest the meaning.--R.]]    At one time Cowdery, a witness to the divinity of the Book of Mormon,  invited suspicion that he was converting more than his share of the  spoils, and the following revelation was the result:        \"It is not wisdom in me that he [Cowdery] should be entrusted      with the commandments, and the moneys which he shall carry unto      the land of Zion, _except one go with him who will be true and      faithful._\" [182]    [Footnote 182: Doctrine and Covenants, 6:91.]    The most forceful incident of this sort, however, occurred as the  result of jealousy between Rigdon and Smith, which manifests itself  in scores of ways all through their lives. When Rigdon on his visit  to the Prophet in New York desires to be proclaimed a translator of  remaining plates given by the angel to Smith, and as having the same  power as Joseph Smith, the former's ambitions are quietly squelched by  a revelation from God to Rigdon, saying: \"It is not expedient in me  that ye should translate any more until ye shall go to Ohio,\" [183] but  the rest of the plates never were translated. [184]    [Footnote 183: Doctrine and Covenants, Sec. 37.]    [Footnote 184: 19 _Journal of Discourses_, 18-216-218. \"Reminiscences  of Joseph the Prophet,\" 14.]    When Cowdery and perhaps Rigdon importune their partner in fraud to  be elevated to the prophetic office, Smith resists with a revelation  in which God is made to say: \"No one shall be appointed to receive  commandments and revelations in this church, excepting my servant  Joseph Smith, Jun.\" [185] Similar revelations seem to have been  necessary more than once. [186]    [Footnote 185: Doctrine and Covenants, 28:2.]    [Footnote 186: Doctrine and Covenants 43:8.]    Finally the pressure became too hard to bear, and a revelation was  procured in which God, in contradiction of his former declarations,  one of which is above quoted, appoints Sidney Rigdon \"to receive the  oracles for the whole church.\" [187] And not neglecting the equal rights  of the \"Prophet's\" brother, God declares: \"I appoint unto him (Hyrum  Smith) that he may be a prophet, and a seer, and a revelator unto my  church, as well as my servant Joseph.\" [188] Both men were accordingly  \"ordained\" each a \"prophet, seer, and revelator.\" [189] Thus are even  the Gods made to eat their own words at the behest of the conspirators,  who quarrel in their division of the glory and the gold.    [Footnote 187: Doctrine and Covenants 124:126.]    [Footnote 188: Doctrine and Covenants 124:94. 18 _Millennial Star_,  360.]    [Footnote 189: 20 _Millenial Star_, 550 as to Rigdon, and p. 373 as to  Hyrum Smith. It is now claimed that Smith had conferred upon all the  Apostles \"all the Power, Priesthood, and Authority ever conferred upon,  himself.\" 1 _Journal of Discourses_, 206. 19 _Journal of Discourses,_  124. See also _Melchizedek and Aaronic Herald,_ February, 1850. 5  _Millennial Star,_ 104, 68 Semi-Annual Conference, 70.]    One more incident of this sort will suffice. In February, 1831, Smith  received the first of several revelations directing the brethren to  provide him a home. In part it reads as follows:        \"It is mete that my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., should have a house      built in which to live and translate. And again, it is mete that my      servant Sidney Rigdon shall live as seemeth him good, inasmuch as      he keepeth my commandments.\" [190]    [Footnote 190: Doctrine and Covenants, 41, 7 and 8.]    Of course, living \"as seemeth him good\" was to Sidney Rigdon hardly a  fair equivalent for a house and lot. Had he not made Smith a \"prophet,  seer, and revelator,\" and could he not also unmake him? Why, then,  should Sidney Rigdon submit to any unfair division of the spoils of the  prophetic office? He didn't.    The above revelation was received while Rigdon was absent from  Kirtland. Upon his return he went to the meeting house where an  expectant throng awaited him in anticipation of one of his entrancing  sermons, but Rigdon failed to go to the speaker's stand, and instead  paced back and forth through the house. The \"Prophet Joseph\" being  absent from Kirtland, Father Smith requested Rigdon to speak. In a  tone of excitement Rigdon replied (and who will say it was not spoken  as by one having authority?): \"The keys of the Kingdom are rent from  the church, and there shall be no prayer put up in this house this  day.\" \"Oh, no; I hope not,\" gasped Father Smith. \"I tell you they are,\"  rejoined \"Elder Rigdon.\" The brethren stared and turned pale, and the  sisters in anguish cried aloud for relief. \"I tell you again,\" said  Sidney, with much feeling, \"the keys of the Kingdom are taken from you,  and you never will have them again _until you build me a new house_.\"    Amid tumultuous excitement on the part of the sisters, \"Brother  Hyrum\" left the meeting to bring \"Joseph the Prophet,\" who was in a  neighboring settlement. On their return next day the \"brethren\" and  \"sisters\" were gathered in anticipation of important happenings. Joseph  mounted the rostrum and informed the assembly that they were laboring  under a great mistake; that the church had not transgressed. Speaking  of the lost keys, he said: \"I myself hold the keys of this last  dispensation, and will forever hold them, both in time and in eternity;  so set your hearts at rest upon that point; all is right.\"    I continue to quote from an account written by the \"Prophet's\"  mother, relating just what they desire the world to believe happened  immediately after:    \"He (Joseph Smith) then went on and preached a comforting discourse,  after which he appointed a council to sit the next day, by which Sidney  Rigdon was tried for _having lied in the name of the Lord._ In this  council Joseph told him he must suffer for what he had done; that he  would be delivered over to the buffetings of Satan, who would handle  him as one man handleth another; that the less priesthood he had the  better it would be for him, and that it would be well for him to give  up his license. This counsel Sidney complied with, yet he had to suffer  for his folly, for, according to his own"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/529"],[0,"Knights of Art: Stories of the Italian Painters (#16)"],[1,"he dared enter without leave, and then ask him to be gone,  but as he looked at the fair face he felt the charm of the curious  smile, and the light in the blue eyes, and instead he laid his hand  upon the boy's golden head and said: 'What dost thou seek, my son?'    'I would learn all that thou canst teach me,' said Leonardo, for it was  he.    The old man smiled.    'Behold the boundless self-confidence of youth!' he said.    But as they talked together, and the boy asked his many eager  questions, a great wonder awoke in the astronomer's mind, and his eyes  shone with interest. This child-mind held depths of understanding such  as he had never met with among his learned friends. Day after day the  old man and the boy bent eagerly together over their problems, and when  night fell Toscanelli would take the child up with him to his lonely  tower above Florence, and teach him to know the stars and to understand  many things.    'This is all very well,' said Ser Piero, 'but the boy must do more than  mere star-gazing. He must earn a living for himself, and methinks we  might make a painter of him.'    That very day, therefore, he gathered together some of Leonardo's  drawings which lay carelessly scattered about, and took them to the  studio of Verocchio the painter, who lived close by the Ponte Vecchio.    'Dost thou think thou canst make aught of the boy?' he asked, spreading  out the drawings before Verocchio.    The painter's quick eyes examined the work with deep interest.    'Send him to me at once,' he said. 'This is indeed marvellous talent.'    So Leonardo entered the studio as a pupil, and learned all that could  be taught him with the same quickness with which he learned anything  that he cared to know.    Every one who saw his work declared that he would be the wonder of the  age, but Verocchio shook his head.    'He is too wonderful,' he said. 'He aims at too great perfection. He  wants to know everything and do everything, and life is too short for  that. He finishes nothing, because he is ever starting to do something  else.'    Verocchio's words were true; the boy seldom worked long at one thing.  His hands were never idle, and often, instead of painting, he would  carve out tiny windmills and curious toys which worked with pulleys and  ropes, or made exquisite little clay models of horses and all the other  animals that he loved. But he never forgot the longing that had filled  his heart when he was a child--the desire to learn the secret of flying.    For days he would sit idle and think of nothing but soaring wings, then  he would rouse himself and begin to make some strange machine which he  thought might hold the secret that he sought.    'A waste of time,' growled Verocchio. 'See here, thou wouldst be better  employed if thou shouldst set to work and help me finish this picture  of the Baptism for the good monks of Vallambrosa. Let me see how thou  canst paint in the kneeling figure of the angel at the side.'    For a while the boy stood motionless before the picture as if he was  looking at something far away. Then he seized the brushes with his left  hand and began to paint with quick certain sweep. He never stopped to  think, but worked as if the angel were already there, and he were but  brushing away the veil that hid it from the light.    Then, when it was done, the master came and looked silently on. For a  moment a quick stab of jealousy ran through his heart. Year after year  had he worked and striven to reach his ideal. Long days of toil and  weary nights had he spent, winning each step upwards by sheer hard  work. And here was this boy without an effort able to rise far above  him. All the knowledge which the master had groped after, had been  grasped at once by the wonderful mind of the pupil. But the envious  feeling passed quickly away, and Verocchio laid his hand upon  Leonardo's shoulder.    'I have found my master,' he said quietly, 'and I will paint no more.'    Leonardo scarcely seemed to hear; he was thinking of something else  now, and he seldom noticed if people praised or blamed him. His  thoughts had fixed themselves upon something he had seen that morning  which had troubled him. On the way to the studio he had passed a tiny  shop in a narrow street where a seller of birds was busy hanging his  cages up on the nails fastened to the outside wall.    The thought of those poor little prisoners beating their wings against  the cruel bars and breaking their hearts with longing for their wild  free life, had haunted him all day, and now he could bear it no longer.  He seized his cap and hurried off, all forgetful of his kneeling angel  and the master's praise.    He reached the little shop and called to the man within.    'How much wilt thou take for thy birds?' he cried, and pointed to the  little wooden cages that hung against the wall.    'Plague on them,' answered the man, 'they will often die before I can  make a sale by them. Thou canst have them all for one silver piece.'    In a moment Leonardo had paid the money and had turned towards the row  of little cages. One by one he opened the doors and set the prisoners  free, and those that were too frightened or timid to fly away, he  gently drew out with his hand, and sent them gaily whirling up above  his head into the blue sky.    The man looked with blank astonishment at the empty cages, and wondered  if the handsome young man was mad. But Leonardo paid no heed to him,  but stood gazing up until every one of the birds had disappeared.    'Happy things,' he said, with a sigh. 'Will you ever teach me the  secret of your wings, I wonder?'    It was with great pleasure that Ser Piero heard of his son's success at  Verocchio's studio, and he began to have hopes that the boy would make  a name for himself after all. It happened just then that he was on a  visit to his castle at Vinci, and one morning a peasant who lived on  the estate came to ask a great favour of him.    He had bought a rough wooden shield which he was very anxious should  have a design painted on it in Florence, and he begged Ser Piero to see  that it was done. The peasant was a faithful servant, and very useful  in supplying the castle with fish and game, so Ser Piero was pleased to  grant him his request.    'Leonardo shall try his hand upon it. It is time he became useful to  me,' said Ser Piero to himself. So on his return to Florence he took  the shield to his son.    It was a rough, badly-shaped shield, so Leonardo held it to the fire  and began to straighten it. For though his hands looked delicate and  beautifully formed, they were as strong as steel, and he could bend  bars of iron without an effort. Then he sent the shield to a turner to  be smoothed and rounded, and when it was ready he sat down to think  what he should paint upon it, for he loved to draw strange monsters.    'I will make it as terrifying as the head of Medusa,' he said at last,  highly delighted with the plan that had come into his head.    Then he went out and collected together all the strangest animals he  could find--lizards, hedgehogs, newts, snakes, dragon-flies, locusts,  bats, and glow-worms. These he took into his own room, which no one was  allowed to enter, and began to paint from them a curious monster,  partly a lizard and partly a bat, with something of each of the other  animals added to it.    When it was ready Leonardo hung the shield in a good light against a  dark curtain, so that the painted monster stood out in brilliant  contrast, and looked as if its twisted curling limbs were full of life.    A knock sounded at the door, and Ser Piero's voice was heard outside  asking if the shield was finished.    'Come in,' cried Leonardo, and Ser Piero entered.    He cast one look at the monster hanging there and then uttered a cry  and turned to flee, but Leonardo caught hold of his cloak and  laughingly told him to look closer.    'If I have really succeeded in frightening thee,' he said, 'I have  indeed done all I could desire.'    His father could scarcely believe that it was nothing but a painting,  and he was so proud of the work that he would not part with it, but  gave the peasant of Vinci another shield instead.    Leonardo then began a drawing for a curtain which was to be woven in  silk and gold and given as a present from the Florentines to the King  of Portugal, and he also began a large picture of the Adoration of the  Shepherds which was never finished.    The young painter grew restless after a while, and felt the life of the  studio narrow and cramped. He longed to leave Florence and find work in  some new place.    He was not a favourite at the court of Lorenzo the Magnificent as  Filippino Lippi and Botticelli were. Lorenzo liked those who would  flatter him and do as they were bid, while Leonardo took his own way in  everything and never said what he did not mean.    But it happened that just then Lorenzo wished to send a present to  Ludovico Sforza, the Duke of Milan, and the gift he chose was a  marvellous musical instrument which Leonardo had just finished.    It was a silver lute, made in the form of a horse's head, the most  curious and beautiful thing ever seen. Lorenzo was charmed with it.    'Thou shalt take it thyself, as my messenger,' he said to Leonardo. 'I  doubt if another can be found who can play upon it as thou dost.'    So Leonardo set out for Milan, and was glad to shake himself free from  the narrow life of the Florentine studio.    Before starting, however, he had written a letter to the Duke setting  down in simple order all the things he could do, and telling of what  use he could be in times of war and in days of peace.    There seemed nothing that he could not do. He could make bridges, blow  up castles, dig canals, invent a new kind of cannon, build warships,  and make underground passages. In days of peace he could design and  build houses, make beautiful statues and paint pictures 'as well as any  man, be he"]]]
