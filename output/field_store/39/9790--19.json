Alexandre opened a little cupboard, and took  out a letter which she handed to him.    \"Here, take it,\" she said, \"and be satisfied.\"    Considering that she used to be a chambermaid, Palmyre Chocareille,  since become Mme. Gypsy, wrote a good letter.    It bore the following address, written in a free, flowing hand:      FOR M. L. DE CLAMERAN,    Forge-Master, Hotel du Louvre.    To be handed to M. Raoul de Lagors.    (In great haste.)      \"Oh, ho!\" said Fanferlot, accompanying his exclamation with a little  whistle, as was his habit when he thought he had made a grand discovery.  \"Oh, ho!\"    \"Do you intend to open it?\" questioned Mme. Alexandre.    \"A little bit,\" said Fanferlot, as he dexterously opened the envelope.    Mme. Alexandre leaned over her husband's shoulder, and they both read  the following letter:      \"MONSIEUR RAOUL--Prosper is in prison, accused of a robbery which he  never committed. I wrote to you three days ago.\"      \"What!\" interrupted Fanferlot, \"this silly girl wrote, and I never saw  the letter?\"    \"But, little man, she must have posted it herself, the day she went to  the Palais de Justice.\"    \"Very likely,\" said Fanferlot propitiated. He continued reading:      \"I wrote to you three days ago, and have no reply. Who will help Prosper  if his best friends desert him? If you don't answer this letter, I shall  consider myself released from a certain promise, and without scruple  will tell Prosper of the conversation I overheard between you and M. de  Clameran. But I can count on you, can I not? I shall expect you at the  Archangel day after to-morrow, between twelve and four.    \"NINA GYPSY\"      The letter read, Fanferlot at once proceeded to copy it.    \"Well!\" said Mme. Alexandre, \"what do you think?\"    Fanferlot was delicately resealing the letter when the door of the hotel  office was abruptly opened, and the boy twice whispered, \"Pst! Pst!\"    Fanferlot rapidly disappeared into a dark closet. He had barely time to  close the door before Mme. Gypsy entered the room.    The poor girl was sadly changed. She was pale and hollow-cheeked, and  her eyes were red with weeping.    On seeing her, Mme. Alexandre could not conceal her surprise.    \"Why, my child, you are not going out?\"    \"I am obliged to do so, madame; and I come to ask you to tell anyone  that may call during my absence to wait until I return.\"    \"But where in the world are you going at this hour, sick as you are?\"    For a moment Mme. Gypsy hesitated.    \"Oh,\" she said, \"you are so kind that I am tempted to confide in you;  read this note which a messenger just now brought to me.\"    \"What!\" cried Mme. Alexandre perfectly aghast: \"a messenger enter my  house, and go up to your room!\"    \"Is there anything surprising in that?\"    \"Oh, oh, no! nothing surprising.\"    And in a tone loud enough to be heard in the closet she read the note:      \"A friend of Prosper who can neither receive you, nor present himself  at your house, is very anxious to speak to you. Be in the stage-office  opposite the Saint Jacques tower, to-night at nine precisely, and the  writer will approach, and tell you what he has to say.    \"I have appointed this public place for the rendezvous so as to relieve  your mind of all fear.\"      \"And you are going to this rendezvous?\"    \"Certainly, madame.\"    \"But it is imprudent, foolish; it is a snare to entrap you.\"    \"It makes no difference,\" interrupted Gypsy. \"I am so unfortunate  already that I have nothing more to dread. Any change would be a  relief.\"    And, without waiting to hear any more, she went out. The door had  scarcely closed upon Mme. Gypsy, before Fanferlot bounced out of the  closet.    The mild detective was white with rage, and swore violently.    \"What is the meaning of this?\" he cried. \"Am I to stand by and have  people walking over the Archangel, as if it were a public street?\"    Mme. Alexandre stood trembling, and dared not speak.    \"Was ever such impudence heard of before!\" he continued. \"A messenger  comes into my house, and goes upstairs without being seen by anybody!  I will look into this. And the idea of you, Mme. Alexandre, you, a  sensible woman, being idiotic enough to persuade that little viper not  to keep the appointment!\"    \"But, my dear--\"    \"Had you not sense enough to know that I would follow her, and discover  what she is attempting to conceal? Come, make haste, and help me, so  that she won't recognize me.\"    In a few minutes Fanferlot was completely disguised by a thick beard, a  wig, and one of those long linen blouses worn by dishonest workmen, who  go about seeking labor, and, at the same time, hoping they may not find  any.    \"Have you your handcuffs?\" asked the solicitous Mme. Alexandre.    \"Yes, yes: make haste and put that letter to M. de Clameran in the  post-office, and--and keep good watch.\"    And without waiting for his wife's reply, who cried out, \"Good luck!\"  Fanferlot darted into the street.    Mme. Gypsy had ten minutes' start of him; but he ran up the street he  knew she must have taken, and overtook her near the Change Bridge.    She was walking with the uncertain gait of a person who, impatient to  be at a rendezvous, has started too soon, and is obliged to occupy  the intervening time; she would walk very rapidly, then retrace her  footsteps, and proceed slowly.    On Chatelet Place she strolled up and down several times, read the  theatre-bills, and finally took a seat on a bench. One minute before a  quarter of nine, she entered the stage-office, and sat down.    A moment after, Fanferlot entered; but, as he feared that Mme. Gypsy  might recognize him in spite of his heavy beard, he took a seat at the  opposite end of the room, in a dark corner.    \"Singular place for a conversation,\" he thought, as he watched the  young woman. \"Who in the world could have made this appointment in a  stage-office? Judging from her evident curiosity and uneasiness, I could  swear she has not the faintest idea for whom she is waiting.\"    Meanwhile, the office was gradually filling with people. Every minute  a man would shriek out the destination of an omnibus which had just  arrived, and the bewildered passengers would rush in to get tickets, and  inquire when the omnibus would leave.    As each new-comer entered, Gypsy would tremble, and Fanferlot would say,  \"This is he!\"    Finally, as the Hotel-de-Ville clock was striking nine, a man entered,  and, without going to the ticket-window, walked directly up to Gypsy,  bowed, and took a seat beside her.    He was a medium-sized man, rather stout, with a crimson face, and  fiery-red whiskers. His dress was that of a well-to-do merchant, and  there was nothing in his manner or appearance to excite attention.    Fanferlot watched him eagerly.    \"Well, my friend,\" he said to himself, \"in future I shall recognize you,  no matter where we meet; and this very evening I will find out who you  are.\"    Despite his intent listening, he could not hear a word spoken by the  stranger or Gypsy. All he could do was to judge by their pantomime and  countenances, what the subject of their conversation might be.    When the stout man bowed and spoke to her, the girl looked so surprised  that it was evident she had never seen him before. When he sat down by  her, and said a few words, she jumped up with a frightened look, as  if seeking to escape. A single word and look made her resume her seat.  Then, as the stout man went on talking, Gypsy's attitude betrayed great  apprehension. She positively refused to do something; then suddenly she  seemed to consent, when he stated a good reason for her so doing. At  one moment she appeared ready to weep, and the next her pretty face was  illumined by a bright smile. Finally, she shook hands with him, as if  she was confirming a promise.    \"What can all that mean?\" said Fanferlot to himself, as he sat in his  dark corner, biting his nails. \"What an idiot I am to have stationed  myself so far off!\"    He was thinking how he could manage to approach nearer without arousing  their suspicions, when the fat man arose, offered his arm to Mme. Gypsy,  who accepted it without hesitation, and together they walked toward the  door.    They were so engrossed with each other, that Fanferlot thought he could,  without risk, follow them; and it was well he did; for the crowd was  dense outside, and he would soon have lost them.    Reaching the door, he saw the stout man and Gypsy cross the pavement,  approach a hackney-coach, and enter it.    \"Very good,\" muttered Fanferlot, \"I've got them now. There is no use of  hurrying any more.\"    While the coachman was gathering up his reins, Fanferlot prepared  his legs; and, when the coach started, he followed in a brisk trot,  determined upon following it to the end of the earth.    The cab went up the Boulevard Sebastopol. It went pretty fast; but it  was not for nothing that Fanferlot had won the name of \"Squirrel.\" With  his elbows glued to his sides, and holding his breath, he ran on.    By the time he had reached the Boulevard St. Denis, he began to get  breathless, and stiff from a pain in his side. The cabman abruptly  turned into the Rue Faubourg St. Martin.    But Fanferlot, who, at eight years of age, had been familiar with every  street in Paris, was not to be baffled: he was a man of resources. He  seized the springs of the coach, raised himself up by the strength of  his wrists, and hung on behind, with his legs resting on the axle-tree  of the back wheels. He was not quite comfortable, but then, he no longer  ran the risk of being distanced.    \"Now,\" he chuckled, behind his false beard, \"you may drive as fast as  you please, M. Cabby.\"    The man whipped up his horses, and drove furiously along the hilly  street of the Faubourg St. Martin.    Finally the cab stopped in front of a wine-store, and the driver jumped  down from his seat,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38032"],[0,"Game Birds and Game Fishes of the Pacific Coast (#16)"],[1," to the higher ground as the foaming crest of the  next breaker rushes up the sandy shingle. Or, as is the case of the  phalaropes and some others, they may be seen riding lightly upon the  restless billows far out at sea. Modest in coloring and plain in  plumage, the shore birds seem to belong to the plebeians of the  avafauna, for they are constant workers, always busy, always plying  their slender legs rapidly as they hurry from one spot to another,  never idle, never resting for a moment.    Of the shore birds there are six families and twenty genera  represented on the Coast. Most of them are quite abundant from  Washington to Mexico on their respective feeding grounds.        [Illustration:         WILSON SNIPE, OR JACK-SNIPE     DOWITCHER         (Gallinago delicata)            (Macrorhamphus scolopaceus)]      THE WILSON, OR JACK SNIPE    (Gallinago delicata)    Of all the shore birds the jack snipe, English snipe or Wilson snipe  as it is variously called, is the most highly prized as a table  delicacy and furnishes the best sport with the dog and gun. Usually  lying well for the dog, erratic in its flight and quick on the wing,  the Wilson snipe is one of the most difficult birds to bring to bag.  It is not only erratic in its flight, but it is erratic in its nature  as well. One day it will be found on a given feeding ground in  abundance and on the next not one is to be seen, while possibly the  day following they are there again in great numbers. To this  uncertainty and the corkscrew flight, peculiar to it alone, is due  much of the charm that jack snipe shooting affords. While these birds  are commonly called jack snipe or English snipe, their proper name is  Wilson snipe, but like the rose, no matter what the name, they are  just as gamy and just as delicious. The Wilson snipe migrates here to  but little extent, and these migrations are altitudinal rather than  latitudinal. They breed commonly in all the mountain valleys and even  as low down as on the Sacramento marshes south of the city of the same  name. I found a pair breeding a few years ago in the low hills of San  Luis Obispo county not half a mile from the ocean beach.    =Color=--Head, black, with a central stripe of brown; back, a mixture  of dark brown, pale brown, yellow and dull white; greater  wing-coverts, dark brown, tipped with white; throat, dull white,  barred with brown; a dark stripe running from the base of the bill  across the eye to the occiput; under parts of the wings, dull white,  barred with black; tail feathers, dark brown, tipped with white, and  with a sub-terminal bar of black. No web between the toes.    =Nest and Eggs=--The nest is a very crude affair made on the ground  and with but little lining of any kind. It contains from three to four  grayish eggs, blotched with brown.    =Measurements=--Total length, 11 inches; wing, 5-1/2; bill, 3 inches.      THE DOWITCHER, OR RED-BREASTED SNIPE    (Macrorhampus scolopaceus)    Though not of the same genus, the closet relative to the Wilson snipe  is the dowitcher or red-breasted snipe. By many who are not accustomed  to the Wilson snipe and its many vagaries, the red-breasted snipe is  often mistaken for the former. The red-breasted snipe may easily be  distinguished by the small web between the outer and middle toes. This  species of the dowitcher is a western bird, breeding well to the north  and migrating south to Mexico.    =Color=--Head and back, more of a gray than the Wilson snipe, with the  feathers edged with a pale buff; light gray stripe running from the  base of the bill over the eye to the occiput; chin, dull white;  breast, gray, with a tinge of cinnamon red; tail, banded with dark  brown; a small web between the outer and middle toes, extending about  one-fourth down the outer toe.    =Eggs and Nest=--Nest made on the ground and containing from three to  four dull white eggs.    =Measurements=--Total length, 10-1/2 inches; wing, 5-3/4; bill, about 2-1/2  inches, and with a considerable swelling at the end.        [Illustration: GREATER YELLOW-LEGS (Totanus melanoleucus)]      THE GREATER YELLOW-LEGS    (Totanus melanoleucus)    The greater yellow-legs migrates throughout the entire region, being  common on the beaches of Washington, Oregon and California during the  fall and early winter as it works its way to Lower California and  Mexico. It somewhat resembles the godwit in coloring, but it is more  of a grayish tinge. Its shorter bill--not over two and a half inches  in length--will always distinguish it from the godwit. So, also, will  its sharp whistling note. It is nearly as delicate a table bird as the  Wilson snipe.    =Color=--Top of head and neck, brown, with whitish streaks; back,  brown, with the feathers edged with white; chin, white; breast, white,  lined with narrow streaks of brown; bill, black, and legs, yellow.    =Nest and Eggs=--The nests are built close to the water's edge,  containing four light buff eggs, spotted with brown.    =Measurements=--Total length, 14 inches; wing, 7-3/4; bill, 2-1/4, to  2-1/2 inches.        [Illustration: MARLIN OR GODWIT (Limosa fedoa)]      THE MARLIN, OR MARBLED GODWIT    (Limosa fedoa)    The marbled godwit, or marlin as it is also called, is one of the  largest birds of the =Scolopacidae= family. It ranges from Alaska to  Central America. This species is seen in large numbers in the early  fall along the sea beaches of California as they are working their way  south. They spend the winter in great quantities in Lower California  and Mexico. There should be no difficulty in distinguishing the godwit  from any of the other shore birds, its long upward curved bill and  brownish-barred back being features by which it may always be known.    =Color=--Top of head and back of neck, brown, streaked with paler  brown; feathers of the back, brown, with ochreous edges; throat and  forehead, pale buff, with faint markings of brown; bill slightly  turned upward.    =Nest and Eggs=--Nest a crude affair on the ground, containing four  eggs of an ash color, mottled with a dead brown.    =Measurements=--Total length, 19 inches; wing, 8-3/4; bill, about 4  inches.      THE RED-BACKED SANDPIPER    (Tringa alpina pacifica)    The red-backed sandpiper, or American dunlin, is one of the larger  members of the genus and quite plentiful on the Coast marshes, but it  is seldom seen in the interior valleys except during its migrations.  In its winter plumage, in which our sportsmen see it, it is of a dull  light gray color. A diagnostic feature of this species is the slightly  downward curved bill.    =Color=--Head and upper parts, light gray, with a white stripe over  the eye; shafts of the feathers are dark brown, producing a streaky  appearance. In its summer plumage the head and back are reddish brown,  wings brownish and abdomen black.    =Nest and Eggs=--Nests on the ground without lining. Eggs, bluish  white, with brown spots.    =Measurements=--Total length, about 8-1/2 inches; wing, 4-3/4; bill, 1 5/8.      THE WILLET    (Symphemia Semipalmata inornata)    The willet, or stone curlew as it is sometimes called, is a resident  species, breeding from Washington to Mexico. It is a western bird,  ranging eastward to the Mississippi valley, where it is but a  straggler. In size it is nearly as large as the marlin. Its black  wings, with broad, white patches, and feet webbed for about half the  length of the toes, are distinguishing features, easily recognized. It  is generally found on the salt marshes.    =Color=--The general color of the plumage is ashy white or light gray,  usually with some light buff markings on the breast. When flying it  shows a broad, white patch on the wings, caused by the upper part of  the primaries and part of the secondaries being white. Its smoky black  axillars will always distinguish it.    =Nest and Eggs=--The nest is any place on the ground where it can  deposit three or four pale buff eggs, spotted with dark brown.    =Measurements=--Total length, 15-1/2 inches; wing, 8-1/2; bill, 2-1/2  to 2-3/4 inches.
