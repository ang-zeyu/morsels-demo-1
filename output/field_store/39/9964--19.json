There was a moment's pause, and then she asked in a timid hesitating  way, \"Papa, may I have my candy, if you please?\"    \"No, you may not,\" he said decidedly; \"and understand and remember that  I positively forbid you either to buy or eat anything of the kind again  without my express permission.\"    Elsie's eyes filled, and she had a hard struggle to keep down a rising  sob as she turned away and went slowly back to the place where she had  left her friend.    \"Have you got it?\" asked Lucy, eagerly.    Elsie shook her head.    \"What a shame!\" exclaimed Lucy, indignantly. \"He's just as cross as he  can be. He's a tyrant, so he is! just a hateful old tyrant, and I  wouldn't care a cent for him, if I were you, Elsie. I'm glad he is not  my father, so I am.\"    \"I'm afraid he doesn't love me much,\" sighed Elsie in low, tearful  tones, \"for he hardly ever lets me have anything, or go anywhere that I  want to.\"    \"Well, never mind, _I'll_ send and buy a good lot tomorrow, and we'll  have a regular feast,\" said Lucy, soothingly, as she passed her arm  around her friend's waist and drew her down to a seat on the portico  step.    \"Thank you, Lucy; you can buy for yourself if you like, but not for me,  for papa has forbidden me to eat anything of the sort.\"    \"Oh! of course we'll not let him know anything about it,\" said Lucy.    But Elsie shook her head sadly, saying with a little sigh, \"No, Lucy,  you are very kind, but I cannot disobey papa, even if he should never  know it, because that would be disobeying God, and He would know it.\"    \"Dear me, how particular you are!\" exclaimed Lucy a little pettishly.    \"Elsie,\" said Mr. Dinsmore, speaking from the door, \"what are you doing  there? Did I not forbid you to be out in the evening air?\"    \"I did not know you meant the doorstep, papa. I thought I was only not  to go down into the garden,\" replied the little girl, rising to go in.    \"I see you intend to make as near an approach to disobedience as you  dare,\" said her father. \"Go immediately to your room, and tell mammy to  put you to bed.\"    Elsie silently obeyed, and Lucy, casting an indignant glance at Mr.  Dinsmore, was about to follow her, when he said, \"I wish her to go  alone, if you please, Miss Lucy;\" and with a frown and a pout the  little girl walked into the drawing-room and seated herself on the sofa  beside her mamma.    Mr. Dinsmore walked out on to the portico, and stood there watching the  moon which was just rising over the treetops.    \"Horace,\" said Arthur, emerging from the shadow of a tree near by and  approaching his brother, \"Elsie thinks you're a tyrant. She says you  never let her have anything, or go anywhere, and you're always  punishing her. She and Lucy have had a fine time out here talking over  your bad treatment of her, and planning to have some candy in spite of  you.\"    \"Arthur, I do not believe that Elsie would deliberately plan to disobey  me; and whatever faults she may have, I am very sure she is above the  meanness of telling tales,\" replied Mr. Dinsmore, in a tone of  severity, as he turned and went into the house, while Arthur, looking  sadly crestfallen, crept away out of sight.    When Elsie reached her room, she found that Chloe was not there; for,  not expecting that her services would be required at so early an hour,  she had gone down to the kitchen to have a little chat with her  fellow-servants. Elsie rang for her, and then walking to the window,  stood looking down into the garden in an attitude of thoughtfulness and  dejection. She was mentally taking a review of the manner in which she  had spent the day, as was her custom before retiring. The retrospect  had seldom been so painful to the little girl. She had a very tender  conscience, and it told her now that she had more than once during the  day indulged in wrong feelings toward her father; that she had also  allowed another to speak disrespectfully of him, giving by her silence  a tacit approval of the sentiments uttered, and, more than that, had  spoken complainingly of him herself.    \"Oh!\" she murmured half aloud as she covered her face with her hands,  and the tears trickled through her fingers, \"how soon I have forgotten  the lesson papa taught me this morning, and my promise to trust him  without knowing his reasons. I don't deserve that he should love me or  be kind and indulgent, when I am so rebellious.\"    \"What's de matter, darlin'?\" asked Chloe's voice in pitiful tones, as  she took her nursling in her arms and laid her little head against her  bosom, passing her hand caressingly over the soft bright curls; \"your  ole mammy can't bear to see her pet cryin' like dat.\"    \"O mammy, mammy! I've been such a wicked girl to-day! Oh! I'm afraid I  shall never be good, never be like Jesus. I'm afraid He is angry with  me, for I have disobeyed Him to-day,\" sobbed the child.    \"Darlin',\" said Chloe, earnestly, \"didn't you read to your ole mammy  dis very morning dese bressed words: 'If any man sin, we have an  advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous,' an' de other:  'If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our  sins.' Go to de dear, bressed Lord Jesus, darlin', an' ax Him to  forgive you, an' I _knows_ He will.\"    \"Yes, He will,\" replied the little girl, raising her head and dashing  away her tears, \"He will forgive my sins, and take away my wicked  heart, and give me right thoughts and feelings. How glad I am you  remembered those sweet texts, you dear old mammy,\" she added, twining  her arms lovingly around her nurse's neck. And then she delivered her  papa's message, and Chloe began at once to prepare her for bed.    Elsie's tears had ceased to flow, but they were still trembling in her  eyes, and the little face wore a very sad and troubled expression as  she stood patiently passive in her nurse's hands. Chloe had soon  finished her labors, and then the little girl opened her Bible, and, as  usual, read a few verses aloud, though her voice trembled, and once or  twice a tear fell on the page; then closing the book she stole away to  the side of the bed and knelt down.    She was a good while on her knees, and several times, as the sound of a  low sob fell upon Chloe's ear, she sighed and murmured to herself:  \"Poor, darlin'! dear, bressed lamb, your ole mammy don't like to hear  dat.\"    Then as the child rose from her kneeling posture she went to her, and  taking her in her arms, folded her in a fond embrace, calling her by  the most tender and endearing epithets, and telling her that her old  mammy loved her better than life--better than anything in the wide  world.    Elsie flung her arms around her nurse's neck, and laid her head upon  her bosom, saying, \"Yes, my dear old mammy, I know you love me, and I  love you, too. But put me in bed now, or papa will be displeased.\"    \"What makes you so onrestless, darlin'?\" asked Chloe, half an hour  afterward; \"can't you go to sleep no how?\"    \"O mammy! if I could only see papa just for one moment to tell him  something. Do you think he would come to me?\" sighed the little girl.  \"Please, mammy, go down and see if he is busy. Don't say a word if he  is; but if not, ask him to come to me for just one minute.\"    Chloe left the room immediately, but returned the next moment, saying,  \"I jes looked into de parlor, darlin', an' Mass Horace he mighty busy  playin' chess wid Miss Lucy's mamma, an' I didn't say nuffin' to him.  Jes you go sleep, my pet, an' tell Mass Horace all 'bout it in de  mornin'.\"    Elsie sighed deeply, and turning over on her pillow, cried herself to  sleep.    Chloe was just putting the finishing touches to the little girl's dress  the next morning, when Lucy Carrington rapped at the door.    \"Good morning, Elsie,\" she said; \"I was in a hurry to come to you,  because it is my last day, you know. Wasn't it too bad of your father  to send you off to bed so early last night?\"    \"No, Lucy, papa has a right to send me to bed whenever he pleases; and  besides, I was naughty and deserved to be punished; and it was not much  more than half an hour earlier than my usual bedtime.\"    \"You naughty!\" exclaimed Lucy, opening her eyes very wide. \"Mamma often  says she wishes I was half as good.\"    Elsie sighed, but made no answer. Her thoughts seemed far away. She was  thinking of what she had been so anxious, the night before, to say to  her father, and trying to gain courage to do it this morning. \"If I  could only get close to him when nobody was by, and he would look and  speak kindly to me, I could do it then,\" she murmured to herself.    \"Come, Aunt Chloe, aren't you done? I want to have a run in the garden  before breakfast,\" said Lucy, somewhat impatiently, as Chloe tied and  untied Elsie's sash several times.    \"Well, Miss Lucy, I'se done now,\" she answered, passing her hand once  more over her nursling's curls: \"but Mass Horace he mighty pertickler  'bout Miss Elsie.\"    \"Yes,\" said Elsie, \"papa wants me always to look very nice and neat;  and when I go down in the morning he just gives me one glance from head  to foot, and if anything is wrong he is sure to see it and send me back  immediately to have it made right. Now, mammy, please give me my hat  and let us go.\"    \"You's got plenty ob time, chillens; de bell won't go for to ring dis  hour,\" remarked the old nurse, tying on Elsie's hat.    \"My chile looks sweet an' fresh as a moss rosebud dis mornin',\" she  added, talking to herself, as she watched the two little girls tripping  down-stairs hand in hand.    They skipped up and down the avenue several times, and ran all round  the garden before it was time to go in. Then Elsie went up to Chloe to  have her hair made smooth again. She was just descending for the second  time to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6462"],[0,"An Introduction to the mortuary customs of the North American Indians (#16)"],[1,"the ancient Ethiopians covered the corpses of their dead with  plaster (probably mud), but they did not burn these curious coffins.    Another method, embracing both burial and cremation, has been  practiced by the Pitt River or Achomawi Indians of California, who  \"bury the body in the ground in a standing position, the shoulders  nearly even with the ground. The grave is prepared by digging a hole  of sufficient depth and circumference to admit the body, the head  being cut off. In the grave are placed the bows and arrows, bead-work,  trappings, &c., belonging to the deceased; quantities of food,  consisting of dried fish, roots, herbs, &c., were placed with the body  also. The grave was then filled up, covering the headless body; then a  bundle of fagots was brought and placed on the grave by the different  members of the tribe, and on these fagots the head was placed, the  pile fired, and the head consumed to ashes; after this was done, the  female relatives of the deceased, who had appeared as mourners with  their faces blackened with a preparation resembling tar or paint,  dipped their fingers in the ashes of the cremated head and made three  marks on their right cheek. This constituted the mourning garb, the  period of which lasted until this black substance wore off from the  face. In addition to this mourning, the blood female relatives of the  deceased (who, by the way, appeared to be a man of distinction) had  their hair cropped short. I noticed while the head was burning that  the old women of the tribe sat on the ground, forming a large circle,  inside of which another circle of young girls were formed standing and  swaying their bodies to and fro and singing a mournful ditty. This was  the only burial of a male that I witnessed. The custom of burying  females is very different, their bodies being wrapped or bundled up in  skins and laid away in caves, with their valuables, and in some cases  food being placed with them in their mouths. Occasionally money is  left to pay for food in the spirit land.\"    This account is furnished by General Charles H. Tompkins, deputy  quartermaster-general, United States Army, who witnessed the burial  above related, and is the more interesting as it seems to be the only  well-authenticated case on record, although E. A. Barber [Footnote:  American Natural, Sept., 1878, p. 699.] has described what may  possibly have been a case of cremation like the one above noted:    \"A very singular case of aboriginal burial was brought to my notice  recently by Mr. William Klingbeil, of Philadelphia. On the New Jersey  bank of the Delaware River, a short distance below Gloucester City,  the skeleton of a man was found buried in a standing position, in a  high, red, sandy-clay bluff overlooking the stream. A few inches below  the surface the neck bones were found, and below these the remainder  of the skeleton, with the exception of the bones of the hands and  feet. The skull being wanting, it could not be determined whether the  remains were those of an Indian or of a white man, but in either case  the sepulture was peculiarly aboriginal. A careful exhumation and  critical examination by Mr. Klingbeil disclosed the fact that around  the lower extremities of the body had been placed a number of large  stones, which revealed traces of fire, in conjunction with charred  wood, and the bones of the feet had undoubtedly been consumed. This  fact makes it appear reasonably certain that the subject had been  executed, probably as a prisoner of war. A pit had been dug, in which  he was placed erect, and a fire kindled around him. Then he had been  buried alive, or, at least, if he did not survive the fiery ordeal,  his body was imbedded in the earth, with the exception of his head,  which was left protruding above the surface. As no trace of the  cranium could be found, it seems probable that the head had either  been burned or severed from the body and removed, or else left a prey  to ravenous birds. The skeleton, which would have measured fully six  feet in height, was undoubtedly that of a man.\"    Blacking the face, as is mentioned in the first account, is a custom  known to have existed among many tribes throughout the world, but in  some cases different earths and pigments are used as signs of  mourning. The natives of Guinea smear a chalky substance over their  bodies as an outward expression of grief, and it is well known that  the ancient Israelites threw ashes on their heads and garments.  Placing food with the corpse or in its mouth, and money in the hand,  finds its analogue in the custom of the ancient Romans, who, some time  before interment, placed a piece of money in the corpse's mouth, which  was thought to be Charon's fare for wafting the departed soul over the  Infernal River. Besides this, the corpse's mouth was furnished with a  certain cake, composed of flour, honey, &c. This was designed to  appease the fury of Cerberus, the infernal doorkeeper, and to procure  a safe and quiet entrance. These examples are curious coincidences, if  nothing more.        BURIAL ABOVE GROUND.      Our attention should next be turned to sepulture above the ground,  including lodge, house, box, scaffold, tree, and canoe burial, and the  first example which may be given is that of burial in lodges, which is  by no means common. The description which follows is by Stansbury,  [Footnote: Explorations of the Valley of the Great Salt Lake of Utah,  1852, p. 43.] and relates to the Sioux:    \"I put on my moccasins, and, displaying my wet shirt like a flag to  the wind, we proceeded to the lodges which had attracted our  curiosity. There were five of them pitched upon the open prairie, and  in them we found the bodies of nine Sioux laid out upon the ground,  wrapped in their robes of buffalo-skin, with their saddles, spears,  camp-kettles, and all their accoutrements piled up around them. Some  lodges contained three, others only one body, all of which were more  or less in a state of decomposition. A short distance apart from these  was one lodge which, though small, seemed of rather superior  pretensions, and was evidently pitched with great care. It contained  the body of a young Indian girl of sixteen or eighteen years, with a  countenance presenting quite an agreeable expression; she was richly  dressed in leggins of fine scarlet cloth elaborately ornamented; a new  pair of moccasins, beautifully embroidered with porcupine quills, was  on her feet, and her body was wrapped in two superb buffalo-robes  worked in like manner; she had evidently been dead but a day or two,  and to our surprise a portion of the upper part of her person was  bare, exposing the face and a part of the breast, as if the robes in  which she was wrapped had by some means been disarranged, whereas all  the other bodies were closely covered up. It was, at the time, the  opinion of our mountaineers that these Indians must have fallen in an  encounter with a party of Crows; but I subsequently learned that they  had all died of the cholera, and that this young girl, being  considered past recovery, had been arranged by her friends in the  habiliments of the dead, inclosed in the lodge alive, and abandoned to  her fate, so fearfully alarmed were the Indians by this to them novel  and terrible disease.\"    It might, perhaps, be said that this form of burial was exceptional,  and due to the dread of again using the lodges which had served as the  homes of those afflicted with the cholera, but it is thought such was  not the case, as the writer has notes of the same kind of burial among  the same tribe and of others, notably the Crows, the body of one of  their chiefs (Long Horse) being disposed of as follows.    \"The lodge poles inclose an oblong circle some 18 by 22 feet at the  base, converging to a point at least 30 feet high, covered with  buffalo-hides dressed without hair except a part of the tail switch,  which floats outside like, and mingled with human scalps. The  different skins are neatly fitted and sewed together with sinew, and  all painted in seven alternate horizontal stripes of brown and yellow,  decorated with various life-like war scenes. Over the small entrance  is a large bright cross, the upright being a large stuffed white wolf-  skin upon his war lance, and the cross-bar of bright scarlet flannel,  containing the quiver of bow and arrows, which nearly all warriors  still carry, even when armed with repeating rifles. As the cross is  not a pagan but a Christian (which Long Horse was not either by  profession or practice) emblem, it was probably placed there by the  influence of some of his white friends. I entered, finding Long Horse  buried Indian fashion, in full-war dress, paint and feathers, in a  rude coffin, upon a platform about breast high, decorated with  weapons, scalps, and ornaments. A large opening and wind-flap at top  favored ventilation, and though he had lain there in an open coffin a  full month, some of which was hot weather, there was but little  effluvia; in fact, I have seldom found much in a burial-teepee, and  when this mode of burial is thus performed it is less repulsive than  natural to suppose.\"    This account is furnished by Col. P. W. Norris, superintendent of  Yellowstone National Park, he having been an eye-witness of what he  relates in 1876.    The Blackfeet, Sioux, and Navajos also bury in lodges, and the Indians  of Bellingham Bay, according to Dr. J. F. Hammond, U. S. A., place  their dead in carved wooden sarcophagi, inclosing these with a  rectangular tent of some white material.    Bancroft [Footnote: Nat. Races of Pac. States, 1874, vol. 1, p. 780.]  states that certain of the Indians of Costa Rica, when a death  occurred, deposited the body in a small hut constructed of plaited  palm reeds. In this it is preserved for three years, food being  supplied, and on each anniversary of the death it is redressed and  attended to amid certain ceremonies. The"]]]
