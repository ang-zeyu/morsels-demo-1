My  chance--our chance--\"    He suddenly stopped his pacing and stood before me. \"Don't you feel the  lure of it? The open road? 'The road is straight before me and the Red  Gods call for me!' I'm going, Charlie. Going to-night--and I want you to  go with me! Will you?\"    Would I go? The thing leaped like a menacing shadow risen solidly to  confront me. Would I go?    Suddenly there was before me the face of a girl. White. Apprehensive. It  seemed almost pleading. A face beautiful, with a mouth of parted red  lips. A face framed in long, pale-golden hair with big staring blue  eyes. Wistful eyes, wan with starlight--eyes that seemed to plead.    I thought, \"Why, this is madness!\" I was not seeing this face with my  eyes. There was nothing, no one here in the room with me but Derek. I  knew it. The shadows about us were empty. I was conjuring the face only  from Derek's words, making real that which existed only in my  imagination.    Yet I knew that in another realm, with my thoughts now bridging the gap,  the girl was real. Would I go into the unknown?    The quest of the unknown. The gauntlet of the unknown flung down now  before me, as it was flung down before the ancient explorers who picked  up its challenge and mounted the swaying decks of their little galleons  and said, \"We'll go and see what lies off there in the unknown.\"    That same lure was on me now. I heard my voice saying, \"Why yes, I guess  I'll go, Derek.\"          CHAPTER III    _Into the Unknown_      We stood in the boarded room which was Derek's laboratory. Our  preparations had been simple: Derek had made them all in advance. There  was little left to do. The laboratory was a small room of board walls,  board ceiling and floor. Windowless, with a single door opening into the  cellar of the apartment house.    Derek had locked the door after us as we entered. He said, \"I have sent  my man servant away for a week. The people in the house here think I  have gone away on a vacation. No one will miss us, Charlie--not for a  time, anyway.\"    No one would miss me, save my employers, and to them I would no doubt be  small loss.    We had put out the light in Derek's apartment and locked it carefully  after us. This journey! I own that I was trembling, and frightened. Yet  a strange eagerness was on me.    The cellar room was comfortably furnished. Rugs were on its floor.  Whatever apparatus of a research laboratory had been here was removed  now. But the evidence of it remained--Derek's long search for this  secret which now he was about to use. A row of board shelves at one  side of the room showed where bottles and chemical apparatus had stood.  A box of electrical tools and odds and ends of wire still lay discarded  in a corner of the room. There was a tank of running water, and gas  connections, where no doubt bunsen burners had been.           *       *       *       *       *    Derek produced his apparatus. I sat on a small low couch against the  wall and watched him as he stripped himself of his clothes. Around his  waist he adjusted a wide, flat, wire-woven belt. A small box was  fastened to it in the middle of the back--a wide, flat thing of metal, a  quarter of an inch thick, and curved to fit his body. It was a storage  battery of the vibratory current he was using. From the battery, tiny  threads of wire ran up his back to a wire necklace flat against his  throat. Other wires extended down his arms to the wrists. Still others  down his legs to the ankles. A flat electrode was connected to the top  of his head like a helmet. I was reminded as he stood there, of medical  charts of the human body with the arterial system outlined. But when he  dressed again and put on his jaunty captain's uniform, only the  electrode clamped to his head and the thin wires dangling from it in the  back were visible to disclose that there was anything unusual about him.    He said smilingly, \"Don't stare at me like that.\"    I took a grip on myself. This thing was frightening, now that I actually  was embarked on it. Derek had explained to me briefly the workings of  his apparatus. A vibratory electronic current, for which as yet he had  no name, was stored in the small battery. He had said:    \"There's nothing incomprehensible about this, Charlie. It's merely a  changing of the vibration rate of the basic substance out of which our  bodies are made. Vibration is the governing factor of all states of  matter. In its essence what we call substance is wholly intangible. That  is already proven. A vortex! A whirlpool of nothingness! It creates a  pseudo-substance which is the only material in the universe. And from  this, by vibration, is built the complicated structure of things as we  see and feel them to be, all dependent upon vibration. Everything is  altered, directly as the vibratory rate is changed. From the most  tenuous gas, to fluids to solids--throughout all the different states of  matter the only fundamental difference is the rate of vibration.\"           *       *       *       *       *    I understood the basic principle of this that he was explaining--that  now when this electronic current which he had captured and controlled  was applied to our physical body, the vibration rate of every smallest  and most minute particle of our physical being was altered. There is so  little in the vast scale of natural phenomena of which our human senses  are cognisant! Our eyes see the colors of the spectrum, from red to  violet. But a vast invisible world of color lies below the red of the  rainbow! Physicists call it the infra-red. And beyond the violet,  another realm--the ultra-violet. With sound it is the same. Our audible  range of sound is very small. There are sounds with too slow a vibratory  rate for us to hear, and others too rapid. The differing vibratory rate  from most tenuous gas to most substantial solid is all that we can  perceive in this physical world of ours. Yet of the whole, it is so very  little! This other realm to which we were now going lay in the higher,  more rapid vibratory scale. To us, by comparison, a more tenuous world,  a shadow realm.    I listened to Derek's words, but my mind was on the practicality of what  lay ahead. An explorer, standing upon his ship, may watch his men  bending the sails, raising the anchor, but his mind flings out to the  journey's end....           *       *       *       *       *    We were soon ready. Derek wore his jaunty uniform, I wore my ordinary  business suit. A magnetic field would be about us, so that in the  transition anything in fairly close contact with our bodies was affected  by the current.    Derek said, \"I will go first, Charlie.\"    \"But, Derek--\" A fear, greater than the trembling I had felt before,  leaped at me. Left here alone, with no one on whom to depend!    He spoke with careful casualness, but his eyes were burning me. \"Just  sit there, and watch. When I am gone, turn on the current as I showed  you and come after me. I'll wait for you.\"    \"Where?\" I stammered.    He smiled faintly. \"Here. Right here. I'm not going away! Not going to  move. I'll be here on the couch waiting for you.\"    Terrifying words! He had lowered the couch, bending out its short legs  until the frame of it rested on the board floor. He drew a chair up  before it and seated me. He sat down on the couch.    He said, \"Oh, one other thing. Just before you start, put out the light.  We can't tell how long it will be before we return.\"    Terrifying words!    His right hand was on his left wrist where the tiny switch was placed.  He smiled again. \"Good luck to us, Charlie!\"    Good luck to us! The open road, the unknown!    I sat there staring. He was partly in shadow. The room was very silent.  Derek lay propped up on one elbow. His hand threw the tiny switch.    There was a breathless moment. Derek's face was set and white, but no  whiter than my own, I was sure. His eyes were fixed on me. I saw him  suddenly quiver and twitch a little.    I murmured, \"Derek--\"    At once he spoke, to reassure me. \"I'm all right, Charlie. That was just  the first feel of it.\"           *       *       *       *       *    There was a faint quivering throb in the room, like a tiny distant  dynamo throbbing. The current was surging over Derek; his legs  twitched.    A moment. The faint throbbing intensified. No louder, but rapid,  infinitely more rapid. A tiny throb, an aerial whine, faint as the  whirring wings of a humming bird. It went up the scale, ascending in  pitch, until presently it was screaming with an aerial microscopic  voice.    But there seemed no change in Derek. His uniform was glowing a trifle,  that was all. His face was composed now; he smiled, but did not speak.  His eyes roved away from me, as though now he were seeing things that I  could not see.    Another moment. No change.    Why, what was this? I blinked, gasped. There was a change! My gaze was  fastened upon Derek's white face. White? It was more than white now! A  silver sheen seemed to be coming to his skin!    I think no more than a minute had passed. His face was glowing,  shimmering. A transparent look was coming to it, a thinness, a sudden  unsubstantiality! He dropped his elbow and lay on the couch, stretched  at full length at my feet. His eyes were staring.    And suddenly I realized that the face that held those staring eyes was  erased! A shimmering apparition of Derek was stretched here before me. I  could see through it now! Beneath the shimmering, blurred outlines of  his body I could see the solid folds of the couch cover. A ghost of  Derek here. An apparition--fading--dissipating!    A gossamer outline of him, imponderable, intangible.    I leaped to my feet, staring down over him.    \"Derek!\"    The shape of him did not move. Every instant it was more vaporous, more  unreal.    I thought, \"He's gone!\"    No! He was still there. A white mist of his form on the couch.
