[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5225"],[0,"The Satyricon â€” Complete (#16)"],[1,"   But Ascyltos threw off all restraint and ridiculed everything; throwing  up his hands, he laughed until the tears ran down his cheeks.  At last,  one of Trimalchio's fellow-freedmen, the one who had the place next to  me, flew into a rage, \"What's the joke, sheep's-head,\" he bawled, \"Don't  our host's swell entertainment suit you?  You're richer than he is, I  suppose, and used to dining better!  As I hope the guardian spirit of  this house will be on my side, I'd have stopped his bleating long ago if  I'd been sitting next to him.  He's a peach, he is, laughing at others;  some vagabond or other from who-knows-where, some night-pad who's not  worth his own piss: just let me piss a ring around him and he wouldn't  know where to run to!  I ain't easy riled, no, by Hercules, I ain't, but  worms breed in tender flesh.  Look at him laugh!  What the hell's he got  to laugh at?  Is his family so damned fine-haired?  So you're a Roman  knight!  Well, I'm a king's son!  How's it come that you've been a slave,  you'll ask because I put myself into service because I'd rather be a  Roman citizen than a tax-paying provincial.  And now I hope that my life  will be such that no one can jeer at me.  I'm a man among men!  I take my  stroll bareheaded and owe no man a copper cent.  I never had a summons in  my life and no one ever said to me, in the forum, pay me what you owe me.  I've bought a few acres and saved up a few dollars and I feed twenty  bellies and a dog.  I ransomed my bedfellow so no one could wipe his  hands on her bosom; a thousand dinars it cost me, too.  I was chosen  priest of Augustus without paying the fee, and I hope that I won't need  to blush in my grave after I'm dead.  But you're so busy that you can't  look behind you; you can spot a louse on someone else, all right, but you  can't see the tick on yourself.  You're the only one that thinks we're so  funny; look at your professor, he's older than you are, and we're good  enough for him, but you're only a brat with the milk still in your nose  and all you can prattle is 'ma' or 'mu,' you're only a clay pot, a piece  of leather soaked in water, softer and slipperier, but none the better  for that.  You've got more coin than we have, have you?  Then eat two  breakfasts and two dinners a day.  I'd rather have my reputation than  riches, for my part, and before I make an end of this--who ever dunned me  twice?  In all the forty years I was in service, no one could tell  whether I was free or a slave.  I was only a long-haired boy when I came  to this colony and the town house was not built then.  I did my best to  please my master and he was a digniferous and majestical gentleman whose  nail-parings were worth more than your whole carcass.  I had enemies in  his house, too, who would have been glad to trip me up, but I swam the  flood, thanks to his kindness.  Those are the things that try your  mettle, for it's as easy to be born a gentleman as to say, 'Come here.'  Well, what are you gaping at now, like a billy-goat in a vetch-field?\"          CHAPTER THE FIFTY-EIGHTH.    Giton, who had been standing at my feet, and who had for some time been  holding in his laughter, burst into an uproarious guffaw, at this last  figure of speech, and when Ascyltos' adversary heard it, he turned his  abuse upon the boy.  \"What's so funny, you curly-headed onion,\" he  bellowed, \"are the Saturnalia here, I'd like to know?  Is it December  now?    \"When did you pay your twentieth?  What's this to you, you gallows-bird,  you crow's meat?  I'll call the anger of Jupiter down on you and that  master of yours, who don't keep you in better order.  If I didn't respect  my fellow-freedmen, I'd give you what is coming to you right here on the  spot, as I hope to get my belly full of bread, I would.  We'll get along  well enough, but those that can't control you are fools; like master like  man's a true saying.  I can hardly hold myself in and I'm not hot-headed  by nature, but once let me get a start and I don't care two cents for my  own mother.  All right, I'll catch you in the street, you rat, you  toadstool.  May I never grow an inch up or down if I don't push your  master into a dunghill, and I'll give you the same medicine, I will, by  Hercules, I will, no matter if you call down Olympian Jupiter himself!  I'll take care of your eight inch ringlets and your two cent master into  the bargain.  I'll have my teeth into you, either you'll cut out the  laughing, or I don't know myself.  Yes, even if you had a golden beard.  I'll bring the wrath of Minerva down on you and on the fellow that first  made a come-here out of you.  No, I never learned geometry or criticism  or other foolishness like that, but I know my capital letters and I can  divide any figure by a hundred, be it in asses, pounds or sesterces.  Let's have a show-down, you and I will make a little bet, here's my coin;  you'll soon find out that your father's money was wasted on your  education, even if you do know a little rhetoric.  How's this--what part  of us am I?  I come far, I come wide, now guess me!  I'll give you  another.  What part of us runs but never moves from its place?  What part  of us grows but always grows less?  But you scurry around and are as  flustered and fidgeted as a mouse in a piss-pot.  Shut up and don't annoy  your betters, who don't even know that you've been born.  Don't think  that I'm impressed by those boxwood armlets that you did your mistress  out of.  Occupo will back me!  Let's go into the forum and borrow money,  then you'll see whether this iron ring means credit!  Bah!  A draggled  fox is a fine sight, ain't it'?  I hope I never get rich and die decently  so that the people will swear by my death, if I don't hound you  everywhere with my toga turned inside out.  And the fellow that taught  you such manners did a good job too, a chattering ape, all right, no  schoolmaster.  We were better taught.  'Is everything in its place?' the  master would ask; go straight home and don't stop and stare at everything  and don't be impudent to your elders.  Don't loiter along looking in at  the shops.  No second raters came out of that school.  I'm what you see  me and I thank the gods it's all due to my own cleverness.\"          CHAPTER THE FIFTY-NINTH.    Ascyltos was just starting in to answer this indictment when Trimalchio,  who was delighted with his fellow-freedman's tirade, broke in, \"Cut out  the bickering and let's have things pleasant here.  Let up on the young  fellow, Hermeros, he's hot-blooded, so you ought to be more reasonable.  The loser's always the winner in arguments of this kind.  And as for you,  even when you were a young punk you used to go 'Co-co co-co,' like a hen  after a rooster, but you had no pep. Let's get to better business and  start the fun all over again and watch the Homerists.\"  A troupe filed  in, immediately, and clashed spears against shields.  Trimalchio sat  himself up on his cushion and intoned in Latin, from a book, while the  actors, in accordance with their conceited custom, recited their parts in  the Greek language.  There came a pause, presently, and \"You don't any of  you know the plot of the skit they're putting on, do you?\"  he asked,  \"Diomedes and Ganymede were two brothers, and Helen was their sister;  Agamemnon ran away with her and palmed off a doe on Diana, in her place,  so Homer tells how the Trojans and Parentines fought among themselves.  Of course Agamemnon was victorious, and gave his daughter Iphigenia, to  Achilles, for a wife: This caused Ajax to go mad, and he'll soon make the  whole thing plain to you.\"  The Homerists raised a shout, as soon as  Trimalchio had done speaking, and, as the whole familia stepped back, a  boiled calf with a helmet on its head was brought in on an enormous  platter.  Ajax followed and rushed upon it with drawn sword, as if he  were insane, he made passes with the flat, and again with the edge, and  then, collecting the slices, he skewered them, and, much to our  astonishment, presented them to us on the point of his sword.          CHAPTER THE SIXTIETH.    But we were not given long in which to admire the elegance of such  service, for all of a sudden the ceiling commenced to creak and then the  whole dining-room shook.  I leaped to my feet in consternation, for fear  some rope-walker would fall down, and the rest of the company raised  their faces, wondering as much as I what new prodigy was to be announced  from on high.  Then lo and behold! the ceiling panels parted and an  enormous hoop, which appeared to have been knocked off a huge cask, was  lowered from the dome above; its perimeter was hung with golden chaplets  and jars of alabaster filled with perfume.  We were asked to accept these  articles as souvenirs.  When my glance returned to the table, I noticed  that a dish containing cakes had been placed upon it, and in the middle  an image of Priapus, made by the baker, and he held apples of all  varieties and bunches of grapes against his breast, in the conventional  manner.  We applied ourselves wholeheartedly to this dessert and our  joviality was suddenly revived by a fresh diversion, for, at the  slightest pressure, all the cakes and fruits would squirt a saffron sauce  upon us, and even spurted unpleasantly into our faces.  Being convinced  that these perfumed dainties had some religious significance, we arose in  a body and shouted, \"Hurrah for the Emperor, the father of his country!\"  However, as we perceived that even after this act of veneration, the  others continued helping themselves, we filled our napkins with the  apples.  I was especially keen on this, for I thought I could never put  enough good things into Giton's lap.  Three slaves entered, in the  meantime, dressed in white tunics well tucked up, and two of them placed  Lares with amulets hanging from their necks, upon the table, while the  third carried round a bowl of wine and cried, \"May the gods be  propitious!"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5255"],[0,"The Book of Good Manners; a Guide to Polite Usage for All Social Functions (#16)"],[1," When wraps have been removed, and         the woman leaves the dressing-room, the escort         chosen by the hostess approaches and makes         known the fact, accompanying her to the         table. If the escort is not thoroughly agreeable         to the woman, she should conceal the         fact.           At the conclusion of a dinner the hostess rises         and the women follow, leaving their napkins         unfolded. They retire to the drawing-room,         while the men remain for coffee and cigars.         If the men prefer, they may escort them to         the drawing-room, where they bow and return.      GLOVES. Women may remove their gloves at         table, and it is not necessary to replace them.         They should be laid in the lap. The hostess         generally determines whether the women         should resume their gloves or not by her own         actions.           Full dress is worn.      GIVEN BY MEN--WOMEN. A young woman may         accept a man's invitation, provided she has         the consent of her mother or guardian, and         is assured that there will be present a chaperone.      GIVEN BY BACHELORS. See BACHELORS' DINNERS.        DINNER DANCE.      INVITATIONS. The hostess issues two sets of         invitations--one for those invited to both the         dinner and the dance, and one for those invited         to the dance only.           For the former she could use her usual         engraved dinner cards with the words: Dancing         at eleven, and for the latter her usual         engraved At Home cards with the words:         Dancing at eleven.           A less formal way for the latter invitation         is to use the Mr. and Mrs. card or Mrs. and         Miss card, and to write on it in the lower left         hand corner: Dancing at ten, February the         tenth.        DOCTOR--HOW ADDRESSED. A doctor or physician         should be addressed as Dr. both by correspondence         and in conversation.           This title of Dr. must not be confounded         with the honorary degree of Doctor of Divinity,         conferred upon clergymen by educational         institutions, and the degree of Doctor of         Philosophy, conferred upon college professors         after certain conditions of study have been         complied with.

At all entertainments,         dressing-rooms should be provided for both         the men and for the women, with suitable         attendants, where all outer wraps, coats, over-         shoes, etc., should be left.        DRIVING      MEN. When driving with a woman, a man should         be careful that the carriage is well drawn up         to the steps, and that she be given time in         which to comfortably seat herself before he         begins to drive.           A man when driving with a woman should         refrain from asking her permission to smoke,         and, of course, would never do so without her         permission.           He should be careful to lift his hat as if he         were on the street, and if this is not possible,         to touch it with the whip in place of a bow.           The host of a coaching party, if he is also         the whip, would give the chaperone the seat         on the box at the left of his, unless he wished         that seat to be occupied by some special young         woman. The person occupying this seat         should always be helped by the host to climb         to her place.           It is customary when the coach is a high         one to seat a woman between two men, and         they would ascend and descend in the order         in which they were seated.           Even if the woman asks a man to drive with         her, he should help her to her seat, and be         ready to step down when a halt is made to         assist her to alight.           It is not customary when a woman has         asked a man to drive with her for her to call         for him at his club or home, but to meet him         at her house.      DRESS. The whip wears a gray suit with a gray         high hat and gray gloves, with a white silk         tie and white linen. But in summer this costume         is often made lighter and more comfortable         to suit the weather, and a straw hat         or panama, with flannel trousers and dark         serge sacque coat, would be in good taste.           There are no hard and fast rules governing         the dress of men when driving.      WOMEN. The etiquette in general is the same         for a woman as for a man.           When a woman asks a man or a male relative         to drive with her, she does not call for         him, but meets him at her door. Even if a         groom is present, he should help her to         mount to her seat, and at the proper time         descend before her and help her to alight.        DUCHESS--HOW ADDRESSED. An official letter begins:         Madam, may it please Your Grace, and ends:         I have the honor to remain your Grace's obedient         servant.             A social letter begins: My Dear Duchess of         Kent, and ends: Believe me, dear Duchess,         yours very truly.           The address on the envelope is: To Her         Grace, The Duchess of Kent.        DUCHESS, DOWAGER--HOW ADDRESSED.

See Son (Younger) of Earl.        EGGS are usually broken into a glass and eaten with         a spoon.        ELEVATOR. Men should remove their hats when         riding in an elevator with women, although         it is held by some that an elevator is as much         a public conveyance as a car, and this act of         courtesy as unnecessary in the one place as         in the other. Women enter and leave before         men.        ENGAGEMENT.      MEN It is his duty to see the woman's parents         or guardian, and to make known his         intentions, and to tell them fully and frankly         about himself, his family, his social position,         and business prospects. He should court the         fullest investigation, and take his own family         into his confidence, but not mention it to         others.      PARENTS OF MAN. They should send their         pleasant greetings and congratulations,         accompanied with flowers, and if both families         are old acquaintances, a present may be sent         to the prospective bride.      PARENTS OF WOMAN. The first step is to bring         together both parents in social intercourse--         as, by a dinner given by the man's or woman's         family, when friends may be invited, by         interchange of notes and congratulations, by         any social visit, or by any function that good         taste may dictate.           If one family lives out of town, it may         invite various members of the other family         living in the city to make visits of some         duration, as a week or more. These visits should         be returned.      PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT. This item of news is         rarely"]]]
