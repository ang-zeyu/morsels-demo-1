The differences that Osgood (_loc. cit._) deemed \"...  scarcely worthy of recognition ...,\" are, in fact, not only worthy of  recognition, but also important in an understanding of the evolution of  _Baiomys taylori_ (see speciation p. 659). Recently, I (1958b:17-18)  studied ten specimens from Colima (City), Colima, and chose to regard  _Peromyscus [= Baiomys] allex_ as a subspecies. I suggested (_loc.  cit._) that the geographic range of _B. t. allex_ might encompass the  southern part of Nayarit, and western Jalisco. Subsequent study of  specimens from these areas reveals that the populations there are  referable to _allex_. Most of the specimens obtained from these areas,  however, merit special comment.    In color of pelage, those populations from south of the Rio Grande de  Santiago and northwest of Guadalajara (4 mi. SE Ahuacatlan; 1 mi. E  Ixtlan; Etzatlan) show evidence of intergradation with _paulus_ to the  east and south (Magdalena, Tequila, and Tala, Jalisco), and with  populations more closely adjacent to the south bank of that river.  Intergradation is indeed complex in this area. Specimens from some  localities seem to be intergrades between _allex_ and _paulus_; from  other localities, some specimens are referable to _allex_, and the  others to _paulus_; from still other localities, all specimens are  referable to _allex_.    A series of 39 specimens from 1 mi. SSE Ameca, 4000 ft., Jalisco, are  uniformly grayish-brown. This series averages grayer than paratypes of  _allex_. There is little, if any, difference between the series from 1  mi. SSE Ameca and paratypes of _allex_ in external size of body, hind  foot, length of ear, and size and conformation of the cranium.  Populations from Ameca and vicinity might be expected to average  considerably larger inasmuch as they occur at higher altitudes (see  Bergman's Rule, p. 609) then the material from the lower coastal plains  to the south in Colima and Michoacan, and at lower elevations in the  west in Jalisco and Nayarit. The means of external and cranial  measurements are not significantly different between the specimens from  the highlands and those from the lowlands. In the area of Ameca where  the two species _B. musculus_ and _B. taylori_ occur together,  interspecific competition seems to have limited, perhaps even reduced,  size of external and cranial parts of _taylori_ (see p. 660).    In color, specimens from the northern part of the valley of the Rio  Tepalcatepec (10 mi. S, 1 mi. W Apatzingan) in Michoacan resemble  paratypes of _allex_. Intergradation probably occurs to the north with  _analogous_.    In the eight specimens from 13 mi. E and 1 mi. N Talpa de Allende, the  skull, as reflected in occipitonasal length and zygomatic breadth  relative to length of body, is larger than in other specimens here  assigned to _allex_. The median part of the belly of the eight specimens  is buff-colored rather than whitish-gray as in typical _allex_; the  mid-dorsal region also averages darker than in any other specimens  referred to _allex_. Additional specimens are needed from this and  closely adjacent areas, especially to the west on the coastal plain, in  order to determine more accurately the taxonomic status of the mice  there. At present, it seems best to refer them to _allex_. Possibly the  population represented by the eight specimens is an incipient  subspecies.    There is no evidence of hybridization or intergradation of populations  of _B. t. allex_ with any population of _B. musculus_ where the two  species occur together.    _Specimens examined._--Total 233, all from the Republic of Mexico,  distributed as follows: NAYARIT: 3 mi.

In spring and autumn, the snakes are active  mostly on warm, sunny days, whereas in summer they are active mostly at  night. In order to maintain adequate internal temperatures, much time is  spent basking mostly in a characteristic flat, resting coil either  beside a body of water or above water on limbs of dead trees. In this  position the snake is ready either for a short strike or a hasty  getaway.    Juveniles appear particularly aggressive and strike repeatedly when  approached, a behavioral pattern definitely favoring survival. Adults  vary in disposition, usually appearing sluggish and lazy, but they are  capable of striking rapidly when disturbed. The typical threat display  consists of lying in a coiled position with the mouth opened widely,  exposing the white interior, and with the tail vibrating rapidly. The  striking posture resembles the resting coil except that the anterior  part of the body is raised off the ground and the mouth is sometimes  opened. Musk is often ejected in a fine spray from glands in the tail as  a further defensive action.    \"Head bobbing,\" more properly described as spastic contractions of the  body, was observed in captives when food was introduced into a cage  containing several individuals or when one of the snakes was returned to  the cage after being handled. Reports in the literature also have  connected these jerking movements with courtship. The response appears  to be elicited whenever a nervous state is recognized in another  individual and may serve to protect the jerking individual from  aggressive advances of the former.    The relatively heavy appearance of the body, sluggish habits, and  cryptic coloration are correlated with the development of venom and  fangs. The poison apparatus has developed primarily as a means of  causing rapid death in prey and secondarily, perhaps, to begin the  digestion of small animals that are the usual prey, but it is also  important as a defensive device. The venom contains at least eight  constituents that aid in its action on prey. Toxicity of the venom is  difficult to determine because of numerous variables, but cottonmouth  venom is generally believed to be less potent than that of most  rattlesnakes and more potent than that of the copperhead. Snakes in  general are more resistant to snake venoms than other vertebrates of  similar size, but there is no immunity even to their own venom.    About ten per cent of the approximately 5000 bites of poisonous snakes  per year in the United States are attributable to cottonmouths, and  about seven per cent of the approximately 14 deaths per year are caused  by cottonmouths.
