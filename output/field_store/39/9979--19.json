So Minerva, the goddess of wisdom, and patroness of all  the liberal arts and sciences, became the tutelary deity of Athens.  The contest between her and Neptune was represented on one of the  pediments of the Parthenon.    Of the history of Athens for many centuries subsequent to its  alleged founding by Cecrops we have no certain information; but  it is probable that down to about 683 B.C. it was ruled by kings,  like all the other Grecian states. Of these kings the names of  The'seus and Co'drus are the most noted. To the former is ascribed  the union of the twelve states of Attica into one political body,  with Athens as the capital, and other important acts of government  which won for him the love of the Athenian people. Consulting the  oracle of Delphi concerning his new government, he is said to have  received the following answer:      From royal stems thy honor, Theseus, springs;    By Jove beloved, the sire supreme of kings.    See rising towns, see wide-extended states,    On thee dependent, ask their future fates!    Hence, hence with fear! Thy favored bark shall ride    Safe o'er the surges of the foamy tide.    About half a century after the time of Cecrops another Egyptian,  named Dan'a-us, is said to have fled to Greece, with a family  of fifty daughters, and to have established a second Egyptian  colony in the vicinity of Argos. He subsequently became king of  Argos, and the inhabitants were called Dan'a-i. About the same  time Cadmus, a Phoenician, is reported to have led a colony into  Boeo'tia, bringing with him the Phoenician alphabet, the basis  of the Grecian; and to have founded Cadme'a, which afterward  became the citadel of Thebes. Another colony is said to have been  led from Asia by Pe'lops, from whom the southern peninsula of  Greece derived its name of Peloponne'sus, and of whom Agamemnon,  King of Myce'nae, was a lineal descendant. About this time a people  called the Helle'nes--but whether a Pelasgic tribe or otherwise  is uncertain--first appeared in the south of Thessaly, and,  gradually diffusing themselves over the whole country, became,  by their martial spirit and active, enterprising genius, the ruling  class, and impressed new features upon the Grecian character. The  Hellenes gave their name to the population of the whole peninsula,  although the term Grecians was subsequently applied to them by the  Romans.    In accordance with the Greek custom of attributing the origin  of their tribes or nations to some remote mythical ancestor,  Hel'len, a son of the fabulous Deuca'lion and Pyrrha, is  represented as the father of the Hellen'ic nation. His three  sons were AE'o-lus, Do'rus, and Xu'thus, from the two former of  whom are represented to have descended the AEo'lians and Do'rians;  and from Achae'us and I'on, sons of Xuthus, the Achae'ans and  Io'nians. These four Hellen'ic or Grecian tribes were  distinguished from one another by many peculiarities of language  and institutions. Hellen is said to have left his kingdom to  AEolus, his eldest son; and the AEolian tribe spread the most  widely, and long exerted the most influence in the affairs of  the nation; but at a later period it was surpassed by the fame  and the power of the Dorians and Ionians.           *       *       *       *       *    III. THE HEROIC AGE.    The period from the time of the first appearance of the Hellenes  in Thessaly to the return of the Greeks from the expedition against  Troy--a period of about two hundred years--is usually called the  Heroic Age. It is a period abounding in splendid fictions of  heroes and demi-gods, embracing, among others, the twelve wonderful  labors of Hercules; the exploits of the Athenian king The'seus,  and of Mi'nos, King of Crete, the founder of Grecian law and  civilization; the events of the Argonautic expedition; the Theban  and Argol'ic wars; the adventures of Beller'ophon, Per'seus, and  many others; and concluding with the Trojan war and the supposed  fall of Troy. These seem to have been the times which the archangel  Michael foretold to Adam when he said,      For in those days might only shall be admired,    And valor and heroic virtue called:    To overcome in battle, and subdue    Nations, and bring home spoils with infinite    Manslaughter, shall be held the highest pitch    Of human glory; and, for glory done,    Of triumph to be styled great conquerors,    Patrons of mankind, gods, and sons of gods--    Destroyers rightly called, and plagues of men.      --Paradise Lost, B. XI.      THE LABORS OF HERCULES.    The twelve arduous labors of the celebrated hero Hercules, who  was a son of Jupiter by the daughter of an early king of Mycenae,  are said to have been imposed upon him by an enemy--Eurys'theus--to  whose will Jupiter, induced by a fraud of Juno and the fury-goddess  A'te, and unwittingly bound by an oath, had made the hero  subservient for twelve years. Jupiter grieved for his son, but,  unable to recall the oath which he had sworn, he punished Ate by  hurling her from Olympus down to the nether world.      Grief seized the Thunderer, by his oath engaged;    Stung to the soul, he sorrowed and he raged.    From his ambrosial head, where perched she sate,    He snatched the fury-goddess of debate:    The dread, the irrevocable oath he swore,    The immortal seats should ne'er behold her more;    And whirled her headlong down, forever driven    From bright Olympus and the starry heaven:    Thence on the nether world the fury fell,    Ordained with man's contentious race to dwell.    Full oft the god his son's hard toils bemoaned,    Cursed the dire folly, and in secret groaned.      --HOMER'S Iliad, B. XIX. POPE'S Trans.    The following, in brief, are the twelve labors attributed to  Hercules: 1. He strangled the Ne'mean lion, and ever after wore  his skin. 2. He destroyed the Lernae'an hydra, which had nine  heads, eight of them mortal and one immortal. 3. He brought into  the presence of Eurystheus a stag famous for its incredible  swiftness and golden horns. 4. He brought to Mycenae the wild  boar of Eryman'thus, and slew two of the Centaurs, monsters who  were half men and half horses. 5. He cleansed the Auge'an stables  in one day by changing the courses of the rivers Alphe'us and  Pene'us. 6. He destroyed the carnivorous birds of the lake  Stympha'lus, in Arcadia. 7. He brought into Peloponnesus the  prodigious wild bull which ravaged Crete. 8. He brought from  Thrace the mares of Diome'de, which fed on human flesh. 9. He  obtained the famous girdle of Hippol'y-te, queen of the Amazons.  10. He slew the monster Ge'ry-on, who had the bodies of three  men united. 11. He brought from the garden of the Hesper'i-des  the golden apples, and slew the dragon which guarded them. 12. He  went down to the lower regions and brought upon earth the  three-headed dog Cer'berus.    The favor of the gods had completely armed Hercules for his  undertakings, and his great strength enabled him to perform them.  This entire fable of Hercules is generally believed to be merely  a fanciful representation of the sun in its passage through the  twelve signs of the zodiac, in accordance with Phoenician mythology,  from which the legend is supposed to be derived. Thus Hercules  is the sun-god. In the first month of the year the sun passes  through the constellation Leo, the lion; and in his first labor  the hero slays the Nemean lion. In the second month, when the  sun enters the sign Virgo, the long-extended constellation of  the Hydra sets--the stars of which, like so many heads, rise  one after another; and, therefore, in his second labor, Hercules  destroys the Lernaean hydra with its nine heads. In like manner  the legend is explained throughout. Besides these twelve labors,  however, Hercules is said to have achieved others on his own  account; and one of these is told in the fable of Hercules and  Antae'us, in which the powers of art and nature are supposed to  be personified.      FABLE OF HERCULES AND ANTAEUS.    Antae'us--a son of Neptune and Terra, who reigned over Libya, or  Africa, and dwelt in a forest cave--was so famed for his Titanic  strength and skill in wrestling that he was emboldened to leave  his woodland retreat and engage in a contest with the renowned  hero Hercules. So long as Antaeus stood upon the ground he could  not be overcome, whereupon Hercules lifted him up in the air,  and, having apparently squeezed him to death in his arms, threw  him down; but when Antaeus touched his mother Earth and lay at  rest upon her bosom, renewed life and fresh power were given him.    In this fable Antaeus, who personifies the woodland solitude and  the desert African waste, is easily overcome by his adversary,  who represents the river Nile, which, divided into a thousand  arms, or irrigating canals, prevents the arid sand from being  borne away and then back again by the winds to desolate the fertile  valley. Thus the legend is nothing more than the triumph of art  and labor, and their reclaiming power over the woodland solitudes  and the encroaching sands of the desert. An English poet has very  happily versified the spirit of the legend, to which he has appended  a fitting moral, doubtless suggested by the warning of his own  approaching sad fate.[Footnote: This gifted poet, Mortimer Collins,  died in 1876, at the age of forty-nine, a victim to excessive  literary labor and anxiety.]      Deep were the meanings of that fable. Men    Looked upon earth with clearer eyesight then,    Beheld in solitude the immortal Powers,    And marked the traces of the swift-winged Hours.    Because it never varies, all can bear    The burden of the circumambient air;    Because it never ceases, none can hear    The music of the ever-rolling sphere--    None, save the poet, who, in moor and wood,    Holds converse with the spirit of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6852"],[0,"Venus in Furs (#16)"],[1,"in my internal struggle,  I looked upward for a moment. It occurred to me that the painting on the  ceiling, like many of those of the Italian and Dutch schools, was  utterly unhistorical, but this very fact gave it a strange mood which  had an almost uncanny effect on me. Delilah, an opulent woman with  flaming red hair, lay extended, half-disrobed, in a dark fur-cloak, upon  a red ottoman, and bent smiling over Samson who had been overthrown and  bound by the Philistines. Her smile in its mocking coquetry was full of  a diabolical cruelty; her eyes, half-closed, met Samson's, and his with  a last look of insane passion cling to hers, for already one of his  enemies is kneeling on his breast with the red-hot iron to blind him.    \"Now--\" said Wanda. \"Why you are all lost in thought. What is the  matter with you, everything will remain just as it was, even after  you have signed, don't you know me yet, dear heart?\"    I looked at the agreement. Her name was written there in bold  letters. I peered once more into her eyes with their potent magic,  then I took the pen and quickly signed the agreement.    \"You are trembling,\" said Wanda calmly, \"shall I help you?\"    She gently took hold of my hand, and my name appeared at the bottom  of the second paper. Wanda looked once more at the two documents, and  then locked them in the desk which stood at the head of the ottoman.    \"Now then, give me your passport and money.\"    I took out my wallet and handed it to her. She inspected it, nodded,  and put it with other things while in a sweet drunkenness I kneeled  before her leaning my head against her breast.    Suddenly she thrusts me away with her foot, leaps up, and pulls the  bell-rope. In answer to its sound three young, slender negresses  enter; they are as if carved of ebony, and are dressed from head to  foot in red satin; each one has a rope in her hand.    Suddenly I realize my position, and am about to rise. Wanda stands  proudly erect, her cold beautiful face with its sombre brows and  contemptous eyes is turned toward me. She stands before me as  mistress, commanding, gives a sign with her hand, and before I really  know what has happened to me the negresses have dragged me to the  ground, and have tied me hand and foot. As in the case of one about  to be executed my arms are bound behind my back, so that I can  scarcely move.    \"Give me the whip, Haydee,\" commands Wanda, with unearthly calm.    The negress hands it to her mistress, kneeling.    \"And now take off my heavy furs,\" she continues, \"they impede me.\"    The negress obeyed.    \"The jacket there!\" Wanda commanded.    Haydee quickly brought her the _kazabaika_, set with ermine, which lay  on the bed, and Wanda slipped into it with two inimitably graceful  movements.    \"Now tie him to the pillar here!\"    The negresses lifted me up, and twisting a heavy rope around my  body, tied me standing against one of the massive pillars which  supported the top of the wide Italian bed.    Then they suddenly disappeared, as if the earth had swallowed them.    Wanda swiftly approached me. Her white satin dress flowed behind her  in a long train, like silver, like moonlight; her hair flared like  flames against the white fur of her jacket. Now she stood in front  of me with her left hand firmly planted on her hips, in her right hand  she held the whip. She uttered an abrupt laugh.    \"Now play has come to an end between us,\" she said with heartless  coldness. \"Now we will begin in dead earnest. You fool, I laugh at you  and despise you; you who in your insane infatuation have given  yourself as a plaything to _me_, the frivolous and capricious woman.  You are no longer the man I love, but _my slave_, at my mercy even  unto life and death.    \"You shall know me!    \"First of all you shall have a taste of the whip in all seriousness,  without having done anything to deserve it, so that you may  understand what to expect, if you are awkward, disobedient, or  refractory.\"    With a wild grace she rolled back her fur-lined sleeve, and struck  me across the back.    I winced, for the whip cut like a knife into my flesh.    \"Well, how do you like that?\" she exclaimed.    I was silent.    \"Just wait, you will yet whine like a dog beneath my whip,\" she  threatened, and simultaneously began to strike me again.    The blows fell quickly, in rapid succession, with terrific force  upon my back, arms, and neck; I had to grit my teeth not to scream  aloud. Now she struck me in the face, warm blood ran down, but she  laughed, and continued her blows.    \"It is only now I understand you,\" she exclaimed. \"It really is a  joy to have some one so completely in one's power, and a man at that,  who loves you--you do love me?--No--Oh! I'll tear you to shreds yet,  and with each blow my pleasure will grow. Now, twist like a worm,  scream, whine! You will find no mercy in me!\"    Finally she seemed tired.    She tossed the whip aside, stretched out on the ottoman, and rang.    The negresses entered.    \"Untie him!\"    As they loosened the rope, I fell to the floor like a lump of wood.  The black women grinned, showing their white teeth.    \"Untie the rope around his feet.\"    They did it, but I was unable to rise.    \"Come over here, Gregor.\"    I approached the beautiful woman. Never did she seem more seductive  to me than to-day in spite of all her cruelty and contempt.    \"One step further,\" Wanda commanded. \"Now kneel down, and kiss my  foot.\"    She extended her foot beyond the hem of white satin, and I, the  supersensual fool, pressed my lips upon it.    \"Now, you won't lay eyes on me for an entire month, Gregor,\" she  said seriously. \"I want to become a stranger to you, so you will more  easily adjust yourself to our new relationship. In the meantime you  will work in the garden, and await my orders. Now, off with you,  slave!\"           *       *       *       *       *    A month has passed with monotonous regularity, heavy work, and a  melancholy hunger, hunger for her, who is inflicting all these  torments on me.    I am under the gardener's orders; I help him lop the trees and prune  the hedges, transplant flowers, turn over the flower beds, sweep the  gravel paths; I share his coarse food and his hard cot; I rise and  go to bed with the chickens. Now and then I hear that our mistress  is amusing herself, surrounded by admirers. Once I heard her gay  laughter even down here in the garden.    I seem awfully stupid to myself. Was it the result of my present  life, or was I so before? The month is drawing to a close--the day  after to-morrow. What will she do with me now, or has she forgotten  me, and left me to trim hedges and bind bouquets till my dying day?    A written order.    \"The slave Gregor is herewith ordered to my personal service.    Wanda Dunajew.\"    With a beating heart I draw aside the damask curtain on the  following morning, and enter the bed-room of my divinity. It is still  filled with a pleasant half darkness.    \"Is it you, Gregor?\" she asks, while I kneel before the fire-place,  building a fire. I tremble at the sound of the beloved voice. I  cannot see her herself; she is invisible behind the curtains of the  four-poster bed.    \"Yes, my mistress,\" I reply.    \"How late is it?\"    \"Past nine o'clock.\"    \"Breakfast.\"    I hasten to get it, and then kneel down with the tray beside her bed.    \"Here is breakfast, my mistress.\"    Wanda draws back the curtains, and curiously enough at the first  glance when I see her among the pillows with loosened flowing hair,  she seems an absolute stranger, a beautiful woman, but the beloved  soft lines are gone. This face is hard and has an expression of  weariness and satiety.    Or is it simply that formerly my eye did not see this?    She fixes her green eyes upon me, more with curiosity than with  menace, perhaps even somewhat pityingly, and lazily pulls the dark  sleeping fur on which she lies over the bared shoulder.    At this moment she is very charming, very maddening, and I feel my  blood rising to my head and heart. The tray in my hands begins to  sway. She notices it and reached out for the whip which is lying on  the toilet-table.    \"You are awkward, slave,\" she says furrowing her brow.    I lower my looks to the ground, and hold the tray as steadily as  possible. She eats her breakfast, yawns, and stretches her opulent  limbs in the magnificent furs.    She has rung. I enter.    \"Take this letter to Prince Corsini.\"    I hurry into the city, and hand the letter to the Prince. He is a  handsome young man with glowing black eyes. Consumed with jealousy,  I take his answer to her.    \"What is the matter with you?\" she asks with lurking spitefulness.  \"You are very pale.\"    \"Nothing, mistress, I merely walked rather fast.\"    At luncheon the prince is at her side, and I am condemned to serve  both her and him. They joke, and I am, as if non-existent, for both.  For a brief moment I see black; I was just pouring some Bordeaux into  his glass, and spilled it over the table-cloth and her gown.    \"How awkward,\" Wanda exclaimed and slapped my face. The prince  laughed, and she also, but I felt the blood rising to my face.    After luncheon she drove in the Cascine. She has a little carriage  with a handsome, brown English horse, and holds the reins herself.  I sit behind and notice how coquettishly she acts, and nods with a  smile when one of the distinguished gentlemen bows to her.    As I help her out of the carriage, she leans lightly on my arm; the  contact runs through me like an electric shock. She _is_ a wonderful  woman, and I love her more than ever.           *       *       *       *       *    For dinner at six she has invited a small group of men and women. I  serve, but this time I do not spill any wine over the table-cloth.    A slap in the face is more effective than ten lectures. It makes you  understand very quickly, especially when the instruction is by the  way of a small woman's"]]]
