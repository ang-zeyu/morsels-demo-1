Dreams and waking life, in our first efforts at construction, must be  treated with equal respect; it is only by some reality not _merely_  sensible that dreams can be condemned.    Accepting the indubitable momentary reality of objects of sense, the  next thing to notice is the confusion underlying objections derived from  their changeableness. As we walk round the table, its aspect changes;  but it is thought impossible to maintain either that the table changes,  or that its various aspects can all \"really\" exist in the same place. If  we press one eyeball, we shall see two tables; but it is thought  preposterous to maintain that there are \"really\" two tables. Such  arguments, however, seem to involve the assumption that there can be  something more real than objects of sense. If we see two tables, then  there _are_ two visual tables. It is perfectly true that, at the same  moment, we may discover by touch that there is only one tactile table.  This makes us declare the two visual tables an illusion, because usually  one visual object corresponds to one tactile object. But all that we are  warranted in saying is that, in this case, the manner of correlation of  touch and sight is unusual. Again, when the aspect of the table changes  as we walk round it, and we are told there cannot be so many different  aspects in the same place, the answer is simple: what does the critic of  the table mean by \"the same place\"? The use of such a phrase presupposes  that all our difficulties have been solved; as yet, we have no right to  speak of a \"place\" except with reference to one given set of momentary  sense-data. When all are changed by a bodily movement, no place remains  the same as it was. Thus the difficulty, if it exists, has at least not  been rightly stated.    We will now make a new start, adopting a different method. Instead of  inquiring what is the minimum of assumption by which we can explain the  world of sense, we will, in order to have a model hypothesis as a help  for the imagination, construct one possible (not necessary) explanation  of the facts. It may perhaps then be possible to pare away what is  superfluous in our hypothesis, leaving a residue which may be regarded  as the abstract answer to our problem.    Let us imagine that each mind looks out upon the world, as in Leibniz's  monadology, from a point of view peculiar to itself; and for the sake of  simplicity let us confine ourselves to the sense of sight, ignoring  minds which are devoid of this sense. Each mind sees at each moment an  immensely complex three-dimensional world; but there is absolutely  nothing which is seen by two minds simultaneously. When we say that two  people see the same thing, we always find that, owing to difference of  point of view, there are differences, however slight, between their  immediate sensible objects. (I am here assuming the validity of  testimony, but as we are only constructing a _possible_ theory, that is  a legitimate assumption.) The three-dimensional world seen by one mind  therefore contains no place in common with that seen by another, for  places can only be constituted by the things in or around them. Hence we  may suppose, in spite of the differences between the different worlds,  that each exists entire exactly as it is perceived, and might be exactly  as it is even if it were not perceived. We may further suppose that  there are an infinite number of such worlds which are in fact  unperceived. If two men are sitting in a room, two somewhat similar  worlds are perceived by them; if a third man enters and sits between  them, a third world, intermediate between the two previous worlds,  begins to be perceived. It is true that we cannot reasonably suppose  just this world to have existed before, because it is conditioned by the  sense-organs, nerves, and brain of the newly arrived man; but we can  reasonably suppose that _some_ aspect of the universe existed from that  point of view, though no one was perceiving it. The system consisting of  all views of the universe perceived and unperceived, I shall call the  system of \"perspectives\"; I shall confine the expression \"private  worlds\" to such views of the universe as are actually perceived. Thus a  \"private world\" is a perceived \"perspective\"; but there may be any  number of unperceived perspectives.    Two men are sometimes found to perceive very similar perspectives, so  similar that they can use the same words to describe them. They say they  see the same table, because the differences between the two tables they  see are slight and not practically important. Thus it is possible,  sometimes, to establish a correlation by similarity between a great many  of the things of one perspective, and a great many of the things of  another. In case the similarity is very great, we say the points of view  of the two perspectives are near together in space; but this space in  which they are near together is totally different from the spaces inside  the two perspectives. It is a relation between the perspectives, and is  not in either of them; no one can perceive it, and if it is to be known  it can be only by inference. Between two perceived perspectives which  are similar, we can imagine a whole series of other perspectives, some  at least unperceived, and such that between any two, however similar,  there are others still more similar. In this way the space which  consists of relations between perspectives can be rendered continuous,  and (if we choose) three-dimensional.    We can now define the momentary common-sense \"thing,\" as opposed to its  momentary appearances. By the similarity of neighbouring perspectives,  many objects in the one can be correlated with objects in the other,  namely, with the similar objects. Given an object in one perspective,  form the system of all the objects correlated with it in all the  perspectives; that system may be identified with the momentary  common-sense \"thing.\" Thus an aspect of a \"thing\" is a member of the  system of aspects which _is_ the \"thing\" at that moment. (The  correlation of the times of different perspectives raises certain  complications, of the kind considered in the theory of relativity; but  we may ignore these at present.) All the aspects of a thing are real,  whereas the thing is a mere logical construction. It has, however, the  merit of being neutral as between different points of view, and of being  visible to more than one person, in the only sense in which it can ever  be visible, namely, in the sense that each sees one of its aspects.    It will be observed that, while each perspective contains its own space,  there is only one space in which the perspectives themselves are the  elements. There are as many private spaces as there are perspectives;  there are therefore at least as many as there are percipients, and there  may be any number of others which have a merely material existence and  are not seen by anyone. But there is only one perspective-space, whose  elements are single perspectives, each with its own private space. We  have now to explain how the private space of a single perspective is  correlated with part of the one all-embracing perspective space.    Perspective space is the system of \"points of view\" of private spaces  (perspectives), or, since \"points of view\" have not been defined, we may  say it is the system of the private spaces themselves. These private  spaces will each count as one point, or at any rate as one element, in  perspective space. They are ordered by means of their similarities.  Suppose, for example, that we start from one which contains the  appearance of a circular disc, such as would be called a penny, and  suppose this appearance, in the perspective in question, is circular,  not elliptic. We can then form a whole series of perspectives containing  a graduated series of circular aspects of varying sizes: for this  purpose we only have to move (as we say) towards the penny or away from  it. The perspectives in which the penny looks circular will be said to  lie on a straight line in perspective space, and their order on this  line will be that of the sizes of the circular aspects. Moreover--though  this statement must be noticed and subsequently examined--the  perspectives in which the penny looks big will be said to be nearer to  the penny than those in which it looks small. It is to be remarked also  that any other \"thing\" than our penny might have been chosen to define  the relations of our perspectives in perspective space, and that  experience shows that the same spatial order of perspectives would have  resulted.    In order to explain the correlation of private spaces with perspective  space, we have first to explain what is meant by \"the place (in  perspective space) where a thing is.\" For this purpose, let us again  consider the penny which appears in many perspectives. We formed a  straight line of perspectives in which the penny looked circular, and we  agreed that those in which it looked larger were to be considered as  nearer to the penny. We can form another straight line of perspectives  in which the penny is seen end-on and looks like a straight line of a  certain thickness. These two lines will meet in a certain place in  perspective space, _i.e._ in a certain perspective, which may be defined  as \"the place (in perspective space) where the penny is.\" It is true  that, in order to prolong our lines until they reach this place, we  shall have to make use of other things besides the penny, because, so  far as experience goes, the penny ceases to present any appearance after  we have come so near to it that it touches the eye. But this raises no  real difficulty, because the spatial order of perspectives is found  empirically to be independent of the particular \"things\" chosen for  defining the order. We can, for example, remove our penny and prolong  each of our two straight lines up to their"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37122"],[0,"Hunting in Many Lands: The Book of the Boone and Crockett Club (#16)"],[1,"xperience. I was shooting at  that time a little double rifle (.450-120-375 solid bullet), which had  been made for me by Holland & Holland, and which was fitted with one of  my conical sights.    Before I was within fifty yards of the end of the muskeg, I saw one of  the moose dash across it, about 150 yards away. I fired quickly, and in  much the same way that I would shoot at a jacksnipe which had been  flushed in some thicket; but had the satisfaction of seeing the animal  lurch heavily forward as he went out of sight into the timber. Almost  immediately, and before I had time to reload, the second moose followed.  I gave him the other barrel, but I did not know until afterward that he  was hit. In fact, it was hard to get a bullet through the timber. I  reloaded quickly, and ran forward to get to the opening; but before I  reached it, the third moose passed in immediately behind the others. I  again shot quickly, and felt that I had probably hit him. By running on  rapidly I reached the edge of the opening in time to intercept the  fourth moose. As he came into the opening I got a good shot at him, not  over eighty yards distant, and felt very sure of this one at least. I  then reloaded, when, to my amazement, the fifth, in a very deliberate  manner, walked, not trotted, into the muskeg, which at the point where  the moose crossed it was not over sixty or seventy feet wide. He first  looked up and down, as if undetermined what to do, and then, probably  seeing one of the other moose on the ground, commenced walking up toward  me. As luck would have it, I got a cartridge jammed in my rifle, and  could not pull it out or knock it in, although I nearly ruined my  fingers in my attempt to do so. Of course, this was the biggest bull of  all, and I had the supreme satisfaction of seeing him deliberately walk  out of my sight into the woods, and he was lost to me forever. His horns  were much larger than those which I got. Up to that time I had no idea  that I had killed any except the last moose that I shot at, but thought  that perhaps I had wounded one or two of the others, feeling that I  would be very lucky if I should ever come up with them.    Going down to the place where the moose had disappeared, after I had got  my rifle fixed--that is, had extracted the cartridge and put in  another--I found one of the moose dead; another, a big one, on his  knees, and the third a short distance away, looking very dejected and  uncomfortable. I did not know then that the largest bull of all had  stopped on the other side of a little thicket; and when I commenced to  give the finishing touches to the wounded moose in sight, he,  accompanied by another wounded one, got away. As I shot the big one on  his knees, I was surprised by a noise, and upon turning around found the  dejected looking small bull coming full drive toward me. I had only time  to turn around and shoot him in the breast before he was on me. I do not  think that he intended to charge; his coming toward me was probably  entirely accidental. Still it had the effect of sending my heart in my  mouth. I then started out after the wounded one, but when I saw that he  was not bleeding much concluded that, as it was growing late, and I was  seven or eight miles from camp, I would not have more than time to cover  up the three moose with snow so that I could skin them the next morning.  Before doing so, however, I sat down on top of my biggest moose, and, as  these were the first moose that I had ever seen, I surveyed them with a  great deal of satisfaction.    About this time Phillips, who had been attracted by the shooting,  appeared in the distance, and I hailed him by a shot, when he came to  me. We then carefully covered up the moose with snow and pulled out for  camp. When we arrived there and told our story, a more disconsolate  looking Indian you could not have found in the whole region, and he  doubtless came to the conclusion that his sweeping assertion as to the  inability of a white man to kill a moose in that country was perhaps a  little too broad.    Our luck seemed to turn from this time and we got several very good  moose, but unfortunately no other large heads. After telling this story  I do not wish to go upon record as a game slaughterer, for those who  know anything of my hunting know that I am strongly opposed to anything  of the kind. We usually have killed only enough game for meat in camp,  but at this time we had to feed beside ourselves ten dogs. Moreover, I  have never thought that the killing of bulls made very much difference  in the amount of the game, although in shooting them we have usually  made it a rule to kill only such heads as we wished to take home. I  should add, moreover, that all the meat that we did not use of the  moose that we killed in this country was distributed among some Indians  whom we met on our return, and who, hearing of our luck, followed our  dog trail to the hunting grounds after our departure.    Having had enough moose hunting, and anxious to kill caribou, we  concluded to cross Lake Winnipeg, which by this time--early in  December--was frozen hard with nearly six feet of ice, the cracking of  which, especially at night, produces a very curious and  never-to-be-forgotten sound, which can be heard for miles. We soon  reached the lake, but were detained a day or two waiting for a favorable  day to cross--that is to say, one when the wind did not blow, as when it  does the exposure in crossing on the ice is terrific. After finally  venturing upon the ice, we made some forty or fifty miles the first day,  and reached the edge of an island, in the middle of which there were a  few houses occupied principally by Icelandic immigrants. These earn a  precarious livelihood by fishing for whitefish and jackfish principally  in the summer. They keep up this fishing all through the winter,  however, to supply their own needs, by setting their nets underneath  the ice, employing a very simple method, which, if De Long and his party  had known and provided for, they would never have perished so miserably  in the Lena delta. Here we were witnesses to the fact which entitles us  to claim that the common domestic cow is not, strictly speaking,  properly to be classed among the _herbivora_. We distinctly saw a very  ordinary looking cow devour with evident relish, while she was being  milked, a large jackfish, which had been taken from a frozen pile  stacked up outside of the house and thawed for her evening meal.    These Icelanders live as a rule in a primitive but very comfortable way.  They are much more neat and cleanly than many of the immigrants who come  to the United States, and it is a pity that we do not have them in this  country, for they seem to be very industrious and would make good  citizens. However, it is probable that they were in search of cold  weather, and would not be happy unless they had it. If this is the case,  they most certainly have chosen the best spot on this continent which is  at all accessible; for the region around Lake Winnipeg is, I am told,  one of the coldest places where any reliable record of the temperature  is kept. During our trip, and especially while we were on the east side  of the lake, the temperatures recorded were very low, often 45 degrees  below zero. In fact, during our absence there was a record of 50 degrees  below zero at Selkirk and Winnipeg; and, as we were over a hundred miles  to the north, it is not unreasonable to suppose that the temperature was  quite as low, if not lower, with us. It must not be forgotten, however,  that, except for the cracking of the frozen trees, it is deathly still  and quiet in these regions when the temperature drops to 10 degrees  below zero. Indeed, when the temperature is below that point, it is  usually much more comfortable for one who is out in such weather than a  temperature of zero, or even 20 degrees above, with a heavy wind. Under  these conditions, however, an ordinary man when out hunting cannot  occasionally sit down on a log and smoke his pipe, for any length of  time, with a great amount of pleasure. Like the persecuted boy in the  play, although there are no policemen about, he is compelled, and indeed  is usually perfectly willing, to keep \"movin' on.\"    After leaving Big Island, as I remember the name, we made our way  across to the mouth of the Bad Throat River, where there was an old  lumber camp, which a great many years ago was the scene of an important  conflict between the Hudson Bay Company's men and the men of the  Northwest Fur Company, in which quite a number were killed. Here we got  another team of dogs, and picked up another member for our party in the  person of an Englishman, who by choice had drifted into this country and  lived there, marrying an Indian squaw shortly after our return.  Unfortunately, the good old-fashioned plan of performing the marriage  ceremony by running together under a blanket had been abolished, so he  had to wait until the yearly visit of the priest. This marrying of  squaws is of course common among the white men of this region.    As we had only a few things to get before starting out for the famous  caribou country between the head waters of the Hole, the Askandoga and  the Blood Vein rivers, we were not delayed long at this place. The snow  was now quite heavy, at least enough so for comfortable snowshoe  traveling, and we made rapid time after leaving the Bad Throat River. In  this connection it is to be remarked that comparatively little snow  falls in this region. This seems singular, and I do not know the  meteorological explanation of the fact. There is certainly very much  less, for instance, than in Minnesota, hundreds of miles to the south.  The snow, however, is usually a dry powder all through winter, and very  rarely becomes crusted.    In traveling over broken timbered country with dog-sleds, very much the  same routes are followed that one takes with "]]]
