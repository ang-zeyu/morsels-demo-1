Of course nothing  else was talked of except our disappointment at our new run; and  although Mr. Johnson had indulged in forebodings, which were only too  literally fulfilled, he had the good taste never to remind us of his  prophecies.              \"Of all the forms of human woe,            Defend me from that dread, 'I told you so.'\"    After a day's halt and rest we mounted our much refreshed horses, and  set our faces straight across country for Dunedin. This is very easy to  write, but it was not quite so easy to do. We could only ride for the  first fifty-two miles, which we accomplished in two days. These stages  brought us to the foot of the Dunstan Range, and near the gold-diggings  of that name. I would fain have turned aside to see them, but we had not  time. However, we felt the auriferous influence of the locality; for a  perfect stranger came up to us, whilst we were baiting at another place,  called the Kaiwarara diggings, and offered to buy our horses from us for  30 pounds each, and also to purchase our saddles and bridles at a fair  price. This was exactly what we wanted, as we had intended to sell them  at Dunedin; and I was no ways disinclined to part with the Hermit; who  retained the sulky, misanthropical temper which had earned him his name.  He was now pronounced \"fit to carry a lady,\" and purchased to be sold  again at the diggings. Whether there were any ladies there or not I  cannot tell. Of course, before parting with our nags we ascertained that  the ubiquitous \"Cobb's coach\" started from our resting place for Dunedin  next day, and we made the rest of our journey in one of that well-known  line. Its leathern springs, whilst not so liable to break by sudden  jolts, impart a swinging rocking motion to the body of the vehicle,  which is most disagreeable; but rough and rude as they are, they deserve  to be looked upon with respect as the pioneers of civilization. All  over America, Australia, and now New Zealand, the moment half-a-dozen  passengers are forthcoming, that moment the enterprising firm starts  a coach, and the vehicle runs until it is ousted by a railway. All  previous tracks which I had journeyed over seemed smooth turnpike roads,  compared to that terrible tussocky track which led to Dunedin.    But that bright little town was reached at last, the hotel welcomed us,  tired and bruised travellers that we were, and next evening we started  in the _Geelong_ for Port Lyttleton. This little coasting steamer seemed  to touch at every hamlet along the coast, and after each pause I had  to begin afresh my agonies of sea-sickness. There was no such thing  as getting one's sea-legs; for we were seldom more than a few hours  outside, and had no chance of getting used to the horrible motion.  Timaru was reached next day, but we had suffered so frightfully during  the night from a chopping sea and an open roadstead, that we went on  shore, and entrusted ourselves once more to the old coach. It seemed  better to endure the miseries we knew of, than to make experiments in  wretchedness. So we went through the old jolting and jumbling until we  were dropped at an accommodation house, fifteen miles from Christchurch,  where we slept that night, and at daylight despatched a messenger to the  next station for our own horses. He had only thirty-five miles to ride,  and about mid-day we started to meet him on hired horses, which we were  very glad to exchange for better nags a stage further on.    And so we rode quietly home in the gloaming, winding up the lovely,  tranquil valley, at whose head stood our own snug little homestead. At  first we were so glad to be safely at hone again that we scarcely gave  a thought to our fruitless enterprise; but as our bruised bodies became  rested and restored, our hearts began to ache when we thought of the  money we had so rashly flung away in BUYING A RUN.        Chapter VIII: Looking for a congregation.      It is to be hoped and expected that such a good understanding has been  established between my readers and myself by this time, that they will  not find the general title of these papers unsuitable to the heading  of this particular chapter. Indeed, I may truly say, that, looking back  upon the many happy memories of my three years life in that lovely  and beloved Middle Island, no pleasures stand out more vividly than my  evening rides up winding gullies or across low hill-ranges in search of  a shepherd's hut, or a _cockatoo's_ nest. A peculiar brightness seems to  rest on those sun-lit peaks of memory's landscape; and it is but fitting  that it should be so, for other excursions or expeditions used to  be undertaken merely for business or pleasure, but these delicious  wanderings were in search of scattered dwellings whose lonely  inhabitants--far removed from Church privileges for many a long  year past--might be bidden, nay, entreated, to come to us on Sunday  afternoons, and attend the Service we held at home weekly.    And here I feel constrained to say a word to those whose eyes may haply  rest on my pages, and who may find themselves in the coming years in  perhaps the same position as I did a short time ago. A new comer to a  new country is sure to be discouraged if he or she (particularly _she_,  I fancy) should attempt to revive or introduce any custom which has  been neglected or overlooked. This is especially the case with religious  observances. At every turn one is met by disheartening warnings. \"Oh,  the people here are very different to those in the old country; they  would look upon it as impertinence if you suggested they should come to  church.\" \"You will find a few may come just at first, and then when  the novelty wears off and they have seen all the pretty things in your  drawing room, not a soul will ever come near the place.\"    \"If even the men don't say something very free and easy to you when you  invite them to your house on Sunday afternoons, you may depend upon  it that after two or three weeks you will not know how to keep them in  order.\"    Such, and many more, were the discouraging remarks made when I consulted  my neighbours about my plan for collecting the shepherds from the  surrounding runs, and holding a Church of England Service every Sunday  afternoon at our own little homestead. To my mind, the distances seemed  the greatest obstacle, as many of the men I wanted to reach lived  twenty-five or even thirty miles away, with very rough country between.  I had no fear of impertinence, for it is unknown to me, and seldom  comes, I fancy, unprovoked; whilst with regard to the novelty wearing  off and the men ceasing to attend, that must be left in God's hands. We  could only endeavour to plant the good seed, and trust to Him to give  the increase. It was a great comfort to me in those early days that  F----, who had been many years in the colony, never joined in the  disheartening prophecies I have alluded to. Although as naturally averse  to reading aloud before strangers as a man who had lived a solitary life  would be sure to be, he promised at once, with a good grace, to read  the Evening Service and a sermon afterwards, and thus smoothed one  difficulty over directly. His advice to me was precisely what I would  fain repeat: \"Try, by all means: if you fail you will at least feel you  have made the attempt.\" May all who try succeed, as we did! I believe  firmly they will, for it is an undertaking on which God's blessing is  sure to rest, and there are no such fertilizing dews as those which fall  from heaven. The mists arising from earth are only miasmic vapours after  all!    But I fear to linger too long on the end, instead of telling you about  the means.    It was May when we were fairly settled in our new home at the head of a  hill-encircled valley. With us that month answers to your November, but  fogs are unknown in that breezy Middle Island, and my first winter in  Canterbury was a beautiful season, heralded in by an exquisite autumn.  How crisp the mornings and evenings were, with ever so light a film  of hoar frost, making a splendid sparkle on every blade of waving  tussock-grass! Then in the middle of the day the delicious warmth of the  sun tempted one to linger all day in the open air, and I never wearied  of gazing at the strange purple shadows cast by a passing cloud; or up,  beyond the floating vapourous wreath, to the heaven of brilliant blue  which smiled upon us. And yet, when I come to think of it, I don't know  that I had much time to spare for glancing at either hills or skies, for  we were just settling ourselves in a new place, and no one knows what  _that_ means unless they have tried it, fifty miles away from the  nearest shop. The yeast alone was a perpetual anxiety to me,--it would  not keep beyond a certain time, and had a tendency to explode its  confining bottles in the middle of the night, so it became necessary to  make it in smaller quantities every ten days or so. If by any chance  I forgot to remind my scatter-brained damsels to replenish the yeast  bottles, they used up the last drop, and then would come smilingly to me  with the remark, \"There aint not a drop o' yeast, about, anywhere, mum.\"  This entailed flap-jacks, or scones, or soda bread, or some indigestible  compound for at least three days, as it was of no use attempting to  make proper bread until the yeast had worked. Then the well needed to  be deepened, a kitchen garden had to be made, shelter to be provided  for the fowls and pigs; a shed to be put up for coals; a thousand things  which entailed thought and trouble, had to be done.    It is true these rough jobs were not exactly in my line, but indoors I  was just as busy trying to make big things fit into little spaces and  _vice versa_. We could not afford to take things coolly and do a little  every day, for at that time of year an "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5994"],[0,"Our Nervous Friends — Illustrating the Mastery of Nervousness (#16)"],[1,"summer of happiness which was to golden the autumn of a bleak life  made blest. Then Hattie Gilmore learned to play a score of out-of-door  games and to understand sports. She learned to see the beauties in the  roadside flowers-\"weeds\" her mother had called most of them. She  learned to read glorious stories in the ever-transforming clouds. The  neighbors' children were invited, timidly they came at first, later  they were eager to come and play at \"Aunt Hattie's.\" Three fine,  determining events happened that fall to complete the salvation of  this woman who was so fast learning happiness-living.    They, Jane and Hattie, friends now rather than nurse and patient, made  the daintiest possible cap and cloak for Dr. Ben's last baby, and sent  it with a hearty, merry greeting. This was a peace-offering to the  past, more efficient probably than much blood which has been shed on  sacrificial altars. Then they made a trip which came near being a  solemn occasion, it was so portentously important. They went to the  church-orphanage, remained several days and brought home a lusty  three-year-old bunch of mischief, who was forever to wreck all the  gloom-sanctity of that old home. Hereafter even the parlor of mourning  was to be assailed with shouts of glee; some things planted in  Hattie's flower beds were foredoomed not to come up; no longer could  the front lawn look like a freshly swept carpet. Roy was legally  adopted by Hattie and became her proudest possession. Finally, her  eyes were opened to that rarely sighted, fair vista of the sacred  play-life, the play-life so long denied this good woman. Never again  were housekeeping worries to be mentioned. They were not recognized.  When things went wrong, they went merrily wrong. What could not be  cured was joked about. The whole business of home-making became a  gladsome game.    Life for Hattie Gilmore, for Roy, for the neighbors' children, and for  some of the mothers of dull old Coopersville came to be lived as the  Father intended His children to live, when one almost old woman found  the Fountain of Youth revealed by the fine art of play. A blessed  revelation it is to every life when the joy of play robs the working  hours of their tedium and weariness. He lives as master who makes play  of his work.          CHAPTER XI    THE TANGLED SKEIN      Warm balls of comfort, a thousand sheep feed on the hillside, turning  herb and green growing things into food and wool. After the shearing  and the washing, ten thousand soft strands are spun into a single  thread, and each length of thread is a promise of warmth and  protection for years to come. Then the wool-white yarn is dyed in  colors symbolizing the strength of the navy, the loyalty of the army  or the honor of the alma mater. Reeled into a skein, the wool is now  all but ready for the fingers of the knitter; it has but to be wound  in a ball. Yet here danger lurks. An inadvertent twist or a simple  tangle quickly knots the thread, unless thoughtful patience rescues.  Recklessness means hopeless disarray, and the soft fluff of warming  color becomes unkempt disorder, a confused mass from which the thread  broken again and again is extracted. The work of careful hands has  been reduced to lasting defect.    Francis Weston was reared in one of the prosperous, middle-Western  cities, on the northern bank of the Ohio. The family had succeeded  well and represented large manufacturing interests. All burdens which  money could lift were removed, from his shoulders. He finished college  in the East and entered business, never having felt a hand's weight of  responsibility. As vice-president and director in one of the banks  organized largely by the family's capital, he was free to follow his  impulses. No details demanded his attention; other minds in the bank  cared for these.    Across the river a southern town nestled in cozy comfort, having for  generations maintained a conscious superiority to its smoking,  northern neighbor. Several handsome daughters of Kentucky aristocracy  gave tangible evidence of the tone of the community, and Francis  Weston's impulses made his trips across the river increasingly  frequent. And, as it should have been, North and South were joined  closer by one more golden link, when an only daughter of Kentucky  wealth became Mrs. Weston. The marriage contract held but one  stipulation: their home was to be in the bride's village. It looked as  though one of Love's best plans had succeeded. The husband proved  deeply devoted to his wife and the new home. The bank continued to  take most excellent care of itself, and his trips north, across the  river, were but occasional. The Weston mansion and estate in every way  befitted the combined wealth of the two families, and the wife gave  much time to making it increasingly attractive, and to the training of  her good servants. The husband read much, exercised little, and the  only reason for gentle protest from the wife was his excessive  smoking.    A little daughter came, but as though Fate would say, \"I am Master,\"  she lived but a few days. The shock was cruel, and the father seemed  to suffer the more intensely. Mrs. Weston took her sorrow in a fine  way; she seemed to realize that she, of the two, must turn away the  threat of morbidness. But the touch of Fate was not to be denied.  Still, three years later, it would seem that nothing but thankfulness  and abounding joy should have filled the Weston home--a son came. They  named him Harold. The father's solicitude for the little fellow's life  was as pathetic as it was abnormal. The bank was now unvisited for  months by its first vice-president. As the boy grew the father gave  him more and more of himself. He was his companion in play, and  personally taught him, seriously taking up study after study, until at  sixteen Harold was well prepared for college--scholastically prepared,  we should amend--for unconsciously the father had kept him from the  normal comradeship with boys of his age. Much of excellent theory the  youth had, some wisdom beyond his years, but no knowledge of denials,  no spirit of give and take, no thought of the other fellow--his rights  and wrongs. In spite of their long walks and rides on gaited Kentucky  thoroughbreds, Harold was not physically robust, so it was decided to  send him to a southern college, and he went to Vanderbilt. During his  second year the father had a long siege of typhoid, and recovery was  pitiably imperfect. His mentality did not return with his body  strength--he remained a harmless, weak-minded man. Much care was  exercised to keep the details from Harold, though both families were  unwilling to have the broken man sent to an institution, and for four  years professional nurses attended him at home. In spite of the  mother's best efforts to distract and neutralize, the son could but  feel the unnaturalness of the home atmosphere and profoundly miss the  devotion of his father. Still from what little he did see of the  invalid, it was a relief when, four years later, an accident took him  away.    Harold Weston's college life held true to his training. Quietly  friendly, he mixed poorly; mentally well-equipped, he was an excellent  student--brilliant in some classes, good in all. Athletics and  fraternities, feeds and \"femmies\" dissipated none of his energies, nor  added aught to the fulness of his living. He continued his college  work until he had received both Bachelor's and Master's degrees. The  spring he was twenty-three, he returned home for the summer, an  attractive young man. A classmate had interested him in tennis, for  which he showed some natural aptitude. The year's work had taxed him  lightly. The skein of yarn gave promise of a perfect fabric.    Mother and son had a happy summer. She saw to it that the home was  alive with young folks, and one week-end party followed another.  Harold had decided to study law, and nothing indicated that he would  meet any obstacles during his course at Law School. All believed he  was sufficiently strong to take this at Yale. There were brilliant  minds in his classes--he was accustomed to lead. He dropped his  tennis, he studied hard. In his second year he began losing weight  after the holidays, and found difficulty in getting to sleep; his  appetite became irregular, and his smoking, which had been moderate  for some years, became a dependence. His nervous system was pretty  well \"shot up\"--it had never been case-hardened. A weight of  apprehension had become constantly present, and he let its burden  depress him miserably. One of his professors, noting his appearance,  talked with him earnestly, and with lay acumen decided his digestion  was \"out of fix\" and told him of a \"fine New York doctor.\" The stomach  specialist worthily stood high in his profession. The examination was  painstaking and exhaustive; the diagnosis seemed ominous to the morbid  patient; the whole process was a revelation to him of organs and  functions and laws of eating and drinking unheard in his years of  study. \"Chronic intestinal indigestion with food decomposition and  auto-intoxication, augmented by nicotine,\" the doctor said. There had  been a distinct lessening of efficiency in his law-school work. Study  for the first time in his life required wearying effort. He did not  feel himself, he was facing his first test, he was meeting his first  strain. For the first time the skein was being mussed.    Harold Weston began reading, indiscriminately, literature on food and  digestion and diets. The doctor had given him a strict regimen. He  began to note minutely the foods he ordered and to question the  wholesomeness of their quality and preparation. Caution and over  emphasis on details of food and habits of eating rapidly developed.  Later not only the food in the dish, but most unhappily the foods he  had swallowed were scrutinized by every alertness of sensation and  imagination, and most"]]]
