[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6980"],[0,"Tales of St. Austin's (#16)"],[1," appearance'. There was a larger crowd than Charteris had expected. He  made his way through them, resisting without difficulty the entreaties  of a hoarse gentleman in a check suit to have three to two on 'Enery  something for the hundred yards, and came at last to the dressing-tent.    At this point it occurred to him that it would be judicious to find out  when his race was to start. It was rather a chilly day, and the less  time he spent in the undress uniform of shorts the better. He bought a  correct card for twopence, and scanned it. The strangers' mile was down  for four-fifty. There was no need to change for an hour yet. He wished  the authorities could have managed to date the event earlier.    Four-fifty was running it rather fine. The race would be over by about  five to five, and it was a walk of some ten minutes to the station,  less if he hurried. That would give him ten minutes for recovering from  the effects of the race, and changing back into his ordinary clothes  again. It would be quick work. But, having come so far, he was not  inclined to go back without running in the race. He would never be able  to hold his head up again if he did that. He left the dressing-tent,  and started on a tour of the field.    The scene was quite different from anything he had ever witnessed  before in the way of sports. The sports at St Austin's were decorous to  a degree. These leaned more to the rollickingly convivial. It was like  an ordinary race-meeting, except that men were running instead of  horses. Rutton was a quiet little place for the majority of the year,  but it woke up on this day, and was evidently out to enjoy itself. The  Rural Hooligan was a good deal in evidence, and though he was  comparatively quiet just at present, the frequency with which he  visited the various refreshment stalls that dotted the ground gave  promise of livelier times in the future. Charteris felt that the  afternoon would not be dull.    The hour soon passed, and Charteris, having first seen the Oldest  Inhabitant's nevvy romp home in the egg and spoon event, took himself  off to the dressing-tent, and began to get into his running clothes.  The bell for his race was just ringing when he left the tent. He  trotted over to the starting place.    Apparently there was not a very large 'field'. Two weedy-looking youths  of about Charteris's age, dressed in blushing pink, put in an  appearance, and a very tall, thin man came up almost immediately  afterwards. Charteris had just removed his coat, and was about to get  to his place on the line, when another competitor arrived, and, to  judge by the applause that greeted his appearance, he was evidently a  favourite in the locality. It was with shock that Charteris recognized  his old acquaintance, the Bargees' secretary.    He was clad in running clothes of a bright orange and a smile of  conscious superiority, and when somebody in the crowd called out 'Go  it, Jarge!' he accepted the tribute as his due, and waved a  condescending hand in the speaker's direction.    Some moments elapsed before he recognized Charteris, and the latter had  time to decide upon his line of action. If he attempted concealment in  any way, the man would recognize that on this occasion, at any rate, he  had, to use an adequate if unclassical expression, got the bulge, and  then there would be trouble. By brazening things out, however, there  was just a chance that he might make him imagine that there was more in  the matter than met the eye, and that, in some mysterious way, he had  actually obtained leave to visit Rutton that day. After all, the man  didn't know very much about School rules, and the recollection of the  recent fiasco in which he had taken part would make him think twice  about playing the amateur policeman again, especially in connection  with Charteris.    So he smiled genially, and expressed a hope that the man enjoyed robust  health.    The man replied by glaring in a simple and unaffected manner.    'Looked up the Headmaster lately?' asked Charteris.    'What are you doing here?'    'I'm going to run. Hope you don't mind.'    'You're out of bounds.'    'That's what you said before. You'd better enquire a bit before you  make rash statements. Otherwise, there's no knowing what may happen.  Perhaps Mr Dacre has given me leave.'    The man said something objurgatory under his breath, but forbore to  continue the discussion. He was wondering, as Charteris had expected  that he would, whether the latter had really got leave or not. It was a  difficult problem.    Whether such a result was due to his mental struggles, or whether it  was simply to be attributed to his poor running, is open to question,  but the fact remains that the secretary of the Old Crockfordians did  not shine in the strangers' mile. He came in last but one, vanquishing  the pink sportsman by a foot. Charteris, after a hot finish, was beaten  on the tape by one of the weedy youths, who exhibited astounding  sprinting powers in the last two hundred yards, overhauling Charteris,  who had led all the time, in fine style, and scoring what the  _Stapleton Herald_ described as a 'highly popular victory'.    As soon as he had recovered his normal stock of wind--which was not  immediately--it was borne in upon Charteris that if he wanted to catch  the five-fifteen back to Stapleton, he had better be beginning to  change. He went to the dressing-tent, and on examining his watch was  horrified to find that he had just ten minutes in which to do  everything, and the walk to the station, he reflected, was a long five  minutes. He literally hurled himself into his clothes, and,  disregarding the Bargee, who had entered the tent and seemed to wish to  continue the discussion at the point where they had left off, shot off  towards the gate nearest the station. He had exactly four minutes and  twenty-five seconds in which to complete the journey, and he had just  run a mile.        _Chapter 5_    Fortunately the road was mainly level. On the other hand, he was  hampered by an overcoat. After the first hundred yards he took this  off, and carried it in an unwieldy parcel. This, he found, answered  admirably. Running became easier. He had worked the stiffness out of  his legs by this time, and was going well. Three hundred yards from the  station it was anybody's race. The exact position of the other  competitor, the train, could not be defined. It was at any rate not yet  within earshot, which meant that it still had at least a quarter of a  mile to go. Charteris considered that he had earned a rest. He slowed  down to a walk, but after proceeding at this pace for a few yards,  thought that he heard a distant whistle, and dashed on again. Suddenly  a raucous bellow of laughter greeted his ears from a spot in front of  him, hidden from his sight by a bend in the road.    'Somebody slightly tight,' thought Charteris, rapidly diagnosing the  case. 'By Jove, if he comes rotting about with me I'll kill him.'  Having to do anything in a desperate hurry always made Charteris's  temper slightly villainous. He turned the corner at a sharp trot, and  came upon two youths who seemed to be engaged in the harmless  occupation of trying to ride a bicycle. They were of the type which he  held in especial aversion, the Rural Hooligan type, and one at least of  the two had evidently been present at a recent circulation of the  festive bowl. He was wheeling the bicycle about the road in an aimless  manner, and looked as if he wondered what was the matter with it that  it would not stay in the same place for two consecutive seconds. The  other youth was apparently of the 'Charles-his-friend' variety, content  to look on and applaud, and generally to play chorus to his companion's  'lead'. He was standing at the side of the road, smiling broadly in a  way that argued feebleness of mind. Charteris was not quite sure which  of the two types he loathed the more. He was inclined to call it a tie.    However, there seemed to be nothing particularly lawless in what they  were doing now. If they were content to let him pass without hindrance,  he, for his part, was content generously to overlook the insult they  offered him in daring to exist, and to maintain a state of truce. But,  as he drew nearer, he saw that there was more in this business than the  casual spectator might at first have supposed. A second and keener  inspection of the reptiles revealed fresh phenomena. In the first  place, the bicycle which Hooligan number one was playing with was a  lady's bicycle, and a small one at that. Now, up to the age of fourteen  and the weight of ten stone, a beginner at cycling often finds it more  convenient to learn to ride on a lady's machine than on a gentleman's.  The former offers greater facilities for rapid dismounting, a quality  not to be despised in the earlier stages of initiation. But, though  this is undoubtedly the case, and though Charteris knew that it was so,  yet he felt instinctively that there was something wrong here.  Hooligans of twenty years and twelve stone do not learn to ride on  small ladies' machines, or, if they do, it is probably without the  permission of the small lady who owns the same. Valuable as his time  was, Charteris felt that it behoved him to spend a thoughtful minute or  so examining into this affair. He slowed down once again to a walk,  and, as he did so, his eye fell upon the character in the drama whose  absence had puzzled him, the owner of the bicycle. And from that moment  he felt that life would be a hollow mockery if he failed to fall upon  those revellers and slay them. She stood by the hedge on the right, a  forlorn little figure in grey, and she gazed sadly and helplessly at  the manoeuvres that were going on in the middle of the road. Her age  Charteris put down at a venture at twelve--a correct guess. Her state  of mind he also conjectured. She was letting 'I dare not' wait upon 'I  would', like"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6984"],[0,"The Pothunters (#16)"],[1,"pound on account. It's a beastly business. Do you  think your pater will give you your money all the same as it was such a  close finish?'    Jim thought not. In fact, he was certain that he would not, and Tony  relapsed into silence as he tried to bring another idea to the surface.  He had not succeeded when Charteris came in.    'Jim,' he said 'you have my sympathy. It was an awfully near thing. But  I've got something more solid than sympathy. I will take a seat.'    'Don't rag, Charteris,' said Tony. 'It's much too serious.'    'Who's ragging, you rotter? I say I have something more solid than  sympathy, and instead of giving me an opening, as a decent individual  would, by saying, \"What?\" you accuse me of ragging. James, my son, if  you will postpone your suicide for two minutes, I will a tale unfold. I  have an idea.'    'Well?'    'That's more like it. Now you _are_ talking. We will start at the  beginning. First, you want a pound. So do I. Secondly, you want it  before next Tuesday. Thirdly, you haven't it on you. How, therefore,  are you to get it? As the song hath it, you don't know, they don't  know, but--now we come to the point--I _do_ know.'    'Yes?' said Jim and Tony together.    'It is a luminous idea. Why shouldn't we publish a special number of  _The Glow Worm_ before the end of term?'    Jim was silent at the brilliance of the scheme. Then doubts began to  harass him.    'Is there time?'    'Time? Yards of it. This is Saturday. We start tonight, and keep at it  all night, if necessary. We ought to manage it easily before tomorrow  morning. On Sunday we jellygraph it--it'll have to be a jellygraphed  number this time. On Monday and Tuesday we sell it, and there you are.'    'How are you going to sell it? In the ordinary way at the shop?'    'Yes, I've arranged all that. All we've got to do is to write the  thing. As the penalty for your sins you shall take on most of it. I'll  do the editorial, Welch is pegging away at the Sports account now, and  I waylaid Jackson just before lock-up, and induced him by awful threats  to knock off some verses. So we're practically published already.'    'It's grand,' said Jim. 'And it's awfully decent of you chaps to fag  yourselves like this for me. I'll start on something now.'    'But can you raise a sovereign on one number?' asked Tony.    'Either that, or I've arranged with the shop to give us a quid down,  and take all profits on this and the next number. They're as keen as  anything on the taking-all-profits idea, but I've kept that back to be  used only in case of necessity. But the point is that Jim gets his  sovereign in any case. I must be off to my editorial. So long,' and he  went.    'Grand man, Charteris,' said Tony, as he leant back in his chair in  search of a subject. 'You'd better weigh in with an account of the  burglary. It's a pity you can't give the realistic description you gave  us. It would sell like anything.'    'Wouldn't do to risk it.'    At that moment the door swung violently open, with Merevale holding on  to the handle, and following it in its course. Merevale very rarely  knocked at a study door, a peculiarity of his which went far towards  shattering the nervous systems of the various inmates, who never knew  when it was safe to stop work and read fiction. 'Ah, Thomson,' he said,  'I was looking for you. The Headmaster wants to see you over at his  House, if you are feeling well enough after your exertions. _Very_  close thing, that mile. I don't know when I have seen a better-run race  on the College grounds. I suppose you are feeling pretty tired, eh?'    'I am rather, sir, but I had better see the Head. Will he be in his  study, sir?'    'Yes, I think so.'    Jim took his cap and went off, while Merevale settled down to spend the  evening in Tony's study, as he often did when the term's work was over,  and it was no longer necessary to keep up the pretence of preparation.    Parker, the Head's butler, conducted Jim into the presence.    'Sit down, Thomson,' said the Head.    Jim took a seat, and he had just time to notice that his namesake, Mr  Thompson, was also present, and that, in spite of the fact that his tie  had crept up to the top of his collar, he was looking quite  unnecessarily satisfied with himself, when he became aware that the  Head was speaking to him.    'I hope you are not feeling any bad effects from your race, Thomson?'    Jim was half inclined to say that his effects were _nil,_ but he  felt that the quip was too subtle, and would be lost on his present  audience, so he merely said that he was not. There was a rather awkward  silence for a minute. Then the Head coughed, and said:    'Thomson.'    'Yes, sir.'    'I think it would be fairest to you to come to the point at once, and  to tell you the reason why I wished to see you.'    Jim ran over the sins which shot up in his mind like rockets as he  heard these ominous words, and he knew that this must be the matter of  the Pavilion. He was, therefore, in a measure prepared for the Head's  next words.    'Thomson.'    'Yessir.'    'A very serious charge has been brought against you. You are accused of  nothing less than this unfortunate burglary of the prizes for the  Sports.'    'Yes, sir. Is my accuser Mr Thompson?'    The Headmaster hesitated for a moment, and Mr Thompson spoke. 'That is  so,' he said.    'Yes,' said the Head, 'the accusation is brought by Mr Thompson.'    'Yes, sir,' said Jim again, and this time the observation was intended  to convey the meaning, 'My dear, good sir, when you've known him as  long as I have, you won't mind what Mr Thompson says or does. It's a  kind of way he's got, and if he's not under treatment for it, he ought  to be.'    'I should like to hear from your own lips that the charge is  groundless.'    'Anything to oblige,' thought Jim. Then aloud, 'Yes, sir.'    'You say it is groundless?' This from Mr Thompson.    'Yes, sir.'    'I must warn you, Thomson, that the evidence against you is very strong  indeed,' said the Head. 'Without suggesting that you are guilty of this  thing, I think I ought to tell you that if you have any confession to  make, it will be greatly, very greatly, to your own advantage to make  it at once.'    'And give myself away, free, gratis and for nothing,' thought Jim. 'Not  for me, thank you.'    'Might I hear Mr Thompson's evidence, sir?' he asked.    'Certainly, Thomson.' He effected a movement in Mr Thompson's  direction, midway between a bow and a nod.    Mr Thompson coughed. Jim coughed, too, in the same key. This put Mr  Thompson out, and he had to cough again.    'In the first place,' he began, 'it has been conclusively proved that  the burglary was the work of an unskilful hand.'    'That certainly seems to point to me as the author,' said Jim  flippantly.    'Silence, Thomson,' said the Head, and counsel for the prosecution  resumed.    'In the second place, it has been proved that you were at the time of  the burglary in great need of money.'    This woke Jim up. It destroyed that feeling of coolness with which he  had started the interview. Awful thoughts flashed across his mind. Had  he been seen at the time of his burglarious entry? At any rate, how did  Mr Thompson come to know of his pecuniary troubles?    'Did you say it had been proved, sir?'    'Yes.'    'How, sir?'    He felt the question was a mistake as he was uttering it. Your really  injured innocent would have called all the elements to witness that he  was a millionaire. But it was too late to try that now. And, besides,  he really did want to know how Mr Thompson had got to hear of this  skeleton in his cupboard.    The Headmaster interrupted hurriedly. 'It is a very unfortunate affair  altogether, and this is quite the most unfortunate part. A letter came  to the College addressed to J. Thomson, and Mr Thompson opened and read  it inadvertently. Quite inadvertently.'    'Yes, sir,' said Jim, in a tone which implied, 'I am no George  Washington myself, but when you say he read it inadvertently, well--'    'This letter was signed \"Allen\"--'    'My brother, sir.'    'Exactly. And it asked for two pounds. Evidently in payment of a debt,  and the tone of the letter certainly seemed to show that you were not  then in possession of the money.'    'Could I have the letter, sir?' Then with respectful venom to Mr  Thompson: 'If you have finished with it.' The letter was handed over,  and pocketed, and Jim braced his moral pecker up for the next round of  the contest.    'I take it, then, Thomson,' resumed the Head, 'that you owe your  brother this money?'    'Yes, sir.'    'Two pounds is a great deal of money for one boy to lend another.'    'It was not lent, sir. It was a bet.'    'A bet!' in a nasty tone from the Head.    'A bet!' in a sepulchral echo from Mr Thompson.    There was a long pause.    'At any other time,' said the Head, 'I should feel it my duty to take  serious notice of this, but beside this other matter with which you are  charged, it becomes trivial. I can only repeat that the circumstances  are exceedingly suspicious, and I think it would be in your interests  to tell us all you know without further delay.'    'You take it for granted I am guilty, sir,' began Jim hotly.    'I say that the circumstances seems to point to it. In the first place,  you were in need of money. You admit that?'    'Yes, sir.'    'In the second place,' said the Head slowly, 'in the second place, I am  told that you were nowhere to be found in the House at half-past eight  on the night of the burglary, when you ought certainly to have been in  your study at your work.'    Bombshell number two, and a worse one than the first. For the moment  Jim's head swam. If he had been asked just then in so many words where  he had been at that time, it is likely that he would have admitted  everything. By some miracle the Head did not press his point.    'You may go now, Thomson,' he said. 'I should like to see you after  morning"]]]
