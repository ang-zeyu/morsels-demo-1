In  individuals that are not black, the ventral reddish color covers the  shoulders and in some it extends between the shoulders to the median  dorsal area.    Among females collected from December through May, only one, taken 43  kilometers south of Ciudad Victoria on March 17, was pregnant (one  embryo).    The weight of seven adult males from Soto la Marina and the Sierra de  Tamaulipas averaged 492.5 (400-575) grams.

Michigan, 544:4, March 25.         _Distribution in Tamaulipas._--Tropical forest in southern       part of state, north to Rancho Santa Rosa and Padilla.    In Tamaulipas this squirrel is called \"ardilla chica\" or \"ardilla  barcina,\" and is abundant in areas where tall trees and dense brush  prevail. This species evidently does not have restricted periods of  activity, as does _S. aureogaster_, but is active throughout the day.  At El Carrizo a nest, nine to 10 inches in diameter and constructed of  leaves and small sticks, was in a thick tangle of branches 25 feet  above the ground. A male having testes 11 mm. long was in the nest.  Among 16 females collected in the months of February, May and June,  only two, taken in February, were lactating. A female from 70  kilometers south of Ciudad Victoria, had four placental scars, three on  the right side and one on the left, along with a resorbed embryo on the  right side; according to the collector \"the scars appeared quite  recent, as evidenced by the fact that not all of the blood had been  resorbed yet.\"    The northernmost localities from which _S. d. negligens_ has been  reported are nine and a half miles southwest of Padilla in the east,  and Rancho Santa Rosa in the west.    Three males from the vicinity of Padilla weighed 309, 276, and 261  grams.         _Records of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 92: 9-1/2 mi.       SW Padilla, 800 ft., 3; Rancho Santa Rosa, 25 km.

Washington,       12:147, June 3, type from Monterrey, Nuevo Leon.         _Distribution in Tamaulipas._--Along Sierra Madre Oriental       in southwestern part of state.    This squirrel occurs in stands of oak and \"nogalillos\" (hickory) trees  that grow along streams and arroyos. Individuals are active from  sunrise to about 10:00 a. m. and again late in the afternoon. They give  a soft \"chirring\" call.    Nelson (1899:92) noted that specimens from Miquihuana were smaller than  those from the type locality. Among specimens I have examined, some are  as large as topotypes and two females are larger (total length, 486 and  490) than measurements given for the species by Nelson (_op. cit._).         _Record of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 11, from Joya       Verde, 35 km.

U. S. Nat. Mus.,       11:159 for 1888, January 5, type from Padre Island, Cameron       County, Texas.         _Distribution in Tamaulipas._--Known only from the barrier       beach in northeastern part of state.    The specimens examined are referred, tentatively, to _Geomys personatus  personatus_ on geographic grounds. They average smaller in all  measurements than _personatus_ (but are larger than _G. p.  megapotamus_), do not have the sagittal crest that usually is present  in _personatus_, and the shape of the pterygoid bones is distinctive.  In _personatus_ and _megapotamus_ the ventral border of the pterygoids  (in lateral view) is convex instead of nearly straight as in specimens  from the barrier beach. The specimens recorded here are all that are  known of _G. personatus_ (see account of _G. tropicalis_) from Mexico.         _Measurements._--Average and extreme external measurements       of five females from 73 miles south of Washington Beach are       as follows: 266.8 (263-271); 94.8 (91-98); 34 (33-35).       Cranial measurements of two males (89038, 89032) and average       and extremes of five females are respectively: basal length,       49.1, 46.6, 45.9 (44.2-46.8); basilar length, 42.9, 40.0,       39.8 (38.0-40.8); zygomatic breadth, 29.6, 28.3, 28.0       (25.7-29.9); squamosal breadth, 27.8, 25.9, 26.2       (23.8-25.4); interorbital constriction, 7.4, 6.9, 7.3       (6.7-7.8); alveolar length of maxillary tooth-row, 10.3,       9.2, 9.4 (9.1-9.7).         _Records of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 17: 35 mi.

Biol.       Soc. Washington, 28:134, June 29, type from Altamira,       Tamaulipas.         _Distribution in Tamaulipas._--Known only from vicinity of       type locality, in southeastern part of state.    _Geomys tropicalis_ was named as a subspecies of _G. personatus_ in  1915 by E. A. Goldman. To my knowledge, no one other than Goldman has  critically studied specimens of this pocket gopher, nor have specimens  other than those listed in the original description been reported up to  now. In 1953, Gerd H. Heinrich collected a series of 19 individuals one  mile south of Altamira. These specimens were compared (by E. R. Hall in  March, 1962) with the holotype and paratypes of _G. p. tropicalis_ and  were found to be indistinguishable.    Careful comparisons of the specimens from one mile south of Altamira  with topotypes of _G. personatus personatus_ (and specimens of other  subspecies) indicate that _tropicalis_ differs from _personatus_ in a  number of important characters, some of which _tropicalis_ shares with  _Geomys arenarius_ of the Rio Grande Valley and adjacent areas in  Texas, New Mexico, and Chihuahua (see Table 2).

This bridge consisted of four or five stout pillars of loose  stones which acted as piers, on which were laid a few pieces of wood, on  which flat stones were placed. It was a rough form of bridge, but served  at ordinary times for its purpose. During the course of this summer,  however, after heavy rain, these piers so dammed up the water as to  cause it to rise some 4 or 5 feet on the upper side of them with the  result that the immense weight of water swept the whole bridge away.  Bullock and Mallory with half a dozen coolies had left early in the  morning, intending to bivouac out for a couple of nights and climb one  of the hills to the South of the Bhong-chu in order to get a view of  Mount Everest. After we had gone about 5 miles we met them close to the  bridge, as they had lost their way and had been walking for about 15  miles: not having found the bridge, they had forded the river and had  got wet up to their necks in crossing it. At dusk we reached the village  of Tsakor, where we found a tent pitched for us, and here we spent the  night. Our transport did not turn up till nearly nine o'clock, and so we  all slept in the mess tent. From here to Tingri was still another 20  miles--the path following the right bank of the Bhong-chu the whole way.  In places the river was as much as 200 yards wide and flowed very  sluggishly. We were told that the waters were very low, but that next  month, when the rains had broken, the river often filled the whole of  the bottom of the valley. On the way we passed some very handsome  black-necked cranes as large as the Saurus crane. These had black heads  and bills, with red eyes, light grey bodies and black tails with fine  feathers. On this march the midges were dreadfully annoying the whole  way, and we were surrounded with clouds of them the whole time. Their  bite was very tiresome and extremely irritating. On the way we passed a  Mongolian who had taken eleven months in coming from Lhasa and who was  on his way to Nepal. His method of progression was by throwing himself  at full length down on the ground. He then got up and at the spot where  his hands touched the ground repeated the motion again. As we approached  Tingri, the valley widened out and bent round to the South. Tingri  itself was situated on the side of a small hill in the middle of a great  plain, from which, looking to the South, was visible the wonderful chain  of snowy peaks, many of them over 25,000 feet in height, which extends  Westwards from Mount Everest. We crossed the Ra-chu--a tributary of the  Bhong-chu, partly by bridges and partly by fords; it was split up into a  number of small and very muddy channels that took their rise from the  Kyetrak Glacier. Tingri was to be our first base for reconnoitring the  Northern and North-western approaches to Mount Everest. It was June 19  when we arrived there, so that it had taken us just a month's travelling  from Darjeeling to perform this part of our journey.                                          CHAPTER IV                        TINGRI AND THE COUNTRY TO THE SOUTH      Tingri is a place of some importance, with a considerable trade at  certain seasons of the year. It is the last place of any size on this  side of the Nepalese frontier and boasts of a military governor. The  garrison, however, when we visited it, consisted only of a sergeant and  four or five soldiers. There were about three hundred houses in Tingri,  all clustered together on the slopes of a small isolated hill standing  in the middle of the great plain. On the top of the hill was the old  Chinese fort, now all falling into ruin, but still littered with papers  and books, written in Chinese characters, left behind by the Chinese on  their hasty departure. Inside were quaint mural frescoes of curious old  men riding stags or winged dragons painted in many colours. All the way  up the valley of the Bhong-chu we had seen ruins of walls and evidences  of much fighting. These all dated back, we were told, to the time of the  Nepalese invasions of Tibet in the eighteenth century when the Gurkhas  penetrated so far into Tibet that they actually got to Shigatse, and the  Tibetans had to call upon the Chinese Empire for help. The Chinese came  into the country with a large army, defeated the Gurkhas, drove them out  of Tibet and crossed the Himalayas with a considerable army into Nepal,  an extraordinary military feat considering the enormous difficulty of  moving an army in these unhospitable regions over the high mountain  passes through which it is approached. The Chinese, after this, never  left Tibet until they were driven out by the Tibetans only a few years  ago. In the hills round Tingri we came across many evidences of the  fighting which then took place. This probably accounted for the large  number of ruined and deserted villages that we saw in the valleys  around. At the foot of the hill was a large Chinese rest-house which was  only used to house Tibetan officials when they came there on duty. The  Tibetans themselves did not like to live in or use the place, as many  Chinese had died there and they thought that their ghosts haunted the  spot. This rest-house was, however, swept out and prepared for our  reception, as we had told the Tibetans that we should probably stay  there for some time and should want a house to protect us from the wind  and to provide a dark room for developing our photographs. The  rest-house consisted of three courtyards in the outer one we put the  coolies, in the middle one the surveyors, and the inner one we kept for  ourselves. In appearance the building was quite picturesque with its  mural paintings of flying dogs and fierce dragons; but in spite of its  picturesqueness outside and its handsome appearance, the rooms inside  were small, and when the rain came it poured through the roof and our  beds had to be shifted many times during the night to avoid the drips of  water. It however provided an excellent dark room for us after we had  well plastered the walls, the floor and the ceiling with mud and got rid  of the dust of ages. To do any photographic work in Tibet a house is a  necessity, as with the violent wind that blows every day all one's  belongings get covered with dust which would ruin any negative. At first  we found water a great difficulty as the local water was full of mud,  but we eventually discovered a beautifully clear spring, about half a  mile away, which bubbled up in a deep bluey green basin, and this water  we used always, both for drinking and for photographic work. Tingri had  many advantages as a base. Stores, supplies and transport were always  available there, as it was the headquarters of the district. It also  provided an easy means of approach to Mount Everest from the North-west  and to the high group of mountains that lay to the West of Mount  Everest. After sorting out all our stores and equipment and seeing in  what state they were after the journey, our next business was the making  of a dark room, as we had taken many photographs on the journey that  required developing. The weather at this time was very fine, but the  Tibetans kept on telling us that the rainy season ought to be starting,  so we determined as soon as possible to send out parties in different  directions to make the most of the favourable opportunity. The first  morning after our arrival we were up on the top of the hill by six  o'clock in the hope of getting a good view to the South, but the clouds  were already over most of the mountains. Everest we could see quite  clearly, and Cho-Uyo, the great 26,800 feet peak that lies to the West  of Mount Everest. The Depon here, who was acting as the Governor of the  place, was a nice young fellow and very cheery, and later on I got to  know him very well and went over to his house and was entertained by him  and his wife. He told me that the Tibetans still paid tribute to Nepal  for all that part of the country, and that the amount they had to pay  was the equivalent of 5,000 rupees per annum. The Nepalese kept a  head-man at Tingri and another at Nyenyam to deal with all criminal  cases and offences committed by Nepalese subjects when in Tibet. I found  later on that the Tibetans were very frightened of the Nepalese, or of  having any dealings with a Gurkha. I took photographs of the Depon's  wife and all their children, and of his mother-in-law, which delighted  them immensely; the wife at first was very shy of coming forward, but  after many tears and protestations her husband finally induced her to be  photographed. The great semi-circular head-dresses that the women wear  are usually covered with turquoises, and coral, and often with strings  of seed pearls across them. Round their necks hang long chains of either  turquoise or coral beads, sometimes mixed with lumps of amber. Suspended  round the neck by a shorter chain is generally a very elaborately  decorated charm box, those belonging to the richer or upper classes  being of gold inlaid with turquoises, the poorer people having them  made of silver with poorer turquoises. The officials, as a rule, have a  long ear-ring, 4 or 5 inches long, of turquoises and pearls, suspended  from the left ear, while in the right ear they wear a single turquoise  of very good quality. Nearly every one carries a rosary, with which  their hands are playing about the whole day. We were told that the laws  governing marriage in those parts were strictly regulated. Owing to the  excessive number of males, a form of polyandry prevails. If there were  four brothers in a family, and the eldest one married a wife, his wife  would also be the property of the three younger brothers; but if the  second or third brother married, their wives would be common only to  themselves and their youngest brother.
