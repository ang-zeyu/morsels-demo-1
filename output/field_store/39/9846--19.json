His first act was to transfer the traveling machine to his own wrist  and to see that his other electrical devices were safely bestowed in  his pockets.  Then he sat upon the rock to rest until the Turk  recovered consciousness.    Presently the fellow moved uneasily, rolled over, and then sat up and  stared at his surroundings.  Perhaps he thought he had been dreaming,  for he rubbed his eyes and looked again with mingled surprise and  alarm.  Then, seeing Rob, he uttered a savage shout and drew his dagger.    Rob smiled and pointed the electric tube at the man, who doubtless  recognized its power, for he fell back scowling and trembling.    \"This place seems like a good jog from civilization,\" remarked the boy,  as coolly as if his companion could understand what he said; \"but as  your legs are long and strong you may be able to find your way.  It's  true you're liable to starve to death, but if you do it will be your  own misfortune and not my fault.\"    The Turk glared at him sullenly, but did not attempt to reply.    Rob took out his box of tablets, ate one of them and offered another to  his enemy.  The fellow accepted it ungraciously enough, but seeing Rob  eat one he decided to follow his example, and consumed the tablet with  a queer expression of distrust upon his face.    \"Brave man!\" cried Rob, laughingly; \"you've avoided the pangs of  starvation for a time, anyhow, so I can leave you with a clear  conscience.\"    Without more ado, he turned the indicator of the traveling machine and  mounted into the air, leaving the Turk sitting upon the rocks and  staring after him in comical bewilderment.          15.  A Battle with Monsters      Our young adventurer never experienced a more grateful feeling of  relief and security than when he found himself once more high in the  air, alone, and in undisputed possession of the electrical devices  bestowed upon him by the Demon.    The dangers he had passed through since landing at the city of the  desert and the desperate chance that alone had permitted him to regain  the traveling machine made him shudder at the bare recollection and  rendered him more sober and thoughtful than usual.    We who stick closely to the earth's surface can scarcely realize how  Rob could travel through the air at such dizzy heights without any fear  or concern whatsoever.  But he had come to consider the air a veritable  refuge.  Experience had given him implicit confidence in the powers of  the electrical instrument whose unseen forces carried him so swiftly  and surely, and while the tiny, watch-like machine was clasped to his  wrist he felt himself to be absolutely safe.    Having slipped away from the Turk and attained a fair altitude, he set  the indicator at zero and paused long enough to consult his map and  decide what direction it was best for him to take.  The mischance that  had swept him unwittingly over the countries of Europe had also carried  him more than half way around the world from his home.  Therefore the  nearest way to reach America would be to continue traveling to the  eastward.    So much time had been consumed at the desert oasis that he felt he must  now hasten if he wished to reach home by Saturday afternoon; so, having  quickly come to a decision, he turned the indicator and began a swift  flight into the east.    For several hours he traveled above the great desert of Gobi, but by  noon signs of a more fertile country began to appear, and, dropping to  a point nearer the earth, he was able to observe closely the country of  the Chinese, with its crowded population and ancient but crude  civilization.    Then he came to the Great Wall of China and to mighty Peking, above  which he hovered some time, examining it curiously.  He really longed  to make a stop there, but with his late experiences fresh in his mind  he thought it much safer to view the wonderful city from a distance.    Resuming his flight he presently came to the gulf of Laou Tong, whose  fair face was freckled with many ships of many nations, and so on to  Korea, which seemed to him a land fully a century behind the times.    Night overtook him while speeding across the Sea of Japan, and having a  great desire to view the Mikado's famous islands, he put the indicator  at zero, and, coming to a full stop, composed himself to sleep until  morning, that he might run no chances of being carried beyond his  knowledge during the night.    You might suppose it no easy task to sleep suspended in mid-air, yet  the magnetic currents controlled by the traveling machine were so  evenly balanced that Rob was fully as comfortable as if reposing upon a  bed of down.  He had become somewhat accustomed to passing the night in  the air and now slept remarkably well, having no fear of burglars or  fire or other interruptions that dwellers in cities are subject to.    One thing, however, he should have remembered: that he was in an  ancient and little known part of the world and reposing above a sea  famous in fable as the home of many fierce and terrible creatures;  while not far away lay the land of the dragon, the simurg and other  ferocious monsters.    Rob may have read of these things in fairy tales and books of travel,  but if so they had entirely slipped his mind; so he slumbered  peacefully and actually snored a little, I believe, towards morning.    But even as the red sun peeped curiously over the horizon he was  awakened by a most unusual disturbance--a succession of hoarse screams  and a pounding of the air as from the quickly revolving blades of some  huge windmill.    He rubbed his eyes and looked around.    Coming towards him at his right hand was an immense bird, whose body  seemed almost as big as that of a horse.  Its wide-open, curving beak  was set with rows of pointed teeth, and the talons held against its  breast and turned threateningly outward were more powerful and dreadful  than a tiger's claws.    While, fascinated and horrified, he watched the approach of this  feathered monster, a scream sounded just behind him and the next  instant the stroke of a mighty wing sent him whirling over and over  through the air.    He soon came to a stop, however, and saw that another of the monsters  had come upon him from the rear and was now, with its mate, circling  closely around him, while both uttered continuously their hoarse,  savage cries.    Rob wondered why the Garment of Repulsion had not protected him from  the blow of the bird's wing; but, as a matter of fact, it had protected  him.  For it was not the wing itself but the force of the eddying  currents of air that had sent him whirling away from the monster.  With  the indicator at zero the magnetic currents and the opposing powers of  attraction and repulsion were so evenly balanced that any violent  atmospheric disturbance affected him in the same way that thistledown  is affected by a summer breeze.  He had noticed something of this  before, but whenever a strong wind was blowing he was accustomed to  rise to a position above the air currents.  This was the first time he  had slept with the indicator at zero.    The huge birds at once renewed their attack, but Rob had now recovered  his wits sufficiently to draw the electric tube from his pocket.  The  first one to dart towards him received the powerful electric current  direct from the tube, and fell stunned and fluttering to the surface of  the sea, where it floated motionless.  Its mate, perhaps warned by this  sudden disaster, renewed its circling flight, moving so swiftly that  Rob could scarcely follow it, and drawing nearer and nearer every  moment to its intended victim.  The boy could not turn in the air very  quickly, and he feared an attack in the back, mistrusting the saving  power of the Garment of Repulsion under such circumstances; so in  desperation he pressed his finger upon the button of the tube and  whirled the instrument around his head in the opposite direction to  that in which the monster was circling.  Presently the current and the  bird met, and with one last scream the creature tumbled downwards to  join its fellow upon the waves, where they lay like two floating  islands.    Their presence had left a rank, sickening stench in the surrounding  atmosphere, so Rob made haste to resume his journey and was soon moving  rapidly eastward.    He could not control a shudder at the recollection of his recent  combat, and realized the horror of a meeting with such creatures by one  who had no protection from their sharp beaks and talons.    \"It's no wonder the Japs draw ugly pictures of those monsters,\" he  thought.  \"People who live in these parts must pass most of their lives  in a tremble.\"    The sun was now shining brilliantly, and when the beautiful islands of  Japan came in sight Rob found that he had recovered his wonted  cheerfulness.  He moved along slowly, hovering with curious interest  over the quaint and picturesque villages and watching the industrious  Japanese patiently toiling at their tasks.  Just before he reached  Tokio he came to a military fort, and for nearly an hour watched the  skilful maneuvers of a regiment of soldiers at their morning drill.  They were not very big people, compared with other nations, but they  seemed alert and well trained, and the boy decided it would require a  brave enemy to face them on a field of battle.    Having at length satisfied his curiosity as to Japanese life and  customs Rob prepared for his long flight across the Pacific Ocean.    By consulting his map he discovered that should he maintain his course  due east, as before, he would arrive at a point in America very near to  San Francisco, which suited his plans excellently.    Having found that he moved more swiftly when farthest from the earth's  surface, because the air was more rarefied and offered less resistance,  Rob"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43607"],[0,"Builders of United Italy (#16)"],[1,"listened to the advice of its wisest members, and  abandoning all dissension, chose Manin as President of the Republic,  giving him complete power both as to internal administration and as  to relations with foreign states. Manin spoke in reply: \"In accepting  the charge which this Assembly has entrusted to me, I am conscious of  committing an act of insensate boldness. I accept it. But in order that  my good name, and, what is of more importance, your good name and that  of Venice, may not be tarnished through this transaction, it behooves  that I should be seconded and sustained in my arduous undertaking by  your co-operation, confidence, and affection. We have been strong,  respected, eulogized, up till now, because we have been united. I ask of  you virtues which, if they are not romantic, are at all events of great  practical utility. I ask of you patience, prudence, perseverance. With  these, and with concord, love, and faith, all things are overcome.\"    Charles Albert again took the field and for a brief interval the  Austrians were repulsed. Brescia made a heroic stand, and the Venetians  heard the news of the little city's courage with shouts of acclamation  and an added determination to fight Austria to the uttermost. The  Venetian fleet was kept in constant readiness, the troops slept with  their arms, there was only the one thought, to keep the lion-flag of St.  Mark flying from the _pili_.    Then on March 28, 1849, came letters from Turin telling of the utter  defeat of Novara and of Charles Albert's abdication in favor of his son.    The first effect of the news on Venice was absolute stupefaction, then  a wild rush to the Square of St. Mark's. A tremendous crowd called,  as usual in its troubles, for its \"father, Manin!\" Said a foreigner  who was a witness of the scene, \"The faith of Venice in this man was  inconceivable, complete, and absolute. He had never deceived, never  abused it. The people seemed to attribute to him omnipotence and  omniscience, and believed him capable of guarding Venice from every  peril, and of rescuing her from every calamity.\"    The President appeared on the Palace balcony. He said that he had not  yet received official confirmation of the news from Turin, but his sad  expression and his few words showed his belief that the news might prove  only too true. Venice passed a night of bitterest gloom, more hopeless  even than in the later days when Austrian bombs exploded in the streets.  Three similar days followed, and then came official confirmation of the  news. Lombardy was Austrian once more.    The city withstood the shock, and took up its life of outward cheer and  hope. On April 25, St. Mark's Day, there was a grand _festa_, and Manin  spoke. \"Who holds out wins,\" he declared. \"We have held out, and we  shall win. Long live St. Mark! This cry, that the seas rang with in old  days, we must raise again. Europe looks on, and will praise. We must, we  ought to win. To the Sea! To the Sea! To the Sea!\" There was tremendous  thrill in his magnetic voice, in his deep blue eyes, in the glow of his  pallid face; Venice cried aloud with eager hope.    With this spring of 1849 came the great days. When the Assembly had  voted to resist Austria at all costs, the people adopted a red ribbon  as their emblem. A historian of that time says: \"From the top of the  _Campanile_ of St. Mark, far above the domes, the roofs, and the spires  of the palace and the basilica, beside the golden angel that seemed  to watch over the city, they planted a huge red banner, which stood  out like a spot of blood against the azure sky, which was seen by the  enemy's fleet afar off in the Adriatic, and by their army on the distant  mainland. It defied them both, and announced to them that Venice would  fight to the last drop of blood.\"    Placards were fixed to every wall, at the corner of every street.  They read: \"Venice resists! Church plate, women's golden ornaments,  bronze bells, copper cooking utensils, the iron of the enemy's cannon  balls--all will be useful. Anything rather than the Croats!\"    Night and day workmen had been building ships, now the little fleet  fought through the lagunes as had the great fleets of the olden days.  The land forces held the shore batteries, and these forces were composed  of all the city. One artillery company, famous as the Bandiera-Moro,  was made up of the patrician youth of Venice, who, with their ancient  love of splendor, wore velvet tunics, gray scarves, and caps with  plumes. When the bitter fight came at Fort Malghera they held their guns  heroically, fresh men leaping to replace the dead, cheering for Venice  as the bombs fell among them, firing and eating and carrying off the  wounded under a devastating fusillade. Venice thirsted for glory, and  she won it; there are no more stirring tales in history than that of the  brief defense of the new-born Republic.    In July came continual bombardment, and with it cholera, and the seeds  of sedition spread by Austrian spies. Manin feared civil dissension, he  heard grumblers in the streets. No one dared accuse the man, whom the  Assembly had chosen absolute dictator, of any wavering or treasonable  thought, but some raised cries beneath his windows in the Piazzetta.  The Dictator appeared suddenly before them. \"Venetians,\" he cried,  \"is this worthy of you? You are not the people, you are only an  insignificant faction. Never will I accede to the caprices of a mob!  My acts shall be guided solely by the representatives of the people,  assembled in their Congress. I will always speak the truth to you, even  should muskets be leveled at my breast, and daggers be pointed at my  heart. And now go home, all of you--go home!\"    His words swayed even that rebellious crowd, and they cheered him. For  the time sedition was silent, but the people were losing hope. They were  a mere handful battling with the forces of an empire. Manin saw that all  he could do was to insure that his people died as heroes.    The city was the prey of famine, pestilence, and fire when on August  13 she held her last _festa_. The Dictator spoke to the troops in the  Square of St. Mark's. His words rang like a clarion call. \"A people that  have done and suffered as our people have done and suffered cannot die.  The day shall come when a splendid destiny will be your guerdon. What  time will bring that day? This rests with God. We have sown the good  seed: it will take root in good soil.... If it be not ours to ward off  these calamities, it is ours to maintain inviolate the honor of the  city.... One single day that sees Venice not worthy of herself, and all  that she has done will be lost and forgotten.\" He asked them if they had  still their confidence in him, if not he would resign the leadership to  another. The Square shook with the thunder of the soldiers' \"Yes!\" He  went on: \"Your indomitable love saddens me, and makes me feel yet more  how this people suffer! On my mental and bodily faculties you must not  count, but count always on my great, tender, undying affection. And come  what may, say, 'This man was misled:' but do not ever say, 'This man  misled us.' I have deceived no one. I have never spread illusions which  were not my own. I have never said I hoped when I had no hope.\"    As he finished speaking he staggered, and was barely able to get to  the Council Chamber. There his physical weakness overmastered him.  \"Such a people,\" he cried brokenly, \"for such a people to be obliged to  surrender!\"    Nevertheless each hour now brought home the conviction that the strength  of Venice was ebbing rapidly. Flames and the plague and the unremitting  Austrian attack were bringing the proud city to her knees. Manin could  only hope that he might at the last make honorable terms of surrender,  he would not sacrifice all their heroic efforts to the desire for  instant peace. On August 18 the people gathered in St. Mark's Square,  begging for some word of their President's plans. He came out before  them. \"Venetians,\" he said, \"I have already told you frankly that our  situation is a grave one, but if it be grave it is not desperate to the  degree of reducing us to cowardice ... it is an infamy to suppose that  Venice would ask of me to do what was infamous; and if she should ask it  this one sacrifice I would not make--even for Venice.\"    Some one in the throng cried, \"We are hungry!\"    \"Let him who is hungry stand forth!\" answered Manin.    \"None of us,\" cried the devoted people. \"We are Italians! Long live  Manin!\"    Five days later the city was torn by conflicting rumors of mutiny and  surrender. Manin had not yet succeeded in winning the terms he wanted  from the Austrians. When the people called for him he came out on the  balcony as he had so often done before. He spoke a few words, and then a  sudden pain seized him and he fell fainting into a chair. A little later  he reappeared and cried to the cheering people, \"Let those who are true  Venetians patrol the city to-night with me.\" Then he took his sword,  and at the head of a great concourse, marched to the section of the  city where the mutineers had gathered. Shots were fired. Manin stepped  forward. \"If you wish my life, take it!\" he said. The mutineers were  silenced.    The following day, August 24, 1849, the city capitulated, the stock of  provisions having been absolutely exhausted that same day. The terms  were honorable, such Venetian soldiers as had been in the Austrian  service were to leave Venice. Forty civilians, headed by Manin, were  to leave. The powers of government were temporarily lodged in the  municipality.    That same day Manin left the Doge's Palace for his own small house. All  day the people passed before the door, saying, \"Here lives our poor  father! How much he has suffered for us!\" He was too absolutely worn out  to see any one. At midnight he with his wife and son and invalid small  daughter went on board the French"]]]
