Orthodox churches are highly nationalist and ethnic. The Orthodox  Christian faith shares many theological tenets with the Roman  Catholic Church, but diverges on some key premises and does not  recognize the governing authority of the Pope.     Protestant Christianity: Protestant Christianity originated in  the 16th century as an attempt to reform Roman Catholicism's  practices, dogma, and theology. It encompasses several forms or  denominations which are extremely varied in structure, beliefs,  relationship to state, clergy, and governance. Many protestant  theologies emphasize the primary role of scripture in their faith,  advocating individual interpretation of Christian texts without the  mediation of a final religious authority such as the Roman Pope. The  oldest Protestant Christianities include Lutheranism, Calvinism  (Presbyterians), and Anglican Christianity (Episcopalians), which  have established liturgies, governing structure, and formal clergy.  Other variants on Protestant Christianity, including Pentecostal  movements and independent churches, may lack one or more of these  elements, and their leadership and beliefs are individualized and  dynamic.  Hinduism - Originating in the Vedic civilization of India (second  and first millennium B.C.), Hinduism is an extremely diverse set of  beliefs and practices with no single founder or religious authority.  Hinduism has many scriptures; the Vedas, the Upanishads, and the  Bhagavad-Gita are among some of the most important. Hindus may  worship one or many deities, usually with prayer rituals within  their own home. The most common figures of devotion are the gods  Vishnu, Shiva, and a mother goddess, Devi. Most Hindus believe the  soul, or atman, is eternal, and goes through a cycle of birth,  death, and rebirth (samsara) determined by one's positive or  negative karma, or the consequences of one's actions. The goal of  religious life is to learn to act so as to finally achieve  liberation (moksha) of one's soul, escaping the rebirth cycle.  Islam - The third of the monotheistic Abrahamic faiths, Islam  originated with the teachings of Muhammad in the 7th century.  Muslims believe Muhammad is the final of all religious prophets  (beginning with Abraham) and that the Qu'ran, which is the Islamic  scripture, was revealed to him by God. Islam derives from the word  submission, and obedience to God is a primary theme in this  religion. In order to live an Islamic life, believers must follow  the five pillars, or tenets, of Islam, which are the testimony of  faith (shahada), daily prayer (salah), giving alms (zakah), fasting  during Ramadan (sawm), and the pilgrimage to Mecca (hajj).  Basic Groupings     The two primary branches of Islam are Sunni and Shia, which split  from each other over a religio-political leadership dispute about  the rightful successor to Muhammad. The Shia believe Muhammad's  cousin and son-in-law, Ali, was the only divinely ordained Imam  (religious leader), while the Sunni maintain the first three caliphs  after Muhammad were also legitimate authorities. In modern Islam,  Sunnis and Shia continue to have different views of acceptable  schools of Islamic jurisprudence, and who is a proper Islamic  religious authority. Islam also has an active mystical branch,  Sufism, with various Sunni and Shia subsets.      Sunni Islam accounts for over 75% of the world's Muslim  population. It recognizes the Abu Bakr as the first caliph after  Muhammad. Sunni has four schools of Islamic doctrine and law -  Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, and Hanbali - which uniquely interpret the  Hadith, or recorded oral traditions of Muhammad. A Sunni Muslim may  elect to follow any one of these schools, as all are considered  equally valid.      Shia Islam represents 10-20% of Muslims worldwide, and its  distinguishing feature is its reverence for Ali as an infallible,  divinely inspired leader, and as the first Imam of the Muslim  community after Muhammad. A majority of Shia are known as  \"Twelvers,\" because they believe that the 11 familial successor  imams after Muhammad culminate in a 12th Imam (al-Mahdi) who is  hidden in the world and will reappear at its end to redeem the  righteous.  Variants     Ismaili faith: A sect of Shia Islam, its adherents are also known  as \"Seveners,\" because they believe that the rightful seventh Imam  in Islamic leadership was Isma'il, the elder son of Imam Jafar  al-Sadiq. Ismaili tradition awaits the return of the seventh Imam as  the Mahdi, or Islamic messianic figure. Ismailis are located in  various parts of the world, particularly South Asia and the Levant.     Alawi faith: Another Shia sect of Islam, the name reflects  followers' devotion to the religious authority of Ali. Alawites are  a closed, secretive religious group who assert they are Shia  Muslims, although outside scholars speculate their beliefs may have  a syncretic mix with other faiths originating in the Middle East.  Alawis live mostly in Syria, Lebanon, and Turkey.     Druze faith: A highly secretive tradition and a closed community  that derives from the Ismaili sect of Islam; its core beliefs are  thought to emphasize a combination of Gnostic principles believing  that the Fatimid caliph, al-Hakin, is the one who embodies the key  aspects of goodness of the universe, which are, the intellect, the  word, the soul, the preceder, and the follower. The Druze have a key  presence in Syria, Lebanon, and Israel.  Jainism - Originating in India, Jain spiritual philosophy believes  in an eternal human soul, the eternal universe, and a principle of  \"the own nature of things.\" It emphasizes compassion for all living  things, seeks liberation of the human soul from reincarnation  through enlightenment, and values personal responsibility due to the  belief in the immediate consequences of one's behavior. Jain  philosophy teaches non-violence and prescribes vegetarianism for  monks and laity alike; its adherents are a highly influential  religious minority in Indian society.  Judaism - One of the first known monotheistic religions, likely  dating to between 2000-1500 B.C., Judaism is the native faith of the  Jewish people, based upon the belief in a covenant of responsibility  between a sole omnipotent creator God and Abraham, the patriarch of  Judaism's Hebrew Bible, or Tanakh. Divine revelation of principles  and prohibitions in the Hebrew Scriptures form the basis of Jewish  law, or halakhah, which is a key component of the faith. While there  are extensive traditions of Jewish halakhic and theological  discourse, there is no final dogmatic authority in the tradition.  Local communities have their own religious leadership. Modern  Judaism has three basic categories of faith: Orthodox, Conservative,  and Reform/Liberal. These differ in their views and observance of  Jewish law, with the Orthodox representing the most traditional  practice, and Reform/Liberal communities the most accommodating of  individualized interpretations of Jewish identity and faith.  Shintoism - A native animist tradition of Japan, Shinto practice is  based upon the premise that every being and object has its own  spirit or kami. Shinto practitioners worship several particular  kamis, including the kamis of nature, and families often have  shrines to their ancestors' kamis. Shintoism has no fixed tradition  of prayers or prescribed dogma, but is characterized by individual  ritual. Respect for the kamis in nature is a key Shinto value. Prior  to the end of World War II, Shinto was the state religion of Japan,  and bolstered the cult of the Japanese emperor.  Sikhism - Founded by the Guru Nanak (born 1469), Sikhism believes in  a non-anthropomorphic, supreme, eternal, creator God; centering  one's devotion to God is seen as a means of escaping the cycle of  rebirth. Sikhs follow the teachings of Nanak and nine subsequent  gurus. Their scripture, the Guru Granth Sahib - also known as the  Adi Granth - is considered the living Guru, or final authority of  Sikh faith and theology. Sikhism emphasizes equality of humankind  and disavows caste, class, or gender discrimination.  Taoism - Chinese philosophy or religion based upon Lao Tzu's Tao Te  Ching, which centers on belief in the Tao, or the way, as the flow  of the universe and the nature of things. Taoism encourages a  principle of non-force, or wu-wei, as the means to live harmoniously  with the Tao. Taoists believe the esoteric world is made up of a  perfect harmonious balance and nature, while in the manifest world -  particularly in the body - balance is distorted. The Three Jewels of  the Tao - compassion, simplicity, and humility - serve as the basis  for Taoist ethics.  Zoroastrianism - Originating from the teachings of Zoroaster in  about the 9th or 10th century B.C., Zoroastrianism may be the oldest  continuing creedal religion. Its key beliefs center on a  transcendent creator God, Ahura Mazda, and the concept of free will.  The key ethical tenets of Zoroastrianism expressed in its scripture,  the Avesta, are based on a dualistic worldview where one may prevent  chaos if one chooses to serve God and exercises good thoughts, good  words, and good deeds. Zoroastrianism is generally a closed religion  and members are almost always born to Zoroastrian parents. Prior to  the spread of Islam, Zoroastrianism dominated greater Iran. Today,  though a minority, Zoroastrians remain primarily in Iran, India, and  Pakistan.

(#16)"],[1,"questions; and they knew nothing whatsoever of astronomy, certainly  nothing about Mars.    A diagram was hung up, based upon some drawing or other of the planet made  by Schiaparelli, Lowell or other Martian observer, but the canals were not  inserted; only a few dots or irregular markings were put in here and  there. And the boys were arranged at different distances from the diagram  and told to draw exactly what they saw. Those nearest the diagram were  able to detect the little irregular markings and represented them under  their true forms. Those at the back of the room could not see anything of  them, and only represented the broadest features of the diagram, the  continents and seas. Those in the middle of the room were too far off to  define the minute markings, but were near enough for those markings to  produce some impression upon them; and that impression always was of a  network of straight lines, sometimes with dots at the points of meeting.  Advancing from a distance toward the diagram the process of development  became quite clear. At the back of the room no straight lines were seen;  as the observer came slowly forward, first one straight line would appear  completely, then another, and so on, until all the chief canals drawn by  Schiaparelli and Lowell in the region represented had come into evidence  in their proper places. Advancing still further, the canals disappeared,  and the little irregular markings which had given rise to them were  perceived in their true forms.    These experiments at the Greenwich Hospital School were merely the  repetition of similar ones that I had myself made privately twelve years  earlier, leading me to the conclusion, published in 1894, that the canals  of Mars were simply the summation of a complexity of detail too minute to  be separately discerned.    A little later, in his work \"_Marte nel 1896-7_,\" Dr. Cerulli  independently arrived at the same conclusion, and wrote: \"These lines are  formed by the eye ... which utilizes ... the dark elements which it finds  along certain directions\"; and \"a large number of these elements forms a  broad band\"; and \"a smaller number of them gives rise to a narrow line.\"  Also, \"the marvellous appearance of the lines in question has its origin,  not in the reality of the thing, but in the inability of the present  telescope to show faithfully such a reality.\" In 1907, Prof. Newcomb made  some experiments in the same direction and reached the same general  conclusion. More recently still, Prof. W. H. Pickering has worked on the  same lines and with the same result. The venerable George Pollock,  formerly the Senior Master of the Supreme Court and King's Remembrancer,  sent to me, in his 91st year, the following note as affording an apt  illustration of the true nature of the canaliform markings on Mars:    \"On Saturday last, journeying in a motor-car, I came into a broad road  bounded by a dark wood. Looking up I was amazed to see distinct,  well-defined, vertical, parallel white lines, the wood forming the dark  background. On getting nearer, these lines resolved themselves into spots,  and they proved to be the white insulators supporting the telegraph  wires.\"    Prof. Lowell has objected that all experiments and illustrations of this  kind are irrelevant; only observations upon the planet itself ought to be  taken into account.    But such observations have been made upon the planet itself with just the  same result. Observers have seen streaks upon Mars--knotted, broken,  irregular, full of detail--and when the planet has receded to a greater  distance, the very same marking has shown itself as a narrow straight  line, uniform from end to end, as if drawn with pen, ink and ruler. The  greater distance has caused the irregularities, seen when nearer at hand,  to disappear. In this, and not in any gigantic engineering works, is the  explanation of the artificiality of the markings on Mars as Prof. Lowell  sees them. That artificiality has already disappeared under better seeing  with more powerful telescopes.    This chapter is entitled \"The Illusions of Mars.\" Yet the illusions of  Mars are not the straight lines and round dots of the canal system, but  the forced and curious interpretation which has been put upon them. If the  planet be within a certain range of distance and under examination with a  certain telescopic power, the straight lines and round dots are  inevitable. Their artificiality is not a function of the actual Martian  details themselves, but of the mode in which, under given conditions, we  are obliged to see them.          CHAPTER IX    VENUS, MERCURY AND THE ASTEROIDS      Of all the planets, Venus appears, to the unassisted eye, by far the  loveliest. When seen in the early morning before sunrise--its \"western  elongation\"--or after sundown in the evening--its \"eastern  elongation\"--and still more as it attains its greatest brilliancy, it has  attracted attention everywhere and in all ages. It then shines with  brilliance ten times as great as Jupiter in opposition, and the brightest  members of the heavenly host look pale and dim beside it. It is  emphatically the morning or the evening star, Lucifer, or Vesper, herald  or follower of the Sun; it can even assert itself in the presence of the  Lord of Day, for it has often been seen at noonday by watchers who knew  where to look; sometimes by the general crowd.    But in the telescope Venus appears less satisfying. It is a pretty  spectacle indeed to watch the phases of the gleaming little globe of  silver, for, like the Moon under varying illumination from the Sun, it  undergoes change of apparent shape. But the surface of the planet yields  little detail, and that little is illusive and ill-defined. The clear-cut  outlines and black shadows of the Moon have no place here, nor do the  ruddy plains and blue-grey \"seas\" of Mars find any analogues. All that can  be observed beyond the changes of phase are a few faint, ill-defined  patches, where the molten silver of the general surface is slightly dimmed  and tarnished, and perhaps one or two spots, not less evasive and  difficult to fix, that exceed the rest of the surface in brightness.    This very difficulty in making out the markings on Venus is hopeful for  our search; it points to a veiling over the planet, a veiling by an  atmosphere. And the statistics of the Table show that Venus closely  resembles our Earth in size and mass, and therefore probably in  atmospheric equipment. If we assume that the atmosphere of any planet is  in direct proportion to its mass--and as Venus is so nearly the twin of  the Earth there is no reason to expect any great difference between the  two in this respect--the atmosphere of Venus would have a pressure of  about 11.2 lb. on the square inch, and the level of half pressure would be  nearly four miles above the surface. In other words the atmosphere would  be both thinner and deeper than that of the Earth, but the difference  would not be important in amount.    But Venus is nearer to the Sun than the Earth, and receives nearly double  the light and heat. Its theoretical equatorial temperature is 368 deg.abs., or  95 deg.C, and its corresponding mean temperature is 69 deg. C. But water under a  pressure of 11.2 lb. will boil at 93 deg. C, so that at the equator of Venus  the upper limit for water as a liquid is just passed, but, for the planet  in general, a fairly safe margin is maintained. Here then is sufficient  explanation why the topography of Venus is concealed. The atmosphere will  always be abundantly charged with water-vapour, and an almost unbroken  screen of clouds be spread throughout its upper regions. Such a screen  will greatly protect the planet from the full scorching of the Sun, and  tend to equalize the temperature of day and night, of summer and winter,  of equator and poles. The temperature range will be slight, and there will  be no wide expanses of polar ice. Water that flows will be abundant  everywhere.    So far all the facts connected with Venus are favourable for life, even  though the picture called up to the mind may not seem inviting to us. For  views of the heavens must be rare; the Sun must seldom pierce through the  cloud veil; there is no moon and the stars must be almost always hidden.  The Earth with its Moon might form a beautiful ornament at times in the  midnight sky if the cloud-shell should occasionally open, but on the  whole, the planet is shut up to itself in a perpetual vapour-bath, and its  condition will approach that of some of the most humid countries in the  terrestrial tropics during the height of their rainy seasons.    But it would seem that life both of plants and animals, under such  conditions, might flourish and be abundant. The mean temperature would  not, in general, be high enough to drive off the water as steam, nor low  enough to congeal it into ice; it would remain water--water that flows.    But there is still a possible hindrance to life on Venus, a hindrance that  actually exists in the case of Mercury.    Mercury, the \"Twinkler,\" is not an easy object in our Northern latitudes,  but, in countries near the tropics, is often quite conspicuous, a little  scintillating gem of light in the bright sky, before sunrise or after  sunset. In the telescope it is not so attractive as Venus, partly because  it is smaller, partly because, though it receives more than three times as  much light from the Sun, it is duller in hue. Yet it is not quite so  secretive as its neighbour, and a certain number of markings have been  detected upon its disc, markings which, like those of the Moon, appear to  be permanent.    A glance at the Table will show that this was to be expected. In size,  Mercury comes between the Moon and Mars, and the atmospheric veil ought  therefore to be, as it evidently is, very slight and transparent; offering  little or no hindrance to an observer scanning it from another world.
