Far inferior in height and  muscular power to the tribesmen, the legionaries bore themselves  with a proud consciousness in their fighting power that alone went  a long way towards giving them victory. Each man trusted not only  in himself, but on his fellows, and believed that the legion to  which he belonged was invincible. Their regular arms, their broad  shields and helmets, all added to their appearance, while their  massive formation, as they stood shoulder to shoulder, shield  touching shield, seemed as if it could defy the utmost efforts of  undisciplined valour. However, Beric thought with pride that his own  tribe, the sixteen hundred men he had for six weeks been training  incessantly, would be a match even for the Roman veterans. Their  inferiority in the discipline that was carried to such perfection  among the Romans would be atoned for by their superior strength  and activity. His only fear was, that in the excitement of battle  they would forget their teaching, and, breaking their ranks, fight  every man for himself. He had, however, spared no pains in impressing  upon them that to do this would be to throw away all that they had  learned.    \"I have not taught you to fight in Roman fashion,\" he said, \"merely  that you might march in regular order and astonish the other  tribesmen, but that you should be cool and collected, should be  able patiently to stand the shock of the Roman legion, and to fight,  not as scattered units, but as a solid whole. You will do well to  bear this in mind, for to those who disobey orders and break the  line when engaged with the foe I will show no mercy. My orders  will be given to each sergeant of ten men to run a spear through  any man who stirs from his post, whether in advance or in retreat,  whether to slay or to plunder. The time may come when the safety  of the whole army depends upon your standing like a wall between  them and the Romans, and the man who advances from his place in the  ranks will, as much as the man who retreats, endanger the safety  of all.\"    Over and over again had he impressed this lesson upon them. Sometimes  he had divided them in two parts, and engaged in mimic fight. The  larger half, representing the tribesmen, advanced in their ordinary  fashion with loud shouts and cries, while the smaller section  maintained their solid formation, and with levelled spears, five  deep, waited the attack. Even those who were least impressed with  the advantages of the exercises through which they had been going,  could not but feel how immensely superior was the solid order, and  how impossible would it have been for assailants to burst through  the hedge of pointed weapons.    By sunset well nigh thirty thousand men had arrived, each subtribe  passing through the village and taking up its post on the slopes  around it, where they were at once supplied with food by the women.    With the fighting men were large numbers of women, for these  generally accompanied the Britons on their warlike expeditions.  Just at sunset a shout arose from the tribesmen on the north side  of the village, and Boadicea, with her daughters and chief councillors,  drove into the village. Her mien was proud and lofty. She carried  a spear in her hand and a sword in her girdle. She had resumed  her royal ornaments, and a fillet of gold surrounded her head. Her  garments were belted in with a broad girdle of the same metal, and  she wore heavy gold armlets and bracelets. She looked with pride  upon the tribesmen who thronged shouting to greet her, and exclaimed  as she leapt from her chariot, \"The day of vengeance is at hand.\"    The fires blazed high all that night round Cardun. Numbers of  bards had accompanied the tribes, as not only had those who lived  in the households of the principal chiefs come in, but many had  been attracted from the country lying near their borders. At every  fire, therefore, songs were sung and tales told of the valour and  glory of the heroes of old. Mingled with these were laments over  the evil days that had befallen Britain, and exhortations to their  hearers to avenge the past and prove themselves worthy of their  ancestors.    In similar manner the night was passed in Parta's hall. Here the  chief bards were assembled, with all the tribal leaders, and vied  with each other in their stirring chants. Beric moved about among  the guests, seeing that their wants were supplied, while Parta  herself looked after those who were gathered on the dais. Beric  learned from the old chief Aska, who had first spoken to him on the  day of their arrival at the sacred oak, that all Britain was ripe  for the rising, and that messengers had been received not only from  the Brigantes, but from many of the southern and western tribes,  with assurances that they would rise as soon as they heard that  the Iceni had struck the first blow.    \"The Trinobantes will join us at Camalodunum. All goes well.  Suetonius, with the legions, is still in the far west. We shall  make an end of them here before he can return. By that time we shall  have been joined by most of the tribes, and shall have a force that  will be sufficient to destroy utterly the army he is leading. That  done, there will be but the isolated forts to capture and destroy,  and then Britain will be free from the invader. You think this will  be so, Beric?\"    \"I hope and trust so,\" Beric replied. \"I think that success in  our first undertakings is a certainty, and I trust we may defeat  Suetonius. With such numbers as we shall put in the field we ought  surely to be able to do so. It is not of the present I think so  much as of the future. Rome never submits to defeat, and will send  an army here to which that of Suetonius would be but a handful.  But if we remain united, and utilize the months that must elapse  before the Romans can arrive in preparing for the conflict, we  ought to be victorious.\"    \"You feel sure that the Romans will try to reconquer Britain?\"    \"Quite sure. In all their history there is not an instance where  they have submitted to defeat. This is one of the main reasons of  their success. I am certain that, at whatever sacrifices, they will  equip and send out an army that they will believe powerful enough  for the purpose.\"    \"But they were many years after their first invasion before they  came again.\"    \"That is true; but in those first two invasions they did not conquer.  In the first they were forced to retire, and therefore came again;  in the second they had success enough to be able to claim a victory  and so to retire with honour. Besides, Rome is vastly stronger and  more powerful now than she was then. Believe me, Aska, the struggle  will be but begun when we have driven the last Roman from the  island.\"    \"We must talk of this again,\" Aska said, \"as it is upon us that the  brunt of this struggle will fall. We shall have the chief voice and  influence after it is over, and Boadicea will stand in the place  that Cunobeline held, of chief king of the island. Then, as you  say, much will depend on the steps we take to prepare to resist the  next invasion; and young as you are, your knowledge of Roman ways  will render your counsels valuable, and give great weight to your  advice.\"    \"I do not wish to put myself in any way in the foreground,\" Beric  said. \"I am still but a boy, and have no wish to raise my voice  in the council of chiefs; but what I have learned of Roman history  and Roman laws I would gladly explain to those who, like yourself,  speak with the voice of authority, and whose wisdom all recognize.\"    In the morning Boadicea said that reports had been brought to her  of the manner in which Beric had been teaching the Sarci to fight  in Roman fashion, and that she should be glad to see the result.    Accordingly the tribesmen proceeded to the open fields a mile away,  where they had been accustomed to drill, and they were followed by  the whole of those gathered round the village. The queen and Parta  drove out in their chariots. When they reached the spot the chiefs  of the other tribes, at Beric's request, called upon their men to  draw off and leave a space sufficient for the exercises. This left  the Sarci standing in scattered groups over the open space, at one  end of which Boadicea and all the chiefs were gathered.    \"They are now in the position, queen,\" Beric said, \"of men unsuspecting  danger. I shall now warn them that they are about to be attacked,  and that they are to gather instantly to repel the enemy.\"    Taking the conch slung over his shoulder Beric applied it to his  lips and blew three short notes. The tribesmen ran together; there  was, as it seemed to the lookers on, a scene of wild confusion for  a minute, and then they were drawn up in companies, each a hundred  strong, in regular order. A short blast and a long one, and they  moved up together into a mass five deep; a single note, and the  spears fell, and an array of glistening points shone in front of  them.    A shout of surprise and approval rose from the tribesmen looking on.  To them this perfect order and regularity seemed well nigh miraculous.    Beric now advanced to the line. At his order the two rear ranks  stepped backwards a few feet, struck their spears in the ground,  and then discharged their javelins--of which each man carried  six--over the heads of the ranks in front, against the enemy supposed  to be advancing to attack them. Then seizing their spears they  fell into line again, and at another order the whole advanced at a  quick pace with levelled spears to the charge, and keeping on till  within a few paces of where the queen was standing, halted suddenly  and raised their spears. Again a roar of applause came from the  tribesmen.    \"It is wonderful,\" the queen said. \"I had not thought that men could"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/706"],[0,"The Amateur Cracksman (#16)"],[1,"had played Sister Ann until the faces in the street below were  no longer distinguishable. And now I was tearing to and fro in the grip  of horrible hypotheses--a grip that tightened when at last the  lift-gates opened with a clatter outside--that held me breathless until  a well-known tattoo followed on my door.    \"In the dark!\" said Raffles, as I dragged him in.  \"Why, Bunny, what's  wrong?\"    \"Nothing--now you've come,\" said I, shutting the door behind him in a  fever of relief and anxiety.  \"Well?  Well?  What did they fetch?\"    \"Five hundred.\"    \"Down?\"    \"Got it in my pocket.\"    \"Good man!\" I cried.  \"You don't know what a stew I've been in.  I'll  switch on the light.  I've been thinking of you and nothing else for  the last hour.  I--I was ass enough to think something had gone wrong!\"    Raffles was smiling when the white light filled the room, but for the  moment I did not perceive the peculiarity of his smile.  I was  fatuously full of my own late tremors and present relief; and my first  idiotic act was to spill some whiskey and squirt the soda-water all  over in my anxiety to do instant justice to the occasion.    \"So you thought something had happened?\" said Raffles, leaning back in  my chair as he lit a cigarette, and looking much amused.  \"What would  you say if something had?  Sit tight, my dear chap!  It was nothing of  the slightest consequence, and it's all over now.  A stern chase and a  long one, Bunny, but I think I'm well to windward this time.\"    And suddenly I saw that his collar was limp, his hair matted, his boots  thick with dust.    \"The police?\" I whispered aghast.    \"Oh, dear, no; only old Baird.\"    \"Baird!  But wasn't it Baird who took the emeralds?\"    \"It was.\"    \"Then how came he to chase you?\"    \"My dear fellow, I'll tell you if you give me a chance; it's really  nothing to get in the least excited about.  Old Baird has at last  spotted that I'm not quite the common cracksman I would have him think  me.  So he's been doing his best to run me to my burrow.\"    \"And you call that nothing!\"    \"It would be something if he had succeeded; but he has still to do  that.  I admit, however, that he made me sit up for the time being.  It  all comes of going on the job so far from home.  There was the old  brute with the whole thing in his morning paper.  He KNEW it must have  been done by some fellow who could pass himself off for a gentleman,  and I saw his eyebrows go up the moment I told him I was the man, with  the same old twang that you could cut with a paper-knife.  I did my  best to get out of it--swore I had a pal who was a real swell--but I  saw very plainly that I had given myself away.  He gave up haggling.  He paid my price as though he enjoyed doing it.  But I FELT him  following me when I made tracks; though, of course, I didn't turn round  to see.\"    \"Why not?\"    \"My dear Bunny, it's the very worst thing you can do.  As long as you  look unsuspecting they'll keep their distance, and so long as they keep  their distance you stand a chance.  Once show that you know you're  being followed, and it's flight or fight for all you're worth.  I never  even looked round; and mind you never do in the same hole.  I just  hurried up to Blackfriars and booked for High Street, Kensington, at  the top of my voice; and as the train was leaving Sloane Square out I  hopped, and up all those stairs like a lamplighter, and round to the  studio by the back streets.  Well, to be on the safe side, I lay low  there all the afternoon, hearing nothing in the least suspicious, and  only wishing I had a window to look through instead of that beastly  skylight.  However, the coast seemed clear enough, and thus far it was  my mere idea that he would follow me; there was nothing to show he had.  So at last I marched out in my proper rig--almost straight into old  Baird's arms!\"    \"What on earth did you do?\"    \"Walked past him as though I had never set eyes on him in my life, and  didn't then; took a hansom in the King's Road, and drove like the deuce  to Clapham Junction; rushed on to the nearest platform, without a  ticket, jumped into the first train I saw, got out at Twickenham,  walked full tilt back to Richmond, took the District to Charing Cross,  and here I am!  Ready for a tub and a change, and the best dinner the  club can give us. I came to you first, because I thought you might be  getting anxious.  Come round with me, and I won't keep you long.\"    \"You're certain you've given him the slip?\" I said, as we put on our  hats.    \"Certain enough; but we can make assurance doubly sure,\" said Raffles,  and went to my window, where he stood for a moment or two looking down  into the street.    \"All right?\" I asked him.    \"All right,\" said he; and we went downstairs forthwith, and so to the  Albany arm-in-arm.    But we were both rather silent on our way.  I, for my part, was  wondering what Raffles would do about the studio in Chelsea, whither,  at all events, he had been successfully dogged.  To me the point seemed  one of immediate importance, but when I mentioned it he said there was  time enough to think about that.  His one other remark was made after  we had nodded (in Bond Street) to a young blood of our acquaintance who  happened to be getting himself a bad name.    \"Poor Jack Rutter!\" said Raffles, with a sigh. \"Nothing's sadder than  to see a fellow going to the bad like that.  He's about mad with drink  and debt, poor devil!  Did you see his eye?  Odd that we should have  met him to-night, by the way; it's old Baird who's said to have skinned  him.  By God, but I'd like to skin old Baird!\"    And his tone took a sudden low fury, made the more noticeable by  another long silence, which lasted, indeed, throughout an admirable  dinner at the club, and for some time after we had settled down in a  quiet corner of the smoking-room with our coffee and cigars.  Then at  last I saw Raffles looking at me with his lazy smile, and I knew that  the morose fit was at an end.    \"I daresay you wonder what I've been thinking about all this time?\"  said he.  \"I've been thinking what rot it is to go doing things by  halves!\"    \"Well,\" said I, returning his smile, \"that's not a charge that you can  bring against yourself, is it?\"    \"I'm not so sure,\" said Raffles, blowing a meditative puff; \"as a  matter of fact, I was thinking less of myself than of that poor devil  of a Jack Rutter.  There's a fellow who does things by halves; he's  only half gone to the bad; and look at the difference between him and  us!  He's under the thumb of a villainous money-lender; we are solvent  citizens.  He's taken to drink; we're as sober as we are solvent.  His  pals are beginning to cut him; our difficulty is to keep the pal from  the door.  Enfin, he begs or borrows, which is stealing by halves; and  we steal outright and are done with it.  Obviously ours is the more  honest course.  Yet I'm not sure, Bunny, but we're doing the thing by  halves ourselves!\"    \"Why?  What more could we do?\" I exclaimed in soft derision, looking  round, however, to make sure that we were not overheard.    \"What more,\" said Raffles.  \"Well, murder--for one thing.\"    \"Rot!\"    \"A matter of opinion, my dear Bunny; I don't mean it for rot.  I've  told you before that the biggest man alive is the man who's committed a  murder, and not yet been found out; at least he ought to be, but he so  very seldom has the soul to appreciate himself.  Just think of it!  Think of coming in here and talking to the men, very likely about the  murder itself; and knowing you've done it; and wondering how they'd  look if THEY knew! Oh, it would be great, simply great!  But, besides  all that, when you were caught there'd be a merciful and dramatic end  of you.  You'd fill the bill for a few weeks, and then snuff out with a  flourish of extra-specials; you wouldn't rust with a vile repose for  seven or fourteen years.\"    \"Good old Raffles!\" I chuckled.  \"I begin to forgive you for being in  bad form at dinner.\"    \"But I was never more earnest in my life.\"    \"Go on!\"    \"I mean it.\"    \"You know very well that you wouldn't commit a murder, whatever else  you might do.\"    \"I know very well I'm going to commit one to-night!\"    He had been leaning back in the saddle-bag chair, watching me with keen  eyes sheathed by languid lids; now he started forward, and his eyes  leapt to mine like cold steel from the scabbard.  They struck home to  my slow wits; their meaning was no longer in doubt.  I, who knew the  man, read murder in his clenched hands, and murder in his locked lips,  but a hundred murders in those hard blue eyes.    \"Baird?\" I faltered, moistening my lips with my tongue.    \"Of course.\"    \"But you said it didn't matter about the room in Chelsea?\"    \"I told a lie.\"    \"Anyway you gave him the slip afterwards!\"    \"That was another.  I didn't.  I thought I had when I came up to you  this evening; but when I looked out of your window--you remember?  to  make assurance doubly sure--there he was on the opposite pavement down  below.\"    \"And you never said a word about it!\"    \"I wasn't going to spoil your dinner, Bunny, and I wasn't going to let  you spoil mine.  But there he was as large as life, and, of course, he  followed us to the Albany.  A fine game for him to play, a game after  his mean old heart: blackmail from me, bribes from the police, the one  bidding against the other; but he sha'n't play it with me, he sha'n't  live to, and the world will have an extortioner the less.  Waiter!  Two  Scotch whiskeys and sodas.  I'm off at eleven, Bunny; it's the only  thing to be done.\"    \"You know where he lives, then?\"    \"Yes, out Willesden way, and alone; the fellow's a miser among other  things.  I long ago found out all about him.\"    Again I looked round the room; it was a young man's club, and young men  were laughing, chatting, smoking, drinking, on every hand.  One nodded  to me through the smoke.  Like a machine I"]]]
