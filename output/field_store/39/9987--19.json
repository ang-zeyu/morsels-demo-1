He administered the  _coup de grace_ with the air of a John Roberts, and retired  triumphant; while the Charchester representatives pointed out that as  their score was at seventy-four, they had really won a moral victory by  four points. To which specious and unsportsmanlike piece of sophistry  Pringle turned a deaf ear.    It was now too late for any serious literary efforts. No bard can do  without his sleep. Even Homer used to nod at times. So Pringle  contented himself with reading through the poem, which consisted of  some thirty lines, and copying the same down on a sheet of notepaper  for future reference. After which he went to bed.    In order to arrive at Beckford in time for morning school, he had to  start from the house at eight o'clock punctually. This left little time  for poetical lights. The consequence was that when Lorimer, on the  following afternoon, demanded the poem as per contract, all that  Pringle had to show was the copy which he had made of the poem in the  book. There was a moment's suspense while Conscience and Sheer  Wickedness fought the matter out inside him, and then Conscience, which  had started on the encounter without enthusiasm, being obviously flabby  and out of condition, threw up the sponge.    'Here you are,' said Pringle, 'it's only a rough copy, but here it  _is_.'    Lorimer perused it hastily.    'But, I say,' he observed in surprised and awestruck tones, 'this is  rather good.'    It seemed to strike him as quite a novel idea. 'Yes, not bad, is it?'    'But it'll get the prize.'    'Oh, we shall have to prevent that somehow.'    He did not mention how, and Lorimer did not ask.    'Well, anyhow,' said Lorimer, 'thanks awfully. I hope you've not fagged  about it too much.'    'Oh no,' said Pringle airily, 'rather not. It's been no trouble at  all.'    He thus, it will be noticed, concluded a painful and immoral scene by  speaking perfect truth. A most gratifying reflection.          [12]    'WE, THE UNDERSIGNED--'      Norris kept his word with regard to the Bishop's exclusion from the  Eleven. The team which had beaten the O.B.s had not had the benefit of  his assistance, Lorimer appearing in his stead. Lorimer was a fast  right-hand bowler, deadly in House matches or on a very bad wicket. He  was the mainstay of the Second Eleven attack, and in an ordinary year  would have been certain of his First Eleven cap. This season, however,  with Gosling, Baynes, and the Bishop, the School had been unusually  strong, and Lorimer had had to wait.    The non-appearance of his name on the notice-board came as no surprise  to Gethryn. He had had the advantage of listening to Norris's views on  the subject. But when Marriott grasped the facts of the case, he went  to Norris and raved. Norris, as is right and proper in the captain of a  School team when the wisdom of his actions is called into question,  treated him with no respect whatever.    'It's no good talking,' he said, when Marriott had finished a brisk  opening speech, 'I know perfectly well what I'm doing.'    'Then there's no excuse for you at all,' said Marriott. 'If you were  mad or delirious I could understand it.'    'Come and have an ice,' said Norris.    'Ice!' snorted Marriott. 'What's the good of standing there babbling  about ices! Do you know we haven't beaten the O.B.s for four years?'    'We shall beat them this year.'    'Not without Gethryn.'    'We certainly shan't beat them with Gethryn, because he's not going to  play. A chap who chooses the day of the M.C.C. match to go off for the  afternoon, and then refuses to explain, can consider himself jolly well  chucked until further notice. Feel ready for that ice yet?'    'Don't be an ass.'    'Well, if ever you do get any ice, take my tip and tie it carefully  round your head in a handkerchief. Then perhaps you'll be able to see  why Gethryn isn't playing against the O.B.s on Saturday.'    And Marriott went off raging, and did not recover until late in the  afternoon, when he made eighty-three in an hour for Leicester's House  in a scratch game.    There were only three of the eleven Houses whose occupants seriously  expected to see the House cricket cup on the mantelpiece of their  dining-room at the end of the season. These were the School House,  Jephson's, and Leicester's. In view of Pringle's sensational feats  throughout the term, the knowing ones thought that the cup would go to  the School House, with Leicester's runners-up. The various members of  the First Eleven were pretty evenly distributed throughout the three  Houses. Leicester's had Gethryn, Reece, and Marriott. Jephson's relied  on Norris, Bruce, and Baker. The School House trump card was Pringle,  with Lorimer and Baynes to do the bowling, and Hill of the First Eleven  and Kynaston and Langdale of the second to back him up in the batting  department. Both the other First Eleven men were day boys.    The presence of Gosling in any of the House elevens, however weak on  paper, would have lent additional interest to the fight for the cup;  for in House matches, where every team has more or less of a tail, one  really good fast bowler can make a surprising amount of difference to a  side.    There was a great deal of interest in the School about the House cup.  The keenest of all games at big schools are generally the House  matches. When Beckford met Charchester or any of the four schools which  it played at cricket and football, keenness reached its highest pitch.  But next to these came the House matches.    Now that he no longer played for the Eleven, the Bishop was able to  give his whole mind to training the House team in the way it should go.  Exclusion from the First Eleven meant also that he could no longer,  unless possessed of an amount of _sang-froid_ so colossal as  almost to amount to genius, put in an appearance at the First Eleven  net. Under these circumstances Leicester's net summoned him. Like Mr  Phil May's lady when she was ejected (with perfect justice) by a  barman, he went somewhere where he would be respected. To the House,  then, he devoted himself, and scratch games and before-breakfast  field-outs became the order of the day.    House fielding before breakfast is one of the things which cannot be  classed under the head of the Lighter Side of Cricket. You get up in  the small hours, dragged from a comfortable bed by some sportsman who,  you feel, carries enthusiasm to a point where it ceases to be a virtue  and becomes a nuisance. You get into flannels, and, still half asleep,  stagger off to the field, where a hired ruffian hits you up catches  which bite like serpents and sting like adders. From time to time he  adds insult to injury by shouting 'get to 'em!', 'get to 'em!'--a  remark which finds but one parallel in the language, the 'keep moving'  of the football captain. Altogether there are many more pleasant  occupations than early morning field-outs, and it requires a  considerable amount of keenness to carry the victim through them  without hopelessly souring his nature and causing him to foster  uncharitable thoughts towards his House captain.    J. Monk of Leicester's found this increased activity decidedly  uncongenial. He had no real patriotism in him. He played cricket well,  but he played entirely for himself.    If, for instance, he happened to make fifty in a match--and it happened  fairly frequently--he vastly preferred that the rest of the side should  make ten between them than that there should be any more half-centuries  on the score sheet, even at the expense of losing the match. It was not  likely, therefore, that he would take kindly to this mortification of  the flesh, the sole object of which was to make everybody as  conspicuous as everybody else. Besides, in the matter of fielding he  considered that he had nothing to learn, which, as Euclid would say,  was absurd. Fielding is one of the things which is never perfect.    Monk, moreover, had another reason for disliking the field-outs.  Gethryn, as captain of the House team, was naturally master of the  ceremonies, and Monk objected to Gethryn. For this dislike he had solid  reasons. About a fortnight after the commencement of term, the Bishop,  going downstairs from his study one afternoon, was aware of what  appeared to be a species of free fight going on in the doorway of the  senior day-room. The senior day-room was where the rowdy element of the  House collected, the individuals who were too old to be fags, and too  low down in the School to own studies.    Under ordinary circumstances the Bishop would probably have passed on  without investigating the matter. A head of a house hates above all  things to get a name for not minding his own business in unimportant  matters. Such a reputation tells against him when he has to put his  foot down over big things. To have invaded the senior day-room and  stopped a conventional senior day-room 'rag' would have been  interfering with the most cherished rights of the citizens, the freedom  which is the birthright of every Englishman, so to speak.    But as he passed the door which had just shut with a bang behind the  free fighters, he heard Monk's voice inside, and immediately afterwards  the voice of Danvers, and he stopped. In the first place, he reasoned  within himself, if Monk and Danvers were doing anything, it was  probably something wrong, and ought to be stopped. Gethryn always had  the feeling that it was his duty to go and see what Monk and Danvers  were doing, and tell them they mustn't. He had a profound belief in  their irreclaimable villainy. In the second place, having studies of  their own, they had no business to be in the senior day-room at all. It  was contrary to the etiquette of the House for a study man to enter the  senior day-room, and as a rule the senior day-room resented it.

The perfection of ventilation is reached when the air of a room is as pure  as that out of doors. To accomplish this result, it is necessary to allow  for each person six hundred cubic feet of space, while ventilation is  still going on in the best manner known.    In spite of these well-known facts, scarcely any pains are taken to supply  fresh air, while the doors and windows where the life-giving oxygen might  creep in are hermetically stopped.    How often is this true of the sick room. Yet here the danger of bad air is  intensified. The expired breath of the patient is peculiarly threatening  to himself as well as to others. Nature is seeking to throw off the poison  of the disease. The scavengers of the body are all at work. The breath and  the insensible perspiration are loaded with impurities. [Footnote: The  floating dust in the air, revealed to us by the sunbeam shining through a  crack in the blinds, shows the abundance of these impurities, and also the  presence of germs which, lodging in the lungs, may implant disease, unless  thrown off by a vigorous constitution. \"On uncovering a scarlet fever  patient, a cloud of fine dust is seen to rise from the body--contagious  dust, that for days will retain its poisonous properties.\"--YOUMANS. (See  p. 300.)] The odor is oftentimes exceedingly offensive. Sick and well  alike need an abundance of fresh air. But, too often, it is the only want  not supplied.    Our sitting rooms, heated by furnaces or red-hot stoves, generally have no  means of ventilation, or, if provided, they are seldom used. A window is  occasionally dropped to give a little relief, as if pure air were a  rarity, and must be doled out to the suffering lungs in morsels, instead  of full and constant draughts. The inmates are starved by scanty lung  food, and stupefied by foul air. The process goes on year by year. The  weakened and poisoned body at last succumbs to disease, while we, in our  blindness and ignorance, talk of the mysterious Providence which thus  untimely cuts down the brightest intellects. The truth is, death is often  simply the penalty for violating nature's laws. Bad air begets disease;  disease begets death.    In our churches, the foul air left by the congregation on Sunday is shut  up during the week, and heated for the next Lord's day, when the people  assemble to rebreathe the polluted atmosphere. They are thus forced, with  every breath they take, to violate the physical laws of Him whom they meet  to worship,--laws written not three thousand years ago upon Mount Sinai on  tables of stone, but to-day engraved in the constitution of their own  living, breathing bodies. On brains benumbed and starving for oxygen, the  purest truth and the highest eloquence fall with little force.    We sleep in a small bedroom from which every breath of fresh air is  excluded, because we believe night air to be unhealthy, [Footnote: There  is a singular prejudice against the night air. Yet, as Florence  Nightingale aptly says, what other air can we breathe at night? We then  have the choice between foul air within and pure air without. For, in  large cities especially, the night air is far more wholesome than that of  the daytime. To secure fresh air at night, we must open the windows of our  bedroom.] and so we breathe its dozen hogsheads of air over and over  again, and then wonder why we awaken in the morning so dull and  unrefreshed! Return to our room after inhaling the fresh, morning air, and  the fetid odor we meet on opening the door, is convincing proof how we  have poisoned our lungs during the night.    Each room should be supplied with two thousand feet of fresh air per hour  for every person it contains. Our ingenuity ought to find some way of  doing this advantageously and pleasantly. A moiety of the care we devote  to delicate articles of food, drink, and dress would abundantly meet this  prime necessity of our bodies.    Open the windows a little at the top and the bottom. Put on plenty of  clothing to keep warm by day and by night, and then let the inspiring  oxygen come in as freely as God has given it. Pure air is the cheapest  necessity and luxury of life. Let it not be the rarest!    SCHOOLROOM VENTILATION.--Who, on going from the open air of a clear,  bracing winter's day, into a crowded schoolroom, late in the session, has  not noticed the disagreeable odor, and been for a moment nauseated and  half stifled by the oppressive atmosphere! It is not strange. See how many  causes here combine to pollute the air. If the room is heated by a stove,  quantities of carbonic-oxide and carbonic-acid gases, as well as other  products of combustion, driven by downward drafts in the flue, escape  through seams and cracks and the occasionally opened door of the stove. In  the case of a furnace, the same effect is too often experienced, and the  odor of coal gas is a common one, especially when the fire is replenished.  The insensible perspiration is more active in children than in adults;  they, moreover, rush in with their clothing saturated with the  perspiration induced by their sports; so that, on the average, each pupil,  during school hours, loads the air with about half a pint of aqueous  vapor. The children come, oftentimes, from homes that are close, ill-  ventilated, and uncleanly; and frequently from sick rooms, bringing in  their clothing the germs of disease. (See p. 304.) Some of the pupils may  even bear traces of illness, or have unsound organs, and so their breath  and exhalations be poisonous.    In addition to all this, the air is filled with dust brought in and kept  astir by many busy feet; with ashes floating from the stove or furnace;  and especially with chalk dust. The modern method of teaching requires a  large amount of blackboard work, and the air of the schoolroom is thus  loaded with chalk particles. These collect in the nasal passages, and the  upper part of the larynx, and irritate the membrane, perhaps laying the  foundation of catarrh.    The usual schoolroom atmosphere bears in the pupils the natural fruit of  frequent headaches, inattention, weariness, and stupor; but in the teacher  its frightful influence is most apparent. His labor is severe, his worry  of mind is constant, and, when he finishes his day's work, he is generally  too tired to take proper physical exercise. He consequently labors on with  impaired health, or is forced to abandon his profession.    Instead of six hundred feet of space being allowed for each pupil, as  perfect ventilation demands--the lowest estimate being two hundred and  fifty feet--often not over one hundred feet are afforded. Instead of two  thousand cubic feet of fresh air being supplied every hour for each  person, and as much foul air removed, which, all physiologists assert, is  needed for perfect health, perhaps no means of ventilation at all are  provided, and none is secured except what an occasionally opened door, or  the benevolent cracks and chinks in the building furnish the suffering  lungs. [Footnote: Imagine fifty pupils put into a class room thirty feet  long, twenty-five feet wide, and ten feet high. This would generally be  considered a very liberal provision. Such a room contains seven thousand  five hundred cubic feet of air. But it furnishes only one hundred and  fifty feet of space for each pupil. Allowing ten cubic feet of air per  pupil each minute, in fifteen minutes after assembling, the entire  atmosphere of the room is tainted, and unfit to be rebreathed. The demand  of health is that at least one thousand five hundred cubic feet of pure  air should be admitted into this room every minute, and as much be  removed.]    HOW SHALL WE VENTILATE?--The usual method of ventilation depends upon the  fact that hot air is lighter than cold air, and so the cold air tends, by  the force of gravity, to fall and compel the warm air to rise. Thus, if we  open the door of a heated room, and hold a lighted candle first at the  top, and then at the bottom, we can see, by the deflection of the flame,  that there is a current of air setting outward at the top, and another  setting inward at the bottom of the opening. A handkerchief held loosely,  or the smoke of a smoldering match, in front of a fireplace will show a  current of air passing up the chimney; this is caused by the difference of  temperature between the air in the room and the outside atmosphere.  _Upon this difference of temperature, all ordinary ventilation is  based_. [Footnote: Public buildings are sometimes ventilated by  mechanical means, _i. e._, immense fans which are turned by  machinery, and thus set the air in motion. Such methods are, however,  expensive, and rarely adopted, except where power is also used for other  purposes.] A proper treatment of this subject and its practical  applications, would require a book by itself. There is room here for only  a few general statements and suggestions.    1. Two openings are always necessary to produce a thorough change of air.  (See \"Popular Chemistry,\" p. 70.) Put a lighted candle in a bottle. The  flame will soon be extinguished. The oxygen of the little air in the  bottle is burned out, and carbonic acid has taken its place. Now place  over the mouth of the bottle a lamp chimney, and insert in the chimney a  strip of cardboard, thus dividing the passage. On relighting the candle,  it will burn freely. The smoke of a bit of smoldering paper will show that  two opposite currents of air are established, one setting into the bottle,  the other outward.    2. In the winter, when our schoolrooms, churches, public halls, etc., are  heated artificially, ventilation is comparatively easy if properly  arranged. [Footnote: For the escape of bad air, Dr. Bell suggests that an  efficient foul-air shaft may be fitted to the commonest of stoves by  simply inclosing the stovepipe in a jacket--that is, in a pipe two or  three inches"]]]
