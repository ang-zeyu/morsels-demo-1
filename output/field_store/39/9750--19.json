(#16)"],[1," was first  noticed, and it was long supposed that the wanderings to which the  little colony was thus subjected were necessary for its healthy  development. But subsequent observations have shown that it attaches  itself quite as frequently to the solid rock as to these nomadic  shells. It has a rosy color, and, being very small, it looks, until  one examines it closely, more like a thick red carpet of soft moss,  than like a colony of animals. These communities are distinct in sex,  the fertile individuals in each being either all male or all female.  In Fig. 100 we have a portion of a female colony, representing one  fertile head, in which the buds are crowded with Medusae; one sterile  head, surrounded by its wreath of tentacles; and still another member  of the society whose office is not fully understood, unless it be that  of a kind of purveyor, catching food for the rest. Fig. 101 represents  the corresponding individuals taken from a male colony. The sex makes  little difference in the appearance of the reproductive heads. All the  individuals of a Hydractinia colony are connected at the base by a  horny network, rising occasionally into points of a conical or  cylindrical shape. This polymorphism among the Tubularians is another  evidence of the relation between the Siphonophorae, or floating  Hydroids, and the fixed Hydroids.        [Illustration: Fig. 100.

(_Agassiz_.)]      _Hybocodon_. (_Hybocodon prolifer_ AG.)    Among our Medusae derived from a Tubularian stock is the Hybocodon,  viz. the hunchbacked Medusa (Fig. 102), a singular little Jelly-fish,  odd and unsymmetrical in shape, as its name indicates, and interesting  from its relations to one of our floating communities, the Nanomia,  presently to be described. Instead of the evenly proportioned bell of  the ordinary Medusae, the Hybocodon has a one-sided outline (Fig. 102),  one large tentacle only being fully developed, while the others remain  always abortive, so that the whole weight of the structure is thrown  on one half of the bell. Upon this large tentacle small Jelly-fishes,  similar to the original, are produced by budding, this process going  on till ten or twelve such Jelly-fishes (Fig. 103) may be seen  suspended from the tentacle. Up to this time it has remained connected  with the Hydroid from which it arises, a rather large Tubularian,  usually growing singly (Fig. 104), and of a deep orange-red in color.  But at this stage of its existence it frees itself, and leads an  independent life hereafter, swimming about with a quick, darting  motion. In the account of the Nanomia, the homology between its scale,  or abortive Medusa, and the Hybocodon, is traced in detail, and I need  only allude to it here. Though this Medusa is so peculiar in  appearance, the Tubularian from which it is derived is very like the  _Tubularia Couthouyi_, already described. This is one of the instances  before alluded to, in which closely allied forms give rise to very  dissimilar ones, or, as in many cases, the very reverse of this takes  place, and closely allied forms arise from very dissimilar ones.        [Illustration: Fig. 102. Unsymmetrical free Medusa of Hybocodon;      _r_ _o_ chymiferous tubes, _v_ proboscis, _s_ circular tube, _m_      young Medusae at base of long tentacle _t_.

(_Dysmorphosa fulgurans_ A. AG.)    Besides the budding at the base of the tentacle, as in Hybocodon, we  find another mode of development among Hydroid Medusae, viz. that of  budding from the proboscis. One of our most common little  Jelly-fishes, the Dysmorphosa (Fig. 105), to which we owe the  occasional blue phosphorescence of the sea, so brilliant at times,  buds in this manner. Fig. 105 represents an adult Dysmorphosa, on the  proboscis of which may be seen three small buds in different stages of  development. In Fig. 106 the proboscis is more enlarged, showing one  of the little Jelly-fishes similar to the parent, just ready to drop  off. We need not wonder at the immense number of these animals, with  which the sea actually swarms at times, when we know that as fast as  they are dropped, and it takes but a few days to complete their  development, they each begin the same process; so that in the course  of a week or ten days one such Medusa, supposing it to have produced  six buds only, will have given rise to forty-two Jelly-fishes,  thirty-six of which may be equally prolific in the same short period.  These Medusae budding thus, and swimming about, carrying their young  with them, bear such a close resemblance to the floating communities  of Hydroids formerly known as Siphonophorae, that did we not know that  some of them arise from Tubularians, it would be natural to associate  them with the Siphonophorae.        [Illustration: Fig. 105. Dysmorphosa seen in profile; magnified.]        [Illustration: Fig. 106. Magnified proboscis of Dysmorphosa with      young Medusae budding from it.]      _Nanomia_. (_Nanomia cara_ A. AG.)    The Nanomia (Fig. 115), our free floating Hydroid, consists, when  first formed, of a single Hydra containing an oblong oil bubble (Fig.  107). The whole organisation of such a Hydra is limited to a simple  digestive cavity; it has, in fact, but one organ, and one function,  and consists of an alimentary sac resembling the proboscis of a Medusa  (Fig. 107); the oil bubble is separated from it by a transverse  partition, and has no connection with the cavity. Presently, between  the oil bubble and the cavity arise a number of buds of various  character (Fig. 108), which we will describe one by one, beginning  with those nearest the oil bubble, since these upper members of the  little swimming community bear a very important part in its history.  The infant community (Fig. 108) passes rapidly into the stage  represented in Fig. 109, and then through all the stages intermediate  between this and the adult, shown in its natural size in Fig. 115. The  upper buds enlarge gradually, and soon take upon themselves a perfect  Medusa structure (Fig. 110), with the exception of the proboscis, the  absence of which is easily understood, when we find that these Medusae,  serve the purpose of locomotion only, having no share in the function  of feeding the community, so that a digestive apparatus would be quite  superfluous for them. In every other respect they are perfect Medusae,  attached to the Hydra as the Medusa buds always are when first formed,  having the (four) chymiferous tubes, characteristic of all Hydroid  Medusae, radiating from the centre to the periphery; two of these tubes  are very winding, as may be seen in Fig. 110, while the other pair are  straight. The Medusae themselves are heart-shaped in form, depressed at  the centre of the upper surface, and bulging on either side into  wing-like expansions, where they join the stem. These expansions  interlock with one another, crossing nearly at right angles. The  Medusae-like buds are the swimming bells; by their contractions,  alternately taking in and throwing out the water, they impel the whole  community forward, so that it seems rather to move like one animal,  than like a combination of individuals.        [Illustration: Fig. 107. Young Nanomia; magnified.]        [Illustration: Fig, 108. Young Nanomia with rudimentary Medusae.]        [Illustration: Fig. 109. Young Nanomia, older than Fig. 108.]        [Illustration: Fig. 110. Heart-shaped swimming bell of Nanomia;      magnified.]    Besides these locomotive members, the community contains three kinds  of Hydrae arising as buds from the primitive Hydra below the swimming  bells, the latter remaining always nearest the oil bubble at the top,  while the first Hydra, the founder of the community, in proportion as  the new individuals are added, is gradually pushed downward, and  remains always at the end of the string, the stem of which is formed  by the elongated neck of the primitive Hydra. All the three sets of  Hydrae have certain features in common, while they have other  distinguishing characteristics marking them as distinct individuals.  They are all accompanied by triangular shields (Fig. 111), arising  with them at the same point on the parent stem, and all are furnished  with tentacles hanging down from the summit of the Hydra at the side  opposite the shield. These facts are important to remember, since we  shall presently perceive, upon analyzing their parts, that these Hydrae  have a close homology to the Hybocodon. The tentacles differ in  structure as well as in number for each kind of Hydra. Having shown in  what characters they agree, let us now take each set individually, and  see what differences they present.        [Illustration: Fig. 111. Cluster of Medusae with tentacles having      pendent knobs.]    In the first set which we will examine the Hydra is open-mouthed. Like  the original Hydra, it is only a digestive tube, similar in all  respects to the proboscis of a Medusa-disk. Its only function is that  of feeding, and it shows a laudable fidelity to its calling, being  very constantly and earnestly engaged in the work. Let us add,  however, that in this"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35514"],[0,"The Great Apostasy, Considered in the Light of Scriptural and Secular History (#16)"],[1," been my method, with respect to  those who were brought before me as Christians. I asked them whether  they were Christians: if they pleaded guilty, I interrogated then  twice afresh with a menace of capital punishment. In case of obstinate  perseverance I ordered them to be executed. For of this I had no  doubt, whatever was the nature of their religion, that a sudden and  obstinate inflexibility called for the vengeance of the magistrate.  Some were infected with the same madness, whom, on account of their  privilege of citizenship, I reserved to be sent to Rome, to be  referred to your tribunal. In the course of this business,  informations pouring in, as is usual when they are encouraged, more  cases occurred. An anonymous libel was exhibited, with a catalogue of  names of persons, who yet declared that they were not Christians then,  nor ever had been; and they repeated after me an invocation of the  gods and of your image, which, for this purpose, I had ordered to be  brought with the images of the deities. They performed sacred rites  with wine and frankincense, and execrated Christ,--none of which  things I am told a real Christian can ever be compelled to do. On this  account I dismissed them. Others named by an informer, first affirmed,  and then denied the charge of Christianity; declaring that they had  been Christians, but had ceased to be so some three years ago, others  even longer, some even twenty years ago. All of them worshiped your  image, and the statues of the gods, and also execrated Christ. And  this was the account which they gave of the nature of the religion  they had once professed, whether it deserves the name of crime or  error,--namely--that they were accustomed on a stated day to meet  before daylight, and to repeat among themselves a hymn to Christ as to  a god, and to bind themselves by an oath, with an obligation of not  committing any wickedness;--but on the contrary, of abstaining from  thefts, robberies, and adulteries;--also of not violating their  promise or denying a pledge;--after which it was their custom to  separate, and to meet again at a promiscuous harmless meal, from which  last practice they however desisted, after the publication of my  edict, in which, agreeably to your order, I forbade any societies of  that sort. On which account I judged it the more necessary to inquire,  by torture, from two females, who were said to be deaconesses, what is  the real truth. But nothing could I collect except a depraved and  excessive superstition. Deferring, therefore, any further  investigation, I determined to consult you. For the number of culprits  is so great as to call for serious consultation. Many persons are  informed against of every age and of both sexes; and more still will  be in the same situation. The contagion of the superstition hath  spread not only through cities, but even villages and the country. Not  that I think it impossible to check and correct it. The success of my  endeavors hitherto forbids such desponding thoughts; for the temples,  almost once desolate, begin to be frequented, and the sacred  solemnities, which had long been intermitted, are now attended afresh;  and the sacrificial victims are now sold everywhere, which once could  scarcely find a purchaser. Whence I conclude that many might be  reclaimed were the hope of impunity, on repentance, absolutely  confirmed.\"    The emperor's reply follows:    \"_Trajan to Pliny_:    \"You have done perfectly right, my dear Pliny, in the inquiry which  you have made concerning Christians. For truly no one general rule can  be laid down, which will apply itself to all cases. These people must  not be sought after. If they are brought before you and convicted, let  them be capitally punished, yet with this restriction, that if any one  renounce Christianity, and evidence his sincerity by supplicating our  gods, however suspected he may be for the past, he shall obtain pardon  for the future, on his repentance. But anonymous libels in no case  ought to be attended to; for the precedent would be of the worst sort,  and perfectly incongruous to the maxims of my government.\"          CHAPTER VI.    **Causes of the Apostasy.--Internal Causes**.      1. The cruel persecution to which the adherents of Christianity and  the Church as an organized body were subjected during the first three  centuries of our era have been treated as external causes,  contributing at least indirectly to the general apostasy. Details of  Judaistic and heathen opposition have been given with sufficient  fulness to show that the unpopular Church had a troubled existence,  and that such of its members as remained faithful to the tenets and  principles of the gospel were martyrs in spirit if not in fact.    2. As would naturally be expected, the immediate effect of persistent  persecution on those who professed a belief in the divinity of the  Lord Jesus was diverse and varied; indeed it ranged from unrestrained  enthusiasm expressed in frenzied clamoring for martyrdom, to ready and  abject apostasy with ostentatious display of devotion in idolatrous  service.    3. Many of the Christian devotees developed a zeal amounting to mania,  and, disregarding all prudence and discretion, gloried in the prospect  of winning the martyr's crown. Some who had been left unassailed felt  themselves aggrieved, and became their own accusers; while others  openly committed acts of aggression with intent to bring resentment  upon themselves.--(See Note 1, end of chapter.) These extravagances  were doubtless encouraged by the excessive veneration accorded the  memories and the bodily remains of those who had fallen as victims in  the cause. The reverential respect so rendered developed later into  the impious practice of martyr worship.    4. Commenting on the imprudent enthusiasm of the early Christians,  Gibbon says: \"The Christians sometimes supplied by their voluntary  declaration the want of an accuser, rudely disturbed the public  service of paganism, and, rushing in crowds round the tribunal of the  magistrates, called upon them to pronounce and to inflict the sentence  of the law. The behavior of the Christians was too remarkable to  escape the notice of the ancient philosophers; but they seem to have  received it with much less admiration than astonishment. Incapable of  conceiving the motives which sometimes transported the fortitude of  believers beyond the bounds of prudence and reason, they treated such  an eagerness to die as the strange result of obstinate despair, of  stupid insensibility or of superstitious frenzy.\"--(Gibbon, \"Decline  and Fall of the Roman Empire,\" ch. XVI.)    5. But there is another side to the picture. While imprudent zealots  invited dangers from which they might have remained exempt, others,  affrighted at the possibility of being included among the victims,  voluntarily deserted the Church and returned to heathen allegiances.  Milner, speaking of conditions existing in the third century, and  incorporating the words of Cyprian, bishop of Carthage, who lived at  the time of the incident described, says: \"Vast numbers lapsed into  idolatry immediately. Even before men were accused as Christians, many  ran to the forum and sacrificed to the gods as they were ordered; and  the crowds of apostates were so great, that the magistrates wished to  delay numbers of them till the next day, but they were importuned by  the wretched suppliants to be allowed to prove themselves heathens  that very night.\"--(Milner, \"Church History,\" Cent. III, ch. 8.)    6. In connection with this individual apostasy of Church members under  the pressure of persecution, there arose among the provincial  governors a practice of selling certificates or \"libels\" as these  documents were called, which \"attested that the persons therein  mentioned had complied with the laws and sacrificed to the Roman  deities. By producing these false declarations, the opulent and timid  Christians were enabled to silence the malice of an informer, and to  reconcile, in some measure, their safety with their religion.\"--  (Gibbon, \"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,\" ch. XVI.) A  modification of this practice of quasi-apostasy consisted in procuring  testimonials from persons of standing certifying that the holders had  abjured the gospel; these documents were presented to the heathen  magistrates, and they, on receipt of a specified fee, granted  exemption from the requirement of sacrificing to the pagan gods.--(See  Milner, \"Church History,\" Cent. III, ch. 9.) As a result of these  practices, whereby under favorable circumstances the wealthy could  purchase immunity from persecution, and at the same time maintain a  semblance of standing in the Church, much dissension arose, the  question being as to whether those who had thus shown their weakness  could ever be received again into communion with the Church.    7. Persecution at most was but an indirect cause of the decline of  Christianity and the perversion of the saving principles of the gospel  of Christ. The greater and more immediate dangers threatening the  Church must be sought within the body itself. Indeed, the pressure of  opposition from without served to restrain the bubbling springs of  internal dissension, and actually delayed the more destructive  eruptions of schism and heresy.--(See Note 2, end of chapter.) A  general review of the history of the Church down to the end of the  third century shows that the periods of comparative peace were periods  of weakness and decline in spiritual earnestness, and that with the  return of persecution came an awakening and a renewal in Christian  devotion. Devout leaders of the people were not backward in declaring  that each recurring period of persecution was a time of natural and  necessary chastisement for the sin and corruption that had gained  headway within the Church.--(See Note 3, end of chapter.)    8.
