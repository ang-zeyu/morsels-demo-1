Built originally for a great keep, or, as it were, breakwater,  to stem the rush of barbarian seas which were wont to come storming down  from the north-west, its constructors had aimed at nothing less than its  everlastingness.  So thick were its bastioned walls, so thick the  curtains which divided its inner and outer wards, a whole warren of  human 'runs' could honeycomb without appreciably weakening them.  Hidden  within its screens and massy towers, like the gnawings of a foul and  intricate cancer, ran dark passages which discharged themselves here and  there into dreadful dungeons, or secret-places not guessed at in the  common tally of its rooms.  These oubliettes were hideous with blotched  and spotted memories; rotten with the dew of suffering; eloquent in  their terror and corruption and darkness, of that same self-sick,  self-blinded tyranny which, in place of Love and Justice, the trusty  bodyguards, must turn always to cruelty and thick walls for its  security.  The hiss and purr of subterranean fire, the grinding of  low-down grated jaws, the flop and echo of stagnant water, oozed from a  stagnant moat into vermin-swarming, human-haunted cellars,--these were  sounds that spoke even less of grief to others than of the hellish  ferment in the soul of him who had raised them for his soul's pacifying.  Himself is for ever the last and maddest victim of a despot's  oppression.    There had been stories to tell, could the coulter of Time once have cut  into those far-down vaults, and his share laid open.  Now this was so  far from promising, that their history and mystery were in process of  being still further overlaid and stifled under accumulations of  superstructure.  Francesco, the great Condottiere, the present Duke's  father, had been the first to realise dimly how a tyrant, by converting  his self-prison into a shrine for his aestheticism, might enjoy a  certain amelioration of his condition.  It was he who, yielding an older  palace and its grounds to the builders of the cathedral, had transferred  the ducal quarters to the great fortress, which henceforth was to be the  main seat of the Sforzas.  Here the first additions and rebuildings had  been his, the first decorations and beautifyings--tentative at the best,  for he was always more a soldier than a connoisseur.  The real movement  was inaugurated by his successor, and continued, as cultivation was  impressed on him, on a scale of magnificence which was presently to make  the splendour of Milan a proverb.  Galeazzo, an indifferent warrior, to  whose rule but a tithe of the territory once gathered to the Visconti  owned allegiance, contented his ambitions by rallying an army of  painters and sculptors and decorators to the glorification of his houses  at Milan, Cremona, and his ancestral petted Pavia,--after all a worthier  role than the conqueror's for a good man; but then, this man was so bad  that he blighted everything he touched.  It is true that the disuse of  secret torture would have been considered, and by men more enlightened  than he, so little expedient a part of any ethical or aesthetical  'improvement' of an existing house, as that a premium would be put  thereby on assassination. Yet Galeazzo's death-pits were never so much a  politic necessity as a resource for cruelty in idleness.  He would  descend into them with as much relish as he would reclimb from, to his  halls above, swelling and bourgeoning with growth of loveliness.  The  scream of torture was as grateful to his ears as was the love-throb of a  viol; the scum bubbling from his living graves as poignant to his  nostrils as was the scent of floating lilies.  He continued to make his  house beautiful, yet never once dreamt, as a first principle of its  reclamation to sweetness, of cutting out of its foundations those old  cesspools of disease and death.    One night he sat in his closet of the Rocca, a little four-square room  dug out of the armourer's tower, and having a small oratory adjoining.  This eyrie was so high up as to give a comfortable sense of security  against surprise.  There was but one window to it--just a deep wedge in  the wall, piercing to the sheer flank of the tower.  Sweet rushes  carpeted the floor; the arras was pictured with dim, sacred  subjects--Ambrosius in his cradle, with the swarm of bees settling on  his honeyed lips; Ambrosius elected Bishop of Milan by the people;  Ambrosius imposing penance on Theodosius for his massacre of the  Thessalonicans--and the drowsy odours of a pastile, burning in the  little purple shrine-lamp, robbed the air of its last freshness.    Another lamp shone on a table, at which the Duke was seated somewhat  preoccupied with a lute, and his tablets propped before him; while,  motionless in the shadows opposite, stood the figure of the provost  marshal, its fixed, unregarding eyes glinting in the flame.    Intermittently Galeazzo strummed and murmured, self-communing, or  addressing himself, between playfulness and abstraction, to the ear of  Messer Jacopo:--    '_The lowliest of all Franciscans was St. Francis, meek mate of beasts  and birds, boasting himself no peer of belted stars_....  Ha! a good  line, Jacopo, a full significant line; I dare say it, our Parablist  despite.  Listen.'  (He chaunted the words in a harsh, uncertain voice,  to an accompaniment as sorry.)  'Hear'st?  Belted stars--those  moon-ringed spheres the aristocracy of the night. Could Messer Bembo  himself have better improvised? What think'st?  Be frank.'    'I think of improvising by book,' said Jacopo, short and gruff.    Galeazzo said 'Ha!' again, like a snarl, and his brow contracted.    'Why, thou unconscionable old surly dog!' he said--'why?'    Jacopo pointed to the tablets.    'Your saint asks no notes to _his_ piping.  A' sings like the birds.'    'Now,' answered his master, in a deep, offended tone, 'I'm in a mind to  make _thee_ sing on a grill,--ay, and dance too.  What, dolt! are not  first thoughts first thoughts, however they may be pricked down?  Look  at this, I say; flatten thy bull nose on it.  Is it not clean,  untouched, unrevised?  Spotless as when issued from Helicon?  Beast!  thou shalt call me, too, an improvisatore.'    The statue was silent.  Galeazzo sat glaring and gnawing his fingers.    'Answer!' he screeched suddenly.    'I will call thee one,' said Jacopo obstinately, 'but not the best.'    The Duke fell back in his chair, then presently was muttering and  strumming with his disengaged fingers on the table.    'No--not the best, not the best--not to rival heaven! Yet, perhaps, it  should be the Duke's privilege.'    The executioner laughed a little.    'The Duke should know how to take it.'    Galeazzo stopped short, quite vacant, staring at him.    'I've heard tell,' said Jacopo, 'how one Nero, a fiddling emperor, came  to be acknowledged first fiddle of all.'    He paused, then answered, it seemed, an unspoken invitation: 'He just  silenced the better ones.'    Galeazzo got hurriedly to his feet.    'Blasphemer! thou shalt die for the word.  What! this Lord's anointed!  A natural songster! no art, no culture in his voice--sweet and wild,  above human understanding.  I said nothing.  Be damned, and damned  alone!  Go hang thyself like Judas!'    'Well, name my successor first,' said Jacopo.    The Duke leapt, and with one furious blow shattered his lute to  splinters on the other's steel headpiece, then stamped upon the  fragments, his arms flapping like wing stumps, his teeth sputtering a  foam of inarticulate words. Jacopo, erect under the avalanche, stood  perfectly silent and impassive.  Then, as suddenly as it had burst, the  storm ended.  Galeazzo sank back on his seat, panting and nerveless.    'Well, I am no poet--curse thy block head, and mine for trusting to  it--the Muses shall decide--Apollo or Marsyas--the Christian Muses and a  Christian penance--flaying only for heretics.  I am no poet nor  musician, say'st?  Calf! what know'st thou about such things?'  He  roared again: 'What brings thee here, with thy damned butcher's face,  scaring my pretty lambs of song?'    'Thine order.'    'Mine?'    'This astrologer monk, this Fra Capello was it not? I neither know nor  care.'    'Dost thou not?  A faithful dog!'    'Faithful enough.'    'O! art thou?  By what token?'    'By the token of the quarry run to earth.'    'To earth?  Thou hast him?  Good Jacopo!'    'This three days past.  Had I not told thee so already? Let thine  improvising damn thyself, not me.'    'The villain! to call himself a Franciscan, a lowly Franciscan, and  pretend to read the stars!  How about his prophecy now?'    'Why, he holds to it.'    'What! that I have but eleven years in all to reign--less than one to  live?'    'Just that--no more.'    'Now, is it not a wicked schism from the plain humility of his founder?  A curse on their spirituals and conventuals!  _This_ fellow to claim  kinship with the stars--profess to be in their confidence, to share  heaven's secrets?  Dear Jacopo, sweet Jacopo! is it not well to cleanse  this earth of such lying prophets, that truth may have standing-room?'    'Ask truth, not me.'    'Nay, not to grieve truth's heart--the onus shall be ours.  This same  Franciscan--this soothsaying monk--where hast lodged him?'    'In the \"Hermit's Cell.\"'    'Ah, old jester!  He shall prove his asceticism thereby. Let practised  abstinence save him in such pass.  He shall eat his words--an  everlasting banquet.  A fat astrologer, by the token, as I hear.'    'He went in, fat.'    'Wretch! wouldst thou starve him?  Remember the worms, thy cousins.  Hath he foretold his end?'    'Ay, by starvation.'    'He lies, then.  Thou shalt take him _in extremis_, and, with thy knife  in his throat, give him the lie.  An impostor proved.  What sort of  night is it?'    'Why, it rains and thunders.'    'Hush!  Why should we fear rain and thunder?

She was the daughter of Mario Pio, of the Lords of  Carpi. Early the widow of Antonio of Montefeltro, natural brother  of Guidobaldo, she remained at Urbino. She died, as it seems, a  true lady of the Renaissance. \"Senza alcun sacramento di la chiesa,  disputando una parte del Cortegiano col Conte Ludovico da Canosso.\"  Cf. Rossi, _Appunti per la storia della musica alla Corte d'Urbino_,  in Rassegna Emiliana, Ann. I. (fasc. VIII.), p. 456, n. 1.]    [Footnote 33: See below, p. 57.]    But it would not be just, after adorning our narrative with  flattering sketches from Castiglione's pencil, to exclude one or  two anecdotes of the manners actually permitted among the polished  society he professes to portray, although their coarseness and  vulgarity, scarcely redeemed by their humour, may be considered as  staining our pages. They occur in some memorials of the conversation  of Francesco Maria, noted by a contemporary from personal  observation.[34]    [Footnote 34: Vat. Urb. MSS. No. 1023, art. 21. There is a copy of  this MS. in the library of Newbattle Abbey, Scotland.]    The subject of discussion happening to be Mark Antony's weakness  in permitting Cleopatra to accompany him to the fight of Actium,  the Duke said, \"My father-in-law, the Marquis of Mantua, being at  Mortara, in the service of France, Ludovico il Moro was in the  camp with his Duchess, and one day, seeing the Marquis suffering  from violent pain in the shoulder, said to him, 'Sir, I have  the Duchess here, what shall I do with her?' The Marquis, being  otherwise occupied, and suffering great pain, replied, 'How can I  tell? send her to a brothel!' an answer quite off-hand, and truly  appropriate\"--from the brother of our paragon Duchess Elisabetta.    Niccolo de' Pii, a condottiere in the service of the Duke's father,  was very fat and overgrown. Dining one day with some Spanish  officers, after finishing a trout, he sent the head and back-bone  to one of them called Pedrada, who thereupon caustically retorted,  \"It is yourself that has more want of head than of stomach,\" a reply  applauded as most cutting, for, \"having more size than sense, he  needed the brains rather than the belly.\" The same Spaniard one day,  at a cardinal's reception, began to eat a candle, which, though  apparently of wax, was in the centre of tallow; finding it greasy  between his teeth, he seized the candlestick, and dashed it on the  floor, muttering, \"I swear to God it is not silver:\" the candle being  counterfeit, he fancied the candlestick must needs be so too. When  talking of absent men, the Duke told these anecdotes of Ottaviano  Fregoso, a star of the Urbino circle. As he conversed with his aunt  Duchess Elisabetta, holding her hand, his mind wandered to other  matters, and he began to twist about her fingers as he would have  done a switch, finally thrusting one of them into his nose, when a  burst of laughter from the bystanders recalled his thoughts. Dining  one day at the table of Julius II., he sheathed and unsheathed his  poignard, jingling the handle, until the Pope, losing all temper,  exclaimed, \"Begone to a brothel, pox take you! Be off, and the  devil go with you!\" Whereupon Signor Ottaviano began to make humble  excuses for his natural defect of recollection, to the infinite  glee of many church dignitaries who witnessed the scene. Yet only  two days thereafter, chancing to converse in the papal antechamber  with an ambassador who wore a massive gold chain, he, in a fit of  abstraction, thrust his finger into one of the links. Just then,  his Holiness appearing, the courtiers drew aside to make way, and  Fregoso was dragged along, throwing them all into confusion; nor  could he get free until he had well \"salivated\" his finger. Yet when  his wits were not a wool-gathering, this was considered the most  finished gentleman in Italy, and the most ready in reply. Thus, his  uncle, Duke Guidobaldo appearing one day in a violet satin jerkin  of unexceptionable fit, Ottaviano exclaimed, \"My Lord Duke,  you really are _the_ handsome Signor!\" \"How disgusting are dull  flatterers who thus openly display their adulation,\" was the stinging  reply. \"My Lord Duke,\" rejoined the courtier, \"I meant not to say  that you are a man of worth, though I pronounced you a fine man and a  handsome nobleman;\" an answer which made the Duke wince, and brought  credit to its author.    [Illustration: _Alinari_    A LADY OF THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY]    But enough of this gossip: the reader of the _Cortegiano_, and its  author's charming letters, will find there many more attractive  and not less veracious touches of the Montefeltrian court, where  learning and accomplishment were often called upon to give dignity  and grace to social pastimes. Thus, the Duchess is represented as  singing to her lute those verses from the fourth _Aeneid_, in which,  at the moment of self-immolation, Dido apostrophised the garments  forgotten by her faithless lover when he fled from her charms, until,  Orpheus-like, she had wiled the savage animals from their lairs, and  set the stones in sympathetic movement. At her court there were no  lack of pens to clothe in verse the passing fancies of the hour, and  adapt them to the musical or melodramatic tastes which gave a tone  of refinement to its amusements. Thus, for the carnival of 1506,  Castiglione and his messmate Cesare Gonzaga composed the pastoral  eclogue of _Tirsis_, which was acted by them before the court, with  choruses and a brilliant moresque dance. The personages of the  dialogue are Iola (Castiglione) and Dameta (Gonzaga), who describe  to Tirsi, a stranger shepherd, the ducal circle of Urbino, with the  Duchess at its head as goddess of the river Metauro. The Moresca, so  named from its supposed Moorish origin, was perhaps borrowed from  the ancient Pyrrhic dance, and consisted in a sort of mock fight,  performed to the sound of music with measured tread, and blunted  poignards. Next spring a somewhat similar pastoral, from the pen of  Bembo, was recited by him and Ottaviano Fregoso to the same audience.    Such and such-like were the favourite court diversions of Urbino.  Their stately conceits and solemn pedantry suited the spirit of that  classic age and the genius of a pomp-loving people; but it would be  scarcely fair to regard them as fully embodying the tone of manners  prevalent in the palace of Guidobaldo. In it were harmoniously  mingled the opposite qualities which then predominated at the various  Italian courts. Scholastic pretensions, still esteemed in many of  them, here thawed before the easier address of the new school.  Those abstruse studies which the Medici had brought into vogue were  eclipsed by a galaxy of brilliant wits. Even the ruthless bearing of  the old condottieri princes mellowed under the charm of female tact,  while the sensual splendour indulged by recent pontiffs was chastened  by the exemplary demeanour of the ducal pair.    Our appreciation of this picture would, however, scarcely be  correct or complete, did we not bear in mind the inner life of  contemporary sovereigns. We need not dwell on the contrasts afforded  in other Peninsular capitals, for these were rather of degree than  character, and would only show us the prevalence here of a gentler  courtesy and more pervading refinement. But we may fairly compare  the palace-pastimes of Urbino with those held in acceptance by  the princes and peerage of northern states, where deep potations  dulled the senses, or brutalised the temper; where intellect rarely  sought a more refined gratification than the monotonous recital  of legendary adulation; and where wit was monopolised by dwarfs  and professional jesters. In order better to preserve the form and  fashion of this pattern for princes, we shall transfer to our pages,  from Castiglione's groupings, some outlines of its chief ornaments,  beginning with himself.[35]    [Footnote 35: Castiglione was related through his mother to several  of the Urbino stars,--the Fregosi, Trivulzio, and Emilia Pia.]           *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration: COUNT BALDASSARE CASTIGLIONE.    _Raffaele pinx._ _L. Ceroni sculp._    _From a picture in the Torlonia Gallery, Rome_]    From CASTIGLIONE, in Lombardy, sprang the ancestry of  COUNT BALDASSARE, and among them were numbered not a few  names of note in church and state. His father was no mean soldier,  in times when the captains of Italy bore a European reputation;  his mother, a Gonzaga of the Mantuan house, was descended from the  haughty Farinato degli Uberti, who, when accosted by Dante in _The  Vision_,--             \"His heart and forehead there       Erecting, seemed as in high scorn he held       E'en hell.\"    The Count was born at Casatico, in the Mantuese, on the 6th of  December, 1478.[*36] His education, besides including the various  studies and accomplishments usual to an Italian gentleman of the  fifteenth century, was specially directed to those classical  attainments which entered into the literary pursuits of the age. The  death of his father left him early master of a handsome patrimony,  and he at once embraced that courtier-life for which he was  peculiarly fitted,--a life, which in a land subdivided into petty  sovereignties, constituted the only profession open to civilians of  noble birth and distinguished endowments, and on which his pen was  destined to confer perpetual illustration.
