On  the 13th of April he succeeded General Lyttelton in his command, as  that officer was leaving for England, and Colonel Haig moved to take  charge of operations in Cape Colony. On both sides of the river the  sweeping up of stores and capture of Boers proceeded apace, and the  total result of General Bruce-Hamilton's April activities was the  capture of ninety-five prisoners, 300 horses, and an abundance of live  stock.    The raiders, ragged and starving, were continually active. Kruitzinger  made an ineffectual effort to cross on the 4th, but was frustrated by  finding the troops of General Bruce-Hamilton in possession of the  river banks. Colonel White and Colonel Munro so actively scoured round  and about Springfontein that such Boers as there were quickly vanished  till a more opportune period. Others tried to sneak across at  Oudefontein Drift, but Major Murray's men discovered them in the act  and disposed of them. From the region of Brandford came the news of  the capture of a laager on the 2nd by the prowess of Thorneycroft's  Mounted Infantry, who, by night, had surrounded the camp of Bester and  caught him napping.    On the 7th of April, Colonel Thorneycroft moved towards Winburg to  deal with a minor concentration of the enemy in that neighbourhood.  The rumour of his approach served to defeat the Boers' object and  disperse them, and he consequently returned to Brandfort.           *       *       *       *       *    General Sir Leslie Rundle remained indefatigable. In March he was  still firmly holding his line--Ficksburg, Harrismith, Bethlehem, and  Vrede. But he was minus the mobile column under General Campbell,  which had temporarily reinforced the troops under General Wynne, and  was furnishing an escort under Colonel Inglefield on the  Utrecht-Luneberg line, whence General French (in the important  operations which have been described) drew his supplies. General  Campbell, after trying experiences (fighting perpetually in marsh and  morass, floating waggons across rivers, and crossing on rafts, &c.)  which delayed all his undertakings, returned to Harrismith on the 10th  of April. Later, General Rundle, finding the Boers had again buzzed  about Fouriesburg, left Harrismith for Bethlehem, reaching there on  the 24th. The enemy, some 300, dogged his footsteps and hung round his  flanks till it was necessary to whisk them off, which was accomplished  after four days' fighting. He was then able to move on _via_ Retief's  Nek, which he passed on the 29th, entering Fouriesburg unopposed on  the 2nd of May. He afterwards set about scouring the country in its  remotest valleys with flying columns, while Colonel Harley from  Ficksburg made similar excursions. These united activities were  fraught with considerable excitement and corresponding success. On the  31st of May, Colonel Harley left Fouriesburg and seized the  Slaapkrantz position without serious opposition, sending the Boers who  were fleeing before him into the arms of General Campbell. This  officer was moving from the direction of Bethlehem, and by a forced  march managed to reach Naauwpoort Nek in time to intercept the enemy's  convoy. From this date to the 8th of June, when they joined hands at  Elands River Drift, Colonels Harley and Campbell traversed the rugged  region north and south of the Roodebergen range, while a small column  from Harrismith watched the country to the east of Elands River Drift.  The results of these difficult operations and excursions against  Prinsloo's, Rautenhach's, and other commandos were as follows: 7 Boers  killed, 19 wounded, 101 Krupp shells, 4800 rounds of ammunition, 21  rifles, 43 vehicles, and 1450 horses. Foodstuffs, stores, and forage  in great quantities were captured or destroyed. The rest of June was  spent in clearing the Langeberg, the only district south of the  Harrismith-Bethlehem road which remained to be dealt with in the new  scheme of operations. The enemy hung mosquito-wise around the flanks  of the scouring columns, but they pursued their work and accounted for  15 Boers killed or wounded, 2770 horses, 56 vehicles, 4000 rounds of  ammunition, 7 rifles, and quantities of stores and stock. On the  conclusion of these operations, General Rundle returned to Harrismith,  where he remained till he started to co-operate with General Elliot's  march from Springfield Drift to Frankfort. Of which anon.    During June, Generals Rundle and Campbell bade farewell to the \"Old  Yeomanry.\" The chief took the opportunity to express his especial  satisfaction with the excellent work done by them, saying that when  they joined he was without cavalry, and did not know what he should  have done without them.    An interesting incident, showing that the pluck and value of the  Imperial Yeomanry cannot be overrated, may here be quoted. On the 23rd  of June, the Harrismith Volunteer Light Horse and a few of the  Imperial Yeomanry visited a farm and captured 1500 horses, sheep, and  goats. While these were being driven in, Sergeant-Major Reid (11th  Battalion Imperial Yeomanry), who with two men was handling a flock,  was assailed by a party of twelve Boers. Reid promptly sent on the men  with the animals and lay down alone in the open and covered their  retreat.          CHAPTER V    COMBINED MOVEMENT FOR THE CLEARANCE OF THE NORTHERN TRANSVAAL.--MARCH  AND APRIL      Lord Kitchener now engaged himself in preparing a new and immense  combined movement for the clearance of the country to the north of  Pretoria. The so-called seat of government of the Boers had been removed  from Pietersburg to Roos Senekal, and its presence there naturally  attracted all the Boers who, in consequence of General French's  clearance of the Swaziland border, had been forced into the difficult  country of the Tautesberg and Bothaberg. In planning a movement against  these bands from the line of Middelburg-Belfast-Lydenburg, precautions  had to be taken to prevent the escape of the enemy into the Zoutpansberg  and Waterberg districts. It therefore became necessary to hold  Pietersburg and the drifts over Olifant's River, and to chase the Boers  from their snug retreats in the vicinity.    Accordingly, General Plumer was moved from Orange River Colony and  directed to hold Pietersburg, and prepare to co-operate in the  combined movement just described.    At this time, 26th March, Pienaars River was the most advanced  garrison on the Pietersburg line. For this place General Plumer  started, there to be joined by the 2nd Battalion Gordon Highlanders  and \"C\" Section Pom-Poms.    Beyond Pienaars River repairs to the line had to be effected, which  caused delay, then the troops advanced from Warmbad, Nylstroom, to  Piet Potgietersrust over a clear line. Here the enemy meant mischief,  for they had blown up one of the smaller railway bridges, but this was  soon repaired, and on the 8th of April the advanced troops reached  Pietersburg, the average distance covered being fifteen miles a day.  The town had been evacuated in the night. Here provisions, supplies,  and remounts had to be collected, in order that the attack, once  begun, might be carried on without a hitch, and that the Boers, chased  from one quarter, might not be sent trekking into Rhodesia, but be  enveloped and swept up _en masse_ as they had been at Paardeberg and  at Fouriesburg. The projected advance was full of difficulties and the  preliminaries were endless. It was impossible to begin till men,  horses, and supplies had been deposited at Pietersburg by rail from  Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Durban, or Delagoa Bay. It must be  remembered that the columns were preparing to march some 150 miles  across the veldt, where the greatest of all enemies, the tsetze fly,  harassed every inch of the road. In addition to this deadly foe to  horses, there were now the wintry nights, following grilling days, to  be encountered, and chilly shocks which bring enteric and other  diseases in their train.    At Pietersburg forty-six Boers voluntarily surrendered, and the  following captures were made:--one Krupp gun, thirty rifles, 1000  rounds 7-pounder ammunition, 210,000 small-arm ammunition, 8300 lbs.  gunpowder, 480 lbs. dynamite. Two truck-loads of ammunition had been  blown up by the Boers on their departure. The occupation of the place  now made the scheme for the opening of railway communication from the  Cape to Cairo (hitherto thought to be a visionary's dream) perfectly  feasible. The line from Warmbaths to Pietersburg was now placed in  charge of Colonel Hall, the posts being occupied by the  Northamptonshire and Wiltshire Regiments, together with the 12th  Battalion Mounted Infantry. This left General Plumer's mounted troops  free to hold the line of the Olifant's River. Having established an  adequate garrison at Pietersburg, General Plumer proceeded to post  Major Colvin's column to secure the drift at Bathfontein, while to  Colonel Jeffreys was assigned the task of occupying a lower drift at  Blaauwbloemje's Kloof. General Plumer himself was at Commissie Drift.  Schalk Burger at this time was said to have deposited himself at  Tolesburg, west of Middelburg, where he still endeavoured to carry on  the parody of government.    Colonel Jeffreys on the 18th, while operating with his mobile column  along the Olifant, came on a party of Boers east of Druehoek. He  captured eleven and seized their ammunition. Soon after, Lieutenant  Reid (Imperial Bushmen) with some twenty Australians, who had been  detached from General Plumer's post at Commissie Drift, performed a  valiant act. While in charge of his patrol he located a Boer laager  some fifteen miles east of the drift."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4715"],[0,"An African Millionaire: Episodes in the Life of the Illustrious Colonel Clay (#16)"],[1,"were able in search of the valerian.    Judge of our astonishment when next moment those two young people  bounded back into the boat, pushed off with a peal of merry  laughter, and left us there staring at them!    They rowed away, about twenty yards, into deep water. Then the man  turned, and waved his hand at us gracefully. \"Good-bye!\" he said,  \"good-bye! Hope you'll pick a nice bunch! We're off to London!\"    \"Off!\" Charles exclaimed, turning pale. \"Off! What do you mean?  You don't surely mean to say you're going to leave us here?\"    The young man raised his cap with perfect politeness, while Mrs.  Granton smiled, nodded, and kissed her pretty hand to us. \"Yes,\"  he answered; \"for the present. We retire from the game. The fact  of it is, it's a trifle too thin: this is a coup manque.\"    \"A _what_?\" Charles exclaimed, perspiring visibly.    \"A coup manque,\" the young man replied, with a compassionate smile.  \"A failure, don't you know; a bad shot; a fiasco. I learn from  my scouts that you sent a telegram by special messenger to Lord  Craig-Ellachie this morning. That shows you suspect me. Now, it is a  principle of my system never to go on for one move with a game when  I find myself suspected. The slightest symptom of distrust, and--I  back out immediately. My plans can only be worked to satisfaction  when there is perfect confidence on the part of my patient. It is  a well-known rule of the medical profession. I _never_ try to bleed  a man who struggles. So now we're off. Ta-ta! Good luck to you!\"    He was not much more than twenty yards away, and could talk to us  quite easily. But the water was deep; the islet rose sheer from I'm  sure I don't know how many fathoms of sea; and we could neither of  us swim. Charles stretched out his arms imploringly. \"For Heaven's  sake,\" he cried, \"don't tell me you really mean to leave us here.\"    He looked so comical in his distress and terror that Mrs.  Granton--Madame Picardet--whatever I am to call her--laughed  melodiously in her prettiest way at the sight of him. \"Dear Sir  Charles,\" she called out, \"pray don't be afraid! It's only a  short and temporary imprisonment. We will send men to take you off.  Dear David and I only need just time enough to get well ashore and  make--oh!--a few slight alterations in our personal appearance.\"  And she indicated with her hand, laughing, dear David's red wig and  false sandy whiskers, as we felt convinced they must be now. She  looked at them and tittered. Her manner at this moment was anything  but shy. In fact, I will venture to say, it was that of a bold and  brazen-faced hoyden.    \"Then you _are_ Colonel Clay!\" Sir Charles cried, mopping his brow  with his handkerchief.    \"If you choose to call me so,\" the young man answered politely. \"I'm  sure it's most kind of you to supply me with a commission in Her  Majesty's service. However, time presses, and we want to push off.  Don't alarm yourselves unnecessarily. I will send a boat to take you  away from this rock at the earliest possible moment consistent with  my personal safety and my dear companion's.\" He laid his hand on his  heart and struck a sentimental attitude. \"I have received too many  unwilling kindnesses at your hands, Sir Charles,\" he continued,  \"not to feel how wrong it would be of me to inconvenience you for  nothing. Rest assured that you shall be rescued by midnight at  latest. Fortunately, the weather just at present is warm, and I see  no chance of rain; so you will suffer, if at all, from nothing worse  than the pangs of temporary hunger.\"    Mrs. Granton, no longer squinting--'twas a mere trick she had  assumed--rose up in the boat and stretched out a rug to us. \"Catch!\"  she cried, in a merry voice, and flung it at us, doubled. It fell  at our feet; she was a capital thrower.    \"Now, you dear Sir Charles,\" she went on, \"take that to keep you  warm! You know I am really quite fond of you. You're not half a  bad old boy when one takes you the right way. You have a human side  to you. Why, I often wear that sweetly pretty brooch you gave me  at Nice, when I was Madame Picardet! And I'm sure your goodness to  me at Lucerne, when I was the little curate's wife, is a thing to  remember. We're so glad to have seen you in your lovely Scotch  home you were always so proud of! _Don't_ be frightened, please. We  wouldn't hurt you for worlds. We _are_ so sorry we have to take this  inhospitable means of evading you. But dear David--I _must_ call  him dear David still--instinctively felt that you were beginning to  suspect us; and he can't bear mistrust. He _is_ so sensitive! The  moment people mistrust him, he _must_ break off with them at once.  This was the only way to get you both off our hands while we make  the needful little arrangements to depart; and we've been driven to  avail ourselves of it. However, I will give you my word of honour,  as a lady, you shall be fetched away to-night. If dear David doesn't  do it, why, I'll do it myself.\" And she blew another kiss to us.    Charles was half beside himself, divided between alternate terror  and anger. \"Oh, we shall die here!\" he exclaimed. \"Nobody'd ever  dream of coming to this rock to search for me.\"    \"What a pity you didn't let me teach you to swim!\" Colonel Clay  interposed. \"It is a noble exercise, and very useful indeed in such  special emergencies! Well, ta-ta! I'm off! You nearly scored one  this time; but, by putting you here for the moment, and keeping you  till we're gone, I venture to say I've redressed the board, and I  think we may count it a drawn game, mayn't we? The match stands at  three, love--with some thousands in pocket?\"    \"You're a murderer, sir!\" Charles shrieked out. \"We shall starve or  die here!\"    Colonel Clay on his side was all sweet reasonableness. \"Now, my dear  sir,\" he expostulated, one hand held palm outward, \"_Do_ you think  it probable I would kill the goose that lays the golden eggs, with  so little compunction? No, no, Sir Charles Vandrift; I know too well  how much you are worth to me. I return you on my income-tax paper  as five thousand a year, clear profit of my profession. Suppose you  were to die! I might be compelled to find some new and far less  lucrative source of plunder. Your heirs, executors, or assignees  might not suit my purpose. The fact of it is, sir, your temperament  and mine are exactly adapted one to the other. _I_ understand _you_;  and _you_ do not understand _me_--which is often the basis of the  firmest friendships. I can catch you just where you are trying to  catch other people. Your very smartness assists me; for I admit you  _are_ smart. As a regular financier, I allow, I couldn't hold a  candle to you. But in my humbler walk of life I know just how to  utilise you. I lead you on, where you think you are going to gain some  advantage over others; and by dexterously playing upon your love of  a good bargain, your innate desire to best somebody else--I succeed  in besting you. There, sir, you have the philosophy of our mutual  relations.\"    He bowed and raised his cap. Charles looked at him and cowered. Yes,  genius as he is, he positively cowered. \"And do you mean to say,\"  he burst out, \"you intend to go on so bleeding me?\"    The Colonel smiled a bland smile. \"Sir Charles Vandrift,\" he  answered, \"I called you just now the goose that lays the golden  eggs. You may have thought the metaphor a rude one. But you _are_  a goose, you know, in certain relations. Smartest man on the Stock  Exchange, I readily admit; easiest fool to bamboozle in the  open country that ever I met with. You fail in one thing--the  perspicacity of simplicity. For that reason, among others, I have  chosen to fasten upon you. Regard me, my dear sir, as a microbe of  millionaires, a parasite upon capitalists. You know the old rhyme:      Great fleas have little fleas upon their backs to bite 'em,    And these again have lesser fleas, and so ad infinitum!    Well, that's just how I view myself. _You_ are a capitalist and a  millionaire. In _your_ large way you prey upon society. YOU deal in  Corners, Options, Concessions, Syndicates. You drain the world  dry of its blood and its money. You possess, like the mosquito, a  beautiful instrument of suction--Founders' Shares--with which you  absorb the surplus wealth of the community. In _my_ smaller way,  again, _I_ relieve you in turn of a portion of the plunder. I am a  Robin Hood of my age; and, looking upon _you_ as an exceptionally bad  form of millionaire--as well as an exceptionally easy form of pigeon  for a man of my type and talents to pluck--I have, so to speak,  taken up my abode upon you.\"    Charles looked at him and groaned.    The young man continued, in a tone of gentle badinage. \"I love the  plot-interest of the game,\" he said, \"and so does dear Jessie here.  We both of us adore it. As long as I find such good pickings upon  you, I certainly am not going to turn away from so valuable a  carcass, in order to batten myself, at considerable trouble, upon  minor capitalists, out of whom it is difficult to extract a few  hundreds. It may have puzzled you to guess why I fix upon you so  persistently. Now you know, and understand. When a fluke finds a  sheep that suits him, that fluke lives upon him. You are my host: I  am your parasite. This coup has failed. But don't flatter yourself  for a moment it will be the last one.\"    \"Why do you insult me by telling me all this?\" Sir Charles cried,  writhing.    The Colonel waved his hand. It was small and white. \"Because I _love_  the game,\" he answered, with a relish; \"and also, because the more  prepared you are beforehand, the greater credit and amusement is  there in besting you. Well, now, ta-ta once more! I am wasting  valuable time. I might be cheating somebody. I must be off at  once.... Take care of yourself, Wentworth. But I know you _will_.  You always do. Ten per cent _is_ more usual!\"    He rowed away and left us. As the boat began to "]]]
