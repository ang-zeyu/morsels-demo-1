James Bridger,      the well-known mountaineer, who had inter-married with the Snakes      [Indians], and had a trading post which still bears his name,      Fort Bridger, when he met President Brigham Young at the Pioneer      camp on the Big Sandy, about the last of June, and learned our      destination to be the valley of the Great Salt Lake, he gave us a      general outline and description of this country over which he had      roamed with the Indians in his hunting and trapping excursions,      and expressed grave doubts whether corn could be produced at all      in these mountains, he having made experiments in many places with      a few seeds, which had failed to mature. So sanguine was he that      it could not be done that he proffered to give a thousand dollars      for the first ear of corn raised in the valley of the Great Salt      Lake, or the valley of the Utah outlet, as he termed it, meaning      the valley between Utah lake and Salt Lake. President Young replied      to him, 'Wait a little and we will show you.'\" (The Utah Pioneers,      pages 41-43.)    Nor is the fact of Salt Lake valley's desolation witnessed by the  testimony of Mormons alone. Howard Stansbury, Captain of the Corps of  Topographical Engineers, U.S. Army, in 1852, says:        \"One of the most unpleasant characteristics of the whole country,      is the entire absence of trees from the landscape. The weary      traveller plods along, exposed to the full blaze of one eternal      sunshine, day after day, and week after week, his eye resting upon      naught but interminable plains, bold and naked hills, or bold and      rugged mountains; the shady grove, the babbling brook, the dense      and solemn forest are things unknown here; and should he by chance      light upon some solitary cotton-wood, or pitch his tent amid some      stunted willows, the opportunity is hailed with joy, as one of      unusual good fortune. The studding, therefore, of this beautiful      city [referring to Salt Lake City] with noble trees, will render      it, by contrast with the surrounding regions, a second 'Diamond of      the Desert.'\" (Stansbury's Report, page 129.)    Again, Lieutenant J. W. Gunnison of the Topographical Engineers,  writing in 1853, said:        \"It [the Salt Lake Valley] is isolated from habitable grounds;      having inhospitable tracts to the North and South, and the      untimbered slope of the Rocky Mountains, nearly a thousand miles      wide, on the east, and nearly a thousand miles of arid salt deserts      on the west, broken up by frequent ridges of sterile mountains.      The Great Basin is * * * over four thousand feet above the ocean.      * * * It is a desert in character. * * * In the interior, fresh      water becomes scarce, for these hills do not collect sufficient      snow in winter * * * * to water the plains; and the consequence      follows that these tracts are parched and arid, and frequently so      impregnated with alkali as to make them unfit for vegetable life.      * * * The land around Salt Lake is flat, and rises imperceptibly      on the south and west, * * * and is a soft and sandy barren,      irreclaimable for agricultural purposes. On the north the tract      is narrow, and the springs bursting out near the surface of the      water, the grounds cannot be irrigated.\" (\"The Mormons,\" by J. W.      Gunnison, pages 14, 15, 16.)    These descriptions of Utah. Valley warrant Utah's Historian, Bishop  Orson F. Whitney, in giving the splendid pen picture he writes of the  valley on the arrival of the Pioneers, in saying:        \"It was no Garden of Hesperides upon which the Pioneers gazed      that memorable morning of July 24, 1847. Aside from its scenic      splendor, which was indeed glorious, magnificent, there was little      to invite and much to repel in the prospect presented to their      view. A broad and barren plain, hemmed in by mountains, blistering      in the rays of the midsummer sun. No waving fields, no swaying      forests, no verdant meadows to rest and refresh the weary eye,      but on all sides a seemingly interminable waste of sagebrush,      bespangled with sunflowers--the paradise of the lizard, the      cricket and the rattle snake. Less than half way across the baked      and burning valley, dividing it in twain--as if the vast bowl,      in the intense heat of the Master Potter's fires, in process of      formation had cracked asunder--a narrow river, turbid and shallow,      from south to north in many a serpentine curve, sweeps on its      sinuous way. Beyond, a broad lake, the river's goal, dotted with      mountain islands; its briny waters shimmering in the sunlight      like a silver shield. From the mountains, snow-capped, seamy and      craggy, lifting their kingly heads to be crowned by the golden sun,      flow limpid, laughing streams, cold and crystal clear, leaping,      dashing, foaming, flashing, from rock to glen, from peak to plain.      But the fresh canyon streams are far and few, and the arid waste      they water, glistening with beds of salt and soda pools of deadly      alkali, scarcely allowing them to reach the river, but midway well      nigh swallows and absorbs them in the thirsty sands. These, the      oak-brush, the squaw-berry, and other scant growths, with here      and there a tree casting its lone shadow on hill or in valley; a      wire-grass swamp, a few acres of withered bunch-grass, and the      lazily waving willows and wild-rose bushes, fringing the distant      streams, the only green thing visible. Silence and desolation      reign. A silence unbroken, save by the cricket's ceaseless chirp,      the roar of the mountain torrent or the whir and twitter of      the passing bird. A desolation of centuries, where earth seems      heaven-forsaken, where Hermit Nature, watching, waiting, weeps and      worships God amid eternal solitudes.\" (History of Utah, Vol. I.,      pages 325-6.)    The Mormons whom your Salt Lake Correspondent admits had the territory  of Utah almost exclusively to themselves for about twenty-five years,  converted the desert wilderness described in the foregoing quotations  into a fruitful land, and redeemed it from savagery to civilization. By  the creation of an irrigation system they demonstrated that the desert  lands of the intermountain region could be converted into fruitful  fields, and thus became Pioneers, not alone of Utah, but of the entire  intermountain region, and became founders of modern irrigation farming,  which now is developing into a great national movement, that looks to  the reclamation of an extent of country beside which the extent of  ancient empires becomes insignificant; and happy millions will yet  partake of the blessings first disclosed as possible by the example  in irrigation set by the Mormon people. And all such silly falsehoods  and misrepresentations as those uttered by your jaundice-minded  correspondent, can never rob them of the high honor accorded them by  the nation for the part they have performed in so great and notable and  far reaching enterprises.    Your correspondent represents himself as having lived in Utah for over  twenty-five years; and also as having had ample opportunity to study  the \"Mormon system\" and its fruits, and then says:        \"I am forced to join with other careful students in declaring that      from a social, civil and moral standpoint, no language is strong      enough to set forth the evil fruits of the \"Mormon system.\" Based      on polygamy, how could the system be otherwise than rotten? Its      central idea of government being that of priesthood rule, how      could it be otherwise than anti-American? Having been founded      and organized by a man as corrupt and immoral as the multiplied      statements of Joseph Smith's acquaintances and neighbors prove that      he was, how could it be otherwise than mischievous and immoral in      its tendencies and results?\"    Really, after thinking of a man living in Utah for twenty-five years  with exceptional opportunities to study the \"Mormon system,\" one  becomes quite disheartened when he witnesses such an exhibition of  stupidity in apprehending, or a willingness to misrepresent as is  exhibited in the foregoing quotation. First, if your correspondent had  intelligence to understand the most simple proposition, he never would  have made the statement that Mormonism is based on polygamy. Mormonism  existed ten years and had spread through nearly all the states of the  American Union, into Canada and Great Britain, before plural marriage  was ever introduced into the Church. And notwithstanding that under  the requirements of the laws of the land, the Church has discontinued  the authorization of plural marriages, Mormonism still survives--much  to the chagrin of such characters as your correspondent, and the  Mormon Church was never more alive or prosperous than it is today.  The doctrine of the rightfulness of plural marriage is in every sense  but an incident in the \"Mormon system\" rather than a basic principle.  Salvation in the Mormon religion is not made to depend upon a plurality  of wives. On the contrary it teaches that either man or woman can  be saved without marriage at all. That those in monogamous marriage  relations may be saved, but it also is a fact that it has taught that  men with a plurality of wives, if they have taken them under the  sanction of God's law--a law which existed in the days of the Bible  patriarchs as well as in these last days by special dispensation  through Joseph Smith--may also be saved. Mormonism does teach, however,  that marriage is essential to man's exaltation and progress in his  saved condition, and that special blessings"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/479"],[0,"Little Lord Fauntleroy (#16)"],[1," Mordaunt to wish it were proper and Christian-like to throw  something heavy at him. During all the years in which Mr. Mordaunt  had been in charge of Dorincourt parish, the rector certainly did not  remember having seen his lordship, of his own free will, do any one a  kindness, or, under any circumstances whatever, show that he thought of  any one but himself.    He had called to-day to speak to him of a specially pressing case, and  as he had walked up the avenue, he had, for two reasons, dreaded his  visit more than usual. In the first place, he knew that his lordship  had for several days been suffering with the gout, and had been in  so villainous a humor that rumors of it had even reached the  village--carried there by one of the young women servants, to her  sister, who kept a little shop and retailed darning-needles and cotton  and peppermints and gossip, as a means of earning an honest living.  What Mrs. Dibble did not know about the Castle and its inmates, and the  farm-houses and their inmates, and the village and its population, was  really not worth being talked about. And of course she knew everything  about the Castle, because her sister, Jane Shorts, was one of the upper  housemaids, and was very friendly and intimate with Thomas.    \"And the way his lordship do go on!\" said Mrs. Dibble, over the counter,  \"and the way he do use language, Mr. Thomas told Jane herself, no flesh  and blood as is in livery could stand--for throw a plate of toast at Mr.  Thomas, hisself, he did, not more than two days since, and if it weren't  for other things being agreeable and the society below stairs most  genteel, warning would have been gave within a' hour!\"    And the rector had heard all this, for somehow the Earl was a favorite  black sheep in the cottages and farm-houses, and his bad behavior gave  many a good woman something to talk about when she had company to tea.    And the second reason was even worse, because it was a new one and had  been talked about with the most excited interest.    Who did not know of the old nobleman's fury when his handsome son the  Captain had married the American lady? Who did not know how cruelly he  had treated the Captain, and how the big, gay, sweet-smiling young man,  who was the only member of the grand family any one liked, had died in  a foreign land, poor and unforgiven? Who did not know how fiercely his  lordship had hated the poor young creature who had been this son's wife,  and how he had hated the thought of her child and never meant to see the  boy--until his two sons died and left him without an heir? And then,  who did not know that he had looked forward without any affection or  pleasure to his grandson's coming, and that he had made up his mind that  he should find the boy a vulgar, awkward, pert American lad, more likely  to disgrace his noble name than to honor it?    The proud, angry old man thought he had kept all his thoughts secret. He  did not suppose any one had dared to guess at, much less talk over what  he felt, and dreaded; but his servants watched him, and read his  face and his ill-humors and fits of gloom, and discussed them in the  servants' hall. And while he thought himself quite secure from the  common herd, Thomas was telling Jane and the cook, and the butler, and  the housemaids and the other footmen that it was his opinion that \"the  hold man was wuss than usual a-thinkin' hover the Capting's boy, an'  hanticipatin' as he won't be no credit to the fambly. An' serve him  right,\" added Thomas; \"hit's 'is hown fault. Wot can he iggspect from a  child brought up in pore circumstances in that there low Hamerica?\"    And as the Reverend Mr. Mordaunt walked under the great trees, he  remembered that this questionable little boy had arrived at the Castle  only the evening before, and that there were nine chances to one that  his lordship's worst fears were realized, and twenty-two chances to one  that if the poor little fellow had disappointed him, the Earl was even  now in a tearing rage, and ready to vent all his rancor on the first  person who called--which it appeared probable would be his reverend  self.    Judge then of his amazement when, as Thomas opened the library door, his  ears were greeted by a delighted ring of childish laughter.    \"That's two out!\" shouted an excited, clear little voice. \"You see it's  two out!\"    And there was the Earl's chair, and the gout-stool, and his foot on  it; and by him a small table and a game on it; and quite close to him,  actually leaning against his arm and his ungouty knee, was a little boy  with face glowing, and eyes dancing with excitement. \"It's two out!\" the  little stranger cried. \"You hadn't any luck that time, had you?\"--And  then they both recognized at once that some one had come in.    The Earl glanced around, knitting his shaggy eyebrows as he had a  trick of doing, and when he saw who it was, Mr. Mordaunt was still  more surprised to see that he looked even less disagreeable than usual  instead of more so. In fact, he looked almost as if he had forgotten for  the moment how disagreeable he was, and how unpleasant he really could  make himself when he tried.    \"Ah!\" he said, in his harsh voice, but giving his hand rather  graciously. \"Good-morning, Mordaunt. I've found a new employment, you  see.\"    He put his other hand on Cedric's shoulder,--perhaps deep down in his  heart there was a stir of gratified pride that it was such an heir he  had to present; there was a spark of something like pleasure in his eyes  as he moved the boy slightly forward.    \"This is the new Lord Fauntleroy,\" he said. \"Fauntleroy, this is Mr.  Mordaunt, the rector of the parish.\"    Fauntleroy looked up at the gentleman in the clerical garments, and gave  him his hand.    \"I am very glad to make your acquaintance, sir,\" he said, remembering  the words he had heard Mr. Hobbs use on one or two occasions when he had  been greeting a new customer with ceremony.    Cedric felt quite sure that one ought to be more than usually polite to  a minister.    Mr. Mordaunt held the small hand in his a moment as he looked down at  the child's face, smiling involuntarily. He liked the little fellow from  that instant--as in fact people always did like him. And it was not the  boy's beauty and grace which most appealed to him; it was the simple,  natural kindliness in the little lad which made any words he uttered,  however quaint and unexpected, sound pleasant and sincere. As the rector  looked at Cedric, he forgot to think of the Earl at all. Nothing in the  world is so strong as a kind heart, and somehow this kind little  heart, though it was only the heart of a child, seemed to clear all the  atmosphere of the big gloomy room and make it brighter.    \"I am delighted to make your acquaintance, Lord Fauntleroy,\" said the  rector. \"You made a long journey to come to us. A great many people will  be glad to know you made it safely.\"    \"It WAS a long way,\" answered Fauntleroy, \"but Dearest, my mother, was  with me and I wasn't lonely. Of course you are never lonely if your  mother is with you; and the ship was beautiful.\"    \"Take a chair, Mordaunt,\" said the Earl. Mr. Mordaunt sat down. He  glanced from Fauntleroy to the Earl.    \"Your lordship is greatly to be congratulated,\" he said warmly.    But the Earl plainly had no intention of showing his feelings on the  subject.    \"He is like his father,\" he said rather gruffly. \"Let us hope he'll  conduct himself more creditably.\" And then he added: \"Well, what is it  this morning, Mordaunt? Who is in trouble now?\"    This was not as bad as Mr. Mordaunt had expected, but he hesitated a  second before he began.    \"It is Higgins,\" he said; \"Higgins of Edge Farm. He has been very  unfortunate. He was ill himself last autumn, and his children had  scarlet fever. I can't say that he is a very good manager, but he has  had ill-luck, and of course he is behindhand in many ways. He is in  trouble about his rent now. Newick tells him if he doesn't pay it, he  must leave the place; and of course that would be a very serious matter.  His wife is ill, and he came to me yesterday to beg me to see about  it, and ask you for time. He thinks if you would give him time he could  catch up again.\"    \"They all think that,\" said the Earl, looking rather black.    Fauntleroy made a movement forward. He had been standing between his  grandfather and the visitor, listening with all his might. He had begun  to be interested in Higgins at once. He wondered how many children there  were, and if the scarlet fever had hurt them very much. His eyes were  wide open and were fixed upon Mr. Mordaunt with intent interest as that  gentleman went on with the conversation.    \"Higgins is a well-meaning man,\" said the rector, making an effort to  strengthen his plea.    \"He is a bad enough tenant,\" replied his lordship. \"And he is always  behindhand, Newick tells me.\"    \"He is in great trouble now,\" said the rector.    \"He is very fond of his wife and children, and if the farm is taken  from him they may literally starve. He can not give them the nourishing  things they need. Two of the children were left very low after the  fever, and the doctor orders for them wine and luxuries that Higgins can  not afford.\"    At this Fauntleroy moved a step nearer.    \"That was the way with Michael,\" he said.    The Earl slightly started.    \"I forgot YOU!\" he said. \"I forgot we had a philanthropist in the room.  Who was Michael?\" And the gleam of queer amusement came back into the  old man's deep-set eyes.    \"He was Bridget's husband, who had the fever,\" answered Fauntleroy; \"and  he couldn't pay the rent or buy wine and things. And you gave me that  money to help him.\"    The Earl drew his brows together into a curious frown, which somehow was  scarcely grim at all. He glanced across at Mr. Mordaunt.    \"I don't know what sort of landed proprietor he will make,\" he said.  \"I told Havisham the boy was to have"]]]
