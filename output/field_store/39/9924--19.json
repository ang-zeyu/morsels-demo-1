I'm going into Stowe and I thought you might like for me to get the  pigs.  Come, leave me 'av some money.\"    \"I don't want they veares.\"  She rested her strong hands on the sides of  the cone and looked at him with understanding.  He must be made to  realize that this was folly and that it must come to an end.  \"An' you  don't want to buy them.  All you want is to go with Gray.\"    Leadville, as always when his subterfuges were detected, fell back on  the truth.    \"Well?\" he said.  \"An' s'posin' if I did?\"    Sabina was startled.  Had matters gone so far that he no longer had the  decency to deny his feelings? \"Isolda's goin' wi' Gray,\" she said, with  a shrug of her plump shoulders.    \"Isolda?\" he said and his disappointment, bubbling up from the depths,  showed as anger.  Among them they took good care of Gray; but if they  thought their scheming and underhauling would prevent his reaching her,  he would very soon show them they were mistaken.  \"Fine thing you,\" he  cried wrathfully, \"to be jealous over a feller.\"    Mrs. Byron had grown stouter since her long illness. She filled the  wicker cone to overflowing, a big rosy woman with abundance of white  hair above a face the strength of which time had made plain.  Her  husband's thrust was shrewd, so shrewd that she gave way before it.  \"You'm wishin' me daid, I s'pose?\" she said bitterly and waited to hear  him deny the accusation.    Leadville shifted from one foot to the other but did not speak.  People  say terrible things when they are angry, but silence can be more  terrible than speech.    \"I shen't die any quicker,\" cried poor Mrs. Byron, \"for you wishin' of  it.\"    For months the man had concealed his feelings behind down-dropped lids  and avoidance; but now the repugnance with which she filled him rose to  his eyes, eyes no longer moody and dull, but suddenly, revealingly,  alive. Hitherto the secrecy which was natural to him had seemed the only  possible plan; now, driven by jealousy, by anger, by a mounting hatred,  he suddenly discarded it. Raising his lids he stared at Sabina for some  seconds and his soul showed her its loathing and threatened her and  condemned her; and--like a rabbit held by lanthorn light--she stared  back.    The truth was riding nakedly through the street of life.  It spoke with  a clear note of warning and Sabina--for a moment--both saw and heard.                                        *CHAPTER IX*      \"You'm lookin' whisht this mornin', missis, what's the matter with 'ee?\"    Jim Rosevear had brought two faggots of tamarisk wood for the cloam  oven.  His shy glance, taking in every corner of the now brightening  kitchen, had assured him that Gray was not present; and, putting that  main preoccupation momentarily aside, he had leisure to note that Mrs.  Byron's face was haggard, that she looked older, more worn, than he had  thought.  It followed that she must be ill and for illness he had always  a solicitous word.    After that revealing look Leadville had walked quietly past his wife out  of the house.  His dark thoughts, his secret hopes had risen to the  surface.  He had held them in for months but, in the end, they had  escaped from him in a glance.    His footsteps died away on the hard mud of the yard, the warm silence  fell again over the kitchen and, in the midst of it, a modern Lot's  wife, Mrs. Byron sat strangely still.  The steam died off the surface of  the water, the sun crept a little farther into the room and the untidy  pile of breakfast crocks gave back a glint here and a dazzle there.  Mrs. Byron was undeniably shaken.  Her poor hands were trembling and now  and again a quiver passed over the rubicund cheeks.  It was as if the  woman would have wept, as if only a summer rain could have dissolved the  ice at her heart, but as if the source of tears had for too long been  dry.    At the sound of the yard-man's voice she raised eyes which, though  tearless, were dim.  Jim seemed a long way off but kind and human.  She  was old enough to be his mother and, like a mother who has secret  sorrows, she answered him.    \"I'm down in the dumps to-day, terr'bly.  'Aven't got any 'eart for  nothing.\"    \"Can I do anything for 'ee, missis?\"    Being the eldest of a 'long tail,' he was used to doing odd jobs for a  woman; and, at Treketh, his mother, dependent now on the unsatisfactory  help of younger boys, sent him daily a regretful thought.  Jim had been  so handy, so good-natured.    Rousing herself, Mrs. Byron looked about.  \"You might light up the fire  in the cloam oven for me, Jim, there's a good sawl.\"    Breaking a faggot apart he filled the oven with bushes and set a light  to them.  The smoke curled up the black chimney and little flames ran  along the brittle wood. When the earthenware sides were sparkling hot  the oven would be ready for the tins of bread, the cakes and pasties  which were to feed the household during the ensuing week.    \"Anything else I can do for 'ee while oven's hettin'?\"    Mrs. Byron's eyes were the brave frozen blue of the seafarer and  wistfulness was not possible to them, nevertheless Jim was conscious of  that quality in their gaze. The son of a cross-grained father, words  were not needed to tell him that the Byrons had had a difference.  He  moved deftly about, emptying the cool water and replacing it with hot,  setting out the array of loaf tins and filling a scuttle.  He was glad  to be of use.  It made him think of happy evenings with his mother, made  him wonder which of the elder boys, Sidney or Charley, was carrying coal  and water for her and what hand they made of it.    \"Anything else, missis?\"    She had watched him unseeingly, but with a growing sense of comfort.  \"I'm in better 'eart now you've helped me so.\"  She would have this  young man at hand to help her in all her future difficulties and the  thought was reassuring.  \"'Tis near time for 'ee to be goin' into Stowe.  Gray's all but ready.\"    As if she had been called, the girl opened the door of the linhay.  At  sight of Jim, a sight by no means unexpected, her pale-tinted face  bloomed like an opening rose.    \"Good mornin', Jim.  You're late.\"  If only he had come one little  half-hour sooner!    He was looking spruce in clean shirt and new tie, a fresh smooth-skinned  youngster.  \"Well, my dear,\" he said awkwardly, \"I 'ad a lot to do this  mornin' before I could come away.\"    \"Jim 'ad to put 'is best bib and tucker on,\" said Mrs. Byron.  Her  interest in these opening lives helped her to push her anxieties into  the background.  Never one to nurse a grief, she smiled at the boy and  girl, glad to be looking at a morning face.    \"I'd thought,\" said Gray, and in her voice was a regret he could not  fathom, \"you'd be earlier, so as to take the chickens and eggs.\"    \"Well, to tell 'ee the truth,\" the young man threw himself on her mercy,  \"I went down in the orchard to see if I could find a few vi'lets for  yer.  I want yer to look vitty to-day.\"  He stepped back into the porch,  returning with a little posy.  In the West, flowers bloom the year  round, and these were scented violets.    \"Oh, Jim,\" said the girl, taking them--and could say no more.  The  violets were a charming thought; but if he had only known what hung on  his keeping to the arrangement he had made with her the previous day, to  come to the linhay after breakfast!    \"Your uncle wants to go in with yer,\" said Mrs. Byron, making an effort  to speak of the matter with her customary cheerfulness, \"but I bain't  goin' to let'n go.\"  She was rewarded by a grateful glance from Gray, a  glance which laid for all time the incipient doubts of a natural  jealousy. \"Now Jim, by the time you've tackled up Lady, Gray'll be  ready.  My dear,\" she turned to the girl, standing dreamily by the  table, the violets in her hand, \"'av you finished the butter?\"    In the warm air of the kitchen the flowers were giving forth their  scent.  \"Yes, and packed it,\" said Gray, raising the posy to her face.  It had been dearly bought.    \"Couldn't find your dress anywhere this mornin'. What 'av 'ee done with  it?\"    \"Aunt Louisa carried it to ma's, and ma said I'd better come up there  and dress.\"    Mrs. Byron looked disappointed.  \"P'raps 'tis best,\" she said, common  sense triumphing as was usual with her, over the longing for a little  personal gratification, \"still I should like to 'av seen the costume.\"    \"Well, I'll wear it down to-morrow for you to see.\"    \"Iss, my dear, do.\"    The girl looked affectionately at the older woman, conscious for a  moment of her disabilities and her still young heart.  \"I wish you could  come, auntie.\"    \"You don't wish it more'n I do.\"  She shook her head, but in her eyes  the old smile was relit.  She had resigned herself and with her, when a  decision was reached, the natural thing was to turn from it to the next  item on the programme of life.  \"Now, my dear, you must make haste and  clear off,\" she said, beginning to roll up the sleeves of her blue  cotton gown.  The day promised to be busy and it was high time the young  people were on their way.  She did not even wait until Gray was out of  the room before reaching down for the 'springing' dough.  The oven was  nearly ready, but she was all behindhand.  That would never do.    The atmosphere which Mrs. Byron diffused was so practical, so reassuring  that it had soothed her young cousin's natural distress.  As the girl  walked quickly away to the room they shared, though she could not  altogether forget the scene with Leadville, she remembered that she was  about to escape from his importunities; and, though an occasional  shudder still shook her, she"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53372"],[0,"Star of India (#16)"],[1,"e. From him Stella gathered  much local lore, curious stories of native village life. He expounded to  her the system of self-government, old as the East. She caught glimpses  of an ingrained faith in the power of spells and charms that all went  back to the worship of Nature, though their origins had long been lost  sight of, obscured by time.    It was with genuine regret that she returned to the station to \"settle  down,\" according to Robert, for the hot weather months. Rassih looked  dusty and drear after the groves and cultivation of the district, the  house felt more vast and oppressive, the outlook over the desert was one  endless yellow haze. Preparations proceeded for the fierce heat that was  at hand. Punkahs were hung from the ceilings, clumsy machines called  \"thermantidotes\" made their appearance for the purpose of pumping cooled  air into the rooms when the moment should arrive, screens of  sweet-scented grass lay piled in the verandas, to be erected in the  doorways and kept damp when the west wind should sweep and swirl over  the land by day, and often by night as well.    The only change that threatened the social community was the coming  departure of the Cuthells. The transfer took place shortly after the  Crayfields' return to the station, and Mrs. Cuthell paid her farewell  respects to the Commissioner's wife bursting with satisfaction, her  broad face one beam of rejoicing and excitement.    \"I can't describe to you how thankful we are to be leaving this dreadful  place, Mrs. Crayfield, especially just as the hot weather is beginning.  Only wait till it is in full blast, my dear, and then won't you wish you  were out of it too! Rassih is one of the hottest stations in India, and  this house, for all its height and space, can be a veritable oven. It's  such luck that we are going to the hills on duty. You must ask your  husband to let you come up to us for a visit. You will lose your bright  complexion and good spirits, and get fever and prickly heat and all the  rest of it if you stay here too long.\"    \"It is very kind of you,\" rejoined Stella, unperturbed by these awful  forebodings, \"but I'm really rather looking forward to the experience.\"    Mrs. Cuthell glanced round the great drawing-room, that certainly of  late had undergone much improvement, but all the same she gave a little  shudder.    \"Well, of course you can but try it,\" she croaked; \"but in addition to  definite drawbacks, I always feel that this house is so creepy. I  suppose on account of its history--all those poor women and children  being murdered here at the time of the mutiny. It seems so horrible to  think of the officers cut down on parade, and then their families hiding  here on the roof. They say the mutineers did not think of looking for  them on the roof, and were just leaving the compound when one woman  peeped over the parapet and they saw her. Of course, it was all up with  the poor creatures; they were dragged down and murdered. It is difficult  to realise that it all happened less than forty years ago.\"    She paused abruptly at the sight of Stella's white face and  horror-stricken eyes. \"Oh, didn't you know?\" she inquired with remorse.  \"I'm so sorry I spoke of it, but I never dreamt----\"    Stella gulped down her horror, but for the moment all her enthusiasm for  India turned to revulsion. That dark page of history had hitherto seemed  so remote, so unreal, like some tragedy of the Middle Ages long since  forgotten and forgiven. Now the fact of its comparative recency, the  vision of those defenceless women and children dragged down from the  actual roof that was above her head, to be butchered without mercy in  these very rooms, affected her acutely. How could she exist month after  month in a dwelling that must be saturated with such agonising memories?    \"Now, if anyone tells you that extraordinary noises are sometimes heard  during the hot weather,\" continued Mrs. Cuthell with the best  intentions, \"don't take any notice. I have never believed in ghosts  myself, and probably if there _are_ noises they come from the  underground ruins--falling of masonry, and so on.\"    \"The underground ruins!\" repeated Stella. What was she to hear next?    \"Yes. You know, one of the old Moghul emperors--I forget his name--was  supposed to have dug himself a subterranean living-place, because he was  blind--ophthalmia, no doubt, like so many natives. Anyway, all  underneath the house and compound there are said to be tunnels and  chambers, and an oil tank and treasure, and goodness knows what. The  emperor went to war with some neighbouring enemy and got killed, so  that he and his followers never came back, and what they left  underground nobody knows.\"    \"And has nobody ever tried to find out?\" asked Stella, her curiosity  aflame.    \"I believe your husband's predecessor in the appointment got leave to  dig. He used the prisoners from the jail, but so many accidents  happened--men fell into holes and broke their limbs, or died from the  bad air, and were bitten by snakes, and in the middle of it all the  Commissioner went mad and committed suicide by jumping over the parapet  at the back of the house. Of course, the natives said the digging had  brought bad luck----\" Again Mrs. Cuthell feared she had been indiscreet.  \"But you mustn't think of these things,\" she added cheerfully. \"There is  hardly an old house in India that hasn't some unpleasant story, and I'm  sure you are far too sensible to let your mind dwell on anything that  may have happened in the past.\"    It had been far from Mrs. Cuthell's intention to leave a legacy of  apprehension and disquietude to the Commissioner's young wife, though  she had never quite forgiven the usurpation of her throne as chief  memsahib of the station by one so much her junior. With all her shallow  outlook, Mrs. Cuthell owned a well-meaning disposition, and now she  sincerely regretted that in her selfish elation and glee she should have  alarmed and depressed the poor girl, however unwittingly, as she could  not fail to perceive had been the result of her chatter.    \"Now do remember,\" she said with an affectionately repentant farewell,  \"if you find you can't stand the heat you have only to write and say you  are coming to us, and we shall be truly delighted to put you up for as  long as you like. I mean it.\"    Stella murmured her gratitude. She divined Mrs. Cuthell's self-reproach,  and realised the wisdom of her advice not to allow her mind to dwell on  the information so thoughtlessly imparted. After all, if Mrs. Cuthell  had not divulged the history of the house, someone else would have done  so sooner or later; it was only a wonder she had not heard it all before  now. She freely forgave Mrs. Cuthell, and was sorry to see the last of  her. Had Robert allowed her to make a friend she would have chosen Mrs.  Cuthell, who at least was simple and true. Stella did not trust Mrs.  Piggott. Mrs. Antonio and Pussy were out of the question as intimates.  She had nothing in common with Mrs. Beard, and she had seen little of  the other ladies. None of them had made friendly advances beyond their  first calls, and a self-interested attendance at Mrs. Crayfield's weekly  \"at homes,\" when they were assured of good tennis and refreshments and  an enjoyable afternoon.    Nevertheless, Stella had Mrs. Cuthell to thank for a sleepless night,  that was followed at intervals by many others. She lay awake visualising  horrors, listening with dread for \"extraordinary sounds,\" though she  heard nothing more startling than the usual chorus of jackals and hyenas  outside, the snores of a servant in one of the verandas, and the  coughing and murmuring of the night guard. She made no confession of her  fears to Robert. For one thing she suspected that his silence  concerning the stories and associations of the place had been due not so  much to consideration for her peace of mind as for his own convenience,  and she could well understand his motive. A wife with \"nerves,\"  despondent, anxious to escape, would not be at all to his taste. But her  efforts to conceal her apprehensions and her antipathy to the house only  added to the strain.          CHAPTER IX      The Cuthells' successor was reported to be a bachelor. Of course, Mrs.  Piggott professed to have knowledge of his history even before he  arrived in the station. She told Mrs. Crayfield he was a very rising  civilian who was considered far too brilliant to be wasted on ordinary  district administration, and therefore it was intended that he should  merely mark time at Rassih pending his elevation to some important  appointment.    \"And one can just fancy,\" she added spitefully, \"what a conceited prig  he must be, what airs he will give himself, and how he will despise us  all! I haven't a doubt he's about five foot high, with short sight and a  head too big for his body, can't ride or shoot, and is probably the son  of a shopkeeper at Tooting or some equally refined locality. The sort of  creature who gets into the Civil Service by cramming to the last ounce.  They'll be the ruin of India, because the right kind of natives know  they aren't 'sahibs' and hate them accordingly, while the wrong sort  take advantage of their weak points. I hope you'll sit on him well, Mrs.  Crayfield.\"    Stella felt a faint curiosity to view a sample of the competitive system  so condemned by Mrs. Piggott. She had also heard her husband deplore the  modern measures that permitted Messrs. Brown, Jones and Robinson to  help govern the most aristocratic country in the world. But one morning,  within the orthodox and inconvenient hours decreed for first calls in  the East (one of the few relics of old John Company customs), when the  visiting card of Mr. Philip Ferguson Flint was brought to her, it was  followed by no under-sized, top-heavy specimen such as Mrs. Piggott had  described, but by a good-looking fellow not much over thirty, with  friendly"]]]
