Attentive observation, and the knowledge that  the noise in question proceeded not from the exterior of an insect,  but from the throat of a bird, has led me to form another conclusion.  I am not surprised at my having fallen into the error; for the song of  this bird is but an exaggeration of the grasshopper's note, and  resembles the noise produced by pulling out the line from the winch of  a fishing-rod, no less continuous is it, nor more melodious. Many  years afterwards, when the memory of these pleasant wanderings had  faded away, I happened one evening in May to be passing across a  common in Hertfordshire, skirted by a hedge of brushwood, when the old  familiar sound fell on my ear like a forgotten nursery melody. The  trees not being in their full foliage, I was not without hope that I  might be able to get a sight of the performer, whom I now knew to be a  bird, and I crept quietly towards the spot whence the noise proceeded.  Had it been singing in a copse-wood instead of a hedge, I should  certainly have failed, for there is the same peculiarity about its  note that there is about that of the insect--you cannot make up your  mind exactly whereabouts the instrument which makes the noise is at  work. The note, when near, is continuous, monotonous, and of equal  loudness throughout; it might be a minute spinning-wheel revolving  rapidly, or a straw pipe with a pea in it blown with a single breath  and then suddenly stopping. But whether the performance is going on  exactly before you, a little to the right, or a little to the left, it  is hard to decide. I approached to within a few yards of the hedge,  and peered through the hazel rods, now decorated with drooping tufts  of plaited leaves, but all in vain. I went a step or two nearer; the  sound ceased, and the movement of a twig directed my attention towards  a particular bush, on which I saw a little bird, about as big as a  Hedge Sparrow, quietly and cautiously dropping branch by branch to  the ground. In a few minutes I observed it again a few yards off,  creeping with a movement resembling that of the Nuthatch up another  bush. Having reached to nearly the summit it became motionless,  stretched out its neck, and keeping its mandibles continuously open  and slightly elevated, commenced its trill again; then it shuffled  about for some seconds and repeated the strain. It now seemed to  descry me, and dropping to the ground as before, reappeared a few  yards off. I fancied that while actually singing its feathers were  ruffled; but in the imperfect twilight I could not decide positively.  That it kept its mandibles motionless while singing, I had no doubt.  Half an hour afterwards, at a quarter to eight, I returned from my  walk, and observed it several times go through precisely the same  manA\"uvres. On no occasion did it make a long flight, but even when  I scared it by throwing a stone into the hedge near it, it merely  dropped to the ground, and in a minute or two was piping from another  bush. I have not found, as some authors say, that it resorts only to  the vicinity of watery places. The one which I saw on this occasion  had located itself for the summer several miles from a stream; and  others which I have heard night after night had settled down on the  skirts of a dry common, watered only by the clouds. Its nest I have  sought for in vain.

Whatever question there may be whether the name of Willow-warbler be  appropriately applied to the last species, there can be no doubt that  the Chiff-chaff is well named. Let any one be asked in the month of  May to walk into a wood and to hold up his hand when he heard a bird  call itself by its own name, 'Chiff-chaff', he could not possibly fall  into an error. The bird is so common that it would be difficult to  walk a mile in a woodland district without passing near one or more,  and having little to say, it seems never weary of repeating its tale,  'Chiff, chaff, cheff, chiff, chaff': the syllables have a harsh sound  pronounced by human lips, but when chanted in the silvery notes of a  little bird, in the season of primroses and wild hyacinths, and  accompanied by the warble of the Hay-bird, the full song of the  Thrush, and the whistle of the Blackbird, they contribute not a little  to the harmony of the woods.    For two successive years a little yellowish bird, scarcely bigger than  a wren, has established himself in my garden about the middle of  April, and sedulously devoted himself to clearing away the aphides  which infested some China roses trained against the walls of my house.  Occasionally he would flutter against the windows, and give his  attention to the spiders and gnats which nestled in the corners of the  panes. The first year I took him for a Hay-bird, but, only too  grateful for his kind offices, I was careful not to molest him. When,  however, he appeared a second year, exactly at the same season, and  performed a series of manA\"uvres so precisely similar that it was  impossible to doubt that the bird was not merely of the same species,  but the same individual, I watched him more closely. The dark colour  of his feet, as observed from within the house, as he was fluttering  against the glass, decided the point that he was not a Hay-bird, and  when he retired to an apple-tree hard by and treated himself to a song  after his repast, no doubt remained that he was a Chiff-chaff. It is  not often that the Chiff-chaff is thus familiar in its habits. More  frequently it makes its abode in woods and groves, resembling the  Hay-bird so closely in size, colour and habits, that to distinguish  the two is very difficult. The difference of note, however, is  decisive; and the colour of the feet (when the bird is near enough to  admit of being thus distinguished) is another certain criterion. The  two birds frequent the same trees without rivalry or jealousy. The  Chiff-chaff is the earliest of our spring visitors, arriving the  middle of March, and it sings all through the summer; I have heard it  as late as the thirtieth of September. The nests, popularly called  'wood-ovens', are alike and placed in similar situations; their eggs  are of the same size and shape, but those of the Chiff-chaff are  spotted with very dark purple instead of rust colour. A few  occasionally remain with us all the year, feeding on winter gnats and  the pupA| of small insects, but remaining wholly silent. Other names by  which it is known are 'Chip-chop' and Lesser Pettichaps.        THE WILLOW-WARBLER     PHYLLA\"SCOPUS TRA\"CHILUS        Upper parts bright olive-green; a narrow streak of yellow over      the eye; under parts yellowish white, palest in the middle;      feathers of the leg yellow; second primary equal to the sixth;      third, fourth, and fifth with the outer web sloped off at the      extremity; feet stoutish; legs light brown. Length nearly five      inches; breadth eight. Eggs white, more or less speckled with      rust colour.    There seems to be no sufficient reason why this bird should be named  Willow-warbler or Willow-wren, as it shows no special preference for  willows, nor does it frequent watery places. The popular name,  'Hay-bird', is, I think, the better of the two; for, except in the  extreme west of England, wherever there are hayfields and trees these  birds are to be found; they build their nests principally of hay, and  very frequently place it in the border of a hay-field. But, by  whatever name it is known, it is a cheerful and active little bird, to  which our woods and groves are much indebted for their melody. It is  abundant and generally diffused, arriving in England early in April,  and remaining until the middle of September. During the greater part  of this period, it may be seen fluttering about the tops of trees,  hunting the twigs and leaves for insects, and occasionally catching  flies on the wing. It often, too, descends to the ground, and picks up  insects among the herbage. I have never heard it sing on the ground;  but while employing itself aloft, it rarely allows more than a few  minutes to elapse without going through its short and sweet song.  This, though very agreeable, possesses no great variety, and is  composed of about twenty or thirty notes, the latter ones of which are  repeated rapidly, and form a natural cadence. For many years this  pleasant little melody, or the simpler song of the Chiff-chaff, has  been the first sound I have heard to announce the arrival of the  summer birds of passage; perhaps it is on this account that it is with  me, at all seasons, a favourite rural sound.    Ornithologists seem well agreed that the Willow-warbler's food  consists entirely of insects. This may be so, but I am much mistaken  if a brood of this species annually hatched in a bank of furze  adjoining my garden, do not, in conjunction with Blackcaps and  Whitethroats, pay daily visits to a certain row of red raspberries in  my garden. It may be that they come only in quest of aphides, but I  have certainly seen them in dangerous proximity to clusters of the  ripest fruit, which, when they were scared away,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3810"],[0,"The Man-Eaters of Tsavo, and Other East African Adventures (#16)"],[1,"peace-loving people,  though when driven to it by hunger they will commit very cruel and  treacherous acts of wholesale murder. While the railway was being  constructed, a severe famine occurred in their part of the country,  when hundreds of them died of starvation. During this period they  several times swooped down on isolated railway maintenance gangs and  utterly annihilated them, in order to obtain possession of the food  which they knew would be stored in the camps. These attacks were always  made by night. Like most other native races in East Africa, their only  arms are the bow and poisoned arrow, but in the use of these primitive  weapons they are specially expert. The arrow-head remains in the flesh  when the shaft is withdrawn, and if the poison is fresh, paralysis and  death very quickly follow, the skin round the wound turning yellow and  mortifying within an hour or two. This deadly poison is obtained, I  believe, by boiling down a particular root, the arrow-heads being  dipped in the black, pitchy-looking essence which remains. I am glad to  say, however, that owing to the establishment of several Mission  Stations amongst them, the Wa Kamba are quickly becoming the most  civilised natives in the country; and the missionaries have adopted the  sensible course of teaching the people husbandry and the practical arts  and crafts of everyday life, in addition to caring for their spiritual  needs.          CHAPTER XII    A NIGHT AFTER HIPPO      During my stay at Tsavo I made many little excursions into the  surrounding country, and used to go off on a short shooting and  exploring expedition whenever I had the opportunity. I was especially  anxious to bag a hippopotamus, so I made up my mind to try my luck on  the banks of the Sabaki. Unfortunately, I possessed no heavy rifle,  which is almost a necessity for hippo shooting, but it occurred to me  to supply the deficiency by manufacturing a few cartridges for my  smoothbore. In these I had double charges of powder and a hardened  bullet made of lead mixed with about an eighth part of tin. I well  remember the anxiety with which I fired the first round of my home-made  ammunition. As I more than half expected that the barrel would burst, I  lashed the gun in the fork of a tree, tied a piece of string a hundred  feet long to the trigger, and then--taking shelter behind a friendly  stump--pulled off. To my great satisfaction the barrel stood the test  perfectly. More than that, on trying the penetrative effect of my  bullets, I found that they would smash through a steel plate an eighth  of an inch thick at thirty yards' range. This was quite good enough for  my purpose, and gave me great confidence in the weapon. All the same, I  had a very narrow escape one day while manufacturing some of this  ammunition. My plan was to remove the shot from the cartridge, put in  the additional powder, and ram this well in before replacing the wad  and putting in the bullet. I had clamped my refilling machine to my  rough-hewn table, and was stamping the double charge of powder well  down into the cartridge, when suddenly, for some unknown reason, the  whole charge exploded right into my face. Everything became pitch dark  to me, and I groped my way about the little hut in agony of mind as  well as of body, for I thought I had been blinded. I am thankful to  say, however, that gleams of light soon began to return to my eyes, and  in a few hours' time I was almost all right again and able to go on  with my cartridge making.    All my preparations having been made, I set out for the Sabaki, taking  with me my Indian gun-bearer Mahina, my cook Mabruki, a bhisti  (water-carrier), and a couple of natives to carry our odds and ends. On  these occasions I usually took no tent, but bivouacked in the open. We  took some bread and a few tinned provisions with us, but I could always  depend upon getting a paa, guinea-fowl, partridge or rock-rabbit for  the larder on the march. These rock-rabbits are more like big rats than  rabbits, and are found in great numbers among the rocks along the banks  of the rivers. They are not at all bad eating, but the Swahili will not  touch them. They call them tupu (shameless, naked things), owing to  their lack of a tail, of which indeed they possess not even a vestige.    Our route lay by the always interesting Tsavo River. Along the banks  everything within reach of its moisture is delightfully fresh and  green. Palms and other trees, festooned with brilliant flowering  creepers, flourish along its course; all kinds of monkeys chatter and  jabber in the shade overhead as they swing themselves from branch to  branch, while birds of the most gorgeous plumage flutter about, giving  a very tropical aspect to the scene. On the other hand, if one is  tempted to stray away from the river, be it only for a few yards, one  comes immediately into the parched, thorny wilderness of stunted,  leafless trees. Here the sun beats down pitilessly, and makes the nyika  of the Tsavo valley almost intolerable. The river has its source at the  foot of snow-crowned Kilima N'jaro, whence it flows for about eighty  miles in a northerly direction until it joins the Athi River, about  seven miles below Tsavo Station. From this point the united streams  take the name of Sabaki and flow more or less eastwards until they  reach the Indian Ocean at Malindi, some seventy miles north of Mombasa.    A narrow and tortuous Masai warpath winds along its whole length, but  although we followed this trail our journey was nevertheless a very  slow one, owing to the overhanging branches and creepers, from which we  had constantly to be disengaged. The march was full of interest,  however, for it was not long before we came upon fresh tracks both of  hippo and rhino. Every now and again, also, we caught glimpses of  startled bush-buck and water-buck, while occasionally the sound of a  splash in the water told of a wary crocodile. We had gone about half  the distance to the Sabaki when we came upon an unexpected obstacle in  the shape of a great ridge of barren, rugged rock, about a hundred feet  high, which extended for about a mile or so on both banks of the river.  The sides of this gorge went sheer down into the water, and were quite  impossible to scale. I therefore determined to make a detour round it,  but Mahina was confident that he could walk along in the river itself.  I hinted mildly at the possibility of there being crocodiles under the  rocky ledges. Mahina declared, however, that there was no danger, and  making a bundle of his lower garments, he tied it to his back and  stepped into the water. For a few minutes all went well. Then, in an  instant, he was lifted right off his feet by the rush of the water and  whirled away. The river took a sharp bend in this gorge, and he was  round it and out of our sight in no time, the last glimpse we caught of  him showing him vainly trying to catch hold of an overhanging branch.  Although we at once made all the haste we could to get round the ridge  of rocks, it took us nearly half an hour to do it. I had almost given  up hope of ever seeing Mahina again, and was much relieved, therefore,  when we reached the river-side once more, to find him safe and sound,  and little the worse for his adventure. Luckily he had been dashed up  against a rushy bank, and had managed to scramble out with no more  serious damage than a bruised shin.    Eventually we arrived at the junction of the rivers and proceeded some  way down the Sabaki, beside which the Tsavo looks very insignificant.  Several islands are dotted about in mid-stream and are overgrown with  tall reeds and rushes, in which hippo find capital covert all the year  round. As with the Tsavo, the banks of the Sabaki are lined with trees  of various kinds, affording most welcome shade from the heat of the  sun: and skirting the river is a caravan road from the interior--still  used, I believe, for smuggling slaves and ivory to the coast, where  dhows are in readiness to convey them to Persia or Arabia.    After an early dinner, which Mabruki soon got ready, I left my  followers encamped in a safe boma a mile away from the river, and  started out with Mahina to find a suitable tree, near a hippo \"run\", in  which to spend the night. Having some difficulty in finding a likely  spot, we crossed to the other side of the river--rather a risky thing  to do on account of the number of crocodiles in it: we found a fairly  shallow ford, however, and managed to get safely over. Here, on what  was evidently an island during flood time, we found innumerable traces  of both hippo and rhino--in fact the difficulty was to decide which  track was the best and freshest. At length I picked out a tree close to  the river and commanding a stretch of sand which was all flattened down  and looked as if at least one hippo rolled there regularly every night.    As there was still about an hour before sundown, we did not take up our  station at once, but proceeded along the bank to see if any other game  was about. We had not gone very far when Mahina, who was a little way  ahead, signalled to me, and on joining him I saw a splendid-looking  water-buck standing in a shallow pool of the river. It was the first  time I had seen one of these fine antelope, and I was delighted with  the sight. I might have got twenty yards or so nearer, but I thought I  had better not risk moving, so I aimed at the shoulder and fired. The  buck gave one leap into the air, and then turned and galloped quickly  behind an island which completely hid him from view. We waited for him  to clear the rushes at the other end of this island, but as he did not  appear I got impatient and plunged into the river, regardless of  crocodiles or anything else. On rounding the island, however, he was  nowhere to be seen, and had evidently turned off while in the shelter  of the reeds and so gained the opposite bank. I was keenly disappointed "]]]
