We allude to the _Etudes Diplomatiques et Litteraires_ of  Count Alexis de Saint Priest. On the partition of Poland especially, it  casts an entirely new and conclusive light. M. Saint Priest shows that  apart from the internal anarchy and weakness of Poland, the catastrophe  was the work not of Russia as has been commonly supposed, but of  Frederic the Great of Prussia. Russia had no interest in dividing  Poland; in fact she was already supreme in that country; and besides,  her policy has never been that of an active initiative,--she waits for  the fruit to fall, and does not take the trouble of shaking the tree  herself. The great criminal then in this Polish affair was Prussia, and  the cause was the historic antagonism between Germany and Poland. M.  Saint Priest sketches the character of Frederic with the hand of a  master. \"We shall see him,\" he says in approaching that part of his  subject, \"we shall see him as he was, both adventurous and patient,  ardent and calm, full of passion yet perfectly self-possessed, capable  of embracing the vastest horizon and of shutting himself up for the  moment in the most limited detail, his eyes reaching to the farthest  distance, his hand active in the nearest vicinity, approaching his aim  step by step through by-paths, but always gaining it at last by a single  bound. We shall see him employing the most indefatigable, the most  tenacious, the most persevering will in the service of his idea,  preparing it, maturing it by long and skillful reparation, and imposing  it on Europe not by sudden violence, but by the successive and cunning  employment of flattery and intimidation. And finally, when all is  consummated, we shall see him succeed in avoiding the responsibility and  throwing it altogether upon his coadjutors, with an art all the more  profound for the simplicity under which its hardihood was concealed, and  the indifference which masked its avidity. To crown so audacious a  maneuver, he will not hesitate to declare, that \"since he has never  deceived any one, he will still less deceive posterity! And in fact he  has treated them with a perfect equality: he made a mock of posterity as  well as of his contemporaries.\" With regard to the part of France in the  division of Poland, M. Saint Priest attempts to prove that the French  monarchy could not prevent the catastrophe; but that it was in the  revolutionary elements then fermenting in France and opposed to the  monarchy, that Frederic found his most powerful allies. Of course he  defends the monarchy from blame in the matter, and we shall not  undertake to say that he is wrong in so doing. Certainly the downfall of  Poland cannot be regarded as an isolated event, but as a part of the  great series of movements belonging to the age, in which causes the most  antagonistic in their nature often cooperated in producing the same  effect. M. Saint Priest further reasons that the providential mission of  Poland was to oppose Turkey and Islamism, and when the latter ceased to  rise the former necessarily declined. But our space will not permit us  to follow this interesting work any farther. The careful students of  history will not fail to consult it for themselves.           *       *       *       *       *    Mary Lowell Putnam, a daughter of the Rev. Dr. Lowell of Boston, and  sister of James Russell Lowell, the poet, is the author of an  annihilating reviewal, in the last _Christian Examiner_, of Mr. Bowen on  the Hungarian Struggle for Independence. The _Tribune_ contains a  _resume_ of the controversy, in which it had itself been honorably  distinguished, and furnishes the following sketch of Professor Bowen's  antagonist:         \"Without any ambition for literary distinction, leading a life of       domestic duties and retirement, and pursuing the most profound and       various studies from an insatiate thirst for knowledge, this       admirable person has shown herself qualified to cope with the       difficulties of a complicated historical question, and to vanquish       a notorious Professor on his own ground. The manner in which she       has executed her task (and her victim) is as remarkable for its       unpretending modesty as for its singular acuteness and logical       ability. She writes with the graceful facility of one who is       entirely at home on the subject, conversant from long familiarity       with its leading points, and possessing a large surplus of       information in regard to it for which she has no present use. If       she exhibits a generous sympathy with the cause of the oppressed,       she does not permit the warmth of her feelings to cloud the       serenity of her judgment. She conducts the argument with an almost       legal precision, and compels her opponent to submit to the force of       her intellect.\"    Harvard would certainly be a large gainer if Mrs. Putnam could succeed  Mr. Bowen as professor of _History_, or,--as the libeller of Kossuth  _fills_ so small a portion of the chair,--if she could be made associate  professor; but to this she would have objections.           *       *       *       *       *    In Leipsic a monument has been erected by the German agriculturists to  Herr Thaer, who has done so much amongst them for agricultural science.  It consists of a marble column nine feet high, on which stands the  statue of Thaer, life size. It is surrounded by granite steps and an  iron balustrade. The column bears the inscription, \"To their respected  teacher, Albert Thaer, the German Agriculturists--1850.\"           *       *       *       *       *    A New Novel by Bulwer Lytton is announced by Bentley, to appear in three  volumes. Dickens, having completed his \"David Copperfield,\" will  immediately commence a new serial story. Thackeray, it is rumored, has a  new work in preparation altogether different from anything he has yet  published. The Lives of Shakspeare's Heroines are announced to appear in  a series of volumes.           *       *       *       *       *    \"Sir Roger de Coverly: By the Spectator,\" is one of the newest and most  beautiful books from the English press. It is illustrated by Thompson,  from designs by Frederick Tayler, and edited with much judgment by Mr.  Henry Wills. The idea of the book is an extremely happy one. It is not  always easy to pick out of the eight volumes of the _Spectator_ the  papers which relate to _Sir Roger de Coverley_, when we happen to want  them. Here we have them all, following close upon each other, forming so  many chapters of the Coverley Chronicle, telling a succinct and charming  story, with just so much pleasing extract from other papers as to throw  light upon the doings of Sir Roger, and enough graceful talk about the  London of Queen Anne's time (by way of annotation) to adapt one's mind  completely to the de Coverley tone of sentiment. The _Spectator_--we  mean the modern gazette of that name--says of it:--         \"The character of Sir Roger de Coverley is a creation which, in its       way, has never been surpassed; never perhaps equaled except by the       _Vicar of Wakefield_. The de Coverley establishment and the Vicar's       family have a strong general likeness. They are the same       simple-minded, kind-hearted English souls, in different spheres of       society. The thirty papers of the _Spectator_ devoted to Sir Roger       and his associates, now that we have them together, form a perfect       little novel in themselves, from the reading of which we rise as we       rise from that of Goldsmith, healthier and happier. There never was       so beautiful an illustration of how far mere genuine heartiness of       disposition and rectitude of purpose can impart true dignity to a       character, as Sir Roger de Coverley. He is rather beloved than       esteemed. He talks all the way up stairs on a visit. He is a       walking epitome of as many vulgar errors as Sir Thomas Browne       collected in his book. He has grave doubts as to the propriety of       not having an old woman indicted for a witch. He is brimful of the       prejudices of his caste. He has grown old with the simplicity of a       child. Captain Sentry must keep him in talk lest he expose himself       at the play. And yet about all he does there is an unassuming       dignity that commands respect; and for strength and consistency in       the tender passion Petrarch himself does not excel him. Sir Roger's       unvarying devotion to his widow, his incessant recurrence to the       memory of his affection to her, the remarks relating to her which       the character of Andromache elicits from him at the play, and the       little incident of her message to him on his death-bed, form as       choice a record of passionate fidelity as the sonnets of the       Italian. How beautiful, too, is that death-scene--how quietly       sublime! Let us add that the good Sir Roger is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3788"],[0,"Haydn (#16)"],[1,", No. 1, the new Lord Mayor and his wife dined, the Lord  Chancellor, the two sheriffs, the Duke of Lids [Leeds], the minister  Pitt, and others of the highest rank in the Cabinet. I was seated at  No. 2 with Mr Sylvester, the most celebrated advocate and first King's  counsel in London. In this hall, called the Geld Hall [Guildhall], were  six tables, besides others in the adjoining room. About twelve hundred  persons altogether dined, and everything was in the greatest splendour.  The dishes were very nice and well dressed. Wines of every kind in  abundance. We sat down to dinner at six o'clock and rose from table  at eight. The guests accompanied the Lord Mayor both before and after  dinner in their order of precedence. There were various ceremonies,  sword bearing, and a kind of golden crown, all attended by a band of  wind instruments. After dinner, the whole of the aristocratic guests of  No. 1 withdrew into a private room prepared for them, to have tea and  coffee, while the rest of the company were conducted into another room.  At nine o'clock No. 1 repaired to a small saloon, when the ball began.  There was a raised platform in this room, reserved for the highest  nobility, where the Lord Mayor and his wife were seated on a throne.  Dancing then commenced in due order of precedence, but only one couple  at a time, just as on January 6, the King's birthday. There were raised  benches on both sides of this room with four steps, where the fair sex  chiefly prevailed. Nothing but minuets were danced in this saloon, but  I could only remain for a quarter of an hour, first, because the heat of  so many people assembled in such a narrow space was so oppressive, and,  secondly, on account of the bad music for dancing, the whole orchestra  consisting of two violins and a violoncello; the minuets were more in  the Polish style than in our own, or that of the Italians. I proceeded  into another room, which really was more like a subterranean cave than  anything else; they were dancing English dances, and the music here was  a degree better, as a drum was played by one of the violinists! [This  might be effected by the violin player having the drumstick tied to his  right foot, which was sometimes done.]    I went on to the large hall, where we had dined, and there the orchestra  was more numerous, and the music more tolerable. They were also dancing  English dances, but only opposite the raised platform where the four  first sets had dined with the Lord Mayor. The other tables were all  filled afresh with gentlemen, who as usual drank freely the whole night.  The strangest thing of all was that one part of the company went on  dancing without hearing a single note of the music, for first at one  table, and then at another, songs were shouted, or toasts given, amidst  the most crazy uproar and clinking of glasses and hurrahs. This hall and  all the other rooms were lighted with lamps, of which the effluvia was  most disagreeable, especially in the small ballroom. It was remarkable  that the Lord Mayor had no need of a carving-knife, as a man in the  centre of the table carved everything for him. One man stood before the  Lord Mayor and another behind him, shouting out vociferously all the  toasts in their order according to etiquette, and after each toast came  a flourish of kettledrums and trumpets. No health was more applauded  than that of Mr Pitt. There seemed to be no order. The dinner cost 6,000  pounds, one-half of which is paid by the Lord Mayor, and the other half  by the two sheriffs.    Royalty Again    In this same month--November--he visited the Marionettes at the  Fantoccini Theatre in Saville Row, prompted, no doubt, by old  associations with Esterhaz. On the 24th he went to Oatlands to visit the  Duke of York, who had just married the Princess of Prussia. \"I remained  two days,\" he says, \"and enjoyed many marks of graciousness and  honour... On the third day the Duke had me taken twelve miles towards  town with his own horses. The Prince of Wales asked for my portrait.  For two days we made music for four hours each evening, i.e., from ten  o'clock till two hours after midnight. Then we had supper, and at three  o'clock went to bed.\" After this he proceeded to Cambridge to see the  university, thence to Sir. Patrick Blake's at Langham. Of the Cambridge  visit he writes: \"Each university has behind it a very roomy and  beautiful garden, besides stone bridges, in order to afford passage  over the stream which winds past. The King's Chapel is famous for its  carving. It is all of stone, but so delicate that nothing more beautiful  could have been made of wood. It has already stood for 400 years, and  everybody judges its age at about ten years, because of the firmness and  peculiar whiteness of the stone. The students bear themselves like those  at Oxford, but it is said they have better instructors. There are in all  800 students.\"    From Langham he went to the house of a Mr Shaw, to find in his hostess  the \"most beautiful woman I ever saw.\" Haydn, it may be remarked in  passing, was always meeting the \"most beautiful woman.\" At one time she  was a Mrs Hodges, another of his London admirers. When quite an old man  he still preserved a ribbon which Mrs Shaw had worn during his visit,  and on which his name was embroidered in gold.    Pleyel in Opposition    But other matters now engaged his attention. The directors of the  Professional Concerts, desiring to take advantage of his popularity,  endeavoured to make him cancel his engagements with Salomon and Gallini.  In this they failed. \"I will not,\" said Haydn, \"break my word to Gallini  and Salomon, nor shall any desire for dirty gain induce me to do them an  injury. They have run so great a risk and gone to so much expense on  my account that it is only fair they should be the gainers by it.\"  Thus defeated in their object, the Professionals decided to bring over  Haydn's own pupil, Ignaz Pleyel, to beat the German on his own ground.  It was not easy to upset Haydn's equanimity in an affair of this kind;  his gentle nature, coupled with past experiences, enabled him to take it  all very calmly. \"From my youth upwards,\" he wrote, \"I have been exposed  to envy, so it does not surprise me when any attempt is made wholly to  crush my poor talents, but the Almighty above is my support.... There  is no doubt that I find many who are envious of me in London also, and  I know them almost all. Most of them are Italians. But they can do me no  harm, for my credit with this nation has been established far too many  years.\" As a rule, he was forbearing enough with his rivals. At first  he wrote of Pleyel: \"He behaves himself with great modesty.\" Later on  he remarked that \"Pleyel's presumption is everywhere criticized.\"  Nevertheless, \"I go to all his concerts, for I love him.\" It is very  pleasant to read all this. But how far Haydn's feelings towards Pleyel  were influenced by patriotic considerations it is impossible to say.    The defeated Professionals had a certain advantage by being first in  the field in 1792. But Haydn was only a few days behind them with his  opening concert, and the success of the entire series was in no way  affected by the ridiculous rivalry. Symphonies, divertimenti for  concerted instruments, string quartets, a clavier trio, airs, a cantata,  and other works were all produced at these concerts, and with almost  invariable applause. Nor were Haydn's services entirely confined to  the Salomon concerts. He conducted for various artists, including  Barthelemon, the violinist; Haesler, the pianist; and Madam Mara, of  whom he tells that she was hissed at Oxford for not rising during the  \"Hallelujah\" Chorus.    Close of the Season    The last concert was given on June 6 \"by desire,\" when Haydn's  compositions were received with \"an extasy of admiration.\" Thus  Salomon's season ended, as the Morning Chronicle put it, with the  greatest eclat. Haydn's subsequent movements need not detain us long.  He made excursions to Windsor Castle and to Ascot \"to see the races,\" of  which he has given an account in his note-book.    Herschel and Haydn    From Ascot he went to Slough, where he was introduced to Herschel. In  this case there was something like real community of tastes, for the  astronomer was musical, having once played the oboe, and later on acted  as organist, first at Halifax Parish Church, and then at the Octagon  Chapel Bath. The big telescope with which he discovered the planet  Uranus in 1781 was an object of great interest to Haydn, who was  evidently amazed at the idea of a man sitting out of doors \"in the most  intense cold for five or six hours at a time.\"    Visits were also paid to Vauxhall Gardens, where \"the music is  fairly good\" and \"coffee and milk cost nothing.\" \"The place and its  diversions,\" adds Haydn, \"have no equal in the world.\"    At St Paul's    But the most interesting event of this time to Haydn was the meeting of  the Charity Children in St Paul's Cathedral, when something like 4000  juveniles took part. \"I was more touched,\" he says in his diary, \"by  this innocent and reverent music than by any I ever heard in my life!\"  And then he notes the following chant by John Jones: [Jones was organist  of St Paul's Cathedral at this time. His chant, which was really in the  key of D, has since been supplanted. Haydn made an error in bar 12.]    [Figure: a musical score excerpt]    Curiously enough Berlioz was impressed exactly in the same way when he  heard the Charity Children in 1851. He was in London as a juror at the  Great Exhibition; and along with his friend, the late G. A. Osborne, he  donned a surplice and sang bass in the select choir. He was so moved by  the children's singing that he hid his face behind his music and wept.  \"It was,\" he says, \"the realization of one part of my dreams, and a  proof that the powerful effect of musical masses is still absolutely  unknown.\" [See Berlioz's Life and"]]]
