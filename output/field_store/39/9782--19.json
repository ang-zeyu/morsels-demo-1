(59.8 mm.). The only noticeable differences in  proportions between males and females is in the tympanum/eye ratio; for  example, this ratio is 0.47 to 0.53 (0.49) and 0.54 to 0.68 (0.61) in  ten males and eight females, respectively, from the Meseta Central.    The shape of the snout and the associated cranial elements of _S.  sordida_ vary geographically and ontogenetically. Specimens from the  Caribbean lowlands have blunt snouts in lateral view; those from the  Pacific lowlands have longer, more slender snouts that are pointed in  lateral view, and those from the Meseta Central are intermediate in  snout shape between the two lowland populations (Fig. 4). These  differences in shape of the snout are dependent on the nature of the  underlying cranial bones, principally the maxillaries and nasals. In  specimens from the Caribbean lowlands the nasals are long, wide, and  narrowly separated from the ethmoid; the anterior edge is just posterior  to the nostril. The maxillary flanges are nearly vertical. In specimens  from the Pacific lowlands the nasals are relatively shorter, narrower,  and rather widely separated from the ethmoid; the anterior edges of the  nasals do not extend so far forward as in specimens from the Caribbean  lowlands. The maxillary flanges slant medially. In these cranial  characters, specimens from the Meseta Central are intermediate between  the two lowland populations.    Superimposed on this geographic variation are ontogenetic changes, which  are most noticeable in males. In smaller, and presumably younger,  specimens the snouts are more pointed than in larger specimens;  consequently some small males from the Caribbean lowlands resemble  larger males from the Pacific lowlands, since the nasals and maxillaries  of the former are not fully ossified. In addition, in small breeding  males the ethmoid is only about one-half ossified, a large  frontoparietal foramen is present, the anterior arm of the squamosal  extends only about one-fourth the distance to the maxillary (two-thirds  the distance in larger specimens), and the tegmen tympani are short, as  compared with the long, thin elements in larger specimens.

(USC 7183). x3.]    The dorsal ground-color of _Smilisca sordida_ is gray to pale tan or  reddish brown; the venter is white. The dorsum is variously marked with  dark gray, dark brown, reddish brown, or olive-green spots or blotches  (Pl. 7C). A dark interorbital bar usually is present. The dorsal  markings on the body usually consist of a blotch, or two or more spots,  on the occiput, in the scapular region, and in the sacral region. In  many specimens, especially females, these markings are in the form of  broad transverse bars. A female (USC 7164) from Las Canas, Guanacaste,  Costa Rica, has a tan dorsum with many black flecks and round brown  spots bordered by darker brown. One female (KU 91763) from the Rio  Jorco, San Jose, Costa Rica, has a unicolor tan dorsum. Some individuals  have scattered, small white spots on the dorsum; these are most evident  in a male (USC 7153) from La Fortuna, Alajuela. White labial stripes and  anal stripes are absent in all specimens.    The limbs are marked by dark brown transverse bars; these are indistinct  in some specimens from the Meseta Central and Caribbean lowlands,  whereas they are distinct in all specimens from the Pacific lowlands.  Specimens from the Caribbean lowlands have two to six bars on each  shank, whereas specimens from the Pacific slopes have four to six bars  on each shank, and specimens from the Meseta Central have as many as  eight bars on each shank. A narrow, sometimes broken white line is  present on the ventrolateral edge of the forearm. The webbing on the  hand is tan or pale gray, and the ventral surfaces of the tarsi and the  webbing on the feet are dark gray or brown. Breeding males have dark  brown nuptial excrescences on the prepollex.    The flanks and posterior surfaces of the thighs usually are marked by  bluish white and creamy tan flecks, respectively, but vary considerably.  In specimens from the Caribbean lowlands a small amount of flecking is  present in the inguinal region, and on the posterior surfaces of the  thighs flecks are few or absent. In specimens from the Meseta Central,  numerous large flecks or small, round spots (pale bluish white in life)  are on the posterior half of the flanks; small flecks are on the  posterior surfaces of the thighs. Specimens from the Pacific slopes and  lowlands of southern Costa Rica (Puntarenas and San Jose Provinces) have  bold mottling of black and bluish white on the flanks and many bluish  white flecks on the posterior surfaces of the thighs. The flanks are  reticulated from the axilla to the groin in two females (UMMZ 123684 and  USC 7236) from Rincon, Peninsula de Osa. In specimens from the Pacific  slopes of Guanacaste in northwestern Costa Rica, flecks are present in  the inguinal region; indistinct flecks are on the posterior surfaces of  the thighs.    The throat is immaculate in specimens from the Caribbean lowlands in  Limon Province; the throats are dusky laterally in most other specimens  except some from the Meseta Central, in which the throats are heavily  flecked with black. This variation occurs in males and females.    The color and pattern in life are highly variable. A composite  description of living individuals (now KU 91718-41) from 6 kilometers  east of Golfito, Puntarenas, Costa Rica, illustrates the variability:  \"Dorsum pale olive-green, fading to tan posteriorly, or tan all over  with dark olive-green or dark brown spots on back and bars on limbs.  Flanks dark brown with cream, greenish gray, or bluish gray mottling.  Posterior surfaces of thighs dark brown with pale blue, pale green, or  tan flecks. Iris creamy silver. Throats white with some brown flecks  peripherally.\" (Duellman, Field notes, February 15, 1965.) A male from  the Rio Jorco, San Jose, Costa Rica, was dull olive-tan above with  olive-green marks; the flanks were brown with pale tan flecks, and the  posterior surfaces of the thighs were pale brown with cream-colored  flecks. Six females from the same locality were reddish brown above with  olive-brown or dark brown markings; one was uniform orange-tan, and  another was dull olive-green with darker markings.    The color of the iris in living frogs varies from creamy silver to  grayish yellow or bronze with a variable amount of black reticulation.    _Natural History._--_Smilisca sordida_ is not associated with any one  type of vegetation; instead it lives in the vicinity of rocky streams  having low gradients. Breeding takes place primarily in the dry season,  when the water in the streams is clear and at a low level. Through most  of the range of _S. sordida_ showers, or even short heavy rains, occur  in the dry season. After such rains the breeding activity is maximal.  Breeding congregations have been found from December through April, but  a few calling males and gravid females have been taken in June, July,  and August. In the rainy season non-breeding individuals are found  sitting on bushes near streams at night. Taylor (1952:843) found  specimens in bromeliads by day.    Males usually call from rocks or gravel bars in, or at the edge of,  streams. Some individuals perch in low bushes overhanging the streams,  and some sit in shallows in the streams. Clasping pairs have been found  on the banks of streams and in shallow water in streams.    The breeding call consists of one to six moderately short, rather  high-pitched notes (duration 0.18 to 0.45 seconds) repeated at intervals  of 12 seconds to several minutes. Each note is a vibrant rattle having  78 to 135 pulses per second and major frequences of about 1200 to 2600  cycles per second (Pl. 11C).    The tadpoles live in shallow parts of the streams, where they cling to  the surfaces of small rocks and hide beneath leaves and rocks. A  complete developmental series of tadpoles is not available; measurements  of those stages examined are summarized in Table 12.    A typical tadpole in stage 36 of development (KU 68475 from 15 km. WSW  of San Isidro el General, Costa Rica) has a body length of 11.7 mm.,  tail length of 22.8 mm., and a total length of 34.5 mm.; body about  three-fourths as deep as wide; snout broadly rounded in dorsal view,  sloping and rounded in lateral view; eyes widely separated, directed  dorsolaterally; nostril slightly closer to eye than to tip of snout;  mouth ventral; spiracle sinistral, about two-thirds distance from snout  to posterior end of body and slightly below midline; anal tube dextral;  caudal musculature heavy, straight; dorsal fin not extending onto body;  fins deepest at about mid-length of tail; there depth of caudal  musculature equal to depth of dorsal fin and half again as deep as  ventral fin; musculature extending nearly to tip of tail; body reddish  brown above and pale grayish brown with white flecks below; caudal  musculature pale tan with brown flecks; a series of reddish brown dashes  at base of caudal fin separated from others in series and from dashes on  other side by creamy white; fins transparent with reddish brown flecks  on posterior one-half of ventral fin and on all of dorsal fin (Fig.  14C).

The early history of Manipur is lost in obscurity, but there can be  no doubt that it has existed as an independent kingdom from a very  early period. In the days when the Indian branch of the Aryan race  was still in its progressive and colonising stage, this district  was repeatedly passed over by one wave after another of invaders,  intent on penetrating into the remotest parts of Burmah. We have no  means of ascertaining what government it had before the year 700 A.D.,  but it is believed that a monarchy prevailed at that era. About the  year 1250 A.D., a large Chinese force invaded the country, and was  signally defeated; all who were not killed being made prisoners. These  taught the Manipuris silk culture, and a number of them were settled  at Susa Rameng in the valley, where they have still descendants. The  Chinese also taught the art of brick-making, and erected two solid  blocks of masonry in the palace, between which the road to the Lion  Gate passed. These blocks were levelled with the ground by the Burmese  invaders, but rebuilt on the old foundations by Ghumbeer Singh.    Manipur in old days possessed a famous breed of ponies, larger and  better bred than the so-called Burmese ponies that come from the Shan  states. On these ponies were mounted the formidable cavalry that  in the last century made Manipur feared throughout Upper Burmah,  and enabled her rulers on more than one occasion, to carry their  victorious arms within sight of Ava, where their Rajah Pamheiba erected  a stone pillar to commemorate the event. The cavalry used the regular  Manipuri saddle protecting the legs, and were armed with spears and  two quivers of darts. These darts in a retreat were grasped by a loop  and swung round in a peculiar way, when the shaft formed of peacock  feathers with an iron head suddenly became detached, and flying with  great force inflicted a fatal wound wherever it struck. A skilful  man could throw them with great precision.    The territories of Manipur varied according to the mettle of its  rulers. Sometimes they held a considerable territory east of the  Chindwin river in subjection, at other times only the Kubo valley,  a strip of territory, inhabited, not by Burmese, but by Shans, and  lying between Manipur proper and the Chindwin. Again they were driven  back into Manipur proper. For the greater part of the last century,  the Kubo valley unquestionably belonged to Manipur, and it was never  in any sense a Burmese province, being, when not under Manipur,  a feudatory of the great Shan kingdom of Pong.    In the middle of the last century one of those extraordinary men who  appear from time to time in the East, destined to shine like a blazing  meteor, imparting exceeding brilliancy to their country, and then as  suddenly vanishing, so that it returns to its original obscurity,  appeared in Burmah. His name, Along Pra, has been corrupted by us  into Alompra, by which he is always known. He speedily raised Burmah  to a commanding position. The kingdom of Pong was overthrown and  its territories mostly annexed, Pegu was conquered, our district of  Chittagong threatened, and Siam forced to relinquish several coveted  possessions. The war fever did not die with Alompra, and in 1817 and  1819 Assam and Manipur were respectively invaded, internal dissensions  having bred traitors, who, in both countries, made the path of the  invaders easy. But the master spirit was gone, and when we appeared  upon the scene, they could make no efficient stand. Had we then marched  to Ava, the Burmese Empire would have collapsed like a house of cards,  and the events of 1885 been anticipated by sixty years. As it was, we  did not realise our strength and the Burmese weakness, and contented  ourselves with annexing Assam and Cachar and protecting Manipur.    It is not very evident what the religion of Manipur was in early days,  but we see no trace of Buddhism. Probably, whatever the belief in  early years when the people may have been affected by the intermittent  stream of Aryans passing through, for many centuries no religious rites  were used before the recent rise of Hindooism, further than to appease  evil spirits, as is the custom of the surrounding tribes. There can be  little doubt that some time or other the Naga tribes to the north made  one of their chiefs Rajah of Manipur, and that his family, while, like  the Manchus in China and other conquerors, adopting the civilisation  of the country, retained some of their old customs. This is shown in  the curious practice at the installation of a Rajah, when he and the  Ranee appear in Naga costume; also that he always has in his palace  a house built like a Naga's, and wherever he goes he is attended by  two or three Manipuris with Naga arms and accoutrements. I once told  a Manipuri what I thought on the subject, and he was greatly struck  by it, and admitted the force of what I said.    Towards the middle of the last century, for some reason or other,  a great Hindoo revival took place in the East of India. Assam was  once Hindoo but had long become Buddhist under its Ahom kings,  and now became converted to Hindooism, by Brahmins from Bengal. All  difficulties were smoothed over, and converts were made by tens of  thousands. It is to be regretted that it was so, as these \"converts\"  quickly deteriorated. The easy conquest of Hindooised Assam by the  Burmese, when Buddhist Assam had successfully resisted a powerful army  sent by Arungzebe from India and composed largely of recruits from  Central Asia, seems proof of it, if all other evidence were wanting.    The process of conversion in Manipur began a generation later than in  Assam, and proceeded on somewhat different lines, but it was not less  effective, and was still going on at a late date. It had not the same  deteriorating effect, for the Rajahs assumed to themselves a position  greater than that of High Pontiff, and could at any time by their  simple fiat have changed the religion of the country and degraded  all the Brahmins, in fact all admissions to the Hindoo pale from the  outer world of unorthodoxy were made by the Rajah himself. Sometimes  the inhabitants of a village were elevated en masse from the level  of outcasts, to that of Hindoos of pure caste, but more often single  individuals were \"converted.\" A man belonging to a hill-tribe, for  instance, could, if the Rajah chose, at any time receive the sacred  thread of the twice-born castes, and on payment of a small sum of money  be admitted as a Hindoo and was thenceforth called a Khetree. [16]  This privilege was not accorded to Mussulmans. I once asked a Manipuri  why they received hill-men and not Mussulmans, both being Mlechas, [17]  according to Hindoo theory. He said it was because the hill people had  sinned in ignorance, whereas Mussulmans knew the evil of their ways.    Of course, every one who knows anything of Hindooism is aware that  theoretically a man must be born a Hindoo, and that proselytism  is not admitted. Practically, however, this rule is ignored on the  eastern frontier, and all along it from Sudya down to Chittagong,  where conversions are daily taking place. I remember villages in  Assam where caste was unknown thirty-five years ago, but where now the  people live in the odour of sanctity as highly orthodox and bigoted  Hindoos. Strange to say, the pure Hindoos of the North-West Provinces  acknowledge the pretensions of these spurious converts sufficiently so  as to allow of their drinking water brought by them. It is probably  easier to take the people at their own valuation than to carry water  one's self from a distance when tired. By the religious law of the  Hindoos, it is forbidden to eat or drink anything touched by one of  another tribe.    Our first relations with Manipur date from 1762, when Governor  Verelst of the Bengal Presidency--with that splendid self-reliance and  large-mindedness characteristic of the makers of the British Indian  Empire, men who acted instead of talking, and were always ready to  extend our responsibilities when advisable--entered into a treaty with  the Rajah of Manipur. As this treaty came to nothing, practically our  connection with the little state really dates from 1823. It had been  invaded by the Burmese in 1819, and its people driven out or carried  off into slavery in Burmah. The royal family were fugitives.    At that time Sylhet was our frontier station, and our relations with  the Burmese, who were at the highest pitch of their power, were  daily becoming more strained. On our side of the frontier we were  ably represented by Mr. David Scott, agent to the Governor-General,  and preparations were being made for the inevitable struggle. One  day a young Manipuri prince waited on Mr. Scott and asked leave  to raise a Manipuri force to fight on our side. He was short and  slight, and of indomitable courage and energy, and the agent to  the Governor-General recognising his ability, allowed him to raise  500 men. These were soon increased to 2000, cavalry, infantry and  artillery. Two English officers, Captain F. Grant and Lieutenant  R. B. Pemberton, were attached to the force, thenceforth called the  Manipur Levy, to drill and discipline it.    In 1825 a general advance was made all along our line, Cachar was  invaded and subdued, and we essayed to pursue the enemy into Manipur  and thence into Burmah, but our transport arrangements failed. Hitherto  we had been accustomed to wars in the arid plains of India, and our  military authorities did not realise the necessities of an expedition  into the eastern jungles. Hence, camels and bullocks were sent to  dislocate their limbs in the tenacious mud and swamps of Cachar,  and when the advance into Manipur was desired, our regular troops  were powerless. At this crisis the Manipur Levy showed its immense  value. The men could move lightly equipped without the paraphernalia  of a regular army,"]]]
