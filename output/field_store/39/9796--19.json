This is also  directed downwards and forwards, and is shorter. It corresponds to the  region which, situated between the pastern and the hoof, is known as the  _cornet_.    The third phalanx, situated entirely within the hoof, has the same  direction as the first and second. It is large and broad, and presents  three surfaces separated by well-marked angular borders (see Fig. 96).  The anterior surface is oblique downwards and forwards; it is convex  transversely. The inferior surface is slightly hollowed, and is in  relation with the sole, or plantar surface of the hoof.    The superior surface, which is articular, is divided by a median ridge  into two lateral cavities, which correspond to the trochlea on the  inferior surface of the lower extremity of the second phalanx. The  inferior border corresponds in shape with the hoof. The superior border  presents in its median part a projection, _the pyramidal eminence_,  which prolongs at this level the anterior surface of the bone. Finally,  the posterior border, which is concave, is in contact with a sesamoid  bone, _the lesser sesamoid_, which increases the superior articular  surface behind, and is also in contact with the second phalanx.    As we have just seen, the horse possesses but one digit. In the  ancestors of the animal--that is, in the prehistoric species which  are now extinct (_orohippus_, _miohippus_, _protohippus_, or  _hipparion_)--the number of digits was larger; this fact conclusively  proves that the rudimentary metacarpals of the existing horse are  vestiges of digits which have disappeared through want of use. In the  first of those ancestors--orohippus--there were four digits; all save  the first, the thumb, being then developed. In the others of the series  there existed but three digits. It must, however, be noted that in those  animals it is always the digit which corresponds to the middle finger of  the pentedactyl hand that is longest. In other less ancient species the  lateral fingers are reduced to the condition of mere splints of bone. It  follows from what has been said that the digit which persists in the  equine species should be considered as the third finger, and that the  rudimentary metacarpals represent lateral digits considerably  atrophied.    This disappearance of the lateral digits cannot excite surprise when we  consider the functions of the organs. Becoming useless, they must  undergo gradual atrophy from want of use.    There undoubtedly is, in this former existence of supplementary digits  in the horse, something analogous to what we still find in the pig;  where the two principal digits are accompanied by two shorter ones,  which very probably, from their infrequent use, are destined to  disappear in a more or less distant future.      Proportions of the Arm, the Forearm, and the Metacarpus    As a supplement to the study of the anterior limbs which we have just  finished, it appears necessary to give some indications of the relative  proportions of certain of the segments which form these limbs in the  plantigrades, the digitigrades, and the ungulates.    First, we would remark that, in following this order of classification,  the scapula becomes less and less narrow, and assumes a form more and  more elongated. In order to convince ourselves of this, it will be  sufficient to study the bone first in man, then in the bear, the cat,  dog, ox, and finally in the horse.    As to the proportions of length, which are those we should chiefly  study, we shall commence with the comparison of the forearm and  arm--that is to say, the radius and the humerus. The radius is found to  be longer in proportion to the humerus, as the number of digits is  smaller, and the hand loses more and more the functions of an organ of  prehension. In man, the radius is shorter than the humerus; in the  horse, on the contrary, it is longer.    To give an idea of this proportion, we shall employ what is known as the  antibrachial index. This index gives the relation which exists between  the length of the forearm and that of the humerus; the length of this  latter, whatever may be the actual measurement, is represented by a  fixed figure, the number 100. A very simple arithmetical operation  gives the proportion--      forearm x 100    -------------, the quotient obtained furnishes the index.       humerus    The index is less than 100 if the forearm is shorter than the bone of  the arm. The index is more than 100 if, on the contrary, the forearm is  longer.    In man, the radius is shorter than the humerus; indeed, in adult  individuals of the white race the average index is 74.    In the bear, the length of the radius approaches closely to that of the  humerus; the index is about 90. In the skeleton of a bear in the  anatomical museum of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, the humerus is 33  centimetres in length, and the radius 30 centimetres.    In the cat, the radius is very little shorter than the humerus. In the  dog they are equal. The antibrachial index of the latter is,  accordingly, 100.    In the horse, the radius is longer than the humerus; the index is  therefore above 100. Thus, in the skeleton of the horse which we have in  the museum of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, the index is 113--length of  humerus, 29 centimetres; length of radius, 33 centimetres. In other  skeletons which we have measured we found: in one, 108--humerus, 34  centimetres; radius, 37 centimetres; in another, 116--humerus, 25  centimetres; radius, 29 centimetres.    The metacarpal bone undergoes, relatively to the humerus, a proportional  elongation, analogous to that of the forearm.    In man, the length of the metacarpus is contained about 5-1/2 times in  that of the humerus; in the bear, it is contained 4 times; in the dog,  2-1/2 times; in the horse, 1-1/3 times only.    It is well known that the proportions vary according to race, and that  what we have here given are but the general indications.      The Articulations of the Anterior Limbs    The knowledge of human arthrology which we presume the reader to have  previously acquired makes it unnecessary for us to enter into numerous  details regarding the configuration of the articular osseous surfaces  and the disposition of the fibrous bands that retain them in position.  Accordingly, in the description which follows, and also in that of the  articulations of the posterior limbs, we shall occupy ourselves but very  briefly with the details above referred to, so as to devote ourselves  especially to the indication of the movements--that is to say, of that  which, while easily comprehended on recollection of former studies,  presents the greatest interest from the artistic standpoint in these  studies in comparative anatomy.    =The Scapulo-Humeral Articulation.=--The head of the humerus and the  glenoid cavity of the scapula being in contact, the two bones are bound  together by a rather loose articular capsule, which is strengthened by  the muscles of this region which fulfil the function of active  ligaments.    This articulation, so movable in every direction in the human species,  is not so much so in quadrupeds; the arm in the latter, as also the  shoulder, being kept in contact with the lateral region of the thorax by  the numerous muscles which surround it.    Of the movements performed by the humerus, flexion and extension are the  most extensive; those of abduction and adduction are much less so.    It is necessary, before proceeding further, to determine what the two  principal movements which we have just mentioned really are, viz.,  flexion and extension.    We know that in man the displacements of the humerus which take place in  the antero-posterior direction are known as movement or projection  forwards, and movement or projection backwards, respectively. We do not  say that the humerus is flexed or extended, because, in reality, on  account of the position which the skeleton of the shoulder occupies, it  is not able to flex or place itself on the line of prolongation of the  scapula with which it articulates.    In quadrupeds it is not so. The humerus and the scapula are contained in  almost the same vertical plane; and the bone of the arm can take, in  relation to the latter, the positions characteristic of flexion and  extension--that is, of approach to the scapula and removal from it.    What makes the meanings of these terms a little confusing is that, in  human anatomy, some authors consider the backward movement of the  humerus as extension, and the forward movement as flexion; in order to  be able to compare these movements to those that the femur executes in  relation to the pelvis.    Now, in our opinion, the indication of this correspondence is not  absolutely necessary; since it ceases to be exact if we wished, from the  point of view of the direction given to other segments of the skeleton,  to establish the same relation between the elbow and the articulation of  the knee.    It is therefore indispensable, when discussing quadrupeds, to  discontinue these terms, in order the more readily to recognise that: in  flexion the inferior extremity of the humerus is directed backwards; in  extension, on the contrary, it is directed forwards. In the first case  the humerus approaches the scapula; in the second, on the contrary, it  moves away from it.    These movements, which take place during walking, are executed in the  following manner: When one of the anterior limbs is at the end of that  stage of progression which is called support (see p. 289, Displacements  of the Limbs)--that is to say, during the time that the foot remains in  contact with the ground, whilst the trunk is moving forward--the  direction of this limb becomes more and more oblique downwards and  backwards. At a certain moment the limb is raised from the ground,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3833"],[0,"Australian Legendary Tales: folk-lore of the Noongahburrahs as told to the (#16)"],[1,"in their sombre hues, waving with a sad wailing their  branches towards the lake which covers now the place where the borah  was held. And it bears the name of Googoorewon, the place of trees, and  round the edge of it is still to be seen the remains of the borah ring  of earth. And it is known as a great place of meeting for the birds  that bear the names of the tribes of old. The Byahmuls sail proudly  about; the pelicans, their water rivals in point of size and beauty;  the ducks, and many others too numerous to mention. The Ooboon, or  blue-tongued lizards, glide in and out through the grass. Now and then  is heard the \"Oom, oom, oom,\" of the dummerh, and occasionally a cry  from the bird Millindooloonubbah of \"Googoolguyyah, googoolguyyah.\" And  in answer comes the wailing of the gloomy-looking balah trees, and then  a rustling shirr through the bibbil branches, until at last every tree  gives forth its voice and makes sad the margin of the lake with echoes  of the past.    But the men and boys who were at the place of the little borah escaped  the metamorphosis. They waited long for the arrival of the tribes who  never came.    At last Byamee said: \"Surely mighty enemies have slain our friends, and  not one escapes to tell us of their fate. Even now these enemies may be  upon our track; let us go into a far country.\"    And swiftly they went to Noondoo. Hurrying along with them, a dog of  Byamee's, which would fain have lain by the roadside rather than have  travelled so swiftly, but Byamee would not leave her and hurried her  on. When they reached the springs of Noondoo, the dog sneaked away into  a thick scrub, and there were born her litter of pups. But such pups as  surely man never looked at before. The bodies of dogs, and the heads of  pigs, and the fierceness and strength of devils. And gone is the life  of a man who meets in a scrub of Noondoo an earmoonan, for surely will  it slay him. Not even did Byamee ever dare to go near the breed of his  old dog. And Byamee, the mighty Wirreenun, lives for ever. But no man  must look upon his face, lest surely will he die. So alone in a thick  scrub, on one of the Noondoo ridges, lives this old man, Byamee, the  mightiest of Wirreenun.          27.  BUNNYYARL THE FLIES AND WURRUNNUNNAH THE BEES      The Bunnyyarl and Wurrunnunnah were relations, and lived in one camp.  The Wurrunnunnah were very hardworking, always trying to gather food in  a time of plenty, to lay in a store for a time of famine. The Bunnyyarl  used to give no heed to the future, but used to waste their time  playing round any rubbish, and never thinking even of laying up any  provisions. One day the Wurrunnunnah said, \"Come out with us and gather  honey from flowers. Soon will the winter winds blow the flowers away,  and there will be no more honey to gather.\"    \"No,\" said the Bunnyyarl, \"we have something to look to here.\" And  off they went, turning over some rubbish and wasting their time,  knowing whatever the Wurrunnunnah brought they would share with them.  The Wurrunnunnah went alone and left the Bunnyyarl to their rubbish.  The Wurrunnunnah gathered the flowers and stored the honey, and never  more went back to live with the Bunnyyarls, for they were tired of  doing all the work.    As time went on the Wurrunnunnah were changed into little wild bees,  and the lazy Bunnyyarls were changed into flies.          28.  DEEGEENBOYAH THE SOLDIER-BIRD      Deegeenboyah was an old man, and getting past hunting much for himself;  and he found it hard to keep his two wives and his two daughters  supplied with food. He camped with his family away from the other  tribes, but he used to join the men of the Mullyan tribe when they were  going out hunting, and so get a more certain supply of food than if he  had gone by himself. One day when the Mullyan went out, he was too late  to accompany them. He hid in the scrub and waited for their return, at  some little distance from their camp. When they were coming back he  heard them singing the Song of the Setting Emu, a song which whoever  finds the first emu's nest of the season always sings before getting  back to the camp. Deegeenboyah jumped up as he heard the song, and  started towards the camp of the Mullyan singing the same song, as if he  too had found a nest. On they all went towards the camp sing joyously:      Nurdoo, nurbber me derreen derreenbah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.    Garmbay booan yunnahdeh beahwah ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.    Gubbondee, dee, ee, ee, ee.    Neah nein gulbeejah, ah, ah, ah, ah.\"    Which song roughly translated means:      I saw it first amongst the young trees,    The white mark on its forehead,    The white mark that before I had only seen as the emus moved together        in the day-time.    Never did I see one camp before, only moving, moving always.    Now that we have found the nest    We must look out the ants do not get to the eggs.    If they crawl over them the eggs are spoilt.    As the last echo of the song died away, those in the camp took up the  refrain and sang it back to the hunters to let them know that they  understood that they had found the first emu's nest of the season.    When the hunters reached the camp, up came Deegeenboyah too. The  Mullyans turned to him, and said:    \"Did you find an emu's nest too?\"    \"Yes,\" said Deegeenboyah, \"I did. I think you must have found the same,  though after me, as I saw not your tracks. But I am older and stiff in  my limbs, so came not back so quickly. Tell me, where is your nest?\"    \"In the clump of the Goolahbahs, on the edge of the plain,\" said the  unsuspecting Mullyan.    \"Ah, I thought so. That is mine. But what matter? We can share--there  will be plenty for all. We must get the net and go and camp near the  nest to-night, and to-morrow trap the emu.\"    The Mullyan got their emu trapping net, one made of thin rope about as  thick as a thin clothes line, about five feet high, and between two and  three hundred yards long. And off they set, accompanied by  Deegeenboyah, to camp near where the emu was setting. When they had  chosen a place to camp, they had their supper and a little corrobborce,  illustrative of slaying emu, etc. The next morning at daylight they  erected their net into a sort of triangular shaped yard, one side open.  Black fellows were stationed at each end of the net, and at stated  distances along it. The net was upheld by upright poles. When the net  was fixed, some of the blacks made a wide circle round the emu's nest,  leaving open the side towards the net. They closed in gradually until  they frightened the emu off the nest. The emu seeing black fellows on  every side but one, ran in that direction. The blacks followed closely,  and the bird was soon yarded. Madly the frightened bird rushed against  the net. Up ran a black fellow, seized the bird and wrung its neck.  Then some of them went back to the nest to get the eggs, which they  baked in the ashes of their fire and ate. They made a hole to cook the  emu in. They plucked the emu. When they had plenty of coals, they put a  thick layer at the bottom of the hole, some twigs of leaves on top of  the coals, some feathers on the top of them. Then they laid the emu in,  more feathers on the top of it, leaves again on top of them, and over  them a thick layer of coals, and lastly they covered all with earth.    It would be several hours in cooking, so Deegeenboyah said, \"I will  stay and cook the emu, you young fellows take moonoons--emu spears--and  try and get some more emu.\"    The Mullyan thought there was sense in this proposal, so they took a  couple of long spears, with a jagged nick at one end, to hold the emu  when they speared it; they stuck a few emu feathers on the end of each  spear and went off. They soon saw a flock of emu coming past where they  were waiting to water. Two of the party armed with the moonoon climbed  a tree, broke some boughs and put these thickly beneath them, so as to  screen them from the emu. Then as the emu came near to the men they  dangled down their spears, letting the emu feathers on the ends wave to  and fro. The emu, seeing the feathers, were curious as to how they got  there, came over, craning their necks and sniffing right underneath the  spears. The black fellows tightly grasped the moonoons and drove them  with force into the two emu they had picked One emu dropped dead at  once. The other ran with the spear in it for a short distance, but the  black fellow was quickly after it, and soon caught and killed it  outright. Then carrying the dead birds, back they went to where  Deegeenboyah was cooking the other emu. They cooked the two they had  brought, and then all started for the camp in great spirits at their  successful chase. They began throwing their mooroolahs as they went  along, and playing with their bubberahs, or returning boomerangs. Old  Deegeenboyah said, \"Here, give me the emus to carry, and then you will  be free to have a really good game with your mooroolahs and bubberahs,  and see who is the best man.\"    They gave him the emus, and on they went, some throwing mooroolahs, and  some showing their skill with bubberahs. Presently Deegeenboyah sat  down. They thought he was just resting for a few minutes, so ran on  laughing and playing, each good throw eliciting another effort, for  none liked owning themselves beaten while they had a mooroolah left. As  they got further away they noticed Deegeenboyah was still sitting  down, so they called out to him to know what was the matter. \"All  right,\" he said, \"only having a rest; shall come on in a minute.\" So on  they went. When they were quite out of sight Deegeenboyah jumped up  quickly, took up the emus and made for an opening in the ground at a  little distance. This opening was the door of the underground home of  the Murgah Muggui spider--the opening was a neat covering, like a sort  of trap door. Down though this he went, taking the emus with him,  knowing there was"]]]
