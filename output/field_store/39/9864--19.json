She returned the smile with her thanks. Evidently Kells had a  well-filled larder, and as Joan had fared on coarse and hard food for  long, this supper was a luxury and exceedingly appetizing. While she was  eating, the blanket curtain moved aside and Kells appeared. He dropped  it behind him, but did not step up into the room. He was in his  shirt-sleeves, had been clean shaven, and looked a different man.    \"How do you like your--home?\" he inquired, with a hint of his former  mockery.    \"I'm grateful for the privacy,\" she replied.    \"You think you could be worse off, then?\"    \"I know it.\"    \"Suppose Gulden kills me--and rules the gang--and takes you?... There's  a story about him, the worst I've heard on this border. I'll tell you  some day when I want to scare you bad.\"    \"Gulden!\" Joan shivered as she pronounced the name. \"Are you and he  enemies?\"    \"No man can have a friend on this border. We flock together like  buzzards. There's safety in numbers, but we fight together, like  buzzards over carrion.\"    \"Kells, you hate this life?\"    \"I've always hated my life, everywhere. The only life I ever loved was  adventure.... I'm willing to try a new one, if you'll go with me.\"    Joan shook her head.    \"Why not? I'll marry you,\" he went on, speaking lower. \"I've got gold;  I'll get more.\"    \"Where did you get the gold?\" she asked    \"I've relieved a good many overburdened travelers and prospectors,\" he  replied.    \"Kells, you're a--a villain!\" exclaimed Joan, unable to contain her  sudden heat. \"You must be utterly mad--to ask me to marry you.\"    \"No, I'm not mad,\" he rejoined, with a laugh. \"Gulden's the mad one.  He's crazy. He's got a twist in his brain. I'm no fool.... I've only  lost my head over you. But compare marrying me, living and traveling  among decent people and comfort, to camps like this. If I don't get  drunk I'll be half decent to you. But I'll get shot sooner or later.  Then you'll be left to Gulden.\"    \"Why do you say HIM?\" she queried, in a shudder of curiosity.    \"Well, Gulden haunts me.\"    \"He does me, too. He makes me lose my sense of proportion. Beside him  you and the others seem good. But you ARE wicked.\"    \"Then you won't marry me and go away somewhere?... Your choice is  strange. Because I tell you the truth.\"    \"Kells! I'm a woman. Something deep in me says you won't keep me  here--you can't be so base. Not now, after I saved your life! It would  be horrible--inhuman. I can't believe any man born of a woman could do  it.\"    \"But I want you--I love you!\" he said, low and hard.    \"Love! That's not love,\" she replied in scorn. \"God only knows what it  is.\"    \"Call it what you like,\" he went on, bitterly. \"You're a young,  beautiful, sweet woman. It's wonderful to be near you. My life has been  hell. I've had nothing. There's only hell to look forward to--and hell  at the end. Why shouldn't I keep you here?\"    \"But, Kells, listen,\" she whispered, earnestly, \"suppose I am young  and beautiful and sweet--as you said. I'm utterly in your power. I'm  compelled to seek your protection from even worse men. You're different  from these others. You're educated. You must have had--a--a good mother.  Now you're bitter, desperate, terrible. You hate life. You seem to think  this charm you see in me will bring you something. Maybe a glimpse of  joy! But how can it? You know better. How can it... unless I--I love  you?\"    Kells stared at her, the evil and hardness of his passion corded in  his face. And the shadows of comprehending thought in his strange eyes  showed the other side of the man. He was still staring at her while he  reached to put aside the curtains; then he dropped his head and went  out.    Joan sat motionless, watching the door where he had disappeared,  listening to the mounting beats of her heart. She had only been frank  and earnest with Kells. But he had taken a meaning from her last  few words that she had not intended to convey. All that was woman in  her--mounting, righting, hating--leaped to the power she sensed in  herself. If she could be deceitful, cunning, shameless in holding out to  Kells a possible return of his love, she could do anything with him. She  knew it. She did not need to marry him or sacrifice herself. Joan was  amazed that the idea remained an instant before her consciousness. But  something had told her this was another kind of life than she had known,  and all that was precious to her hung in the balance. Any falsity  was justifiable, even righteous, under the circumstances. Could she  formulate a plan that this keen bandit would not see through? The  remotest possibility of her even caring for Kells--that was as much as  she dared hint. But that, together with all the charm and seductiveness  she could summon, might be enough. Dared she try it? If she tried and  failed Kells would despise her, and then she was utterly lost. She was  caught between doubt and hope. All that was natural and true in her  shrank from such unwomanly deception; all that had been born of her wild  experience inflamed her to play the game, to match Kells's villainy with  a woman's unfathomable duplicity.    And while Joan was absorbed in thought the sun set, the light failed,  twilight stole into the cabin, and then darkness. All this hour there  had been a continual sound of men's voices in the large cabin, sometimes  low and at other times loud. It was only when Joan distinctly heard the  name Jim Cleve that she was startled out of her absorption, thrilling  and flushing. In her eagerness she nearly fell as she stepped and  gropped through the darkness to the door, and as she drew aside the  blanket her hand shook.    The large room was lighted by a fire and half a dozen lanterns. Through  a faint tinge of blue smoke Joan saw men standing and sitting and  lounging around Kells, who had a seat where the light fell full upon  him. Evidently a lull had intervened in the talk. The dark faces Joan  could see were all turned toward the door expectantly.    \"Bring him in, Bate, and let's look him over,\" said Kells.    Then Bate Wood appeared, elbowing his way in, and he had his hand on the  arm of a tall, lithe fellow. When they got into the light Joan quivered  as if she had been stabbed. That stranger with Wood was Jim Cleve--Jim  Cleve in frame and feature, yet not the same she knew.    \"Cleve, glad to meet you,\" greeted Kells, extending his hand.    \"Thanks. Same to you,\" replied Cleve, and he met the proffered hand. His  voice was cold and colorless, unfamiliar to Joan. Was this man really  Jim Cleve?    The meeting of Kells and Cleve was significant because of Kells's  interest and the silent attention of the men of his clan. It did not  seem to mean anything to the white-faced, tragic-eyed Cleve. Joan gazed  at him with utter amazement. She remembered a heavily built, florid Jim  Cleve, an overgrown boy with a good-natured, lazy smile on his full  face and sleepy eyes. She all but failed to recognize him in the man who  stood there now, lithe and powerful, with muscles bulging in his coarse,  white shirt. Joan's gaze swept over him, up and down, shivering at the  two heavy guns he packed, till it was transfixed on his face. The old,  or the other, Jim Cleve had been homely, with too much flesh on his face  to show force or fire. This man seemed beautiful. But it was a beauty of  tragedy. He was as white as Kells, but smoothly, purely white,  without shadow or sunburn. His lips seemed to have set with a bitter,  indifferent laugh. His eyes looked straight out, piercing, intent,  haunted, and as dark as night. Great blue circles lay under them,  lending still further depth and mystery. It was a sad, reckless face  that wrung Joan's very heartstrings. She had come too late to save his  happiness, but she prayed that it was not too late to save his honor and  his soul.    While she gazed there had been further exchange of speech between Kells  and Cleve, and she had heard, though not distinguished, what was said.  Kells was unmistakably friendly, as were the other men within range of  Joan's sight. Cleve was surrounded; there were jesting and laughter;  and then he was led to the long table where several men were already  gambling.    Joan dropped the curtain, and in the darkness of her cabin she saw that  white, haunting face, and when she covered her eyes she still saw it.  The pain, the reckless violence, the hopeless indifference, the wreck  and ruin in that face had been her doing. Why? How had Jim Cleve wronged  her? He had loved her at her displeasure and had kissed her against her  will. She had furiously upbraided him, and when he had finally turned  upon her, threatening to prove he was no coward, she had scorned him  with a girl's merciless injustice. All her strength and resolve left  her, momentarily, after seeing Jim there. Like a woman, she weakened.  She lay on the bed and writhed. Doubt, hopelessness, despair, again  seized upon her, and some strange, yearning maddening emotion. What had  she sacrificed? His happiness and her own--and both their lives!    The clamor in the other cabin grew so boisterous that suddenly when it  stilled Joan was brought sharply to the significance of it. Again she  drew aside the curtain and peered out.    Gulden, huge, stolid, gloomy, was entering the cabin. The man fell into  the circle and faced Kell with the fire-light dancing in his cavernous  eyes.    \"Hello, Gulden!\" said Kells, coolly. \"What ails you?\"    \"Anybody tell you about Bill Bailey?\" asked Gulden, heavily.    Kells did not show the least concern. \"Tell me what?\"    \"That he died in a cabin, down in the valley?\"    Kells gave a slight start and his eyes narrowed and shot steely glints.  \"No. It's news to me.\"    \"Kells, you left Bailey for dead. But he lived. He was shot through,  but he got there somehow--nobody knows. He was far gone"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45532"],[0,"History of Julius Cæsar, Vol. 2 of 2 (#16)"],[1,"superiority, he wished, nevertheless, to  ascertain what he could expect from his cavalry, which was composed of  Gauls. For this purpose, and to try, at the same time, the courage of  the Belgae, he engaged them every day in cavalry combats in the undulated  plain to the north of the camp. Once certain that his troops did not  yield in valour to those of the enemy, he resolved to draw them into a  general action. In front of the entrenchments was an extensive tract of  ground, advantageous for ranging an army in order of battle. This  commanding position was covered in front and on the left by the marshes  of the Miette. The right only remained unsupported, and the Belgae might  have taken the Romans in flank in the space between the camp and the  stream, or turned them by passing between the camp and the Aisne. To  meet this danger, Caesar made, on each of the two slopes of the hill, a  fosse, perpendicular to the line of battle, about 400 paces (600 metres)  in length, the first reaching from the camp to the Miette, the second  joining it to the Aisne. At the extremity of these fosses he established  redoubts, in which were placed military machines.[248]      [Sidenote: Battle on the Aisne.]    III. Having made these dispositions, and having left in the camp his two  newly-raised legions to serve as a reserve in case of need, Caesar placed  the six others in array of battle, the right resting on the  retrenchments. The enemy also drew out his troops and deployed them in  face of the Romans. The two armies remained in observation, each waiting  till the other passed the marsh of the Miette, as the favourable moment  for attack. Meanwhile, as they remained thus stationary, the cavalry  were fighting on both sides. After a successful charge, Caesar,  perceiving that the enemies persisted in not entering the marshes,  withdrew his legions. The Belgae immediately left their position to move  towards the Aisne, below the point where the Miette entered it. Their  object was to cross the river between Gernicourt and Pontavert, where  there were fords, with part of their troops, to carry, if they could,  the redoubt commanded by the lieutenant Q. Titurius Sabinus, and to cut  the bridge, or, at least, to intercept the convoys of provisions, and  ravage the country of the Remi, to the south of the Aisne, whence the  Romans drew their supplies.    The barbarians were already approaching the river, when Sabinus  perceived them from the heights of Berry-au-Bac;[249] he immediately  gave information to Caesar, who, with all his cavalry, the light-armed  Numidians, the slingers, and the archers, passed the bridge, and,  descending the left bank, marched to meet the enemies towards the place  threatened. When he arrived there, some of them had already passed the  Aisne. An obstinate struggle takes place. Surprised in their passage,  the Belgae, after having experienced considerable loss, advance  intrepidly over the corpses to cross the river, but are repulsed by a  shower of missiles; those who had reached the left bank are surrounded  by the cavalry and massacred.[250]      [Sidenote: Retreat of the Belgae.]    IV. The Belgae having failed in taking the _oppidum_ of Bibrax, in  drawing the Romans upon disadvantageous ground, in crossing the river,  and suffering, also, from want of provisions, decided on returning home,  to be ready to assemble again to succour the country which might be  first invaded by the Roman army. The principal cause of this decision  was the news of the threatened invasion of the country of the Bellovaci  by Divitiacus and the AEdui: the Bellovaci refused to lose a single  instant in hurrying to the defence of their hearths. Towards ten o'clock  in the evening, the Belgae withdrew in such disorder that their departure  resembled a flight. Caesar was informed immediately by his spies, but,  fearing that this retreat might conceal a snare, he retained his  legions, and even his cavalry, in the camp. At break of day, better  informed by his scouts, he sent all his cavalry, under the orders of the  lieutenants Q. Pedius and L. Aurunculeius Cotta,[251] and ordered  Labienus, with three legions, to follow them. These troops fell upon the  fugitives, and slew as many as the length of the day would permit. At  sunset they gave up the pursuit, and, in obedience to the orders they  had received, returned to the camp.[252]    The coalition of the Belgae, so renowned for their valour, was thus  dissolved. Nevertheless, it was of importance to the Roman general, in  order to secure the pacification of the country, to go and reduce to  subjection in their homes the peoples who had dared to enter into league  against him. The nearest were the Suessiones, whose territory bordered  upon that of the Remi.      [Sidenote: Capture of Noviodunum and Bratuspantium.]    V. The day after the flight of the enemy, before they had recovered from  their fright, Caesar broke up his camp, crossed the Aisne, descended its  left bank, invaded the country of the Suessiones, arrived after a long  day's march (45 kilometres) before Noviodunum (_Soissons_) (_see Plate  7_), and, informed that this town had a weak garrison, he attempted the  same day to carry it by assault; he failed, through the breadth of the  fosses and the height of the walls. He then retrenched his camp, ordered  covered galleries to be advanced (_vineas agere_),[253] and all things  necessary for a siege to be collected. Nevertheless, the crowd of  fugitive Suessiones threw themselves into the town during the following  night. The galleries having been pushed rapidly towards the walls, the  foundations of a terrace[254] to pass the fosse (_aggere jacto_) were  established, and towers were constructed. The Gauls, astonished at the  greatness and novelty of these works, so promptly executed, offered to  surrender. They obtained safety of life at the prayer of the Remi.    Caesar received as hostages the principal chiefs of the country, and even  the two sons of King Galba, exacted the surrender of all their arms, and  accepted the submission of the Suessiones. He then conducted his army  into the country of the Bellovaci, who had shut themselves up, with all  they possessed, in the _oppidum_ of Bratuspantium (_Breteuil_).[255] The  army was only at about five miles' distance from it, when all the aged  men, issuing from the town, came, with extended hands, to implore the  generosity of the Roman general; when he had arrived under the walls of  the place, and while he was establishing his camp, he saw the women and  children also demanding peace as suppliants from the top of the walls.    Divitiacus, in the name of the AEdui, interceded in their favour. After  the retreat of the Belgae and the disbanding of his troops, he had  returned to the presence of Caesar. The latter, who had, at the prayer  of the Remi, just shown himself clement towards the Suessiones,  displayed, at the solicitation of the AEdui, the same indulgence towards  the Bellovaci. Thus obeying the same political idea of increasing among  the Belgae the influence of the peoples allied to Rome, he pardoned them;  but, as their nation was the most powerful in Belgic Gaul, he required  from them all their arms and 600 hostages. The Bellovaci declared that  the promoters of the war, seeing the misfortune they had drawn upon  their country, had fled into the isle of Britain.    It is curious to remark the relations which existed at this epoch  between part of Gaul and England. We know, in fact, from the  \"Commentaries,\" that a certain Divitiacus, an AEduan chieftain, the most  powerful in all Gaul, had formerly extended his power into the isle of  Britain, and we have just seen that the chiefs in the last struggle  against the Romans had found a refuge in the British isles.    Caesar next marched from Bratuspantium against the Ambiani, who  surrendered without resistance.[256]      [Sidenote: March against the Nervii.]    VI. The Roman army was now to encounter more formidable adversaries. The  Nervii occupied a vast territory, one extremity of which touched upon  that of the Ambiani. This wild and intrepid people bitterly reproached  the other Belgae for having submitted to foreigners and abjured the  virtues of their fathers. They had resolved not to send deputies, nor to  accept peace on any condition. Foreseeing the approaching invasion of  the Roman army, the Nervii had drawn into alliance with them two  neighbouring peoples, the Atrebates and the Veromandui, whom they had  persuaded to risk with them the fortune of war: the Aduatuci, also, were  already on the way to join the coalition. The women, and all those whose  age rendered them unfit for fighting, had been placed in safety, in a  spot defended by a marsh, and inaccessible to an army, no doubt at  Mons.[257]    After the submission of the Ambiani, Caesar left Amiens to proceed to the  country of the Nervii; and after three days' march on their territory,  he arrived probably at Bavay (_Bagacum_), which is considered to have  been their principal town. There he learnt by prisoners that he was no  more than ten miles (fifteen kilometres) distant from the Sambre, and  that the enemy awaited him posted on the opposite bank of the  river.[258] He thus found himself on the left bank, and the Nervii were  assembled on the right bank.[259] (_See Plate 7._)    In accordance with the informations he had received, Caesar sent out a  reconnoitring party of scouts and centurions, charged with the selection  of a spot favourable for the establishment of a camp. A certain number  of the Belgae, who had recently submitted, and other Gauls, followed him,  and accompanied him in his march. Some of them, as was known  subsequently by the prisoners, having observed during the preceding days  the usual order of march of the army, deserted during the night to the  Nervii, and informed them that behind each of the legions there was a  long column of"]]]
