The economy has slackened in recent years, as      the annual increase in the number of tourists slowed. Nonetheless, the per      capita GDP of $9,900 is one of the highest in the region.

Wotan his fury    Against the Wälsungs has turned.        He told me        That to-day I must fail        The brother in strife;        But with my shield        I guarded him safe,        Daring the God,    Who slew him himself with his spear.        Siegmund fell;        But I fled,        Bearing his bride.        To protect her        And from the stroke        Of his wrath to hide,    I hastened, O my sisters, to you!    THE VALKYRIES [_Full of fear._          O foolish sister,        How mad thy deed!        Woe's me! Woe's me!        Brünnhilde, lost one!

The horse that is swiftest        Which of you lends,    That forth the woman may fly?    SIEGRUNE          Wouldst have us too        Madly rebel?    BRÜNNHILDE          Rossweisse, sister,        Wilt lend me thy racer!    ROSSWEISSE          The fleet one from Wotan        Never yet fled.    BRÜNNHILDE          Helmwige, hear me!

From off the field        Who bade thee thus bear me?        For there perchance        By the selfsame weapon        That struck down Siegmund        I too had died,        Made one with him        In the hour of death.        Far from Siegmund--        Siegmund, from thee!        O cover me, Death,        From the sorrow!        Wouldst thou not have me        Curse thee for flying?    Thou must hearken, maid, to my prayer:    Pierce thou my heart with thy sword!    BRÜNNHILDE [_Impressively._          Live for the sake        Of thy love, O woman!        Rescue the pledge        Thou has gotten from him:    The Wälsung's child thou shalt bear!
