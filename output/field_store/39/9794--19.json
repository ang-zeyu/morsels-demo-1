Between the others there is a very large river called Mergeo, from  which is produced a large quantity of inferior rice for the common  people, which the Malabars come here to buy, with their sambuks, in  exchange for cocoa nuts, oil, and jagra, which are much used in this  country.      HONOR.    Having passed this river Aliga,[165] and going along the coast to  the south-east, there is another river, at ten leagues distance,  with a good town near the sea, called Honor,[166] and the Malabars  call it Povaran; many of them come to this place to fetch cargoes of  inferior brownish rice, which is their peculiar food: and they bring  cocoa nuts, oil and jagra, and wine of the palm trees, from which  grow the cocoa nuts.      BATECALA.    Ten leagues further along this coast to the south is another small  river, with a large town called Baticala,[167] of very great trade  in merchandise, inhabited by many Moors and Gentiles, very  commercial people. And at this port congregate many ships from  Orguz, to load very good white rice, sugar in powder, of which there  is much in this country, for they do not know how to make it in  loaves; and it is worth at the rate of two hundred and forty  maravedis the arroba.[168] They likewise load much iron, and these  three kinds of goods are what are chiefly shipped at this place: and  also some spices and drugs, which the Malabars import. There are  many myrobalans of all sorts, and very good preserves are made with  them, which the ships of Ormuz, which traffic at this place, export  for the Arabs and Persians. They used each year to bring to this  port many horses and pearls, which were there sold for the whole  kingdom of Narsinga, and now they take them all to the city of Goa,  on account of the Portuguese. Some ships are also laden at this  place for Aden, risking themselves, although it is forbidden them by  the Portuguese. Many Malabar ships and sambuks also come to this  port to take in rice, sugar, and iron; and they bring cocoa nuts,  palm sugar, cocoa nut oil, and palm wine, in return for these  things, and spices and drugs, concealed from the Portuguese who  prohibit them. This town produces much revenue to the king. Its  governor is a Gentile; he is named Damaqueti. He is very rich in  money and jewels. The king of Narsinga has given this place and  others to a nephew of his, who rules and governs them, and lives in  great State and calls himself king, but he is in obedience to the  king his uncle. In this kingdom they make a great practice of  duelling, for on account of anything they at once challenge one  another, and the king at once grants them a field and arms, and  appoints a time for killing each other, and gives them seconds, who  back up each his own man. They go to fight one another bare from the  waist upwards, and from the waist downwards wrapped in cotton cloths  drawn tightly round, and with many folds, and with their arms, which  are swords, bucklers and daggers.[169] And the king appoints them of  equal length. They enter the lists with great pleasure, first saying  their prayers, and in a very few passes they kill each other in the  presence of the king and many people, without any one speaking  except the seconds, of whom each encourages his own man. This town  of Baticala pays a yearly tribute to the king of Portugal; much  copper is also sold in it each year, which is taken into the  interior of the country to make money, and cauldrons and other pans  which they use. There is also sold there much quicksilver,  vermilion, coral, alum and ivory. This town is situated in level  country, it is very populous, and not walled; it is surrounded with  many gardens, very good estates, and very fresh and abundant water.  There is in this place gold coin called Pardan,[170] and it is worth  three hundred and twenty maravedis; and there is another silver coin  called _dama_, worth twenty. The weights are called bahars, and each  bahar is equal to four quintals of Portugal.[171]      MAYANDUR.    Having passed Baticala, at ten leagues towards the south is another  small river, on which there is a town called Mayandur, under the  jurisdiction of Baticala, in which much rice is gathered of a good  quality, which is shipped at Baticala. The people of this town sow  it principally in certain watery valleys, which they plough with  oxen and with buffaloes, two and two, in couples, with their ploughs  after our fashion, and they put the rice for seed in some hollow  irons placed in the ploughshare, which entering the earth ploughing  it and making a furrow, leave behind the seed in it, because  otherwise they would not be able to sow it on account of the  quantity of water; and on dry land they sow it by hand. They gather  the harvest twice every year from this watery land, and it is of  four sorts of rice. The first they call girazat, which is the best;  the second jani bazal,[172] the third camagar, and the fourth  pachari: each one has its price, and there is a great difference  between one and the other.      BACAVOR BAZALOR.    There are two small rivers ten leagues further along the coast to  the south, and on both of them towns, one of which is called  Bacavor, and the other Basalor;[173] both belong to the kingdom of  Narsinga. In these also there is much rice of good quality, which is  there shipped for all parts: and many ships come from Malabar, and  sambuks great and small, which take this rice on board in sacks of a  fanega[174] each, which is worth from one hundred and fifty to two  hundred maravedis each fanega, according to its goodness. Ships also  put in here from Ormuz, Aden, Xeher, and many other places, to take  in cargo for Canaor and Calicut. They also ship there much rice in  exchange for copper, cocoa nuts, jagra, oil of cocoa nuts, for the  Malabars maintain themselves with scarcely anything else but rice,  since the country of Malabar is small and very populous: so full of  inhabitants, that it may almost be said that all the country is one  single city from the mountain Deli to Coulam.      MANGALOR.    Having left these places, at ten leagues distance there is another  large river towards the south, along the sea-shore, where there is a  very large town, peopled by Moors and Gentiles, of the kingdom of  Narsinga, called Mangalor.[175] There many ships always load brown  rice, which is much better and more healthy than the white, for  Malabar, for the common people, and it is very cheap. They also ship  there much rice in Moorish ships for Aden, also pepper, which  henceforward the earth begins to produce, but little of it, and  better than all the other which the Malabars bring to this place in  small vessels. The banks of this river are very pretty, and very  full of woods and palm trees, and are very thickly inhabited by  Moors and Gentiles, and studded with fine buildings and houses of  prayer of the Gentiles, which are very large, and enriched with  large revenues. There are also many mosques, where they greatly  honour Mahomed.      CUNBALA.    Ten leagues further along the same coast to the south, is another  town of the Gentiles, of the kingdom of Narsinga, which is called  Cunbala. In it also much brown and very bad rice is harvested, which  the Malabars go to buy there, and load it in their vessels for the  lowest people amongst them, and of the Mahaldiu islands, which are  across from Malabar, because it is very cheap, and the people poor;  and they sell it there in exchange for thread for making cordage for  ships. This thread is made of a covering and integument which grows  upon the cocoa nuts of the palm trees, and a great quantity of it is  produced; and in that place it is a great article of commerce with  all parts. This town of Cunbala has a lord to rule and govern it for  the kingdom of Narsinga, and it is frontier to the kingdom of  Cananor: because here the kingdom of Narsinga comes to an end along  the coast of this province of Tulinat.      OF THE CUSTOMS AND GREATNESS OF THIS KINGDOM OF NARSINGA IN THE  INTERIOR OF THE COUNTRY.    Leaving this sea coast, and going inland into the kingdom of  Narsinga, at twelve or fifteen leagues distance there is a very high  mountain range, precipitous and difficult of ascent, which stretches  from the beginning of this kingdom to Cape Comeri,[176] which is  beyond the Malabar country; and the before-mentioned province of  Tulinat is at the foot of this range, between it and the sea. And  the Indians say that in former times all these low grounds were sea,  which reached to the said range, and that in process of time the sea  uncovered it, and swelled it up in other parts, and to the foot of  those mountains. There are many traces of things of the sea, and all  the low ground is very level like the sea, and the mountain chain is  very craggy, and seems to rise to the heavens; and it is not  possible to ascend, except in a few parts, and with difficulty,  which is a cause of great strength to the Malabars, for were it not  for the difficulty of entering their country on account of the  roughness of these mountains, the King of Narsinga would already  have conquered them. This range is peopled in several parts, with  good towns and villages, very luxuriant in water and delicious  fruit: and in it there are many wild boars, and large and fine deer,  many leopards, ounces, lions, tigers, bears, and some animals of an  ashy colour, which look like horses, very active, and which cannot  be caught.[177] There are serpents with wings, which fly, very  venomous, so that their breath and looks kill whatever person places  himself very near them, and they always go amongst the trees. There  are also many wild elephants, and many stones of gegonzas,[178]  amethysts, and soft sapphires, are found in the rivers where they  are deposited. They carry them from the mountains to sell them in  the Malabar towns, where they are wrought."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3829"],[0,"Love Among the Chickens (#16)"],[1,"ously. They had played an earnest,  unobtrusive game, and generally seemed glad when it was over. Mr. Chase  was not of this sort. His service was bottled lightning. His returns  behaved like jumping crackers. He won the first game in precisely six  strokes. He served. Only once did I take the service with the full face  of the racquet, and then I seemed to be stopping a bullet. I returned  it into the net. The last of the series struck the wooden edge of my  racquet, and soared over the back net into the shrubbery, after the  manner of a snick to long slip off a fast bowler.    \"Game,\" said Mr. Chase, \"we'll look for that afterwards.\"    I felt a worm and no man. Phyllis, I thought, would probably judge my  entire character from this exhibition. A man, she would reflect, who  could be so feeble and miserable a failure at tennis, could not be good  for much in any department of life. She would compare me instinctively  with my opponent, and contrast his dash and brilliance with my own  inefficiency. Somehow the massacre was beginning to have a bad effect  on my character. All my self-respect was ebbing. A little more of this,  and I should become crushed,--a mere human jelly. It was my turn to  serve. Service is my strong point at tennis. I am inaccurate, but  vigorous, and occasionally send in a quite unplayable shot. One or two  of these, even at the expense of a fault or so, and I might be  permitted to retain at least a portion of my self-respect.    I opened with a couple of faults. The sight of Phyllis, sitting calm  and cool in her chair under the cedar, unnerved me. I served another  fault. And yet another.    \"Here, I say, Garnet,\" observed Mr. Chase plaintively, \"do put me out  of this hideous suspense. I'm becoming a mere bundle of quivering  ganglions.\"    I loathe facetiousness in moments of stress.    I frowned austerely, made no reply, and served another fault, my fifth.    Matters had reached a crisis. Even if I had to lob it underhand, I must  send the ball over the net with the next stroke.    I restrained myself this time, eschewing the careless vigour which had  marked my previous efforts. The ball flew in a slow semicircle, and  pitched inside the correct court. At least, I told myself, I had not  served a fault.    What happened then I cannot exactly say. I saw my opponent spring  forward like a panther and whirl his racquet. The next moment the back  net was shaking violently, and the ball was rolling swiftly along the  ground on a return journey to the other court.    \"Love-forty,\" said Mr. Chase. \"Phyllis!\"    \"Yes?\"    \"That was the Tilden Slosh.\"    \"I thought it must be,\" said Phyllis.    In the third game I managed to score fifteen. By the merest chance I  returned one of his red-hot serves, and--probably through surprise--he  failed to send it back again.    In the fourth and fifth games I omitted to score. Phyllis had left the  cedar now, and was picking flowers from the beds behind the court.    We began the sixth game. And now for some reason I played really well.  I struck a little vein of brilliance. I was serving, and this time a  proportion of my serves went over the net instead of trying to get  through. The score went from fifteen all to forty-fifteen. Hope began  to surge through my veins. If I could keep this up, I might win yet.    The Tilden Slosh diminished my lead by fifteen. Then I got in a really  fine serve, which beat him. 'Vantage In. Another Slosh. Deuce. Another  Slam. 'Vantage out. It was an awesome moment. There is a tide in the  affairs of men, which, taken by the flood--I served. Fault. I served  again,--a beauty. He returned it like a flash into the corner of the  court. With a supreme effort I got to it. We rallied. I was playing  like a professor. Then whizz--!    The Slosh had beaten me on the post.    \"Game _and_--,\" said Mr. Chase, tossing his racquet into the air and  catching it by the handle. \"Good game that last one.\"    I turned to see what Phyllis thought of it.    At the eleventh hour I had shown her of what stuff I was made.    She had disappeared.    \"Looking for Miss Derrick?\" said Chase, jumping the net, and joining me  in my court, \"she's gone into the house.\"    \"When did she go?\"    \"At the end of the fifth game,\" said Chase.    \"Gone to dress for dinner, I suppose,\" he continued. \"It must be  getting late. I think I ought to be going, too, if you don't mind. The  professor gets a little restive if I keep him waiting for his daily  bread. Great Scott, that watch can't be right! What do you make of it?  Yes, so do I. I really think I must run. You won't mind. Good-night,  then. See you to-morrow, I hope.\"    I walked slowly out across the fields. That same star, in which I had  confided on a former occasion, was at its post. It looked placid and  cheerful. _It_ never got beaten by six games to love under the very  eyes of a lady-star. _It_ was never cut out ignominiously by infernally  capable lieutenants in His Majesty's Navy. No wonder it was cheerful.        CHAPTER XIV    A COUNCIL OF WAR    \"The fact is,\" said Ukridge, \"if things go on as they are now, my lad,  we shall be in the cart. This business wants bucking up. We don't seem  to be making headway. Why it is, I don't know, but we are _not_ making  headway. Of course, what we want is time. If only these scoundrels of  tradesmen would leave us alone for a spell we could get things going  properly. But we're hampered and rattled and worried all the time.  Aren't we, Millie?\"    \"Yes, dear.\"    \"You don't let me see the financial side of the thing enough,\" I  complained. \"Why don't you keep me thoroughly posted? I didn't know we  were in such a bad way. The fowls look fit enough, and Edwin hasn't had  one for a week.\"    \"Edwin knows as well as possible when he's done wrong, Mr. Garnet,\"  said Mrs. Ukridge. \"He was so sorry after he had killed those other  two.\"    \"Yes,\" said Ukridge, \"I saw to that.\"    \"As far as I can see,\" I continued, \"we're going strong. Chicken for  breakfast, lunch, and dinner is a shade monotonous, perhaps, but look  at the business we're doing. We sold a whole heap of eggs last week.\"    \"But not enough, Garny old man. We aren't making our presence felt.  England isn't ringing with our name. We sell a dozen eggs where we  ought to be selling them by the hundred, carting them off in trucks for  the London market and congesting the traffic. Harrod's and Whiteley's  and the rest of them are beginning to get on their hind legs and talk.  That's what they're doing. Devilish unpleasant they're making  themselves. You see, laddie, there's no denying it--we _did_ touch them  for the deuce of a lot of things on account, and they agreed to take it  out in eggs. All they've done so far is to take it out in apologetic  letters from Millie. Now, I don't suppose there's a woman alive who can  write a better apologetic letter than her nibs, but, if you're  broad-minded and can face facts, you can't help seeing that the  juiciest apologetic letter is not an egg. I meant to say, look at it  from their point of view. Harrod--or Whiteley--comes into his store in  the morning, rubbing his hands expectantly. 'Well,' he says, 'how many  eggs from Combe Regis to-day?' And instead of leading him off to a  corner piled up with bursting crates, they show him a four-page letter  telling him it'll all come right in the future. I've never run a store  myself, but I should think that would jar a chap. Anyhow, the blighters  seem to be getting tired of waiting.\"    \"The last letter from Harrod's was quite pathetic,\" said Mrs. Ukridge  sadly.    I had a vision of an eggless London. I seemed to see homes rendered  desolate and lives embittered by the slump, and millionaires bidding  against one another for the few rare specimens which Ukridge had  actually managed to despatch to Brompton and Bayswater.    Ukridge, having induced himself to be broad-minded for five minutes,  now began to slip back to his own personal point of view and became  once more the man with a grievance. His fleeting sympathy with the  wrongs of Mr. Harrod and Mr. Whiteley disappeared.    \"What it all amounts to,\" he said complainingly, \"is that they're  infernally unreasonable. I've done everything possible to meet them.  Nothing could have been more manly and straightforward than my  attitude. I told them in my last letter but three that I proposed to  let them have the eggs on the _Times_ instalment system, and they said  I was frivolous. They said that to send thirteen eggs as payment for  goods supplied to the value of 25 pounds 1s. 8 1/2 d. was mere  trifling. Trifling, I'll trouble you! That's the spirit in which they  meet my suggestions. It was Harrod who did that. I've never met Harrod  personally, but I'd like to, just to ask him if that's his idea of  cementing amiable business relations. He knows just as well as anyone  else that without credit commerce has no elasticity. It's an elementary  rule. I'll bet he'd have been sick if chappies had refused to let him  have tick when he was starting his store. Do you suppose Harrod, when  he started in business, paid cash down on the nail for everything? Not  a bit of it. He went about taking people by the coat-button and asking  them to be good chaps and wait till Wednesday week. Trifling! Why,  those thirteen eggs were absolutely all we had over after Mrs. Beale  had taken what she wanted for the kitchen. As a matter of fact, if it's  anybody's fault, it's Mrs. Beale's. That woman literally eats eggs.\"    \"The habit is not confined to her,\" I said.    \"Well, what I mean to say is, she seems to bathe in them.\"    \"She says she needs so many for puddings, dear,\" said Mrs. Ukridge. \"I  spoke to her about it yesterday. And of course, we often have  omelettes.\"    \"She can't make omelettes without breaking eggs,\" I urged.    \"She can't make them without breaking us, dammit,\" said Ukridge. \"One  or two more omelettes, and we're done for. No fortune on earth"]]]
