At the end of about ten minutes she unlocked  the door.    \"Don't scold me for shutting you out,\" said she, embracing me.  \"Look at me. Have I not made myself beautiful? See! My hair just as  you like it, high, and my neck uncovered. But my poor neck is so  extremely shy that it never could have displayed itself in the broad  light, if I had not encouraged it a little by wearing a low-necked  gown. After all, it is only right to be in full-dress uniform at a  supper with the authority.\"    \"What supper?\"    \"Why, our supper. My supper with you, of course. Don't you see my  illumination and the table covered with flowers and good things to  eat? I had it all ready in the alcove; but, you see, to push the  table before the fire and make something of a toilet, I had to be  alone. I have a big drop of old Chambertin for you. Come, Monsieur,  come to supper; I am as hungry as a bear! May I offer you this  chicken-wing?\"    \"This is a charming idea of yours, my love, but I really feel ashamed  of myself,--in my dressing-gown.\"    \"Take it off, sir, if you are uncomfortable, but do not leave me with  this chicken-wing on my hands. Wait a minute; I want to wait upon you  myself.\" And rising, she swung her napkin over her arm and pulled up  her sleeve to her elbow. \"Isn't that the way the waiters do at the  restaurants, tell me?\"    \"Exactly. But stop a moment, waiter; will you permit me to kiss your  hand?\"    \"I haven't time,\" she said, smiling, and she drove the corkscrew  bravely into the neck of a bottle. \"Chambertin!--a pretty name. And,  besides, do you remember, before we were married--_sapristi_, what a  hard cork!--you told me you liked it on account of a play by Alfred  de Musset?--which you never gave me to read, by the way. Do you see  those little Bohemian glass tumblers that I bought especially for  to-night? We will drink each other's health in them.\"    \"And his too, eh?\"    \"The heir's, you mean? Poor little love of an heir, I should think  so! Then I shall hide the two glasses and bring them out again this  day next year, eh, dear? They will be the Christmas-supper glasses,  and we will have supper every year before the hearth, you and I  alone, until our very old, old age.\"    \"Yes; but when we shall have lost all our teeth--\"    \"Never mind; we shall have nice little soups, and it will none the  less be very sweet. Another piece for me, please, with a little  jelly, thank you.\"    As she held out her plate to me, I caught a glimpse of her arm, the  pretty contours of which disappeared in the lace.    \"What are you looking up my sleeve for instead of eating?\"    \"I am looking at your arm, dear. You are exquisitely pretty to-night;  do you know it? Your hair is wonderfully becoming, and that gown--I  had never seen that gown before.\"    \"_Dame!_ When a person starts out to make a conquest!\"    \"You are adorable!\"    \"Are you quite sure that I am adorable to-night, charming,  ravishing?\" Then, looking at her bracelet attentively, \"In that case  I don't see why--I don't see--\"    \"What is it that you don't see, dear?\"    \"I don't see why you don't come and kiss me.\"    And as the kiss was prolonged, she threw her head back, showing the  double row of her pretty white teeth, exclaiming between her peals of  laughter,--    \"Give me some more _pâté_! I want some more _pâté_! Take care! You  are going to break my Bohemian glass, the fruit of my economy! There  is always some disaster when you try to kiss me. You remember at  Madame de Brill's ball, two nights before we were married, how you  tore my gown while we were waltzing in the little parlor?\"    \"Well, but it is very difficult to do two things at once,--keep time  with the music and kiss your partner.\"    \"I remember when mamma asked me how I tore my gown, I felt that I was  blushing up to the roots of my hair. And Madame D., that old yellow  witch, said to me with her lenten smile, 'What a brilliant color  you have to-night, my child!' I could have choked her! I said I had  caught my gown on a nail in the door. I was watching you out of the  corner of my eye. You were twirling your mustache, and you seemed  quite vexed. You keep all the truffles for yourself,--how nice of  you! Not that one; I want that big black one there,--in the corner.  Well, after all, it was none the less very wrong, because--no, no,  don't fill my glass; I don't want to get tipsy--because if we had not  married (that might have happened, you know; they say that marriages  hang by a thread), well, if the thread had not been strong enough,  here I was left with that kiss on my shoulder,--a pretty plight!\"    \"Nonsense! It does not stain.\"    \"Yes, sir, it does; I beg your pardon, but it does stain, and so much  so that there are husbands, I am told, who spill their blood to wash  out those little stains.\"    \"I was only jesting, dear. Heavens! I should think it did! Fancy!  Why--\"    \"Ah, I am glad to hear you say so. I like to see you get angry. You  are just a wee bit jealous, tell me, are you not? Well, upon my word!  I asked you for the big black one, and you are quietly eating it!\"    \"I am very sorry, my love; I beg your pardon. I forgot all about it.\"    \"Yes, just as you did when we were being married. I was obliged to  touch your elbow to make you answer yes to Monsieur the Mayor's kind  words!\"    \"Kind words?\"    \"Yes, kind words. I thought the mayor was charming. No one could have  been more happy than he was in addressing me. 'Mademoiselle, do you  consent to take this great big ugly little man who stands beside you  for your lawful--' [Laughing with her mouth full.] I was about to say  to him, 'Let us understand each other, Monsieur; there is much to  be said for and against.' Heavens! I am choking! [Bursts into great  peals of laughter.] I was wrong in not making some restrictions.  There! I am teasing you, and that is stupid. I said yes with my whole  heart, I assure you, my darling, and the word was only too weak. When  I think that all women, even the bad ones, use that same word, I feel  ashamed of not having invented a better one. [Holding up her glass.]  Here is to our golden wedding!\"    \"And here is to his christening, little mother!\"    In an undertone: \"Tell me, dear, are you sorry you married me?\"    (Laughing.) \"Yes. [Kissing her on the shoulder.] I think I have found  the stain. Here it is.\"    \"Do you realize that it is two o'clock. The fire is out. I am--you  won't laugh? Well, I am just a little dizzy!\"    \"That was a famous _pâté_!\"    \"A famous _pâté_! We will have a cup of tea in the morning, eh, dear?\"    [Illustration]          THE YULE LOG.    From the French of JULES SIMON.      Yesterday was my birthday. A number of friends who have never seen me  wrote to congratulate me upon having reached the age of eighty. They  are mistaken; I am not as old as all that. I can readily understand  that a few years more or less make very little difference to them,  but they certainly make all the difference in the world to me. I am  still far from the dignity of an octogenarian; yet I confess that I  am very old, and at my age one likes to recall one's early childhood.  It is a very well-known fact that old people,--it seems that I am  old, which makes me furious, and I really believe that I should  scarcely realize it, if people did not take particular pains, out of  pure kindness, of course, to remind me of it every moment,--it is a  well-known fact, I say, that old people recall the first scenes of  their life with marvellous accuracy. I have often heard Chevreul  speak of having been present on the Place de la Révolution at the  very moment when Louis XVI. was executed. His nurse had carried him  there, the wretch! He neither saw nor understood anything; but he  remembered the words of a _garde nationale_ who scolded the woman for  having brought a child to such a place. \"He delivered there and then  a perfect sermon on the subject,\" he used to say, \"and I remember  every word of it.\" But let us not speak of tragedies.    I want to take you with me to Brittany, not without having  first warned you against myself, however. You must not take me  too literally when I describe the customs of that country. My  descriptions are absolutely faithful, but they represent Brittany  as it was from 1815 to 1830. I went back there this summer after an  absence of half a century, and I recognized nothing but the scenery.  The men are all civilized, and far more Parisian than I. In order to  re-classify them I should have been compelled to drive them back to  their national dress, that they so foolishly gave up.    I will take you back, therefore, to the year 1822; and you would  not doubt it for an instant if you could follow me into my father's  study. The walls were papered with Republican money. He had obtained  it in exchange for cash; and when it turned out to be as worthless  as waste paper, he determined that it should be of some use to him  anyway. I fancy that its usefulness consisted in reminding him of  the fragility of human things. The walls were also decorated with  portraits of the royal family, from the King down to M. de Villèle,  all tacked on with pins. But these portraits were not to be relied  upon, for when they were turned upside down, they represented, by  some ingenious combination, the Ogre of Corsica, the King of Rome,  and the Empress Marie Louise. They were suited to all tastes and all  opinions.    This extraordinary study was situated on the first floor,--for our  house had a first floor, differing thus from the other houses of the  borough, which had nothing but a ground floor. It also had a slate  roof, which filled me with legitimate pride. It looked out upon the  street which circled the graveyard; and I will say at once, to be  sincere, that there was no other street in St. Jean Brévelay.

Nurse must see this; come here, Nurse.\"    Mrs. O'Toole came at the call.    \"Did you ever see any place like that?\" asked her young mistress.    \"Musha, then it makes me heart sore to look at it there, an' the rale  place so far away,\" said Nurse, crossing herself. \"Och! God be with  ould times! The blessin' of Heaven rest on ye, Dungar! Many's the  bright day I seen in ye! Och! Miss Kate, avourneen, look at the little  garden gate, where we used to go listen to Paddy Doolan's fairy tales,  an' the crather so dirty I darn't let him up into the house; an' the  Captin dhrew it himself!\"    Here Mrs. O'Toole ceased her comments, perceiving from her young lady's  silence, and glistening eyes, that her memory was even more vividly  awakened.    \"There is the old church yard where the people were so fond of burying  their relatives; with a peep at the round tower,\" said I, substituting  a less \"home\" scene, to assist her in recovering herself. \"Do you  recognise this view? the cliffs near the shore, and the broad Atlantic,  with the Cruakmore hills in the distance?\"    \"Oh yes, yes! and this one; look, Nurse, the dingle, and Andy the  fisherman.\"    \"The Lord save us, is'nt the very moral of Andy; the ould thief, to  have a right honourable drawing him.\"    \"Very rude sketches, Miss Vernon; I was then even a greater tyro than  now.\"    \"They are worth whole galleries of Raphaels and Titians to me,\" said  she with a sigh.    My sketch of the view from the window was much admired; Miss Vernon  pronounced it excellent, quite worthy of Mr. Winter's approval. After  a few more remarks, I observed that I would not detain her, as I  perceived she was in walking costume.    \"We were going across the river,\" she replied, \"on an errand I should  like to accomplish; what are you going to do? Grandpapa and Mr. Winter  both away, you had better come with us.\"    To this frank invitation I replied, \"Most willingly, wherever you  choose to lead me.\"    A message being left with Mrs. O'Toole's sub, for Colonel Vernon,  informing him of my arrival, in case his return should precede ours,  and Nurse having crammed some additional articles into a basket already  overflowing, Miss Vernon stepped through the open window, calling  Cormac, who soon made his appearance, noticing me in a grave and  dignified manner. Mrs. O'Toole and I followed our fair conductress  down the sloping pleasure ground, now gay with many coloured dahlias;  at the bottom of which a small door led into a road by the river side.  Nurse produced a ponderous key, and carefully locked it after us. We  turned to the left, and I walked between Mrs. O'Toole and her nursling,  who looked charmingly in her cotton morning dress and her cottage straw  bonnet, with its white ribbon; her luxuriant brown hair doing away with  all necessity for the curious floral exhibitions ladies usually display  under theirs.    \"Nothing new or strange has occurred here since you went,\" said Miss  Vernon, in a quiet, confidential tone; \"grandpapa has been very well,  and quite looked forward to seeing you again. Mr. Winter has been very  busy driving Cyclops hither and thither, and twice got into a ditch;  and Miss Araminta Cox and Mrs. Winter agree in saying you are not at  all the sort of person they expected a Cavalry officer to be.\"    \"Errah! what do the likes of thim know about Cavalry officers?\"  exclaimed nurse, _en parenthèse_.    \"What did they expect?\" said I, laughing, \"something very terrific, in  the raw head and bloody bones style, I suppose?\"    \"I told them I had always found Dragoons very harmless, inoffensive  people,\" replied Miss Vernon, an arch glance displacing the pensive  depth of expression her eyes had assumed when gazing at the sketches of  her old home.    \"Indeed!\" said I, with some pique, \"well meaning creatures, useful  about a house.\"    Miss Vernon laughed, \"I see you would prefer being dreaded by Miss  Araminta Cox, so I'll not take your part any more.\"    We had by this time reached a sort of rude pier, shaded by a few old  thorn trees, limes, and horse chesnuts; an irregular rugged red stone  wall, which, sometimes retiring, sometimes advancing, followed the  course of the road, formed a very suitable back ground; and just here  an arch of heavy stone work sheltered a clear and deep well; beside  the little landing place lay a large flat-bottomed boat, and at its  bow sat a huge, rough, grizzled boatman, in a hairy cap and horn  spectacles, (looking coeval with the Priory Tower, which was visible  above the trees), intently reading a well thumbed book.    \"Elijah!\" called out Mrs. O'Toole. I started at the scriptural  appellation. \"Elijah! The onfortunate ould sinner is making his sowl;  he's as deaf as a stone. Elijah Bush, I say!\"    \"Ho, Cormac,\" said Miss Vernon.    The old man looked up, as the hound stepped on the gunnel and shook the  boat; and raising his cap, came forward, apologising respectfully for  his pre-occupation.    \"It bai'nt so often I get a sight of the Ward,\" said he, in a broad  Cumberland accent, \"but I'm main glad to see you.\"    Miss Vernon replied courteously.    \"Elijah, honey, is there e'er a throut to be got to day,\" said Nurse.    \"Not as I knows on, Marm; I did see Davy Jones passing on here, sure  enough, with the rods; but he hadn't took nothink then.\"    \"A'then, just look out for him like a good Christian, and tell him if  he's caught even the ghost of one, to have it up at the house, mind,  now.\"    \"Ay sure,\" said Elijah.    \"Ah! what'll I do at all at all,\" said Mrs. O'Toole to Miss Vernon, in  accents of great concern, \"if I can't get a throut for the Captin?\"    \"I dare say he will kindly endeavour to dine without one,\" she replied.    \"Then I am to have the pleasure of dining with you,\" said I.    \"Of course,\" said Kate, opening her eyes, \"where else would you dine?\"    I handed her into the boat, and after carefully assisting Mrs. O'Toole,  who accepted my _petits soins_ with a \"Musha, but I'm well attinded,\"  took my seat beside her.    A few vigorous strokes from Elijah's oars brought us across, and we  were standing at the foot of the broken rocky bank visible from the  windows of the cottage.    \"Is there much custom at your ferry now?\" asked Miss Vernon as we paid  him.    \"Not much to speak of, but I gets my crust; and at all events the Lord  will provide,\" he said, raising his cap.    \"Holy Vargin, listen to that now!\" said Mrs. O'Toole with much fervour,  \"you're a mighty religious man entirely, Elijah; faith, Father  Macdermott could'nt hould a candle to you, tho' he laid the Divil at  Innishogue.\"    \"Good bye,\" said her young lady, \"we will be back in about an hour,  Elijah.\"    Climbing the steep bank, we stood for a few moments at the top to look  at the cottage, peeping prettily out from between the ivy-grown old  church and the spreading oak I have before described; then following  the path across the meadow where they were cutting the after grass, we  fell into marching order, Mrs. O'Toole at one side of Kate, and I at  the other, Cormac walking soberly between us.    It was a regular autumnal day--clear, calm, and grey, with a slight  crispness in the air, an _avant courier_ of frost. The wood through  which the path soon led us, brilliant with all the variegated tints  peculiar to the season, and fragrant with the odour of the gums exuding  from the fir trees and young larches, seemed of tolerable extent, and  now and then a pheasant would rise suddenly, with a whirr through  the air, almost from our feet. A few withered leaves already strewed  the ground, and nature appeared in her fullest beauty, though it was  evident she was on the turning point. Occasionally we caught a glimpse  of the river, and frequently heard it fretting against the rocks, which  here and there opposed its progress.    Miss Vernon often paused to draw my attention to any picture, as she  termed it, that struck her fancy; sometimes it was a long glade almost  over-arched with leafy boughs, still retaining in their sheltered  position the freshness of early summer, with a line of blue country  beyond; sometimes it was a single tree of peculiar beauty, now a few  old moss-grown trunks forgotten by the woodcutter, now a peep at a  cottage chimney, with blue curling smoke at the other side of the  river; every thing, from the rich green grass, and the endless variety  of wild creepers, to the dry exhilarating atmosphere, seemed to be a  source of joyous, grateful pleasure to her happy nature, gifted, as it  appeared to be, with so deep a power of enjoyment. I found something  contagious in her airy gaiety, and the extraordinarily keen sense of  nature's beauty with which she was endowed, and asked her why it was  she did not pursue drawing more steadily.    \"I do not know,\" she replied; \"it does not seem to come so naturally to  me as music, though no one revels in scenery more delightedly than I  do. Are you not obliged to me for this walk?\"    \"Indeed I am, I shall not soon forget it.\"    \"What strange mixtures we are,\" said Miss Vernon; \"I felt so sad after  looking at those drawings of Dungar; and now it seems to me as if the  mere sense of existence is happiness enough. Ah, there is a great  deal that is delightful in this life of ours, let poets and popular  preachers say of it what they will.\"    \"It's only hearts like yours, avourneen, that draw the sunshine round  them,\" said Mrs. O'Toole.    \"True, Miss Vernon,\" I observed; \"but what long intervals of much that  is unpleasant--what bitter mortifications!\"    \"Yes,\" she replied; \"but there is no life so sad that it has not  something sweet also.\"    \"When the curse of poverty falls on you, and holds you back from the  accomplishment of all your soul most longs for,\" I said.    \"Ah, that would be terrible indeed,\" said she, a little startled at my  vehemence; \"but do you know poverty is not so dreadful.\"    \"Och! then, God help you Miss Kate, what do you"]]]
