[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38777"],[0,"Lad: A Dog (#16)"],[1,"r? A four-day show is the most fearful thing a high-strung dog  can go through--next to vivisection. A little one-day show, for about  eight hours, is no special ordeal, especially if the dog's Master  stays near him all the time; but a four-day show is--is Sheol! I  wonder the S. P. C. A. doesn't do something to make it easier.\"    \"If I'd known--if we'd known----\" began the Mistress.    \"Most of these folks know!\" returned the collie man. \"They do it year  after year. There's a mighty strong lure in a bit of ribbon. Why, look  what an exhibitor will do for it! He'll risk his dog's health and make  his dog's life a horror. He'll ship him a thousand miles in a tight  crate from Show to Show. (Some dogs die under the strain of so many  journeys.) And he'll pay five dollars for every class the dog's  entered in. Some exhibitors enter a single dog in five or six classes.  The Association charges one dollar admission to the show. Crowds of  people pay the price to come in. The exhibitor gets none of the  gate-money. All he gets for his five dollars or his twenty-five  dollars is an off chance at a measly scrap of colored silk worth maybe  four cents. That, and the same off-chance at a tiny cash prize that  doesn't come anywhere near to paying his expenses. Yet, for all, it's  the straightest sport on earth. Not an atom of graft in it, and seldom  any profit.... So long! I wish you folks luck with 658.\"    He strolled on. The Mistress was winking very fast and was bending  over Lad, petting him and whispering to him. The Master looked in  curiosity at a kennel man who was holding down a nearby collie while a  second man was trimming the scared dog's feet and fetlocks with a pair  of curved shears; and now the Master noted that nearly every dog but  Lad was thus clipped as to ankle.    At an adjoining cell a woman was sifting almost a pound of talcum  powder into her dog's fur to make the coat fluffier. Elsewhere similar  weird preparations were in progress. And Lad's only preparation had  been baths and brushing! The Master began to feel like a fool.    People all along the collie line presently began to brush dogs  (smoothing the fur the wrong way to fluff it) and to put other  finishing touches on the poor beasts' make-up. The collie man strolled  back to 658.    \"The Novice class in collies is going to be called presently,\" he told  the Mistress. \"Where's your exhibition-leash and choke-collar? I'll  help you put them on.\"    \"Why, we've only this chain,\" said the Mistress. \"We bought it for  Lad yesterday, and this is his regular collar--though he never has had  to wear it. Do we have to have another kind?\"    \"You don't have to unless you want to,\" said the collie man, \"but it's  best--especially, the choke-collar. You see, when exhibitors go into  the ring, they hold their dogs by the leash close to the neck. And if  their dogs have choke-collars, why, then they've _got_ to hold their  heads high when the leash is pulled. They've got to, to keep from  strangling. It gives them a fine, proud carriage of the head, that  counts a lot with some judges. All dog-photos are taken that way. Then  the leash is blotted out of the negative. Makes the dog look showy,  too--keeps him from slumping. Can't slump much when you're trying not  to choke, you know.\"    \"It's horrible! _Horrible!_\" shuddered the Mistress. \"I wouldn't put  such a thing on Lad for all the prizes on earth. When I read Davis'  wonderful 'Bar Sinister' story, I thought dog-shows were a real treat  to dogs. I see, now, they're----\"    \"Your class is called!\" interrupted the collie man. \"Keep his head  high, keep him moving as showily as you can. Lead him close to you  with the chain as short as possible. Don't be scared if any of the  other dogs in the ring happen to fly at him. The attendants will look  out for all that. Good luck.\"    Down the aisle and to the wired gate of the north-eastern ring the  unhappy Mistress piloted the unhappier Lad. The big dog gravely kept  beside her, regardless of other collies moving in the same direction.  The Garden had begun to fill with visitors, and the ring was  surrounded with interested \"rail-birds.\" The collie classes, as  usual, were among those to be judged on the first day of the four.    Through the gate into the ring the Mistress piloted Lad. Six other  Novice dogs were already there. Beautiful creatures they were, and all  but one were led by kennel men. At the table, behind a ledger flanked  by piles of multicolored ribbons, sat the clerk. Beside the platform  stood a wizened and elderly little man in tweeds. He was McGilead, who  had been chosen as judge for the collie division. He was a Scot, and  he was also a man with stubborn opinions of his own as to dogs.    Around the ring, at the judge's order, the Novice collies were  paraded. Most of them stepped high and fast and carried their heads  proudly aloft--the thin choke-collars cutting deep into their furry  necks. One entered was a harum-scarum puppy who writhed and bit and  whirled about in ecstasy of terror.    Lad moved solemnly along at the Mistress' side. He did not pant or  curvet or look showy. He was miserable and every line of his splendid  body showed his misery. The Mistress, too, glancing at the more  spectacular dogs, wanted to cry--not because she was about to lose,  but because Lad was about to lose. Her heart ached for him. Again she  blamed herself bitterly for bringing him here.    McGilead, hands in pockets, stood sucking at an empty brier pipe, and  scanning the parade that circled around him. Presently he stepped up  to the Mistress, checked her as she filed past him, and said to her  with a sort of sorrowful kindness:    \"Please take your dog over to the far end of the ring. Take him into  the corner where he won't be in my way while I am judging.\"    Yes, he spoke courteously enough, but the Mistress would rather have  had him hit her across the face. Meekly she obeyed his command. Across  the ring, to the very farthest corner, she went--poor beautiful Lad  beside her, disgraced, weeded out of the competition at the very  start. There, far out of the contest, she stood, a drooping little  figure, feeling as though everyone were sneering at her dear dog's  disgrace.    Lad seemed to sense her sorrow. For, as he stood beside her, head and  tail low, he whined softly and licked her hand as if in encouragement.  She ran her fingers along his silky head. Then, to keep from crying,  she watched the other contestants.    No longer were these parading. One at a time and then in twos, the  judge was standing them on the platform. He looked at their teeth. He  pressed their heads between his hands. He \"hefted\" their hips. He ran  his fingers through their coats. He pressed his palm upward against  their underbodies. He subjected them to a score of such annoyances,  but he did it all with a quick and sure touch that not even the  crankiest of them could resent.    Then he stepped back and studied the quartet. After that he seemed to  remember Lad's presence, and, as though by way of earning his fee, he  slouched across the ring to where the forlorn Mistress was petting her  dear disgraced dog.    Lazily, perfunctorily, the judge ran his hand over Lad, with  absolutely none of the thoroughness that had marked his inspection of  the other dogs. Apparently there was no need to look for the finer  points in a disqualified collie. The sketchy examination did not last  three seconds. At its end the judge jotted down a number on a pad he  held. Then he laid one hand heavily on Lad's head and curtly thrust  out his other hand at the Mistress.    \"Can I take him away now?\" she asked, still stroking Lad's fur.    \"Yes,\" rasped the judge, \"and take this along with him.\"    In his outstretched hand fluttered a little bunch of silk--dark blue,  with gold lettering on it.    The blue ribbon! First prize in the Novice class! And this grouchy  little judge was awarding it--to _Lad!_    The Mistress looked very hard at the bit of blue and gold in her  fingers. She saw it through a queer mist. Then, as she stooped to  fasten it to Lad's collar, she furtively kissed the tiny white spot on  the top of his head.    \"It's something like the 'Bar Sinister' victory after all!\" she  exclaimed joyously as she rejoined the delighted Master at the ring  gate. \"But, oh, it was terrible for a minute or two, wasn't it?\"    Now, Angus McGilead, Esq. (late of Linlithgow, Scotland), had a  knowledge of collies such as is granted to few men, and this very fact  made him a wretchedly bad dog-show judge; as the Kennel Club,  which--on the strength of his fame--had engaged his services for this  single occasion, speedily learned. The greatest lawyer makes often the  worst judge. Legal annals prove this; and the same thing applies to  dog-experts. They are sane rather than judicial.    McGilead had scant patience with the ultra-modern, inbred and  grayhoundlike collies which had so utterly departed from their  ancestral standards. At one glimpse he had recognized Lad as a dog  after his own heart--a dog that brought back to him the murk and magic  of the Highland moors.    He had noted the deep chest, the mighty forequarters, the tiny white  paws, the incredible wealth of outer- and under-coat, the brush, the  grand head, and the soul in the eyes. This was such a dog as  McGilead's shepherd ancestors had admitted as an honored equal, at  hearth and board--such a dog, for brain and brawn and beauty, as a  Highland master would no sooner sell than he would sell his own child.    McGilead, therefore, had waved Lad aside while he judged the lesser  dogs of his class, lest he be tempted to look too much at Lad and too  little at them; and he rejoiced, at the last, to give honor where all  honor was due.    Through dreary hours that day Lad lay disconsolate in his cell, nose  between paws, while the stream of visitors flowed sluggishly past  him. His memory of the Guest-Law"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38827"],[0,"Journeys in Persia and Kurdistan, Volume 1 (of 2) (#16)"],[1,"air was  full of shouts and objurgations, till after much delay the forlorn  rabble all struggled to the _terra firma_ of a gravelly slope,  splashed from head to foot.    The road crosses low, rolling, gravelly hills, with an occasional  outcrop of red sandstone, and ascends on the whole. The sun was  bright, but the wind was strong and very cold. The Bashi Bazouk escort  was altogether harum-scarum and inconsequent, careering in circles,  and firing at birds (which they never hit) from the saddle, and when  we reached some low hills bearing a bad reputation, the officer, in  order to represent danger and his vigilant care, threw them out in all  directions scouting for robbers, till we came to a steepish hill  crowned by a round tower with a mushroom top, a few ruinous mud  buildings, and a tattered tent. Here the escort formed into one line,  and the ragged garrison into another, with an officer facing them, and  were photographed as they shivered in the biting wind. This tower is a  Turkish frontier fort.    Soon afterwards the Persian frontier is crossed, the hills increase  considerably in size, and mud was exchanged for firm, rough gravel. A  feature of the otherwise featureless landscape is the frequent  occurrence of towers like martello towers, on hill-tops, placed there  for the shelter of the guards who formerly kept a look-out for  robbers. In the uninteresting gravel lie pebbles of jasper and agate,  emerald green, red, yellow, and purple. The first object of the  slightest interest in this new country was a village of Ilyats, built  of reed screens, with roofs of goat's-hair cloth, and with small yards  with reed walls in front. The women, who wore full trousers and short  jackets, were tall, somewhat striking-looking, and unveiled. Their  hair hung down in long plaits, and they wore red handkerchiefs knotted  at the back of the head.    There an escort of four Persian _sowars_ joined us. The type of face  was that with which we are familiar on Sasanian coins and sculptured  stones, the brow and chin receding considerably, and the nose thin and  projecting, the profile suggesting a beak rather than a human face,  and the skin having the appearance of being drawn so tightly over the  bones as to force the eyes into singular prominence.      [Illustration: A TURKISH FRONTIER FORT.]    A six hours' march ended at the wildly-situated village of  Kasr-i-Shirin, high on the right bank of the Holwan, with a plantation  of dates on the left bank and considerable cultivation in the valley.  It has only eighty houses of the most wretched construction, rivalled  in height and size by middens, the drainage of which wastes itself on  the wretched roadway. A caravanserai of the most miserable  description, a square fort with a small garrison, and some large  graveyards with domed tombs and curious obelisks, are the salient  features of this village. Its wretched aspect is accounted for by its  insecurity. It has been destroyed by robber tribes as often as there  was anything worth destroying, and it has been so tossed to and fro  between Turkey and Persia as not to have any of the special  characteristics of either empire.    We stopped short of the village, at a great pile of building on a  height, in massiveness and irregularity resembling a German medieval  castle, in which a letter had secured accommodation. It has been  unoccupied since its owner, Jan Mir, a sheikh of a robber tribe, and  the terror of the surrounding neighbourhood, was made away with by the  Persian Government.    The accommodation consisted of great, dark, arched, vaulted rooms,  with stone-flagged floors, noble in size, but needing fifty candles  and huge log fires to light up and warm their dark recesses, and  gruesome and damp with one candle and a crackle of twigs. They were  clean, however, and their massive walls kept out the cold. The village  is at an elevation of 2300 feet, and the temperature has greatly  changed.    The interest of Kasr-i-Shirin is that it lies among masses of ancient  rubble, and that the slopes which surround it are completely covered  with hewn and unhewn stones of all sizes, the relics of a great city,  at the western extremity of which the present wretched hamlet  stands.[11] The walls, which are easily traced, enclose an irregular  square, the shortest front of which is said to be three miles long.  They are built of roughly-hewn blocks of gray and red sandstone, and  very hard mortar or concrete. The blocks are so huge in many places as  to deserve the often misused epithet Cyclopean.    Within this enclosure are remains of houses built of water-worn round  stones, which lie in monstrous heaps, and of a large fort on an  eminence. In another direction are the ruins of an immense palace of  quadrangular form, with only one entrance, and large underground rooms  now nearly choked up. There are remains of what must have been very  fine archways, but as the outer coating of hewn stone and all the  decorations have fallen off, leaving only the inner case of rough  rubble and concrete, the architectural forms are very badly defined,  and the aspect of what must once have been magnificent is now  forbidding and desolate. The remains of an aqueduct cut in the rock,  and of troughs and stone pipes by which water was brought into the  palace and city, from a distance of fifteen miles, are still traceable  among the desolations, but of the beautiful gardens which they  watered, and with which Khosroe surrounded the beautiful Shirin, not a  trace remains. There was a pale sunset, flushing with pale pink  distant leagues of sodden snow, and right across a lurid opening in a  heavy mass of black clouds the great ruined pile of the palace of  Khosroe the Magnificent stood out, a dismal commentary on splendour  and fame.    The promise of the evening was fulfilled the next day in windy rain,  which began gently, but afterwards fell in persistent torrents, varied  by pungent swirls of sleet and snow. Leaving the gash through cliffs  with curious stratification in white and red, formed by the Holwan,  the day was spent in skirting or crossing low hills. The mud was very  deep and tenacious, and the rate of progress barely two miles an hour.  There were no caravans, travellers, or population, and no birds or  beasts. The rain clouds hung low and heavy, mists boiled up from among  the folds of the hills, the temperature fell perceptibly. It was  really inspiriting for people protected by good mackintoshes.    After riding for six hours the rain changed into sleet and wet snow,  blotting out the hills and creating an unnatural twilight, in which we  floundered in mud up to the mules' knees into the filthiest village I  have ever seen, a compound of foul, green ditches, piles of dissolving  manure, mud hovels looking as if they were dissolving too, reed huts,  and an Ilyat village, grouped round the vilest of caravanserais, the  entrance to which was knee-deep in mire. To lodge in it was voted  impossible, and the escort led us in the darkening mist and pelting  sleet to an adjacent mud hamlet as hopeless-looking on the other side  of the bridge, where, standing up to the knees of the mules in liquid  manure, we sought but vainly for shelter, forded the Holwan, and  returned to the caravanserai through almost impassable slush.    It was simply loathsome, with its stench, its foulness, and its mire,  and was already crowded and noisy with men and beasts. There was a  great courtyard with arched recesses all round, too abominable to be  occupied, too exposed and ruinous, even had they been cleaned, to give  shelter from the driving sleet. The last resource was to pass through  an archway into the great, lofty mule stable, on both sides of which  are similar recesses or mangers, about ten feet by seven and about  eight feet high. The stable was of great size and height with a domed  roof. Probably it runs half-way round the quadrangle at the back of  the uninhabitable recesses. There were at least four hundred mules in  this place, jangling their great bells, and crowds of _katirgis_,  travellers, and _zaptiehs_, all wet and splashed over their heads with  mud, some unloading, others making fires and feeding their mules, all  shouting when they had anything to say, the Babel aggravated by the  clatter of the rattles of a hundred curry-combs and the squeals of  fighting horses.      [Illustration: LODGINGS FOR TRAVELLERS.]    The floor was deep with the manure of ages and piled with bales and  boxes. In the side recesses, which are about the height of a mule's  back, the muleteers camped with their fires and their goods, and laid  the provender for their beasts in the front. These places are the  mangers of the eastern caravanserai, or _khan_, or inn. Such must have  been the inn at Bethlehem, and surely the first step to the  humiliation of \"the death of the cross\" must have been the birth in  the manger, amidst the crowd and horrors of such a stable.    The odour was overpowering and the noise stunning, and when our wet,  mud-covered baggage animals came in, adding to the din, there was  hardly room to move, far less for the roll in which all mules indulge  when the loads are taken off; and the crush resulted in a fight, and  one mule got his fore-feet upon my \"manger,\" and threatened to share  it with me. It was an awful place to come to after a six hours' march  in rain and snow, but I slid off my mule into the recess, had it  carpeted, put down my chair, hung a blanket up in front, and prepared  to brave it, when the inhabitants of this room, the one place which  has any pretensions to being a room in the village, were bribed by an  offer of six _krans_ (about four shillings) to vacate it for me. Its  \"pretensions\" consist in being over a gateway, and in having a door,  and a square hole looking on the street; a crumbling stair slippery  with mud leads up to it. The roof leaks in every direction, and the  slimy floor"]]]
