Furious squalls  carried us into the true, or steady, wind, which we found very strong; and  as Port San Antonio was on the lee-bow, we had to carry such a press of  sail, that our excellent boat had nearly half the lee side of her deck  under water. By daylight we got into smooth water, and, with less wind and  better weather, steered for Port Famine. The smoother water enabled us to  light a fire and cook a meal, not an unimportant affair, as we had eaten  nothing since six o'clock on the preceding morning.    In our absence Mr. Graves had surveyed Lomas Bay, and, after his return,  Mr. Ainsworth had crossed the Strait with the gig and cutter to survey Port  San Antonio. They were victualled for five days; the gig was manned by my  own boat's crew, and the cutter by volunteers: but although they had not  come back, we felt no anxiety about their safety, being assured that Mr.  Ainsworth would not run the risk of crossing the Strait during bad weather.  The tempestuous state of the two following days, however, made us uneasy,  and on the third morning, when the wind moderated much, we looked out  anxiously for their arrival. In the evening the cutter returned; but, alas!  with the melancholy information of the loss of Mr. Ainsworth, and two  seamen, drowned by the upsetting of the gig. One of the latter was my  excellent coxswain, John Corkhill. The remainder of the gig's crew were  only rescued from drowning by the strenuous exertions of those in the  cutter.    Mr. Ainsworth, anxious to return to the ship, thought too little of the  difficulty and danger of crossing the Strait during unsettled weather. He  set out from Port San Antonio under sail, and, while sheltered by the land,  did very well; but as soon as they got into the offing, both wind and sea  increased so much that the gig was in great danger, although under only a  small close-reefed sail.    {64}    The people in the cutter were anxiously watching her labouring movements,  when she disappeared! They hastened to the spot--saved three men; but the  other two had gone down. Poor Ainsworth was still clinging to the gig's  gunwale when his shipmates eagerly approached; but letting go his hold from  extreme exhaustion, and being heavily clothed, he sunk from their sight to  rise no more.    He had been cheering the drowning crew, and trying to save his companions,  till the moment his grasp relaxed. Just before Ainsworth himself let go,  Mr. Hodgskin lost his hold, exclaiming, Ainsworth, save me! when, exhausted  as he was, with one hand he rescued his friend, and, directly afterwards,  his strength failing, sunk.    This addition of three people to the already loaded cutter, made her cargo  more than was safe, therefore Mr. Williams, who commanded her, very  prudently bore up for the first convenient landing-place, and happily  succeeded in reaching the only part of the beach, between Lomas Bay and  Cape Valentyn, where a boat could land.    The following morning, the weather being more favourable, they crossed  under sail to Freshwater Bay, and thence pulled to Port Famine.    This melancholy disaster was much felt by every one. Ainsworth was a  deserving officer, and highly esteemed. Corkhill was captain of the  forecastle, and had served in the Polar voyages under Sir Edward Parry. On  the Sunday following, the colours were hoisted half-mast high, and the  funeral service was read after morning prayers: for although to recover the  bodies was impossible, their watery grave was before our eyes; and the  performance of this last sad duty was a melancholy satisfaction.     \"Ours are the tears, tho' few, sincerely shed,    When ocean shrouds and sepulchres our dead.\"    A tablet was subsequently erected, on Point St. Anna, to record this fatal  accident.           *       *       *       *       *      {65}    CHAPTER V.

The Beagle's time of absence had expired on the 1st of April, and our  anxiety, more excited by our recent loss, was becoming painful. I detained  the Hope from going upon a service for which she was prepared, in case she  might be required to search for our consort: but on the 6th a strange  whale-boat was descried pulling towards us from the southward, in which we  soon distinguished Lieut. Sholl. His appearance, under such circumstances,  of course raised fears for the Beagle's safety; but, on approaching, his  gratifying shout, \"all's well!\" at once removed anxiety.    Mr. Sholl informed me, that the Beagle had picked up a boat, belonging to  the schooner 'Prince of Saxe Cobourg,' wrecked in Fury Harbour, at the  south entrance of the Barbara Channel; and that she had put into Port  Gallant, whence Captain Stokes had gone with the boats to assist the  Sealers, leaving Lieut. Skyring on board.    The safety of the Beagle being established, I despatched Mr. Graves, in the  Hope, to examine some openings between the Magdalen Channel and the Dos  Hermanos of Bougainville.    Several days earlier than I expected, the Beagle made her appearance, and  Captain Stokes soon gave me the agreeable intelligence of having succeeded  in saving the Prince of Saxe Cobourg's crew. Favoured by the weather,  though delayed by his guide having forgotten the way, Captain Stokes  reached Fury Harbour in two days, and embarked the master and {66} crew of  the wrecked vessel, with all their personal property, and the greater part  of the seal-skins which they had cured. He reached Port Gallant again on  the fourth day; sailed immediately in the Beagle, and two days afterwards  anchored in Port Famine.    The Prince of Saxe Cobourg, belonging to Mr. Weddel (whose voyage towards  the South Pole is so well known), and commanded by Mr. Matthew Brisbane,  who accompanied Weddel on that occasion, sailed from England in the summer  of 1826, on a sealing voyage. At South Shetland she encountered a  continuance of bad weather, was beset by a large body of ice for several  days, and received so much damage as to oblige her to run for the Fuegian  coast, and anchor in Fury Harbour, at the entrance of the Barbara Channel.  There (December 16th, 1826) she was driven on shore by the furious strength  of the williwaws, and wrecked. The crew were, however, enabled to save most  of the provisions and stores, as well as their three boats. Having made  tents, and established themselves on shore, they remained in anxious  expectation of the arrival of some vessel which might relieve them; day  after day however passed, without succour.    Two boats were despatched to look for any sealing vessel that might be in  the vicinity, but after fifteen days' absence they returned unsuccessful.  In this interval one of the crew, who had long been sickly, died; and  another, in carelessly discharging a musket, exploded twenty pounds of  gunpowder, by which he was very much burned. Three of the people being  mutinous, were punished by being sent, each to a different island, with  only a week's provisions.    Soon afterwards another boat was sent away, which reached Hope Harbour, but  found no vessel there. Seven of the people then obtained permission from  the master (who kept up a very proper state of discipline), to take the  largest whale-boat, and go towards the River Negro. Previous to their  departure they drew up articles of agreement for their general conduct, a  breach of which was to be punished by the offender being left upon the  coast, wherever they might happen to {67} be. The boat eventually arrived  safely at the place of her destination, and the crew entered as volunteers  on board of the Buenos Ayrean squadron, at that time engaged in the war  with Brazil.    Again a boat was despatched, directed to go westward through the Strait in  search of vessels. She had only reached as far as Playa Parda, when the  Beagle fell in with her (March 3d, 1827). While passing through the small  channels, before entering the Strait, she met several canoes, with Indians,  who endeavoured to stop her, and shot arrows at the crew; but, happily,  without doing any mischief.    After the last boat's departure, Mr. Brisbane began to build a small  vessel, and, while so employed, was visited by a party of natives, who  conducted themselves very peaceably, and went away. Their visit, however,  gave the shipwrecked people, now much reduced in number,[57] reason to  apprehend the return of a larger body, who might try to possess themselves  of the property which was lying about on the shore; they therefore buried a  great deal, and took means to preserve the rest by making preparations to  repel attack. When Captain Stokes appeared with his two boats, the Sealers  flew to their arms, calling out \"the Indians, the Indians!\" but in a very  few minutes excess of joy succeeded to their sudden alarm.    Captain Stokes found the vessel lying on the rocks, bilged, and an utter  wreck. The master and crew were extremely anxious to get away, he therefore  embarked them, with as much of the property as could be carried, and  succeeded (after another night in the boats, and a long pull of eighty  miles,) in conveying them safely to the Beagle.    The following is an abstract of Captain Stokes's journal of his cruise to  the western entrance of the Strait.    The Beagle sailed from Port Famine on the 15th of January, to explore the  Strait westward of Cape Froward, and to fix particularly the positions of  Cape Pillar, the rock called {68} Westminster Hall, and the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38967"],[0,"The History of Painting in Italy, Vol. 4 (of 6) (#16)"],[1,"in the finest order, with a number of angels of all dimensions,  all full of action; some employed in assisting the flight of the Virgin,  others singing and dancing, and the rest engaged in celebrating the triumph  with applause, songs, torches, and the burning of celestial perfumes. In  all, the countenances beam with mingled beauty, hilarity, and triumph; a  halo of light seems to envelope the whole, so that notwithstanding the  piece is much defaced, it is still calculated to awaken such an enchantment  of the soul, that the spectator almost dreams he is in elysium. These  magnificent works, as it has been observed of the chambers of Raffaello,  were calculated to promote the dignity of his manner, and led the way to  that height of perfection he attained in the difficult art of working in  fresco. To estimate it aright, we ought to approach near, to mark the  decision and audacity as it were of every stroke; the parts, that at a  distance appear so beautiful, yet effected by few lines; and that  colouring, and that harmony which unites so many objects in one, produced,  as it were, in sportful play. The renowned artist survived only four years,  subsequent to the completion of the cupola; without commencing, during the  interval, the painting of the tribune, for which he had pledged himself,  and received part of the remuneration, which was afterwards restored to the  revenues of the cathedral by his heirs. It has been conjectured, that the  conductors of the works must, in some way, have given him offence; since  the artist Soiaro, on being invited to paint at the _Steccata_, objects to  it in the following terms: \"Not wishing to remain at the discretion of so  many different heads; for you know,\" he continues to his friend, \"what was  said to Coreggio in the dome.\" Now this, it would appear, must have  consisted of some expressions derogatory to his talents; probably some  words which one of the artificers is said to have applied to the  diminutiveness of his figures: \"Ci avete fatto un guazzetto di rane.\" \"You  have presented us with a hash of frogs.\" Words from a workman, for which  Coreggio might easily have consoled himself, as they did not express the  opinion of the city of Parma.    He died, however, about four years afterwards, at his native place, before  he had completed his undertaking; and without leaving any portrait of  himself which can be considered genuine. Vasari's editor, at Rome, produces  one of a bald old man, little agreeable to our ideas of Coreggio, who died  at the age of forty. It is taken from a collection of designs by the Padre  Resta, which he entitled, the \"Portable Gallery,\" and which both the  Cavalier Tiraboschi and the Padre della Valle mentioned as having been  lost. Nevertheless it exists in the Ambrosian collection, and contains,  among other designs, one which Resta, in the notes added thereto, declares  to be the family of Coreggio, consisting of the portrait of himself, his  wife, and his sons; altogether forming one female and three male heads,  poor, and wretchedly attired. But it betrays evident marks of its want of  genuineness, and not the least in the description of the family; inasmuch  as Antonio is known to have had one son and three daughters, two of whom  appear to have died at an early age. The portrait remaining at Turin, in  the Vigna della Regina, engraved by the very able Valperga, bears an  inscription, in part obliterated by the cornice. Still I contrived to  decypher the words, _Antonius Corrigius, f_--(that is, _fecit_), one of the  first arguments for not admitting it, as some have done, to be a head of  Coreggio. A further one may be derived from the inscription itself being  written in large letters, and in a space occupying the whole length of the  canvass, a method occasionally adopted to explain the subject of the piece,  but never the name of the artist. There was another portrait sent from  Genoa into England, with an inscription upon the back, indicating it to be  that of Antonio da Coreggio, drawn by Dosso Dossi, which is to be found in  the memoirs of Ratti. I have no sort of ground for asserting such a  signature to have been introduced several years subsequent; a plan which  was, and still is frequently adopted, by an accurate imitation of the  ancient characters; I would merely observe, that there was also a  distinguished painter in miniature, of the name of M. Antonio da Coreggio,  who traversed Italy about the time of Dosso, and whose merits I shall treat  of hereafter. Of the portrait taken of Coreggio, by Gambara, in the  cathedral of Parma, it would here be improper to speak, otherwise than as  an idle popular rumour. In conclusion, therefore, I am inclined to admit  the seeming truth of what is advanced by Vasari, that this noble artist  entertained no idea of transmitting his likeness to posterity, not justly  estimating his own excellence, but adding to his numerous other  accomplishments that of a remarkable modesty, conferring real honour upon  our history.    The latest and most perfect style of Coreggio has been minutely analysed by  the Cavalier Mengs, in the same manner as he examined that of Raffaello and  of Titian. And in this famous triumvirate he accorded to him the second  rank, after Raffaello, observing, that this last depicted more exquisitely  the affections of the soul, though inferior to him in the expression of  external forms. In this, indeed, Coreggio was a true master, having  succeeded by his colouring, and yet more by his chiaroscuro, in introducing  into his pictures an ideal beauty, surpassing that of nature, and at the  same time attracting the admiration of the most learned, by an union of art  and nature in its rarest forms, such as they never before beheld. And such  admiration, and such applauses, were in particular bestowed upon his St.  Jerome, preserved in the academy at Parma. Algarotti declares, that he was  inclined to prefer it to any other of his productions; and to exclaim in  his heart: \"Tu solo mi piaci!\" \"Thou alone pleasest me!\" Annibal Caracci  himself, upon first beholding this picture, as well as a few others from  the same hand, declares, in the letter already cited to his brother  Lodovico, that he would not even exchange them with the St. Cecilia of  Raffaello, which is still to be seen in the city of Bologna. And it may be  truly said, that the same art that had been carried to such a pitch of  sublimity by Michelangiolo; to such an exquisite degree of natural grace  and expression by Raffaello; and from Titian received such inimitable  perfection in its tones of colouring; displayed in Coreggio such an union  of excellences, as in the opinion of Mengs, carried the whole of these to  their highest point of perfection, adding to all their dignity and truth  his own peculiar elegance, and a taste as captivating to the eye as to the  heart of the spectator.    In design he exhausted not all that depth of knowledge, so conspicuous in  Bonarruoti; but it was at once so great and so select, that the Caracci  themselves adopted it for their model. I am aware, that Algarotti  considered him to be somewhat incorrect in the expression of his contours;  while Mengs, on the other hand, defends him very warmly from such a charge.  Truly, there does not appear the same variety in his lines as is to be  found in Raffaello and the ancients, inasmuch as he purposely avoided  angles and rectilinear lines, preserving, as much as lay in his power, an  undulating sweep of outline, sometimes convex and sometimes concave; while  it is maintained, that his grace results, in a great measure, from this  practice: so that Mengs in uncertainty appears at one time to commend, and  at another to excuse him for it. He is lavish of his praises on the design  of his draperies, on whose masses Coreggio bestowed more attention than on  the particular folds; he being the first who succeeded in making drapery a  part of the composition, as well by force of contrast as by its direction;  thus opening a new path which might render it conspicuous in large works.  In particular, his youthful and infantile heads are greatly celebrated; the  faces beaming with so much nature and simplicity, as to enchant, and to  compel us, as it were, to smile as they smile.[22] Each separate figure may  be pronounced original, from the infinite variety of foreshortenings he has  introduced; there is scarcely a single head that is not seen from a point  of view either above or below; not a hand, not a whole figure, whose  attitude is not full of an ease and grace of motion, beyond example. By his  practice of foreshortening figures upon ceilings, which was avoided by  Raffaello, he overcame many difficulties still remaining to be vanquished  after the time of Mantegna, and in this branch of perspective is justly  entitled to the merit of having rendered it complete.      Footnote 22: This is an expression of Annibal Caracci.       Elsewhere he observes: \"This kind of delicacy and purity,       which is rather truth itself than verisimilitude, pleases me       greatly. It is neither artificial nor forced, but quite       natural.\"    His colouring is allowed to correspond beautifully with the grace and  selection of his design, Giulio Romano having been heard to assert that it  was altogether the best he had ever seen; nor was he averse to the Duke of  Mantua giving the preference to Coreggio above himself, when about to make  a presentation of pictures to the emperor Charles V. Equal commendation is  bestowed upon him by Lomazzo, when he pronounces that, among the  colourists, he is to be considered rather as unique than as rare in point  of merit. No artist before him ever bestowed so much attention upon his  canvass, which, after a slight covering of chalk, received his colours,  both in point of quantity and quality, as we have before stated, from a  lavish hand.[23] In the _impasto_, or laying on his colours, he"]]]
