Through his  final examination, however, he did not pass so brilliantly as through  his previous ones; this time he carried off no prize. The cause of this  falling-off is not far to seek; indeed, has already been hinted at.  Frederick's inclination and his successes as a pianist and composer,  and the persuasions of Elsner and other musical friends, could not  but lessen and at last altogether dispel any doubts and misgivings the  parents may at first have harboured. And whilst in consequence of this  change of attitude they became less exacting with their son in the  matter of school-work, the latter, feeling the slackening of the reins,  would more and more follow his natural bent. The final examination was  to him, no doubt, a kind of manumission which freed him from the last  remnant of an oppressive bondage. Henceforth, then, Chopin could,  unhindered by disagreeable tasks or other obstacles, devote his whole  time and strength to the cultivation of his chosen art. First, however,  he spent now, as in the preceding year, some weeks with his friends  in Strzyzewo, and afterwards travelled to Danzig, where he visited  Superintendent von Linde, a brother of the rector of the Warsaw Lyceum.    Chopin was fond of listening to the singing and fiddling of the country  people; and everyone acquainted with the national music of Poland as  well as with the composer's works knows that he is indebted to it  for some of the most piquant rhythmic, melodic, and even harmonic  peculiarities of his style. These longer stays in the country would  offer him better opportunities for the enjoyment and study of this land  of music than the short excursions which he occasionally made with his  father into the neighbourhood of Warsaw. His wonder always was who  could have composed the quaint and beautiful strains of those mazurkas,  polonaises, and krakowiaks, and who had taught these simple men and  women to play and sing so truly in tune. The conditions then existing  in Poland were very favourable to the study of folk-lore of any kind.  Art-music had not yet corrupted folk-music; indeed, it could hardly be  said that civilisation had affected the lower strata of society at  all. Notwithstanding the emancipation of the peasants in 1807, and the  confirmation of this law in 1815--a law which seems to have remained  for a long time and in a great measure a dead letter--the writer of an  anonymous book, published at Boston in 1834, found that the freedom of  the wretched serfs in Russian Poland was much the same as that of their  cattle, they being brought up with as little of human cultivation; nay,  that the Polish peasant, poor in every part of the country, was of all  the living creatures he had met with in this world or seen described  in books, the most wretched. From another publication we learn that the  improvements in public instruction, however much it may have benefited  the upper classes, did not affect the lowest ones: the parish schools  were insufficient, and the village schools not numerous enough. But the  peasants, although steeped in superstition and ignorance, and too much  addicted to brandy-drinking with its consequences--quarrelsomeness and  revengefulness--had not altogether lost the happier features of their  original character--hospitality, patriotism, good-naturedness, and,  above all, cheerfulness and love of song and dance. It has been said  that a simple Slavonic peasant can be enticed by his national songs  from one end of the world to the other. The delight which the Slavonic  nations take in dancing seems to be equally great. No other nation,  it has been asserted, can compare with them in ardent devotion to  this amusement. Moreover, it is noteworthy that song and dance were in  Poland--as they were of course originally everywhere--intimately  united. Heine gives a pretty description of the character of the Polish  peasant:--       It cannot be denied [he writes] that the Polish peasant has     often more head and heart than the German peasant in some     districts. Not infrequently did I find in the meanest Pole     that original wit (not Gemuthswitz, humour) which on every     occasion bubbles forth with wonderful iridescence, and that     dreamy sentimental trait, that brilliant flashing of an     Ossianic feeling for nature whose sudden outbreaks on     passionate occasions are as involuntary as the rising of the     blood into the face.    The student of human nature and its reflex in art will not call these  remarks a digression; at least, not one deserving of censure.    We may suppose that Chopin, after his return to Warsaw and during the  following winter, and the spring and summer of 1828, continued his  studies with undiminished and, had this been possible, with redoubled  ardour. Some of his compositions that came into existence at this time  were published after his death by his friend Julius Fontana, who was a  daily visitor at his parents' house. We have a Polonaise (D minor) and a  Nocturne (E minor) of 1827, and another Polonaise (B flat) and the Rondo  for two pianos of 1828. The Sonata, Op. 4, and La ci darem la mano,  varie for pianoforte, with orchestral accompaniments, belong also to  this time. The Trio (Op. 8), although not finished till 1829, was begun  and considerably advanced in 1828. Several of the above compositions are  referred to in a letter written by him on September 9, 1828, to one  of his most intimate friends, Titus Woyciechowski. The Rondo in C had  originally a different form and was recast by him for two pianos at  Strzyzewo, where he passed the whole summer of 1828. He tried it  with Ernemann, a musician living in Warsaw, at the warehouse of the  pianoforte-manufacturer Buchholtz, and was pretty well pleased with his  work.       We intend to play it some day at the Ressource. As to my new     compositions, I have nothing to show except the as yet     unfinished Trio (G minor), which I began after your     departure. The first Allegro I have already tried with     accompaniment. It appears to me that this trio will have the     same fate as my sonata and the variations. Both works are now     in Vienna; the first I have, as a pupil of Elsner's,     dedicated to him, and on the second I have placed (perhaps     too boldly) your name. I followed in this the impulse of my     heart and you will not take it unkindly.    The opportunities which Warsaw offered being considered insufficient for  the completion of his artistic education, ways and means were discussed  as to how his wants could be best provided for. The upshot of the  discussions was the project of excursions to Berlin and Vienna. As,  however, this plan was not realised till the autumn of 1828, and  no noteworthy incidents or interesting particulars concerning the  intervening period of his life have become known, I shall utilise this  break in the narrative by trying my hand at a slight sketch of that  terra incognita, the history of music in Poland, more particularly the  history of the musical life in Warsaw, shortly before and in Chopin's  time. I am induced to undertake this task by the consideration that a  knowledge of the means of culture within the reach of Chopin during his  residence in the Polish capital is indispensable if we wish to form a  clear and complete idea of the artist's development, and that such  a knowledge will at the same time help us to understand better the  contents of some of the subsequent portions of this work. Before,  however, I begin a new chapter and with it the above-mentioned sketch, I  should like to advert to a few other matters.    The reader may perhaps already have asked the question--What was Chopin  like in his outward appearance? As I have seen a daguerreotype from a  picture painted when he was seventeen, I can give some sort of answer to  this question. Chopin's face was clearly and finely cut, especially  the nose with its wide nostrils; the forehead was high, the eyebrows  delicate, the lips thin, and the lower one somewhat protruding. For  those who know A. Bovy's medallion I may add that the early portrait is  very like it; only, in the latter, the line formed by the lower jawbone  that runs from the chin towards the ear is more rounded, and the whole  has a more youthful appearance. As to the expression, it is not only  meditative but even melancholy. This last point leads me naturally to  another question. The delicate build of Chopin's body, his early death  preceded by many years of ill-health, and the character of his music,  have led people into the belief that from childhood he was always sickly  in body, and for the most part also melancholy in disposition. But as  the poverty and melancholy, so also disappears on closer investigation  the sickliness of the child and youth. To jump, however, from this to  the other extreme, and assert that he enjoyed vigorous health, would be  as great a mistake. Karasowski, in his eagerness to controvert Liszt,  although not going quite this length, nevertheless overshoots the mark.  Besides it is a misrepresentation of Liszt not to say that the passage  excerpted from his book, and condemned as not being in accordance with  the facts of the case, is a quotation from G. Sand's novel Lucrezia  Floriani (of which more will be said by-and-by), in which the authoress  is supposed, although this was denied by her, to have portrayed Chopin.  Liszt is a poet, not a chronicler; he must be read as such, and not  be taken au pied de la lettre. However, even Karasowski, in whom one  notices a perhaps unconscious anxiety to keep out of sight anything  which might throw doubt on the health and strength of his hero, is  obliged to admit that Chopin was \"delicate,\" although he hastens to  add, \"but nevertheless healthy and pretty strong.\" It seems to me  that Karasowski makes too much of the statement of a friend of  Chopin's--namely, that the latter was, up to manhood, only"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4974"],[0,"Australia Twice Traversed (#16)"],[1,"the plain, it was more than probable they would work back through the  scrub to it in the night. The following morning not a horse was to be  found! Robinson and I went in search of them, and found they had split  into several mobs. I only got three, and at night Robinson returned  with only six, the remainder had been missed in the dense scrubs. The  thermometer stood at 95 degrees in the shade, and there was a warm  wind blowing. Robinson had a fine day's work, as he had to walk back  to the camp on the plain for the horses he got. In the afternoon I  attempted the high bluff immediately overlooking the camp. I had a bit  of cliff-climbing, and reached the summit of one hill of some  elevation, 1300 feet, and then found that a vast chasm, or ravine,  separated me from the main mountain chain. It would be dark before I  could--if I could--reach the summit, and then I should get no view, so  I returned to the camp. The height was considerable, as mountains in  this part of the world go, as it towered above the hill I was upon,  and was 500 or 600 feet higher. These mountains appear to be composed  of a kind of conglomerate granite; very little timber existed upon  them, but they were splendidly supplied with high, strong, coarse  spinifex. I slipped down a gully, fell into a hideous bunch of this  horrid stuff, and got pricked from head to foot; the spiny points  breaking off in my clothes and flesh caused me great annoyance and  pain for many days after. Many beautiful flowers grew on the  hillsides, in gullies and ravines; of these I collected several. We  secured what horses we had, for the night, which was warm and sultry.  In the morning Robinson and I rode after the still missing ones; at  the plain camp we found all except one, and by the time we returned it  was night.    Not hobbling the horses in general, we had some difficulty in finding  a pair of hobbles for each, and not being able to do so, I left one in  the mob without. This base reptile surreptitiously crawled away in the  night by himself. As our camp was the most wretched dog-hole it was  possible for a man to get into, in the midst of dense mallee, triodia,  and large stones, I determined to escape from it, before looking for  the now two missing animals. The water was completely exhausted. We  moved away south-westerly for about three miles, to the creek I had  scratched in some days ago; now we had to dig a big hole with a  shovel, and with a good deal of labour we obtained a sufficient supply  for a few days.

Having fixed our camp at a new place, in the afternoon of the 17th  September, Robinson and I again went to look after the horses. At  three miles above the camp we found some water; soon after we got the  tracks of one horse and saw that he had been about there for a day or  two, as the tracks were that age. We made a sweep out round some  hills, found the tracks again, much fresher, and came upon the horse  about seven miles from the camp. The other horse was left for  to-morrow. Thermometer 96 degrees, sky overcast, rain imminent.    During the night of the 18th of September a few heat-drops of rain  fell. I sent Robinson away to the plain camp, feeling sure he would  find the rover there. A hot wind blew all day, the sand was flying  about in all directions. Robinson got the horse at last at the plain,  and I took special care to find a pair of hobbles for him for this  night at all events. The flies were an intolerable nuisance, not that  they were extraordinarily numerous, but so insufferably pertinacious.  I think the tropic fly of Australia the most abominable insect of its  kind. From the summit of the hill I ascended on Sunday, I found the  line of mountains still ran on to the west, the furthest hills  appeared fifty miles away. As they extend so far, and are the  principal features in sight, I shall follow them, in hopes of meeting  some creek, or river, that may carry me on to the west. It is a  remarkable fact that such high hills as I have been following should  send out no creek whose course extends farther than ten or twelve  miles. I could trace the creek I am now on by its timber for only a  few miles, its course appearing south of west. The country in its  immediate neighbourhood is open, and timbered with fine casuarina  trees; the grass is dry and long, and the triodia approaches to within  a quarter of a mile of it. The line of hills I previously mentioned as  running along to the south of us, we had now run out. I named them  Gardiner's Range, after a friend of Mr. Carmichael's. There is,  however, one small isolated hill, the furthest outpost of that line,  some three miles away to the south-west; the creek may probably take a  bend down towards it. I called it Mount Solitary. This creek is rather  well timbered, the gum-trees look fresh and young, and there is some  green herbage in places, though the surface water has all disappeared.    There was so little water at the camp tank, we had to send the horses  up the creek three miles to water, and on their return I was not sorry  to be moving again, for our stay at these two last camps had been  compulsory, and the anxiety, trouble, and annoyance we had, left no  very agreeable reminiscences of the locality in our minds.    We travelled along the creek all day, cutting off the bends, but  without seeing any signs of water: towards evening we set to work to  try if we could get any by digging. In about four feet, water began to  drain in, but, the sand being so loose, we had to remove an enormous  quantity to enable a horse to drink. Some of the horses would not go  into it, and had to be watered with a canvas bucket. The supply seemed  good, but it only drained in from the sides. Every time a horse drank  we had to clear out the sand for the next; it therefore took until  late before all were satisfied. The country was still open, and  timbered with fine black oak, or what is so called in Australia. It is  a species of casuarina, of the same family but distinct from the  beautiful desert oak. Triodia reigned supreme within half a mile. At  this camp the old grass had been burnt, and fresh young green shoots  appeared in its place; this was very good for the horses. A few drops  of rain fell; distant rumblings of thunder and flashes of lightning  now cooled the air. While we were at breakfast the next morning, a  thunderstorm came up to us from the west, then suddenly turned away,  only just sprinkling us, though we could see the rain falling heavily  a few yards to the south. We packed up and went off, hoping to find a  better watered region at the hills westwards. There was an  extraordinary mount a little to the west of north from us; it looked  something like a church; it was over twenty miles away: I called it  Mount Peculiar. Leaving the creek on our left, to run itself out into  some lonely flat or dismal swamp, known only to the wretched  inhabitants of this desolate region--over which there seems to brood  an unutterable stillness and a dread repose--we struck into sandhill  country, rather open, covered with the triodia or spinifex, and  timbered with the casuarina or black oak trees. We had scarcely gone  two miles when our old thunderstorm came upon us--it had evidently  missed us at first, and had now come to look for us--and it rained  heavily. The country was so sandy and porous that no water remained on  the surface. We travelled on and the storm travelled with us--the  ground sucking up every drop that fell. Continuing our course, which  was north 67 degrees west, we travelled twenty-five miles. At this  distance we came in sight of the mountains I was steering for, but  they were too distant to reach before night, so, turning a little  northward to the foot of a low, bare, white granite hill, I hoped to  find a creek, or at least some ledges in the rocks, where we might get  some water. Not a drop was to be found. Though we had been travelling  in the rain all day and accomplished thirty miles, we were obliged to  camp without water at last. There was good feed for the horses, and,  as it was still raining, they could not be very greatly in want of  water. We fixed up our tent and retired for the night, the wind  blowing furiously, as might reasonably be expected, for it was the eve  of the vernal equinox, and this I supposed was our share of"]]]
