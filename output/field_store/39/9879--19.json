Unless such women  are beautiful and young and charming they are treated badly; and this  is often true in spite of all their natural attractiveness, for they  seem to court ill usage as if they were saying frankly:    \"Come, take us!

But, none the less, in our  sorrow there will be sweetness, and even in our abasement we shall feel  a sort of triumph.\"    In history there is one woman who stands out conspicuously as a type of  her melancholy sisterhood, one whose life was full of disappointment  even when she was most successful, and of indignity even when she was  most sought after and admired. This woman was Adrienne Lecouvreur,  famous in the annals of the stage, and still more famous in the annals  of unrequited--or, at any rate, unhappy--love.    Her story is linked with that of a man no less remarkable than herself,  a hero of chivalry, a marvel of courage, of fascination, and of  irresponsibility.    Adrienne Lecouvreur--her name was originally Couvreur--was born toward  the end of the seventeenth century in the little French village of  Damery, not far from Rheims, where her aunt was a laundress and her  father a hatter in a small way. Of her mother, who died in childbirth,  we know nothing; but her father was a man of gloomy and ungovernable  temper, breaking out into violent fits of passion, in one of which,  long afterward, he died, raving and yelling like a maniac.    Adrienne was brought up at the wash-tub, and became accustomed to a  wandering life, in which she went from one town to another. What she  had inherited from her mother is, of course, not known; but she had all  her father's strangely pessimistic temper, softened only by the fact  that she was a girl. From her earliest years she was unhappy; yet her  unhappiness was largely of her own choosing. Other girls of her own  station met life cheerfully, worked away from dawn till dusk, and then  had their moments of amusement, and even jollity, with their  companions, after the fashion of all children. But Adrienne Lecouvreur  was unhappy because she chose to be. It was not the wash-tub that made  her so, for she had been born to it; nor was it the half-mad outbreaks  of her father, because to her, at least, he was not unkind. Her  discontent sprang from her excessive sensibility.    Indeed, for a peasant child she had reason to think herself far more  fortunate than her associates. Her intelligence was great. Ambition was  awakened in her before she was ten years of age, when she began to  learn and to recite poems--learning them, as has been said, \"between  the wash-tub and the ironing-board,\" and reciting them to the  admiration of older and wiser people than she. Even at ten she was a  very beautiful child, with great lambent eyes, an exquisite complexion,  and a lovely form, while she had the further gift of a voice that  thrilled the listener and, when she chose, brought tears to every eye.  She was, indeed, a natural elocutionist, knowing by instinct all those  modulations of tone and varied cadences which go to the hearer's heart.    It was very like Adrienne Lecouvreur to memorize only such poems as  were mournful, just as in after life she could win success upon the  stage only in tragic parts. She would repeat with a sort of ecstasy the  pathetic poems that were then admired; and she was soon able to give up  her menial work, because many people asked her to their houses so that  they could listen to the divinely beautiful voice charged with the  emotion which was always at her command.    When she was thirteen her father moved to Paris, where she was placed  at school--a very humble school in a very humble quarter of the city.  Yet even there her genius showed itself at that early age. A number of  children and young people, probably influenced by Adrienne, formed  themselves into a theatrical company from the pure love of acting. A  friendly grocer let them have an empty store-room for their  performances, and in this store-room Adrienne Lecouvreur first acted in  a tragedy by Corneille, assuming the part of leading woman.    Her genius for the stage was like the genius of Napoleon for war. She  had had no teaching. She had never been inside of any theater; and yet  she delivered the magnificent lines with all the power and fire and  effectiveness of a most accomplished actress. People thronged to see  her and to feel the tempest of emotion which shook her as she sustained  her part, which for the moment was as real to her as life itself.    At first only the people of the neighborhood knew anything about these  amateur performances; but presently a lady of rank, one Mme. du Gue,  came out of curiosity and was fascinated by the little actress. Mme. du  Gue offered the spacious courtyard of her own house, and fitted it with  some of the appurtenances of a theater. From that moment the fame of  Adrienne spread throughout all Paris. The courtyard was crowded by  gentlemen and ladies, by people of distinction from the court, and at  last even by actors and actresses from the Comedie Franchise.    It is, in fact, a remarkable tribute to Adrienne that in her thirteenth  year she excited so much jealousy among the actors of the Comedie that  they evoked the law against her. Theaters required a royal license, and  of course poor little Adrienne's company had none. Hence legal  proceedings were begun, and the most famous actresses in Paris talked  of having these clever children imprisoned! Upon this the company  sought the precincts of the Temple, where no legal warrant could be  served without the express order of the king himself.    There for a time the performances still went on. Finally, as the other  children were not geniuses, but merely boys and girls in search of fun,  the little company broke up. Its success, however, had determined for  ever the career of Adrienne. With her beautiful face, her lithe and  exquisite figure, her golden voice, and her instinctive art, it was  plain enough that her future lay upon the stage; and so at fourteen or  fifteen she began where most actresses leave off--accomplished and  attractive, and having had a practical training in her profession.    Diderot, in that same century, observed that the truest actor is one  who does not feel his part at all, but produces his effects by  intellectual effort and intelligent observation. Behind the figure on  the stage, torn with passion or rollicking with mirth, there must  always be the cool and unemotional mind which directs and governs and  controls. This same theory was both held and practised by the late  Benoit Constant Coquelin. To some extent it was the theory of Garrick  and Fechter and Edwin Booth; though it was rejected by the two Keans,  and by Edwin Forrest, who entered so throughly into the character which  he assumed, and who let loose such tremendous bursts of passion that  other actors dreaded to support him on the stage in such parts as  Spartacus and Metamora.    It is needless to say that a girl like Adrienne Lecouvreur flung  herself with all the intensity of her nature into every role she  played. This was the greatest secret of her success; for, with her,  nature rose superior to art. On the other hand, it fixed her dramatic  limitations, for it barred her out of comedy. Her melancholy, morbid  disposition was in the fullest sympathy with tragic heroines; but she  failed when she tried to represent the lighter moods and the merry  moments of those who welcome mirth. She could counterfeit despair, and  unforced tears would fill her eyes; but she could not laugh and romp  and simulate a gaiety that was never hers.    Adrienne would have been delighted to act at one of the theaters in  Paris; but they were closed to her through jealousy. She went into the  provinces, in the eastern part of France, and for ten years she was a  leading lady there in many companies and in many towns. As she  blossomed into womanhood there came into her life the love which was to  be at once a source of the most profound interest and of the most  intense agony.    It is odd that all her professional success never gave her any  happiness. The life of the actress who traveled from town to town, the  crude and coarse experiences which she had to undergo, the disorder and  the unsettled mode of living, all produced in her a profound disgust.  She was of too exquisite a fiber to live in such a way, especially in a  century when the refinements of existence were for the very few.    She speaks herself of \"obligatory amusements, the insistence of men,  and of love affairs.\" Yet how could such a woman as Adrienne Lecouvreur  keep herself from love affairs? The motion of the stage and its mimic  griefs satisfied her only while she was actually upon the boards. Love  offered her an emotional excitement that endured and that was always  changing. It was \"the profoundest instinct of her being\"; and she once  wrote: \"What could one do in the world without loving?\"    Still, through these ten years she seems to have loved only that she  might be unhappy. There was a strange twist in her mind. Men who were  honorable and who loved her with sincerity she treated very badly. Men  who were indifferent or ungrateful or actually base she seemed to  choose by a sort of perverse instinct. Perhaps the explanation of it is  that during those ten years, though she had many lovers, she never  really loved. She sought excitement, passion, and after that the  mournfulness which comes when passion dies. Thus, one man after another  came into her life--some of them promising marriage--and she bore two  children, whose fathers were unknown, or at least uncertain.

In many small  things they do yield and they do suffer; yet it is not in yielding and  in suffering that they find their deepest joy.    There are some, however, who seem to have been born with an abnormal  capacity for enduring hardship and mental anguish; so that by a sort  of contradiction they find their happiness in sorrow. Such women are  endowed with a remarkable degree of sensibility. They feel intensely. In  moments of grief and disappointment, and even of despair, there steals  over them a sort of melancholy pleasure. It is as if they loved dim  lights and mournful music and scenes full of sad suggestion.    If everything goes well with them, they are unwilling to believe that  such good fortune will last. If anything goes wrong with them, they are  sure that this is only the beginning of something even worse. The music  of their lives is written in a minor key.    Now, for such women as these, the world at large has very little  charity. It speaks slightingly of them as \"agonizers.\" It believes that  they are \"fond of making scenes.\" It regards as an affectation something  that is really instinctive and inevitable. Unless such women are  beautiful and young and charming they are treated badly; and this is  often true in spite of all their natural attractiveness, for they seem  to court ill usage as if they were saying frankly:    \"Come, take us!
