The  Christian chiefs on this occasion had not so much sagacity, for they  began a violent dispute among themselves for the possession of a city  which was still unconquered. There being already a Prince of Antioch  and a Prince of Tripoli, twenty claimants started for the principality  of Damascus, and a grand council of the leaders was held to determine  the individual on whom the honour should devolve. Many valuable days  were wasted in this discussion, the enemy in the mean while gaining  strength from their inactivity. It was at length, after a stormy  deliberation, agreed that Count Robert of Flanders, who had twice  visited the Holy Land, should be invested with the dignity. The other  claimants refused to recognise him, or to co-operate in the siege,  until a more equitable arrangement had been made. Suspicion filled the  camp; the most sinister rumours of intrigues and treachery were set  afloat; and the discontented candidates withdrew at last to the other  side of the city, and commenced operations on their own account,  without a probability of success. They were soon joined by the rest of  the army. The consequence was that the weakest side of the city, and  that on which they had already made considerable progress in the work  of demolition, was left uncovered. The enemy was prompt to profit by  the mistake, and received an abundant supply of provisions, and  refortified the walls, before the crusaders came to their senses again.  When this desirable event happened, it was too late. Saph Eddin, the  powerful Emir of Mousoul, was in the neighbourhood, at the head of a  large army, advancing by forced marches to the relief of the city. The  siege was abruptly abandoned, and the foolish crusaders returned to  Jerusalem, having done nothing to weaken the enemy, but every thing to  weaken themselves.    The freshness of enthusiasm had now completely subsided;--even the  meanest soldiers were sick at heart. Conrad, from whose fierce zeal at  the outset so much might have been expected, was wearied with reverses,  and returned to Europe with the poor remnant of his host.  Louis  lingered a short time longer, for very shame, but the pressing  solicitations of his minister Suger induced him to return to France.  Thus ended the second Crusade. Its history is but a chronicle of  defeats. It left the kingdom of Jerusalem in a worse state than when it  quitted Europe, and gained nothing but disgrace for its leaders and  discouragement for all concerned.    St. Bernard, who had prophesied a result so different, fell after this  into some disrepute, and experienced, like many other prophets, the  fate of being without honour in his own country. What made the matter  worse, he could not obtain it in any other. Still, however, there were  not wanting zealous advocates to stand forward in his behalf, and stem  the tide of incredulity, which, unopposed, would have carried away his  reputation. The Bishop of Freysinghen declared that prophets were not  always able to prophesy, and that the vices of the crusaders drew down  the wrath of Heaven upon them. But the most ingenious excuse ever made  for St. Bernard is to be found in his life by Geoffroi de Clairvaux,  where he pertinaciously insists that the Crusade was not unfortunate.  St. Bernard, he says, had prophesied a happy result, and that result  could not be considered other than happy which had peopled heaven with  so glorious an army of martyrs. Geoffroi was a cunning pleader, and, no  doubt, convinced a few of the zealous; but plain people, who were not  wanting even in those days, retained their own opinion, or, what  amounts to the same thing, \"were convinced against their will.\"    We now come to the consideration of the third Crusade, and of the  causes which rendered it necessary. The epidemic frenzy, which had been  cooling ever since the issue of the first expedition, was now extinct,  or very nearly so, and the nations of Europe looked with cold  indifference upon the armaments of their princes. But chivalry had  flourished in its natural element of war, and was now in all its glory.  It continued to supply armies for the Holy Land when the popular ranks  refused to deliver up their able-bodied swarms. Poetry, which, more  than religion, inspired the third Crusade, was then but \"caviare to the  million,\" who had other matters, of sterner import, to claim all their  attention. But the knights and their retainers listened with delight to  the martial and amatory strains of the minstrels, minnesangers,  trouveres, and troubadours, and burned to win favour in ladies' eyes by  showing prowess in Holy Land. The third was truly the romantic era of  the Crusades. Men fought then, not so much for the sepulchre of Jesus,  and the maintenance of a Christian kingdom in the East, as to gain  glory for themselves in the best, and almost only field, where glory  could be obtained. They fought, not as zealots, but as soldiers; not  for religion, but for honour; not for the crown of martyrdom, but for  the favour of the lovely.    It is not necessary to enter into a detail of the events by which  Saladin attained the sovereignty of the East, or how, after a  succession of engagements, he planted the Moslem banner once more upon  the battlements of Jerusalem. The Christian knights and population,  including the grand orders of St. John, the Hospitallers, and the  Templars, were sunk in an abyss of vice, and torn by unworthy  jealousies and dissensions, were unable to resist the well-trained  armies which the wise and mighty Saladin brought forward to crush them.  But the news of their fall created a painful sensation among the  chivalry of Europe, whose noblest members were linked to the dwellers  in Palestine by many ties, both of blood and friendship. The news of  the great battle of Tiberias, in which Saladin defeated the Christian  host with terrible slaughter, arrived first in Europe, and was followed  in quick succession by that of the capture of Jerusalem, Antioch,  Tripoli, and other cities. Dismay seized upon the clergy. The Pope  (Urban III.) was so affected by the news that he pined away for grief,  and was scarcely seen to smile again, until he sank into the sleep of  death. [James of Vitry--William de Nangis.] His successor, Gregory  VIII. felt the loss as acutely, but had better strength to bear it, and  instructed all the clergy of the Christian world to stir up the people  to arms for the recovery of the Holy Sepulchre. William, Archbishop of  Tyre, a humble follower in the path of Peter the Hermit, left Palestine  to preach to the Kings of Europe the miseries he had witnessed, and to  incite them to the rescue. The renowned Frederick Barbarossa, the  Emperor of Germany, speedily collected an army, and passing over into  Syria with less delay than had ever before awaited a crusading force,  defeated the Saracens, and took possession of the city of Iconium. He  was unfortunately cut off in the middle of his successful career, by  imprudently bathing in the Cydnus [The desire of comparing two great  men has tempted many writers to drown Frederick in the river Cydnus, in  which Alexander so imprudently bathed (Q. Curt. lib. iii. c. 4, 5.):  but, from the march of the Emperor, I rather judge that his Saleph is  the Calycadnus, a stream of less fame, but of a longer course.--Gibbon]  while he was overheated, and the Duke of Suabia took the command of the  expedition. The latter did not prove so able a general, and met with  nothing but reverses, although he was enabled to maintain a footing at  Antioch until assistance arrived from Europe.    Henry II. of England and Philip Augustus of France, at the head of  their chivalry, supported the Crusade with all their influence, until  wars and dissensions nearer home estranged them from it for a time.  The two kings met at Gisors in Normandy in the month of January 1188,  accompanied by a brilliant train of knights and warriors. William of  Tyre was present, and expounded the cause of the Cross with  considerable eloquence, and the whole assembly bound themselves by oath  to proceed to Jerusalem. It was agreed at the same time that a tax,  called Saladin's tithe, and consisting of the tenth part of all  possessions, whether landed or personal, should be enforced over  Christendom, upon every one who was either unable or unwilling to  assume the Cross. The lord of every feof, whether lay or  ecclesiastical, was charged to raise the tithe within his own  jurisdiction; and any one who refused to pay his quota, became by that  act the bondsman and absolute property of his lord. At the same time  the greatest indulgence was shown to those who assumed the Cross; no  man was at liberty to stay them by process of any kind, whether for  debt, or robbery, or murder. The King of France, at the breaking up of  the conference, summoned a parliament at Paris, where these resolutions  were solemnly confirmed, while Henry II. did the same for his Norman  possessions at Rouen, and for England at Geddington, in  Northamptonshire. To use the words of an ancient chronicler, [Stowe.]  \"he held a parliament about the voyage into the Holy Land, and troubled  the whole land with the paying of tithes towards it.\"    But it was not England only that was \"troubled\" by the tax. The people  of France also looked upon it with no pleasant feelings, and appear  from that time forth to have changed their indifference for the Crusade  into aversion. Even the clergy, who were exceedingly willing that other  people should contribute half, or even all their goods in furtherance  of their favourite scheme, were not at all anxious to contribute a  single sous themselves.

That's what we call the dam  bursting,\" finished Uncle Daniel.    All this was very interesting to Bert, who could not help being  frightened at the situation.    The boys told Uncle Daniel how the tank in the barn had overflowed, and  he said they had done good work to prevent any damage.    \"Oh, Uncle Daniel!\" exclaimed Freddie, just then running up from the  cellar. \"Come and see my ark! It's most done, and I'm going to put all  the animals and things in it to save them from the flood.\"    \"An ark!\" exclaimed his uncle, laughing. \"Well, you're a sensible  little fellow to build an ark to-day, Freddie, for we will surely need  one if this keeps up,\" and away they went to examine the raft Freddie  had actually nailed together in the cellar.    That was an awful night in Meadow Brook, and few people went to bed,  staying up instead to watch the danger of the flood. The men took turns  walking along the pond bank all night long, and their low call each  hour seemed to strike terror in the hearts of those who were in danger.    The men carried lanterns, and the little specks of light were all that  could be seen through the darkness.    Mrs. Burns had refused to leave her home.    \"I will stay as long as I can,\" she told Uncle Daniel. \"I have lived  here many a year, and that dam has not broken yet, so I'm not going to  give up hope now!\"    \"But you could hardly get out in time should it break,\" insisted Uncle  Daniel, \"and you know we have plenty of room and you are welcome with  us.\"    Still she insisted on staying, and each hour when the watchman would  call from the pond bank, just like they used to do in old war-times:  \"Two o'clock-and--all is--well!\" Mrs. Burns would look up and say,  \"Dear Lord, I thank Thee!\"    Peter, of course, was out with the men. He could not move his barns and  chicken house, but he had taken his cow and horse to places of safety.    There were other families along the road in danger as well as the  Burnses, but they were not so near the dam, and would get some warning  to escape before the flood could reach them should the dam burst.    How the water roared! And how awfully dark it was! Would morning ever  come?    \"Four o'clock--the water rises!\" shouted the men from the bank.    \"Here, Mary!\" called Peter Burns at the door of their little home, \"you  put your shawl on and run up the road as fast as you can! Don't wait to  take anything, but go!\"    \"Oh, my babies' pictures!\" she cried. \"My dear babies! I must have  them.\"    The poor frightened little woman rushed about the house looking for the  much-prized pictures of her babies that were in heaven.    \"It's a good thing they all have a safe home to-night,\" she thought,  \"for their mother could not give them safety if they were here.\"    \"Come, Mary!\" called Peter, outside. \"That dam is swaying like a  tree-top, and it will go over any minute.\" With one last look at the  little home Mrs. Burns went out and closed the door.    Outside there were people from all along the road. Some driven out of  their homes in alarm, others having turned out to help their neighbors.    The watchmen had left the bank. A torrent from the dam would surely  wash that away, and brave as the men were they could not watch the  flood any longer.    \"Get past the willows quick!\" called the men. \"Let everybody who is not  needed hurry up the road!\"    Mr. Mason, Mr. Hopkins, Uncle Daniel, and John, besides Peter Burns,  were the men most active in the life-saving work. There were not many  boats to be had, but what there were had been brought inland early in  the day, for otherwise they would have been washed away long before  down the stream into the river.    \"What's that?\" called Uncle Daniel, as there was a heavy crash over  near the gates.    Then everybody listened breathless.    It was just coming daylight, and the first streak of dawn saw the end  of the awful rain.    Not one man in the crowd dared to run up that pond bank and look over  the gates!    \"It's pretty strong!\" said the watchman. \"I expected to hear it crash  an hour ago!\"    There was another crash!    \"There she goes!\" said Mr. Burns, and then nobody spoke.        CHAPTER XVII    A TOWN AFLOAT    \"Is she going?\" asked Uncle Daniel at last, after a wait of several  minutes.    Daylight was there now; and was ever dawn more welcome in Meadow Brook!    \"I'll go up to the pipes,\" volunteered John. \"And I can see from there.\"    Now, the pipes were great water conduits, the immense black iron kind  that are used for carrying water into cities from reservoirs. They were  situated quite a way from the dam, but as it was daylight John could  see the gates as he stood on the pipes that crossed above the pond.    Usually boys could walk across these pipes in safety, as they were far  above the water, but the flood had raised the stream so that the water  just reached the pipes, and John had to be careful.    \"What's that?\" he said, as he looked down the raging stream.    \"Something lies across the dam!\" he shouted to the anxious listeners.    This was enough. In another minute every man was on the pond bank.    \"The big elm!\" they shouted. \"It has saved the dam!\"    What a wonderful thing had happened! The giant elm tree that for so  many, many years had stood on the edge of the stream, was in this great  flood washed away, and as it crossed the dam it broke the force of the  torrent, really making another waterfall.    \"It is safe now!\" exclaimed Uncle Daniel in surprise. \"It was the tree  we heard crash against the bank. The storm is broken at last, and that  tree will hold where it is stuck until the force goes down. Then we can  open the  gates.\"    To think that the houses were safe again! That poor Mrs. Burns could  come back to the old mill home once more!    \"We must never have this risk again,\" said Mr. Mason to Uncle Daniel.  \"When the water goes down we will open the gates, then the next dry  spell that comes when there is little water in the pond we will break  that dam and let the water run through in a stream. If the mill people  want water power they will have to get it some place where it will not  endanger lives.\"    Uncle Daniel agreed with Mr. Mason, and as they were both town  officials, it was quite likely what they said would be done in Meadow  Brook.    \"Hey, Bert and Harry!\" called Tom Mason, as he and Jack Hopkins ran  past the Bobbsey place on their way to see the dam. \"Come on down and  see the flood.\"    The boys did not wait for breakfast, but with a buttered roll in hand  Harry and Bert joined the others and hurried off to the flood.    \"Did the dam burst?\" was the first question everybody asked along the  way, and when told how the elm tree had saved it the people were  greatly astonished.    \"Look at this,\" called Tom, as they came to a turn in the road where  the pond ran level with the fields. That was where it was only stream,  and no embankment had been built around it.    \"Look!\" exclaimed Jack; \"the water has come up clear across the road,  and we can only pass by walking on the high board fence.\"    \"Or get a boat,\" said Tom. \"Let's go back to the turn and see if  there's a boat tied anywhere.\"    \"Here's Herolds',\" called Harry, as they found the pretty little  rowboat, used for pleasure by the summer cottagers, tied up to a tree.    \"We'll just borrow that,\" said Jack, and then the four boys lifted the  boat to that part of the road where the water ran.    \"All get in, and I'll push off,\" said Harry, who had hip-boots on. The  other three climbed in, then Harry gave a good push and scrambled over  the edge himself.    \"Think of rowing a boat in the middle of a street,\" said Bert. \"That's  the way they do in Naples,\" he added, \"but I never expected to see such  a thing in Meadow Brook.\"    The boys pushed along quite easily, as the water was deep enough to use  oars in, and soon they had rounded the curve of the road and were in  sight of the people looking at the dam.    \"What an immense tree!\" exclaimed Bert, as they left their boat and  mounted the bank.    \"That's what saved the dam!\" said Harry. \"Now Mrs. Burns can come back  home again.\"    \"But look there!\" called Tom. \"There goes Peter Burns' chicken house.\"    Sure enough, the henhouse had left its foundation and now toppled over  into the stream.    It had been built below the falls, near the Burns house, and Peter had  some valuable ducks and chickens in it.    \"The chickens!\" called Jack, as they ran along. \"Get the boat, Harry,  and we can save some.\"    The boys were dashing out now right in the stream, Jack and Tom being  good oarsmen.    But the poor chickens! What an awful noise they made, as they tried to  keep on the dry side of the floating house!    The ducks, of course, didn't mind it, but they added their queer  quacking to the noise.    \"We can never catch any of the chickens,\" said Harry. \"We ought to have  a rope and pull the house in.\"    \"A rope,\" called Tom to the crowd on the shore. \"Throw us a rope!\"    Someone ran off and got one, and it was quickly thrown out to the boys  in the boat.    \"Push up closer,\" Tom told Harry and Bert, who had the oars now. Tom  made a big loop on the rope and threw it toward the house. But it only  landed over a chicken, and caused the frightened fowl to fly high up in  the air and rest in a tree on the bank.    \"Good!\" cried the people on the edge. \"One is safe, anyhow!\"    Tom threw the rope again. This time it caught on a corner of the  henhouse, and as he pulled the knot tight they had the floating house  secure.    \"Hurrah! hurrah!\" shouted the people.    By this time Mr. Mason and Uncle Daniel had reached the spot in their  boat.    \"Don't pull too hard!\" called the men to the boys. \"You'll upset your  boat.\"    \"Throw the line to us,\" added Uncle Daniel,    This the boys did, and as it was a long stretch of rope the men were  able to"]]]
