Nothing else had he, but of all men  in Egypt he was the best instrument Nahoum could have chosen; and of all  men in Egypt he was the one man who could surely help him.    \"What is there now to do, excellency?\"    \"My coachman is with the carriage at the gate by which the English girl  left. It is open still. The key is in Foorgat's pocket, no doubt; stolen  by him, no doubt also.... This is my design. Thou wilt drive him\"--he  pointed to the body--\"to his palace, seated in the carriage as though he  were alive. There is a secret entrance. The bowab of the gate will show  the way; I know it not. But who will deny thee? Thou comest from high  places--from Kaid. Who will speak of this? Will the bowab? In the  morning Foorgat will be found dead in his bed! The slight bruise thou  canst heal--thou canst?\"    Mizraim nodded. \"I can smooth it from the sharpest eye.\"    \"At dawn he will be found dead; but at dawn I shall be knocking at his  gates. Before the world knows I shall be in possession. All that is  his shall be mine, for at once the men of law shall be summoned, and my  inheritance secured before Kaid shall even know of his death. I shall  take my chances for my life.\"    \"And the coachman, and the bowab, and others it may be?\"    \"Shall not these be with thee--thou, Kaid's keeper of the harem, the  lion at the door of his garden of women? Would it be strange that  Foorgat, who ever flew at fruit above his head, perilous to get or keep,  should be found on forbidden ground, or in design upon it? Would it be  strange to the bowab or the slave that he should return with thee stark  and still? They would but count it mercy of Kaid that he was not given  to the serpents of the Nile. A word from thee--would one open his mouth?  Would not the shadow of thy hand, of the swift doom, be over them? Would  not a handful of gold bind them to me? Is not the man dead? Are they not  mine--mine to bind or break as I will?\"    \"So be it! Wisdom is of thee as the breath of man is his life. I will  drive Foorgat Bey to his home.\"    A few moments later all that was left of Foorgat Bey was sitting in his  carriage beside Mizraim the Chief Eunuch--sitting upright, stony, and  still, and in such wise was driven swiftly to his palace.          CHAPTER VIII. FOR HIS SOUL'S SAKE AND THE LAND'S SAKE    David came to know a startling piece of news the next morning-that  Foorgat Bey had died of heart-disease in his bed, and was so found by  his servants. He at once surmised that Foorgat's body had been carried  out of the Palace; no doubt that it might not be thought he had come  to his death by command of Kaid. His mind became easier. Death, murder,  crime in Egypt was not a nine days' wonder; it scarce outlived one day.  When a man was gone none troubled. The dead man was in the bosom of  Allah; then why should the living be beset or troubled? If there was  foul play, why make things worse by sending another life after the life  gone, even in the way of justice?    The girl David saved had told him her own name, and had given him the  name of the hotel at which she was staying. He had an early breakfast,  and prepared to go to her hotel, wishing to see her once more. There  were things to be said for the first and last time and then be buried  for ever. She must leave the country at once. In this sick, mad land, in  this whirlpool of secret murder and conspiracy, no one could tell what  plot was hatching, what deeds were forward; and he could not yet be sure  that no one save himself and herself knew who had killed Foorgat Bey.  Her perfect safety lay in instant flight. It was his duty to see that  she went, and at once--this very day. He would go and see her.    He went to the hotel. There he learned that, with her aunt, she had left  that morning for Alexandria en route to England.    He approved her wisdom, he applauded her decision. Yet--yet, somehow,  as he bent his footsteps towards his lodgings again he had a sense of  disappointment, of revelation. What might happen to him--evidently that  had not occurred to her. How could she know but that his life might be  in danger; that, after all, they might have been seen leaving the fatal  room? Well, she had gone, and with all his heart he was glad that she  was safe.    His judgment upon last night's event was not coloured by a single  direct criticism upon the girl. But he could not prevent the suggestion  suddenly flashing into his mind that she had thought of herself first  and last. Well, she had gone; and he was here to face the future,  unencumbered by aught save the weight of his own conscience.    Yet, the weight of his conscience! His feet were still free--free for  one short hour before he went to Kaid; but his soul was in chains. As he  turned his course to the Nile, and crossed over the great bridge, there  went clanking by in chains a hundred conscripts, torn from their homes  in the Fayoum, bidding farewell for ever to their friends, receiving  their last offerings, for they had no hope of return. He looked at their  haggard and dusty faces, at their excoriated ankles, and his eyes closed  in pain. All they felt he felt. What their homes were to them, these  fellaheen, dragged forth to defend their country, to go into the desert  and waste their lives under leaders tyrannous, cruel, and incompetent,  his old open life, his innocence, his integrity, his truthfulness and  character, were to him. By an impulsive act, by a rash blow, he had  asserted his humanity; but he had killed his fellow-man in anger. He  knew that as that fatal blow had been delivered, there was no thought  of punishment--it was blind anger and hatred: it was the ancient  virus working which had filled the world with war, and armed it at the  expense, the bitter and oppressive expense, of the toilers and the poor.  The taxes for wars were wrung out of the sons of labour and sorrow.  These poor fellaheen had paid taxes on everything they possessed. Taxes,  taxes, nothing but taxes from the cradle! Their lands, houses, and  palm-trees would be taxed still, when they would reap no more. And  having given all save their lives, these lives they must now give under  the whip and the chain and the sword.    As David looked at them in their single blue calico coverings, in which  they had lived and slept-shivering in the cold night air upon the bare  ground--these thoughts came to him; and he had a sudden longing to  follow them and put the chains upon his own arms and legs, and go forth  and suffer with them, and fight and die? To die were easy. To fight?...  Was it then come to that? He was no longer a man of peace, but a man  of the sword; no longer a man of the palm and the evangel, but a man of  blood and of crime! He shrank back out of the glare of the sun; for it  suddenly seemed to him that there was written upon his fore head, \"This  is a brother of Cain.\" For the first time in his life he had a shrinking  from the light, and from the sun which he had loved like a Persian, had,  in a sense, unconsciously worshipped.    He was scarcely aware where he was. He had wandered on until he had come  to the end of the bridge and into the great groups of traffickers who,  at this place, made a market of their wares. Here sat a seller of sugar  cane; there wandered, clanking his brasses, a merchant of sweet waters;  there shouted a cheap-jack of the Nile the virtues of a knife from  Sheffield. Yonder a camel-driver squatted and counted his earnings; and  a sheepdealer haggled with the owner of a ghiassa bound for the sands of  the North. The curious came about him and looked at him, but he did not  see or hear. He sat upon a stone, his gaze upon the river, following  with his eyes, yet without consciously observing, the dark riverine  population whose ways are hidden, who know only the law of the river and  spend their lives in eluding pirates and brigands now, and yet again the  peaceful porters of commerce.    To his mind, never a criminal in this land but less a criminal than he!  For their standard was a standard of might the only right; but he--his  whole life had been nurtured in an atmosphere of right and justice, had  been a spiritual demonstration against force. He was with out fear, as  he was without an undue love of life. The laying down of his life had  never been presented to him; and yet, now that his conscience was his  only judge, and it condemned him, he would gladly have given his life to  pay the price of blood.    That was impossible. His life was not his own to give, save by suicide;  and that would be the unpardonable insult to God and humanity. He  had given his word to the woman, and he would keep it. In those brief  moments she must have suffered more than most men suffer in a long life.  Not her hand, however, but his, had committed the deed. And yet a sudden  wave of pity for her rushed over him, because the conviction seized him  that she would also in her heart take upon herself the burden of his  guilt as though it were her own. He had seen it in the look of her face  last night.    For the sake of her future it was her duty to shield herself from any  imputation which might as unjustly as scandalously arise, if the facts  of that black hour ever became known. Ever became known? The thought  that there might be some human eye which had seen, which knew, sent a  shiver through him.    \"I would give my life a thousand times rather than that,\" he said  aloud to the swift-flowing river. His head sank on his breast. His lips  murmured in prayer:    \"But be merciful to me, Thou just Judge of Israel, for Thou hast made  me, and Thou knowest whereof I am made. Here will I dedicate my life to  Thee for the land's sake. Not for my soul's sake, O my God! If it be  Thy will, let my soul be cast away; but for the soul of him whose body I  slew, and for his land, let my life be the long sacrifice.\"    Dreams he had had the night"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6312"],[0,"Representative Men: Seven Lectures (#16)"],[1,"form of moral disease,  an acumen which no conscience can resist. I refer to his feeling of  the profanation of thinking to what is good \"from scientifics.\" \"To  reason about faith, is to doubt and deny.\" He was painfully alive to  the difference between knowing and doing, and this sensibility is  incessantly expressed. Philosophers are, therefore, vipers, cockatrices,  asps, hemorrhoids, presters, and flying serpents; literary men are  conjurers and charlatans.    But this topic suggests a sad afterthought, that here we find the seat  of his own pain. Possibly Swedenborg paid the penalty of introverted  faculties. Success, or a fortunate genius, seems to depend on a happy  adjustment of heart and brain; on a due proportion, hard to hit, of  moral and mental power, which, perhaps, obeys the law of those chemical  ratios which make a proportion in volumes necessary to combination,  as when gases will combine in certain fixed rates, but not at any rate.  It is hard to carry a full cup: and this man, profusely endowed in  heart and mind, early fell into dangerous discord with himself. In his  Animal Kingdom, he surprises us, by declaring that he loved analysis,  and not synthesis; and now, after his fiftieth year, he falls into  jealousy of his intellect; and, though aware that truth is not solitary,  nor is goodness solitary, but both must ever mix and marry, he makes  war on his mind, takes the part of the conscience against it, and, on  all occasions, traduces and blasphemes it. The violence is instantly  avenged. Beauty is disgraced, love is unlovely, when truth, the half  part of heaven, is denied, as much as when a bitterness in men of  talent leads to satire, and destroys the judgment. He is wise, but  wise in his own despite. There is an air of infinite grief, and the  sound of wailing, all over and through this lurid universe. A vampyre  sits in the seat of the prophet, and turns with gloomy appetite to the  images of pain. Indeed, a bird does not more readily weave its nest,  or a mole bore into the ground, than this seer of souls substructs a  new hell and pit, each more abominable than the last, round every new  crew of offenders. He was let down through a column that seemed of  brass, but it was formed of angelic spirits, that he might descend  safely amongst the unhappy, and witness the vastation of souls; and  heard there, for a long continuance, their lamentations; he saw their  tormentors, who increase and strain pangs to infinity; he saw the hell  of the jugglers, the hell of the assassins, the hell of the lascivious;  the hell of robbers, who kill and boil men; the infernal tun of the  deceitful; the excrementitious hells; the hell of the revengeful, whose  faces resembled a round, broad-cake, and their arms rotate like a  wheel. Except Rabelais and Dean Swift, nobody ever had such science  of filth and corruption.    These books should be used with caution. It is dangerous to sculpture  these evanescing images of thought. True in transition, they become  false if fixed. It requires, for his just apprehension, almost a genius  equal to his own. But when his visions become the stereotyped language  of multitudes of persons, of all degrees of age and capacity, they are  perverted. The wise people of the Greek race were accustomed to lead  the most intelligent and virtuous young men, as part of their education,  through the Eleusinian mysteries, wherein, with much pomp and  graduation, the highest truths known to ancient wisdom were taught.  An ardent and contemplative young man, at eighteen or twenty years,  might read once these books of Swedenborg, these mysteries of love and  conscience, and then throw them aside forever. Genius is ever haunted  by similar dreams, when the hells and the heavens are opened to it.  But these pictures are to be held as mystical, that is, as a quite  arbitrary and accidental picture of the truth--not as the truth. Any  other symbol would be as good: then this is safely seen.    Swedenborg's system of the world wants central spontaneity; it is  dynamic, not vital, and lacks power to generate life. There is no  individual in it. The universe is a gigantic crystal, all those atoms  and laminae lie in uninterrupted order, and with unbroken unity, but  cold and still. What seems an individual and a will, is none. There  is an immense chain of intermediation, extending from center to  extremes, which bereaves every agency of all freedom and character.  The universe, in his poem, suffers under a magnetic sleep, and only  reflects the mind of the magnetizer. Every thought comes into each  mind by influence from a society of spirits that surround it, and into  these from a higher society, and so on. All his types mean the same  few things. All his figures speak one speech. All his interlocutors  Swedenborgize. Be they who they may, to this complexion must they come  at last. This Charon ferries them all over in his boat; kings,  counselors, cavaliers, doctors, Sir Isaac Newton, Sir Hans Sloane,  King George II., Mahomet, or whosoever, and all gather one grimness  of hue and style. Only when Cicero comes by, our gentle seer sticks  a little at saying he talked with Cicero, and, with a touch of human  relenting, remarks, \"one whom it was given me to believe was Cicero;\"  and when the _soi disant_ Roman opens his mouth, Rome and eloquence  have ebbed away,--it is plain theologic Swedenborg, like the rest. His  heavens and hells are dull; fault of want of individualism. The  thousand-fold relation of men is not there. The interest that attaches  in nature to each man, because he is right by his wrong, and wrong by  his right, because he defies all dogmatizing and classification, so  many allowances, and contingencies, and futurities, are to be taken  into account, strong by his vices, often paralyzed by his  virtues,--sinks into entire sympathy with his society. This want reacts  to the center of the system. Though the agency of \"the Lord\" is in  every line referred to by name, it never becomes alive. There is no  lustre in that eye which gazes from the center, and which should vivify  the immense dependency of beings.    The vice of Swedenborg's mind is its theologic determination. Nothing  with him has the liberality of universal wisdom, but we are always in  a church. That Hebrew muse, which taught the lore of right and wrong  to man, had the same excess of influence for him, it has had for the  nations. The mode, as well as the essence, was sacred. Palestine is  ever the more valuable as a chapter in universal history, and ever the  less an available element in education. The genius of Swedenborg,  largest of all modern souls in this department of thought, wasted  itself in the endeavor to reanimate and conserve what had already  arrived at its natural term, and, in the great secular Providence, was  retiring from its prominence, before western modes of thought and  expression. Swedenborg and Behmen both failed by attaching themselves  to the Christian symbol, instead of to the moral sentiment, which  carries innumerable christianities, humanities, divinities, in its  bosom.    The excess of influence shows itself in the incongruous importation  of a foreign rhetoric. \"What have I to do,\" asks the impatient reader,  \"with jasper and sardonyx, beryl and chalcedony; what with arks and  passovers, ephahs and ephods; what with lepers and emerods; what with  heave-offerings and unleavened bread; chariots of fire, dragons crowned  and horned, behemoth and unicorn? Good for orientals, these are nothing  to me. The more learning you bring to explain them, the more glaring  the impertinence. The more coherent and elaborate the system, the less  I like it. I say, with the Spartan, 'Why do you speak so much to the  purpose, of that which is nothing to the purpose?' My learning is such  as God gave me in my birth and habit, in the delight and study of my  eyes, and not of another man's. Of all absurdities, this of some  foreigner, purposing to take away my rhetoric, and substitute his own,  and amuse me with pelican and stork, instead of thrush and robin;  palm-trees and shittim-wood, instead of sassafras and hickory,--seems  the most needless.\" Locke said, \"God, when he makes the prophet, does  not unmake the man.\" Swedenborg's history points the remark. The parish  disputes, in the Swedish church, between the friends and foes of Luther  and Melancthon, concerning \"faith alone,\" and \"works alone,\" intrude  themselves into his speculations upon the economy of the universe, and  of the celestial societies. The Lutheran bishop's son, for whom the  heavens are opened, so that he sees with eyes, and in the richest  symbolic forms, the awful truth of things, and utters again, in his  books, as under a heavenly mandate, the indisputable secrets of moral  nature,--with all these grandeurs resting upon him, remains the Lutheran  bishop's son; his judgments are those of a Swedish polemic, and his  vast enlargements purchased by adamantine limitations. He carries his  controversial memory with him, in his visits to the souls. He is like  Michel Angelo, who, in his frescoes, put the cardinal who had offended  him to roast under a mountain of devils; or, like Dante, who avenged,  in vindictive melodies, all his private wrongs; or, perhaps still more  like Montaigne's parish priest, who, if a hailstorm passes over the  village, thinks the day of doom has come, and the cannibals already  have got the pip. Swedenborg confounds us not less with the pains of  Melancthon, and Luther, and Wolfius, and his own books, which he  advertises among the angels.    Under the same theologic cramp, many of his dogmas are bound. His  cardinal position in morals is, that evils should be shunned as sins.  But he does not know what evil is, or what good is, who thinks any  ground remains to be occupied, after saying that evil is to be shunned  as evil. I doubt not he was led by the desire to insert the element"]]]
