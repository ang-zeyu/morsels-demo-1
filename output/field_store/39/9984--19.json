The degree to which a vacuum tube has been exhausted has a very  pronounced effect on its sensitivity. The longer the tube is used the  lower its vacuum gets and generally the less sensitive it becomes.  When this takes place (and you can only guess at it) you can very  often make it more sensitive by warming it over the flame of a candle.  Vacuum tubes having a gas content (in which case they are, of course,  no longer vacuum tubes in the strict sense) make better detectors than  tubes from which the air has been exhausted and which are sealed off  in this evacuated condition because their sensitiveness is not  dependent on the degree of vacuum as in the latter tubes. Moreover, a  tube that is completely exhausted costs more than one that is filled  with gas.          CHAPTER IX    VACUUM TUBE AMPLIFIER RECEIVING SETS      The reason a vacuum tube detector is more sensitive than a crystal  detector is because while the latter merely _rectifies_ the  oscillating current that surges in the receiving circuits, the former  acts as an _amplifier_ at the same time. The vacuum tube can be used  as a separate amplifier in connection with either: (1) a _crystal  detector_ or (2) a _vacuum tube detector_, and (_a_) it will amplify  either the _radio frequency currents_, that is the high frequency  oscillating currents which are set up in the oscillation circuits or  (_b_) it will amplify the _audio frequency currents_, that is, the  _low frequency alternating_ currents that flow through the head phone  circuit.    To use the amplified radio frequency oscillating currents or amplified  audio frequency alternating currents that are set up by an amplifier  tube either a high resistance, called a _grid leak_, or an _amplifying  transformer_, with or without an iron core, must be connected with the  plate circuit of the first amplifier tube and the grid circuit of the  next amplifier tube or detector tube, or with the wire point of a  crystal detector. Where two or more amplifier tubes are coupled  together in this way the scheme is known as _cascade amplification._    Where either a _radio frequency transformer_, that is one without the  iron core, or an _audio frequency transformer_, that is one with the  iron core, is used to couple the amplifier tube circuits together  better results are obtained than where a high resistance grid leak is  used, but the amplifying tubes have to be more carefully shielded from  each other or they will react and set up a _howling_ noise in the head  phones. On the other hand grid leaks cost less but they are more  troublesome to use as you have to find out for yourself the exact  resistance value they must have and this you can do only by testing  them out.    A Grid Leak Amplifier Receiving Set. With Crystal Detector.--The  apparatus you need for this set includes: (1) a _loose coupled tuning  coil_, (2) a _variable condenser_, (3) _two fixed condensers_, (4) a  _crystal detector_, or better a _vacuum tube detector_, (5) an A or _6  volt storage battery_, (6) a _rheostat_, (7) a B or 22-1/2 _volt dry  cell battery_, (8) a fixed resistance unit, or _leak grid_ as it is  called, and (9) a pair of _head-phones_. The tuning coil, variable  condenser, fixed condensers, crystal detectors and head-phones are  exactly the same as those described in _Set No. 2_ in Chapter III.  The A and B batteries are exactly the same as those described in  Chapter VIII. The _vacuum tube amplifier_ and the _grid leak_ are the  only new pieces of apparatus you need and not described before.    The Vacuum Tube Amplifier.--This consists of a three electrode vacuum  tube exactly like the vacuum tube detector described in Chapter VIII  and pictured in Fig. 38, except that instead of being filled with a  non-combustible gas it is evacuated, that is, the air has been  completely pumped out of it. The gas filled tube, however, can be used  as an amplifier and either kind of tube can be used for either radio  frequency or audio frequency amplification, though with the exhausted  tube it is easier to obtain the right plate and filament voltages for  good working.    The Fixed Resistance Unit, or Grid Leak.--Grid leaks are made in  different ways but all of them have an enormously high resistance.  One way of making them consists of depositing a thin film of gold on a  sheet of mica and placing another sheet of mica on top to protect it  the whole being enclosed in a glass tube as shown at A in Fig. 42.  These grid leaks are made in units of from 50,000 ohms (.05 megohm) to  5,000,000 ohms (5 megohms) and cost from $1 to $2.    [Illustration: Fig. 42.--Grid Leaks and How to Connect Them up.]    As the _value_ of the grid leak you will need depends very largely  upon the construction of the different parts of your receiving set and  on the kind of aerial wire system you use with it you will have to try  out various resistances until you hit the right one. The resistance  that will give the best results, however, lies somewhere between  500,000 ohms (1/2 a megohm) and 3,000,000 ohms (3 megohms) and the  only way for you to find this out is to buy 1/2, 1 and 2 megohm grid  leak resistances and connect them up in different ways, as shown at B,  until you find the right value.    Assembling the Parts for a Crystal Detector Set.--Begin by laying the  various parts out on a base or a panel with the loose coupled tuning  coil on the left hand side, but with the adjustable switch of the  secondary coil on the right hand end or in front according to the way  it is made. Then place the variable condenser, the rheostat, the  crystal detector and the binding posts for the head phones in front of  and in a line with each other. Set the vacuum tube amplifier back of  the rheostat and the A and B batteries back of the parts or in any  other place that may be convenient. The fixed condensers and the grid  leak can be placed anywhere so that it will be easy to connect them in  and you are ready to wire up the set.    Connecting Up the Parts for a Crystal Detector.--First connect the  sliding contact of the primary of the tuning coil to the leading-in  wire and one of the end wires of the primary to the water pipe, as  shown in Fig. 43. Now connect the adjustable arm that makes contact  with one end of the secondary of the tuning coil to one of the posts  of the variable condenser; then connect the other post of the latter  with a post of the fixed condenser and the other post of this with the  grid of the amplifying tube.    [Illustration: Fig. 43.--Crystal Detector Receiving Set with Vacuum  Tube Amplifier (Resistance Coupled).]    Connect the first post of the variable condenser to the + or _positive  electrode_ of the A battery and its - or _negative electrode_ with the  rotating contact arm of the rheostat. Next connect one end of the  resistance coil of the rheostat to one of the posts of the amplifier  tube that leads to the filament and the other filament post to the +  or _positive electrode_ of the A battery. This done connect the  _negative_, that is, the _zinc pole_ of the B battery to the positive  electrode of the A battery and connect the _positive_, or _carbon  pole_ of the former with one end of the grid leak and connect the  other end of this to the plate of the amplifier tube.    To the end of the grid leak connected with the plate of the amplifier  tube connect the metal point of your crystal detector, the crystal of  the latter with one post of the head phones and the other post of them  with the other end of the grid leak and, finally, connect a fixed  condenser in _parallel_ with--that is across the ends of the grid  leak, all of which is shown in the wiring diagram in Fig. 43.    A Grid Leak Amplifying Receiving Set With Vacuum Tube Detector.--A  better amplifying receiving set can be made than the one just  described by using a vacuum tube detector instead of the crystal  detector. This set is built up exactly like the crystal detector  described above and shown in Fig. 43 up to and including the grid leak  resistance, but shunted across the latter is a vacuum tube detector,  which is made and wired up precisely like the one shown at A in Fig.  41 in the chapter ahead of this one. The way a grid leak and vacuum  tube detector with a one-step amplifier are connected up is shown at A  in Fig. 44. Where you have a vacuum tube detector and one or more  amplifying tubes connected up, or in _cascade_ as it is called, you  can use an A, or storage battery of 6 volts for all of them as shown  at B in Fig. 44, but for every vacuum tube you use you must have a B  or 22-1/2 volt dry battery to charge the plate with.    [Illustration: (A) Fig. 44--Vacuum Tube Detector Set with One Step  Amplifier (Resistance Coupled).]    [Illustration: (B) Fig. 44.--Wiring Diagram for Using One A or Storage  Battery with an Amplifier and a Detector Tube.]    A Radio Frequency Transformer Amplifying Receiving Set.--Instead of  using a grid leak resistance to couple up the amplifier and detector  tube circuits you can use a _radio frequency transformer_, that is, a  transformer made like a loose coupled tuning coil, and without an iron  core, as shown in the wiring diagram at A in Fig. 45. In this set,  which gives better results than where a grid leak is used, the  amplifier tube is placed in the first oscillation circuit and the  detector tube in the second circuit.    [Illustration: (A) Fig. 45.--Wiring Diagram for a Radio Frequency  Transformer Amplifying Receiving Set.]    [Illustration: (B) Fig. 45.--Radio Frequency Transformer.]    Since the radio frequency transformer has no iron core the high  frequency, or _radio frequency_ oscillating currents, as they are  called, surge through it and are not changed into low frequency, or  _audio frequency_ pulsating currents, until they flow through the  detector. Since the diagram shows only one amplifier and one radio  frequency transformer, it is consequently a _one step"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6948"],[0,"The Secrets of the German War Office (#16)"],[1,"information that Delcasse had arrived at Nizza.  The Countess  had her eyes on the Prince, so this left me free to take care of  Delcasse.  My work was now to learn if the French minister held any  meetings with Sir Edward Grey or Winston Churchill, ministers from  England, who were shortly expected also to arrive at Nizza.  Subsequently I guessed there would be a final meeting with the Prince.  I continually and unobtrusively followed Delcasse everywhere, but  nothing eventuated owing to unforeseen circumstances in the House of  Commons, and the Cabinet of England, Sir Edward and Churchill were  unable to take their \"vacation trips\" in person.  So they sent an  emissary with important documents to Delcasse, one of which came to  light in his subsequent meeting with Prince Galitzin.    On the night of the ninth of November I received a wire from the  Countess.  It w as delivered at the Hotel Anglais, Nizza.  Opening it,  I read:    \"Return.  De Camp here.  Meeting our friend.\"    Of course by De Camp she meant Delcasse.  Clearly he had slipped away  from me.  \"Our friend\" referred to the Prince.  This was news indeed!  Hiring an automobile I made record time for Monte Carlo.  I arrived at  my hotel about three o'clock in the morning of the tenth and found  awaiting me in my room, the Countess' maid.  She delivered part of an  important conversation which had taken place between Delcasse and the  Prince, and of which I shall presently give the substance and its  explanation.  Instructing the maid to inform her mistress that I  wished to see her at ten A. M. at the Casino, in the Salle des  Estranger, I dismissed her.  I chose the Salle des Estranger because  it was the most frequented and for that reason the least suspicious  meeting place.    We met as appointed and the Countess confirmed the maid's report.  For  about three hours on the evening of the ninth, Delcasse, of France,  and Prince Galitzin of Russia were in conference in the Prince's  chamber at the Hotel de Londres.  Having changed her hotel and being  in a chamber adjoining the Prince's, the Countess had managed to  overhear most of this conversation.  In her report there were  naturally some blanks.  She had not been able to hear every word  uttered.  But the purport and trend showed me it was of tremendous  importance.    It was evidently an arrangement between France and Russia, with the  understanding of England, to force Germany into an abject isolation.  Going further, they were trying through a closer alliance of these  three great powers to curtail the activities of German expansion and  completely coup her up diplomatically.  The Countess told me that  Prince Galitzin and Delcasse were going to meet again that same  afternoon about five o'clock.  As it was absolutely imperative to  obtain knowledge of the rest of the conversation I enjoined the  Countess to exert all her skill to secure the details at this most  important interview, and to meet me once more in a corner of the Salle  des Estrangers, this time at seven o'clock.    I returned to my hotel, settled my bill and had my grip taken over to  the railway station; I got a ticket for Milan.  It is always advisable  to lay your plans carefully for a possibly very hurried exit, the  nearest friendly border in this instance being Italy.  In the event of  trouble arising, hurrying through France would have been out of the  question.  Switzerland is an independent country which would have held  me up officially on being requested to do so, although they do not  extradite for political offenses, but being held up is bad enough.  But once across the Italian border, I was safe enough.  A  semi-official hint from the Wilhelmstrasse to the Quirinal would  always procure an open sesame for me--no danger of being held up  there.  Hence the ticket for Milan.    The intervening hours I spent on the outskirts of Monte Carlo,  dropping into many a quaint little wine cellar.  At dusk I entered the  Salle des Estrangers of the Casino and settling myself comfortably in  the appointed corner, awaited developments.  It was a trying wait.  I  sat there from seven to ten-thirty, smoking incessantly.  I was just  finishing my last cigarette and I had about come to the end of my  resources in entertaining myself.  One has ample time to conjecture  all sorts of possible mishaps, and mishaps are deucedly uncomfortable  in this sort of work.    Not to create curiosity or suspicion, by my long occupation of this  particular corner, I had started a tremendous flirtation with a rather  plain, rather rotund lady of the English Cook's Tour type.  Her return  glances and smiles attracted the amused attention of most of the  passers-by, especially the attendant of that part of the Salle.  This  was rather good, for if one does not gamble or flirt in the Casino he  is regarded by the commissaires as a Chevalier d'Industrie, in other  words \"confidence man.\"    Just then I saw the Countess' maid making a signal to me from the  entrance door and without as much as by your leave I hurried after  her.  In about ten strides, I overtook the girl.    \"Have you got anything for me?\"    \"No, sir,\" she replied.  \"But her Ladyship wishes to meet you.  You  are pleased to make a rendezvous.\"    This was clever and suited me; knowing that she must have procured  something of importance, I selected a little cafÃ©, the Boulanger,  close to the station, and after giving the girl a louis, I jumped into  a carriage and drove there.  In a short time I was joined by the  Countess who had thrown a hooded mantle over a brilliant evening gown.  Quietly slipping into a chair next to me she took some folded papers  out of her glove, and while fastening a little rosebud into my lapel  slipped them into mvv pockets with the words:    \"All I could obtain, but you'll find it sufficient.  I'm leaving for  Rome to-morrow night.  Bon voyage!\"    I looked at my watch and saw I had time to catch the train for Milan.  No sooner was I locked in my coupe and the train in motion, when I had  a good look at the papers.  They were two half sheets of note paper,  embossed with the princely coat of arms and containing abbreviated  sentences of dates, and names and a route, all in the handwriting of  Delcasse and the Prince.  The whole gist with her repeated, overheard  snatches of conversation showed clearly an intended secret visit of  the President of France to the Czar of Russia, the names of the  officials to be present and the meeting place, the Czar's yacht, the  _Staandart_, off Kronstadt.  This meeting, however, did not take  place, the Kaiser forestalling it by his quick action on the Moroccan  situation.    From Milan I went to Berlin and within forty-eight hours the documents  were delivered into the hands of Count von Wedel, and then into the  hands of the Emperor.  Their significance was this:    The Moroccan trouble was very ominous.  Germany was in a position  where, sooner or later, she would be forced to act.  Before this  mission the Kaiser was in the dark.  France, Russia and England did  not have their cards on the table.  He did not know which countries  would remain neutral in case of war with France.  He had suspected  that there was some sort of an understanding brewing against him.  The  results of my mission--learning of Sir Edward Grey's message to  Delcasse, Delcasse's meeting with Prince Galitzin of Russia--confirmed  this beyond all doubt.    But how strong was this alliance?  How close would England stick to  France?  This he did not know.  He only knew that there was a sort of  an agreement, and to find out just how strong was the bond between  England and France, he used a master stroke of diplomacy.  He brought  the Moroccan question to a crisis, long before it was anticipated; he  sent the warship _Panther_ into Agadir Harbor and forced England and  France to show their hands.  How close war was averted, only four  persons knew at that time--the Captain of the _Panther_, von Wedel,  the Kaiser and myself.  And how Europe just missed being plunged into  a tremendous war I shall tell of in my secret mission that nipped war  in the bud.    I came near forgetting.  For his discretion at Monte Carlo, the Czar  rewarded Prince Galitzin by transferring him to a province in Siberia.      Chapter VII. The Kaiser Prevents a War    It was Kaiser weather in Germany.  Back from a five months' trip to  the Far East, Berlin seemed to me like Heaven.  I had finished a  secret diplomatic mission for the Kaiser and as a result my pocketbook  was full.  Days and days in the Orient make a man try to crowd into  the first twenty-four hours home, all the enjoyments that his city  offers.  Accordingly, with money running through my fingers like sand,  I planned a long ride in the Grunewald; I saw myself ordering the few  special dishes one gets at Kempinsky's; I would buy a good seat at the  Metropole and to wind up I would look in at the Admiral's Palace when  the performers were mingling in the audience.  It being my first day  back in Berlin, that programme appealed to me a lot more than did the  European diplomatic tangle.  I had been idling the early afternoon  hours at the CafÃ© Bauer, Unter den Linden, but my programme for the  rest of the day finally chosen, I got up, paid my bill and strolled  home.    My boy Kim must have been on the lookout for me; before I could use my  key the door flew open.    \"Master!\" he exclaimed in his heavy, jerky voice.  \"You are wanted on  the telephone.\"    I had an uneasy suspicion of what that meant, which was confirmed when  my boy added, \"Number A 11 wants you.\"    Bismillah!  That settled it!  That ended my Grunewald, Kempinsky's,  the Metropole, the Admiral's Palace.  It meant the highway away.  It  always means that when a man of my position is in Berlin and somebody  says to call up that number, A 11.  Whenever A 11 summons it is wise  to be prompt.  It is the number of the Wilhelmstrasse, the"]]]
