Seat yourselves in  those chairs and be comfortable.\"    Very much like two awed kids being led through Toyland for the first  time, Dave Dawson and Freddy Farmer stepped into the room, and slowly  seated themselves in a couple of chairs. The shop was filled with rugs  of all sizes, and makes, and all colors. They were on the floor in  piles, hung four and five deep on the walls, and suspended on rollers  from the ceiling. Agiz Ammarir's rug shop looked as though it could  supply the whole world, alone, for the next couple of years. It did  not, however, give either Dave or Freddy that impression, for the  simple reason that their entire attention was riveted on Serrangi.  Silent and wide eyed, they watched him close the door, bolt and lock  it, and then move over to a chair for himself. In return, though, he  didn't give them so much as a single glance. Once seated, he set about  lighting one of his long brown paper wrapped cigarettes, with both his  good and bad eye fixed expressionlessly on space.    Not until he was spewing smoke ceilingward did he lower his gaze and  take further notice of their presence.    \"You are entitled to an explanation, so I will give you one,\" he said  in his sifting ashes voice. \"In these days, the man who takes anything  on face value is a fool. And the man who trusts even his own brother  may well be dead tomorrow. For that reason I told you to come here to  speak with one Agiz Ammarir. For that reason I had one of my men make a  show of waylaying you and killing you en route. I....\"    \"So that was a fake?\" Dave gasped out in German. \"But that knife was  inches from my friend's throat!\"    \"It would never have descended all the way to his throat,\" Serrangi  said placidly. \"The attack was to learn what you would say on the  impulse of the moment. _And in what language!_ There was once a man who  came to see me with a promise of great wealth for me ... if I would  reveal a little of the many things I know. He, too, presented himself  as a German and a loyal follower of Herr Hitler. But I am not the one  to be taken in that easy. I sent him, also, to visit Agiz Ammarir. He  too, was attacked on the way. He opened his mouth, and in so doing  sealed his doom, for he _cried out in English_. He was, of course, a  British Secret Service agent. I have never seen him since. I suppose  the poor fellow died from the shock of the attack.\"    The Devil's Den owner gave a little shrug and wave of his hand. Dave  stared at him with admiration in his eyes, but the look was forced, for  in his heart Dave felt only loathing, disgust, and cold anger for the  man. So that was how Air Vice Marshal Bostworth's agent disappeared?  God bless Freddy Farmer for his sudden hunch about thinking as well as  acting as a German. If it hadn't been for Freddy he might have let go  a few choice words in English, himself. And then he and Freddy would  have mysteriously disappeared. A deadly snake if one ever crawled.  That indeed was Serrangi, of the Devil's Den. Deadly, and clever, too.  He knew what had happened to Bostworth's agent all right. Ten to one  he had killed the man with his own hand when the attacker had reported  that English had been cried out. But Serrangi was clever enough not to  admit as much. No, not even to a pair who seemingly had proved they  were a couple of Adolf Hitler's own paid killers.    \"And so, it was only good sense for me to test you two in the same  manner,\" Serrangi's voice broke into Dave's thoughts. \"Of course I felt  certain of you, but it was best to make sure. So, enough of this kind  of talk. Let us speak of other things. The flight that must be made to  the north for one thing. But first, have you two flown in this part of  the world?\"    Dave was tempted to lie, but on second thought decided that for once  the truth might serve them better.    \"No,\" he said just as Freddy started shaking his head. \"We have done  all our flying in Europe. But why is it important we have experience  flying here in the Far East?\"    \"It is not important,\" Serrangi said. \"It might perhaps be a bit  helpful if you knew some of the country out here. That, however, is  only a matter of opinion. I do not fly, but I suppose that flying is  much the same in any part of the world?\"    \"Depends on the pilot,\" Freddy Farmer spoke up, and let it go at that.    \"Of course,\" Serrangi grunted, and drew a roll of paper from inside his  jacket. \"Here,\" he continued, \"is a map of this part of the world. As  you will see it is well marked, and contains much data that one would  not find on other maps of the same section of the world. Here, have a  good look at it.\"    Serrangi unrolled a fair sized map and handed it to Dave. The American  R.A.F. Flight Lieutenant took it in hands difficult to keep from  trembling. Then he swiveled around a bit in his chair, and held it  so that Freddy could look at it too. They did that little thing  together and within two split seconds their hearts were hammering  with suppressed excitement, to say nothing of amazement. The map  was of the entire Malay Peninsula, Thailand, Burma, and a part of  China as far north as Chungking. It was indeed a fine map. It was a  perfect map for a pilot, because it contained countless little bits  of information a pilot would like to know when flying over any of the  territory. In fact, the information had been jotted down by some one  who was obviously a pilot. And when Dave peered hard at the countless  little margin notes and signs a cold lump of lead seemed to form in  his stomach, and there was a great sickness in his brain. Beyond all  question the person who had made the notes and signs was expertly  acquainted with the way in which R.A.F. navigation maps are marked. In  short, no less than an R.A.F. pilot had prepared this map he and Freddy  Farmer stared at.    \"It was a pilot who made this map, was it not?\" Freddy Farmer suddenly  shot out the question.    Serrangi beamed and looked very pleased.    \"So you _are_ pilots, so?\" he murmured. \"That was not just Nazi  boasting to get you to give me work? Fine! Yes, it was made by a pilot.  One of your own kind in England's flying service, it may interest you  to know. He has been of great value to your Fuehrer out here. He will  be a great hero when he returns to your homeland.\"    \"Perhaps we know him,\" Dave murmured in a half interested sort of way.    The lead didn't draw Serrangi out any, however. The Devil's Den owner  shrugged and made a little gesture with his half smoked cigarette.    \"It is possible,\" he grunted. \"But we do not speak names out here. Have  you not noticed I have not even asked your names? I do not care to know  them. Then nothing can make me reveal them to anybody else, you see?  Who a man is, is nothing. What he can do, and does, is everything. A  name is but another unnecessary detail you have to keep alive in your  brain. Too many details is a bad thing. But, yes, that is a pilot's  map. You think you could fly by it?\"    \"Why not?\" Dave echoed.    \"It is clear enough for a blind man to read,\" Freddy Farmer added.  \"Where do you want us to fly?\"    Serrangi smiled and lifted both hands palms showing outward in a slow  down and stop gesture.    \"Let us obtain the plane first,\" he said.    The words fell like thunderbolts on Dave and Freddy. They stared at him  out of incredulous eyes.    \"You mean, you have no plane?\" Dave eventually demanded.    \"And where would I keep a plane here on Singapore Island!\" the other  snarled at him. \"Of course I have no plane! Did I not say that there  was more than a little risk attached to this highly important task?\"    \"But if we are to fly a plane?\" Freddy Farmer said, and then let a  perfect expression of Teutonic dumbness of his face say the rest.    \"Steal one from the British!\" Serrangi snapped at him. \"It has been  done before, and it can be done again. And, of course, you would steal  one that is fully armed and contains sufficient fuel for a long flight.\"    Dave tapped the map with a finger.    \"To Chungking?\" he asked.    Serrangi thought that was very funny, and laughed shrilly.    \"No, not to Chungking!\" he finally cried and wiped his eyes with the  back of his hand. \"It is the Japanese with whom we work, not the  Chinese. No, the end of the flight will be to the point that is marked  there on the map near Lashio, in Burma.\"    Dave and Freddy glanced down quickly at the map. A little Burmese  mountain village called Raja, just east of Lashio, was marked with a  red circled black cross. Dave heard Freddy catch his breath, and he  started inwardly with excitement, himself, because at Lashio was the  beginning of the famous Burma Road, fighting China's lifeline. Her one  remaining supply route contact with the outside world. And the whole  world knew that the one thing the little brown rats of the bucktoothed  Jap emperor on his white horse wanted to do most was cut the Burma  Road. Once they did that they could starve the gallant Chinese into an  armistice in short order. And once China had fallen, hordes upon hordes  of Japanese lice could be sent elsewhere for more conquests.    For two long minutes Dave stared down at the map, then he slowly raised  his eyes to Serrangi's face and smiled slyly.    \"So, the Burma Road, ja?\" he muttered. \"_Herr_ Hitler will be most  pleased. It will open a way into India, perhaps.\"    The Devil's Den owner snorted and waved the statement aside as though  it were small time stuff.    \"The small beginning of many things,\" he said. \"When the guns and air  bombs of Nippon start thundering on the given day half the Eastern  world will not live to learn what happened! But, at Raja is the  beginning of everything. At Raja the signal will be given. I have  arranged everything here at Singapore. We cannot possibly fail if those  at Raja do their part. The British!

He would rather have been a Mormon than an atheist, and  apparently they considered him the latter, and were earnest to save his  soul. Shefford knew that he could never be one any more than the other.  He was just at sea. But he listened, and he found them simple in faith,  blind, perhaps, but loyal and good. It was noteworthy that Mother Smith  happened to be the only woman in the village who had ever mentioned  religion to him. She was old, of a past generation; the young women  belonged to the present. Shefford pondered the significant difference.    Every day made more steadfast his impression of the great mystery that  was like a twining shadow round these women, yet in the same time many  little ideas shifted and many new characteristics became manifest. This  last was of course the result of acquaintance; he was learning more  about the villagers. He gathered from keen interpretation of subtle  words and looks that here in this lonely village, the same as in all  the rest of the world where women were together, there were cliques,  quarrels, dislikes, loves, and jealousies. The truth, once known to him,  made him feel natural and fortified his confidence to meet the demands  of an increasingly interesting position. He discovered, with a somewhat  grim amusement, that a clergyman's experience in a church full of women  had not been entirely useless.    One afternoon he let fall a careless remark that was a subtle question  in regard to the girl Mary, whom Withers called the Sago Lily. In  response he received an answer couched in the sweet poisoned honey  of woman's jealousy. He said no more. Certain ideas of his were  strengthened, and straightway he became thoughtful.    That afternoon late, as he did his camp chores, he watched for her.  But she did not come. Then he decided to go to see her. But even  the decision and the strange thrill it imparted did not change his  reluctance.    Twilight was darkening the valley when he reached her house, and the  shadows were thick under the pinyons. There was no light in the door or  window. He saw a white shape on the porch, and as he came down the path  it rose. It was the girl Mary, and she appeared startled.    \"Good evening,\" he said. \"It's Shefford. May I stay and talk a little  while?\"    She was silent for so long that he began to feel awkward.    \"I'd be glad to have you,\" she replied, finally.    There was a bench on the porch, but he preferred to sit upon a blanket  on the step.    \"I've been getting acquainted with everybody--except you,\" he went on.    \"I have been here,\" she replied.    That might have been a woman's speech, but it certainly had been made in  a girl's voice. She was neither shy nor embarrassed nor self-conscious.  As she stood back from him he could not see her face in the dense  twilight.    \"I've been wanting to call on you.\"    She made some slight movement. Shefford felt a strange calm, yet he knew  the moment was big and potent.    \"Won't you sit here?\" he asked.    She complied with his wish, and then he saw her face, though dimly, in  the twilight. And it struck him mute. But he had no glimpse such as had  flashed upon him from under her hood that other night. He thought of a  white flower in shadow, and received his first impression of the rare  and perfect lily Withers had said graced the wild canyon. She was only a  girl. She sat very still, looking straight before her, and seemed to be  waiting, listening. Shefford saw the quick rise and fall of her bosom.    \"I want to talk,\" he began, swiftly, hoping to put her at her ease.  \"Every one here has been good to me and I've talked--oh, for hours and  hours. But the thing in my mind I haven't spoken of. I've never asked  any questions. That makes my part so strange. I want to tell why I came  out here. I need some one who will keep my secret, and perhaps help  me.... Would you?\"    \"Yes, if I could,\" she replied.    \"You see I've got to trust you, or one of these other women. You're all  Mormons. I don't mean that's anything against you. I believe you're  all good and noble. But the fact makes--well, makes a liberty of speech  impossible. What can I do?\"    Her silence probably meant that she did not know. Shefford sensed less  strain in her and more excitement. He believed he was on the right track  and did not regret his impulse. Even had he regretted it he would have  gone on, for opposed to caution and intelligence was his driving mystic  force.    Then he told her the truth about his boyhood, his ambition to be  an artist, his renunciation to his father's hope, his career as a  clergyman, his failure in religion, and the disgrace that had made him a  wanderer.    \"Oh--I'm sorry!\" she said. The faint starlight shone on her face, in her  eyes, and if he ever saw beauty and soul he saw them then. She seemed  deeply moved. She had forgotten herself. She betrayed girlhood then--all  the quick sympathy, the wonder, the sweetness of a heart innocent and  untutored. She looked at him with great, starry, questioning eyes, as if  they had just become aware of his presence, as if a man had been strange  to her.    \"Thank you. It's good of you to be sorry,\" he said. \"My instinct guided  me right. Perhaps you'll be my friend.\"    \"I will be--if I can,\" she said.    \"But CAN you be?\"    \"I don't know. I never had a friend. I... But, sir, I mustn't talk of  myself.... Oh, I'm afraid I can't help you.\"    How strange the pathos of her voice! Almost he believed she was in need  of help or sympathy or love. But he could not wholly trust a judgment  formed from observation of a class different from hers.    \"Maybe you CAN help me. Let's see,\" he said. \"I don't seek to make you  talk of yourself. But--you're a human being--a girl--almost a woman.  You're not dumb. But even a nun can talk.\"    \"A nun? What is that?\"    \"Well--a nun is a sister of mercy--a woman consecrated to God--who has  renounced the world. In some ways you Mormon women here resemble nuns.  It is sacrifice that nails you in this lonely valley.... You see--how  I talk! One word, one thought brings another, and I speak what perhaps  should be unsaid. And it's hard, because I feel I could unburden myself  to you.\"    \"Tell me what you want,\" she said.    Shefford hesitated, and became aware of the rapid pound of his heart.  More than anything he wanted to be fair to this girl. He saw that she  was warming to his influence. Her shadowy eyes were fixed upon him. The  starlight, growing brighter, shone on her golden hair and white face.    \"I'll tell you presently,\" he said. \"I've trusted you. I'll trust you  with all.... But let me have my own time. This is so strange a thing,  my wanting to confide in you. It's selfish, perhaps. I have my own ax  to grind. I hope I won't wrong you. That's why I'm going to be perfectly  frank. I might wait for days to get better acquainted. But the impulse  is on me. I've been so interested in all you Mormon women. The fact--the  meaning of this hidden village is so--so terrible to me. But that's none  of my business. I have spent my afternoons and evenings with these women  at the different cottages. You do not mingle with them. They are lonely,  but have not such loneliness as yours. I have passed here every night.  No light--no sound. I can't help thinking. Don't censure me or be afraid  or draw within yourself just because I must think. I may be all wrong.  But I'm curious. I wonder about you. Who are you? Mary--Mary what? Maybe  I really don't want to know. I came with selfish motive and now I'd like  to--to--what shall I say? Make your life a little less lonely for the  while I'm here. That's all. It needn't offend. And if you accept it, how  much easier I can tell you my secret. You are a Mormon and I--well, I am  only a wanderer in these wilds. But--we might help each other.... Have I  made a mistake?\"    \"No--no,\" she cried, almost wildly.    \"We can be friends then. You will trust me, help me?\"    \"Yes, if I dare.\"    \"Surely you may dare what the other women would?\"    She was silent.    And the wistfulness of her silence touched him. He felt contrition. He  did not stop to analyze his own emotions, but he had an inkling that  once this strange situation was ended he would have food for reflection.  What struck him most now was the girl's blanched face, the strong,  nervous clasp of her hands, the visible tumult of her bosom. Excitement  alone could not be accountable for this. He had not divined the cause  for such agitation. He was puzzled, troubled, and drawn irresistibly. He  had not said what he had planned to say. The moment had given birth to  his speech, and it had flowed. What was guiding him?    \"Mary,\" he said, earnestly, \"tell me--have you mother, father, sister,  brother? Something prompts me to ask that.\"    \"All dead--gone--years ago,\" she answered.    \"How old are you?\"    \"Eighteen, I think. I'm not sure.\"    \"You ARE lonely.\"    His words were gentle and divining.    \"O God!\" she cried. \"Lonely!\"    Then as a man in a dream he beheld her weeping. There was in her the  unconsciousness of a child and the passion of a woman. He gazed out into  the dark shadows and up at the white stars, and then at the bowed head  with its mass of glinting hair. But her agitation was no longer strange  to him. A few gentle and kind words had proved her undoing. He knew  then that whatever her life was, no kindness or sympathy entered it.  Presently she recovered, and sat as before, only whiter of face it  seemed, and with something tragic in her dark eyes. She was growing cold  and still again, aloof, more like those other Mormon women.    \"I understand,\" he said. \"I'm not sorry I spoke. I felt your trouble,  whatever it is.... Do not retreat into your cold shell, I beg of you....  Let me trust you with my secret.\"    He saw her shake out of the cold apathy. She wavered. He felt an  inexplicable sweetness in the power his voice seemed to have"]]]
