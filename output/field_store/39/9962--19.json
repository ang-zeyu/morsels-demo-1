A great many  goldsmiths are already run off, and more will daily. I question  whether one-third, nay, one-fourth, of them can stand it. From the  very beginning, I founded my judgment of the whole affair upon the  unquestionable maxim, that ten millions (which is more than our running  cash) could not circulate two hundred millions, beyond which our paper  credit extended. That, therefore, whenever that should become doubtful,  be the cause what it would, our noble state machine must inevitably fall  to the ground.\"    On the 12th of September, at the earnest solicitation of Mr. Secretary  Craggs, several conferences were held between the directors of the South  Sea and the directors of the Bank. A report which was circulated,  that the latter had agreed to circulate six millions of the South Sea  Company's bonds, caused the stock to rise to six hundred and seventy;  but in the afternoon, as soon as the report was known to be groundless,  the stock fell again to five hundred and eighty; the next day to five  hundred and seventy, and so gradually to four hundred. [Gay (the poet),  in that disastrous year, had a present from young Craggs of some South  Sea stock, and once supposed himself to be master of twenty thousand  pounds. His friends persuaded him to sell his share, but he dreamed of  dignity and splendour, and could not bear to obstruct his own fortune.  He was then importuned to sell as much as would purchase a hundred a  year for life, \"which,\" says Fenton, \"will make you sure of a clean  shirt and a shoulder of mutton every day.\" This counsel was rejected;  the profit and principal were lost, and Gay sunk under the calamity so  low that his life became in danger.--Johnson's Lives of the Poets.]    The ministry were seriously alarmed at the aspect of affairs. The  directors could not appear in the streets without being insulted;  dangerous riots were every moment apprehended. Despatches were sent off  to the King at Hanover, praying his immediate return. Mr. Walpole, who  was staying at his country-seat, was sent for, that he might employ his  known influence with the directors of the Bank of England to induce them  to accept the proposal made by the South Sea Company for circulating a  number of their bonds.    The Bank was very unwilling to mix itself up with the affairs of the  Company; it dreaded being involved in calamities which it could not  relieve, and received all overtures with visible reluctance. But the  universal voice of the nation called upon it to come to the rescue.  Every person of note in commercial politics was called in to advise in  the emergency. A rough draft of a contract drawn up by Mr. Walpole was  ultimately adopted as the basis of further negotiations, and the public  alarm abated a little.    On the following day, the 20th of September, a general court of  the South Sea Company was held at Merchant Tailors' Hall, in which  resolutions were carried, empowering the directors to agree with the  Bank of England, or any other persons, to circulate the Company's  bonds, or make any other agreement with the Bank which they should think  proper. One of the speakers, a Mr. Pulteney, said it was most surprising  to see the extraordinary panic which had seized upon the people. Men  were running to and fro in alarm and terror, their imaginations filled  with some great calamity, the form and dimensions of which nobody knew.         \"Black it stood as night--       Fierce as ten furies--terrible as hell.\"    At a general court of the Bank of England held two days afterwards, the  governor informed them of the several meetings that had been held on the  affairs of the South Sea Company, adding that the directors had not yet  thought fit to come to any decision upon the matter. A resolution was  then proposed, and carried without a dissentient voice, empowering the  directors to agree with those of the South Sea to circulate their bonds,  to what sum, and upon what terms, and for what time, they might think  proper.    Thus both parties were at liberty to act as they might judge best for  the public interest. Books were opened at the Bank for a subscription of  three millions for the support of public credit, on the usual terms of  15 pounds per cent. deposit, per cent. premium, and 5 pounds per cent.  interest. So great was the concourse of people in the early part of  the morning, all eagerly bringing their money, that it was thought the  subscription would be filled that day; but before noon, the tide  turned. In spite of all that could be done to prevent it, the South Sea  Company's stock fell rapidly. Their bonds were in such discredit, that a  run commenced upon the most eminent goldsmiths and bankers, some of whom  having lent out great sums upon South Sea stock were obliged to shut up  their shops and abscond. The Sword-blade Company, who had hitherto been  the chief cashiers of the South Sea Company, stopped payment. This being  looked upon as but the beginning of evil, occasioned a great run upon  the Bank, who were now obliged to pay out money much faster than they  had received it upon the subscription in the morning. The day succeeding  was a holiday (the 29th of September), and the Bank had a little  breathing time. They bore up against the storm; but their former rivals,  the South Sea Company, were wrecked upon it. Their stock fell to one  hundred and fifty, and gradually, after various fluctuations, to one  hundred and thirty-five.    The Bank, finding they were not able to restore public confidence, and  stem the tide of ruin, without running the risk of being swept away with  those they intended to save, declined to carry out the agreement into  which they had partially entered. They were under no obligation whatever  to continue; for the so called Bank contract was nothing more than the  rough draught of an agreement, in which blanks had been left for  several important particulars, and which contained no penalty for their  secession. \"And thus,\" to use the words of the Parliamentary History,  \"were seen, in the space of eight months, the rise, progress, and fall  of that mighty fabric, which, being wound up by mysterious springs to a  wonderful height, had fixed the eyes and expectations of all Europe,  but whose foundation, being fraud, illusion, credulity, and infatuation,  fell to the ground as soon as the artful management of its directors was  discovered.\"    In the hey-day of its blood, during the progress of this dangerous  delusion, the manners of the nation became sensibly corrupted. The  Parliamentary inquiry, set on foot to discover the delinquents,  disclosed scenes of infamy, disgraceful alike to the morals of the  offenders and the intellects of the people among whom they had arisen.  It is a deeply interesting study to investigate all the evils that were  the result. Nations, like individuals, cannot become desperate gamblers  with impunity. Punishment is sure to overtake them sooner or later. A  celebrated writer [Smollett.] is quite wrong, when he says, \"that such  an era as this is the most unfavourable for a historian; that no reader  of sentiment and imagination can be entertained or interested by a  detail of transactions such as these, which admit of no warmth, no  colouring, no embellishment; a detail of which only serves to exhibit  an inanimate picture of tasteless vice and mean degeneracy.\" On the  contrary, and Smollett might have discovered it, if he had been in the  humour--the subject is capable of inspiring as much interest as even a  novelist can desire. Is there no warmth in the despair of a plundered  people?--no life and animation in the picture which might be drawn of  the woes of hundreds of impoverished and ruined families? of the  wealthy of yesterday become the beggars of to-day? of the powerful  and influential changed into exiles and outcasts, and the voice of  self-reproach and imprecation resounding from every corner of the land?  Is it a dull or uninstructive picture to see a whole people shaking  suddenly off the trammels of reason, and running wild after a golden  vision, refusing obstinately to believe that it is not real, till, like  a deluded hind running after an ignis fatuus, they are plunged into a  quagmire? But in this false spirit has history too often been written.  The intrigues of unworthy courtiers to gain the favour of still more  unworthy kings; or the records of murderous battles and sieges have  been dilated on, and told over and over again, with all the eloquence  of style and all the charms of fancy; while the circumstances which have  most deeply affected the morals and welfare of the people, have been  passed over with but slight notice as dry and dull, and capable of  neither warmth nor colouring.    During the progress of this famous bubble, England presented a singular  spectacle. The public mind was in a state of unwholesome fermentation.  Men were no longer satisfied with the slow but sure profits of cautious  industry. The hope of boundless wealth for the morrow made them  heedless and extravagant for to-day. A luxury, till then unheard-of, was  introduced, bringing in its train a corresponding laxity of morals. The  overbearing insolence of ignorant men, who had arisen to sudden wealth  by successful gambling, made men of true gentility of mind and manners,  blush that gold should have power to raise the unworthy in the scale of  society. The haughtiness of some of these \"cyphering cits,\" as they were  termed by Sir Richard Steele, was remembered against them in the day  of their adversity. In the Parliamentary inquiry, many of the directors  suffered more for their insolence than for their peculation. One of  them, who, in the full-blown pride of an ignorant rich man, had said  that he would feed his horse upon gold, was reduced almost to bread and  water for himself; every haughty look, every overbearing speech, was set  down, and repaid them a hundredfold in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6382"],[0,"Bat Wing (#16)"],[1,"remember that I am here upon business, and that my professional  reputation is perhaps at stake.\"    He stared very hard at Colonel Menendez.    \"I have spoken with your butler, known as Pedro, and with some of the  other servants, and have learned all that there is to be learned about  the person unknown who gained admittance to the house a month ago, and  concerning the wing of a bat, found attached to the door more recently.\"    \"And to what conclusion have you come?\" asked Colonel Menendez, eagerly.    He bent forward, resting his elbows upon his knees, a pose which he  frequently adopted. He was smoking a cigar, but his total absorption in  the topic under discussion was revealed by the fact that from a pocket  in his dinner jacket he had taken out a portion of tobacco, had laid  it in a slip of rice paper, and was busily rolling one of his eternal  cigarettes.    \"I might be enabled to come to one,\" replied Harley, \"if you would  answer a very simple question.\"    \"What is this question?\"    \"It is this--Have you any idea who nailed the bat's wing to your door?\"    Colonel Menendez's eyes opened very widely, and his face became more  aquiline than ever.    \"You have heard my story, Mr. Harley,\" he replied, softly. \"If I know  the explanation, why do I come to you?\"    Paul Harley puffed at his pipe. His expression did not alter in the  slightest.    \"I merely wondered if your suspicions tended in the direction of Mr.  Colin Camber,\" he said.    \"Colin Camber!\"    As the Colonel spoke the name either I became victim of a strange  delusion or his face was momentarily convulsed. If my senses served me  aright then his pronouncing of the words \"Colin Camber\" occasioned him  positive agony. He clutched the arms of his chair, striving, I thought,  to retain composure, and in this he succeeded, for when he spoke again  his voice was quite normal.    \"Have you any particular reason for your remark, Mr. Harley?\"    \"I have a reason,\" replied Paul Harley, \"but don't misunderstand me. I  suggest nothing against Mr. Camber. I should be glad, however, to know  if you are acquainted with him?\"    \"We have never met.\"    \"You possibly know him by repute?\"    \"I have heard of him, Mr. Harley. But to be perfectly frank, I have  little in common with citizens of the United States.\"    A note of arrogance, which at times crept into his high, thin voice,  became perceptible now, and the aristocratic, aquiline face looked very  supercilious.    How the conversation would have developed I know not, but at this  moment Pedro entered and delivered a message in Spanish to the Colonel,  whereupon the latter arose and with very profuse apologies begged  permission to leave us for a few moments.    When he had retired:    \"I am going upstairs to write a letter, Knox,\" said Paul Harley. \"Carry  on with your old duties to-day, your new ones do not commence until  to-morrow.\"    With that he laughed and walked out of the dining room, leaving me  wondering whether to be grateful or annoyed. However, it did not take me  long to find my way to the drawing room where the two ladies were seated  side by side upon a settee, Madame's chair having been wheeled into a  corner.    \"Ah, Mr. Knox,\" exclaimed Madame as I entered, \"have the others  deserted, then?\"    \"Scarcely deserted, I think. They are merely straggling.\"    \"Absent without leave,\" murmured Val Beverley.    I laughed, and drew up a chair. Madame de Staemer was smoking, but Miss  Beverley was not. Accordingly, I offered her a cigarette, which she  accepted, and as I was lighting it with elaborate care, every moment  finding a new beauty in her charming face, Pedro again appeared and  addressed some remark in Spanish to Madame.    \"My chair, Pedro,\" she said; \"I will come at once.\"    The Spanish butler wheeled the chair across to the settee, and lifting  her with an ease which spoke of long practice, placed her amidst the  cushions where she spent so many hours of her life.    \"I know you will excuse me, dear,\" she said to Val Beverley, \"because I  feel sure that Mr. Knox will do his very best to make up for my absence.  Presently, I shall be back.\"    Pedro holding the door open, she went wheeling out, and I found myself  alone with Val Beverley.    At the time I was much too delighted to question the circumstances which  had led to this tete-a-tete, but had I cared to give the matter any  consideration, it must have presented rather curious features. The call  first of host and then of hostess was inconsistent with the courtesy of  the master of Cray's Folly, which, like the appointments of his home and  his mode of life, was elaborate. But these ideas did not trouble me at  the moment.    Suddenly, however, indeed before I had time to speak, the girl started  and laid her hand upon my arm.    \"Did you hear something?\" she whispered, \"a queer sort of sound?\"    \"No,\" I replied, \"what kind of sound?\"    \"An odd sort of sound, almost like--the flapping of wings.\"    I saw that she had turned pale, I saw the confirmation of something  which I had only partly realised before: that her life at Cray's Folly  was a constant fight against some haunting shadow. Her gaiety, her  lightness, were but a mask. For now, in those wide-open eyes, I read  absolute horror.    \"Miss Beverley,\" I said, grasping her hand reassuringly, \"you alarm me.  What has made you so nervous to-night?\"    \"To-night!\" she echoed, \"to-night? It is every night. If you had not  come--\" she corrected herself--\"if someone had not come, I don't think I  could have stayed. I am sure I could not have stayed.\"    \"Doubtless the attempted burglary alarmed you?\" I suggested, intending  to sooth her fears.    \"Burglary?\" She smiled unmirthfully. \"It was no burglary.\"    \"Why do you say so, Miss Beverley?\"    \"Do you think I don't know why Mr. Harley is here?\" she challenged. \"Oh,  believe me, I know--I know. I, too, saw the bat's wing nailed to the  door, Mr. Knox. You are surely not going to suggest that this was the  work of a burglar?\"    I seated myself beside her on the settee.    \"You have great courage,\" I said. \"Believe me, I quite understand all  that you have suffered.\"    \"Is my acting so poor?\" she asked, with a pathetic smile.    \"No, it is wonderful, but to a sympathetic observer only acting,  nevertheless.\"    I noted that my presence reassured her, and was much comforted by this  fact.    \"Would you like to tell me all about it,\" I continued; \"or would this  merely renew your fears?\"    \"I should like to tell you,\" she replied in a low voice, glancing about  her as if to make sure that we were alone. \"Except for odd people,  friends, I suppose, of the Colonel's, we have had so few visitors since  we have been at Cray's Folly. Apart from all sorts of queer happenings  which really\"--she laughed nervously--\"may have no significance  whatever, the crowning mystery to my mind is why Colonel Menendez should  have leased this huge house.\"    \"He does not entertain very much, then?\"    \"Scarcely at all. The 'County'--do you know what I mean by the  'County?'--began by receiving him with open arms and ended by sending  him to Coventry. His lavish style of entertainment they labelled  'swank'--horrible word but very expressive! They concluded that they  did not understand him, and of everything they don't understand they  disapprove. So after the first month or so it became very lonely  at Cray's Folly. Our foreign servants--there are five of them  altogether--got us a dreadfully bad name. Then, little by little, a sort  of cloud seemed to settle on everything. The Colonel made two visits  abroad, I don't know exactly where he went, but on his return from the  first visit Madame de Staemer changed.\"    \"Changed?--in what way?\"    \"I am afraid it would be hopeless to try to make you understand, Mr.  Knox, but in some subtle way she changed. Underneath all her vivacity  she is a tragic woman, and--oh, how can I explain?\" Val Beverley made a  little gesture of despair.    \"Perhaps you mean,\" I suggested, \"that she seemed to become even less  happy than before?\"    \"Yes,\" she replied, looking at me eagerly. \"Has Colonel Menendez told  you anything to account for it?\"    \"Nothing,\" I said, \"He has left us strangely in the dark. But you say he  went abroad on a second and more recent occasion?\"    \"Yes, not much more than a month ago. And after that, somehow or  other, matters seemed to come to a head. I confess I became horribly  frightened, but to have left would have seemed like desertion, and  Madame de Staemer has been so good to me.\"    \"Did you actually witness any of the episodes which took place about a  month ago?\"    Val Beverley shook her head.    \"I never saw anything really definite,\" she replied.    \"Yet, evidently you either saw or heard something which alarmed you.\"    \"Yes, that is true, but it is so difficult to explain.\"    \"Could you try to explain?\"    \"I will try if you wish, for really I am longing to talk to someone  about it. For instance, on several occasions I have heard footsteps in  the corridor outside my room.\"    \"At night?\"    \"Yes, at night.\"    \"Strange footsteps?\"    She nodded.    \"That is the uncanny part of it. You know how familiar one grows with  the footsteps of persons living in the same house? Well, these footsteps  were quite unfamiliar to me.\"    \"And you say they passed your door?\"    \"Yes. My rooms are almost directly overhead. And right at the end of the  corridor, that is on the southeast corner of the building, is Colonel  Menendez's bedroom, and facing it a sort of little smoke-room. It was in  this direction that the footsteps went.\"    \"To Colonel Menendez's room?\"    \"Yes. They were light, furtive footsteps.\"    \"This took place late at night?\"    \"Quite late, long after everyone had retired.\"    She paused, staring at me with a sort of embarrassment, and presently:    \"Were the footsteps those of a man or a woman?\" I asked.    \"Of a woman. Someone, Mr. Knox,\" she"]]]
