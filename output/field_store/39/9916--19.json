I can't quite follow all your ideas. Business conditions  and war-orders would continue, wouldn't they?\"    Cone shook his head again. \"No,\" he insisted. \"The business community's  got confidence in Roosevelt. Sure he's a tough baby, sure he's got a  lot of dumb Harvard men sore at him, sure he's got the labor leaders  _and_ the G.I.'s rooting for him. But he's done a good job with the  war, he's let people make money and some of his best friends are  multi-millionaires, like Astor and Harriman. If he was to die, we'd  have this Missouri guy--whatsisname? Truman?--and what can he offer?\"    \"Got any comment on that, Graham?\" I asked.    \"The way Phil puts it, it sounds reasonable,\" Wasson admitted, \"but  I still say that the first reaction to anything like that would be a  buying wave which would send the market way up.\"    I considered for a couple of minutes. \"I can't say I agree with you,\"  I said at last. \"The big boys wouldn't let that happen any more than  they'd let a peace-scare knock the bottom out of the market. What would  labor and the G. I.'s think and do if they read that the Stock Market  quotations went over the top at a thing like that.\"    \"Well, Winnie,\" Cone observed. \"It isn't likely to happen.\"    \"That's so,\" I agreed. \"However, I think it would be a good idea to  work out a representative list of industrials and go short on the  market generally for the next thirty days. We can unload the Fynch  portfolio as a starter. We ought to be able to pick up two or three  hundred thousand if we work it right.\"    Cone nodded. \"Graham and I will go to work on it now, and we'll have  the list ready before start of business tomorrow morning. That will be  the tenth, won't it?\"    Wasson looked uneasy. \"I don't like it so much, Winnie,\" he said, \"but  I've never seen you lose money on a hunch yet so I'll string along.  Come on, Phil, this is a hell of a big war we're trying to sell short.  Let's hope we don't fall flat on our face.\"          CHAPTER 12      The phone rang. \"Mr. Tompkins?\" A girl's voice inquired. \"Just a  moment, Mr. Willamer of the Securities and Exchange Commission will  speak to you.\"    I didn't like that \"will.\" \"And who the hell, Arthurjean, is Mr.  Willamer of the S.E.C.?\" I asked in an aside.    \"The woiks,\" she said.    \"Hullo, Tompkins,\" a clear phonogenic baritone inquired. \"This is Harry  Willamer. I saw your list of selling-orders this morning and wondered  if you would drop in and see me.\"    \"Certainly,\" I said. \"Shall I bring my books?\"    \"Not necessary. This is entirely informal. As a matter of fact, I have  some gentlemen from Washington whom I think you will be interested in  meeting. This is entirely unofficial, of course.\"    \"How about meeting me at the Pond Club at one o'clock?\"    \"That will be grand,\" Mr. Willamer answered heartily. \"The Pond Club at  one o'clock it is.\"    I turned to Arthurjean. \"What kind of go-round is this? I start selling  and inside an hour the S.E.C. is on my tail. Isn't speculation legal  any more?\"    \"Baby,\" she remarked, \"anything's legal as long as you're in with the  right guys. All I can tell you is that Willamer is hot stuff. His aunt  is a cousin of Jesse Jones or maybe it's Henry Morgenthau. So you watch  yourself and don't do any talking out of turn.\"    It was Tuesday, the 10th, and I had launched my plan of selling the war  short in a determined campaign to unload G.M. and U.S. Steel. I was  well covered in case of a rise, but there was already a million dollars  of the firm's money in the operation, behind the Fynch million which I  had used to break the ice.    The Pond Club was the same as ever. Tammy was polishing the glasses in  his little bar and there were no fellow-members in evidence. After all,  I decided, they weren't likely to show up much before three o'clock.  However, I decided that privacy was called for, especially if Commander  Tolan put in an appearance.    \"Tammy,\" I explained, as he produced his usual pick-me-up and waited  for me to down it. \"I'm expecting some gentlemen to join me in a few  minutes. Is there a room where we could have a private conversation and  still get something to drink?\"    \"Well, sir, Mr. Tompkins,\" the steward said, \"I think I could let you  use the Minnow Room. That's private and there's a dumbwaiter to the  bar. Just push the buzzer and say what you want in the phone and I'll  send it right up to you.\"    \"It sounds like perfection,\" I told him. \"I'll go on up to the Minnow  Room. The gentleman I'm expecting is named Willamer and he'll have  some friends with him. Just send them up when they arrive. How do you  get there?\"    Tammy looked a trifle startled. \"That's where you had your bachelor  dinner, sir,\" he reproved me. \"Up the stairs and first door to your  left, sir. You'll remember it when you see it, I'm quite sure.\"    Tammy was right. No one who had ever seen the Pond Club's Minnow Room  was likely to forget it. The wall on one side was lined solid with  illuminated tanks containing gold-fish making fishy little zeros with  their stupid mouths. The other walls were enlivened by frescoes of  drunken fish in various hilarious attitudes. Indirect lighting gave a  sort of Black Mass or Diabolical Fish-Fry effect to the whole. It was  definitely not a room to stay sober in.    \"Tompkins?\" The door opened and an egg-smooth young man with a baldish  head and pale eyebrows stood in the entrance. \"I'm Harry Willamer. Meet  the rest of the gang. Here's Winston Sales of the War Production Board,  Lieutenant-Colonel George Finogan of the Army Quartermaster Corps and  Commander Raymond Coonley of the Navy Bureau of Supplies.\"    Except for the uniforms, they might have been cousins--they were all  fattish, baldish and blondish. They were all egg-like men, middle-aged,  all hearty in manner and all seemed to have no particular reason for  existing.    \"Well, gentlemen,\" I asked, \"what will you have to drink?\"    \"Scotch-and-soda,\" said Willamer. \"Hell, let's make it Scotch for  everyone and save trouble.\"    \"I'd like a whiskey sour,\" objected Commander Coonley. \"I've got  butterflies in my stomach after working with those hot-shots from  Detroit last night.\"    \"Okay,\" Willamer accepted the amendment. \"One whiskey sour. Any other  changes?\"    There were none, so I signaled to Tammy and our order was filled.    \"Tompkins,\" Willamer remarked. \"You'll excuse this short notice but  when I spotted your selling-orders in the market this morning I knew we  had to move fast. First of all, I'd like to know why you are selling,  when everybody else is buying.\"    \"Mr. Willamer,\" I explained, \"it's none of the S.E.C.'s goddamned  business what or why I sell so long as I follow the regulations.\"    Willamer laughed. \"Who said anything about the S.E.C.?\" he demanded.  \"Oh, I get it. You thought this was an informal investigation by the  Commission. Right? My fault. Should have told you that this has nothing  to do with your firm's market-position or the S.E.C.\"    I took a reflective swallow of Scotch. \"Then what the hell _is_ this?\"  I asked.    Harry Willamer drew himself up, \"We,\" he explained, \"are the Inter-Alia  Trading Corporation. Your selling orders suggest that you don't expect  the war to last much longer.\"    \"I don't,\" I told him.    \"Neither do we,\" Willamer continued. \"That's why we've been busy  organizing Inter-Alia. It's a neat set-up. Sales here, on the War  Production Board, is in a position to advise us of all cut-backs in  war-contracts and keep in touch with the whole contract-termination  program. Colonel Finogan is in the Quartermaster Corps and is the only  man in the Army--\"    \"In the world, Harry,\" Finogan corrected him.    \"Right you are, George, in the world--who knows where all the surplus  war-stocks are located. His office routes them to the depots. That  in itself is worth a million dollars to the company. Anything from  jeeps to nylons, Colonel Finogan knows where they are and what price  will buy them. Commander Coonley is in the same position on Navy  Supplies. Between him and Finogan there isn't an ounce of anything from  parachute-silk to bull-dozers which we can't locate. As for me, I watch  the way money and markets move here in Wall Street.\"    I finished my drink. \"That sounds wonderful, Mr. Willamer, but what  has it got to do with me? You have the makings of a ten million dollar  corporation between the four of you.\"    Willamer raised a soft, white, well-manicured hand in a  traffic-stopping gesture. \"All but one thing, Tompkins,\" he said.  \"We haven't got working capital to exploit this set-up. That's where  you come in. Tompkins, Wasson & Cone controls between three and  five million dollars and are smart operators. So long as you stuck  to conservative methods, no dice for Inter-Alia, but when I saw you  gambling on the early end of the war, I said to myself, this is where  we can do business with Tompkins.\"    \"How much do you need?\" I asked.    \"Three hundred thousand would be enough to start with,\" Willamer  reckoned.    \"Half a million,\" Finogan amended.    \"Say you need half a million to start with and I put it up, what do I  get out of it?\" I demanded.    Willamer looked a little secretive. \"Well, Tompkins,\" he admitted.  \"You'll get good security for your money, of course, and a share in  what we make. Say a fifth, since there are four of us in it already.\"    \"That sounds reasonable,\" I agreed, \"assuming you have a sure thing.  What's your first operation, once you get the money in Inter-Alia to  finance it?\"    Willamer looked still more secretive. \"That is a firm secret,  Tompkins,\" he told me. \"If you decide to come in with us, I'll let you  in on our plans, but this thing is too big to talk about until we see  the color of your money.\"    I stood up. \"Well, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/520"],[0,"The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus (#16)"],[1," was created, as you say, in the Beginning, it was because the  Supreme Master knew that some day it would be required.  Until now no  mortal has deserved it, but who among you dares deny that the good  Claus deserves it?  Will you not all vote to bestow it upon him?\"    They were silent, still looking upon one another questioningly.    \"Of what use is the Mantle of Immortality unless it is worn?\" demanded  Ak.  \"What will it profit any one of us to allow it to remain in its  lonely shrine for all time to come?\"    \"Enough!\" cried the Gnome King, abruptly.  \"We will vote on the matter,  yes or no.  For my part, I say yes!\"    \"And I!\" said the Fairy Queen, promptly, and Ak rewarded her with a  smile.    \"My people in Burzee tell me they have learned to love him; therefore I  vote to give Claus the Mantle,\" said the King of the Ryls.    \"He is already a comrade of the Knooks,\" announced the ancient King of  that band.  \"Let him have immortality!\"    \"Let him have it--let him have it!\" sighed the King of the Wind Demons.    \"Why not?\" asked the King of the Sleep Fays.  \"He never disturbs the  slumbers my people allow humanity.  Let the good Claus be immortal!\"    \"I do not object,\" said the King of the Sound Imps.    \"Nor I,\" murmured the Queen of the Water Sprites.    \"If Claus does not receive the Mantle it is clear none other can ever  claim it,\" remarked the King of the Light Elves, \"so let us have done  with the thing for all time.\"    \"The Wood-Nymphs were first to adopt him,\" said Queen Zurline.  \"Of  course I shall vote to make him immortal.\"    Ak now turned to the Master Husbandman of the World, who held up his  right arm and said \"Yes!\"    And the Master Mariner of the World did likewise, after which Ak, with  sparkling eyes and smiling face, cried out:    \"I thank you, fellow immortals!  For all have voted 'yes,' and so to  our dear Claus shall fall the one Mantle of Immortality that it is in  our power to bestow!\"    \"Let us fetch it at once,\" said the Fay King; \"I'm in a hurry.\"    They bowed assent, and instantly the Forest glade was deserted.  But in  a place midway between the earth and the sky was suspended a gleaming  crypt of gold and platinum, aglow with soft lights shed from the facets  of countless gems.  Within a high dome hung the precious Mantle of  Immortality, and each immortal placed a hand on the hem of the splendid  Robe and said, as with one voice:    \"We bestow this Mantle upon Claus, who is called the Patron Saint of  Children!\"    At this the Mantle came away from its lofty crypt, and they carried it  to the house in the Laughing Valley.    The Spirit of Death was crouching very near to the bedside of Claus,  and as the immortals approached she sprang up and motioned them back  with an angry gesture.  But when her eyes fell upon the Mantle they  bore she shrank away with a low moan of disappointment and quitted that  house forever.    Softly and silently the immortal Band dropped upon Claus the precious  Mantle, and it closed about him and sank into the outlines of his body  and disappeared from view.  It became a part of his being, and neither  mortal nor immortal might ever take it from him.    Then the Kings and Queens who had wrought this great deed dispersed to  their various homes, and all were well contented that they had added  another immortal to their Band.    And Claus slept on, the red blood of everlasting life coursing swiftly  through his veins; and on his brow was a tiny drop of water that had  fallen from the ever-melting gown of the Queen of the Water Sprites,  and over his lips hovered a tender kiss that had been left by the sweet  Nymph Necile.  For she had stolen in when the others were gone to gaze  with rapture upon the immortal form of her foster son.        2.  When the World Grew Old    The next morning, when Santa Claus opened his eyes and gazed around the  familiar room, which he had feared he might never see again, he was  astonished to find his old strength renewed and to feel the red blood  of perfect health coursing through his veins.  He sprang from his bed  and stood where the bright sunshine came in through his window and  flooded him with its merry, dancing rays.  He did not then understand  what had happened to restore to him the vigor of youth, but in spite of  the fact that his beard remained the color of snow and that wrinkles  still lingered in the corners of his bright eyes, old Santa Claus felt  as brisk and merry as a boy of sixteen, and was soon whistling  contentedly as he busied himself fashioning new toys.    Then Ak came to him and told of the Mantle of Immortality and how Claus  had won it through his love for little children.    It made old Santa look grave for a moment to think he had been so  favored; but it also made him glad to realize that now he need never  fear being parted from his dear ones.  At once he began preparations  for making a remarkable assortment of pretty and amusing playthings,  and in larger quantities than ever before; for now that he might always  devote himself to this work he decided that no child in the world, poor  or rich, should hereafter go without a Christmas gift if he could  manage to supply it.    The world was new in the days when dear old Santa Claus first began  toy-making and won, by his loving deeds, the Mantle of Immortality.  And the task of supplying cheering words, sympathy and pretty  playthings to all the young of his race did not seem a difficult  undertaking at all.  But every year more and more children were born  into the world, and these, when they grew up, began spreading slowly  over all the face of the earth, seeking new homes; so that Santa Claus  found each year that his journeys must extend farther and farther from  the Laughing Valley, and that the packs of toys must be made larger and  ever larger.    So at length he took counsel with his fellow immortals how his work  might keep pace with the increasing number of children that none might  be neglected.  And the immortals were so greatly interested in his  labors that they gladly rendered him their assistance.  Ak gave him his  man Kilter, \"the silent and swift.\"  And the Knook Prince gave him  Peter, who was more crooked and less surly than any of his brothers.  And the Ryl Prince gave him Nuter, the sweetest tempered Ryl ever  known.  And the Fairy Queen gave him Wisk, that tiny, mischievous but  lovable Fairy who knows today almost as many children as does Santa  Claus himself.    With these people to help make the toys and to keep his house in order  and to look after the sledge and the harness, Santa Claus found it much  easier to prepare his yearly load of gifts, and his days began to  follow one another smoothly and pleasantly.    Yet after a few generations his worries were renewed, for it was  remarkable how the number of people continued to grow, and how many  more children there were every year to be served.  When the people  filled all the cities and lands of one country they wandered into  another part of the world; and the men cut down the trees in many of  the great forests that had been ruled by Ak, and with the wood they  built new cities, and where the forests had been were fields of grain  and herds of browsing cattle.    You might think the Master Woodsman would rebel at the loss of his  forests; but not so.  The wisdom of Ak was mighty and farseeing.    \"The world was made for men,\" said he to Santa Claus, \"and I have but  guarded the forests until men needed them for their use.  I am glad my  strong trees can furnish shelter for men's weak bodies, and warm them  through the cold winters.  But I hope they will not cut down all the  trees, for mankind needs the shelter of the woods in summer as much as  the warmth of blazing logs in winter.  And, however crowded the world  may grow, I do not think men will ever come to Burzee, nor to the Great  Black Forest, nor to the wooded wilderness of Braz; unless they seek  their shades for pleasure and not to destroy their giant trees.\"    By and by people made ships from the tree-trunks and crossed over  oceans and built cities in far lands; but the oceans made little  difference to the journeys of Santa Claus.  His reindeer sped over the  waters as swiftly as over land, and his sledge headed from east to west  and followed in the wake of the sun.  So that as the earth rolled  slowly over Santa Claus had all of twenty-four hours to encircle it  each Christmas Eve, and the speedy reindeer enjoyed these wonderful  journeys more and more.    So year after year, and generation after generation, and century after  century, the world grew older and the people became more numerous and  the labors of Santa Claus steadily increased.  The fame of his good  deeds spread to every household where children dwelt.  And all the  little ones loved him dearly; and the fathers and mothers honored him  for the happiness he had given them when they too were young; and the  aged grandsires and granddames remembered him with tender gratitude and  blessed his name.        3.  The Deputies of Santa Claus    However, there was one evil following in the path of civilization that  caused Santa Claus a vast amount of trouble before he discovered a way  to overcome it.  But, fortunately, it was the last trial he was forced  to undergo.    One Christmas Eve, when his reindeer had leaped to the top of a new  building, Santa Claus was surprised to find that the chimney had been  built much smaller than usual.  But he had no time to think about it  just then, so he drew in his breath and made himself as small as  possible and slid down the chimney.    \"I ought to be at the bottom by this time,\" he thought, as he continued  to slip downward; but no fireplace of any sort met his view, and by and  by he reached the very end of the chimney, which was in the cellar.    \"This is odd!\" he reflected, much puzzled by this experience.  \"If  there is no fireplace, what on earth is the chimney good for?"]]]
