Now and  then one would apply a torch to the person of Dirck, meanly assailing him  in the rear, and the smart of the burn made him feet it the livelier. At  last they turned toward the Battery as by common consent, and went  careering along the street in frolic fashion. Rooney, whose senses had  thus far been pent in a stupor, fled with a yell of terror, and as he  looked back he saw the unholy troop disappearing in the mist like a  moving galaxy. Never from that night was Dirck Van Data seen or heard of  more, and the publicans felt that they had less reason for living.          THE PARTY FROM GIBBET ISLAND    Ellis Island, in New York harbor, once bore the name of Gibbet Island,  because pirates and mutineers were hanged there in chains. During the  times when it was devoted to this fell purpose there stood in Communipaw  the Wild Goose tavern, where Dutch burghers resorted, to smoke, drink  Hollands, and grow fat, wise, and sleepy in each others' company. The  plague of this inn was Yan Yost Vanderscamp, a nephew of the landlord,  who frequently alarmed the patrons of the house by putting powder into  their pipes and attaching briers beneath their horses' tails, and who  naturally turned pirate when he became older, taking with him to sea his  boon companion, an ill-disposed, ill-favored blackamoor named Pluto, who  had been employed about the tavern. When the landlord died, Vanderscamp  possessed himself of this property, fitted it up with plunder, and at  intervals he had his gang ashore,--such a crew of singing, swearing,  drinking, gaming devils as Communipaw had never seen the like of; yet the  residents could not summon activity enough to stop the goings-on that  made the Wild Goose a disgrace to their village. The British authorities,  however, caught three of the swashbucklers and strung them up on Gibbet  Island, and things that went on badly in Communipaw after that went on  with quiet and secrecy.    The pirate and his henchmen were returning to the tavern one night, after  a visit to a rakish-looking vessel in the offing, when a squall broke in  such force as to give their skiff a leeway to the place of executions. As  they rounded that lonely reef a creaking noise overhead caused  Vanderscamp to look up, and he could not repress a shudder as he saw the  bodies of his three messmates, their rags fluttering and their chains  grinding in the wind.    \"Don't you want to see your friends?\" sneered Pluto. \"You, who are never  afraid of living men, what do you fear from the dead?\"    \"Nothing,\" answered the pirate. Then, lugging forth his bottle, he took a  long pull at it, and holding it toward the dead felons, he shouted,  \"Here's fair weather to you, my lads in the wind, and if you should be  walking the rounds to-night, come in to supper.\"    A clatter of bones and a creak of chains sounded like a laugh. It was  midnight when the boat pulled in at Communipaw, and as the storm  continued Vanderscamp, drenched to the skin, made quick time to the Wild  Goose. As he entered, a sound of revelry overhead smote his ear, and,  being no less astonished than in need of cordials, he hastened up-stairs  and flung open the door. A table stood there, furnished with jugs and  pipes and cans, and by light of candles that burned as blue as brimstone  could be seen the three gallows-birds from Gibbet Island, with halters on  their necks, clinking their tankards together and trolling forth a  drinking-song.    Starting back with affright as the corpses hailed him with lifted arms  and turned their fishy eyes on him, Vanderscamp slipped at the door and  fell headlong to the bottom of the stairs. Next morning he was found  there by the neighbors, dead to a certainty, and was put away in the  Dutch churchyard at Bergen on the Sunday following. As the house was  rifled and deserted by its occupants, it was hinted that the negro had  betrayed his master to his fellow-buccaneers, and that he, Pluto, was no  other than the devil in disguise. But he was not, for his skiff was seen  floating bottom up in the bay soon after, and his drowned body lodged  among the rocks at the foot of the pirates' gallows.    For a long time afterwards the island was regarded as a place that  required purging with bell, book, and candle, for shadows were reported  there and faint lights that shot into the air, and to this day, with the  great immigrant station on it and crowds going and coming all the time,  the Battery boatmen prefer not to row around it at night, for they are  likely to see the shades of the soldier and his mistress who were drowned  off the place one windy night, when the girl was aiding the fellow to  escape confinement in the guard-house, to say nothing of Vanderscamp and  his felons.          MISS BRITTON'S POKER    The maids of Staten Island wrought havoc among the royal troops who were  quartered among them during the Revolution. Near quarantine, in an old  house,--the Austen mansion,--a soldier of King George hanged himself  because a Yankee maid who lived there would not have him for a husband,  nor any gentleman whose coat was of his color; and, until ghosts went out  of fashion, his spirit, in somewhat heavy boots, with jingling spurs,  often disturbed the nightly quiet of the place.    The conduct of a damsel in the old town of Richmond was even more stern.  She was the granddaughter, and a pretty one, of a farmer named Britton;  but though Britton by descent and name, she was no friend of Britons,  albeit she might have had half the officers in the neighboring camp at  her feet, if she had wished them there. Once, while mulling a cup of  cider for her grandfather, she was interrupted by a self-invited  myrmidon, who undertook, in a fashion rude and unexpected, to show the  love in which he held her. Before he could kiss her, the girl drew the  hot poker from the mug of drink and jabbed at the vitals of her amorous  foe, burning a hole through his scarlet uniform and printing on his burly  person a lasting memento of the adventure. With a howl of pain the fellow  rushed away, and the privacy of the Britton family was never again  invaded, at least whilst cider was being mulled.          THE DEVIL'S STEPPING-STONES    When the devil set a claim to the fair lands at the north of Long Island  Sound, his claim was disputed by the Indians, who prepared to fight for  their homes should he attempt to serve his writ of ejectment. Parley  resulted in nothing, so the bad one tried force, but he was routed in  open fight and found it desirable to get away from the scene of action as  soon as possible. He retreated across the Sound near the head of East  River. The tide was out, so he stepped from island to island, without  trouble, and those reefs and islands are to this day the Devil's  Stepping-Stones. On reaching Throgg's Neck he sat down in a despairing  attitude and brooded on his defeat, until, roused to a frenzy at the  thought of it, he resolved to renew the war on terms advantageous  entirely to himself. In that day Connecticut was free from rocks, but  Long Island was covered with them; so he gathered all he could lay his  hands on and tossed them at the Indians that he could see across the  Sound near Cold Spring until the supply had given out. The red men who  last inhabited Connecticut used to show white men where the missiles  landed and where the devil struck his heel into the ground as he sprang  from the shore in his haste to reach Long Island. At Cold Spring other  footprints and one of his toes are shown. Establishing himself at Coram,  he troubled the people of the country for many years, so that between the  devil on the west and the Montauks on the east they were plagued indeed;  for though their guard at Watch Hill, Rhode Island, and other places  often apprised them of the coming of the Montauks, they never knew which  way to look for the devil.          THE SPRINGS OF BLOOD AND WATER    A great drought had fallen on Long Island, and the red men prayed for  water. It is true that they could get it at Lake Ronkonkoma, but some of  them were many miles from there, and, beside, they feared the spirits at  that place: the girl who plied its waters in a phosphor-shining birch,  seeking her recreant lover; and the powerful guardians that the Great  Spirit had put in charge to keep the fish from being caught, for these  fish were the souls of men, awaiting deliverance into another form. The  people gathered about their villages in bands and besought the Great  Spirit to give them drink. His voice was heard at last, bidding their  chief to shoot an arrow into the air and to watch where it fell, for  there would water gush out. The chief obeyed the deity, and as the arrow  touched the earth a spring of sweet water spouted into the air. Running  forward with glad cries the red men drank eagerly of the liquor, laved  their faces in it, and were made strong again; and in memory of that  event they called the place the Hill of God, or Manitou Hill, and Manet  or Manetta Hill it is to this day. Hereabouts the Indians settled and  lived in peace, thriving under the smile of their deity, making wampum  for the inland tribes and waxing rich with gains from it. They made the  canal from bay to sea at Canoe Place, that they might reach open water  without dragging their boats across the sand-bars, and in other ways they  proved themselves ingenious and strong.    When the English landed on the island they saw that the Indians were not  a people to be trifled with, and in order to properly impress them with  their superiority, they told them that John Bull desired a treaty with  them. The officers got them to sit in line in front of a cannon, the  nature of which instrument was unknown to them, and during the talk the  gun was fired, mowing down so many of the red people that the survivors  took to flight, leaving the English masters at the north shore, for this"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6622"],[0,"Legends That Every Child Should Know; a Selection of the Great Legends of All (#16)"],[1,"King Athelstan, who rejoiced to do him  honour; then he came to Warwick, where he received from Earl Rohand a  princely welcome. Then Sir Guy hastened to Felice.    \"Fair mistress,\" said he, \"have I now won your love? You have heard my  deeds, how I have travelled all through Christendom, and have yet found  no man stand against my spear. I have been faithful in my love, Felice,  as well as strong in fight. I might have wedded with the best. King's  daughters and princesses were prizes in the tournaments; but I had no  mind for any prize but thee. Say, is it mine, sweet mistress?\"    Then Felice kissed her knight and answered, \"Right nobly have you won my  love and worship, brave Sir Guy. You are more than my peer; you are  become my sovereign; and my love pays willing homage to its lord. But  for this same cause I will not wed you yet. I will not have men point at  me and say, 'There is a woman who for selfish love's sake, wedded the  knight of most renown in Christendom ere yet he did his bravest  deeds-drew him from his level to her own-made him lay by his sword and  spear for the slothful pleasures of a wedded life, and dwarfed a brave  man down to a soft gentleman.' Nay, dear one, I can wait, and very  proudly, knowing myself your chiefest prize. But seek not to possess the  prize too soon, lest your strivings for renown, being aimless, should  wax feeble. It is because I love you that I hold your fame far dearer  than my love. Go rather forth again, travel through heathen lands,  defend the weak against the strong; go, battle for the right, show  yourself the matchless knight you are; and God and my love go with  thee.\"    Then Sir Guy got him ready for his new quest. Earl Rohand tried to  persuade him to remain at home, as likewise did his father Segard; and  his mother, weeping, prayed him stay. She said, \"Another year it may not  fare so well with thee, my son. Leave well alone. Felice is cold and  proud and cares not for thee, else she would not risk thy life again.  What is it to her? If thou wert slain she would get another lover; we  have no more sons.\"    Yet would not Sir Guy be turned from his purpose, but embarked with his  companions, Sir Heraud, Sir Thorold, and Sir Urry, for Flanders. Thence  he rode through Spain, Germany, and Lombardy, and bore away the prize at  every tournament. But coming into Italy, he got a bad wound jousting at  Beneventum, which greatly weakened him.    Duke Otho of Pavia, whom Sir Guy overthrew in his first tournament at  Rouen, thought now to be avenged on him. So he set a chosen knight, Earl  Lombard, with fifteen other knights to lie in ambush in a wood and slay  Sir Guy; and as Sir Guy, with his three companions, came ambling slowly  through the wood, he smarting and well-nigh faint with his wound, the  men in ambush broke out from their concealment and called on him to  yield. The danger made him forget his pain, and straightway he dressed  his shield and spurred among them.    Sir Heraud, Sir Thorold, and Sir Urry killed the three first knights  they rode against. Then Earl Lombard slew Sir Urry; and at the same time  Hugo, nephew to Duke Otho, laid Sir Thorold dead at his horse's feet.  Then only Sir Guy and Sir Heraud being left to fight, Sir Guy attacked  Earl Lombard and smote him to the heart, whilst Sir Heraud chased Hugo,  fleeing like a hound, and drove his spear throughout his body. Thus were  Sir Urry and Sir Thorold avenged. But one of the felon knights, called  Sir Gunter, smote Sir Heraud a mighty stroke when he was off his guard,  and hewed his shield and coat of mail in pieces, and Sir Heraud fell to  the earth covered with blood and lay as dead.    Thereupon Sir Guy's anger waxed furious at his master's death; and he  spurred his horse so that fire rose from under its feet, and with one  blow of his sword cleft Sir Gunter from his helmet to the pummel of his  saddle. As for the other knights he slew them all except Sir Guichard,  who fled on his swift steed to Pavia, and got back to Duke Otho.    Heavily Sir Guy grieved for the loss of his three friends, but most of  all for his dear master Sir Heraud. He sought about the wood until he  found a hermit. To him he gave a good steed, charging him to bury the  bodies of Sir Urry and Sir Thorold. From Sir Heraud's body he would not  part. Lifting the old knight to his arms, he laid him across his horse,  and led the steed by the bridle-rein till they came to an abbey, where  he left the body with the abbot, promising rich presents in return for  giving it sumptuous burial with masses and chants. But Sir Guy departed  and hid himself in a hermit's cave away from the malice of Duke Otho,  until his wound should be healed.    Now there was in the abbey whither Heraud's body was taken, a monk well  skilled in leech-craft, who knew the virtues of all manner of grasses  and herbs. And this monk, finding by his craft that life still flickered  in the body, nursed and tended it; and after a long while Sir Heraud was  well enough to travel. Disguised as a palmer he came into Burgundy, and  there, to his great joy, found Sir Guy, who had come thither meaning to  take his way back to England. But they lingered still, till Heraud  should grow stronger, and so it fell out that they came to St. Omers.  There they heard how the Emperor Regnier had come up against Segwin,  Duke of Lavayne, laid waste his land, and besieged him in his strong  city Seysone, because he had slain Sadoc, the Emperor's cousin, in a  tournament. But when Sir Guy learned that Sadoc had first provoked Duke  Segwin, and brought his death upon himself, he determined to help Segwin  against his sovereign the Emperor Regnier. He therefore gathered fifty  knights together with Heraud, and coming secretly at night to the city  of Seysone, was let in at a postern gate without the enemy being aware.  In the morning after mass they made a sally against their foes, which  numbered thirty thousand strong, and routed them, taking many noble  prisoners. Three times the Emperor came against the Greeks, each time  with a new army larger than before. Twice did Sir Guy vanquish the host,  and drive them from the walls. The third time he took Sir Gaire, the  Emperor's son, prisoner, and carried him into the city. Then the Emperor  Regnier determined, since he could not take the place by assault, to  beleaguer it, and starve the town into surrender. And it was so that,  while his army was set down before the walls, the Emperor hunted alone  in a wood hard by, and Sir Guy, meeting him there, gathered a branch of  olive tree, and came bending to the Emperor, saying, \"God save you,  gentle sire. Duke Segwin sendeth me to make his peace with you. He will  yield you all his lands and castles in burg and city, and hold them of  you henceforth in vassalage, but he now would have your presence in the  city to a feast.\" So the Emperor was forced to go with him into the city  as a prisoner, albeit he was served with the humility due to a sovereign  both by Sir Guy and Duke Segwin's knights. Sir Gaire and the other  captive nobles came also and prayed for peace with Duke Segwin, for they  had been so well treated that they felt nothing but the truest  friendship for their captor. So it befell when the Emperor found himself  feasting in the enemy's castle, surrounded by the flower of his own  knights and nobles, and Duke Segwin and his band serving them humbly at  table as though they had been servants in place of masters, he was  touched by their generosity, and willingly agreed to a free and friendly  peace. And this was celebrated by the Emperor giving Duke Segwin his  niece to wife, whilst the Duke of Saxony wedded Duke Segwin's sister  amid great rejoicings.    Now after this, learning that Ernis, Emperor of Greece, was besieged in  Constantinople his capital by the Saracens, Sir Guy levied an army of a  thousand knights and went to his assistance. Well pleased was Ernis at  so timely a succor, and he promised to reward Sir Guy by making him heir  to the throne and giving him the hand of his only daughter the beautiful  Loret. Then Sir Guy led the army forth from the city against the Soudan  and his host, and defeated them so badly that for some days they were  unable to rally their men for another encounter.    In the meantime, one of Sir Guy's knights named Sir Morgadour fell in  love with the Princess Loret, and being envious of Sir Guy's  achievements as well as jealous of such a rival, he sought how to  embroil him with the Emperor and compass his disgrace. Wherefore one day  when the Emperor Ernis was gone a-rivering with his hawks, Sir Morgadour  challenged Sir Guy to play a game of chess in the Princess Loret's  chamber. They played there, Sir Guy not thinking of treachery. But  by-and-by the Princess entered, and Sir Morgadour after greeting her  took his leave quickly and came to the Emperor Ernis, telling him how  Sir Guy was alone in the chamber with his daughter. Ernis, however, paid  little heed to the tale, for he said: \"Well, and what of it? Loret is  his promised bride, and Sir Guy is a good true knight. Away with your  tales!\" But Sir Morgadour was not to be baffled, so he went to Sir Guy  and said: \"Behold how little trust is to be placed in a king! Here is  the Emperor Ernis mad wroth to hear you were alone with the Princess  Loret, and swears he will have your life.\" Then Sir Guy in great anger  summoned his knights, and was going over to the Saracens, when, on his  way, he met the Emperor, who told him of the malice of Sir Morgadour and  all was made plain.    But now the Saracens coming anew against the city, Sir Guy went forth to  meet them with many engines upon wheels which threw great stones  quarried from a hill. Sir Guy and his army again defeated the Saracens,  insomuch that a space of fifteen acres was covered so thick with dead  that a man might not walk between, whilst the pile of slain around Sir  Guy reached breast high.
