ESCAPE OF ROB ROY FROM THE DUKE OF ATHOLE.    The following copy of a letter which passed from one clergyman of the  Church of Scotland to another, was communicated to me by John Gregorson,  Esq. of Ardtornish. The escape of Rob Roy is mentioned, like other  interesting news of the time with which it is intermingled. The  disagreement between the Dukes of Athole and Argyle seems to have  animated the former against Rob Roy, as one of Argyle's partisans.    \"Rev. and dear Brother,    Yrs of the 28th Jun I had by the bearer. Im pleased yo have got back  again yr Delinquent which may probably safe you of the trouble of her  child. I'm sory I've yet very little of certain news to give you from  Court tho' I've seen all the last weekes prints, only I find in them a  pasage which is all the account I can give you of the Indemnity yt when  the estates of forfaulted Rebells Comes to be sold all Just debts  Documented are to be preferred to Officers of the Court of enquiry. The  Bill in favours of that Court against the Lords of Session in Scotland in  past the house of Commons and Come before the Lords which is thought to  be considerably more ample yn formerly wt respect to the Disposeing of  estates Canvassing and paying of Debts. It's said yt the examinations of  Cadugans accounts is droped but it wants Confirmations here as yet.  Oxford's tryals should be entered upon Saturday last. We hear that the  Duchess of Argyle is wt child. I doe not hear yt the Divisions at Court  are any thing abated or of any appearance of the Dukes having any thing  of his Maj: favour. I heartily wish the present humours at Court may not  prove an encouragmt to watchfull and restles enemies.    My accounts of Rob Roy his escape are yt after severall Embassies between  his Grace (who I hear did Correspond wt some at Court about it) and Rob  he at length upon promise of protectione Came to waite upon the Duke &  being presently secured his Grace sent post to Edr to acquent the Court  of his being aprehended & call his friends at Edr and to desire a party  from Gen Carpinter to receive and bring him to Edr which party came the  length of Kenross in Fife, he was to be delivered to them by a party his  Grace had demanded from the Governour at Perth, who when upon their march  towards Dunkell to receive him, were mete wt and returned by his Grace  having resolved to deliver him by a party of his own men and left Rob at  Logierate under a strong guard till yt party should be ready to receive  him. This space of time Rob had Imployed in taking the other dram  heartily wt the Guard & qn all were pretty hearty, Rob is delivering a  letter for his wife to a servant to whom he most needs deliver some  private instructions at the Door (for his wife) where he's attended wt on  the Guard. When serious in this privat Conversations he is making some  few steps carelessly from the Door about the house till he comes close by  this horse which he soon mounted and made off. This is no small  mortifican to the guard because of the delay it give to there hopes of a  Considerable additionall charge agt John Roy.* my wife was upon Thursday  last delivered of a Son after sore travell of which she still continues  very weak.    * _i.e._ John the Red--John Duke of Argyle, so called from his  complexion, more commonly styled \"Red John the Warriour.\"    I give yl Lady hearty thanks for the Highland plaid. It's good cloath but  it does not answer the sett I sent some time agae wt McArthur & tho it  had I told in my last yt my wife was obliged to provid herself to finish  her bed before she was lighted but I know yt letr came not timely to yr  hand--I'm sory I had not mony to send by the bearer having no thought of  it & being exposed to some little expenses last week but I expect some  sure occasion when order by a letter to receive it excuse this freedom  from &c.    \"_Manse of Comrie, July_ 2_d,_ 1717.  \"I salute yr lady I wish my ............ her Daughter much Joy.\"          No. V.--HIGHLAND WOOING.    There are many productions of the Scottish Ballad Poets upon the  lion-like mode of wooing practised by the ancient Highlanders when they  had a fancy for the person (or property) of a Lowland damsel. One example  is found in Mr. Robert Jamieson's Popular Scottish Songs:--                            Bonny Babby Livingstone                          Gaed out to see the kye,                          And she has met with Glenlyon,                          Who has stolen her away.                            He took free her her sattin coat,                          But an her silken gown,                          Syne roud her in his tartan plaid,                          And happd her round and roun'.    In another ballad we are told how--                           Four-and-twenty Hieland men,                         Came doun by Fiddoch Bide,                         And they have sworn a deadly aith,                         Jean Muir suld be a bride:                           And they have sworn a deadly aith,                         Ilke man upon his durke,                         That she should wed with Duncan Ger,                         Or they'd make bloody works.    This last we have from tradition, but there are many others in the  collections of Scottish Ballads to the same purpose.    The achievement of Robert Oig, or young Rob Roy, as the Lowlanders called  him, was celebrated in a ballad, of which there are twenty different and  various editions. The tune is lively and wild, and we select the  following words from memory:--                      Rob Roy is frae the Hielands come,                        Down to the Lowland border;                     And he has stolen that lady away,                        To haud his house in order.                       He set her on a milk-white steed,                         Of none he stood in awe;                     Untill they reached the Hieland hills,                               Aboon the Balmaha'!*    * A pass on the eastern margin of Loch Lomond, and an entrance to the  Highlands.                            Saying, Be content, be content,                         Be content with me, lady;                        Where will ye find in Lennox land,                        Sae braw a man as me, lady?                          Rob Roy he was my father called,                        MacGregor was his name, lady;                        A' the country, far and near,                        Have heard MacGregor's fame, lady.                          He was a hedge about his friends,                        A heckle to his foes, lady;                        If any man did him gainsay,                        He felt his deadly blows, lady.                          I am as bold, I am as bold,                        I am as bold and more, lady;                        Any man that doubts my word,                        May try my gude claymore, lady.                           Then be content, be content.                         Be content with me, lady;                         For now you are my wedded wife,                         Until the day you die, lady.          No. VI--GHLUNE DHU.    The following notices concerning this Chief fell under the Author's eye  while the sheets were in the act of going through the press. They occur  in manuscript memoirs, written by a person intimately acquainted with the  incidents of 1745.    This Chief had the important task intrusted to him of defending the  Castle of Doune, in which the Chevalier placed a garrison to protect his  communication with the Highlands, and to repel any sallies which might be  made from Stirling Castle--Ghlune Dhu distinguished himself by his good  conduct in this charge.    Ghlune Dhu is thus described:--\"Glengyle is, in person, a tall handsome  man, and has more of the mien of the ancient heroes than our modern fine  gentlemen are possessed of. He is honest and disinterested to a  proverb--extremely modest--brave and intrepid--and born one of the best  partisans in Europe. In short, the whole people of that country declared  that never did men live under so mild a government as Glengyle's, not a  man having so much as lost a chicken while he continued there.\"    It would appear from this curious passage, that Glengyle--not Stewart of  Balloch, as averred in a note on Waverley--commanded the garrison of  Doune. Balloch might, no doubt, succeed MacGregor in the situation.          EDITOR'S INTRODUCTION TO ROB ROY    In the magnum opus, the author's final edition of the Waverley Novels,  \"Rob Roy\" appears out of its chronological order, and comes next after  \"The Antiquary.\" In this, as in other matters, the present edition  follows that of 1829. \"The Antiquary,\" as we said, contained in its  preface the author's farewell to his art. This valediction was meant as  prelude to a fresh appearance in a new disguise. Constable, who had  brought out the earlier works, did not publish the \"Tales of my Landlord\"  (\"The Black Dwarf\" and \"Old Mortality \"), which Scott had nearly finished  by November 12, 1816. The four volumes appeared from the houses of Mr.  Murray and Mr. Blackwood, on December 1, 1816. Within less than a month  came out \"Harold the Dauntless,\" by the author of \"The Bridal of  Triermain.\" Scott's work on the historical part of the \"Annual Register\"  had also been unusually arduous. At Abbotsford, or at Ashiestiel, his  mode of life was particularly healthy; in Edinburgh, between the claims  of the courts, of literature, and of society, he was scarcely ever in the  open air. Thus"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7028"],[0,"The Clicking of Cuthbert (#16)"],[1,"impress itself on me that his eye was  brighter, his jaw squarer, his carriage a trifle more upright than it  had been. But it was his eye that struck me most forcibly. The George  Mackintosh I had known had had a pleasing gaze, but, though frank and  agreeable, it had never been more dynamic than a fried egg. This new  George had an eye that was a combination of a gimlet and a searchlight.  Coleridge's Ancient Mariner, I imagine, must have been somewhat  similarly equipped. The Ancient Mariner stopped a wedding guest on his  way to a wedding; George Mackintosh gave me the impression that he  could have stopped the Cornish Riviera express on its way to Penzance.  Self-confidence--aye, and more than self-confidence--a sort of sinful,  overbearing swank seemed to exude from his very pores.    \"Crawled?\" he said. \"Well, he didn't actually lick my boots, because I  saw him coming and side-stepped; but he did everything short of that. I  hadn't been talking an hour when----\"    \"An hour!\" I gasped. \"Did you talk for an hour?\"    \"Certainly. You wouldn't have had me be abrupt, would you? I went into  his private office and found him alone. I think at first he would have  been just as well pleased if I had retired. In fact, he said as much.  But I soon adjusted that outlook. I took a seat and a cigarette, and  then I started to sketch out for him the history of my connection with  the firm. He began to wilt before the end of the first ten minutes. At  the quarter of an hour mark he was looking at me like a lost dog that's  just found its owner. By the half-hour he was making little bleating  noises and massaging my coat-sleeve. And when, after perhaps an hour  and a half, I came to my peroration and suggested a rise, he choked  back a sob, gave me double what I had asked, and invited me to dine at  his club next Tuesday. I'm a little sorry now I cut the thing so short.  A few minutes more, and I fancy he would have given me his  sock-suspenders and made over his life-insurance in my favour.\"    \"Well,\" I said, as soon as I could speak, for I was finding my young  friend a trifle overpowering, \"this is most satisfactory.\"    \"So-so,\" said George. \"Not un-so-so. A man wants an addition to his  income when he is going to get married.\"    \"Ah!\" I said. \"That, of course, will be the real test.\"    \"What do you mean?\"    \"Why, when you propose to Celia Tennant. You remember you were saying  when we spoke of this before--\"    \"Oh, that!\" said George, carelessly. \"I've arranged all that.\"    \"What!\"    \"Oh, yes. On my way up from the station. I looked in on Celia about an  hour ago, and it's all settled.\"    \"Amazing!\"    \"Well, I don't know. I just put the thing to her, and she seemed to see  it.\"    \"I congratulate you. So now, like Alexander, you have no more worlds to  conquer.\"    \"Well, I don't know so much about that,\" said George. \"The way it looks to  me is that I'm just starting. This eloquence is a thing that rather grows  on one. You didn't hear about my after-dinner speech at the anniversary  banquet of the firm, I suppose? My dear fellow, a riot! A positive  stampede. Had 'em laughing and then crying and then laughing again and  then crying once more till six of 'em had to be led out and the rest down  with hiccoughs. Napkins waving ... three tables broken ... waiters in  hysterics. I tell you, I played on them as on a stringed instrument....\"    \"Can you play on a stringed instrument?\"    \"As it happens, no. But as I would have played on a stringed instrument  if I could play on a stringed instrument. Wonderful sense of power it  gives you. I mean to go in pretty largely for that sort of thing in  future.\"    \"You must not let it interfere with your golf.\"    He gave a laugh which turned my blood cold.    \"Golf!\" he said. \"After all, what is golf? Just pushing a small ball  into a hole. A child could do it. Indeed, children have done it with  great success. I see an infant of fourteen has just won some sort of  championship. Could that stripling convulse a roomful of banqueters? I  think not! To sway your fellow-men with a word, to hold them with a  gesture ... that is the real salt of life. I don't suppose I shall play  much more golf now. I'm making arrangements for a lecturing-tour, and  I'm booked up for fifteen lunches already.\"    Those were his words. A man who had once done the lake-hole in one. A  man whom the committee were grooming for the amateur championship. I am  no weakling, but I confess they sent a chill shiver down my spine.           *       *       *       *       *    George Mackintosh did not, I am glad to say, carry out his mad project  to the letter. He did not altogether sever himself from golf. He was  still to be seen occasionally on the links. But now--and I know of  nothing more tragic that can befall a man--he found himself gradually  shunned, he who in the days of his sanity had been besieged with more  offers of games than he could manage to accept. Men simply would not  stand his incessant flow of talk. One by one they dropped off, until  the only person he could find to go round with him was old Major  Moseby, whose hearing completely petered out as long ago as the year  '98. And, of course, Celia Tennant would play with him occasionally;  but it seemed to me that even she, greatly as no doubt she loved him,  was beginning to crack under the strain.    So surely had I read the pallor of her face and the wild look of dumb  agony in her eyes that I was not surprised when, as I sat one morning  in my garden reading Ray on Taking Turf, my man announced her name. I  had been half expecting her to come to me for advice and consolation,  for I had known her ever since she was a child. It was I who had given  her her first driver and taught her infant lips to lisp \"Fore!\" It is  not easy to lisp the word \"Fore!\" but I had taught her to do it, and  this constituted a bond between us which had been strengthened rather  than weakened by the passage of time.    She sat down on the grass beside my chair, and looked up at my face in  silent pain. We had known each other so long that I know that it was  not my face that pained her, but rather some unspoken _malaise_ of  the soul. I waited for her to speak, and suddenly she burst out  impetuously as though she could hold back her sorrow no longer.    \"Oh, I can't stand it! I can't stand it!\"    \"You mean...?\" I said, though I knew only too well.    \"This horrible obsession of poor George's,\" she cried passionately. \"I  don't think he has stopped talking once since we have been engaged.\"    \"He _is_ chatty,\" I agreed. \"Has he told you the story about the  Irishman?\"    \"Half a dozen times. And the one about the Swede oftener than that. But  I would not mind an occasional anecdote. Women have to learn to bear  anecdotes from the men they love. It is the curse of Eve. It is his  incessant easy flow of chatter on all topics that is undermining even  my devotion.\"    \"But surely, when he proposed to you, he must have given you an inkling  of the truth. He only hinted at it when he spoke to me, but I gather  that he was eloquent.\"    \"When he proposed,\" said Celia dreamily, \"he was wonderful. He spoke  for twenty minutes without stopping. He said I was the essence of his  every hope, the tree on which the fruit of his life grew; his Present,  his Future, his Past ... oh, and all that sort of thing. If he would  only confine his conversation now to remarks of a similar nature, I  could listen to him all day long. But he doesn't. He talks politics and  statistics and philosophy and ... oh, and everything. He makes my head  ache.\"    \"And your heart also, I fear,\" I said gravely.    \"I love him!\" she replied simply. \"In spite of everything, I love him  dearly. But what to do? What to do? I have an awful fear that when we  are getting married instead of answering 'I will,' he will go into the  pulpit and deliver an address on Marriage Ceremonies of All Ages. The  world to him is a vast lecture-platform. He looks on life as one long  after-dinner, with himself as the principal speaker of the evening. It  is breaking my heart. I see him shunned by his former friends. Shunned!  They run a mile when they see him coming. The mere sound of his voice  outside the club-house is enough to send brave men diving for safety  beneath the sofas. Can you wonder that I am in despair? What have I to  live for?\"    \"There is always golf.\"    \"Yes, there is always golf,\" she whispered bravely.    \"Come and have a round this afternoon.\"    \"I had promised to go for a walk ...\" She shuddered, then pulled herself  together. \"... for a walk with George.\"    I hesitated for a moment.    \"Bring him along,\" I said, and patted her hand. \"It may be that  together we shall find an opportunity of reasoning with him.\"    She shook her head.    \"You can't reason with George. He never stops talking long enough to  give you time.\"    \"Nevertheless, there is no harm in trying. I have an idea that this  malady of his is not permanent and incurable. The very violence with  which the germ of loquacity has attacked him gives me hope. You must  remember that before this seizure he was rather a noticeably silent  man. Sometimes I think that it is just Nature's way of restoring the  average, and that soon the fever may burn itself out. Or it may be that  a sudden shock ... At any rate, have courage.\"    \"I will try to be brave.\"    \"Capital! At half-past two on the first tee, then.\"    \"You will have to give me a stroke on the third, ninth, twelfth,  fifteenth, sixteenth and eighteenth,\" she said, with a quaver in her  voice. \"My golf has fallen off rather lately.\"    I patted her hand again.    \"I understand,\" I said gently. \"I understand.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The steady drone of a baritone voice as I alighted from my car and  approached the first tee told me that George had not forgotten the  tryst. He was sitting on the stone seat under the chestnut-tree,"]]]
