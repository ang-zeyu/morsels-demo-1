When such wavering spirits are engaged  in the bitter combat with the harsh alternatives of life, or tempted at  every turn by its insinuating seductions, what a profound discouragement  seizes upon them when they are induced to believe that the hearts  devoted to the most sublime thoughts, the most deeply initiated in  the most delicate susceptibilities, the most charmed by the beauty of  innocence, have denied, by their acts, the sincerity of their worship  for the noble themes which they have sung as poets! With what agonizing  doubts are they not filled by such flagrant contradictions! How much  is their anguish increased by the jeering mockery of those who repeat:  \"Poetry is only that which might have been\"--and who delight in  blaspheming it by their guilty negations! Whatever may be the human  short-comings of the gifted, believe the truths they sing! Poetry is  more than the gigantic shadow of our own imagination, immeasurably  increased, and projected upon the flying plane of the Impossible. POETRY  and REALITY are not two incompatible elements, destined to move on  together without commingling. Goethe himself confesses this. In speaking  of a contemporary writer he says: \"that having lived to create poems,  he had also made his life a Poem.\" (Er lebte dichtend, und dichtete  lebend.) Goethe was himself too true a poet not to know that Poetry  only is, because its eternal Reality throbs in the noble impulses of the  human heart.    We have once before remarked that \"genius imposes its own obligations.\"  [Footnote: Upon Paganini, after his death.] If the examples of cold  austerity and of rigid disinterestedness are sufficient to awaken the  admiration of calm and reflective natures, whence shall more passionate  and mobile organizations, to whom the dullness of mediocrity is insipid,  who naturally seek honor or pleasure, and who are willing to purchase  the object of their desires at any price--form their models? Such  temperaments easily free themselves from the authority of their seniors.  They do not admit their competency to decide. They accuse them of  wishing to use the world only for the profit of their own dead passions,  of striving to turn all to their own advantage, of pronouncing upon  the effects of causes which they do not understand, of desiring to  promulgate laws in spheres to which nature has denied them entrance.  They will not receive answers from their lips, but turn to others to  resolve their doubts; they question those who have drunk deeply from the  boiling springs of grief, bursting from the riven clefts in the steep  cliffs upon the top of which alone the soul seeks rest and light. They  pass in silence by the still cold gravity of those who practice the  good, without enthusiasm for the beautiful. What leisure has ardent  youth to interpret their gravity, to resolve their chill problems?  The throbbings of its impetuous heart are too rapid to allow it to  investigate the hidden sufferings, the mystic combats, the solitary  struggles, which may be detected even in the calm eye of the man who  practices only the good. Souls in continual agitation seldom interpret  aright the calm simplicity of the just, or the heroic smiles of the  stoic. For them enthusiasm and emotion are necessities. A bold image  persuades them, a metaphor leads them, tears convince them, they prefer  the conclusions of impulse, of intuition, to the fatigue of logical  argument. Thus they turn with an eager curiosity to the poets and  artists who have moved them by their images, allured them by their  metaphors, excited them by their enthusiasm. They demand from them the  explanation, the purpose of this enthusiasm, the secret of this beauty!    When distracted by heart-rending events, when tortured by intense  suffering, when feeling and enthusiasm seem to be but a heavy and  cumbersome load which may upset the life-boat if not thrown overboard  into the abyss of forgetfulness; who, when menaced with utter shipwreck  after a long struggle with peril, has not evoked the glorious shades  of those who have conquered, whose thoughts glow with noble ardor, to  inquire from them how far their aspirations were sincere, how long they  preserved their vitality and truth? Who has not exerted an ingenious  discernment to ascertain how much of the generous feeling depicted  was only for mental amusement, a mere speculation; how much had really  become incorporated with the habitual acts of life? Detraction is never  idle in such cases; it seizes eagerly upon the foibles, the neglect, the  faults of those who have been degraded by any weakness: alas, it omits  nothing! It chases its prey, it accumulates facts only to distort them,  it arrogates to itself the right of despising the inspiration to which  it will grant no authority or aim but to furnish amusement, denying  it any claim to guide our actions, our resolutions, our refusal, our  consent! Detraction knows well how to winnow history! Casting aside all  the good grain, it carefully gathers all the tares, to scatter the black  seed over the brilliant pages in which the purest desires of the heart,  the noblest dreams of the imagination are found; and with the irony of  assumed victory, demands what the grain is worth which only germinates  dearth and famine? Of what value the vain words, which only nourish  sterile feelings? Of what use are excursions into realms in which  no real fruit can ever be gathered? of what possible importance are  emotions and enthusiasm, which always end in calculations of interest,  covering only with brilliant veil the covert struggles of egotism and  venal self-interest?    With how much arrogant derision men given to such detraction, contrast  the noble thoughts of the poet, with his unworthy acts! The high  compositions of the artist, with his guilty frivolity! What a haughty  superiority they assume over the laborious merit of the men of guileless  honesty, whom they look upon as crustacea, sheltered from temptation  by the immobility of weak organizations, as well as over the pride of  those, who, believing themselves superior to such temptations, do not,  they assert, succeed even as well as themselves in repudiating the  pursuit of material well being, the gratification of vanity, or the  pleasure of immediate enjoyment! What an easy triumph they win over the  hesitation, the doubt, the repugnance of those who would fain cling to  a belief in the possibility of the union of vivid feelings, passionate  impressions, intellectual gifts, imaginative temperaments, with high  integrity, pure lives, and courses of conduct in perfect harmony with  poetic ideals!    It is therefore impossible not to feel the deepest sadness when we meet  with any fact which shows us the poet disobedient to the inspiration  of the Muses, those guardian angels of the man of genius, who would  willingly teach him to make of his own life the most beautiful of  poems. What disastrous doubts in the minds of others, what profound  discouragements, what melancholy apostasies are induced by the faltering  steps of the man of genius! And yet it would be profanity to confound  his errors in the same anathema, hurled against the base vices of  meanness, the shameless effrontery of low crime! It would be sacrilege!  If the acts of the poet have sometimes denied the spirit of his song,  have not his songs still more powerfully denied his acts? May not  the limited influence of his private actions have been far more than  counterbalanced by the germs of creative virtues, scattered profusely  through his eloquent writings? Evil is contagious, but good is truly  fruitful! The poet, even while forcing his inner convictions to give way  to his personal interest, still acknowledges and ennobles the sentiments  which condemn himself; such sentiments attain a far wider influence  through his works than can be exerted by his individual acts. Are not  the number of spirits which have been calmed, consoled, edified, through  these works, far greater than the number of those who have been injured  by the errors of his private life? Art is far more powerful than the  artist. His creations have a life independent of his vacillating will;  for they are revelations of the \"immutable beauty!\" More durable than  himself, they pass on from generation to generation; let us hope that  they may, through the blessings of their widely spread influence,  contain a virtual power of redemption for the frequent errors of  their gifted authors. If it be indeed true that many of those who have  immortalized their sensibility and their aspirations, by robing them in  the garb of surpassing eloquence, have, nevertheless, stifled these high  aspirations, abused these quick sensibilities,--how many have they not  confirmed, strengthened and encouraged to pursue a noble course, through  the works created by their genius! A generous indulgence towards them  would be but justice! It is hard to be forced to claim simple justice  for them; unpleasant to be constrained to defend those whom we wish to  be admired, to excuse those whom we wish to see venerated!    With what exultant feelings of just pride may the friend and artist  remember a career in which there are no jarring dissonances; no  contradictions, for which he is forced to claim indulgence; no errors,  whose source must be found in palliation of their existence; no extreme,  to be accounted for as the consequence of \"excess of cause.\" How sweet  it is to be able to name one who has fully proved that it is not only  apathetic beings whom no fascination can attract, no illusion betray,  who are able to limit themselves within the strict routine of honored  and honorable laws, who may justly claim that elevation of soul, which  no reverse subdues, and which is never "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4389"],[0,"Roughing It in the Bush (#16)"],[1," one was at leisure to regard her  laudable endeavours to make herself heard--the door was suddenly  pushed open, and the apparition of a woman squeezed itself into the  crowded room. I left off arranging the furniture of a bed, that had  been just put up in a corner, to meet my unexpected, and at that  moment, not very welcome guest. Her whole appearance was so  extraordinary that I felt quite at a loss how to address her.    Imagine a girl of seventeen or eighteen years of age, with sharp,  knowing-looking features, a forward, impudent carriage, and a pert,  flippant voice, standing upon one of the trunks, and surveying all  our proceedings in the most impertinent manner. The creature was  dressed in a ragged, dirty purple stuff gown, cut very low in the  neck, with an old red cotton handkerchief tied over her head; her  uncombed, tangled locks falling over her thin, inquisitive face, in  a state of perfect nature. Her legs and feet were bare, and, in her  coarse, dirty red hands, she swung to and fro an empty glass  decanter.    \"What can she want?\" I asked myself. \"What a strange creature!\"    And there she stood, staring at me in the most unceremonious manner,  her keen black eyes glancing obliquely to every corner of the room,  which she examined with critical exactness.    Before I could speak to her, she commenced the conversation by  drawling through her nose, \"Well, I guess you are fixing here.\"    I thought she had come to offer her services; and I told her that  I did not want a girl, for I had brought one out with me.    \"How!\" responded the creature, \"I hope you don't take me for a help.  I'd have you to know that I'm as good a lady as yourself. No; I just  stepped over to see what was going on. I seed the teams pass our'n  about noon, and I says to father, 'Them strangers are cum; I'll go  and look arter them.' 'Yes,' says he, 'do--and take the decanter  along. May be they'll want one to put their whiskey in.' 'I'm goin  to,' says I; so I cum across with it, an' here it is. But,  mind--don't break it--'tis the only one we have to hum; and father  says 'tis so mean to drink out of green glass.\"    My surprise increased every minute. It seemed such an act of  disinterested generosity thus to anticipate wants we had never  thought of. I was regularly taken in.    \"My good girl,\" I began, \"this is really very kind--but--\"    \"Now, don't go to call me 'gall'--and pass off your English airs  on us. We are _genuine_ Yankees, and think ourselves as good--yes,  a great deal better than you. I am a young lady.\"    \"Indeed!\" said I, striving to repress my astonishment. \"I am a  stranger in the country, and my acquaintance with Canadian ladies  and gentlemen is very small. I did not mean to offend you by using  the term girl; I was going to assure you that we had no need of the  decanter. We have bottles of our own--and we don't drink whiskey.\"    \"How! Not drink whiskey? Why, you don't say! How ignorant you must  be! may be they have no whiskey in the old country?\"    \"Yes, we have; but it is not like the Canadian whiskey. But, pray  take the decanter home again--I am afraid that it will get broken  in this confusion.\"    \"No, no; father told me to leave it--and there it is;\" and she  planted it resolutely down on the trunk. \"You will find a use for  it till you have unpacked your own.\"    Seeing that she was determined to leave the bottle, I said no more  about it, but asked her to tell me where the well was to be found.    \"The well!\" she repeated after me, with a sneer. \"Who thinks of  digging wells when they can get plenty of water from the creek?  There is a fine water privilege not a stone's-throw from the door,\"  and, jumping off the box, she disappeared as abruptly as she had  entered. We all looked at each other; Tom Wilson was highly amused,  and laughed until he held his sides.    \"What tempted her to bring this empty bottle here?\" said Moodie.  \"It is all an excuse; the visit, Tom, was meant for you.\"    \"You'll know more about it in a few days,\" said James, looking up  from his work. \"That bottle is not brought here for nought.\"    I could not unravel the mystery, and thought no more about it, until  it was again brought to my recollection by the damsel herself.    Our united efforts had effected a complete transformation in our  uncouth dwelling. Sleeping-berths had been partitioned off for the  men; shelves had been put up for the accommodation of books and  crockery, a carpet covered the floor, and the chairs and tables we  had brought from ---- gave an air of comfort to the place, which, on  the first view of it, I deemed impossible. My husband, Mr. Wilson,  and James, had walked over to inspect the farm, and I was sitting at  the table at work, the baby creeping upon the floor, and Hannah  preparing dinner. The sun shone warm and bright, and the open door  admitted a current of fresh air, which tempered the heat of the fire.    \"Well, I guess you look smart,\" said the Yankee damsel, presenting  herself once more before me. \"You old country folks are so stiff,  you must have every thing nice, or you fret. But, then, you can  easily do it; you have stacks of money; and you can fix everything  right off with money.\"    \"Pray take a seat,\" and I offered her a chair, \"and be kind enough  to tell me your name. I suppose you must live in the neighbourhood,  although I cannot perceive any dwelling near us.\"    \"My name! So you want to know my name. I arn't ashamed of my own;  'tis Emily S----. I am eldest daughter to the _gentleman_ who owns  this house.\"    \"What must the father be,\" thought I, \"if he resembles the young  _lady_, his daughter?\"    Imagine a young lady, dressed in ragged petticoats, through whose  yawning rents peeped forth, from time to time, her bare red knees,  with uncombed elf-locks, and a face and hands that looked as if they  had been unwashed for a month--who did not know A from B, and  despised those who did. While these reflections, combined with a  thousand ludicrous images, were flitting through my mind, my strange  visitor suddenly exclaimed--    \"Have you done with that 'ere decanter I brought across yesterday?\"    \"Oh, yes! I have no occasion for it.\" I rose, took it from the  shelf, and placed it in her hand.    \"I guess you won't return it empty; that would be mean, father says.  He wants it filled with whiskey.\"    The mystery was solved, the riddle made clear. I could contain my  gravity no longer, but burst into a hearty fit of laughter, in which  I was joined by Hannah. Our young lady was mortally offended; she  tossed the decanter from hand to hand, and glared at us with her  tiger-like eyes.    \"You think yourselves smart! Why do you laugh in that way?\"    \"Excuse me--but you have such an odd way of borrowing that I cannot  help it. This bottle, it seems, was brought over for your own  convenience, not for mine. I am sorry to disappoint you, but I have  no whiskey.\"    \"I guess spirits will do as well; I know there is some in that keg,  for I smells it.\"    \"It contains rum for the workmen.\"    \"Better still. I calculate when you've been here a few months,  you'll be too knowing to give rum to your helps. But old country  folks are all fools, and that's the reason they get so easily sucked  in, and be so soon wound-up. Cum, fill the bottle, and don't be  stingy. In this country we all live by borrowing. If you want  anything, why just send and borrow from us.\"    Thinking that this might be the custom of the country, I hastened to  fill the decanter, hoping that I might get a little new milk for the  poor weanling child in return; but when I asked my liberal visitor  if she kept cows, and would lend me a little new milk for the baby,  she burst out into high disdain. \"Milk! Lend milk? I guess milk in  the fall is worth a York shilling a quart. I cannot sell you a drop  under.\"    This was a wicked piece of extortion, as the same article in the  town, where, of course, it was in greater request, only brought  three-pence the quart.    \"If you'll pay me for it, I'll bring you some to-morrow. But  mind--cash down.\"    \"And when do you mean to return the rum?\" I said, with some  asperity.    \"When father goes to the creek.\" This was the name given by my  neighbours to the village of P----, distant about four miles.    Day after day I was tormented by this importunate creature; she  borrowed of me tea, sugar, candles, starch, blueing, irons, pots,  bowls--in short, every article in common domestic use--while it was  with the utmost difficulty we could get them returned. Articles of  food, such as tea and sugar, or of convenience, like candles,  starch, and soap, she never dreamed of being required at her hands.  This method of living upon their neighbours is a most convenient one  to unprincipled people, as it does not involve the penalty of  stealing; and they can keep the goods without the unpleasant  necessity of returning them, or feeling the moral obligation of  being grateful for their use. Living eight miles from ----, I found  these constant encroachments a heavy burden on our poor purse; and  being ignorant of the country, and residing in such a lonely,  out-of-the-way place, surrounded by these savages, I was really  afraid of denying their requests.    The very day our new plough came home, the father of this bright  damsel, who went by the familiar and unenviable title of Old Satan,  came over to borrow it (though we afterwards found out that he had a  good one of his own). The land had never been broken up, and was  full of rocks and stumps, and he was anxious to save his own from  injury; the consequence was that the borrowed implement came home  unfit for use, just at the very time that we wanted to plough for  fall wheat. The same happened to a spade and trowel, bought in  order to plaster the house. Satan asked the loan of them for _one_  hour for the same purpose, and we never saw them again.    The daughter came one morning, as usual, on one "]]]
