Then _in one sense_ it may be said that  whiteness is 'in our mind'. We have here the same ambiguity as we noted  in discussing Berkeley in Chapter IV. In the strict sense, it is not  whiteness that is in our mind, but the act of thinking of whiteness. The  connected ambiguity in the word 'idea', which we noted at the same time,  also causes confusion here. In one sense of this word, namely the sense  in which it denotes the _object_ of an act of thought, whiteness is an  'idea'. Hence, if the ambiguity is not guarded against, we may come to  think that whiteness is an 'idea' in the other sense, i.e. an act of  thought; and thus we come to think that whiteness is mental. But in so  thinking, we rob it of its essential quality of universality. One man's  act of thought is necessarily a different thing from another man's; one  man's act of thought at one time is necessarily a different thing from  the same man's act of thought at another time. Hence, if whiteness were  the thought as opposed to its object, no two different men could think  of it, and no one man could think of it twice. That which many different  thoughts of whiteness have in common is their _object_, and this object  is different from all of them. Thus universals are not thoughts, though  when known they are the objects of thoughts.    We shall find it convenient only to speak of things _existing_ when they  are in time, that is to say, when we can point to some time at which  they exist (not excluding the possibility of their existing at all  times). Thus thoughts and feelings, minds and physical objects exist.  But universals do not exist in this sense; we shall say that they  _subsist_ or _have being_, where 'being' is opposed to 'existence'  as being timeless. The world of universals, therefore, may also be  described as the world of being. The world of being is unchangeable,  rigid, exact, delightful to the mathematician, the logician, the builder  of metaphysical systems, and all who love perfection more than life. The  world of existence is fleeting, vague, without sharp boundaries,  without any clear plan or arrangement, but it contains all thoughts and  feelings, all the data of sense, and all physical objects, everything  that can do either good or harm, everything that makes any difference to  the value of life and the world. According to our temperaments, we shall  prefer the contemplation of the one or of the other. The one we do not  prefer will probably seem to us a pale shadow of the one we prefer, and  hardly worthy to be regarded as in any sense real. But the truth is that  both have the same claim on our impartial attention, both are real,  and both are important to the metaphysician. Indeed no sooner have we  distinguished the two worlds than it becomes necessary to consider their  relations.    But first of all we must examine our knowledge of universals. This  consideration will occupy us in the following chapter, where we shall  find that it solves the problem of _a priori_ knowledge, from which we  were first led to consider universals.        CHAPTER X. ON OUR KNOWLEDGE OF UNIVERSALS    In regard to one man's knowledge at a given time, universals, like  particulars, may be divided into those known by acquaintance, those  known only by description, and those not known either by acquaintance or  by description.    Let us consider first the knowledge of universals by acquaintance. It is  obvious, to begin with, that we are acquainted with such universals as  white, red, black, sweet, sour, loud, hard, etc., i.e. with qualities  which are exemplified in sense-data. When we see a white patch, we are  acquainted, in the first instance, with the particular patch; but by  seeing many white patches, we easily learn to abstract the whiteness  which they all have in common, and in learning to do this we are  learning to be acquainted with whiteness. A similar process will make us  acquainted with any other universal of the same sort. Universals of this  sort may be called 'sensible qualities'. They can be apprehended with  less effort of abstraction than any others, and they seem less removed  from particulars than other universals are.    We come next to relations. The easiest relations to apprehend are those  which hold between the different parts of a single complex sense-datum.  For example, I can see at a glance the whole of the page on which I  am writing; thus the whole page is included in one sense-datum. But I  perceive that some parts of the page are to the left of other parts,  and some parts are above other parts. The process of abstraction in this  case seems to proceed somewhat as follows: I see successively a number  of sense-data in which one part is to the left of another; I perceive,  as in the case of different white patches, that all these sense-data  have something in common, and by abstraction I find that what they have  in common is a certain relation between their parts, namely the relation  which I call 'being to the left of'. In this way I become acquainted  with the universal relation.    In like manner I become aware of the relation of before and after in  time. Suppose I hear a chime of bells: when the last bell of the chime  sounds, I can retain the whole chime before my mind, and I can perceive  that the earlier bells came before the later ones. Also in memory I  perceive that what I am remembering came before the present time. From  either of these sources I can abstract the universal relation of before  and after, just as I abstracted the universal relation 'being to the  left of'. Thus time-relations, like space-relations, are among those  with which we are acquainted.    Another relation with which we become acquainted in much the same way is  resemblance. If I see simultaneously two shades of green, I can see  that they resemble each other; if I also see a shade of red: at the same  time, I can see that the two greens have more resemblance to each other  than either has to the red. In this way I become acquainted with the  universal _resemblance_ or _similarity_.    Between universals, as between particulars, there are relations of which  we may be immediately aware. We have just seen that we can perceive  that the resemblance between two shades of green is greater than the  resemblance between a shade of red and a shade of green. Here we are  dealing with a relation, namely 'greater than', between two relations.  Our knowledge of such relations, though it requires more power of  abstraction than is required for perceiving the qualities of sense-data,  appears to be equally immediate, and (at least in some cases) equally  indubitable. Thus there is immediate knowledge concerning universals as  well as concerning sense-data.    Returning now to the problem of _a priori_ knowledge, which we left  unsolved when we began the consideration of universals, we find  ourselves in a position to deal with it in a much more satisfactory  manner than was possible before. Let us revert to the proposition 'two  and two are four'. It is fairly obvious, in view of what has been said,  that this proposition states a relation between the universal 'two' and  the universal 'four'. This suggests a proposition which we shall  now endeavour to establish: namely, _All _a priori_ knowledge deals  exclusively with the relations of universals_. This proposition is  of great importance, and goes a long way towards solving our previous  difficulties concerning _a priori_ knowledge.    The only case in which it might seem, at first sight, as if our  proposition were untrue, is the case in which an _a priori_ proposition  states that _all_ of one class of particulars belong to some other  class, or (what comes to the same thing) that _all_ particulars having  some one property also have some other. In this case it might seem  as though we were dealing with the particulars that have the property  rather than with the property. The proposition 'two and two are four' is  really a case in point, for this may be stated in the form 'any two  and any other two are four', or 'any collection formed of two twos is a  collection of four'. If we can show that such statements as this really  deal only with universals, our proposition may be regarded as proved.    One way of discovering what a proposition deals with is to ask ourselves  what words we must understand--in other words, what objects we must be  acquainted with--in order to see what the proposition means. As soon as  we see what the proposition means, even if we do not yet know whether  it is true or false, it is evident that we must have acquaintance with  whatever is really dealt with by the proposition. By applying this test,  it appears that many propositions which might seem to be concerned with  particulars are really concerned only with universals. In the special  case of 'two and two are four', even when we interpret it as meaning  'any collection formed of two twos is a collection of four', it is plain  that we can understand the proposition, i.e. we can see what it is that  it asserts, as soon as we know what is meant by 'collection' and 'two'  and 'four'. It is quite unnecessary to know all the couples in the  world: if it were necessary, obviously we could never understand the  proposition, since the couples are infinitely numerous and therefore  cannot all be known to us. Thus although our general statement _implies_  statements about particular couples, _as soon as we know that there are  such particular couples_, yet it does not itself assert or imply that  there are such particular couples, and thus fails to make any statement  whatever about any actual particular couple. The statement made is about  'couple', the universal, and not about this or that couple.    Thus the statement 'two and two are four' deals exclusively with  universals, and therefore may be known by anybody who is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/583"],[0,"The Woman in White (#16)"],[1," my own will, and I interrupted Miss Halcombe.    \"Let me go to-day,\" I said bitterly.  \"The sooner the better.\"    \"No, not to-day,\" she replied.  \"The only reason you can assign to Mr.  Fairlie for your departure, before the end of your engagement, must be  that an unforeseen necessity compels you to ask his permission to  return at once to London.  You must wait till to-morrow to tell him  that, at the time when the post comes in, because he will then  understand the sudden change in your plans, by associating it with the  arrival of a letter from London.  It is miserable and sickening to  descend to deceit, even of the most harmless kind--but I know Mr.  Fairlie, and if you once excite his suspicions that you are trifling  with him, he will refuse to release you.  Speak to him on Friday  morning: occupy yourself afterwards (for the sake of your own interests  with your employer) in leaving your unfinished work in as little  confusion as possible, and quit this place on Saturday.  It will be  time enough then, Mr. Hartright, for you, and for all of us.\"    Before I could assure her that she might depend on my acting in the  strictest accordance with her wishes, we were both startled by  advancing footsteps in the shrubbery.  Some one was coming from the  house to seek for us! I felt the blood rush into my cheeks and then  leave them again.  Could the third person who was fast approaching us,  at such a time and under such circumstances, be Miss Fairlie?    It was a relief--so sadly, so hopelessly was my position towards her  changed already--it was absolutely a relief to me, when the person who  had disturbed us appeared at the entrance of the summer-house, and  proved to be only Miss Fairlie's maid.    \"Could I speak to you for a moment, miss?\" said the girl, in rather a  flurried, unsettled manner.    Miss Halcombe descended the steps into the shrubbery, and walked aside  a few paces with the maid.    Left by myself, my mind reverted, with a sense of forlorn wretchedness  which it is not in any words that I can find to describe, to my  approaching return to the solitude and the despair of my lonely London  home.  Thoughts of my kind old mother, and of my sister, who had  rejoiced with her so innocently over my prospects in  Cumberland--thoughts whose long banishment from my heart it was now my  shame and my reproach to realise for the first time--came back to me  with the loving mournfulness of old, neglected friends.  My mother and  my sister, what would they feel when I returned to them from my broken  engagement, with the confession of my miserable secret--they who had  parted from me so hopefully on that last happy night in the Hampstead  cottage!    Anne Catherick again! Even the memory of the farewell evening with my  mother and my sister could not return to me now unconnected with that  other memory of the moonlight walk back to London.  What did it mean?  Were that woman and I to meet once more? It was possible, at the least.  Did she know that I lived in London? Yes; I had told her so, either  before or after that strange question of hers, when she had asked me so  distrustfully if I knew many men of the rank of Baronet.  Either before  or after--my mind was not calm enough, then, to remember which.    A few minutes elapsed before Miss Halcombe dismissed the maid and came  back to me.  She, too, looked flurried and unsettled now.    \"We have arranged all that is necessary, Mr. Hartright,\" she said. \"We  have understood each other, as friends should, and we may go back at  once to the house.  To tell you the truth, I am uneasy about Laura.  She has sent to say she wants to see me directly, and the maid reports  that her mistress is apparently very much agitated by a letter that she  has received this morning--the same letter, no doubt, which I sent on  to the house before we came here.\"    We retraced our steps together hastily along the shrubbery path.  Although Miss Halcombe had ended all that she thought it necessary to  say on her side, I had not ended all that I wanted to say on mine.  From the moment when I had discovered that the expected visitor at  Limmeridge was Miss Fairlie's future husband, I had felt a bitter  curiosity, a burning envious eagerness, to know who he was.  It was  possible that a future opportunity of putting the question might not  easily offer, so I risked asking it on our way back to the house.    \"Now that you are kind enough to tell me we have understood each other,  Miss Halcombe,\" I said, \"now that you are sure of my gratitude for your  forbearance and my obedience to your wishes, may I venture to ask  who\"--(I hesitated--I had forced myself to think of him, but it was  harder still to speak of him, as her promised husband)--\"who the  gentleman engaged to Miss Fairlie is?\"    Her mind was evidently occupied with the message she had received from  her sister.  She answered in a hasty, absent way--    \"A gentleman of large property in Hampshire.\"    Hampshire! Anne Catherick's native place.  Again, and yet again, the  woman in white.  There WAS a fatality in it.    \"And his name?\" I said, as quietly and indifferently as I could.    \"Sir Percival Glyde.\"    SIR--Sir Percival! Anne Catherick's question--that suspicious question  about the men of the rank of Baronet whom I might happen to know--had  hardly been dismissed from my mind by Miss Halcombe's return to me in  the summer-house, before it was recalled again by her own answer.  I  stopped suddenly, and looked at her.    \"Sir Percival Glyde,\" she repeated, imagining that I had not heard her  former reply.    \"Knight, or Baronet?\" I asked, with an agitation that I could hide no  longer.    She paused for a moment, and then answered, rather coldly--    \"Baronet, of course.\"        XI    Not a word more was said, on either side, as we walked back to the  house.  Miss Halcombe hastened immediately to her sister's room, and I  withdrew to my studio to set in order all of Mr. Fairlie's drawings  that I had not yet mounted and restored before I resigned them to the  care of other hands.  Thoughts that I had hitherto restrained, thoughts  that made my position harder than ever to endure, crowded on me now  that I was alone.    She was engaged to be married, and her future husband was Sir Percival  Glyde.  A man of the rank of Baronet, and the owner of property in  Hampshire.    There were hundreds of baronets in England, and dozens of landowners in  Hampshire.  Judging by the ordinary rules of evidence, I had not the  shadow of a reason, thus far, for connecting Sir Percival Glyde with  the suspicious words of inquiry that had been spoken to me by the woman  in white.  And yet, I did connect him with them.  Was it because he had  now become associated in my mind with Miss Fairlie, Miss Fairlie being,  in her turn, associated with Anne Catherick, since the night when I had  discovered the ominous likeness between them? Had the events of the  morning so unnerved me already that I was at the mercy of any delusion  which common chances and common coincidences might suggest to my  imagination? Impossible to say.  I could only feel that what had passed  between Miss Halcombe and myself, on our way from the summer-house, had  affected me very strangely.  The foreboding of some undiscoverable  danger lying hid from us all in the darkness of the future was strong  on me.  The doubt whether I was not linked already to a chain of events  which even my approaching departure from Cumberland would be powerless  to snap asunder--the doubt whether we any of us saw the end as the end  would really be--gathered more and more darkly over my mind. Poignant  as it was, the sense of suffering caused by the miserable end of my  brief, presumptuous love seemed to be blunted and deadened by the still  stronger sense of something obscurely impending, something invisibly  threatening, that Time was holding over our heads.    I had been engaged with the drawings little more than half an hour,  when there was a knock at the door.  It opened, on my answering; and,  to my surprise, Miss Halcombe entered the room.    Her manner was angry and agitated.  She caught up a chair for herself  before I could give her one, and sat down in it, close at my side.    \"Mr. Hartright,\" she said, \"I had hoped that all painful subjects of  conversation were exhausted between us, for to-day at least. But it is  not to be so.  There is some underhand villainy at work to frighten my  sister about her approaching marriage.  You saw me send the gardener on  to the house, with a letter addressed, in a strange handwriting, to  Miss Fairlie?\"    \"Certainly.\"    \"The letter is an anonymous letter--a vile attempt to injure Sir  Percival Glyde in my sister's estimation.  It has so agitated and  alarmed her that I have had the greatest possible difficulty in  composing her spirits sufficiently to allow me to leave her room and  come here.  I know this is a family matter on which I ought not to  consult you, and in which you can feel no concern or interest----\"    \"I beg your pardon, Miss Halcombe.  I feel the strongest possible  concern and interest in anything that affects Miss Fairlie's happiness  or yours.\"    \"I am glad to hear you say so.  You are the only person in the house,  or out of it, who can advise me.  Mr. Fairlie, in his state of health  and with his horror of difficulties and mysteries of all kinds, is not  to be thought of.  The clergyman is a good, weak man, who knows nothing  out of the routine of his duties; and our neighbours are just the sort  of comfortable, jog-trot acquaintances whom one cannot disturb in times  of trouble and danger.  What I want to know is this: ought I at once to  take such steps as I can to discover the writer of the letter? or ought  I to wait, and apply to Mr. Fairlie's legal adviser to-morrow? It is a  question--perhaps a very important one--of gaining or losing a day.  Tell me what you think, Mr. Hartright.  If necessity had not "]]]
