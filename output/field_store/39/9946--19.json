[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/597"],[0,"The Story of Burnt Njal: The Great Icelandic Tribune, Jurist, and Counsellor (#16)"],[1," Hallgerda sat out of doors and talked.  Then  Hallgerda said, \"This have ye two brothers in arms, Sigmund and  Skiolld, promised to slay Thord Freedmanson; but Thrain thou hast  promised me that thou wouldst stand by them when they did the  deed.\"    They all acknowledged that they had given her this promise.    \"Now I will counsel you how to do it,\" she says: \"Ye shall ride  east into Homfirth after your goods, and come home about the  beginning of the Thing, but if ye are at home before it begins,  Gunnar will wish that ye should ride to the Thing with him.  Njal  will be at the Thing and his sons and Gunnar, but then ye two  shall slay Thord.\"    They all agreed that this plan should be carried out.  After that  they busked them east to the Firth, and Gunnar was not aware of  what they were about, and Gunnar rode to the Thing.  Njal sent  Thord Freedmanson away east under Eyjafell, and bade him be away  there one night.  So he went east, but he could not get back from  the east, for the Fleet had risen so high that it could not be  crossed on horseback ever so far up.  Njal waited for him one  night, for he had meant him to have ridden with him; and Njal  said to Bergthora that she must send Thord to the Thing as soon  as ever he came home.  Two nights after, Thord came from the  east, and Bergthora told him that he must ride to the Thing, \"But  first thou shalt ride up into Thorolfsfell and see about the farm  there, and do not be there longer than one or two nights.\"        42. THE SLAYING OF THORD FREEDMANSON    Then Sigmund came from the east and those companions.  Hallgerda  told them that Thord was at home, but that he was to ride  straightway to the Thing after a few nights' space.  \"Now ye will  have a fair chance at him,\" she says, \"but if this goes off, ye  will never get nigh him.\"  Men came to Lithend from Thorolfsfell,  and told Hallgerda that Thord was there.  Hallgerda went to  Thrain Sigfus' son, and his companions, and said to him, \"Now is  Thord on Thorolfsfell, and now your best plan is to fall on him  and kill him as he goes home.\"    \"That we will do,\" says Sigmund.  So they went out, and took  their weapons and horses and rode on the way to meet him.  Sigmund said to Thrain, \"Now thou shalt have nothing to do with  it; for we shall not need all of us.\"    \"Very well, so I will,\" says he.    Then Thord rode up to them a little while after, and Sigmund said  to him, \"Give thyself up,\" he says, \"for now shalt thou die.\"    \"That shall not be,\" says Thord, \"come thou to single combat with  me.\"    \"That shall not be either,\" says Sigmund; \"we will make the most  of our numbers; but it is not strange that Skarphedinn is strong,  for it is said that a fourth of a foster-child's strength comes  from the foster-father.\"    \"Thou wilt feel the force of that,\" says Thord, \"for Skarphedinn  will avenge me.\"    After that they fall on him, and he breaks a spear of each of  them, so well did he guard himself.  Then Skiolld cut off his  hand, and he still kept them off with his other hand for some  time, till Sigmund thrust him through.  Then he fell dead to  earth.  They drew over him turf and stones; and Thrain said, \"We  have won an ill work, and Njal's sons will take this slaying ill  when they hear of it.\"    They ride home and tell Hallgerda.  She was glad to hear of the  slaying, but Rannveig, Gunnar's mother, said, \"It is said `but a  short while is hand fain of blow,' and so it will be here; but  still Gunnar will set thee free from this matter.  But if  Hallgerda makes thee take another fly in thy mouth, then that  will be thy bane.\"    Hallgerda sent a man to Bergthorsknoll, to tell the slaying, and  another man to the Thing, to tell it to Gunnar.  Bergthora said  she would not fight against Hallgerda with ill words about such a  matter; \"That,\" quoth she, \"would be no revenge for so great a  quarrel.\"        43. NJAL AND GUNNAR MAKE PEACE FOR THE SLAYING OF THORD    But when the messenger came to the Thing to tell Gunnar of the  slaying, then Gunnar said, \"This has happened ill, and no tidings  could come to my ears which I should think worse; but yet we will  now go at once and see Njal.  I still hope he may take it well,  though he be sorely tried.\"    So they went to see Njal, and called him to come out and talk to  them.  He went out at once to meet Gunnar, and they talked, nor  were there any more men by at first than Kolskegg.    \"Hard tidings have I to tell thee,\" says Gunnar; \"the slaying of  Thord Freedmanson, and I wish to offer thee selfdoom for the  slaying.\"    Njal held his peace some while, and then said, \"That is well  offered, and I will take it; but yet it is to be looked for that  I shall have blame from my wife or from my sons for that, for it  will mislike them much; but still I will run the risk, for I know  that I have to deal with a good man and true; nor do I wish that  any breach should arise in our friendship on my part.\"    \"Wilt thou let thy sons be by, pray?\" says Gunnar.    \"I will not,\" says Njal, \"for they will not break the peace which  I make, but if they stand by while we make it they will not pull  well together with us.\"    \"So it shall be,\" says Gunnar.  \"See thou to it alone.\"    Then they shook one another by the hand, and made peace well and  quickly.    Then Njal said, \"The award that I make is two hundred in silver,  and that thou wilt think much.\"    \"I do not think it too much,\" says Gunnar, and went home to his  booth.    Njal's sons came home, and Skarphedinn asked whence that great  sum of money came, which his father held in his hand.    Njal said, \"I tell you of your foster-father's Thord's slaying,  and we two, Gunnar and I, have now made peace in the matter, and  he has paid an atonement for him as for two men.\"    \"Who slew him?\" says Skarphedinn.    \"Sigmund and Skiolld, but Thrain was standing near too,\" says  Njal.    \"They thought they had need of much strength,\" says Skarphedinn,  and sang a song --         \"Bold in deeds of derring-do,       Burdeners of ocean's steeds,       Strength enough it seems they needed       All to slay a single man;       When shall we our hands uplift?       We who brandish burnished steel --       Famous men erst reddened weapons,       When? if now we quiet sit?\"    \"Yes! when shall the day come when we shall lift our hands?\"    \"That will not be long off,\" says Njal, \"and then thou shalt not  be baulked; but still, methinks, I set great store on your not  breaking this peace that I have made.\"    \"Then we will not break it,\" says Skarphedinn, \"but if anything  arises between us, then we will bear in mind the old feud.\"    \"Then I will ask you to spare no one,\" says Njal.        44. SIGMUND MOCKS NJAL AND HIS SONS    Now men ride home from the Thing; and when Gunnar came home, he  said to Sigmund, \"Thou art a more unlucky man than I thought, and  turnest thy good gifts to thine own ill.  But still I have made  peace for thee with Njal and his sons; and now, take care that  thou dost not let another fly come into thy mouth.  Thou art not  at all after my mind, thou goest about with jibes and jeers, with  scorn and mocking; but that is not my turn of mind.  That is why  thou gettest on so well with Hallgerda, because ye two have your  minds more alike.\"    Gunnar scolded him a long time, and he answered him well, and  said he would follow his counsel more for the time to come than  he had followed it hitherto.  Gunnar told him then they might get  on together.  Gunnar and Njal kept up their friendship though the  rest of their people saw little of one another.  It happened once  that some gangrel women came to Lithend from Bergthorsknoll; they  were great gossips and rather spiteful tongued.  Hallgerda had a  bower, and sate often in it, and there sate with her her daughter  Thorgerda, and there too were Thrain and Sigmund, and a crowd of  women.  Gunnar was not there, nor Kolskegg.  These gangrel women  went into the bower, and Hallgerda greeted them, and made room  for them; then she asked them for news, but they had none to  tell.  Hallgerda asked where they had been overnight; they said  at Bergthorsknoll.    \"What was Njal doing?\" she says.    \"He was hard at work sitting still,\" they said.    \"What were Njal's sons doing?\" she says; \"they think themselves  men at any rate.\"    \"Tall men they are in growth,\" they say, \"but as yet they are all  untried; Skarphedinn whetted an axe, Grim fitted a spearhead to  the shaft, Helgi riveted a hilt on a sword, Hauskuld strengthened  the handle of a shield.\"    \"They must be bent on some great deed,\" says Hallgerda.    \"We do not know that,\" they say.    \"What were Njal's house-carles doing?\" she asks.    \"We don't know what some of them were doing, but one was carting  dung up the hill-side.\"    \"What good was there in doing that?\" she asks.    \"He said it made the swathe better there than anywhere else,\"  they reply.  \"Witless now is Njal,\" says Hallgerda, \"though he  knows how to give counsel on everything.\"    \"How so?\" they ask.    \"I will only bring forward what is true to prove it,\" says she;  \"why doesn't he make them cart dung over his beard that he may be  like other men?  Let us call him `the Beardless Carle': but his  sons we will call `Dung-beardlings'; and now do pray give some  stave about them, Sigmund, and let us get some good by thy gift  of song.\"    \"I am quite ready to do that,\" says he, and sang these verses:         \"Lady proud with hawk in hand,       Prithee why should dungbeard boys,       Reft of reason, dare to hammer       Handle fast on battle shield?       For these lads of loathly feature --       Lady scattering swanbath's beams (1) --       Shalt not shun this ditty shameful       Which I shape upon them now.         \"He the beardless carle shall listen       While I lash him with abuse,       Loon at whom our stomachs sicken,       Soon shall bear these words of scorn;       Far too nice for such base fellows       Is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/599"],[0,"Vanity Fair (#16)"],[1," carriage had turned the corner of the  street), she began to depict in her own mind what a Baronet must be. \"I  wonder, does he wear a star?\" thought she, \"or is it only lords that  wear stars? But he will be very handsomely dressed in a court suit,  with ruffles, and his hair a little powdered, like Mr. Wroughton at  Covent Garden.  I suppose he will be awfully proud, and that I shall be  treated most contemptuously.  Still I must bear my hard lot as well as  I can--at least, I shall be amongst GENTLEFOLKS, and not with vulgar  city people\": and she fell to thinking of her Russell Square friends  with that very same philosophical bitterness with which, in a certain  apologue, the fox is represented as speaking of the grapes.    Having passed through Gaunt Square into Great Gaunt Street, the  carriage at length stopped at a tall gloomy house between two other  tall gloomy houses, each with a hatchment over the middle drawing-room  window; as is the custom of houses in Great Gaunt Street, in which  gloomy locality death seems to reign perpetual.  The shutters of the  first-floor windows of Sir Pitt's mansion were closed--those of the  dining-room were partially open, and the blinds neatly covered up in  old newspapers.    John, the groom, who had driven the carriage alone, did not care to  descend to ring the bell; and so prayed a passing milk-boy to perform  that office for him.  When the bell was rung, a head appeared between  the interstices of the dining-room shutters, and the door was opened by  a man in drab breeches and gaiters, with a dirty old coat, a foul old  neckcloth lashed round his bristly neck, a shining bald head, a leering  red face, a pair of twinkling grey eyes, and a mouth perpetually on the  grin.    \"This Sir Pitt Crawley's?\" says John, from the box.    \"Ees,\" says the man at the door, with a nod.    \"Hand down these 'ere trunks then,\" said John.    \"Hand 'n down yourself,\" said the porter.    \"Don't you see I can't leave my hosses? Come, bear a hand, my fine  feller, and Miss will give you some beer,\" said John, with a  horse-laugh, for he was no longer respectful to Miss Sharp, as her  connexion with the family was broken off, and as she had given nothing  to the servants on coming away.    The bald-headed man, taking his hands out of his breeches pockets,  advanced on this summons, and throwing Miss Sharp's trunk over his  shoulder, carried it into the house.    \"Take this basket and shawl, if you please, and open the door,\" said  Miss Sharp, and descended from the carriage in much indignation.  \"I  shall write to Mr. Sedley and inform him of your conduct,\" said she to  the groom.    \"Don't,\" replied that functionary.  \"I hope you've forgot nothink? Miss  'Melia's gownds--have you got them--as the lady's maid was to have 'ad?  I hope they'll fit you. Shut the door, Jim, you'll get no good out of  'ER,\" continued John, pointing with his thumb towards Miss Sharp: \"a  bad lot, I tell you, a bad lot,\" and so saying, Mr. Sedley's groom  drove away.  The truth is, he was attached to the lady's maid in  question, and indignant that she should have been robbed of her  perquisites.    On entering the dining-room, by the orders of the individual in  gaiters, Rebecca found that apartment not more cheerful than such rooms  usually are, when genteel families are out of town.  The faithful  chambers seem, as it were, to mourn the absence of their masters.  The  turkey carpet has rolled itself up, and retired sulkily under the  sideboard: the pictures have hidden their faces behind old sheets of  brown paper: the ceiling lamp is muffled up in a dismal sack of brown  holland: the window-curtains have disappeared under all sorts of shabby  envelopes: the marble bust of Sir Walpole Crawley is looking from its  black corner at the bare boards and the oiled fire-irons, and the empty  card-racks over the mantelpiece: the cellaret has lurked away behind  the carpet: the chairs are turned up heads and tails along the walls:  and in the dark corner opposite the statue, is an old-fashioned crabbed  knife-box, locked and sitting on a dumb waiter.    Two kitchen chairs, and a round table, and an attenuated old poker and  tongs were, however, gathered round the fire-place, as was a saucepan  over a feeble sputtering fire.  There was a bit of cheese and bread,  and a tin candlestick on the table, and a little black porter in a  pint-pot.    \"Had your dinner, I suppose? It is not too warm for you? Like a drop of  beer?\"    \"Where is Sir Pitt Crawley?\" said Miss Sharp majestically.    \"He, he! I'm Sir Pitt Crawley.  Reklect you owe me a pint for bringing  down your luggage.  He, he! Ask Tinker if I aynt.  Mrs. Tinker, Miss  Sharp; Miss Governess, Mrs. Charwoman.  Ho, ho!\"    The lady addressed as Mrs. Tinker at this moment made her appearance  with a pipe and a paper of tobacco, for which she had been despatched a  minute before Miss Sharp's arrival; and she handed the articles over to  Sir Pitt, who had taken his seat by the fire.    \"Where's the farden?\" said he.  \"I gave you three halfpence. Where's  the change, old Tinker?\"    \"There!\" replied Mrs. Tinker, flinging down the coin; \"it's only  baronets as cares about farthings.\"    \"A farthing a day is seven shillings a year,\" answered the M.P.; \"seven  shillings a year is the interest of seven guineas.  Take care of your  farthings, old Tinker, and your guineas will come quite nat'ral.\"    \"You may be sure it's Sir Pitt Crawley, young woman,\" said Mrs. Tinker,  surlily; \"because he looks to his farthings.  You'll know him better  afore long.\"    \"And like me none the worse, Miss Sharp,\" said the old gentleman, with  an air almost of politeness.  \"I must be just before I'm generous.\"    \"He never gave away a farthing in his life,\" growled Tinker.    \"Never, and never will: it's against my principle.  Go and get another  chair from the kitchen, Tinker, if you want to sit down; and then we'll  have a bit of supper.\"    Presently the baronet plunged a fork into the saucepan on the fire, and  withdrew from the pot a piece of tripe and an onion, which he divided  into pretty equal portions, and of which he partook with Mrs. Tinker.  \"You see, Miss Sharp, when I'm not here Tinker's on board wages: when  I'm in town she dines with the family. Haw! haw! I'm glad Miss Sharp's  not hungry, ain't you, Tink?\" And they fell to upon their frugal supper.    After supper Sir Pitt Crawley began to smoke his pipe; and when it  became quite dark, he lighted the rushlight in the tin candlestick, and  producing from an interminable pocket a huge mass of papers, began  reading them, and putting them in order.    \"I'm here on law business, my dear, and that's how it happens that I  shall have the pleasure of such a pretty travelling companion  to-morrow.\"    \"He's always at law business,\" said Mrs. Tinker, taking up the pot of  porter.    \"Drink and drink about,\" said the Baronet.  \"Yes; my dear, Tinker is  quite right: I've lost and won more lawsuits than any man in England.  Look here at Crawley, Bart. v. Snaffle.  I'll throw him over, or my  name's not Pitt Crawley.  Podder and another versus Crawley, Bart.  Overseers of Snaily parish against Crawley, Bart. They can't prove it's  common: I'll defy 'em; the land's mine. It no more belongs to the  parish than it does to you or Tinker here.  I'll beat 'em, if it cost  me a thousand guineas. Look over the papers; you may if you like, my  dear. Do you write a good hand? I'll make you useful when we're at  Queen's Crawley, depend on it, Miss Sharp. Now the dowager's dead I  want some one.\"    \"She was as bad as he,\" said Tinker.  \"She took the law of every one of  her tradesmen; and turned away forty-eight footmen in four year.\"    \"She was close--very close,\" said the Baronet, simply; \"but she was a  valyble woman to me, and saved me a steward.\"--And in this confidential  strain, and much to the amusement of the new-comer, the conversation  continued for a considerable time.  Whatever Sir Pitt Crawley's  qualities might be, good or bad, he did not make the least disguise of  them.  He talked of himself incessantly, sometimes in the coarsest and  vulgarest Hampshire accent; sometimes adopting the tone of a man of the  world.  And so, with injunctions to Miss Sharp to be ready at five in  the morning, he bade her good night. \"You'll sleep with Tinker  to-night,\" he said; \"it's a big bed, and there's room for two. Lady  Crawley died in it.  Good night.\"    Sir Pitt went off after this benediction, and the solemn Tinker,  rushlight in hand, led the way up the great bleak stone stairs, past  the great dreary drawing-room doors, with the handles muffled up in  paper, into the great front bedroom, where Lady Crawley had slept her  last.  The bed and chamber were so funereal and gloomy, you might have  fancied, not only that Lady Crawley died in the room, but that her  ghost inhabited it.  Rebecca sprang about the apartment, however, with  the greatest liveliness, and had peeped into the huge wardrobes, and  the closets, and the cupboards, and tried the drawers which were  locked, and examined the dreary pictures and toilette appointments,  while the old charwoman was saying her prayers.  \"I shouldn't like to  sleep in this yeer bed without a good conscience, Miss,\" said the old  woman.  \"There's room for us and a half-dozen of ghosts in it,\" says  Rebecca.  \"Tell me all about Lady Crawley and Sir Pitt Crawley, and  everybody, my DEAR Mrs. Tinker.\"    But old Tinker was not to be pumped by this little cross-questioner;  and signifying to her that bed was a place for sleeping, not  conversation, set up in her corner of the bed such a snore as only the  nose of innocence can produce.  Rebecca lay awake for a long, long  time, thinking of the morrow, and of the new world into which she was  going, and of her chances of success there.  The rushlight flickered in  the basin.  The mantelpiece cast up a great black shadow, over half of  a mouldy old"]]]
