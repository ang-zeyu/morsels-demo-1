Mrs. Belding visited him often; her husband came in  several times, and once Nell slipped in noiselessly.  Even this last  event aroused no interest in Dick.    On the next day he was very much improved.    \"We've been afraid of blood poisoning,\" said Belding.  \"But my wife  thinks the danger's past.  You'll have to rest that arm for a while.\"    Ladd and Jim came peeping in at the door.    \"Come in, boys.  He can have company--the more the better--if it'll  keep him content.  He mustn't move, that's all.\"    The cowboys entered, slow, easy, cool, kind-voiced.    \"Shore it's tough,\" said Ladd, after he had greeted Dick.  \"You look  used up.\"    Jim Lash wagged his half-bald, sunburned head, \"Musta been more'n tough  for Rojas.\"    \"Gale, Laddy tells me one of our neighbors, fellow named Carter, is  going to Casita,\" put in Belding.  \"Here's a chance to get word to your  friend the soldier.\"    \"Oh, that will be fine!\" exclaimed Dick.  \"I declare I'd forgotten  Thorne.... How is Miss Castaneda?  I hope--\"    \"She's all right, Gale.  Been up and around the patio for two days.  Like all the Spanish--the real thing--she's made of Damascus steel.  We've been getting acquainted.  She and Nell made friends at once. I'll  call them in.\"    He closed the door leading out into the yard, explaining that he did  not want to take chances of Mercedes's presence becoming known to  neighbors.  Then he went to the patio and called.    Both girls came in, Mercedes leading.  Like Nell, she wore white, and  she had a red rose in her hand.  Dick would scarcely have recognized  anything about her except her eyes and the way she carried her little  head, and her beauty burst upon him strange and anew.  She was swift,  impulsive in her movements to reach his side.    \"Senor, I am so sorry you were ill--so happy you are better.\"    Dick greeted her, offering his left hand, gravely apologizing for the  fact that, owing to a late infirmity, he could not offer the right.  Her smile exquisitely combined sympathy, gratitude, admiration.  Then  Dick spoke to Nell, likewise offering his hand, which she took shyly.  Her reply was a murmured, unintelligible one; but her eyes were glad,  and the tint in her cheeks threatened to rival the hue of the rose she  carried.    Everybody chatted then, except Nell, who had apparently lost her voice.  Presently Dick remembered to speak of the matter of getting news to  Thorne.    \"Senor, may I write to him?  Will some one take a letter?... I shall  hear from him!\" she said; and her white hands emphasized her words.    \"Assuredly.  I guess poor Thorne is almost crazy.  I'll write to  him.... No, I can't with this crippled hand.\"    \"That'll be all right, Gale,\" said Belding.  \"Nell will write for you.  She writes all my letters.\"    So Belding arranged it; and Mercedes flew away to her room to write,  while Nell fetched pen and paper and seated herself beside Gale's bed  to take his dictation.    What with watching Nell and trying to catch her glance, and listening  to Belding's talk with the cowboys, Dick was hard put to it to dictate  any kind of a creditable letter.  Nell met his gaze once, then no more.  The color came and went in her cheeks, and sometimes, when he told her  to write so and so, there was a demure smile on her lips.  She was  laughing at him.  And Belding was talking over the risks involved in a  trip to Casita.    \"Shore I'll ride in with the letters,\" Ladd said.    \"No you won't,\" replied Belding.  \"That bandit outfit will be laying  for you.\"    \"Well, I reckon if they was I wouldn't be oncommon grieved.\"    \"I'll tell you, boys, I'll ride in myself with Carter.  There's  business I can see to, and I'm curious to know what the rebels are  doing.  Laddy, keep one eye open while I'm gone.  See the horses are  locked up.... Gale, I'm going to Casita myself.  Ought to get back  tomorrow some time.  I'll be ready to start in an hour.  Have your  letter ready.  And say--if you want to write home it's a chance.  Sometimes we don't go to the P. O. in a month.\"    He tramped out, followed by the tall cowboys, and then Dick was enabled  to bring his letter to a close.  Mercedes came back, and her eyes were  shining.  Dick imagined a letter received from her would be something  of an event for a fellow.  Then, remembering Belding's suggestion, he  decided to profit by it.    \"May I trouble you to write another for me?\" asked Dick, as he received  the letter from Nell.    \"It's no trouble, I'm sure--I'd be pleased,\" she replied.    That was altogether a wonderful speech of hers, Dick thought, because  the words were the first coherent ones she had spoken to him.    \"May I stay?\" asked Mercedes, smiling.    \"By all means,\" he answered, and then he settled back and began.    Presently Gale paused, partly because of genuine emotion, and stole a  look from under his hand at Nell.  She wrote swiftly, and her downcast  face seemed to be softer in its expression of sweetness.  If she had in  the very least been drawn to him--  But that was absurd--impossible!    When Dick finished dictating, his eyes were upon Mercedes, who sat  smiling curious and sympathetic.  How responsive she was! He heard the  hasty scratch of Nell's pen.  He looked at Nell. Presently she rose,  holding out his letter.  He was just in time to see a wave of red  recede from her face.  She gave him one swift gaze, unconscious,  searching, then averted it and turned away.  She left the room with  Mercedes before he could express his thanks.    But that strange, speaking flash of eyes remained to haunt and torment  Gale.  It was indescribably sweet, and provocative of thoughts that he  believed were wild without warrant.  Something within him danced for  very joy, and the next instant he was conscious of wistful doubt, a  gravity that he could not understand. It dawned upon him that for the  brief instant when Nell had met his gaze she had lost her shyness.  It  was a woman's questioning eyes that had pierced through him.    During the rest of the day Gale was content to lie still on his bed  thinking and dreaming, dozing at intervals, and watching the lights  change upon the mountain peaks, feeling the warm, fragrant desert wind  that blew in upon him.  He seemed to have lost the faculty of  estimating time.  A long while, strong in its effect upon him, appeared  to have passed since he had met Thorne.  He accepted things as he felt  them, and repudiated his intelligence. His old inquisitive habit of  mind returned.  Did he love Nell? Was he only attracted for the moment?  What was the use of worrying about her or himself?  He refused to  answer, and deliberately gave himself up to dreams of her sweet face  and of that last dark-blue glance.    Next day he believed he was well enough to leave his room; but Mrs.  Belding would not permit him to do so.  She was kind, soft-handed,  motherly, and she was always coming in to minister to his comfort. This  attention was sincere, not in the least forced; yet Gale felt that the  friendliness so manifest in the others of the household did not extend  to her.  He was conscious of something that a little thought persuaded  him was antagonism.  It surprised and hurt him.  He had never been much  of a success with girls and young married women, but their mothers and  old people had generally been fond of him.  Still, though Mrs.  Belding's hair was snow-white, she did not impress him as being old.  He reflected that there might come a time when it would be desirable,  far beyond any ground of every-day friendly kindliness, to have Mrs.  Belding be well disposed toward him.  So he thought about her, and  pondered how to make her like him.  It did not take very long for Dick  to discover that he liked her.  Her face, except when she smiled, was  thoughtful and sad.  It was a face to make one serious.  Like a  haunting shadow, like a phantom of happier years, the sweetness of  Nell's face was there, and infinitely more of beauty than had been  transmitted to the daughter.  Dick believed Mrs. Belding's friendship  and motherly love were worth striving to win, entirely aside from any  more selfish motive.  He decided both would be hard to get.  Often he  felt her deep, penetrating gaze upon him; and, though this in no wise  embarrassed him--for he had no shameful secrets of past or present--it  showed him how useless it would be to try to conceal anything from her.  Naturally, on first impulse, he wanted to hide his interest in the  daughter; but he resolved to be absolutely frank and true, and through  that win or lose.  Moreover, if Mrs. Belding asked him any questions  about his home, his family, his connections, he would not avoid direct  and truthful answers.    Toward evening Gale heard the tramp of horses and Belding's hearty  voice.  Presently the rancher strode in upon Gale, shaking the gray  dust from his broad shoulders and waving a letter.    \"Hello, Dick!  Good news and bad!\" he said, putting the letter in  Dick's hand.  \"Had no trouble finding your friend Thorne.  Looked like  he'd been drunk for a week!  Say, he nearly threw a fit.  I never saw a  fellow so wild with joy.  He made sure you and Mercedes were lost in  the desert.  He wrote two letters which I brought. Don't mistake me,  boy, it was some fun with Mercedes just now. I teased her, wouldn't  give her the letter.  You ought to have seen her eyes.  If ever you see  a black-and-white desert hawk swoop down upon a quail, then you'll know  how Mercedes pounced upon her letter... Well, Casita is one hell of a  place these days.  I tried to get your baggage, and I think I made a  mistake.  We're going to see travel toward Forlorn River.  The federal  garrison got reinforcements from somewhere, and is holding out.  There's been fighting for three days.  The rebels have a string of flat  railroad cars, all iron, and they ran this up within range of the  barricades.  They've"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/503"],[0,"The Blue Fairy Book (#16)"],[1,"ever to  keep his word, and asked his Vizier's advice, who counselled him to set  so high a value on the Princess that no man living could come up to  it. The Sultan then turned to Aladdin's mother, saying: \"Good woman, a  Sultan must remember his promises, and I will remember mine, but your  son must first send me forty basins of gold brimful of jewels, carried  by forty black slaves, led by as many white ones, splendidly dressed.  Tell him that I await his answer.\" The mother of Aladdin bowed low and  went home, thinking all was lost. She gave Aladdin the message, adding:  \"He may wait long enough for your answer!\" \"Not so long, mother, as you  think,\" her son replied. \"I would do a great deal more than that for the  Princess.\" He summoned the genie, and in a few moments the eighty slaves  arrived, and filled up the small house and garden. Aladdin made them  set out to the palace, two and two, followed by his mother. They were  so richly dressed, with such splendid jewels in their girdles, that  everyone crowded to see them and the basins of gold they carried on  their heads. They entered the palace, and, after kneeling before the  Sultan, stood in a half-circle round the throne with their arms crossed,  while Aladdin's mother presented them to the Sultan. He hesitated no  longer, but said: \"Good woman, return and tell your son that I wait for  him with open arms.\" She lost no time in telling Aladdin, bidding him  make haste. But Aladdin first called the genie. \"I want a scented bath,\"  he said, \"a richly embroidered habit, a horse surpassing the Sultan's,  and twenty slaves to attend me. Besides this, six slaves, beautifully  dressed, to wait on my mother; and lastly, ten thousand pieces of gold  in ten purses.\" No sooner said than done. Aladdin mounted his horse and  passed through the streets, the slaves strewing gold as they went. Those  who had played with him in his childhood knew him not, he had grown so  handsome. When the Sultan saw him he came down from his throne, embraced  him, and led him into a hall where a feast was spread, intending to  marry him to the Princess that very day. But Aladdin refused, saying, \"I  must build a palace fit for her,\" and took his leave. Once home, he said  to the genie: \"Build me a palace of the finest marble, set with jasper,  agate, and other precious stones. In the middle you shall build me a  large hall with a dome, its four walls of massy gold and silver, each  having six windows, whose lattices, all except one which is to be left  unfinished, must be set with diamonds and rubies. There must be stables  and horses and grooms and slaves; go and see about it!\"    The palace was finished by the next day, and the genie carried him there  and showed him all his orders faithfully carried out, even to the laying  of a velvet carpet from Aladdin's palace to the Sultan's. Aladdin's  mother then dressed herself carefully, and walked to the palace with her  slaves, while he followed her on horseback. The Sultan sent musicians  with trumpets and cymbals to meet them, so that the air resounded with  music and cheers. She was taken to the Princess, who saluted her and  treated her with great honor. At night the Princess said good-by to her  father, and set out on the carpet for Aladdin's palace, with his mother  at her side, and followed by the hundred slaves. She was charmed at the  sight of Aladdin, who ran to receive her. \"Princess,\" he said, \"blame  your beauty for my boldness if I have displeased you.\" She told him  that, having seen him, she willingly obeyed her father in this matter.  After the wedding had taken place Aladdin led her into the hall, where a  feast was spread, and she supped with him, after which they danced till  midnight. Next day Aladdin invited the Sultan to see the palace. On  entering the hall with the four-and-twenty windows, with their rubies,  diamonds, and emeralds, he cried: \"It is a world's wonder! There is only  one thing that surprises me. Was it by accident that one window was  left unfinished?\" \"No, sir, by design,\" returned Aladdin. \"I wished  your Majesty to have the glory of finishing this palace.\" The Sultan was  pleased, and sent for the best jewelers in the city. He showed them  the unfinished window, and bade them fit it up like the others. \"Sir,\"  replied their spokesman, \"we cannot find jewels enough.\" The Sultan  had his own fetched, which they soon used, but to no purpose, for in  a month's time the work was not half done. Aladdin, knowing that their  task was vain, bade them undo their work and carry the jewels back, and  the genie finished the window at his command. The Sultan was surprised  to receive his jewels again, and visited Aladdin, who showed him the  window finished. The Sultan embraced him, the envious Vizier meanwhile  hinting that it was the work of enchantment.    Aladdin had won the hearts of the people by his gentle bearing. He was  made captain of the Sultan's armies, and won several battles for him,  but remained modest and courteous as before, and lived thus in peace and  content for several years.    But far away in Africa the magician remembered Aladdin, and by his magic  arts discovered that Aladdin, instead of perishing miserably in the  cave, had escaped, and had married a princess, with whom he was living  in great honor and wealth. He knew that the poor tailor's son could only  have accomplished this by means of the lamp, and traveled night and day  until he reached the capital of China, bent on Aladdin's ruin. As he  passed through the town he heard people talking everywhere about a  marvellous palace. \"Forgive my ignorance,\" he asked, \"what is this  palace you speak Of?\" \"Have you not heard of Prince Aladdin's palace,\"  was the reply, \"the greatest wonder of the world? I will direct you  if you have a mind to see it.\" The magician thanked him who spoke, and  having seen the palace, knew that it had been raised by the Genie of the  Lamp, and became half mad with rage. He determined to get hold of the  lamp, and again plunge Aladdin into the deepest poverty.    Unluckily, Aladdin had gone a-hunting for eight days, which gave the  magician plenty of time. He bought a dozen copper lamps, put them into a  basket, and went to the palace, crying: \"New lamps for old!\" followed  by a jeering crowd. The Princess, sitting in the hall of four-and-twenty  windows, sent a slave to find out what the noise was about, who came  back laughing, so that the Princess scolded her. \"Madam,\" replied the  slave, \"who can help laughing to see an old fool offering to exchange  fine new lamps for old ones?\" Another slave, hearing this, said: \"There  is an old one on the cornice there which he can have.\" Now this was the  magic lamp, which Aladdin had left there, as he could not take it out  hunting with him. The Princess, not knowing its value, laughingly  bade the slave take it and make the exchange. She went and said to the  magician: \"Give me a new lamp for this.\" He snatched it and bade the  slave take her choice, amid the jeers of the crowd. Little he cared, but  left off crying his lamps, and went out of the city gates to a lonely  place, where he remained till nightfall, when he pulled out the lamp  and rubbed it. The genie appeared, and at the magician's command carried  him, together with the palace and the Princess in it, to a lonely place  in Africa.    Next morning the Sultan looked out of the window toward Aladdin's palace  and rubbed his eyes, for it was gone. He sent for the Vizier and asked  what had become of the palace. The Vizier looked out too, and was lost  in astonishment. He again put it down to enchantment, and this time the  Sultan believed him, and sent thirty men on horseback to fetch Aladdin  in chains. They met him riding home, bound him, and forced him to go  with them on foot. The people, however, who loved him, followed, armed,  to see that he came to no harm. He was carried before the Sultan,  who ordered the executioner to cut off his head. The executioner made  Aladdin kneel down, bandaged his eyes, and raised his scimitar to  strike. At that instant the Vizier, who saw that the crowd had forced  their way into the courtyard and were scaling the walls to rescue  Aladdin, called to the executioner to stay his hand. The people, indeed,  looked so threatening that the Sultan gave way and ordered Aladdin to be  unbound, and pardoned him in the sight of the crowd. Aladdin now  begged to know what he had done. \"False wretch!\" said the Sultan, \"come  thither,\" and showed him from the window the place where his palace had  stood. Aladdin was so amazed that he could not say a word. \"Where is my  palace and my daughter?\" demanded the Sultan. \"For the first I am not so  deeply concerned, but my daughter I must have, and you must find her  or lose your head.\" Aladdin begged for forty days in which to find her,  promising, if he failed, to return and suffer death at the Sultan's  pleasure. His prayer was granted, and he went forth sadly from the  Sultan's presence. For three days he wandered about like a madman,  asking everyone what had become of his palace, but they only laughed and  pitied him. He came to the banks of a river, and knelt down to say his  prayers before throwing himself in. In so doing he rubbed the magic ring  he still wore. The genie he had seen in the cave appeared, and asked his  will. \"Save my life, genie,\" said Aladdin, \"bring my palace back.\" \"That  is not in my power,\" said the genie; \"I am only the Slave of the Ring;  you must ask him of the lamp.\" \"Even so,\" said Aladdin, \"but thou canst  take me to the palace, and set me down under my dear wife's window.\" He  at once found himself in Africa, under the window of the Princess, and  fell asleep out of sheer weariness.    He was awakened by the singing of the birds, and his heart was lighter.  He saw plainly that all his misfortunes were owing to the loss of the  lamp, and vainly wondered who had robbed him of it.
