[161]    The Philippine Islands were under the jurisdiction of the Southern  Army, whose command organization was extremely complex. (Chart 3)  The supreme commander was Field Marshal Count Hisaichi Terauchi. There  were four area armies in the Southern Army: the 2d Area Army occupied  Netherlands New Guinea, thence west to Timor; the 7th Area Army was  at Singapore; the Burma Area Army was at Rangoon; and the 14th Area  Army, commanded by Lt. Gen. Shigenori Kuroda, was in the Philippines  with its headquarters at Manila. The Southern Army also had two air  armies and three garrison armies: the 3d Air Army in Singapore; the  4th Air Army, consisting of two air divisions in the Philippines and  one air division in western New Guinea; and a garrison army stationed  in Thailand, another in French Indochina, and a third in Borneo. The  commander of the 14th Area Army maintained a staff liaison with the  4th Air Army but otherwise had no control over it.    The 1st Air Fleet, under the command of the Southwest Area  Fleet, was stationed in the Philippines, with headquarters at  Manila. Admiral Soemu Toyoda, commander in chief of the Combined  Fleet with headquarters at Tokyo, controlled the entire naval forces,  including the Southwest Area Fleet. [162]        Plans for the 14th Area Army    The Japanese during the summer of 1944 anticipated that the United  States forces would return to the Philippine Islands, but when and  where were two questions for which not even Tokyo Rose, the Japanese  radio propagandist, had the answers. Consequently, the Japanese wished  to keep their troops sufficiently mobile that reinforcements might be  rushed to the point of contact. The original plan called for the main  defensive effort of the ground forces to be made on Luzon, since there  were too few Japanese troops in the archipelago to defend all of the  Philippines. The Japanese Navy and Air Forces, however, were to carry  out \"decisive\" actions in the central and southern Philippines. [163]    To General Kuroda fell the task of making and executing plans for the  defense of the Philippines by the 14th Area Army. General Kuroda was  essentially a realist. He stated in June 1947 that in October 1944 he  had told Maj. Gen. Seizo Arisue, Chief of Army Intelligence, Imperial  General Headquarters, that \"it would be best for Japan to negotiate  an immediate peace before the Americans could destroy our nation  by air power.\" [164] Kuroda thought that all available land forces  should be concentrated in the Luzon area in order to counterattack  any American landing within the Luzon perimeter. However, because  of their predominant aerial strength, the Americans in their next  attempt could unless they made \"some terrible mistake ... land in  force and once ashore, could take the Philippines.\" [165] General  Kuroda's plan was never considered. Imperial General Headquarters'  plan for the defense of the Philippines called for the employment of  ten divisions and five brigades: five divisions and two brigades in  Luzon, four divisions and two brigades in the southern Philippines,  and one division and one brigade in China and Formosa. The two units  last mentioned would be rushed to the Philippines as soon as the  American landing became imminent. [166] When the Americans landed,  all of these units, acting in concert, were to participate in fighting  a decisive battle against the American troops. This plan was never  carried out in its entirety.    The Japanese occupation troops of the Philippine Islands had grown  soft and had \"no particular will to fight.\" In the spring of 1944,  there were only minor units available to set up an organized defense.    Imperial General Headquarters and the Southern Army thought that  because of the many islands in the archipelago emphasis should be  placed on air power. Air attacks could destroy the American forces  before they arrived at the landing areas or at least before they  could make appreciable gains. The way could then be opened to turn a  defense into an offensive. [167] General Kuroda threw cold water on  this plan by bluntly stating:          That concept is good, but you cannot fight with concept      alone. Words alone will not sink American ships and that becomes      clear when you compare our airplanes with theirs. That is why the      major battles have been occurring on land. We can say that the      power of our air force is negligible at this time. No matter how      much the Fourteenth Army devotes their efforts toward air power,      in actuality, should there be a decisive fight, they must fight      on land. The preparation and conduct of an operation, and the      responsibilities thereof cannot be conducted by airplanes and air      units. The land army should initiate its own preparations. For      example, for what purpose were the group of air bases constructed      at Davao and Tacloban? Even though they are built, they aren't      used. It amounts to construction for the use of the enemy. [168]      During the month of August, the Japanese devoted their main efforts  toward strengthening the air force. After the first of September  more emphasis was placed on building up the ground troops while  the air preparations continued to some extent. The Southern Army in  late August ordered about one half of a division to Sarangani and  one division to Davao against the wishes of the 14th Area Army. This  meant a reshuffling of the troops that had been moving and repairing  defenses since the first part of August. \"The order was carried out  begrudgingly.\" [169]    Lt Gen. Sosaku Suzuki, the commander of the 35th Army, thinking that  the American Army would land on 1 October, said: \"Contrary to what  has been announced by General Headquarters our air force cannot be  prepared and equipped in time, nor can the Combined Fleet be depended  upon. The situation grows worse and for this reason the land force  preparations must be hastened. Yet, in spite of that, we must not  discourage the air forces and should do as much as possible to prepare  aggressive aerial opposition.\" [170]    In the middle of September, Imperial General Headquarters decided  to replace General Kuroda with General Tomoyuki Yamashita. Not only  did General Kuroda have a concept of the Philippine operations that  differed from that of his superiors, but he was charged with neglecting  his duty as field army commander. [171] Lt. Col. Seiichi Yoshie of  the Personnel Bureau of the War Ministry, who had been sent to the  Philippines to investigate personnel matters in the Southern Army,  said of the incident:          Stories reached the War Ministry that Lt. Gen. Kuroda was devoting      more time to his golf, reading and personal matters than to the      execution of his official duties. It appeared that his control      over staff officers and troops was not sufficiently strong and      that there was a good deal of unfavorable criticism of his conduct      among the troops. There were also indications that discipline      was becoming very lax.        On 4 September 1944, I left Tokyo under orders ... to      investigate. As a result I obtained many statements substantiating      the unfavorable stories in regard to Lt. Gen. Kuroda. The      recommendations of all the staff was that Lt. Gen. Kuroda be      relieved as soon as possible, and be replaced by Gen. Yamashita      ... who was a superb tactician and excellent leader. [172]      General Yamashita, who was in Manchuria, received notification of  his appointment on 23 September, and on the 9th of October he assumed  command of the 14th Area Army. [173] On his arrival in the Philippines,  he found conditions were \"unsatisfactory.\" Of the eleven members  of the old staff only five were left and the new staff officers  were unfamiliar with conditions in the Philippine Islands. [174]  The state of affairs was well exemplified by a remark of his new  chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Akira Muto, who arrived in the Philippines  on 20 October from Sumatra, where he had been in command of the 2d  Imperial Guards Division. [175] Upon being told that the Americans  had landed on Leyte, Muto is said to have replied, \"Very interesting,  but where is Leyte?\" [176]    Maj. Gen. Toshio Nishimura, one of three assistants to Yamashita,  states that the planning for the Leyte campaign was \"very bad.\" The  supply situation, however, was favorable. Since Manila was the main  depot not only for the Philippines but also for other places in the  south such as Borneo and Singapore, a sufficient amount of everything  needed was at hand. [177]    There were two tactical concepts of defense of the islands in July  and August 1944. One was termed the policy of \"annihilation at the  beachhead\" and the other the policy of \"resistance in depth.\" The  respective merits of the two concepts were bitterly debated by their  partisans. The proponents of resistance in depth thought that the  beach defenses, which had been constructed with a great deal of  labor, were useless, since it was believed they could not withstand  naval bombardment. On the other hand, the friends of annihilation  at the beachhead felt that semipermanent beach fortifications could  withstand bombardment. Imperial General Headquarters, after studying  the battle lessons of the Pacific Campaign and the actual effect of  naval bombardment, decided to adopt the resistance in depth tactics and  instructed the entire army forces to comply. Consequently, the various  group commanders abandoned their beach defenses with regret and began  to build strong fortifications in selected areas of the interior. [178]    The control of the Visayan Islands and Mindanao was vested in the 35th  Army, which was the equivalent of an American army corps. General  Suzuki, its commander, compromised between the two concepts of  defense. At a meeting "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4907"],[0,"Moths of the Limberlost: A Book About Limberlost Cabin (#16)"],[1,"or potato vine, a jimson weed or ground cherry, but all my life  I have seen their eggs on these plants, first of a pale green  closely resembling the under side of the leaves, and if they  had been laid some time, a yellow colour.  The eggs are not dotted  along in lines, or closely  placed, but are deposited singly, or  by twos, at least very  sparsely.    The little caterpillars emerge in about a week, and then comes the  process of eating until they  grow into the large, green tomato or  tobacco worms that all of us have seen.  When hatched the  caterpillars are green, and have grey caudal horns similar to  Lineata.  After eating for four or five days, they cast their  skins.  This process is repeated three or four times, when the  full-grown caterpillars are over four inches long, exactly the  colour of a green tomato, with pale blue and yellow markings of  beautiful shades, the horns blue-black; and appearing sharp enough  to inflict a severe wound.    Like all sphinx caterpillars Celeus is perfectly harmless; but  this horn, in connexion with the habit the creatures have of  clinging to the vines with the back feet, raising the head and  striking from side to side, makes people very sure they can bite  or sting, or inflict some serious hurt.  So very vigorous are they  in self-defence when disturbed, that robins and cuckoos are the only  birds I ever have seen brave enough to pick them until the caterpillars  loosen their hold and drop to the ground, where they are eaten with  evident relish.    One cuckoo of my experience that nested in an old orchard, adjoining  a potato patch, frequently went there caterpillar-hunting, and played  havoc with one wherever found.  The shy, deep wood habits of the  cuckoo prevent it from coming close houses and into gardens, but  robins will take these big caterpillars from tomato vines.  However,  they go about it rather gingerly, and the work of reducing one to  non-resistance does not seem to be at all coveted.  Most people  exhibit symptoms of convulsions at sight of one.  Yet it is a matter  of education.  I have seen women kiss and fondle cats and dogs, one  snap from which would result in disfiguration or horrible death,  and seem not to be able to get enough of them.  But they were quite  equal to a genuine faint if contact were suggested with a perfectly  harmless caterpillar, a creature lacking all means of defence, save  this demonstration of throwing the head.    When full-fed the caterpillars enter the earth to pupate, and on  the fifteenth of October, 1906, only the day before I began this  chapter, the Deacon, in digging worms for a fishing trip to the  river, found a pupa case a yard from the tomato vines, and six  inches below the surface.  He came to my desk, carrying on a spade  a ball of damp earth larger than a quart bowl.  With all care we  broke this as nearly in halves as possible and found in the centre  a firm, oval hole, the size and shape of a hen's egg, and in the  opening a fine fresh pupa case.    It was a beautiful red-brown in colour, long and slenderer than  a number of others in my box of sand, and had a long tongue case  turned under and fastened to the pupa between the wing shields.  The sides of the abdomen were pitted; the shape of the head, and  the eyes showed through the case, the wing shields were plainly  indicated, and the abdominal shield was in round sections so that  the pupa could twist from side to sid when touched, proving that  the developing moth inside was very much alive and in fine condition.    There were no traces of the cast skin.  The caterpillar had been  so strong and had pushed so hard against the surrounding earth that  the direction from which it had entered was lost.  The soil was  packed and crowded firmly for such a distance that this large ball  was forced together.  Trembling with eagerness I hurriedly set up  a camera.  This phase of moth life often has been described, but  I never before heard of any one having been able to reproduce it,  so my luck was glorious.  A careful study of this ball of earth,  the opening in which the case lies, and the pupa, with its blunt  head and elaborate tongue shield, will convince any one that when  ready to emerge these moths must bore the six inches to the surface  with the point of the abdomen, and there burst the case, cling to  the first twig and develop and harden the wings.  The abdominal  point is sharp, surprisingly strong, and the rings of the segments  enable it to turn in all directions, while the earth is mellow  and moist with spring rains.  To force a way head first would be  impossible on account of the delicate tongue shield, and for the  moth to emerge underground and dig to the surface without displacing  a feather of down, either before or after wing expansion, is  unthinkable.  Yet I always had been in doubt as to precisely how the  exit of a pupa case moth took place, until I actually saw the earth  move and the sharp abdominal point appear while working in my garden.    Living pupae can be had in the fall, by turning a few shovels of  soil close vegetables in any country  garden.  In the mellow  mould, among cabbages and tomato vines, around old log cabins close  the Limberlost swamp, they are numerous, and the emerging moths  haunt the sweet old-fashioned flowers.    The moth named Celeus, after a king of Eleusis, certainly has  kingly qualities to justify the appellation.  The colouring is  all grey, black, brown, white and yellow, and the combinations are  most artistic.  It is a relative of Lineata.  It flies and feeds by  day, has nearly the same length of life, and is much the same in  shape.    The head is small and sharp, eyes very much larger than Lineata,  and tongue nearly four inches in length.  The antennae are not  clubbed, but long and hairlike.  It has the broad shoulders, the  long wings, and the same shape of abdomen.  The wings, front and  back, are so mottled, lined, and touched with grey, black, brown  and white, as to be almost past definite description.  The back  wings have the black and white markings more clearly defined.  The head meets the thorax with a black band.  The back is covered  with long, grey down, and joins the abdomen, with a band of black  about a quarter of an inch wide, and then a white one of equal width.  The abdomen is the gaudiest part of the moth.  In general it is a  soft grey.  It is crossed by five narrow white lines the length  of the abdomen, and a narrow black one down the middle.  Along each  side runs a band of white.  On this are placed four large yellow spots  each circled by a band of black that joins the black band of the  spot next to it.  The legs and under side of the abdomen and wings  are a light grey-tan, with the wing markings showing faintly, and  the abdomen below is decorated with two small black dots.    My first Celeus, a very large and beautiful one, was brought to  me by Mr. Wallace Hardison, who has been an interested helper  with this book.  The moth had a wing sweep of fully five and a  half inches, and its markings were unusually bright and strong.  No other Celeus quite so big and beautiful ever has come to my  notice.  From four and a half to five inches is the average size.    There was something the matter with this moth.  Not a scale of down  seemed to be missing, but it was torpid and would not fly.  Possibly it had been stung by some parasite before taking flight  at all, for it was very fresh.  I just had returned from a trip  north, and there were some large pieces of birch bark lying on the  table on which the moth had been placed.  It climbed on one of  these, and clung there, so I set up the bark, and made a time  exposure.  It felt so badly it did not even close them when I took  a brush and spread its wings full width.  Soon after it became  motionless.  I had begun photographing moths recently; it was  one of my very  first, and no thought of using it for natural  history purposes occurred at the time.  I merely  made what I  considered a beautiful likeness, and this was so appreciated  whenever shown, that I went further and painted it in water  colours.    Since moth pictures have accumulated, and moth history has  engrossed me with its intense interest, I have been very careful  in making studies to give each one its proper environment when  placing it before my camera.  Of all the flowers in our garden,  Celeus prefers the hollyhocks.  At least it comes to them oftenest  and remains at them longest.  But it moves continually and flies so  late that a picture of it has been a task.  After years of fruitless  effort, I made one passable snapshot early in July, while the light  was sufficiently strong that a printable picture could be had by  intensifying the plate, and one good time exposure as a Celeus, with  half-folded wings, clambered over a hollyhock, possibly hunting a  spot on which to deposit an egg or two.  The hollyhock painting of  this chapter is from this study.  The flowers were easy but it required  a second trial to do justice to the complicated markings of the moth.    This evening lover and strong flyer, with its swallow-like sweep of  wing, comes into the colour schemes of nature with the otter, that  at rare times thrusts a sleek grey head from the river, with the  grey-brown cotton-tails that bound across the stubble, and the  coots that herald dawn in the marshes.  Exactly the shades, and  almost the markings of its wings can be found on very old rail fences.  This lint shows lighter colour, and even grey when used in the house  building of wasps and orioles, but I know places in the country where  I could carve an almost perfectly shaded Celeus wing from a  weather-beaten old snake fence rail.    Celeus visits many flowers, almost all of the trumpet-shaped ones,  in fact, but if I were an artist I scarcely would think it right to  paint a hollyhock without putting King Celeus somewhere in the picture,  poised on his"]]]
