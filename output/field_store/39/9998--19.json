Vanderbelle Genotte._]          PIGS' TROTTERS IN BLANQUETTE    Any part of pork or veal is good done in this way. Take your pieces of  meat and fry them in butter till they are a good golden brown color. Put  them in a pan, covering them with water, and adding a sliced onion,  a bay leaf, a whole carrot, a leek, pepper, salt,--let it all simmer  gently over a slow fire till the meat is cooked but not boiled. Take the  pieces from the liquor and pass it through a sieve. Mix a little rice  flour in a cup of cold water, stirring well. Drop in the juice of half  a lemon and the beaten yolk of an egg, which stir round quickly. Put in  the meat again for a moment and serve it with boiled potatoes.          LOIN OF MUTTON IN THE POT    Put in an earthenware pot three shallots, finely minced; take a bit of  garlic, cut it close and rub it round the side of the pot; put in as  well a lump of butter, pepper and salt, and some rather fat gravy.  Divide the loin and put six chops in to simmer for three quarters of an  hour on a moderate fire, covering the pot with the lid. Before you serve  it, stir in a little lemon juice and stir up the sauce. To be served  with Cauliflower a la Aerschot as follows: Cut your cauliflower into  medium pieces, seeing that it is very clean, while you have some salted  water boiling up. Put in the pieces, boil till tender, then drain them  on a sieve. Put leaves and trimming of the vegetable into the pot to  simmer and serve as basis for a vegetable soup. Make a good white  sauce, adding the yolk of an egg, and flavoring it with nutmeg. Put the  vegetable on a dish and pour over the sauce, letting it stand for a few  moments by the fire before it is eaten.    [_Madame Herman Noppen._]          OX TONGUE WITH SPINACH AND WHITE SAUCE    Boil the tongue in salted water till the outer skin will peel off. Take  this off, then put the tongue back in the liquor to simmer while you  prepare the same. Take a piece of butter the size of an egg, melt it and  mix it with two dessertspoonfuls of ground rice, add some of the liquor,  pepper, and salt, stir well, so that it makes a good cream; drop in the  yolks of two eggs, always stirring, and a little lemon juice. Serve  the tongue whole with this sauce poured over it and spinach done in the  following way: Wash the spinach in running water till every bit of grit  has gone. Put some water on to boil, salt it well, and throw in the  spinach which you have freed from mid-rib and stalk. The water must be  boiling and the fire brisk. When tender, pass the spinach through the  sieve, then put a bit of butter into an enameled saucepan, then the  spinach, which heat for six minutes, add a little pepper. Serve it with  the tongue, and you can garnish as well with little croutons of bread  fried in butter.    [_Madame Herman Noppen_.]          VEAL FRITTERS    If you have only a little piece of veal or other cold meat, you can make  a very presentable dish in the following way: Cut a thin slice of meat  and spread on each side of it a layer of mashed potatoes to which you  have added some tomato sauce. Beat up an egg and dip the slices and  potato into it, lay them in fine breadcrumbs and fry them till a good  golden color in plenty of fat. Send them to table under a hot cover.    [_Pour la Patrie._]          STEWED BEEF    If you are obliged to make a hot dish in a hurry and have only a piece  of inferior meat, there is no better way of using it than by dressing  it in the Brabant way, which is rather expensive. Clean and cook some  mushrooms, and when fried lightly, add them and their liquor to your  beef, cut up in small pieces, but not minced. Add pepper, salt, a dust  of spices, or an onion with three or four cloves in it, and a half  bottle of good red wine. Stew all together for at least twenty minutes,  take out the onion and cloves, and serve in the dish it was cooked in  which should be an earthenware pot.    [_Pour la Patrie._]          A MUTTON SALAD    Cut some slices of cold mutton or lamb, removing every bit of fat and  skin that you can, unless that destroys the firmness of the slice.  Prepare a salad of lettuce, and if you cannot give a mayonnaise sauce,  add to the lettuce plenty of sliced cucumber, for that keeps the mutton  moist. Put the salad on each slice and roll the meat over as tightly as  you can. Lay the rolls closely together in a dish and sprinkle a very  little salad dressing over them. This way of doing meat is very useful  for taking to picnics, or for taking on a long journey.    [_Pour la Patrie._]          SAUSAGE PATTIES    Half a pound of sausage meat of any kind that you like. Make some rounds  of paste, lay the meat on half of each round and fold over. Steam for  quarter of an hour, or stew in plenty of gravy.    [_Pour la Patrie_.]          SAUSAGE AND POTATOES    Roll some cooked sausage meat in mashed potatoes, making a roll for  each person. Brush the potatoes over with milk and put them to bake till  nicely browned. Decorate with gherkins on each roll of butter.    [_Pour la Patrie_.]          RAGOUT OF COLD MEAT    Take any cold meat that you have, free it from fat and skin and cut it  in rounds like a five-franc piece. If you have some lean bacon or ham,  a little of that should be added. I should tell you first of all to put  some rice on to boil in boiling water. Make a sauce of flour and butter  in a pan, adding gravy if you happen to have it, but failing that, use  water and vinegar in equal parts to thin it; season with pepper and salt  and a small spoonful of anchovy sauce. When the sauce is heating, put in  the meat and cover the pan, let it all heat for twelve minutes and then  place meat and sauce in the middle of a dish. By this time the rice may  be tender. Drain it well and put it as a border to the stew.    [_Aimee._]          A QUICKLY MADE STEW    Put a piece of butter in a stewpan, with an onion cut in pieces, a few  cloves, salt and pepper, a tablespoonful of shredded parsley, and if you  have it some good gravy or meat juice and water. Throw into the sauce  some cold meat, preferably underdone, and after it has simmered for  fifteen minutes take a cut onion and rub with it the bottom of the  dish that you are going to use. Take a good glass of red wine, such as  Burgundy and mix it with the yolk of an egg, stir this into the stew and  serve up in a couple of minutes.    [_Madame Groubet._]          GRENADINES OF VEAL    Take a fireproof dish, and after sprinkling it with breadcrumbs put in  it a layer of roast veal in slices, a layer of mashed potatoes, a layer  of veal kidney, partly cooked, and cut into pieces and lastly a layer  of potato. Cover the whole with a bechamel sauce into which you have  stirred some grated cheese; put it to bake in the oven. Then make a  brown sauce with any veal or kidney gravy that you have, and cook some  mushrooms in it with pepper and salt; the sauce is to be served with the  grenadine.          HOCHE POT    Slice an onion and fry it in butter till it is brown; add pieces of pork  and of mutton freed from fat and skin; cover them with water and throw  into it any kinds of vegetables that you may have; but particularly  sliced carrots and turnips and green cabbages; put it in the oven to  cook. In another saucepan boil some white haricot beans, salt, and  pepper, until they are tender, when they must be added to the stew with  a small quantity of the liquor that they have been boiled in.          PIGEON AND CABBAGE ROLLS    Take two pigeons, two cabbages, four slices of fried bacon, an ounce  of butter, a large wineglassful of sherry, and some gravy. Truss your  pigeons and cook them in butter for ten minutes in a fireproof dish.  Then take them out, cut them into neat pieces. Meanwhile have the  cabbages boiled in salted water. Drain them. Cut them in small pieces  and roll some up in each slice of bacon; lay the pigeons on top, pouring  over them the liquor they were cooked in and half the wine. Put all in  the oven for ten minutes--pour in the rest of the wine and leave for  another ten minutes before serving. If you have stock to add to this it  is an improvement, or put half a teaspoonful of meat extract to half a  pint of water.    [_Une refugiee_.]          REMAINS OF SAUSAGE    If you have a few inches of a big sausage cut it into as thick slices as  you can--fry them and lay them in a circle on a dish with a poached egg  on each. Little dinner breads are good when soaked in milk, stuffed with  sausage meat, and fried. It can be used to stuff cucumber, or eggplants,  but you should then crumble up the meat and bind it with the yolk of a  raw egg.    [_Mme. Georgette._]          SHOULDER OF LAMB A LA BEIGE    Braise your shoulder of lamb; that is, put it in a closely covered  stewpan, in a good brown sauce or gravy with the vegetables, to be  served with it. It is the lid being closed that makes the meat take some  flavor from the vegetables. To do it in the Belgian way, take some good  white turnips, wash them and scrape them, put small ones in whole, large  ones cut in half. Take some small cabbages, trim off without leaves, cut  them in half, remove the stalk, make a hollow in the center and fill it  with forcemeat of any kind; but sausage meat is good. Place the stuffed  cabbages round the meat to cook gently at the same time.    [_Madame Vershagen._]          FILLET OF BEEF A LA BRABANCONNE    Take a whole fillet of beef, trim it neatly and set it in a braising pan  to cook very slowly in some good brown sauce to which you have added a  pint of stock. Put in neatly shaped carrots and turnips and some balls  made of mashed potato already fried. Keep hot in two sauceboats a puree  of Brussels sprouts and a puree of onions. These are prepared by cooking  the vegetables in water, then chopping fine, and rubbing through a sieve  with cream, or with a little good milk, pepper, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7234"],[0,"Species and Varieties, Their Origin (#16)"],[1," special names. The small barley and the  small wheat of the lake-dwellers are among them. All in all there were  ten well distinguished varieties of cereals, the Panicum and the Setaria  or millet being of the number. Oats were evidently introduced only  toward the very last of the lake-dwelling period, and rye is of far  later introduction into western Europe. Similar results are attained by  the examination of the cereals figured by the Romans of the same period.    All these are archaeologic facts, and give but slight indications  concerning the methods of cultivation or the real condition of the  cultivated races of that time. Virgil has left us some knowledge of the  requirements of methodical [106] culture of cereals of his time. In his  poem _Georgics_ (I. 197) the following lines are found:         _Vidi lecta din, et multo spectata labore     Degenerare tamen, ni vis humana quotannis     Maxima quaeque manu legeret_.       (The chosen seed, through years and labor improved,     Was seen to run back, unless yearly     Man selected by hand the largest and fullest of ears.)    Elsewhere Virgil and also some lines of Columella and Varro go to prove  in the same way that selection was applied by the Romans to their  cereals, and that it was absolutely necessary to keep their races pure.  There is little doubt, but that it was the same principle as that which  has led, after many centuries, to the complete isolation and improvement  of the very best races of the mixed varieties. It further proves that  the mixed conditions of the cereals was known to man at that time,  although distinct ideas of specific marks and differences were of course  still wholly lacking. It is proof also that cultivated cereals from the  earliest times must have been built up of numerous elementary forms.  Moreover it is very probable, that in the lapse of centuries a goodly  number of such types must have disappeared. [107] Among the vanished  forms are the special barley and wheat of the lake-dwellings, the  remains of which have been accidentally preserved, but most of the forms  must have disappeared without leaving any trace.    This inference is supported by the researches of Solms-Laubach, who  found that in Abyssinia numerous primitive types of cereals are still in  culture. They are not adequate to compete with our present varieties,  and would no doubt also have disappeared, had they not been preserved by  such quite accidental and almost primitive isolation.    Closing this somewhat long digression into history we will now resume  our discussion concerning the origin of the method of selecting cereals  for isolation and segregate-cultivation. Some decades after Le Couteur,  this method was taken up by the celebrated breeder Patrick Sheriff of  Haddington in Scotland. His belief, which was general at that time, was  \"That cultivation has not been found to change well defined kinds, and  that improvement can be best attained by selecting new and superior  varieties, which nature occasionally produces, as if inviting the  husbandman to stretch forth his hand and cultivate them.\"    Before going into the details of Sheriff's work it is as well to say  something concerning [108] the use of the word \"selection.\" This word  was used by Sheriff as seen in the quotation given, and it was obviously  designed to convey the same idea as the word \"lecta\" in the quotation  from Virgil. It was a choice of the best plants from among known mixed  fields, but the chosen individuals were considered to be representatives  of pure and constant races, which could only be isolated, but not  ameliorated. Selection therefore, in the primitive sense of the word, is  the choice of elementary species and varieties, with no other purpose  than that of keeping them as pure as possible from the admixture of  minor sorts. The Romans attained this end only imperfectly, simply  because the laws governing the struggle for life and the competition of  numerous sorts in the fields were unsuspected by them.    Le Couteur and Sheriff succeeded in the solution of the problem, because  they had discovered the importance of isolation. The combination of a  careful choice with subsequent isolation was all they knew about it, and  it was one of the great achievements to which modern agriculture owes  its success.    The other great principle was that of Vilmorin. It was the improvement  within the race, or the \"amelioration of the race\" as it was termed by  him. It was introduced into [109] England by F.F. Hallett of Brighton in  Sussex, who at once called it \"pedigree-culture,\" and produced his first  new variety under the very name of \"Pedigree-wheat.\" This principle,  which yields improved strains, that are not constant but dependent on  the continued and careful choice of the best plants in each succeeding  generation, is now generally called \"selection.\" But it should always be  remembered that according to the historic evolution of the idea, the  word has the double significance of the distinction and isolation of  constant races from mixtures, and that of the choice of the best  representatives of a race during all the years of its existence. Even  sugar-beets, the oldest \"selected\" agricultural plants, are far from  having freed themselves from the necessity of continuous improvement.  Without this they would not remain constant, but would retrograde with  great rapidity.    The double meaning of the word selection still prevailed when Darwin  published his \"Origin of Species.\" This was in the year 1859, and at  that time Shirreff was the highest authority and the most successful  breeder of cereals. Vilmorin's method had been applied only to beets,  and Hallett had commenced his pedigree-cultures only a few years before  and his first publication of the \"Pedigree-wheat\" [110] appeared some  years later at the International Exhibition of London in 1862. Hence,  whenever Darwin speaks of selection, Shirreff's use of the word may as  well be meant as that of Vilmorin.    However, before going deeper into such theoretical questions, we will  first consider the facts, as given by Shirreff himself.    During the best part of his life, in fact during the largest part of the  first half of the nineteenth century, Shirreff worked according to a  very simple principle. When quite young he had noticed that sometimes  single plants having better qualities than the average were seen in the  fields. He saved the grains, or sometimes the whole heads of such plants  separately, and tried to multiply them in such manner as to avoid  intermixtures.    His first result was the \"Mungoswell's wheat.\" In the spring of 1819 he  observed quite accidentally in a field of the farm of that name, a  single plant which attracted his attention by a deeper green and by  being more heavily headed out. Without going into further details, he at  once chose this specimen as the starting point of a new race. He  destroyed the surrounding plants so as to give it more space, applied  manure to its roots, and tended it with special care. It yielded 63  heads and nearly [111] 2500 grains. All of these were sown the  following fall, and likewise in the succeeding years the whole harvest  was sown in separate lots. After two years of rapid multiplication it  proved to be a good new variety and was brought into commerce. It has  become one of the prominent varieties of wheat in East Lothian, that  county of Scotland of which Haddington is the principal borough.    The grains of \"Mungoswell's wheat\" are whiter than those of the allied  \"Hunter's wheat,\" more rounded but otherwise of the same size acid  weight. The straw is taller and stronger, and each plant produces more  culms and more heads.    Shirreff assumed, that the original plant of this variety was a sport  from the race in which he had found it, and that it was the only  instance of this sport. He gives no details about this most interesting  side of the question, omitting even to tell the name of the parent  variety. He only asserts that it was seen to be better, and afterwards  proved so by the appreciation of other breeders and its success in  trade. He observed it to be quite constant from the beginning, no  subsequent selection being needed. This important feature was simply  assumed by him to be true as a matter of course.    [112] Some years afterwards, in the summer of 1824, he observed a large  specimen of oats in one of the fields of the same farm. Being at that  time occupied in making a standard collection of oats for a closer  comparison of the varieties, he saved the seeds of that plant and sowed  them in a row in his experiment-field. It yielded the largest culms of  the whole collection and bore long and heavy kernels with a red streak  on the concave side and it excelled all other sorts by the fine  qualities of its very white meal. In the unequal length of its stalks it  has however a drawback, as the field appears thinner and more meager  than it is in reality. \"Hopetown oats,\" as it is called, has found its  way into culture extensively in Scotland and has even been introduced  with success into England, Denmark and the United States. It has been  one of the best Scottish oats for more than half a century.    The next eight years no single plant judged worthy of selection on his  own farm attracted Shirreff's attention. But in the fall of 1832 he saw  a beautiful plant of wheat on a neighboring farm and he secured a head  of it with about 100 grains. From this he produced the \"Hopetown wheat.\"  After careful separation from the kernels this original ear was  preserved, and was afterwards exhibited at the Stirling Agricultural  [113] Museum. The \"Hopetown wheat\" has proved to be a constant variety,  excelling the ordinary \"Hunter's wheat\" by larger grains and longer  heads; it yields likewise a straw of superior quality and has become  quite popular in large districts of England and Scotland, where it is  known by"]]]
