We may therefore conclude that geotropism does not give a radicle  force sufficient to penetrate the ground, but merely tells it (if such an  expression may be used) which course to pursue. Before we knew of Sachs'  more precise observations we covered a flat surface of damp sand with the  thinnest tin-foil which we could procure (.02 to .03 mm., or .00012 to  .00079 of an inch in thickness), and placed a radicle close above, in such  a position that it grew almost perpendicularly downwards. When the apex  came into contact with the polished level surface it turned at right angles  and glided over it without leaving any impression; yet the tin-foil was so  flexible, that a little stick of soft wood, pointed to the same degree as  the end of the radicle and gently loaded with a weight of only a quarter of  an ounce (120 grains) plainly indented the tin-foil.    Radicles are able to penetrate the ground by the force due to their  longitudinal and transverse growth; the seeds themselves being held down by  the weight of the superincumbent soil. In the case of the bean the apex,  protected by the root-cap, is sharp, and the growing part, from 8 to 10 mm.  in length, is much more rigid, as Sachs has proved, than the part  immediately above, which has ceased to increase in length. We endeavoured  to ascertain the downward pressure of the growing part, by placing  germinating beans between two small metal plates, the upper one of which  was loaded with a known weight; and the  [page 74]  radicle was then allowed to grow into a narrow hole in wood, 2 or 3 tenths  of an inch in depth, and closed at the bottom. The wood was so cut that the  short space of radicle between the mouth of the hole and the bean could not  bend laterally on three sides; but it was impossible to protect the fourth  side, close to the bean. Consequently, as long as the radicle continued to  increase in length and remained straight, the weighted bean would be lifted  up after the tip had reached the bottom of the shallow hole. Beans thus  arranged, surrounded by damp sand, lifted up a quarter of a pound in 24 h.  after the tip of the radicle had entered the hole. With a greater weight  the radicles themselves always became bent on the one unguarded side; but  this probably would not have occurred if they had been closely surrounded  on all sides by compact earth. There was, however, a possible, but not  probable, source of error in these trials, for it was not ascertained  whether the beans themselves go on swelling for several days after they  have germinated, and after having been treated in the manner in which ours  had been; namely, being first left for 24 h. in water, then allowed to  germinate in very damp air, afterwards placed over the hole and almost  surrounded by damp sand in a closed box.    Fig. 55. Outline of piece of stick (reduced to one-half natural size) with  a hole through which the radicle of a bean grew. Thickness of stick at  narrow end .08 inch, at broad end .16; depth of hole .1 inch.  We succeeded better in ascertaining the force exerted transversely by these  radicles. Two were so placed as to penetrate small holes made in little  sticks, one of which was cut into the shape here exactly copied (Fig. 55).  The short end of the stick beyond the hole was purposely split, but not the  opposite  [page 75]  end. As the wood was highly elastic, the split or fissure closed  immediately after being made. After six days the stick and bean were dug  out of the damp sand, and the radicle was found to be much enlarged above  and beneath the hole. The fissure which was at first quite closed, was now  open to a width of 4 mm.; as soon as the radicle was extracted, it  immediately closed to a width of 2 mm. The stick was then suspended  horizontally by a fine wire passing through the hole lately filled by the  radicle, and a little saucer was suspended beneath to receive the weights;  and it required 8 lbs. 8 ozs. to open the fissure to the width of 4 mm.--  that is, the width before the root was extracted. But the part of the  radicle (only .1 of an inch in length) which was embedded in the hole,  probably exerted a greater transverse strain even than 8 lbs. 8 ozs., for  it had split the solid wood for a length of rather more than a quarter of  an inch (exactly .275 inch), and this fissure is shown in Fig. 55. A second  stick was tried in the same manner with almost exactly the same result.    Fig. 56. Wooden pincers, kept closed by a spiral brass spring, with a hole  (.14 inch in diameter and .6 inch in depth) bored through the narrow closed  part, through which a radicle of a bean was allowed to grow. Temp. 50o -  60o F.    We then followed a better plan. Holes were bored near the narrow end of two  wooden clips or pincers (Fig. 56), kept closed by brass spiral springs. Two  radicles in damp sand were allowed to grow through these holes. The  [page 76]  pincers rested on glass-plates to lessen the friction from the sand. The  holes were a little larger (viz..14 inch) and considerably deeper (viz..6  inch) than in the trials with the sticks; so that a greater length of a  rather thicker radicle exerted a transverse strain. After 13 days they were  taken up. The distance of two dots (see the figure) on the longer ends of  the pincers was now carefully measured; the radicles were then extracted  from the holes, and the pincers of course closed. They were then suspended  horizontally in the same manner as were the bits of sticks, and a weight of  1500 grams (or 3 pounds 4 ounces) was necessary with one of the pincers to  open them to the same extent as had been effected by the transverse growth  of the radicle. As soon as this radicle had slightly opened the pincers, it  had grown into a flattened form and had escaped a little beyond the hole;  its diameter in one direction being 4.2 mm., and at rightangles 3.5 mm. If  this escape and flattening could have been prevented, the radicle would  probably have exerted a greater strain than the 3 pounds 4 ounces. With the  other pincers the radicle escaped still further out of the hole; and the  weight required to open them to the same extent as had been effected by the  radicle, was only 600 grams.    With these facts before us, there seems little difficulty in understanding  how a radicle penetrates the ground. The apex is pointed and is protected  by the root-cap; the terminal growing part is rigid, and increases in  length with a force equal, as far as our observations can be trusted, to  the pressure of at least a quarter of a pound, probably with a much greater  force when prevented from bending to any side by the surrounding earth.  Whilst thus increasing in length it increases in thickness, pushing away  the damp  [page 77]  earth on all sides, with a force of above 8 pounds in one case, of 3 pounds  in another case. It was impossible to decide whether the actual apex  exerts, relatively to its diameter, the same transverse strain as the parts  a little higher up; but there seems no reason to doubt that this would be  the case. The growing part therefore does not act like a nail when hammered  into a board, but more like a wedge of wood, which whilst slowly driven  into a crevice continually expands at the same time by the absorption of  water; and a wedge thus acting will split even a mass of rock.    Manner in which Hypocotyls, Epicotyls, etc., rise up and break through the  ground.--After the radicle has penetrated the ground and fixed the seed,  the hypocotyls of all the dicotyledonous seedlings observed by us, which  lift their cotyledons above the surface, break through the ground in the  form of an arch. When the cotyledons are hypogean, that is, remain buried  in the soil, the hypocotyl is hardly developed, and the epicotyl or plumule  rises in like manner as an arch through the ground. In all, or at least in  most of such cases, the downwardly bent apex remains for a time enclosed  within the seed-coats. With Corylus avellena the cotyledons are hypogean,  and the epicotyl is arched; but in the particular case described in the  last chapter its apex had been injured, and it grew laterally through the  soil like a root; and in consequence of this it had emitted two secondary  shoots, which likewise broke through the ground as arches.    Cyclamen does not produce any distinct stem, and only a single cotyledon  appears at first;* its petiole    * This is the conclusion arrived at by Dr. H. Gressner ('Bot. Zeitung,'  1874, p. 837), who maintains that what has been considered by other  botanists as the first true leaf is really the second cotyledon, which is  greatly delayed in its development.  [page 78]    breaks through the ground as an arch (Fig. 57). Abronia has only a single  fully developed cotyledon, but in this case it is the hypocotyl which first  emerges and is arched. Abronia umbellata, however, presents this  peculiarity, that the enfolded blade of the one developed cotyledon (with  the enclosed endosperm) whilst still beneath the surface has its apex  upturned and parallel to the descending leg of the arched hypocotyl; but it  is dragged out of the ground by the continued growth of the hypocotyl, with  the apex pointing downward. With Cycas pectinata the cotyledons are  hypogean, and a true leaf first breaks through the ground with its petiole  forming an arch.    Fig. 57.

It's good to hear you,  Dicky,\" as she closed the door.    \"Is he--is he--is he?\" cried Dick in a spasm of excitement, \"coming  right straight away, mamma?\"    \"Next week,\" said mamma, with happy eyes, \"he sails in the Servia. Next  week, Dicky, my boy, we will see papa. And here is the best part of the  secret. Listen; it has all been arranged that Mr. Duyckink shall live  in Liverpool, so that papa will not have to go across any more, but he  can stay at home with us. Oh, Dicky!\"    That \"Oh, Dicky!\" told volumes to the boy's heart.    \"Mamma,\" he said at last, \"isn't it good that God didn't give boys and  girls to Mr. Duyckink? Because you see if he had, why, then Mr.  Duyckink wouldn't like to live over there.\"    \"Mr. Duyckink might not have felt as your father does, Dicky dear,  about having his children educated at home; and Mrs. Duyckink wants to  go to England; she hasn't any father, as I have, Dicky dear, who clings  to the old home.\"    \"Only I wish God had made Mr. Duyckink and Mrs. Duyckink a little  sooner,\" said Dick reflectively. \"I mean, made them want to go to  England sooner, don't you, mamma?\"    \"I suppose we ought not to wish that,\" said his mother with a smile,  \"for perhaps we needed to be taught to be patient. Only now, Dicky,  just think, we can actually have papa live at home with us!\"    \"Your cheeks are pink now,\" observed Dick; \"just the very pink they  used to be, mamma.\"    Mrs. Whitney ran to the old-fashioned looking-glass hanging in its  pine-stained frame, between the low windows, and peered in. \"Do I look  just as I did when papa went away six months ago, Dicky?\" she asked,  anxiously.    \"Yes,\" said Dick, \"just like that, only a great deal nicer,\" he added  enthusiastically.    His mother laughed and pulled at a bright wave on her forehead, dodging  a bit to avoid a long crack running across the looking-glass front.    \"Here's Dr. Fisher!\" shouted Dick suddenly. \"Now, you old fellow, you,\"  and shaking his small fist at his lame leg, \"you've got to get well, I  tell you. I won't wait much longer, sir!\" And as the doctor came in,  \"I've a secret.\"    \"Well, then, you would better keep it,\" said Dr. Fisher. \"Good  morning,\" to Mrs. Whitney. \"Our young man here is getting ahead pretty  fast, I should think. How's the leg, Dicky?\" sitting down by him.    \"The leg is all right,\" cried Dick; \"I'm going to step on it,\" trying  to get out of the chair.    \"Dicky!\" cried his mother in alarm.    \"Softly--softly now, young man,\" said Dr. Fisher. \"I suppose you want  me to cure that leg of yours, and make it as good as the other one,  don't you?\"    \"Why, of course,\" replied Dick; \"that's what you are a doctor for.\"    \"Well, I won't agree to do anything of the sort,\" said the little  doctor coolly, \"if you don't do your part. Do you know what patience  means?\"    \"I've been patient,\" exclaimed Dick, in a dudgeon, \"forever and ever so  many weeks, and now papa is coming home, and I\"--    And then he realized what he had done, and he turned quite pale, and  looked at his mother.    Her face gave no sign, but he sank back in his chair, feeling disgraced  for life, and ready to keep quiet forever. And he was so good while Dr.  Fisher was attending to his leg that when he was through, the little  doctor turned to him approvingly: \"Well, sir, I think that I can  promise that you can go home Saturday. You've improved beyond my  expectation.\"    But Dick didn't \"hurrah,\" nor even smile.    \"Dicky,\" said Mrs. Whitney, smiling into his downcast face, \"how glad  we are to hear that; just think, good Dr. Fisher says we may go next  Saturday.\"    \"I'm glad,\" mumbled Dick, in a forlorn little voice, and till after the  door closed on the retreating form of the doctor, it was all that could  be gotten out of him. Then he turned and put out both arms to his  mother.    \"I didn't mean--I didn't mean--I truly didn't mean--to tell--mamma,\" he  sobbed, as she clasped him closely.    \"I know you didn't, dear,\" she soothed him. \"It has really done no  harm; papa didn't want the home people to know, as he wants to surprise  them.\"    \"But it was a secret,\" said Dick, between his tears, feeling as if he  had lost a precious treasure entrusted to him. \"Oh, mamma! I really  didn't mean to let it go.\"    \"Mamma feels quite sure of that,\" said Mrs. Whitney gently. \"You are  right, Dicky, in feeling sorry and ashamed, because anything given to  you to keep is not your own but belongs to another; but, my boy, the  next duty is to keep back those tears--all this is hurting your leg.\"    Dick struggled manfully, but still the tears rolled down his cheeks. At  last he said, raising his head, \"You would much better let me have my  cry out, mamma; it's half-way, and it hurts to send it back.\"    \"Well, I don't think so,\" said Mrs. Whitney, with a laugh. \"I've often  wanted to have a cry out, as you call it. But that's weak, Dicky, and  should be stopped, for the more one cries, the more one wants to.\"    \"You've often wanted to have a cry out?\" repeated Dick, in such  amazement that every tear just getting ready to show itself immediately  rushed back again. \"Why, you haven't anything to cry for, mamma.\"    \"Indeed I have,\" she declared; \"often and often, I do many things that  I ought not to do\"--    \"Oh! never, never,\" cried Dick, clutching her around the neck, to the  detriment of her lace-trimmed wrapper. \"My sweetest, dearingest mamma  is ever and always just right.\"    \"Indeed, Dick,\" said Mrs. Whitney earnestly, \"the longer I live, I find  that every day I have something to be sorry for in myself. But God, you  know, is good,\" she whispered softly.    Dick was silent.    \"And then when papa goes,\" continued Mrs. Whitney, \"why, then, my boy,  it is very hard not to cry.\"    Here was something that the boy could grasp; and he seized it with  avidity.    \"And you stop crying for us,\" he cried; \"I know now why you always put  on your prettiest gown, and play games with us the evening after papa  goes. I know now.\"    \"Here are three letters,\" cried the parson, hurrying in, and tossing  them over to the boy. \"And Polly Pepper has written to me, too.\"    Dick screamed with delight. \"Two for me; one from Ben, and one from  Grandpapa!\"    \"And mine is from Phronsie,\" said Mrs. Whitney, seizing an epistle  carefully printed in blue crayon.    But although there were three letters from home, none of them carried  the news of what was going on there. None of them breathed a syllable  that Cousin Eunice Chatterton was ill with a low fever, aggravated by  nervous prostration; and that Mrs. Pepper and Polly were having a  pretty hard time of it. On the contrary, every bit of news was of the  cheeriest nature; Jasper tucked on a postscript to his father's letter,  in which he gave the latest bulletin of his school life. And Polly did  the same thing to Ben's letter. Even Phronsie went into a long detail  concerning the new developments of a wonderful kitten she had left at  home, to take her visit to Badgertown, so the two recipients never  missed the lack of information in regard to the household life, from  which they were shut out.    Only once Mrs. Whitney said thoughtfully, as she folded her letter and  slipped it back into its envelope, \"They don't speak of Mrs.  Chatterton. I presume she has changed her plans, and is going to remain  longer at her nephew's.\"    \"I hope she'll live there always,\" declared Dick, looking up savagely  from Ben's letter. \"What an old guy she is, mamma!\"    \"Dick, Dick,\" said his mother reprovingly, \"she is our guest, you know.\"    \"Not if she is at her nephew's,\" said Dick triumphantly, turning back  to his letter.    Polly at this identical minute was slowly ascending the stairs, a tray  in one hand, the contents of which she was anxiously regarding on the  way.    \"I do hope it is right now,\" she said, and presently knocked at Mrs.  Chatterton's door.    \"Come in,\" said that lady's voice fretfully. And \"Do close the door,\"  before Polly and her tray were well within.    Polly shut the door gently, and approached the bedside.    \"I am so faint I do not know that I can take any,\" said Mrs.  Chatterton. Whether it was her white cashmere dressing-robe, and her  delicate lace cap that made her face against the pillows seem wan and  white, Polly did not know. But it struck her that she looked more ill  than usual, and she said earnestly, \"I am so sorry I wasn't quicker.\"    \"There is no call for an apology from you,\" said Mrs. Chatterton  coldly. \"Set the tray down on the table, and get a basin of water; I  need to be bathed.\"    Polly stood quite still, even forgetting to deposit the tray.    \"Set the tray down, I told you,\" repeated Mrs. Chatterton sharply, \"and  then get the basin of water.\"    \"I will call Hortense,\" said Polly quietly, placing the tray as desired.    \"Hortense has gone to the apothecary's,\" said Mrs. Chatterton, \"and I  will not have one of the other maids; they are too insufferable.\"    And indeed Polly knew that it would be small use to summon one of them,  as Martha, the most obliging, had airily tossed her head when asked to  do some little service for the sick woman that very morning, declaring,  \"I will never lift another finger for that Madame Chatterton.\"    \"My neck aches, and my side, and my head,\" said Mrs. Chatterton  irritably; \"why do you not do as I bid you?\"    For one long instant, Polly hesitated; then she turned to rush from the  room, a flood of angry, bitter feelings surging through her heart, more  at the insufferable tone and manner, than at what she was bidden to do.  Only turned; and she was back by the side of the bed, and looking down  into the fretful, dictatorial old face.    \"I will"]]]
