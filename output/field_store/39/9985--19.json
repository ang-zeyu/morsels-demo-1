One is afraid of  giving trouble, and altogether it is different. I have heard all  the news, my boy. Master Peters tried his best to conceal it from  me, but I was sure by his manner that there was something wrong.  It was better that I should know at once,\" she went on, wiping her  eyes. \"Terrible as it all is, I have scarce time to think about  it now when my mind is taken up with your father's danger. And it  hardly came upon me even as a surprise, for I have long felt that  some evil must have befallen them or they would have assuredly  managed to send me word of themselves before now.\"    By this time the Good Venture had entered the port, and had drawn  up close beside one of the wharves. As soon as the sails were lowered  and the warps made fast, Peters directed three of the seamen to  bring up the boxes from the cabin, and to follow him. Ned then led  the way to the new house.    \"I will go up first, mother, and tell them that you have come.\"    Mrs. Martin quietly removed her hat and cloak, followed Ned upstairs,  and entered her husband's room with a calm and composed face.    \"Well, my dear husband,\" she said almost cheerfully, \"I have come  to nurse you. You see when you get into trouble it is us women that  you men fall back upon after all.\"    The doctor, who had retired into the next room when he heard that  Mrs. Martin had arrived, nodded his head with a satisfied air. \"She  will do,\" he said. \"I have not much fear for my patient now.\"    Ned, knowing that he would not be wanted upstairs for some time,  went out with Peters after the baggage had been set down in the  lower room.    \"So you had a fine voyage of it, Peters?\"    \"We should have been better for a little more wind, both coming and  going,\" the mate said; \"but there was nothing much to complain of.\"    \"You could not have been long in the river then, Peters?\"    \"We were six and thirty hours in port. We got in at the top of tide  on Monday morning, and went down with the ebb on Tuesday evening.  First, as in duty bound, I went to see our good dame and give her  your letter, and answer her questions. It was a hard business that,  and I would as lief have gone before the queen herself to give  her an account of things as to have gone to your mother. Of course  I hoisted the flag as we passed up the river. I knew that some of  them were sure to be on watch at Rotherhithe, and that they would  run in and tell her that the Good Venture was in port again. I had  rather hoped that our coming back so soon might lead her to think  that something was wrong, for she would have known that we could  scarce have gone to Amsterdam and discharged, loaded up again, and  then back here, especially as the wind had been light ever since  she sailed. And sure enough the thought had struck her; for when  I caught sight of the garden gate one of your sisters was there on  the lookout, and directly she saw me she ran away in. I hurried on  as fast as I could go then, for I knew that Mistress Martin would  be sorely frightened when she heard that it was neither your father  nor you. As I got there your mother was standing at the door. She  was just as white as death. 'Cheer up, mistress,' I said as cheery  as I could speak. 'I have bad news for you, but it might have been  a deal worse. The captain's got a hurt, and Master Ned is stopping  to nurse him.'    \"She looked at me as if she would read me through. 'That's the  truth as I am a Christian man, mistress,' I said. 'It has been a  bad business, but it might have been a deal worse. The doctor said  that he was doing well.' Then your mother gave a deep sigh, and  I thought for a moment she was going to faint, and ran forward to  catch her; but she seemed to make an effort and straighten herself  up, just as I have seen the brig do when a heavy sea has flooded  her decks and swept all before it.    \"'Thanks be to the good God that he is not taken from me,' she  said. 'Now I can bear anything. Now, Peters, tell me all about it.'    \"'I ain't good at telling a story, Mistress Martin,' I said; 'but  here is Master Ned's letter. When you have read that maybe I can  answer questions as to matters of which he may not have written. I  will stand off and on in the garden, ma'am, and then you can read  it comfortable like indoors, and hail me when you have got to the  bottom of it.' It was not many minutes before one of your sisters  called me in. They had all been crying, and I felt more uncomfortable  than I did when those Spanish rascals gave us a broadside as I went  in, for I was afraid she would so rake me with questions that she  would get out of me that other sad business; and it could hardly  be expected that even the stoutest ship should weather two such  storms, one after the other.    \"'I don't understand it all, Master Peters,' she said, 'for my son  gives no good reason why the Spaniards should thus have attacked an  English ship; but we can talk of that afterwards. All that matters  at present is, that my husband has been wounded and has lost his  leg, and lies in some danger; for although Ned clearly makes the  best of it, no man can suffer a hurt like that without great risk  of life. He wishes me to go over at once. As to the girls, he says  I can take them with me or leave them with a friend here. But they  wish, as is natural, greatly to go; and it were better for all  reasons that they did so. Were they left here they would be in  anxiety about their father's state, and as it may be long before he  can be moved I should not like to leave them in other charge than  my own. When will you be ready to sail again?\"    \"'I shall be ready by tomorrow evening's tide, Mistress Martin,' I  said. 'I have cargo on board that I must discharge, and must have  carpenters and sailmakers on board to repair some of the damages  we suffered in this action. I do not think I can possibly be ready  to drop down the river before high water tomorrow, which will be  about six o'clock. I will send a boat to the stairs here at half  past five to take you and your trunks on board.'    \"'We shall be ready,' she said. 'As Ned says that my husband is well  cared for in the house of the burgomaster, and has every comfort  and attention, there is nothing I need take over for him.' I said  that I was sure he had all he could require, and that she need take  no trouble on that score; and then said that with her permission  I would go straight back on board again, seeing there was much to  do, and that it all came on my shoulders just at present.    \"I had left the bosun in charge, and told him to get the hatches  off and begin to get up the cargo as soon as he had stowed the  sails and made all tidy; for I had not waited for that, but had  rowed ashore as soon as the anchor was dropped. So without going  back to the brig I crossed the river and landed by the steps at  the bridge, and took the letters to the merchants for whom I had  goods, and prayed them to send off boats immediately, as it was  urgent for me to discharge as soon as possible; then I went to the  merchants whose names you had given me, and who ship goods with  us regularly, to tell them that the Venture was in port but would  sail again tomorrow evening, and would take what cargo they could  get on board for Enkhuizen or any of the seaward ports, but not  for Amsterdam or other places still in the hands of the Spaniards.    \"Then I went to the lord mayor and swore an information before  him to lay before the queen and the council that the Spaniards had  wantonly, and without offence given, attacked the Good Venture and  inflicted much damage upon her, and badly wounded her captain; and  would have sunk her had we not stoutly defended ourselves and beat  them off. I was glad when all that was over, Master Ned; for, as  you know, I know nought about writing. My business is to sail the  ship under your father's orders; but as to talking with merchants  who press you with questions, and seem to think that you have nought  to do but to stand and gossip, this is not in my way, and I wished  sorely that you had been with me, and could have taken all this  business into your hands.    \"Then I went down to the wharves, and soon got some carpenters at  work to mend the bulwarks and put some fresh planks on the deck  where the shot had ploughed it up. Luckily enough I heard of a man  who had some sails that he had bought from the owners of a ship  which was cast away down near the mouth of the river. They were a  little large for the Venture; but I made a bargain with him in your  father's name, and got them on board and set half a dozen sailmakers  to work upon them, and they were ready by the next afternoon. The  others will do again when they have got some new cloths in, and a  few patches; but if we had gone out with a dozen holes in them the  first Spaniard who saw us, and who had heard of our fight with the  Don Pedro, would have known us at once.    \"I was thankful, I can tell you, when I got on board again. Just  as I did so some lighters came out, and we were hard at work till  dusk getting out the cargo. The next morning at daylight fresh  cargo began to come out to us, and things went on well, and would  have gone better had not people come on board pestering me with  questions about our fight with the Spaniards. And just at noon two  of the queen's officers came down and must needs have the whole  story from beginning to end; and they had brought a clerk with  them to write it down from my lips. They said we had done right  gallantly, and that no doubt I should be wanted the next day at  the royal council to answer other questions touching the affair.  You may be sure I said no word about the fact that in six hours we  should be dropping down the river; for like enough if I had they  would have ordered me not to go, and as I should have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6955"],[0,"The Prince and Betty (#16)"],[1," gloomily, and now,  on the morning of Betty's departure from Mrs. Oakley's house with the  letter of introduction, was giving his final instructions to his  temporary successor.    This temporary successor in the editorship was none other than John's  friend, Rupert Smith, late of the _News_.    Smith, on leaving Harvard, had been attracted by newspaper work, and  had found his first billet on a Western journal of the type whose  society column consists of such items as \"Jim Thompson was to town  yesterday with a bunch of other cheap skates. We take this opportunity  of once more informing Jim that he is a liar and a skunk,\" and whose  editor works with a pistol on his desk and another in his hip-pocket.  Graduating from this, he had proceeded to a reporter's post on a daily  paper in Kentucky, where there were blood feuds and other Southern  devices for preventing life from becoming dull. All this was good, but  even while he enjoyed these experiences, New York, the magnet, had been  tugging at him, and at last, after two eventful years on the Kentucky  paper, he had come East, and eventually won through to the staff of the  _News_.    His presence in the office of _Peaceful Moments_ was due to the  uncomfortable habit of most of the New York daily papers of cutting  down their staff of reporters during the summer. The dismissed had, to  sustain them, the knowledge that they would return, like the swallows,  anon, and be received back into their old places; but in the meantime  they suffered the inconvenience of having to support themselves as best  they could. Smith, when, in the company of half-a-dozen others, he had  had to leave the _News_, had heard of the vacant post of assistant  editor on _Peaceful Moments_, and had applied for and received it.  Whereby he was more fortunate than some of his late colleagues; though,  as the character of his new work unrolled itself before him, he was  frequently doubtful on that point. For the atmosphere of _Peaceful  Moments_, however wholesome, was certainly not exciting, and his  happened to be essentially a nature that needed the stimulus of  excitement. Even in Park Row, the denizens of which street are rarely  slaves to the conventional and safe, he had a well-established  reputation in this matter. Others of his acquaintances welcomed  excitement when it came to them in the course of the day's work, but it  was Smith's practise to go in search of it. He was a young man of  spirit and resource.    His appearance, to those who did not know him, hardly suggested this.  He was very tall and thin, with a dark, solemn face. He was a purist in  the matter of clothes, and even in times of storm and stress presented  an immaculate appearance to the world. In his left eye, attached to a  cord, he wore a monocle.    Through this, at the present moment, he was gazing benevolently at Mr.  Renshaw, as the latter fussed about the office in the throes of  departure. To the editor's rapid fire of advice and warning he listened  with the pleased and indulgent air of a father whose infant son frisks  before him. Mr. Renshaw interested him. To Smith's mind Mr. Renshaw,  put him in any show you pleased, would alone have been worth the price  of admission.    \"Well,\" chirruped the holiday-maker--he was a little man with a long  neck, and he always chirruped--\"Well, I think that is all, Mr. Smith.  Oh, ah, yes! The stenographer. You will need a new stenographer.\"    The _Peaceful Moments_ stenographer had resigned her position  three days before, in order to get married.    \"Unquestionably, Comrade Renshaw,\" said Smith. \"A blonde.\"    Mr. Renshaw looked annoyed.    \"I have told you before, Mr. Smith, I object to your addressing me as  Comrade. It is not--it is not--er--fitting.\"    Smith waved a deprecating hand.    \"Say no more,\" he said. \"I will correct the habit. I have been studying  the principles of Socialism somewhat deeply of late, and I came to the  conclusion that I must join the cause. It looked good to me. You work  for the equal distribution of property, and start in by swiping all you  can and sitting on it. A noble scheme. Me for it. But I am interrupting  you.\"    Mr. Renshaw had to pause for a moment to reorganize his ideas.    \"I think--ah, yes. I think it would be best perhaps to wait for a day  or two in case Mrs. Oakley should recommend someone. I mentioned the  vacancy in the office to her, and she said she would give the matter  her attention. I should prefer, if possible, to give the place to her  nominee. She--\"    \"--has eighteen million a year,\" said Smith. \"I understand. Scatter  seeds of kindness.\"    Mr. Renshaw looked at him sharply. Smith's face was solemn and  thoughtful.    \"Nothing of the kind,\" the editor said, after a pause. \"I should prefer  Mrs. Oakley's nominee because Mrs. Oakley is a shrewd, practical woman  who--er--who--who, in fact--\"    \"Just so,\" said Smith, eying him gravely through the monocle.  \"Entirely.\"    The scrutiny irritated Mr. Renshaw.    \"Do put that thing away, Mr. Smith,\" he said.    \"That thing?\"    \"Yes, that ridiculous glass. Put it away.\"    \"Instantly,\" said Smith, replacing the monocle in his vest-pocket. \"You  object to it? Well, well, many people do. We all have these curious  likes and dislikes. It is these clashings of personal taste which  constitute what we call life. Yes. You were saying?\"    Mr. Renshaw wrinkled his forehead.    \"I have forgotten what I intended to say,\" he said querulously. \"You  have driven it out of my head.\"    Smith clicked his tongue sympathetically. Mr. Renshaw looked at his  watch.    \"Dear me,\" he said, \"I must be going. I shall miss my train. But I  think I have covered the ground quite thoroughly. You understand  everything?\"    \"Absolutely,\" said Smith. \"I look on myself as some engineer  controlling a machine with a light hand on the throttle. Or like some  faithful hound whose master--\"    \"Ah! There is just one thing. Mrs. Julia Burdett Parslow is a little  inclined to be unpunctual with her 'Moments with Budding Girlhood.' If  this should happen while I am away, just write her a letter, quite a  pleasant letter, you understand, pointing out the necessity of being in  good time. She must realize that we are a machine.\"    \"Exactly,\" murmured Smith.    \"The machinery of the paper cannot run smoothly unless contributors are  in good time with their copy.\"    \"Precisely,\" said Smith. \"They are the janitors of the literary world.  Let them turn off the steam heat, and where are we? If Mrs. Julia  Burdett Parslow is not up to time with the hot air, how shall our  'Girlhood' escape being nipped in the bud?\"    \"And there is just one other thing. I wish you would correct a slight  tendency I have noticed lately in Mr. Asher to be just a trifle--well,  not precisely risky, but perhaps a shade broad in his humor.\"    \"Young blood!\" sighed Smith. \"Young blood!\"    \"Mr. Asher is a very sensible man, and he will understand. Well, that  is all, I think. Now, I really must be going. Good-by, Mr. Smith.\"    \"Good-by.\"    At the door Mr. Renshaw paused with the air of an exile bidding  farewell to his native land, sighed and trotted out.    Smith put his feet upon the table, flicked a speck of dust from his  coat-sleeve, and resumed his task of reading the proofs of Luella  Granville Waterman's \"Moments in the Nursery.\"           *       *       *       *       *    He had not been working long, when Pugsy Maloney, the office boy,  entered.    \"Say!\" said Pugsy.    \"Say on, Comrade Maloney.\"    \"Dere's a loidy out dere wit a letter for Mr. Renshaw.\"    \"Have you acquainted her with the fact that Mr. Renshaw has passed to  other climes?\"    \"Huh?\"    \"Have you, in the course of your conversation with this lady, mentioned  that Mr. Renshaw has beaten it?\"    \"Sure, I did. And she says can she see you?\"    Smith removed his feet from the table.    \"Certainly,\" he said. \"Who am I that I should deny people these little  treats? Ask her to come in, Comrade Maloney.\"          CHAPTER XIII    BETTY MAKES A FRIEND      Betty had appealed to Master Maloney's esthetic sense of beauty  directly she appeared before him. It was with regret, therefore, rather  than with the usual calm triumph of the office boy, that he informed  her that the editor was not in. Also, seeing that she was evidently  perturbed by the information, he had gone out of his way to suggest  that she lay her business, whatever it might be, before Mr. Renshaw's  temporary successor.    Smith received her with Old-World courtesy.    \"Will you sit down?\" he said. \"Not to wait for Comrade Renshaw, of  course. He will not be back for another three months. Perhaps I can  help you. I am acting editor. The work is not light,\" he added  gratuitously. \"Sometimes the cry goes round New York, 'Can Smith get  through it all? Will his strength support his unquenchable spirit?' But  I stagger on. I do not repine. What was it that you wished to see  Comrade Renshaw about?\"    He swung his monocle lightly by its cord. For the first time since she  had entered the office Betty was rather glad that Mr. Renshaw was away.  Conscious of her defects as a stenographer she had been looking forward  somewhat apprehensively to the interview with her prospective employer.  But this long, solemn youth put her at her ease. His manner suggested  in some indefinable way that the whole thing was a sort of round game.    \"I came about the typewriting,\" she said.    Smith looked at her with interest.    \"Are you the nominee?\"    \"I beg your pardon?\"    \"Do you come from Mrs. Oakley?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Then all is well. The decks have been cleared against your coming.  Consider yourself engaged as our official typist. By the way,  _can_ you type?\"    Betty laughed. This was certainly not the awkward interview she had  been picturing in her mind.    \"Yes,\" she said, \"but I'm afraid I'm not very good at it.\"    \"Never mind,\" said Smith. \"I'm not very good at editing.
