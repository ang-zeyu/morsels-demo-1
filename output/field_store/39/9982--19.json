Anarchism, on the other hand, aims at  granting to everyone, without any conditions whatever,  just as much of all ordinary commodities as  he or she may care to consume, while the rarer com-  modities, of which the supply cannot easily be  indefinitely increased, would be rationed and divided  equally among the population. Thus Anarchism  would not impose any OBLIGATIONS of work, though  Anarchists believe that the necessary work could be  made sufficiently agreeable for the vast majority of  the population to undertake it voluntarily. Socialists,  on the other hand, would exact work. Some of  them would make the incomes of all workers equal,  while others would retain higher pay for the work  which is considered more valuable. All these different  systems are compatible with the common ownership  of land and capital, though they differ greatly  as regards the kind of society which they would  produce.    Socialism with inequality of income would not  differ greatly as regards the economic stimulus to  work from the society in which we live. Such differences  as it would entail would undoubtedly be to the  good from our present point of view. Under the  existing system many people enjoy idleness and  affluence through the mere accident of inheriting land  or capital. Many others, through their activities in  industry or finance, enjoy an income which is certainly  very far in excess of anything to which their  social utility entitles them. On the other hand, it  often happens that inventors and discoverers, whose  work has the very greatest social utility, are robbed  of their reward either by capitalists or by the failure  of the public to appreciate their work until too  late. The better paid work is only open to those who  have been able to afford an expensive training, and  these men are selected in the main not by merit but  by luck. The wage earner is not paid for his willingness  to work, but only for his utility to the employer.  Consequently, he may be plunged into destitution by  causes over which he has no control. Such destitution  is a constant fear, and when it occurs it produces  undeserved suffering, and often deterioration  in the social value of the sufferer. These are a few  among the evils of our existing system from the  standpoint of production. All these evils we might  expect to see remedied under any system of Socialism.    There are two questions which need to be considered  when we are discussing how far work requires  the economic motive. The first question is: Must  society give higher pay for the more skilled or socially  more valuable work, if such work is to be done in  sufficient quantities? The second question is: Could  work be made so attractive that enough of it would  be done even if idlers received just as much of the  produce of work? The first of these questions concerns  the division between two schools of Socialists:  the more moderate Socialists sometimes concede that  even under Socialism it would be well to retain  unequal pay for different kinds of work, while the  more thoroughgoing Socialists advocate equal  incomes for all workers. The second question, on the  other hand, forms a division between Socialists and  Anarchists; the latter would not deprive a man of  commodities if he did not work, while the former in  general would.    Our second question is so much more fundamental  than our first that it must be discussed at once, and  in the course of this discussion what needs to be said  on our first question will find its place naturally.    Wages or Free Sharing?--``Abolition of the  wages system'' is one of the watchwords common  to Anarchists and advanced Socialists. But in its  most natural sense it is a watchword to which only  the Anarchists have a right. In the Anarchist conception  of society all the commoner commodities will  be available to everyone without stint, in the kind  of way in which water is available at present.[41] Advo-  cates of this system point out that it applies already  to many things which formerly had to be paid for,  e.g., roads and bridges. They point out that it  might very easily be extended to trams and local  trains. They proceed to argue--as Kropotkin does  by means of his proofs that the soil might be made  indefinitely more productive--that all the commoner  kinds of food could be given away to all who demanded  them, since it would be easy to produce them in quantities  adequate to any possible demand. If this system  were extended to all the necessaries of life,  everyone's bare livelihood would be secured, quite  regardless of the way in which he might choose to  spend his time. As for commodities which cannot  be produced in indefinite quantities, such as luxuries  and delicacies, they also, according to the Anarchists,  are to be distributed without payment, but on a system  of rations, the amount available being divided  equally among the population. No doubt, though  this is not said, something like a price will have  to be put upon these luxuries, so that a man may  be free to choose how he will take his share: one man  will prefer good wine, another the finest Havana  cigars, another pictures or beautiful furniture. Presumably,  every man will be allowed to take such luxuries  as are his due in whatever form he prefers, the  relative prices being fixed so as to equalize the  demand. In such a world as this, the economic stimulus  to production will have wholly disappeared, and  if work is to continue it must be from other motives.[42]      [41] ``Notwithstanding the egotistic turn given to the public  mind by the merchant-production of our century, the Communist  tendency is continually reasserting itself and trying to  make its way into public life. The penny bridge disappears before  the public bridge; and the turnpike road before the free  road. The same spirit pervades thousands of other institutions.  Museums, free libraries, and free public schools; parks and  pleasure grounds; paved and lighted streets, free for everybody's  use; water supplied to private dwellings, with a growing tendency  towards disregarding the exact amount of it used by the  individual, tramways and railways which have already begun to  introduce the season ticket or the uniform tax, and will surely  go much further on this line when they are no longer private  property: all these are tokens showing in what direction further  progress is to be expected.''--Kropotkin, ``Anarchist Communism.''    [42] An able discussion of this question, at of various others,  from the standpoint of reasoned and temperate opposition to  Anarchism, will be found in Alfred Naquet's ``L'Anarchie et le  Collectivisme,'' Paris, 1904.      Is such a system possible? First, is it technically  possible to provide the necessaries of life in such  large quantities as would be needed if every man and  woman could take as much of them from the public  stores as he or she might desire?    The idea of purchase and payment is so familiar  that the proposal to do away with it must be thought  at first fantastic. Yet I do not believe it is nearly  so fantastic as it seems. Even if we could all have  bread for nothing, we should not want more than  a quite limited amount. As things are, the cost of  bread to the rich is so small a proportion of their  income as to afford practically no check upon their  consumption; yet the amount of bread that they consume  could easily be supplied to the whole population  by improved methods of agriculture (I am not speaking  of war-time). The amount of food that people  desire has natural limits, and the waste that would  be incurred would probably not be very great. As  the Anarchists point out, people at present enjoy  an unlimited water supply but very few leave the  taps running when they are not using them. And  one may assume that public opinion would be opposed  to excessive waste. We may lay it down, I think,  that the principle of unlimited supply could be  adopted in regard to all commodities for which the  demand has limits that fall short of what can be  easily produced. And this would be the case, if production  were efficiently organized, with the necessaries  of life, including not only commodities, but also  such things as education. Even if all education were  free up to the highest, young people, unless they were  radically transformed by the Anarchist regime,  would not want more than a certain amount of it.  And the same applies to plain foods, plain clothes,  and the rest of the things that supply our elementary  needs.    I think we may conclude that there is no technical  impossibility in the Anarchist plan of free  sharing.    But would the necessary work be done if the individual  were assured of the general standard of comfort  even though he did no work?    Most people will answer this question unhesitatingly  in the negative. Those employers in particular  who are in the habit of denouncing their  employes as a set of lazy, drunken louts, will feel quite  certain that no work could be got out of them except  under threat of dismissal and consequent starvation.  But is this as certain as people are inclined to sup-  pose at first sight? If work were to remain what  most work is now, no doubt it would be very hard to  induce people to undertake it except from fear of  destitution. But there is no reason why work should  remain the dreary drudgery in horrible conditions  that most of it is now.[43] If men had to be tempted to  work instead of driven to it, the obvious interest of  the community would be to make work pleasant. So  long as work is not made on the whole pleasant, it  cannot be said that anything like a good state "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6927"],[0,"The White Feather (#16)"],[1,"looked  forward to the return match with a certain amount of apathy, due partly  to the fact that the school was in a slack, unpatriotic state, and  partly to the hammering the team had received in the previous term,  when the Ripton centre three-quarters had run through and scored with  monotonous regularity. \"We're bound to get sat on,\" was the general  verdict of the school.    Allardyce, while thoroughly agreeing with this opinion, did his best to  conceal the fact from the rest of the team. He had certainly done his  duty by them. Every day for the past fortnight the forwards and  outsides had turned out to run and pass, and on the Saturdays there had  been matches with Corpus, Oxford, and the Cambridge Old Wrykinians. In  both games the school had been beaten. In fact, it seemed as if they  could only perform really well when they had no opponents. To see the  three-quarters racing down the field (at practice) and scoring  innumerable (imaginary) tries, one was apt to be misled into  considering them a fine quartette. But when there was a match, all the  beautiful dash and precision of the passing faded away, and the last  thing they did was to run straight. Barry was the only one of the four  who played the game properly.    But, as regarded condition, there was nothing wrong with the team. Even  Trevor could not have made them train harder; and Allardyce in his more  sanguine moments had a shadowy hope that the Ripton score might, with  care, be kept in the teens.    Barry had bought a _Sportsman_ at the station, and he unfolded it  as the train began to move. Searching the left-hand column of the middle  page, as we all do when we buy the _Sportsman_ on Saturday--to  see how our names look in print, and what sort of a team the enemy has  got--he made a remarkable discovery. At the same moment Drummond, on  the other side of the carriage, did the same.    \"I say,\" he said, \"they must have had a big clear-out at Ripton. Have  you seen the team they've got out today?\"    \"I was just looking at it,\" said Barry.    \"What's up with it?\" inquired Allardyce. \"Let's have a look.\"    \"They've only got about half their proper team. They've got a different  back--Grey isn't playing.\"    \"Both their centres are, though,\" said Drummond.    \"More fun for us, Drum., old chap,\" said Attell. \"I'm going home again.  Stop the train.\"    Drummond said nothing. He hated Attell most when he tried to be  facetious.    \"Dunn isn't playing, nor is Waite,\" said Barry, \"so they haven't got  either of their proper halves. I say, we might have a chance of doing  something today.\"    \"Of course we shall,\" said Allardyce. \"You've only got to buck up and  we've got them on toast.\"    The atmosphere in the carriage became charged with optimism. It seemed  a simple thing to defeat a side which was practically a Ripton \"A\"  team. The centre three-quarters were there still, it was true, but  Allardyce and Drummond ought to be able to prevent the halves ever  getting the ball out to them. The team looked on those two unknown  halves as timid novices, who would lose their heads at the kick-off. As  a matter of fact, the system of football teaching at Ripton was so  perfect, and the keenness so great, that the second fifteen was nearly  as good as the first every year. But the Wrykyn team did not know this,  with the exception of Allardyce, who kept his knowledge to himself; and  they arrived at Ripton jaunty and confident.    Keith, the Ripton captain, who was one of the centre three-quarters who  had made so many holes in the Wrykyn defence in the previous term, met  the team at the station, and walked up to the school with them,  carrying Allardyce's bag.    \"You seem to have lost a good many men at Christmas,\" said Allardyce.  \"We were reading the _Sportsman_ in the train. Apparently, you've  only got ten of your last term's lot. Have they all left?\"    The Ripton captain grinned ruefully.    \"Not much,\" he replied. \"They're all here. All except Dunn. You  remember Dunn? Little thick-set chap who played half. He always had his  hair quite tidy and parted exactly in the middle all through the game.\"    \"Oh, yes, I remember Dunn. What's he doing now?\"    \"Gone to Coopers Hill. Rot, his not going to the Varsity. He'd have  walked into his blue.\"    Allardyce agreed. He had marked Dunn in the match of the previous term,  and that immaculate sportsman had made things not a little warm for  him.    \"Where are all the others, then?\" he asked. \"Where's that other half of  yours? And the rest of the forwards?\"    \"Mumps,\" said Keith.    \"What!\"    \"It's a fact. Rot, isn't it? We've had a regular bout of it. Twenty  fellows got it altogether. Naturally, four of those were in the team.  That's the way things happen. I only wonder the whole scrum didn't have  it.\"    \"What beastly luck,\" said Allardyce. \"We had measles like that a couple  of years ago in the summer term, and had to play the Incogs and Zingari  with a sort of second eleven. We got mopped.\"    \"That's what we shall get this afternoon, I'm afraid,\" said Keith.    \"Oh, no,\" said Allardyce. \"Of course you won't.\"    And, as events turned out, that was one of the truest remarks he had  ever made in his life.           *       *       *       *       *    One of the drawbacks to playing Ripton on its own ground was the crowd.  Another was the fact that one generally got beaten. But your sportsman  can put up with defeat. What he does not like is a crowd that regards  him as a subtle blend of incompetent idiot and malicious scoundrel, and  says so very loud and clear. It was not, of course, the school that did  this. They spent their time blushing for the shouters. It was the  patriotic inhabitants of Ripton town who made the school wish that they  could be saved from their friends. The football ground at Ripton was at  the edge of the school fields, separated from the road by narrow iron  railings; and along these railings the choicest spirits of the town  would line up, and smoke and yell, and spit and yell again. As  Wordsworth wrote, \"There are two voices\". They were on something like  the following lines.    Inside the railings: \"Sch-oo-oo-oo-oo-l! Buck up Sch-oo-oo-oo-oo-l!!  Get it OUT, Schoo-oo-oo-oo-l!!!\"    Outside the railings: \"Gow it, Ripton! That's the way, Ripton! Twist  his good-old-English-adjectived neck, Ripton! Sit on his forcibly  described head, Ripton! Gow it, Ripton! Haw, Haw, Haw! They ain't no  use, RIPton! Kick 'im in the eye, RipTON! Haw, Haw, Haw!\"    The bursts of merriment signalised the violent downfall of some  dangerous opponent.    The school loathed these humble supporters, and occasionally fastidious  juniors would go the length of throwing chunks of mud at them through  the railings. But nothing discouraged them or abated their fervid  desire to see the school win. Every year they seemed to increase in  zeal, and they were always in great form at the Wrykyn match.    It would be charitable to ascribe to this reason the gruesome  happenings of that afternoon. They needed some explaining away.           *       *       *       *       *    Allardyce won the toss, and chose to start downhill, with the wind in  his favour. It is always best to get these advantages at the beginning  of the game. If one starts against the wind, it usually changes ends at  half-time. Amidst a roar from both touch-lines and a volley of howls  from the road, a Ripton forward kicked off. The ball flew in the  direction of Stanning, on the right wing. A storm of laughter arose  from the road as he dropped it. The first scrum was formed on the  Wrykyn twenty-five line.    The Ripton forwards got the ball, and heeled with their usual neatness.  The Ripton half who was taking the scrum gathered it cleanly, and  passed to his colleague. He was a sturdy youth with a dark, rather  forbidding face, in which the acute observer might have read signs of  the savage. He was of the breed which is vaguely described at public  schools as \"nigger\", a term covering every variety of shade from ebony  to light lemon. As a matter of fact he was a half-caste, sent home to  England to be educated. Drummond recognised him as he dived forward to  tackle him. The last place where they had met had been the roped ring  at Aldershot. It was his opponent in the final of the Feathers.    He reached him as he swerved, and they fell together. The ball bounded  forward.    \"Hullo, Peteiro,\" he said. \"Thought you'd left.\"    The other grinned recognition.    \"Hullo, Drummond.\"    \"Going up to Aldershot this year?\"    \"Yes. Light-Weight.\"    \"So am I.\"    The scrum had formed by now, and further conversation was impossible.  Drummond looked a little thoughtful as he put the ball in. He had been  told that Peteiro was leaving Ripton at Christmas. It was a nuisance  his being still at school. Drummond was not afraid of him--he would  have fought a champion of the world if the school had expected him  to--but he could not help remembering that it was only by the very  narrowest margin, and after a terrific three rounds, that he had beaten  him in the Feathers the year before. It would be too awful for words if  the decision were to be reversed in the coming competition.    But he was not allowed much leisure for pondering on the future. The  present was too full of incident and excitement. The withdrawal of the  four invalids and the departure of Dunn had not reduced the Ripton team  to that wreck of its former self which the Wrykyn fifteen had looked  for. On the contrary, their play seemed, if anything, a shade better  than it had been in the former match. There was all the old  aggressiveness, and Peteiro and his partner, so far from being timid  novices and losing their heads, eclipsed the exhibition given at Wrykyn  by Waite and Dunn. Play had only been in progress six minutes when  Keith, taking a pass on the twenty-five line, slipped past Attell, ran  round the back, and scored between the posts. Three"]]]
