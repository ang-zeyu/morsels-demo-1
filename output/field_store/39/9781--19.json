Wherever there are green perching-places, and small  caterpillars, flies and aphides to feed upon, there you will see and  hear the willow wren. He is a sweet and constant singer from the date  of his arrival until about the middle of June, when he becomes silent  for a season, resuming his song in July, and continuing it throughout  August and even into September. This late summer singing is, however,  fitful and weak and less joyous in character than in the spring. But  in spite of his abundance and universality, and the charm of his  little melody, he is not familiarly known to the people generally, as  they know the robin redbreast, pied wagtail, dunnock, redstart,  wheatear, and stonechat. The name we call him by is a very old one; it  was first used in English by Ray, in his translation of Willughby's  Ornithology, about three centuries ago; but it still remains a  book-name unknown to the rustic. Nor has this common little bird any  widely known vernacular name. If by chance you find a country-man who  knows the bird, and has a name for it, this will be one which is  applied indiscriminately to two, three, or four species. The willow  wren, in fact, is one of those little birds that are \"seen rather than  distinguished,\" on account of its small size, modest colouring, and  its close resemblance to other species of warblers; also on account of  the quiet, gentle character of its song, which is little noticed in  the spring and summer concert of loud, familiar voices.    One day in London during the late summer I was amused and at the same  time a little disgusted at this general indifference to the delicate  beauty in a bird-sound which distinguishes the willow wren even among  such delicate singers as the warblers: it struck me as a kind of  aesthetic hardness of hearing. I heard the song in the flower walk, in  Kensington Gardens, on a Sunday morning, and sat down to listen to it;  and for half an hour the bird continued to repeat his song two or  three times a minute on the trees and bushes within half a dozen yards  of my seat. Just after I had sat down, a throstle, perched on the  topmost bough of a thorn that projected over the walk, began his song,  and continued it a long time, heedless of the people passing below.  Now, I noticed that in almost every case the person approaching lifted  his eyes to the bird above, apparently admiring the music, sometimes  even pausing for a moment in his walk; and that when two or three came  together they not only looked up, but made some remark about the  beauty of the song. But from first to last not one of all the  passers-by cast a look towards the tree where the willow wren was  singing; nor was there anything to show that the sound had any  attraction for them, although they must have heard it. The loudness of  the thrush prevented them from giving it any attention, and made it  practically inaudible. It was like a pimpernel blossoming by the side  of a poppy, or dahlia, or peony, where, even if seen, it would not be  noticed as a beautiful flower.    In the chapter on the wood wren, I endeavoured to trace to its source  the pleasurable feelings which the song of that bird produces in me and  in many others--a charm exceeding that of many more celebrated  vocalists. In that chapter the song of the willow wren was mentioned  incidentally. Now, these two--wood wren and willow wren--albeit nearly  related, are, in the character of their notes, as widely different as it  is possible for two songsters to be; and when we listen attentively to  both, we recognise that the feeling produced in us differs in each  case--that it has a different cause. In the case of the willow wren it  might be said off-hand that our pleasure is simply due to the fact that  it is a melodious sound, associated in our minds with summer scenes. As  much could be said of any other migrant's song--nightingale, tree-pipit,  blackcap, garden warbler, swallow, and a dozen more. But it does not  explain the individual and very special charm of this particular  bird--what I have ventured to call the secret of the willow wren. After  all, it is not a deeply hidden secret, and has indeed been half guessed  or hinted by various writers on bird melody; and as it also happens to  be the secret of other singers besides the willow wren, we may, I think,  find in it an explanation of the fact that the best singers do not  invariably please us so well as some that are considered inferior.    The song of the willow wren has been called singular and unique among  our birds; and Mr Warde Fowler, who has best described it, says that  it forms an almost perfect cadence, and adds, \"by which I mean that it  descends gradually, not, of course, on the notes of our musical scale,  by which no birds in their natural state would deign to be fettered,  but through fractions of one or perhaps two of our tones, and without  returning upward at the end.\" Now, this arrangement of its notes,  although very rare and beautiful, does not give the little song its  highest aesthetic value. The secret of the charm, I imagine, is  traceable to the fact that there is distinctly something human-like in  the quality of the voice, its timbre. Many years ago an observer of  wild birds and listener to their songs came to this country, and  walking one day in a London suburb he heard a small bird singing among  the trees. The trees were in an enclosure and he could not see the  bird, but there would, he thought, be no difficulty in ascertaining  the species, since it would only be necessary to describe its peculiar  little song to his friends and they would tell him. Accordingly, on  his return to the house he proceeded to describe the song and ask the  name of the singer. No one could tell him, and much to his surprise,  his account of the melody was received with smiles of amusement and  incredulity. He described it as a song that was like a wonderfully  bright and delicate human voice talking or laughingly saying something  rather than singing. It was not until some time afterwards that the  bird-lover in a strange land discovered that his little talker and  laugher among the leaves was the willow wren. In vain he had turned to  the ornithological works; the song he had heard, or at all events the  song as he had heard it, was not described therein; and yet to this  day he cannot hear it differently--cannot dissociate the sound from  the idea of a fairy-like child with an exquisitely pure, bright,  spiritual voice laughingly speaking in some green place.    And yet Gilbert White over a century ago had noted the human quality  in the willow wren's voice when he described it as an \"easy, joyous,  laughing note.\" It is still better to be able to quote Mr Warde  Fowler, when writing in A Year with the Birds, on the futile attempts  which are often made to represent birds' songs by means of our  notation, since birds are guided in their songs by no regular  succession of intervals. Speaking of the willow wren in this  connection, he adds: \"Strange as it may seem, the songs of birds may  perhaps be more justly compared with the human voice when speaking,  than with a musical instrument, or with the human voice when singing.\"  The truth of this observation must strike any person who will pay  close attention to the singing of birds; but there are two criticisms  to be made on it. One is that the resemblance of a bird's song to a  human voice when speaking is confined to some or to a few species; the  second is that it is a mistake to think, as Mr Fowler appears to do,  that the resemblance is wholly or mainly due to the fact that the  bird's voice is free when singing--that, like the human voice in  talking, it is not tied to tones and semitones. For instance, we note  this peculiarity in the willow wren, but not in, say, the wren and  chaffinch, although the songs of these two are just as free, just as  independent of regular intervals as our voices when speaking and  laughing. The resemblance in a bird's song to human speech is entirely  due to the human-like quality in the voice; for we find that other  songsters--notably the swallow--have a charm similar to that of the  willow wren, although the notes of the former bird are differently  arranged, and do not form anything like a cadence. Again, take the  case of the blackbird. We are accustomed to describe the blackbird's  voice as flute-like, and the flute is one of the instruments which  most nearly resemble the human voice. Now, on account of the leisurely  manner in which the blackbird gives out his notes, the resemblance to  human speech is not so pronounced as in the case of the willow wren or  swallow; but when two or three or half a dozen blackbirds are heard  singing close together, as we sometimes hear them in woods and  orchards where they are abundant, the effect is singularly beautiful,  and gives the idea of a conversation being carried on by a set of  human beings of arboreal habits (not monkeys) with glorified voices.  Listening to these blackbird concerts, I have sometimes wondered  whether or not they produced the same effect on others' ears as on  mine, as of people talking to one another in high-pitched and  beautiful tones. Oddly enough, it was only while writing this chapter  that I by chance found an affirmative answer to my question. Glancing  through Leslie's Riverside Letters, which I had not previously seen, I  came upon the following remarks, quoted from Sir George Grove, in a  letter to the author, on the blackbird's singing: \"He selects a spot  where he is within hearing of a comrade, and then he begins quite at  leisure (not all in a hurry like the thrush) a regular conversation.  'And how are you? Isn't this a fine day? Let us have a nice talk,'  etc., etc. He is answered in the same strain, and then"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37814"],[0,"The Story of Magellan and The Discovery of the Philippines (#16)"],[1,"things to  induce them to become Christians.    \"He told them how God had made Heaven and earth and all other things in  the world, and that he had commanded that every one should render honor  and obedience to his father and mother, and that whoever did otherwise  was condemned to eternal fire.\"    His teaching bore immediate fruit.    \"The people heard these things willingly, and besought the Captain to  leave them two men to teach and show them the Christian faith, and they  would entertain them well with great honor. To this the Captain answered  that for the moment he could not leave any of his people, but that if  they wished to be Christians that his priest would baptize them, and  that another time he would bring priests and teachers to teach them the  faith.\"    His manner of teaching reveals his heart:    \"The people told him that they wished to consult their King in regard to  becoming Christians.\" The friends of the Captain \"wept for the joy which  they felt at the good-will of these people, and the Captain told them  not to become Christians 'from fear of us, or to please us, but that if  they wished to become Christian they must do it willingly, and for the  love of God, for even though they should not become Christian, no  displeasure would be done them, but those who became Christian would be  more loved and better treated than the others.' Then they all cried out  with one voice that they did not wish to become Christians from fear,  nor from complaisance, but of their free will.\"    Here the true character of the man again appears--few Christian  explorers ever made so noble a record. His sincerity won the hearts of  the natives:    \"At last they said they did not know what more to answer to so many good  and beautiful words which he spoke to them, but that they placed  themselves in his hands, and that he should do with them as with his  own servants.\"    The next scene is ideal:    \"Then the Captain, with tears in his eyes, embraced them, and, taking  the hand of the Prince and that of the King, said to him that by the  faith he had in God, and to his master the Emperor, and by the habit of  St. James which he wore, he promised them to cause them to have  perpetual peace with the King of Spain, at which the Prince and the  others promised him the same.\"    It is a pleasure to follow such a narrative as Pigafetta here writes in  illustration of the character of a true Christian Knight. Compare this  narrative with the history of Pizarro, Cortes, and De Soto. Magellan was  a Las Casas, a Marquette, a La Salle.    The next incident told by Pigafetta has as fine a touch as a portrayal  of character. It relates to a message which Magellan sent to the King,  with a present.    \"When we came to the town we found the King of Zubu at his palace,  sitting on the ground on a mat made of palm, with many people about him.    \"He had a very heavy chain around his neck, and two gold rings hung in  his ears with precious stones.    \"He was eating tortoise eggs in two china dishes, and he had four  vessels full of palm wine, which he drank with a cane pipe. We made our  obeisance, and presented to him what the Captain had sent him, and told  him, through the interpreter that the present _was not as a return for  his present which he had sent to the Captain, but for the affection  which he bore him_. This done, his people told him all the good words  and explanations of peace and religion which he had spoken to them.\"    We now behold Magellan in a new attitude, as a missionary teacher, a  John the Baptist in the wilderness. Pigafetta thus describes the scene:    \"On Sunday morning, the fourteenth day of April, we went on shore, forty  men, of whom two were armed, who marched before us, following the  standard of our King Emperor. When we landed the ships discharged all  their artillery, and from fear of it the people ran away in all  directions.    \"Magellan and the King embraced one another, and then joyously we went  near the scaffolding, where the Captain General and the King sat on two  chairs, one covered with red, the other with violet velvet. The  principal men sat on cushions, and others on mats, after the fashion of  the country.    \"Then the Captain began to speak to the King through the interpreter to  incite him to the faith of Jesus Christ, and told him that if he wished  to be a good Christian, as he had said the day before, that he must burn  all the idols of his country, and, instead of them, place a cross, and  that every one should worship it every day on their knees, and their  hands joined to Heaven; and he showed him how he ought every day to make  the sign of the Cross.    \"To that the King and all his people answered that they would obey the  commands of the Captain and do all that he told them. The Captain took  the King by the hand, and they walked about on the scaffolding, and when  he was baptized he said that he would name him Don Charles, as the  Emperor his sovereign was named; and he named the Prince Don Fernand,  after the brother of the Emperor, and the King of Mazzava, Jehan; to the  Moor he gave the name of Christopher, and to the others each a name of  his fancy. Thus, before mass, there were fifty men baptized.\"    The baptism of the Queen followed.    \"Our Chaplain and some of us went on shore to baptize the Queen. She  came with forty ladies, and we conducted them onto the scaffolding; then  made her sit down on a cushion, and her women around her, until the  priest was ready. During that time they showed her an image of our Lady,  of wood, holding her little child, which was very well made, and a  cross. When she saw it, she had a greater desire to be a Christian, and,  asking for baptism, she was baptized and named Jehanne, like the mother  of the Emperor. The wife of the Prince, daughter of this Queen, had the  name of Catherine, the Queen of Mazzava Isabella, and to the others each  their name.    \"That day we baptised eight hundred persons of men, women, and  children. The Queen was young and handsome, covered with a black and  white sheet; she had the mouth and nails very red, and wore on her head  a large hat made of leaves of palm, with a crown over it made of the  same leaves, like that of the Pope. After that she begged us to give her  the little wooden boy to put in the place of the idols. This we did, and  she went away. In the evening the King and Queen, with several of their  people, came to the sea beach, where the Captain had some of the large  artillery fired, in which they took great pleasure. The Captain and the  King called one another brother.\"    The \"little boy\" spoken of was an image of the infant Christ. The figure  was preserved until the year 1598, when the Spaniards sent missionaries  to the place who gave it a place in a shrine and named a city for it.    The naming of the Queen at her baptism for poor Juana, or \"Crazy Jane,\"  the incapable mother of Charles V, who was watching beside her dead  husband in Granada, and who had signed the commission of Magellan by  proxy, completes a tale of missionary work in a somewhat ideal way. If  these people did not maintain their faith, the work reveals the  intention of Magellan, and shows the nobility of character of the  Christian Knight.          CHAPTER XIX.    HALCYON DAYS.      These were indeed days of joy. The glory of them grew. All the  inhabitants of the island came to be baptized. Magellan went on shore  daily to hear mass.    It was Pigafetta who gave to the Queen the image of the infant Christ,  which became historical.    On one of the occasions that Magellan went on shore to hear mass he met  the Queen, who appeared in a veil of silk and gold. He sprinkled over  her some rose water and musk, and noticed that she cherished the image  of the infant Christ.    \"You do well,\" said he. \"Put it in the place where your idols were; it  will keep in your mind the Son of God.\"    \"I will cherish it forever,\" said the veiled Queen.    She seems to have kept her word.    The joy of these scenes reached their height, when the King of Seba  swore fealty to the King of Spain.    The scene of the conclusion of this ceremony was knightly indeed, and  again reveals the heart of Magellan.    He, seeing a good spirit, of the King of Seba, resolved to swear fealty  of eternal friendship to him. Only a Christian Knight would have dreamed  of such a thing.    \"I swear,\" he said, \"by the image of our Lady, the Virgin, by the love  of my Emperor, and by the insignia, on my heart, that I will ever be  faithful to you, O King of Seba!\"    Here the true character of the statesman as well as teacher appeared.  History records few acts more noble. Magellan sought the good of  mankind.    There was one officer on the ships whose soul, like that of Pigafetta's,  must have been in all these benevolent efforts.    The expedition was tarrying long, seeking the glory of the Cross rather  than the gold and spices. There were impatient hearts in Seville.    Mesquita in his still prison, with the world against him, dreamed of  Magellan, Del Cano, and the Italian historian. The half world separated  them now.    In his dreams Mesquita saw the fleet coming back again, and he heard the  shouting of the people and the ringing of the bells. The star of hope in  his heart did not fail.    \"Padre,\" he said, \"the day of my vindication will come.\"    But the seasons came and went, and the light changed color in the window  of his cell, and the birds sang their notes in the trees in spring and  left their empty nests to silence in the retreating summer. The great  Cathedral grew, and the achievement of Charles had begun to excite the  world.    We now come to the tragedy of this wonderful expedition; to the tempest  that rose out of the calm. The transition from these ideal scenes to  what is to follow is sudden indeed.          CHAPTER XX.    THE DEATH OF MAGELLAN.      Magellan, as we have shown, had sought not wealth, nor"]]]
