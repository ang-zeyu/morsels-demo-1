She doubled up her little fist and  raised it to strike him. Guiseppe grabbed her hand and shook her again  in his fury. Marta sprang to Pappina's rescue with a savage look on  her face no one had ever seen there before. Guiseppe loosened his hold  on Pappina and pushed her away from him with such force she would have  fallen to the ground had not Marta caught her.    \"Coward! Fiend! Coward!\" the child hissed through her set teeth.    \"Coward, eh! Call me names, will you? We'll see after to-night. Marta,  wash her impudent face; comb her hair; for heaven's sake do something!  They'll think she is no more than a beggar, and they are sick of  beggars. We found that out at Amalfi, where the whole town begs.\"    Marta washed Pappina, combed her hair, and tried to smooth out her  dress and make her acceptable to Guiseppe; but he seemed determined not  to be pleased.    \"Can't you keep your eyelids down a little?\" he said to the child. \"I  tell you, you are all eyes to-day--great big, black, staring eyes!  Pinch up her cheeks, Marta; see if you can't get some color in them.\"    Pappina looked pleadingly first at Marta then at Guiseppe, then burst  into tears.    \"Stop your crying, you wild-eyed beggar! Lost your spirit, too? What  are you good for, I'd like to know, with beauty and spirit both gone!\"    Pappina dried her tears and choked back her sobs, while Marta stood as  if paralyzed. She longed to soothe the child, yet dared not, her old  fear of Guiseppe upon her again.    \"There'll be great dancing at the Vittoria to-night. Get up and show  me what you can do. You needn't sing; I want to see your dancing.\"    Pappina did not move.    \"Are you deaf, too? Didn't you hear me? I say dance!\"    \"Guiseppe,\" came faintly from the frightened child, \"I will try to  please you to-night, but I cannot dance now. Be good to me; then I  shall be happy and dance all night if you wish me to.\"    \"Oh, it's your own way you want again, is it? For once I want mine and  I'll have it, too. Dance now--at once!\"    \"I'll try.\"    She tried. Her body was quivering from excitement and fear. Her little  blistered foot pained her. She couldn't dance. Guiseppe watched her  angrily, Marta tearfully, as she lifted her tambourine, struck it and  danced one step--two--then dropped on her knees.    \"_Pieta, pieta_ [pity, pity], signor,\" she cried. \"I cannot dance now.  To-night--with the music, the people and the dancers--I will dance well  then; not now, Guiseppe. I pray you, dear Marta, tell him I cannot.\"    Guiseppe took up a big stick that was lying near him. He struck Pappina  once--twice. She was on her feet like a flash. She started to run,  Guiseppe seized her by her dress; it slipped through his fingers and  before he had time to collect himself she was gone, speeding like a  deer down the street. She was running away from Guiseppe, she neither  knew nor cared where.    Down the street, turning one corner after another, on, on to the  _marina_, where she was soon lost in the throng of boys and tourists.  She jumped into a row-boat just as the oarsman was starting with his  load of passengers for the steamer leaving Sorrento for Naples.    There were a few moments of suspense; then she was hurried aboard the  steamer with the others. She was safe!    Guiseppe, as he sprang after Pappina, stumbled on his own cruel stick.  When he got to his feet the child was turning a corner. He saw the  little red dress and its owner disappear from his view forever. He  glared in a frenzy at Marta.    \"Curse her! Curse her!\" he shrieked. \"To-day of all days to get  away from me! Marta, have you turned to stone? Why don't you move?  Why didn't you run after her, instead of standing there staring  like a mummy? We must have her before dark. Go--search everywhere.  Move!--Don't stop till you find her.\"                                         CHAPTER X                            NAPLES, AND A NEW LIFE      Pappina stood on the deck, holding fast to the railing for support. Her  face was livid, her body shook. She looked anxiously toward the shore  to see if she had been followed. There were no signs of Guiseppe!    She kept her eyes riveted on the boys splashing in the water until they  appeared mere specks in the distance. Then, worn out with excitement,  she sank down and burst into tears. Stifling her sobs, presently the  child fell asleep from sheer exhaustion.    The captain, passing that way, saw Pappina curled up on the deck. He  could not see her winsome, beautiful face, for it was buried in her  arms as she lay there sleeping. He saw just a child with a tattered,  dirty dress and ragged little shoes. He gave her a kick.    \"Get up,\" he said. \"What are you doing here? This is no place for  beggars; move on.\"    Pappina jumped up quickly. He had called her a beggar. She looked at  him with flashing eyes.    \"Beggar!\" cried she. \"No, signor, I'm not a beggar. You want money?  I have it, I can pay.\" She began to unfasten one of her little worn  shoes. The captain stood watching her, perplexed.    \"What does it mean?\" he asked himself. \"She has such beauty and pride,  and her clothes are so poor! She is alone and has money in her shoe. I  am puzzled this time, for sure.\"    He tugged fiercely at his long black mustache, waiting to see what she  would offer him from her store. She brought up coins and handed him a  franc.    \"Is that enough, signor?\" she asked. \"I have more.\"    Looking into the unfathomable depths of those great velvet eyes, the  captain would have refused the wealth of Croesus had she offered it.  Her beauty and her independence conquered him.    \"Keep your money, child. As long as I run the boat you ride free.\"    \"_Grazie, buono signor_ [Thanks, good sir]. May I go inside? The boat  rocks so. I feel--may I lie down just a little while, signor? I have  my tambourine and I can sing and dance for you by-and-by when my  head--when I am not so dizzy.\"    \"Go inside, child, and lie down. I will look after you soon.\"    Pappina, catching hold of chairs and benches to steady herself,  staggered inside and lay down, dizzy and faint. She was too sick even  to think or to wonder where the boat was taking her.    The steamer was filled with people returning from Capri and the  wonderful Blue Grotto. Among the tourists was Mrs. Elinor Thurston, a  childless American widow traveling abroad with friends, seeking some  new interest from day to day--anything to make her forget the loss of  her husband and her only child. She noticed Pappina's pale, beautiful  face and her glorious eyes. There was something about the child that  reminded Mrs. Thurston of her boy. She watched Pappina intently as the  little girl threw herself on the floor. The forlorn figure interested  her, lying with her tambourine tightly clasped in her hands.    \"Poor child!\" she murmured softly.    \"Such a picture!\" exclaimed one of the tourists. \"I must take a  snap-shot of this typical little Italian beauty.\"    Pappina, hearing voices near her, opened her eyes. Her glance fell upon  the sweet face of Mrs. Thurston, who sat looking kindly at her. The  child smiled faintly, closed her eyes again, and was asleep.    That smile won Mrs. Thurston. She watched to see who was with the  little girl, and seeing no one she inquired of the captain:    \"Tell me, who is with that beautiful child?\" Her face was diffused with  tender, earnest solicitude as she gazed at the little figure lying at  their feet.    \"No one, apparently; she seems to be alone.\"    The captain then related to Mrs. Thurston how the little girl had taken  money from her shoe and offered it to him for her fare.    Pappina began to talk in her sleep.    \"He struck me,\" she murmured. \"It hurt me so!\" They tried to make out  her words, so jumbled at first, then clearer and louder, till she  fairly screamed: \"Guiseppe, how dare you strike me? Marta, hold him. I  hate him! I wish he were dead--I do, for I hate him!\"    Mrs. Thurston stooped and took hold of the child's hot little hand.    \"See how flushed her face is!\" she whispered. \"Her pulse is too quick;  she is feverish, poor child,\" she said with pity as she gently picked  her up and placed her on a sofa.    \"She is my charge and I'll stay with her,\" she told the friends who  urged her to go on deck and enjoy the beautiful scenery.    \"Scenery!\" she exclaimed as she took Pappina's hand in hers. \"There  is nothing so beautiful as this child. I am almost hoping no one will  claim her when we land at Naples, for I need her. Her eyes are like my  Harold's, so--\" She could not finish the sentence for the tears that  welled to her eyes and the sorrow that choked her.    At Naples no one came for Pappina, alone and sick, still tossing her  head in pain and fever.    \"I cannot leave her,\" her new friend declared. \"She must be cared for.  Oh, how glad I am that I can do everything for her!\"    Pappina, still unconscious, was carried to a carriage and taken to the  International Hospital.    \"See that every attention is given her,\" Mrs. Thurston said. \"Leave  nothing undone. Here is my card, and I am responsible for her. I will  be back in the morning.\"    It was hard for Mrs. Thurston to leave Pappina, but friends were  waiting for her and there was an engagement to fulfill.    The nurse put Pappina to bed, dressed in a little white nightgown, the  first she had ever worn.    Early the following day Mrs. Thurston called.    \"How is she?\" she inquired eagerly. \"Still unconscious? Take me to her.  All night I have thought and dreamed of her. Her eyes have haunted me  even in my sleep. Take me to her.\"    She asked anxiously if any one had sought the child.    \"No one? Oh, joy! Perhaps I may have her for my own.\"    Enrichetta, the nurse, showed the welts on the child's body--two red  marks from Guiseppe's stick.    \"_Povera figlietta_ [Poor little girl],\" she said. \"It is now quite  certain she will have a run of fever.\"    The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45573"],[0,"Out with Garibaldi: A story of the liberation of Italy (#16)"],[1,"on again.    \"So far so good,\" Frank said. \"I should think that I am all right now.  We shall be in at seven, and it will not be daylight till half-past six;  and as I fancy that we must have been about midway between Vienne and  Vallence when that fellow fell out, it is not likely that his body will  be found for some time. They are sure to have chosen some point a good  way from any station to get out of their own carriage and come to mine.  Even when they find him, they are not likely to make out that he has  been shot for some time afterwards. I hit him in the body, somewhere  near the heart, I fancy; I did not feel sure of hitting him if I fired  at his head, for the carriage was shaking about a good deal. It will  probably be thought at first that he has either fallen or jumped out of  his carriage. I suppose, when he is found, he will be carried to the  nearest station, and put in somewhere till a doctor and some  functionaries come, and an inquiry is held; and as he probably has been  badly cut about the head and face, his death will be put down to that  cause at first. Indeed, the fact that he was shot may not be found out  till they prepare him for burial. I suppose they will take off his  clothes then, as they will want to keep them for his identification, if  any inquiries should ever be made about him. At any rate, I may hope to  have got fairly away from Marseilles before the matter is taken up by  the police, and even then the evidence of the guard that I was alone  will prevent any suspicion falling especially on me.\"    He had no inclination for sleep, and although he felt certain that he  would not again be disturbed, he maintained a vigilant watch upon both  windows until, a few minutes after the appointed time, the train arrived  at Marseilles. Having only the small portmanteau he carried with him, he  was not detained more than two or three minutes there, took a _fiacre_  and drove to the Hotel de Marseilles, which his Bradshaw told him was  close to the steamboat offices. After going upstairs and having a wash,  he went down again, carefully locking the door after him and putting the  key in his pocket. He then had some coffee and rolls, and while taking  these, obtained from the waiter a time-table of the departures of the  various steamers from the port, and found, to his great satisfaction,  that one of the Rubattino vessels would leave for Genoa at twelve  o'clock.    As soon as the steamboat offices were open he engaged a berth, walked  about Marseilles for an hour, returned at ten to the hotel, took a  hearty lunch, and then drove down to the port. On questioning the  steward he found that there were not many passengers going, and with a  tip of five francs secured a cabin to himself; having done this, he went  on deck again and watched the passengers arriving. They were principally  Italians; but among them he could not recognise the face of the agent  who had levelled a pistol at him. Both men had, indeed, worn black  handkerchiefs tied across their faces below their eyes and covering  their chins, and the broad-brimmed hats they wore kept their foreheads  and eyes in shadow; and although he watched his fellow-passengers with  the faint hope of discovering by some evil expression on his face his  last night's assailant, he had no real belief that he should, even under  the most favourable circumstances, recognise him again.    Two or three of the men wore beards, and seemed to belong to the sailor  class--probably men who had landed from a French ship, after perhaps a  distant voyage, and were now returning home. He saw no more of these, as  they at once went forward. There were only eight other passengers in the  saloon; seven of these were Italians, of whom three were evidently  friends. Two of the others had, Frank gathered from their talk, just  returned from Brazil; the sixth was an old man, and the seventh a  traveller for a firm of silk or velvet manufacturers in Genoa. The three  friends talked gaily on all sorts of subjects; but nothing that Frank  gathered, either from their conversation on deck or at dinner, gave any  clue as to their occupation. They had evidently met at Marseilles for  the first time after being separated for a considerable period--one had  been in England, one at Paris, and one at Bordeaux; their ages were from  twenty-three to twenty-six. Their names were, as he learned from their  talk, Maffio, Sarto, and Rubini. Before the steamer had left the port  half an hour, one of them, seeing that Frank was alone, said to him as  he passed, in broken English,--    \"It is warmer and pleasanter here, monsieur, than it is in London.\"    \"It is indeed,\" Frank replied, in Italian; \"it was miserable weather  there, when I left the day before yesterday.\"    \"_Per Bacco!_\" the young man said, with a laugh, \"I took you to be  English. Allow me to congratulate you on your admirable imitation  of----\"    \"I am English, signor--that is, I was born of English parents; but I  first saw light in Rome, and my grandfather was an Italian.\"    This broke the ice, and they chatted together pleasantly.    \"We are going to Genoa. And you?\"    \"I also am going to Genoa, and perhaps\"--for he had by this time quite  come to a conclusion on the subject--\"on the same errand as yourselves.\"    The others looked at him in some little surprise, and then glanced at  one another. That this young Englishman should be going upon such an  expedition as that upon which they were bound, seemed to be out of the  question.    \"You mean on pleasure, signor?\" one of them said, after a pause.    \"If excitement is pleasure, which no doubt it is--yes. I am going to  visit an old friend of my father's; he is living a little way out of the  town at the Villa Spinola.\"    The others gave a simultaneous exclamation of surprise.    \"That is enough, signor,\" the one called Rubini said, holding out his  hand; \"we are comrades. Though how a young English gentleman should come  to be of our party, I cannot say.\"    The others shook hands as warmly with Frank; and he then replied,--    \"No doubt you are surprised. My father fought side by side with the man  I am now going to see, in the siege of Rome, so also did my grandfather;  and both have since paid by their lives for their love of Italy. My name  is Percival.\"    \"The son of the Captain Percival who was murdered while searching in  Naples for Signor Forli?\" one of them exclaimed.    \"The same. So, gentlemen, you can perhaps understand why I am going to  the Villa Spinola, and why, young as I am, I am as eager to take part in  this business as you yourselves can be.\"    \"Yes, indeed; your father's name is honoured among us as one of our  general's friends and companions in South America, and as one of his  comrades at Rome; still more, perhaps, for his fearless exposure of the  horrors of the tyrants' dungeons. However, it were best that we should  say no more on the subject at present. It is certain that the general's  presence at Genoa is causing uneasiness both at Rome and Naples. Rumours  that he intends to carry out some daring enterprise have appeared in  newspapers, and no doubt Neapolitan spies are already watching his  movements, and it may be there are some on board this ship. Our great  fear is that Victor Emmanuel's government may interfere to stop it; but  we doubt whether he will venture to do so--public opinion will be too  strong for him.\"    \"No one can overhear us just at present,\" Frank said. \"Certainly the  Neapolitan spies are active. My mother's house is frequented by many  leading exiles; and we have reason to believe that it has been watched  by a spy for some time past. I know that I have been followed, under the  idea, perhaps, that I am carrying important papers or documents from the  general's friends there. An attempt was made last night to enter the  carriage, in which I was alone, by two men, one of whom was armed with a  pistol, and the other had a handkerchief soaked with chloroform.  Fortunately, I was on my guard, and shot the fellow who was entering  with the handkerchief; he fell backwards out of the carriage; I heard  nothing more of the other one, and for aught I know he may be on board  now.\"    \"You did well indeed!\" Sarto said warmly. \"I was in the next carriage to  you. I did not hear the sound of your pistol-shot--I was fast asleep;  but we were all woke up by a fellow-passenger who declared he heard a  gunshot. When we reached Valence he called the guard, who said that he  must have been dreaming, for there was only a young Englishman in the  next carriage, and he knew that when it left the last station he was  alone. When the train went on we all abused the fellow soundly for  waking us with his ridiculous fancies; but it seems that he was right  after all. You say there was another. What became of him?\"    \"I saw nothing more of him. He may be on board, for aught I know, for  they had black handkerchiefs tied over their faces up to the eyes, and  as their hats were pulled well down, I should not know him if I saw  him.\"    \"Well, you have struck the first blow in the war, and I regard it as a  good omen; but you must be careful to-night, for if the fellow is on  board he is likely to make another attempt; and this time, I should say,  he would begin by stabbing you. Are you in a cabin by yourself?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Then one of us will sit up by turns. You must have had a bad night  indeed, while we slept without waking, except when I was aroused by that  fellow making such a row.\"    \"Oh, I could not think of that!\"    \"It must be done,\" Rubini said earnestly. \"However, I will lay the  mattress of the spare bed of your cabin against the door, and lie down  on it--that will do just as well. It will be impossible then to open the  door; and if any one tries to do so, I shall be on my feet in a moment.  I shall sleep just as well like that as in my berth. I have slept in  much more uncomfortable places, and"]]]
