Fortunately Marie knew the way perfectly and there was no occasion  for her to ask for directions, for she had frequently driven with  her mother to visit Louise Moulin. The latter occupied the upper  floor of a house in a quiet quarter near the fortifications in the  north-western part of the town. A message had been sent to her the  night before, and she was on the look-out for her visitors, but  she did not recognize them, and she uttered a cry of surprise as  Marie and Virginie entered the room.    \"Is it you, mademoiselle?\" she exclaimed in great surprise. \"And  you, my little angel? My eyes must be getting old, indeed, that I  did not recognize you; but you are finely disguised. But where is  Mademoiselle Jeanne?\"    \"She will be here in a moment, Louise; she is just behind. But you  must not call me mademoiselle; you must remember that we are your  nieces Marie and Jeanne, and that you are our aunt Louise Moulin,  whom we have come to stay with.\"    \"I shall remember in time,\" the old woman said. \"I have been  talking about you to my neighbours for the last week, of how your  good father and mother have died, and how you were going to journey  to Paris under the charge of a neighbour, who was bringing a waggon  load of wine from Burgundy, and  how you were going to look after  me and help me in the house since I am getting old and infirm, and  the young ones were to stop with me till they were old enough to  go out to service. Ah, here is Mademoiselle Jeanne!\"    \"Here is Jeanne,\" Marie corrected; \"thank God we have all got here  safely. This, Louise, is a young English gentleman who is going to  remain in Paris at present, and to whom we are indebted for having  got us safely here.\"    \"And your mother,\" Louise Moulin exclaimed, \"the darling lamb  I nursed, what of her and your father? I fear, from the message I  got last night, that some danger threatens them.\"    \"They have, I fear, been arrested by the sans culottes,\" Marie said  mournfully as she burst into tears, feeling, now that the strain  was over, the natural reaction after her efforts to be calm. For  her mother's sake she had held up to the last, and had tried to  make the parting as easy as possible.    \"The wretches!\" the old woman said, stamping her foot. \"Old as I am  I feel that I could tear them to pieces. But there I am chattering  away, and you must be faint with hunger. I have a nice soup ready  on the fire, a plate of that will do good to you all. And you too,  monsieur, you will join us, I hope?\"    Harry was nothing loth, for his appetite was always a healthy one.  When he had finished he said:    \"Madame Moulin, I have been thinking that it would be an advantage  if you would take a lodging for me. If you would say that a youth  whose friends are known to you has arrived from Dijon, to make his  way in Paris, and they have asked you to seek a lodging for him;  it will seem less strange than if I went by myself. I should like  it to be near, so that you can come to me quickly should anything  out of the way occur. I should like to look in sometimes to see that  all is well. You could mention to your neighbours that I travelled  up with the same waggon with your nieces.    \"I will do that willingly,\" the old woman said; \"but first, my dears,  you must have some rest; come in here.\" And she led the way to the  next room. \"There is a bed for you, Mademoiselle Marie, and one for  the two young ones. The room is not like what you are accustomed  to, but I dared not buy finer things, though I had plenty of money  from your mother to have  furnished the rooms like a palace; but you  see it would have seemed strange to my neighbours; but, at least,  everything is clean and sweet.\"    Leaving the girls, who were worn out with weariness and anxiety,  to sleep, she rejoined Harry.    \"Now, monsieur, I will do your business. It is a comfort to me to  feel that some one will be near of whom I can ask advice, for it is  a terrible responsibility for an old woman in such dreadful times  as these, when it seems to me that everyone has gone mad at once.  What sort of a chamber do you want?\"    \"Quite a small one,\" Harry answered, \"just such a chamber as a  young clerk on the look-out for employment and with his pocket very  slenderly lined, would desire.\"    \"I know just such a one,\" the old woman said. \"It is a house a  few doors away and has been tenanted by a friend of mine, a young  workwoman, who was married four days ago--it is a quiet place,  and the people keep to themselves, and do not trouble about their  neighbours' affairs.\"    \"That will just suit me,\" Harry said. \"I suppose there is no porter  below, so that I can go in or out without being noticed.\"    \"Oh, we have no porters in this quarter, and you can go in and out  as you like.\"    Half an hour later the matter was settled, and Harry was installed  in his apartment, which was a little room scantily furnished, at  the top of the house, the window looking into the street in front.          CHAPTER VI    An Anxious Time      Harry and the girls had brought bundles of clothes with them  in their flight, as it would have looked strange had they arrived  without any clothes save those they wore. Harry had brought with him  only underlinen, as he had nothing else which would be of service  to him now.  No sooner had Louise Moulin left him than he went out  and purchased, at a second-hand shop, a workman's suit. This he  carried home, and dressing himself in it descended the stairs again  and set out to retrace his steps across Paris.    When he reached the mansion of the marquis he found a crowd of  people going in and out. Those leaving the house were laden with  articles of furniture, clocks, pictures, bedding, and other things.  A complete sack of the mansion was indeed taking place. The servants  had all fled after the arrest of the marquis and his wife, and  the mob had taken possession of the house. The lofty mirrors were  smashed into fragments, the costly hangings torn down, and after  they had destroyed much of the elaborate furniture, every man and  woman began to lay hands upon whatever they fancied and the mansion  was already stripped of the greater part of its belongings.    With his hands in his pockets, whistling carelessly, Harry wandered  from room to room watching the proceedings. Several barrels of wine  had been brought up into the salon, and round these were gathered  a number of already drunken men, singing, shouting, and dancing.    \"Drink, drink, my garcon,\" a woman said, holding a silver goblet  full of wine towards him, \"drink confusion to the tyrants and  liberty and freedom to the people.\"    Harry drank the toast without hesitation, and then, heartsick  at the destruction and ruin, wandered out again into the streets.  Knowing the anxiety which Marie would be suffering as to the safety  of her lover he next took his way to the mansion of the Duke de  Gisons. The house was shut up, but groups of men were standing in  the road opposite talking.    Sauntering along Harry stopped near enough to one of these to hear  what they were saying. He learned that the duke had been arrested  only that morning. It had been effected quietly, the doors had  again been locked before those in the neighbourhood knew what was  going on, and a guard had been left inside, partly, it was said, in  order that the mansion might be preserved from pillage and be used  for public purposes, partly that the young count, who was absent,  might be arrested when he returned.    As Harry knew that the duke had estates in the neighbourhood of  Fontainebleau he thought it probable that Victor might have gone  thither, and he at once proceeded towards the gate by which he would  enter on his return thence. He sat down a short distance outside  the gate and watched patiently for some hours until he perceived a  horseman approaching at a gallop and at once recognized Victor de  Gisons. Harry went forward on to the road and held out his arms.  The young count, not recognizing him, did not check his horse and  would have ridden him down had he not jumped aside, at the same  time shouting to him by name to stop.    \"What do you want, fellow?\" Victor exclaimed, reining in his horse.    \"You do not recognize me!\" Harry said. \"I am Harry Sandwith, count,  and I am here to warn you of the danger of proceeding.\"    \"Why, what has happened?\" Victor exclaimed anxiously; \"and why are  you in disguise, Monsieur Sandwith?\"    \"A great number of arrests have taken place in the night, among them  that of the Marquis de St. Caux and your father. Men are waiting  inside your house to arrest you as you enter.\"    Victor uttered an exclamation of anger.    \"That is why I have been sent away,\" he said. \"My father had no  doubt received a warning of what was about to happen, and yesterday  at noon he requested me to ride to his estate and have an interview  with the steward as to the rents. I wondered at his sending me  so suddenly, and, feeling uneasy,  rode there post-haste, saw the  steward last night, and started again on a fresh horse this morning.  This accounts for it. He knew that if I were there nothing would  have induced me to separate myself from him, while by sending me  away he left it to me to do as I thought fit afterwards, trusting  that when I found that he was already imprisoned I might follow the  counsel he had urged upon me, to make my escape from the country.  And how about the ladies, how about Marie?\"    \"The marquise was conveyed to prison with the marquis. The three  young ladies are all safe with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37856"],[0,"The Determined Angler and the Brook Trout (#16)"],[1," clear conscience--is even more  righteous than net fishing, because, while the main result of the  Angler's pursuit is the same as the marketman's--fish taking--the  Angler's method of capture is far less cruel, and his creel of fish is  far less in number than the boatful of the marketman.    The distinction in angling and fishing is made by the modes employed  in the taking, the killing, and the disposing of the fishes. Any  fisherman who uses tackle appropriate to the various species, who is  not greedy in his catch, who plays his game with mercy, who dispatches  it with the least suffering, who disposes of it without wanton waste,  and who is thankful to the Maker for the ways and means for all these  conditions, is an Angler. And cannot woman be as artful and gentle in  pursuits and as appreciative in feeling as man? Surely. England and  Scotland and Ireland are famous for their women Anglers, and Maine,  the Adirondacks, California, and Canada boast of the finest female  fly-casters in the world. There are more women Anglers in these  last-named territories than there are men Anglers in all other parts  of the United States. A woman, Mary Orris Marbury, wrote the best  volume scientifically descriptive of trout, bass, and salmon flies of  modern times, and Cornelia Crosby, a daughter of the Maine wilderness,  is the fly-fishing enthusiast of America.    Great minds, male and female, have gentle hearts. Izaak Walton handled  a frog as if he loved him. Cowper would not unnecessarily hurt a worm.  Lincoln upset his White House Cabinet to rescue a mother pig from a  mire. Webster neglected the Supreme Court to replace a baby robin that  had fallen from its nest. Moses, John the Divine, Washington, Thoreau.  Audubon, Wilson, and even Napoleon and Caesar the mighty mankillers  were all of tender hearts, and all of these were--Anglers. Christ was  only a fisher of men, but He loved and associated with the fishers of  fishes. Walton, the father of fishers and fishing, angled for the  habits of fishes more than for their hides. The capture of a fish was  insignificantly incidental to the main notion of his hours abroad--his  divine love of the waters, the fields, the meadows, the skies, the  trees, and God's beautiful things that inhabit these. 'Tis the soul we  seek to replenish, not the creel. So a Long Island dairyman's daughter  views the theme, and she handles the mother and baby trout as if she  loved them. _Salvelinus fontinalis_, little salmon of the streams, the  Angler's dearly beloved brook trout--this is the dairymaid's special  delight. She breeds these rainbow-hued beauties and broods over them,  she feeds and fondles them, and they are to her what David's holy,  fleecy flock were to him--his blessed charge by heavenly day and  cardinal care at night. They feed from her hand, and play like kittens  with her fingers. Cleopatra cleaved her fishes with a murderous hand  and hook. Audrey cuddles her trout with a magnanimous mind and heart.    The trout, with all its famous beauty of color, grace, and outline,  all its army of admirers, all the glory of its aqua-fairyland habitat,  all its seeming gentility of breeding and character, is none the less  a little villain at the killing game, like the less admired feline and  canine and serpentine species, for he will devour the daintiest and  gaudiest butterfly that ever poet sang of. Fledgling robins and  bluebirds, orioles and wrens are meat and drink to him. Young  chipmunks and squirrels that lose their balance in the storm fall into  his ready maw. The bat, the bee, the beetle and ladybug are rich  morsels to his gastric eye, and the golden lizard, the umber ant, the  silvery eel, the crawling angleworm, the chirping cricket, creeping  spider, the grasshopper, the hopping frog, and e'en the heavenly  hummingbird are but mealtime mites to him. Perhaps the knowledge of  this life-destroying trait in all the fishes made Cleopatra  indifferent to the gentler mode of fishing, just as it had a softer  influence over Audrey, for she, though loving both the fishes and  their victims, was induced to angle and thus punish, but never kill,  her finny favorites. She had heard of the artificial dry fly Anglers  of Europe using the barbless hook that held the trout without pain or  injury, and this she made herself, tying up dozens of somber-hued and  lustrous patterns on the bent bit of bronze that formed the snare. The  ruly trout who gently waver in the deep pool, satisfied with the food  supplied by their fair mistress, and who behave themselves when they  swim abroad in the general ponds and streams, are not molested, but  the rebellious urchins who, disdaining the bits of liver and worm fed  to them in plenty, go forth to slay the happy ladybug and butterfly,  are made the game of the barbless hook.    Audrey has five or six thousand trout in the pond and the stream  flowing into it. The surrounding country is wildly beautiful, the  water being surrounded by great trees of elm, hickory, maple, beech,  chestnut, walnut, and dogwood, under which is spread a rich green  lawn, with here and there patches of wild shrubs, vines, and ground  flowers. Rustic benches circle the water-edge oaks, and sleek deer, as  tame as Belgian hares, browse on the rich grass and eat dainty morsels  from the palms of their human friends. Cleopatra's marble perch basin  was cold and deadly in its artificial atmosphere. Audrey's woodland  trout preserve is warm and lifelike in its natural loveliness.          CHAPTER XV    THE BROOK TROUT INCOGNITO    (_The \"Sea Trout\"_)        \"I am the wiser in respect to all knowledge and the better      qualified for all fortunes for knowing that there is a minnow in      that brook.\"--THOREAU.      There is still considerable argument about the identification and  classification of the sea trout. Some authorities still claim the sea  trout is a distinct species; others declare it to be the brook trout,  _Salvelinus fontinalis_, that goes to sea from the fresh water ponds  and streams.    The squeteague (_vulgo_ weakfish, wheatfish, sea bass, white sea bass,  carvina, checutts, shecutts, yellowfin, drummer, bluefish, squit,  suckermang, succoteague, squitee, chickwit, gray trout, sun trout,  salmon, salmon trout, shad trout, sea trout, salt-water trout, spotted  trout, etc.) is not a trout of any sort; so this species need not be  considered in this sea trout discussion.    My personal theory concerning the sea trout is that any trout that  goes to sea is a sea trout, and that more than one species of trout go  to sea--whenever they have the opportunity.    The small-stream trout that visit the ocean do so mainly in search of  a change in food; the sea-going trout of large rivers are impelled to  leave their fresh water retreats for the ocean waters also to satisfy  a desire for new varieties of food, but more so because of an instinct  that warns them of the danger of remaining in the fresh-water rivers  during certain periods of the year--the coldest seasons when the  waters freeze to the river bottom, and in the melting time, when the  ice thaws into huge sharp-edge chunks, and the mass of ice,  swift-running water, and rocks turn the rivers into raging, roaring  floods that would cut and bruise the trout unmercifully.    Nature makes these large-river brook trout in the calm periods of  spring, summer, and autumn, and sea trout in severe winter weather and  during dangerous flood time.    The broad streams of the west coast of Newfoundland--Fishels River,  Crabs River, Big and Little Codroy Rivers, Big and Little Barachois  Rivers, and Robinson's River--afford the best evidence of trout  migrating to the sea to escape the fury of the flood, and any of the  little trout streams in any part of the world where the streams flow  into salt water will afford the student means of observing the trout's  fondness for marine excursions in search of a change of diet.    Just as the different species of trout are widely contrasting in  colors, shapes, sizes, traits, etc., while in their natural  habitat--fresh water--so are they confoundingly different in these  matters while sojourning in salt water.    The true brook trout (_Salvelinus fontinalis_) is of various shades,  shapes and sizes, these depending upon the character of the water he  inhabits. In shallow, swift streams of a light color pebble bottom  the specimens in general are likely to be thin, narrow, and of a  bright gray hue, though, of course, there are individual specimens in  this condition of water that are exceptions to the rule--a few old  specimens who have sheltered themselves for years in dark, deep,  steady spots under the protruding bank of the stream, or along the  side of a sunken tree stump, etc. This autocrat of the eddy is fat,  stocky, and dark in color, just the opposite of his younger relatives  of the swift-running part of the stream.    The brook trout of deep, still dark-bottom ponds are fatter, darker,  broader, of duller color and of slower motion than their brothers of  the rapid waters. The trout's shape, weight, size, and color are  influenced by its food, its age, its activity, its habitat, and its  habits. Its color corresponds to the color of the water bottom, and  will change as the water bottom changes. If removed to a new water,  where the bottom color is different from the bottom color of its first  abode--lighter or darker, as the case may be--it will gradually grow  to a corresponding shade, blending with its new habitat just as its  colors suited the stones and grasses and earthy materials of its  native domain.    The landlocked trout, if imprisoned in a deep, dark, muddy-bottom,  shaded woodland pool, will be dull in color, stocky in shape, and of  sluggish habits. The trout confined to a bubbling fountain pool, with  a bottom of golden sand, at the foot of a waterfall, in the full glare  of the sun, will be of albino character.    Perhaps no other"]]]
