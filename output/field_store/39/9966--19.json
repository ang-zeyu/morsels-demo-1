Give me those eyes I used to know    Where thoughts like angels come and go;     --Not glittering eyes, nor dimmed by books,      But eyes through which the deep soul looks.      Give me the quiet hands and face    That never strove for fame and place;      The soul whose love, so many a day      Has brought the heavens about my way._          VII      _Was it a dream, that low dim-lighted room  With that dark periwigged phantom of Dean Swift  Writing, beside a fire, to one he loved,--  Beautiful Catherine Barton, once the light  Of Newton's house, and his half-sister's child?_  Yes, Catherine Barton, I am brave enough  To face this pale, unhappy, wistful ghost  Of our departed friendship.                              It was I  Savage and mad, a snarling kennel of sins,  \"Your Holiness,\" as you called me, with that smile  Which even your ghost would quietly turn on me--  Who raised it up. It has no terrors, dear.  And I shall never lay it while I live.  You write to me. You think I have the power  To shield the fame of Newton from a lie.  Poor little ghost! You think I hold the keys  Not only of Parnassus, then, but hell.    There is a tale abroad that Newton owed  His public office to Lord Halifax,  Your secret lover. Coarseness, as you know,  Is my peculiar privilege. I'll be plain,  And let them wince who are whispering in the dark.  They are hinting that he gained his public post  Through you, his flesh and blood; and that he knew  You were his patron's mistress!                                  Yes, I know  The coffee-house that hatched it--to be scotched,  Nay, killed, before one snuff-box could say \"snap,\"  Had not one cold malevolent face been there  Listening,--that crystal-minded lover of truth,  That lucid enemy of all lies,--Voltaire.  I am told he is doing much to spread the light  Of Newton's great discoveries, there, in France.  There's little fear that France, whose clear keen eyes  Have missed no morning in the realm of thought,  Would fail to see it; and smaller need to lift  A brand from hell to illume the light from heaven.  You fear he'll print his lie. No doubt of that.  I can foresee the phrase, as Halley saw  The advent of his comet,--_jolie niece,  Assez amiable,_ ... then he'll give your name  As _Madame Conduit_, adding just that spice  Of infidelity that the dates admit  To none but these truth-lovers. It will be best  Not to enlighten him, or he'll change his tale  And make an answer difficult. Let him print  This truth as he conceives it, and you'll need  No more defence.  All history then shall damn his death-cold lie  And show you for the laughing child you were  When Newton won his office.                              For yourself  You say you have no fear. Your only thought  Is that they'll soil his fame. Ah yes, they'll try,  But they'll not hurt it. For all time to come  It stands there, firm as marble and as pure.  They can do nothing that the sun and rain  Will not erase at last. Not even Voltaire  Can hurt that noble memory. Think of him  As of a viper writhing at the base  Of some great statue. Let the venomous tongue  Flicker against that marble as it may  It cannot wound it.                      I am far more grieved  For you, who sit there wondering now, too late,  If it were some suspicion, some dark hint  Newton had heard that robbed him of his sleep,  And almost broke his mind up. I recall  How the town buzzed that Newton had gone mad.  You copy me that sad letter which he wrote  To Locke, wherein he begs him to forgive  The hard words he had spoken, thinking Locke  Had tried to embroil him, as he says, with women;  A piteous, humble letter.                            Had he heard  Some hint of scandal that he could not breathe  To you, because he honoured you too well?  I cannot tell. His mind was greatly troubled  With other things. At least, you need not fear  That Newton thought it true. He walked aloof,  Treading a deeper stranger world than ours.  Have you not told me how he would forget  Even to eat and drink, when he was wrapt  In those miraculous new discoveries  And, under this wild maze of shadow and sun  Beheld--though not the Master Player's hand--  The keys from which His organ music rolls,  Those visible symphonies of wild cloud and light  Which clothe the invisible world for mortal eyes.  I have heard that Leibnitz whispered to the court  That Newton was an \"atheist.\" Leibnitz knew  His audience. He could stoop to it.                                      Fools have said  That knowledge drives out wonder from the world;  They'll say it still, though all the dust's ablaze  With miracles at their feet; while Newton's laws  Foretell that knowledge one day shall be song,  And those whom Truth has taken to her heart  Find that it beats in music.                               Even this age  Has glimmerings of it. Newton never saw  His own full victory; but at least he knew  That all the world was linked in one again;  And, if men found new worlds in years to come,  These too must join the universal song.  That's why true poets love him; and you'll find  Their love will cancel all that hate can do.  They are the sentinels of the House of Fame;  And that quick challenging couplet from the pen  Of Alexander Pope is answer enough  To all those whisperers round the outer doors.  There's Addison, too. The very spirit and thought  Of Newton moved to music when he wrote  _The Spacious Firmament_. Some keen-eyed age to come  Will say, though Newton seldom wrote a verse,  That music was his own and speaks his faith.    And, last, for those who doubt his faith in God  And man's immortal destiny, there remains  The granite monument of his own great work,  That dark cathedral of man's intellect,  The vast \"Principia,\" pointing to the skies,  Wherein our intellectual king proclaimed  The task of science,--through this wilderness  Of Time and Space and false appearances,  To make the path straight from effect to cause,  Until we come to that First Cause of all,  The Power, above, beyond the blind machine,  The Primal Power, the originating Power,  Which cannot be mechanical. He affirmed it  With absolute certainty. Whence arises all  This order, this unbroken chain of law,  This human will, this death-defying love?  Whence, but from some divine transcendent Power,  Not less, but infinitely more than these,  Because it is their Fountain and their Guide.  Fools in their hearts have said, \"Whence comes this Power,  Why throw the riddle back this one stage more?\"  And Newton, from a height above all worlds  Answered and answers still:                              \"This universe  Exists, and by that one impossible fact  Declares itself a miracle; postulates  An infinite Power within itself, a Whole  Greater than any part, a Unity  Sustaining all, binding all worlds in one.  This is the mystery, palpable here and now.  'Tis not the lack of links within the chain  From cause to cause, but that the chain exists.  That's the unfathomable mystery,  The one unquestioned miracle that we _know_,  Implying every attribute of God,  The ultimate, absolute, omnipresent Power,  In its own being, deep and high as heaven.  But men still trace the greater to the less,  Account for soul with flesh and dreams with dust,  Forgetting in their manifold world the One,  In whom for every splendour shining here  Abides an equal power behind the veil.  Was the eye contrived by blindly moving atoms,  Or the still-listening ear fulfilled with music  By forces without knowledge of sweet sounds?  Are nerves and brain so sensitively fashioned  That they convey these pictures of the world  Into the very substance of our life,  While That from which we came, the Power that made us,  Is drowned in blank unconsciousness of all?  Does it not from the things we know appear  That there exists a Being, incorporeal,  Living, intelligent, who in infinite space,  As in His infinite sensory, perceives  Things in themselves, by His immediate presence  Everywhere? Of which things, we see no more  Than images only, flashed through nerves and brain  To our small sensories?                          What is all science then  But pure religion, seeking everywhere  The true commandments, and through many forms  The eternal power that binds all worlds in one?  It is man's age-long struggle to draw near  His Maker, learn His thoughts, discern His law,--  A boundless task, in whose infinitude,  As in the unfolding light and law of love.  Abides our hope, and our eternal joy.  I know not how my work may seem to others--\"  So wrote our mightiest mind--\"But to myself  I seem a child that wandering all day long  Upon the sea-shore, gathers here a shell,  And there a pebble, coloured by the wave,  While the great ocean of truth, from sky to sky  Stretches before him, boundless, unexplored.\"    He has explored it now, and needs of me  Neither defence nor tribute. His own work  Remains his monument He rose at last so near  The Power divine that none can nearer go;  None in this age! To carry on his fire  We must await a mightier age to come.          VI    WILLIAM HERSCHEL CONDUCTS      _Was it a dream?--that crowded concert-room  In Bath; that sea of ruffles and laced coats;  And William Herschel, in his powdered wig,  Waiting upon the platform, to conduct  His choir and Linley's orchestra? He stood  Tapping his music-rest, lost in his own thoughts  And (did I hear or dream them?) all were mine:_    My periwig's askew, my ruffle stained  With grease from my new telescope!                                     Ach, to-morrow  How Caroline will be vexed, although she grows  Almost as bad as I, who cannot leave  My work-shop for one evening.                                I must give  One last recital at St. Margaret's,  And then--farewell to music.                               Who can lead  Two lives at once?

That is true.    _Ly_. Well, don't you think it will be a troublesome business to  distinguish the first, and know them from the ignorant professors?    _Her_. Very.    _Ly_. So, if you are to recognize the best of the Stoics, you will have to  go to most, if not all, of them, make trial, and appoint the best your  teacher, first going through a course of training to provide you with the  appropriate critical faculty; otherwise you might mistakenly prefer the  wrong one. Now reflect on the additional time this will mean; I purposely  left it out of account, because I was afraid you might be angry; all the  same, it is the most important and necessary thing of all in questions  like this--so uncertain and dubious, I mean. For the discovery of truth,  your one and only sure or well-founded hope is the possession of this  power: you _must_ be able to judge and sift truth from falsehood; you must  have the assayer's sense for sound and true or forged coin; if you could  have come to your examination of doctrines equipped with a technical skill  like that, I should have nothing to say; but without it there is nothing  to prevent their severally leading you by the nose; you will follow a  dangled bunch of carrots like a donkey; or, better still, you will be  water spilt on a table, trained whichever way one chooses with a  finger-tip; or again, a reed growing on a river's bank, bending to every  breath, however gentle the breeze that shakes it in its passage.    If you could find a teacher, now, who understood demonstration and  controversial method, and would impart his knowledge to you, you would be  quit of your troubles; the best and the true would straightway be  revealed to you, at the bidding of this art of demonstration, while  falsehood would stand convicted; you would make your choice with  confidence; judgement would be followed by philosophy; you would reach  your long-desired Happiness, and live in its company, which sums up all  good things.    _Her_. Thank you, Lycinus; that is a much better hearing; there is  more than a glimpse of hope in that. We must surely look for a man of  that sort, to give us discernment, judgement, and, above all, the power  of demonstration; then all will be easy and clear, and not too long. I am  grateful to you already for thinking of this short and excellent plan.    _Ly_. Ah, no, I cannot fairly claim gratitude yet. I have not discovered  or revealed anything that will bring you nearer your hope; on the  contrary, we are further off than ever; it is a case of much cry and  little wool.    _Her_. Bird of ill omen, pessimist, explain yourself.    _Ly_. Why, my friend, even if we find some one who claims to know this art  of demonstration, and is willing to impart it, we shall surely not take  his word for it straight off; we shall look about for another man to  resolve us whether the first is telling the truth. Finding number two, we  shall still be uncertain whether our guarantor really knows the difference  between a good judge and a bad, and shall need a number three to guarantee  number two; for how can we possibly know ourselves how to select the best  judge? You see how far this must go; the thing is unending; its nature  does not allow us to draw the line and put a stop to it; for you will  observe that all the demonstrations that can possibly be thought of are  themselves unfounded and open to dispute; most of them struggle to  establish their certainty by appealing to facts as questionable as  themselves; and the rest produce certain truisms with which they compare,  quite illegitimately, the most speculative theories, and then say they  have demonstrated the latter: our eyes tell us there are altars to the  Gods; therefore there must be Gods; that is the sort of thing.    _Her_. How unkindly you treat me, Lycinus, turning my treasure into  ashes; I suppose all these years are to have been lost labour.    _Ly_. At least your chagrin will be considerably lessened by the  thought that you are not alone in your disappointment; practically all  who pursue philosophy do no more than disquiet themselves in vain. Who  could conceivably go through all the stages I have rehearsed? you admit  the impossibility yourself. As to your present mood, it is that of the  man who cries and curses his luck because he cannot climb the sky, or  plunge into the depths of the sea at Sicily and come up at Cyprus, or  soar on wings and fly within the day from Greece to India; what is  responsible for his discontent is his basing of hopes on a dream-vision  or his own wild fancy, without ever asking whether his aspirations were  realizable or consistent with humanity. You too, my friend, have been  having a long and marvellous dream; and now reason has stuck a pin into  you and startled you out of your sleep; your eyes are only half open yet,  you are reluctant to shake off a sleep which has shown you such fair  visions, and so you scold. It is just the condition of the day-dreamer;  he is rolling in gold, digging up treasure, sitting on his throne, or  somehow at the summit of bliss; for dame _How-I-wish_ is a lavish  facile Goddess, that will never turn a deaf ear to her votary, though he  have a mind to fly, or change statures with Colossus, or strike a gold-  reef; well, in the middle of all this, in comes his servant with some  every-day question, wanting to know where he is to get bread, or what he  shall say to the landlord, tired of waiting for his rent; and then he  flies into a temper, as though the intrusive questioner had robbed him of  all his bliss, and is ready to bite the poor fellow's nose off.    As you love me, do not treat me like that. I see you digging up treasure,  spreading your wings, nursing extravagant ideas, indulging impossible  hopes; and I love you too well to leave you to the company of a life-long  dream--a pleasant one, if you will, but yet a dream; I beseech you to get  up and take to some every-day business, such as may direct the rest of  your life's course by common sense. Your acts and your thoughts up to now  have been no more than Centaurs, Chimeras, Gorgons, or what else is  figured by dreams and poets and painters, chartered libertines all, who  reek not of what has been or may be. Yet the common folk believe them,  bewitched by tale and picture just because they are strange and monstrous.    I fancy you hearing from some teller of tales how there is a certain lady  of perfect beauty, beyond the Graces themselves or the Heavenly  Aphrodite, and then, without ever an inquiry whether his tale is true,  and such a person to be found on earth, falling straight in love with  her, like Medea in the story enamoured of a dream-Jason. And what most  drew you on to love, you and the others who worship the same phantom,  was, if I am not mistaken, the consistent way in which the inventor of  the lady added to his picture, when once he had got your ear. That was  the only thing you all looked to, with that he turned you about as he  would, having got his first hold upon you, averring that he was leading  you the straight way to your beloved. After the first step, you see, all  was easy; none of you ever looked round when he came to the entrance, and  inquired whether it was the right one, or whether he had accidentally  taken the wrong; no, you all followed in your predecessors' footsteps,  like sheep after the bell-wether, whereas the right thing was to decide  at the entrance whether you should go in.    Perhaps an illustration will make my meaning clearer: when one of those  audacious poets affirms that there was once a three-headed and six-handed  man, if you accept that quietly without questioning its possibility, he  will proceed to fill in the picture consistently--six eyes and ears,  three voices talking at once, three mouths eating, and thirty fingers  instead of our poor ten all told; if he has to fight, three of his hands  will have a buckler, wicker targe, or shield apiece, while of the other  three one swings an axe, another hurls a spear, and the third wields a  sword. It is too late to carp at these details, when they come; they are  consistent with the beginning; it was about that that the question ought  to have been raised whether it was to be accepted and passed as true.  Once grant that, and the rest comes flooding in, irresistible, hardly now  susceptible of doubt, because it is consistent and accordant with your  initial admissions. That is just your case; your love-yearning would not  allow you to look into the facts at each entrance, and so you are dragged  on by consistency; it never occurs to you that a thing may be self-  consistent and yet false; if a man says twice five is seven, and you take  his word for it without checking the sum, he will naturally deduce that  four times five is fourteen, and so on _ad libitum_. This is the way  that weird geometry proceeds: it sets before beginners certain strange  assumptions, and insists on their granting the existence of inconceivable  things, such as points having no parts, lines without breadth, and so on,  builds on these rotten foundations a superstructure equally rotten, and  pretends to go on to a demonstration which is true, though it starts from  premisses which are false.    Just so you, when you have granted the principles of any school, believe  in the deductions from them, and take their consistency, false as it is,  for a guarantee of truth. Then with some of you, hope travels through,  and you die before you have seen the truth and detected your deceivers,  while the rest, disillusioned too late, will not turn back for shame:  what, confess at their years that they have been abused with toys all  this time? so they hold on desperately, putting the best face upon it and  making all the converts they can, to have the consolation of good company  in their deception; they "]]]
