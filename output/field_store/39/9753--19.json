[Footnote 301: Bk. II: sec. 8, Sec.1.]    [Footnote 302: Bk. II, ch. 46.]    [Footnote 303: _Phil. Works_: 705.]    [Footnote 304: Bk. III.]    [Footnote 305: _Phil. Works_: 684-685.]    All the more common arguments against the diurnal rotation of the  earth are well stated in an interesting little letter (1619) by  Thomas Feyens, or Fienus, a professor at the school of medicine in the  University of Louvain.[306] Thus Catholic, Protestant, and unbeliever,  Feyens, Melancthon, Bacon and Bodin, all had recourse to the same  arguments to oppose this seemingly absurd doctrine.    [Footnote 306: Translated in Appendix C. For criticism, see Monchamp:  58-64.]    Froidmont, or Fromundus, the good friend and colleague of Feyens at  Louvain, was also much interested in these matters, so much so that  some thought he had formerly accepted the Copernican doctrine and  \"only fled back into the camp of Aristotle and Ptolemy through terror  at the decree of the S. Congregation of Cardinals.\"[307] His indignant  denial of this imputation of turn-coat in 1634 is somewhat weakened by  reference to his _Saturnalitae Coenae_[308] (1615) in which he suggests  that, if the Copernican doctrine is admitted, then Hell may be in the  sun at the center of the universe rather than in the earth, in order  to be as far as possible from Paradise. He also refers in his _De  Cometa_ (1618) to the remark of Justus-Lipsius[309] that this paradox  was buried with Copernicus, saying \"You are mistaken, O noble scholar:  it lives, and it is full of vigor even now among many,\"[310] thus  apparently not seeing serious objection to it. M. Monchamp summarizes  Froidmont's point of view as against Aristotle and Ptolemy, half for  Copernicus and wholly for Tycho Brahe.    [Footnote 307: Fromundus: _Vesta_: Ad Lectorem.]    [Footnote 308: Monchamp: 41.]    [Footnote 309: Justus-Lipsius: IV, 947.]    [Footnote 310: Monchamp: 48.]    Froidmont's best known books are the two he wrote in answer to a  defense of the Copernican position first by Philip Lansberg, then by  his son. The _Ant-Aristarchus sive Orbis Terrae Immobilis, Liber unicus  in quo decretum S. Congregationis S.R.E. Cardinal. an. 1616, adversus  Pythagorico-Copernicanus editum, defenditur_, appeared in 1631 before  Galileo's condemnation. The Jesuit Cavalieri wrote to Galileo in May  about it thus:[311] \"I have run it through, and verily it states the  Copernican theory and the arguments in its favor with so much skill  and efficacy that he seems to have understood it very well indeed. But  he refutes them with so little force that he seems rather to be of an  opinion contrary to that expressed in the title of his book. I have  given it to M. Cesar. If you wish it, I will have it sent to you. The  arguments he brings against Copernicus are those you have so  masterfully stated and answered in your _Dialogo_.\" Nearly a year  later, Galileo wrote to Gassendi and Diodati that he had received this  book a month before and, although he had been unable to read much of  it on account of his eye trouble, it seemed to him that of all the  opponents of Copernicus whom he had seen, Fromundus was the most  sensible and efficient.[312] Again he wrote in January, 1633,  regretting that he had not seen it till six months after he had  published his dialogues, for he would have both praised it and  commented upon certain points. \"As for Fromundus (who however shows  himself to be a man of great talent) I wish he had not fallen into  what seems to me a truly serious error, although a rather common one,  in order to refute the Copernican opinion, of beginning by poking  scorn and ridicule at those who consider it true, and then (what seems  to me still less becoming) of basing his attack chiefly on the  authority of the Scriptures, and finally of deducing from this that in  this respect it is an opinion little short of heretical. To argue in  this way is clearly not praiseworthy;\" for as Galileo goes on to show,  if the Scriptures are the word of God, the heavens themselves are his  handiwork. Why is the one less noble than the other?[313]    [Footnote 311: Ibid: 94.]    [Footnote 312: Galileo: _Opere_: XV, 25.]    [Footnote 313: Ibid: XIV, 340-341.]    Froidmont replied in 1633 to Lansberg's reply with his second attack,  _Vesta, sive Ant-Aristarchi Vindex_, in which he laid even more  emphasis upon the theological and scriptural objections. Yet, in  ignorance of Galileo's condemnation, he considers the charge of heresy  too strong. \"The partisans of this system do not after all disdain the  authority of the Scriptures, although they appear to interpret it in a  way rather in their favor.\" He also, and rightly, denies the existence  at that time of any conclusive proof.[314]    [Footnote 314: Monchamp: 107-108.]    In spite of Froidmont's position, the University of Louvain was not  cordial in its response to the papal nuncio's announcement in  September, 1633, of Galileo's abjuration and sentence, in marked  contrast to the reply sent by the neighboring university of Douay. The  latter body, in a letter signed by Matthaeus Kellison (Sept. 7, 1633),  declared the condemned theory \"should be discarded and hissed from the  schools; and that in the English College there in Douay, this paradox  never had been approved and never would be, but had always been  opposed and always would be.\"[315]    [Footnote 315: Doc. in Favaro: 120-121, 132, 133.]    This opposition in the universities in Belgium continued throughout  the century to be based not so much on scientific grounds as upon the  Bible. This may be seen in the manuscript reports of lectures in  physics and astronomy given at Liege in 1662, and at Louvain between  1650-1660, though one of these does not mention the decree of  1616.[316] The general congregation of the Society of Jesus in 1650  drew up a list of the propositions proscribed in their teaching,  though, according to M. Monchamp (himself a Catholic) not thereby  implying a denial of any probability they might have. The 35th  proposition ran: \"Terra movetur motu diurno; planetae, tanquam  viventia, moventur ab intrinseco. Firmamentum stat.\"[317] The Jesuit  astronomer Tacquet in his textbook (Antwerp, 1669) respected this  decision, acknowledging that no scientific reason kept him from  defending the theory, but solely his respect for the Christian  faith.[318]    [Footnote 316: Monchamp: 125, 143.]    [Footnote 317: Ibid: 148-149.]    [Footnote 318: Ibid: 152-153.]    One of the pupils of the Jesuits revolted however. Martin van Welden,  appointed professor of mathematics at Louvain in 1683, debated a  series of theses in January, 1691. The second read: \"Indubitum est  systhema Copernici de planetarum motu circa sole; inter quos merito  terra censetur.\" His refusal to alter the wording except to change  _indubitum_ to _certum_ brought on a stormy controversy within the  faculty which eventually reached the Council of Brabant and the papal  nuncio at Brussels.[319] The professor finally submitted, though he  was not forbidden to teach the Copernician system, nor did the faculty  affirm its falsity, merely that it was contrary to the Roman decree.  The professor re-opened the matter with a similar thesis in July,  thereby arousing a second controversy that this time reached even the  Privy Council. Once more he submitted, but solely with an apology for  having caused a disagreement. His new theses in 1695 contained no  explicit mention of the Copernician system; at least he had learned  tact.[320]    [Footnote 319: Ibid: 182-234.]    [Footnote 320: Monchamp: 321.]    The absorption of the German states in the Thirty Years War may  account for the apparent absence there of Copernican discussion until  after the Peace of Westphalia. A certain Georgius Ludovicus Agricola  gave a syllogistic refutation of the doctrine as his disputation at  the university of Wittenberg in 1665. While he acknowledged its  ingenuity, he preferred to it \"the noblest, truest, and divinely  inspired system\" of Tycho Brahe. The four requirements of an  acceptable astronomical hypothesis according to this student are: (1)  That it suit all the observations of all the ages; (2) That as far as  possible, it be simple and clear; (3) That it be not contrary to the  principles of physics and optics; (4) That it be not contrary to the  Holy Scriptures. As the Copernican theory does not meet all these  tests, it is unsatisfactory. Incidentally, he considers it \"ridiculous  to include the earth among the planets, because then we would be  living in Heaven, forsooth, since we would be in a star.\" He decides  finally \"that the decree of March, 1616, condemning the Copernican  opinion was not unjust, nor was Galileo unfairly treated.\"[321]    [Footnote 321: Agricola: _Disputatio_.]    Two years later appeared a textbook at Nuernberg, by a Jesuit father,  based on the twelfth century Sacrobosco treatise and without a single  reference so far as I could find, to Copernicus![322] Another  publication of the same year was a good deal more up to date. This was  a kind of catechism in German by Johann-Henrich Voight[323] explaining  for the common people various scientific and mathematical problems in  a hundred questions and answers. He himself, a Royal Swedish  astronomer, obviously preferred the Tychonic system, but he left his  reader free to choose between that and the Copernican one, both of  which he carefully explained.[324] He made an interesting summary in  parallel columns of the arguments for and against the earth's motion  which it seems worth while to repeat as an instance of what the common  people were taught:      Reasons for asserting the earth is motionless:    1. David in Psalm 89: God has founded the earth and it shall not be  moved.    2. Joshua bade the sun stand still--which would not be notable were it  not already at rest.    3. The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3580"],[0,"Recollections of the Private Life of Napoleon — Complete (#16)"],[1,"spread by her enemies, and those of the  Emperor, had had the least foundation?    Before her marriage Hortense had an attachment for General Duroc, who was  hardly thirty years of age, had a fine figure, and was a favorite with  the chief of state, who, knowing him to be prudent and discreet, confided  to him important diplomatic missions. As aide-de-camp of the First  Consul, general of division, and governor of the Tuileries, he lived long  in familiar intimacy at Malmaison, and in the home life of the Emperor,  and during necessary absences on duty, corresponded with Mademoiselle  Hortense; and yet the indifference with which he allowed the marriage of  the latter with Louis to proceed, proves that he reciprocated but feebly  the affection which he had inspired. It is certain that he could have  had. Mademoiselle de Beauharnais for his wife, if he had been willing to  accept the conditions on which the First Consul offered the hand of his  step-daughter; but he was expecting something better, and his ordinary  prudence failed him at the time when it should have shown him a future  which was easy to foresee, and calculated to satisfy the promptings of an  ambition even more exalted than his. He therefore refused positively;  and the entreaties of Madame Bonaparte, which had already influenced her  husband, succeeded.    Madame Bonaparte, who saw herself treated with so little friendship by  the brothers of the First Consul, tried to make his family a defense for  herself against the plots which were gathering incessantly around her to  drive her away from the heart of her husband. It was with this design  she worked with all her might to bring about the marriage of her daughter  with one of her brothers-in-law.    General Duroc doubtless repented immediately of his precipitate refusal  when crowns began to rain in the august family to which he had had it in  his power to ally himself; when he saw Naples, Spain, Westphalia, Upper  Italy, the duchies of Parma, Lucca, etc., become the appendages of the  new imperial dynasty; when the beautiful and graceful Hortense herself,  who had loved him so devotedly, mounted in her turn a throne that she  would have been only too happy to have shared with the object of her  young affections. As for him, he married Mademoiselle Hervas d'Almenara,  daughter of the banker of the court of Spain. She was a little woman  with a very dark complexion, very thin, and without grace; but, on the  other hand, of a most peevish, haughty, exacting, and capricious temper.  As she was to have on her marriage an enormous dowry, the First Consul  had demanded her hand in marriage for his senior aide-de-camp. Madame  Duroc forgot herself, I have heard, so far as to beat her servants, and  to bear herself in a most singular manner toward people who were in no  wise her dependants. When M. Dubois came to tune her piano,  unfortunately she was at home, and finding the noise required by this  operation unendurable, drove the tuner off with the greatest violence.  In one of these singular attacks she one day broke all the keys of his  instrument. Another time Mugnier, clockmaker of the Emperor, and the  head of his profession in Paris, with Breguet, having brought her a watch  of very great value that madame, the Duchess of Friuli had herself  ordered, but which did not please her, she became so enraged, that, in  the presence of Mugnier, she dashed the watch on the floor, danced on it,  and reduced it to atoms. She utterly refused to pay for it, and the  marshal was compelled to do this himself. Thus Duroc's want of foresight  in refusing the hand of Hortense, together with the interested  calculations of Madame Bonaparte, caused the misery of two households.    The portrait I have sketched, and I believe faithfully, although not a  flattering picture, is merely that of a young woman with all the  impulsiveness of the Spanish character, spoiled as an only daughter, who  had been reared in indulgence, and with the entire neglect which hinders  the education of all the young ladies of her country. Time has calmed  the vivacity of her youth; and madame, the Duchess of Friuli, has since  given an example of most faithful devotion to duty, and great strength of  mind in the severe trials that she has endured. In the loss of her  husband, however grievous it might be, glory had at least some  consolation to offer to the widow of the grand marshal. But when her  young daughter, sole heiress of a great name and an illustrious title,  was suddenly taken away by death from all the expectations and the  devotion of her mother, who could dare to offer her consolation? If  there could be any (which I do not believe), it would be found in the  remembrance of the cares and tenderness lavished on her to the last by  maternal love. Such recollections, in which bitterness is mingled with  sweetness, were not wanting to the duchess.    The religious ceremony of marriage between Louis and Hortense took place  Jan. 7, in a house in the Rue de la Victoire; and the marriage of General  Murat with Caroline Bonaparte, which had been acknowledged only before  the civil authorities, was consecrated on the same day. Both Louis and  his bride were very sad. She wept bitterly during the whole ceremony,  and her tears were not soon dried. She made no attempt to win the  affection of her husband; while he, on his side, was too proud and too  deeply wounded to pursue her with his wooing. The good Josephine did all  she could to reconcile them; for she must have felt that this union,  which had begun so badly, was her work, in which she had tried to combine  her own interest, or at least that which she considered such, and the  happiness of her daughter. But her efforts, as well as her advice and  her prayers, availed nothing; and I have many a time seen Hortense seek  the solitude of her own room, and the heart of a friend, there to pour  out her tears. Tears fell from her eyes sometimes even in the midst of  one of the First Consul's receptions, where we saw with sorrow this young  woman, brilliant and gay, who had so often gracefully done the honors on  such occasions and attended to all the details of its etiquette, retire  into a corner, or into the embrasure of a window, with one of her most  intimate friends, there to sadly make her the a confidante of her trials.  During this conversation, from which she rose with red and swollen eyes,  her husband remained thoughtful and taciturn at the opposite end of the  room. Her Majesty, the Queen of Holland, has been accused of many sins;  but everything said or written against this princess is marked by  shameful exaggeration. So high a fortune drew all eyes to her, and  excited bitter jealousy; and yet those who envied her would not have  failed to bemoan themselves, if they had been put in tier place, on  condition that they were to bear her griefs. The misfortunes of Queen  Hortense began with life itself. Her father having been executed on a  revolutionary scaffold, and her mother thrown into prison, she found  herself, while still a child, alone, and with no other reliance than the  faithfulness of the old servants of the family. Her brother, the noble  and worthy Prince Eugene, had been compelled, it is said, to serve as an  apprentice. She had a few years of happiness, or at least of repose,  during the time she was under the care of Madame Campan, and just after  she left boarding-school. But her evil destiny was far from quitting  her; and her wishes being thwarted, an unhappy marriage opened for her a  new succession of troubles. The death of her first son, whom the Emperor  wished to adopt, and whom he had intended to be his successor in the  Empire, the divorce of her mother, the tragic death of her best-loved  friend, Madame de Brocq, who, before her eyes, slipped over a precipice;  the overturning of the imperial throne, which caused her the loss of her  title and rank as queen, a loss which she, however, felt less than the  misfortunes of him whom she regarded as her father; and finally, the  continual annoyance of domestic dissensions, of vexatious lawsuits, and  the agony she suffered in beholding her oldest surviving son removed from  her by order of her husband,--such were the principal catastrophes in a  life which might have been thought destined for so much happiness.    The day after the marriage of Mademoiselle Hortense, the First Consul set  out for Lyons, where there awaited him the deputies of the Cisalpine  Republic, assembled for the election of a president. Everywhere on his  route he was welcomed with fetes and congratulations, with which all were  eager to overwhelm him on account of the miraculous manner in which he  had escaped the plots of his enemies. This journey differed in no wise  from the tours which he afterwards made as Emperor. On his arrival at  Lyons, he received the visit of all the authorities, the constituent  bodies, the deputations from the neighboring departments, and the members  of the Italian councils. Madame Bonaparte, who accompanied him on this  journey, attended with him these public displays, and shared with him the  magnificent fete given to him by the city of Lyons. The day on which the  council elected and proclaimed the First Consul president of the Italian  Republic he reviewed, on the Place des Brotteaux, the troops of the  garrison, and recognized in the ranks many soldiers of the army of Egypt,  with whom he conversed for some time. On all these occasions the First  Consul wore the same costume that he had worn at Malmaison, and which I  have described elsewhere. He rose early, mounted his horse, and visited  the public works, among others those of the Place Belcour, of which he  had laid the corner-stone on his return from Italy, passed through the  Place des Brotteaux, inspected, examined everything, and, always  indefatigable, worked on his return as if he had been at the Tuileries.
