These he organized into a branch of the  Church, and, having placed the work in this island on a substantial  footing, he returned to Liverpool.        CHAPTER XI.    RETURN TO NAUVOO--SICKNESS OF LEONORA--SAVED BY THE POWER OF  GOD--FOUNDS \"NAUVOO NEIGHBOR\"--EDITS \"TIMES AND SEASONS\"--NOMINATES THE  PROPHET FOR PRESIDENT--REASONS--INTRODUCTION OF CELESTIAL MARRIAGE--HIS  CONDUCT IN REGARD TO IT.    The remainder of Elder Taylor's time while on his first mission to  England was employed mostly in preaching in Liverpool and in assisting  the Saints who were beginning to emigrate to Nauvoo.    There was something singular in this movement among the British Saints.  When the Apostles started on their missions, the Prophet Joseph had  instructed them to say nothing, for the present, in relation to  the gathering of the people. It was doubtless the unsettled state  of the Church at that time which led him to give such counsel. The  instructions were, of course, followed by the Apostles; but no sooner  were the people baptized than they were seized with a desire to gather  with the main body of the Church. \"I find it is difficult to keep  anything from the Saints,\" writes Elder Taylor, \"for the Spirit of God  reveals it to them. * * * Some time ago Sister Mitchel dreamed that  she, her husband and a number of others were on board a vessel, and  that there were other vessels, loaded with Saints, going somewhere. She  felt very happy and was rejoicing in the Lord.\" Another sister had a  similar dream, and was informed that all the Saints were going. Neither  of these sisters, nor any of the Saints at that time, knew anything  about the principle of gathering, yet all were anxious to leave their  homes, their kindred and the associations of a lifetime, to join the  main body of the Church in a distant land, the members of which were  total strangers to them.    Not only had this desire to gather with the Church taken hold of them,  but those who had means were moved upon to assist those who were poor.  Altogether more than eight hundred Saints left England before the  Apostles turned their faces homeward, and Elder Taylor was of material  service to them in Liverpool, as he secured for them the best possible  terms for their passage; organized them into companies, appointing  the most experienced and wisest among them to take charge, that the  inexperienced might not be a prey for sharpers and rogues to feast upon.    In addition to these labors, Elder Taylor visited Manchester,  Birmingham, Sheffield and many other cities, everywhere preaching the  gospel with great success, everywhere preaching the gospel with great  success, converting the unbelieving and strengthening and encouraging  the Saints. Thus the autumn and winter of 1840--41 passed away.    The object for which the Apostles had visited Great Britain was  accomplished. They had established the Church there on a sound basis.  The Book of Mormon and the Hymn Book had been published; a periodical  to advocate and defend the faith delivered to the Saints established;  a permanent shipping agency founded to aid the Saints in gathering to  Zion; branches had been organized in nearly all the principal towns of  the kingdom, and some eight thousand souls had been baptized. In all  this labor Elder Taylor had taken an active, prominent part; and now,  in company with his fellow Apostles, Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball,  Orson Pratt, Wilford Woodruff, George A. Smith and Willard Richards, he  sailed on the ship _Rochester_ for America.    Elder Taylor arrived in Nauvoo on the 1st of July, 1841. Here a great  sorrow was awaiting him--his faithful, patient Leonora was sick  nigh unto death. The hardships in Missouri, the separation from her  husband,--on whose strong arm and steadfast courage she was wont to  lean,--and the consequent increase of care in watching over her family,  had at last broken down her strength; and hence he found her pale and  wan, and death clutching at her precious life. He called in twenty  Elders, who prayed for her; she was anointed with oil, hands were laid  upon her, and, in fulfillment of God's promise, the prayer of faith  healed the sick--the Lord raised her up.    It was shortly after the return of the Twelve from England that  the Prophet Joseph made known to them the doctrine of celestial  marriage--the marriage system that obtains in the celestial worlds  where the Gods dwell,--marriage that is to endure for time and for  eternity, the ceremony being performed by one holding that power which  binds on earth and binds in heaven. Celestial marriage also includes a  plurality of wives.    This system of marriage had been revealed to the Prophet a number of  years before, but he had kept the matter in his own heart. The time  had come, however, when the principles of this marriage system must  be made known to others and the practice thereof entered into by the  faithful in the Priesthood. Hitherto the Saints, in common with the  so-called Christian world, had married until death did them part; but  now, through the introduction of celestial marriage, the covenants  between men and their wives were to be made for eternity as well as  for time. In this marriage system the great truth is revealed that the  association of husband and wife, with all its endearing associations is  to continue forever; and that--to paraphrase the words of one who spake  as if inspired on this theme [1]--as long as there is room in infinite  space, or matter in the exhaustless storehouse of nature, or as long  as the bosoms of the Gods glow with affection, just so long will new  worlds be created and filled with the ever increasing posterity of the  righteous, and new kingdoms added to the dominions of the Fathers!    The plurality of wives included in this system of marriage is what gave  rise to grave concern in the minds of the faithful men to whom it was  revealed. The world never made a greater mistake than when it supposed  that plural marriage was hailed with delight by the Elders who were  commanded of the Lord to introduce its practice in this generation.  They saw clearly that it would bring additional reproach upon them from  the world; that it would run counter to the traditions and prejudices  of society, as, indeed, it was contrary to their own traditions; that  their motives would be misunderstood or misconstrued. All this they  saw, and naturally shrank from the undertaking required of them by the  revelation of God. How Elder Taylor looked upon this matter and how he  received it is best told in his own words:    \"Joseph Smith told the Twelve that if this law was not practiced,  if they would not enter into this covenant, then the Kingdom of God  could not go one step further. Now, we did not feel like preventing  the Kingdom of God from going forward. We professed to be the Apostles  of the Lord, and did not feel like putting ourselves in a position to  retard the progress of the Kingdom of God. The revelation says that  'All those who have this law revealed unto them must obey the same.'  Now, that is not my word. I did not make it. It was the Prophet of God  who revealed that to us in Nauvoo, and I bear witness of this solemn  fact before God, that He did reveal this sacred principle to me and  others of the Twelve, and in this revelation it is stated that it is  the will and law of God that 'all those who have this law revealed unto  them must obey the same.'    \"I had always entertained strict ideas of virtue, and I felt as  a married man that this was to me, outside of this principle, an  appalling thing to do. The idea of going and asking a young lady to be  married to me when I had already a wife! It was a thing calculated to  stir up feelings from the innermost depths of the human soul. I had  always entertained the strictest regard of chastity. I had never in my  life seen the time when I have known of a man deceiving a woman--and it  is often done in the world, where, notwithstanding the crime, the man  is received into society and the poor woman is looked upon as a pariah  and an outcast--I have always looked upon such a thing as infamous,  and upon such a man as a villain. * * * Hence, with the feelings I had  entertained, nothing but a knowledge of God, and the revelations of  God, and the truth of them, could have induced me to embrace such a  principle as this.    \"We [the Twelve] seemed to put off, as far as we could, what might be  termed the evil day.    \"Some time after these things were made known unto us, I was riding out  of Nauvoo on horseback, and met Joseph Smith coming in, he, too, being  on horseback. * * * I bowed to Joseph, and having done the same to me,  he said: 'Stop;' and he looked at me very intently. 'Look here,' said  he, 'those things that have been spoken of must be fulfilled, and if  they are not entered into right away the keys will be turned.'    \"Well, what did I do? Did I feel to stand in the way of this great,  eternal principle, and treat lightly the things of God? No. I replied:  'Brother Joseph, I will try and carry these things out.\"'    So indeed he did, for within two years, in Nauvoo, he married Elizabeth  Haigham, Jane B. Ballantyne and Mary A. Oakley. Subsequently, in Utah,  he married Harriet Whitaker, Sophia Whitaker and Margaret Young. [2]    By tongue and pen, as well as by the force of example, he defended this  celestial order of marriage against all who assailed it; and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4532"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Photo Telephone or the Picture That Saved a Fortune (#16)"],[1,"one. Tom wanted a permanent record.    Eagerly the chums in the dark room looked down into the tray  containing the plate and the developing solution.    \"Something's coming out!\" cried Ned, eagerly.    \"Yes! And it's you!\" exclaimed Tom. \"See, Ned, I got your picture  over the telephone. Success! I've struck it! This is the best  yet!\"    At that moment, as the picture came out more and more plainly,  someone knocked on the door of the dark room.    \"Who is it?\" asked Tom.    \"Gen'man t' see you,\" said Eradicate. \"He say he come from Mistah  Peters!\"    \"Mr. Peters--that rascally promoter!\" whispered Tom to his chum.  \"What does this mean?\"            CHAPTER XVII    THE MYSTERIOUS MESSAGE      Tom Swift and his chum looked at one another strangely for a  moment in the dim, red light of the dark room. Then the young  inventor spoke:    \"I'm not going to see him. Tell him so, Rad!\"    \"Hold on a second,\" suggested Ned. \"Maybe you had better see him,  Tom. It may have something to with Mr. Damon's lost fortune.\"    \"That's so! I didn't think of that. And I may get a clue to his  disappearance, though I don't imagine Peters had anything to do  with that. Wait, Rad. Tell the gentleman I'll see him. Did he give  any name, Rad?\"    \"Yas, sah. Him done say him Mistah Boylan.\"    \"The same man who called to see me once before, trying to get me  to do some business with Peters,\" murmured Tom. \"Very well, I'll  see him as soon as this picture is fixed. Tell him to wait, Rad.\"    A little later Tom went to where his caller awaited in the  library. This time there were no plans to be looked at, the young  inventor having made a practice of keeping all his valuable papers  locked in a safe.    \"You go into the next room, Ned,\" Tom had said to his chum. \"Leave  the door open, so you can hear what is said.\"    \"Why, do you think there'll be trouble? Maybe we'd better have  Koku on hand to--\"    \"Oh, no, nothing like that,\" laughed Tom. \"I just want you to  listen to what's said so, if need be, you can be a witness later.  I don't know what their game is, but I don't trust Peters and his  crowd. They may want to get control of some of my patents, and  they may try some underhanded work. If they do I want to be in a  position to stop them.\"    \"All right,\" agreed Ned, and he took his place.    But Mr. Boylan's errand was not at all sensational, it would seem.  He bowed to Tom, perhaps a little distantly, for they had not  parted the best of friends on a former occasion.    \"I suppose you are surprised to see me,\" began Mr. Boylan.    \"Well, I am, to tell the truth,\" Tom said, calmly.    \"I am here at the request of my employer, Mr. Peters,\" went on the  caller. \"He says he is forming a new and very powerful company to  exploit airships, and he wants to know whether you would not  reconsider your determination not to let him do some business for  you.\"    \"No, I'm afraid I don't care to go into anything like that,\" said  Tom.    \"It would be a good thing for you,\" proceeded Mr. Boylan, eagerly.  \"Mr. Peters is able to command large capital, and if you would  permit the use of your airships--or one of them--as a model, and  would supervise the construction of others, we could confidently  expect large sales. Thus you would profit, and I am frank to admit  that the company, and Mr. Peters, also, would make money. Mr.  Peters is perfectly free to confess that he is in business to make  money, but he is also willing to let others share with him. Come  now, what do you say?\"    \"I am sorry, but I shall have to say the same thing I said  before,\" replied Tom. \"Nothing doing!\"    Mr. Boylan glanced rather angrily at the young inventor, and then,  with a shrug of his shoulders, remarked:    \"Well, you have the say, of course. But I would like to remind you  that this is going to be a very large airship company, and if your  inventions are not exploited some others will be. And Mr. Peters  also desired me to say that this is the last offer he would make  you.\"    \"Tell him,\" said Tom, \"that I am much obliged, but that I have no  business that I can entrust to him. If he wishes to make some  other type of airship, that is his affair. Good-day.\"    As Mr. Boylan was going out Tom noticed a button dangling from the  back of his caller's coat. It hung by a thread, being one of the  pair usually sewed on the back of a cutaway garment.    \"I think you had better take off that button before it falls,\"  suggested Tom. \"You may lose it, and perhaps it would be hard to  match.\"    \"That's so. Thank you!\" said Mr. Boylan. He tried to reach around  and get it, but he was too stout to turn easily, especially as the  coat was tight-fitting.    \"I'll get it for you,\" offered Tom, as he pulled it off. \"There is  one missing, though,\" he said, as he handed the button to the man.  And then Tom started as he saw the pattern of the one in his hand.    \"One gone? That's too bad,\" murmured Mr. Boylan. \"Those buttons  were imported, and I doubt if I can replace them. They are rather  odd.\"    \"Yes,\" agreed Tom, gazing as if fascinated at the one he still  held. \"They are rather odd.\"    And then, as he passed it over, like a flash it came to him where  he had seen a button like that before. He had found it in his  airship, which had been so mysteriously taken away and returned.    Tom could hardly restrain his impatience until Mr. Boylan had  gone. The young inventor had half a notion to produce the other  button, matching the one he had just pulled off his visitor's  coat, and tell where he had found it. But he held himself back. He  wanted to talk first to Ned.    And, when his chum came in, Tom cried:    \"Ned, what do you think? I know who had my airship!\"    \"How?\" asked Ned, in wonder.    \"By that button clue! Yes, it's the same kind--they're as alike as  twins!\" and Tom brought out the button which he had put away in  his desk. \"See, Boylan had one just like this on the back of his  coat. The other was missing. Here it is--it was in the seat of my  airship, where it was probably pulled off as he moved about. Ned,  I think I've got the right clue at last.\"    Ned said nothing for several seconds. Then he remarked slowly:    \"Well, Tom, it proves one thing; but not the other.\"    \"What do you mean?\"    \"I mean that it may be perfectly true that the button came off Mr.  Boylan's coat, but that doesn't prove that he wore it. You can be  reasonably sure that the coat was having a ride in your Eagle, but  was Boylan in the coat? That's the question.\"    \"In the coat? Of course he was in it!\" cried Tom.    \"You can't be sure. Someone may have borrowed his coat to take a  midnight ride in the airship.\"    \"Mr. Boylan doesn't look to be the kind of a man who would lend  his clothes,\" remarked Tom.    \"You never can tell. Someone may have borrowed it without his  knowledge. You'd better go a bit slow, Tom.\"    \"Well, maybe I had. But it's a clue, anyhow.\"    Ned agreed to this.    \"And all I've got to do is to find out who was in the coat when it  was riding about in my airship,\" went on Tom.    \"Yes,\" said Ned, \"and then maybe you'll have some clue to the  disappearance of Mr. Damon.\"    \"Right you are! Come on, let's get busy!\"    \"As if we hadn't been busy all the while!\" laughed Ned. \"I'll lose  my place at the bank if I don't get back soon.\"    \"Oh, stay a little longer--a few days,\" urged Tom. \"I'm sure that  something is going to happen soon. Anyhow my photo telephone is  about perfected. But I've just thought of another improvement.\"    \"What is it?\"    \"I'm going to arrange a sort of dictaphone, or phonograph, so I  can get a permanent record of what a person says over the wire, as  well as get a picture of him saying it. Then everything will be  complete. This last won't be hard to do, as there are several  machines on the market now, for preserving a record of telephone  conversations. I'll make mine a bit different, though.\"    \"Tom, is there any limit to what you're going to do?\" asked Ned,  admiringly.    \"Oh, yes, I'm going to stop soon, and retire,\" laughed the young  inventor.    After talking the matter over, Tom and his chum decided to wait a  day or so before taking any action in regard to the button clue to  the takers of the airship. After all, no great harm had been done,  and Tom was more anxious to locate Mr. Damon, and try to get back  his fortune, as well as to perfect his photo telephone, than he  was to discover those who had helped themselves to the Eagle.    Tom and Ned put in some busy days, arranging the phonograph  attachment. It was easy, compared to the hard work of sending a  picture over the wire. They paid several visits to Mrs. Damon, but  she had no news of her missing husband, and, as the days went by,  she suffered more and more under the strain.    Finally Tom's new invention was fully completed. It was a great  success, and he not only secured pictures of Ned and others over  the wire, as he talked to them, but he imprinted on wax cylinders,  to be reproduced later, the very things they said.    It was a day or so after he had demonstrated his new attachment  for the first time, that Tom received a most urgent message from  Mrs. Damon.    \"Tom,\" she said, over the telephone, \"I wish you would call.  Something very mysterious has happened.\"    \"Mr. Damon hasn't come back; has he?\" asked Tom eagerly.    \"No--but I wish I could say he had. This concerns him, however.  Can you come?\"    \"I'll be there right away.\"    In his speedy monoplane Tom soon reached Waterford. Ned did not  accompany him this time.    \"Now what is it, Mrs. Damon?\" asked the young inventor.    \"About half an hour before I called you,\" she said, \"I received a  mysterious message.\"    \"Who brought it?\" asked Tom quickly.    \"No one. It came over the telephone. Someone, whose voice I did  not know, said to me: 'Sign the land papers, and send them to us,  and your husband will be released.'\"    \"That message came over the wire?\" cried Tom,"]]]
