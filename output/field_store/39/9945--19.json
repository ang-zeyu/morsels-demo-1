So he told him he was  quite right in pursuing the object he had in view, and that such a motive  was natural and becoming in cavaliers as distinguished as he seemed and  his gallant bearing showed him to be; and that he himself in his younger  days had followed the same honourable calling, roaming in quest of  adventures in various parts of the world, among others the Curing-grounds  of Malaga, the Isles of Riaran, the Precinct of Seville, the Little  Market of Segovia, the Olivera of Valencia, the Rondilla of Granada, the  Strand of San Lucar, the Colt of Cordova, the Taverns of Toledo, and  divers other quarters, where he had proved the nimbleness of his feet and  the lightness of his fingers, doing many wrongs, cheating many widows,  ruining maids and swindling minors, and, in short, bringing himself under  the notice of almost every tribunal and court of justice in Spain; until  at last he had retired to this castle of his, where he was living upon  his property and upon that of others; and where he received all  knights-errant of whatever rank or condition they might be, all for the  great love he bore them and that they might share their substance with  him in return for his benevolence. He told him, moreover, that in this  castle of his there was no chapel in which he could watch his armour, as  it had been pulled down in order to be rebuilt, but that in a case of  necessity it might, he knew, be watched anywhere, and he might watch it  that night in a courtyard of the castle, and in the morning, God willing,  the requisite ceremonies might be performed so as to have him dubbed a  knight, and so thoroughly dubbed that nobody could be more so. He asked  if he had any money with him, to which Don Quixote replied that he had  not a farthing, as in the histories of knights-errant he had never read  of any of them carrying any. On this point the landlord told him he was  mistaken; for, though not recorded in the histories, because in the  author's opinion there was no need to mention anything so obvious and  necessary as money and clean shirts, it was not to be supposed therefore  that they did not carry them, and he might regard it as certain and  established that all knights-errant (about whom there were so many full  and unimpeachable books) carried well-furnished purses in case of  emergency, and likewise carried shirts and a little box of ointment to  cure the wounds they received. For in those plains and deserts where they  engaged in combat and came out wounded, it was not always that there was  some one to cure them, unless indeed they had for a friend some sage  magician to succour them at once by fetching through the air upon a cloud  some damsel or dwarf with a vial of water of such virtue that by tasting  one drop of it they were cured of their hurts and wounds in an instant  and left as sound as if they had not received any damage whatever. But in  case this should not occur, the knights of old took care to see that  their squires were provided with money and other requisites, such as lint  and ointments for healing purposes; and when it happened that knights had  no squires (which was rarely and seldom the case) they themselves carried  everything in cunning saddle-bags that were hardly seen on the horse's  croup, as if it were something else of more importance, because, unless  for some such reason, carrying saddle-bags was not very favourably  regarded among knights-errant. He therefore advised him (and, as his  godson so soon to be, he might even command him) never from that time  forth to travel without money and the usual requirements, and he would  find the advantage of them when he least expected it.    Don Quixote promised to follow his advice scrupulously, and it was  arranged forthwith that he should watch his armour in a large yard at one  side of the inn; so, collecting it all together, Don Quixote placed it on  a trough that stood by the side of a well, and bracing his buckler on his  arm he grasped his lance and began with a stately air to march up and  down in front of the trough, and as he began his march night began to  fall.    The landlord told all the people who were in the inn about the craze of  his guest, the watching of the armour, and the dubbing ceremony he  contemplated. Full of wonder at so strange a form of madness, they  flocked to see it from a distance, and observed with what composure he  sometimes paced up and down, or sometimes, leaning on his lance, gazed on  his armour without taking his eyes off it for ever so long; and as the  night closed in with a light from the moon so brilliant that it might vie  with his that lent it, everything the novice knight did was plainly seen  by all.    Meanwhile one of the carriers who were in the inn thought fit to water  his team, and it was necessary to remove Don Quixote's armour as it lay  on the trough; but he seeing the other approach hailed him in a loud  voice, \"O thou, whoever thou art, rash knight that comest to lay hands on  the armour of the most valorous errant that ever girt on sword, have a  care what thou dost; touch it not unless thou wouldst lay down thy life  as the penalty of thy rashness.\" The carrier gave no heed to these words  (and he would have done better to heed them if he had been heedful of his  health), but seizing it by the straps flung the armour some distance from  him. Seeing this, Don Quixote raised his eyes to heaven, and fixing his  thoughts, apparently, upon his lady Dulcinea, exclaimed, \"Aid me, lady  mine, in this the first encounter that presents itself to this breast  which thou holdest in subjection; let not thy favour and protection fail  me in this first jeopardy;\" and, with these words and others to the same  purpose, dropping his buckler he lifted his lance with both hands and  with it smote such a blow on the carrier's head that he stretched him on  the ground, so stunned that had he followed it up with a second there  would have been no need of a surgeon to cure him. This done, he picked up  his armour and returned to his beat with the same serenity as before.          Shortly after this, another, not knowing what had happened (for the  carrier still lay senseless), came with the same object of giving water  to his mules, and was proceeding to remove the armour in order to clear  the trough, when Don Quixote, without uttering a word or imploring aid  from anyone, once more dropped his buckler and once more lifted his  lance, and without actually breaking the second carrier's head into  pieces, made more than three of it, for he laid it open in four. At the  noise all the people of the inn ran to the spot, and among them the  landlord. Seeing this, Don Quixote braced his buckler on his arm, and  with his hand on his sword exclaimed, \"O Lady of Beauty, strength and  support of my faint heart, it is time for thee to turn the eyes of thy  greatness on this thy captive knight on the brink of so mighty an  adventure.\" By this he felt himself so inspired that he would not have  flinched if all the carriers in the world had assailed him. The comrades  of the wounded perceiving the plight they were in began from a distance  to shower stones on Don Quixote, who screened himself as best he could  with his buckler, not daring to quit the trough and leave his armour  unprotected. The landlord shouted to them to leave him alone, for he had  already told them that he was mad, and as a madman he would not be  accountable even if he killed them all. Still louder shouted Don Quixote,  calling them knaves and traitors, and the lord of the castle, who allowed  knights-errant to be treated in this fashion, a villain and a low-born  knight whom, had he received the order of knighthood, he would call to  account for his treachery. \"But of you,\" he cried, \"base and vile rabble,  I make no account; fling, strike, come on, do all ye can against me, ye  shall see what the reward of your folly and insolence will be.\" This he  uttered with so much spirit and boldness that he filled his assailants  with a terrible fear, and as much for this reason as at the persuasion of  the landlord they left off stoning him, and he allowed them to carry off  the wounded, and with the same calmness and composure as before resumed  the watch over his armour.    But these freaks of his guest were not much to the liking of the  landlord, so he determined to cut matters short and confer upon him at  once the unlucky order of knighthood before any further misadventure  could occur; so, going up to him, he apologised for the rudeness which,  without his knowledge, had been offered to him by these low people, who,  however, had been well punished for their audacity. As he had already  told him, he said, there was no chapel in the castle, nor was it needed  for what remained to be done, for, as he understood the ceremonial of the  order, the whole point of being dubbed a knight lay in the accolade and  in the slap on the shoulder, and that could be administered in the middle  of a field; and that he had now done all that was needful as to watching  the armour, for all requirements were satisfied by a watch of two hours  only, while he had been more than four about it. Don Quixote believed it  all, and told him he stood there ready to obey him, and to make an end of  it with as much despatch as possible; for, if he were again attacked, and  felt himself to be dubbed knight, he would not, he thought, leave a soul  alive in the castle, except such as out of respect he might spare at his  bidding.

In short, my son, observe all her actions and  motions, for if thou wilt report them to me as they were, I will gather  what she hides in the recesses of her heart as regards my love; for I  would have thee know, Sancho, if thou knowest it not, that with lovers  the outward actions and motions they give way to when their loves are in  question are the faithful messengers that carry the news of what is going  on in the depths of their hearts. Go, my friend, may better fortune than  mine attend thee, and bring thee a happier issue than that which I await  in dread in this dreary solitude.\"    \"I will go and return quickly,\" said Sancho; \"cheer up that little heart  of yours, master mine, for at the present moment you seem to have got one  no bigger than a hazel nut; remember what they say, that a stout heart  breaks bad luck, and that where there are no fletches there are no pegs;  and moreover they say, the hare jumps up where it's not looked for. I say  this because, if we could not find my lady's palaces or castles to-night,  now that it is daylight I count upon finding them when I least expect it,  and once found, leave it to me to manage her.\"    \"Verily, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"thou dost always bring in thy  proverbs happily, whatever we deal with; may God give me better luck in  what I am anxious about.\"    With this, Sancho wheeled about and gave Dapple the stick, and Don  Quixote remained behind, seated on his horse, resting in his stirrups and  leaning on the end of his lance, filled with sad and troubled  forebodings; and there we will leave him, and accompany Sancho, who went  off no less serious and troubled than he left his master; so much so,  that as soon as he had got out of the thicket, and looking round saw that  Don Quixote was not within sight, he dismounted from his ass, and seating  himself at the foot of a tree began to commune with himself, saying,  \"Now, brother Sancho, let us know where your worship is going. Are you  going to look for some ass that has been lost? Not at all. Then what are  you going to look for? I am going to look for a princess, that's all; and  in her for the sun of beauty and the whole heaven at once. And where do  you expect to find all this, Sancho? Where? Why, in the great city of El  Toboso. Well, and for whom are you going to look for her? For the famous  knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, who rights wrongs, gives food to those  who thirst and drink to the hungry. That's all very well, but do you know  her house, Sancho? My master says it will be some royal palace or grand  castle. And have you ever seen her by any chance? Neither I nor my master  ever saw her. And does it strike you that it would be just and right if  the El Toboso people, finding out that you were here with the intention  of going to tamper with their princesses and trouble their ladies, were  to come and cudgel your ribs, and not leave a whole bone in you? They  would, indeed, have very good reason, if they did not see that I am under  orders, and that 'you are a messenger, my friend, no blame belongs to  you.' Don't you trust to that, Sancho, for the Manchegan folk are as  hot-tempered as they are honest, and won't put up with liberties from  anybody. By the Lord, if they get scent of you, it will be worse for you,  I promise you. Be off, you scoundrel! Let the bolt fall. Why should I go  looking for three feet on a cat, to please another man; and what is more,  when looking for Dulcinea will be looking for Marica in Ravena, or the  bachelor in Salamanca? The devil, the devil and nobody else, has mixed me  up in this business!\"    Such was the soliloquy Sancho held with himself, and all the conclusion  he could come to was to say to himself again, \"Well, there's remedy for  everything except death, under whose yoke we have all to pass, whether we  like it or not, when life's finished. I have seen by a thousand signs  that this master of mine is a madman fit to be tied, and for that matter,  I too, am not behind him; for I'm a greater fool than he is when I follow  him and serve him, if there's any truth in the proverb that says, 'Tell  me what company thou keepest, and I'll tell thee what thou art,' or in  that other, 'Not with whom thou art bred, but with whom thou art fed.'  Well then, if he be mad, as he is, and with a madness that mostly takes  one thing for another, and white for black, and black for white, as was  seen when he said the windmills were giants, and the monks' mules  dromedaries, flocks of sheep armies of enemies, and much more to the same  tune, it will not be very hard to make him believe that some country  girl, the first I come across here, is the lady Dulcinea; and if he does  not believe it, I'll swear it; and if he should swear, I'll swear again;  and if he persists I'll persist still more, so as, come what may, to have  my quoit always over the peg. Maybe, by holding out in this way, I may  put a stop to his sending me on messages of this kind another time; or  maybe he will think, as I suspect he will, that one of those wicked  enchanters, who he says have a spite against him, has changed her form  for the sake of doing him an ill turn and injuring him.\"    With this reflection Sancho made his mind easy, counting the business as  good as settled, and stayed there till the afternoon so as to make Don  Quixote think he had time enough to go to El Toboso and return; and  things turned out so luckily for him that as he got up to mount Dapple,  he spied, coming from El Toboso towards the spot where he stood, three  peasant girls on three colts, or fillies--for the author does not make  the point clear, though it is more likely they were she-asses, the usual  mount with village girls; but as it is of no great consequence, we need  not stop to prove it.    To be brief, the instant Sancho saw the peasant girls, he returned full  speed to seek his master, and found him sighing and uttering a thousand  passionate lamentations. When Don Quixote saw him he exclaimed, \"What  news, Sancho, my friend? Am I to mark this day with a white stone or a  black?\"    \"Your worship,\" replied Sancho, \"had better mark it with ruddle, like the  inscriptions on the walls of class rooms, that those who see it may see  it plain.\"    \"Then thou bringest good news,\" said Don Quixote.    \"So good,\" replied Sancho, \"that your worship has only to spur Rocinante  and get out into the open field to see the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, who,  with two others, damsels of hers, is coming to see your worship.\"    \"Holy God! what art thou saying, Sancho, my friend?\" exclaimed Don  Quixote. \"Take care thou art not deceiving me, or seeking by false joy to  cheer my real sadness.\"    \"What could I get by deceiving your worship,\" returned Sancho,  \"especially when it will so soon be shown whether I tell the truth or  not? Come, senor, push on, and you will see the princess our mistress  coming, robed and adorned--in fact, like what she is. Her damsels and she  are all one glow of gold, all bunches of pearls, all diamonds, all  rubies, all cloth of brocade of more than ten borders; with their hair  loose on their shoulders like so many sunbeams playing with the wind; and  moreover, they come mounted on three piebald cackneys, the finest sight  ever you saw.\"    \"Hackneys, you mean, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote.    \"There is not much difference between cackneys and hackneys,\" said  Sancho; \"but no matter what they come on, there they are, the finest  ladies one could wish for, especially my lady the princess Dulcinea, who  staggers one's senses.\"    \"Let us go, Sancho, my son,\" said Don Quixote, \"and in guerdon of this  news, as unexpected as it is good, I bestow upon thee the best spoil I  shall win in the first adventure I may have; or if that does not satisfy  thee, I promise thee the foals I shall have this year from my three mares  that thou knowest are in foal on our village common.\"    \"I'll take the foals,\" said Sancho; \"for it is not quite certain that the  spoils of the first adventure will be good ones.\"    By this time they had cleared the wood, and saw the three village lasses  close at hand. Don Quixote looked all along the road to El Toboso, and as  he could see nobody except the three peasant girls, he was completely  puzzled, and asked Sancho if it was outside the city he had left them.    \"How outside the city?\" returned Sancho. \"Are your worship's eyes in the  back of your head, that you can't see that they are these who are coming  here, shining like the very sun at noonday?\"    \"I see nothing, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"but three country girls on  three jackasses.\"    \"Now, may God deliver me from the devil!\" said Sancho, \"and can it be  that your worship takes three hackneys--or whatever they're called-as  white as the driven snow, for jackasses? By the Lord, I could tear my  beard if that was the case!\"    \"Well, I can only say, Sancho, my friend,\" said Don Quixote, \"that it is  as plain they are jackasses--or jennyasses--as that I am Don Quixote, and  thou Sancho Panza: at any rate, they seem to me to be so.\"    \"Hush, senor,\" said Sancho, \"don't talk that way, but open your eyes, and  come and pay your respects to the lady of your thoughts, who is close  upon us now;\" and with these words he advanced to receive the three  village lasses, and dismounting from Dapple, caught hold of one of the  asses of the three country girls by the halter, and dropping on both  knees on the ground, he said, \"Queen and princess and duchess of beauty, "]]]
