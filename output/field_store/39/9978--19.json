They followed all day but could not overtake him. They saw a Beaver  but failed to get it. No other game was found.    Things were getting serious now, since all our food consisted of  1 Crane, 1 tin of brawn, 1 pound of bread, 2 pounds of pork, with  some tea, coffee, and sugar, not more than one square meal for  the crowd, and we were 5 men far from supplies, unless our hunting  proved successful, and going farther every day.    Next morning (July 9) each man had coffee, one lady's finger  of bread, and a single small slice of bacon. Hitherto from choice  I had not eaten bacon in this country, although it was a regular  staple served at each meal. But now, with proper human perversity,  I developed an extraordinary appetite for bacon. It seemed quite  the most delicious gift of God to man. Given bacon, and I was ready  to forgo all other foods. Nevertheless, we had divided the last of  it. I cut my slice in two, revelled in half, then secretly wrapped  the other piece in paper and hid it in the watch-pocket of my  vest, thinking \"the time is in sight when the whole crowd will be  thankful to have that scrap of bacon among them.\" (As a matter of  fact, they never got it, for five days later we found a starving  dog and he was so utterly miserable that he conjured that scrap  from the pocket next my heart.)    We were face to face with something like starvation now; the game  seemed to shun us and our store of victuals was done. Yet no one  talked of giving up or going back. We set out to reach the Buffalo  country, and reach it we would.    That morning we got 7 little Teal, so our lunch was sure, but  straight Teal without accompaniments is not very satisfying; we  all went very hungry. And with one mind we all thought and talked  about the good dinners or specially fine food we once had had.  Selig's dream of bliss was a porterhouse steak with a glass of foaming  beer; Jarvis thought champagne and roast turkey spelt heaven just  then; I thought of my home breakfasts and the Beaux-Arts at New  York; but Billy said he would he perfectly happy if he could have  one whole bannock all to himself. Preble said nothing.          CHAPTER XIX    WHITE MAN AND RED. MEAT, BUT NOTHING MORE        There was plenty of hollow hilarity but no word of turning back.  But hold! yes, there was. There was one visage that darkened more  each day, and finally the gloomy thoughts broke forth in words  from the lips of--our Indian guide. His recent sullen silence was  now changed to open and rebellious upbraiding.    He didn't come here to starve. He could do that at home. He was  induced to come by a promise of plenty of flour. \"All of which was  perfectly true. But,\" he went on, \"We were still 11 days from the  Buffalo and we were near the head of navigation; it was a case  of tramp through the swamp with our beds and guns, living on the  country as we went, and if we didn't have luck the Coyotes and  Ravens would.\"    Before we had time to discuss this prospect, a deciding step was  announced, by Jarvis, He was under positive orders to catch the  steamer Wrigley at Fort Resolution on the evening of July 10. It was  now mid-day of July 9, and only by leaving at once and travelling  all night could he cover the intervening 60 miles.    So then and there we divided the remnants of food evenly, for  \"Bezkya was a moose-hunter.\"    Then Major Jarvis and Corporal Selig boarded the smaller canoe.  We shook hands warmly, and I at least had a lump in my throat;  they were such good fellows in camp, and to part this way when  we especially felt bound to stick together, going each of us on a  journey of privation and peril, seemed especially hard; and we were  so hungry. But we were living our lives. They rounded the bend, we  waved goodbye, and I have never seen them since.    Hitherto I was a guest; now I was in sole command, and called a  council of war. Billy was stanch and ready to go anywhere at any  cost. So was Preble. Bezkya was sulky and rebellious. Physically,  I had been at the point of a total breakdown when I left home; the  outdoor life had been slowly restoring me, but the last few days  had weakened me sadly and I was not fit for a long expedition on  foot. But of one thing I was sure, we must halt till we got food.  A high wind was blowing and promised some respite to the Moose from  the little enemy that sings except when he stings, so I invited  Bezkya to gird up his loins and make another try for Moose.    Nothing loath, he set off with Billy. I marked them well as they  went, one lithe, sinewy, active, animal-eyed; the other solid and  sturdy, following doggedly, keeping up by sheer blundering strength.  I could not but admire them, each in his kind.    Two hours later I heard two shots, and toward evening the boys came  back slowly, tired but happy, burdened with the meat, for Bezkya  was a moosehunter.    Many shekels and gladly would I have given to have been on that  moose hunt. Had I seen it I could have told it. These men, that  do it so well, never can tell it. Yet in the days that followed  I picked up a few significant phrases that gave glimpses of its  action.    Through the crooked land of endless swamp this son of the woods  had set out \"straightaway west.\" A big track appeared crossing a  pool, seeming fresh. \"No! he go by yesterday; water in track not  muddy.\" Another track was found. \"Yes, pretty good; see bite alder.  Alder turn red in two hours; only half red.\" Follow long. \"Look  out, Billy; no go there; wrong wind. Yes, he pass one hour; see  bit willow still white. Stop; he pass half-hour; see grass still  bend. He lie down soon. How know? Oh, me know. Stand here, Billy.  He sleep in thick willow there.\"    Then the slow crawl in absolute stillness, the long wait, the  betrayal of the huge beast by the ear that wagged furiously to  shake off the winged bloodsuckers. The shot, the rush, the bloody  trail, the pause in the opening to sense the foe, the shots from  both hunters, and the death.    Next day we set out in the canoe for the Moose, which lay conveniently  on the river bank. After pushing through the alders and poling up  the dwindling stream for a couple of hours we reached the place  two miles up, by the stream. It was a big bull with no bell, horns  only two-thirds grown but 46 inches across, the tips soft and  springy; one could stick a knife through them anywhere outside of  the basal half.    Bezkya says they are good to eat in this stage; but we had about  700 pounds of good meat so did not try. The velvet on the horns is  marked by a series of concentric curved lines of white hair, across  the lines of growth; these, I take it, correspond with times of  check by chill or hardship.    We loaded our canoe with meat and pushed on toward the Buffalo  country for two miles more up the river. Navigation now became very  difficult on account of alders in the stream. Bezkya says that only  a few hundred yards farther and the river comes from underground.  This did not prove quite correct, for I went half a mile farther  by land and found no change.    Here, however, we did find some Buffalo tracks; one went through  our camp, and farther on were many, but all dated from the spring  and were evidently six weeks old.    There were no recent tracks, which was discouraging, and the air  of gloom over our camp grew heavier. The weather had been bad ever  since we left Fort Smith, cloudy or showery. This morning for the  first time the day dawned with a clear sky, but by noon it was  cloudy and soon again raining. Our diet consisted of nothing but  Moose meat and tea; we had neither sugar nor salt, and the craving  for farinaceous food was strong and growing. We were what the.  natives call \"flour hungry\"; our three-times-a-day prospect of Moose,  Moose, Moose was becoming loathsome. Bezkya was openly rebellious  once more, and even my two trusties were very, very glum. Still,  the thought of giving up was horrible, so I made a proposition:  \"Bezkya, you go out scouting on, foot and see if you can locate a  band. I'll give you five dollars extra if you show me one Buffalo.\"    At length he agreed to go provided I would set out for Fort  Resolution at once unless he found Buffalo near. This was leaving  it all in his hands. While I was considering, Preble said: \"I tell  you this delay is playing the mischief with our Barren-Ground trip;  we should have started for the north ten days ago,\" which was in  truth enough to settle the matter.    I knew perfectly well beforehand what Bezkya's report would be.    At 6.30 he returned to say he found nothing but old tracks. There  were no Buffalo nearer than two days' travel on foot, and he should  like to return at once to Fort Resolution.    There was no further ground for debate; every one and everything  now was against me. Again I had to swallow the nauseating draught  of defeat and retreat.    \"We start northward first thing in the morning,\" I said briefly,  and our third Buffalo hunt was over.    These, then, were the results so far as Buffalo were concerned:  Old tracks as far down as last camp, plenty of old tracks here and  westward, but the Buffalo, as before on so many occasions, were  two days' travel to the westward.    During all this time I had lost no good opportunity of impressing  on the men the sinfulness of leaving a camp-fire burning and of  taking life unnecessarily; and now, I learned of fruit from this  seeding. That night Bezkya was in a better humour, for obvious  reasons; he talked freely and told me how that day he came on a  large Blackbear which at once took to a tree. The Indian had his  rifle, but thought, \"I can kill him, yet I can't stop to skin him  or use his meat,\" so left him in peace.    This is really a remarkable incident, almost unique. I am glad  to believe that I had something to do with causing such unusual  forbearance.          CHAPTER XX "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6840"],[0,"Queen Lucia (#16)"],[1," door, go to bed, and be very  polite in the morning. But that would never do: Hermy and Ursy would  have a joke against him forever. It was really much better to share in  the joke, identifying himself with it. So he brushed his hair in the  orthodox fashion, put on a very smart dressing-gown, and came tripping  downstairs again.    \"My dears, what fun!\" he said. \"Let's all have supper. But let's move  into the dining-room, where there's a table, and I'll get another  bottle of wine, and some glasses, and we'll bring Tipsipoozie in. You  naughty girls, fancy arriving at a time like this. I suppose your plan  was to go very quietly to bed, and come down to breakfast in the  morning, and give me a fine surprise. Tell me about it now.\"    So presently Tipsipoozie was having his marmalade, which did just as  well as jam, and they were all eating slices off the ham, and stuffing  them into split buns.    \"Yes, we thought we might as well do it all in one go,\" said Hermy,  \"and it's a hundred and twenty miles, if it's a yard. And then it was  so late when we got here, we thought we wouldn't disturb you, specially  as the drawing-room window wasn't bolted.\"    \"Bicycles outside,\" said Ursy, \"they'll just have to be out at grass  till morning. Oh, Tipsi-ipsi-poozie-woozy, how is you? Hope he behaved  like the good little Tiptree that he is, Georgie?\"    \"O yes, we made great friends,\" said Georgie sketchily. \"He was wee bit  upset at the station, but then he had a good tea with his Uncle Georgie  and played hide and seek.\"    Rather rashly, Georgie made a face at Tiptree, the sort of face which  amuses children. But it didn't amuse Tiptree, who made another face, in  which teeth played a prominent part.    \"Fool-dog,\" said Hermy, carelessly smacking him across the nose.  \"Always hit him if he shows his teeth, Georgie. Pass the fizz.\"    \"Well, so we got through the drawing-room window,\" continued Ursy, \"and  golly, we were hungry. So we foraged, and there we were! Jolly plucky  of you, Georgie, to come down and beard us.\"    \"Real sport,\" said Hermy. \"And how's old Fol-de-rol-de-ray? Why didn't  she come down and fight us, too?\"    Georgie guessed that Hermy was making a humourous allusion to Foljambe,  who was the one person in Riseholme whom his two sisters seemed to hold  in respect. Ursy had once set a booby-trap for Georgie, but the mixed  biscuits and Brazil nuts had descended on Foljambe instead. On that  occasion Foljambe, girt about in impenetrable calm, had behaved as if  nothing had happened and trod on biscuits and Brazil nuts without a  smile, unaware to all appearance that there was anything whatever  crunching and exploding beneath her feet. That had somehow quelled the  two, who, as soon as she left the room again, swept up the mess, and  put the uninjured Brazil nuts back into the dessert dish.... It would  never do if Foljambe lost her prestige and was alluded to by some  outrageously slangy name.    \"If you mean Foljambe,\" said Georgie icily, \"it was because I didn't  think it worth while to disturb her.\"    In spite of their ride, the indefatigable sisters were up early next  morning, and the first thing Georgie saw out of his bathroom window was  the pair of them practising lifting shots over the ducking pond on the  green till breakfast was ready. He had given a short account of last  night's adventure to Foljambe when she called him, omitting the episode  about his hair, and her disapproval was strongly indicated by her  silence then, and the studied contempt of her manner to the sisters  when they came in to breakfast.    \"Hullo, Foljambe,\" said Hermy. \"We had a rare lark last night.\"    \"So I understand, miss,\" said Foljambe.    \"Got in through the drawing-room window,\" said Hermy, hoping to make  her smile.    \"Indeed, miss,\" said Foljambe. \"Have you any orders for the car, sir?\"    \"Oh, Georgie, may we run over to the links this morning?\" asked Hermy.  \"Mayn't Dickie-bird take us there?\"    She glanced at Foljambe to see whether this brilliant wit afforded her  any amusement. Apparently it didn't.    \"Tell Dicky to be round at half-past ten,\" said Georgie.    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Hurrah!\" said Ursy. \"Come, too, Foljambe, and we'll have a three-ball  match.\"    \"No, thank you, miss,\" said Foljambe, and sailed from the room, looking  down her nose.    \"Golly, what an iceberg!\" said Hermy when the door was quite shut.    Georgie was not sorry to have the morning to himself, for he wanted to  have a little quiet practice at the Mozart trio, before he went over to  Lucia's at half-past eleven, the hour when she had arranged to run  through it for the first time. He would also have time to do a few  posturing exercises before the first Yoga-class, which was to take  place in Lucia's smoking-parlour at half-past twelve. That would make a  pretty busy morning, and as for the afternoon, there would be sure to  be some callers, since the arrival of his sisters had been expected,  and after that he had to go to the Ambermere Arms for his visit to Olga  Bracely.... And what was he to do about her with regard to Lucia?  Already he had been guilty of disloyalty, for Lady Ambermere had warned  him of the prima-donna's arrival yesterday, and he had not instantly  communicated that really great piece of news to Lucia. Should he make  such amends as were in his power for that omission, or, greatly daring,  should he keep her to himself, as Mrs Quantock so fervently wished that  she had done with regard to the Guru? After the adventure of last  night, he felt he ought to be able to look any situation in the face,  but he found himself utterly unable to conceive himself manly and erect  before the bird-like eyes of the Queen, if she found out that Olga  Bracely had been at Riseholme for the day of her garden-party, and that  Georgie, knowing it and having gone to see her, had not informed the  Court of that fact.    The spirit of Bolshevism, the desire to throw off all authority and act  independently, which had assailed him yesterday returned now with  redoubled force. If he had been perfectly certain that he would not be  found out, there is no doubt he would have kept it from her, and yet,  after all, what was the glory of going to see Olga Bracely (and perhaps  even entertaining her here) if all Riseholme did not turn green with  jealousy? Moreover there was every chance of being found out, for Lady  Ambermere would be at the garden party tomorrow, and she would be sure  to wonder why Lucia had not asked Olga. Then it would come out that  Lucia didn't know of that eminent presence, and Lady Ambermere would be  astonished that Georgie had not told her. Thus he would be in the  situation which his imagination was unable to face, although he had  thrown the drawing room door open in the middle of the night, and  announced that he would fire with his poker.    No; he would have to tell Lucia, when he went to read the Mozart trio  with her for the first time, and very likely she would call on Olga  Bracely herself, though nobody had asked her to, and take all the wind  out of Georgie's sails. Sickening though that would be, he could not  face the alternative, and he opened his copy of the Mozart trio with a  sigh. Lucia _did_ push and shove, and have everything her own way.  Anyhow he would _not_ tell her that Olga and her husband were  dining at The Hall tonight; he would not even tell her that her  husband's name was Shuttleworth, and Lucia might make a dreadful  mistake, and ask Mr and Mrs Bracely. That would be jam for Georgie,  and he could easily imagine himself saying to Lucia, \"My dear, I thought  you must have known that she had married Mr Shuttleworth and kept her  maiden name! How tarsome for you! They are so touchy about that sort of  thing.\"    Georgie heard the tinkle of the treble part of the Mozart trio (Lucia  always took the treble, because it had more tune in it, though she  pretended that she had not Georgie's fine touch, which made the bass  effective) as he let himself in to Shakespeare's garden a few minutes  before the appointed time. Lucia must have seen him from the window,  for the subdued noise of the piano ceased even before he had got as far  as Perdita's garden round the sundial, and she opened the door to him.  The far-away look was in her eyes, and the black undulations of hair  had encroached a little on her forehead, but, after all, others besides  Lucia had trouble with their hair, and Georgie only sympathized.    \"Georgino mio!\" she said. \"It is all being so wonderful. There seems a  new atmosphere about the house since my Guru came. Something holy and  peaceful; do you not notice it?\"    \"Delicious!\" said Georgie, inhaling the pot-pourri. \"What is he doing  now?\"    \"Meditating, and preparing for our class. I do hope dear Daisy will not  bring in discordant elements.\"    \"Oh, but that's not likely, is it?\" said Georgie. \"I thought he said  she had so much light.\"    \"Yes, he did. But now he is a little troubled about her, I think. She  did not want him to go away from her house, and she sent over here for  some silk pyjamas belonging to her husband, which he thought she had  given him. But Robert didn't think so at all. The Guru brought them  across yesterday after he had left good thoughts for her in her house.  But it was the Guides who wished him to come here; they told him so  distinctly. It would have been very wrong of me not to do as they  said.\"    She gave a great sigh.    \"Let us have an hour with Mozart,\" she said \"and repel all thought of  discord. My Guru says that music and flowers are good influences for  those who are walkers on the Way. He says that my love for both of them  which I have had all my life will help me very much.\"    For one moment the mundane world obtruded itself into the calm peace.    \"Any news in particular?\" she asked. \"I saw you drive back from the  station yesterday afternoon, for I happened to be looking out of the  window, in a little"]]]
