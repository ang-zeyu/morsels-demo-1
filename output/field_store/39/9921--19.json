The left hand being  quite independent in the tempo rubato of an adagio, they cannot at all  comprehend. With them the left hand always yields to the right. Count  Wolfeck and others, who have a passionate admiration for Becke, said  lately publicly in a concert that I beat Becke hollow. Count Wolfeck  went round the room saying, \"In my life I never heard anything like  this.\" He said to me, \"I must tell you that I never heard you play as  you did to-day, and I mean to say so to your father as soon as I go to  Salzburg.\" What do you think was the first piece after the symphony?  The concerto for three pianos. Herr Demmler took the first part, I the  second, and Herr Stein the third. I then played a solo, my last sonata  in D, for Durnitz, and afterwards my concerto in B; then again a solo  in the organ style, namely, a fugue in C minor, then all of a sudden a  splendid sonata in C major, finishing with a rondo, all extempore. What  a noise and commotion there was! Herr Stein did nothing but make faces  and grimaces of astonishment. Herr Demmler was seized with fits of  laughter, for he is a queer creature, and when anything pleases him  exceedingly, he can't help laughing heartily; indeed, on this occasion  he actually began to swear! Addio!        69.    Augsburg, Oct. 25, 1777.    The receipts of the concert were 90 florins, without deducting the  expenses. Including, therefore, the two ducats we took in the Casino  concert, we had 100 florins. The expenses of the concert did not exceed  16 florins 30 kreutzers; the room I had gratis. I believe most of the  musicians will make no charge. We have now ALTOGETHER lost about 26 or  27 florins. This is not of much moment. I am writing this on Saturday  the 25th. This morning early I received the letter with the sad news of  Frau Oberbereiterin's death. Madlle. Tonerl can now purse up her mouth,  or perhaps open it wide, and shut it again as empty as ever. As to the  baker's daughter, I have no objection to make; I foresaw all this long  ago. This was the cause of my reluctance to leave home, and finding it  so difficult to go. I hope the affair is not by this time known all over  Salzburg? I beg you, dear papa, most urgently to keep the matter quiet  as long as possible, and in the mean time to pay her father on my  account any expenses he may have incurred by her entrance into the  convent, which I will repay gladly when I return to Salzburg.    I thank you most truly, dear papa, for your good wishes on my name-day.  Do not be uneasy on my account, for I have always God before my eyes,  I acknowledge His omnipotence, I dread His wrath; but I also know His  love, His compassion and mercy towards His creatures, and that He will  never forsake His servants. When His will is done I am resigned; so I  never can fail to be happy and contented. I shall certainly also strive  to live as strictly as possible in accordance with your injunctions and  advice. Thank Herr Bullinger a thousand times for his congratulations.  I mean to write to him soon and thank him myself, but I may in the mean  time assure him that I neither know nor have any better, more sincere,  or truer friend than himself. I beg also humbly to thank Madlle.  Sallerl; pray tell her I mean to enclose some verses to show my  gratitude to her in my letter to Herr Bullinger. Thank my sister also;  she is to keep the Schuster duets, and give herself no further trouble  on the subject.      In your first letter, dear papa, you write that I lowered myself by  my conduct to that lad Langenmantl. Anything but that! I was only  straightforward, no more. I see you think he is still a boy; he is one  or two and twenty, and a married man. Can any one be considered a boy  who is married? I have never gone near him since. I left two cards  for him to-day, and excused myself for not going in, having so many  indispensable calls to make. I must now conclude, for mamma insists  absolument on going to dinner, and then to pack. To-morrow we go  straight to Wallerstein. My dear little cousin, who sends you her  regards, is anything but a prude. She dressed a la Francaise to please  me yesterday. She looked at least 5 per cent, prettier in consequence.  Now, Addio!    On the 26th of October the mother and son set off to Mannheim. The  mother writes that Wolfgang intended to write to Augsburg, \"but he will  scarcely be able to do so to-day, for he is now at the rehearsal of the  oratorio; so I must beg you to accept my humble self instead.\" Wolfgang  then adds:--        70.    Mannheim, Oct. 30, 1777.    I must beg you also to accept my insignificancy. I went to-day with Herr  Danner to M. Cannabich's [Director of the Elector's orchestra]. He was  uncommonly polite, and I played something for him on his piano, which  is a very good one. We went together to the rehearsal. I could scarcely  help laughing when I was presented to the musicians, because, though  some who knew me by renomme were very civil and courteous, the rest,  who knew nothing whatever about me, stared in such a ludicrous way,  evidently thinking that because I am little and young nothing great  or mature is to be found in me; but they shall soon find it out.  Herr Cannabich is to take me himself to-morrow to Count Savioli, the  Intendant of Music. One good thing is that the Elector's name-day is  close at hand. The oratorio they are rehearsing is Handel's, but I did  not stay to hear it, for they first rehearsed a Psalm Magnificat of the  Vice-Capellmeister here, [Abbe] Vogler, which lasted a good hour. I must  now conclude, for I have still to write to my cousin.        71.    Mannheim, Nov. 4, 1777.    I am at Cannabich's every day, and mamma went with me there to-day. He  is a very different man from what he formerly was, [FOOTNOTE: Mozart had  been at his house, when a boy, with his father.] and the whole orchestra  say the same. He is very fond of me. He has a daughter who plays the  piano very nicely, and in order to make him still more friendly towards  me I am working just now at a sonata for her, which is finished all but  the Rondo. When I had completed the first allegro and andante, I took  it to him myself and played it over; you can't think what applause this  sonata receives. There chanced to be some of the musicians there at  the moment--young Danner, Lang, who plays the French horn, and the  hautboy-player, whose name I forget, but who plays remarkably well, and  has a pleasing delicate tone [Ramm]. I made him a present of a concerto  for the hautboy; it is being copied in Cannabich's room. The man is  wild with delight. I played him the concerto to-day at Cannabich's, and  THOUGH KNOWN TO BE MINE it pleased very much. No one said that it was  NOT WELL COMPOSED, because people here don't understand these things.  They ought to apply to the Archbishop; he would soon put them on the  right scent. [FOOTNOTE: The Archbishop never was satisfied with any of  the compositions that Mozart wrote for his concerts, but invariably had  some fault to find with them.] I played all my six sonatas to-day at  Cannabich's. Herr Kapellmeister Holzbauer went with me to-day to Count  Savioli's. Cannabich was there at the time. Herr Holzbauer said to the  Count in Italian that I wished to have the honor of playing before his  Serene Highness the Elector. \"I was here fifteen years ago,\" said  I, \"but now I am older and more advanced, and I may say in music  also\"--\"Oh!\" said the Count, \"you are\"--I have no idea whom he took  me for, as Cannabich interrupted him, but I affected not to hear, and  entered into conversation with the others. Still I observed that he was  speaking of me very earnestly. The Count then said to me, \"I hear that  you play the piano very tolerably?\" I bowed.    I must now tell you about the music here. On Saturday, All-Saints' day,  I attended high mass. The orchestra is very good and numerous. On each  side ten or eleven violins, four tenors, two hautboys, two flutes, and  two clarionets, two corni, four violoncellos, four bassoons, and four  double basses, besides trumpets and kettle-drums. This should give fine  music, but I would not venture to produce one of my masses here. Why?  From their being short? No, everything is liked short. From their church  style? By no means; but solely because NOW in Mannheim, under present  circumstances, it is necessary to write chiefly for the instruments,  for nothing can possibly be conceived worse than the voices here. Six  soprani, six alti, six tenori, and six bassi, to twenty violins and  twelve bassi, are in the same proportion as 0 to 1. Is it not so,  Herr Bullinger? It proceeds from this:--The Italians are miserably  represented: they have only two musici here, and they are already old.  This race is dying out. These soprano singers, too, would prefer singing  counter-tenor; for they can no longer take the high notes. The few boys  they have are wretched. The tenor and bass just like our singers  at funerals. Vogler, who lately conducted the mass, is barren and  frivolous--a man who imagines he can do a great deal, and does very  little. The whole orchestra dislike him. To-day, Sunday, I heard a mass  of Holzbauer's, which is now twenty-six years old, but excellent. He  writes very well, and has a good church style, arranges the vocal parts  as well as the instrumental, and writes good fugues. They have two  organists here; it would be worth while to come to Mannheim on purpose  to hear them--which I had a famous opportunity of doing, as it is the  custom here for the organist to play during the whole of the Benedictus.  I heard the second organist first, and then the other. In my opinion the  second is preferable to the first; for when I heard the former, I asked,  \"Who is that playing on the organ?\" \"Our second organist.\" \"He plays  miserably.\" When the other began, I said, \"Who may that be?\" \"Our first  organist.\" \"Why, he plays more miserably still.\" I believe if"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5308"],[0,"The Paradise Mystery (#16)"],[1,"I have learnt, he has acted as their guardian ever  since they were mere children.\"    \"And--their mother?\" asked Mr. Gilwaters.    \"Said to be dead--long since,\" answered Bryce. \"And their father,  too. They know nothing. Ransford won't tell them anything. But, as you  say--I've no doubt of it myself now--they must be the children of John  Brake.\"    \"And have taken the name of their mother!\" remarked the old man.    \"Had it given to them,\" said Bryce. \"They don't know that it isn't  their real name. Of course, Ransford has given it to them! But now--the  mother?\"    \"Ah, yes, the mother!\" said Mr. Gilwaters. \"Our old governess! Dear me!\"    \"I'm going to put a question to you,\" continued Bryce, leaning nearer  and speaking in a low, confidential tone. \"You must have seen much of  the world, Mr. Gilwaters--men of your profession know the world, and  human nature, too. Call to mind all the mysterious circumstances, the  veiled hints, of that trial. Do you think--have you ever thought--that  the false friend whom the counsel referred to was--Ransford? Come, now!\"    The old clergyman lifted his hands and let them fall on his knees.    \"I do not know what to say!\" he exclaimed. \"To tell you the truth, I  have often wondered if--if that was what really did happen. There is the  fact that Brake's wife disappeared mysteriously--that Ransford made a  similar mysterious disappearance about the same time--that Brake was  obviously suffering from intense and bitter hatred when I saw him after  the trial--hatred of some person on whom he meant to be revenged--and  that his counsel hinted that he had been deceived and betrayed by  a friend. Now, to my knowledge, he and Ransford were the closest of  friends--in the old days, before Brake married our governess. And I  suppose the friendship continued--certainly Ransford acted as best man  at the wedding! But how account for that strange double disappearance?\"    Bryce had already accounted for that, in his own secret mind. And now,  having got all that he wanted out of the old clergyman, he rose to take  his leave.    \"You will regard this interview as having been of a strictly private  nature, Mr. Gilwaters?\" he said.    \"Certainly!\" responded the old man. \"But--you mentioned that you wished  to marry the daughter? Now that you know about her father's past--for I  am sure she must be John Brake's child--you won't allow that to--eh?\"    \"Not for a moment!\" answered Bryce, with a fair show of magnanimity.  \"I am not a man of that complexion, sir. No!--I only wished to clear up  certain things, you understand.\"    \"And--since she is apparently--from what you say--in ignorance of her  real father's past--what then?\" asked Mr. Gilwaters anxiously. \"Shall  you--\"    \"I shall do nothing whatever in any haste,\" replied Bryce. \"Rely upon me  to consider her feelings in everything. As you have been so kind, I will  let you know, later, how matters go.\"    This was one of Pemberton Bryce's ready inventions. He had not the least  intention of ever seeing or communicating with the late vicar of Braden  Medworth again; Mr. Gilwaters had served his purpose for the time being.  He went away from Bayswater, and, an hour later, from London, highly  satisfied. In his opinion, Mark Ransford, seventeen years before, had  taken advantage of his friend's misfortunes to run away with his wife,  and when Brake, alias Braden, had unexpectedly turned up at Wrychester,  he had added to his former wrong by the commission of a far greater one.          CHAPTER X. DIPLOMACY      Bryce went back to Wrychester firmly convinced that Mark Ransford had  killed John Braden. He reckoned things up in his own fashion. Some  years must have elapsed since Braden, or rather Brake's release. He had  probably heard, on his release, that Ransford and his, Brake's, wife had  gone abroad--in that case he would certainly follow them. He might have  lost all trace of them; he might have lost his original interest in his  first schemes of revenge; he might have begun a new life for himself in  Australia, whence he had undoubtedly come to England recently. But  he had come, at last, and he had evidently tracked Ransford to  Wrychester--why, otherwise, had he presented himself at Ransford's door  on that eventful morning which was to witness his death? Nothing, in  Bryce's opinion, could be clearer. Brake had turned up. He and Ransford  had met--most likely in the precincts of the Cathedral. Ransford, who  knew all the quiet corners of the old place, had in all probability  induced Brake to walk up into the gallery with him, had noticed the  open doorway, had thrown Brake through it. All the facts pointed to  that conclusion--it was a theory which, so far as Bryce could see, was  perfect. It ought to be enough--proved--to put Ransford in a criminal  dock. Bryce resolved it in his own mind over and over again as he sped  home to Wrychester--he pictured the police listening greedily to all  that he could tell them if he liked. There was only one factor in the  whole sum of the affair which seemed against him--the advertisement in  the Times. If Brake desired to find Ransford in order to be revenged on  him, why did he insert that advertisement, as if he were longing to meet  a cherished friend again? But Bryce gaily surmounted that obstacle--full  of shifts and subtleties himself, he was ever ready to credit others  with trading in them, and he put the advertisement down as a clever ruse  to attract, not Ransford, but some person who could give information  about Ransford. Whatever its exact meaning might have been, its  existence made no difference to Bryce's firm opinion that it was Mark  Ransford who flung John Brake down St. Wrytha's Stair and killed him. He  was as sure of that as he was certain that Braden was Brake. And he was  not going to tell the police of his discoveries--he was not going to  tell anybody. The one thing that concerned him was--how best to make  use of his knowledge with a view to bringing about a marriage between  himself and Mark Ransford's ward. He had set his mind on that for twelve  months past, and he was not a man to be baulked of his purpose. By  fair means, or foul--he himself ignored the last word and would have  substituted the term skilful for it--Pemberton Bryce meant to have Mary  Bewery.    Mary Bewery herself had no thought of Bryce in her head when, the  morning after that worthy's return to Wrychester, she set out, alone,  for the Wrychester Golf Club. It was her habit to go there almost every  day, and Bryce was well acquainted with her movements and knew precisely  where to waylay her. And empty of Bryce though her mind was, she was not  surprised when, at a lonely place on Wrychester Common, Bryce turned the  corner of a spinny and met her face to face.    Mary would have passed on with no more than a silent recognition--she  had made up her mind to have no further speech with her guardian's  dismissed assistant. But she had to pass through a wicket gate at that  point, and Bryce barred the way, with unmistakable purpose. It was plain  to the girl that he had laid in wait for her. She was not without a  temper of her own, and she suddenly let it out on the offender.    \"Do you call this manly conduct, Dr. Bryce?\" she demanded, turning an  indignant and flushed face on him. \"To waylay me here, when you know  that I don't want to have anything more to do with you. Let me through,  please--and go away!\"    But Bryce kept a hand on the little gate, and when he spoke there was  that in his voice which made the girl listen in spite of herself.    \"I'm not here on my own behalf,\" he said quickly. \"I give you my word  I won't say a thing that need offend you. It's true I waited here for  you--it's the only place in which I thought I could meet you, alone.  I want to speak to you. It's this--do you know your guardian is in  danger?\"    Bryce had the gift of plausibility--he could convince people, against  their instincts, even against their wills, that he was telling the  truth. And Mary, after a swift glance, believed him.    \"What danger?\" she asked. \"And if he is, and if you know he is--why  don't you go direct to him?\"    \"The most fatal thing in the world to do!\" exclaimed Bryce. \"You know  him--he can be nasty. That would bring matters to a crisis. And that, in  his interest, is just what mustn't happen.\"    \"I don't understand you,\" said Mary.    Bryce leaned nearer to her--across the gate.    \"You know what happened last week,\" he said in a low voice. \"The strange  death of that man--Braden.\"    \"Well?\" she asked, with a sudden look of uneasiness. \"What of it?\"    \"It's being rumoured--whispered--in the town that Dr. Ransford  had something to do with that affair,\" answered Bryce.  \"Unpleasant--unfortunate--but it's a fact.\"    \"Impossible!\" exclaimed Mary with a heightening colour. \"What could  he have to do with it? What could give rise to such  foolish--wicked--rumours?\"    \"You know as well as I do how people talk, how they will talk,\" said  Bryce. \"You can't stop them, in a place like Wrychester, where everybody  knows everybody. There's a mystery around Braden's death--it's no use  denying it. Nobody knows who he was, where he came from, why he came.  And it's being hinted--I'm only telling you what I've gathered--that  Dr. Ransford knows more than he's ever told. There are, I'm afraid,  grounds.\"    \"What grounds?\" demanded Mary. While Bryce had been speaking, in his  usual slow, careful fashion, she had been reflecting--and remembering  Ransford's evident agitation at the time of the Paradise affair--and his  relief when the inquest was over--and his sending her with flowers to  the dead man's grave and she began to experience a sense of uneasiness  and even of fear. \"What grounds can there be?\" she added. \"Dr. Ransford  didn't know that man--had never seen him!\"    \"That's not certain,\" replied Bryce. \"It's said--remember, I'm only  repeating things--it's said that"]]]
