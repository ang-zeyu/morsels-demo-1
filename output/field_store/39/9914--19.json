Asanga also proved (in  Mahayanalankara-sutra-castra) with little success that Mahayanism was  the Buddha's direct teachings.  Some may quote  Bodhisattva-garbhastha-sutra in favour of the Mahayana; but it is of  no avail, as the sutra itself is the work of a later date.    (3) Although almost all of the Mahayana sutras, excepting  Avatamsaka-sutra, treat of Hinayanism as the imperfect doctrine  taught in the first part of the Master's career, yet not merely the  whole life of Gotama, but also events which occurred after his death  are narrated in the Hinayana sutras.  This shows that the Mahayana  sutras were composed after the establishment of early Buddhism.    (4) The narratives given in the Hinayana sutras in reference to  Shakya Muni seem to be based on historical facts, but those in the  Mahayana books are full of wonders and extravagant miracles far from  facts.    (5) The Hinayana sutras retain the traces of their having been  classified and compiled as we see in Ekottaragama, while Mahayana  books appear to have been composed one after another by different  authors at different times, because each of them strives to excel  others, declaring itself to be the sutra of the highest doctrine, as  we see in Saddharma-pundarika, Samdhinirmocana,  Suvarnaprabhasottamaraja, etc.    (6) The dialogues in the Hinayana sutras are in general those between  the Buddha and his disciples, while in the Mahayana books imaginary  beings called Bodhisattvas take the place of disciples.  Moreover, in  some books no monks are mentioned.    (7) Most of the Mahayana sutras declare that they themselves possess  those mystic powers that protect the reader or the owner from such  evils as epidemic, famine, war, etc.; but the Hinayana sutras are  pure from such beliefs.    (8) The Mahayana sutras extol not only the merits of the reading, but  the copying of the sutras.  This unfailingly shows the fact that they  were not handed down by memory, as the Hinayana sutras, but written  by their respective authors.    (9) The Hinayana sutras were written with a plain style in Pali,  while the Mahayana books, with brilliant phraseology, in Sanskrit.    (10) The Buddha in the Hinayana sutras is little more than a human  being, while Buddha or Tathagata in the Mahayana is a superhuman  being or Great Deity.    (11) The moral precepts of the Hinayana were laid down by the Master  every time when his disciples acted indecently, while those of the  Mahayana books were spoken all at once by Tathagata.    (12) Some Mahayana sutras appear to be the exaggeration or  modification of what was stated in the Hinayana books, as we see in  Mahaparinirvana-sutra.    (13) If we take both the Hinayana and the Mahayana as spoken by one  and the same person, we cannot understand why there are so many  contradictory statements, as we see in the following:    (a) Historical Contradictions.--For instance, Hinayana sutras are  held to be the first sermon of the Buddha by the author of  Saddharma-pundarika, while Avatamsaka declares itself to be the first  sermon.  Nagarjuna holds that Prajnya sutras are the first.    (b) Contradictions as to the Person of the Master.--For instance,  Agamas say the Buddha's body was marked with thirty-two  peculiarities, while the Mahayana books enumerate ninety-seven  peculiarities, or even innumerable marks.    (c) Doctrinal Contradictions.--For instance, the Hinayana sutras put  forth the pessimistic, nihilistic view of life, while the Mahayana  books, as a rule, express the optimistic, idealistic view.    (14) The Hinayana sutras say nothing of the Mahayana books, while the  latter always compare their doctrine with that of the former, and  speak of it in contempt.  It is clear that the name 'Hinayana' was  coined by the Mahayanists, as there is no sutra which calls itself  'Hinayana.'  It is therefore evident that when the Hinayana books  took the present shape there appeared no Mahayana sutras.    (15) The authors of the Mahayana sutras should have expected the  opposition of the Hinayanists, because they say not seldom that there  might be some who would not believe in and oppose Mahayanism as not  being the Buddha's teaching, but that of the Evil One.  They say also  that one who would venture to say the Mahayana books are fictitious  should fall into Hell.  For example, the author of  Mahaparinirvana-sutra says: \"Wicked Bhiksus would say all Vaipulya  Mahayana sutras are not spoken by the Buddha, but by the Evil One.\"    (16) There are evidences showing that the Mahayana doctrine was  developed out of the Hinayana one.    (a) The Mahayanists' grand conception of Tathagata is the natural  development of that of those progressive Hinayanists who belonged to  the Mahasamghika School, which was formed some one hundred years  after the Master.  These Hinayanists maintained that the Buddha had  infinite power, endless life, and limitlessly great body.  The author  of Mahaparinirvana-sutra also says that Buddha is immortal, his  Dharma-kaya is infinite and eternal.  The authors of  Mahayana-mulagata-hrdayabhumi-dhyana-sutra and of  Suvarnaprabha-sottamaraja-sutra enumerate the Three Bodies of Buddha,  while the writer of Lankavatara-sutra describes the Four Bodies, and  that of Avatamsaka-sutra the Ten Bodies of Tathagata.    (b) According to the Hinayana sutras, there are only four stages of  saintship, but the Mahasamghika School increases the number and gives  ten steps.  Some Mahayana sutras also enumerate the ten stages of  Bodhisattva, while others give forty-one or fifty two stages.    (c) The Himayana sutras name six past Buddhas and one future Buddha  Maitreya, while the Mahayana sutras name thirty-five, fifty-three, or  three thousand Buddhas.    (d) The Hinayana sutras give the names of six Vijnyanas, while the  Mahayana books seven, eight, or nine Vijnyanas.    (17) For a few centuries after the Buddha we hear only of Hinayanism,  but not of Mahayanism, there being no Mahayana teacher.    (18) In some Mahayana sutras (Mahavairocanabhisambodhi-sutra, for  example) Tathagata Vairocana takes the place of Gotama, and nothing  is said of the latter.    (19) The contents of the Mahayana sutras often prove that they were,  composed, or rewritten, or some additions were made, long after the  Buddha.  For instance, Mahamaya-sutra says that Acvaghosa would  refute heretical doctrines 600 years after the Master, and Nagarjuna  would advocate the Dharma 700 years after Gotama, while  Lankavatara-sutra prophesies that Nagarjuna would appear in South  India.    (20) The author of San-ron-gen-gi tells us Mahadeva, a leader of the  Mahasamghika School, used Mahayana sutras, together with the orthodox  Tripitaka 116 after the Buddha.  It is, however, doubtful that they  existed at so early a date.    (21) Mahaprajnyaparamita-castra, ascribed to Nagarjuna, refers to  many Mahayana books, which include Saddharma-pundarika,  Vimalakirtti-nirdeca, Sukhavati-vyuha, Mahaprajnyaparamita,  Pratyutpanna-buddhasammukhavasthita-samadhi, etc.  He quotes in his  Dacabhumivibhasa-castra, Mahaparinirvana, Dacabhumi, etc.    (22) Sthiramati, whose date is said to be earlier than Nagarjuna and  later than Acvaghosa, tries to prove that Mahayanism was directly  taught by the Master in his Mahayanavataraka-castra.  And  Mahayanottaratantra-castra, which is ascribed by some scholars to  him, refers to Avatamsaka, Vajracchedikka-prajnyaparamita,  Saddharmapundarika, Crimala-devi-simhananda, etc.    (23) Chi-leu-cia-chin, who came to China in A.D. 147 or A.D. 164,  translated some part of Mahayana books known as Maharatnakuta-sutra  and Mahavaipulya-mahasannipata-sutra.    (24) An-shi-kao, who came to China in A.D. 148, translated such  Mahayana books as Sukhavati-vyaha, Candra-dipa-samadhi, etc.    (25) Matanga, who came to China in A.D. 67, is said by his biographer  to have been informed of both Mahayanism and Hinayanism to have given  interpretations to a noted Mahayana book, entitled Suvarnaprabhasa.    (26) Sandhinirmocana-sutra is supposed to be a work of Asanga not  without reason, because Asanga's doctrine is identical with that of  the sutra, and the sutra itself is contained in the latter part of  Yogacaryabhumi-castra.  The author divides the whole preachings of  the Master into the three periods that he might place the Idealistic  doctrine in the highest rank of the Mahayana schools.    (27) We have every reason to believe that Mahayana sutras began to  appear (perhaps Prajnya sutras being the first) early in the first  century A.D., that most of the important books appeared before  Nagarjuna, and that some of Mantra sutras were composed so late as  the time of Vajrabodhi, who came to China in A.D. 719.      To say nothing of the strong opposition raised by the Japanese  scholars,[FN#120] such an assumption can be met with an assumption of  entirely opposite nature, and the difficulties can never be overcome.   For Zen masters, therefore, these assumptions and reasonings are  mere quibbles unworthy of their attention.      [FN#120]  The foremost of them was Chuki Tominaga (1744), of whose  life little is known.  He is said to have been a nameless merchant at  Osaka.  His Shutsu-jo-ko-go is the first great work of higher  criticism on the Buddhist Scriptures.      To believe blindly in the Scriptures is one thing, and to be pious is  another.  How often the childish views of Creation and of God in the  Scriptures concealed the light of scientific truths; how often the  blind believers of them fettered the progress of civilization; how  often religious men prevented us from the realizing of a new truth,  simply because it is against the ancient folk-lore in the Bible.  Nothing is more absurd than the constant dread in which religious  men, declaring to worship God in truth and in spirit, are kept at the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/518"],[0,"The Enchanted Island of Yew (#16)"],[1,"hem, and the ancient pair of Ki danced a double-shuffle for their  amusement that nearly convulsed them with laughter.  For one danced  exactly like the other, and the old men's legs were still very nimble,  although their wrinkled faces remained anxiously grave throughout their  antics.  Nerle also sang a song about the King of Thieves whom Prince  Marvel had conquered, and another about the Red Rogue of Dawna, so that  altogether the evening passed pleasantly enough, and they managed to  forget all their uneasy doubts of the morrow.    When at last they separated for the night, Prince Marvel alone did not  seek his bed; there was still some business he wished to transact.  So  he shut himself up in his room and summoned before him, by means of his  fairy knowledge, the Prince of the Knooks, the King of the Ryls and the  Governor of the Goblins.  These were all three his especial friends,  and he soon told them the story of the quarrel and separation of the  twin High Ki, and claimed their assistance.  Then he told them how they  might aid him, and afterward dismissed them.  Having thus accomplished  his task, the fairy prince went to bed and slept peacefully the  remainder of the night.    The next morning the blond Ki-Ki and all the army of Twi, which had  been won to their cause, came climbing up the silver steps and over the  wall to the palace of the green High Ki; but what was their amazement  to find the twin palaces separated by a wall so high that no ladders  nor steps they possessed could reach to the top!  It had been built in  a single night, and only Prince Marvel and his fairy friends knew how  the work had been done so quickly.    The yellow High Ki, coming downstairs to breakfast with her friends,  found herself securely shut in from her enemies, and the bald-headed  old Ki were so pleased to escape that they danced another jig from pure  joy.    Over the wall could be heard the shouts and threats of the army of Twi,  who were seeking a way to get at the fugitives; but for the present our  friends knew themselves to be perfectly safe, and they could afford to  laugh at the fury of the entire population of Twi.        18.  The Rescue of the High Ki    After several days of siege Prince Marvel began to feel less confident  of the safety of his little party.  The frantic Ki-Ki had built double  battering-rams and were trying to batter down the high wall; and they  had built several pairs of long ladders with which to climb over the  wall; and their soldiers were digging two tunnels in the ground in  order to crawl under the wall.    Not at once could they succeed, for the wall was strong and it would  take long to batter it down; and Nerle stood on top of the wall and  kicked over the ladders as fast as the soldiers of Twi set them up; and  the gray-bearded Ki stood in the garden holding two big flat boards  with which to whack the heads of any who might come through the tunnels.    But Prince Marvel realized that the perseverance of his foes might win  in the end, unless he took measures to defeat them effectually.  So he  summoned swift messengers from among the Sound Elves, who are  accustomed to travel quickly, and they carried messages from him to  Wul-Takim, the King of the Reformed Thieves, and to King Terribus of  Spor, who had both promised him their assistance in case he needed it.  The prince did not tell his friends of this action, but after the  messengers had been dispatched he felt easier in his mind.    The little High Ki remained as sweet and brave and lovable as ever,  striving constantly to cheer and encourage her little band of  defenders.  But none of them was very much worried, and Nerle confided  to the maiden in yellow the fact that he expected to suffer quite  agreeably when the Ki-Ki at last got him in their clutches.    Finally a day came when two big holes were battered through the wall,  and then the twin soldiers of Twi poured through the holes and began to  pound on the doors of the palace itself, in which Prince Marvel and  Nerle, the Ki and the yellow High Ki had locked themselves as securely  as possible.    The prince now decided it was high time for his friends to come to  their rescue; but they did not appear, and before long the doors of the  palace gave way and the soldiers rushed upon them in a vast throng.    Nerle wanted to fight, and to slay as many of the Twi people as  possible; but the prince would not let him.    \"These poor soldiers are but doing what they consider their duty,\" he  said, \"and it would be cruel to cut them down with our swords.  Have  patience, I pray you.  Our triumph will come in good time.\"    The Ki-Ki, who came into the palace accompanied by the green High Ki,  ordered the twin soldiers to bind all the prisoners with cords.  So one  pair of soldiers bound the Ki and another pair Nerle and the prince,  using exactly the same motions in the operation.  But when it came to  binding the yellow High Ki the scene was very funny.  For twin soldiers  tried to do the binding, and there was only one to bind; so that one  soldier went through the same motions as his twin on empty air, and  when his other half had firmly bound the girl, his own rope fell  harmless to the ground.  But it seemed impossible for one of the twins  to do anything different from the other, so that was the only way the  act could be accomplished.    Then the green-robed High Ki walked up to the one in yellow and laughed  in her face, saying:    \"You now see which of us is the most powerful, and therefore the most  worthy to rule.  Had you remained faithful to our handsome Ki-Ki, as I  did, you would not now be defeated and disgraced.\"    \"There is no disgrace in losing one battle,\" returned the other girl,  proudly.  \"You are mistaken if you think you have conquered me, and you  are wrong to insult one who is, for the time being, your captive.\"    The maiden in green looked for an instant confused and ashamed; then  she tossed her pretty head and walked away.    They led all the prisoners out into the garden and then through the  broken wall, and up and down the silver steps, into the great square of  the cities of Twi.  And here all the population crowded around them,  for this was the first time any of them had seen their High Ki, or even  known that they were girls; and the news of their quarrel and  separation had aroused a great deal of excitement.    \"Let the executioners come forward!\" cried the Ki-Ki, gleefully, and in  answer to the command the twin executioners stepped up to the prisoners.    They were big men, these executioners, each having a squint in one eye  and a scar on the left cheek.  They polished their axes a moment on  their coat-sleeves, and then said to Prince Marvel and Nerle, who were  to be the first victims:    \"Don't dodge, please, or our axes may not strike the right place.  And  do not be afraid, for the blows will only hurt you an instant.  In the  Land of Twi it is usually considered a pleasure to be executed by us,  we are so exceedingly skillful.\"    \"I can well believe that,\" replied Nerle, although his teeth were  chattering.    But at this instant a loud shout was heard, and the twin people of Twi  all turned their heads to find themselves surrounded by throngs of  fierce enemies.    Prince Marvel smiled, for he saw among the new-comers the giants and  dwarfs and the stern Gray Men of King Terribus, with their monarch  calmly directing their movements; and on the other side of the circle  were the jolly faces and bushy whiskers of the fifty-nine reformed  thieves, with burly Wul-Takim at their head.        19.  The Reunion of the High Ki    The twins of Twi were too startled and amazed to offer to fight with  the odd people surrounding them.  Even the executioners allowed their  axes to fall harmlessly to the ground, and the double people, soldiers  and citizens alike, turned to stare at the strangers in wonder.    \"We're here, Prince!\" yelled Wul-Takim, his bristly beard showing over  the heads of those who stood between.    \"Thank you,\" answered Prince Marvel.    \"And the men of Spor are here!\" added King Terribus, who was mounted on  a fine milk-white charger, richly caparisoned.    \"I thank the men of Spor,\" returned Prince Marvel, graciously.    \"Shall we cut your foes into small pieces, or would you prefer to hang  them?\" questioned the King of the Reformed Thieves, loudly enough to  set most of his hearers shivering.    But now the little maid in yellow stepped up to Prince Marvel and,  regarding the youthful knight with considerable awe, said sweetly:    \"I beg you will pardon my people and spare them.  They are usually good  and loyal subjects, and if they fought against me--their lawful High  Ki--it was only because they were misled by my separation from my other  half.\"    \"That is true,\" replied the prince; \"and as you are still the lawful  High Ki of Twi, I will leave you to deal with your own people as you  see fit.  For those who have conquered your people are but your own  allies, and are still under your orders, as I am myself.\"    Hearing this, the green High Ki walked up to her twin High Ki and said,  boldly:    \"I am your prisoner.  It is now your turn.  Do with me as you will.\"    \"I forgive you,\" replied her sister, in kindly tones.    Then the little maid who had met with defeat gave a sob and turned away  weeping, for she had expected anything but forgiveness.    And now the Ki-Ki came forward and, bowing their handsome blond heads  before the High Ki, demanded: \"Are we forgiven also?\"    \"Yes,\" said the girl, \"but you are no longer fit to be rulers of my  people.  Therefore, you are henceforth deprived of your honorable  offices of Ki-Ki, which I shall now bestow upon these good captains  here,\" and she indicated the good-natured officers who had first  captured the prince and Nerle.    The people of Twi eagerly applauded this act, for the captains were  more popular with them than the former Ki-Ki;"]]]
