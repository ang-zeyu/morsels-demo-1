The doctrine of baptism for the dead had been made known to the Saints  some time previous to this, and the ordinance had been performed in the  Mississippi and other convenient places; but this is an ordinance of  God's house, and cannot be acceptable to Him when performed elsewhere,  only in the days of the poverty of His people. And as more prosperous  times had dawned upon The Church, the Saints were required to build a  temple to the name of the Most High; and they were further told that  they were granted sufficient time to build a temple, and if they failed  to build it at the expiration of that appointed time, they should be  rejected as a Church together with their dead. To show to The Church  the importance of erecting this temple, the Lord reminded them how He  had commanded Moses to build a tabernacle, that the children of Israel  could bear with them into the wilderness, that those ordinances might  be revealed which had been hidden from before the foundation of the  world. Therefore said the Lord--        Let this house be built unto my name that I may reveal mine      ordinances therein, unto my people. For I design to reveal unto my      Church things which have been kept hid from before the foundation      of the world, things that pertain to the dispensation of the      fullness of times; and I will show unto my servant Joseph all      things pertaining to this house, and the Priesthood thereof. * *      * And ye shall build it on the place where you have contemplated      building it, for that is the spot which I have chosen for you to      build it.    The location which the Saints had contemplated as the site for the  temple was on a bold eminence overlooking the river, the landscape on  the Iowa side, and all the surrounding country for miles around. It was  not only by far the noblest site in Nauvoo for a temple, but ideal in  its fitness.    Footnotes    1. Doctrine and Covenants, Section 124.        CHAPTER XVII.    THE CONFERENCE OF APRIL 6TH, 1841.    THE sixth of April, 1841, was a memorable day in the history of Nauvoo.  That day the corner stones of the great temple which God by revelation  had commanded His people to build were to be laid. To the Prophet  Joseph the day must have been a veritable gleam of sunshine amid the  constantly renewing storms of his eventful career. It was a beautiful  day, clear and balmy--propitious for the exercises to take place.    Early in the morning there was a hurrying to and fro in the streets  of militiamen, for the presence of sixteen uniformed companies of  the Nauvoo Legion was to add brightness and interest to the imposing  ceremonies. A great procession was formed and marched to the temple  site. Here the Legion was formed in a hollow square surrounding the  excavations made for the foundation of the temple and enclosing the  officers of the Legion, choir, citizens and prominent Elders of The  Church who were to lay the corner stones of that structure. Sidney  Rigdon was the orator of the occasion; and, doubtless owing to the  recent admonition he had received in the revelation from the Lord--to  which reference has been made--he was aroused from his lethargy for the  time. At any rate, on this occasion he spoke with his old fervor and  eloquence. He reviewed the trials of the past, the blessings they then  enjoyed, the brightening prospects of the future, and dwelt at some  length upon the importance of building temples, and the labor to be  performed in them.    At the conclusion of the oration, at the direction of the First  Presidency, the architects lowered the southeast cornerstone to its  place, and Joseph Smith said:        This principal corner-stone in representation of the First      Presidency, is now duly laid in honor of the great God; and may it      there remain until the whole fabric is completed; and may the same      be accomplished speedily; that the Saints may have a place in which      to worship God, and the Son of Man have where to lay His head.    To which Sidney Rigdon added:        May the persons employed in the erection of this house be preserved      from all harm while engaged in its construction, till the whole is      completed, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the      Holy Ghost. Even so, amen.    Thus were laid the corner-stones of the Nauvoo Temple, amid the  rejoicing of the Saints; and even strangers forgot their prejudices  and joined with hearty good will, as interested spectators of the  proceedings. \"Such an almost countless multitude of people,\" says one  enthusiastic account of the scenes of the day, written at the time,  \"moving in harmony, in friendship, in dignity, told with a voice not  easily misunderstood, that they were a people of intelligence, and  virtue, and order; in short, that they were Saints; and that the God of  love, purity and light, was their God, their exemplar and director; and  that they were blessed and happy.\"    While on this subject, I quote the instructions on temple building from  the history of the Prophet:        If the strict order of the Priesthood were carried out in the      building of temples, the first stone will be laid at the southeast      corner, by the First Presidency of The Church. The southwest corner      should be laid next. The third, or northwest corner next; and the      fourth or northeast corner the last.        The First Presidency should lay the southeast corner-stone, and      dictate who are the proper persons to lay the other corner-stones.        If a temple is built at a distance, and the First Presidency are      not present, then the quorum of the Twelve Apostles are the proper      persons to dictate the order for that temple; and in the absence      of the Twelve Apostles, then the presidency of the stake will lay      the southeast corner-stone. The Melchisedek Priesthood laying      the corner-stones on the east side of the temple, and the Lesser      Priesthood those on the west side.    During the remaining days of the conference, opened with such splendid  ceremonies, the Saints were instructed in principle and doctrine, the  quorums of the Priesthood were arranged in their proper order and  the important questions of business put to each quorum separately  and voted upon; especially the names of those whom God had appointed  and reappointed to fill the respective positions alluded to in the  revelation above quoted.    Besides this, the several charters of Nauvoo, the Legion, University,  Agricultural and Manufacturing Association, Nauvoo House Association,  etc., were read and accepted by the people. Lyman Wight was sustained  to fill the vacancy in the quorum of the Twelve. John C. Bennett  was presented in connection with the First Presidency as assistant  President until Sidney Rigdon's health should be restored. Everything  necessary for the welfare, happiness and prosperity of the Saints was  considered, and preparations made to push the work of God forward in  all its departments. The conference lasted from Wednesday morning until  Sunday night; and is one of the most important ever held by The Church.    Indeed the circumstances surrounding the Saints at the time were of  a character to bid them hope that Nauvoo would be to them \"a safe  retreat.\" The friendship of nearly all of the leading men of the State;  the universal sympathy felt by the people of Illinois for the victims  of Missouri's fury; the action of the State legislature in granting  the several charters noted in chapter fifteen--all supported the hopes  entertained.        CHAPTER XVIII.    PROPHET'S TRIAL AT MONMOUTH.    EARLY in the summer of 1841, an event happened which threatened  the peace of the inhabitants of Nauvoo. When busily intent in the  performance of some labor, or duty, or even when in pursuit of  pleasure, how often it happens that we work on, or enjoy our pleasure  in the bright sunshine, without ever thinking of storms, until a  sudden clap of thunder startles us, and looking up we see that dark  clouds have arisen above the horizon; the bright skies are rapidly  becoming overcast--a storm is impending! So it was with the Saints at  Nauvoo concerning the matter of which we speak. It fell upon them as  unexpectedly as falls a thunderbolt from a cloudless sky.    It occurred in this manner: When Hyrum Smith and William Law started  on the mission to the Eastern States, to which they were appointed by  the revelation of January 19, 1841, Joseph accompanied them as far as  Quincy; and when returning to Nauvoo he stopped at Heberlin's hotel,  on Bear Creek, some twenty-eight miles south of that city. While here  a sheriff's posse under the direction of Thomas King, sheriff of Adams  County, accompanied by an officer from Missouri, arrested him on a  requisition from the governor of the State of Missouri. The warrant  upon which the arrest was made was the one issued by the authorities of  Missouri early in September, 1840; an effort to serve which was made on  the fifteenth of that month, but the officers failed in their errand,  as the brethren wanted, viz: Joseph Smith, Jr., Sidney Rigdon, Lyman  Wight, P. P. Pratt, Caleb Baldwin and A. Brown were not in Nauvoo, that  is, they evaded arrest, as already related in a former chapter.    The complaint on which the requisition of the governor of Illinois was  based charged that these men were fugitives from justice; and they  were wanted in Missouri to answer to the old charges of \"theft, arson  and murder,\" supposed to have been committed in Caldwell and Daviess  counties in the summer and fall of 1838.    What made Joseph's"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50357"],[0,"Origin of the 'Reorganized' Church and the Question of Succession (#16)"],[1," with equal emphasis  that in the seed of Hyrum Smith, as well as in the seed of Joseph  Smith, all generations after him shall be blessed. For the Lord hath  spoken it! Now, the seed of Hyrum Smith are not connected with the  \"Reorganization.\" However, in the words of another let me say:        \"That the descendants of Joseph Smith, and those of Hyrum Smith,      stand before God as do all other men, assured of honor or dishonor,      exaltation or degradation, according to their individual works.\"    We are also referred to verses 56-58 of section 124, which, perhaps, is  a passage on which they lay the greatest stress of all. I shall read  beginning with the fifty-sixth verse, and ask you to follow me closely  and I will read it as clearly as I possibly can:        \"And now I say unto you, as pertaining to my boarding house which I      have commanded you to build for the boarding of strangers, let it      be built unto my name, and let my name be named upon it, and let my      servant Joseph, and his house have place therein, from generation      to generation;        \"For this anointing have I put upon his head, that his blessing      shall also be put upon the head of his posterity after him.        \"And as I said unto Abraham concerning the kindreds of the earth,      even so I say unto my servant Joseph, in thee and in thy seed shall      the kindred of the earth be blessed.\"    You see it says, \"this anointing have I put upon his head.\" What  anointing does this refer to? Notice that it says, \"as pertaining to  my boarding house * * let my servant Joseph, and his house have place  therein, from generation to generation.\" That is the anointing the  term \"this\" refers to. It is the place in that boarding house, and has  nothing to do with the Presidency of the Church. I have already shown  to you that in the seed of Hyrum Smith as well as in the seed of Joseph  Smith the generations after them were to be blessed; there is nothing  in this promise indicating that the posterity of either of them shall  have right to the Presidency of the Church.    But they say this blessing does not refer to the boarding house in  which the Prophet Joseph paid stock for himself and generations after  him; but that it refers to the blessing of his progenitors; that  is, to the birthright which was given to Joseph--the right of the  primogeniture. And considering this passage Heman C. Smith, in his  \"True Succession,\" has the following to say:        \"Here then is the blessing given to Joseph to occupy in this      position, and to discharge these duties and responsibilities. But      some one objects that this is not called a 'blessing;' but is it      not a blessing? However, to silence this caviling, we refer the      reader to the blessing of Joseph Smith as pronounced by his father      on the occasion of the ordination of the High Council. February 19,      1834, Joseph in his history says:        \"'My father Joseph then laid his hands upon my head and said,      \"Joseph, I lay my hands upon thy head and pronounce the blessings      of thy progenitors upon thee, that thou mayest hold the keys of the      mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, until the coming of the Lord.      Amen.'\" (True Succession, p. 44).    Then he goes on to say that this is the blessing referred to in the  revelation I have just quoted from, and that it was the blessing of the  primogeniture. The birthright of the first born. But Mr. Heman C. Smith  is too hasty. Invariably in quoting this blessing given to the Prophet  by his father and which is found in the Times and Seasons, volume 6,  pages 994-5, they tactfully refrain from quoting what immediately  follows. I will quote it from the Times and Seasons:        \"He also laid his hands upon the head of his son Samuel and said,      'Samuel, I lay my hands upon thy head, and pronounce the blessing      of thy progenitors upon thee, that thou mayest remain a Priest of      the Most High God, and like Samuel of old, hear His voice, saying,      Samuel, Samuel. Amen.'        \"John Johnson also, laid his hands upon the head of his son Luke      and said, 'My Father in heaven, I ask thee to bless this my son,      according to the blessings of his forefathers, that he may be      strengthened in his ministry, according to his holy calling. Amen.'\"    This proves to us that the blessing of the progenitors was not  necessarily the blessing of the first born; nor was it the right to  the Presidency of the Church; for Samuel received a blessing similar  to that of his brother Joseph, and neither of them received the  birthright in these blessings. I shall now show you that it was Hyrum  Smith who received the blessing of the first born--the birthright--and  it was not the Presidency of the Church either, for they are not the  same. However, before I show this I want to read a paragraph from the  history published by the \"Reorganized\" Church. This is volume 2, and  is \"written and compiled\" by Joseph Smith and his assistant, Heman C.  Smith, their historian. On pages 462-3 they give the dying blessings  pronounced by Patriarch Joseph Smith on the heads of his children. They  introduce this account in the following words:        \"In connection with the fact that Joseph's and William's children      are identified with the Reorganization, while Hyrum's and Samuel's      are in Utah, it is interesting to note that the children of the two      former were to be blessed after them, while the children of the two      latter are not mentioned.        \"The account of this deathbed scene and the blessings, as given by      Lucy Smith, the mother of the Prophet and widow of the Patriarch,      is as follows:\"    Here is the blessing of Hyrum Smith:        \"My son Hyrum, I seal upon your head your patriarchal blessing,      which I placed upon your head before, for that shall be verified.      In addition to this, I now give you my dying blessing, You shall      have a season of peace, so that you shall have sufficient rest to      accomplish the work which God has given you to do. You shall be      as firm as the pillars of heaven unto the end of your days. I NOW      SEAL UPON YOUR HEAD THE PATRIARCHAL POWER, and you shall bless the      people. This is my dying blessing upon your head in the name of      Jesus. Amen.\"    There is the birthright!    And now Joseph's blessing:        \"Joseph, my son, you are called to a high and holy calling. You      are even called to do the work of the Lord. Hold out faithful and      you shall be blessed and your children after you. You shall even      live to finish your work. At this Joseph cried out, weeping, 'Oh!      my father, shall I?' 'Yes,' said his father, 'you shall live to      lay out the plan of all the work which God has given you to do.      This is my dying blessing on your head, in the name of Jesus. I      also confirm your former blessing upon your head; for it shall be      fulfilled. Even so. Amen.\"    On first thought it is a little strange that the children of Joseph  the Prophet are to be blessed after him, while that promise is not  in the blessing of Hyrum Smith. However, let us examine the blessing  given to Hyrum Smith a little more closely. The first sentence reads:  \"My son Hyrum, I seal upon your head your patriarchal blessing, which  I placed upon your head before, _for that shall be verified_. And what  followed was in addition to that former blessing so there was no need  of repeating what that former blessing contained; but it was to be  verified. I have before me that former blessing. This is a patriarchal  blessing given by Patriarch Joseph Smith on the head of his son Hyrum,  December 9, 1834, in Kirtland, Ohio, and is recorded in Patriarch  Joseph Smith's book of blessings on pages 1 and 2, and is in the  handwriting of Oliver Cowdery. Here is a portion of it:        \"Hyrum, thou art my oldest son whom the Lord has spared unto me.      * * * * Behold thou art Hyrum, the Lord hath called thee by that      name, and by that name He has blessed thee. Thou hast borne the      burden and the heat of the day, thou hast toiled hard and labored      much for the good of thy father's family; thou hast been a stay      many times to them, and by thy diligence they have often been      sustained. Thou hast loved thy father's family with a pure love,      and hast greatly desired their salvation. Thou hast always stood by      thy father, and reached forth the helping hand to lift him up when      he was in affliction, and though he has been out of the way, thou      hast never forsaken him nor laughed him to scorn; for all these      kindnesses the Lord my God will bless thee.\"    I promised that I would prove to you that when the Patriarch blessed  Joseph, his son, with the blessing of his progenitors, that it was not  the birthright, but that that blessing was reserved for Hyrum. Here is  the proof, or at least a portion of it. The blessing continues:        \"I now ask my Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ, to      BLESS THEE with the SAME BLESSING with which Jacob blessed his son      Joseph, for thou art his true descendant, and thy posterity shall      be numbered with the house of Ephraim, and with them thou shalt      stand up to crown the tribes of Israel; when they come shouting to      Zion. * * * *        \"The Lord will multiply his choice blessings upon thee and thy      seed after thee and thou with them shall have an inheritance in      Zion, and they shall possess it from generation to generation, and      thy name shall never be blotted out from among the just, for the      righteous shall rise up, and also thy children after thee, and say      thy memory is just, that thou wert a just man and perfect in thy      day.\"    We see that Hyrum was blessed with the blessing of Joseph, and we learn  from the fifth chapter of I Chronicles that through the transgression  of Reuben, Joseph received the birthright, and he got it"]]]
