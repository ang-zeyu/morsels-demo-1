[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39205"],[0,"Sheep, Swine, and Poultry (#16)"],[1,"the most solid and best conducted institutions of  the country were shaken by the fury of the explosion. Wool suddenly fell  almost fifty per cent. The grower began to be discouraged. The breeder  of the delicate Saxons--and they comprised the flocks of nearly all the  large wool-growers in the country, at that time--could not obtain for  his wool its actual first cost per pound.    When the Saxon growers found that the tariff of 1842 brought them no  relief, they began to give up their costly and carefully nursed flocks.  The example once set, it became contagious; and then was a period when  it seemed as if all the Saxon sheep of the country would be sacrificed  to this reaction. Many abandoned wool-growing altogether, at a heavy  sacrifice of their fixtures for rearing sheep; others crossed with  coarse-woolled breeds; and, rushing from one extreme to the other, some  even crossed with the English mutton breeds; or some, with more  judgment, went back to the parent Merino stock, but usually selected the  heaviest and coarsest-woolled Merinos, and thus materially deteriorated  the character of their wool. This period became distinguished by a mania  for heavy fleeces. The English crosses were, however, speedily  abandoned. The Merino regained his supremacy, lost for nearly a quarter  of a century, and again became the popular favorite. It was generally  adopted by those who were commencing flocks in the new Western States,  and gives its type to the sheep of those regions.    The supply of fine wool, then, proportionably decreased, and that of  medium and coarse increased. Wools, for convenience, may be classified  as follows: _superfine_, the choicest quality grown in the United  States, and never grown here excepting in comparatively small  quantities; _fine_, good ordinary Saxon; _good medium_, the highest  quality of wool usually known in the market as Merino; _medium_,  ordinary Merino; _ordinary_, grade Merino and selected South-Down  fleeces; and, _coarse_, the English long-wools, etc. This subdivision  is, perhaps, minute enough for all practical purposes here.    It soon became apparent that, to sustain our manufacturing  interest--that engaged in the manufacture of fine cloths--the diminution  of fine wools should not only be at once arrested, but that the growth  of them should be immediately and largely increased. An increased  attention was accordingly bestowed upon this branch of industry, and  sections of the country which had previously held aloof from  wool-growing, embarked in that calling with commendable enterprise.    The climate north of forty-one degrees, or, beyond all dispute, north  of forty-two degrees, is too severe for any variety of sheep commonly  known, which bear either superfine or fine wools. In fact, the only such  variety in any thing like general use is the Saxon; and this, as has  been remarked, is a delicate sheep, entirely incapable of safely  withstanding our northern winters, without good shelter, good and  regularly-administered food, and careful and skilful management in all  other particulars. When the season is a little more than usually  back-hand, so that grass does not start prior to the lambing season, it  is difficult to raise the lambs of the mature ewes; the young ewes will,  in many instances, disown their lambs, or, if they own them, not have a  drop of milk for them; and if, under such circumstances, as often  happens, a northeast or a northwest storm comes driving down, bearing  snow or sleet in its wings, or there is a sudden depression of the  temperature from any cause, no care will save multitudes of lambs from  perishing. If the time of having the lambs dropped is deferred, for the  purpose of escaping these evils, they will not attain size and strength  sufficient to enable them to pass safely through their first winter.  North of the latitude last named, it is necessary, as a general rule,  that they be dropped in the first half of May, to give them this  requisite size and strength; and occasional cold storms come, nearly  every season, up to that period, and, not unfrequently, up to the first  of June.    These considerations have had their weight even with the few large  sheep-holders in that section, whose farms and buildings have been  arranged with exclusive reference to the rearing of these sheep; many of  whom have adopted a Merino cross. With the ordinary farmers--the small  sheep-owners, who, in the aggregate, grow by far the largest portion of  the northern wools--the Saxon sheep is, for these reasons, in marked  disrepute. They have not the necessary fixtures for their winter  protection, and are unwilling to bestow the necessary amount of care on  them. Besides, mutton and wool being about an equal consideration with  this class, they want larger and earlier maturing breeds. Above all,  they want a strong, hardy sheep, which demands no more care than their  cattle. The strong, compact, medium-woolled Merino, or, more generally,  its crosses with coarse varieties, producing the wool classed as  ordinary, is the common favorite. In the Northwest, this is especially  the case, where the climate is still worse for delicate sheep.    At the South, on the contrary--where these disadvantages do not exist to  so great an extent, certainly--wool varying from good medium upward are  more profitable staples for cultivation than the lower classes; and in  that section a high degree of fineness in fleece has been sought in  breeding the Merino--the four-pound fine-fleeced Merino having received  marked attention. This is a far more profitable animal than the Saxon,  other things being equal--which is not the case, since the former is  every way a hardier animal and a better nurse; and, although about  twenty pounds heavier, and therefore consuming more feed, this  additional expense is more than counterbalanced by the additional care  and risk attending the husbandry of the Saxon.      POINTS OF THE MERINO.    For breeding purposes, the shape and general appearance of the Merino  should be as follows:--The head should be well carried up, and in the  ewe hornless. It would be better, on many accounts, to have the ram  also hornless, but, as horns are usually characteristic of the Merino  ram, many prefer to see them. The face should be rather short, broad  between the eyes, the nose pointed, and, in the ewe, fine and free  from wrinkles. The eye should be bright, moderately prominent, and  gentle in its expression. The neck should be straight--not curving  downward--short, round, and stout--particularly so at its junction with  the shoulder, forward of the upper point of which it should not sink  below the level of the back. The points of the shoulder should not rise  to any perceptible extent above the level of the back. The back, to  the hips, should be straight; the crops--that portion of the body  immediately back of the shoulder-blades--full; the ribs well arched; the  body large and capacious; the flank well let down; the hind-quarters  full and round--the flesh meeting well down between the thighs, or in  the \"twists.\" The bosom should be broad and full; the legs short, well  apart, and perpendicular--that is, not drawn under the body toward each  other when the sheep is standing. Viewed as a whole, the Merino should  present the appearance of a low, stout, plump, and--though differing  essentially from the English mutton-sheep model--a highly symmetrical  sheep.    The skin is an important point. It should be loose, singularly mellow,  and of a rich, delicate pink color. A colorless skin, or one of a tawny,  approaching to a butternut, hue, indicates bad breeding. On the subject  of wrinkles, there is a difference of opinion. As they are rather  characteristic of the Merino--like the black color in a Berkshire hog,  or the absence of all color in Durham cattle--these wrinkles have been  more regarded, by novices, than those points which give actual value to  the animal; and shrewd breeders have not been slow to act upon this  hint. Many have contended that more wool can be obtained from a wrinkled  skin; and this view of the case has led both the Spanish and French  breeders to cultivate them largely--the latter, to a monstrosity. An  exceedingly wrinkled neck, however, adds but little to the weight of the  fleece--not enough, in fact, to compensate for the deformity, and the  great impediment thus placed in the way of the shearer. A smoothly drawn  skin, and the absence of all dead lap, would not, on the other hand,  perhaps be desirable.    The wool should densely cover the whole body, where it can possibly  grow--from a point between and a little below the eyes, and well up on  the cheeks, to the knees and hocks. Short wool may show, particularly in  young animals, on the legs, even below the knees and hocks; but long  wool covering the legs, and on the nose, below the eyes, is unsightly,  without value; while on the face it frequently impedes the sight of the  animal, causing it to be in a state of perpetual alarm, and  disqualifying it to escape real danger. Neither is this useless wool the  slightest indication of a heavy fleece--contrary to what seems to be  thought by some. It is very often seen in Saxons shearing scarcely two  pounds of wool, and on the very lightest fleeced Merinos.    The amount of gum which the wool should exhibit is another mooted point.  Merino wool should be yolky, or oily, prior to washing--though not to  the extreme extent, occasionally witnessed, of giving it the appearance  of being saturated with grease. The extreme tips may exhibit a  sufficient trace of gum to give the fleece a darkish cast, particularly  in the ram; but a black, pitchy gum, resembling half-hardened tar,  extending an eighth or a quarter of an inch into the fleece, and which  cannot be removed by ordinary washing, is decidedly objectionable. There  is a white or yellowish concrete gum, not removable by common washing,  which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39235"],[0,"A Manual of Toy Dogs: How to breed, rear, and feed them (#16)"],[1,"doses of castor oil after shows,  or as so-called prophylactics--preventives of illness. If a dog has been  much confined at a show, and is likely to be irregular in consequence, a  little pure olive oil with his dinner (not the nut oil often sold by  grocers as olive oil) will do no harm, although a dinner of oatmeal  gruel or boiled sheep's liver would be much more sensible and act  better; if he seems well and lively, leave him alone. Some people  actually go the length of dosing their puppies with castor oil at  intervals, for no reason that I can ascertain beyond a vague idea that  it \"clears the system.\" So it does--of strength and the healthy mucoid  secretion of the intestine, without which natural functions cannot be  properly performed. Syrup of buck-thorn, or cascara sagrada, is another  medicine that should never be given to small dogs: it is far too  irritating and severe. When we have such excellent aperients as olive  oil, magnesia, and rhubarb among drugs, and boiled sheep's liver among  meats, we want no semi-poisonous irritant and violent drugs like castor  oil, which, in the end, produce the very condition they were supposed to  cure, and by pulling down the system, open the door to illness.      =Fits.=--Of these, epileptic fits are the most dangerous and by far the  least common. A dog suffering from epilepsy which is thoroughly  established, is practically incurable, in the present state of canine  medical science. Later, perhaps, the Roentgen rays may be beneficially  applied to this disease in dogs, as in human beings. In a popular manual  it is scarcely necessary to go further into the subject than to say that  epilepsy need not be suspected unless the convulsive attacks are more or  less recurrent, and so frequent as to exhaust the animal. Not until we  have tried such treatment as an amateur can safely give, which is quite  enough to cure ordinary teething or suckling fits due merely to some  reflex irritation affecting the brain, and found it fail, need we fear  epilepsy; and when we do fear it with any reason, skilled advice and  diagnosis is absolutely needful, since the case must be watched and  treated on its merits.    Suckling fits are exceedingly common among small, highly-organised, and  sensitive bitches. They generally begin about the end of the second week  of nursing puppies, and do not seem to be in any way caused by  overstrain; that is, a small female suckling five puppies is not more  likely to suffer from these fits than one only bringing up a brace.  Their exact cause is difficult to determine, since very healthy,  well-fed animals may have them in common with those that are weak and  miserable from under-feeding (which in this case is synonymous with  feeding on a non-meat diet) or kennel life.    Whatever the cause, the symptoms are always easy to recognise. The bitch  first loses interest in her litter, though her milk-supply is seldom, if  ever, lessened. She twitches, and her eyes look dull and filmy, or  glassy and staring. She wanders restlessly about, and sometimes pants in  the same way as she did when expecting her confinement. Now is the time  to intervene, and give one teaspoonful of syrup of chloral with an equal  quantity of water. If this is not done, the attack will proceed to  staggering, shrieking, and more or less violent convulsions. The  administration of the chloral generally causes the symptoms to subside  gradually; but should the patient be no better in two hours, repeat the  dose, and if giving bromide of potassium in 5-gr. doses twice or three  times a day, immediately after food, does not keep her right, she must  go on taking the chloral.    Neither chloral nor bromide affects the milk; if any of it passes  therein, the quantity is so very minute as to make no difference to the  puppies. It is not at all necessary to take the bitch away from her  litter; in fact, it is better to let her go on feeding them. Some will  wish to leave their babies, and these should be taken to them and shut  in with them, four times a day, and during the night. If she is  thoroughly well fed, it never does the bitch any harm to bring up her  family, and it would be a very great pity for the puppies to be lost  when it is not necessary. But it is exceedingly important that she  should be kept in a state of hyper-nutrition--that is, that she should  have as much good, underdone meat as she can digest. Bromides are  lowering, and besides this, the state of the nerves demands the highest  possible feeding. It may be expensive to feed a \"fitty\" bitch on good  beefsteak or roast mutton four times a day, giving her a sponge cake the  last thing at night and a little milk, or, what is much better and more  digestible, a raw new-laid egg or raw fresh cream, in the early morning;  but it is, on the whole, a cheap way of saving a litter of valuable  pups. If there are a large number of pups, some may be given to a  foster-mother; but as a rule these are difficult to get, and not often  satisfactory. Bromides should always be given immediately after food; on  no account when the stomach is empty. Chloral may be given at any time  when there is a necessity for it. The 5-gr. bromide tabloids obtainable  at any chemist's are very useful; it is unnecessary to dissolve them in  water for dogs, but, as before stated, they _must_ be given with or  directly after food.    Teething fits should be treated, as far as medicine goes, exactly as  suckling fits. Just as a badly-reared, non-meat-fed bitch who, by reason  of an anaemic habit, harbours worms, is a poor subject for the latter  trouble, so is a puppy that has been brought up on milky slops and  large, wet messes of oatmeal and bread and milk, and thus has a weakened  digestion, very likely to suffer badly from fits that in a strong young  dog would pass off with small trouble. There is usually some warning of  teething fits, as staring eyes, etc.; but sometimes, and especially if a  puppy of from six to ten months has been much excited, taken out walking  on a hot day, allowed to play in the sun, or dragged unwillingly on a  lead, they come on very suddenly. While out in hot sun, the dog may  suddenly give a shriek and begin to run with all his might, taking no  notice of calls. As a general rule, he has the sense to run home, unless  some officious person on the way imagines him mad and acts as silly  people do under such circumstances.    If it is possible to catch the runaway, he should have his head covered  to keep the light out of his eyes, and be taken home as quickly and  quietly as possible to be shut in some cool and perfectly dark place  until the fit passes off sufficiently to give him a dose of chloral.  Afterwards he should have a diet of minced, underdone meat, with bromide  of potassium to follow, for a day or two. A plunge into cold water will  often stop a fit like this, but is too heroic a remedy to be safe unless  the circumstances are very urgent. Cold sponging to the head is good,  and quiet and darkness are essential. Some times teething fits go on  increasing in frequency and severity until they merge into epilepsy, and  the dog is lost. This is occasionally caused by allowing a very young,  highly nervous, and excitable dog to be with others of the opposite sex,  when these should be in seclusion.    Fits, very much like mild teething fits, are not uncommon in run-down  dogs suffering from anaemia and the likely corollary, worms. These are  often very transient, and a course of tonic treatment, with rest from  excitement, and good feeding, will banish them.          CHAPTER IX    CLUB STANDARDS, DESCRIPTIONS AND POINTS OF VARIOUS TOY BREEDS      =Pomeranians.=--These are now divided into Pomeranians (over 7 lbs.) and  Pomeranians Miniature, and the Committee of the Kennel Club have laid  down the following standard, applying from June 1, 1909:      THE POMERANIAN.--_Appearance._--The Pomeranian in build and appearance  should be a compact, short-coupled dog, well-knit in frame. His head and  face should be fox-like, with small erect ears that appear sensible to  every sound. He should exhibit great intelligence in his expression,  docility in his disposition, and activity and buoyancy in his  deportment. In weight and size the Pomeranian varies considerably. He  must be over 7 lbs., but preferably he should weigh about 10 to 14 lbs.  _Head._--The head should be somewhat foxy in outline or wedge-shaped,  the skull being flat, large in proportion to the muzzle, which should  finish rather fine, and be free from lippiness. The teeth should be  level, and on no account undershot. The hair on the head and face must  be smooth and short-coated.      THE POMERANIAN MINIATURE--_Appearance._--The Pomeranian Miniature in  build and appearance should be a compact, short-coupled dog. His head  and face should be like a miniature fox, with small, erect, and very  mobile ears, pricked and brought well together, and in no case  lop-eared. He should be full of life, intelligent in expression, and  docile in disposition. The Pomeranian Miniature should preferably weigh  about 3 to 5 lbs., but must not exceed 7 lbs. Dogs above 7 lbs. must be  registered as Pomeranians. Dogs below 7 lbs. in weight must, at twelve  months of age or after, be registered or re-registered as Pomeranians  Miniature, and being so registered or re-registered, can never compete  in classes for Pomeranians. _Head._--The head should be wedge-shaped and  rather foxy in outline, but the skull may be rounder than the  Pomeranian.
