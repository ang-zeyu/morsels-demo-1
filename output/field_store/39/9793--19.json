FIGS. 1-5, _Protamoeba_; 6-9, _Protamyxa Aurantiaca_,  Haeckel, Beit. zur Monog. der Moneren, pl. 1; 10-18, _Magosphaera planula_,  Haeckel, loc. cit. pl. 5.]    In the true _Amoebas_, on the contrary, we find a differentiation  between the exterior and the interior: the body being more or less  distinctly divisible into an outer layer and an inner parenchyme. In the  _Amoebas_, as in _Protamoeba_, multiplication takes place by  self-division, and nothing corresponding to sexual reproduction has yet  been discovered.    Somewhat more advanced, but still of great simplicity, is the _Protomyxa  aurantiaca_ (Pl. 5, Fig. 8), discovered by Haeckel[76] on dead shells of  _Spirula_, where it appears as a minute orange speck, which shows well  against the clear white of the _Spirula_. Examined with a microscope, the  speck is seen to be a spherical mass of orange-coloured, homogeneous,  albuminous matter, surrounded by a delicate, structureless membrane. It  is obvious from this description that these bodies closely resemble  eggs, for which indeed Haeckel at first mistook them. Gradually,  however, the yellow sphere broke itself up into smaller spherules (Pl.  5, Fig. 9), after which the containing membrane burst, and the separate  spherules, losing their globular form, crept out as small _Amoebae_ (Pl.  5, Fig. 6), or amoeboid bodies. These little bodies moved about,  assimilated the minute particles of organic matter, with which they came  in contact, and gradually increased in size (Pl. 5, Fig. 7) with more or  less rapidity according to the amount of nourishment they were able to  obtain. They threw out arms in various directions, and if divided each  section maintained its individual existence. After a while their  movements ceased, they contracted into a ball, and again secreted round  themselves a clear structureless envelope.    This completes their life history as observed by Haeckel, who found it  easy to retain them in his glasses in perfect health, and who watched  them closely.    As another illustration I may take the _Magosphaera planula_, discovered  by Haeckel on the coast of Norway.    In one stage of its existence (Pl. 5, Fig. 10) it is a minute mass of  gelatinous matter, which continually alters its form, moves about,  feeds, and in fact behaves altogether like the _Amoeba_ just described.  It does not, however, remain always in this condition. After a while it  contracts into a spherical form (Pl. 5, Fig. ii), and secretes round  itself a structureless envelope, which, with the nucleus, gives it a  very close resemblance to a minute egg.    Gradually the nucleus divides, and the protoplasm also separates into  two spherules (Pl. 5, Fig. 12); these two subdivide into four (Pl. 5,  Fig. 13), and so on (Pl. 5, Fig 14), until at length thirty-two are  present, compressed into a more or less polygonal form (Pl. 5, Fig. 15).  Here this process ends. The separate spherules now begin to lose their  smooth outline, to throw out processes, and to show amoeboid movements  like those of the creatures just described. The processes or pseudopods  grow gradually longer, thinner, and more pointed. Their movements become  more active, until at length they take the form of ciliae. The spherical  _Magosphaera_, the upper surface of which has thus become covered with  ciliae, now begins to rotate within the cyst or envelope, which at length  gives way and sets free the contained sphere, which then swims about  freely in the water (Pl. 5, Fig. 16), thus closely resembling _Synura_, or  one of the Volvocineae. After swimming about in this condition for a  certain time, the sphere breaks up into the separate cells of which it  is composed (Pl. 5, Fig. 17). As long as the individual cells remained  together, they had undergone no changes of form, but after separating  they show considerable contractility, and gradually alter their form,  until they become undistinguishable from true _Amoebae_ (Pl. 5, Fig. 18).  Finally, according to Haeckel, these amoeboid bodies, after living for  a certain time in this condition, return to a state of rest, again  contract into a spherical form, and secrete round themselves a  structureless envelope. The life history of some other low organisms, as  for instance _Gregarina_, is of a similar character.    It may be said, and said truly, that the difference between such beings  as these and the _Campodea_, or Tardigrade, is immense. But if it be  considered incredible that even during the long lapse of geological time  such great changes should have taken place as are implied in the belief  that there is genetic connection between them and these lower groups,  let us consider what happens under our eyes in the development of each  one of these little creatures in the proverbially short space of their  individual life.    I will take for instance the first stages, and for the sake of brevity  only the first stages, of the life-history of a Tardigrade.[77] As shown  in Fig. 60, the egg is at first a round body or cell, with a clear  central nucleus--the germinal vesicle; it increases in size, and after  a while the yolk and the germinal vesicle divide into two (Fig. 61),  then into four (Fig. 62), and so on, just as we have seen to be the case  in _Magosphaera_. From the minute cells (Fig. 63) arising through this  process of yolk-segmentation, the body of the Tardigrade is then built  up.[78]    [Illustration: FIG. 60, Egg of Tardigrade, Kaufmann, Zeit f. Wiss.  Zool. 1851, Pl. 1. 61, Egg of Tardigrade after the yolk has subdivided.  62, Egg of Tardigrade in the next stage. 63, Egg of Tardigrade more  advanced.]    Though I will not now attempt to point out the full bearing of these  facts on the study of embryology generally, yet I cannot resist calling  attention to the similarity of the development of _Magosphaera_ with the  first stages of development of other animals, because it appears to me  to possess a significance, the importance of which it would be difficult  to overestimate.    Among the Zoophytes Prof. Allman thus describes[79] the process in  _Laomedea_, as representing the Hydroids (Pl. 6, Fig. 1, represents the  young egg):--\"The first step observable in the segmentation-process is  the cleavage of the yolk into two segments (Pl. 6, Fig. 2), immediately  followed by the cleavage of these into other two, so that the vitellus  is now composed of four cleavage spheres (Pl. 6, Fig. 3).\" These spheres  again divide (Pl. 6, Fig. 4) and subdivide, thus at length forming  minute cells, of which the body of the embryo is built up.    In Pl. 6, Figs. 5-9 represent the corresponding stages in the  development of a small parasitic worm--the _Filaria mustelarum_--as  given by Van Beneden.[80] The first process is that within the egg,  which represents, so to say, the encysted condition of _Magosphaera_, the  yolk divides itself into two balls (Pl. 6, Fig. 6), then into four,  eight, and so on, the cells thus constituted finally forming the young  worm. I have myself observed the same stages in the eggs of the very  remarkable and abnormal _Sphaerularia bombi_.[81]    Among the Echinoderms M. Derbes thus describes the first stages (Pl. 6,  Figs. 10-13) in the development of the egg of an _Echinus_ (_Echinus  esculentus_):--\"Le jaune commence a se segmenter, d'abord en deux, puis  en quatre et ainsi de suite, chacune des nouvelles cellules se  partageant a son tour en deux.\"[82] Sars has observed the same thing in  the starfish.[83]    [Illustration: PLATE. 6.]    In the Rotatoria, as shown by Huxley in _Lacinularia_,[84] and by  Williamson in _Melicerta_,[85] the yolk is at first a single globular  mass, the first changes which take place in it being as follows:--\"The  central nucleus becomes drawn out and subdivides into two, this division  being followed by a corresponding segmentation of the yolk. The same  process is repeated again and again, until at length the entire yolk is  converted into a mass of minute cells.\" Among the Crustacea the total  segmentation of the yolk occurs among the Copepoda, Rhizocephala, and  Cirripedia. Sars has described the same process in one of the  nudibranchiate mollusca[86] (_Tritonia_), Mueller in Entochocha,[87]  Haeckel in Ascidia,[88] Lacaze Duthiers in _Dentalium_.[89] Figures 18 to  21, Pl. 6, are taken from Koren and Danielssen's[90] memoir on the  development of _Purpura lapillus_.    Figs. 22-24 show the same stages in a fish (_Amphioxus_) as given by  Haeckel, and it is unnecessary to point out the great similarity.    Lastly, figures 25 to 29, Pl. 6, are given by Dr. Allen Thomson,[91] as  illustrating the first stages in the development of the vertebrata.    I might have given many other examples, but the above are probably  sufficient, and will show that the processes which constitute the  life-history of the lowest organized beings very closely resemble the  first stages in the development of more advanced groups; that as Allen  Thomson has truly observed,[92] \"the occurrence of segmentation and the  regularity of its phenomena are so constant that we may regard it as one  of the best established series of facts in organic nature.\"    It is true that normal yolk-segmentation is not universal in the animal  kingdom; that there are great groups in which the yolk does not divide  in this manner,--perhaps owing to some difference in its relation to the  germinal vesicle, or perhaps because one of the suppressed stages in  embryological development, many examples might be given, not only in  zoology, but, as I may state on the authority of Dr. Hooker, in botany  also. But, however, this may be, it is surely not uninteresting, nor  without significance, to find that changes which constitute the  life-history of the lowest creatures for the initial stages even of the  highest.    Returning, in conclusion, to the immediate subject of this work, I have  pointed "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38233"],[0,"Birds Every Child Should Know (#16)"],[1,"for  next spring's planting. Don't you prefer the birds when flower seeds  cost only five cents a packet? Clinging to the slender, swaying stems,  the goldfinches themselves look so like yellow flowers that you do not  suspect how many are feasting in the garden until they are startled  into flight. Then away they go, bounding along through the air, now  rising, now falling, in long aerial waves peculiar to them alone. You  can always tell a goldfinch by its wavy course through the air. Often  it accents the rise of each wave as it flies by a ripple of sweet,  twittering notes. The yellow warbler is sometimes called a wild canary  because he looks like a canary; the goldfinch has the same misleading  name applied to him because he sings like one.    But goldfinches by no means depend upon our gardens for their daily  fare. Wild lettuce, mullein, dandelion, ragweed and thistles are  special favourites. Many weed stalks suddenly blossom forth into black  and gold when a flock of finches alight for a feast in the summer  fields, or, browned by winter frost, bend beneath the weight of the  birds when they cling to them protruding through the snow.    {126}    Usually not until July, when the early thistles furnish plenty of  fluff for nest lining, do pairs of goldfinches withdraw from flocks to  begin the serious business of raising a family. A compact, cozy,  cup-like structure of fine grass, vegetable fibre, and moss, is placed  in the crotch of a bush or tree, or sometimes in a tall, branching  thistle plant. Except the cedar wax wings, the goldfinches are the  latest nesters of all our birds. As their love-making is prolonged  through the entire summer, so is the deliciously sweet, tender,  canary-like song of the male. _Dear, dear, dearie,_ you may hear him  sing to his dearest all day long.    In summer, throughout his long courtship, he wears a bright,  lemon-yellow wedding suit with black cap, wings, and tail, while his  sweetheart is dressed in a duller green or olive yellow. After the  August moult, he emerges a dingy olive-brown, sparrowy bird, in  perfect colour harmony with the wintry fields.      PURPLE FINCH    _Called also: Linnet_    It would seem as if the people who named most of our birds and wild  flowers must have been colour-blind. Old rose is more nearly the  colour of this finch who looks like a brown {127} sparrow that had  been dipped into a bath of raspberry juice and left out in the sun to  fade. But only the mature males wear this colour, which is deepest on  their head, rump, and breast. Their sons are decidedly sparrowy until  the second year and their wives look so much like the song sparrows  that you must notice their heavy, rounded bills and forked tails to  make sure they are not their cousins. A purple finch that had been  caged two years gradually turned yellow, which none of his kin in the  wild state has ever been known to do. Why? No ornithologist is wise  enough to tell us, for the colour of birds is still imperfectly  understood.    Like the goldfinches, these finches wander about in flocks. You see  them in the hemlock and spruce trees feeding on the buds at the tips  of the branches, in the orchard pecking at the blossoms on the fruit  trees, in the wheat fields with the goldfinches destroying the larvae  of the midge, or by the roadsides cracking the seeds of weeds that are  too hard to open for birds less stout of bill. When it is time to  nest, these finches prefer evergreen trees to all others, although  orchards sometimes attract them.    A sudden outbreak of spirited, warbled song in March opens the purple  finch's musical season, which is almost as long as the song sparrow's.  Subdued nearly to a humming in October, it is still a delightful  reminder of the {128} finest voice possessed by any bird in the great  sparrow tribe. But it is when the singer is in love that the song  reaches its highest ecstasy. Then he springs into the air just as the  yellow-breasted chat, the oven-bird, and woodcock do when they go  a-wooing, and sings excitedly while mounting fifteen or twenty feet  above his mate until he drops exhausted at her side.      INDIGO BUNTING    _Called also: Indigo-bird._    Every child knows the bluebird, possibly the kingfisher and the blue  jay, too, but there is only one other bird with blue feathers, the  little indigo bunting, who is no larger than your pet canary, that you  are ever likely to meet unless you live in the Southwest where the  blue grosbeak might be your neighbour. If, by chance, you should see a  little lady indigo-bird you would probably say contemptuously:  \"Another tiresome sparrow,\" and go on your way, not noticing the faint  glint of blue in her wings and tail. Otherwise her puzzling plumage is  decidedly sparrowy, although unstreaked. So is that of her immature  sons. But her husband will be instantly recognised because he is the  only very small bird who wears a suit of deep, rich blue with  verdigris-green reflections {129} about the head--bluer than the  summer sky which pales where his little figure is outlined against it.    Mounting by erratic, short flights from the weedy places and bushy  tangles he hunts among to the branches of a convenient tree, singing  as he goes higher and higher, he remains for a time on a conspicuous  perch and rapidly and repeatedly sings. When almost every other bird  is moulting and moping, he warbles with the same fervour and timbre.  Possibly because he has the concert stage almost to himself in August,  he gets the credit of being a better performer than he really is. Only  the pewee and the red-eyed vireo, whom neither midday nor midsummer  heat can silence, share the stage with him then.      TOWHEE    _Called also: Chewink; Ground Robin; Joree_    From their hunting-ground in the blackberry tangle and bushes that  border a neighbouring wood, a family of chewinks sally forth boldly to  my piazza floor to pick up seed from the canary's cage, hemp, cracked  corn, sunflower seed, split pease, and wheat scattered about for their  especial benefit. One fellow grew bold enough to peck open a paper  bag. It is a daily happening to see at least one of the family close  {130} to the door; or even on the window-sill. The song, the English,  the chipping, the field, and the white-throated sparrows--any one or  all of these cousins--usually hop about with the chewinks most  amicably and with no greater ease of manner; but the larger chewink  hops more energetically and precisely than any of them, like a  mechanical toy.    Heretofore I had thought of this large, vigorous bunting as a rather  shy or at least self-sufficient bird with no desire to be neighbourly.  His readiness to be friends when sure of the genuineness of the  invitation, was a delightful surprise. From late April until late  October my softly-whistled _towhee_ has rarely failed to bring a  response from some pensioner, either in the woodland thicket or among  the rhododendrons next to the piazza where the seeds have been  scattered by the wind. _Chewink_, or _towhee_ comes the brisk call  from wherever the busy bunting is foraging. The chickadee,  whippoorwill, phoebe and pewee also tell you their names, but this  bird announces himself by two names, so you need make no mistake.    Because he was hatched in a ground nest and loves to scratch about on  the ground for insects, making the dead leaves and earth rubbish fly  like any barnyard fowl, the towhee it often called the ground robin.  He is a little smaller than robin-redbreast. Looked down upon from  {131} above he appears to be almost a black bird, for his upper parts,  throat and breast are very dark where his mate is brownish; but  underneath both are grayish white with patches of rusty red on their  sides, the colour resembling a robin's breast when its red has  somewhat faded toward the end of summer. The white feathers on the  towhee's short, rounded wings and on the sides of his tail are  conspicuous signals, as he flies jerkily to the nearest cover. You  could not expect a bird with such small wings to be a graceful flyer.    Rarely does he leave the ground except to sing his love-song. Then,  mounting no higher than a bush or low branch, he entrances his  sweetheart, if not the human critic, with a song to which Ernest  Thompson Seton supplies the well-fitted words: _Chuck-burr, pill-a  will-a-will-a._      RED-BREASTED GROSBEAK    Among birds, as among humans, it is the father who lends his name to  the family, however difficult it may be to know the mother and  children by it. Who that had not studied the books would recognise  Mrs. Scarlet Tanager by her name? or Mrs. Purple Finch? or Mrs. Indigo  Bunting? or Mrs. Rose-breasted Grosbeak? {132} The latter lady has not  a rose-coloured feather on her. She is a streaked, brown bird,  resembling an overgrown sparrow, with a thick, exaggerated finch bill  and a conspicuous, white eyebrow. When her husband wears his winter  clothes in the tropics, his feathers are said to be similar to hers,  so that even his name, then, does not fit. But when he returns to the  United States in May he is, in very truth, a rose-breasted grosbeak.  His back is as black as a chewink's; underneath he is grayish white,  and a patch of lovely, brilliant, rose colour on his breast, with wing  linings of the same shade, make him a splendidly handsome fellow.  Perhaps before you get a glimpse of the feathers that are his best  means of introduction, you may hear a thin _eek_ call-note from some  tree-top, or better still, listen to the sweet, pure, mellow, joyously  warbled song, now loud and clear, now softly tender, that puts him in  the first rank of our songsters.    Few birds so conspicuously dressed risk the safety of their nests  either by singing or by being seen near it, but this gentle cavalier  not only carries food to his brooding mate but actually takes his turn  at sitting upon the pale-greenish, blue-speckled eggs.
