Added to this she  showed the other personal traits which we have described in  detail, leading to her success in misrepresenting herself.  Her  strongly developed physiognomy has caused many people to believe  her older than she stated, but still one has seen such lineaments  belonging to girls of 17.    The bearing which the accident at 18 had upon the case it is  impossible for us to estimate.  Her family are very clear on this  point; they maintain that all her bad conduct has developed since  then.  Through unwillingness, or barely possibly real amnesia for  the injury, Inez has not helped us to know the facts.  Dr.  Augusta Bronner, who has studied this case with me, cleverly  suggests that just as anyone becomes confused in distinguishing  really remembered experiences from what has been told by others  was one's experience, so Inez gets confused between what has  really happened and what she herself has told as having happened.  This finally involves a pathological liar in a network which is  difficult to untangle.  Part of the causation of the present  lying, then, is the extensive lying which has been done  previously.    Psychological analysis in such a case is most difficult because  of the unreliability of the individual's own statements about her  life, inner and outer.  Psychoanalysts will be delighted, in the  light of what we long afterward found out, at the pregnant  opening sentence of an interview, recorded above, when Inez  blurted out that she was once in a State hospital.  However, from  what we ascertained, we may see clearly that here is an  individual with a past that she desires to cover up.  Much more  delinquency may be involved of which we know nothing.  As the  result of circumstances and traits she finds herself, despite her  very good ability, inadequately meeting the world.  Her forceful  personality carries her into situations which she is incompetent  to live up to.  The immediate way out is by creating a new  complication, and this may be through lies or the simulation of  illness, at which she has become an adept.  Altogether, Inez must  be thought of as one who is trying to satisfy certain wishes and  ambitions which are too much for her resources.  Towards the goal  to which her nature urges her she follows the path of least  resistance.  Being the personality that she is, the social world  offers her stimulation which does not come to others.    To discuss the problem of her responsibility would be to  introduce metaphysics--it is sure that in the ordinary sense she  is not insane.  The cause of her career is not a psychosis,  although we readily grant that out of the materials of her mental  experience she may ultimately build up definite delusions.        CASE 4    Summary:  A girl of 16 had been engaged in an extraordinary  amount of clever shoplifting under the influence of her  ``mother.''  In the courts where the cases against her were heard  there was much sympathy with the girl, but it was difficult to  carry out any measures for her benefit because of the excessive  prevarications which had characterized her for a long period.  Under oath she falsely accused her ``father'' of sex immorality  with her.  She was removed from her home, and with knowledge of  the mental conflicts which beset her, splendid efforts to  ``cure'' this girl met with success.  It is another case where  supposed inherited traits turn out to be the result of  environmental influences.      Through frequent communication with the highly intelligent woman  with whom Edna F. was placed in a small western city after she  was taken from her previous miserable environment, we have been  able to keep close check on the progress of the case for several  years.  It was also very fortunate for our understanding that a  nurse who knew the girl's real mother in New York, where Edna was  born, appeared on the scene and gave us data upon which we could  base some opinions of the outcome.  The case in its entirety had  proved very baffling to detectives because of the mass of  contradictory lies told by both the girl and her ``mother.''    Our attention was first called to this girl when a number of  court people were trying to solve the mystery.  She had been  arrested for shoplifting and her curious attitude and statements  had made some believe she was not quite right mentally.  Once  before she had been detected stealing things in a shop.  One of  her remarkable statements this last time was that her parents  were implicated in the thieving and she named certain stolen  articles which might be found at their home.  She went with the  detectives and accused her ``mother'' of wearing a dress which  she, Edna, had stolen.  The woman was forced to give up the dress  and other articles, but it was found later that these goods had  been actually bought and paid for by the parents.  Later it was  found that the woman was a party to the girl's stealing and this  made the girl's story seem all the more strange, for if she were  going to involve the people at all why did she not pick out the  actually stolen articles?  However, long study of the case  brought out the fact that this type of statement was a  characteristic of Edna's.  Her word on even important points was  absolutely unreliable and her own interests were frequently  thwarted by her prevarications.    The case in its different aspects came up in court again and  again until finally most of the truth was ascertained, enough to  justify radical measures being undertaken.  During this period  the mother was discovered to be an atrocious liar; even with her  last bitter confession that all she had said about her motherhood  had been untrue, she manufactured more quite unnecessary  falsehoods.  In the meantime the family physician and the family  lawyer had both informed me of the peculiar mysteries of the case  and of the perfect mass of lies into which the statements of both  mother and daughter led.  This sort of thing had been going on  for years.  It is of no small interest to note that the woman was  greatly over-dressed and made up.  On numerous occasions she  appealed to us to study the girl and find out why she lied so  much and why she had such an inclination to steal, in the  meantime attempting to fill us up with many inventions about the  girl's antecedents.    Physical examination showed a perfectly normally developed girl.  No sensory defects.  Pleasant features.  Well shaped head.  Weight 101 lbs; height 5 ft. 1 in.  We found no hysterical  stigmata.  Menstruation had first occurred at 14.  No trouble or  irregularity was reported.  We learn the girl has never had any  serious illness.  She herself told of fainting spells after being  whipped and so on, but these were undoubtedly falsifications.  The family physician informed us he had operated on the girl for  appendicitis about three months previous to the time we first saw  her.  He had found some evidences of an old appendiceal  inflammation, but it is quite likely from the various accounts  which we heard that her symptoms recounted to him were largely  fabrication and that the signs which he found, at least in their  excessive phases, were partly deceptions.  The most important  point for the court proceedings was his findings that the girl  had never been sexually tampered with and had no local disease.  At the time when we knew Edna she was being treated for a local  infection which must have been recent and superficial, for it  rapidly subsided.    We had ample opportunity to test Edna's ability and found it  quite normal.  She had been out of school much and had been  careless in general about her education, but she had finally  finished the grammar school.  A long list of tests was done  almost uniformly well.  Where a prolonged task which required  concentration was asked, Edna was inclined to work carelessly,  but in general her capacities proved to be decidedly good.  She  was accustomed to read nothing but the lightest literature and  fairy stories and her interests were of the superficial sort.  Neither in powers of imagery or imagination, nor by anything else  ascertained about her mental abilities did we come to know of any  point of special bearing upon her behavior.    On the ``Aussage'' picture test, she gave only 12 details, all  correct, on free recital.  Upon questioning she gave 28 more  items and almost the only variation from accuracy was in respect  to the colors.  Evidently she let her fancy run when she could  not remember correctly; through this she got 6 items incorrect.  She readily accepted 3 out of 4 suggestions.    Our earliest impressions of Edna state that she seemed much  confused in her stories and in her manner of telling them,  leaving sentences unfinished and trying to explain  inconsistencies by other inconsistencies.  At this time she was  referring constantly to her doubts about her age, her family, and  her origin.  She then seemed highly suspicious of every one and  talked of suicide.  However, when she was showing these signs she  could be diverted, for she worked with much pleasure at the  tests, particularly certain memory tests on which she did well.    On account of the difficulties of the solution of this case under  the law considerable time and effort were spent in looking up her  record.  It was found that some years ago Edna had run away from  home and there was a newspaper article published about her.  Even  at that time an officer who went to the home was unable to  ascertain the truth in the case.  The family had frequently moved  and the mother asserted it was because of the bad reputation  which the girl's actions had given them.  The neighbors  complained of the cruelty of the parents to Edna, but this meant  only the whippings which the mother had given her.  By all  accounts the father was a good man who insisted that affairs  between"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44941"],[0,"The Government of God (#16)"],[1,", in integrity of heart, and  in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, and  wilt keep my statutes and my judgements: then I will establish the  throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever, as I promised to David  thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne  of Israel. But if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your  children, and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which I  have set before you, but go and serve other gods, and worship them:  then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them;  and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of  my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people:  and at this house, which is high, every one that passeth by it shall be  astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why hath the Lord done  thus unto this land, and to this house? And they shall answer, Because  they forsook the Lord their God, who brought forth their fathers out  of the land of Egypt, and have taken hold upon other gods, and have  worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath the Lord brought upon  them all this evil.\" 1 Kings ix. 3-9.    Thus, then, these men, delegated and appointed of God, acted as his  representatives on the earth. They received their kingdoms from him.  They were anointed by prophets of God, who received the word of the  Lord concerning them, as in the case of Saul and David; and if they  departed from God, he chastised, or removed them, as in the case of  Saul and David, and of which the history of the Kings of Israel is a  striking example, and faithful commentary. Those that were faithful  among them sought to know the mind of God, and to carry out his  designs. The greatest, most powerful, and prosperous rule that ever  existed among them, as a nation, was that of Solomon, who asked, and  obtained wisdom from God; and that wisdom as a necessary consequence  brought honour, happiness, security, riches, magnificence, and power.  Thus those kings that were righteous, who received their kingdoms from  the Lord, went to war, or proclaimed peace by his directions; they  were his representatives on the earth, and governed his people as the  Lord's anointed. Yet even the monarchy of the House of Israel was  not in strict accordance with the will of God; but originated in the  rebellion and pride of the children of Israel, who, wishing to be like  the nations around them, being dissatisfied with their judges, desired  of the Lord a king. The following are their words, and the Lord's  answer: \"Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together,  and came to Samuel unto Ramah, and said unto him, Behold thou art old,  and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like  all the nations. But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give  us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the Lord. And the Lord  said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that  they say unto thee; for they have not rejected thee, but they have  rejected me, that I should not reign over them. According to all the  works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of  Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, and served  other gods, so do they also unto thee. Now therefore hearken unto their  voice: howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner  of the king that shall reign over them. And Samuel told all the words  of the Lord unto the people that asked of him a king. And he said,  this will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: he will  take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to  be his horsemen; and some shall run before his chariots. And he will  appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and  will set them to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make  his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots. And he will  take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be cooks, and to be  bakers. And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your  oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants. And  he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to  his officers, and to his servants. And he will take your menservants,  and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses,  and put them to his work. He will take the tenth of your sheep; and  ye shall be his servants. And ye shall cry out in that day because of  your king which ye shall have chosen you; and the Lord will not hear  you in that day. Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of  Samuel; and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us; that we  also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and  go out before us, and fight our battles. And Samuel heard all the words  of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the Lord. And the  Lord said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king.  And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man unto his city.\"  1 Sam. viii. 4-22.    We find that this thing was displeasing to the Lord; they resisted the  counsel of God; but as they were the Lord's people, he listened to  their requests, and gave according to their desires; he felt bound to  fulfil his engagements, and, if they would not walk fully by the rule  that he required, to give a government of their own asking, which, if  not so good as the one he proposed, was nevertheless sanctioned by him;  and that order once established, those kings set apart, and anointed by  him, had a perfect right to look to him for his guidance, which they  did, and inasmuch as they performed his will, as his representatives,  were blessed of him. For kings could not be blamed for the order that  existed, they did not originate the government; it was the people, all  they could do was to rule according to the direction of the Lord. But  this was not a perfect government. The Lord had his eye on something  yet more glorious, something in which the salvation, and happiness of  the world were concerned; a rule of righteousness, when, not only one  nation, but the kingdoms and dominions of the whole earth, should be  given to the Son of God; and when all nations, kindreds, people, and  tongues should serve and obey him; and as the earth belonged to him,  and the people also, that he should govern them. Such will be the case  as we shall hereafter show, and a system be introduced that will not  only benefit one nation, but that will govern all nations, bless the  whole of the human family, and exalt and happify the world. All these  things that have existed, are merely temporary arrangements, adapted  to the weakness, ignorance, and wickedness of the human family, in  the times of darkness, and power of Satan. If the above is the case,  in regard to the best of these governments, even that of the House of  Israel, what is the situation of those who are governing, without even  any pretensions to have received their government and authority from  God! It may be asked, What is to be done in this state of things? how  are they to be regulated? This is worthy of our attention, but as we  shall devote some time to this hereafter, we will content ourselves  with saying, this is God's work, and not man's. He has these things in  his hands, and he must arrange them; confusion, revolt, rebellion, is  not the way to bring these things about; for if the world is already  evil, this will only make it worse. Besides, the kings and rulers of  the present day are no more responsible than others; they did not make  the nations as they are, they found them so; neither are they appointed  to govern the world, nor do any of them profess it. According to their  most extended calculation, their power would be confined to their own  nations. Some of the kings and queens of the earth seem to be actuated  by a desire to promote the happiness of the nations with which they  are associated, and over which they rule. The Queen of England is  almost universally beloved by her subjects, and that deservedly; she  has been mild and pacific in her course, and her rule and dominion  have been as near right as it is possible for a government to be under  existing circumstances. If there are evils, she did not originate  them, she found them so. She has kept her covenant that she made with  the nation, and sought the welfare of her subjects, and they owe her  fealty, and ought to render to her obedience. And as she, nor no  monarch, is set to build up the kingdom of God, or establish universal  rule, as a monarchy without authority from God, it is perhaps as good  a form as could exist. The Emperor of Russia, with all his faults of  government, nevertheless possesses many good traits; at any rate he  seems to reverence the Lord. Some time ago, when the cholera broke out  in St. Petersburgh, the inhabitants supposed that their wells had been  poisoned; a large number of people assembled for the purpose, as they  thought, of finding out, and punishing the aggressors. The excitement  was very great. The Emperor, hearing of the tumult, rushed into their  midst and said, \"My children, you are mistaken in supposing that the  wells have been poisoned, and this is the cause of our affliction, this  is a judgement that has come from God, let us fall down before him,  and ask him to remove his scourge from our midst;\" whereupon he fell  upon his knees in the midst of the people, and prayed to the Lord to  remove the plague from among them. He has a strong impression that God  has a work for him to do on the earth; and in this he may be right.  Although he is not delegated to establish the kingdom of God, he may  nevertheless be appointed as Caesar, Nebuchadnezzar, and others, as a  scourge to the nations, and so fulfil his destiny, for as we are on  the eve of great events, and a fearful doom awaits "]]]
