In like manner, if he shall conclude  from what he perceives in one station, that, in case he advances towards  the moon or tower, he should still be affected with the like ideas, he is  mistaken. But his mistake lies not in what he perceives immediately, and  at present, (it being a manifest contradiction to suppose he should err  in respect of that) but in the wrong judgment he makes concerning the  ideas he apprehends to be connected with those immediately perceived: or,  concerning the ideas that, from what he perceives at present, he imagines  would be perceived in other circumstances. The case is the same with  regard to the Copernican system. We do not here perceive any motion of  the earth: but it were erroneous thence to conclude, that, in case we  were placed at as great a distance from that as we are now from the other  planets, we should not then perceive its motion.    HYL.  I understand you; and must needs own you say things plausible  enough. But, give me leave to put you in mind of one thing. Pray,  Philonous, were you not formerly as positive that Matter existed, as you  are now that it does not?    PHIL.  I was. But here lies the difference. Before, my positiveness was  founded, without examination, upon prejudice; but now, after inquiry,  upon evidence.    HYL.  After all, it seems our dispute is rather about words than things.  We agree in the thing, but differ in the name. That we are affected with  ideas FROM WITHOUT is evident; and it is no less evident that there  must be (I will not say archetypes, but) Powers without the mind,  corresponding to those ideas. And, as these Powers cannot subsist by  themselves, there is some subject of them necessarily to be admitted;  which I call MATTER, and you call SPIRIT. This is all the difference.    PHIL.  Pray, Hylas, is that powerful Being, or subject of powers,  extended?    HYL.  It hath not extension; but it hath the power to raise in you the  idea of extension.    PHIL.  It is therefore itself unextended?    HYL.  I grant it.    PHIL.  Is it not also active?    HYL.  Without doubt. Otherwise, how could we attribute powers to it?    PHIL.  Now let me ask you two questions: FIRST, Whether it be  agreeable to the usage either of philosophers or others to give the name  MATTER to an unextended active being? And, SECONDLY, Whether it be  not ridiculously absurd to misapply names contrary to the common use of  language?    HYL.  Well then, let it not be called Matter, since you will have it so,  but some THIRD NATURE distinct from Matter and Spirit. For what reason  is there why you should call it Spirit? Does not the notion of spirit  imply that it is thinking, as well as active and unextended?    PHIL.  My reason is this: because I have a mind to have some notion of  meaning in what I say: but I have no notion of any action distinct from  volition, neither can I conceive volition to be anywhere but in a  spirit: therefore, when I speak of an active being, I am obliged to mean  a Spirit. Beside, what can be plainer than that a thing which hath no  ideas in itself cannot impart them to me; and, if it hath ideas, surely  it must be a Spirit. To make you comprehend the point still more  clearly if it be possible, I assert as well as you that, since we are  affected from without, we must allow Powers to be without, in a Being  distinct from ourselves. So far we are agreed. But then we differ as to  the kind of this powerful Being. I will have it to be Spirit, you Matter,  or I know not what (I may add too, you know not what) Third Nature. Thus,  I prove it to be Spirit. From the effects I see produced, I conclude  there are actions; and, because actions, volitions; and, because there  are volitions, there must be a WILL. Again, the things I perceive must  have an existence, they or their archetypes, out of MY mind: but, being  ideas, neither they nor their archetypes can exist otherwise than in an  understanding; there is therefore an UNDERSTANDING. But will and  understanding constitute in the strictest sense a mind or spirit. The  powerful cause, therefore, of my ideas is in strict propriety of speech a  SPIRIT.    HYL.  And now I warrant you think you have made the point very clear,  little suspecting that what you advance leads directly to a  contradiction. Is it not an absurdity to imagine any imperfection in God?    PHIL.  Without a doubt.    HYL.  To suffer pain is an imperfection?    PHIL.  It is.    HYL.  Are we not sometimes affected with pain and uneasiness by some  other Being?    PHIL.  We are.    HYL.  And have you not said that Being is a Spirit, and is not that  Spirit God?    PHIL.  I grant it.    HYL.  But you have asserted that whatever ideas we perceive from without  are in the mind which affects us. The ideas, therefore, of pain and  uneasiness are in God; or, in other words, God suffers pain: that is to  say, there is an imperfection in the Divine nature: which, you  acknowledged, was absurd. So you are caught in a plain contradiction.    PHIL.  That God knows or understands all things, and that He knows,  among other things, what pain is, even every sort of painful sensation,  and what it is for His creatures to suffer pain, I make no question. But,  that God, though He knows and sometimes causes painful sensations in us,  can Himself suffer pain, I positively deny. We, who are limited and  dependent spirits, are liable to impressions of sense, the effects of an  external Agent, which, being produced against our wills, are  sometimes painful and uneasy. But God, whom no external being can affect,  who perceives nothing by sense as we do; whose will is absolute and  independent, causing all things, and liable to be thwarted or resisted by  nothing: it is evident, such a Being as this can suffer nothing, nor be  affected with any painful sensation, or indeed any sensation at all. We  are chained to a body: that is to say, our perceptions are connected with  corporeal motions. By the law of our nature, we are affected upon every  alteration in the nervous parts of our sensible body; which sensible  body, rightly considered, is nothing but a complexion of such qualities  or ideas as have no existence distinct from being perceived by a mind. So  that this connexion of sensations with corporeal motions means no more  than a correspondence in the order of nature, between two sets of ideas,  or things immediately perceivable. But God is a Pure Spirit, disengaged  from all such sympathy, or natural ties. No corporeal motions are  attended with the sensations of pain or pleasure in His mind. To know  everything knowable, is certainly a perfection; but to endure, or suffer,  or feel anything by sense, is an imperfection. The former, I say, agrees  to God, but not the latter. God knows, or hath ideas; but His ideas are  not conveyed to Him by sense, as ours are. Your not distinguishing, where  there is so manifest a difference, makes you fancy you see an absurdity  where there is none.    HYL.  But, all this while you have not considered that the quantity of  Matter has been demonstrated to be proportioned to the gravity of bodies.  And what can withstand demonstration?    PHIL.  Let me see how you demonstrate that point.    HYL.  I lay it down for a principle, that the moments or quantities of  motion in bodies are in a direct compounded reason of the velocities and  quantities of Matter contained in them. Hence, where the velocities are  equal, it follows the moments are directly as the quantity of Matter in  each. But it is found by experience that all bodies (bating the small  inequalities, arising from the resistance of the air) descend with an  equal velocity; the motion therefore of descending bodies, and  consequently their gravity, which is the cause or principle of that  motion, is proportional to the quantity of Matter; which was to be  demonstrated.    PHIL.  You lay it down as a self-evident principle that the quantity of  motion in any body is proportional to the velocity and MATTER  taken together; and this is made use of to prove a proposition from  whence the existence of MATTER is inferred. Pray is not this arguing in  a circle?    HYL.  In the premise I only mean that the motion is proportional to the  velocity, jointly with the extension and solidity.    PHIL.  But, allowing this to be true, yet it will not thence follow that  gravity is proportional to MATTER, in your philosophic sense of the  word; except you take it for granted that unknown SUBSTRATUM, or  whatever else you call it, is proportional to those sensible qualities;  which to suppose is plainly begging the question. That there is magnitude  and solidity, or resistance, perceived by sense, I readily grant; as  likewise, that gravity may be proportional to those qualities I will not  dispute. But that either these qualities as perceived by us, or the  powers producing them, do exist in a MATERIAL SUBSTRATUM; this is what  I deny, and you indeed affirm, but, notwithstanding your demonstration,  have not yet proved.    HYL.  I shall insist no longer on that point. Do you think, however, you  shall persuade me that the natural philosophers have been dreaming all  this while? Pray what becomes of all their hypotheses and explications of  the phenomena, which suppose the existence of Matter?    PHIL.  What mean you, Hylas, by the PHENOMENA?    HYL.  I mean the appearances which I perceive by my senses.    PHIL.  And the appearances perceived by sense, are they not ideas?    HYL.  I have told you so a hundred times.    PHIL.  Therefore, to explain the phenomena, is, to shew how we come to  be affected with ideas, in that manner and order wherein they are  imprinted on our senses. Is it not?    HYL.  It is.    PHIL.  Now, if you can prove that any philosopher has explained the  production of any one idea in our minds by the help of MATTER, I shall  for ever acquiesce, and look on all that hath been said against it as  nothing; but, if you"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4731"],[0,"Seven Little Australians (#16)"],[1," General till Esther would be frightened to leave the room,  and then me and Judy would nick down and have a run, and get back  before you let them go.\"    Judy shook her head.    \"That would be awfully stale,\" she said.  \"If I go, I shall stay  down some time.  Why shouldn't we have a picnic down at the river?\"    \"Oh, yes, let's!\" Bunty cried, with sparkling eyes.    \"I'm sure we could manage it especially as it's Saturday, and Pip  hasn't to go to school,\" Judy continued, thinking it rapidly out.  \"Two of you could go and get some food.  Tell Martha you are all  going for a picnic--she'll be glad enough not to have dinner to  set--then you go on.  Two others can watch if the coast's clear  while I get down and across the paddocks, and once we're at the  corner of the road we're safe.\"    It seemed feasible enough, and in a very short time the preparations  were all made.  Pip was mounting guard at the shed, and had undertaken  to get Judy safely away, and Bunty had been stationed on the back  veranda to keep cave and whistle three times if there was any danger.    He was to wait for a quarter of an hour by the kitchen clock, and  then, if all was well, to bring the big billy and a bread loaf,  and catch the others up on the road.    It was slow work waiting there, and he stood on one leg, like a  meditative fowl, and reviewed the events of the last few exciting  days.    He had a depressed feeling at his heart, but why he could hardly  tell.  Perhaps it was the lie he had told his father, and which was  still unconfessed, because the horse was seriously lame, and his  courage oozed away every time he thought of that riding-whip.    Perhaps it was the reaction after the great excitement.  Or it may  have been a rankling sense of injustice at the small glory his brave  deeds on Judy's behalf evoked from the others.  They did not seem to  attach any importance to them, and, indeed, laughed every time he  alluded to them or drew public attention to his scars.  Two or  three of the scratches on his legs were really bad ones, and while he  was standing waiting he turned down his stockings and gazed at these  with pitying eyes and something like a sob in his throat.    \"Nobody cares!\" he muttered, and one of his ever-ready tears fell  splashing down on one extended bare leg.  \"Judy likes Pip best, and  he never climbed the cactus; Meg thinks I tell stories; and Nellie  says I'm a greedy pig--nobody cares!\"    Another great fat tear gathered and fell.  \"Have you taken root  there?\" a voice asked.    His father, smoking at the open french window, had been watching him,  and marvelling at his rare and exceeding quietness.    Bunty started, guiltily, and pulled up his stockings.    \"I'm not doin' nothin',\" he said aggrievedly, after a minute's  pause.  Bunty always lapsed into evil grammar when agitated.  \"Nothing  at all.  I'm goin' to a picnic.\"    \"Ah, indeed!\" said the Captain.  \"You looked as if you were  meditating on some fresh mischief, or sorrowing over some old--which  was it?\"    Bunty turned a little pale, but remarked again he \"wasn't doin'  nothin'.\"    The Captain felt in a lazy, teasing mood, and his little fat, dirty  son, was the only subject near.    \"Suppose you come here and confess every bit of mischief you've  done this week,\" he said gravely.  \"I've the whole morning to  spare, and it's time I saw to your morals a little.\"    Bunty approached the arm of the chair indicated, but went whiter than  ever.    \"Ah, now we're comfortable.  Well, there was stealing from the pantry  on Tuesday--that's one,\" he said, encouragingly.  \"Now then.\"    \"I n--n--never did n--nothin' else,\" Bunty gasped.  He felt certain  it was all over with him, and the cricket ball episode was discovered.  He even looked nervously round to see if the riding-whip was near.  Yes, there was Esther's silver-topped one flung carelessly on a chair.  He found time to wish fervently Esther was a tidy woman.    \"Nothing at all, Bunty?  On your word?\" said his father, in an  impressive tone.    \"I was p--playin' marbles,\" he said, in a shaking voice.  \"How  c--c--could I have sh--shot anything at y--y--your old horse?\"    \"Horse--ah!\" said his father.  A light broke upon him, and his face  grew stern.  \"What did you throw at Mazeppa to lame him?  Answer me at  once.\"    Bunty gave a shuddering glance at the whip.    \"N-n-nothin',\" he answered--\"n--nothin' at all.  My c--c--cricket  b--ball was up in the st--st--stables.  I was only p--p--playin'  marbles.\"  The Captain gave him a little shake.    \"Did you lame Mazeppa with the cricket ball?\" he said sternly.    \"N--n--no I n--never,\" Bunty whispered, white to the lips.  Then  semi-repentance came to him, and he added:  \"It just rolled out of my  p--p--pocket, and M--Mazeppa was passing and h--h--hit his l-leg on it.\"    \"Speak the truth, or I'll thrash you within an inch of your life,\" the  Captain said, standing up, and seizing Esther's whip: \"Now then, sir--was  it you lamed Mazeppa?\"    \"Yes,\" said Bunty, bursting into a roar of crying, and madly dodging  the whip.    Then, as the strokes descended on his unhappy shoulders, he filled  the air with his familiar wail of \"'Twasn't me, 'twasn't my fault!\"    \"You contemptible young cur!\" said his father, pausing a moment when  his arm ached with wielding the whip.  \"I'll thrash this mean spirit  of lying and cowardice out of you, or kill you in the attempt.\"  Swish,  swish.  \"What sort of a man do you think you'll make?\"  Swish, swish.  \"Telling lies just to save your miserable skin!\"  Swish, swish,  swish, swish.    \"You've killed me--oh, you've killed me!  I know you have!\" yelled  the wretched child, squirming all over the floor.  \"'Twasn't me,  'twasn't my fault--hit the others some.\"    Swish, swish, swish.  \"Do you think the others would lie so  contemptibly?  Philip never lied to me.  Judy would cut her tongue out  first.\"  Swish, swish, swish.  \"Going to a picnic, are you?  You can  picnic in your room till to-morrow's breakfast.\"  Swish, swish, swish.  \"Pah--get away with you!\"    Human endurance could go no further.  The final swish had been actual  agony to his smarting, quivering shoulders and back.  He thought of  the others, happy and heedless, out in the sunshine, trudging merrily  off to the river, without a thought of what he was bearing, and his  very heart seethed to burst in the hugeness of its bitterness and  despair.  \"Judy's home!\" he said, in a choking, passionate voice.  \"She lives in the old shed in the cow, paddock.  Boo, hoo, hoo!  They're keepin' it secret from you.  Boo, hoo.  She's gone to the  picnic, and she's run away from school.\"          CHAPTER XIII    Uninvited Guests      The captain was walking slowly across the paddocks with the cabbage-tree  hat he kept for the garden pushed back from his brow.  He was rather  heated after his tussle with his second son, and there was a thoughtful  light in his eyes.  He did not believe the truth of Bunty's final  remark, but still he considered there was sufficient probability in it  to make a visit to the shed not altogether superfluous.    Not that he expected, in any case, to find his errant daughter there,  for had not Bunty said there was a picnic down at the river?  But he  thought, there might be some trace or other.    The door of the shed swung back on its crazy hinges, and the sunlight  streamed in and made a bar of glorified dust across the place.    There was no sign of habitation here, unless a hair ribbon of Meg's  and some orange peel, might be considered as such.    He saw the shaky, home-made ladder, resting against the hole in the  ceiling, and though he had generally more respect for his neck than  his children had for theirs, he ventured his safety upon it.  It  creaked ominously as he reached the top step and crawled  through into the loft.    There were a ham-bone, a box of dominoes, and a burst pillow this  side of the partition, nothing else, so he walked across and  looked over.    \"Very cosy,\" he murmured, \"I shouldn't mind camping here myself  for a little time,\" and it even came into his head to do so, and be  there as a \"surprise party\" when Judy returned.  But he dismissed the  idea as hardly compatible with dignity.  He remembered hearing  rumours of missing furniture in the house, and almost a smile came  into his eyes as he saw the little old table with the spirit-lamp and  teapot thereon, the bed-clothing and washing-basin.  But a stern  look succeeded it.  Were seventy-seven miles not sufficient obstacle  to Judy's mischievous plans?  How did she dare thus to defy him, a  child of thirteen: and he her father?  His lips compressed  ominously, and he went down again and strode heavily back to the  house.    \"Esther!\" he called, in a vibrating voice at the foot of the  stairs.    And \"Coming, dear--half a minute,\" floated down in response.    Half a minute passed ten times, and then she came, the beautiful young  mother with her laughing-faced wee son in her arms.  Her eyes looked  so tender; and soft, and loving that he turned away impatiently; he  knew quite well how it would be; she would beg and entreat him to  forgive his little daughter when she heard, and when she looked as  bright and beautiful as she did just now he could refuse her nothing.    He stood in profound meditation for a minute or two.    \"What is it you want, John?\" she said.  \"Oh! and what do you think?  I have just found another tooth, a double one--come and look.\"    He came, half unwillingly, and stuck his little finger into his infant  son's mouth.    Esther guided it till it felt a tiny, hard substance.  \"The third,\"  she said proudly; \"aren't you pleased?\"    \"Hum!\" he said.  Then he meditated a little longer, and after a  minute or two rubbed his hands as if he was quite pleased with  himself.    \"Put on your hat, Esther, and the General's,\" he said, patting that  young gentleman's head affectionately.  \"Let us go down to the river  for a stroll;"]]]
