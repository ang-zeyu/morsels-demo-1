This sudden explosion of feeling throughout a whole race has been  observed in all nations.  Napoleon did not understand the power  of such explosions when he invaded Spain and Russia.  One may  easily disaggregate the facile mind of a crowd, but one can do  nothing before the permanent soul of a race.  Certainly the  Russian peasant is a very indifferent being, gross and narrow by  nature, yet at the first news of invasion he was transformed.  One may judge of this fact on reading a letter written by  Elizabeth, wife of the Emperor Alexander I.    ``From the moment when Napoleon had crossed our frontiers it was  as though an electric spark had spread through all Russia; and if  the immensity of its area had made it possible for the news to  penetrate simultaneously to every corner of the Empire a cry of  indignation would have arisen so terrible that I believe it would  have resounded to the ends of the earth.  As Napoleon advances  this feeling is growing yet stronger.  Old men who have lost all  or nearly all their goods are saying:  `We shall find a way of  living.  Anything is preferable to a shameful peace.'  Women all  of whose kin are in the army regard the dangers they are running  as secondary, and fear nothing but peace.  Happily this peace,  which would be the death-warrant of Russia, will not be  negotiated; the Emperor does not conceive of such an idea, and  even if he would he could not.  This is the heroic side of our  position.''    The Empress describes to her mother the two following traits,  which give some idea of the degree of resistance of which the  soul of the Russian is capable:--    ``The Frenchmen had caught some unhappy peasants in Moscow, whom  they thought to force to serve in their ranks, and in order that  they should not be able to escape they branded their hands as one  brands horses in the stud.  One of them asked what this mark  meant; he was told it signified that he was a French soldier.  `What!  I am a soldier of the Emperor of the French!' he said.  And immediately he took his hatchet, cut off his hand, and threw  it at the feet of those present, saying, `Take it--there's your  mark!'    ``At Moscow, too, the French had taken a score of peasants of  whom they wished to make an example in order to frighten the  villagers, who were picking off the French foraging parties and  were making war as well as the detachments of regular troops.  They ranged them against a wall and read their sentence in  Russian.  They waited for them to beg for mercy: instead of that  they took farewell of one another and made their sign of the  cross.  The French fired on the first of them; they waited for  the rest to beg for pardon in their terror, and to promise to  change their conduct.  They fired on the second, and on the  third, and so on all the twenty, without a single one having  attempted to implore the clemency of the enemy.  Napoleon has  not once had the pleasure of profaning this word in Russia.''    Among the characteristics of the popular mind we must mention  that in all peoples and all ages it has been saturated  with mysticism.  The people will always be convinced that  superior beings--divinities, Governments, or great men--have the  power to change things at will.  This mystic side produces an  intense need of adoration.  The people must have a fetich, either  a man or a doctrine.  This is why, when threatened with anarchy,  it calls for a Messiah to save it.    Like the crowd, but more slowly, the people readily passes from  adoration to hatred.  A man may be the hero of the people at one  period, and finally earn its curses.  These variations of popular  opinion concerning political personalities may be observed in all  times.  The history of Cromwell furnishes us with a very curious  example.[5]      [5] After having overthrown a dynasty and refused a crown he was  buried like a king among kings.  Two years later his body was  torn from the tomb, and his head, cut off by the executioner, was  exposed above the gate of the House of Parliament.  A little  while ago a statue was raised to him.  The old anarchist turned  autocrat now figures in the gallery of demigods.        4.  The Role of the Leader in Revolutionary Movements.      All the varieties of crowds--homogeneous and heterogeneous,  assemblies, peoples, clubs, &c.--are, as we have often repeated,  aggregates incapable of unity and action so long as they find no  master to lead them.    I have shown elsewhere, making use of certain physiological  experiments, that the unconscious collective mind of the crowd  seems bound up with the mind of the leader.  The latter gives it  a single will and imposes absolute obedience.    The leader acts especially through suggestion.  His success  depends on his fashion of provoking this suggestion.  Many  experiments have shown to what point a collectivity may be  subjected to suggestion.[6]      [6] Among the numerous experiments made to prove this fact one of  the most remarkable was performed on the pupils of his class by  Professor Glosson and published in the Revue Scientifique for  October 28, 1899.    ``I prepared a bottle filled with distilled water carefully  wrapped in cotton and packed in a box.  After several other  experiments I stated that I wished to measure the rapidity with  which an odour would diffuse itself through the air, and asked  those present to raise their hands the moment they perceived the  odour. . . .  I took out the bottle and poured the water on the  cotton, turning my head away during the operation, then took up a  stop-watch and awaited the result. . . .  I explained that I was  absolutely sure that no one present had ever smelt the odour of  the chemical composition I had spilt. . . .  At the end of  fifteen seconds the majority of those in front had held up their  hands, and in forty seconds the odour had reached the back of the  hall by fairly regular waves.  About three-quarters of those  present declared that they perceived the odour.  A larger number  would doubtless have succumbed to suggestion, if at the end of a  minute I had not been forced to stop the experiment, some of  those in the front rows being unpleasantly affected by the odour,  and wishing to leave the hall.''        According to the suggestions of the leaders, the multitude will  be calm, furious, criminal, or heroic.  These various suggestions  may sometimes appear to present a rational aspect, but they will  only appear to be reasonable.  A crowd is in reality inaccessible  to reason; the only ideas capable of influencing it will always  be sentiments evoked in the form of images.    The history of the Revolution shows on every page how easily the  multitude follows the most contradictory impulses given by  its different leaders.  We see it applaud just as vigorously at  the triumph of the Girondists, the Hebertists, the Dantonists,  and the Terrorists as at their successive downfalls.  One may be  quite sure, also, that the crowd understood nothing of these  events.    At a distance one can only confusedly perceive the part played by  the leaders, for they commonly work in the shade.  To grasp this  clearly we must study them in contemporary events.  We shall then  see how readily the leader can provoke the most violent popular  movements.  We are not thinking here of the strikes of the  postmen or railway men, in which the discontent of the employees  might intervene, but of events in which the crowd was not in the  least interested.  Such, for example, was the popular rising  provoked by a few Socialist leaders amidst the Parisian populace  on the morrow of the execution of Ferrer, in Spain.  The French  crowd had never heard of Ferrer.  In Spain his execution was  almost unnoticed.  In Paris the incitements of a few leaders  sufficed to hurl a regular popular army upon the Spanish Embassy,  with the intention of burning it.  Part of the garrison had to be  employed to protect it.  Energetically repulsed, the assailants  contented themselves with sacking a few shops and building some  barricades.    At the same time, the leaders gave another proof of their  influence.  Finally understanding that the burning of a foreign  embassy might be extremely dangerous, they ordered a pacific  demonstration for the following day, and were as faithfully  obeyed as if they had ordered the most violent riot.  No  example could better show the importance of leaders and the  submission of the crowd    The historians who, from Michelet to M. Aulard, have represented  the revolutionary crowd as having acted on its own initiative,  without leaders, do not comprehend its psychology.        CHAPTER V    THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE REVOLUTIONARY ASSEMBLIES    1.  Psychological Characteristics of the great Revolutionary  Assemblies.    A great political assembly, a parliament for example, is a crowd,  but a crowd which sometimes fails in effectual action on account  of the contrary sentiments of the hostile groups composing it.    The presence of these groups, actuated by different interests,  must make us consider an assembly as formed of superimposed and  heterogeneous crowds, each obeying its particular leaders.  The  law of the mental unity of crowds is manifested only in each  group, and it is only as a result of exceptional circumstances  that the different groups act with a single intention.    Each group in an assembly represents a single being.  The  individuals contributing to the formation of this being are no  longer themselves, and will unhesitatingly vote against their  convictions and their wishes.  On the eve of the day when Louis  XVI. was to be condemned Vergniaud protested with indignation  against the suggestion that he should vote for his death; but he  did so vote on the following day.    The action of a group consists chiefly in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44896"],[0,"The Autobiography of Parley Parker Pratt (#16)"],[1,"division, and have  concluded to stand aloof from it all.\"    \"Well, we are as much opposed to these things as you can be,  and, therefore, have come to preach the gospel, and show the  knowledge of God in its ancient purity, being instructed and sent  of Him without purse or scrip. So come and hear us.\"    \"O! indeed, if that is the case, I will.\"    So he came; the house was crowded with Baptists, Methodists,  Universalists, Non-professors, Infidels, etc.    We preached. After meeting, a Baptist minister by the name of  John Russell, a very learned and influential man, invited us to  tarry in the neighborhood and continue to preach; he said his house  should be our home, and he called a vote of the people whether they  wished us to preach more. The vote was unanimous in the  affirmative.    We tarried in the neighborhood some two months, and preached  daily in all that region to vast multitudes, both in town and  country, in the grove, and in school houses, barns and dwellings.  All parties were our hearers and friends, and contributed liberally  to our wants; and the old farmer, whose name was Calvin, who had  not been to meeting before for five years, became a constant  hearer, and opened his house for our home. He was very wealthy, and  bade us welcome to shoes, clothing, or anything we needed; many  Infidels, Universalists, etc., did the same.    In this neighborhood there lived a Baptist minister by the name  of Dotson, who opposed us with much zeal, from time to time, both  in public and in private, and from house to house.    He said the Book of Mormon was a fable; a silly, foolish mixture  of matter, possessing no interest, and that he could write a better  book himself. However, his principal objection was, that God could  give no _new_ revelation--the New Testament contained all  the knowledge that God had in store for man, and there was nothing  remaining unrevealed.    We asked him to open the New Testament and read to us the  history and destiny of the American continent and its inhabitants,  and the origin and lineage of the same; also, the history of the  ten tribes of Israel, and where they now were. We also asked him to  read to us from that book his own commission, and that of other  ministers of this age to preach the gospel. But he could do none of  these things; but still insisted that there was no subject worthy  of new revelation, and that no revelation could be given.    Said I, \"Mr. Dotson, relate to me your experience and call to  the ministry.\"    \"Well,\" he replied, \"I will do so, seeing that it is you, friend  Pratt; for you are able to bear it, and to comprehend something  about it; but I have never told it to my own members; and I dare  not, for they would not believe me.\"    \"Well, Mr. Dotson, be particular on the manner and means by  which you were called to the ministry.\"    \"Why, sir,\" said he, \"_I was called by a vocal voice from  Heaven_.\"    \"Well, Mr. Dotson, _there_ is one exception to your  general rule. We come to you with a new revelation, and you reject  it, because there can be no new revelation; and yet you profess to  have a new revelation, God having spoken from the heavens and  called _you_, and commissioned _you_ to preach eighteen hundred  years after the New Testament was written, and all revelation  finished! How is this?    \"The New Testament no where calls you by name; neither makes  mention of you as a minister of the gospel; but new revelation  does, if we are to believe you. And yet you would teach your  hearers and us, and all the world, to disbelieve all modern  revelation merely because it is new. Consequently, we are all bound  by your own rule to reject your call to the ministry, and to  believe it is a lie.\"    He could say no more.    At another time he was at Mr. Russell's with us, and, in  presence of Mr. R. and others, was opposing the Book of Mormon with  all his power.    We asked him to listen while we read a chapter in it. He did so,  and was melted into tears, and so affected and confounded that he  could not utter a word for some time. He then, on recovering, asked  us to his house, and opened the door for us to preach in his  neighborhood. We did so, and were kindly entertained by him.    But after this, he again hardened his heart, and finding his  opposition all in vain, he wrote a letter to the Rev. Mr. Peck, of  Rock Spring, some sixty miles distant, informing him that the  \"Mormons\" were about to take Green County, and requesting his  immediate attendance.    This Mr. Peck was a man of note, as one of the early settlers of  Illinois, and one of its first missionaries. He had labored for  many years in that new country and in Missouri, and was now Editor  of a paper devoted to Baptist principles.    This gentleman, was soon forthcoming, and commenced his public  addresses among the people, to try to convince them of the great  errors we had taught.    He said there were no antiquities in America; no ruined cities,  buildings, monuments, inscriptions, mounds, or fortifications, to  show the existence of such a people as the Book of Mormon  described.    He also said, that there were no domestic animals such as the  cow the ox, or the horse, found here when Europeans first  discovered the country. He then inquired how these animals became  extinct since the destruction of the Nephites.    He said further, that the fortifications and mounds of this  country were nothing more than the works of Nature.    He then warned the people against the study of the prophetic  parts of the Old and New Testaments, observing that these  mysterious prophecies were directly calculated to lead them into  delusion and bewilderment; that the best way to read and understand  prophecy was, to read it backwards--that is to say, after it is  fulfilled; that it was never designed to be understood before it  came to pass.    He also taught that the Millennium was already commenced, and  that Jesus Christ would not come, in person, till the great and  last judgment; and that the Millennium must first continue a year  for each day of the thousand years, spoken of by John the  Revelator, etc.    A meeting was held for the purpose of replying to him; the  people came out in great numbers.    I then replied in substance as follows:    \"My hearers:--The Rev. Mr. Peck is a great man. He is a man of  age and varied experience and learning. I am but a youth, inferior  to him in all these respects. I reverence his gray hairs; I respect  his learning; I admire his talents and ingenuity; and I feel a  delicacy in replying to him; and nothing but a love for the truth  and a hatred of error and falsehood, could induce me to come in  contact with him before the public; but where truth and salvation  are at stake I cannot shrink from duty, in consideration of age or  talent; I cannot spare the man, even if he were my father.    \"To do away the Book of Mormon, we are called upon to believe  that the temples, statues, pyramids, sculptures, monuments,  engravings, mounds and fortifications, now in ruins on the American  continent, are all the works of Nature in her playful moments; that  the bones of slumbering nations were never clothed upon with flesh,  and that their sleeping dust was never animated with life.    \"This is too monstrous; it is too marvelous, too miraculous for  out credulity; we can never believe that these things are the works  of Nature, unaided by human art; we are not so fond of the  marvelous.    \"Again, we are told that no cows or oxen were here when  Europeans first came to the country. I would ask what the wild  buffalo are, if they are not the cattle of the ancient inhabitants?  I would ask how horse tracks came to be imbedded in the petrified  rock of Kentucky, without a horse to make them? And if no race of  animals could become extinct, which once existed here, I would ask  Mr. Peck either to produce a living mammoth, or annihilate his  bones. But, perhaps, the reverend gentleman would say that those  bones, too, were the works of Nature, and that the huge animal they  seem to represent never existed.    \"Again, my hearers, we are warned against the study of prophecy.  We are told that a careful perusal of the prophecies, which the  reverend gentleman is pleased to call '_mysterious_' is a  principal cause of our delusion and blindness; and that the  prophecies were only designed to be read and understood after they  were fulfilled.    \"We will apply this rule, and learn its workings by practical  experience.    \"The people at the time of the flood adopted this rule, all save  eight souls. Mr. Peck's theology was then almost catholic. The  universal world (save eight) were disposed to remain in ignorance  as to the meaning of prophecy till after its fulfillment. The  result was that they knew not until the flood came and swept them  all away; then they could understand.    \"The people of Sodom were all of Mr. Peck's faith--all save Lot  and his family; they also perished unawares.    \"The Jews also were of this same school--I mean those who  perished in the siege of Jerusalem, in fulfillment of the prophecy  of Jesus Christ, recorded in the 21st chapter of Luke.    \"And permit me here to remind my hearers that this ancient  system of theology, will certainly prevail to an almost universal  extent at the time of the coming of the Son of Man. For Jesus  himself testified that, as it was in the days of Noah and in the  days of Lot, so should it be in the days of the coming of the Son  of Man. I would here pause and congratulate my reverend friend on  the glorious and popular prospects before him. Certain it is that  most of the world will, at some future day, be of his faith in this  respect; they will let the prophecies of the Holy Scriptures alone,  and not attempt to understand them until after their fulfilment.    \"But we are of another school.    \"We believe in Jesus, who said '_search the Scriptures_;'  we believe with Peter, that we have a"]]]
