Already they could hear the yells of  the pirates, who, as the boat ran up on the beach were but a quarter of  a mile behind.    \"Now, away for that wood!\" Sir John cried, as he leapt ashore. \"Now,  comrades, for a climb up the hill!\"    It was a steep ascent, and more than once one had to be helped up by the  others, and then in turn to assist them to get up beside him. Louder and  louder rose the shouts of the pirates, but the knights did not glance  back until they reached the top of the hill; then they turned and looked  round. A swarm of men were climbing after them, and were already halfway  up the cliff.    \"Heave them down!\" Sir John exclaimed, pointing to some loose rocks, and  set the example by lifting a great stone and hurling it over the edge.  Harcourt and Gervaise at once did the same, and twenty or thirty rocks  were speedily sent rolling down the steep ascent, and yells, shouts, and  cries were heard below.    \"That will check them a bit. Now let us be off,\" Sir John Boswell said,  and they at once started. After crossing a hundred yards of bare rock  they stood at the edge of another slope into a deep valley, beyond which  rose the central hill of the island. The valley ran right across,  and was filled with trees extending to the sea at either end. Running  rapidly down, the knights were within the shelter of the wood before the  Moslems had reached the brow behind them. A minute later they heard the  shouts of their enemies. Once in the wood they turned to the left, and  in a few minutes stood on the sea shore. It was a little bay some two  hundred yards across, and at either point the cliffs rose abruptly from  the water.    \"We shall have to swim round the point,\" Sir John said.    \"Take off your mail shirts. We will make our way along the rocks as far  as we can, and then drop them into the sea, otherwise they will know  that we have taken to the water.\"    They hurried along the rocks, and were able to make their way to within  fifty yards of the point; then, throwing their mail shirts into the sea,  they plunged in. All knew the importance of getting round before any of  the pirates, who would be searching the valley, came down on the shore,  and they swam their hardest until they rounded the corner. The wood  rang with the shouts of their pursuers, but no yell had risen from the  water's edge. A hundred yards farther, and they were able to land, and  were in a short time in the shelter of the trees that fringed the water  to the point where they had left the boat. There was no longer any  occasion for speed, and they made their way through the thick bushes and  undergrowth quietly, until they recovered breath after their exertions.  They had gone a few hundreds yards when from the bushes the slaves  suddenly rose up.    \"All has gone well,\" Sir John said to them in their own language. \"The  pirates are searching for us on the other side of the hill. There are  not likely to be many of them left here. We shall soon be in possession  of our boat again.\"    Followed by the slaves, they made their way forward until they stood at  the edge of the wood. Five or six pirates were standing on the shore.    \"I expect they have been left there,\" Harcourt said, \"to prevent the  slaves from carrying off the boat. They must have seen them run into the  wood. They won't reckon on our being with them.\"    Drawing their swords, the three knights rushed out, followed by the  slaves. They had but a hundred yards to run. The pirates, on seeing  them, raised a yell and drew their scimitars; but the sight of the  knights rushing upon them, when they had expected but a few unarmed  rowers, was too much for their courage, and when their assailants were  still fifty yards away they turned and fled. The fishing craft had been  run ashore but a few yards from their boat.    \"Get her afloat, Harcourt, and bring her to the stern of the fisherman.  Now, Tresham, follow me.\"    Sir John Boswell climbed up on to the fishing boat, which was a craft of  some fifteen tons burden. She was entirely deserted, but the sail still  hung from the yard, and a fire was burning on a stone hearth, raised on  some logs of wood in the centre of the deck.    \"Look for something to stave in a plank, Tresham.\"    Gervaise leapt down into the hold. There were some nets and spare sails  lying there, but nothing that would answer the purpose. He examined the  planks. The boat was very strongly and roughly built.    \"There is nothing here, Sir John, that will do, and nothing short of a  heavy sledge hammer would suffice to smash one of these planks.\"    \"There are a lot of them coming down the hill, Tresham. We have not many  minutes to spare, but we must disable the craft. They will soon be after  us again; they have run her hard and fast here, but when they all come  back they will soon get her off. Let us try one of these sweeps.\"    He lifted one of the heavy oars, and holding it upright he and Gervaise  together tried to drive the handle through the bottom. Again and again  they raised it and drove it down; but the plank was too strong, and too  securely fastened to the timbers.    \"We must give it up,\" the knight said, with a sigh. \"Fortune has  befriended us so far, Tresham, but she has deserted us at last. Another  three minutes, and we shall have thirty or forty of them upon us.\"    At this moment the lad's eye fell upon the fire.    \"We shall manage yet,\" he exclaimed, and, seizing a blazing brand, he  jumped below and set fire to the sails stowed there; they were as dry as  tinder, and the flame shot up at once.    \"That is good, Tresham,\" the knight said; \"but they will put it out  before it has caught the boat.\"    \"Not before it has burnt the sails,\" Gervaise replied. \"Now for this  one,\" and he applied the brand to the lower edge of the great sail.  Without a word Sir John seized another brand, and fired the sail on the  other side of the deck. The flames flashed up, and a wild yell of rage  and alarm broke from the pirates, who were now rushing down towards the  beach.    \"Now to the boat, Tresham; we have no time to lose if we would avoid  being pounded with stones.\"    They dropped over the stern into the boat. The galley slaves dipped  their oars into the water, and she shot away just as the foremost of the  pirates reached the edge of the water. A few stones were thrown; but  the pirates were so anxious about the craft, by which alone they could  escape from the island, that the majority at once climbed on board.    At a word from the knight, the slaves stopped rowing a hundred yards  from the shore. The sail was already consumed, and the yard and the  upper part of the mast were in flames. A dense smoke was rising from the  hold, and the pirates were throwing buckets of water down into it. In a  few minutes the smoke decreased.    \"I thought that they would be able to put it out; but, as far as we are  concerned, it matters little. They have lost their sails, and as I saw  but four sweeps, we can travel five miles to their one. If we find the  galleys we will look in here on our way back, and if they have not left  we will fire that craft more effectually, and then the pirates will be  trapped, and we can leave them till we have fetched off Sir Louis  and his prizes, and then have a grand hunt here. We took no prisoners  before, and a hundred slaves will be a useful addition to our wall  builders. Now, Tresham, I have to thank you warmly, for Harcourt and I  doubly owe our lives to you. It was thanks to your quickness of wit that  we regained our boat, for I would not have given a ducat for our chances  had you not thought of that scheme. In the second place, we should  assuredly have been overtaken again had it not been for your happy  thought of crippling them by burning their sails. By St. George,  Harcourt, this young countryman of ours is as quick and as ready of wit  as he has shown himself a brave and gallant fighter! We have no lack of  sturdy fighters; but the wit to devise and to seize upon the right thing  in the moment of danger is vastly more rare. As for myself, I have no  shame that this lad, who is young enough to be my son, should have thus,  twice in a single hour, pointed out the way to safety. With sword and  battleaxe I can, I trust, hold my own with any man; but my brain is dull  when it comes to hatching schemes. If we live, we shall see Sir Gervaise  one of the most distinguished knights of the Order.\"    \"While I feel gratified indeed, as I may well be by your commendation,  Sir John, I must, under your favour, say that you have given me a far  greater degree of credit than is my due. There was the fire, and there  was the sail, and the thought that the one would destroy the other was  simply a natural one, which might have occurred to a child. As to the  plan about the boat, seeing that there was the hill and the wood, it  flashed upon me at once that we might make a circuit and come back to  her.\"    \"Just so, lad; but those thoughts did not flash upon my mind, nor upon  that of Harcourt. It is just because those sort of ideas do flash upon  the minds of some men, and not of others, that the first rise to the  rank of distinguished commanders, while the others remain simple knights  who would play their part in a charge or in the defence of a breach, but  would be of no account as leaders.    \"Now row along steadily, men,\" he went on, speaking to the slaves.  \"We are still in good time, for it was not an hour from the moment we  touched the island to our departure from it, and much of that time we  have gained by the speed with which you rowed before. At any rate, we  shall make out the island before sunset, and whether we arrive there a  little sooner or later matters little. Harcourt, hand me that wineskin  and a goblet.

She is welcome to both the pin and your friendship. I  am thankful that this is my last year in High School.\"    \"You are a foolish girl, Marian Barber,\" cried Nora, \"and you'll wake up  some morning and find yourself awfully sorry for what you've just said.  You are the last person I should have suspected of being so ridiculous.  Why we've all played together since we were kiddies.\"    Marian tried to look dignified and unrelenting, but for an instant her  lip quivered suspiciously.    Anne seeing that Marian showed signs of wavering, crossed over to her  side, and slipping her arm around the obstinate girl, said gently:    \"Better think it over before you do any thing rash, dear. We are not  trying in the least to interfere in your affairs. You know the primary  object of the Phi Sigma Tau is to help one another. We thought that you  would be glad to have us coach you in astronomy. You know how thankful  Grace was for your help in trigonometry last year.\"    Marian hesitated as though at loss for an answer to this direct appeal  to her common sense. The girls watched her anxiously, hoping that Anne's  words had bridged the difficulty.    \"Come on, Marian,\" said Nora O'Malley briskly. \"Here's your sorority  pin. Put it on and forget that you ever took it off. You are too  sensible to nurse an imaginary grievance. Don't behave as Eleanor  Savelli did. You know--\"    But Nora was not allowed to finish the sentence, for Marian whirled upon  her with flashing eyes, her temporary softness disappearing entirely.    \"I don't wish to hear one word against Eleanor Savelli,\" she cried  wrathfully. \"She is my friend, and I shall stand up for her.\"    \"Your friend?\" was the united exclamation.    \"Yes, my friend,\" reiterated Marian stormily, \"and she is a true friend,  too. Last year she was initiated into your sorority, and then  deliberately slighted and left out of all your plans until in justice to  herself she resigned.    \"This year you are behaving in the same way with me. You began it by  criticizing my friend, Henry Hammond, and invited him to the judge's  house party for the express purpose of humiliating and insulting him.  The boys of your crowd gave him the cold shoulder when he tried to be  friendly and Grace was insufferably rude to him on two different  occasions.    \"Then you criticized my gowns and made fun of me behind my back, when in  reality I was the only one of you who was properly dressed. You left Mr.  Hammond and I both out of the pantomime, and made us last in everything.    \"I tried to forgive and forget it all, and be just the same to you, but  the first thing that Nora did when we reached Oakdale was to invite part  of the crowd to her house and leave the rest of us out, and I am  surprised that neither Miriam nor Eva resented the slight.\"    Here Grace and Miriam could not refrain from exchanging amused glances,  but to Marian, who intercepted their glances, this was the last straw.    Dashing the sorority pin which Nora had previously shoved into her hand  to the floor, with a sob of mingled anger and chagrin she exclaimed:    \"How dare you ridicule me to my very face! I never want to speak to any  of you again, and I shall not stay here to be laughed at.\"    With these words she fairly ran out of the room, and before any one  could expostulate with her, she had for the second time in three months  rushed out of the house and away from her real friends.    \"She is hopeless,\" sighed Grace, as they heard the outer door of the  hall close noisily.    \"Can you blame her?\" said Anne earnestly. \"She has been influenced all  along by that Henry Hammond, and now she has fallen into Eleanor's  hands. We know Eleanor's state of mind toward us, but why Henry Hammond  should encourage Marian to break with her sorority is harder to  understand. Yet he has undoubtedly used his influence against us for  some purpose of his own. Marian's accusations are foolish and unjust.  You all know that she was so engrossed with that miserable old trouble  maker that she repeatedly refused to take part in the different things  we planned.\"    \"Of course, we know that,\" agreed Grace. \"I don't even feel hurt at her  outburst to-night. I wouldn't think of accepting her resignation from  the Phi Sigma Tau, either. We won't try to make up with her, but we'll  all keep a starboard eye upon her, and see that she doesn't come to  grief.\"    \"I had almost reduced her to reason,\" remarked Anne, with a rueful  smile, \"when Nora unfortunately mentioned Eleanor.\"    \"Wasn't I an idiot, though?\" asked Nora. \"I forgot for the moment about  having seen them together.\"    \"I am going to turn detective,\" announced Grace.    \"Are you going to detect or deduct?\" asked Nora solemnly.    \"Both,\" replied Grace confidently. \"I am going to become a combination  of Nick Carter and Sherlock Holmes, and my first efforts will be  directed toward finding out who and what Mr. Henry Hammond really is.\"          CHAPTER XVI    THE UNEXPECTED HAPPENS      Grace lost no time in putting her resolution into practice, and left no  stone unturned regarding the object of her distrust. But her efforts met  with no better success than the first time she had instituted inquiry.    \"Why are you so bitter against that young man, daughter?\" asked her  father rather curiously when she interviewed him as to the best means of  finding out something of Henry Hammond's past. \"He seems to be a good  straight-forward young fellow.\"    \"He's a villain, I know he is,\" asserted Grace, \"but he's too sharp for  me.\"    \"Nonsense,\" laughed her father. \"Having no basketball this winter you  are bound to devote that surplus energy of yours to something. Are you  making Hammond your victim?\"    \"You may tease me if you like,\" replied Grace with dignity, \"but some  day you'll acknowledge that I was right.\"    \"All right, girlie,\" smiled her father. \"Shall I say so, now?\"    \"You're a dear,\" laughed Grace, rubbing her soft cheek against his.  \"Only you will tease.\"    Since the evening that Marian Barber had repudiated her sorority, none  of the members had spoken to her. She had studiously avoided going  within speaking distance of them and had divided her time after school  equally between Eleanor Savelli and Henry Hammond.    Eleanor had kept her word in reference to Edna Wright, and the two girls  exchanged only the barest civilities whenever they chanced to meet.  Eleanor had, however, gained considerable popularity with a number of  the senior class, and wielded a tremendous influence over them. She had  dropped her annoying tactics toward the teachers, and her conduct during  the year had been irreproachable.    Anne Pierson's assertion that Eleanor would be better off away from Edna  had proved true, and unconsciously the spoiled, temperamental girl was  receiving great benefit from her High School associations. She stood  next to Anne Pierson in her classes, and her aptitude for study and  brilliant recitations evoked the admiration of the entire class.    But despite these changes for the better, Eleanor still nursed her  grudge against the Phi Sigma Tau, and held to her unrelenting resolve to  be revenged upon them, individually or collectively, whenever the  opportunity should arise.    In cautioning her friends the previous year against placing themselves  in a position liable to put them at a disadvantage with Eleanor, Grace  had unwittingly divined the former's intentions.    Now that Marian had strayed away from the Phi Sigma Tau and straight to  their common enemy, Grace felt uneasy as to the result.    \"I don't know what to think about Marian's sudden intimacy with  Eleanor,\" she confided to Anne, one day at the beginning of the new  term.    \"So far nothing startling has happened,\" replied Anne. \"Really, Eleanor  happened along at a good time for Marian.\"    \"Why did she?\" asked Grace quickly.    \"Because I understand that she coached Marian in astronomy and just  simply made her cut out Henry Hammond for her books. It's due to Eleanor  that she passed,\" answered Anne.    \"I hadn't heard that,\" said Grace. \"Isn't Eleanor a wonder in her  studies? It's a pleasure to hear her recite.\"    \"I do admire her ability,\" agreed Anne. \"Perhaps she will see through  Henry Hammond and persuade Marian to drop him.\"    \"I don't know about that,\" said Grace dubiously. \"I saw him with Eleanor  in the run-about the other day. He was at the wheel, and they seemed to  be having a very interesting session without Marian.\"    \"He never did give me the impression of being a very constant swain,\"  laughed Anne.    \"I'm so glad that mid-year exams are over,\" sighed Grace. \"I'm a sure  enough graduate now, unless something serious happens.\"    \"So am I,\" replied Anne. \"If I could get clerical work to do this term  I'd recite in the morning only and give my afternoons to earning a  little money. It seems as though everything is against me. Did you know  that Mrs. Gray has postponed coming home until March?\"    \"Yes,\" answered Grace. She understood Anne's growing despair as time  went on, and the prospect of earning enough money to defray her college  expenses grew less.    \"I'm afraid I'll have to give it all up for next year at least, Grace,\"  Anne's voice trembled a little. \"But perhaps I can enter the year after.  I can't give up the idea of being in the same college with you.\"    \"Don't give up yet, dear,\" Grace pressed Anne's hand. \"Maybe the  unexpected will happen.\"    The girls separated at the corner and went their separate ways, Anne  with the conviction that there was no use in wishing for the impossible  and Grace deploring the fact that Anne was too proud to accept any help  from her friends.    As Grace was about to curl herself up in a big chair before the fire  that night with \"Richard Carvel\" in one hand and a box of peanut brittle  in the other, she was"]]]
