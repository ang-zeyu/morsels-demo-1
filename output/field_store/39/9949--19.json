Mannering, however, was determined in his  own mind not to expose the infant to the inconveniences which might have  arisen from his being supposed the object of evil prediction. He  therefore delivered the paper into Mr. Bertram's hand, and requested him  to keep it for five years with the seal unbroken, until the month of  November was expired. After that date had intervened he left him at  liberty to examine the writing, trusting that, the first fatal period  being then safely overpassed, no credit would be paid to its farther  contents. This Mr. Bertram was content to promise, and Mannering, to  ensure his fidelity, hinted at misfortunes which would certainly take  place if his injunctions were neglected. The rest of the day, which  Mannering, by Mr. Bertram's invitation, spent at Ellangowan, passed over  without anything remarkable; and on the morning of that which followed  the traveller mounted his palfrey, bade a courteous adieu to his  hospitable landlord and to his clerical attendant, repeated his good  wishes for the prosperity of the family, and then, turning his horse's  head towards England, disappeared from the sight of the inmates of  Ellangowan. He must also disappear from that of our readers, for it is to  another and later period of his life that the present narrative relates.          CHAPTER  VI         Next, the Justice,       In fair round belly with good capon lined,       With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,       Full of wise saws and modern instances--       And so he plays his part            --As You Like It      When Mrs. Bertram of Ellangowan was able to hear the news of what had  passed during her confinement, her apartment rung with all manner of  gossiping respecting the handsome young student from Oxford who had told  such a fortune by the stars to the young Laird, 'blessings on his dainty  face.' The form, accent, and manners of the stranger were expatiated  upon. His horse, bridle, saddle, and stirrups did not remain unnoticed.  All this made a great impression upon the mind of Mrs. Bertram, for the  good lady had no small store of superstition.    Her first employment, when she became capable of a little work, was to  make a small velvet bag for the scheme of nativity which she had obtained  from her husband. Her fingers itched to break the seal, but credulity  proved stronger than curiosity; and she had the firmness to inclose it,  in all its integrity, within two slips of parchment, which she sewed  round it to prevent its being chafed. The whole was then put into the  velvet bag aforesaid, and hung as a charm round the neck of the infant,  where his mother resolved it should remain until the period for the  legitimate satisfaction of her curiosity should arrive.    The father also resolved to do his part by the child in securing him a  good education; and, with the view that it should commence with the first  dawnings of reason, Dominie Sampson was easily induced to renounce his  public profession of parish schoolmaster, make his constant residence at  the Place, and, in consideration of a sum not quite equal to the wages of  a footman even at that time, to undertake to communicate to the future  Laird of Ellangowan all the erudition which he had, and all the graces  and accomplishments which--he had not indeed, but which he had never  discovered that he wanted. In this arrangement the Laird found also his  private advantage, securing the constant benefit of a patient auditor, to  whom he told his stories when they were alone, and at whose expense he  could break a sly jest when he had company.    About four years after this time a great commotion took place in the  county where Ellangowan is situated.    Those who watched the signs of the times had long been of opinion that a  change of ministry was about to take place; and at length, after a due  proportion of hopes, fears, and delays, rumours from good authority and  bad authority, and no authority at all; after some clubs had drank Up  with this statesman and others Down with him; after riding, and running,  and posting, and addressing, and counter-addressing, and proffers of  lives and fortunes, the blow was at length struck, the administration of  the day was dissolved, and parliament, as a natural consequence, was  dissolved also.    Sir Thomas Kittlecourt, like other members in the same situation, posted  down to his county, and met but an indifferent reception. He was a  partizan of the old administration; and the friends of the new had  already set about an active canvass in behalf of John Featherhead, Esq.,  who kept the best hounds and hunters in the shire. Among others who  joined the standard of revolt was Gilbert Glossin, writer in--, agent for  the Laird of Ellangowan. This honest gentleman had either been refused  some favour by the old member, or, what is as probable, he had got all  that he had the most distant pretension to ask, and could only look to  the other side for fresh advancement. Mr. Glossin had a vote upon  Ellangowan's property; and he was now determined that his patron should  have one also, there being no doubt which side Mr. Bertram would embrace  in the contest. He easily persuaded Ellangowan that it would be  creditable to him to take the field at the head of as strong a party as  possible; and immediately went to work, making votes, as every Scotch  lawyer knows how, by splitting and subdividing the superiorities upon  this ancient and once powerful barony. These were so extensive that, by  dint of clipping and paring here, adding and eking there, and creating  over-lords upon all the estate which Bertram held of the crown, they  advanced at the day of contest at the head of ten as good men of  parchment as ever took the oath of trust and possession. This strong  reinforcement turned the dubious day of battle. The principal and his  agent divided the honour; the reward fell to the latter exclusively. Mr.  Gilbert Glossin was made clerk of the peace, and Godfrey Bertram had his  name inserted in a new commission of justices, issued immediately upon  the sitting of the parliament.    This had been the summit of Mr. Bertram's ambition; not that he liked  either the trouble or the responsibility of the office, but he thought it  was a dignity to which he was well entitled, and that it had been  withheld from him by malice prepense. But there is an old and true Scotch  proverb, 'Fools should not have chapping sticks'; that is, weapons of  offence. Mr. Bertram was no sooner possessed of the judicial authority  which he had so much longed for than he began to exercise it with more  severity than mercy, and totally belied all the opinions which had  hitherto been formed of his inert good-nature. We have read somewhere of  a justice of peace who, on being nominated in the commission, wrote a  letter to a bookseller for the statutes respecting his official duty in  the following orthography--'Please send the ax relating to a gustus  pease.' No doubt, when this learned gentleman had possessed himself of  the axe, he hewed the laws with it to some purpose. Mr. Bertram was not  quite so ignorant of English grammar as his worshipful predecessor; but  Augustus Pease himself could not have used more indiscriminately the  weapon unwarily put into his hand.    In good earnest, he considered the commission with which he had been  entrusted as a personal mark of favour from his sovereign; forgetting  that he had formerly thought his being deprived of a privilege, or  honour, common to those of his rank was the result of mere party cabal.  He commanded his trusty aid-de-camp, Dominie Sampson, to read aloud the  commission; and at the first words, 'The King has been pleased to  appoint'--'Pleased!' he exclaimed in a transport of gratitude; 'honest  gentleman! I'm sure he cannot be better pleased than I am.'    Accordingly, unwilling to confine his gratitude to mere feelings or  verbal expressions, he gave full current to the new-born zeal of office,  and endeavoured to express his sense of the honour conferred upon him by  an unmitigated activity in the discharge of his duty. New brooms, it is  said, sweep clean; and I myself can bear witness that, on the arrival of  a new housemaid, the ancient, hereditary, and domestic spiders who have  spun their webs over the lower division of my bookshelves (consisting  chiefly of law and divinity) during the peaceful reign of her  predecessor, fly at full speed before the probationary inroads of the new  mercenary. Even so the Laird of Ellangowan ruthlessly commenced his  magisterial reform, at the expense of various established and  superannuated pickers and stealers who had been his neighbours for half a  century. He wrought his miracles like a second Duke Humphrey; and by the  influence of the beadle's rod caused the lame to walk, the blind to see,  and the palsied to labour. He detected poachers, black-fishers,  orchard-breakers, and pigeon-shooters; had the applause of the bench for  his reward, and the public credit of an active magistrate.    All this good had its rateable proportion of evil. Even an admitted  nuisance of ancient standing should not be abated without some caution.  The zeal of our worthy friend now involved in great distress sundry  personages whose idle and mendicant habits his own lachesse had  contributed to foster, until these habits had become irreclaimable, or  whose real incapacity for exertion rendered them fit objects, in their  own phrase, for the charity of all well-disposed Christians. The  'long-remembered beggar,' who for twenty years had made his regular  rounds within the neighbourhood, received rather as an humble friend than  as an object of charity, was sent to the neighbouring workhouse. The  decrepit dame, who travelled round the parish upon a hand-barrow,  circulating from house to house like a bad shilling, which every one is  in haste to pass to his neighbour,--she,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60235"],[0,"The Seventy's Course in Theology, First Year (#16)"],[1,"which the Lord sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharoah,  and to all his servants, and to all his land, and in all that mighty  hand, and in all the great terror which Moses showed in the sight of  all Israel.\"_--EZRA _(supposedly)_.    _NOTES._    1. _Abraham:_ \"He was a person of great sagacity, both for  understanding all things, and persuading his hearers, and not mistaken  in his opinions; for which reason he began to have higher notions of  virtue than others had, and he determined to renew and to change the  opinion all men happened then to have concerning God; for he was the  first that ventured to publish this notion, that there was but One  God, the Creator of the universe; and that as to other (gods), if  they contributed anything to the happiness of men, that each of them  afforded it only according to his appointment, and not by their own  power. This his opinion was derived from the irregular phenomena that  were visible both at land and sea, as well as those that happen to the  sun, and moon, and all the heavenly bodies; thus, \"if (said he) these  bodies had power of their own, they would certainly take care of their  own regular motions; but since they do not preserve such regularity,  they make it plain that so far as they co-operate to our advantage,  they do it not of their own abilities, but as they are subservient to  him that commands them, to whom alone we ought justly to offer our  honor and thanksgiving.\" For which doctrines, when the Chaldeans, and  other people of Mesopotamia, raised a tumult against him, he thought  fit to leave that country; and at the command, and by the assistance  of God, he came and lived in the land of Canaan. And when he was there  settled, he built an altar, and performed a sacrifice to God. Berosus  mentions our father Abram without naming him, when he says thus: \"In  the tenth generation after the flood, there was among the Chaldeans a  man, righteous and great, and skilful in the celestial science.\" But  Hecataeus does more than mention him; for he composed, and left behind  him, a book concerning him. And Nicolaus of Damascus, in the fourth  book of his history, says thus: 'Abram reigned at Damascus, being a  foreigner, who came with an army out of the land above Babylon, called  the land of the Chaldeans; but, after a long time, he got him up, and  removed from that country also, with his people, and went into the land  then called the land of Canaan, but now the land of Judea, and this  when his posterity were become a multitude; as to which posterity of  his, we relate their history in another work. Now the name of Abram is  even still famous in the country of Damascus; and there is showed a  village named from him, 'The habitation of Abram.'\" (Antiquities of the  Jews, Josephus, pp. 31-32.)    2. _The Restoration of Lands Made by Joseph:_ \"However, the famine  increased among the Egyptians; * * * * But when their money failed  them, they bought corn with their cattle, and their slaves, and if any  of them had a small piece of land, they gave up that to purchase them  food, by which means the king became the owner of all their substance;  and they were removed some to one place, and some to another, that so  the possession of their country might be firmly afforded to the king;  excepting the lands of the priests for their country continued still in  their own possession. And indeed this sore famine made their minds, as  well as their bodies, slaves: and at length compelled them to procure  a sufficiency of food by such dishonorable means. But when this misery  ceased, and the river overflowed the ground, and the ground brought  forth its fruits plentifully, Joseph came to every city, and gathered  the people thereto belonging together, and gave them back entirely the  land which, by their own consent, the king might have possessed alone,  and alone enjoyed the fruits of it. He also exhorted them to look on  it as every one's own possession; and to fall to their husbandry with  cheerfulness; and to pay as a tribute to the king, the fifth part of  the fruits for the land which the king when it was his own restored to  them. These men rejoiced upon their becoming unexpectedly owners of  their lands, and diligently observed what was enjoined them. And by  this means Joseph procured to himself a greater authority among the  Egyptians, and greater love to the king from them. Now this law, that  they should pay the fifth part of their fruits as tribute, continued  until their latter kings.\" (Josephus, Antiquities, p. 52.)    3. _Character of Moses._ \"Now Moses lived in all one hundred and  twenty years; a third part of which time, abating one month, he was  the people's ruler; and he died on the last month of the year, which  is called by the Macedonians 'Dystrus,' but by us 'Adar,' on the first  day of the month. He was one that exceeded all men that ever were,  in understanding, and made the best use of what that understanding  suggested to him. He had a very graceful way of speaking, in addressing  the multitude, and as to his other qualifications, he had such a full  command of his passions, as if he hardly had any such in his soul, and  only knew them by their names, as rather perceiving them in other men  than in himself. He was also such a general of an army as is seldom  seen, as well as such a prophet as was never known, and this to such  a degree, that whatsoever he pronounced you would think you heard the  voice of God himself. So the people mourned for him thirty days: nor  did ever any grief so deeply affect the Hebrews as did this upon the  death of Moses; nor were those that had experienced his conduct the  only persons that desired him, but those also that perused the laws he  left behind him, had a strong desire after him, and by them gathered  the extraordinary virtue he was master of. And this shall suffice  for the declaration of the manner of the death of Moses.\" (Josephus,  Antiquities of the Jews, p. 98.)    4. _The Greatness and Influence of Moses._ \"Where shall we find one  that combines in his personality so many greatnesses as Moses, if I may  say so? He was the liberator of his people, but he spurned crowns and  scepters, and did not, as many others after him did, put a new yoke  on the neck from which he had taken the old one. * * * * * And his  republic was not of short duration. It lasted through all the storms of  barbaric wars and revolutions--hundreds of years, down to the days of  Samuel, that all-stout-hearted republican who could endure no kings. *  * * * But the republic he founded stands unique in the history of the  world, for it was altogether based upon an idea--the idea of the unity  of God and the righteousness of his will. Think of it! Among a nation  escaped from bondage, too degraded even to be led to war, that needed  the education, the hammering, as it were, into a people for forty  years, to go among them with the sublimest truth that the human mind  ever can conceive and to say of them: 'Though you are now benighted and  enslaved, any truth that I know is not too good for you nor any child  of God.\" * * * * As a teacher of morality why need I praise him? As  a teacher of statecraft in the highest and best sense, who surpassed  him? The great wonder is that that man speaks the language of today.  The problems which we have not yet succeeded in solving were already  present to his mind, and he founded a nation in which the difference  between the poor and the rich was almost abolished. The laborer was  not only worthy but sure of his hire. No aristocrat could rule over  his subjects and no priesthood could ever assume the government which,  alas! according to history, means the opposition of the nation. How did  that man of that vast mind, how did he combine all these great talents?  And yet that man, how tender his heart was! Why, friends, it is a  thousand pities that you cannot hear the deep sorrow, the sadness that  is to be heard in his original words. When an over-zealous disciple  came to him and told that they were prophesying in his name, and they  said: 'Hinder them, master, hinder them. Why, if they prophesy what  will become of thine own authority?' I fancy I see his venerable head  sink upon his breast and he saying: 'Indeed art thou zealous for me?  Would that all the people of God were prophets, and that God gave his  Spirit to them.'\" (Rabbi Gottheil, The World's Parliament of Religions,  (Barrows), pp. 674-5.)    Footnotes    1.
