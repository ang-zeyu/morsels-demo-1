For who so lustily desireth to  be worshipped, favoured, and served of men here in earth, they  deserve to forego the worship, the favour, and service of angel in  ghostly contemplation of heaven and of heavenly things, all their  lifetime; the which contemplation is better and more worthy in  itself than is the lust and the liking of devotion. And for this  bitterness I clepe the spirit of malice, of wrath, and of wickedness  the worst spirit of them all; and why? Certes, for it reaveth us the  best thing of all, and that is charity, the which is God. For who so  lacketh peace and restfulness of heart, him lacketh the lively  presence of the lovely sight of the high peace of heaven, good  gracious God His own dear self. This witnesseth David in the psalm,  where he saith, that the place of God is made in peace, and His  dwelling place in Sion.[294] Sion is as much to say as the sight of  peace; the sight of the soul is the thought of that same soul; and,  certes, in that soul that most is occupied in thoughts of peace hath  God made His dwelling place.[295] And thus saith Himself by the  prophet, when he saith: \"Upon whom shall my spirit rest, but upon  the meek and the restful.\"[296] And, therefore, who so will have God  continually dwelling in him, and live in love and in sight of the  high peace of the Godhead, the which is the highest and the best  party of contemplation that may be had in this life, be he busy  night and day to put down, when they come, the spirit of the flesh  and the spirit of the world, but most busily the spirit of malice,  of wrath, and of wickedness, for he is the foulest and the worst  filth[297] of all. And it is full needful and speedful to know his  quaintise, and not for to unknow his doleful deceits. For sometime  he will, that wicked cursed wight, change his likeness in to an  angel of light, that he may under colour of virtue do more  dere;[298] but yet then, if we look more redely,[299] it is but seed  of bitterness and of discord that that he sheweth, seem it never so  holy nor never so fair at the first shewing. Full many he stirreth  unto singular holiness passing the common statute and custom of  their degree, as is fasting, sharp wearing, and many other devout  observances and outward doings, in open reproving of other men's  defaults, the which they have not of office for to do. All such and  many other he stirreth them for to do, and all under colour of  devotion and of charity; not for he is delighted in any deed of  devotion and of charity, but for he loveth dissension and slander,  the which is evermore caused by such unseemly singularities; for  where so ever that any one or two are in any devout congregation,  the which any one or two useth any such outward singularities, then  in the sight of fools all the remenant are slandered by them; but,  in the sight of the wise man, they slander themselves. But for  because that fools are more than wise men, therefore for favour of  fools such singular doers ween that they be wise, when (if it were  wisely determined) they and all their fautors[300] should be seen  apert fools, and darts shot of the devil, to slay true simple souls  under colour of holiness and charity. And thus many deceits can the  fiend bring in on this manner.    Who so will not consent, but meeketh him truly to prayer and to  counsel, shall graciously be delivered of all these deceits.[301]  But it is sorrow for to say, and more for to feel, that  sometime[302] our own spirit is so overcome peradventure with each  of these three spirits, of the flesh, of the world, and of the  fiend, and so brought into danger, bounden in bondage, in thraldom  and in service of them all, that sorrow it is to wit. In great  confusion and loss of itself, it doth now the office of each one of  them itself in itself. And this befalleth when, after long use, and  customable consenting unto them when they come, at the last it is  made so fleshly, so worldly, and so malicious, so wicked, and so  froward, that now plainly of itself, without suggestion of any other  spirit, it gendereth and bringeth forth in itself, not only lusty  thoughts of the flesh, and vain thoughts of the world, but that  worst of all these, as are bitter thoughts and wicked, in backbiting  and deeming, and evil suspicion of others. And when it is thus with  our spirit, then, I trow, it may not lightly be known when it is our  own spirit that speaketh, or when it heareth any of the other three  spirits speaking in it as it is touched before. But what maketh it  matter[303] who speaketh, when it is all one and the same thing that  is spoken? What helpeth to know the person of him that speaketh,  when it is siker and certain that all is evil and perilous that is  spoken? If it be thine enemy, consent not to him, but meek thee to  prayer and to counsel, and so mayst thou mightily withstand thine  enemy. If it be thine own spirit, reprove him bitterly, and  sighingly sorrow that ever thou fell in[304] so great wretchedness,  bondage, and thraldom of the devil. Shrive thee of thy customed  consents, and of thine old sins, and so mayst thou come (by grace)  to recover thy freedom again; and by the gracious freedom mayst thou  soon come to, wisely for to know, and soothfastly for to feel by the  proof, when it is thine own spirit that speaketh these evils, or it  be these other evil spirits that speaketh them in thee. And so may  this knowing be a sovereign mean and help of againstanding, for  often times unknowing is cause of much error, and, againward,  knowing is cause of much truth; and to this manner of knowing mayst  thou win thus as I say to thee.    If thou be in doubt or in were[305] of these evil thoughts when they  come, whether that they be the speech of thine own spirit, or of any  of the others of thine enemies; look then busily by the witness of  thy counsel and thy conscience, if thou have been shriven and  lawfully amended after the doom[306] of thy confessor, of all the  consents that ever thou consented to that kind of sin, that thy  thought is aware of. And if thou have not been shriven shrive thee  then, as truly as thou mayst, by grace and by counsel; and then wete  thou right well that all the thoughts that come to thee after thy  shrift, stirring thee oft times to the same sins, they are the words  of other spirits than thine own (I mean some of the three touched  before). And thou for none such thoughts, be they never so thick, so  foul, nor so many (I mean for their first coming in), but if it be  for recklessness of againstanding,[307] art no blame worthy. And not  only releasing of purgatory that thou hast deserved for the same  sins done before, what so they be, thou mayst deserve, if thou  stiffly againstand them, but also much grace in this life, and much  meed in the bliss of heaven. But all those evil thoughts coming in  to thee, stirring thee to any sin, after that thou hast consented to  that same sin, and before that thou hast sorrow for that consent,  and art in will to be shriven thereof, it is no peril to thee to  take them to thyself,[308] and for to shrive thee of them, as of  thoughts of thine own spirit; but for to take to thyself all other  thoughts, the which thou hast by very proof, as it is shewed before,  by the speeches of other spirits than of thyself, therein lieth  great peril, for so mightest thou lightly misrule thy conscience,  charging a thing for sin the which is none; and this were great  error, and a mean to the greatest peril. For if it were so that each  evil thought and stirring to sin were the work and the speech of  none other spirit, but only of man's own spirit; then it would  follow by that that a man's own spirit were a very fiend, the which  is apertly false and a damnable woodness;[309] for though all it be  so that a soul may, by frailty and custom of sinning, fall in to so  much wretchedness, that it taketh on itself by bondage of sin the  office of the devil, stirring itself to sin ever more and more,  without any suggestion of any other spirit (as it is said before),  yet it is not therefore a devil in kind, but it is a devil in  office, and may be cleped devilish, for it is in the doing like to  the devil, [that is to say, a stirrer of itself unto sin, the which  is the office of the devil].[310] Nevertheless yet, for all this  thraldom to sin and devilishness in office, it may by grace of  contrition, of shrift, and of amending, recover the freedom again,  and be made saveable--yea, and a full special God's saint in this  life, that before was full damnable and full cursed in the  living.[311] And, therefore, as great a peril as it is a soul that  is fallen in sin, not for to charge his conscience therewith, nor  for to amend him thereof, as great a peril it is, and, if it may be  said, a greater, a man for to charge his conscience with each  thought and stirring of sin that will come in him; for, by such nice  charging of conscience, might he lightly run in to error of  conscience, and so be led in to despair all his life time. And the  cause of all this is lacking of knowing of discretion of spirits,  the which knowing may be gotten by very experience; who so redely  will look soon after that a soul have been truly cleansed by  confession as it is said before. For fast after confession a soul  is, as it were, a clean paper leaf, for ableness that it hath to  receive what that men will write thereupon. Both they do press[312]  for to write on the soul, when it is clean in itself made by  confession: God and His angel on the one party, and the fiend and  his angel on the other party; but it is in the free choice of the  soul to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45456"],[0,"History of Julius Cæsar, Vol. 1 of 2 (#16)"],[1," shall see, not without a feeling of regret, vast countries where  formerly produce, monuments, riches, numerous armies and fleets--all,  indeed, revealed an advanced state of civilisation--now deserts or in a  state of barbarism.    The Mediterranean had seen grow and prosper in turn on its coasts Sidon,  and Tyre, and then Greece.    [Illustration: MAP OF THE BASIN OF THE MEDITERRANEAN.]    Sidon, already a flourishing city before the time of Homer, is soon  eclipsed by the supremacy of Tyre; then Greece comes to carry on, in  competition with her, the commerce of the interior sea; an age of  pacific greatness and fruitful rivalries. To the Phoenicians  chiefly, the South, the East, Africa, Asia beyond Mount Taurus, the  Erythrean Sea (_the Red Sea_ and _the Persian Gulf_), the ocean, and the  distant voyages. To the Greeks, all the northern coasts, which they  covered with their thousand settlements. Phoenicia devotes herself to  adventurous enterprises and lucrative speculations. Greece, artistic  before becoming a trader, propagates by her colonies her mind and her  ideas.    This fortunate emulation soon disappears before the creation of two new  colonies sprung from their bosom. The splendour of Carthage replaces  that of Tyre. Alexandria is substituted for Greece. Thus a Western or  Spanish Phoenicia shares the commerce of the world with an Eastern and  Egyptian Greece, the fruit of the intellectual conquests of Alexander.      [Sidenote: Northern Africa.]    II. Rich in the spoils of twenty different peoples, Carthage was the  proud capital of a vast empire. Its ports, hollowed out by the hand of  man, were capable of containing a great number of ships.[242] Her  citadel, Byrsa, was two miles in circuit. On the land side the town was  defended by a triple enclosure twenty-five stadia in length, thirty  cubits high, and supported by towers of four storeys, capable of giving  shelter to 4,000 horse, 300 elephants, and 20,000 foot soldiers;[243] it  enclosed an immense population, since, in the last years of its  resistance, after a struggle of a century, it still counted 700,000  inhabitants.[244] Its monuments were worthy of its greatness: among its  remarkable buildings was the temple of the god Aschmoun, assimilated by  the Greeks to AEsculapius;[245] that of the sun, covered with plates of  gold valued at a thousand talents;[246] and the mantle or _peplum_,  destined for the image of their great goddess, which cost a hundred and  twenty.[247] The empire of Carthage extended from the frontiers of  Cyrenaica (the country of _Barca_, in the regency of Tripoli) into  Spain; she was the metropolis of all the north of Africa, and, in Libya  alone, possessed three hundred towns.[248] Nearly all the isles of the  Mediterranean, to the west and south of Italy, had received her  factories. Carthage had imposed her sovereignty upon all the ancient  Phoenician establishments in this part of the world, and had levied  upon them an annual contingent of soldiers and tribute. In the interior  of Africa, she sent caravans to seek elephants, ivory, gold, and black  slaves, which she afterwards exported[249] to the trading places on the  Mediterranean. In Sicily, she gathered oil and wine; in the isle of  Elba, she mined for iron; from Malta, she drew valuable tissues; from  Corsica, wax and honey; from Sardinia, corn, metals, and slaves; from  the Baleares, mules and fruits; from Spain, gold, silver, and lead; from  Mauritania, the hides of animals; she sent as far as the extremity of  Britain, to the Cassiterides (_the Scilly Islands_), ships to purchase  tin.[250] Within her walls industry flourished greatly, and tissues of  great celebrity were fabricated.[251]    No market of the ancient world could be compared with that of Carthage,  to which men of all nations crowded. Greeks, Gauls, Ligurians,  Spaniards, Libyans, came in multitudes to serve under her standard;[252]  the Numidians lent her a redoubtable cavalry.[253] Her fleet was  formidable; it amounted at this epoch to five hundred vessels. Carthage  possessed a considerable arsenal;[254] we may appreciate its importance  from the fact, that, after her conquest by Scipio, she delivered to him  two hundred thousand suits of armour, and three thousand machines of  war.[255] So many troops and stores imply immense revenues. Even after  the battle of Zama, Polybius could still call her the richest town in  the world. Yet she had already paid heavy contributions to the  Romans.[256] An excellent system of agriculture contributed no less than  her commerce to her prosperity. A great number of agricultural  colonies[257] had been established, which, in the time of Agathocles,  amounted to more than two hundred. They were ruined by the war (440 of  Rome).[258] Byzacena (_the southern part of the regency of Tunis_) was  the granary of Carthage.[259]    This province, surnamed _Emporia_, as being the trading country _par  excellence_, vaunted by the geographer Scylax[260] as the most  magnificent and fertile part of Libya. It had, in the time of Strabo,  numerous towns, so many magazines of the merchandise of the interior of  Africa. Polybius[261] speaks of its horses, oxen, sheep, and goats, as  forming innumerable herds, such as he had never seen elsewhere. The  small town of Leptis alone paid to the Carthaginians the enormous  contribution of a talent a day (5,821 francs [L232 16s.]).[262]    This fertility of Africa explains the importance of the towns on the  coast of the Syrtes, an importance, it is true, revealed by later  testimonies, because they date from the decline of Carthage, but which  must apply still more forcibly to the flourishing condition which  preceded it. In 537, the vast port of the isle Cercina (Kirkeni, in the  regency of Tunis, opposite Sfax) had paid ten talents to Servilius.[263]  More to the west, Hippo Regius (_Bona_) was still a considerable  maritime town in the time of Jugurtha.[264] Tingis (_Tangiers_), in  Mauritania, which boasted of a very ancient origin, carried on a great  trade with Baetica. Three African peoples in these countries lay under  the influence and often the sovereignty of Carthage: the Massylian  Numidians, who afterwards had Cirta (_Constantine_) for their capital;  the Massaesylian Numidians, who occupied the provinces of Algiers and  Oran; and the Mauri, or Moors, spread over Morocco. These nomadic  peoples maintained rich droves of cattle, and grew great quantities of  corn.    Hanno, a Carthaginian sea-captain, sent, towards 245, to explore the  extreme parts of the African coast beyond the Straits of Gades, had  founded a great number of settlements, no traces of which remained in  the time of Pliny.[265] These colonies introduced commerce among the  Mauritanian and Numidian tribes, the peoples of Morocco, and perhaps  even those of Senegal. But it was not only in Africa that the  possessions of the Carthaginians extended; they embraced Spain, Sicily,  and Sardinia.      [Sidenote: Spain.]    III. Iberia or Spain, with its six great rivers, navigable to the  ancients, its long chains of mountains, its dense woods, and the fertile  valleys of Baetica (_Andalusia_), appears to have nourished a population  numerous, warlike, rich by its mines, its harvests, and its commerce.  The centre of the peninsula was occupied by the Iberian and Celtiberian  races; on the coasts, the Carthaginians and the Greeks had settlements;  through contact with the Phoenician merchants, the populations of the  coast districts attained a certain degree of civilisation, and from the  mixture of the natives with the foreign colonists sprang a mongrel  population, which, while it preserved the Iberic character, had adopted  the mercantile habits of the Phoenicians and Carthaginians.    Once established in Spain, the Carthaginians and Greeks turned to useful  purpose the timber which covered the mountains. Gades (_Cadiz_), a sort  of factory founded at the extremity of Baetica by the Carthaginians,  became one of their principal maritime arsenals. It was there that the  ships were fitted out which ventured on the ocean in search of the  products of Armorica, or Britain, and even of the Canaries. Although  Gades had lost some of its importance by the foundation of Carthagena  (_New Carthage_), in 526, it had still, in the time of Strabo, so  numerous a population that it was in this respect inferior only to Rome.  The tables of the census showed five hundred citizens of the equestrian  order, a number equalled by none of the Italian cities, except Patavium  (_Padua_).[266] To Gades, celebrated for its temple of Hercules, flowed  the riches of all Spain. The sheep and horses of Baetica rivalled in  renown those of the Asturias. Corduba (_Cordova_), Hispalis (_Seville_),  where, at a later period, the Romans founded colonies, were already  great places of commerce, and had ports for the vessels which ascended  the Baetis (_Guadalquivir_).[267]    Spain was rich in precious metals; gold, silver, iron, were there the  object of industrial activity.[268] At Osca (_Huesca_), they worked  mines of silver; at Sisapo (_Almaden_), silver and mercury.[269] At  Cotinae, copper was found along with gold. Among the Oretani, at Castulo  (_Cazlona_, on the Guadalimar), the silver mines, in the time of  Polybius, gave employment to 40,000 persons, and produced daily 25,000  drachmas.[270] In thirty-two years, the Roman generals carried home from  the peninsula considerable sums.[271] The abundance of metals in Spain  explains how so great a number of vessels of gold and silver was found  among many of the chiefs or petty kings of the Iberian nations. Polybius  compares one of them, for his luxury, with the king of the fabulous  Phaeaces.[272]    To the north, and in the centre of the peninsula, agriculture and the  breeding of cattle were the principal sources of wealth. It was there  that were made the says (vests of flannel or goats' hair), which"]]]
