[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6782"],[0,"The Robbers (#16)"],[1,"with you. Maximilian von Moor is gone to the tomb of his  ancestors. I am master. But I wish--to be so in the fullest sense,  Amelia. You know what you have been to our house always regarded as  Moor's daughter, his love for you will survive even death itself; that,  assuredly, you will never forget?    AMELIA. Never, never! Who could be so unfeeling as to drown the memory  of it in festive banqueting?    FRANCIS. It is your duty to repay the love of the father to his sons;  and Charles is dead. Ha! you are struck with amazement; dizzy with the  thought! To be sure 'tis a flattering and an elating prospect which may  well overpower the pride of a woman. Francis tramples under foot the  hopes of the noblest and the richest, and offers his heart, his hand,  and with them all his gold, his castles, and his forests to a poor, and,  but for him, destitute orphan. Francis--the feared--voluntarily  declares himself Amelia's slave!    AMELIA. Why does not a thunderbolt cleave the impious tongue which  utters the criminal proposal! Thou hast murdered my beloved Charles;  and shall Amelia, his betrothed, call thee husband? Thou?    FRANCIS. Be not so violent, most gracious princess! It is true that  Francis does not come before you like a whining Celadon--'tis true he  has not learned, like a lovesick swain of Arcadia, to sigh forth his  amorous plaints to the echo of caves and rocks. Francis speaks--and,  when not answered, commands!    AMELIA. Commands? thou reptile! Command me? And what if I laughed  your command to scorn?    FRANCIS. That you will hardly do. There are means, too, which I know  of, admirably adapted to humble the pride of a capricious, stubborn  girl--cloisters and walls!    AMELIA. Excellent! delightful! to be forever secure within cloisters  and walls from thy basilisk look, and to have abundant leisure to think  and dream of Charles. Welcome with your cloister! welcome your walls!    FRANCIS. Ha! Is that it? Beware! Now you have taught me the art of  tormenting you. The sight of me shall, like a fiery-haired fury, drive  out of your head these eternal phantasies of Charles. Francis shall be  the dread phantom ever lurking behind the image of your beloved, like  the fiend-dog that guards the subterranean treasure. I will drag you to  church by the hair, and sword in hand wring the nuptial vow from your  soul. By main force will I ascend your virginal couch, and storm your  haughty modesty with still greater haughtiness.    AMELIA (gives him a slap in the face). Then take that first by way of  dowry!    FRANCIS. Ha! I will be tenfold, and twice tenfold revenged for this!  My wife! No, that honor you shall never enjoy. You shall be my  mistress, my strumpet! The honest peasant's wife shall point her finger  at you as she passes you in the street. Ay, gnash your teeth as  fiercely as you please--scatter fire and destruction from your eyes--  the fury of a woman piques my fancy--it makes you more beautiful, more  tempting. Come, this resistance will garnish my triumph, and your  struggles give zest to my embraces. Come, come to my chamber--I burn  with desire. Come this instant. (Attempts to drag her away).    AMELIA (falls on his neck). Forgive me, Francis! (As he is about to  clasp her in his arms, she suddenly draws the sword at his side, and  hastily disengages herself). Do you see now, miscreant, how I am able  to deal with you? I am only a woman, but a woman enraged. Dare to  approach, and this steel shall strike your lascivious heart to the core  --the spirit of my uncle will guide my hand. Avaunt, this instant!  (She drives him away).    Ah! how different I feel! Now I breathe again--I feel strong as the  snorting steed, ferocious as the tigress when she springs upon the  ruthless destroyer of her cubs. To a cloister, did he say? I thank  thee for the happy thought! Now has disappointed love found a place of  refuge--the cloister--the Redeemer's bosom is the sanctuary of  disappointed love. (She is on the point going).            . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    In the acting edition the following scene occurs between Herman and  Francis, immediately before that with Amelia. As Schiller himself  thought this among the happiest of his additions, and regretted that it  was \"entirely and very unfortunately overlooked in the first edition,\"  it seems desirable to introduce it here as well as the soliloquy  immediately following, which has acquired some celebrity.                        SCENE VIII.                   Enter HERMANN.    FRANCIS. Ha! Welcome, my Euryalus! My prompt and trusty instrument!    HERMANN (abruptly and peevishly). You sent for me, count--why?    FRANCIS. That you might put the seal to your master-piece.    HERMANN (gruffly). Indeed?    FRANCIS. Give the picture its finishing touch.    HERMANN. Poh! Poh!    FRANCIS (startled). Shall I call the carriage? We'll arrange the  business during the drive?    HERMANN (scornfully). No ceremony, sir, if you please. For any  business we may have to arrange there is room enough between these four  walls. At all events I'll just say a few words to you by way of  preface, which may save your lungs some unnecessary exertion.    FRANCIS (reservedly). Hum! And what may those words be?    HERMANN (with bitter irony). \"You shall have Amelia--and that from my  hand--\"    FRANCIS (with astonishment). Hermann!    HERMANN (as before, with his back turned on FRANCIS). \"Amelia will  become the plaything of my will--and you may easily guess the rest-in  short all will go as we wish\" (Breaks into an indignant laugh, and then  turns haughtily to FRANCIS.) Now, Count von Moor, what have you to say  to me?    FRANCIS (evasively). To thee? Nothing. I had something to say to  Hermann.--    HERMANN, No evasion. Why was I sent for hither? Was it to be your dupe  a second time! and to hold the ladder for a thief to mount? to sell my  soul for a hangman s fee? What else did you want with me?    FRANCIS (as if recollecting). Ha! It just occurs to me! We must not  forget the main point. Did not my steward mention it to you? I wanted  to talk to you about the dowry.    HERMANN. This is mere mockery sir; or, if not mockery, something worse.  Moor, take care of yourself-beware how you kindle my fury, Moor. We are  alone! And I have still an unsullied name to stake against yours!  Trust not the devil, although he be of your own raising.    FRANCIS (with dignity). Does this deportment become thee towards thy  sovereign and gracious master? Tremble, slave!    HERMANN (ironically). For fear of your displeasure, I suppose? What  signifies your displeasure to a man who is at war with himself? Fie,  Moor. I already abhor you as a villain; let me not despise you for a  fool. I can open graves, and restore the dead to life! Which of us now  is the slave?    FRANCIS (in a conciliating tone). Come, my good friend, be discreet,  and do not prove faithless.    HERMANN. Pshaw! To expose a wretch like you is here the best  discretion--to keep faith with you would be an utter want of sense.  Faith? with whom? Faith with the prince of liars? Oh, I shudder at the  thought of such faith. A very little timely faithlessness would have  almost made a saint of me. But patience! patience! Revenge is cunning  in resources.    FRANCIS. Ah, by-the-by, I just remember. You lately lost a purse with  a hundred louis in it, in this apartment. I had almost forgotten it.  Here, my good friend! take back what belongs to you. (Offers him a  purse).    HERMANN (throws it scornfully at his feet). A curse on your Judas  bribe! It is the earnest-money of hell. You once before thought to  make my poverty a pander to my conscience--but you were mistaken, count!  egregiously mistaken. That purse of gold came most opportunely--to  maintain certain persons.    FRANCIS (terrified). Hermann! Hermann! Let me not suspect certain  things of you. Should you have done anything contrary to my  instructions--you would be the vilest of traitors!    HERMANN (exultingly). Should I? Should I really? Well then count,  let me give you a little piece of information! (Significantly.) I will  fatten up your infamy, and add fuel to your doom. The book of your  misdeeds shall one day be served up as a banquet, and all the world be  invited to partake of it. (Contemptuously.) Do you understand me now,  my most sovereign, gracious, and excellent master?    FRANCIS (starts up, losing all command of himself). Ha! Devil!  Deceitful impostor! (Striking his forehead.) To think that I should  stake my fortune on the caprice of an idiot! That was madness! (Throws  himself, in great excitement, on a couch.)    HERMANN (whistles through his fingers). Wheugh! the biter bit!--    FRANCIS (biting his lip). But it is true, and ever will be true--that  there is no thread so feebly spun, or which snaps asunder so readily, as  that which weaves the bands of guilt!--    HERMANN. Gently! Gently! Are angels, then, superseded, that devils  turn moralists?    FRANCIS (starts up abruptly; to HERMANN with a malignant laugh). And  certain persons will no doubt acquire much honor by making the  discovery?    HERMANN (clapping his hands). Masterly! Inimitable! You play your  part to admiration! First you lure the credulous fool into the slough,  and then chuckle at the success of your malice, and cry \"Woe be to you  sinner!\" (Laughing and clenching his teeth.) Oh, how cleverly these  imps off the devil manoeuvre. But, count (clapping him on the shoulder)  you have not yet got your lesson quite perfect--by Heavens! You first  learn what the losing gamester will hazard. Set fire to the  powder-magazine, says the pirate, and blow all to hell--both friend  and foe!    FRANCIS (runs to the wall, and takes down a pistol). Here is treason!  I must be resolute--    HERMANN (draws a pistol as quickly from his pocket, and presents it at  him). Don't trouble yourself--one must be prepared for everything with  you.    FRANCIS (lets the pistol fall,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6788"],[0,"Wilhelm Tell (#16)"],[1,"have been swept away.       [TELL rises.    ARMGART (coming forward).  The viceroy not arrived?    STUSSI.               And do you seek him?    ARMGART.  Alas, I do!    STUSSI.         But why thus place yourself  Where you obstruct his passage down the pass?    ARMGART.  Here he cannot escape me. He must hear me.    FRIESSHARDT (coming hastily down the pass, and calls upon the stage).  Make way, make way! My lord, the governor,  Is coming down on horseback close behind me.                        [Exit TELL.    ARMGART (with animation).  The viceroy comes!       [She goes towards the pass with her children.     GESSLER and RUDOLPH DER HARRAS appear upon the     heights on horseback.    STUSSI (to FRIESSHARDT).            How got ye through the stream  When all the bridges have been carried down?    FRIESSHARDT.  We've battled with the billows; and, my friend,  An Alpine torrent's nothing after that.    STUSSI.  How! Were you out, then, in that dreadful storm?    FRIESSHARDT.  Ay, that we were! I shall not soon forget it.    STUSSI.  Stay, speak----    FRIESSHARDT.          I cannot. I must to the castle,  And tell them that the governor's at hand.                        [Exit.    STUSSI.  If honest men, now, had been in the ship,  It had gone down with every soul on board:--  Some folks are proof 'gainst fire and water both.       [Looking round.    Where has the huntsman gone with whom I spoke?                         [Exit.       Enter GESSLER and RUDOLPH DER HARRAS on horseback.    GESSLER.  Say what you please; I am the emperor's servant,  And my first care must be to do his pleasure.  He did not send me here to fawn and cringe  And coax these boors into good humor. No!  Obedience he must have. We soon shall see  If king or peasant is to lord it here?    ARMGART.  Now is the moment! Now for my petition!    GESSLER.  'Twas not in sport that I set up the cap  In Altdorf--or to try the people's hearts--  All this I knew before. I set it up  That they might learn to bend those stubborn necks  They carry far too proudly--and I placed  What well I knew their eyes could never brook  Full in the road, which they perforce must pass,  That, when their eyes fell on it, they might call  That lord to mind whom they too much forget.    HARRAS.  But surely, sir, the people have some rights----    GESSLER.  This is no time to settle what they are.  Great projects are at work, and hatching now;  The imperial house seeks to extend its power.  Those vast designs of conquests, which the sire  Has gloriously begun, the son will end.  This petty nation is a stumbling-block--  One way or other it must be subjected.       [They are about to pass on. ARMMGART throws herself     down before GESSLER.    ARMGART.  Mercy, lord governor! Oh, pardon, pardon!    GESSLER.  Why do you cross me on the public road?  Stand back, I say.    ARMGART.            My husband lies in prison;  My wretched orphans cry for bread. Have pity,  Pity, my lord, upon our sore distress!    HARRAS.  Who are you, woman; and who is your husband?    ARMGART.  A poor wild hay-man of the Rigiberg,  Kind sir, who on the brow of the abyss,  Mows down the grass from steep and craggy shelves,  To which the very cattle dare not climb.    HARRAS (to GESSLER).  By Heaven! a sad and miserable life!  I prithee, give the wretched man his freedom.  How great soever his offence may be,  His horrid trade is punishment enough.       [To ARMGART.    You shall have justice. To the castle bring  Your suit. This is no place to deal with it.    ARMGART.  No, no, I will not stir from where I stand,  Until your grace restore my husband to me.  Six months already has he been in prison,  And waits the sentence of a judge in vain.    GESSLER.  How! Would you force me, woman? Hence! Begone!    ARMGART.  Justice, my lord! Ay, justice! Thou art judge!  The deputy of the emperor--of Heaven!  Then do thy duty, as thou hopest for justice  From Him who rules above, show it to us!    GESSLER.  Hence! drive this daring rabble from my sight!    ARMGART (seizing his horse's reins).  No, no, by Heaven, I've nothing more to lose.  Thou stirrest not, viceroy, from this spot until  Thou dost me fullest justice. Knit thy brows,  And roll thy eyes; I fear not. Our distress  Is so extreme, so boundless, that we care  No longer for thine anger.    GESSLER.                Woman, hence!  Give way, I say, or I will ride thee down.    ARMGART.  Well, do so; there!       [Throws her children and herself upon the ground before him.               Here on the ground I lie,  I and my children. Let the wretched orphans  Be trodden by thy horse into the dust!  It will not be the worst that thou hast done.    HARRAS.  Are you mad, woman?    ARMGART (continuing with vehemence).             Many a day thou hast  Trampled the emperor's lands beneath thy feet.  Oh, I am but a woman! Were I man,  I'd find some better thing to do, than here  Lie grovelling in the dust.       [The music of the wedding party is again heard     from the top of the pass, but more softly.    GESSLER.                 Where are my knaves?  Drag her away, lest I forget myself,  And do some deed I may repent hereafter.    HARRAS.  My lord, the servants cannot force a passage;  The pass is blocked up by a marriage party.    GESSLER.  Too mild a ruler am I to this people,  Their tongues are all too bold; nor have they yet  Been tamed to due submission, as they shall be.  I must take order for the remedy;  I will subdue this stubborn mood of theirs,  And crush the soul of liberty within them.  I'll publish a new law throughout the land;  I will----       [An arrow pierces him,--he puts his hand on his heart,     and is about to sink--with a feeble voice.         Oh God, have mercy on my soul!    HARRAS.  My lord! my lord! Oh God! What's this? Whence came it?    ARMGART (starts up).  Dead, dead! He reels, he falls! 'Tis in his heart!    HARRAS (springs from his horse).  This is most horrible! Oh Heavens! sir knight,  Address yourself to God and pray for mercy;  You are a dying man.    GESSLER.             That shot was Tell's.       [He slides from his horse into the arms of RUDOLPH     DER HARRAS, who lays him down upon the bench. TELL     appears above, upon the rocks.    TELL.  Thou knowest the archer, seek no other hand.  Our cottages are free, and innocence  Secure from thee: thou'lt be our curse no more.       [TELL disappears. People rush in.    STUSSI.  What is the matter? Tell me what has happened?    ARMGART.  The governor is shot,--killed by an arrow!    PEOPLE (running in).  Who has been shot?       [While the foremost of the marriage party are coming     on the stage, the hindmost are still upon the heights.     The music continues.    HARRAS.             He's bleeding fast to death.  Away, for help--pursue the murderer!  Unhappy man, is't thus that thou must die?  Thou wouldst not heed the warnings that I gave thee!    STUSSI.  By heaven, his cheek is pale! His life ebbs fast.    MANY VOICES.  Who did the deed?    HARRAS.            What! Are the people mad  That they make music to a murder? Silence!       [Music breaks off suddenly. People continue to flock in.    Speak, if thou canst, my lord. Hast thou no charge  To intrust me with?       [GESSLER makes signs with his hand, which he repeats     with vehemence, when he finds they are not understood.               What would you have me do?  Shall I to Kuessnacht? I can't guess your meaning.  Do not give way to this impatience. Leave  All thoughts of earth and make your peace with Heaven.       [The whole marriage party gather round the dying man.    STUSSI.  See there! how pale he grows! Death's gathering now  About his heart; his eyes grow dim and glazed.    ARMGART (holds up a child).  Look, children, how a tyrant dies!    HARRAS.                    Mad hag!  Have you no touch of feeling that you look  On horrors such as these without a shudder?  Help me--take hold. What, will not one assist  To pull the torturing arrow from his breast?    WOMEN.  We touch the man whom God's own hand has struck!    HARRAS.  All curses light on you!       [Draws his sword.    STUSSI (seizes his arm).               Gently, sir knight!  Your power is at an end. 'Twere best forbear.  Our country's foe is fallen. We will brook  No further violence. We are free men.    ALL.  The country's free!    HARRAS.             And is it come to this?  Fear and obedience at an end so soon?       [To the soldiers of the guard who are thronging in.    You see, my friends, the bloody piece of work  They've acted here. 'Tis now too late for help,  And to pursue the murderer were vain.  New duties claim our care. Set on to Kuessnacht,  And let us save that fortress for the king!  For in an hour like this all ties of order,  Fealty, and faith are scattered to the winds.  No man's fidelity is to be trusted.       [As he is going out with the soldiers six     FRATRES MISERICCRDIAE appear.    ARMGART.  Here come the brotherhood of mercy. Room!    STUSSI.  The victim's slain, and now the ravens stoop.    BROTHERS OF MERCY (form a semicircle round the body, and sing  in solemn tones).       With hasty step death presses on,      Nor grants to man a moment's stay,     He falls ere half his race be run      In manhood's pride is swept away!     Prepared or unprepared to die,     He stands before his Judge on high.       [While they are repeating the last two lines, the curtain falls.          ACT V.    SCENE I.       A common near Altdorf. In the background to the right the keep     of Uri, with the scaffold still standing, as in the third scene     of the first act. To the left the view opens upon numerous     mountains, on all of which signal fires are burning. Day is     breaking, and bells are heard ringing from various distances.       RUODI, KUONI, WERNI, MASTER MASON, and many other country people,     also women and children.    RUODI.  Look at the fiery signals on the mountains!    MASTER MASON.  Hark to the bells"]]]
