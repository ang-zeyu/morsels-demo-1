I am not so selfe-conceited but I perceive what hath  followed. The complaints that are daily buzzed in mine eares are  these; that I am idle, cold, and negligent in offices of friendship,  and dutie to my parents and kinsfolkes; and touching publike  offices, that I am over singular and disdainfull. And those that are  most injurious cannot aske, wherefore I have taken, and why I have  not paied? but may rather demand, why I doe not quit, and wherefore  I doe not give? I would take it as a favour, they should wish such  effects of supererogation in me. But they are unjust and over  partiall, that will goe about to exact that from me which I owe not,  with more vigour than they will exact from themselves that which  they owe; wherein if they condemne me, they utterly cancell both the  gratifying of the action, and the gratitude, which thereby would be  due to me. Whereas the active well doing should be of more  consequence, proceeding from my hand, in regard I have no passive at  all. Wherefore I may so much the more freely dispose of my fortune,  by how much more it is mine, and of my selfe that am most mine owne.  Notwithstanding, if I were a great blazoner of mine owne actions, I  might peradventure barre such reproches, and justly upraid some,  that they are not so much offended, because I doe not enough, as for  that I may, and it lies in my power to doe much more than I doe. Yet  my minde ceased not at the same time to have peculiar unto it selfe  well setled motions, true and open judgements concerning the objects  which it knew; which alone, and without any helpe or communication  it would digest. And amongst other things, I verily beleeve it would  have proved altogether incapable and unfit to yeeld unto force, or  stoope unto violence. Shall I account or relate this qualitie of my  infancie, which was, a kinde of boldnesse in my lookes, and gentle  softnesse in my voice, and affabilitie in my gestures, and a  dexterite in conforming my selfe to the parts I undertooke? for  before the age of the         Alter ab undecimo turn me vix ceperat annus.       [Footnote: Virg. Buc. Ecl. viii. 39.]         Yeares had I (to make even)       Scarce two above eleven.    I have under-gone and represented the chiefest part in the Latin  Tragedies of Buchanan, Guerente, and of Muret; which in great state  were acted and plaid in our College of Guienne: wherein Andreas  Goveanus our Rector principall; who as in all other parts belonging  to his charge, was without comparison the chiefest Rector of France,  and my selfe (without ostentation be it spoken) was reputed, if not  a chiefe-master, yet a principall Actor in them. It is an exercise I  rather commend than disalow in young Gentlemen: and have seene some  of our Princes (in imitation of some of former ages) both  commendably and honestly, in their proper persons act and play some  parts in Tragedies. It hath heretofore been esteemed a lawfull  exercise, and a tolerable profession in men of honor, namely in  Greece. Aristoni tragico actori rem aperit: huic et genus et fortuna  honesta erant: nec ars, quia nihil tale apud Graecos pudori est, ea  deformabat. [Footnote: Liv. Deo. iii. 1. iv.] \"He imparts the matter  to Ariston a Player of tragedies, whose progenie and fortune were  both honest; nor did his profession disgrace them, because no such  matter is a disparagement amongst the Grecians.\"    And I have ever accused them of impertinencie, that condemne and  disalow such kindes of recreations, and blame those of injustice,  that refuse good and honest Comedians, or (as we call them) Players,  to enter our good townes, and grudge the common people such publike  sports. Politike and wel ordered commonwealths endevour rather  carefully to unite and assemble their Citizens together; as in  serious offices of devotion, so in honest exercises of recreation.  Common societie and loving friendship is thereby cherished and  increased. And besides, they cannot have more formal and regular  pastimes allowed them, than such as are acted and represented in  open view of all, and in the presence of the magistrates themselves;  And if I might beare sway, I would thinke it reasonable, that  Princes should sometimes, at their proper charges, gratifie the  common people with them, as an argument of a fatherly affection, and  loving goodnesse towards them: and that in populous and frequented  cities, there should be Theatres and places appointed for such  spectacles; as a diverting of worse inconveniences, and secret  actions. But to come to my intended purpose there is no better way  to allure the affection, and to entice the appetite: otherwise a man  shall breed but asses laden with Bookes. With jerks of rods they  have their satchels full of learning given them to keepe. Which to  doe well, one must not only harbor in himselfe, but wed and marry  the same with his minde.          OF FRIENDSHIP    Considering the proceeding of a Painters worke I have, a desire hath  possessed mee to imitate him: He maketh choice of the most  convenient place and middle of everie wall, there to place a  picture, laboured with all his skill and sufficiencie; and all void  places about it he filleth up with antike Boscage [Footnote:  Foliated ornament] or Crotesko [Footnote: Grotesque] works; which  are fantasticall pictures, having no grace, but in the variety and  strangenesse of them. And what are these my compositions in truth,  other than antike workes, and monstrous bodies, patched and hudled  up together of divers members, without any certaine or well ordered  figure, having neither order, dependencie, or proportion, but  casuall and framed by chance?         Definit in piscem mulier formosa superne.       [Footnote: Hon. Art. Poet. 4.]         A woman faire for parts superior,       Ends in a fish for parts inferior.    Touching this second point I goe as farre as my Painter, but for the  other and better part I am farre behinde: for my sufficiency  reacheth not so farre as that I dare undertake a rich, a polished,  and, according to true skill, an art-like table. I have advised  myselfe to borrow one of Steven de la Boetie, who with this kinde of  worke shall honour all the world. It is a discourse he entitled  Voluntary Servitude, but those who have not knowne him, have since  very properly rebaptized the same, The Against-one. In his first  youth he writ, by way of Essaie, in honour of libertie against  Tyrants. It hath long since beene dispersed amongst men of  understanding, not without great and well deserved commendations:  for it is full of wit, and containeth as much learning as may be:  yet doth it differ much from the best he can do. And if in the age I  knew him in, he would have undergone my dessigne to set his  fantasies downe in writing, we should doubtlesse see many rare  things, and which would very neerely approch the honour of  antiquity: for especially touching that part of natures gifts, I  know none may be compared to him. But it was not long of him, that  ever this Treatise came to mans view, and I beleeve he never saw it  since it first escaped his hands: with certaine other notes  concerning the edict of Januarie, famous by reason of our intestine  warre, which haply may in other places finde their deserved praise.  It is all I could ever recover of his reliques (whom when death  seized, he by his last will and testament, left with so kinde  remembrance, heire and executor of his librarie and writings)  besides the little booke, I since caused to be published: To which  his pamphlet I am particularly most bounden, for so much as it was  the instrumentall meane of our first acquaintance. For it was shewed  me long time before I saw him; and gave me the first knowledge of  his name, addressing, and thus nourishing that unspotted friendship  which we (so long as it pleased God) have so sincerely, so entire  and inviolably maintained betweene us, that truly a man shall not  commonly heare of the like; and amongst our moderne men no signe of  any such is scene. So many parts are required to the erecting of  such a one, that it may be counted a wonder if fortune once in three  ages contract the like. There is nothing to which Nature hath more  addressed us than to societie. And Aristotle saith that perfect Law-  givers have had more regardfull care of friendship than of justice.  And the utmost drift of its perfection is this. For generally, all  those amities which are forged and nourished by voluptuousnesse or  profit, publike or private need, are thereby so much the lesse faire  and generous, and so much the lesse true amities, in that they  intermeddle other causes, scope, and fruit with friendship, than it  selfe alone: Nor doe those foure ancient kindes of friendships,  Naturall, sociall, hospitable, and venerian, either particularly or  conjointly beseeme the same. That from children to parents may  rather be termed respect: Friendship is nourished by communication,  which by reason of the over-great disparitie cannot bee found in  them, and would happly offend the duties of nature: for neither all  the secret thoughts of parents can be communicated unto children,  lest it might engender an unbeseeming familiaritie betweene them,  nor the admonitions and corrections (which are the chiefest offices  of friendship) could be exercised from children to parents. There  have nations beene found, where, by custome, children killed their  parents, and others where parents slew their children, thereby to  avoid the hindrance of enterbearing [Footnote: Mutually supporting.]  one another in after-times: for naturally one dependeth from the  ruine of another. There have Philosophers beene found disdaining  this naturall conjunction: witnesse Aristippus, who being urged with  the affection he ought [Footnote: Owed.] his children, as proceeding  from his loyns, began to spit, saying, That also that excrement  proceeded from him, and that also we engendred"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5669"],[0,"Considerations on Representative Government (#16)"],[1," not expected,  nor even permitted, to originate directly either taxation or  expenditure. All it is asked for is its consent, and the sole power it  possesses is that of refusal.    The principles which are involved and recognized in this  constitutional doctrine, if followed as far as they will go, are a  guide to the limitation and definition of the general functions of  representative assemblies. In the first place, it is admitted in all  countries in which the representative system is practically  understood, that numerous representative bodies ought not to  administer. The maxim is grounded not only on the most essential  principles of good government, but on those of the successful conduct  of business of any description. No body of men, unless organized and  under command, is fit for action, in the proper sense. Even a select  board, composed of few members, and these specially conversant with  the business to be done, is always an inferior instrument to some one  individual who could be found among them, and would be improved in  character if that one person were made the chief, and all the others  reduced to subordinates. What can be done better by a body than by any  individual is deliberation. When it is necessary or important to  secure hearing and consideration to many conflicting opinions, a  deliberative body is indispensable. Those bodies, therefore, are  frequently useful, even for administrative business, but in general  only as advisers; such business being, as a rule, better conducted  under the responsibility of one. Even a joint-stock company has always  in practice, if not in theory, a managing director; its good or bad  management depends essentially on some one person's qualifications,  and the remaining directors, when of any use, are so by their  suggestions to him, or by the power they possess of watching him, and  restraining or removing him in case of misconduct. That they are  ostensibly equal shares with him in the management is no advantage,  but a considerable set-off against any good which they are capable of  doing: it weakens greatly the sense in his own mind, and in those of  other people, of that individual responsibility in which he should  stand forth personally and undividedly.    But a popular assembly is still less fitted to administer, or to  dictate in detail to those who have the charge of administration. Even  when honestly meant, the interference is almost always injurious.  Every branch of public administration is a skilled business, which has  its own peculiar principles and traditional rules, many of them not  even known in any effectual way, except to those who have at some time  had a hand in carrying on the business, and none of them likely to be  duly appreciated by persons not practically acquainted with the  department. I do not mean that the transaction of public business has  esoteric mysteries, only to be understood by the initiated. Its  principles are all intelligible to any person of good sense, who has  in his mind a true picture of the circumstances and conditions to be  dealt with; but to have this he must know those circumstances and  conditions; and the knowledge does not come by intuition. There are  many rules of the greatest importance in every branch of public  business (as there are in every private occupation), of which a person  fresh to the subject neither knows the reason or even suspects the  existence, because they are intended to meet dangers or provide  against inconveniences which never entered into his thoughts. I have  known public men, ministers of more than ordinary natural capacity,  who, on their first introduction to a department of business new to  them, have excited the mirth of their inferiors by the air with which  they announced as a truth hitherto set at nought, and brought to light  by themselves, something which was probably the first thought of every  body who ever looked at the subject, given up as soon as he had got on  to a second. It is true that a great statesman is he who knows when to  depart from traditions, as well as when to adhere to them; but it is a  great mistake to suppose that he will do this better for being  ignorant of the traditions. No one who does not thoroughly know the  modes of action which common experience has sanctioned is capable of  judging of the circumstances which require a departure from those  ordinary modes of action. The interests dependent on the acts done by  a public department, the consequences liable to follow from any  particular mode of conducting it, require for weighing and estimating  them a kind of knowledge, and of specially exercised judgment, almost  as rarely found in those not bred to it, as the capacity to reform the  law in those who have not professionally studied it. All these  difficulties are sure to be ignored by a representative assembly which  attempts to decide on special acts of administration. At its best, it  is inexperience sitting in judgment on experience, ignorance on  knowledge; ignorance which, never suspecting the existence of what it  does not know, is equally careless and supercilious, making light of,  if not resenting, all pretensions to have a judgment better worth  attending to than its own. Thus it is when no interested motives  intervene; but when they do, the result is jobbery more unblushing and  audacious than the worst corruption which can well take place in a  public office under a government of publicity. It is not necessary  that the interested bias should extend to the majority of the  assembly. In any particular case it is of ten enough that it affects  two or three of their number. Those two or three will have a greater  interest in misleading the body than any other of its members are  likely to have in putting it right. The bulk of the assembly may keep  their hands clean, but they can not keep their minds vigilant or their  judgments discerning in matters they know nothing about; and an  indolent majority, like an indolent individual, belongs to the person  who takes most pains with it. The bad measures or bad appointments of  a minister may be checked by Parliament; and the interest of ministers  in defending, and of rival partisans in attacking, secures a tolerably  equal discussion; but _quis custodiet custodes?_ who shall check the  Parliament? A minister, a head of an office, feels himself under some  responsibility. An assembly in such cases feels under no  responsibility at all; for when did any member of Parliament lose his  seat for the vote he gave on any detail of administration? To a  minister, or the head of an office, it is of more importance what will  be thought of his proceedings some time hence, than what is thought of  them at the instant; but an assembly, if the cry of the moment goes  with it, however hastily raised or artificially stirred up, thinks  itself and is thought by every body, to be completely exculpated,  however disastrous may be the consequences. Besides, an assembly never  personally experiences the inconveniences of its bad measures until  they have reached the dimensions of national evils. Ministers and  administrators see them approaching, and have to bear all the  annoyance and trouble of attempting to ward them off.    The proper duty of a representative assembly in regard to matters of  administration is not to decide them by its own vote, but to take care  that the persons who have to decide them shall be the proper persons.  Even this they can not advantageously do by nominating the  individuals. There is no act which more imperatively requires to be  performed under a strong sense of individual responsibility than the  nomination to employments. The experience of every person conversant  with public affairs bears out the assertion that there is scarcely any  act respecting which the conscience of an average man is less  sensitive; scarcely any case in which less consideration is paid to  qualifications, partly because men do not know, and partly because  they do not care for, the difference in qualifications between one  person and another. When a minister makes what is meant to be an  honest appointment, that is, when he does not actually job it for his  personal connections or his party, an ignorant person might suppose  that he would try to give it to the person best qualified. No such  thing. An ordinary minister thinks himself a miracle of virtue if he  gives it to a person of merit, or who has a claim on the public on any  account, though the claim or the merit may be of the most opposite  description to that required. _Il fallait un calculateur, ce fut un  danseur qui l'obtint_, is hardly more of a caricature than in the days  of Figaro; and the minister doubtless thinks himself not only  blameless, but meritorious, if the man dances well. Besides, the  qualifications which fit special individuals for special duties can  only be recognized by those who know the individuals, or who make it  their business to examine and judge of persons from what they have  done, or from the evidence of those who are in a position to judge.  When these conscientious obligations are so little regarded by great  public officers who can be made responsible for their appointments,  how must it be with assemblies who can not? Even now, the worst  appointments are those which are made for the sake of gaining support  or disarming opposition in the representative body; what might we  expect if they were made by the body itself? Numerous bodies never  regard special qualifications at all. Unless a man is fit for the  gallows, he is thought to be about as fit as other people for almost  any thing for which he can offer himself as a candidate. When  appointments made by a public body are not decided, as they almost  always are, by party connection or private jobbing, a man is appointed  either because he has a reputation, often quite undeserved, for  _general_ ability, or oftener for no better"]]]
