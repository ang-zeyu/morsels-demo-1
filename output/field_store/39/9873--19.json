[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46237"],[0,"The Romance of Book-Collecting (#16)"],[1,"Louis XVI.    This library is, of its kind, perhaps as important as any that has ever  been formed, and yet it only numbers some 250 volumes, so supremely  difficult is it, as a rule, to trace the possession even of books for  more than a generation or two.  Great men have ever been chary of their  names, or at least it would seem so from the number of unimportant  signatures and inscriptions we meet with day by day.    A long and very interesting chapter might be written on 'Inscriptions in  Books,' and it must be confessed that a really important signature or  comment adds so very appreciably to the sentimental value of the volume  in which it is found, that it is not surprising that Oliver Wendell  Holmes conjured up a pleasant train of reflection, in his inimitable  style, based upon the name of a former owner of his own copy of the  'Colloquies of Erasmus,' which, by the way, my friend is extremely  anxious to possess himself of, but will probably never obtain.  In this  instance the personality of the 'Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table'  obscures all else, and gives the book a distinct history of its own--a  history that invests it with an importance and value it could never  claim of itself.  To find out all we can about the former owners of  books which we ourselves take pleasure in is no frivolous task, and the  pity is that our opportunities for doing so are limited.  The book-plate  has very nearly put an end to owner's autographs, and being easy to  remove, affords little or no guarantee of ownership.  And book-plates  have been in use in this country for more than 200 years.    No doubt everyone who has anything to do with books, whether as writer,  producer, or collector, can call to mind the eccentricities of his  neighbours with regard to them.  I call it extremely eccentric conduct  on the part of any man to persist in collecting odd volumes, and to  studiously ignore complete sets.  Yet I knew an old gentleman--now dead,  and his books littering the stalls of Farringdon Street and  elsewhere--who did this, year after year, and for many years, with the  inevitable result.  He was fond of literature, and the pleasure he  derived in reading was part and parcel of his existence.    It was an axiom with him, however, that anything which is worth having,  and any knowledge worth acquiring, must be laboriously worked for; and  he would instance numerous authorities who have taught this truth by  example as well as by precept.  He would say, 'If I go out and buy a  Bible for L500, because it is old and scarce, do you think I shall  derive as much benefit and solace from its pages as if I had invested a  trifle with the fixed determination to read what I had acquired and to  follow its teachings?'    'No, certainly not,' is the obvious and truthful reply to that; but this  would appear to be different from buying one volume of, say, Pope's  works when there ought to be twenty, and trusting to enterprise not  unmingled with luck to discover the remaining nineteen.  To this,  however, he would not agree, and, to do him justice, he did not preach  one thing and perform another.  His theory was that, if the perusal of  an odd volume leads the reader to long for the possession of its  fellows, it is better that he should search for them until he finds  them, than that he should have them to his hand, as it were, ready made.    Carlyle intimated that a man had far better study the title-page of any  book worth the trouble of looking at than read the whole text with a  vacant mind, and no doubt he was right, though this, too, seems to be an  entirely distinct matter from the general principle that nothing can be  learned without a maximum of inconvenience.  Such a conclusion is rather  a straining of the position insisted upon by Nero's tutor, that no one  should collect more books than he can read, and that a multitude of  books only distracts the mind.  Therefore was it that Francis Bissari in  the year 1750 designed a plate, which he pasted in the few volumes he  possessed, and which consequently is now extremely scarce.  'Ex-Libris  civis Francisci Bissari,' he says, 'Distrahit animum librorum multitude,  itaque cum legere non possis quantum habueris, sat est habere quantum  legas.  Seneca. Ep. 2.'    Still, as I have intimated, the old gentleman had his way and his day,  and when he died his books were all despatched to the auction rooms. It  took three men more than a week to pack them in boxes.  There were books  under every bed in the house, and every nook and cranny was full of  them.  There were, altogether, many thousands of volumes, and nearly all  were odd.  If a series were found to be complete, as sometimes happened,  it was sure to be made up of volumes belonging to different editions,  and, naturally enough, in different bindings.  The auctioneers did what  they could, and sold the vast majority in 'parcels' for a mere song,  which in truth was all they were worth.    This peculiar form of book-collecting, though apparently strange, is,  and always has been, very usual, for the vast majority of readers are  poor. One volume will cost less, proportionately, than the complete set  of which it forms part; and, moreover, we are again face to face with  the argument that it is better to master the contents of one volume than  to have a mere superficial knowledge of a dozen or more.  The only thing  is that, as the world wags at present, the advice is erratic, and the  system of buying books in sections one that cannot be recommended.  If  we could be sure of a hundred years of life, then things might be  different.  _Sed Ars longa, vita brevis est_.    And so it happens that the vagaries of book-hunters are often passing  strange.  Some, like Sir Thomas Phillipps, will buy largely, and never  even open the cases in which they arrive.  Others will hide them in all  sorts of out-of-the-way places, while others again will cut them to  pieces, or in some other way destroy them utterly.  It is the most usual  thing, for me, at any rate, and therefore presumably for others who are  known to write about books, or to give the reports of the auction-rooms,  to receive a bundle of title-pages as samples of the volumes to which  they belong, with a request for information as to how they ought to be  bound, and what they are worth. Some collectors--real _bona-fide_  collectors these--start life with strong opinions as to the usefulness  of books, and, after the manner of Grolier, though without his  discretion, open their doors to all sorts and conditions of men, only to  close them later with a firm resolve that, come what come may, they will  never again allow any friend whomsoever even to gaze upon their store.  Some, too, are so deeply immersed in their all-absorbing hobby that they  have no clear conception of the difference between _meum_ and _tuum_.  Estimable in every respect but one, and scrupulously honest to a degree  in all matters of daily intercourse, they yet fail in this one supreme  trial.  And yet they are absolved; for these unfortunates are not  thieves but eccentrics, who would no more think of selling the objects  they have mistaken for their own, than they would of getting wealth by  false pretences.  Pope Innocent X., when still Monsignor Pamphilio, was  found in the possession of a book he could not satisfactorily account  for, and the ludicrous part of the matter was that Du Moustier, who  claimed that it had been abstracted from his library, was subsequently  proved to have stolen it himself.  Then, again, Catherine de Medici  sequestered the entire library of Marshal Strozzi, and on complaint  promised to pay for it by instalments, which, of course, she never did.  Hearne hints more than once that Sir Thomas Bodley was eccentric, and  when Moore, Bishop of Ely, and father of English Black-Letter  Collectors, went to dine with a bibliophile, as was his wont, the latter  would, if he were wise, spend the morning in removing out of sight, and,  therefore, out of temptation's way, the choicest of his possessions.  But the king of all these suspicious characters was Libri, who, as  Inspector-General of French Libraries, under Louis Philippe, presented  himself, from first to last, with books of the value of more than  L20,000, among them a fine MS. of the Pentateuch, which he sold to the  late Lord Ashburnham on condition that it was not to be published for  twenty years.  In 1868 the time expired, and then the matter was traced  home, to his memory's shame.    This conduct of Libri in selling what did not belong to him puts him,  indeed, on a level, in point of turpitude, with the young divinity  student of Chicago commonly called 'The Champion Biblioklept of  America.'  In vastness of conception the latter was a mere tyro, for he  only stole a few hundred books of small value from the Chicago Public  Library.  The motive of both men was, however, the same, and it was that  which, according to some consciences, made them thieves.  After all, it  is this motive that must be primarily considered in all ethical  questions such as those which underlie, to some extent at least, the  vagaries of every book-hunter who ever was born to hunger and thirst for  Caxton's types, and paper white as snow, bound in a dream by the  Gascon's magic touch.                                       *CHAPTER VII.*                              *HOW FASHION LIVES.*      The dim haze which, in the imagination of the populace, once floated  above the head of every hungry book-man, was never in those days  identified with a mass of tangled, waving hair, which, aureola-like,  'girt his occiput about,' for he was no minor poet, with pale, eager  face and love-locks everywhere, but a man, with a rugged front such as  Ben Jonson wore, and a heart that beat within.  The haze in which he  moved was from the dust of old-world tomes; it settled on his coat, and,  had he worn a bob-wig, it would have settled on that "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46303"],[0,"South Africa and the Transvaal War, Vol. 6 (of 8) (#16)"],[1,"ry, and Imperial Australian  Regiment operated on the right, and made themselves masters of a position  on a kopje at the northerly ridge of the eminences held by the Boers.  General Clements engaged the foe in his eastern fastnesses, capturing  them on the following day through the gallantry of the Royal Irish  Regiment, while the Infantry with General Paget fought with splendid  persistence, till their ammunition being exhausted they finally charged  with the bayonet so gallantly, so effectively, that the Boers were  routed, and General Paget at nightfall found himself in possession of a  kopje which faced and was the key to the terrific steeps leading to the  precipitous peak of Wolhunter's Kop. This charge of the Munsters,  supported by the Yorkshire Light Infantry, was described by one of the  officers of the former splendid regiment in glowing terms: \"The Royal  Munster Fusiliers had to storm a kopje at the point of the bayonet. For  the last 800 yards my men had not a round of ammunition left. We kept  advancing, cheering as we went on, with bayonets fixed. We got within  fifty yards, when the Boers fired their last volley and bolted. The  position was won. The G.O.C., in his despatch to Lord Roberts, said the  gallantry displayed by the Munsters was beyond all praise.... My men  behaved excellently. I never want finer fellows to be with in an attack.\"    Mr. Blundell, of the _Morning Post_, related a characteristic anecdote  which served to show the debonnair spirit, the coolness and aplomb of  some of the doughty band: \"In the midst of the rush past some Kaffir  kraals a goose waddled out through the line, and a man, not too  preoccupied to forget the future, lowered his bayonet, swung the bird  over his shoulder in his stride, and took possession of the captured  position with his dinner on his back.\" The goose was eaten in face of the  frowning Wolhunter's Kop, which next day, the 7th, fell into the hands of  the British through a series of ingenious martial manoeuvres, assisted  by the brilliant execution of the 38th Battery R.F.A. and the C.I.V.  Battery under Major M'Micking. The decisive move in the operations was  brought about by the splendid persistence of the Royal Irish, who,  extended in three lines, stormed a formidable kopje amidst cascades of  fire, dropping, and sweating, and shouting, yet never halting till they  had reached the crest, captured it, and in addition to it a prize--a gun,  one of our own lost in the fatal affair at Stormberg. By midday the enemy  was in full retreat, and the town was occupied by the combined forces.    The casualty list on the first day, considering the magnitude of the  operations and the strength of the positions assailed, was not large:  Thirty-two men of the Munster Fusiliers were wounded and one man missing;  seven men of the Yorkshire Light Infantry wounded; one man of the 58th  Company Imperial Yeomanry was killed, and two men wounded. The wounded  officers were: Lieutenant A. H. D. West, 8th Battery Royal Field  Artillery; Captain T. W. Williams, 5th Volunteer Battalion Liverpool  Regiment (attached Royal Irish Regiment); Captain G. D. M'Pherson, 1st  Munster Fusiliers; Captain W. C. Oates, 1st Munster Fusiliers; Lieutenant  Conway, 1st Munster Fusiliers; Second Lieutenant Boyd Rochford, 4th  Scottish Rifles. The following casualty occurred on the 7th: Captain J.  B. H. Alderson, 1st Royal Irish Rifles, wounded (since dead).    On the morrow, Broadwood's Brigade, preceding General Hunter, arrived.    After this, by systematic and strategic pressure, the Free Staters were  being pushed off their impregnable heights to a mountainous place called  the Brandwater Basin, some fifteen miles square, in the region of the  Caledon River, leaving us in possession of practically the last of their  towns--Lindley, Bethlehem, Biddulph's Berg, and Senekal. Bethlehem was  occupied by General Paget, Biddulph's Berg by General Clements, Senekal  by General Rundle, and thus a cordon was supposed to be drawn round the  wily enemy. Unluckily, on the 15th, between Bethlehem and Ficksburg, a  small gap existed--a gap which but for delay in regard to his supplies  would have been held by General Paget--and through this loophole,  Stabbert's Nek, that very slippery fish De Wet contrived to slide, taking  with him 1500 men and five guns. This was unfortunate, as the escaped  enemy threatened to become a serious diversion from the business in hand,  particularly as no general advance could be made till the necessary  convoys had arrived for the enormous amount of troops forming the cordon.    Nevertheless while General Hunter, on one side, actively engaged in  reconnoitring the positions held by the remainder of De Wet's forces  between Bethlehem, Ficksburg, Fouriesburg, Retief's and Stabbert's Neks,  General Little (temporarily commanding the 3rd Brigade) pursued De Wet  himself, and the force that had recently broken through the cordon was  found to be hovering between Bethlehem and Lindley. A smart contest  ensued, which lasted till dusk, when the Boers broke up into two parties  and again vanished, leaving several dead and two wounded upon the field.    On the same day, 19th, General Broadwood, commanding 2nd Cavalry Brigade,  who had been following up the fleeing Boers since the 16th, spent some  hours in an animated engagement near Palmietfontein, between Ventersburg  and Lindley. The enemy, with swelled numbers, and said to be accompanied  by Steyn and one of the De Wets, had been wheeling round the railway  communications as moths circle around a chandelier. Having caught them  here General Broadwood made a brisk fight of it, but the Boers under  cover of darkness evaded pursuit. On the following morning it was found  that they had doubled back to Paardekraal during the night. The line on  the north of Honing Spruit showed signs of their depredations, and on the  western side the telegraph wires to Pretoria _via_ Potchefstroom were  cut. During the fight Major Moore, West Australian Mounted Infantry, was  killed, and Lieutenant the Hon. F. Stanley, 10th Hussars, Lieutenant  Tooth, Australian Contingent, and fourteen men were wounded. General  Broadwood proceeded to Vaal Krantz, which place was reached on the 22nd.    [Illustration: PRINSLOO'S LAST STAND IN THE VALLEY OF THE LITTLE CALEDON:  THE BOERS' POSITION ON THE HEIGHTS    From a Sketch by M. F. R.]    Meanwhile the desperadoes, routed on all sides, made a rush upon the  line near Roodeval, tore up the rails, and succeeded in capturing on the  night of the 21st, between Kroonstad and the Vaal, a supply train with  two officers and a hundred men of the Royal Welsh Fusiliers. De Wet's  force, doubtless well pleased with itself, then moved _via_ Vredefort in  a north-easterly direction, quickly pursued by General Broadwood, who, in  his turn, was followed by General Little. The former officer succeeded on  the 23rd in capturing some of De Wet's waggons at Vredefort, at which  place he halted till joined by General Little. On the 25th De Wet,  ubiquitous, was found posted on some comfortable heights at Reitzburg,  some seven miles south of the Vaal, while General Broadwood, like a cat  watching a bird, was preparing to spring. But the bird was too wary, and  kept his wings flapping for flight at the first provocation. Indeed, he  had dodges at his fingers' end, and tried a new variety every time he was  warned of the British approach. One of these was at a certain place to  keep a dozen or so Boer hats, which had previously been strung on a line,  continually bobbing over a certain entrenched spot in order to impress  the British and lead them astray, while he and his horde took an opposite  direction.    While the chase was going forward some fighting took place, in which the  Berkshire Yeomanry, the Imperial Bushmen, and the 38th Field Battery took  part. They disputed the possession of a high hill to west of Bethlehem,  but as possession makes nine points of the law, the Boers, posted in  strength upon the hill, caused the small force to retire. During the  retirement one officer and nine men were lost. General Bruce Hamilton  also engaged in some active work, which cost him three of the Cameron  Highlanders, whose regiment, assisted by 500 Mounted Infantry and the  82nd Battery, succeeded in securing a strong position on Spitzray.  Captain Keith Hamilton, Oxford Light Infantry, was wounded severely, and  Captain Brown, Captain A. C. M'Lean, and Lieutenant Stewart, Cameron  Highlanders, Captain E. S. C. Hobson, Mounted Infantry Worcester  Regiment, and thirteen Cameron Highlanders were all more or less severely  injured.    Of the terribly hard work done by the 21st Brigade it has been impossible  to take due note. Since the 28th of April they had covered on foot some  1200 miles, and had done more fighting and marching than any brigade at  the front. They could count as many as forty-three engagements to their  credit, and as one of the Sussex men said, \"We have been in several tight  corners, but have always come out on top.\" The Irish, Scottish, and  Colonial Corps had all received their meed of praise, but certain English  regiments, notably the Sussex, the Wiltshire, and the Liverpool  Regiments, owing to the fact of their not being prominently engaged in  the \"historic\" battles, got less than their share of appreciation,  though no better and braver and more enduring regiments could be found  in the British army.    [Illustration: POSITION OF TROOPS ROUND THE BRANDWATER BASIN BEFORE THE  SURRENDER OF PRINSLOO.]    Operations were now carried forward with additional vigour, for it was  known that Boers, some 6000 of them, led by Roux and Prinsloo, who had  not bolted with De Wet, must still be in the neighbourhood of the Caledon  Valley, the river behind them, the only passes available among the  snow-capped mountains, Commando Nek below Fouriesburg, Stabbert's and  Retief's Neks near Bethlehem, and"]]]
