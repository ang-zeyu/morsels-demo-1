Let us examine any hypothesis by which we can account for the regard  paid to the rich and powerful; we shall find none satisfactory, but that  which derives it from the enjoyment communicated to the spectator by  the images of prosperity, happiness, ease, plenty, authority, and the  gratification of every appetite. Self-love, for instance, which some  affect so much to consider as the source of every sentiment, is plainly  insufficient for this purpose. Where no good-will or friendship appears,  it is difficult to conceive on what we can found our hope of advantage  from the riches of others; though we naturally respect the rich, even  before they discover any such favourable disposition towards us.    We are affected with the same sentiments, when we lie so much out of the  sphere of their activity, that they cannot even be supposed to possess  the power of serving us. A prisoner of war, in all civilized nations,  is treated with a regard suited to his condition; and riches, it is  evident, go far towards fixing the condition of any person. If birth  and quality enter for a share, this still affords us an argument to our  present purpose. For what is it we call a man of birth, but one who is  descended from a long succession of rich and powerful ancestors, and who  acquires our esteem by his connexion with persons whom we esteem? His  ancestors, therefore, though dead, are respected, in some measure,  on account of their riches; and consequently, without any kind of  expectation.    But not to go so far as prisoners of war or the dead, to find instances  of this disinterested regard for riches; we may only observe, with  a little attention, those phenomena which occur in common life and  conversation. A man, who is himself, we shall suppose, of a competent  fortune, and of no profession, being introduced to a company of  strangers, naturally treats them with different degrees of respect, as  he is informed of their different fortunes and conditions; though it  is impossible that he can so suddenly propose, and perhaps he would  not accept of, any pecuniary advantage from them. A traveller is always  admitted into company, and meets with civility, in proportion as his  train and equipage speak him a man of great or moderate fortune. In  short, the different ranks of men are, in a great measure, regulated  by riches; and that with regard to superiors as well as inferiors,  strangers as well as acquaintance.    What remains, therefore, but to conclude, that, as riches are desired  for ourselves only as the means of gratifying our appetites, either at  present or in some imaginary future period, they beget esteem in others  merely from their having that influence. This indeed is their very  nature or offence: they have a direct reference to the commodities,  conveniences, and pleasures of life. The bill of a banker, who is broke,  or gold in a desert island, would otherwise be full as valuable. When we  approach a man who is, as we say, at his ease, we are presented with the  pleasing ideas of plenty, satisfaction, cleanliness, warmth; a cheerful  house, elegant furniture, ready service, and whatever is desirable in  meat, drink, or apparel. On the contrary, when a poor man appears,  the disagreeable images of want, penury, hard labour, dirty furniture,  coarse or ragged clothes, nauseous meat and distasteful liquor,  immediately strike our fancy. What else do we mean by saying that one  is rich, the other poor? And as regard or contempt is the natural  consequence of those different situations in life, it is easily seen  what additional light and evidence this throws on our preceding theory,  with regard to all moral distinctions.           [Footnote: There is something extraordinary, and seemingly  unaccountable in the operation of our passions, when we consider the  fortune and situation of others. Very often another's advancement and  prosperity produces envy, which has a strong mixture of hatred, and  arises chiefly from the comparison of ourselves with the person. At the  very same time, or at least in very short intervals, we may feel the  passion of respect, which is a species of affection or good-will, with  a mixture of humility. On the other hand, the misfortunes of our fellows  often cause pity, which has in it a strong mixture of good-will. This  sentiment of pity is nearly allied to contempt, which is a species of  dislike, with a mixture of pride. I only point out these phenomena, as  a subject of speculation to such as are curious with regard to moral  enquiries. It is sufficient for the present purpose to observe in  general, that power and riches commonly cause respect, poverty and  meanness contempt, though particular views and incidents may sometimes  raise the passions of envy and of pity.]    A man who has cured himself of all ridiculous pre-possessions, and is  fully, sincerely, and steadily convinced, from experience as well as  philosophy, that the difference of fortune makes less difference in  happiness than is vulgarly imagined; such a one does not measure out  degrees of esteem according to the rent-rolls of his acquaintance. He  may, indeed, externally pay a superior deference to the great lord above  the vassal; because riches are the most convenient, being the most fixed  and determinate, source of distinction. But his internal sentiments are  more regulated by the personal characters of men, than by the accidental  and capricious favours of fortune.    In most countries of Europe, family, that is, hereditary riches, marked  with titles and symbols from the sovereign, is the chief source of  distinction. In England, more regard is paid to present opulence and  plenty. Each practice has its advantages and disadvantages. Where birth  is respected, unactive, spiritless minds remain in haughty indolence,  and dream of nothing but pedigrees and genealogies: the generous and  ambitious seek honour and authority, and reputation and favour. Where  riches are the chief idol, corruption, venality, rapine prevail: arts,  manufactures, commerce, agriculture flourish. The former prejudice,  being favourable to military virtue, is more suited to monarchies.  The latter, being the chief spur to industry, agrees better with a  republican government. And we accordingly find that each of these forms  of government, by varying the utility of those customs, has commonly a  proportionable effect on the sentiments of mankind.        SECTION VII.    OF QUALITIES IMMEDIATELY AGREEABLE TO OURSELVES.        Whoever has passed an evening with serious melancholy people, and  has observed how suddenly the conversation was animated, and what  sprightliness diffused itself over the countenance, discourse, and  behaviour of every one, on the accession of a good-humoured, lively  companion; such a one will easily allow that cheerfulness carries great  merit with it, and naturally conciliates the good-will of mankind. No  quality, indeed, more readily communicates itself to all around; because  no one has a greater propensity to display itself, in jovial talk and  pleasant entertainment. The flame spreads through the whole circle; and  the most sullen and morose are often caught by it. That the melancholy  hate the merry, even though Horace says it, I have some difficulty  to allow; because I have always observed that, where the jollity is  moderate and decent, serious people are so much the more delighted,  as it dissipates the gloom with which they are commonly oppressed, and  gives them an unusual enjoyment.    From this influence of cheerfulness, both to communicate itself and to  engage approbation, we may perceive that there is another set of mental  qualities, which, without any utility or any tendency to farther good,  either of the community or of the possessor, diffuse a satisfaction  on the beholders, and procure friendship and regard. Their immediate  sensation, to the person possessed of them, is agreeable. Others enter  into the same humour, and catch the sentiment, by a contagion or natural  sympathy; and as we cannot forbear loving whatever pleases, a kindly  emotion arises towards the person who communicates so much satisfaction.  He is a more animating spectacle; his presence diffuses over us more  serene complacency and enjoyment; our imagination, entering into his  feelings and disposition, is affected in a more agreeable manner than  if a melancholy, dejected, sullen, anxious temper were presented to us.  Hence the affection and probation which attend the former: the aversion  and disgust with which we regard the latter.           [Footnote: There is no man, who, on particular occasions, is not  affected with all the disagreeable passions, fear, anger, dejection,  grief, melancholy, anxiety, &c. But these, so far as they are natural,  and universal, make no difference between one man and another, and can  never be the object of blame. It is only when the disposition gives a  PROPENSITY to any of these disagreeable passions, that they disfigure  the character, and by giving uneasiness, convey the sentiment of  disapprobation to the spectator.]    Few men would envy the character which Caesar gives of Cassius:     He loves no play,   As thou do'st, Anthony: he hears no music:   Seldom he smiles; and smiles in such a sort,   As if he mock'd himself, and scorn'd his spirit   That could be mov'd to smile at any thing.    Not only such men, as Caesar adds, are commonly DANGEROUS, but also,  having little enjoyment within themselves, they can never become  agreeable to others, or contribute to social entertainment. In all  polite nations and ages, a relish for pleasure, if accompanied with  temperance and decency, is esteemed a considerable merit, even in the  greatest men; and becomes still more requisite in those of inferior rank  and character.

A very dark spot much  larger than a satellite was seen on the eastern edge of the disk, as  shown in the above diagram. It moved rapidly westward along the upper  margin of the northern belt and passed off at 1 o'clock 24 minutes A.M.  (12th). From its first internal contact till its last external contact  was just 3h. 19m., Pittsburg time. It appeared to be a solid opaque  body, truly spherical, very sharply defined, and most intensely black.  The transit of the satellite occurred at 15 minutes after 11 o'clock,  and had no unusual appearance. Now what was that dark body? We are  constant observers of the heavenly bodies, though not deeply versed in  the science of astronomy, and are anxious to know if any one can give us  some light on the subject. The telescopes used were a 2-1/2 inch and 5 inch  achromatic, magnifying 154 and 216 diameters, but the 154 was chiefly  used.

Williston, the assistant of Professor Marsh, has been giving  to the Omaha _Bee_ some interesting facts with regard to the great  reptilian fossils recently discovered in Wyoming and Colorado. The bones  found represent reptiles of many sizes, from that of a cat up to one  sixty feet high. The latter, found at Como, Wyoming, belonged to the  crocodile order; but the remains give evidence that the animal stood up  on its hind legs, like a kangaroo. Another found in Colorado is  estimated by Professor Marsh to have been 100 feet long. A great many  remains of the same general class, but belonging to different species,  have been collected and sent East. Among them from three to four hundred  specimens of the dinosaur, and about a thousand pterodactyls, have been  shipped from Colorado, Wyoming, and Kansas. The wings of one of the  latter were from thirty to forty feet from tip to tip. Seventeen  different species of these flying dragons have been found in the chalk  of western Kansas. There have also been found six species of toothed  birds. Comparatively little has been done toward classifying the late  finds, the task is such an enormous one. Great importance is attached to  them, however, since nothing of the kind had been found in America until  a little over a year ago and great stress had been laid by certain  geologists on their absence. Another remarkable feature of the discovery  was that the fossils which had been reported as not existing in this  country had hardly been brought to light in one locality before  thousands of tons of them were simultaneously discovered in half a dozen  different places.           *       *       *       *       *                =Trying to Save a Hundred and Fifty Million Dollars a Year.=    Professor Riley, recently appointed Government Entomologist and attached  to the Agricultural Department, reports that specimens of insects  injurious to agriculture are constantly being sent to the department  from all parts of the country, with requests for information. In every  instance, if a proper examination could be made, an effectual remedy  could be found, and not less than $150,000,000 saved to the country  annually. Recently a worm entirely new to science was sent to the  department by an Iowa farmer, whose orchard of several thousand apple  trees had been rendered unproductive for several years by the new  depredator. For the interests of Western fruit growers this insect  should immediately be investigated. Professor Riley asserts that the  $5,000 recently voted by Congress for the investigation of the cotton  worm, which has sometimes damaged the cotton crop of the South as much  as $20,000,000 in a single fortnight, might have been used to better  advantage by the department; the salary of the entomologist will use up  all the money, leaving next to nothing for experiments for the  eradication of the pest.           *       *       *       *       *                                  =Industrial Education.=    All are agreed that some education is necessary; but what? The great  proportion of those having the direction of our educational system and  facilities in charge still cling to a system which was established long  before the first mechanical operation came into existence. Before the  present system of man's relation to man, socially, industrially,  politically, or commercially, was heard of, and notwithstanding the  revolutions and advancement in all other things, there is a determined  resistance to any attempt at revolution in what shall be considered  education.    There is an effort to establish compulsory education; but what is the  child to be taught? As if in league with the false theories of the  rights of labor, these efforts take the apprentices from the shops,  force them away from where they would learn something, and confine them  inside a school house to learn--what? Certainly nothing of the  materials, or tools, or pursuits by which they are to obtain their  livelihood. The child knows nothing of when or by whom the compass was  discovered, the printing press, the use of powder, electricity, of  steam, or of any one of the thousand mechanical operations now  controlling every department of life. Does any school boy know how many  kingdoms there are in the natural world, or whether an animal, a  vegetable and a mineral all belong to the same or to different ones?  Will he know that from instinct the young of animals seeks its food and  expands its lungs, as by the same instinct the root of a seed sucks up  its nourishment from the soil and sends its leaves up to breathe the  air? Will he know anything of the nature or requirements of the soils or  the plants that grow in them? Will this compulsory education teach the  boy anything of the iron furnace, the foundry or rolling mill, or the  uses or handling of any of their products? Will it teach him anything of  woods and their value, or for what and how they are useful to man?    Will this knowledge, for which the powers of the State are to be  required to force him to know it--will it teach him anything of the  nature or uses of metals, of metal working, or the business depending  upon them? Will it teach him anything of gold or silver, copper or  brass? Anything of pottery, of bone, ivory, celluloid, etc.? Will he  learn anything of hides, leather, or the production of these necessary  articles? Will he know whether the word textile applies to anything but  a spider's web or the wing of a butterfly? Whether the United States  make, import, or grow cotton, wool, silk, flax, and hemp?    Will he know anything of commerce, railroads, telegraphs, printing, and  the great number of clerk labors in the larger towns? Will he have  learned a single thing which will assist him in his work of life? Will  not every boy"]]]
