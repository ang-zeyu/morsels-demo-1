ODONTOGLOSSAÂ†.         Family 1. FLAMINGOES. PhA\"nicopteridA|. 1 species.      Flamingoes might be called long-legged Ducks. Their feet are webbed,  and their bill is set with ridges, which serve as sieves or strainers,  as do the 'gutters' on a Duck's bill. They are, however, wading birds  and their webbed feet are of use in supporting them on the soft mud of  shallow lagoons or bays where they search for the favorite food of  small mollusks. In feeding the flat top of the bill is pressed into  the mud when its tip points upward toward the bird's body. Flamingoes  fly with the neck and legs stretched to the utmost presenting on the  wing a picturesque, but by no means so graceful an appearance as do  the Herons. Their voice is a vibrant _honking_ like that of a Goose.          Order VII. HERONS, STORKS, IBISES, ETC.    HERODIONES.         Family 1. SPOONBILLS. PlataleidA|. 1 species.       Family 2. IBISES. IbididA|. 3 species.       Family 3. STORKS and WOOD IBISES. CiconiidA|. 1 species.       Family 4. BITTERNS, HERONS, ETC. ArdhidA|. 14 species, 3 subspecies.      The Roseate Spoonbill was formerly a common bird in Florida and along  the Gulf coast, but so many have been killed for their plumage that in  the United States the species is now exceedingly rare except in the  most remote parts of southern Florida.    Spoonbills build a rude nest of sticks in mangrove bushes or small  trees and lay three to five whitish eggs speckled with shades of  brown.    Ibises are usually found in flocks along the shore of lagoons, lakes,  etc., or in marshy places. They fly with the neck outstretched and are  generally silent. Their nests of reeds, weed stalks, etc., are  sometimes placed in low bushes, at others in grassy marshes. The eggs  number from three to five. They are plain blue in the Glossy Ibis,  greenish white with chocolate markings, in the White Ibis.    The Storks are largely Old World birds, only three of the some twenty  known species inhabiting the Western Hemisphere. But one of these is  found regularly north of the Rio Grande, the so-called Wood Ibis which  is abundant in southern Florida. It lives in flocks and builds a nest  of sticks usually in cypress trees, often forty feet from the ground,  laying two or three white eggs. When flying the neck is extended. It  progresses by alternate flapping and sailing and occasionally soars  high overhead in circles, like a Vulture.    The Bitterns and Herons unlike our other long-legged wading birds, fly  with a fold in the neck. They belong in two subfamilies, the  _BotaurinA|_ and _ArdeinA|_, respectively. The Bitterns are usually  solitary birds inhabiting grassy or reedy marshes where their colors  harmonize with their surroundings and render them difficult to see.  The American Bittern nests on the ground and lays three to five pale  brownish eggs. The Least Bittern usually weaves a platform nest of  reeds among rushes growing in the water and lays four or five bluish  white eggs.    Herons feed along the shore and are consequently more often seen than  Bitterns. With the exception of the Green Heron and the Yellow-crowned  Night Heron, which usually nest in isolated pairs, our species gather  in colonies to nest. Several hundred pairs occupying a limited area  in some wooded or bushy swamp to which, when undisturbed, they return  year after year.    Herons build a rude platform nest of sticks, sometimes placing it in  bushes, sometimes in the tallest trees, and at others on the ground or  beds of reeds in marshes. The eggs are greenish blue in color and  usually four in number. It is among those Herons, which in nesting  time are adorned with delicate plumes or aigrettes, that the greatest  ravages of the millinery hunter have been made. Attacking these birds  when they have gathered on the nesting ground, they are not permitted  to rear their young and the species is thus exterminated branch and  root.    The voice of Herons is a harsh squawk varying in depth of tone with  the size of the bird.      Flamingo, Spoonbill and Ibis      [Illustration: 182.]    =182. Flamingo= (_Phoenicopterus ruber_).

But few bones of the feet, and especially the fore feet, are present,  these smaller parts of the skeleton having been washed away before the  ponderous frame was buried in the sand, and the best that can be done is  to follow the law of probabilities and put three toes on the hind foot  and five on the fore, two of these last without claws. The single blunt  round claw among our bones shows, as do the teeth, that Triceratops was  herbivorous; it also pointed a little downward, and this tells that in  the living animal the sole of the foot was a thick, soft pad, somewhat  as it is in the elephant and rhinoceros, and that the toes were not  entirely free from one another. There are less than a dozen vertebrae and  still fewer ribs, besides half a barrelful of pieces, from which to  reconstruct a backbone twenty feet long. That the ribs are part from one  side and part from another matters no more than it did in the case of  the leg-bones; but the backbone presents a more difficult problem,  since the pieces are not like so many checkers--all made after one  pattern--but each has an individuality of its own. The total number of  vertebrae must be guessed at (perhaps it would sound better to say  estimated, but it really means the same), and knowing that some sections  are from the front part of the vertebral column and some from the back,  we must fill in the gaps as best we may. The ribs offer a little aid in  this task, giving certain details of the vertebrae, while those in turn  tell something about the adjoining parts of the ribs. We finish our  Triceratops with a tail of moderate length, as indicated by the rapid  taper of the few vertebrae available, and from these we gather, too, that  in life the tail was round, and not flattened, and that it neither  served for swimming nor for a balancing pole. And so, little by little,  have been pieced together the fragments from which we have derived our  knowledge of the past, and thus has the palaeontologist read the riddles  of the rocks.    [Illustration: Fig. 26.--Triceratops, He of the Three-horned Face. _From  a statuette by Charles R. Knight._]    To make these dry bones live again, to clothe them with flesh and  reconstruct the creature as he was or may have been in life, is, to  be honest, very largely guesswork, though to make a guess that shall  come anywhere near the mark not only demands a thorough knowledge of  anatomy--for the basis of all restoration must be the skeleton--but  calls for more than a passing acquaintance with the external appearance  of living animals. And while there is nothing in the bones to tell how  an animal is, or was, clad, they will at least show to what group the  creature belonged, and, that known, there are certain probabilities in  the case. A bird, for example, would certainly be clad in feathers.  Going a little farther, we might be pretty sure that the feathers of a  water-fowl would be thick and close; those of strictly terrestrial  birds, such as the ostrich and other flightless forms, lax and long.  These as general propositions; of course, in special cases, one might  easily come to grief, as in dealing with birds like penguins, which are  particularly adapted for an aquatic life, and have the feathers highly  modified. These birds depend upon their fat, and not on their feathers,  for warmth, and so their feathers have become a sort of cross between  scales and hairs. Hair and fur belong to mammals only, although these  creatures show much variety in their outer covering. The thoroughly  marine whales have discarded furs and adopted a smooth and slippery  skin,[9] well adapted to movement through the water, relying for warmth  on a thick undershirt of blubber. The earless seals that pass much of  their time on the ice have just enough hair to keep them from absolute  contact with it, warmth again being provided for by blubber. The fur  seals, which for several months in the year dwell largely on land, have  a coat of fur and hair, although warmth is mostly furnished, or rather  kept in, by fat.    [9] _The reader is warned that this is a mere figure of speech, for, of  course, the process of adaptation to surroundings is passive, not  active, although there is a most unfortunate tendency among writers on  evolution, and particularly on mimicry, to speak of it as active. The  writer believes that no animal in the first stages of mimicry,  consciously mimics or endeavors to resemble another animal or any part  of its surroundings, but a habit at first accidental may in time become  more or less conscious._    No reptile, therefore, would be covered with feathers, neither, judging  from those we know to-day, would they be clad in fur or hair; but, such  coverings being barred out, there remain a great variety of plates and  scales to choose from. Folds and frills, crests and dewlaps, like  beauty, are but skin deep, and, being thus superficial, ordinarily leave  no trace of their former presence, and in respect to them the  reconstructor must trust to his imagination, with the law of  probabilities as a check rein to his fancy. This law would tell us that  such ornaments must not be so placed as to be in the way, and that while  there would be a possibility--one might even say probability--of the  great, short-headed, iguana-like Dinosaurs having dewlaps, that there  would be no great likelihood of their possessing ruffs such as that of  the Australian Chlamydosaurus (mantled lizard) to flap about their ears.  Even Stegosaurus, with his bizarre array of great plates and spines,  kept them on his back, out of the way. Such festal ornamentation would,  however, more likely be found in small, active creatures, the larger  beasts contenting themselves with plates and folds.    Spines and plates usually leave some trace of their existence, for they  consist of a super-structure of skin or horn, built on a foundation of  bone; and while even horn decomposes too quickly to \"petrify,\" the bone  will become fossilized and changed into enduring stone. But while this  affords a pretty sure guide to the general shape of the investing horn,  it does not give all the details, and there may have been ridges and  furrows and sculpturing that we know not of.    Knowing, then, what the probabilities are, we have some guide to the  character of the covering that should be placed on an animal, and if we  may not be sure as to what should be done, we may be pretty certain what  should not.    For example, to depict a Dinosaur with smooth, rubbery hide walking  about on dry land would be to violate the probabilities, for only such  exclusively aquatic creatures as the whales among mammals, and the  salamanders among batrachians, are clothed in smooth, shiny skin. There  might, however, be reason to suspect that a creature largely aquatic in  its habits did occasionally venture on land, as, for instance, when  vertebrae that seem illy adapted for carrying the weight of a land animal  are found in company with huge limb-bones and massive feet we may feel  reasonably certain that their owner passed at least a portion of his  time on _terra firma_.    So much for the probabilities as to the covering of animals known to us  only by their fossil remains; but it is often possible to go beyond  this, and to state certainly how they were clad. For while the chances  are small that any trace of the covering of an extinct animal, other  than bony plates, will be preserved, Nature does now and then seem to  have relented, and occasionally some animal settled to rest where it was  so quickly and quietly covered with fine mud that the impression of  small scales, feathers, or even smooth skin, was preserved; curiously  enough, there seems to be scarcely any record of the imprint of hair.  Then, too, it is to be remembered that while the chances were very much  against such preservation, in the thousands or millions of times  creatures died the millionth chance might come uppermost.    Silhouettes of those marine reptiles, the Ichthyosaurs, have been found,  probably made by the slow carbonization of animal matter, showing not  only the form of the body and tail, but revealing the existence of an  unsuspected back fin. And yet these animals were apparently clad in a  skin as thin and smooth as that of a whale. Impressions of feathers were  known long before the discovery of Archaeopteryx; a few have been found  in the Green River and Florissant shales of Wyoming, and a Hesperornis  in the collection of the State University of Kansas shows traces of the  existence of long, soft feathers on the legs and very clear imprints of  the scales and reticulated skin that covered the tarsus. From the Chalk  of Kansas, too, came the example of Tylosaur, showing that the back of  this animal was decorated with the crest shown in Mr. Knight's  restoration, one not unlike that of the modern iguana. From the Laramie  sandstone of Montana Mr. Hatcher and Mr. Butler have obtained the  impressions of portions of the skin of the great Dinosaur, Thespesius,  which show that the covering of this animal consisted largely, if not  entirely, of small, irregularly hexagonal horny scutes, slightly  thickened in the centre. The quarries of lithographic stone at  Solenhofen have yielded a few specimens of flying reptiles,  pterodactyls, which not only verify the correctness of the inference  that these creatures possessed membranous wings, like the bats, but show  the exact shape, and it was sometimes very curious, of this membrane.  And each and all of these wonderfully preserved specimens serve both to  check and guide the restorer in his task of clothing the animal as it  was in life.    And all this help is needed, for it is an easy matter to make a  wide-sweeping"]]]
