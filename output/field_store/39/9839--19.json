By none outclassed in witchery it ranks equally in fame with the  Blarneystone of Ireland; old Plymouth Rock does not compare with it,  for that derives its prestige only from \"Mayflower pilgrims\" who  accidentally landing at its base merely stepped over it.    Proudly our Arizona stone bears a most precious burden--the tribute of  a people who in exalting patriotism honor themselves.    Originally an archaean sea-bottom rock this stone lay submerged in the  ocean until during the Jurassic Period, under the lateral pressure of a  cooling earthcrust the table-lands and mountain-chains of Arizona rose  from the seas.    Then it slumbered through several epochs of geology, representing many  millions of years in the bosom of earth, the mother, until at the  beginning of the psychozoic era, through erosion or the action of  atmospheric influences and nature's chemistry it came to the surface;  uncovered and freed from all superimposed stratified rock.    It saw the light of day long before the advent of primitive man; but  the giant-flora and fauna of pre-historic time had developed,  flourished and vanished while it rested under ground.    Contrary to the habit of rolling stones which gather no moss, this  Arizona stone accumulated much, for when it had reached its assigned  site on the plaza of Prescott it had become a very valuable, expensive  rock.    When first I saw it, this fearful Aztec juggernaut was within a half  mile of its destination. Slowly it crawled along, threatening  destruction to everything in its path, and in the course of a week had  arrived at the Granite-creek bridge.    It moved by main strength and brute force employing men and horses  after the custom of the ancients when more than thirty-seven hundred  years ago King Menes, son of Cham reigned in Egypt, who albeit surnamed  Mizrain the Laggard, yet was the first king of the first dynasty of the  children of the sun.    When I saw the direction from whence the stone had come I feared that  disaster would overwhelm our town and unfortunately was I not mistaken.    At the bridge the stone gave the first manifestation of its unholy  heathen power when it balked, defying modern civilization and through  sorcery or in other unhallowed ways contrived to interfere with the  public electric traction service, paralyzing the traffic so effectively  that every street car in the town was stopped; not merely a few hours,  but for days.    Like that colossus of strength and wisdom, the elephant which refuses  to pass over a bridge until satisfied that this will uphold its weight,  the cunning stone did not budge another inch until the bridge had been  braced with many timbers.    As foreseen by me this uncanny rock was sent by the Idol of the  mountain, the \"Sphinx of Aztlan,\" to cast a hoodoo, an evil spell over  the monument.    It caused dissension among the people and confused their minds into  rendering abnormal criticisms, making them indulge in eccentric  vagaries and speculations on the artistic and intrinsic value of the  monument. Some persons guessed at the value of the metal contained in  the statue, while others reckoned the cost of the horse or that of the  rider's accoutrements.    However, of thousands of admiring and delighted spectators none shared  an exactly like opinion except in this, that the statue bore no  individual resemblance; but that also was contradicted by a young lady  whom I heard exclaim: \"Girls, surely that looks like Buckie O'Neill,  but in love and war men are not themselves!\" \"How do I know? Oh, mamma  said so!\"    During the ceremony of unveiling the monument a dark, ragged storm  cloud hung over the Aztec mountain, fast overcasting the sky. Thousands  of people strained their eyes and held their breath in the glad  anticipation of seeing the features of their lamented friend,  Prescott's honored mayor, immortalized in bronze. When after moments of  anxious suspense the veil which draped the statue parted and fell to  earth, the sun's rays pierced the clouds, while deafening cheers rent  the air. I thought I heard a weird, faint cry, an echo from the  past--but cannons boomed, drums crashed as a military band rendered its  patriotic airs.    And we saw--not the familiar, fine features of our soldier hero, so  strikingly portrayed by a famed artist and molded into exact, lifelike  resemblance, but instead we beheld an unknown visage--a type, merely  the semblance of a \"Rough Rider,\" its rigid gaze riveted on the  Idol-mountain, forever enthralled by the Sphinx.      In nineteen hundred seven, on the third day of July    With shining mien and naming sword earthward St. Michael came    To save--ever auspicious be the blessed day--    From blighting heathen guile a Christian hero's fame    The while, breathless with awe, solemn the people gazed    And rhetoric's inspired flame on Aztlan's altar blazed.    Adore the Saints, behold a miracle Divine!    Hallowed, our Saviour, be Thy Name    And Heaven's glory thine!      Of idol-worship now has vanished every trace    In deepest crevice and highest place    On mesa, butte and mountain-face;    From the Grand Canyon's somber shade    The sun-scorched desert, the dripping glade    And sunken crater of Stoneman's Lake.    The \"Casa Grande,\" a home of ancient race--    A ruin now--is haunted by Montezuma's wraith.    In Montezuma's castle, crumbling from roof to base    The winds and rain of heaven ghosts of the past now chase.      Where erstwhile the Great Spirit's children dwelt    Forever hushed is the papoose's wail, and stilled the squaw's          low-crooning lilt.    No longer shimmers starlight from eyes of savage maids    Worshippers of the fire and sun, poor dwellers of the caves--    The sisters of the deer and lo, shy startled fawns of Aztec race    Or coy ancestral dams of moon-eyed Toltec doe.    Now Verde witches bathe in Montezuma's well    And over its crystal waters the tourists cast their spell.      Rejoice! To Arizona has the Saviour vouchsafed His Grace    For our Salvation Army lass teaches true Gospel faith:    \"Be saved this night, poor sinner, repent, the hour is late!    Salvation is in store for thee, brother do not delay    As fleeting time and sudden death for no man ever wait!\"    \"Praise God!\" the lassie's war-cry is, the keynote of her song.    To the tune of \"Annie Roonie\" and kindred fervid lay    With mandolin and banjo, marching in bold array    The devil's strongholds storming, battling to victory--    With banners flying, the tambourine and drum    Forever has she silenced the shamans vile tom-tom.    All Fetish Spirit-medicine she has tabooed, banished away    Except bourbon and rye, sour-mash, hand-made    And copper-distilled, licensed, taxed and gauged,    Then stored in bond to ripen, mellow, age.    God bless the Army, rank and file who fight our souls to save!    Modern disciples of the Son of Man, true followers of Christ,    They work by day, then preach and pray and pound their drum at night.          L'ENVOY.      Farewell, this ends my rhyming, submitted at its worth.    Lest I forget--pride goes before the fall, on earth    And exceeding fine if slowly, grind the mills of angry gods--    The muses' steed, a versifying bronco had I caught    And recklessly I rode; but fast as thought    Fate overtook me when Pegasus bucked me off.    Sorely distressed I hear a satyr's mocking laugh    As on my laurels resting, on my seat of honor cast    And thanking you for kind attention now your indulgent censure ask.        THE BIRTH OF ARIZONA. (AN ALLEGORICAL TALE.)    On the summit of a mountain I staked my claim; in the shade of a  balsam-spruce I built my hut.    When the south wind that rises on the desert climbs to the mountain's  ridge and rustling among silvery needles, rattles the cones on boughs  and twigs--the tree-giant whispers with resinous breath, bemoaning the  fate of a prehistoric civilization, and lisps of the mystery and  romance of a humanity long extinct, mourning for races forgotten and  vanished.    Alone--unrivaled in her weird, wild grandeur stands Arizona where spiry  rock-ribbed giants stab an emerald, opal-tinted sky, and terraced mesas  of wondrous amber hue form natural stairways, that grandly wrought were  carved step after step, through successive epochs of erosion, affording  thus an easy ascent to the rugged profile of this land of the Western  Hemisphere. All this is of historic record in stony cypher of geology  indelibly engraved by time on the rocky walls of deepest canyons, as  traceable from the primordial archaean to our present era, the age of  man.    In tremor-spasms of terrestrial creation, 'midst chaotic fiery turmoil  of volcanos, out of the depth of globe-encircling waters, from the womb  of Universe--Eternity--came the Almighty Word, and then was born fair  Arizona.    Fraught with golden prophecy was her horoscope, cast by fate's oracle  for her birthday fell under the sign of the scorpion when in the path  of planets Venus contended with the Earth for first place of ascendency  to the second house of the heavens.    High above the tidal wave rose Arizona, as fleecy clouds float in the  rays of Apollo's sun-torch when at eventide his flaming chariot plunges  into unfathomed depths of the Pacific Ocean.    With her first breath this daughter of Columbia, born of gods, clamored  for aid. Neptune was first among the planets to heed the plaintive cry  and held her to his breast, with fond caresses.    The grandest canyon on the face of earth with flowing streams and  limpid crystals he gave her as a birthday present.    These crystals rare are famed as Arizona diamonds now.    Bright, lovely Venus, the sister of Earth, a shining planet, gave the  ruby-red garnet, her pledge of love and Arizona hid it in her bosom.  There shall you find it, if worthy so you be, in the hearts of happy "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43008"],[0,"Around the Yule Log (#16)"],[1,"was wanted  of it. Never a squeak it gave, as Claus, with infinite pains, drew  back the rusty bolt and softly opened it.    He stepped inside the room, shading the lamp with his hand. It was a  very small room indeed, with great holes in the bare plastering, and a  broken pane of glass through which the keen wind was blowing. The room  was even colder than the fireplace.    In one corner was a small bed, and in it lay a little girl of perhaps  six years, her tangled hair scattered over the bundle of ragged  clothes--evidently her own poor little gown--that served for a pillow;  the dingy counterpane drawn tightly up around her neck to keep out the  bitter cold. There was a broken chair and wooden table in the room  besides; nothing else.    From the back of the chair, which was propped against the wall close  by the bed, hung one small stocking; so small that it seemed better  fitted for a doll than a living human child; only no self-respecting  doll would have worn a stocking so ragged.    The old man set down his lamp and tiptoed back to the fireplace. He  took out the toys one by one, and placed them on the floor. He filled  the poor little stocking with candy; the first package of which came  near betraying him by falling directly through a large hole in the  heel. Luckily he caught it before it reached the floor, and squeezed  in a good-sized rubber ball to replace it.    Last of all he took up the sheep, with a sigh of relief at his success  in depositing all his gifts in the room without disturbing the small  sleeper.    But alas for human calculations! In his excitement he gave that  dreadful sheep an unlucky squeeze, and without the slightest warning  it gave utterance to another prolonged _baa-a-a!_ even louder than  before.    The child opened her eyes wide and sat up in bed. There stood, in  front of a new and cavernous fireplace in the wall, an old man with  shaggy coat and cap, and flowing white beard, his stooping back  sprinkled with snow, with a lamb in his arms, and surrounded with such  a glory of toys as she had never dreamed of in her little starved  life.    One moment only she gazed; then leaped from her bed and sprang into  his arms, crying: \"O Santa Claus! Santa Claus! Have you come! Oh, take  me away with you, do, do!\"    At the child's first cry of \"Santa Claus!\" the old man stood  stupefied, shaking his head and muttering \"Jonathan R.\"; but when she  came flying to him, he caught her up in his arms, wrapping his great  fur coat about her and holding them close to his heart--God's little  lamb and the woolly one--without a word.    Before he could fairly collect his wits, he heard that heavy,  irregular footfall coming up the stairs.    He had only one thought--to save the child. Backing hastily into the  fireplace he closed and bolted the door behind him, groped his way up  the stone steps, and sat down in front of his own fire, breathless,  with his new-found treasure still in his arms. The faint sound of a  cry came up from the room below, but whether it was of terror, or  delight at finding such extraordinary personal property miraculously  substituted for the late occupant, he could not tell.    The light of the fire, on which Claus had thrown fresh fuel, shone  upon the child face upraised to his.    \"What is your name, little one?\" he asked in tones he hardly  recognized as his own.    They called her Moll, she said, but that was not her real name, which  she had forgotten.    \"How would you like to be called 'Agnes'?\" said Claus, his old eyes  growing misty over some long-buried memory.    \"Oh, that's a nice name, Santa Claus! And I'm _so_ sleepy!\"    The old housekeeper was thereupon roused from her slumbers in a  distant corner of the house, and the child put to bed in her own room  in a couch hastily improvised from chairs and blankets.    Next morning Old Claus, feeling very much more like Young Claus than  he had for years, put an end to the wonderful stories flying about the  neighborhood by acknowledging his own agency in little Agnes'  disappearance. An arrangement was easily made with the dissipated  woman who, it seemed, had taken charge of the child and ill-used her  cruelly since her mother's death. The proper papers having been drawn,  Mr. Jonathan Claus became the legal guardian of the little waif, with  whom he shortly afterward removed to a more cheerful quarter of the  city.    Agnes lost all her Christmas presents, to be sure, for not one of them  ever could be found--except the sheep which had brought her good  fortune, and who was allowed to _baa_ to his heart's content that  Christmas day; but Santa Claus (as she persisted in calling her  deliverer) replaced them, with interest.    That is the way Old Claus found his treasure; not only little Agnes,  though she soon became dearer to him than all his wealth, but that  most precious of treasures, Love.          X    CHARITY AND EVERGREEN      I    \"Well, for my part, I could never, never forgive a man who did such a  thing!\"    It was late in the afternoon of a clear, cold day in December when  Charity Holmes, sitting in the midst of a spicy mound of evergreen on  Farmer Ralston's kitchen floor, and looking up from her work with a  bright flush on her pretty cheeks, made this severe remark. Of the  three other women in the room, two, the farmer's daughters, young  girls like herself, were quite of her opinion; but the fourth, a  white-haired old lady with lavender bows on her cap and sunshine in  her motherly face, patted the nearest indignant girl's shoulder  reprovingly, and remarked:    \"There, there, dears; don't be so hard. We're all of us human, and  drink's a terrible thing. Sometimes it don't seem any more a man's  fault than tumbling into a hole in the road.\"    \"But if he has dug the hole himself, grandmother\"--    Any further argument was interrupted at this point by the appearance  of an immense bundle of evergreen at one of the windows, entirely  blocking up its small, frosty panes. Presently an honest and merry  face showed itself down at one corner.    \"It's Tom, with more green!\" cried the two Ralston girls, jumping up  and running to the porch door to let in the big brother.    Charity stayed behind with grandmother, but Tom's eyes found her in a  twinkling. How demurely she sat there, tying away with all her might,  while the awkward fellow made a great to-do piling up his load beside  her, and managed to get hold of somebody's hand down among the  princess-pines, and--then something happened behind grandmother's back  that made somebody's fresh young cheeks pinker than ever.    \"Tom, Tom!\" cried Charity, shaking her head as soberly as if she  hadn't been the cause of his mischief.    \"Yes, ma'am,\" answered innocent Tom. \"Want some more?\"    \"Now, Tom, if you're really going to stay you must work in good  earnest. Just pick out some good long strings of 'creeping Jenny' and  lay them right beside me--so!\"    Thereupon Tom, great, breezy, good-natured Tom, doubled himself up on  the floor, boots and all, and pretended to immerse himself, body and  mind, in the complicated task assigned him, meanwhile blundering in  the most absurd manner, and continually mistaking that bewildering  little hand for the delicate vines, and at the same time winking at  grandmother, thereby confusing her and making her feel that she was an  accomplice; and in fact conducting himself altogether so outrageously  that the girls ended by pelting him with evergreens until he escaped  to the woodshed, where the ringing blows of his axe soon gave notice  that he was making ready for the blaze in the great fireplace that was  to brighten the long winter evening before them.    Charity was the daughter of a neighbor. She and Tom Ralston had played  together since they were babies; then, leaving the district school,  and entering upon the heavier duties of life, they had grown bashful,  and kept away from each other just long enough to find out that they  could not possibly do so any longer. So they were engaged, to the  quiet satisfaction of both families. The marriage was to be on New  Year's and the young folks were working hard on their evergreen  trimming, which Tom had promised to take up to the city, a dozen miles  away, and sell for them, the day before Christmas. Charity was to go  with him, as she had a few little purchases to make; and besides, she  had never seen the city at this \"holiday season,\" when it is at its  merriest.    Swiftly the full, busy days flew by. The evening before they were to  start, Tom was walking home with Charity. As they reached the little  plot of ground before her house they looked up into the starlit,  moonlit sky. At least Charity did. I am afraid Tom was finding moon  and stars and no end of things more precious to him in the grave brown  eyes so near his own.    \"No, Tom,\" said she, answering his look, \"I'm just thinking about--up  there! and all we can be to each other and the rest of the world.\"    \"My darling! I wish I were a good man, I wish I were stronger! If it  were not for you!\"--    He checked himself, and she could feel the brace of his muscles under  the coatsleeve where her hand rested, as if he were even then fighting  with some invisible foe. A light cloud came over the moon's face, and  the road and fields, covered with new-fallen snow, looked colder than  before. She shivered, and drew more closely to his side. He was quick  to read her thoughts, this big, clumsy fellow, and he spoke instantly.    \"I know, Rita,\" he said, softly, stroking her hand and using the pet  name that he had made for her when they were children; \"I know you'll  stand by me through everything. And, whatever evil things I have in  me, with you at my side, I'll try to put down. Heaven help me!\"    He took off his cap, and Charity thought she never saw him look so  noble and humble and manly as he did then. The moon, too, was out  again, and its light rested like a benediction on his "]]]
