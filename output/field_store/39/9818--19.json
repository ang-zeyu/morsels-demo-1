But there were periods of laxity. Punishment was by the cane or scourge.            The Archbishop of Canterbury began anointing new kings at the  time of coronation to emphasize that the king was ruler by the grace of  God. As God's minister, the king could only do right. From 973, the new  king swore to protect the Christian church, to prevent inequities to  all subjects, and to render good justice, which became a standard oath.            It was believed that there was a celestial hierarchy, with  heavenly hosts in specific places. The heavenly bodies revolved in  circles around the earthly world on crystal spheres of their own, which  were serene, harmonious, and eternal. This contrasted with the change,  death, and decay that occurred in the earthly world. Also in this  world, Aristotle's four elements of earth, air, fire, and water sought  their natural places, e.g. bubbles of air rising through water. The  planets were called wanderers because their motion did not fit the  circular scheme.            God intervened in daily life, especially if worshipped. Jesus  Christ, his mother the Virgin Mary and saints were also worshipped.  Saints such as Bede and Hilda performed miracles, especially ones of  curing. Their spirits could be contacted through their relics, which  rested at the altars of churches. Sin resulted in misfortune. When  someone was said to have the devil in him, people took it quite  literally. Omens fortold events. A real Jack Frost nipped noses and  fingers and made the ground too hard to work. Little people, elves,  trolls, and fairies inhabited the fears and imaginings of people. The  forest was the mysterious home of spirits. People prayed to God to help  them in their troubles and from the work of the devil. Prayer was often  a charm to conjure up friendly spirits rather than an act of  supplication. Sorcerers controlled the forces of nature with the aid of  spirits. Since natural causes of events were unknown, people attributed  events to wills like their own. Illness and disease were thought to be  caused by demons and witches. To cure illness, people hung charms  around their neck and went to good witches for treatments of magic and  herbs. For instance, the remedy for \"mental vacancy and folly\" was a  drink of \"fennel, agrimony, cockle, and marche\".Some herbs had  hallucinogenic effects, which were probably useful for pain. Blood-  letting by leeches and cautery were used for most maladies, which were  thought to be caused by imbalance of the four bodily humors: sanguine,  phlegmatic, choleric, and melancholic. These four humors reflected the  four basic elements air, water, fire, and earth. Blood was hot and  moist like air; phlegm was cold and moist like water; choler or yellow  bile was hot and dry like fire; and melancholy or black bile was cold  and dry like earth. Bede had explained that when blood predominates, it  makes people joyful, glad, sociable, laughing, and talking a great  deal. Phlegm renders them slow, sleepy, and forgetful. Red cholic makes  them thin, though eating much, swift, bold, wrathful, and agile. Black  cholic makes them serious of settled disposition, even sad. To relieve  brain pressure and/or maybe to exorcise evil spirits, holes were made  in skulls by a drill with a metal tip that was caused to turn back and  forth by a strap wrapped around a wooden handle. A king's daughter  Edith inspired a cult of holy wells, whose waters were thought to  alleviate eye conditions. Warmth and rest were also used for illness.  Agrimony boiled in milk was thought to relieve impotence in men.            It was known that the liver casted out impurities in the blood.  The stages of fetal growth were known. The soul was not thought to  enter a fetus until after the third month, so presumably abortions  within three months were allowable.            The days of the week were Sun day, Moon day, Tiw's day (Viking  god of war), Woden's day (Viking god of victory, master magician,  calmer of storms, and raiser of the dead), Thor's day (Viking god of  thunder), Frig's day (Viking goddess of fertility and growing things),  and Saturn's day (Roman god). Special days of the year were celebrated:  Christmas, the birthday of Jesus Christ; the twelve days of Yuletide (a  Viking tradition) when candles were lit and houses decorated with  evergreen and there were festivities around the burning of the biggest  log available; Plough Monday for resumption of work after Yuletide;  February 14th with a feast celebrating Saint Valentinus, a Roman bishop  martyr who had married young lovers in secret when marriage was  forbidden to encourage men to fight in war; New Year's Day on March  25th when seed was sown and people banged on drums and blew horns to  banish spirits who destroy crops with disease; Easter, the day of the  resurrection of Jesus Christ; Whitsunday, celebrating the descent of  the Holy Spirit on the apostles of Jesus and named for the white worn  by baptismal candidates; May Day when flowers and greenery was gathered  from the woods to decorate houses and churches, Morris dancers leapt  through their villages with bells, hobby horses, and waving scarves,  and people danced around a May pole holding colorful ribbons tied at  the top so they became entwined around the pole; Lammas on August 1st,  when the first bread baked from the wheat harvest was consecrated;  Harvest Home when the last harvest load was brought home while an  effigy of a goddess was carried with reapers singing and piping behind,  and October 31st, the eve of the Christian designated All Hallow Day,  which then became known as All Hallow Even, or Halloween. People  dressed as demons, hobgoblins, and witches to keep spirits away from  possessing them. Trick or treating began with Christian beggars asking  for \"soul cake\" biscuits in return for praying for dead relatives.  Ticktacktoe and backgammon were played.            The languages of invaders had produced a hybrid language that  was roughly understood throughout the country. The existence of Europe,  Africa, Asia, and India were known. Jerusalem was thought to be at the  center of the world. There was an annual tax of a penny on every  hearth, Peter's pence, to be collected and sent to the pope in Rome  yearly. Ecclesiastical benefices were to pay church-scot, a payment in  lieu of first fruits of the land, to the pope.                           The Law            There were several kings in this period. The king and witan  deliberated on the making of new laws, both secular and spiritual, at  the regularly held witanagemot. There was a standard legal requirement  of holding every man accountable, though expressed in different ways,  such as the following three:            Every freeman who does not hold land must find a lord to answer  for him. Every lord shall be personally responsible as surety for the  men of his household. [This included female lords.] (King Athelstan)            \"And every man shall see that he has a surety, and this surety  shall bring and keep him to [the performance of] every lawful duty.  1. -And if anyone does wrong and escapes, his surety shall incur what  the other should have incurred.  2. -If the case be that of a thief and his surety can lay hold of him  within twelve months, he shall deliver him up to justice, and what he  has paid shall be returned to him.\" (King Edgar)            Every freeman who holds land, except lords with considerable  landed property, must be in a local tithing, usually ten to twelve men,  in which they serve as personal sureties for each other's peaceful  behavior. If one of the ten landholders in a tithing is accused of an  offense, the others have to produce him in court or pay a fine plus pay  the injured party for the offense, unless they could prove that they  had no complicity in it. If the man is found guilty but can not pay,  his tithing must pay his fine. The chief officer is the \"tithing man\"  or \"capital pledge\". There were probably ten tithings in a hundred.  (King Edward the Confessor).    Canute reigned from 1016 to 1035. The following are substantially all  the laws of Canute with an * before ones of special interest.            Proclamations of Canute are:    All my reeves, under pain of forfeiting my friendship and all that they  possess and their own lives, shall govern my people justly everywhere,  and to pronounce just judgments with the cognizance of the bishops of  the dioceses, and to inflict such mitigated penalties as the bishop may  approve and the man himself may be able to bear.    I enjoin upon all the sheriffs and reeves throughout my kingdom that,  as they desire to retain my friendship and their own sercurity, they  employ no unjust force towards any man, either rich or poor, but that  all, both nobles and commoners, rich and poor, shall have their right  of just possession, which shall not be infringed upon in any way,  either for the sake of obtaining the favour of the king or of  gratifying any powerful person or of collecting money for me; and I  have no need that monoey should be collected for me by any unust  exactions.            Ecclesiastical laws of Canute are:    Above all else, love and honour one God, and uphold one Christian  faith, and love King Canute with due fidlity.    *Maintain the security and sanctity of the churches of God, and  frequently attend them for the salvation of our souls and our own  benefit. He who violates the protection given by the church of God  within its walls, or the protection granted by a Christian king in  person shall lose both land and life, unless the king is willing to  pardon him.        Homicide within the church's walls shall not be  atoned for by any payment of compensation, and everyone shall pursue  the miscreant, unless it happen that he escapes from there and reaches  so inviolable a sanctuary that the king, because of that, grants him  his life, upon"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4081"],[0,"The Alchemist (#16)"],[1," that too?
