Evidently he had looked for the bald pate of a thern.    \"You are indeed of another world,\" he said, a touch of awe in his  voice.  \"With the skin of a thern, the black hair of a First Born and  the muscles of a dozen Dators it was no disgrace even for Xodar to  acknowledge your supremacy.  A thing he could never do were you a  Barsoomian,\" he added.    \"You are travelling several laps ahead of me, my friend,\" I  interrupted.  \"I glean that your name is Xodar, but whom, pray, are the  First Born, and what a Dator, and why, if you were conquered by a  Barsoomian, could you not acknowledge it?\"    \"The First Born of Barsoom,\" he explained, \"are the race of black men  of which I am a Dator, or, as the lesser Barsoomians would say, Prince.  My race is the oldest on the planet.  We trace our lineage, unbroken,  direct to the Tree of Life which flourished in the centre of the Valley  Dor twenty-three million years ago.    \"For countless ages the fruit of this tree underwent the gradual  changes of evolution, passing by degrees from true plant life to a  combination of plant and animal.  In the first stages the fruit of the  tree possessed only the power of independent muscular action, while the  stem remained attached to the parent plant; later a brain developed in  the fruit, so that hanging there by their long stems they thought and  moved as individuals.    \"Then, with the development of perceptions came a comparison of them;  judgments were reached and compared, and thus reason and the power to  reason were born upon Barsoom.    \"Ages passed.  Many forms of life came and went upon the Tree of Life,  but still all were attached to the parent plant by stems of varying  lengths.  At length the fruit tree consisted in tiny plant men, such as  we now see reproduced in such huge dimensions in the Valley Dor, but  still hanging to the limbs and branches of the tree by the stems which  grew from the tops of their heads.    \"The buds from which the plant men blossomed resembled large nuts about  a foot in diameter, divided by double partition walls into four  sections.  In one section grew the plant man, in another a  sixteen-legged worm, in the third the progenitor of the white ape and  in the fourth the primaeval black man of Barsoom.    \"When the bud burst the plant man remained dangling at the end of his  stem, but the three other sections fell to the ground, where the  efforts of their imprisoned occupants to escape sent them hopping about  in all directions.    \"Thus as time went on, all Barsoom was covered with these imprisoned  creatures.  For countless ages they lived their long lives within their  hard shells, hopping and skipping about the broad planet; falling into  rivers, lakes, and seas, to be still further spread about the surface  of the new world.    \"Countless billions died before the first black man broke through his  prison walls into the light of day.  Prompted by curiosity, he broke  open other shells and the peopling of Barsoom commenced.    \"The pure strain of the blood of this first black man has remained  untainted by admixture with other creatures in the race of which I am a  member; but from the sixteen-legged worm, the first ape and renegade  black man has sprung every other form of animal life upon Barsoom.    \"The therns,\" and he smiled maliciously as he spoke, \"are but the  result of ages of evolution from the pure white ape of antiquity.  They  are a lower order still.  There is but one race of true and immortal  humans on Barsoom.  It is the race of black men.    \"The Tree of Life is dead, but before it died the plant men learned to  detach themselves from it and roam the face of Barsoom with the other  children of the First Parent.    \"Now their bisexuality permits them to reproduce themselves after the  manner of true plants, but otherwise they have progressed but little in  all the ages of their existence.  Their actions and movements are  largely matters of instinct and not guided to any great extent by  reason, since the brain of a plant man is but a trifle larger than the  end of your smallest finger.  They live upon vegetation and the blood  of animals, and their brain is just large enough to direct their  movements in the direction of food, and to translate the food  sensations which are carried to it from their eyes and ears.  They have  no sense of self-preservation and so are entirely without fear in the  face of danger.  That is why they are such terrible antagonists in  combat.\"    I wondered why the black man took such pains to discourse thus at  length to enemies upon the genesis of life Barsoomian.  It seemed a  strangely inopportune moment for a proud member of a proud race to  unbend in casual conversation with a captor.  Especially in view of the  fact that the black still lay securely bound upon the deck.    It was the faintest straying of his eye beyond me for the barest  fraction of a second that explained his motive for thus dragging out my  interest in his truly absorbing story.    He lay a little forward of where I stood at the levers, and thus he  faced the stern of the vessel as he addressed me.  It was at the end of  his description of the plant men that I caught his eye fixed  momentarily upon something behind me.    Nor could I be mistaken in the swift gleam of triumph that brightened  those dark orbs for an instant.    Some time before I had reduced our speed, for we had left the Valley  Dor many miles astern, and I felt comparatively safe.    I turned an apprehensive glance behind me, and the sight that I saw  froze the new-born hope of freedom that had been springing up within me.    A great battleship, forging silent and unlighted through the dark  night, loomed close astern.          CHAPTER VIII    THE DEPTHS OF OMEAN      Now I realized why the black pirate had kept me engrossed with his  strange tale.  For miles he had sensed the approach of succour, and but  for that single tell-tale glance the battleship would have been  directly above us in another moment, and the boarding party which was  doubtless even now swinging in their harness from the ship's keel,  would have swarmed our deck, placing my rising hope of escape in sudden  and total eclipse.    I was too old a hand in aerial warfare to be at a loss now for the  right manoeuvre.  Simultaneously I reversed the engines and dropped the  little vessel a sheer hundred feet.    Above my head I could see the dangling forms of the boarding party as  the battleship raced over us.  Then I rose at a sharp angle, throwing  my speed lever to its last notch.    Like a bolt from a crossbow my splendid craft shot its steel prow  straight at the whirring propellers of the giant above us.  If I could  but touch them the huge bulk would be disabled for hours and escape  once more possible.    At the same instant the sun shot above the horizon, disclosing a  hundred grim, black faces peering over the stern of the battleship upon  us.    At sight of us a shout of rage went up from a hundred throats.  Orders  were shouted, but it was too late to save the giant propellers, and  with a crash we rammed them.    Instantly with the shock of impact I reversed my engine, but my prow  was wedged in the hole it had made in the battleship's stern.  Only a  second I hung there before tearing away, but that second was amply long  to swarm my deck with black devils.    There was no fight.  In the first place there was no room to fight.  We  were simply submerged by numbers.  Then as swords menaced me a command  from Xodar stayed the hands of his fellows.    \"Secure them,\" he said, \"but do not injure them.\"    Several of the pirates already had released Xodar.  He now personally  attended to my disarming and saw that I was properly bound.  At least  he thought that the binding was secure.  It would have been had I been  a Martian, but I had to smile at the puny strands that confined my  wrists.  When the time came I could snap them as they had been cotton  string.    The girl they bound also, and then they fastened us together.  In the  meantime they had brought our craft alongside the disabled battleship,  and soon we were transported to the latter's deck.    Fully a thousand black men manned the great engine of destruction.  Her  decks were crowded with them as they pressed forward as far as  discipline would permit to get a glimpse of their captives.    The girl's beauty elicited many brutal comments and vulgar jests.  It  was evident that these self-thought supermen were far inferior to the  red men of Barsoom in refinement and in chivalry.    My close-cropped black hair and thern complexion were the subjects of  much comment.  When Xodar told his fellow nobles of my fighting ability  and strange origin they crowded about me with numerous questions.    The fact that I wore the harness and metal of a thern who had been  killed by a member of my party convinced them that I was an enemy of  their hereditary foes, and placed me on a better footing in their  estimation.    Without exception the blacks were handsome men, and well built.  The  officers were conspicuous through the wondrous magnificence of their  resplendent trappings.  Many harnesses were so encrusted with gold,  platinum, silver and precious stones as to entirely hide the leather  beneath.    The harness of the commanding officer was a solid mass of diamonds.  Against the ebony background of his skin they blazed out with a  peculiarly accentuated effulgence.  The whole scene was enchanting.  The handsome men; the barbaric splendour of the accoutrements; the  polished skeel wood of the deck; the gloriously grained sorapus of the  cabins, inlaid with priceless jewels and precious metals in intricate  and beautiful design; the burnished gold of hand rails; the shining  metal of the guns.    Phaidor and I were taken below decks, where, still"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6422"],[0,"The Life, Adventures & Piracies of the Famous Captain Singleton (#16)"],[1,"eat out of our hand, lick our  feet, and were as tractable as a dog.    We drove with us six or seven cows for food; but our negroes knew  nothing of curing the flesh by salting and drying it till we showed them  the way, and then they were mighty willing to do so as long as we had  any salt to do it with, and to carry salt a great way too, after we  found we should have no more.    It was an easy march to the river side for us that went by land, and  we came thither in a piece of a day, being, as above, no more than six  English miles; whereas it was no less than five days before they came  to us by water, the wind in the bay having failed them, and the way, by  reason of a great turn or reach in the river, being about fifty miles  about.    We spent this time in a thing which the two strangers, which brought the  prince the two lances, put into the head of the prisoners, viz., to make  bottles of the goats' skins to carry fresh water in, which it seems they  knew we should come to want; and the men did it so dexterously, having  dried skins fetched them by those two men, that before our vessel came  up, they had every man a pouch like a bladder, to carry fresh water in,  hanging over their shoulders by a thong made of other skins, about three  inches broad, like the sling of a fuzee.    Our prince, to assure us of the fidelity of the men in this march,  had ordered them to be tied two and two by the wrist, as we handcuff  prisoners in England; and made them so sensible of the reasonableness of  it, that he made them do it themselves, appointing four of them to bind  the rest; but we found them so honest, and particularly so obedient  to him, that after we were gotten a little further off of their own  country, we set them at liberty, though, when he came to us, he would  have them tied again, and they continued so a good while.    All the country on the bank of the river was a high land, no marshy  swampy ground in it; the verdure good, and abundance of cattle feeding  upon it wherever we went, or which way soever we looked; there was  not much wood indeed, at least not near us; but further up we saw oak,  cedar, and pine-trees, some of which were very large.    The river was a fair open channel, about as broad as the Thames below  Gravesend, and a strong tide of flood, which we found held us about  sixty miles; the channel deep, nor did we find any want of water for a  great way. In short, we went merrily up the river with the flood and  the wind blowing still fresh at E. and E.N.E. We stemmed the ebb easily  also, especially while the river continued broad and deep; but when we  came past the swelling of the tide, and had the natural current of the  river to go against, we found it too strong for us, and began to think  of quitting our bark; but the prince would by no means agree to that,  for, finding we had on board pretty good store of roping made of mats  and flags, which I described before, he ordered all the prisoners which  were on shore to come and take hold of those ropes, and tow us along by  the shore side; and as we hoisted our sail too, to ease them, the men  ran along with us at a very great rate.    In this manner the river carried us up, by our computation, near 200  miles, and then it narrowed apace, and was not above as broad as the  Thames is at Windsor, or thereabouts; and, after another day, we came  to a great waterfall or cataract, enough to fright us, for I believe the  whole body of water fell at once perpendicularly down a precipice  above sixty foot high, which made noise enough to deprive men of their  hearing, and we heard it above ten miles before we came to it.    Here we were at a full stop, and now our prisoners went first on shore;  they had worked very hard and very cheerfully, relieving one another,  those that were weary being taken into the bark. Had we had canoes or  any boats which might have been carried by men's strength we might have  gone two hundred miles more up this river in small boats, but our great  boat could go no farther.    All this way the country looked green and pleasant, and was full of  cattle, and some people we saw, though not many; but this we observed  now, that the people did no more understand our prisoners here than  we could understand them; being, it seems, of different nations and of  different speech. We had yet seen no wild beasts, or, at least, none  that came very near us, except two days before we came to the waterfall,  when we saw three of the most beautiful leopards that ever were seen,  standing upon the bank of the river on the north side, our prisoners  being all on the other side of the water. Our gunner espied them first,  and ran to fetch his gun, putting a ball extraordinary in it; and coming  to me, \"Now, Captain Bob,\" says he, \"where is your prince?\" So I called  him out. \"Now,\" says he, \"tell your men not to be afraid; tell them they  shall see that thing in his hand speak in fire to one of those beasts,  and make it kill itself.\"    The poor negroes looked as if they had been all going to be killed,  notwithstanding what their prince said to them, and stood staring to  expect the issue, when on a sudden the gunner fired; and as he was a  very good marksman, he shot the creature with two slugs, just in the  head. As soon as the leopard felt herself struck, she reared up on her  two hind-legs, bolt upright, and throwing her forepaws about in the air,  fell backward, growling and struggling, and immediately died; the other  two, frighted with the fire and the noise, fled, and were out of sight  in an instant.    But the two frighted leopards were not in half the consternation that  our prisoners were; four or five of them fell down as if they had been  shot; several others fell on their knees, and lifted up their hands to  us; whether to worship us, or pray us not to kill them, we did not know;  but we made signs to their prince to encourage them, which he did, but  it was with much ado that he brought them to their senses. Nay, the  prince, notwithstanding all that was said to prepare him for it, yet  when the piece went off, he gave a start as if he would have leaped into  the river.    When we saw the creature killed, I had a great mind to have the skin of  her, and made signs to the prince that he should send some of his men  over to take the skin off. As soon as he spoke but a word, four of them,  that offered themselves, were untied, and immediately they jumped into  the river, and swam over, and went to work with him. The prince having a  knife that we gave him, made four wooden knives so clever, that I never  saw anything like them in my life; and in less than an hour's time they  brought me the skin of the leopard, which was a monstrous great one, for  it was from the ears to the tale about seven foot, and near five foot  broad on the back, and most admirably spotted all over. The skin of this  leopard I brought to London many years after.    We were now all upon a level as to our travelling, being unshipped, for  our bark would swim no farther, and she was too heavy to carry on our  backs; but as we found the course of the river went a great way farther,  we consulted our carpenters whether we could not pull the bark in  pieces, and make us three or four small boats to go on with. They told  us we might do so, but it would be very long a-doing; and that, when  we had done, we had neither pitch or tar to make them sound to keep the  water out, or nails to fasten the plank. But one of them told us that as  soon as he could come at any large tree near the river, he would make  us a canoe or two in a quarter of the time, and which would serve us  as well for all the uses we could have any occasion for as a boat; and  such, that if we came to any waterfalls, we might take them up, and  carry them for a mile or two by land upon our shoulders.    Upon this we gave over the thoughts of our frigate, and hauling her into  a little cove or inlet, where a small brook came into the main river,  we laid her up for those that came next, and marched forward. We spent  indeed two days dividing our baggage, and loading our tame buffaloes  and our negroes. Our powder and shot, which was the thing we were most  careful of, we ordered thus:--First, the powder we divided into little  leather bags, that is to say, bags of dried skins, with the hair inward,  that the powder might not grow damp; and then we put those bags into  other bags, made of bullocks' skins, very thick and hard, with the hair  outward, that no wet might come in; and this succeeded so well, that in  the greatest rains we had, whereof some were very violent and very long,  we always kept our powder dry. Besides these bags, which held our chief  magazine, we divided to every one a quarter of a pound of powder, and  half a pound of shot, to carry always about us; which, as it was enough  for our present use, so we were willing to have no weight to carry more  than was absolutely necessary, because of the heat.    We kept still on the bank of the river, and for that reason had but very  little communication with the people of the country; for, having also  our bark stored with plenty of provisions, we had no occasion to look  abroad for a supply; but now, when we came to march on foot, we were  obliged often to seek out for food. The first place we came to on the  river, that gave us any stop, was a little negro town, containing about  fifty huts, and there appeared about 400 people, for they all came out  to see us, and wonder at us. When our negroes appeared the inhabitants  began to fly to arms, thinking there had been enemies coming upon them;  but our negroes, though they could not speak their language, made signs  to them that they had no weapons, and were tied two and two together as  captives, and that there were people behind who came from the sun, and  that could kill them all, and make them alive again, if they pleased;  but that they would do them no"]]]
