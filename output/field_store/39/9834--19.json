Tom scrambled in and out among the boulders, in spite  of the pain it caused his wounded leg. He was anxious to know who  the other castaways were, and how they had come there.    Several of the larger party were now advancing to meet the lad and  his friends. Tom could see two women and seven men.    A moment later, when the lad had a good view of one of the ladies  and a gentleman, he could not repress a cry of astonishment. Then he  rubbed his eyes to make sure it was not some blur or defect of  vision. No, his first impression had been correct.    \"Mr. Nestor!\" cried Tom, recognizing the father of his girl friend.  \"And Mrs. Nestor!\" he added a moment later.    \"Why--of all things--look--Amos--it's--it can't be possible--and  yet--why, it's Tom Swift!\" cried the lady.    \"Tom--Tom Swift--here?\" ejaculated the man at her side.    \"Yes--Tom Swift--the young inventor--of Shopton--don't you know--the  lad who saved Mary's life in the runaway--Tom Swift!\"    \"Tom Swift!\" murmured Mr. Nestor. \"Is it possible!\"    \"I'm Tom Swift, all right,\" answered the owner of that name, \"but  how in the world did you get on this island, Mr. Nestor?\"    \"I might ask you the same thing, Tom. The yacht RESOLUTE, on which  we were making a voyage to the West Indies, as guests of Mr. George  Hosbrook, was wrecked in the awful gale. We took to the boats and  managed to reach this island. The yacht sunk, and we only had a  little food. We are almost starved! But how came you here?\"    \"Mr. Fenwick's airship was wrecked, and we dropped down here. What a  coincidence! To think that I should meet you here! But if you're  hungry, it's the best thing in the world that we met you, for,  though our airship was wrecked, we have a large supply of food. Come  over to our camp, and we'll give you all you want!\"    Tom had rushed forward, and was shaking hands with Mary's parents,  so unexpectedly met with, when Mr. Nestor called out:    \"Come over here, Mr. Hosbrook. I want you to meet a friend of mine.\"    A moment later, the millionaire owner of the ill-fated RESOLUTE was  shaking hands with Tom.    \"I can't understand it,\" Mr. Hosbrook said. \"To think of meeting  other people on this desolate island--this island of earthquakes.\"    \"Oh, please don't speak of earthquakes!\" cried Mrs. Nestor. \"We are  in mortal terror! There have been several since we landed in the  most terrible storm day before yesterday. Isn't it awful! It is a  regular earthquake island!\"    \"That's what I call it,\" spoke Tom, grimly.    The others of the larger party of refugees now came up. Besides Mr.  and Mrs. Nestor, and Mr. Hosbrook, there was Mr. and Mrs. Floyd  Anderson, friends of the millionaire; Mr. Ralph Parker, who was  spoken of as a scientist, Mr. Barcoe Jenks, who seemed an odd sort  of individual, always looking about suspiciously, Captain Mentor,  who had been in command of the yacht, and Jake Fordam, the mate of  the vessel.    \"And are these all who were saved?\" asked Tom, as he introduced his  two friends, and told briefly of their air voyage.    \"No,\" answered Mr. Hosbrook, \"two other boatloads, one containing  most of the crew, and the other containing some of my guests, got  away before our boat left. I trust they have been rescued, but we  have heard nothing about them. However, our own lives may not long  be safe, if these earthquakes continue.\"    \"But did I understand you to say, Mr. Swift, that you had food?\" he  went on. \"If you have, I will gladly pay you any price for some,  especially for these two ladies, who must be faint. I have lost all  my ready cash, but if we ever reach civilization, I will--\"    \"Don't speak of such a thing as pay,\" interrupted Mr. Fenwick. \"All  that we have we'll gladly share with you. Come over to our camp. We  have enough for all, and we can cook on our gasolene stove. Don't  speak of pay, I beg of you.\"    \"Ah--er, if Mr. Hosbrook has no money, perhaps I can offer an  equivalent,\" broke in the man who had been introduced as Barcoe  Jenks. \"I have--er--some securities--\" He stopped and looked about  indefinitely, as though he did not know exactly what to say, and he  was fumbling at a belt about his waist; a belt that might contain  treasure.    \"Don't speak of reimbursing us,\" went on Mr. Fenwick, with rather a  suspicious glance at Mr. Jenks. \"You are welcome to whatever we  have.\"    \"Bless my topknot; certainly, yes!\" joined in Mr. Damon, eagerly.    \"Well, I--er--I only spoke of it,\" said Mr. Jenks, hesitatingly, and  then he turned away. Mr. Hosbrook looked sharply at him, but said  nothing.    \"Suppose we go to our camp,\" proposed Tom. \"We may be able to get  you up a good meal, before another earthquake comes.\"    \"I wonder what makes so many of them?\" asked Mrs. Nestor, with a  nervous shiver.    \"Yes, indeed, they are terrifying! One never knows when to expect  them,\" added Mrs. Anderson.    \"I have a theory about them,\" said Mr. Parker, the scientist, who,  up to this time had spoken but little.    \"A theory?\" inquired Tom.    \"Yes. This island is one of the smaller of the West Indies group. It  is little known, and has seldom been visited, I believe. But I am  sure that what causes the earthquakes is that the whole island has  been undermined by the sea, and it is the wash of great submarine  waves and currents which cause the tremors.\"    \"Undermined by the sea?\" repeated Tom.    \"Yes. It is being slowly washed away.\"    \"Bless my soul! Washed away!\" gasped Mr. Damon.    \"And, in the course of a comparatively short time, it will sink,\"  went on the scientist, as cheerfully as though he was a professor  propounding some problem to his class.    \"Sink!\" ejaculated Mrs. Nestor. \"The whole island undermined! Oh,  what an alarming theory!\"    \"I wish I could hold to a different one, madam,\" was Mr. Parker's  answer, \"but I cannot. I think the island will sink after a few more  shocks.\"    \"Then what good will my--\" began Barcoe Jenks, but he stopped in  confusion, and again his hand went to his belt with a queer gesture.          CHAPTER XVII    A MIGHTY SHOCK      Tom Swift turned to gaze at Mr. Barcoe Jenks. That individual  certainly had a strange manner. Perhaps it might be caused by the  terror of the earthquakes, but the man seemed to be trying to hold  back some secret. He was constrained and ill at ease. He saw the  young inventor looking at him, and his hands, which had gone to his  belt, with a spasmodic motion, dropped to his side.    \"You don't really mean to say, Parker, that you think the whole  island is undermined, do you?\" asked the owner of the RESOLUTE.    \"That's my theory. It may be a wrong one, but it is borne out by the  facts already presented to us. I greatly fear for our lives!\"    \"But what can we do?\" cried Mrs. Nestor.    \"Nothing,\" answered the scientist, with a shrug of his shoulders.  \"Absolutely nothing, save to wait for it to happen.\"    \"Don't say that!\" begged Mrs. Andersen.    \"Can't you gentlemen do something--build a boat and take us away.  Why, the boat we came here in--\"    \"Struck a rock, and stove a hole in the bottom as big as a barrel,  madam,\" interrupted Captain Mentor. \"It would never do to put to sea  in that.\"    \"But can't something else be done?\" demanded Mrs. Nestor. \"Oh, it is  awful to think of perishing on this terrible earthquake island. Oh,  Amos! Think of it, and Mary home alone! Have you seen her lately,  Mr. Swift?\"    Tom told of his visit to the Nestors' home. Our hero was almost in  despair, not so much for himself, as for the unfortunate women of  the party--and one of them was Mary's mother! Yet what could he do?  What chance was there of escaping from the earthquake?    \"Bless my gizzard!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon. \"Don't let's stand here  worrying! If you folks are hungry come up to our camp. We have  plenty. Afterward we can discuss means of saving ourselves.\"    \"I want to be saved!\" exclaimed Mr. Jenks. \"I must be saved! I have  a great secret--a secret--\"    Once more he paused in confusion, and once more his hands nervously  sought his belt.    \"I would give a big reward to be saved,\" he murmured.    \"And so, I fancy, we all would,\" added Captain Mentor. \"But we are  not likely to. This island is out of the track of the regular line  of vessels.\"    \"Where are we, anyhow?\" inquired Mr. Fenwick. \"What island is this?\"    \"It isn't down on the charts, I believe,\" was the captain's reply,  \"but we won't be far out, if we call it Earthquake Island. That name  seems to fit it exactly.\"    They had walked on, while talking, and now had gone past the broken  cliff. Tom and his two friends of the airship led the way to the  camp they had made. On the way, Mr. Hosbrook related how his yacht  had struggled in vain against the tempest, how she had sprung a  leak, how the fires had gone out, and how, helpless in the trough of  the sea, the gallant vessel began to founder. Then they had taken to  the boats, and had, most unexpectedly come upon the island.    \"And since we landed we have had very little to eat,\" said Mrs.  Nestor. \"We haven't had a place to sleep, and it has been terrible.  Then, too, the earthquakes! And my husband and I worried so about  Mary. Oh, Mr. Swift! Do you think there is any chance of us ever  seeing her again?\"    \"I don't know,\" answered Tom, softly. \"I'll do all I can to get us  off this island. Perhaps we can build a raft, and set out. If we  stay here there is no telling what will happen, if that scientist's  theory is correct. But there is our camp, just ahead. You will be  more comfortable, at least for a little while.\"    In a short time they were at the place where Tom and the others had  built the shack. The ruins of the airship were examined with  interest, and the two women took advantage of the seclusion of the  little hut, to get some much needed rest until a meal should be  ready.    One was soon in course of preparation by Tom and Mr. Damon, aided by  Mate Fordam, of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4230"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Motor-Cycle; Or, Fun and Adventures on the Road (#16)"],[1,"house he saw in the road  ahead of him a rickety old wagon, and a second glance at it told him  the outfit belonged to Eradicate Sampson, for the animal drawing the  vehicle was none other than the mule, Boomerang.    \"But what in the world is Rad up to?\" mused Tom, for the colored man  was out of the wagon and was going up and down in the grass at the  side of the highway in a curious fashion. \"I guess he's lost  something,\" decided Tom.    When he got nearer he saw what Eradicate was doing. The colored man  was pushing a lawn-mower slowly to and fro in the tall, rank grass  that grew beside the thoroughfare, and at the sound of Tom's  motor-cycle the negro looked up. There was such a woe-begone  expression on his face that Tom at once stopped his machine and got  off.    \"What's the matter, Rad?\" Tom asked.    \"Mattah, Mistah Swift? Why, dere's a pow'ful lot de mattah, an'  dat's de truff. I'se been swindled, dat's what I has.\"    \"Swindled? How?\"    \"Well, it's dis-a-way. Yo' see dis yeah lawn-moah?\"    \"Yes; it doesn't seem to work,\" and Tom glanced critically at it. As  Eradicate pushed it slowly to and fro, the blades did not revolve,  and the wheels slipped along on the grass.    \"No, sah, it doan't work, an' dat's how I've been swindled, Mistah  Swift. Yo' see, I done traded mah ole grindstone off for dis yeah  lawn-moah, an' I got stuck.\"    \"What, that old grindstone that was broken in two, and that you  fastened together with concrete?\" asked Tom, for he had seen the  outfit with which Eradicate, in spare times between cleaning and  whitewashing, had gone about the country, sharpening knives and  scissors. \"You don't mean that old, broken one?\"    \"Dat's what I mean, Mistah Swift. Why, it was all right. I mended it  so dat de break wouldn't show, an' it would sharpen things if yo'  run it slow. But dis yeah lawn-moah won't wuk slow ner fast.\"    \"I guess it was an even exchange, then,\" went on Tom. \"You didn't  get bitten any worse than the other fellow did.\"    \"Yo' doan't s'pose yo' kin fix dis yeah moah so's I kin use it, does  yo', Mistah Swift?\" asked Eradicate, not bothering to go into the  ethics of the matter. \"I reckon now with summah comin' on I kin make  mo' with a lawn-moah than I kin with a grindstone--dat is, ef I kin  git it to wuk. I jest got it a while ago an' decided to try it, but  it won't cut no grass.\"    \"I haven't much time,\" said Tom, \"for I'm anxious to get home, but  I'll take a look at it.\"    Tom leaned his motor-cycle against the fence. He could no more pass  a bit of broken machinery, which he thought he could mend, than some  men and boys can pass by a baseball game without stopping to watch  it, no matter how pressed they are for time. It was Tom's hobby, and  he delighted in nothing so much as tinkering with machines, from  lawn-mowers to steam engines.    Tom took hold of the handle, which Eradicate gladly relinquished to  him, and his trained touch told him at once what was the trouble.    \"Some one has had the wheels off and put them on wrong, Rad,\" he  said. \"The ratchet and pawl are reversed. This mower would work  backwards, if that were possible.\"    \"Am dat so, Mistah Swift?\"    \"That's it. All I have to do is to take off the wheels and reverse  the pawl.\"    \"I--I didn't know mah lawn-moah was named Paul,\" said the colored  man. \"Is it writ on it anywhere?\"    \"No, it's not the kind of Paul you mean,\" said Tom with a laugh.  \"It's spelled differently. A pawl is a sort of catch that fits into  a ratchet wheel and pushes it around, or it may be used as a catch  to prevent the backward motion of a windlass or the wheel on a  derrick. I'll have it fixed in a jiffy for you.\"    Tom worked rapidly. With a monkey-wrench he removed the two big  wheels of the lawn-mower and reversed the pawl in the cogs. In five  minutes he had replaced the wheels, and the machine, except for  needed sharpening, did good work.    \"There you are, Rad!\" exclaimed Tom at length.    \"Yo' suah am a wonder at inventin'!\" cried the colored man  gratefully. \"I'll cut yo' grass all summah fo' yo' to pay fo' this,  Mistah Swift.\"    \"Oh, that's too much. I didn't do a great deal, Rad.\"    \"Well, yo' saved me from bein' swindled, Mistah Swift, an' I suah  does 'preciate dat.\"    \"How about the fellow you traded the cracked grindstone to, Rad?\"    \"Oh, well, ef he done run it slow it won't fly apart, an' he'll do  dat, anyhow, fo' he suah am a lazy coon. I guess we am about even  there, Mistah Swift.\"    \"All right,\" spoke Tom with a laugh. \"Sharpen it up, Rad, and start  in to cut grass. It will soon be summer,\" and Tom, leaping upon his  motor-cycle, was off like a shot.    He found his father in his library, reading a book on scientific  matters. Mr. Swift looked up in surprise at seeing his son.    \"What! Back so soon?\" he asked. \"You did make a flying trip. Did you  give the model and papers to Mr. Crawford?\"    \"No, dad, I was robbed yesterday. Those scoundrels got ahead of us,  after all. They have your model. I tried to telephone to you, but  the wires were down, or something.\"    \"What!\" cried Mr. Swift. \"Oh, Tom! That's too bad! I will lose ten  thousand dollars if I can't get that model and those papers back!\"  and with a despairing gesture Mr. Swift rose and began to pace the  floor.          CHAPTER XVIII.    HAPPY HARRY AGAIN      Tom watched his father anxiously. The young inventor knew the loss  had been a heavy one, and he blamed himself for not having been more  careful.    \"Tell me all about it, Tom,\" said Mr. Swift at length. \"Are you sure  the model and papers are gone? How did it happen?\"    Then Tom related what had befallen him.    \"Oh, that's too bad!\" cried Mr. Swift. \"Are you much hurt, Tom?  Shall I send for the doctor?\" For the time being his anxiety over  his son was greater than that concerning his loss.    \"No, indeed, dad. I'm all right now. I got a bad blow on the head,  but Mrs. Blackford fixed me up. I'm awfully sorry---\"    \"There, there! Now don't say another word,\" interrupted Mr. Swift.  \"It wasn't your fault. It might have happened to me. I dare say it  would, for those scoundrels seemed very determined. They are  desperate, and will stop at nothing to make good the loss they  sustained on the patent motor they exploited. Now they will probably  try to make use of my model and papers.\"    \"Do you think they'll do that, dad?\"    \"Yes. They will either make a motor exactly like mine, or construct  one so nearly similar that it will answer their purpose. I will have  no redress against them, as my patent is not fully granted yet. Mr.  Crawford was to attend to that.\"    \"Can't you do anything to stop them, dad? File an injunction, or  something like that?\"    \"I don't know. I must see Mr. Crawford at once. I wonder if he could  come here? He might be able to advise me. I have had very little  experience with legal difficulties. My specialty is in other lines  of work. But I must do something. Every moment is valuable. I wonder  who the men were?\"    \"I'm sure one of them was the same man who came here that night--the  man with the black mustache, who dropped the telegram,\" said Tom. \"I  had a pretty good look at him as the auto passed me, and I'm sure it  was he. Of course I didn't see who it was that struck me down, but I  imagine it was some one of the same gang.\"    \"Very likely. Well, Tom, I must do something. I suppose I might  telegraph to Mr. Crawford--he will be expecting you in Albany--\" Mr.  Swift paused musingly. \"No, I have it!\" he suddenly exclaimed. \"I'll  go to Albany myself.\"    \"Go to Albany, dad?\"    \"Yes; I must explain everything to the lawyers and then he can  advise me what to do. Fortunately I have some papers, duplicates of  those you took, which I can show him. Of course the originals will  be necessary before I can prove my claim. The loss of the model is  the most severe, however. Without that I can do little. But I will  have Mr. Crawford take whatever steps are possible. I'll take the  night train, Tom. I'll have to leave you to look after matters here,  and I needn't caution you to be on your guard, though, having got  what they were after, I fancy those financiers, or their tools, will  not bother us again.\"    \"Very likely not,\" agreed Tom, \"but I will keep my eyes open, just  the same. Oh, but that reminds me, dad. Did you see anything of a  tramp around here while I was away?\"    \"A tramp? No; but you had better ask Mrs. Baggert. She usually  attends to them. She's so kind-hearted that she frequently gives  them a good meal.\"    The housekeeper, when consulted, said that no tramps had applied in  the last few days.    \"Why do you ask, Tom?\" inquired his father.    \"Because I had an experience with one, and I believe he was a member  of the same gang who robbed me.\" And thereupon Tom told of his  encounter with Happy Harry, and how the latter had broken the wire  on the motor-cycle.    \"You had a narrow escape,\" commented Mr. Swift. \"If I had known the  dangers involved I would never have allowed you to take the model to  Albany.\"    \"Well, I didn't take it there, after all,\" said Tom with a grim  smile, for he could appreciate a joke.    \"I must hurry and pack my valise,\" went on Mr. Swift. \"Mrs. Baggert,  we will have an early supper, and I will start at once for Albany.\"    \"I wish I could go with you, dad, to make up for the trouble I  caused,\" spoke Tom.    \"Tut, tut! Don't talk that way,\" advised his father kindly. \"I will  be glad of the trip. It will ease my mind to be doing something.\"    Tom felt rather lonesome after his father had left, but he laid out  a plan of action for himself that he thought would keep him occupied  until his father returned. In the first place he made a tour of the  house and various machine shops to see that doors and windows were  securely fastened.    \"What's the matter? Do you expect burglars, Master Tom?\" asked  Garret Jackson, the aged engineer.    \"Well, Garret, you never can"]]]
