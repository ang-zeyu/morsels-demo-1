'What makes Laputa come up  here to start with?  Why doesn't he begin with Zululand?'    'God knows!  There's sure to be sense in it, for he does nothing  without reason.  We may know to-morrow.'    But as Captain Arcoll spoke, the real reason suddenly flashed into my  mind: Laputa had to get the Great Snake, the necklet of Prester John,  to give his leadership prestige.  Apparently he had not yet got it, or  Arcoll would have known.  He started from this neighbourhood because  the fetich was somewhere hereabouts.  I was convinced that my guess was  right, but I kept my own counsel.    'To-morrow Laputa and Henriques meet at Umvelos', probably at your new  store, Mr Crawfurd.  And so the ball commences.'    My resolution was suddenly taken.    'I think,' I said, 'I had better be present at the meeting, as  representing the firm.'    Captain Arcoll stared at me and laughed.  'I had thought of going  myself,' he said.    'Then you go to certain death, disguise yourself as you please.  You  cannot meet them in the store as I can.  I'm there on my ordinary  business, and they will never suspect.  If you're to get any news, I'm  the man to go.'    He looked at me steadily for a minute or so.  'I'm not sure that's such  a bad idea of yours.  I would be better employed myself on the Berg,  and, as you say, I would have little chance of hearing anything.  You're a plucky fellow, Mr Crawfurd.  I suppose you understand that the  risk is pretty considerable.'    'I suppose I do; but since I'm in this thing, I may as well see it out.  Besides, I've an old quarrel with our friend Laputa.'    'Good and well,' said Captain Arcoll.  'Draw in your chair to the  table, then, and I'll explain to you the disposition of my men.  I  should tell you that I have loyal natives in my pay in most tribes, and  can count on early intelligence.  We can't match their telepathy; but  the new type of field telegraph is not so bad, and may be a trifle more  reliable.'    Till midnight we pored over maps, and certain details were burned in on  my memory.  Then we went to bed and slept soundly, even Mr Wardlaw.  It  was strange how fear had gone from the establishment, now that we knew  the worst and had a fighting man by our side.      [1] Hemp.    [2] Council.    [3] Lesser chiefs.        CHAPTER VIII    I FALL IN AGAIN WITH THE REVEREND JOHN LAPUTA    Once, as a boy, I had earnestly desired to go into the army, and had  hopes of rising to be a great general.  Now that I know myself better,  I do not think I would have been much good at a general's work.  I  would have shirked the loneliness of it, the isolation of  responsibility.  But I think I would have done well in a subaltern  command, for I had a great notion of carrying out orders, and a certain  zest in the mere act of obedience. Three days before I had been as  nervous as a kitten because I was alone and it was 'up to me,' as  Americans say, to decide on the next step.  But now that I was only one  wheel in a great machine of defence my nervousness seemed to have fled.  I was well aware that the mission I was bound on was full of risk; but,  to my surprise, I felt no fear.  Indeed, I had much the same feeling as  a boy on a Saturday's holiday who has planned a big expedition.  One  thing only I regretted--that Tam Dyke was not with me to see the fun.  The thought of that faithful soul, now beating somewhere on the seas,  made me long for his comradeship.  As I shaved, I remember wondering if  I would ever shave again, and the thought gave me no tremors. For once  in my sober life I was strung up to the gambler's pitch of adventure.    My job was to go to Umvelos' as if on my ordinary business, and if  possible find out something of the evening's plan of march.  The  question was how to send back a message to Arcoll, assuming I had any  difficulty in getting away.  At first this puzzled us both, and then I  thought of Colin.  I had trained the dog to go home at my bidding, for  often when I used to go hunting I would have occasion to visit a kraal  where he would have been a nuisance.  Accordingly, I resolved to take  Colin with me, and, if I got into trouble, to send word by him.    I asked about Laputa's knowledge of our preparations. Arcoll was  inclined to think that he suspected little.  The police and the  commandos had been kept very secret, and, besides, they were moving on  the high veld and out of the ken of the tribes.  Natives, he told me,  were not good scouts so far as white man's work was concerned, for they  did not understand the meaning of what we did.  On the other hand, his  own native scouts brought him pretty accurate tidings of any Kaffir  movements.  He thought that all the bush country of the plain would be  closely watched, and that no one would get through without some kind of  pass.  But he thought also that the storekeeper might be an exception,  for his presence would give rise to no suspicions.  Almost his last  words to me were to come back hell-for-leather if I saw the game was  hopeless, and in any case to leave as soon as I got any news.  'If  you're there when the march begins,' he said, 'they'll cut your throat  for a certainty.'  I had all the various police posts on the Berg clear  in my mind, so that I would know where to make for if the road to  Blaauwildebeestefontein should be closed.    I said good-bye to Arcoll and Wardlaw with a light heart, though the  schoolmaster broke down and implored me to think better of it.  As I  turned down into the gorge I heard the sound of horses' feet far  behind, and, turning back, saw white riders dismounting at the dorp.  At any rate I was leaving the country well guarded in my rear.    It was a fine morning in mid-winter, and I was in very good spirits as  I jogged on my pony down the steep hill-road, with Colin running beside  me.  A month before I had taken the same journey, with no suspicion in  my head of what the future was to bring.  I thought about my Dutch  companions, now with their cattle far out on the plains.  Did they know  of the great danger, I wondered.  All the way down the glen I saw no  sign of human presence.  The game-birds mocked me from the thicket; a  brace of white _berghaan_ circled far up in the blue; and I had for  pleasant comrade the brawling river.  I dismounted once to drink, and  in that green haven of flowers and ferns I was struck sharply with a  sense of folly.  Here were we wretched creatures of men making for each  other's throats, and outraging the good earth which God had made so  fair a habitation.    I had resolved on a short cut to Umvelos', avoiding the neighbourhood  of Sikitola's kraal, so when the river emerged from the glen I crossed  it and struck into the bush.  I had not gone far before I realized that  something strange was going on. It was like the woods on the Berg a  week before.  I had the impression of many people moving in the bush,  and now and then I caught a glimpse of them.  My first thought was that  I should be stopped, but soon it appeared that these folk had business  of their own which did not concern me.  I was conscious of being  watched, yet it was clear that the bush folk were not there for the  purpose of watching me.    For a little I kept my spirits, but as the hours passed with the same  uncanny hurrying to and fro all about me my nerves began to suffer.  Weeks of espionage at Blaauwildebeestefontein had made me jumpy.  These  people apparently meant me no ill, and had no time to spare on me, But  the sensation of moving through them was like walking on a black-dark  night with precipices all around.  I felt odd quiverings between my  shoulder blades where a spear might be expected to lodge. Overhead was  a great blue sky and a blazing sun, and I could see the path running  clear before me between the walls of scrub.  But it was like midnight  to me, a midnight of suspicion and unknown perils.  I began to wish  heartily I had never come.    I stopped for my midday meal at a place called Taqui, a grassy glade in  the bush where a tiny spring of water crept out from below a big stone,  only to disappear in the sand.  Here I sat and smoked for half an hour,  wondering what was going to become of me.  The air was very still, but  I could hear the rustle of movement somewhere within a hundred yards.  The hidden folk were busy about their own ends, and I regretted that I  had not taken the road by Sikitola's and seen how the kraals looked.  They must be empty now, for the young men were already out on some  mission.  So nervous I got that I took my pocket-book and wrote down  certain messages to my mother, which I implored whoever should find my  body to transmit.  Then, a little ashamed of my childishness, I pulled  myself together, and remounted.    About three in the afternoon I came over a low ridge of bush and saw  the corrugated iron roof of the store and the gleam of water from the  Labongo.  The sight encouraged me, for at any rate it meant the end of  this disquieting ride.  Here the bush changed to trees of some size,  and after leaving the ridge the road plunged for a little into a thick  shade.  I had forgotten for a moment the folk in the bush, and when a  man stepped out of the thicket I pulled up my horse with a start.    It was a tall native, who carried himself proudly, and after a glance  at me, stalked along at my side.  He wore curious clothes, for he had a  kind of linen tunic, and around his waist hung a kilt of leopard-skin.  In such a man one would have looked for a _ting-kop_,[1] but instead he  had a mass of hair, not like a Kaffir's wool, but long and curled like  some popular musician's.  I should have been prepared for the face, but  the sight of it sent a sudden chill of fright through my veins.

If that's the case I will pay the money for it.\"    \"Oh, fie,\" sais I, \"Miss Jessie.\"    \"Well, I want to know!\"    \"No, indeed; what I meant was to give you that book to remember me by  when I am far away from here, and I wanted you to give me a little  token, O do bhilean boidheach (from your pretty lips), that I should  remember the longest day I live.\"    \"You mean that you would go away, laugh, and forget right off. No,  that won't do, but if you must have a token I will look up some little  keepsake to exchange for it. Oh, dear, what a horrid idea,\" she said,  quite scorney like, \"to trade for a kiss; it's the way father buys his  fish, he gives salt for them, or flour, or some such barter, oh, Mr  Slick, I don't think much of you. But for goodness gracious sake how  did you learn Gaelic?\"    \"From lips, dear,\" said I, \"and that's the reason I shall never forget  it.\"    \"No, no,\" said she, \"but how on earth did you ever pick it up.\"    \"I didn't pick it up, Miss,\" said I, \"I kissed it up, and as you want  a story I might as well tell you that as any other.\"    \"It depends upon what sort of a story it is,\" said she, colouring.    \"Oh, yes,\" said the Campbell girls, who didn't appear quite so  skittish as she was, \"do tell us, no doubt you will make a funny one  out of it. Come, begin.\"    Squire, you are older than I be, and I suppose you will think all this  sort of thing is clear sheer nonsense, but depend upon it a kiss is a  great mystery. There is many a thing we know that we can't explain,  still we are sure it is a fact for all that. Why should there be a  sort of magic in shaking hands, which seems only a mere form, and  sometimes a painful one too, for some folks wring your fingers off  amost, and make you fairly dance with pain, they hurt you so. It don't  give much pleasure at any time. What the magic of it is we can't tell,  but so it is for all that. It seems only a custom like bowing and  nothing else, still there is more in it than meets the eye. But a kiss  fairly electrifies you, it warms your blood and sets your heart a  beatin' like a brass drum, and makes your eyes twinkle like stars in a  frosty night. It tante a thing ever to be forgot. No language can  express it, no letters will give the sound. Then what in natur is  equal to the flavour of it? What an aroma it has! How spiritual it is!  It ain't gross, for you can't feed on it; it don't cloy, for the  palate ain't required to test its taste. It is neither visible, nor  tangible, nor portable, nor transferable. It is not a substance, nor a  liquid, nor a vapour. It has neither colour nor form. Imagination  can't conceive it. It can't be imitated or forged. It is confined to  no clime or country, but is ubiquitous. It is disembodied when  completed, but is instantly reproduced, and so is immortal. It is as  old as the creation, and yet is as young and fresh as ever. It  preëxisted, still exists, and always will exist. It pervades all  natur. The breeze as it passes kisses the rose, and the pendant vine  stoops down and hides with its tendrils its blushes, as it kisses the  limpid stream that waits in an eddy to meet it, and raises its tiny  waves, like anxious lips to receive it. Depend upon it Eve learned it  in Paradise, and was taught its beauties, virtues, and varieties by an  angel, there is something so transcendent in it.    How it is adapted to all circumstances! There is the kiss of welcome  and of parting, the long-lingering, loving present one, the stolen or  the mutual one, the kiss of love, of joy, and of sorrow, the seal of  promise, and the receipt of fulfilment. Is it strange therefore that a  woman is invincible whose armoury consists of kisses, smiles, sighs,  and tears? Is it any wonder that poor old Adam was first tempted, and  then ruined? It is very easy for preachers to get up with long faces  and tell us he ought to have been more of a man. My opinion is, if he  had been less of a man, it would have been better for him. But I am  not agoin' to preach; so I will get back to my story; but, Squire, I  shall always maintain to my dying day, that kissing is a sublime  mystery.    \"Well,\" sais I, \"ladies, I was broughten up to home, on my father's  farm, and my edecation, what little I had of it, I got from the  Minister of Slickville, Mr Joshua Hopewell, who was a friend of my  father's, and was one of the best men I believe that ever lived. He  was all kindness and all gentleness, and was at the same time one of  the most learned men in the United States. He took a great fancy to  me, and spared no pains with my schooling, and I owe everything I have  in the world to his instruction. I didn't mix much with other boys,  and, from living mostly with people older than myself, acquired an  old-fashioned way that I have never been able to shake off yet; all  the boys called me 'Old Slick.' In course, I didn't learn much of life  that way. All I knew about the world beyond our house and hisin, was  from books, and from hearing him talk, and he convarsed better than  any book I ever set eyes on. Well, in course I grew up unsophisticated  like, and I think I may say I was as innocent a young man as ever you  see.\"    Oh, how they all laughed at that! \"You ever innocent!\" said they.  \"Come, that's good; we like that; it's capital! Sam Slick an innocent  boy! Well, that must have been before you were weaned, or talked in  joining hand, at any rate. How simple we are, ain't we?\" and they  laughed themselves into a hooping-cough amost.    \"Fact, Miss Janet,\" said I, \"I assure you\" (for she seemed the most  tickled at the idea of any of them) \"I was, indeed. I won't go for to  pretend to say some of it didn't rub off when it became dry, when I  was fishing in the world on my own hook; but, at the time I am  speaking of, when I was twenty-one next grass, I was so guileless, I  couldn't see no harm in anything.\"    \"So I should think,\" said she; \"it's so like you.\"    \"Well, at that time there was a fever, a most horrid typhus fever,  broke out in Slickville, brought there by some shipwrecked emigrants.  There was a Highland family settled in the town the year afore,  consisting of old Mr Duncan Chisholm, his wife, and daughter Flora.  The old people were carried off by the disease, and Flora was left  without friends or means, and the worst of it was, she could hardly  speak a word of intelligible English. Well, Minister took great pity  on her, and spoke to father about taking her into his house, as sister  Sally was just married, and the old lady left without any companion;  and they agreed to take her as one of them, and she was in return to  help mother all she could. So, next day, she came, and took up her  quarters with us. Oh my, Miss Janet, what a beautiful girl she was!  She was as tall as you are, Jessie, and had the same delicate little  feet and hands.\"    I threw that in on purpose, for women, in a general way, don't like to  hear others spoken of too extravagant, particularly if you praise them  for anything they hain't got; but if you praise them for anything they  pride themselves on, they are satisfied, because it shows you estimate  them also at the right valy, too. It took, for she pushed her foot out  a little, and rocked it up and down slowly, as if she was rather proud  of it.    \"Her hair was a rich auburn, not red (I don't like that at all, for it  is like a lucifer-match, apt to go off into a flame spontinaciously  sometimes), but a golden colour, and lots of it too, just about as  much as she could cleverly manage; eyes like diamonds; complexion, red  and white roses; and teeth, not quite so regular as yours, Miss, but  as white as them; and lips--lick!--they reminded one of a curl of rich  rose-leaves, when the bud first begins to swell and spread out with a  sort of peachy bloom on them, ripe, rich, and chock full of kisses.\"    \"Oh, the poor ignorant boy!\" said Janet, \"you didn't know nothing, did  you?\"    \"Well, I didn't,\" sais I, \"I was as innocent as a child; but nobody is  so ignorant as not to know a splendiferous gall when he sees her,\" and  I made a motion of my head to her, as much, as to say, \"Put that cap  on, for it just fits you.\"    \"My sakes, what a neck she had! not too long and thin, for that looks  goosey; nor too short and thick, for that gives a clumsy appearance to  the figure; but betwixt and between, and perfection always lies there,  just midway between extremes. But her bust--oh! the like never was  seen in Slickville, for the ladies there, in a gineral way, have no--\"    \"Well, well,\" said Jessie, a little snappish, for praisin' one gall to  another ain't the shortest way to win their regard, \"go on with your  story of Gaelic.\"    \"And her waist, Jessie, was the most beautiful thing, next to your'n,  I ever see. It was as round as an apple, and anything that is round,  you know, is larger than it looks, and I wondered how much it would  measure. I never see such an innocent girl as she was. Brought up to  home, and in the country, like me, she knew no more about the ways of  the world than I did. She was a mere child, as I was; she was only  nineteen years old, and neither of us knew anything of society rules.  One day I asked her to let me measure her waist with my arm, and I  did, and then she measured mine with her'n, and we had a great dispute  which was the largest, and we tried several times before we  ascertained there was only an inch difference between us. I never was  so glad in my life as when she came to stay with us; she was so  good-natured, and so cheerful, and so innocent, it was quite charming.    \"Father took a wonderful shindy to her, for "]]]
