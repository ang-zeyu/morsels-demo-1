The door opened, and the man-beast stood  looking down on them, a grin on his red face. Instantly Baree showed  that he was alive. He sprang back from under the Willow's hand with a  sudden snarl and faced McTaggart. The hair of his spine stood up like a  brush; his fangs gleamed menacingly, and his eyes burned like living  coals.    \"There is a devil in him,\" said McTaggart. \"He is wild--born of the  wolf. You must be careful or he will take off a hand, kit sakahet.\" It  was the first time he had called her that lover's name in  Cree--SWEETHEART! Her heart pounded. She bent her head for a moment  over her clenched hands, and McTaggart--looking down on what he thought  was her confusion--laid his hand caressingly on her hair. From the door  Pierrot had heard the word, and now he saw the caress, and he raised a  hand as if to shut out the sight of a sacrilege.    \"Mon Dieu!\" he breathed.    In the next instant he had given a sharp cry of wonder that mingled  with a sudden yell of pain from McTaggart. Like a flash Baree had  darted across the floor and fastened his teeth in the factor's leg.  They had bitten deep before McTaggart freed himself with a powerful  kick. With an oath he snatched his revolver from its holster. The  Willow was ahead of him. With a little cry she darted to Baree and  caught him in her arms. As she looked up at McTaggart, her soft, bare  throat was within a few inches of Baree's naked fangs. Her eyes blazed.    \"You beat him!\" she cried. \"He hates you--hates you--\"    \"Let him go!\" called Pierrot in an agony of fear.    \"Mon Dieu! I say let him go, or he will tear the life from you!\"    \"He hates you--hates you--hates you--\" the Willow was repeating over  and over again into McTaggart's startled face. Then suddenly she turned  to her father. \"No, he will not tear the life from me,\" she cried.  \"See! It is Baree. Did I not tell you that? It is Baree! Is it not  proof that he defended me--\"    \"From me!\" gasped McTaggart, his face darkening.    Pierrot advanced and laid a hand on McTaggart's arm. He was smiling.    \"Let us leave them to fight it out between themselves, m'sieu,\" he  said. \"They are two little firebrands, and we are not safe. If she is  bitten--\"    He shrugged his shoulders. A great load had been lifted from them  suddenly. His voice was soft and persuasive. And now the anger had gone  out of the Willow's face. A coquettish uplift of her eyes caught  McTaggart, and she looked straight at him half smiling, as she spoke to  her father:    \"I will join you soon, mon pere--you and M'sieu the Factor from Lac  Bain!\"    There were undeniable little devils in her eyes, McTaggart  thought--little devils laughing full at him as she spoke, setting his  brain afire and his blood to throbbing wildly. Those eyes--full of  dancing witches! How he would take pleasure in taming them--very soon  now! He followed Pierrot outside. In his exultation he no longer felt  the smart of Baree's teeth.    \"I will show you my new cariole that I have made for winter, m'sieu,\"  said Pierrot as the door closed behind them.      Half an hour later Nepeese came out of the cabin. She could see that  Pierrot and the factor had been talking about something that had not  been pleasant to her father. His face was strained. She caught in his  eyes the smolder of fire which he was trying to smother, as one might  smother flames under a blanket. McTaggart's jaws were set, but his eyes  lighted up with pleasure when he saw her. She knew what it was about.  The factor from Lac Bain had been demanding his answer of Pierrot, and  Pierrot had been telling him what she had insisted upon--that he must  come to her. And he was coming! She turned with a quick beating of the  heart and hurried down a little path. She heard McTaggart's footsteps  behind her, and threw the flash of a smile over her shoulder. But her  teeth were set tight. The nails of her fingers were cutting into the  palms of her hands.    Pierrot stood without moving. He watched them as they disappeared into  the edge of the forest, Nepeese still a few steps ahead of McTaggart.  Out of his breast rose a sharp breath.    \"Par les milles cornes du diable!\" he swore softly. \"Is it  possible--that she smiles from her heart at that beast? Non! It is  impossible. And yet--if it is so--\"    One of his brown hands tightened convulsively about the handle of the  knife in his belt, and slowly he began to follow them.    McTaggart did not hurry to overtake Nepeese. She was following the  narrow path deeper into the forest, and he was glad of that. They would  be alone--away from Pierrot. He was ten steps behind her, and again the  Willow smiled at him over her shoulder. Her body moved sinuously and  swiftly. She was keeping accurate measurement of the distance between  them--but McTaggart did not guess that this was why she looked back  every now and then. He was satisfied to let her go on. When she turned  from the narrow trail into a side path that scarcely bore the mark of  travel, his heart gave an exultant jump. If she kept on, he would very  soon have her alone--a good distance from the cabin. The blood ran hot  in his face. He did not speak to her, through fear that she would stop.  Ahead of them he heard the rumble of water. It was the creek running  through the chasm.    Nepeese was making straight for that sound. With a little laugh she  started to run, and when she stood at the edge of the chasm, McTaggart  was fully fifty yards behind her. Twenty feet sheer down there was a  deep pool between the rock walls, a pool so deep that the water was the  color of blue ink. She turned to face the factor from Lac Bain. He had  never looked more like a red beast to her. Until this moment she had  been unafraid. But now--in an instant--he terrified her. Before she  could speak what she had planned to say, he was at her side, and had  taken her face between his two great hands, his coarse fingers twining  in the silken strands of her thick braids where they fell over her  shoulders at the neck.    \"Ka sakahet!\" he cried passionately. \"Pierrot said you would have an  answer for me. But I need no answer now. You are mine! Mine!\"    She gave a cry. It was a gasping, broken cry. His arms were about her  like bands of iron, crushing her slender body, shutting off her breath,  turning the world almost black before her eyes. She could neither  struggle nor cry out. She felt the hot passion of his lips on her face,  heard his voice--and then came a moment's freedom, and air into her  strangled lungs. Pierrot was calling! He had come to the fork in the  trail, and he was calling the Willow's name!    McTaggart's hot hand came over her mouth.    \"Don't answer,\" she heard him say.    Strength--anger--hatred flared up in her, and fiercely she struck the  hand down. Something in her wonderful eyes held McTaggart. They blazed  into his very soul.    \"Bete noir!\" she panted at him, freeing herself from the last touch of  his hands. \"Beast--black beast!\" Her voice trembled, and her face  flamed. \"See--I came to show you my pool--and tell you what you wanted  to hear--and you--you--have crushed me like a beast--like a great  rock-- See! down there--it is my pool!\"    She had not planned it like this. She had intended to be smiling, even  laughing, in this moment. But McTaggart had spoiled them--her carefully  made plans! And yet, as she pointed, the factor from Lac Bain looked  for an instant over the edge of the chasm. And then she  laughed--laughed as she gave him a sudden shove from behind.    \"And that is my answer, M'sieu le Facteur from Lac Bain!\" she cried  tauntingly as he plunged headlong into the deep pool between the rock  walls.        CHAPTER 14    From the edge of the open Pierrot saw what had happened, and he gave a  great gasp of horror. He drew back among the balsams. This was not a  moment for him to show himself. While his heart drummed like a hammer,  his face was filled with joy.    On her hands and knees the Willow was peering over the edge. Bush  McTaggart had disappeared. He had gone down like the great clod he was.  The water of her pool had closed over him with a dull splash that was  like a chuckle of triumph. He appeared now, beating out with his arms  and legs to keep himself afloat, while the Willow's voice came to him  in taunting cries.    \"Bete noir! Bete noir! Beast! Beast--\"    Savagely she flung small sticks and tufts of earth down at him; and  McTaggart, looking up as he gained his equilibrium, saw her leaning so  far over that she seemed almost about to fall. Her long braids hung  down into the chasm, gleaming in the sun. Her eyes were laughing while  her lips taunted him. He could see the flash of her white teeth.    \"Beast! Beast!\"    He began swimming, still looking up at her. It was a hundred yards down  the slow-going current to the beach of shale where he could climb out,  and a half of that distance she followed him, laughing and taunting  him, and flinging down sticks and pebbles. He noted that none of the  sticks or stones was large enough to hurt him. When at last his feet  touched bottom, she was gone.    Swiftly Nepeese ran back over the trail, and almost into Pierrot's  arms. She was panting and laughing when for a moment she stopped.    \"I have given him the answer, Nootawe! He is in the pool!\"    Into the balsams she disappeared like a bird. Pierrot made no effort to  stop her or to follow.    \"Tonnerre de Dieu,\" he chuckled--and cut straight across for the other  trail.      Nepeese was out of breath when she reached the cabin. Baree, fastened  to a table leg by a babiche thong, heard her pause for a moment at the  door. Then she entered and came straight to him. During the half-hour  of her absence Baree had scarcely moved. That half-hour, and the few  minutes that had preceded it, had made tremendous impressions upon him.

Kimball's Journal (#16)"],[1,"PLACE--MY  RECOMMEND--STRUGGLE WITH EVIL SPIRITS--JOSEPH SMITH'S EXPERIENCE  WITH EVIL SPIRITS--P. P. PRATT'S ESCAPE FROM PRISON--BUILDING  HOUSES--PROSTRATED WITH SICKNESS--REMARKABLE MANIFESTATION OF THE GIFT  OF HEALING.    On the 3rd of May, 1839, in company with Elders Brigham Young, O.  Pratt, John Taylor, W. Woodruff and George A. Smith, I rode four miles  to Mr. Cleaveland's, to visit Joseph and Hyrum, who were as glad to see  us as we were to see them once more enjoying their liberty. I spent the  day with them and it was one of the greatest days of rejoicing in my  life to once more have the privilege of conversing with the Prophet in  freedom.    The next day I attended a general conference of the Church near Quincy,  at which the Saints from all the regions round about assembled. It was  a time which will long be remembered by the Saints, being the first  conference held after their expulsion.    The cases of Brothers William Smith and Orson Hyde were brought up. I  had previously informed Brother Hyrum Smith of Orson Hyde's feelings  of repentance, and desire to return to the Church. Hyrum partook of  the spirit, and when Joseph presented the name of Orson Hyde before  the Church, Hyrum and I plead for him according to the spirit that was  in us. Joseph then remarked, \"If my brother Hyrum and Heber C. Kimball  will defend Orson Hyde, I will withdraw my motion.\"    The conference granted them the privilege of appearing personally  before the next conference of the Church, to give an account of their  conduct, but required that in the meantime they both be suspended from  executing the functions of their office.    The conference sanctioned the proceeding of the Twelve on the temple  block at Far West, on the 26th of April, and also the intended mission  of the Twelve to Europe.    The conference continued for three days, and a most agreeable time was  enjoyed. Elder Rigdon was appointed delegate to go to Washington and  lay the grievances of the Saints before the general government, and it  was also resolved that a number of Elders should accompany the Twelve  on their mission to Europe.    On Sunday, the 12th of May, I went up to Commerce, in company with some  of the Twelve, in a wagon.    On the 25th I crossed the river with several of my brethren and  spent the day in council with Joseph and others. While crossing the  Mississippi, I was standing by the railing of the boat, looking at the  beautiful site of Nauvoo, and remarked, \"It is a very pretty place, but  not a long abiding place for the Saints.\"    These remarks reached the ears of Elder Rigdon and family, and caused  them to feel somewhat sad, as they were well situated in a nice stone  house. When we met in council, in the house of Joseph Smith, Elder  Rigdon said he had some feelings toward Elder Kimball, and added, \"I  should suppose that Elder Kimball had passed through sufferings and  privations and mobbings and drivings enough to learn to prophesy good  concerning Israel.\"    I saw that I was likely to receive quite a chastisement from Elder  Rigdon, and knowing his peculiar temperament, I arose and said,  \"President Rigdon, I'll prophesy good concerning you all the time if  you can get it!\"    On hearing that, Joseph had a hearty laugh with the brethren, and Elder  Rigdon yielded the point.    I here insert a recommend from the Presidency:    \"_To the Saints Scattered Abroad, to the Nations of Europe and to the  World_:    \"Be it known unto you that Heber C. Kimball is fully authorized to  preach the gospel of Jesus Christ, and his testimony can be relied on.  He is a man of unexceptionable character, and received his authority  and Priesthood from under the hands of the presiding authorities of the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, who were called by actual  revelation from God. Therefore, God will bless him, and bear record by  His power, thereby confirming his word and ministry. Thus testifieth  your humble servants,    \"SIDNEY RIGDON,    \"HYRUM SMITH,    \"JOSEPH SMITH, JR.    \"QUINCY, ILL., June 3, 1839.\"    I wrote to P. P. Pratt, giving him the particulars of our conference  at Far West on the 26th of April, and the resolution that the Twelve  should have their shackles taken off, that they might go forth into  the world to preach the gospel, and that the Bishops were to provide  for our families, etc. I also added, \"The Presidency feel well towards  you. They say you must come out of that place, and so I say; for I do  not feel as though I can go to England until I take you by the hand.  When this takes place my joy will be full. Be of good cheer, brother; a  few days now, and you shall see the salvation of God; and I shall see  you in other lands, publishing peace to the captives. My determination  is to be a man of God, and to try to save souls from their sins, let  others do as they may. I will try to keep my eye on the mark, that is,  Christ, the Son of the living God, His grace assisting me. The Twelve  have all left Quincy. Orson is about twenty-five miles from here.  Whatever you do, do quickly!\"    Joseph advised those of the Twelve whose families were not at Commerce  to remove them immediately to the new gathering place. I accordingly  went to Quincy and removed my family up to a place belonging to Brother  Bozier, about one mile from Commerce, where I pulled down an old stable  and laid up the logs at the back end of the Bozier house, putting a  few shakes on to cover it; but it had no floor or chinking. In this  condition I moved my family into it. Whenever it rained the water  stood nearly ankle deep on the ground in the house. There were some  half-a-dozen families in the Bozier house.    The 25th, 26th and 27th of June I spent in council with the Presidency  and Twelve, and received much valuable instruction from the Prophet. At  this conference Orson Hyde appeared, made a humble confession, and was  restored to the Priesthood.    One night I was awakened out of my sleep by my wife making a noise as  though she was nearly choking to death. I inquired the cause, and she  replied that she had dreamed that a personage came and seized her by  the throat and was choking her. I immediately lit a candle and saw that  her eyes were sunken and her nose pinched in as though she was in the  last stage of the cholera. I laid hands upon her and rebuked the evil  spirit in the name of Jesus, and by the power of the holy Priesthood  commanded it to depart. In a moment afterwards I heard some half a  dozen children in different parts of the Bozier house crying as if in  great distress. The cattle also began to bellow, the horses neighed,  the dogs barked, the hogs squealed, the hens cackled and roosters  crowed, and everything around seemed in great commotion. In a few  minutes afterwards I was sent for to lay hands upon Sister Patten, the  widow of David W. Patten, who was living in the room adjoining mine,  and who was seized in a similar manner to my wife.    My wife continued quite feeble for several days from the shock.    One day while visiting Joseph, he took me for a walk by the river side,  when he requested me to relate the occurrence at Brother Bozier's.  After I had done so, I also told him the vision of evil spirits in  England, on the opening of the gospel to that people. After I had done  this, I asked him what all these things meant, and whether or not there  was anything wrong in me. He said:    \"No, Brother Heber; at that time, when you were in England, you were  nigh unto the Lord, there was only a veil between you and Him, but you  could not see Him. When I heard of it, it gave me great joy; for I then  knew that the work of God had taken root in that land. It was this that  caused the devil to make a struggle to kill you.\"    Joseph then said the nearer a person approached to the Lord,  the greater power would be manifest by the devil to prevent the  accomplishment of the purposes of God.    He also gave me a relation of many contests that he had had with Satan,  and his power that had been manifested from time to time since the  commencement of bringing forth the Book of Mormon.    I will relate one circumstance that took place in Far West, in a house  which Joseph had purchased, which had been formerly occupied as a  public house by some wicked people. A short time after he had moved  into it, one of the children was taken very sick. He laid his hands  upon the child, when it got better. As soon as he went outside, the  child was taken sick again. He again laid his hands upon it, so that  it again recovered. This transpired several times, and Joseph inquired  of the Lord what it all meant, when he had an open vision, and saw  the devil in person, who contended with Joseph face to face for some  time. He said it was his house, it belonged to him, and Joseph had no  right there. Then Joseph rebuked Satan in the name of the Lord, and he  departed and troubled the child no more.    On the 2nd of July, I went with Joseph, Hyrum, Sidney and others over  the river to Montrose, after which we rode four miles and looked at  the site for the town of Zarahemla. We dined at Brother Woodruff's.  After dinner we all went to President Brigham Young's, where Brothers  Woodruff and George A. Smith were blessed as two of the Twelve  Apostles. Brother Hyrum Smith gave the Twelve some good advice on  the nature of their mission--to practice prudence and humility in  their preaching, and to strictly hold on to the authority of the  Priesthood. Brother Joseph taught many glorious things and important  principles to benefit and bless them on their mission; advising them to  observe charity, wisdom and a fellow feeling for each other under all  circumstances. He also unfolded the keys of knowledge, to detect Satan,  and preserve us in the favor of God.    On Sunday, the 7th of July, I was present at a large meeting of the  Saints in the open air to listen to the farewell addresses of the  Twelve. Many"]]]
