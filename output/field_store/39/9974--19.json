I flatter myself that, if they had once been set upon wholesale  plundering, they would have done it as thoroughly as their betters; but  I have always been infinitely grateful, both for the credit and for  the discipline of the regiment,--as well as for the men's subsequent  lives,--that the opposite method was adopted.    When the morning was a little advanced, I called on Mrs. A., who  received me in quite a stately way at her own door with \"To what am  I indebted for the honor of this visit, Sir?\" The foreign name of  the family, and the tropical look of the buildings, made it seem (as,  indeed, did all the rest of the adventure) like a chapter out of \"Amyas  Leigh\"; but as I had happened to hear that the lady herself was a  Philadelphian, and her deceased husband a New-Yorker, I could not feel  even that modicum of reverence due to sincere Southerners. However, I  wished to present my credentials; so, calling up my companion, I said  that I believed she had been previously acquainted with Corporal Robert  Sutton? I never saw a finer bit of unutterable indignation than came  over the face of my hostess, as she slowly recognized him. She drew  herself up, and dropped out the monosyllables of her answer as if they  were so many drops of nitric acid. \"Ah,\" quoth my lady, \"we called him  Bob!\"    It was a group for a painter. The whole drama of the war seemed to  reverse itself in an instant, and my tall, well-dressed, imposing,  philosophic Corporal dropped down the immeasurable depth into a mere  plantation \"Bob\" again. So at least in my imagination; not to that  person himself. Too essentially dignified in his nature to be moved by  words where substantial realities were in question, he simply turned  from the lady, touched his hat to me, and asked if I would wish to see  the slave-jail, as he had the keys in his possession.    If he fancied that I was in danger of being overcome by blandishments,  and needed to be recalled to realities, it was a master-stroke.    I must say that, when the door of that villanous edifice was thrown open  before me, I felt glad that my main interview with its lady proprietor  had passed before I saw it. It was a small building, like a Northern  corn-barn, and seemed to have as prominent and as legitimate a place  among the outbuildings of the establishment. In the middle of the door  was a large staple with a rusty chain, like an ox-chain, for fastening  a victim down. When the door had been opened after the death of the late  proprietor, my informant said, a man was found padlocked in that chain.  We found also three pairs of stocks of various construction, two of  which had smaller as well as larger holes, evidently for the feet of  women or children. In a building near by we found something far more  complicated, which was perfectly unintelligible till the men explained  all its parts: a machine so contrived that a person once imprisoned in  it could neither sit, stand, nor lie, but must support the body  half raised, in a position scarcely endurable. I have since bitterly  reproached myself for leaving this piece of ingenuity behind; but it  would have cost much labor to remove it, and to bring away the other  trophies seemed then enough. I remember the unutterable loathing with  which I leaned against the door of that prison-house; I had thought  myself seasoned to any conceivable horrors of Slavery, but it seemed as  if the visible presence of that den of sin would choke me. Of course  it would have been burned to the ground by us, but that this would have  involved the sacrifice of every other building and all the piles of  lumber, and for the moment it seemed as if the sacrifice would be  righteous. But I forbore, and only took as trophies the instruments of  torture and the keys of the jail.    We found but few colored people in this vicinity; some we brought away  with us, and an old man and woman preferred to remain. All the white  males whom we found I took as hostages, in order to shield us, if  possible, from attack on our way down river, explaining to them that  they would be put on shore when the dangerous points were passed. I  knew that their wives could easily send notice of this fact to the  Rebel forces along the river. My hostages were a forlorn-looking set of  \"crackers,\" far inferior to our soldiers in _physique_, and yet quite  equal, the latter declared, to the average material of the Southern  armies. None were in uniform, but this proved nothing as to their being  soldiers. One of them, a mere boy, was captured at his own door, with  gun in hand. It was a fowling-piece, which he used only, as his mother  plaintively assured me, \"to shoot little birds with.\" As the guileless  youth had for this purpose loaded the gun with eighteen buck-shot, we  thought it justifiable to confiscate both the weapon and the owner, in  mercy to the birds.    We took from this place, for the use of the army, a flock of some thirty  sheep, forty bushels of rice, some other provisions, tools, oars, and  a little lumber, leaving all possible space for the bricks which we  expected to obtain just below. I should have gone farther up the river,  but for a dangerous boom which kept back a great number of logs in a  large brook that here fell into the St. Mary's; the stream ran with  force, and if the Rebels had wit enough to do it, they might in ten  minutes so choke the river with drift-wood as infinitely to enhance  our troubles. So we dropped down stream a mile or two, found the very  brickyard from which Fort Clinch had been constructed,--still stored  with bricks, and seemingly unprotected. Here Sergeant Rivers again  planted his standard, and the men toiled eagerly, for several hours, in  loading our boat to the utmost with the bricks. Meanwhile we questioned  black and white witnesses, and learned for the first tune that the  Rebels admitted a repulse at Township Landing, and that Lieutenant Jones  and ten of their number were killed,--though this I fancy to have been  an exaggeration. They also declared that the mysterious steamer Berosa  was lying at the head of the river, but was a broken-down and worthless  affair, and would never get to sea. The result has since proved this;  for the vessel subsequently ran the blockade and foundered near shore,  the crew barely escaping with their lives. I had the pleasure, as it  happened, of being the first person to forward this information  to Admiral Dupont, when it came through the pickets, many months  after,--thus concluding my report on the Berosa.    Before the work at the yard was over the pickets reported mounted men in  the woods near by, as had previously been the report at Woodstock.  This admonished us to lose no time; and as we left the wharf, immediate  arrangements were made to have the gun crews all in readiness, and to  keep the rest of the men below, since their musketry would be of little  use now, and I did not propose to risk a life unnecessarily. The chief  obstacle to this was their own eagerness; penned down on one side, they  popped up on the other; their officers, too, were eager to see what was  going on, and were almost as hard to cork down as the men. Add to this,  that the vessel was now very crowded, and that I had to be chiefly  on the hurricane-deck with the pilots. Captain Clifton, master of the  vessel, was brave to excess, and as much excited as the men; he could no  more be kept in the little pilot-house than they below; and when we had  passed one or two bluffs, with no sign of an enemy, he grew more and  more irrepressible, and exposed himself conspicuously on the upper deck.  Perhaps we all were a little lulled by apparent safety; for myself, I  lay down for a moment on a settee in a state-room, having been on my  feet, almost without cessation, for twenty-four hours.    Suddenly there swept down from a bluff above us, on the Georgia side, a  mingling of shout and roar and rattle as of a tornado let loose; and  as a storm of bullets came pelting against the sides of the vessel, and  through a window, there went up a shrill answering shout from our own  men. It took but an instant for me to reach the gun-deck. After all my  efforts the men had swarmed once more from below, and already, crowding  at both ends of the boat, were loading and firing with inconceivable  rapidity, shouting to each other, \"Nebber gib it up!\" and of course  having no steady aim, as the vessel glided and whirled in the swift  current. Meanwhile the officers in charge of the large guns had their  crews in order, and our shells began to fly over the bluffs, which, as  we now saw, should have been shelled in advance, only that we had to  economize ammunition. The other soldiers I drove below, almost by main  force, with the aid of their officers, who behaved exceedingly well,  giving the men leave to fire from the open port-holes which lined  the lower deck, almost at the water's level. In the very midst of the  _melee_ Major Strong came from the upper deck, with a face of horror,  and whispered to me, \"Captain Clifton was killed at the first shot by my  side.\"    If he had said that the vessel was on fire the shock would hardly have  been greater. Of course, the military commander on board a steamer is  almost as helpless as an unarmed man, so far as the risks of water go. A  seaman must command there. In the hazardous voyage of last night, I  had learned, though unjustly, to distrust every official on board the  steamboat except this excitable, brave, warm-hearted sailor; and now,  among these added dangers, to lose him! The responsibility for his life  also thrilled me; he was not among my soldiers, and yet he was killed. I  thought of his wife and children, of whom he had spoken; but one learns  to think rapidly in war, and, cautioning the Major to silence, I went up  to the hurricane-deck and drew in the helpless body, that it should "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/677"],[0,"The Heroes; Or, Greek Fairy Tales for My Children (#16)"],[1,"far away across the sea.'  But all the heroes cried--    'If you die, we die with you; for without you we cannot win the fleece,  and home we will not go without it, but fall here fighting to the last  man.'    'You need not die,' said Jason.  'Flee home with us across the sea.  Show  us first how to win the fleece; for you can do it.  Why else are you the  priestess of the grove?  Show us but how to win the fleece, and come with  us, and you shall be my queen, and rule over the rich princes of the  Minuai, in Iolcos by the sea.'    And all the heroes pressed round, and vowed to her that she should be  their queen.    Medeia wept, and shuddered, and hid her face in her hands; for her heart  yearned after her sisters and her playfellows, and the home where she was  brought up as a child.  But at last she looked up at Jason, and spoke  between her sobs--    'Must I leave my home and my people, to wander with strangers across the  sea?  The lot is cast, and I must endure it.  I will show you how to win  the golden fleece.  Bring up your ship to the wood-side, and moor her  there against the bank; and let Jason come up at midnight, and one brave  comrade with him, and meet me beneath the wall.'    Then all the heroes cried together, 'I will go!' 'and I!' 'and I!'  And  Idas the rash grew mad with envy; for he longed to be foremost in all  things.  But Medeia calmed them, and said, 'Orpheus shall go with Jason,  and bring his magic harp; for I hear of him that he is the king of all  minstrels, and can charm all things on earth.'    And Orpheus laughed for joy, and clapped his hands, because the choice  had fallen on him; for in those days poets and singers were as bold  warriors as the best.    So at midnight they went up the bank, and found Medeia; and beside came  Absyrtus her young brother, leading a yearling lamb.    Then Medeia brought them to a thicket beside the War-god's gate; and  there she bade Jason dig a ditch, and kill the lamb, and leave it there,  and strew on it magic herbs and honey from the honeycomb.    Then sprang up through the earth, with the red fire flashing before her,  Brimo the wild witch-huntress, while her mad hounds howled around.  She  had one head like a horse's, and another like a ravening hound's, and  another like a hissing snake's, and a sword in either hand.  And she  leapt into the ditch with her hounds, and they ate and drank their fill,  while Jason and Orpheus trembled, and Medeia hid her eyes.  And at last  the witch-queen vanished, and fled with her hounds into the woods; and  the bars of the gates fell down, and the brazen doors flew wide, and  Medeia and the heroes ran forward and hurried through the poison wood,  among the dark stems of the mighty beeches, guided by the gleam of the  golden fleece, until they saw it hanging on one vast tree in the midst.  And Jason would have sprung to seize it; but Medeia held him back, and  pointed, shuddering, to the tree-foot, where the mighty serpent lay,  coiled in and out among the roots, with a body like a mountain pine.  His  coils stretched many a fathom, spangled with bronze and gold; and half of  him they could see, but no more, for the rest lay in the darkness far  beyond.    And when he saw them coming he lifted up his head, and watched them with  his small bright eyes, and flashed his forked tongue, and roared like the  fire among the woodlands, till the forest tossed and groaned.  For his  cries shook the trees from leaf to root, and swept over the long reaches  of the river, and over Aietes' hall, and woke the sleepers in the city,  till mothers clasped their children in their fear.    But Medeia called gently to him, and he stretched out his long spotted  neck, and licked her hand, and looked up in her face, as if to ask for  food.  Then she made a sign to Orpheus, and he began his magic song.    And as he sung, the forest grew calm again, and the leaves on every tree  hung still; and the serpent's head sank down, and his brazen coils grew  limp, and his glittering eyes closed lazily, till he breathed as gently  as a child, while Orpheus called to pleasant Slumber, who gives peace to  men, and beasts, and waves.                        [Picture: Jason takes the fleece]    Then Jason leapt forward warily, and stept across that mighty snake, and  tore the fleece from off the tree-trunk; and the four rushed down the  garden, to the bank where the _Argo_ lay.    There was a silence for a moment, while Jason held the golden fleece on  high.  Then he cried, 'Go now, good _Argo_, swift and steady, if ever you  would see Pelion more.'    And she went, as the heroes drove her, grim and silent all, with muffled  oars, till the pine-wood bent like willow in their hands, and stout  _Argo_ groaned beneath their strokes.    On and on, beneath the dewy darkness, they fled swiftly down the swirling  stream; underneath black walls, and temples, and the castles of the  princes of the East; past sluice-mouths, and fragrant gardens, and groves  of all strange fruits; past marshes where fat kine lay sleeping, and long  beds of whispering reeds; till they heard the merry music of the surge  upon the bar, as it tumbled in the moonlight all alone.    Into the surge they rushed, and _Argo_ leapt the breakers like a horse;  for she knew the time was come to show her mettle, and win honour for the  heroes and herself.    Into the surge they rushed, and _Argo_ leapt the breakers like a horse,  till the heroes stopped all panting, each man upon his oar, as she slid  into the still broad sea.    Then Orpheus took his harp and sang a paean, till the heroes' hearts rose  high again; and they rowed on stoutly and steadfastly, away into the  darkness of the West.        PART V  HOW THE ARGONAUTS WERE DRIVEN INTO THE UNKNOWN SEA      So they fled away in haste to the westward; but Aietes manned his fleet  and followed them.  And Lynceus the quick-eyed saw him coming, while he  was still many a mile away, and cried, 'I see a hundred ships, like a  flock of white swans, far in the east.'  And at that they rowed hard,  like heroes; but the ships came nearer every hour.    Then Medeia, the dark witch-maiden, laid a cruel and a cunning plot; for  she killed Absyrtus her young brother, and cast him into the sea, and  said, 'Ere my father can take up his corpse and bury it, he must wait  long, and be left far behind.'    And all the heroes shuddered, and looked one at the other for shame; yet  they did not punish that dark witch-woman, because she had won for them  the golden fleece.    And when Aietes came to the place he saw the floating corpse; and he  stopped a long while, and bewailed his son, and took him up, and went  home.  But he sent on his sailors toward the westward, and bound them by  a mighty curse--'Bring back to me that dark witch-woman, that she may die  a dreadful death.  But if you return without her, you shall die by the  same death yourselves.'    So the Argonauts escaped for that time: but Father Zeus saw that foul  crime; and out of the heavens he sent a storm, and swept the ship far  from her course.  Day after day the storm drove her, amid foam and  blinding mist, till they knew no longer where they were, for the sun was  blotted from the skies.  And at last the ship struck on a shoal, amid low  isles of mud and sand, and the waves rolled over her and through her, and  the heroes lost all hope of life.    Then Jason cried to Hera, 'Fair queen, who hast befriended us till now,  why hast thou left us in our misery, to die here among unknown seas?  It  is hard to lose the honour which we have won with such toil and danger,  and hard never to see Hellas again, and the pleasant bay of Pagasai.'    Then out and spoke the magic bough which stood upon the _Argo's_ beak,  'Because Father Zeus is angry, all this has fallen on you; for a cruel  crime has been done on board, and the sacred ship is foul with blood.'    At that some of the heroes cried, 'Medeia is the murderess.  Let the  witch-woman bear her sin, and die!'  And they seized Medeia, to hurl her  into the sea, and atone for the young boy's death; but the magic bough  spoke again, 'Let her live till her crimes are full.  Vengeance waits for  her, slow and sure; but she must live, for you need her still.  She must  show you the way to her sister Circe, who lives among the islands of the  West.  To her you must sail, a weary way, and she shall cleanse you from  your guilt.'    Then all the heroes wept aloud when they heard the sentence of the oak;  for they knew that a dark journey lay before them, and years of bitter  toil.  And some upbraided the dark witch-woman, and some said, 'Nay, we  are her debtors still; without her we should never have won the fleece.'  But most of them bit their lips in silence, for they feared the witch's  spells.    And now the sea grew calmer, and the sun shone out once more, and the  heroes thrust the ship off the sand-bank, and rowed forward on their  weary course under the guiding of the dark witch-maiden, into the wastes  of the unknown sea.    Whither they went I cannot tell, nor how they came to Circe's isle.  Some  say that they went to the westward, and up the Ister {130a} stream, and  so came into the Adriatic, dragging their ship over the snowy Alps.  And  others say that they went southward, into the Red Indian Sea, and past  the sunny lands where spices grow, round AEthiopia toward the West; and  that at last they came to Libya, and dragged their ship across the  burning sands, and over the hills into the Syrtes, where the flats and  quicksands spread for many a mile, between rich Cyrene and the  Lotus-eaters' shore.  But all these are but dreams and fables, and dim  hints of unknown lands.    But all say that they came to a place where they had to drag their ship  across the land nine days with ropes and rollers, till they came into an  unknown sea.  And the best of all the old songs tells us how they went  away toward the North, till they"]]]
