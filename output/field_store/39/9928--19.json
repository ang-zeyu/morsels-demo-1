Wolsey at once saw the risk which England had run. A successful invasion  on the part of the Scots would have been a severe blow to England's  military reputation; and Wolsey determined to be secure on the Scottish  side for the future. The Earl of Surrey, on his return from his  expedition in France, was put in charge of the defences of the Border,  and everything was done to humour Queen Margaret, and convince her that  she had more to gain from the favour of her brother than from the help  of the Duke of Albany. Moreover, Wolsey, already convinced of the  uselessness of the war against France, was still ready to gain from it  all that he could, and strove to use the threat of danger from Scotland  as a means of withdrawing from war and gaining a signal triumph. Francis  I., unable to defend himself, tried to separate his enemies, and turned  to Charles V. with offers of a truce. When this was refused, he repeated  his proposals to England, and Wolsey saw his opportunity. He represented  to Charles that so long as England was menaced by Scotland she could  send little effective help abroad; if Scotland were crushed she would be  free again. He suggested that the Emperor had little to win by military  enterprises undertaken with such slight preparation as the last  campaign; would he not make truce for a year, not comprehending the  realm of Scotland?    The suggestion was almost too palpable. Gattinara answered that Henry  wished to use his forces for his private advantage, and neglected the  common interest of the alliance. Again bitter complaints were made of  Wolsey's lukewarmness. Again the two allies jealously watched each other  lest either should gain an advantage by making a separate alliance with  France. And while they were thus engaged the common enemy of Christendom  was advancing, and Rhodes fell before the Turkish arms. It was in vain  that Adrian VI. lamented and wept; in vain he implored for succours.  Fair promises alone were given him. Europe was too much intent on the  duel between Francis and Charles to think seriously of anything else.  The entreaties of the Pope were only regarded by all parties as a good  means of enabling them to throw a decent veil over any measure which  their own interests might prompt. They might declare that it was taken  for the sake of the holy war; they might claim that they had acted from  a desire to fulfil the Pope's behest.    So things stood in the beginning of 1523, when an unexpected event  revived the military spirit of Henry VIII., and brought the two  half-hearted allies once more closely together, by the prospect which it  afforded of striking a deadly blow at France. The chief of the nobles of  France, the sole survivor of the great feudatories, the Constable of  Bourbon, was most unwisely affronted by Francis I., at a time when he  needed to rally all his subjects round him. Not only was Bourbon  affronted, but also a lawsuit was instituted against him, which  threatened to deprive him of the greater part of his possessions.  Bourbon, who could bring into the field 6000 men, did not find his  patriotism strong enough to endure this wrong. He opened up secret  negotiations with Charles, who disclosed the matter to Henry. Henry's  ambition was at once fired. He saw Francis I., hopelessly weakened by a  defection of the chief nobles, incapable of withstanding an attack upon  the interior of his land, so that the English troops might conquer the  old provinces which England still claimed, and victory might place upon  his head the crown of France.    Wolsey was not misled by this fantastic prospect, but as a campaign was  imminent, took all the precautions he could that it should be as little  costly as possible to England, and that Charles should bear his full  share of the expense. He demanded, moreover, that Bourbon should  acknowledge Henry VIII. as the rightful King of France--a demand which  was by no means acceptable to Charles. He sent an envoy of his own to  confer with Bourbon, but his envoy was delayed on the way, so that the  agreement was framed in the imperial interests alone, and the demands of  Henry were little heeded. The agreement was that Bourbon should receive  the hand of one of the Emperor's sisters, and should receive a subsidy  of 200,000 crowns to be paid equally by Henry and Charles; the question  of the recognition of Henry as rightful King of France was to be left to  the decision of the Emperor.    The plan of the campaign was quickly settled. Charles, with 20,000 men,  was to advance into Guienne; Henry, with 15,000 English, supported by  6000 Netherlanders, was to advance through Picardy; 10,000 Germans were  to advance through Burgundy; and Bourbon was to head a body of  dissatisfied nobles of France. It was an excellent plan on paper; and,  indeed, the position of France seemed hopeless enough. Francis I. had  squandered his people's money, and was exceedingly unpopular; Wolsey's  diplomacy had helped to win over the Swiss to the imperial alliance; and  the indefatigable secretary Pace had been sent to Venice to detach the  republic from its connexion with France. It was believed that Wolsey was  jealous of Pace's influence with Henry VIII., and contrived to keep him  employed on embassies which removed him from the Court. At all events,  he certainly kept him busily employed till his health gave way under the  excessive pressure. To lend greater weight to Pace's arguments, Wolsey  descended to an act of overbearing insolence. Some Venetian galleys  trading with Flanders put in at Plymouth during a storm; they were laid  under an embargo, and were detained on many flimsy pretexts. It was in  vain that the Venetian ambassador remonstrated; Wolsey always had a  plausible answer. Probably he wished to show Venice that its trading  interests required the friendship of England. At all events the galleys  were not released till Venice was on the point of joining the imperial  alliance. Even then Wolsey had the meanness to carry off a couple of  guns from each vessel, and Venice had to make a present of them to the  English king with as much grace as the circumstances allowed. This  little incident certainly shows Wolsey's conduct at its worst, and  confirms the impression of contemporaries, that he had to some degree  the insolence of an upstart, and sometimes overrode the weak in a way to  leave behind a bitter feeling of resentment.    However, Venice joined the Emperor, and Pope Adrian VI., who had pursued  hitherto a policy of pacification, was at last overborne by the pressure  of England and the Emperor, so that he entered into a defensive league  against France. Thus France was entirely isolated. Distrusted at home  and unbefriended abroad, she seemed to be a prey to her enemies; and  Henry's hopes rose so high that he gleefully looked forward to being  recognised as \"governor of France,\" and that \"they should by this means  make a way for him as King Richard did for his father.\" Wiser men shook  their heads at the king's infatuation. \"I pray God,\" wrote More to  Wolsey, \"if it be good for his Grace and for this realm that then it may  prove so; and else in the stead thereof I pray God send his grace an  honourable and profitable peace.\"    The spirit that breathes through this prayer is not a martial spirit,  and no doubt More's feelings represented those of Wolsey, who, though  carried away by the king's military zeal, had little hopes of any great  success, and such hopes as he had were rapidly destroyed. The campaign  did not begin till the end of September; the contingent from the  Netherlands was late in appearing and was ill supplied with food. Till  the last moment Wolsey urged, as the first object of the campaign, the  siege of Boulogne, which, if successful, would have given England a  second stronghold on the French coast; but Wolsey was overruled, and an  expedition into the interior of France was preferred. It was a  repetition of the raid made in the last year, and was equally futile.  The army advanced to Montdidier, and expected tidings of its  confederate; but nothing was to be heard of Bourbon; his lanzknechts  began to devastate France and then disbanded. The army of Charles V.  contented itself with taking Fontarabia, and did not co-operate with the  English forces. After the capture of Montdidier the troops, who were  attacked by sickness, and had difficulty in finding provisions, withdrew  to the coast; and the Duke of Suffolk brought back his costly army  without having obtained anything of service to England. This expedition,  which was to do so much, was a total failure--there was positively  nothing to be shown in return for all the money spent.    Again the wisdom of Wolsey's policy was fully justified. He was right in  thinking that England had neither troops nor generals who were  sufficient for an expedition on the Continent, where there was nothing  tangible to be gained. So long as England was a neutral and mediating  power she could pursue her own interests; but her threats were more  efficacious than her performances. She could not conquer unaided, and  her allies had no intention of allowing her to win more than empty  glory. Even this had been denied in the last campaigns. England had  incurred debts which her people could ill afford to pay, and had only  lowered her reputation by a display of military incompetence. Moreover,  her expedition against France involved her in the usual difficulties on  the side of Scotland. Again there was a devastating war along the  Border; again the Duke of Albany was sent from France and raised an army  for the invasion of England. But this time Wolsey had taken his  precautions, and the Earl of Surrey was ready to march against him. When  in November Albany crossed the Tweed and besieged the Castle of Wark,  Surrey took the field, and again Albany"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5396"],[0,"The Crisis — Complete (#16)"],[1,"Ach! I fear I will never be  the great lawyer--but the striver, yes, always. We must fight once more  to be rid of the black monster that sucks the blood of freedom--vampire.  Is it not so in English?\"    Stephen was astonished at this outburst.    \"You think it will come to war?\"    \"I fear,--yes, I fear,\" said the German, shaking his head. \"We fear. We  are already preparing.\"    \"Preparing? You would fight, Richter? You, a foreigner?\"    \"A foreigner!\" cried Richter, with a flash of anger in his blue eyes  that died as suddenly as it came,--died into reproach. \"Call me not a  foreigner--we Germans will show whether or not we are foreigners when  the time is ripe. This great country belongs to all the oppressed. Your  ancestors founded it, and fought for it, that the descendants of mine  might find a haven from tyranny. My friend, one-half of this city is  German, and it is they who will save it if danger arises. You must come  with me one night to South St. Louis, that you may know us. Then you  will perhaps understand, Stephen. You will not think of us as foreign  swill, but as patriots who love our new Vaterland even as you love it.  You must come to our Turner Halls, where we are drilling against the  time when the Union shall have need of us.\"    \"You are drilling now?\" exclaimed Stephen, in still greater  astonishment. The German's eloquence had made him tingle, even as had  the songs.    \"Prosit deine Blume!\" answered Richter, smiling and holding up his glass  of beer. \"You will come to a 'commerce', and see.    \"This is not our blessed Lichtenhainer, that we drink at Jena. One may  have a pint of Lichtenhainer for less than a groschen at Jena. Aber,\"  he added as he rose, with a laugh that showed his strong teeth, \"we  Americans are rich.\"    As Stephen's admiration for his employer grew, his fear of him waxed  greater likewise. The Judge's methods of teaching law were certainly not  Harvard's methods. For a fortnight he paid as little attention to the  young man as he did to the messengers who came with notes and cooled  their heels in the outer office until it became the Judge's pleasure to  answer them. This was a trifle discouraging to Stephen. But he stuck to  his Chitty and his Greenleaf and his Kent. It was Richter who advised  him to buy Whittlesey's \"Missouri Form Book,\" and warned him of Mr.  Whipple's hatred for the new code. Well that he did! There came a  fearful hour of judgment. With the swiftness of a hawk Mr. Whipple  descended out of a clear sky, and instantly the law terms began to  rattle in Stephen's head like dried peas in a can. It was the Old Style  of Pleading this time, without a knowledge of which the Judge declared  with vehemence that a lawyer was not fit to put pen to legal cap.    \"Now, sir, the pleadings?\" he cried.    \"First,\" said Stephen, \"was the Declaration. The answer to that was the  Plea. The answer to that was the Replication. Then came the Rejoinder,  then the Surrejoinder, then the Rebutter, then the Surrebutter. But they  rarely got that far,\" he added unwisely.    \"A good principle in Law, sir,\" said the Judge, \"is not to volunteer  information.\"    Stephen was somewhat cast down when he reached home that Saturday  evening. He had come out of his examination with feathers drooping. He  had been given no more briefs to copy, nor had Mr. Whipple vouchsafed  even to send him on an errand. He had not learned how common a thing  it is with young lawyers to feel that they are of no use in the world.  Besides, the rain continued. This was the fifth day.    His mother, knitting before the fire in her own room, greeted him  with her usual quiet smile of welcome. He tried to give her a humorous  account of his catechism of the morning, but failed.    \"I am quite sure that he doesn't like me,\" said Stephen.    His mother continued to smile.    \"If he did, he would not show it,\" she answered.    \"I can feel it,\" said Stephen, dejectedly.    \"The Judge was here this afternoon,\" said his mother.    \"What?\" cried Stephen. \"Again this week? They say that he never calls in  the daytime, and rarely in the evening. What did he say?\"    \"He said that some of this Boston nonsense must be gotten out of you,\"  answered Mrs. Brice, laughing. \"He said that you were too stiff. That  you needed to rub against the plain men who were building up the West.  Who were making a vast world-power of the original little confederation  of thirteen states. And Stephen,\" she added more earnestly, \"I am not  sure but what he is right.\"    Then Stephen laughed. And for a long time he sat staring into the fire.    \"What else did he say?\" he asked, after a while.    \"He told me about a little house which we might rent very cheaply.  Too cheaply, it seems. The house is on this street, next door to Mr.  Brinsmade, to whom it belongs. And Mr. Whipple brought the key, that we  might inspect it to-morrow.\"    \"But a servant,\" objected Stephen, \"I suppose that we must have a  servant.\"    His mother's voice fell.    \"That poor girl whom you freed is here to see me every day. Old Nancy  does washing. But Hester has no work and she is a burden to Judge  Whipple. Oh, no,\" she continued, in response to Stephen's glance, \"the  Judge did not mention that, but I think he had it in mind that Nester  might come. And I am sure that she would.\"    Sunday dawned brightly. After church Mrs. Brice and Stephen walked down  Olive Street, and stood looking at a tiny house wedged in between, two  large ones with scrolled fronts. Sad memories of Beacon Street filled  them both as they gazed, but they said nothing of this to each other. As  Stephen put his hand on the latch of the little iron gate, a gentleman  came out of the larger house next door. He was past the middle age,  somewhat scrupulously dressed in the old fashion, in swallowtail coat  and black stock. Benevolence was in the generous mouth, in the large  nose that looked like Washington's, and benevolence fairly sparkled in  the blue eyes. He smiled at them as though he had known them always,  and the world seemed brighter that very instant. They smiled in return,  whereupon the gentleman lifted his hat. And the kindliness and the  courtliness of that bow made them very happy. \"Did you wish to look at  the house, madam?\" he asked \"Yes, sir,\" said Mrs. Brice.    \"Allow me to open it for you,\" he said, graciously taking the key from  her. \"I fear that you will find it inconvenient and incommodious, ma'am.  I should be fortunate, indeed, to get a good tenant.\"    He fitted the key in the door, while Stephen and his mother smiled at  each other at the thought of the rent. The gentleman opened the door,  and stood aside to let them enter, very much as if he were showing them  a palace for which he was the humble agent.    They went into the little parlor, which was nicely furnished in mahogany  and horsehair. And it had back of it a bit of a dining room, with a  little porch overlooking the back yard. Mrs. Brice thought of the dark  and stately high-ceiled dining-room she had known throughout her married  days: of the board from which a royal governor of Massachusetts Colony  had eaten, and some governors of the Commonwealth since. Thank God, she  had not to sell that, nor the Brice silver which had stood on the high  sideboard with the wolves and the shield upon it. The widow's eyes  filled with tears. She had not hoped again to have a home for these  things, nor the father's armchair, nor the few family treasures that  were to come over the mountains.    The gentleman, with infinite tact, said little, but led the way through  the rooms. There were not many of them. At the door of the kitchen he  stopped, and laid his hand kindly on Stephen's shoulder:-- \"Here we may  not enter. This is your department, ma'am,\" said he.    Finally, as they stood without waiting for the gentleman, who insisted  upon locking the door, they observed a girl in a ragged shawl hurrying  up the street. As she approached them, her eyes were fixed upon the  large house next door. But suddenly, as the gentleman turned, she caught  sight of him, and from her lips escaped a cry of relief. She flung open  the gate, and stood before him.    \"Oh, Mr. Brinsmade,\" she cried, \"mother is dying. You have done so much  for us, sir,--couldn't you come to her for a little while? She thought  if she might see you once more, she would die happy.\" The voice was  choked by a sob.    Mr. Brinsmade took the girl's hand in his own, and turned to the lady  with as little haste, with as much politeness, as he had shown before.    \"You will excuse me, ma'am,\" he said, with his hat in his hand.    The widow had no words to answer him. But she and her son watched him  as he walked rapidly down the street, his arm in the girl's, until they  were out of sight. And then they walked home silently.    Might not the price of this little house be likewise a piece of the  Brinsmade charity?          CHAPTER XI. THE INVITATION    Mr. Eliphalet Hopper, in his Sunday-best broadcloth was a marvel of  propriety. It seemed to Stephen that his face wore a graver expression  on Sunday when he met him standing on Miss Crane's doorstep, picking  the lint from his coat. Stephen's intention was not to speak. But he  remembered what the Judge had said to his mother, and nodded. Why,  indeed, should he put on airs with this man who had come to St. Louis  unknown and unrecommended and poor, who by sheer industry had made  himself of importance in the large business of Carvel &, Company? As  for Stephen Brice, he was not yet earning his salt, but existing by the  charity of Judge Silas Whipple.    \"Howdy, Mr. Brice,\" said Mr. Hopper, his glance caught by the  indefinable in Stephen's costume. This would have puzzled Mr. Hopper's  tailor more.    \"Very well, thanks.\"    \"A fine day after the rain.\"    Stephen nodded, and Mr. Hopper entered the hours after him.    \"Be you asked to Virginia Carvel's party?\" he asked abruptly.    \"I do not"]]]
