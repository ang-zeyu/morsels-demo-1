Some girls are just never satisfied with what  other people give them.  She still argues that she was named  Susan to begin with.  And she's probably right, Jones County  didn't start keeping records until four years later.    Anyway, Uncle Jim's farm joined our farm on the east.  Dode was  working for Uncle Jim on his farm.  That made Dode and Susie  next-  door neighbors.  I think that was about the time I began to learn  a little bit about what being sweethearts was all about.    Well, the long-awaited day finally arrived and Susie and Dode got  married.  I don't remember much about it all.  In fact, I never  did know much about it.  They didn't tell me and I didn't know  enough about it to know what kind of questions to ask to find out  more.  If I remember right, it seems they just drove away in the  car one day with Papa, and when they returned, someone told me  they were married.  I couldn't tell by looking; they looked the  same as ever to me.  I was told they went to see a preacher but I  didn't know what for.    Even at that early date, the county began to need better roads.  Farmers were allowed to work on the county roads so-many days a  year as a way of paying their taxes.  The road work could be done  at a time most convenient to the individual farmers.  This was  not a matter of welfare handouts to farmers.  Rather, it was a  case where farmers worked together to improve conditions in their  community and still keep their money at home.    If a man was unable to do his share of the road work, the county  would collect tax money from that man and use it to hire another  man to work in his place.    Papa did his share of the county road work.  But with that work  added to all his regular farm work, he had to search for faster  and better ways to do some of his work.    You see, one of Papa's big problems was that he had a house full  of growing kids who could use a spoon right well at the dining  table, but were too little to use a feed-heading knife in the  field.    There just wasn't enough time to head our feed in the fall.  Papa  had a row binder with which to bundle the feed.  But he wanted  feed heads in the barn to feed his work horses.    So he bundled the feed with his binder and shocked it up to dry.  While it was drying, he built a large knife, somewhat like those  paper cutters you have seen in print shops.  He bolted the cutter  to one sideboard of his wagon Then he would drive the wagon up  beside a shock of feed in the field, and while he placed the  heads of a bundle across the lower knife blade, one of us boys  would bring the upper blade down and cut the heads off the  bundle.  When the heads were cut off, they fell into the wagon.    The cutter worked quite well when Papa had the proper boy  operating the knife, but sometimes he had to use me to help him.    As I said, Papa and I did a lot of things together.  Cutting  heads off bundles was one of those things.  Almost cutting his  hand off was another.    One day Papa was placing the bundles into the cutter and I was  working the upper knife.  I thought he was ready for me to cut,  but he hadn't gotten his hand back out of the cutter.  It looked  to me like a bad cut.  It bled a lot at first.  I sure regretted  what I had done, but I guess it wasn't cut very badly because he  wrapped his bandanna around his hand and we went right on with  our work.    Papa was always and forever doing things that fascinated me and,  at the same time, taught us to use our heads and develop our  skills.    When we had used all the hot water washing our feet at bedtime,  and there was not enough water for Papa to wash his, he didn't  seem to mind.  He would get a wash pan of cold water, set it on  the hearth and put in live coals of fire until his water was hot  enough.  We kids liked to hear the hot coals sizzle in the water.    There were times when the kitchen was too cold for comfort at  early breakfast time.  Of course, the dining table was in the  cold kitchen.  Well, Papa would take an open-top, five-gallon can  with about four inches of ashes in the bottom and a few  shovelfulls of hot coals on top of the ashes and set the can  under the dining table.  That would warm our feet while we ate  breakfast.  And it would also help warm up the kitchen.    So, it was there at the Exum place that I spent six of the best  years of my life.  They were years of family contentment and  prosperity--we youngsters working, playing, exploring, wading in  the creek, hunting rabbits with air rifles, going to school;  gathering eggs, feeding chickens, feeding cows and horses;  playing in the barn, playing in the cottonseed, eating peanuts in  the barn loft, wading in puddles after summer showers; enjoying  the warm fire in the fireplace, washing our feet by the warm  hearth at bedtime, snuggling between warm blankets in cold  bedrooms; in short, growing up and enjoying every minute of it.          CHAPTER 7    DRY YEARS ON THE TEXAS PLAINS    Papa had two rancher brothers, Joe and Simpson, who had remained  in the cattle business when all the rest of the Johnsons went to  farming.  And Papa preferred cattle ranching over cotton farming.  So he got the urge to get back to growing more cattle and not so  much cotton.    This was not just a far-out dream as if he didn't know what he  was doing.  After all, he had been in the cattle business with  his father until the time they all moved back to Texas from  Oklahoma.  At that time he went to farming because it required  far less capital to be a farmer than to be a rancher.  And he was  a young man just starting out on his own.    But now he had accumulated a little of this world's goods and he  thought it was time to step up to a larger place that would grow  enough cows and calves to afford a better future for him and his  family.  This was not just a wild adventure.  He knew it was  easier to grow a dollar's worth of calves than it was to grow a  dollar's worth of cotton.    We had prospered greatly during our six years on the Exum farm.  But our chances for expanding in Jones County were limited.  Most  of the good pasture land had been cleared and put into  cultivation.  But on the West Texas plains there was ample room  to expand.  The soil was rich for farming and yet not too  expensive for pasture land.    So in 1916 Papa went to that land of promise and bought a section  of unimproved land ten miles southwest of Lamesa.  It was a half-  mile wide and two miles long.  It was part of the old  Higginbotham Ranch.  The ranch was being sold piece-by-piece for  farms.  And it seemed to be a very good place to grow feed and  cattle.    Now Papa knew he would have to have a place to live.  He knew he  couldn't move onto unimproved land and start making a living on  it.  So he also bought another smaller farm about five miles from  the large one.  It was fairly well improved.  His plan was to  live on the small farm while he sent us kids to school, built  five miles of wolf proof fence around the new land, had a well  drilled, put up a windmill and a water tank and built an eight-  room, two-story house to live in.  He did all this on the new  land.    With that much completed, we moved onto the new farm and started  building a small barn, chicken house, car shed, tool house, storm  cellar, wash house, an out house, a yard fence, field fences and  cross fences.  This all took quite a spell but by this time the  place was fairly well improved.    But wait--before we did anything to either farm we moved into the  house on the small farm in the dead of winter.  Dode and Susie  moved in with us--or rather, we moved in with them.  The plan was  for them to farm the small place and we would farm and ranch the  large place.  We would live with Dode and Susie until we made the  other place livable.    There we were, all of us, in the cold winter, waiting for the  weather to cooperate so we could begin improving the raw land.    Meanwhile the family who sold us the small farm with the house on  it, and who had planned to be moved out by this date, had not  moved out.  And since it was coming a blue norther and snowing  outside.  They were not in a big hurry to move out.  But they  were kind to us and shared with us what they had--which was ours  of course.    There were four in their family.  They retained the kitchen with  a cookstove in it, the livingroom with a heating stove in it, and  a bedroom.  They let us have two small rooms in which to store  our furniture and cook and eat and sleep.    There was no flue for a stove in our part of the house.  We ran a  stovepipe out through one window and attached the lower end of it  to a small heating stove so we could fry flapjacks and heat the  room.  But when the wind blew from the wrong direction, the fire  smoked up our rooms and we had to aim the stovepipe out another  window more in keeping with the direction the wind was going.    It seems that the family in the other part of the house was named  Stewart--Mr. and Mrs. Stewart and their two kiddos.  Boy!  Did  they deal us misery by not sharing a greater portion of our house  with us.  I think I would hate everybody named Stewart except I'm  not quite sure Stewart is the right name.    Man, it was cold!  As I said, there were four of them in three of  our rooms with good stoves in two of the rooms.  And in the two  rooms that we had there was Papa, Mama, Susie, Dode, Earl, Joel,  Albert, Ollie Mae, William Robert, and me--ten of us.  And out in  the pasture were all our cows and horses, practically freezing to  death.  Mr. Stewart was using our sheds for his cows and horses.    Papa had bought two or three carloads of cows in Jones County and  had shipped them to Lamesa by rail, along with our horses,  household goods and farming tools.    You know the old saying, \"Things could have been worse.\"  Well  this time we didn't think things could ever be worse.  But we  were wrong.  They "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54331"],[0,"Life of a Pioneer: Being the Autobiography of James S. Brown (#16)"],[1,"we would have to fight, and perhaps get defeated, in which  case it would be not only a loss of property but of life as well.    On December 12 and 13 we followed down the San Pedro, our course  being nearly due north, near the base of a mountain extending towards  the Gila River. The guide, Leroux, with others, returned from an  exploration of the table-land to the west, leading to Tucson. They  found a party of Apache Indians and some Mexicans distilling mescal,  and learned from them that the Mexican garrison at Tucson numbered  about two hundred men. The interpreter with the guides, Dr. Foster,  had thought it proper to go to Tucson, and Leroux told the Mexicans to  inform the commander at Tucson that an American army was approaching  en route to California; that the advance guard numbered about three  hundred and sixty men, and if it stopped to drill it would give time  for the main army to come up; that the strength of the main army could  be judged by the size of its vanguard; and that if Foster did not  rejoin the advance guard by a given time it would be understood that he  was a prisoner at Tucson. Upon learning what had been done and said,  Colonel Cooke issued the following order:    \"Headquarters Mormon Battalion, Camp on the San Pedro, Dec. 13, 1846.    \"Thus far on our course to California we have followed the guides  furnished us by the general. These guides now point to Tucson, a  garrison town, as on our road, and assert that any other course is  one hundred miles out of the way, and over a trackless wilderness of  mountains, rivers and hills. We will march then to Tucson. We came  not to make war on Sonora, and less still to destroy an important  outpost of defense against Indians. But we will take the straight road  before us and overcome all resistance, but shall I remind you that the  American soldier ever shows justice and kindness to the unarmed and  unresisting? The property of individuals you will hold sacred; the  people of Sonora are not our enemies.                \"By order of Lieutenant Colonel Cooke.                                     \"P. C. Merrill, Adjutant.\"        CHAPTER IX.    ON THE TRAIL TO TUCSON--EXCITEMENT IN THE TOWN--MEET MEXICAN  SOLDIERS--OUR NUMBERS OVERRATED BY THE INDIANS--MEXICAN COMMANDER  UNDER ORDERS TO OPPOSE US--COLONEL COOKE ANNOUNCES HIS WISH TO  PASS ON WITHOUT HOSTILITIES--ARREST OF CORPORAL CASSADURAN, SON OF  THE MEXICAN COMMANDER AT TUCSON, AND OTHER MEXICANS WHO ARE HELD  AS HOSTAGES FOR THE RETURN OF OUR INTERPRETER--THE INTERPRETER IS  LIBERATED--AN ARMISTICE PROPOSED--SURRENDER OF TUCSON DEMANDED--MEXICAN  PRISONERS RELEASED--SURRENDER IS REFUSED--COLONEL COOKE ORDERS THE  BATTALION TO PREPARE FOR BATTLE--ADVANCE TOWARD THE TOWN--FLIGHT OF  THE MEXICANS--AT THE GATES OF TUCSON--OUR LINE OF BATTLE--ADDRESS BY  COLONEL COOKE--WE ENTER THE TOWN, AND PASS THROUGH TO CAMP--PURCHASES  OF WHEAT, CORN, ETC.--THE BATTALION NEARLY STARVED--NIGHT ALARM OF  A MEXICAN ATTACK--DIFFICULTIES OF GETTING INTO LINE--NO ENEMY IN  SIGHT--START ACROSS THE GILA DESERT--AGONY ON THE BURNING SANDS AND  ALKALI FLAT---STRENGTHENED BY THE DIVINE BLESSING--REACH THE GILA RIVER.    ON the 14th the battalion ascended to the plateau, traveling up hill  for eight or nine miles, when it struck the trail leading to Tucson.  Colonel Cooke selected fifty men, with whom he pushed forward. Passing  the vanguard, he soon reached water, where he found four or five  Mexican soldiers cutting grass. Their arms and saddles were on their  horses near by, easily accessible to our men. But these had no wish to  molest them, and the Mexicans appeared to pay little attention to us.    The colonel learned from a Mexican sergeant that rumors of a large  force of American troops coming had reached Tucson, and great  excitement prevailed in the town. Of course the colonel, who was  possessed of generalship as well as a stern sense of discipline, took  no pains to disabuse the Mexicans' minds, and thus possibly expose  our little army to unnecessary peril. Indians who had seen us from a  distance had overestimated largely our numbers, and thus served to  impress the people of Sonora with the accuracy of the statement made by  the guides.    The colonel also learned from the Mexican sergeant that the commander  of the garrison had orders from the governor not to allow any armed  force to pass through the town without resistance. A message was  therefore sent to the commander by this same sergeant, saying that the  people need not be alarmed, as we were their friends and would do them  no harm, as we wished merely to purchase supplies and pass on.    The next day we traveled about twelve miles, passing a distillery, and  camped without water. The battalion marched in front of the wagons, to  protect the provisions. Here a new (to us) species of cactus proved  very troublesome. It was jointed, and when an animal rubbed against the  thorns it broke loose at the joints, and sections about three inches  long would stick fast to the animal. The same variety of cactus is  found in southern Utah.    This day a corporal, the son of Cassaduran, commander of the Mexican  post at Tucson, and three Mexican soldiers were met with. They showed  no signs of fear until Colonel Cooke ordered them arrested, when they  seemed terribly frightened. On arriving at our camp, the corporal was  questioned by the commander as to Dr. Foster. He said (and it proved to  be true) that Foster was under guard, but had been requested earnestly  to come with them, and had refused. He had feigned indignation at being  arrested, lest the Mexicans should be suspicious as to our numbers and  should get reinforcements and fight us. As he anticipated, his conduct  inspired them with terror.    One of the Mexican prisoners was released and sent to the garrison  with two of the guides, one of whom took a note to the commander of  the post, demanding Foster's release and stating that the other three  Mexicans were held as hostages. About midnight, Dr. Foster was brought  into camp by two officers, one of whom was authorized to arrange a  special armistice.    Colonel Cooke sent a proposition to the Mexican commander that he  deliver up a few arms as a guaranty of surrender, and that the  inhabitants of Tucson would not fight against the United States, unless  released as prisoners of war. The Mexican prisoners also were released.  Our camp at this time was about sixteen miles from Tucson; and on our  advance the following day, when a few miles out, a cavalryman met us  with a note from Captain Cassaduran, declining the proposition to  surrender. We were thereupon ordered to load our muskets and prepare  for an engagement. We had not traveled far, however, before two other  Mexicans met us, with the news that the garrison at Tucson had fled,  and had forced most of the inhabitants to leave the town. They also  had taken two brass pieces of artillery with them. A little later in  the day, about a dozen well armed men, probably soldiers in citizens'  dress, met and accompanied the battalion to Tucson. But before passing  through the gates a halt was ordered.    That morning, when we were striking camp for the march into Tucson, Dr.  Sanderson opened up again by remarking that \"every d--d man who could  stand alone ought to fall into line.\" Our first move was to form ranks  with everything in proper order to make an assault or receive a charge.  Then we moved out in line of battle. When within three or four miles of  the fort a stop was made, we were faced to the right, and the command  came to forward march, double-quick time. At that the whole column  moved on a smart trot. Some of us, at least, thought we were advancing  upon an enemy that had been discovered by the commander; but when we  had gone pell-mell over cobblerock and gullies, through brush and  cactus, for a distance of nearly three quarters of a mile, we received  the command to halt. Then came orders to left face, file left, march.  This move brought us back into the road, where we filed to the right  and marched on to the fort.    At the gates of the fort. Colonel Cooke made a brief speech, stating  that the soldiers and citizens had fled, leaving their property behind  and in our power; that we had not come to make war on Sonora; and that  there must not be any interference with the private property of the  citizens.    We then marched through the town, where a few aged men and women and  some children brought us water and other small tokens of respect. We  made no halt in the village, which had contained some four or five  hundred inhabitants, of which number all but about a hundred had fled.  Our stop was made about half a mile down stream from the place.    In the town we made purchases of wheat, corn, beans and peas, which we  parched or boiled. We were so near starved that we could not wait for  this food to be more than half cooked before we ate it. There was no  general supply purchased at Tucson, but each man or mess obtained as  much as could be with the scanty means on hand.    On the night of December 17, Albern Allen and his son Rufus C. Allen  had been placed on picket guard above Tucson, with orders that if any  body of men, say ten or more, appeared, an alarm was to be fired, and  the guards were to run into camp. Sometime between midnight and two  o'clock a body of Mexicans put in an appearance, and the alarm was  given as ordered. The bugle sounded at the colonel's quarters, and soon  Lieutenant George Oman, who was officer of the day, rushed through the  camp, shouting, \"Beat that drum; if you cannot beat the drum, beat the  fife!\" The drum-major, R. D. Sprague, obeyed the order, and hit the  drum. Immediately the stern voice of the colonel shouted to cease that  music. In less time than it takes to tell it, lights sprang up through  the camp. Then came the sharp command from the colonel, \"Dust those  fires!\" and the flames went out; the adjutant rushed"]]]
