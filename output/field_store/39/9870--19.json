The general effect, wherever the wall is at  all perfect, is stately and striking in the extreme, both in form and  colour.    Now was it only a dream when we tracked out these walls, and took a  certain pleasure in speaking of them as Hernican walls? We come back  to our library; we take down the _Dictionary of Geography_; we turn to  the article \"Anagnia,\" and we find that by far the best contributor to  the series, Mr. E. H. Bunbury, has another tale to tell. Our feelings  are damped when he says, \"The only remains extant there are of Roman  date and of little interest.\" As to the \"little interest,\" we venture  to have our own opinion in any case; we should hold that so great  an extent of ancient wall still bounding an inhabited town was an  object of high interest, even if it could be shown to belong to the  latest days which could come under the definition of \"Roman date.\"  But what is Roman date? Mr. Bunbury sends us to the correspondence of  the Emperor Marcus with Cornelius Fronto. We hope he does not ask us  to believe that the walls are later than the days of the philosophic  Emperor. For, if he will allow them to be as old as that, we can call  the Emperor himself to witness that they must be a good deal older. For  Marcus himself read an inscription over one of the gates, \"_Flamen sume  samentum_.\" He did not know what \"_samentum_\" meant, and we cannot find  the word in our Latin dictionary. But a native explained to him its  meaning in the Hernican language; it meant the skin of the victim which  the _flamen_ put on his head when he entered the town. We do not want  to be unreasonable in our dates, if only we can let in our Hernicans  at some corner. When we looked at the walls, we saw at once that they  had no fellowship with the primaeval works at Cori and at Segni; they  did seem to us to have fellowship with the works of the Tarquins at  Rome. We shall be quite happy if Mr. Bunbury will allow us to put the  walls as early as the year B.C. 307. The next year Anagnia sank from  a Hernican city, a free ally of Rome, into a town whose people were  burthened with Roman citizenship without the Roman franchise. If we may  carry back walls over whose gates Hernican inscriptions could be read  between four and five hundred years later, to a date as nearly as that,  we shall have done all that we could wish. They will be walls of the  days of Hernican independence, walls on which Hannibal and Pyrrhos have  looked.    One thing is plain, that the builders of the walls of Anagnia, like the  builders of the _cloaca_ at Rome, but most unlike the elder builders  of Cora and Signia, knew as well as any men how to turn arches. On  the highest point of the town, by the modern gate which looks out  towards Ferentino, within the circuit of the ancient _arx_, we may  still see, blocked, partly hidden by the modern gate, disguised  by the arrangements of the mediaeval castle, the double gate of the  ancient wall. It is perfectly plain, but with arches thoroughly well  turned, with a double range of voussoirs. A smaller arch of the same  workmanship beside them looks almost as if it had been blocked from the  beginning. The _arx_ itself, it should be remembered, had its separate  wall within that of the city, a noble fragment of which, of exactly the  same character as the town wall, is still to be seen in a narrow street  a little lower down.    When we actually reach Anagni, there can be no doubt that the character  in which it chiefly strikes us is that of the city of the Hernican  walls, if Hernican walls we may call them. But historically Anagni is  so far more famous as the city of mediaeval Popes that it is fitting  that it should have something to show in that character also. The  town is rich in mediaeval fragments. The main street, in its winding  courses, displays long ranges of blocked arcades, round and pointed,  which, when open, must have given it, narrow and often dim as it is,  no small measure of stateliness. Not a few buildings stand out with  arches of vast height and boldness, suggesting, as it is fit that one  papal city should suggest to another, the mighty works of Rome's absent  Bishops at Avignon. Not remarkable for height, but most remarkable for  their span, are the exceedingly bold arches which support the communal  palace, once, it is said, the dwelling of the Popes, a building which,  on its northern side, shows a range of windows which savour of France  or England rather than of Italy. The houses with their staircases  often present highly picturesque shapes, which in one house in the  main street, where the outside staircase is sheltered by two arches  resting on a graceful column, grow into a form of genuine beauty. And  an elegant form of double window, two round arches divided by a slender  shaft, is characteristic of the architecture of Anagni. It is needless  to add that at Anagni, as everywhere else in Italy, most of these  relics of the skill of former times have been mercilessly disfigured  and mutilated.    In the ecclesiastical line the other churches supply a few good  fragments of the same character as those in the domestic building; but  the cathedral church within the _arx_ is the only one which has the  least claim to be looked on as a striking whole. It stands boldly on  the edge of the hill with its east end--that is, what would be east  according to northern rules, for it is in truth nearly west--rising  up nobly with its three apses in good Romanesque style, while a  stately bell-tower of the more massive sort, though sadly marred on  two sides, stands near the east end which should be west. The crypt is  in a somewhat ruder form of the same style. The whole outside of the  church is worth study; the inside is of an early and massive type of  the Italian Gothic, always, unless in the case of some unusual merit,  less satisfactory than Italian Romanesque. The sacristy contains  the vestments of Innocent III. and Boniface VIII., and a good many  other curious objects. The church is just now suffering restoration;  let us hope that nothing very dreadful will happen to it. There, at  least, seems no disposition to pull down the apse, after the pattern  of the church which Popes and Emperors alike have decreed to be the  mother-church of Rome and of the world.          II. Ferentino.      Italy contains two places bearing the name of Ferentinum or Ferentino,  as England contains two places--perhaps more--bearing the several  names of Leeds, Stafford, Birmingham, Hereford, Cambridge, Washington,  Rochester, and others more obvious. And as the Northumbrian Rochester  is also very conveniently written _Rutchester_, so the Etruscan  Ferentinum is also conveniently written _Ferentia_. On an _iter ad  Brundisium_ we cannot possibly have anything to do with Etruscan  Ferentia; our business lies with that Ferentinum which, according to  the Itineraries, was to be found on the _Via Latina_ between Anagnia  and Frusino, and which is to be found there still. But if the name  of the southern Ferentinum is more certain than that of its fellow,  its ancient nationality is less certain. Its historical position is  Hernican; it lies between Hernican Anagnia and Hernican Frusino; yet  it is also spoken of as Volscian, as it may well have become in the  endless warfare of those ever-shifting nations. Yet it is in other  company that we should be best pleased to find it. Our earliest  remembrance of the name places \"Ferentinum of the rock\" among the  Thirty Cities, and gives it no mean place among them. We go to the spot  with the lines ringing in our ears which place its warriors under the  rule of proud Tarquin himself, on the spot where--         ... in the centre thickest         Were ranged the shields of foes,       And from the centre loudest         The cry of battle rose.    Yet, even without book, we may have been a little surprised both to  find a Thirty-city so far in the heart of the Volscian and Hernican  hills, and to find its warriors marshalled along with such distant  comrades as Tibur and Pedum and \"Gabii of the pool.\" And, when we  come back to our books, a horrible thought presses itself upon us more  and more, a thought that Ferentinum may have no right to any place in  that list at all. The name seems to be Lord Macaulay's guess--among a  hundred other guesses--at the manifestly corrupt name which comes next  before Gabii in Dionysios' list of the Latin cities. Some read as near  to our mark as _Fortinei_; so we may hope for the best; but remembering  where Ferentinum stands, very far from Gabii, we confess that our hopes  are small.    In obedience to the Itinerary, it is from Anagni that we make our way  to Ferentino. And as we go from Anagni to Ferentino, we better take  in the special position of Anagni on the top of its isolated hill.  Till we have gone some little distance, we are hardly conscious that  Anagni is there at all; gradually the bell-tower rises into view, and  the rest of the city follows. A few miles only lead us from the hill  of Anagni to the hill of Ferentino. At the first glance it may be that  the spot which we have reached does not specially strike as \"Ferentinum  of the rock.\" It does not seem to stand on such steep cliffs as many  other hill-fortresses, Norba pre-eminently among them. But, when we  begin to follow the line of the walls, we find out that, whether Lord  Macaulay is right or wrong in speaking of Ferentinum at all, he has  at least chosen his epithet wisely. Ferentinum is Ferentinum of the  rock. Large parts of the wall stand directly on vast masses of rock,  and sometimes rock and wall almost lose themselves in one another.  And the walls of Ferentino certainly yield in interest to none of  our series. They are still standing through the greater part of their  ancient circuit, and for the most part they are of two manifest dates,  differing in material and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4602"],[0,"\"The Kingdom of God Is Within You\" (#16)"],[1,"(holidays are the days on which Christ was born, though no one  knows when that was, on which he was circumcised, on which the  Mother of God died, on which the cross was carried in procession,  on which ikons have been set up, on which a lunatic saw a vision,  and so on)--on holidays he must dress himself in his best clothes  and go to church, and must buy candles and place them there before  the images of the saints.  Then he must give offerings and prayers  for the dead, and little loaves to be cut up into three-cornered  pieces, and must pray many times for the health and prosperity of  the Tzar and the bishops, and for himself and his own affairs, and  then kiss the cross and the hand of the priest.  Besides these observances, it is instilled into him that at  least once a year he must confess.  To confess means to go to the  church and to tell the priest his sins, on the theory that this  informing a stranger of his sins completely purifies him from  them.  And after that he must eat with a little spoon a morsel of  bread with wine, which will purify him still more.  Next it is  instilled into him that if a man and woman want their physical  union to be sanctified they must go to church, put on metal  crowns, drink certain potions, walk three times round a table to  the sound of singing, and that then the physical union of a man  and woman becomes sacred and altogether different from all other  such unions.    Further it is instilled into him in his life that he must observe  the following rules: not to eat butter or milk on certain days,  and on certain other days to sing Te Deums and requiems for the  dead, on holidays to entertain the priest and give him money, and  several times in the year to bring the ikons from the church, and  to carry them slung on his shoulders through the fields and  houses.  It is instilled into him that on his death-bed a man must  not fail to eat bread and wine with a spoon, and that it will be  still better if he has time to be rubbed with sacred oil.  This  will guarantee his welfare in the future life.  After his death it  is instilled into his relatives that it is a good thing for the  salvation of the dead man to place a printed paper of prayers in  his hands; it is a good thing further to read aloud a certain book  over the dead body, and to pronounce the dead man's name in church  at a certain time.  All this is regarded as faith obligatory on  everyone.    But if anyone wants to take particular care of his soul, then  according to this faith he is instructed that the greatest  security of the salvation of the soul in the world is attained by  offering money to the churches and monasteries, and engaging the  holy men by this means to pray for him. Entering monasteries too  and kissing relics and miraculous ikons, are further means of  salvation for the soul.    According to this faith ikons and relics communicate a special  sanctity, power, and grace, and even proximity to these objects,  touching them, kissing them, putting candles before them, crawling  under them while they are being carried along, are all efficacious  for salvation, as well as Te Deums repeated before these holy  things.    So this, and nothing else, is the faith called Orthodox, that is  the actual faith which, under the guise of Christianity, has been  with all the forces of the Church, and is now with especial zeal,  instilled into the people.    And let no one say that the Orthodox teachers place the essential  part of their teaching in something else, and that all these are  only ancient forms, which it is not thought necessary to do away  with.  That is false.  This, and nothing but this, is the faith  taught through the whole of Russia by the whole of the Russian  clergy, and of late years with especial zeal.  There is nothing  else taught.  Something different may be talked of and written of  in the capitals; but among the hundred millions of the people this  is what is done, this is what is taught, and nothing more.  Churchmen may talk of something else, but this is what they teach  by every means in their power.    All this, and the worship of relics and of ikons, has been  introduced into works of theology and into the catechisms.  Thus  they teach it to the people in theory and in practice, using every  resource of authority, solemnity, pomp, and violence to impress  them.  They compel the people, by overawing them, to believe in  this, and jealously guard this faith from any attempt to free the  people from these barbarous superstitions.    As I said when I published my book, Christ's teaching and his very  words about non-resistance to evil were for many years a subject  for ridicule and low jesting in my eyes, and Churchmen, far from  opposing it, even encouraged this scoffing at sacred things.  But  try the experiment of saying a disrespectful word about a hideous  idol which is carried sacrilegiously about Moscow by drunken men  under the name of the ikon of the Iversky virgin, and you will  raise a groan of indignation from these same Churchmen.  All that  they preach is an external observance of the rites of idolatry.  And let it not be said that the one does not hinder the other,  that \"These ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other  undone.\"  \"All, therefore, whatsoever they bid you observe, that  observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and  do not\" (Matt. xxiii. 23, 3).    This was spoken of the Pharisees, who fulfilled all the external  observances prescribed by the law, and therefore the words  \"whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do,\" refer to  works of mercy and goodness, and the words \"do not ye after their  works, for they say and do not,\" refer to their observance of  ceremonies and their neglect of good works, and have exactly the  opposite meaning to that which the Churchmen try to give to the  passage, interpreting it as an injunction to observe ceremonies.  External observances and the service of truth and goodness are for  the most part difficult to combine; the one excludes the other.  So it was with the Pharisees, so it is now with Church Christians.    If a man can be saved by the redemption, by sacraments, and by  prayer, then he does not need good works.    The Sermon on the Mount, or the Creed. One cannot believe in both. And  Churchmen have chosen the latter. The Creed is taught and is read as a  prayer in the churches, but the Sermon on the Mount is excluded even  from the Gospel passages read in the churches, so that the congregation  never hears it in church, except on those days when the whole of the  Gospel is read. Indeed, it could not be otherwise. People who believe in  a wicked and senseless God--who has cursed the human race and devoted  his own Son to sacrifice, and a part of mankind to eternal  torment--cannot believe in the God of love. The man who believes in a  God, in a Christ coming again in glory to judge and to punish the quick  and the dead, cannot believe in the Christ who bade us turn the left  cheek, judge not, forgive these that wrong us, and love our enemies. The  man who believes in the inspiration of the Old Testament and the sacred  character of David, who commanded on his deathbed the murder of an old  man who had cursed him, and whom he could not kill himself because he  was bound by an oath to him, and the similar atrocities of which the Old  Testament is full, cannot believe in the holy love of Christ. The man  who believes in the Church's doctrine of the compatibility of warfare  and capital punishment with Christianity cannot believe in the  brotherhood of all men.    And what is most important of all--the man who believes in  salvation through faith in the redemption or the sacraments,  cannot devote all his powers to realizing Christ's moral teaching  in his life.    The man who has been instructed by the Church in the profane  doctrine that a man cannot be saved by his own powers, but that  there is another means of salvation, will infallibly rely upon  this means and not on his own powers, which, they assure him, it  is sinful to trust in.    The teaching of every Church, with its redemption and sacraments,  excludes the teaching of Christ; most of all the teaching of the  Orthodox Church with its idolatrous observances.    \"But the people have always believed of their own accord as they  believe now,\" will be said in answer to this.  \"The whole history  of the Russian people proves it.  One cannot deprive the people of  their traditions.\"  This statement, too, is misleading.  The  people did certainly at one time believe in something like what  the Church believes in now, though it was far from being the same  thing.  In spite of their superstitious regard for ikons,  housespirits, relics, and festivals with wreaths of birch leaves,  there has still always been in the people a profound moral and  living understanding of Christianity, which there has never been  in the Church as a whole, and which is only met with in its best  representatives.  But the people, notwithstanding all the  prejudices instilled into them by the government and the Church,  have in their best representatives long outgrown that crude stage  of understanding, a fact which is proved by the springing up  everywhere of the rationalist sects with which Russia is swarming  to-day, and on which Churchmen are now carrying on an ineffectual  warfare.  The people are advancing to a consciousness of the  moral, living side of Christianity.  And then the Church  comes forward, not borrowing from the people, but zealously  instilling into them the petrified formalities of an extinct  paganism, and striving to thrust them back again into the  darkness from which they are emerging with such effort.    \"We teach the people nothing new, nothing but what they believe,  only in a more perfect form,\" say the Churchmen.  This is just  what the man did who tied up the full-grown chicken and thrust it  back into the"]]]
