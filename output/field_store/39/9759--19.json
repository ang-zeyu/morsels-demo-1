This       constitutional infirmity of body and of mind furnishes to       the mesmerist a basis for his operations, and is the source       of all the wonders which he works.         \"It is only in the case of individuals who, without being       fatuous, are hovering on the verge of fatuity, that the       magnetic phenomena and the mesmeric prostration can be       admitted to be in any considerable degree real. Real to a       certain extent they may be; marvellous they certainly are       not. Imbecility of the nervous system, a ready abandonment       of the will, a facility in relinquishing every endowment       which makes man _human_--these intelligible causes, eked out       by a vanity and cunning which are always inherent in natures       of an inferior type, are quite sufficient to account for the       effects of the mesmeric manipulations on subjects of       peculiar softness and pliancy.         \"In those persons of a better organized structure, who yield       themselves up to the mesmeric degradation, the physical       causes are less operative; but the moral causes are still       more influential. In all cases the prostration is       self-induced. But in the subjects of whom we have spoken, it       is mainly induced by physical depravity, although moral       frailties concur to bring about the condition. In persons of       a superior type, the condition is mainly due to moral       causes, although physical imbecility has some share in       facilitating the result. These people have much vanity, much       curiosity, and much credulity, together with a _weak_       imagination--that is to say, an imagination which is easily       excited by circumstances which would produce no effect upon       people of stronger imaginative powers. Their vanity shows       itself in the desire _to astonish others_, and get       themselves talked about. They think it rather creditable to       be susceptible subjects. It is a point in their favor! Their       credulity and curiosity take the form of a powerful wish _to       be astonished themselves_. Why should they be excluded from       a land of wonders which others are permitted to enter? The       first step is now taken. They are ready for the sacrifice,       which various motives concur to render agreeable. They       resign themselves passively, mind and body, into the hands       of the manipulator; and by his passes and grimaces, they are       cowed pleasurably, bullied delightfully, into _so much_ of       the condition which their inclinations are bent upon       attaining, as justifies them, they think, in laying claim to       the _whole_ condition, without bringing them under the       imputation of being downright impostors. _Downright_       impostors they unquestionably are not. We believe that their       condition is frequently, though to a very limited extent,       _real_. We must also consider, that, in a matter of this       kind, which is so deeply imbued with the ridiculous, a       mesmeric patient may, and doubtless often does, justify to       his own conscience a considerable deviation from the truth,       on the ground of waggery or hoaxing. Why should an audience,       which has the patience to put up with such spectacles, not       be fooled to the top of its bent?         \"II. How, then, is the miserable nonsense to be disposed of?       It can only be put a stop to by the force of public opinion,       guided of course by reason and truth. Let it be announced       from all authoritative quarters that the magnetic       sensibility is only another name for an unsound condition of       the mental and bodily functions--that it may be always       accepted as an infallible index of the position which an       individual occupies in the scale of humanity--that its       manifestation (when real) invariably betokens a _physique_       and a _morale_ greatly below the average, and a character to       which no respect can be attached. Let this       announcement--which is the undoubted truth--be made by all       respectable organs of public opinion, and by all who are in       any way concerned in the diffusion of knowledge, or in the       instruction of the rising generation, and the magnetic       superstition will rapidly decline. Let this--the correct and       scientific explanation of the phenomena--be understood and       considered carefully by all young people of both sexes, and       the mesmeric ranks will be speedily thinned of their       recruits. Our young friends who may have been entrapped into       this infatuation by want of due consideration, will be wiser       for the future. If they allow themselves to be experimented       upon, they will at any rate take care not to disgrace       themselves by yielding to the follies to which they may be       solicited both from within and from without; and we are much       mistaken if, when they know what the penalty is, they will       abandon themselves to a disgusting condition which is       characteristic only of the most abject specimens of our       species.\"          A STORY WITHOUT A NAME.[1]    WRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MONTHLY MAGAZINE,    BY G. P. R. JAMES, ESQ.      CHAPTER XXXIV.    John Ayliffe, as we may now once more very righteously call him, was  seated in the great hall of the old house of the Hastings family. Very  different indeed was the appearance of that large chamber now from  that which it had presented when Sir Philip Hastings was in  possession. All the old, solid, gloomy-looking furniture, which  formerly had given it an air of baronial dignity, and which Sir Philip  had guarded as preciously as if every antique chair and knotted table  had been an heir-loom, was now removed, and rich flaunting things of  gaudy colors substituted. Damask, and silk, and velvet, and gilt  ornaments in the style of France, were there in abundance, and had it  not been for the arches overhead, and the stone walls and narrow  windows around, the old hall might have passed for the saloon of some  newly-enriched financier of Paris.    The young man sat at table alone--not that he was by any means fond of  solitude, for on the contrary he would have fain filled his house with  company--but for some reason or another, which he could not divine, he  found the old country gentlemen in the neighborhood somewhat shy of  his society. His wealth, his ostentation, his luxury--for he had begun  his new career with tremendous vehemence--had no effect upon them.  They looked upon him as somewhat vulgar, and treated him with mere  cold, supercilious civility as an upstart. There was one gentleman of  good family, indeed, at some distance, who had hung a good deal about  courts, had withered and impoverished himself, and reduced both his  mind and his fortune in place-hunting, and who had a large family of  daughters, to whom the society of John Ayliffe was the more  acceptable, and who not unfrequently rode over and dined with  him--nay, took a bed at the Hall. But that day he had not been over,  and although upon the calculation of chances, one might have augured  two to one John Ayliffe would ultimately marry one of the daughters,  yet at this period he was not very much smitten with any of them, and  was contemplating seriously a visit to London, where he thought his  origin would be unknown, and his wealth would procure him every sort  of enjoyment.    Two servants were in the Hall, handing him the dishes. Well-cooked  viands were on the table, and rich wine. Every thing which John  Ayliffe in his sensual aspirations had anticipated from the possession  of riches was there--except happiness, and that was wanting. To sit  and feed, and feel one's self a scoundrel--to drink deep draughts,  were it of nectar, for the purpose of drowning the thought of our own  baseness--to lie upon the softest bed, and prop the head with the  downiest pillow, with the knowledge that all we possess is the fruit  of crime, can never give happiness--surely not, even to the most  depraved.    That eating and drinking, however, was now one of John Ayliffe's chief  resources--drinking especially. He did not actually get intoxicated  every night before he went to bed, but he always drank to a sufficient  excess to cloud his faculties, to obfuscate his mind. He rather liked  to feel himself in that sort of dizzy state where the outlines of all  objects become indistinct, and thought itself puts on the same hazy  aspect.    The servants had learned his habits already, and were very willing to  humor them; for they derived their own advantage therefrom. Thus, on  the present occasion, as soon as the meal was over, and the dishes  were removed, and the dessert put upon the table--a dessert consisting  principally of sweetmeats, for which he had a great fondness, with  stimulants to thirst. Added to these were two bottles of the most  potent wine in his cellar, with a store of clean glasses, and a jug of  water, destined to stand unmoved in the middle of the table.    After this process it was customary never to disturb him, till, with a  somewhat wavering step, he found his way up to his bedroom. But on the  night of which I am speaking, John Ayliffe had not finished his fourth  glass after dinner, and was in the unhappy stage, which, with some  men, precedes the exhilarating stage of drunkenness, when the butler  ventured to enter with a letter in his hand.    \"I beg pardon for intruding, sir,\" he said, \"but Mr. Cherrydew has  sent up a man on horseback from Hartwell with this letter, because  there is marked upon it, 'to be delivered with the greatest possible  haste.'\"    \"Curse him!\" exclaimed John Ayliffe, \"I wish he would obey the orders  I give him.

And when the       Hungarians were called rebels first, they were called so for       no other reason than this, that they would not be slaves_.\"    It is from his _Letters on History_, and occurs where he has been  speaking of the hostility of foreign powers to Austria.           *       *       *       *       *    A PENNY MAGAZINE, in the Bengalese language, is to be established in  Calcutta, under the editorship of Baboo Rajendralal Mittra, the  librarian of the Asiatic Society. It is to be illustrated by  electrotypes executed in England, of woodcuts which have already  appeared in the _Penny Magazine_, the _Saturday Magazine_, and the  _Illustrated News_.           *       *       *       *       *    A NATIVE of India has translated the tragedy of _Othello_ into  Bengalee Othello's cognomen in the Oriental version is Moor Bahadoor  (General Moor).           *       *       *       *       *    IN ITALY, at Turin and Florence, a great number of valuable works have  been issued, illustrative of the recent revolutions. They do not claim  to be histories, for history is impossible, while events are  contemporary and cannot be contemplated from a universal point of  principle and analysis. But these volumes are what the French with  their happy facility would call studies for history. They are the  material from which the great historic artists must compose their  pictures--they are the diary of the movement--they follow all the  changes of the time, hopeful or despondent, with the fidelity and  closeness of an Indian upon the trail. We have seen several of these  publications, and hope ere many months to see a treatise upon the  republican movement in Europe from a pen well able to sketch it, and  which is fed by ink which is never for a moment red.    The largest and most important of these works is that of M. Gualterio,  just published in Florence, which comprises several letters of the  Austrian lackey, Francis IV., Duke of Modenas, and throws light upon  many of the darkest passages of the dark Austria-Italico policy. Among  other letters, also, one of the most remarkable is that of the  Cardinal Gonsalvi, well known as the able and humane Prime Minister of  Pius VII., and to whose memory there is now upon the walls of St.  Peter's a monument by Thorwaldsen, of which a statue of the Cardinal  is part. This letter speaks of the miserable conduct of the political  trials, and \"justice,\" he says, \"charity, the most ordinary decency  demands that all humanity shall not be so trampled under foot. What  will the English and French journals say--not the Austrian, when they  learn of this massacre of the innocents.\" This was thirty years ago.  But at this moment, were there an able and humane minister at the  Vatican, how truly might he repeat Gonsalvi's words!    It is in works like these, and in the journals and pamphlets published  during the intensity of the struggle, that the still-surviving Italian  genius, which it has been so long the northern policy to smother and  repress, betrayed itself. Nor among these works, as striking another  key, ought we to omit the Souvenirs of the War of Lombardy by M. de  Talleyrand-Perigord. Duke of Dino--and the history of the Revolution  of Rome by Alphonse Balleydier. The Souvenirs are devoted to the glory  of the unhappy King Charles Albert, the dupe of his own vanity and the  victim of his own weakness.    Upon the pages of M. le Duc de Dino, however, he blazes very  brilliantly as a martyr--martyr of a cause hopeless even in the first  flush of success--martyr of an army without enthusiasm, of a  liberalism without freedom or heroism. The English royalists, the  reader will remember, were fond of the same title for the unhappy  Charles I.    In M. Balleydier's history of the Roman revolution, Rossi is the  central figure, in whose fate there was something extremely heroic,  because he had received information, just as he quitted the Pope's  palace to go to the assembly, from a priest who had heard it in  confidence, that he was to be attacked, and he must have known the  Italian, and especially the Roman character, sufficiently to have felt  assured of his fate. After hearing the priest, Rossi said to him  calmly: \"I thank you, Monseigneur, the cause of the Pope is the cause  of God,\" and stepping into his carriage drove to the palace of the  Cancelleria, at whose door he fell dead, by a stroke that wounded much  more mortally the cause which condemned him, than the cause he  espoused.           *       *       *       *       *    With all our waste of money, and continual boasts of encouraging  individual merit, we have not yet a single pension in this country  except to homicides. \"They manage these things better in France.\" A  return just published in the official _Moniteur_, shows that one  department of the government, that of Public Instruction, distributes  the following pensions to literary persons: five of from $400 to $480  a year; nine of $300 to $360; twenty-nine of $200 to $240; thirty-four  of $120 to $180; and fifteen of $40 to $100. To the widows and  families of deceased authors, two of $400 to $450; six of $300 to  $360; seventeen of $200 to $240; twenty-five of $120 to $180; and  thirty-one of $40 to $100. In addition to this, it may be mentioned,  that the same department distributes a large sum annually, under the  title of \"Encouragements,\" to authors in temporary distress, or  engaged in works of literary importance and but small pecuniary  profit. It also awards several thousands to learned societies, for  literary and scientific missions, purchases of books, &c. The  department of the Interior gives $2,500 a year in subscriptions to  different works, and nearly $30,000 for \"indemnities and assistance to  authors.\" The other departments of the government also employ  considerable sums in purchasing books, and in otherwise encouraging  literary men. It is said indeed to be no unusual thing for an author,  laboring under temporary inconvenience, to apply for a few hundred,  or, in some cases, thousand francs, and they are almost always  awarded. No shame whatever is attached to the application, and no very  extraordinary credit to the gift. Surely, France must be a Paradise  for authors.           *       *       *       *       *    A BOOKSELLER in Paris announces: \"Reflections upon my conversations  with the Duke de la Vauguyon, by Louis-Augustus Dauphin, (Louis XVI.,)  accompanied by a fac simile of the MS., and with an introduction by M.  FALLOUX, formerly Minister of Public Instruction.\" Falloux is a  churchman of the stamp of Montalembert. We are apt to doubt the  genuineness of these luckily discovered MSS. of eminent persons. We  have no more faith in this case than we had in that of the Napoleon  novels, mentioned in the last _International_.           *       *       *       *       *    The late M. De BALZAC, who, besides being one of the cleverest writers  of the age, was a brilliant man of society, and a very notorious  _roue_, left, it appears, voluminous memoirs, to be printed without  erasure or addition, and his friends are much alarmed by the prospect  of their appearance. It is said that his custom of extorting letters  from his friends upon any subject at issue, under pretence of  possessing an imperfect memory, and his method of classing them, will  render his memoirs one of the completest scandalous _tableaux_ of the  nineteenth century that could ever be presented to the contemplation  of another age. Opposition to the publication has already been  offered, but without success, and the princess-widow is busily engaged  with the preparations for printing, intending to have the memoirs  before the world early in June. They extend minutely over more than  twenty years.           *       *       *       *       *    M. E. QUINET, who was long associated with Michelet, in the College of  France, and who is known as a writer by his _Alemagne et Italie,  Ultramontanisme, Vacances en Espagne_, etc. has published in Paris  _L'Enseignement du Peuple_. \"On the 24th day of February, 1848,\" he  says, \"a social miracle places in the hands of France the control of  its destiny. France, openly consulted, replies by taking up a position  in the scale of nations between Portugal and Naples. There must be a  cause of this voluntary servitude; the object of these pages is to  discover this cause, and, if possible, to protect futurity against the  effects of its operation.\" This is the problem he proposes to solve,  and he concludes that the important secret is in the fact, that the  \"national religion is in direct contradiction with the national  revolution.\" \"Chained by the circumstance of its religion to the  middle ages, France believes that it can march onward to the end of a  career opened to it solely because of its protest against every great  principle of government which those ages held sacred.\" He has worked  ten years, he tells us, to demonstrate two things: The first, that  catholic states are all perishing; the second, that no political  liberty can be realized in those states. \"I have shown,\" he continues,  \"Italy the slave of all Europe, Spain a slave within, Portugal a slave  within and without, Ireland a slave to England, Poland a slave to  Russia, Bohemia, Hungary, slaves of Austria--Austria herself, the  mother of all slavery, a slave to Russia. Looking for similar proofs  out of Europe, I have shown in America, on the one hand, the  increasing greatness of the heretical United States; on the other  hand, the slavery of the catholic democracies and monarchies of the  south: _in the former a_ WASHINGTON, _in the second a_ ROSAS.\" M.  Quinet considers that the only remedy applicable to an evil of this  magnitude is the utter separation of church and state. Leave but the  slightest connection between the two, and the former will inevitably "]]]
