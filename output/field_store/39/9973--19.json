Perhaps even more so than Comrade  Wotherspoon. He was handicapped to some extent, however, by not having  a palate. This gave to his profoundest thoughts a certain weirdness, as  if they had been uttered in an unknown tongue. The crowd was thickest  round his platform. The grown-up section plainly regarded him as a  comedian, pure and simple, and roared with happy laughter when he urged  them to march upon Park Lane and loot the same without mercy or  scruple. The children were more doubtful. Several had broken down, and  been led away in tears.    When Mr Waller got up to speak on platform number three, his audience  consisted at first only of Psmith, Mike, and a fox-terrier. Gradually  however, he attracted others. After wavering for a while, the crowd  finally decided that he was worth hearing. He had a method of his own.  Lacking the natural gifts which marked Comrade Prebble out as an  entertainer, he made up for this by his activity. Where his colleagues  stood comparatively still, Mr Waller behaved with the vivacity  generally supposed to belong only to peas on shovels and cats on hot  bricks. He crouched to denounce the House of Lords. He bounded from  side to side while dissecting the methods of the plutocrats. During an  impassioned onslaught on the monarchical system he stood on one leg and  hopped. This was more the sort of thing the crowd had come to see.  Comrade Wotherspoon found himself deserted, and even Comrade Prebble's  shortcomings in the way of palate were insufficient to keep his flock  together. The entire strength of the audience gathered in front of the  third platform.    Mike, separated from Psmith by the movement of the crowd, listened with  a growing depression. That feeling which attacks a sensitive person  sometimes at the theatre when somebody is making himself ridiculous on  the stage--the illogical feeling that it is he and not the actor who is  floundering--had come over him in a wave. He liked Mr Waller, and it  made his gorge rise to see him exposing himself to the jeers of a  crowd. The fact that Mr Waller himself did not know that they were  jeers, but mistook them for applause, made it no better. Mike felt  vaguely furious.    His indignation began to take a more personal shape when the speaker,  branching off from the main subject of Socialism, began to touch on  temperance. There was no particular reason why Mr Waller should have  introduced the subject of temperance, except that he happened to be an  enthusiast. He linked it on to his remarks on Socialism by attributing  the lethargy of the masses to their fondness for alcohol; and the  crowd, which had been inclined rather to pat itself on the back during  the assaults on Rank and Property, finding itself assailed in its turn,  resented it. They were there to listen to speakers telling them that  they were the finest fellows on earth, not pointing out their little  failings to them. The feeling of the meeting became hostile. The jeers  grew more frequent and less good-tempered.    'Comrade Waller means well,' said a voice in Mike's ear, 'but if he  shoots it at them like this much more there'll be a bit of an  imbroglio.'    'Look here, Smith,' said Mike quickly, 'can't we stop him? These chaps  are getting fed up, and they look bargees enough to do anything.  They'll be going for him or something soon.'    'How can we switch off the flow? I don't see. The man is wound up. He  means to get it off his chest if it snows. I feel we are by way of  being in the soup once more, Comrade Jackson. We can only sit tight and  look on.'    The crowd was becoming more threatening every minute. A group of young  men of the loafer class who stood near Mike were especially fertile in  comment. Psmith's eyes were on the speaker; but Mike was watching this  group closely. Suddenly he saw one of them, a thick-set youth wearing a  cloth cap and no collar, stoop.    When he rose again there was a stone in his hand.    The sight acted on Mike like a spur. Vague rage against nobody in  particular had been simmering in him for half an hour. Now it  concentrated itself on the cloth-capped one.    Mr Waller paused momentarily before renewing his harangue. The man in  the cloth cap raised his hand. There was a swirl in the crowd, and the  first thing that Psmith saw as he turned was Mike seizing the would-be  marksman round the neck and hurling him to the ground, after the manner  of a forward at football tackling an opponent during a line-out from  touch.    There is one thing which will always distract the attention of a crowd  from any speaker, and that is a dispute between two of its units. Mr  Waller's views on temperance were forgotten in an instant. The audience  surged round Mike and his opponent.    The latter had scrambled to his feet now, and was looking round for his  assailant.    'That's 'im, Bill!' cried eager voices, indicating Mike.    ''E's the bloke wot 'it yer, Bill,' said others, more precise in  detail.    Bill advanced on Mike in a sidelong, crab-like manner.    ''Oo're you, I should like to know?' said Bill.    Mike, rightly holding that this was merely a rhetorical question and  that Bill had no real thirst for information as to his family history,  made no reply. Or, rather, the reply he made was not verbal. He waited  till his questioner was within range, and then hit him in the eye. A  reply far more satisfactory, if not to Bill himself, at any rate to the  interested onlookers, than any flow of words.    A contented sigh went up from the crowd. Their Sunday afternoon was  going to be spent just as they considered Sunday afternoons should be  spent.    'Give us your coat,' said Psmith briskly, 'and try and get it over  quick. Don't go in for any fancy sparring. Switch it on, all you know,  from the start. I'll keep a thoughtful eye open to see that none of his  friends and relations join in.'    Outwardly Psmith was unruffled, but inwardly he was not feeling so  composed. An ordinary turn-up before an impartial crowd which could be  relied upon to preserve the etiquette of these matters was one thing.  As regards the actual little dispute with the cloth-capped Bill, he  felt that he could rely on Mike to handle it satisfactorily. But there  was no knowing how long the crowd would be content to remain mere  spectators. There was no doubt which way its sympathies lay. Bill, now  stripped of his coat and sketching out in a hoarse voice a scenario of  what he intended to do--knocking Mike down and stamping him into the  mud was one of the milder feats he promised to perform for the  entertainment of an indulgent audience--was plainly the popular  favourite.    Psmith, though he did not show it, was more than a little apprehensive.    Mike, having more to occupy his mind in the immediate present, was not  anxious concerning the future. He had the great advantage over Psmith  of having lost his temper. Psmith could look on the situation as a  whole, and count the risks and possibilities. Mike could only see Bill  shuffling towards him with his head down and shoulders bunched.    'Gow it, Bill!' said someone.    'Pliy up, the Arsenal!' urged a voice on the outskirts of the crowd.    A chorus of encouragement from kind friends in front: 'Step up, Bill!'    And Bill stepped.          16. Further Developments      Bill (surname unknown) was not one of your ultra-scientific fighters.  He did not favour the American crouch and the artistic feint. He had a  style wholly his own. It seemed to have been modelled partly on a  tortoise and partly on a windmill. His head he appeared to be trying to  conceal between his shoulders, and he whirled his arms alternately in  circular sweeps.    Mike, on the other hand, stood upright and hit straight, with the  result that he hurt his knuckles very much on his opponent's skull,  without seeming to disturb the latter to any great extent. In the  process he received one of the windmill swings on the left ear. The  crowd, strong pro-Billites, raised a cheer.    This maddened Mike. He assumed the offensive. Bill, satisfied for the  moment with his success, had stepped back, and was indulging in some  fancy sparring, when Mike sprang upon him like a panther. They  clinched, and Mike, who had got the under grip, hurled Bill forcibly  against a stout man who looked like a publican. The two fell in a heap,  Bill underneath.    At the same time Bill's friends joined in.    The first intimation Mike had of this was a violent blow across the  shoulders with a walking-stick. Even if he had been wearing his  overcoat, the blow would have hurt. As he was in his jacket it hurt  more than anything he had ever experienced in his life. He leapt up  with a yell, but Psmith was there before him. Mike saw his assailant  lift the stick again, and then collapse as the old Etonian's right took  him under the chin.    He darted to Psmith's side.    'This is no place for us,' observed the latter sadly. 'Shift ho, I  think. Come on.'    They dashed simultaneously for the spot where the crowd was thinnest.  The ring which had formed round Mike and Bill had broken up as the  result of the intervention of Bill's allies, and at the spot for which  they ran only two men were standing. And these had apparently made up  their minds that neutrality was the best policy, for they made no  movement to stop them. Psmith and Mike charged through the gap, and  raced for the road.    The suddenness of the move gave them just the start they needed. Mike  looked over his shoulder. The crowd, to a man, seemed to be following.  Bill, excavated from beneath the publican, led the field. Lying a good  second came a band of three, and after them the rest in a bunch.    They reached the road in this order.    Some fifty yards down the road was a stationary tram. In the ordinary  course of things it would probably have moved on"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6762"],[0,"Politics: A Treatise on Government (#16)"],[1,"allotted to the gods, the  exigencies of the state, and these public meals; so that all the men,  women, and children were maintained from a common stock. The legislator  gave great attention to encourage a habit of eating sparingly, as very  useful to the citizens. He also endeavoured, that his community might  not be too populous, to lessen the connection with women, by introducing  the love of boys: whether in this he did well or ill we shall have some  other opportunity of considering. But that the public meals were better  ordered at Crete than at Lacedaemon is very evident.    The institution of the _kosmoi_, was still worse than that of the  ephori: for it contained all the faults incident to that magistracy and  some peculiar to itself; for in both cases it is uncertain who will be  elected: but the Lacedaemonians have this advantage which the others  have not, that as all are eligible, the whole community have a share  in the highest honours, and therefore all desire to preserve the state:  whereas among the Cretans the _kosmoi_ are not chosen out of the people  in general, but out of some certain families, and the senate out of the  _kosmoi_. And the same observations which may be made on the senate at  Lacedaemon may be applied to these; for their being under no control,  and their continuing for life, is an honour greater than they merit; and  to have their proceedings not regulated by a written law, but left to  their own discretion, is dangerous. (As to there being no insurrections,  although the people share not in the management of public affairs, this  is no proof of a well-constituted government, as the _kosmoi_ have no  opportunity of being bribed like the ephori, as they live in an [1272b]  island far from those who would corrupt them.) But the method they take  to correct that fault is absurd, impolitic, and tyrannical: for very  often either their fellow-magistrates or some private persons conspire  together and turn out the _kosmoi_. They are also permitted to resign  their office before their time is elapsed, and if all this was done by  law it would be well, and not at the pleasure of the individuals, which  is a bad rule to follow. But what is worst of all is, that general  confusion which those who are in power introduce to impede the ordinary  course of justice; which sufficiently shows what is the nature of the  government, or rather lawless force: for it is usual with the principal  persons amongst them to collect together some of the common people and  their friends, and then revolt and set up for themselves, and come  to blows with each other. And what is the difference, if a state is  dissolved at once by such violent means, or if it gradually so alters in  process of time as to be no longer the same constitution? A state like  this would ever be exposed to the invasions of those who were powerful  and inclined to attack it; but, as has been already mentioned, its  situation preserves it, as it is free from the inroads of foreigners;  and for this reason the family slaves still remain quiet at Crete, while  the Helots are perpetually revolting: for the Cretans take no part in  foreign affairs, and it is but lately that any foreign troops have  made an attack upon the island; and their ravages soon proved the  ineffectualness of their laws. And thus much for the government of  Crete.          CHAPTER XI      The government of Carthage seems well established, and in many respects  superior to others; in some particulars it bears a near resemblance  to the Lacedaemonians; and indeed these three states, the Cretans, the  Lacedaemonians and the Carthaginians are in some things very like  each other, in others they differ greatly. Amongst many excellent  constitutions this may show how well their government is framed, that  although the people are admitted to a share in the administration, the  form of it remains unaltered, without any popular insurrections, worth  notice, on the one hand, or degenerating into a tyranny on the  other. Now the Carthaginians have these things in common with the  Lacedaemonians: public tables for those who are connected together by  the tie of mutual friendship, after the manner of their Phiditia; they  have also a magistracy, consisting of an hundred and four persons,  similar to the ephori, or rather selected with more judgment; for  amongst the Lacedaemonians, all the citizens are eligible, but amongst  the Carthaginians, they are chosen out of those of the better sort:  there is also some analogy between the king and the senate in both these  governments, though the Carthaginian method of appointing their kings  is best, for they do not confine themselves to one family; nor do  they permit the election to be at large, nor have they any regard to  seniority; for if amongst the candidates there are any of greater merit  than the rest, these they prefer to those who may be older; for as their  power is very extensive, if they are [1273a] persons of no account,  they may be very hurtful to the state, as they have always been to  the Lacedaemonians; also the greater part of those things which become  reprehensible by their excess are common to all those governments which  we have described.    Now of those principles on which the Carthaginians have established  their mixed form of government, composed of an aristocracy and  democracy, some incline to produce a democracy, others an oligarchy: for  instance, if the kings and the senate are unanimous upon any point in  debate, they can choose whether they will bring it before the people or  no; but if they disagree, it is to these they must appeal, who are not  only to hear what has been approved of by the senate, but are finally  to determine upon it; and whosoever chooses it, has a right to speak  against any matter whatsoever that may be proposed, which is not  permitted in other cases. The five, who elect each other, have very  great and extensive powers; and these choose the hundred, who are  magistrates of the highest rank: their power also continues longer than  any other magistrates, for it commences before they come into office,  and is prolonged after they are out of it; and in this particular the  state inclines to an oligarchy: but as they are not elected by lot, but  by suffrage, and are not permitted to take money, they are the greatest  supporters imaginable of an aristocracy.    The determining all causes by the same magistrates, and not orae in one  court and another in another, as at Lacedaemon, has the same influence.  The constitution of Carthage is now shifting from an aristocracy to an  oligarchy, in consequence of an opinion which is favourably entertained  by many, who think that the magistrates in the community ought not to  be persons of family only, but of fortune also; as it is impossible  for those who are in bad circumstances to support the dignity of their  office, or to be at leisure to apply to public business. As choosing men  of fortune to be magistrates make a state incline to an oligarchy,  and men of abilities to an aristocracy, so is there a third method of  proceeding which took place in the polity of Carthage; for they have  an eye to these two particulars when they elect their officers,  particularly those of the highest rank, their kings and their generals.  It must be admitted, that it was a great fault in their legislator not  to guard against the constitution's degenerating from an aristocracy;  for this is a most necessary thing to provide for at first, that those  citizens who have the best abilities should never be obliged to do  anything unworthy their character, but be always at leisure to serve the  public, not only when in office, but also when private persons; for if  once you are obliged to look among the wealthy, that you may have men at  leisure to serve you, your greatest offices, of king and general,  will soon become venal; in consequence of which, riches will be more  honourable than virtue and a love of money be the ruling principle in  the city-for what those who have the chief power regard as honourable  will necessarily be the object which the [1273b] citizens in general  will aim at; and where the first honours are not paid to virtue,  there the aristocratic form of government cannot flourish: for it  is reasonable to conclude, that those who bought their places should  generally make an advantage of what they laid out their money for; as  it is absurd to suppose, that if a man of probity who is poor should be  desirous of gaining something, a bad man should not endeavour to do the  same, especially to reimburse himself; for which reason the magistracy  should be formed of those who are most able to support an aristocracy.  It would have been better for the legislature to have passed over the  poverty of men of merit, and only to have taken care to have ensured  them sufficient leisure, when in office, to attend to public affairs.    It seems also improper, that one person should execute several offices,  which was approved of at Carthage; for one business is best done by one  person; and it is the duty of the legislator to look to this, and not  make the same person a musician and a shoemaker: so that where the state  is not small it is more politic and more popular to admit many persons  to have a share in the government; for, as I just now said, it is not  only more usual, but everything is better and sooner done, when one  thing only is allotted to one person: and this is evident both in the  army and navy, where almost every one, in his turn, both commands and  is under command. But as their government inclines to an oligarchy, they  avoid the ill effects of it by always appointing some of the popular  party to the government of cities to make their fortunes. Thus they  consult this fault in their constitution and render it stable; but  this is depending on chance; whereas the legislator ought to frame his  government, that there"]]]
