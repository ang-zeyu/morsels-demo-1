And it shall come  to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be  destroyed from among the people.--Acts 3: 22, 23.    10. Relative to the circumstances of the young Prophet's vision on  the 22nd of September, when he was on his way from the field to his  father's house, before his first visit to Cumorah, his mother in her  _History of the Prophet Joseph_ gives the following interesting details  which the prophet does not record. It would seem, according to Lucy  Smith's statement, that during the interviews with the angel Moroni the  night before--September 21, 1823--the young Prophet had been instructed  to inform his father of what he had seen and heard; but this Joseph  failed to do. \"The next day,\" says Lucy Smith's account, \"my husband,  Alvin, and Joseph, were reaping together in the field, and as they  were reaping Joseph stopped quite suddenly, and seemed to be in a deep  study. Alvin [this was an elder brother--died a little more than a year  later], observing it, hurried him, saying, 'We must not slacken our  hands, or we will not be able to complete our task.' Upon this Joseph  went to work again, and after laboring a short time, he stopped just as  he had done before. This being quite unusual and strange, it attracted  the attention of his father, upon which he discovered that Joseph was  very pale. My husband, supposing that he was sick, told him to go to  the house, and have his mother doctor him. He accordingly ceased his  work, and started; but on coming to a beautiful green, under an apple  tree, he stopped and laid down, for he was so weak he could proceed no  further. He was there but a short time, when the messenger whom he saw  the previous night, visited him again, and the first thing he said was,  'Why did you not tell your father that which I commanded you to tell  him?\" Joseph replied, 'I was afraid my father would not believe me.'  The angel rejoined, 'He will believe every word you say to him.'    Joseph then promised the angel that he would do as he had been  commanded. Upon this the messenger departed, and Joseph returned to the  field where he had left my husband and Alvin; but when he got there his  father had just gone to the house, as he was somewhat unwell. Joseph  then desired Alvin to go straightway and see his father, and inform  him that he had something of great importance to communicate to him,  and that he wanted him to come out into the field where they were at  work. Alvin did as he was requested, and when my husband got there,  Joseph related to him all that had passed between him and the angel the  previous night and that morning. Having heard this account, his father  charged him not to fail in attending strictly to the instructions which  he had received from this heavenly messenger.\" (_History of the Prophet  Joseph_, by his mother, chap. 19.)    11. Lucy Smith has a very interesting account in her _History of the  Prophet_ concerning his report of this interview at Cumorah with  Moroni, she says:    \"The ensuing evening, when the family were all together, Joseph made  known to them all that he had communicated to his father in the field,  and also of his finding the record, as well as what passed between  him and the angel while he was at the place where the plates were  deposited. Sitting up late that evening in order to converse upon these  things, together with overexertion of mind, had much fatigued Joseph;  and when Alvin observed it, he said, 'Now, brother, let us go to bed,  and rise early in the morning in order to finish our day's work at an  hour before sunset, then if mother will get our supper early, we will  have a fine long evening, and we will all sit down for the purpose  of listening to you while you tell us the great things which God has  revealed to you.' Accordingly, by sunset the next day (Sept. 23rd), we  were all seated, and Joseph commenced telling us the great and glorious  things which God had manifested unto him; but before proceeding he  charged us not to mention out of the family that which he was about  to say unto us, as the world was so wicked that when they came to a  knowledge of these things they would try to take our lives; and that  when he should obtain the plates, our names would be cast out as evil  by all people. Hence the necessity of suppressing these things as much  as possible, until the time should come for them to go forth to the  world. After giving us this charge, he proceeded to relate further  particulars concerning the work which he was appointed to do, and we  received them joyfully, never mentioning them except among ourselves,  agreeable to the instructions which we had received from him.\"  (_History of the Prophet Joseph_, by his mother, chap. 19.)    12. In relation to the matter of the Prophet Joseph obtaining the  Nephite record on the morning of the 22nd of September, 1827, his  mother gives a number of interesting details in her _History of the  Prophet_. It appears that both Joseph Knight of Broome county, New  York, and also a Mr. Josiah Stoal were present at the Smith homestead  on the night of September the 21st, 1827. And now Lucy Smith:    \"On the night of the 21st, I sat up very late as my work rather pressed  upon my hands. I did not retire until 12 o'clock at night. About 12  o'clock, Joseph came to me, and asked me if I had a chest with a lock  and key. I knew in an instant what he wanted it for, and not having  one, I was greatly alarmed, as I thought it might be a matter of  considerable moment. But Joseph discovering my anxiety, said, 'Never  mind, mother, I can do very well for the present without it--be  calm--all is right.' Shortly after this Joseph's wife passed through  the room with her bonnet and riding dress and in a few minutes they  left together taking Mr. Knight's horse and wagon. I spent the night in  prayer and supplication to God, for the anxiety of my mind would not  permit me to sleep. At the usual hour, I commenced preparing breakfast,  my heart fluttered at every footstep, as I now expected Joseph and  Emma momentarily, and feared lest Joseph might meet with another  disappointment.    \"When the male portion of the family were seated at breakfast table,  Mr. Smith inquired for Joseph, for he was not aware that he had left  home. I requested my husband not to call him, for I would like to  have him take breakfast with his wife that morning. 'No, no,' said my  husband, 'I must have Joseph eat with me.' 'Well now, Mr. Smith,' I  continued, 'do let him eat with his wife this morning; he almost always  takes breakfast with you.' His father finally consented and ate without  him, and no further inquiries were made concerning his absence, but in  a few minutes Mr. Knight came in quite disturbed. 'Why, Mr. Smith,' he  exclaimed, 'my horse is gone, and I can't find him on the premises, and  I wish to start for home in half an hour.' 'Never mind the horse,' said  I, 'Mr. Knight does not know all the nooks and corners in the pastures;  I will call William, he will bring the horse immediately.'    \"This satisfied him for the time being; but he soon made another  discovery. His wagon also was gone. He then concluded that a rogue  had stolen them both. 'Mr. Knight,' said I, 'do be quiet; I would  be ashamed to have you go about waiting upon yourself--just go out  and talk to Mr. Smith until William comes, and if you really must  go home your horse shall be brought and you shall be waited upon  like a gentleman.' He accordingly went out and while he was absent  Joseph returned. I trembled so with fear, lest all might be lost in  consequence of some failure in keeping the commandments of God, that  I was under the necessity of leaving the room in order to conceal my  feelings. Joseph saw this, and said, 'Do not be uneasy, mother, all is  right, see here, I have got a key.' I knew not what he meant but took  the article of which he spoke into my hands, and examined it. He took  it again and left me, but said nothing respecting the record. * * *  That of which I spoke, which Joseph termed a key, was indeed nothing  more nor less than the Urim and Thummim.\" (_History of the Prophet  Joseph_, by Lucy Smith, chap. 23.)    13.

It will be observed by the reader that in the reported interview  between Joseph Smith and Moroni, as given by Oliver Cowdery above,  there are a number of very remarkable predictions both concerning  Joseph Smith and the work he is bringing forth, all of which are  considered in vol. I of this work, chapter 20.    15. P. 56.    16. Joseph Smith, see _ante_.        CHAPTER V.    THE TRANSLATION OF THE RECORD.--MARTIN HARRIS AS AMANUENSIS.    Following the account of how Joseph Smith obtained the Book of Mormon  it should be known how he translated it, and what difficulties attended  that work. I would remind the reader, in passing, that I am to deal  with a remarkable narrative, one in which strange things occur, and one  in which many who deny or doubt the power of God will be inclined to  have little faith. To such I would say, judge nothing hastily, dismiss  nothing petulantly, patient investigation, and sometimes suspension of  judgment in relation to matters difficult of belief are necessary to  the ascertainment of truth, and in such manner wise men, anxious to  know the truth, proceed.    The Prophet, in his narrative, quoted in the preceding chapter, tells  us that he soon found out the reason why he had received such a strict  injunction to carefully guard the Nephite record and the Urim and  Thummim; and why it was that Moroni has said that after he (Joseph)  had done what was required at his hands, he (Moroni) would call for  them. \"For no sooner was it known,\" says Joseph, \"that I had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4732"],[0,"Prolegomena to the History of Israel (#16)"],[1,"  Hence the  glorification of the tabernacle,\" &c. &c.  *************************************    he for the moment forgets that there underlies this creation the very  real idea of unity  of worship, for the sake of which it would  surely have been very welcome, to the Deuteronomist, for example,  even as a mere idea.  It is only the embodiment of the tabernacle  that is fancy; the idea of it springs from the ground of history,  and it is by its idea that it is to be apprehended.  And when  Noldeke finally  urges in this connection as a plea for the  priority of the Priestly Code that, in spite of the limitation of  sacrifice to a single locality, it nevertheless maintains the old  provision that every act of killing must be a sacrifice, while  Deuteronomy, going a step farther, departs from this, here also his  argument breaks down.    For we read in Leviticus xvii., \"What man soever there be of the house  of Israel that killeth an ox or sheep or goat in the camp, or out  of the camp, and bringeth it not to the door of the tabernacle, to  offer them as an offering unto the Lord before the tabernacle of  the Lord, blood shall be imputed unto that man: he hath shed  blood, and that man shall be cut off from among his people: to the  end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices which  they offer in the open field, even that they may bring them to  the Lord, to the door of the tabernacle, to the priest, and offer  them for peace-offerings unto the Lord....And they shall no more  offer sacrifices unto devils, after whom they have gone a  whoring.\"  The intention of this prescription is simply and solely  to secure the exclusive legitimation of the one lawful place of  sacrifice; it is only for this, obviously, that the profane  slaughtering outside of Jerusalem, which Deuteronomy had  permitted, is forbidden. Plainly  the common man did not quite  understand the newly drawn and previously quite unknown  distinction between the religious and the profane act, and when he  slaughtered at home (as he was entitled to do), he in doing so  still observed, half-unconsciously perhaps, the old sacred  sacrificial ritual.  From this arose the danger of a multiplicity  of altars again furtively creeping in, and such a danger is met,  in an utterly impracticable way indeed, in Leviticus xvii.  And it is  worth noticing how much this law, which, for the rest, is based  upon the Book of Deuteronomy, has grown in the narrowness of its  legitimistic mode of viewing things.  Deuteronomy thoroughly  recognises that offerings, even though offered outside of  Jerusalem, are still offered to Jehovah; for the author of Leviticus  xvii. this is an impossible Idea, and he regards such offerings  simply as made to devils. /1/    *************************************  1. With reference to these rural demons, compare my note in  Vakidi's Maghazi (Berlin, 1882), p. 113.  It is somewhat similar,  though not quite the same thing, when the Moslems say that the old  Arabs dedicated their worship to the Jinns; and other instances  may be compared in which divinities have been degraded to demons.  ************************************    I refuse to believe that any such thing could have been possible  for one who lived before the Deuteronomic reformation, or even  under the old conditions that were in existence immediately  before the exile.    Leviticus xvii., moreover, belongs confessedly to a peculiar little  collection of laws, which has indeed been taken up into the  Priestly Code, but which in many respects disagrees with it, and  particularly in respect of this prohibition of profane  slaughterings.  With reference to the Priestly Code as a whole,  Noldeke's assertion is quite off the mark.  The code, on the  contrary, already allows slaughter without sacrifice in the  precepts of Noah, which are valid not merely for all the world,  but also for the Jews.  Farther on this permission is not  expressly repeated indeed, but it is regarded as a thing of  course.  This alone can account for the fact that the  thank-offering is treated so entirely as a subordinate affair and  the sacrificial meal almost ignored, while in Leviticus vii.22-27  rules are even given for procedure in the slaughter of such animals  as are not sacrificed. /2/    ***********************************  2. That Leviticus vii.22-27 is not a repetition of the old and fuller  regulations about the thank-offering, but an appendix containing  new ones relating to slaughtering, is clear from \"the beast of  which men offer an offering unto the Lord\" (ver. 25), and \"in all  your dwellings\" (ver. z6), as well as from the praxis of Judaism.  **********************************    Here accordingly is another instance of what we have already so often  observed: what is brought forward in Deuteronomy as an innovation  is assumed in the Priestly Code to be an ancient custom dating  as far back as to Noah.  And therefore the latter code is a growth  of the soil that has been prepared by means of the former.        CHAPTER II.  SACRIFICE.      With the Hebrews, as with the whole ancient world, sacrifice  constituted the main part of worship.  The question is whether  their worship did not also in this most important respect pass  through a history the stages of which are reflected in the  Pentateuch.  From the results already reached this must be  regarded at the outset as probable, but the sources of information  accessible to us seem hardly sufficient to enable us actually to  follow the process, or even so much as definitely to fix its two  termini.      II.I.1. The Priestly Code alone occupies itself much with the  subject; it gives a minute classification of the various kinds of  offerings, and a description of the procedure to be followed in the  case of each.  In this way it furnishes also the normative scheme  for modern accounts of the matter, into which all the other casual  notices of the Old Testament on the subject must be made to fit as  best they can.  This point accordingly presents us with an  important feature by which the character of the book can be  determined.  In it the sacrificial ritual is a constituent, and  indeed a very essential element, of the Mosaic legislation: that  ritual is not represented as ancient use handed down to the  Israelites by living practice from ancestral times: it was Moses  who gave them the theory of it--a very elaborate one too--and  he himself received his instruction from God (Exodus xxv. seq.;  Leviticus i. seq.).  An altogether disproportionate emphasis is  accordingly laid upon the technique of sacrifice corresponding to  the theory, alike upon the when, the where, and the by whom, and  also in a very special manner upon the how.  It is from these that  the sacrifice obtains its specific value; one could almost suppose  that even if it were offered to another God, it would by means of  the legitimate rite alone be at once made essentially Jehovistic.  The cultus of Israel is essentially distinguished from all others  by its form, the distinctive and constitutive mark of the holy  community.  With it the theocracy begins and it with the  theocracy; the latter is nothing more than the institution for the  purpose of carrying on the cultus after the manner ordained by  God.  For this reason also the ritual, which appears to concern the  priests only, finds its place in a law-book intended for the whole  community; in order to participate in the life of the theocracy,  all must of course, have clear knowledge of its essential nature,  and in this the theory of sacrifice holds a first place.    The Jehovistic portion of the Pentateuch also knows of no other  kind of divine worship besides the sacrificial, and does not attach  to it less importance than the Priestly Code.  But we do not find  many traces of the view that the sacrificial system of Israel is  distinguished from all others by a special form revealed to Moses,  which makes it the [sic] alone legitimate.   Sacrifice is  sacrifice: when offered to Baal, it is heathenish; when offered  to Jehovah, it is Israelite.  In the Book of the Covenant and in  both Decalogues it is enjoined before everything to serve no other  God besides Jehovah, but also at the proper season to offer  firstlings and gifts to Him.  Negative determinations, for the most  part directed against one heathenish peculiarity or another, occur  but there are no positive ordinances relating to the ritual.  How  one is to set about offering sacrifice is taken for granted as  already known, and nowhere figures as an affair for the  legislation, which, on the contrary, occupies itself with quite  other things.  What the Book of the Covenant and the Decalogue  leave still perhaps doubtful becomes abundantly clear from the  Jehovistic narrative.  The narrative has much more to say about  sacrifice than the incorporated law books, and this may be  regarded as characteristic; in the Priestly Code it is quite the  other way.  But what is specially important is that, according to  the Jehovistic history, the praxis of sacrifice, and that too of  the regular and God-pleasing sort, extends far beyond the Mosaic  legislation, and, strictly speaking, is as old as the world  itself.  A sacrificial feast which the Hebrews wish to celebrate in  the wilderness is the occasion of the Exodus; Moses already  builds an altar at Rephidim (Exodus xvii.), and, still before the  ratification of the covenant on Sinai, a solemn meal in the  presence of Jehovah is set on foot on occasion of Jethro's visit  (Exodus xviii.).  But the custom is much older still; it was  known and practiced by Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.  Noah, the  father of all mankind, built the first altar after the Flood, and  long before him Cain and Abel sacrificed in the same way as was  usual in Palestine thousands of years afterwards.  Balaam the  Aramaean understands just as well as any Israelite how to offer  sacrifices to Jehovah that do not fail of"]]]
