Yet who shall say that you had a better right  to the partridges than he to the eggs?    If you are so favored, you can but admire the pretty sight of the mother  with her cubs basking in a sunny nook or leading them afield in single  file, a black and white procession.    If by another name the rose would smell as sweet, our old acquaintance  is in far better odor for change of appellation from that so suggestive  of his rank offenses. What beauty of fair faces would be spoiled with  scorn by a hint of the vulgar name which in unadorned truth belongs to  the handsome glossy black muff and boa that keep warm those dainty  fingers and swan-like neck. Yet through the furrier's art and cunning  they undergo a magic transformation into something to be worn with  pride, and the every-day wear of the despised outlaw becomes the prized  apparel of the fair lady.    If unto this humble night wanderer is vouchsafed a life beyond his brief  earthly existence, imagine him in that unhunted, trapless paradise of  uncounted eggs and callow nestlings, grinning a wide derisive smile as  he beholds what fools we mortals be, so fooled by ourselves and one  another.          XXXIII    A CAMP-FIRE RUN WILD      Some wooden tent-pins inclosing a few square yards of ground half  covered with a bed of evergreen twigs, matted but still fresh and  odorous, a litter of paper and powder-smirched rags, empty cans and  boxes, a few sticks of fire wood, a blackened, primitive wooden crane,  with its half-charred supporting crotches, and a smouldering heap of  ashes and dying brands, mark the place of a camp recently deserted.    Coming upon it by chance, one could not help a feeling of loneliness,  something akin to that inspired by the cold hearthstone of an empty  house, or the crumbling foundations of a dwelling long since fallen to  ruin. What days and nights of healthful life have been spent here. What  happy hours, never to return, have been passed here. What jokes have  flashed about, what merry tales have been told, what joyous peals of  laughter rung, where now all is silence. But no one is there to see it.  A crow peers down from a treetop to discover what pickings he may glean,  and a mink steals up from the landing, which bears the keelmarks of  lately departed boats, both distrustful of the old silence which the  place has so suddenly resumed; and a company of jays flit silently  about, wondering that there are no intruders to assail with their  inexhaustible vocabulary.    A puff of wind rustles among the treetops, disturbing the balance of the  crow, then plunges downward and sets aflight a scurry of dry leaves, and  out of the gray ashes uncoils a thread of smoke and spins it off into  the haze of leaves and shadows. The crow flaps in sudden alarm, the mink  takes shelter in his coign of vantage among the driftwood, and the jays  raise a multitudinous clamor of discordant outcry. The dry leaves alight  as if by mischievous guidance of evil purpose upon the dormant embers,  another puff of wind arouses a flame that first tastes them, then licks  them with an eager tongue, then with the next eddying breath scatters  its crumbs of sparks into the verge of the forest. These the rising  breeze fans till it loads itself with a light burden of smoke, shifted  now here, now there, as it is trailed along the forest floor, now  climbing among the branches, then soaring skyward.    Little flames creep along the bodies of fallen trees and fluffy windrows  of dry leaves, toying like panther kittens with their assured prey, and  then, grown hungry with such dainty tasting, the flames upburst in a mad  fury of devouring. They climb swifter than panthers to treetops, falling  back they gnaw savagely at tree roots, till the ancient lords of the  forest reel and topple and fall before the gathering wind, and bear  their destroyer still onward.    The leeward woods are thick with a blinding, stifling smoke, through  which all the wild creatures of the forest flee in terror, whither they  know not--by chance to safety, by equal chance perhaps to a terrible  death in the surging deluge of fire. The billows of flame heave and  dash with a constant insatiate roar, tossing ever onward a red foam of  sparks and casting a jetsam of lurid brands upon the ever-retreating  strand that is but touched with the wash of enkindling, when it is  overrun by the sea of fire.    The ice-cold springs grow hot in its fierce overwhelming wave, the  purling rills hiss and boil and shrink before it, then vanish from their  seared beds. All the living greenness of the forest is utterly  consumed--great trees that have stood like towers, defying the  centuries, with the ephemeral verdure of the woodland undergrowth; and  to mark the place of all this recent majesty and beauty, there is but  smouldering ruin and black and ashen waste. Little farms but lately  uncovered to the sun out of the wilderness, cosy homesteads but newly  builded, are swept away, and with them cherished hopes and perhaps  precious lives. What irreparable devastation has been wrought by the  camp-fire run wild!    Meanwhile the careless begetters of this havoc are making their  leisurely way toward the outer world of civilization, serenely noting  that the woods are on fire, and complacently congratulating themselves  that the disaster did not come to spoil their outing; never once  thinking that by a slight exercise of that care which all men owe the  world, this calamity, which a century cannot repair, might have been  avoided.          XXXIV    THE DEAD CAMP-FIRE      A heap of ashes, a few half-burned brands, a blackened pair of crotched  sticks that mark the place of the once glowing heart of the camp,  furnish food for the imagination to feed upon or give the memory an  elusive taste of departed pleasures.    If you were one of those who saw its living flame and felt its warmth,  the pleasant hours passed here come back with that touch of sadness  which accompanies the memory of all departed pleasures and yet makes it  not unwelcome. What was unpleasant, even what was almost unendurable,  has nearly faded out of remembrance or is recalled with a laugh.    It was ten years ago, and the winds and fallen leaves of as many autumns  have scattered and covered the gray heap. If it was only last year, you  fancy that the smell of fire still lingers in the brands. How vividly  return to you the anxious deliberation with which the site was chosen  with a view to all attainable comfort and convenience, and the final  satisfaction that followed the establishment of this short-lived home,  short-lived but yet so much a home during its existence. Nothing  contributed so much to make it one as the camp-fire. How intently you  watched its first building and lighting, how labored for its maintenance  with awkwardly-wielded axe, how you inhaled the odors of its cookery and  essayed long-planned culinary experiments with extemporized implements,  over its beds of coals, and how you felt the consequent exaltation of  triumph or mortification of failure.    All these come back to you, and the relighting of the fire in the sleepy  dawn, the strange mingling of white sunlight and yellow firelight when  the sun shot its first level rays athwart the camp, the bustle of  departure for the day's sport, the pleasant loneliness of camp-keeping  with only the silent woods, the crackling fire, and your thoughts for  company; the incoming at nightfall and the rekindling of the fire, when  the rosy bud of sleeping embers suddenly expanded into a great blossom  of light whose petals quivered and faded and brightened among the  encircling shadows of the woods. You laugh again at the jokes that ran  around that merry circle and wonder again and again at the ingenuity  with which small performances were magnified into great exploits, little  haps into strange adventure, and with which bad shots and poor catches  were excused.    At last came breaking camp, the desolation of dismantling and  leave-taking. How many of you will ever meet again? How many of those  merry voices are stilled forever, from how many of those happy faces has  the light of life faded?    Who lighted this camp-fire? Years have passed since it illumined the  nightly gloom of the woods, for moss and lichens are creeping over the  charred back-log. A green film is spread over the ashes, and thrifty  sprouts are springing up through them.    You know that the campers were tent-dwellers, for there stand the rows  of rotten tent pins inclosing a rusty heap of mould that once was a  fragrant couch of evergreens inviting tired men to rest,--or you know  they spent their nights in a shanty, for there are the crumbling walls,  the fallen-in roof of bark which never again will echo song or jest.    This pile of fish-bones attests that they were anglers, and skillful or  lucky ones, for the pile is large. If you are an ichthyologist, you can  learn by these vestiges of their sport whether they satisfied the desire  of soul and stomach with the baser or the nobler fishes; perhaps a  rotting pole, breaking with its own weight, may decide whether they  fished with worm or fly; but whether you relegate them to the class of  scientific or unscientific anglers, you doubt not they enjoyed their  sport as much in one way as in the other.    You know that they were riflemen, for there is the record of their shots  in the healing bullet wounds on the trunk of a great beech. For a moment  you may fancy that the woods still echo the laughter that greeted the  shot that just raked the side of the tree; but it is only the cackle of  a yellow-hammer.    There is nothing to tell you who they were, whence they came, or whither  they went; but they were campers, lovers of the great outdoor world, and  so akin to you, and you bid them hail and farewell without a meeting.

General Gatacre emphatically  denied the \"slim\" impeachment. He forwarded affidavits sworn by Major  Lilly, R.A.M.C., who was the last man with the waggon before it had to  be abandoned, who stated that if such ammunition had been found it had  been subsequently deposited there. General Gatacre further informed the  Commandant that the practice of taking wives and children in or near  camp and allowing them to run the risks common to belligerents was  contrary to the rules of civilised warfare, and desired to point out the  responsibility he incurred in so doing. He further remonstrated that a  servant who had been on the field of battle to assist Father Ryan in the  succour of the wounded had been detained in the Boer camp after  assurances of his release had been made. To these remarks and complaints  the General received no reply.    Fortunately, our wounded who were not captured were doing well. The  ladies at Sterkstroom were particularly devoted, and visited and cheered  the sick daily, and carried them little luxuries which were mightily  appreciated. Though there were not many losses, sick and disabled were  constantly being carried into the hospital as the result of  reconnoitring and scouting expeditions, which were ceaseless, and had to  continue ceaseless, owing to the inability of the force to take powerful  action.    [Illustration: MOVEMENTS OF GATACRE AND FRENCH.]    On the 20th of January Lieutenant Nickerson, R.A.M.C., who had  accompanied the wounded after the misfortune at Stormberg, arrived in  camp. Father Ryan's servant, on whose account General Gatacre, as  already mentioned, addressed Commandant Olivier, also returned. They  brought interesting news. More guns had been brought on the scene, and  these were served by German gunners. Septuagenarians and striplings were  drafted into the commandoes, while at Burghersdorp the Town Guard was  composed of lads of about thirteen years of age. This showed that the  stream of reinforcements was beginning to run dry. Many youngsters were  said to have been sent from their college at Bloemfontein straight to  the front.    Commandant Olivier now took the opportunity to announce that he meant to  retain as prisoners all correspondents who might be captured. The  correspondents were flattered, and began to calculate whether  \"Experiences in Pretoria\" would make good \"copy,\" but finally decided  for the liberty of the press.    A little innocent diversion was provided by the Boers during the night  of the 20th. The British were awakened by furious fire, which was  continued for some time. Great consternation prevailed, till it was  afterwards discovered that a scare in the Boer lines had taken place,  and the sound of some stampeding cattle had been mistaken for the  advance of the British! The Boers had at once flown to arms, fired right  and left in the midnight darkness, and as a natural consequence shot  some of their own cattle!    After this, there was silence, like the ominous lull which comes before  a storm. Little puffs and pants of hostility took place around  Sterkstroom and Penhoek, while at Colesberg the Boers were on guard,  with the fear of some impending ill. Important developments were  dreaded. It was known that swarms of troops were moving from the Cape,  and that the positions which had hitherto been held by the Federals in  consequence of the weakness of British forces in all quarters, would  soon be tenable no longer. And the waverers began to shake in their  shoes. They began suddenly to adopt a helpful attitude towards the  forces. The fact was, Lord Roberts had issued a proclamation encouraging  Free Staters and Transvaalers to desert by the promise that they should  be well treated. To the Colonial rebels he had diplomatically tendered  the advice to surrender before being caught in _flagrante delicto_.      WITH GENERAL FRENCH    While all eyes were turned in the direction of the Natal force for the  relief of Ladysmith, General French was making things lively for the  Boers. It may be remembered that he left Ladysmith immediately before  Sir George White's garrison was hemmed in, and betook himself to the  central sphere of war. On the 23rd of November, with a reconnoitring  force consisting of a company of the Black Watch, some mounted infantry,  police, and the New South Wales Lancers, he went by train towards  Arundel, and was fired on by Boers who were sneaking in the hills. Three  of the party were wounded, but the rest drove the enemy off. The rails  had been lifted just in front of the scene of the fight. From this time  activities of the same kind took place daily, the General devoting his  energies to reconnoitring east and west of his position, keeping the  enemy from massing at any given point, and forcing them to remain on the  _qui vive_ in perpetual expectation of attack.    Scouting at this time was carried on to the extent of a fine art. Never  a day was devoid of excitement. \"We start out before dawn, and get  back--well, when we can!\" This was the pithy description of a youngster  who enjoyed some thrilling moments. The following sketch of the  experiences of a New Zealander show how one and all willingly risked  their lives in the service of their country:--    \"I was under fire for the first time on my birthday (Dec. 7), when a  section of us (four men) were sent out as a mark for any Boers to shoot  at. We rode to the foot of a kopje and left one of us in charge of the  four horses. Another chap and I climbed to the top. Puff! bang went  three shells from their Long Tom and a perfect fusillade of bullets. It  is marvellous how we escaped. We were to report as soon as we were fired  at, so I volunteered as galloper to go back to our lines to report. I  did a quick time over that two miles of veldt, bullets missing me all  the time. I reported, and was told to go back and withdraw the men,  which I did. Afterwards we took eight men, and under cover kept up a  steady fire for five hours. I was horribly tired, as I had been in the  saddle eighteen hours the previous day. My mate was fresh--we were  planted behind stones in pairs--and while he kept up the firing I  slumbered, strange as it may seem. There are thousands of troops in the  camp. General French, in command of this particular division, has  complimented us on many occasions on our coolness under fire and our  horsemanship. He said we could gallop across country where English  cavalry could only walk. He told us after a skirmish we had with the  enemy that he couldn't express in words his admiration of us, that we  were the best scouts he had ever employed, and that we always brought in  something, either prisoners, horses, sheep, cattle, or valuable  information--which latter is entirely true. During the slack time our  chaps are busy breaking in remounts for the English cavalry. Horses die  like flies here, and Cape ponies are substituted.\"    Numerous and ingenious tricks were practised on the Boers, many of them  doubtless owing their origin to the active and fertile brains of General  French and Colonel Baden-Powell, the author of the \"Manual on Scouting.\"  One of these was to take in the enemy's scouts by tethering ostriches to  bushes on the hills. The presence of the birds naturally gave to the  place an air of desolation, and satisfied the enemy that the ground was  unoccupied. In Colonel Baden-Powell's opinion fine scouting is a true  bit of hero-work, and his description of the \"sport\" in his own words  serves to show of what stuff our Colonial scouts were made. He says: \"It  is comparatively easy for a man in the heat and excitement of battle,  where every one is striving to be first, to dash out before the rest and  do some gallant deed; but it is another thing for a man to take his life  in his hand to carry out some extra dangerous bit of scouting on his own  account, where there is no one by to applaud, and it might be just as  easy for him to go back; that is a true bit of hero's work, and yet it  is what a scout does continually as 'all in the day's work.' The British  scout has, too, to be good beyond all nationalities in every branch of  his art, because he is called upon not only to act against civilised  enemies in civilised countries like France and Germany, but he has also  to take on the crafty Afghan in his mountains, or the fierce Zulu in the  open South African towns, the Burmese in his forests, the Soudanese on  the Egyptian desert, all requiring different methods of working, but  their efficiency depending in every case on the same factor--the pluck  and ability of the scout himself. To be successful as a scout you must  have plenty of what Americans call 'jump' and 'push,' 'jump' being  alertness, wideawakeness, and readiness to seize your opportunity,  'push' being a never-say-die feeling. When in doubt as to whether to go  on or to go back, think of that and of the Zulu saying, 'If we go  forward we die, if we go backward we die; better go forward and die.'  Scouting is like a game of football. You are selected as a forward  player. Play the game; play that your side may win. Don't think of your  own glorification or your own risks--your side are backing you up.  Football is a good game, but better than it, better than any other game,  is that of man-hunting.\" Of this game, our troops, particularly in the  disaffected regions of Cape Colony, were beginning to have their fill.    On the 8th of December Colonel Porter, with the 5th Dragoon Guards and  Mounted Infantry, arrived at Arundel from Naauwpoort, for the purpose of  making a reconnaissance and locating the enemy and discovering his  strength. The force detrained some four miles outside the town and  advanced across the plain, the Dragoons to left and right, the Mounted  Infantry, consisting of New Zealanders and Australians, in the centre  slightly in the rear. The Boers in the surrounding kopjes, seeing their  danger,"]]]
