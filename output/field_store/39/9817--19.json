This axis will then make an angle with the horizon  equal to the latitude of the place. The telescope cannot, however, be  mounted directly on this axis, but must be attached to a second one,  itself fastened to this one.    [Illustration with caption: SECTION OF THE PRIMITIVE MOUNTING. P P.  Polar axis, bearing a fork at the upper end A. Declination axis passing  through the fork E. Section of telescope tube C. Weight to balance the  tube.]    When mounted in this way, an object can be followed in its diurnal  motion from east to west by turning on the polar axis alone. But if the  greatest facility in use is required, this motion must be performed by  clock-work. A telescope with this appendage will commonly cost one  thousand dollars and upward, so that it is not usually applied to very  small ones.    We will now suppose that the reader wishes to purchase a telescope or  an object-glass for himself, and to be able to judge of its  performance. He must have the object-glass properly adjusted in its  tube, and must use the highest power; that is, the smallest eye-piece,  which he intends to use in the instrument. Of course he understands  that in looking directly at a star or a celestial object it must appear  sharp in outline and well defined. But without long practice with good  instruments, this will not give him a very definite idea. If the person  who selects the telescope is quite unpractised, it is possible that he  can make the best test by ascertaining at what distance he can read  ordinary print. To do this he should have an eye-piece magnifying about  fifty times for each inch of aperture of the telescope. For instance,  if his telescope is three inches clear aperture, then his eye-piece  should magnify one hundred and fifty times; if the aperture is four  inches, one magnifying two hundred times may be used. This magnifying  power is, as a general rule, about the highest that can be  advantageously used with any telescope. Supposing this magnifying power  to be used, this page should be legible at a distance of four feet for  every unit of magnifying power of the telescope. For example, with a  power of 100, it should be legible at a distance of 400 feet; with a  power of 200, at 800 feet, and so on. To put the condition into another  shape: if the telescope will read the print at a distance of 150 feet  for each inch of aperture with the best magnifying power, its  performance is at least not very bad. If the magnifying power is less  than would be given by this rule, the telescope should perform a little  better; for instance, a three-inch telescope with a power of 60 should  make this page legible at a distance of 300 feet, or four feet for each  unit of power.    The test applied by the optician is much more exact, and also more  easy. He points the instrument at a star, or at the reflection of the  sun's rays from a small round piece of glass or a globule of  quicksilver several hundred yards away, and ascertains whether the rays  are all brought to a focus. This is not done by simply looking at the  star, but by alternately pushing the eye-piece in beyond the point of  distinct vision and drawing it out past the point. In this way the  image of the star will appear, not as a point, but as a round disk of  light. If the telescope is perfect, this disk will appear round and of  uniform brightness in either position of the eye-piece. But if there is  any spherical aberration or differences of density in different parts  of the glass, the image will appear distorted in various ways. If the  spherical aberration is not correct, the outer rim of the disk will be  brighter than the centre when the eye-piece is pushed in, and the  centre will be the brighter when it is drawn out. If the curves of the  glass are not even all around, the image will appear oval in one or the  other position. If there are large veins of unequal density, wings or  notches will be seen on the image. If the atmosphere is steady, the  image, when the eye-piece is pushed in, will be formed of a great  number of minute rings of light. If the glass is good, these rings will  be round, unbroken, and equally bright. We present several figures  showing how these spectral images, as they are sometimes called, will  appear; first, when the eye-piece is pushed in, and secondly, when it  is drawn out, with telescopes of different qualities.    We have thus far spoken only of the refracting telescope, because it is  the kind with which an observer would naturally seek to supply himself.  At the same time there is little doubt that the construction of a  reflector of moderate size is easier than that of a corresponding  refractor. The essential part of the reflector is a slightly concave  mirror of any metal which will bear a high polish. This mirror may be  ground and polished in the same way as a lens, only the tool must be  convex.    [Illustration with caption: SPECTRAL IMAGES OF STARS; THE UPPER LINE  SHOWING HOW THEY APPEAR WITH THE EYE-PIECE PUSHED IN, THE LOWER WITH  THE EYE-PIECE DRAWN OUT.    A The telescope is all right B Spherical aberration shown by the light  and dark centre C The objective is not spherical but elliptical D The  glass not uniform--a very bad and incurable case E One side of the  objective nearer than the other. Adjust it]    Of late years it has become very common to make the mirror of glass and  to cover the reflecting face with an exceedingly thin film of silver,  which can be polished by hand in a few minutes. Such a mirror differs  from our ordinary looking-glass in that the coating of silver is put on  the front surface, so that the light does not pass through the glass.  Moreover, the coating of silver is so thin as to be almost transparent:  in fact, the sun may be seen through it by direct vision as a faint  blue object. Silvered glass reflectors made in this way are extensively  manufactured in London, and are far cheaper than refracting telescopes  of corresponding size. Their great drawback is the want of permanence  in the silver film. In the city the film will ordinarily tarnish in a  few months from the sulphurous vapors arising from gaslights and other  sources, and even in the country it is very difficult to preserve the  mirror from the contact of everything that will injure it. In  consequence, the possessor of such a telescope, if he wishes to keep it  in order, must always be prepared to resilver and repolish it. To do  this requires such careful manipulation and management of the chemicals  that it is hardly to be expected that an amateur will take the trouble  to keep his telescope in order, unless he has a taste for chemistry as  well as for astronomy.    The curiosity to see the heavenly bodies through great telescopes is so  wide-spread that we are apt to forget how much can be seen and done  with small ones. The fact is that a large proportion of the  astronomical observations of past times have been made with what we  should now regard as very small instruments, and a good deal of the  solid astronomical work of the present time is done with meridian  circles the apertures of which ordinarily range from four to eight  inches. One of the most conspicuous examples in recent times of how a  moderate-sized instrument may be utilized is afforded by the  discoveries of double stars made by Mr. S. W. Burnham, of Chicago.  Provided with a little six-inch telescope, procured at his own expense  from the Messrs. Clark, he has discovered many hundred double stars so  difficult that they had escaped the scrutiny of Maedler and the  Struves, and gained for himself one of the highest positions among the  astronomers of the day engaged in the observation of these objects. It  was with this little instrument that on Mount Hamilton,  California--afterward the site of the great Lick Observatory--he  discovered forty-eight new double stars, which had remained unnoticed  by all previous observers. First among the objects which show  beautifully through moderate instruments stands the moon. People who  want to see the moon at an observatory generally make the mistake of  looking when the moon is full, and asking to see it through the largest  telescope. Nothing can then be made out but a brilliant blaze of light,  mottled with dark spots, and crossed by irregular bright lines. The  best time to view the moon is near or before the first quarter, or when  she is from three to eight days old. The last quarter is of course  equally favorable, so far as seeing is concerned, only one must be up  after midnight to see her in that position. Seen through a three or  four inch telescope, a day or two before the first quarter, about half  an hour after sunset, and with a magnifying power between fifty and one  hundred, the moon is one of the most beautiful objects in the heavens.  Twilight softens her radiance so that the eye is not dazzled as it will  be when the sky is entirely dark. The general aspect she then presents  is that of a hemisphere of beautiful chased silver carved out in  curious round patterns with a more than human skill. If, however, one  wishes to see the minute details of the lunar surface, in which many of  our astronomers are now so deeply interested, he must use a higher  magnifying power. The general beautiful effect is then lessened, but  more details are seen. Still, it is hardly necessary to seek for a very  large telescope for any investigation of the lunar surface. I very much  doubt whether any one has ever seen anything on the moon which could  not be made out in a clear, steady atmosphere with a six-inch telescope  of the first class.    Next to the moon, Saturn is among the most beautiful of celestial  objects. Its aspect, however, varies with its position in its orbit.

It was only  when he had finished shaving, and was tying his cravat, that he  began to perceive obstacles in his way, and sufficiently big  obstacles, at that.    In the first place, Molly did not love him. And, he was bound to  admit, there was no earthly reason why she ever should. A man in  love is seldom vain about his personal attractions. Also, her father  firmly believed him to be a master-burglar.    \"Otherwise,\" said Jimmy, scowling at his reflection in the glass,  \"everything's splendid.\" He brushed his hair sadly.    There was a furtive rap at the door.    \"Hullo?\" said Jimmy. \"Yes?\"    The door opened slowly. A grin, surmounted by a mop of red hair,  appeared round the edge of it.    \"Hullo, Spike. Come in. What's the matter?\"    The rest of Mr. Mullins entered the room.    \"Gee, boss! I wasn't sure was dis your room. Say, who do you t'ink I  nearly bumped me coco ag'inst out in de corridor downstairs? Why,  old man McEachern, de cop. Dat's right!\"    \"Yes?\"    \"Sure. Say, what's he doin' on dis beat? I pretty near went down an'  out when I seen him. Dat's right. Me breath ain't got back home  yet.\"    \"Did he recognize you?\"    \"Did he! He starts like an actor on top de stoige when he sees he's  up ag'inst de plot to ruin him, an' he gives me de fierce eye.\"    \"Well?\"    \"I was wonderin' was I on Thoid Avenoo, or was I standin' on me  coco, or what was I doin' anyhow. Den I slips off, an' chases meself  up here. Say, boss, what's de game? What's old man McEachern doin'  stunts dis side fer?\"    \"It's all right, Spike. Keep calm. I can explain. He has retired--like  me! He's one of the handsome guests here.\"    \"On your way, boss! What's dat?\"    \"He left the force just after that merry meeting of ours when you  frolicked with the bull-dog. He came over here, and butted into  society. So, here we are again, all gathered together under the same  roof, like a jolly little family party.\"    Spike's open mouth bore witness to his amazement.    \"Den--\" he stammered.    \"Yes?\"    \"Den, what's he goin' to do?\"    \"I couldn't say. I'm expecting to hear shortly. But we needn't worry  ourselves. The next move's with him. If he wants to comment on the  situation, he won't be backward. He'll come and do it.\"    \"Sure. It's up to him,\" agreed Spike.    \"I'm quite comfortable. Speaking for myself, I'm having a good time.  How are you getting along downstairs?\"    \"De limit, boss. Honest, it's to de velvet. Dey's an old gazebo, de  butler, Saunders his name is, dat's de best ever at handin' out long  woids. I sits an' listens. Dey calls me Mr. Mullins down dere,\" said  Spike, with pride.    \"Good. I'm glad you're all right. There's no reason why we shouldn't  have an excellent time here. I don't think that Mr. McEachern will  try to have us turned out, after he's heard one or two little things  I have to say to him--just a few reminiscences of the past which may  interest him. I have the greatest affection for Mr. McEachern--I  wish it were mutual--but nothing he can say is going to make me stir  from here.\"    \"Not on your life,\" agreed Spike. \"Say, boss, he must have got a lot  of plunks to be able to butt in here. An' I know how he got dem,  too. Dat's right. I comes from little old New York, meself.\"    \"Hush, Spike, this is scandal!\"    \"Sure,\" said the Bowery boy doggedly, safely started now on his  favorite subject. \"I knows, an' youse knows, boss. Gee! I wish I'd  bin a cop. But I wasn't tall enough. Dey's de fellers wit' de big  bank-rolls. Look at dis old McEachern. Money to boin a wet dog wit'  he's got, an' never a bit of woik fer it from de start to de finish.  An' look at me, boss.\"    \"I do, Spike, I do.\"    \"Look at me. Gittin' busy all de year round, woikin' to beat de  band--\"    \"In prisons oft,\" said Jimmy.    \"Sure t'ing. An' chased all roun' de town. An' den what? Why, to de  bad at de end of it all. Say, it's enough to make a feller--\"    \"Turn honest,\" said Jimmy. \"That's it, Spike. Reform. You'll be glad  some day.\"    Spike seemed to be doubtful. He was silent for a moment, then, as if  following up a train of thought, he said:    \"Boss, dis is a fine big house.\"    \"I've seen worse.\"    \"Say, couldn't we--?\"    \"Spike!\" said Jimmy, warningly.    \"Well, couldn't we?\" said Spike, doggedly. \"It ain't often youse  butts into a dead-easy proposition like dis one. We shouldn't have  to do a t'ing excep' git busy. De stuff's just lyin' about, boss.\"    \"I shouldn't wonder.\"    \"Aw, it's a waste to leave it.\"    \"Spike,\" said Jimmy, \"I warned you of this. I begged you to be on  your guard, to fight against your professional instincts. Be a man!  Crush them. Try and occupy your mind. Collect butterflies.\"    Spike shuffled in gloomy silence.    \"'Member dose jools youse swiped from de duchess?\" he said,  musingly.    \"The dear duchess!\" murmured Jimmy. \"Ah, me!\"    \"An' de bank youse busted?\"    \"Those were happy days, Spike.\"    \"Gee!\" said the Bowery boy. And then, after a pause: \"Dat was to de  good,\" he said, wistfully.    Jimmy arranged his tie at the mirror.    \"Dere's a loidy here,\" continued Spike, addressing the chest of  drawers, \"dat's got a necklace of jools what's wort' a hundred  t'ousand plunks. Honest, boss. A hundred t'ousand plunks. Saunders  told me dat--de old gazebo dat hands out de long woids. I says to  him, 'Gee!' an' he says, 'Surest t'ing youse know.' A hundred  t'ousand plunks!\"    \"So I understand,\" said Jimmy.    \"Shall I rubber around, an' find out where is dey kept, boss?\"    \"Spike,\" said Jimmy, \"ask me no more. All this is in direct  contravention of our treaty respecting keeping your fingers off the  spoons. You pain me. Desist.\"    \"Sorry, boss. But dey'll be willy-wonders, dem jools. A hundred  t'ousand plunks. Dat's goin' some, ain't it? What's dat dis side?\"    \"Twenty thousand pounds.\"    \"Gee!...Can I help youse wit' de duds, boss?\"    \"No, thanks, Spike, I'm through now. You might just give me a brush  down, though. No, not that. That's a hair-brush. Try the big black  one.\"    \"Dis is a boid of a dude suit,\" observed Spike, pausing in his  labors.    \"Glad you like it, Spike. Rather chic, I think.\"    \"It's de limit. Excuse me. How much did it set youse back, boss?\"    \"Something like seven guineas, I believe. I could look up the bill,  and let you know.\"    \"What's dat--guineas? Is dat more dan a pound?\"    \"A shilling more. Why these higher mathematics?\"    Spike resumed his brushing.    \"What a lot of dude suits youse could git,\" he observed  meditatively, \"if youse had dem jools!\" He became suddenly animated.  He waved the clothes-brush. \"Oh, you boss!\" he cried. \"What's eatin'  youse? Aw, it's a shame not to. Come along, you boss! Say, what's  doin'? Why ain't youse sittin' in at de game? Oh, you boss!\"    Whatever reply Jimmy might have made to this impassioned appeal was  checked by a sudden bang on the door. Almost simultaneously, the  handle turned.    \"Gee!\" cried Spike. \"It's de cop!\"    Jimmy smiled pleasantly.    \"Come in, Mr. McEachern,\" he said, \"come in. Journeys end in lovers  meeting. You know my friend Mr. Mullins, I think? Shut the door, and  sit down, and let's talk of many things.\"          CHAPTER XIV    CHECK AND A COUNTER MOVE      Mr. McEachern stood in the doorway, breathing heavily. As the result  of a long connection with evil-doers, the ex-policeman was somewhat  prone to harbor suspicions of those round about him, and at the  present moment his mind was aflame. Indeed, a more trusting man  might have been excused for feeling a little doubtful as to the  intentions of Jimmy and Spike. When McEachern had heard that Lord  Dreever had brought home a casual London acquaintance, he had  suspected as a possible drawback to the visit the existence of  hidden motives on the part of the unknown. Lord Dreever, he had  felt, was precisely the sort of youth to whom the professional  bunco-steerer would attach himself with shouts of joy. Never, he had  assured himself, had there been a softer proposition than his  lordship since bunco-steering became a profession.  When he found  that the strange visitor was Jimmy Pitt, his suspicions had  increased a thousand-fold.    And when, going to his room to get ready for dinner, he had nearly  run into Spike Mullins in the corridor, his frame of mind had been  that of a man to whom a sudden ray of light reveals the fact that he  is on the brink of a black precipice. Jimmy and Spike had burgled  his house together in New York. And here they were, together again,  at Dreever Castle. To say that the thing struck McEachern as  sinister is to put the matter baldly. There was once a gentleman who  remarked that he smelt a rat, and saw it floating in the air.  Ex-Constable McEachern smelt a regiment of rats, and the air seemed to  him positively congested with them.    His first impulse had been to rush to Jimmy's room there and then;  but he had learned society's lessons well. Though the heavens might  fall, he must not be late for dinner. So, he went and dressed, and  an obstinate tie put the finishing touches to his wrath.    Jimmy regarded him coolly, without moving from, the chair in which  he had seated himself. Spike, on the other hand, seemed embarrassed.  He stood first on one leg, and then on the other, as if he were  testing the respective merits of each, and would make a definite  choice later on.    \"You scoundrels!\" growled McEachern.    Spike, who had been standing for a few moments on his right leg, and  seemed at last to have come to, a decision, hastily changed to the  left, and grinned feebly.    \"Say, youse won't want me any more, boss?\" he whispered.    \"No, you can go, Spike.\"    \"You stay where you are, you red-headed devil!\" said McEachern,  tartly.    \"Run along, Spike,\" said Jimmy.    The Bowery boy looked doubtfully at the huge form of"]]]
