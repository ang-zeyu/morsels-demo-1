Footnote 22: Artists of the fifteenth century.    Other artists of Romagna, belonging to this period, are treated of in the  schools where they chiefly flourished, such as Ingoli of Ravenna, at  Venice, Zaccolini of Cesena at Rome, and Ardente, a native of Faenza, in  Piedmont.                           BOLOGNESE SCHOOL.                         EPOCH III.         _The Caracci, their Scholars, and their Successors, until       the time of Cignani._      To write the history of the Caracci and their followers would in fact be  almost the same as to write the pictoric history of all Italy during the  last two centuries. In our preceding books we have taken a survey of almost  every school; and everywhere, early or late, we have met with either the  Caracci or their pupils, or at least with their successors, employed in  overthrowing the ancient maxims, and introducing new, until we reach the  period when there was no artist who, in some respect or other, might not be  said to belong to their school. Now, as it is grateful to the traveller,  after long following the course of some royal river, to ascend still higher  to its source, so I trust it will, in like manner, prove delightful to my  readers, to be here made acquainted with those principles that conferred  this new style upon the world of art, and in a short time filled with its  specimens, and took the lead of every individual school. What, in my  opinion, too, is still more surprising is, that it should owe its origin to  Lodovico Caracci, a young artist, who appeared of a slow, inactive  intellect in early years, and better adapted to grind colours than to  harmonize and apply them. He was advised, both by Fontana, his master at  Bologna, and by Tintoretto, who directed his studies in Venice, to adopt a  new profession, as quite unqualified for the art of painting; his fellow  pupils likewise bantering him with the epithet of the ox, in allusion to  his extreme dulness and tardiness. Indeed, every thing seemed to conspire  to discourage him; he alone did not despair; from the obstacles he had to  encounter he only gathered courage, and inducements to rouse, not to alarm  himself. For this, his dilatory character, did not spring from confined  genius, but from deep penetration; he shunned the ideal of the art as a  rock on which so many of his contemporaries had suffered shipwreck; he  pursued nature every where; he exacted of himself a reason for every line  he drew; and considered it the duty of a young artist to aim only at doing  well, until at length it grows into a habit, and such habit assists him in  expediting his work.    Resolute, then, in his purpose, after having studied the best native  artists in Bologna, he proceeded to do the same under Titian and Tintoretto  at Venice. Thence he passed to Florence, and improved his taste from the  pictures of Andrea, and the instructions of Passignano. At that period, the  school of the Florentines had attained to that crisis, described in  treating of its fourth epoch. Nothing could be more advantageous to young  Lodovico than to observe there the competition between the partizans of the  old and the new style; nor could there be better means of ascertaining the  causes of the decline, and of the revival of the art. Such a scene was  assuredly of the greatest use to him, though hitherto not much noticed, in  attempting the reform of painting, and carrying it to a higher degree of  perfection. The most eminent Florentines, with the view of improving the  languid colouring of their masters, turned to the models of Coreggio and  his followers; and their example, I am of opinion, induced Lodovico to  leave Florence for Parma, where, observes his historian, he wholly devoted  himself to that master and to Parmigianino. On his return to Bologna,  although well received and esteemed as a good artist, he soon became aware  that a single individual, so reserved and cautious as he was, could ill  compete with an entire school; unless, following the example of Cigoli at  Florence, he were to form a party among the rising pupils at Bologna.    In the first instance, he sought support in his own relatives. His brother  Paolo cultivated the art, but was deficient both in judgment and in  ability, and calculated only to execute with mediocrity the designs of  others. On him he placed no reliance, but a good deal on two of his  cousins. He had a paternal uncle named Antonio, by profession a tailor, who  educated his two sons, Agostino and Annibale, at home. Such was their  genius for design, that Lodovico was accustomed to say in his old age, that  he had never had, during his whole professional career, a single pupil to  equal them. The first devoted his attention to the goldsmith's art--always  the school of the best engravers; the second was at once the pupil and  assistant of his father in his calling. Though brothers, their dispositions  were so opposite, as to render their society insufferable to each other,  and they were little less than enemies. Accomplished in letters, Agostino  always sought the company of learned men; there was no science on which he  could not speak; at once a philosopher, a geometrician, and a poet; of  refined manners, ready wit, and averse to the pursuits of the crowd.  Annibale, on the contrary, neglected letters, beyond the mere power of  reading and writing, while a natural bluntness of manner inclined him to  taciturnity, and when compelled to speak, it was mostly in a satirical,  contemptuous, or disputing tone.    On devoting themselves, at the suggestion of Lodovico, to the pictoric art,  they still found themselves opposed to each other in genius, as they were  in manners. Agostino was timid, and extremely select, backward in resolve,  difficult to please himself, and was never aware of a difficulty that he  did not encounter, and attempt to vanquish it. Annibal, in common with  numbers of artificers, was an expeditious workman, intolerant of doubts and  delays, eagerly seeking every remedy for the intricacies of the art, trying  the most easy methods, and to perform much in little time. Had they indeed  fallen into other hands, Agostino would have become a new Samacchini,  Annibal a new Passerotti; and painting would have owed no improvement to  their efforts. But their cousin's fine judgment led him, in their  education, to imitate Isocrates, who, instructing Ephorus and Theopompus,  was accustomed to say, that he was compelled to apply spurs to the one, and  a rein to the other. With similar views he consigned Agostino to Fontana,  as an easy and rapid master, and retained Annibal in his own studio, where  works were carried to higher perfection. By such means too he kept them  apart, until riper age should by degrees remove the enmity subsisting  between them, and convert it into a bond of amity, when devoted to the same  profession, they might unite their capital, and mutually assist each other.  In a few years he succeeded in reconciling them, and in 1580 he placed them  at Parma and at Venice, of which an account has been given under those  schools. During this period Agostino collected materials for his varied  learning, and enlarged his design; and as before leaving Bologna he had  made great progress in engraving under Domenico Tibaldi, he continued in  Venice to practise it under Cort with such success, as to excite his  master's jealousy, who drove him, but in vain, from his studio; for  Agostino was already esteemed the Marc Antonio of his time. Annibal,  devoted to a single aim, both at Parma and Venice continued to paint,  availing himself of the works and conversation of illustrious men, with  whom at that period the Venetian School abounded. It was then, or shortly  subsequent, that he executed his beautiful copies of Coreggio, Titian, and  Paul Veronese; in whose taste he also conducted some small pictures.  Several specimens of these I saw in possession of the Marchese Durazzo at  Genoa, displaying opposite, but very graceful styles.    Returning accomplished artists into their native place, they struggled long  and nobly with their fortunes. Their first undertakings consisted of the  exploits of Jason, in a frieze of the Casa Favi; these, though conducted  with the assistance of Lodovico, were vituperated with excessive scorn by  the old painters, as deficient both in elegance and correctness. To this  censure, the credit of these masters who had flourished at Rome, who were  extolled by the poets, adorned with diplomas, and regarded by the declining  age as pillars of the art, seemed to give weight. Their disciples echoed  their words, and the crowd repeated them; and such murmurs proceeding from  a public, gifted with as much volubility in conversation as would suffice  for purposes of declamation or controversy elsewhere, wounded the feelings  of the Caracci, overwhelmed and depressed them. I was informed by the  accomplished Cav. Niccolo Fava, that Lodovico's change of fortune, along  with that of his cousins, occurred on an occasion, and at a period little  differing from the above; which is supported by a tradition to the same  effect. The two cousins had executed the frieze in the same hall where Cesi  adorned another, in opposition to it, with histories of AEneas, which we  have already mentioned, (p. 74). The work, conducted in the old style, was  certainly beautiful, but Lodovico, in the new, painted another chamber with  other histories, twelve in number, of AEneas, of which mention is made in  the Guide of Bologna, (p. 14); histories in no way inferior to those in the  Casa Magnani. Here was the beginning of the Caracci's fortune, and of the  fall of the old masters, Bologna at length preparing to do justice to the  worth of that divine artist, and to verify in respect to Cesi that sentence  of Hesiod, of which, to the best of my ability, I here offer a version from  the Greek, as follows:      Folle"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4011"],[0,"Epicoene; Or, The Silent Woman (#16)"],[1,"g, noise of the music, and her masculine and     loud commanding, and urging the whole family, makes him think he     has married a fury.       CLER: And she carries it up bravely.       TRUE: Ay, she takes any occasion to speak: that is the height on't.       CLER: And how soberly Dauphine labours to satisfy him, that it was     none of his plot!       TRUE: And has almost brought him to the faith, in the article.     Here he comes.     [ENTER SIR DAUPHINE.]     --Where is he now? what's become of him, Dauphine?       DAUP: O, hold me up a little, I shall go away in the jest else. He     has got on his whole nest of night-caps, and lock'd himself up in     the top of the house, as high as ever he can climb from the noise.     I peep'd in at a cranny, and saw him sitting over a cross-beam of     the roof, like him on the sadler's horse in Fleet-street, upright:     and he will sleep there.       CLER: But where are your collegiates?       DAUP: Withdrawn with the bride in private.       TRUE: O, they are instructing her in the college-grammar. If     she have grace with them, she knows all their secrets instantly.       CLER: Methinks the lady Haughty looks well to-day, for all my     dispraise of her in the morning. I think, I shall come about to     thee again, Truewit.       TRUE: Believe it, I told you right. Women ought to repair the     losses time and years have made in their features, with dressings.     And an intelligent woman, if she know by herself the least defect,     will be most curious to hide it: and it becomes her. If she be     short, let her sit much, lest, when she stands, she be thought to     sit. If she have an ill foot, let her wear her gown the longer,     and her shoe the thinner. If a fat hand, and scald nails, let her     carve the less, and act in gloves. If a sour breath, let her never     discourse fasting, and always talk at her distance. If she have     black and rugged teeth, let her offer the less at laughter,     especially if she laugh wide and open.       CLER: O, you shall have some women, when they laugh, you would     think they brayed, it is so rude, and--       TRUE: Ay, and others, that will stalk in their gait like an estrich,     and take huge strides. I cannot endure such a sight. I love measure     in the feet, and number in the voice: they are gentlenesses, that     oftentimes draw no less than the face.       DAUP: How camest thou to study these creatures so exactly? I would     thou would'st make me a proficient.       TRUE: Yes, but you must leave to live in your chamber, then, a     month together upon Amadis de Gaul, or Don Quixote, as you are     wont; and come abroad where the matter is frequent, to court, to     tiltings, public shows and feasts, to plays, and church sometimes:     thither they come to shew their new tires too, to see, and to be     seen. In these places a man shall find whom to love, whom to play     with, whom to touch once, whom to hold ever. The variety arrests     his judgment. A wench to please a man comes not down dropping     from the ceiling, as he lies on his back droning a tobacco pipe.     He must go where she is.       DAUP: Yes, and be never the nearer.       TRUE: Out, heretic! That diffidence makes thee worthy it should     be so.       CLER: He says true to you, Dauphine.       DAUP: Why?       TRUE: A man should not doubt to overcome any woman. Think he can     vanquish them, and he shall: for though they deny, their desire     is to be tempted. Penelope herself cannot hold out long. Ostend,     you saw, was taken at last. You must persever, and hold to your     purpose. They would solicit us, but that they are afraid.     Howsoever, they wish in their hearts we should solicit them.     Praise them, flatter them, you shall never want eloquence or     trust: even the chastest delight to feel themselves that way     rubb'd. With praises you must mix kisses too: if they take them,     they'll take more--though they strive, they would be overcome.       CLER: O, but a man must beware of force.       TRUE: It is to them an acceptable violence, and has oft-times the     place of the greatest courtesy. She that might have been forced,     and you let her go free without touching, though then she seem to     thank you, will ever hate you after; and glad in the face, is     assuredly sad at the heart.       CLER: But all women are not to be taken all ways.       TRUE: 'Tis true; no more than all birds, or all fishes. If you     appear learned to an ignorant wench, or jocund to a sad, or witty     to a foolish, why she presently begins to mistrust herself. You     must approach them in their own height, their own line: for the     contrary makes many, that fear to commit themselves to noble and     worthy fellows, run into the embraces of a rascal. If she love     wit, give verses, though you borrow them of a friend, or buy them,     to have good. If valour, talk of your sword, and be frequent in     the mention of quarrels, though you be staunch in fighting. If     activity, be seen on your barbary often, or leaping over stools,     for the credit of your back. If she love good clothes or dressing,     have your learned council about you every morning, your French     tailor, barber, linener, etc. Let your powder, your glass, and     your comb be your dearest acquaintance. Take more care for the     ornament of your head, than the safety: and wish the commonwealth     rather troubled, than a hair about you. That will take her. Then,     if she be covetous and craving, do you promise any thing, and     perform sparingly; so shall you keep her in appetite still. Seem     as you would give, but be like a barren field, that yields little,     or unlucky dice to foolish and hoping gamesters. Let your gifts     be slight and dainty, rather than precious. Let cunning be above     cost. Give cherries at time of year, or apricots; and say they     were sent you out of the country, though you bought them in     Cheapside. Admire her tires: like her in all fashions; compare her     in every habit to some deity; invent excellent dreams to flatter     her, and riddles; or, if she be a great one, perform always the     second parts to her: like what she likes, praise whom she praises,     and fail not to make the household and servants yours, yea the     whole family, and salute them by their names: ('tis but light cost     if you can purchase them so,) and make her physician your     pensioner, and her chief woman. Nor will it be out of your gain to     make love to her too, so she follow, not usher her lady's     pleasure. All blabbing is taken away, when she comes to be a part     of the crime.       DAUP: On what courtly lap hast thou late slept, to come forth so     sudden and absolute a courtling?       TRUE: Good faith, I should rather question you, that are so     harkening after these mysteries. I begin to suspect your     diligence, Dauphine. Speak, art thou in love in earnest?       DAUP: Yes, by my troth am I: 'twere ill dissembling before thee.       TRUE: With which of them, I prithee?       DAUP: With all the collegiates.       CLER: Out on thee! We'll keep you at home, believe it, in the     stable, if you be such a stallion.       TRUE: No; I like him well. Men should love wisely, and all women;     some one for the face, and let her please the eye; another for     the skin, and let her please the touch; a third for the voice, and     let her please the ear; and where the objects mix, let the senses     so too. Thou would'st think it strange, if I should make them all     in love with thee afore night!       DAUP: I would say, thou had'st the best philtre in the world, and     couldst do more than madam Medea, or doctor Foreman.       TRUE: If I do not, let me play the mountebank for my meat, while I     live, and the bawd for my drink.       DAUP: So be it, I say.       [ENTER OTTER, WITH HIS THREE CUPS, DAW, AND LA-FOOLE.]       OTT: O Lord, gentlemen, how my knights and I have mist you here!       CLER: Why, captain, what service? what service?       OTT: To see me bring up my bull, bear, and horse to fight.       DAW: Yes, faith, the captain says we shall be his dogs to bait     them.       DAUP: A good employment.       TRUE: Come on, let's see a course, then.       LA-F: I am afraid my cousin will be offended, if she come.       OTT: Be afraid of nothing. Gentlemen, I have placed the drum and     the trumpets, and one to give them the sign when you are ready.     Here's my bull for myself, and my bear for sir John Daw, and my     horse for sir Amorous. Now set your foot to mine, and yours to     his, and--       LA-F: Pray God my cousin come not.       OTT: Saint George, and saint Andrew, fear no cousins. Come,     sound, sound.     [DRUM AND TRUMPETS SOUND.]     Et rauco strepuerunt cornua cantu.       [THEY DRINK.]       TRUE: Well said, captain, i'faith: well fought at the bull.       CLER: Well held at the bear.       TRUE: Low, low! captain.       DAUP: O, the horse has kick'd off his dog already.       LA-F: I cannot drink it, as I am a knight.       TRUE: Ods so! off with his spurs, somebody.       LA-F: It goes against my conscience. My cousin will be angry with it.       DAW: I have done mine.       TRUE: You fought high and fair, sir John.       CLER: At the head.       DAUP: Like an excellent bear-dog.       CLER: You take no notice of the business, I hope?       DAW: Not a word, sir; you see we are jovial.       OTT: Sir Amorous, you must not equivocate.     It must be pull'd down, for all my cousin.       CLER: 'Sfoot, if you take not your drink, they will think you are     discontented with something: you'll betray all, if you take the     least notice.       LA-F: Not I; I'll both drink and talk then.       OTT: You must pull the horse on his knees, sir Amorous: fear no     cousins. Jacta est alea.       TRUE: O, now he's in his vein, and bold.
