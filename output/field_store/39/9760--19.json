[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3623"],[0,"The Golden Bough: A Study of Magic and Religion (#16)"],[1," if a man has been stabbed with a knife, it is essential  to his recovery that the knife should be greased and laid across the  bed on which the sufferer is lying. So in Bavaria you are directed  to anoint a linen rag with grease and tie it on the edge of the axe  that cut you, taking care to keep the sharp edge upwards. As the  grease on the axe dries, your wound heals. Similarly in the Harz  Mountains they say that if you cut yourself, you ought to smear the  knife or the scissors with fat and put the instrument away in a dry  place in the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.  As the knife dries, the wound heals. Other people, however, in  Germany say that you should stick the knife in some damp place in  the ground, and that your hurt will heal as the knife rusts. Others  again, in Bavaria, recommend you to smear the axe or whatever it is  with blood and put it under the eaves.    The train of reasoning which thus commends itself to English and  German rustics, in common with the savages of Melanesia and America,  is carried a step further by the aborigines of Central Australia,  who conceive that under certain circumstances the near relations of  a wounded man must grease themselves, restrict their diet, and  regulate their behaviour in other ways in order to ensure his  recovery. Thus when a lad has been circumcised and the wound is not  yet healed, his mother may not eat opossum, or a certain kind of  lizard, or carpet snake, or any kind of fat, for otherwise she would  retard the healing of the boy's wound. Every day she greases her  digging-sticks and never lets them out of her sight; at night she  sleeps with them close to her head. No one is allowed to touch them.  Every day also she rubs her body all over with grease, as in some  way this is believed to help her son's recovery. Another refinement  of the same principle is due to the ingenuity of the German peasant.  It is said that when one of his pigs or sheep breaks its leg, a  farmer of Rhenish Bavaria or Hesse will bind up the leg of a chair  with bandages and splints in due form. For some days thereafter no  one may sit on that chair, move it, or knock up against it; for to  do so would pain the injured pig or sheep and hinder the cure. In  this last case it is clear that we have passed wholly out of the  region of contagious magic and into the region of homoeopathic or  imitative magic; the chair-leg, which is treated instead of the  beast's leg, in no sense belongs to the animal, and the application  of bandages to it is a mere simulation of the treatment which a more  rational surgery would bestow on the real patient.    The sympathetic connexion supposed to exist between a man and the  weapon which has wounded him is probably founded on the notion that  the blood on the weapon continues to feel with the blood in his  body. For a like reason the Papuans of Tumleo, an island off New  Guinea, are careful to throw into the sea the bloody bandages with  which their wounds have been dressed, for they fear that if these  rags fell into the hands of an enemy he might injure them magically  thereby. Once when a man with a wound in his mouth, which bled  constantly, came to the missionaries to be treated, his faithful  wife took great pains to collect all the blood and cast it into the  sea. Strained and unnatural as this idea may seem to us, it is  perhaps less so than the belief that magic sympathy is maintained  between a person and his clothes, so that whatever is done to the  clothes will be felt by the man himself, even though he may be far  away at the time. In the Wotjobaluk tribe of Victoria a wizard would  sometimes get hold of a man's opossum rug and roast it slowly in the  fire, and as he did so the owner of the rug would fall sick. If the  wizard consented to undo the charm, he would give the rug back to  the sick man's friends, bidding them put it in water, \"so as to wash  the fire out.\" When that happened, the sufferer would feel a  refreshing coolness and probably recover. In Tanna, one of the New  Hebrides, a man who had a grudge at another and desired his death  would try to get possession of a cloth which had touched the sweat  of his enemy's body. If he succeeded, he rubbed the cloth carefully  over with the leaves and twigs of a certain tree, rolled and bound  cloth, twigs, and leaves into a long sausage-shaped bundle, and  burned it slowly in the fire. As the bundle was consumed, the victim  fell ill, and when it was reduced to ashes, he died. In this last  form of enchantment, however, the magical sympathy may be supposed  to exist not so much between the man and the cloth as between the  man and the sweat which issued from his body. But in other cases of  the same sort it seems that the garment by itself is enough to give  the sorcerer a hold upon his victim. The witch in Theocritus, while  she melted an image or lump of wax in order that her faithless lover  might melt with love of her, did not forget to throw into the fire a  shred of his cloak which he had dropped in her house. In Prussia  they say that if you cannot catch a thief, the next best thing you  can do is to get hold of a garment which he may have shed in his  flight; for if you beat it soundly, the thief will fall sick. This  belief is firmly rooted in the popular mind. Some eighty or ninety  years ago, in the neighbourhood of Berend, a man was detected trying  to steal honey, and fled, leaving his coat behind him. When he heard  that the enraged owner of the honey was mauling his lost coat, he  was so alarmed that he took to his bed and died.    Again, magic may be wrought on a man sympathetically, not only  through his clothes and severed parts of himself, but also through  the impressions left by his body in sand or earth. In particular, it  is a world-wide superstition that by injuring footprints you injure  the feet that made them. Thus the natives of South-eastern Australia  think that they can lame a man by placing sharp pieces of quartz,  glass, bone, or charcoal in his footprints. Rheumatic pains are  often attributed by them to this cause. Seeing a Tatungolung man  very lame, Mr. Howitt asked him what was the matter. He said, \"some  fellow has put _bottle_ in my foot.\" He was suffering from  rheumatism, but believed that an enemy had found his foot-track and  had buried it in a piece of broken bottle, the magical influence of  which had entered his foot.    Similar practices prevail in various parts of Europe. Thus in  Mecklenburg it is thought that if you drive a nail into a man's  footprint he will fall lame; sometimes it is required that the nail  should be taken from a coffin. A like mode of injuring an enemy is  resorted to in some parts of France. It is said that there was an  old woman who used to frequent Stow in Suffolk, and she was a witch.  If, while she walked, any one went after her and stuck a nail or a  knife into her footprint in the dust, the dame could not stir a step  till it was withdrawn. Among the South Slavs a girl will dig up the  earth from the footprints of the man she loves and put it in a  flower-pot. Then she plants in the pot a marigold, a flower that is  thought to be fadeless. And as its golden blossom grows and blooms  and never fades, so shall her sweetheart's love grow and bloom, and  never, never fade. Thus the love-spell acts on the man through the  earth he trod on. An old Danish mode of concluding a treaty was  based on the same idea of the sympathetic connexion between a man  and his footprints: the covenanting parties sprinkled each other's  footprints with their own blood, thus giving a pledge of fidelity.  In ancient Greece superstitions of the same sort seem to have been  current, for it was thought that if a horse stepped on the track of  a wolf he was seized with numbness; and a maxim ascribed to  Pythagoras forbade people to pierce a man's footprints with a nail  or a knife.    The same superstition is turned to account by hunters in many parts  of the world for the purpose of running down the game. Thus a German  huntsman will stick a nail taken from a coffin into the fresh spoor  of the quarry, believing that this will hinder the animal from  escaping. The aborigines of Victoria put hot embers in the tracks of  the animals they were pursuing. Hottentot hunters throw into the air  a handful of sand taken from the footprints of the game, believing  that this will bring the animal down. Thompson Indians used to lay  charms on the tracks of wounded deer; after that they deemed it  superfluous to pursue the animal any further that day, for being  thus charmed it could not travel far and would soon die. Similarly,  Ojebway Indians placed \"medicine\" on the track of the first deer or  bear they met with, supposing that this would soon bring the animal  into sight, even if it were two or three days' journey off; for this  charm had power to compress a journey of several days into a few  hours. Ewe hunters of West Africa stab the footprints of game with a  sharp-pointed stick in order to maim the quarry and allow them to  come up with it.    But though the footprint is the most obvious it is not the only  impression made by the body through which magic may be wrought on a  man. The aborigines of South-eastern Australia believe that a man  may be injured by burying sharp fragments of quartz, glass, and so  forth in the mark made by his reclining body; the magical virtue of  these sharp things enters his body and causes those acute pains  which the ignorant European puts down to rheumatism. We can now  understand why it was a maxim with the Pythagoreans that in rising  from bed you should smooth away the impression left by your body on  the bed-clothes. The rule was simply an old precaution against  magic, forming part of a whole code of superstitious maxims which  antiquity fathered on Pythagoras, though doubtless they were  familiar to the barbarous forefathers of the Greeks long before the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36299"],[0,"Our Legal Heritage: King AEthelbert - King George III, 600 A.D. - 1776 (#16)"],[1,"ures,  meadows, harvests, and contests between neighbors.         In London, the Hustings Court met weekly and decided such issues as  wills and bequests and commerce matters. The folkmote of all citizens  met three times a year. Each ward had a leet court [for minor criminal  matters].         The king and his witan decided the complaints and issues of the  nobility and those cases which had not received justice in the hundred  or shire court. The witan had a criminal jurisdiction and could imprison  or outlaw a person. The witan could even compel the king to return any  land he might have unjustly taken. Specially punishable by the king was  \"oferhyrnesse\": contempt of the king's law. It covered refusal of  justice, neglect of summons to gemot or pursuit of thieves, disobedience  to the king's officers, sounding the king's coin, accepting another  man's dependent without his leave, buying outside markets, and refusing  to pay Peter's pence.         The forests were peculiarly subject to the absolute will of the king.  They were outside the common law. Their unique customs and laws  protected the peace of the animals rather than the king's subjects. Only  special officials on special commissions heard their cases.         The form of oaths for compurgation were specified for theft of cattle,  unsoundness of property bought, and money owed for a sale. The defendant  denied the accusation by sweating that \"By the Lord, I am guiltless,  both in deed and counsel, and of the charge of which ... accuses me.\" A  compurgator swore that \"By the Lord, the oath is clean and unperjured  which ... has sworn.\". A witness swore that \"In the name of Almighty  God, as I here for ... in true witness stand, unbidden and unbought, so  I with my eyes oversaw, and with my ears overheard, that which I with  him say.\"         If a theow man was guilty at the ordeal, he was not only to give  compensation, but was to be scourged thrice, or a second geld be given;  and be the wite of half value for theows.                                          - - - Chapter 4 - - -                                    - The Times: 1066-1100 -         William came from Normandy to conquer England. He claimed that the  former King, Edward, the Confessor, had promised the throne to him when  they were growing up together in Normandy, if Edward became King of  England and had no children. The Conquerer's men and horses came in  boats powered by oars and sails. The conquest did not take long because  of the superiority of his military expertise to that of the English. He  organized his army into three groups: archers with bows and arrows,  horsemen with swords and stirrups, and footmen with hand weapons. Each  group played a specific role in a strategy planned in advance. The  English army was only composed of footmen with hand weapons such as  spears and shields. They fought in a line holding up their shields to  overlap each other and form a shieldwall. The defeat of the English was  thought to have been presaged by a comet.         At Westminster, he made an oath to defend God's holy churches and their  rulers, to rule the whole people subject to him with righteousness and  royal providence, to enact and hold fast right law, and to utterly  forbid rapine and unrighteous judgments. This was in keeping with the  traditional oath of a new king.         Declaring the English who fought against him to be traitors, the  Conquerer declared their land confiscated. But he allowed those who were  willing to acknowledge him to redeem their land by a payment of money.  As William conquered the land of the realm, he parceled it out among the  barons who fought with him so that each baron was given the holdings of  an Anglo-Saxon predecessor, scattered though they were. The barons again  made oaths of personal loyalty to him [fealty]. They agreed to hold the  land as his vassals with future military services to him and receipt of  his protection. They gave him homage by placing their hands within his  and saying \"I become your man for the tenement I hold of you, and I will  bear you faith in life and member [limb] and earthly honor against all  men\". They held their land \"of their lord\", the King, by knight's  service. The king had \"enfeoffed\" them [given them a fief: a source of  income] with land. The theory that by right all land was the King's and  that land was held by others only at his gift and in return for  specified service was new to English thought. The original duration of a  knight's fee until about 1100 was for his life; thereafter it was  heritable. The word \"knight\" came to replace the word \"thegn\" as a  person who received his position and land by fighting for the King. The  exact obligation of knight's service was to furnish a fully armed  horseman to serve at his own expense for forty days in the year. This  service was not limited to defense of the country, but included fighting  abroad. The baron led his own knights under his banner. The foot  soldiers were from the fyrd or were mercenaries. Every free man was  sworn to join in the defense of the king, his lands and his honor,  within England and without.         The Saxon governing class was destroyed. The independent power of  earls, who had been drawn from three great family houses, was curtailed.  Most died or fled the country. Some men were allowed to redeem their  land by money payment if they showed loyalty to the Conquerer. Well-born  women crowded into nunneries to escape Norman violence. The people were  deprived of their most popular leaders, who were excluded from all  positions of trust and profit, especially all the clergy. The earldoms  became fiefs instead of magistracies.         The Conquerer was a stern and fierce man and ruled as an autocrat by  terror. Whenever the people revolted or resisted his mandates, he seized  their lands or destroyed the crops and laid waste the countryside and so  that they starved to death. This example pacified others. His rule was  strong, resolute, wise, and wary. He was not arbitrary or oppressive.  The Conquerer had a strict system of policing the nation. Instead of the  Anglo-Saxon self-government throughout the districts and hundreds of  resident authorities in local courts, he aimed at substituting for it  the absolute rule of the barons under military rule so favorable to the  centralizing power of the Crown. He used secret police and spies and the  terrorism this system involved. This especially curbed the minor barons  and preserved the public peace.         The English people, who outnumbered the Normans by 300 to 1, were  disarmed. Curfew bells were rung at 7:00 PM when everyone had to remain  in their own dwellings on pain of death and all fires and candles were  to be put out. This prevented any nightly gatherings, assassinations, or  seditions. Order was brought to the kingdom so that no man dare kill  another, no matter how great the injury he had received. The Conquerer  extended the King's peace on the highways, i.e. roads on high ground, to  include the whole nation. Any individual of any rank could travel from  end to end of the land unharmed. Before, prudent travelers would travel  only in groups of twenty.         The barons subjugated the English who were on their newly acquired  land. There began a hierarchy of seisin [rightful occupation] of land so  that there could be no land without its lord. Also, every lord had a  superior lord with the king as the overlord or supreme landlord. One  piece of land may be held by several tenures. For instance, A, holding  by barons' service of the King, may enfeoff B, a church, to hold of him  on the terms of praying for the souls of his ancestors, and B may  enfeoff a freeman C to hold of the church by giving it a certain  percentage of his crops every year. There were about 200 barons who held  land directly of the King. Other fighting men were the knights, who were  tenants or subtenants of a baron. Knighthood began as a reward for valor  on the field of battle by the king or a noble. The value of a knight's  fee was 400s. [20 pounds] per year. Altogether there were about 5000  fighting men holding land.         The essence of Norman feudalism was that the land remained under the  lord, whatever the vassal might do. The lord had the duty to defend the  vassals on his land. The vassal owed military service to the lord and  also the service of attending the courts of the hundred and the county  [formerly \"shire\"], which were courts of the King, administering old  customary law. They were the King's courts on the principle that a crime  anywhere was a breach of the King's peace. The King's peace that had  covered his residence and household had extended to places where he  might travel, such as highways, rivers, bridges, churches, monasteries,  markets, and towns, and then encompassed every place, replacing the  general public peace. Infraction of the King's peace incurred fines to  the King.         This feudal bond based on occupancy of land rather than on personal  ties was uniform throughout the realm. No longer could a man choose his  lord and transfer his land with him to a new lord. He held his land at  the will of his lord, to be terminated anytime the lord decided to do  so. A tenant could not alienate his land without permission of his lord.  In later eras, tenancies would be held for the life of the tenant, and  even later, for his life and those of his heirs.         This uniformity of land organization plus the new requirement that  every freeman take an oath of loyalty directly to the king to assist him  in preserving his lands and honor and defending him against his enemies,  which oath would supersede any oath to any other man, gave the nation a  new unity. The king could call men directly to the fyrd, summon them to  his court, and tax them without intervention of their lords. And the  people learned to look to the king for protection from abuse by their  lords.       "]]]
