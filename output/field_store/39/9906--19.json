Assuming  continuance of present interest rates, the Government's interest bill is  now reaching the probable postwar level.    (c) For refunds.    An estimated total of 1,585 million dollars of refunds will be paid to  individuals and corporations during the fiscal year 1947. Slightly over  half of this amount, or 800 million dollars, will be accessory to the  simplified pay-as-you-go method of tax collection, and will be the result  of overwithholding and over declaration of expected income. Most of the  remainder will arise from loss and excess-profits credit carrybacks,  recomputed amortization on war plants, and special relief from the excess  profits tax.    This category of expenditures is thus losing gradually its  \"aftermath-of-war\" character, and by the succeeding year will reflect  almost entirely the normal operation of loss carry-backs and current tax  collection.    3. AGRICULTURAL PROGRAMS    The agricultural programs contemplated for the fiscal year 1947 are those  which are essential for the provision of an adequate supply of food and  other agricultural commodities with a fair return to American farmers. To  support these objectives, expenditures by the Department of Agriculture  estimated at 784 million dollars from general and special accounts will be  required in the fiscal year 1947. This compares with estimated expenditures  of 676 million dollars in 1946. These figures exclude expenditures by the  Department of Agriculture on account of lend-lease, the United Nations  Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and other war expenditures. The  expenditure for the fiscal year 1947 is composed of 553 million dollars for  \"aids to agriculture,\" 35 million dollars for general public works, and 196  million dollars for other services of the Department.    Net outlays for the price stabilization, price support, and other programs  of the Commodity Credit Corporation are expected to increase from about 750  million dollars in the fiscal year 1946 to about 1,500 million dollars in  1947. Cash advances made on loans by the farm Security Administration and  the Rural Electrification Administration are expected to amount to 266  million dollars in the fiscal year 1946 and 351 million dollars in 1947;  and after receipts from principal and interest are taken into account, net  loan expenditures of these two agencies will amount to 120 and 209 million  dollars in the two fiscal years.    To provide for the expenditures from general and special accounts, I  recommend for the fiscal year 1947 appropriations of million dollars  (including the existing permanent appropriation of an amount equal to 30  percent of estimated annual customs receipts) and a reappropriation of 88  million dollars of prior-year balances from customs receipts. In addition  there is a recommended authorization of 367.5 million dollars for borrowing  from the Reconstruction finance Corporation for the loan programs of the  farm Security Administration and the Rural Electrification Administration.  It is expected that the operations of the Commodity Credit Corporation will  be financed during the coming year through the 500 million dollars of  lend-lease funds which the Congress has earmarked for price support  purposes, a supplemental appropriation to restore impaired capital of the  Corporation, and the borrowing authority of the Corporation.    Some detailed recommendations follow for major agricultural programs.    Conservation and use of land.--I am recommending that 270 million dollars  be appropriated for \"conservation and use of agricultural land  resources\"--the so-called AAA program--for the fiscal year 1947, compared  with 356 million dollars in the current year. This reduction of 86 million  dollars is in large part accounted for by elimination of the wartime flax  production incentive project and other nonrecurring items; the proposed  reduction in normal activities is less than 33 million dollars.    For the past several years, this program has consisted largely of payments  to farmers for application of fertilizer and other approved soil management  practices. I am convinced that farmers generally are now fully alert to the  benefits, both immediate and long-term, which they derive from the  practices encouraged by this program. I believe, therefore, that this  subsidization should continue to be reduced.    Rural electrification.--It is proposed that the loan authorization for the  Rural Electrification Administration for the fiscal year 1947 be increased  from 200 million dollars to 250 million dollars. During the war period, REA  was limited by the scarcity of materials and manpower. But that situation  is rapidly changing, and the REA program, which was materially stepped up  for the fiscal year 1946, can be increased still more. It is my belief that  a feasible and practical rural electrification program should be carried  forward as rapidly as possible. This will involve total loans of  approximately 1,800 million dollars over the next 10 years, much of which  will be repaid during that period.    Other programs.--It is recommended that the continuing forest  land-acquisition program be resumed at the rate of 3 million dollars  annually, which is about the minimum rate at which this program can be  economically carried on. The lands involved in this program can contribute  fully to the national welfare only when brought into the national forest  system for protection and development.    Such programs as those of the farm Security Administration and the farm  Credit Administration are estimated to be continued during the fiscal year  1947 at about the same level as in the fiscal year 1946. Recent action by  the Congress has Permitted some expansion of the school lunch program. I  hope it will be continued and expanded. The budgets of the Federal Crop  Insurance Corporation and the federal farm Mortgage Corporation will be  transmitted in the spring under the terms of the Government Corporation  Control Act.    4. TRANSPORTATION    Transportation is one of the major fields for both public and private  investment. Our facilities for transportation and communication must be  constantly improved to serve better the convenience of the public and to  facilitate the sound growth and development of the whole economy.    Federal capital outlays for transportation facilities are expected to  approximate 519 million dollars in the fiscal year 1947. State and local  governments may spend 400 million dollars. Private investment, over half of  it by railways, may approach 1,150 million dollars.    The Congress has already taken steps for the resumption of work on  improvement of rivers and harbors and on the construction of new  Federal-aid highways. Much needed work on airports can begin when the  Congress enacts legislation now in conference between the two Houses.    The Federal expenditure estimates for the fiscal year 1947 include 53  million dollars for new construction in rivers, harbors, and the Panama  Canal and 291 million dollars for highways and grade-crossing elimination,  assuming that the States expend some 275 million dollars on the Federal-aid  system. Additional expenditures for highways totaling 36 million dollars  are anticipated by the forest Service, National Park Service, and the  Territory of Alaska. Civil airways and airports will involve expenditures  of 35 million dollars under existing authority. Additional Federal  expenditures exceeding 20 million dollars (to be matched by States and  municipalities) may be made during the fiscal year 1947 under the airport  legislation now in conference between the two Houses of the Congress.    The United States now controls almost two-thirds of the world's merchant  shipping, most of it Government-owned, compared with little more than  one-seventh of the world's tonnage in 1939. This places a heavy  responsibility upon the Nation to provide for speedy and efficient world  commerce as a contribution to general economic recovery.    The estimates for the United States Maritime Commission and War Shipping  Administration provide for the transition of shipping operation from a war  to a peace basis; the sale, chartering, or lay-up of much of the war-built  fleet; and for a program of ship construction of some 84 million dollars in  the fiscal year 1947 to round out the merchant fleet for peacetime use.    Federal aids, subsidies, and regulatory controls for transportation should  follow the general principle of benefiting the national economy as a whole.  They should seek to improve the transportation system and increase its  efficiency with resulting lower rates and superior service. Differential  treatment which benefits one type of transportation to the detriment of  another should be avoided save when it is demonstrated clearly to be in the  public interest.    5. RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT    Total capital outlays for resource development are estimated at 653 million  dollars in the fiscal year 1947 as compared with 452 million dollars in  1946. These include capital expenditures by the Rural Electrification  Administration and expenditures for resource development by other  organizational units in the Department of Agriculture which are also  mentioned above under \"agricultural programs.\"    The reclamation and flood control projects which I am recommending for the  fiscal year 1947 will involve capital outlays of approximately 319 million  dollars as compared with 245 million dollars in the fiscal year 1946. These  expenditures cover programs of the Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of  Reclamation, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Department of Agriculture,  and the International Boundary and Water Commission, United States and  Mexico. A number of these projects are multiple-purpose projects, providing  not only for reclamation and irrigation of barren land and flood control,  but also for the production of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50535"],[0,"Blood Atonement and the Origin of Plural Marriage: A Discussion (#16)"],[1,"people      Israel. And they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity;      the punishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of      him that seeketh unto him; that the house of Israel may go no      more astray from me, neither be polluted any more with all their      transgression; but that they may be my people, and I may be their      God, saith the Lord God,\" 8c., 11 v. We have here the facts as they      have transpired and as they will continue to transpire in relation      to this subject. The death of the prophet is one fact that has      been realized although he abhorred and repented of this iniquity      before his death. This branch of the subject we shall leave to some      of our brethren, who are qualified to explain it satisfactorily.      Those who have practiced these abominations have become \"a sign      and a proverb\" among men in accordance with this prophecy. These      are the \"false teachers\" prophesied of by Peter, of whom he said      \"many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way      of truth shall be evil spoken of. And through covetousness shall      they with feigned words make merchandise of you; whose judgment      now of a long time lingereth not, and their abomination slumbereth      not.\" The reason why the Lord destroyed the prophet and made those      who \"set up their idols in their heart,\" a sign and a proverb,      made them bear the punishment of their iniquity is worthy of our      earnest attention. We are informed that the reason why the Lord      would perform all these things was this, \"that the house of Israel      may go no more astray from me, neither be polluted any more with      all their transgressions; but that they may be my people, and I      may be their God.\" Here is positive evidence that this prophecy      was to be fulfilled in the last days, for there has only been a      small part of the house of Israel (at any time since this prophecy      was given) that were obedient to the Lord. The time is not fully      come when Israel shall \"go no more astray,\" and not \"be polluted      any more with all their transgressions,\" therefore the punishment      of these men who have committed these sins must continue until      that happy day shall come. But as the Lord says in this prophecy,      \"repent and turn yourselves from your idols; and turn away your      faces from your abominations, so say we, and return unto the fold      from whence you have strayed.\" As some may yet doubt whether God      would act in this way toward men who set up their idols in their      heart, we will see how God dealt with Balaam. In Numbers 22 c. we      are informed that Balak, king of the Moabites, sent the elders of      Moab and Midian unto Balaam with the rewards of divination in their      hands to entreat him that he would curse Israel, but God said unto      Balaam, \"Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the      people, for they are blessed.\" And Balaam rose up in the morning,      and said unto the Princes of Balak, \"Get you unto your land; for      the Lord refuseth to give me leave to go with you.\" And Balak      sent yet again princes, more, and more honorable than they. And      they came to Balaam and said to him, \"Thus sayeth Balak, the son      of Zippor, let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto      me: For I will promote thee unto very great honor, and I will do      whatsoever thou sayest unto me; come, therefore, I pray thee, curse      me this people.\" Now although the Lord had said unto Balaam, \"Thou      shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people, for they      are blessed,\" yet the great honor that was offered him, allured      him, and he inquired of the Lord again, and said unto the princes,      \"Tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the Lord will      say unto me more.\" And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto      him, \"If the men come to call thee, rise up and go with them: but      yet the word which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do.\" And      Balaam rose up in the morning and saddled his ass, and went with      the princes of Moab. And God's anger was kindled because he went;      and the angel of the Lord stood in the way for an adversary against      him. So we find that the Lord told him not to go, but afterwards,      having \"set up his idol in his heart\" he inquired of the Lord      again whether he might not go and curse Israel and God's anger was      kindled against him because he did so, although God had commanded      him to go. This is, therefore, a parallel case with Ezekiel's      prophecy.[3]        In I Kings, 22 c. we are informed that the King of Israel wanted      Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, to go up with him to Ramoth-Gilead      to battle, and there were four hundred prophets who said \"Go up,      for the Lord shall deliver it into the hands of the king.\" And      Jehoshaphat said, \"Is there not here a prophet of the Lord besides,      that we might inquire of him?\" And the king of Israel said unto      Jehoshapat, \"There is yet one, Micaiah, the son of Imlah, by      whom we may inquire of the Lord; but I hate him, for he doth not      prophesy good concerning me, but evil.\" And Jehoshaphat said, \"Let      not the king say so.\" So he was sent for. The messenger that was      gone to call Micaiah spake unto him, saying, \"Behold now the words      of the prophets declare good unto the king with one mouth: let thy      word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak that      which is good.\" And Micaiah said, \"As the Lord liveth, what the      Lord saith unto me, that will I speak.\" We are then informed that      Micaiah prophesied like the false prophets,[4] and then against      them. And he said, \"I saw the Lord sitting on his throne, and all      the hosts of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his      left. And the Lord said, Who shall persuade Ahab that he may go up      and fall at Ramoth-Gilead? And one said on this matter, and another      said on that manner. And there came forth a spirit and stood before      the Lord and said, I will persuade him. And the Lord said unto him      wherewith? And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a lying      spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, thou shalt      persuade him, and prevail also; go forth and do so. Now therefore      behold the Lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these      thy prophets, and the Lord hath spoken evil concerning thee.\" This      doctrine was extensively preached in the Church before iniquity      overthrew the Church, and by this doctrine the Church might have      been saved, if men had not \"set up their idols in their heart.\"      Footnotes    1. The Prophet Joseph Smith, Brigham Young and the Saints.    2. The inspired translation reads: \"I the Lord have not deceived that  prophet.\"    3. Mr. Sheen forgets that the Lord said, \"Thou shalt not curse the  people, for they are blessed,\" which command Balaam hearkened to.    4. The prophecy was; \"Go and prosper; for the Lord shall deliver it  into the hands of the king,\" v. 15. This was uttered in mockery, if not  why did the king reply: \"How many times shall I adjure thee that thou  tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the Lord,\" v. 16.  _Then_ Micaiah told the king that he should fall at Ramoth-Gilead, so  the king acted with full knowledge of the word of the Lord concerning  his death when he went forth to battle. Therefore the Lord did not  deceive Ahab in this matter.        INTRODUCTION OF CELESTIAL AND PLURAL MARRIAGE    Additional testimony of a few out of the multitude[1] of witnesses who  were taught these principles by the Prophet Joseph Smith, and who knew  that he received the revelation known as section 132 in the Book of  Doctrine and Covenants.      AFFIDAVIT OF PRESIDENT LORENZO SNOW    In the month of April, 1843, I returned from my European mission. A  few days after my arrival at Nauvoo, when at President Joseph Smith's  house, he said he wished to have some private talk with me, and  requested me to walk out with him. It was toward evening. We walked a  little distance and sat down on a large log that lay near the bank of  the river. He there and then explained to me the doctrine of plurality  of wives; he said that the Lord had revealed it unto him, and commanded  him to have women sealed to him as wives; that he foresaw the trouble  that would follow, and sought to turn away from the commandment; that  an angel from heaven then appeared before him with a drawn sword,  threatening him with destruction unless he went forward and obeyed the  commandment.    He further said that my sister Eliza R. Snow had been sealed to him as  his wife for time and eternity. He told me that the Lord would open the  way, and I should have women sealed to me as wives. This conversation  was prolonged, I think one hour or more, in which he told me many  important things.    I solemnly declare before God and holy angels, and as I hope to come  forth in the morning of the resurrection, that the above statement is  true.    Lorenzo Snow.
