Nevertheless, the traveller in       these distant regions encounters occasionally detached       examples of railways even in the valley of the       Mississippi. In the State of Mississippi there are five       short lines, ten or twelve in Louisiana, and a limited       number scattered over Florida, Alabama, Illinois,       Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio. These, however, are       generally detached and single lines, unconnected with       the vast network which we shall presently notice. To       the traveller in these wild regions the aspect of such       artificial agents of transport in the midst of a       country, a great portion of which is still in the state       of native forest, is most remarkable, and strongly       characteristic of the irrepressible spirit of       enterprise of its people. Travelling in the back woods       of Mississippi, through native forests, where till       within a few years human foot never trod, through       solitudes, the silence of which was never broken, even       by the red man, we have been sometimes filled with       wonder to find ourselves transported by an engine       constructed at Newcastle-on-Tyne, and driven by an       artisan from Liverpool, at the rate of twenty miles an       hour. It is not easy to describe the impression       produced by the juxtaposition of these refinements of       art and science with the wildness of the country, where       one sees the frightened deer start from its lair at the       snorting of the ponderous machine and the appearance of       the snakelike train which follows it.         The first American railway was opened for passengers on       the last day of 1829. According to the reports       collected and given in detail in the work already       quoted, it appears that in 1849, after an interval of       just twenty years, there were in actual operation 6,565       miles of railway in the States. The cost of       construction and plant of this system of railways       appears by the same authority to have been       53,386,885_l._, being at the average rate of 8,129_l._       per mile.         The reports collected in Dr. Lardner's work come up to       the middle of 1849. We have, however, before us       documents which supply data to a more recent period,       and have computed from them the following table,       exhibiting the number of miles of railway in actual       operation in the United States, the capital expended in       their construction and plant, and the length of the       lines which are in process of construction, but not yet  completed:--    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------                          |  Railways   |   Cost of    |  Projected  |Cost per                          |     in      | Building and |    and in   |   Mile.                          | operation.  |   Plant.     |   progress. |  ------------------------+-------------+--------------+-------------+--------                          |    Miles.   |      L       |    Miles.   |    L  Eastern States,         |             |              |             |  including Maine, New    |             |              |             |  Hampshire, Vermont,     |             |              |             |  Massachusetts, Rhode    |             |              |             |  Island, and  Connecticut|    2,845    |   23,100,987 |      567    |  8,123                          |             |              |             |  Atlantic States,        |             |              |             |  including New-York, the |             |              |             |  Jerseys, Pennsylvania,  |             |              |             |  Delaware, and Maryland  |    3,503    |   27,952,500 |    2,020    |  7,979                          |             |              |             |  Southern States,        |             |              |             |  including Virginia, the |             |              |             |  Carolinas, Georgia,     |             |              |             |  Florida, and Alabama    |    2,103    |    8,253,130 |   1,283     |  3,919                          |             |              |             |  Western States,         |             |              |             |  including Mississippi,  |             |              |             |  Louisiana, Texas,       |             |              |             |  Tennessee, Kentucky,    |             |              |             |  Ohio, Michigan, Indiana,|             |              |             |  Illinois, Missouri,     |             |              |             |  Iowa, and Wisconsin     |    1,835    |    7,338,290 |    5,762    |  3,999                          |-------------+--------------+-------------+--------  Totals and averages     |   10,289    |   66,653,907 |    9,632    |  6,478  ------------------------+-------------+--------------+-------------+--------         It must be admitted that the results here exhibited       present a somewhat astonishing spectacle. It appears       from this statement that there are in actual operation       in the United States 10,289 miles of railway, and that       there are 9,632 projected and in process of execution.       So that when a few years more shall have rolled away,       this extraordinary people will actually have 20,000       miles of iron road in operation.         It appears from the above report, compared with the       previous report quoted from Dr. Lardner, that the       average cost of construction has been diminished as the       operations progressed. According to Dr. Lardner, the       average cost of construction of the 6,500 miles of       railway in operation in 1849 was 8,129_l._ per mile       whereas, it appears from the preceding table that the       actual cost of 10,289 miles now in operation has been       at the average rate of 6,478_l._ per mile. On       examining the analysis of the distribution of these       railways among the States, it appears that this       discordance of the two statements is apparent rather       than real, and proceeds from the fact that the railways       opened since Dr. Lardner's report, being chiefly in the       southern and western States, are cheaply constructed       lines, in which the landed proprietors have given to a       great extent their gratuitous co-operation, and in       which the plant and working stock is of very small       amount, so that their average cost per mile is a little       under 4,000_l._--the average cost per mile in the       eastern and northern States corresponding almost to a       fraction with Dr. Lardner's estimate. It is also worthy       of observation that the distribution of this network of       railways is extremely unequal, not only in quantity,       but in its capability, as indicated by its expense of       construction. Thus, in the populous and wealthy States       of Massachusetts, New-Jersey, and New-York, the       proportion of railways to surface is considerable,       while in the southern and western States it is       trifling. In the following table is given the number of       miles of surface for each mile of railway in some of       the principal  States:--              Square miles of surface for each mile of railway.         Massachusetts       7       New-Jersey         22       New-York           28       Maryland           31       Ohio               58       Georgia            76         When it is considered that the railways in this country       have cost upon an average about 40,000_l._ per mile,       the comparatively low cost of the American railways       will doubtless appear extraordinary.         This circumstance, however, is explained partly by the       general character of the country, partly by the mode of       constructing the railways, and partly by the manner of       working them. With certain exceptions, few in number,       the tracts of country over which these lines are       carried, is nearly a dead level. Of earthwork there is       but little; of works of art, such as viaducts and       tunnels, commonly none. Where the railways are carried       over streams or rivers, bridges are constructed in a       rude but substantial manner of timber supplied from the       roadside forest, at no greater cost than that of hewing       it. The station houses, booking offices, and other       buildings, are likewise slight and cheaply constructed       of timber. On some of the best lines in the more       populous States the timber bridges are constructed with       stone pillars and abutments, supporting arches of       trusswork, the cost of such bridges varying from 46s.       per foot, for 60 feet span, to 6_l._ 10s. per foot for       200 feet span, for a single line, the cost on a double       line being 50 per cent. more.         When the railways strike the course of rivers such as       the Hudson, Delaware, or Susquehanna--too wide to be       crossed by bridges--the traffic is carried by steam       ferries. The management of these ferries is deserving       of notice. It is generally so arranged that the time of       crossing them corresponds with a meal of the       passengers. A platform is constructed level with the       line of railway and carried to the water's edge. Upon       this platform rails are laid by which the wagons which       bear the passengers' luggage and other matters of light       and rapid transport are rolled directly upon the upper       deck of the ferry boat, the passengers meanwhile going       under a covered way to the lower"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37937"],[0,"A Wanderer in Paris (#16)"],[1,"that  exquisite picture in the Liechtenstein Gallery in Vienna, when the  boys were a little older, is a beautiful and living thing which one  would not willingly miss.    Van Dyck was, of course, more austere, less boisterous and abundant,  but his record is hardly less amazing, and he seems to have faced  life-size equestrian groups, such as the Charles the First here,  without a tremor. The Charles is superb in his distinction and  disdain; but for me, however, Van Dyck is the painter of single  portraits, of which, no matter where I go, none seems more noble and  satisfying than our own Cornelius Van Voorst in Trafalgar Square. But  the \"Dame et sa Fille,\" which is reproduced on the opposite page, is  very beautiful.      [Illustration: UNE DAME ET SA FILLE      VAN DYCK      _(Louvre)_]    All round the Salle Rubens are arranged the little cabinets in which  the small Dutch pictures hang--the Jan Steens and the Terburgs, the  Hals' and the Metsus, the Ruisdaels and the Karel du Jardins, the  Ostades and the golden Poelenburghs. Of these what can I say? There  they are, in their hundreds, the least of them worth many minutes'  scrutiny. But a few may be picked out: the Jan van Eyck (No. 1986) \"La  Vierge au Donateur,\" reproduced opposite page 166, in which the  Chancellor Rollin reveres the Virgin on the roof of a tower, and small  wild animals happily play around, and we see in the distance one of  those little fairy cities so dear to the Flemish painter's  imagination; David's \"Noce de Cana\"; Metsu's \"Vierge et Enfant\" the  Memling and the Rogier van der Weyden, close by; Franz Hals'  \"Bohemienne,\" reproduced opposite page 186; Van der Heyden's lovely  \"Plaine de Haarlem\" (No. 2382); Paul Potter's \"Bois de La Haye\" (No.  2529), almost like a Diaz, and his little masterpiece No. 2526; the  Terburgs: the \"Music Lesson\" (No. 2588) and the charming \"Reading  Lesson\" (No. 2591) with the little touzled fair-haired boy in it,  reproduced opposite page 206; Ruisdael's \"Paysage dit le Coup de  Soleil\" (No. 2560); Hobbema's \"Moulin a eau\" (No. 2404); and, to my  eyes, almost first of all, Vermeer of Delft's \"Lacemaker\" (No. 2456),  reproduced opposite page 216. These are all I name.    So much for the paintings by the masters of the world. The Louvre also  has drawings from the same hands, which hang in their thousands in a  series of rooms on the first floor, overlooking the Rue de Rivoli.  Here, as I have said, are other Leonardos (look particularly at No.  389), and here, too, are drawings by Raphael and Rembrandt, Correggio  and Rubens (a child's head in particular), Domenico Ghirlandaio and  Chardin, Mantegna and Watteau, Duerer and Ingres. I reproduce only  one, a study attributed to the school of Fabriano, opposite page 228.  Here one may spend a month in daily visits and wish never to break the  habit. We have in England hardly less valuable and interesting  drawings, but they are not to be seen in this way. One must visit the  Print Room of the British Museum and ask for them one by one in  portfolios. The Louvre, I think, manages it better.          CHAPTER VII    THE LOUVRE: II. MODERN PICTURES         The Early French Painters--Richard Parkes       Bonington--Chardin--Historical Paintings--Bonington       again--The Moreau Collection--The Thomy-Thierret       Collection--The Chauchard Collection.      French pictures early and late now await us. On our way down the  Grande Galerie we passed on the right two entrances to other rooms.  Taking that one which is nearer the British School, we find ourselves  in Salle IX., leading to Salle X. and so on to Galerie XVI., which  completes the series. In Salle X. the beginnings of French art may be  studied, and in particular the curious Japanese effects of the Ecole  d'Avignon. Here also is very interesting work by Le Maitre de Moulins  and a remarkable series of drawings in the case in the middle,  representing the Siege of Troy. Salle XI. is notable for its portraits  by Clouet and others; in Salle XII. we find Le Sueur, and in Salle  XIII. the curious brothers Le Nain, of whom there are very interesting  examples at the Ionides collection at South Kensington, but nothing  better than the haymaking scene here, No. 542.    French painting of the seventeenth century bursts upon us in the great  Salle XIV. or Galerie Mollien, of which Nicolas Poussin and Ausonian  Claude are the giants, thus completing Landor's pleasant list with  which we entered the Grande Galerie in the last chapter. There are  wonderful things here, but so crowded are they that I always feel lost  and confused. There is, however, compensation and relief, for the room  also contains one minute masterpiece which perhaps not more than five  out of every thousand visitors have seen, and yet which can be studied  with perfect quietness and leisure. This is a tiny water-colour in the  revolving screen in the middle. There is much delicate work in this  screen, dainty aquatint effects by the Dutchmen Ostade and Van der  Heyden, Weenix and Borssom, and so forth; but finest of all (as so  often happens) is a little richly-coloured drawing of Nottingham by  Bonington, who, as we shall see, has a way of cropping up  unsuspectedly and graciously in this great collection--and very  rightly, since he owed so much to that Gallery. He was one of the  youngest students ever admitted, being allowed to copy there at the  age of fifteen, while at the Beaux Arts. That was in the year after  Waterloo. There may in the history of the Gallery have been copyists  equally young, but there can never have been one more distinguished or  who had deeper influence on French art. Paris not only made  Bonington's career but ended it, for it was while sketching in its  streets ten years or more later that he met with the sunstroke which  brought about his death when he was only twenty-seven, and stilled the  marvellous hand for ever.    Salle XV. is given up to portraits, among them--and shall I say chief  of them, certainly chief of them in point of popularity--the adorable  portrait of Madame Elizabeth Louise Vigee Le Brun and her daughter,  painted by herself, which is perhaps the best-known French picture,  and of which I give a reproduction opposite page 246. On a screen in  this room are placed the latest acquisitions. When last I was there  the more noticeable pictures were a portrait by Romney of himself,  rich and melancholy, recalling to the mind Tennyson's monologue, and a  sweet and ancient religieuse by Memling. There were also some Corot  drawings, not perhaps so good as those in the Moreau collection, but  very beautiful, and a charming old-world lady by Fragonard. These  probably are by this time distributed over the galleries, and other  new arrivals have taken their place. I hope so.    Galerie XVI., which leads out of the Salle des Portraits, brings us to  French art of the eighteenth century--to Greuze and David, to  Fragonard and Watteau, to Lancret and Boucher, and, to my mind, most  charming, most pleasure-giving of all, to Jean Baptiste Simeon  Chardin, who is to be seen in perfection here and in the distant room  which contains the Collection La Caze. It is probable that no painter  ever had quite so much charm as this kindly Frenchman, whose loving  task it was to sweeten and refine homely Dutch art. Chardin is the  most winsome of all painters: his brush laid a bloom on domestic life.  The Louvre has twenty-eight of his canvases, mostly still-life,  distributed between the Salle La Caze and Salle No. XVI., where we now  are. The most charming of all, which is to be seen in the Salle La  Caze, is reproduced opposite page 234.    Having walked down the left wall of the Salle, it is well to slip out  at the door at the end for a moment and refresh oneself with another  view of Botticelli's fresco, which is just outside, before returning  by the other wall, as we have to go back through the Salle des  Portraits in order to examine Salle VIII., a vast room wholly filled  with French paintings of the first half of the nineteenth century,  bringing the nation's art to the period more or less at which the  Luxembourg takes it up, though there is a certain amount of  overlapping. No room in the Louvre so wants weeding and re-hanging as  this, for it is a sad jumble. Search, however, for the magnificent  examples by the great _plein-airistes_. They are lost in this  wilderness; but there they are for those that seek--the two vast  Troyons; Corot's magic \"Souvenir de Castel-Gondolfon\"; a great  Daubigny, \"Les Vendances de Bourgogne,\" very hard and fine, and the  same gigantic painter's large and lovely harvest scene, \"Le Moisson\";  Rousseau's \"Sortie de Foret,\" not unlike the Rousseau in the Wallace  Collection in London, with its natural archway of branches and rich  tenderness of colour; the sublime \"La Vague,\" by Courbet; lastly  Millet's \"Les Glaneuses,\" the three stooping women in the cornfield  who come to the inward eye almost as readily as the figures in the  \"Angelus\". The red, blue and yellow of their head-kerchiefs alone  would make this picture worth a millionaire's ransom.    We leave the room by the door opposite that through which we came and  find ourselves again in the Grande Galerie. The way now is to the  left, through the Italian Schools, through the Salon Carre (why not  stay there and let French art go hang?) through the Galerie d'Apollon  (of which more anon), through the Rotunda and the Salle des Bijoux  (whither we shall return), to another crowded late eighteenth and  early nineteenth century French room chiefly notable for David's  Madame Recamier on her joyless little sofa. (Why didn't we stay in the  Salon Carre?) In this room also are two large Napoleonic pictures--one  by Gros representing General Bonaparte visiting the plague victims at  Jaffa in 1799; the other, by David, of the consecration service in  Notre Dame, described in an earlier chapter.
