Well, while Mombi was gone to the crooked  Sorcerer's, the boy made this pumpkin-headed man to amuse himself, and  also with the hope of frightening the Witch with it when she returned.  But Mombi was not scared, and she sprinkled the Pumpkinhead with her  Magic Powder of Life, to see if the Powder would work.  Ozma was  watching, and saw the Pumpkinhead come to life; so that night she took  the pepper-box containing the Powder and ran away with it and with  Jack, in search of adventures.    \"Next day they found a wooden Saw-Horse standing by the roadside, and  sprinkled it with the Powder.  It came to life at once, and Jack  Pumpkinhead rode the Saw-Horse to the Emerald City.\"    \"What became of the Saw-Horse, afterward?\" asked the shaggy man, much  interested in this story.    \"Oh, it's alive yet, and you will probably meet it presently in the  Emerald City.  Afterward, Ozma used the last of the Powder to bring the  Flying Gump to life; but as soon as it had carried her away from her  enemies the Gump was taken apart, so it doesn't exist any more.\"    \"It's too bad the Powder of Life was all used up,\" remarked the shaggy  man; \"it would be a handy thing to have around.\"    \"I am not so sure of that, sir,\" answered the Tin Woodman.  \"A while  ago the crooked Sorcerer who invented the Magic Powder fell down a  precipice and was killed.  All his possessions went to a relative--an  old woman named Dyna, who lives in the Emerald City.  She went to the  mountains where the Sorcerer had lived and brought away everything she  thought of value.  Among them was a small bottle of the Powder of Life;  but of course Dyna didn't know it was a Magic Powder, at all.  It  happened she had once had a big blue bear for a pet; but the bear  choked to death on a fishbone one day, and she loved it so dearly that  Dyna made a rug of its skin, leaving the head and four paws on the  hide.  She kept the rug on the floor of her front parlor.\"    \"I've seen rugs like that,\" said the shaggy man, nodding, \"but never  one made from a blue bear.\"    \"Well,\" continued the Tin Woodman, \"the old woman had an idea that the  Powder in the bottle must be moth-powder, because it smelled something  like moth-powder; so one day she sprinkled it on her bear rug to keep  the moths out of it.  She said, looking lovingly at the skin: 'I wish  my dear bear were alive again!'  To her horror, the bear rug at once  came to life, having been sprinkled with the Magic Powder; and now this  live bear rug is a great trial to her, and makes her a lot of trouble.\"    \"Why?\" asked the shaggy man.    \"Well, it stands up on its four feet and walks all around, and gets in  the way; and that spoils it for a rug.  It can't speak, although it is  alive; for, while its head might say words, it has no breath in a solid  body to push the words out of its mouth.  It's a very slimpsy affair  altogether, that bear rug, and the old woman is sorry it came to life.  Every day she has to scold it, and make it lie down flat on the parlor  floor to be walked upon; but sometimes when she goes to market the rug  will hump up its back skin, and stand on its four feet, and trot along  after her.\"    \"I should think Dyna would like that,\" said Dorothy.    \"Well, she doesn't; because every one knows it isn't a real bear, but  just a hollow skin, and so of no actual use in the world except for a  rug,\" answered the Tin Woodman.  \"Therefore I believe it is a good  thing that all the Magic Powder of Life is now used up, as it can not  cause any more trouble.\"    \"Perhaps you're right,\" said the shaggy man, thoughtfully.    At noon they stopped at a farmhouse, where it delighted the farmer and  his wife to be able to give them a good luncheon.  The farm people knew  Dorothy, having seen her when she was in the country before, and they  treated the little girl with as much respect as they did the Emperor,  because she was a friend of the powerful Princess Ozma.    They had not proceeded far after leaving this farm-house before coming  to a high bridge over a broad river.  This river, the Tin Woodman  informed them, was the boundary between the Country of the Winkies and  the territory of the Emerald City.  The city itself was still a long  way off, but all around it was a green meadow as pretty as a well-kept  lawn, and in this were neither houses nor farms to spoil the beauty of  the scene.    From the top of the high bridge they could see far away the magnificent  spires and splendid domes of the superb city, sparkling like brilliant  jewels as they towered above the emerald walls.  The shaggy man drew a  deep breath of awe and amazement, for never had he dreamed that such a  grand and beautiful place could exist--even in the fairyland of Oz.    Polly was so pleased that her violet eyes sparkled like amethysts, and  she danced away from her companions across the bridge and into a group  of feathery trees lining both the roadsides.  These trees she stopped  to look at with pleasure and surprise, for their leaves were shaped  like ostrich plumes, their feather edges beautifully curled; and all  the plumes were tinted in the same dainty rainbow hues that appeared in  Polychrome's own pretty gauze gown.    \"Father ought to see these trees,\" she murmured; \"they are almost as  lovely as his own rainbows.\"    Then she gave a start of terror, for beneath the trees came stalking  two great beasts, either one big enough to crush the little Daughter of  the Rainbow with one blow of his paws, or to eat her up with one snap  of his enormous jaws.  One was a tawny lion, as tall as a horse,  nearly; the other a striped tiger almost the same size.    Polly was too frightened to scream or to stir; she stood still with a  wildly beating heart until Dorothy rushed past her and with a glad cry  threw her arms around the huge lion's neck, hugging and kissing the  beast with evident joy.    \"Oh, I'm SO glad to see you again!\" cried the little Kansas girl.  \"And  the Hungry Tiger, too!  How fine you're both looking.  Are you well and  happy?\"    \"We certainly are, Dorothy,\" answered the Lion, in a deep voice that  sounded pleasant and kind; \"and we are greatly pleased that you have  come to Ozma's party.  It's going to be a grand affair, I promise you.\"    \"There will be lots of fat babies at the celebration, I hear,\" remarked  the Hungry Tiger, yawning so that his mouth opened dreadfully wide and  showed all his big, sharp teeth; \"but of course I can't eat any of 'em.\"    \"Is your Conscience still in good order?\" asked Dorothy, anxiously.    \"Yes; it rules me like a tyrant,\" answered the Tiger, sorrowfully.  \"I  can imagine nothing more unpleasant than to own a Conscience,\" and he  winked slyly at his friend the Lion.    \"You're fooling me!\" said Dorothy, with a laugh.  \"I don't b'lieve  you'd eat a baby if you lost your Conscience.  Come here, Polly,\" she  called, \"and be introduced to my friends.\"    Polly advanced rather shyly.    \"You have some queer friends, Dorothy,\" she said.    \"The queerness doesn't matter so long as they're friends,\" was the  answer.  \"This is the Cowardly Lion, who isn't a coward at all, but  just thinks he is.  The Wizard gave him some courage once, and he has  part of it left.\"    The Lion bowed with great dignity to Polly.    \"You are very lovely, my dear,\" said he.  \"I hope we shall be friends  when we are better acquainted.\"    \"And this is the Hungry Tiger,\" continued Dorothy.  \"He says he longs  to eat fat babies; but the truth is he is never hungry at all, 'cause  he gets plenty to eat; and I don't s'pose he'd hurt anybody even if he  WAS hungry.\"    \"Hush, Dorothy,\" whispered the Tiger; \"you'll ruin my reputation if you  are not more discreet.  It isn't what we are, but what folks think we  are, that counts in this world.  And come to think of it Miss Polly  would make a fine variegated breakfast, I'm sure.\"          18.  The Emerald City      The others now came up, and the Tin Woodman greeted the Lion and the  Tiger cordially.  Button-Bright yelled with fear when Dorothy first  took his hand and led him toward the great beasts; but the girl  insisted they were kind and good, and so the boy mustered up courage  enough to pat their heads; after they had spoken to him gently and he  had looked into their intelligent eyes his fear vanished entirely and  he was so delighted with the animals that he wanted to keep close to  them and stroke their soft fur every minute.    As for the shaggy man, he might have been afraid if he had met the  beasts alone, or in any other country, but so many were the marvels in;  the Land of Oz that he was no longer easily surprised, and Dorothy's  friendship for the Lion and Tiger was enough to assure him they were  safe companions.  Toto barked at the Cowardly Lion in joyous greeting,  for he knew the beast of old and loved him, and it was funny to see how  gently the Lion raised his huge paw to pat Toto's head.  The little dog  smelled of the Tiger's nose, and the Tiger politely shook paws with  him; so they were quite likely to become firm friends.    Tik-tok and Billina knew the beasts well, so merely bade them good day  and asked after their healths and inquired about the Princess Ozma.    Now it was seen that the Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger were  drawing behind them a splendid golden chariot, to which they were  harnessed by golden cords.  The body of the chariot was decorated on  the outside with designs in clusters of sparkling emeralds, while  inside it was lined with a green and gold satin, and the cushions of  the seats were of green plush embroidered in gold with a crown,  underneath which was a monogram.    \"Why, it's Ozma's own royal chariot!\" exclaimed Dorothy.    \"Yes,\" said the Cowardly Lion; \"Ozma sent us to meet you here, for she  feared you would be weary with your long walk and she wished you to  enter the City in a style "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/486"],[0,"Ozma of Oz (#16)"],[1,"enough.  There is neither night nor day in my kingdom,  because it is under the earth's surface, where the sun does not shine.  But we have to sleep, just the same as the up-stairs people do, and for  my part I'm going to bed in a few minutes.\"    Indeed, it was not long after this that the private made his last  guess.  Of course he guessed wrongly, and of course he at once became  an ornament.  So the King was greatly pleased, and clapped his hands to  summon his Chief Steward.    \"Show these guests to some of the sleeping apartments,\" he commanded,  \"and be quick about it, too, for I'm dreadfully sleepy myself.\"    \"You've no business to sit up so late,\" replied the Steward, gruffly.  \"You'll be as cross as a griffin tomorrow morning.\"    His Majesty made no answer to this remark, and the Chief Steward led  Dorothy through another doorway into a long hall, from which several  plain but comfortable sleeping rooms opened.  The little girl was given  the first room, and the Scarecrow and Tiktok the next--although they  never slept--and the Lion and the Tiger the third.  The Sawhorse  hobbled after the Steward into a fourth room, to stand stiffly in the  center of it until morning.  Each night was rather a bore to the  Scarecrow, Tiktok and the Sawhorse; but they had learned from  experience to pass the time patiently and quietly, since all their  friends who were made of flesh had to sleep and did not like to be  disturbed.    When the Chief Steward had left them alone the Scarecrow remarked,  sadly:    \"I am in great sorrow over the loss of my old comrade, the Tin Woodman.  We have had many dangerous adventures together, and escaped them all,  and now it grieves me to know he has become an ornament, and is lost to  me forever.\"    \"He was al-ways an or-na-ment to so-ci-e-ty,\" said Tiktok.    \"True; but now the Nome King laughs at him, and calls him the funniest  ornament in all the palace.  It will hurt my poor friend's pride to be  laughed at,\" continued the Scarecrow, sadly.    \"We will make rath-er ab-surd or-na-ments, our-selves, to-mor-row,\"  observed the machine, in his monotonous voice.    Just then Dorothy ran into their room, in a state of great anxiety,  crying:    \"Where's Billina?  Have you seen Billina?  Is she here?\"    \"No,\" answered the Scarecrow.    \"Then what has become of her?\" asked the girl.    \"Why, I thought she was with you,\" said the Scarecrow.  \"Yet I do not  remember seeing the yellow hen since she picked up the crumbs of cake.\"    \"We must have left her in the room where the King's throne is,\" decided  Dorothy, and at once she turned and ran down the hall to the door  through which they had entered.  But it was fast closed and locked on  the other side, and the heavy slab of rock proved to be so thick that  no sound could pass through it.  So Dorothy was forced to return to her  chamber.    The Cowardly Lion stuck his head into her room to try to console the  girl for the loss of her feathered friend.    \"The yellow hen is well able to take care of herself,\" said he; \"so  don't worry about her, but try to get all the sleep you can.  It has  been a long and weary day, and you need rest.\"    \"I'll prob'ly get lots of rest tomorrow, when I become an orn'ment,\"  said Dorothy, sleepily.  But she lay down upon her couch, nevertheless,  and in spite of all her worries was soon in the land of dreams.          14.  Dorothy Tries to be Brave      Meantime the Chief Steward had returned to the throne room, where he  said to the King:    \"You are a fool to waste so much time upon these people.\"    \"What!\" cried his Majesty, in so enraged a voice that it awoke Billina,  who was asleep under his throne.  \"How dare you call me a fool?\"    \"Because I like to speak the truth,\" said the Steward.  \"Why didn't you  enchant them all at once, instead of allowing them to go one by one  into the palace and guess which ornaments are the Queen of Ev and her  children?\"    \"Why, you stupid rascal, it is more fun this way,\" returned the King,  \"and it serves to keep me amused for a long time.\"    \"But suppose some of them happen to guess aright,\" persisted the  Steward; \"then you would lose your old ornaments and these new ones,  too.\"    \"There is no chance of their guessing aright,\" replied the monarch,  with a laugh.  \"How could they know that the Queen of Ev and her family  are all ornaments of a royal purple color?\"    \"But there are no other purple ornaments in the palace,\" said the  Steward.    \"There are many other colors, however, and the purple ones are  scattered throughout the rooms, and are of many different shapes and  sizes.  Take my word for it, Steward, they will never think of choosing  the purple ornaments.\"    Billina, squatting under the throne, had listened carefully to all this  talk, and now chuckled softly to herself as she heard the King disclose  his secret.    \"Still, you are acting foolishly by running the chance,\" continued the  Steward, roughly; \"and it is still more foolish of you to transform all  those people from Oz into green ornaments.\"    \"I did that because they came from the Emerald City,\" replied the King;  \"and I had no green ornaments in my collection until now.  I think they  will look quite pretty, mixed with the others.  Don't you?\"    The Steward gave an angry grunt.    \"Have your own way, since you are the King,\" he growled.  \"But if you  come to grief through your carelessness, remember that I told you so.  If I wore the magic belt which enables you to work all your  transformations, and gives you so much other power, I am sure I would  make a much wiser and better King than you are.\"    \"Oh, cease your tiresome chatter!\" commanded the King, getting angry  again.  \"Because you are my Chief Steward you have an idea you can  scold me as much as you please.  But the very next time you become  impudent, I will send you to work in the furnaces, and get another Nome  to fill your place.  Now follow me to my chamber, for I am going to  bed.  And see that I am wakened early tomorrow morning.  I want to  enjoy the fun of transforming the rest of these people into ornaments.\"    \"What color will you make the Kansas girl?\" asked the Steward.    \"Gray, I think,\" said his Majesty.    \"And the Scarecrow and the machine man?\"    \"Oh, they shall be of solid gold, because they are so ugly in real  life.\"    Then the voices died away, and Billina knew that the King and his  Steward had left the room.  She fixed up some of her tail feathers that  were not straight, and then tucked her head under her wing again and  went to sleep.    In the morning Dorothy and the Lion and Tiger were given their  breakfast in their rooms, and afterward joined the King in his throne  room.  The Tiger complained bitterly that he was half starved, and  begged to go into the palace and become an ornament, so that he would  no longer suffer the pangs of hunger.    \"Haven't you had your breakfast?\" asked the Nome King.    \"Oh, I had just a bite,\" replied the beast.  \"But what good is a bite,  to a hungry tiger?\"    \"He ate seventeen bowls of porridge, a platter full of fried sausages,  eleven loaves of bread and twenty-one mince pies,\" said the Steward.    \"What more do you want?\" demanded the King.    \"A fat baby.  I want a fat baby,\" said the Hungry Tiger.  \"A nice,  plump, juicy, tender, fat baby.  But, of course, if I had one, my  conscience would not allow me to eat it.  So I'll have to be an  ornament and forget my hunger.\"    \"Impossible!\" exclaimed the King.  \"I'll have no clumsy beasts enter my  palace, to overturn and break all my pretty nick-nacks.  When the rest  of your friends are transformed you can return to the upper world, and  go about your business.\"    \"As for that, we have no business, when our friends are gone,\" said the  Lion.  \"So we do not care much what becomes of us.\"    Dorothy begged to be allowed to go first into the palace, but Tiktok  firmly maintained that the slave should face danger before the  mistress.  The Scarecrow agreed with him in that, so the Nome King  opened the door for the machine man, who tramped into the palace to  meet his fate.  Then his Majesty returned to his throne and puffed his  pipe so contentedly that a small cloud of smoke formed above his head.    Bye and bye he said:    \"I'm sorry there are so few of you left.  Very soon, now, my fun will  be over, and then for amusement I shall have nothing to do but admire  my new ornaments.\"    \"It seems to me,\" said Dorothy, \"that you are not so honest as you  pretend to be.\"    \"How's that?\" asked the King.    \"Why, you made us think it would be easy to guess what ornaments the  people of Ev were changed into.\"    \"It IS easy,\" declared the monarch, \"if one is a good guesser.  But it  appears that the members of your party are all poor guessers.\"    \"What is Tiktok doing now?\" asked the girl, uneasily.    \"Nothing,\" replied the King, with a frown.  \"He is standing perfectly  still, in the middle of a room.\"    \"Oh, I expect he's run down,\" said Dorothy.  \"I forgot to wind him up  this morning.  How many guesses has he made?\"    \"All that he is allowed except one,\" answered the King.  \"Suppose you  go in and wind him up, and then you can stay there and make your own  guesses.\"    \"All right,\" said Dorothy.    \"It is my turn next,\" declared the Scarecrow.    \"Why, you don't want to go away and leave me all alone, do you?\" asked  the girl.  \"Besides, if I go now I can wind up Tiktok, so that he can  make his last guess.\"    \"Very well, then,\" said the Scarecrow, with a sigh.  \"Run along, little  Dorothy, and may good luck go with you!\"    So Dorothy, trying to be brave in spite of her fears, passed through  the doorway into the gorgeous rooms of the palace.  The stillness of  the place awed her, at first, and the child drew short breaths, and  pressed her hand to her heart, and looked all around with wondering  eyes.    Yes, it was a beautiful place; but enchantments lurked in every nook  and corner,"]]]
