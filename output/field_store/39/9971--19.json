Titanic: Its Story and Its Lessons (#16)"],[1,"some from taking to the  boats was the drop to the water below and the journey into the unknown  sea: certainly it looked a tremendous way down in the darkness, the  sea and the night both seemed very cold and lonely; and here was the  ship, so firm and well lighted and warm.    But perhaps what made so many people declare their decision to remain  was their strong belief in the theory of the Titanic's unsinkable  construction. Again and again was it repeated, \"This ship cannot sink;  it is only a question of waiting until another ship comes up and takes  us off.\" Husbands expected to follow their wives and join them either  in New York or by transfer in mid-ocean from steamer to steamer. Many  passengers relate that they were told by officers that the ship was a  lifeboat and could not go down; one lady affirms that the captain told  her the Titanic could not sink for two or three days; no doubt this  was immediately after the collision.    It is not any wonder, then, that many elected to remain, deliberately  choosing the deck of the Titanic to a place in a lifeboat. And yet the  boats had to go down, and so at first they went half-full: this is the  real explanation of why they were not as fully loaded as the later  ones. It is important then to consider the question how far the  captain was justified in withholding all the knowledge he had from  every passenger. From one point of view he should have said to them,  \"This ship will sink in a few hours: there are the boats, and only  women and children can go to them.\" But had he the authority to  enforce such an order? There are such things as panics and rushes  which get beyond the control of a handful of officers, even if armed,  and where even the bravest of men get swept off their feet--mentally  as well as physically.    On the other hand, if he decided to withhold all definite knowledge of  danger from all passengers and at the same time persuade--and if it  was not sufficient, compel--women and children to take to the boats,  it might result in their all being saved. He could not foresee the  tenacity of their faith in the boat: there is ample evidence that he  left the bridge when the ship had come to rest and went among  passengers urging them to get into the boat and rigorously excluding  all but women and children. Some would not go. Officer Lowe testified  that he shouted, \"Who's next for the boat?\" and could get no replies.  The boats even were sent away half-loaded,--although the fear of their  buckling in the middle was responsible as well for this,--but the  captain with the few boats at his disposal could hardly do more than  persuade and advise in the terrible circumstances in which he was  placed.    How appalling to think that with a few more boats--and the ship was  provided with that particular kind of davit that would launch more  boats--there would have been no decision of that kind to make! It  could have been stated plainly: \"This ship will sink in a few hours:  there is room in the boats for all passengers, beginning with women  and children.\"    Poor Captain Smith! I care not whether the responsibility for such  speed in iceberg regions will rest on his shoulders or not: no man  ever had to make such a choice as he had that night, and it seems  difficult to see how he can be blamed for withholding from passengers  such information as he had of the danger that was imminent.    When one reads in the Press that lifeboats arrived at the Carpathia  half full, it seems at first sight a dreadful thing that this should  have been allowed to happen; but it is so easy to make these  criticisms afterwards, so easy to say that Captain Smith should have  told everyone of the condition of the vessel. He was faced with many  conditions that night which such criticism overlooks. Let any  fair-minded person consider some few of the problems presented to  him--the ship was bound to sink in a few hours; there was lifeboat  accommodation for all women and children and some men; there was no  way of getting some women to go except by telling them the ship was  doomed, a course he deemed it best not to take; and he knew the danger  of boats buckling when loaded full. His solution of these problems was  apparently the following:--to send the boats down half full, with such  women as would go, and to tell the boats to stand by to pick up more  passengers passed down from the cargo ports. There is good evidence  that this was part of the plan: I heard an officer give the order to  four boats and a lady in number 4 boat on the port side tells me the  sailors were so long looking for the port where the captain personally  had told them to wait, that they were in danger of being sucked under  by the vessel. How far any systematic attempt was made to stand by the  ports, I do not know: I never saw one open or any boat standing near  on the starboard side; but then, boats 9 to 15 went down full, and on  reaching the sea rowed away at once. There is good evidence, then,  that Captain Smith fully intended to load the boats full in this way.  The failure to carry out the intention is one of the things the whole  world regrets, but consider again the great size of the ship and the  short time to make decisions, and the omission is more easily  understood. The fact is that such a contingency as lowering away boats  was not even considered beforehand, and there is much cause for  gratitude that as many as seven hundred and five people were rescued.  The whole question of a captain's duties seems to require revision. It  was totally impossible for any one man to attempt to control the ship  that night, and the weather conditions could not well have been more  favourable for doing so. One of the reforms that seem inevitable is  that one man shall be responsible for the boats, their manning,  loading and lowering, leaving the captain free to be on the bridge to  the last moment.    But to return for a time to the means taken to attract the notice of  other ships. The wireless operators were now in touch with several  ships, and calling to them to come quickly for the water was pouring  in and the Titanic beginning to go down by the head. Bride testified  that the first reply received was from a German boat, the Frankfurt,  which was: \"All right: stand by,\" but not giving her position. From  comparison of the strength of signals received from the Frankfurt and  from other boats, the operators estimated the Frankfurt was the  nearest; but subsequent events proved that this was not so. She was,  in fact, one hundred and forty miles away and arrived at 10.50 A.M.  next morning, when the Carpathia had left with the rescued. The next  reply was from the Carpathia, fifty-eight miles away on the outbound  route to the Mediterranean, and it was a prompt and welcome  one--\"Coming hard,\" followed by the position. Then followed the  Olympic, and with her they talked for some time, but she was five  hundred and sixty miles away on the southern route, too far to be of  any immediate help. At the speed of 23 knots she would expect to be up  about 1 P.M. next day, and this was about the time that those in boat  13 had calculated. We had always assumed in the boat that the stokers  who gave this information had it from one of the officers before they  left; but in the absence of any knowledge of the much nearer ship, the  Carpathia, it is more probable that they knew in a general way where  the sister ship, the Olympic, should be, and had made a rough  calculation.    Other ships in touch by wireless were the Mount Temple, fifty miles;  the Birma, one hundred miles; the Parisian, one hundred and fifty  miles; the Virginian, one hundred and fifty miles; and the Baltic,  three hundred miles. But closer than any of these--closer even than  the Carpathia--were two ships: the Californian, less than twenty miles  away, with the wireless operator off duty and unable to catch the  \"C.Q.D.\" signal which was now making the air for many miles around  quiver in its appeal for help--immediate, urgent help--for the  hundreds of people who stood on the Titanic's deck.    The second vessel was a small steamer some few miles ahead on the port  side, without any wireless apparatus, her name and destination still  unknown; and yet the evidence for her presence that night seems too  strong to be disregarded. Mr. Boxhall states that he and Captain Smith  saw her quite plainly some five miles away, and could distinguish the  mast-head lights and a red port light. They at once hailed her with  rockets and Morse electric signals, to which Boxhall saw no reply, but  Captain Smith and stewards affirmed they did. The second and third  officers saw the signals sent and her lights, the latter from the  lifeboat of which he was in charge. Seaman Hopkins testified that he  was told by the captain to row for the light; and we in boat 13  certainly saw it in the same position and rowed towards it for some  time. But notwithstanding all the efforts made to attract its  attention, it drew slowly away and the lights sank below the horizon.    The pity of it! So near, and so many people waiting for the shelter  its decks could have given so easily. It seems impossible to think  that this ship ever replied to the signals: those who said so must  have been mistaken. The United State Senate Committee in its report  does not hesitate to say that this unknown steamer and the Californian  are identical, and that the failure on the part of the latter to come  to the help of the Titanic is culpable negligence. There is undoubted  evidence that some of the crew on the Californian saw our rockets; but  it seems impossible to believe that the captain and officers knew of  our distress and deliberately ignored it. Judgment on the matter had  better be suspended until further information is forthcoming. An  engineer who has served in the trans-Atlantic service tells me that it  is a common practice for small boats to leave the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6684"],[0,"Uneasy Money (#16)"],[1,"want to catch the next train. You  will save our lives--mine and Nutty's too. Oh, dear, you're  hesitating! You're trying to think up some polite way of getting  out of the place! You mustn't go, Mr Chalmers; you simply must  stay. There aren't any mosquitoes, no jellyfish--nothing! At  least, there are; but what do they matter? You don't mind them. Do  you play golf?'    'Yes.'    'There are links here. You can't go until you've tried them. What  is your handicap?'    'Plus two.'    'So is mine.'    'By Jove! Really?'    Elizabeth looked at him, her eyes dancing.    'Why, we're practically twin souls, Mr Chalmers! Tell me, I know  your game is nearly perfect, but if you have a fault, is it a  tendency to putt too hard?'    'Why, by Jove--yes, it is!'    'I knew it. Something told me. It's the curse of my life too!  Well, after that you can't go away.'    'But if I'm in the way--'    'In the way! Mr Chalmers, will you come in now and help me wash  the breakfast things?'    'Rather!' said Lord Dawlish.          10      In the days that followed their interrupted love-scene at  Reigelheimer's Restaurant that night of Lord Dawlish's unfortunate  encounter with the tray-bearing waiter, Dudley Pickering's  behaviour had perplexed Claire Fenwick. She had taken it for  granted that next day at the latest he would resume the offer of  his hand, heart, and automobiles. But time passed and he made no  move in that direction. Of limousine bodies, carburettors,  spark-plugs, and inner tubes he spoke with freedom and eloquence,  but the subject of love and marriage he avoided absolutely. His  behaviour was inexplicable.    Claire was piqued. She was in the position of a hostess who has  swept and garnished her house against the coming of a guest and  waits in vain for that guest's arrival. She made up her mind what  to do when Dudley Pickering proposed to her next time, and  thereby, it seemed to her, had removed all difficulties in the  way of that proposal. She little knew her Pickering!    Dudley Pickering was not a self-starter in the motordrome of love.  He needed cranking. He was that most unpromising of matrimonial  material, a shy man with a cautious disposition. If he overcame  his shyness, caution applied the foot-brake. If he succeeded in  forgetting caution, shyness shut off the gas. At Reigelheimer's  some miracle had made him not only reckless but un-self-conscious.  Possibly the Dream of Psyche had gone to his head. At any rate, he  had been on the very verge of proposing to Claire when the  interruption had occurred, and in bed that night, reviewing the  affair, he had been appalled at the narrowness of his escape from  taking a definite step. Except in the way of business, he was a  man who hated definite steps. He never accepted even a dinner  invitation without subsequent doubts and remorse. The consequence  was that, in the days that followed the Reigelheimer episode, what  Lord Wetherby would have called the lamp of love burned rather low  in Mr Pickering, as if the acetylene were running out. He still  admired Claire intensely and experienced disturbing emotions when  he beheld her perfect tonneau and wonderful headlights; but he  regarded her with a cautious fear. Although he sometimes dreamed  sentimentally of marriage in the abstract, of actual marriage, of  marriage with a flesh-and-blood individual, of marriage that  involved clergymen and 'Voices that Breathe o'er Eden,' and  giggling bridesmaids and cake, Dudley Pickering was afraid with a  terror that woke him sweating in the night. His shyness shrank  from the ceremony, his caution jibbed at the mysteries of married  life. So his attitude toward Claire, the only girl who had  succeeded in bewitching him into the opening words of an actual  proposal, was a little less cordial and affectionate than if she  had been a rival automobile manufacturer.    Matters were in this state when Lady Wetherby, who, having danced  classical dances for three months without a break, required a  rest, shifted her camp to the house which she had rented for the  summer at Brookport, Long Island, taking with her Algie, her  husband, the monkey Eustace, and Claire and Mr Pickering, her  guests. The house was a large one, capable of receiving a big  party, but she did not wish to entertain on an ambitious scale.  The only other guest she proposed to put up was Roscoe Sherriff,  her press agent, who was to come down as soon as he could get away  from his metropolitan duties.    It was a pleasant and romantic place, the estate which Lady  Wetherby had rented. Standing on a hill, the house looked down  through green trees on the gleaming waters of the bay. Smooth  lawns and shady walks it had, and rustic seats beneath spreading  cedars. Yet for all its effect on Dudley Pickering it might have  been a gasworks. He roamed the smooth lawns with Claire, and sat  with her on the rustic benches and talked guardedly of lubricating  oil. There were moments when Claire was almost impelled to forfeit  whatever chance she might have had of becoming mistress of thirty  million dollars and a flourishing business, for the satisfaction  of administering just one whole-hearted slap on his round and  thinly-covered head.    And then Roscoe Sherriff came down, and Dudley Pickering, who for  days had been using all his resolution to struggle against the  siren, suddenly found that there was no siren to struggle against.  No sooner had the press agent appeared than Claire deserted him  shamelessly and absolutely. She walked with Roscoe Sherriff. Mr  Pickering experienced the discomfiting emotions of the man who  pushes violently against an abruptly-yielding door, or treads  heavily on the top stair where there is no top stair. He was  shaken, and the clamlike stolidity which he had assumed as  protection gave way.    Night had descended upon Brookport. Eustace, the monkey, was in  his little bed; Lord Wetherby in the smoking-room. It was Sunday,  the day of rest. Dinner was over, and the remainder of the party  were gathered in the drawing-room, with the exception of Mr  Pickering, who was smoking a cigar on the porch. A full moon  turned Long Island into a fairyland.    Gloom had settled upon Dudley Pickering and he smoked sadly. All  rather stout automobile manufacturers are sad when there is a full  moon. It makes them feel lonely. It stirs their hearts to thoughts  of love. Marriage loses its terrors for them, and they think  wistfully of hooking some fair woman up the back and buying her  hats. Such was the mood of Mr Pickering, when through the dimness  of the porch there appeared a white shape, moving softly toward  him.    'Is that you, Mr Pickering?'    Claire dropped into the seat beside him. From the drawing-room  came the soft tinkle of a piano. The sound blended harmoniously  with the quiet peace of the night. Mr Pickering let his cigar go  out and clutched the sides of his chair.        Oi'll--er--sing thee saw-ongs ov Arrabee,        Und--ah ta-ales of farrr Cash-mee-eere,      Wi-ild tales to che-eat thee ovasigh        Und charrrrm thee to-oo a tear-er.    Claire gave a little sigh.    'What a beautiful voice Mr Sherriff has!'    Dudley Pickering made no reply. He thought Roscoe Sherriff had a  beastly voice. He resented Roscoe Sherriff's voice. He objected to  Roscoe Sherriff's polluting this fair night with his cacophony.    'Don't you think so, Mr Pickering?'    'Uh-huh.'    'That doesn't sound very enthusiastic. Mr Pickering, I want you to  tell me something. Have I done anything to offend you?'    Mr Pickering started violently.    'Eh?'    'I have seen so little of you these last few days. A little while  ago we were always together, having such interesting talks. But  lately it has seemed to me that you have been avoiding me.'    A feeling of helplessness swept over Mr Pickering. He was vaguely  conscious of a sense of being treated unjustly, of there being a  flaw in Claire's words somewhere if he could only find it, but the  sudden attack had deprived him of the free and unfettered use of  his powers of reasoning. He gurgled wordlessly, and Claire went  on, her low, sad voice mingling with the moonlight in a manner  that caused thrills to run up and down his spine. He felt  paralyzed. Caution urged him to make some excuse and follow it  with a bolt to the drawing-room, but he was physically incapable  of taking the excellent advice. Sometimes when you are out in your  Pickering Gem or your Pickering Giant the car hesitates, falters,  and stops dead, and your chauffeur, having examined the carburettor,  turns to you and explains the phenomenon in these words: 'The  mixture is too rich.' So was it with Mr Pickering now. The moonlight  alone might not have held him; Claire's voice alone might not have  held him; but against the two combined he was powerless. The  mixture was too rich. He sat and breathed a little stertorously,  and there came to him that conviction that comes to all of us now  and then, that we are at a crisis of our careers and that the  moment through which we are living is a moment big with fate.    The voice in the drawing-room stopped. Having sung songs of Araby  and tales of far Cashmere, Mr Roscoe Sherriff was refreshing  himself with a comic paper. But Lady Wetherby, seated at the  piano, still touched the keys softly, and the sound increased the  richness of the mixture which choked Dudley Pickering's spiritual  carburettor. It is not fair that a rather stout manufacturer  should be called upon to sit in the moonlight while a beautiful  girl, to the accompaniment of soft music, reproaches him with  having avoided her.    'I should be so sorry, Mr Pickering, if I had done anything to  make a difference between us--'    'Eh?' said Mr Pickering.    'I have so few real friends over here.'    Claire's voice trembled.    'I--I get a little lonely, a little homesick sometimes--'    She paused, musing, and a spasm of pity rent the bosom beneath  "]]]
