Campbell       arrived, with his command, from the Meadows; on his return, he       advised me that he had received orders, for his command       entire, to return to Camp Floyd; the General having received       orders from Washington that the military should not be used in       protecting the courts, or in acting as a _posse_ to aid the       Marshal in making arrests.         \"While at Cedar City I was visited by a number of apostate       Mormons, who gave me every assurance that they would furnish       an abundance of evidence in regard to the matter so soon as       they were assured of military protection. In fact, some of the       persons engaged in the act came to see me in the night, and       gave a full account of the matter,--intending when protection       was at hand, to become witnesses. They claimed that they had       been forced into the matter by the bishops. Their statements       corroborated what the Indians had previously said to me. Mr.       Rodgers, the Deputy Marshal, was also engaged in hunting up       the children, survivors of the massacre. They were all found       in the custody of the Mormons. Three or four of the eldest       recollect and relate all the incidents of the massacre,       corroborating the statements of the Indians, and the       statements made by the citizens of Cedar City to me.         \"These children are now in the south part of Missouri, or       north part of Arkansas; their testimony could soon be taken,       if desired. No one can depict the glee of these infants, when       they realized that they, were in the custody of what they       called 'the Americans,'--for such is the designation of those       not Mormons. They say they never were in the custody of the       Indians. I recollect of one of them, 'John Calvin Sorrow,'       after he found he was safe, and before he was brought away       from Salt Lake City, although not yet nine years of age,       sitting in a contemplative mood, no doubt thinking of the       extermination of his family, saying: 'Oh, I wish I was a man;       I know what I would do; I would shoot John D. Lee; I saw him       shoot my mother.' I shall never forget how he looked.         \"Time will not permit me to elaborate the matter. I shall       barely sum up, and refer every member of this House, who may       have the least doubt about the guilt of the Mormons in this       massacre, and the other crimes to which I have alluded, to the       evidence published in the appendix hereto.\"    To the foregoing thrilling recital, I will only add:--The train  consisted of 40 wagons, 800 head of cattle, and about 60 horses and  mules. As near as can be ascertained, there were about 150 men and  women, besides many children. They passed through Salt Lake City, and  were there joined by some few Mormons, who were disaffected, and sought  to travel under their protection.    A revelation from Brigham Young, as Great Grand Archee, or God, was  despatched to President J. C. Haight, Bishop Higbee, and J. D. Lee,  commanding them to raise all the forces they could muster and trust,  follow those cursed gentiles (so read the revelation), attack them,  disguised as Indians, and with the arrows of the Almighty make a clean  sweep of them, and leave none to tell the tale; and if they needed any  assistance, they were commanded to hire the Indians as their allies,  promising them a share of the booty. They were to be neither slothful  nor negligent in their duty, and to be punctual in sending the teams  back to him before winter set in, for this was the mandate of Almighty  God.    On the following day a council of all the faithful was held at Cedar  City. Many attended from the neighboring settlements; the revelation was  read, and the destiny of the unsuspecting emigrants sealed. Plans were  suggested, discussed, and adopted, and the men designated to carry out  their hellish designs. Instructions were given for them to assemble at a  small spring, but a short distance to the left of the road leading into  the Meadows,--a number of intervening hills rendering it a fit place for  concealment. Here they painted and disguised themselves as Indians, and  when ready to commence operations, by a well-known Indian trail  proceeded to the Meadows.    For the benefit of those who may still be disposed to doubt the guilt of  Young and his Mormons in this transaction, the testimony is here  collated, and circumstances given, which go, not merely to implicate,  but to fasten conviction upon them, by \"confirmations strong as proofs  from Holy Writ.\"    1. The evidence of Mormons themselves, engaged in the affair, as shown  by the statements of Judge Cradlebaugh and Deputy-Marshal Rodgers.    2. The statements of Indians in the neighborhood of the massacre: these  statements are shown, not only by Cradlebaugh and Rodgers, but by a  number of military officers, and by J. Forney, who was, in 1859,  Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Territory. To all these were  such statements freely and frequently made by the Indians.    3. The testimony of the children saved from the massacre.    4. The children and the property of the emigrants found in possession of  the Mormons, and that possession traced back to the very day after the  massacre.    5. The failure of Brigham Young to embody any account of it in his  Report as Superintendent of Indian Affairs. Also his failure to make any  allusion to it whatever from the pulpit, until several years after the  occurrence.    6. The failure of the \"Deseret News,\" the Church organ, and the only  paper then published in the Territory, to notice the massacre, until  several months afterward, and then only to deny that Mormons were  engaged in it.    7. The flight to the mountains of men high in authority in the Mormon  Church and State, when this affair was brought to the ordeal of a  judicial investigation.    8. The testimony of R. P. Campbell, Capt. 2d Dragoons, who was sent in  the spring of 1859 to Santa Clara, to protect travellers on the road to  California, and to inquire into Indian depredations.    In his report to Major E. J. Potter, Assistant Adjutant-General U. S.  Army, dated July 6, 1859, he says:--         \"These emigrants were here met by the Mormons (assisted by       such of the wretched Indians of the neighborhood as they could       force or persuade to join), and massacred, with the exception       of such infant children as the Mormons thought too young to       remember, or tell of the affair.         \"The Mormons were led on by John D. Lee, then a high dignitary       in the self-styled Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day       Saints, and Isaac Haight, now a dignitary in the same.\"    Again, after relating briefly the massacre, he says:--         \"These facts were derived from children who did remember, and       could tell of the matter; from Indians, and from the Mormons       themselves.\"    9. The testimony of Hon. J. Forney, Superintendent of Indian Affairs.    In his letter to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs at Washington, dated  Provo City, U. T., March, 1859, he says:--         \"Facts in my possession warrant me in estimating that there       was distributed, a few days after the massacre, among the       leading church dignitaries, $30,000 worth of property.\"    Again, in another letter to the Commissioner, written from Great Salt  Lake City, in August of the same year, he says:--         \"From the evidence in my possession, I am justified in the       declaration that this massacre was concocted by white men, and       consummated by whites and Indians. The names of many of the       whites engaged in this terrible affair have already been given       to the proper legal authorities. . . . The children were sold       out to different persons in Cedar City, Harmony, and Painter       Creek. Bills are now in my possession from different       individuals, asking payment from the Government. I cannot       condescend to become the medium of even transmitting such       claims to the Department.\"    The following is from the Annual Report of Superintendent Forney, made  in September, 1859:--         \"Mormons have been accused of aiding the Indians in the       commission of this crime. I commenced my inquiries without       prejudice or selfish motive, and with the hope that, in the       progress of my inquiries, facts would enable me to exculpate       all white men from any participation in this tragedy, and       saddle the guilt exclusively on the Indians; but,       unfortunately, every step in my inquiries satisfied me that       the Indians acted only a secondary part. . . . White men were       present, and directed the Indians. John D. Lee, of Harmony,       told me in his own house, last April, in presence of two       persons, that he was present three successive days during the       fight, and was present during the fatal day.\" . . .    We close the testimony of Forney, by giving entire a letter from him to  the Department at Washington,--         \"SUPERINTENDENT'S OFFICE, UTAH,             }         GREAT SALT LAKE CITY, September 22, 1859. }         \"Sir,--Your letter dated July 2, in which you request me to       ascertain the names of white men, if any, implicated in the       Mountain Meadow massacre, reached me several weeks since,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/446"],[0,"A Book of Remarkable Criminals (#16)"],[1,"February 25th,       1879 Aged 47         For that I don but never       Intended.      The same day there arrived in the prison one who in his own trade had  something of the personality and assurance of the culprit he was to  execute. William Marwood--unlike his celebrated victim, he has his place  in the Dictionary of National Biography--is perhaps the most remarkable  of these persons who have held at different times the office of public  executioner. As the inventor of the \"long drop,\" he has done a lasting  service to humanity by enabling the death-sentence passed by the judge  to be carried out with the minimum of possible suffering. Marwood took a  lofty view of the office he held, and refused his assent to the somewhat  hypocritical loathing, with which those who sanction and profit by his  exertions are pleased to regard this servant of the law. \"I am doing  God's work,\" said Marwood, \"according to the divine command and the  law of the British Crown. I do it simply as a matter of duty and as  a Christian. I sleep as soundly as a child and am never disturbed by  phantoms. Where there is guilt there is bad sleeping, but I am conscious  that I try to live a blameless life. Detesting idleness, I pass  my vacant time in business (he was a shoemaker at Horncastle, in  Lincolnshire) and work in my shoeshop near the church day after day  until such time as I am required elsewhere. It would have been better  for those I executed if they had preferred industry to idleness.\"    Marwood had not the almost patriarchal air of benevolent respectability  which his predecessor Calcraft had acquired during a short experience  as a family butler; but as an executioner that kindly old gentleman  had been a sad bungler in his time compared with the scientific and  expeditious Marwood. The Horncastle shoemaker was saving, businesslike,  pious and thoughtful. Like Peace, he had interests outside his ordinary  profession. He had at one time propounded a scheme for the abolition of  the National Debt, a man clearly determined to benefit his fellowmen in  some way or other. A predilection for gin would seem to have been his  only concession to the ordinary weakness of humanity. And now he had  arrived in Armley Jail to exercise his happy dispatch on the greatest  of the many criminals who passed through his hands, one who, in his own  words, \"met death with greater firmness\" than any man on whom he had  officiated during seven years of Crown employment.    The day of February the 25th broke bitterly cold. Like Charles I.  before him, Peace feared lest the extreme cold should make him appear  to tremble on the scaffold. He had slept calmly till six o'clock in the  morning. A great part of the two hours before the coming of the hangman  Peace spent in letter-writing. He wrote two letters to his wife, in one  of which he copied out some verses he had written in Woking Prison  on the death of their little boy John. In the second he expressed his  satisfaction that he was to die now and not linger twenty years in  prison. To his daughter, step-son and son-in-law he wrote letters of  fervent, religious exhortation and sent them tracts and pictures  which he had secured from well-intentioned persons anxious about  his salvation. To an old friend, George Goodlad, a pianist, who  had apparently lived up to his name, he wrote: \"You chose an honest  industrious way through life, but I chose the one of dishonesty,  villainy and sin\"; let his fate, he said, be a warning.    Peace ate a hearty breakfast and awaited the coming of the executioner  with calm. He had been troubled with an inconvenient cough the night  before. \"I wonder,\" he said to one of his warders, \"if Marwood could  cure this cough of mine.\" He had got an idea into his head that Marwood  would \"punish\" him when he came to deal with him on the scaffold, and  asked to see the hangman a few minutes before the appointed hour. \"I  hope you will not punish me. I hope you will do your work quickly,\" he  said to Marwood. \"You shall not suffer pain from my hand,\" replied that  worthy. \"God bless you,\" exclaimed Peace, \"I hope to meet you all in  heaven. I am thankful to say my sins are all forgiven.\" And so these two  pious men--on the morning of an execution Marwood always knelt down and  asked God's blessing on the work he had to do--shook hands together and  set about their business. Firmly and fearlessly Peace submitted himself  to the necessary preparations. For one moment he faltered as the gallows  came in sight, but recovered himself quickly.    As Marwood was about to cover his face, Peace stopped him with some  irritation of manner and said that he wished to speak to the gentlemen  of the press who had been admitted to the ceremony. No one gainsaid him,  and he thus addressed the reporters: \"You gentlemen reporters, I wish  you to notice the few words I am going to say. You know what my life  has been. It has been base; but I wish you to notice, for the sake of  others, how a man can die, as I am about to die, in fear of the Lord.  Gentlemen, my heart says that I feel assured that my sins are forgiven  me, that I am going to the Kingdom of Heaven, or else to the place  prepared for those who rest until the great Judgment day. I do not think  I have any enemies, but if there are any who would be so, I wish them  well. Gentlemen, all and all, I wish them to come to the Kingdom of  Heaven when they die, as I am going to die.\" He asked a blessing on the  officials of the prison and, in conclusion, sent his last wishes and  respects to his dear children and their mother. \"I hope,\" he said, \"no  one will disgrace them by taunting them or jeering them on my account,  but to have mercy upon them. God bless you, my dear children. Good-bye,  and Heaven bless you. Amen: Oh, my Lord God, have mercy upon me!\"    After the cap had been placed over his head Peace asked twice very  sharply, as a man who expected to be obeyed, for a drink of water. But  this time his request was not compiled with. He died instantaneously and  was buried in Armley Jail.    Had Peace flourished in 1914 instead of 1874, his end might have been  honourable instead of dishonourable. The war of to-day has no doubt  saved many a man from a criminal career by turning to worthy account  qualities which, dangerous in crime, are useful in war. Absolute  fearlessness, agility, resource, cunning and determination; all these  are admirable qualities in the soldier; and all these Charles Peace  possessed in a signal degree. But fate denied him opportunity, he became  a burglar and died on the scaffold. Years of prison life failed, as they  did in those days, to make any impression for good on one resolute in  whatever way he chose to go. Peace was a born fighter. A detective who  knew him and had on one occasion come near capturing him in London, said  that he was a fair fighter, that he always gave fair warning to those on  whom he fired, and that, being a dead shot, the many wide shots which  he fired are to be reckoned proofs of this. Peace maintained to the last  that he had never intended to kill Dyson. This statement ex-detective  Parrock believed, and that the fatal shot was fired over Peace's  shoulder as he was making off. Though habitually sober, Peace was made  intoxicated now and then by the drink, stood him by those whom he used  to amuse with his musical tricks and antics in public-houses. At such  times he would get fuddled and quarrelsome. He was in such a frame  of mind on the evening of Dyson's murder. His visit to the Vicar of  Ecclesall brought him little comfort or consolation. It was in this  unsatisfactory frame of mind that he went to Dyson's house. This much  the ex-detective would urge in his favour. To his neighbours he was an  awe-inspiring but kind and sympathetic man. \"If you want my true opinion  of him,\" says Detective Parrock, \"he was a burglar to the backbone but  not a murderer at heart. He deserved the fate that came to him as little  as any who in modern times have met with a like one.\" Those who are in  the fighting line are always the most generous about their adversaries.  Parrock as a potential target for Peace's revolver, may have erred on  the side of generosity, but there is some truth in what he says.    As Peace himself admitted, his life had been base. He was well aware  that he had misused such gifts as nature had bestowed on him. One  must go back to mediaeval times to find the counterpart of this daring  ruffian who, believing in personal God and devil, refuses until the end  to allow either to interfere with his business in life. In this respect  Charles Peace reminds us irresistibly of our Angevin kings.    There is only one criminal who vies with Charley Peace in that genial  popular regard which makes Charles \"Charley\" and John \"Jack,\" and that  is Jack Sheppard. What Jack was to the eighteenth century, that Charley  was to the nineteenth. And each one is in a sense typical of his period.  Lecky has said that the eighteenth century is richer than any other  in the romance of crime. I think it may fairly be said that in the  nineteenth century the romance of crime ceased to be. In the eighteenth  century the scenery and dresses, all the stage setting of crime make for  romance; its literature is quaint and picturesque; there is something  gay and debonair about the whole business.    Sheppard is typical of all this. There is a certain charm about the  rascal; his humour is undeniable; he is a philosopher, taking all that  comes with easy grace, even his betrayal by his brother and others  who should have been loyal to him. Jack Sheppard has the good-humoured  carelessness of that most engaging of all eighteenth century  malefactors, Deacon Brodie. It is quite otherwise with Charley Peace.  There is little enough gay or debonair about him. Compared with  Sheppard, Peace is as drab as the surroundings of mid-Victorian crime  are drab compared with the"]]]
