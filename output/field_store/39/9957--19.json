His other possessions he leaves as he pleases.\"    \"What is to prevent, in course of time, such accumulations of valuable  goods and chattels in the hands of individuals as might seriously  interfere with equality in the circumstances of citizens?\" I asked.    \"That matter arranges itself very simply,\" was the reply. \"Under the  present organization of society, accumulations of personal property are  merely burdensome the moment they exceed what adds to the real comfort.  In your day, if a man had a house crammed full with gold and silver  plate, rare china, expensive furniture, and such things, he was  considered rich, for these things represented money, and could at any  time be turned into it. Nowadays a man whom the legacies of a hundred  relatives, simultaneously dying, should place in a similar position,  would be considered very unlucky. The articles, not being salable,  would be of no value to him except for their actual use or the  enjoyment of their beauty. On the other hand, his income remaining the  same, he would have to deplete his credit to hire houses to store the  goods in, and still further to pay for the service of those who took  care of them. You may be very sure that such a man would lose no time  in scattering among his friends possessions which only made him the  poorer, and that none of those friends would accept more of them than  they could easily spare room for and time to attend to. You see, then,  that to prohibit the inheritance of personal property with a view to  prevent great accumulations would be a superfluous precaution for the  nation. The individual citizen can be trusted to see that he is not  overburdened. So careful is he in this respect, that the relatives  usually waive claim to most of the effects of deceased friends,  reserving only particular objects. The nation takes charge of the  resigned chattels, and turns such as are of value into the common stock  once more.\"    \"You spoke of paying for service to take care of your houses,\" said I;  \"that suggests a question I have several times been on the point of  asking. How have you disposed of the problem of domestic service? Who  are willing to be domestic servants in a community where all are social  equals? Our ladies found it hard enough to find such even when there  was little pretense of social equality.\"    \"It is precisely because we are all social equals whose equality  nothing can compromise, and because service is honorable, in a society  whose fundamental principle is that all in turn shall serve the rest,  that we could easily provide a corps of domestic servants such as you  never dreamed of, if we needed them,\" replied Dr. Leete. \"But we do not  need them.\"    \"Who does your house-work, then?\" I asked.    \"There is none to do,\" said Mrs. Leete, to whom I had addressed this  question. \"Our washing is all done at public laundries at excessively  cheap rates, and our cooking at public kitchens. The making and  repairing of all we wear are done outside in public shops. Electricity,  of course, takes the place of all fires and lighting. We choose houses  no larger than we need, and furnish them so as to involve the minimum  of trouble to keep them in order. We have no use for domestic servants.\"    \"The fact,\" said Dr. Leete, \"that you had in the poorer classes a  boundless supply of serfs on whom you could impose all sorts of painful  and disagreeable tasks, made you indifferent to devices to avoid the  necessity for them. But now that we all have to do in turn whatever  work is done for society, every individual in the nation has the same  interest, and a personal one, in devices for lightening the burden.  This fact has given a prodigious impulse to labor-saving inventions in  all sorts of industry, of which the combination of the maximum of  comfort and minimum of trouble in household arrangements was one of the  earliest results.    \"In case of special emergencies in the household,\" pursued Dr. Leete,  \"such as extensive cleaning or renovation, or sickness in the family,  we can always secure assistance from the industrial force.\"    \"But how do you recompense these assistants, since you have no money?\"    \"We do not pay them, of course, but the nation for them. Their services  can be obtained by application at the proper bureau, and their value is  pricked off the credit card of the applicant.\"    \"What a paradise for womankind the world must be now!\" I exclaimed. \"In  my day, even wealth and unlimited servants did not enfranchise their  possessors from household cares, while the women of the merely  well-to-do and poorer classes lived and died martyrs to them.\"    \"Yes,\" said Mrs. Leete, \"I have read something of that; enough to  convince me that, badly off as the men, too, were in your day, they  were more fortunate than their mothers and wives.\"    \"The broad shoulders of the nation,\" said Dr. Leete, \"bear now like a  feather the burden that broke the backs of the women of your day. Their  misery came, with all your other miseries, from that incapacity for  cooperation which followed from the individualism on which your social  system was founded, from your inability to perceive that you could make  ten times more profit out of your fellow men by uniting with them than  by contending with them. The wonder is, not that you did not live more  comfortably, but that you were able to live together at all, who were  all confessedly bent on making one another your servants, and securing  possession of one another's goods.    \"There, there, father, if you are so vehement, Mr. West will think you  are scolding him,\" laughingly interposed Edith.    \"When you want a doctor,\" I asked, \"do you simply apply to the proper  bureau and take any one that may be sent?\"    \"That rule would not work well in the case of physicians,\" replied Dr.  Leete. \"The good a physician can do a patient depends largely on his  acquaintance with his constitutional tendencies and condition. The  patient must be able, therefore, to call in a particular doctor, and he  does so just as patients did in your day. The only difference is that,  instead of collecting his fee for himself, the doctor collects it for  the nation by pricking off the amount, according to a regular scale for  medical attendance, from the patient's credit card.\"    \"I can imagine,\" I said, \"that if the fee is always the same, and a  doctor may not turn away patients, as I suppose he may not, the good  doctors are called constantly and the poor doctors left in idleness.\"    \"In the first place, if you will overlook the apparent conceit of the  remark from a retired physician,\" replied Dr. Leete, with a smile, \"we  have no poor doctors. Anybody who pleases to get a little smattering of  medical terms is not now at liberty to practice on the bodies of  citizens, as in your day. None but students who have passed the severe  tests of the schools, and clearly proved their vocation, are permitted  to practice. Then, too, you will observe that there is nowadays no  attempt of doctors to build up their practice at the expense of other  doctors. There would be no motive for that. For the rest, the doctor  has to render regular reports of his work to the medical bureau, and if  he is not reasonably well employed, work is found for him.\"        Chapter 12    The questions which I needed to ask before I could acquire even an  outline acquaintance with the institutions of the twentieth century  being endless, and Dr. Leete's good-nature appearing equally so, we sat  up talking for several hours after the ladies left us. Reminding my  host of the point at which our talk had broken off that morning, I  expressed my curiosity to learn how the organization of the industrial  army was made to afford a sufficient stimulus to diligence in the lack  of any anxiety on the worker's part as to his livelihood.    \"You must understand in the first place,\" replied the doctor, \"that the  supply of incentives to effort is but one of the objects sought in the  organization we have adopted for the army. The other, and equally  important, is to secure for the file-leaders and captains of the force,  and the great officers of the nation, men of proven abilities, who are  pledged by their own careers to hold their followers up to their  highest standard of performance and permit no lagging. With a view to  these two ends the industrial army is organized. First comes the  unclassified grade of common laborers, men of all work, to which all  recruits during their first three years belong. This grade is a sort of  school, and a very strict one, in which the young men are taught habits  of obedience, subordination, and devotion to duty. While the  miscellaneous nature of the work done by this force prevents the  systematic grading of the workers which is afterwards possible, yet  individual records are kept, and excellence receives distinction  corresponding with the penalties that negligence incurs. It is not,  however, policy with us to permit youthful recklessness or  indiscretion, when not deeply culpable, to handicap the future careers  of young men, and all who have passed through the unclassified grade  without serious disgrace have an equal opportunity to choose the life  employment they have most liking for. Having selected this, they enter  upon it as apprentices. The length of the apprenticeship naturally  differs in different occupations. At the end of it the apprentice  becomes a full workman, and a member of his trade or guild. Now not  only are the individual records of the apprentices for ability and  industry strictly kept, and excellence distinguished by suitable  distinctions, but upon the average of his record during apprenticeship  the standing given the apprentice among the full workmen depends.    \"While the internal organizations of different industries, mechanical  and agricultural, differ according to their"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6260"],[0,"Donovan Pasha, and Some People of Egypt — Complete (#16)"],[1,"a woman's prayers are of no  avail, that her lord must save her at the last, if she hath a soul to be  saved.... Was the love of my lord mine?\" She paused, caught a corner of  her robe and covered her face.    \"Speak on, O woman of many sorrows,\" said Dicky. She partly uncovered  her face, and spoke again: \"In the long night, when he came not and  I was lonely and I cried aloud, and only the jackals beyond my window  answered, I thought and thought. My brain was wild, and at last I said:  'Behold, I will go to Mecca as the men go, and when the fire rises from  the Prophet's tomb, bringing blessing and life to all, it may be that I  shall have peace, and win heaven as men win it. For behold! what is my  body but a man's body, for it beareth no child. And what is my soul but  a man's soul, that dares to do this thing!'...\"    \"Thou art a blasphemer,\" broke in the chief of the Ulema.    She gave no heed, but with her eyes on Dicky continued:    \"So I stole forth in the night with an old slave, who was my father's  slave, and together we went to Cairo.... Behold, I have done all that  Dervishes do: I have cut myself with knives, I have walked the desert  alone, I have lain beneath the feet of the Sheikh's horse when he makes  his ride over the bodies of the faithful, I have done all that a woman  may do and all that a man may do, for the love I bore my lord. Now judge  me as ye will, for I may do no more.\"    When she had finished, Dicky turned to the Sheikhel-beled and said: \"She  is mad. Behold, Allah hath taken her wits! She is no more than a wild  bird in the wilderness.\"    It was his one way to save her; for among her people the mad, the blind,  and the idiot are reputed highly favoured of God.    The Sheikh-el-beled shook his head. \"She is a blasphemer. Her words are  as the words of one who holds the sacred sword and speaks from the high  pulpit,\" he said sternly; and his dry lean face hungered like a wolf's  for the blood of the woman.    \"She has blasphemed,\" said the Ulema.    Outside the house, quietness had given place to murmuring, murmuring to  a noise, and a noise to a tumult, through which the yelping and howling  of the village dogs streamed.    \"She shall be torn to pieces by wild dogs,\" said the Sheikh-el-beled.    \"Let her choose her own death,\" said Dicky softly; and, lighting a  cigarette, he puffed it indolently into the face of the Arab sitting  beside him. For Dicky had many ways of showing hatred, and his tobacco  was strong. The sea has its victims, so had Dicky's tobacco.    \"The way of her death shall be as we choose,\" said the Sheikh-el-beled,  his face growing blacker, his eyes enlarging in fury.    Dicky yawned slightly, his eyes half closed. He drew in a long breath of  excoriating caporal, held it for a moment, and then softly ejected it  in a cloud which brought water to the eyes of the Sheikh-el-beled. Dicky  was very angry, but he did not look it. His voice was meditative, almost  languid as he said:    \"That the woman should die seems just and right--if by your kindness and  the mercy of God ye will let me speak. But this is no court, it is no  law: it is mere justice ye would do.\"    \"It is the will of the people,\" the chief of the Ulema interjected. \"It  is the will of Mussulmans, of our religion, of Mahomet,\" he said.    \"True, O beloved of Heaven, who shall live for ever,\" said Dicky, his  lips lost in an odorous cloud of 'ordinaire.' \"But there be evil tongues  and evil hearts; and if some son of liars, some brother of foolish  tales, should bear false witness upon this thing before our master the  Khedive, or his gentle Mouffetish--\"    \"His gentle Mouffetish\" was scarcely the name to apply to Sadik Pasha,  the terrible right-hand of the Khedive. But Dicky's tongue was in his  cheek.    \"There is the Mudir,\" said the Sheikh-el-beled: \"he hath said that the  woman should die, if she were found.\"    \"True; but if the Mudir should die, where would be his testimony?\" asked  Dicky, and his eyes half closed, as though in idle contemplation of a  pleasing theme. \"Now,\" he added, still more negligently, \"I shall see  our master the Khedive before the moon is full. Were it not well that I  should be satisfied for my friends?\"    Dicky smiled, and looked into the eyes of the Mussulmans with an  incorruptible innocence; he ostentatiously waved the cigarette smoke  away with the hand on which was the ring the Khedive had given him.    \"Thy tongue is as the light of a star,\" said the bright-eyed  Sheikh-el-beled; \"wisdom dwelleth with thee.\" The woman took no notice  of what they said. Her face showed no sign of what she thought; her eyes  were unwaveringly fixed on the distance.    \"She shall choose her own death,\" said the Sheikhel-beled; \"and I will  bear word to the Mudir.\"    \"I dine with the Mudir to-night; I will carry the word,\" said Dicky;  \"and the death that the woman shall die will be the death he will  choose.\"    The woman's eyes came like lightning from the distance, and fastened  upon his face. Then he said, with the back of his hand to his mouth to  hide a yawn:    \"The manner of her death will please the Mudir. It must please him.\"    \"What death does this vulture among women choose to die?\" said the  Sheikh-el-beled.    Her answer could scarcely be heard in the roar and the riot surrounding  the hut.    A half-hour later Dicky entered the room where the Mudir sat on  his divan drinking his coffee. The great man looked up in angry  astonishment--for Dicky had come unannounced-and his fat hands twitched  on his breast, where they had been folded. His sallow face turned a  little green. Dicky made no salutation.    \"Dog of an infidel!\" said the Mudir under his breath.    Dicky heard, but did no more than fasten his eyes upon the Mudir for a  moment.    \"Your business?\" asked the Mudir.    \"The business of the Khedive,\" answered Dicky, and his riding-whip  tapped his leggings. \"I have come about the English girl.\" As he said  this, he lighted a cigarette slowly, looking, as it were casually, into  the Mudir's eyes.    The Mudir's hand ran out like a snake towards a bell on the cushions,  but Dicky shot forward and caught the wrist in his slim, steel-like  fingers. There was a hard glitter in his eyes as he looked down into the  eyes of the master of a hundred slaves, the ruler of a province.    \"I have a command of the Khedive to bring you to Cairo, and to kill you  if you resist,\" said Dicky. \"Sit still--you had better sit still,\" he  added, in a soothing voice behind which was a deadly authority.    The Mudir licked his dry, colourless lips, and gasped, for he might make  an outcry, but he saw that Dicky would be quicker. He had been too long  enervated by indulgence to make a fight.    \"You'd better take a drink of water,\" said Dicky, seating himself upon  a Louis Quinze chair, a relic of civilisation brought by the Mudir from  Paris into an antique barbarism. Then he added sternly: \"What have you  done with the English girl?\"    \"I know nothing of an English girl,\" answered the Mudir.    Dicky's words were chosen as a jeweller chooses stones for the ring of  a betrothed woman. \"You had a friend in London, a brother of hell like  yourself. He, like you, had lived in Paris; and that is why this thing  happened. You had your own women slaves from Kordofan, from Circassia,  from Syria, from your own land. It was not enough: you must have an  English girl in your harem. You knew you could not buy her, you knew  that none would come to you for love, neither the drab nor the lady.  None would lay her hand in that of a leprous dog like yourself. So you  lied, your friend lied for you--sons of dogs of liars all of you,  beasts begotten of beasts! You must have a governess for your children,  forsooth! And the girl was told she would come to a palace. She came to  a stable, and to shame and murder.\"    Dicky paused.    The fat, greasy hands of the Mudir fumbled towards the water-glass. It  was empty, but he raised it to his lips and drained the air.    Dicky's eyes fastened him like arrows. \"The girl died an hour ago,\" he  continued. \"I was with her when she died. You must pay the price, Abbas  Bey.\" He paused.    There was a moment's silence, and then a voice, dry like that of one who  comes out of chloroform, said: \"What is the price?\"    The little touch of cruelty in Dicky's nature, working with a sense of  justice and an ever-ingenious mind, gave a pleasant quietness to the  inveterate hate that possessed him. He thought of another woman--of her  who was to die to-morrow.    \"There was another woman,\" said Dicky: \"one of your own people. She was  given a mind and a soul. You deserted her in your harem--what was there  left for her to think of but death? She had no child. But death was  a black prospect; for you would go to heaven, and she would be in the  outer darkness; and she loved you! A woman's brain thinks wild things.  She fled from you, and went the pilgrimage to Mecca. She did all that  a man might do to save her soul, according to Mahomet. She is to die  to-morrow by the will of the people--and the Mudir of the Fayoum.\"    Dicky paused once more. He did not look at the Mudir, but out of the  window towards the Bahr-el-Yusef, where the fellaheen of the Mudir's  estate toiled like beasts of burden with the barges and the great  khiassas laden with cotton and sugar-cane.    \"God make your words merciful!\" said the Mudir. \"What would you have me  do?\"    \"The Khedive, our master, has given me your life,\" said Dicky. \"I will  make your end easy. The woman has done much to save her soul. She buries  her face in the dust because she hath no salvation. It is written in the  Koran that a man may save the soul of his wife. You have your choice:  will you come to Cairo to Sadik Pasha, and be crucified like a bandit of  your own province, or will you die with the woman in the Birket-el-Kurun  to-morrow at sunrise, and walk with her into the Presence and save her"]]]
