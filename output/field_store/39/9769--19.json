Many others, however, still wandered disconsolately about the  land, some of them only half fledged, and moping under boulders or any  sort of shelter from the chilly breezes, and long after all the  youngsters had departed, solitary moulting birds were to be found,  emaciated and miserable, patches of loose feathers still clinging to the  new coat which was making such a tardy growth. In some places we found  these old birds in holes under the rocks, the old moulted feathers  making some sort of a bed which helped to protect their late wearers  from the cold.    Both at Cape Adare in 1910 and at Inexpressible Island in 1911, I found  that though young and old left the rookery simultaneously at first, yet  after all the young had departed many adults still remained behind owing  to the lateness of their moult, and this is directly at variance with  the remarks of Mr. Borchgravink on the subject, because he says that the  old birds all leave the rookery first, abandoning the young, who are  driven by necessity to take to the water and learn to swim.    Well indeed was it for my companions and me that this was so, for in the  autumn of 1912 we were in sore straits for food, and had it not been  that at a very late date we collected some ninety old moulting birds on  Inexpressible Island, I doubt if we would have seen the sun rise in the  next spring.    At Cape Adare in 1911, half the rookery had departed when we arrived in  the autumn. The rest took to the sea in batches some hundreds strong.  These parties wandered about the beach and ice-foot in company for some  time, then entering the water and swimming northward they were seen no  more.    Those that moulted sometimes remained solitary whilst in the acuter  stages, but nevertheless moulting parties often were seen looking very  miserable, doubtless feeling in their unprotected state the effects of  winds which were getting keener and more severe now that the sun was  departing.    When all the youngsters had gone, some thousands of old birds still  remained, and waited for many days after they had acquired their full  plumage before they left. Then these in time disappeared, leaving the  rookery empty and desolate. On March 12 I photographed the last party:  all black-throated adults. Two days later a couple appeared on the  beach, apparently having come back for a last look at us. Then these,  too, disappeared, and as we looked at the empty silent beach we could  not help contrasting it with the noise and bustle of a short time ago.    The last penguin had gone, and the sun disappearing below the horizon,  left us alone with the Antarctic night.      APPENDIX      (A) Plumage and Soft Parts.    The following description of the plumage and soft parts of _Pygoscelis  Adeliae_, which is perfectly correct, is taken from the zoological report  of the _Discovery_ Expedition.      Soft Parts.    \"_Bill_, when first hatched, blackish. A week old, black terminally,  deep red at the gape and along the cutting edges. Immature of the first  year, blackish. Adult, brick-red, the upper bill black terminally, and  the mandible black along the cutting edge.    \"_Iris_, brown; varying between reddish brown and greenish brown.    \"_Eyelids_, black throughout the first year; pure white in the adult at  fourteen months and onwards.    \"_Feet_, flesh red; dusky when first hatched, brightening in the first  week or two. Immature and adult, pale flesh pink above, black beneath  (in some cases piebald beneath).    \"_Claws_, brown.\"                       *       *       *       *       *    In the majority of the chicks the down is uniformly dark and sooty, but  here and there, in progeny of quite normal parents, one may find  nestlings of so pale a grey as to be almost silvery white, with blackish  heads, possibly a reversion to an earlier type, and, at any rate,  suggestive of the young of the Emperor penguin, which perhaps represents  the oldest stock of all. According to Dr. Bowdler Sharp, the colour of  the head is in all cases blacker in the earlier stages than the rest of  the body.(8)      (8) This was invariable at Cape Adare.    As the chick ages the colour of its down changes, and all of it takes on  a dull rusty brown colour. As it moults the abdomen and thighs change  first, and white feathers appear in place of the down. Then come changes  on the head, round the bill, and at the tail; the upper breast, neck,  and back being the last parts to moult.    The feet, which in the young nestling have been almost black, change in  colour to a brick-red that shows up very markedly against the rusty  brown down, looking as if the legs were raw and inflamed. Later the  permanent flesh colour is acquired, with black plantar surfaces. The  nails are black at first, and later change to brown.    When the nestling down is shed, the resulting plumage is that of the  adult, except that the throat is white instead of black. The upper part  of the head and neck are bluish black, the throat, fore-neck, breast,  and abdomen being a pure dazzling metallic white, a sharp line  separating the white from the black areas. The flippers are the same  bluish \"tar\" black on the back and white beneath.    In addition to the distinctive pure white plumage of the throat, the  immature bird differs from the adult in one very marked particular,  which is that the eyelids are black, as in the chick, and do not acquire  the staring whiteness which is so distinctive of the adult Adelie  penguin, increasing, as it does, the white area of the sclerotic so that  the bird has the appearance of being perpetually surprised or very  angry.    The iris is a rich reddish brown in the adults, but variable in the  young.    At Cape Adare the light grey \"silvery\" coloured chicks mentioned by Dr.  Wilson were by no means uncommon; in fact, quite a large proportion of  the chicks had very light-coloured down. This is shown in some of the  specimens I brought back to the British Museum.      (B) Variations.    Variations occasionally are met with in the plumage and soft parts of  Adelies. The least rare of these consist of tufts of white feathers  amongst the black plumage of the head. Several specimens so marked were  seen at Cape Adare during the summer of 1911-12.    When these white tufts were present the feathers comprising them were  usually longer than the black feathers among which they appeared, so  that they stuck out in an untidy manner, and were very conspicuous.    In marked distinction to the slight variations above described were the  three \"Isabelline\" varieties that I preserved, and are now to be seen in  the British Museum collection. As these variations are very startling,  and of the greatest interest, I give below a full description of their  plumage and soft parts.    _First specimen_ captured on the Cape Adare rookery on November 4, 1911.    _Iris_, light brown. _Eyelids_, white. _Bill_, light brown. _Feet_,  white. _Claws_, light brown.    The whole of the area covered by black feathers in the normal bird was  covered by those of a very light fawn, somewhat darker on the neck and  shoulders than elsewhere. _Sex_, male.    _Second specimen_ captured on November 14, 1911.    _Iris_, light brown. _Eyelids_, white. _Bill_, light brown; mandible,  blackish on dorsum; maxilla, blackish on cutting edges. _Feet_, white on  both surfaces. _Claws_, light brown.    In place of the black feathers of the normal bird, there was a  fawn-coloured plumage, darkest on head and neck; lightest at bottom of  back, back of flippers, and on shoulders.    _Sex_, female.    _Third specimen_ captured on December 23, 1911.    _Iris_, light brown. _Feet_, browny white. _Claws_, brown. _Bill_,  brown; very dark on dorsum of mandible. _Eyelids_, white with a pink  tinge.    In place of the black feathers of the normal bird, this specimen had  those of a very light cream colour: in fact very slightly darker than  the white area but deepening in shade to light fawn on the head, neck,  and shoulders.    _Sex_, male.    The second specimen had mated with a normal cock. In each case the  Isabelline birds were very much more docile than the normal forms. For  instance, they did not struggle when picked up, as the others would have  done, and the third specimen, when brought into our hut, gazed around  with curiosity and apparent contentment, and showed not the least  resentment at its captivity. A normal bird would have struggled and  fought to the last extremity. Each bird was killed with chloroform.    So carefully did we keep the entire rookery under observation that I do  not think it likely there were any more Isabelline forms. Thus we can  conclude 3/750000 roughly represents the proportion of Isabelline forms  among the species.          PART III      McCORMICK'S SKUA GULL    A book which treats of Adelie penguins scarcely can be complete without  reference to the beautiful McCormick's skua gull (_Megalestris  maccormicki_), as probably no Adelie rookery exists without its  attendant band of skuas, who build their own nests very close to and  occasionally among those of the penguins on whom they prey, almost  entirely supporting themselves and their young upon the eggs and young  offspring of their hosts.    Mention has been made of these birds from time to time through the  previous pages, and some idea of their habits already will have been  formed. In point of fearlessness they fall somewhat short of the Adelie,  but exhibit, perhaps, rather more caution in their dealings with man  than the gulls who visit St. James's Park in London and are fed by the  children there, frequently from the hand, though probably in a very few  days they might become extremely tame were their short experience of  mankind made less bitter. The majority of explorers, like most men,  though kindly by nature, are entirely thoughtless in their dealings with  wild animals, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36924"],[0,"The Letters of Amerigo Vespucci, and Other Documents Illustrative of His Career (#16)"],[1," s                              s s s s                            s s s s s s                              s s s s                                         canopus        *                        *    After these come two others, of which the half-circumference, the  diameter, has 12 half-degrees; and with them is seen another Canopus.  To these succeed six other most beautiful and very bright stars, beyond  all the others of the eighth sphere, which, in the superficies of the  heaven, have half the circumference, the diameter 32 deg., and with them  is one black Canopus of immense size, seen in the Milky Way, and they  have this shape when they are on the meridian:--                           *        *    *    *                *                   s s                s s s s s               s s s s s s                  s s s                         *    I have known many other very beautiful stars, which I have diligently  noted down, and have described very well in a certain little book  describing this my navigation, which at present is in the possession  of that Most Serene King, and I hope he will restore it to me. In  that hemisphere I have seen things not compatible with the opinions  of philosophers. Twice I have seen a white rainbow towards the middle  of the night, which was not only observed by me, but also by all the  sailors. Likewise we often saw the new moon on the day on which it is  in conjunction with the sun. Every night, in that part of the heavens  of which we speak, there were innumerable vapours and burning meteors.  I have told you, a little way back, that, in the hemisphere of which  we are speaking, it is not a complete hemisphere in respect to ours,  because it does not take that form so that it may be properly called so.    Therefore, as I have said, from Lisbon, whence we started, the distance  from the equinoctial line is 39 deg., and we navigated beyond the equinoctial  line to 50 deg., which together make 90 deg., which is one quarter of a great  circle, according to the true measurement handed down to us by the  ancients, so that it is manifest that we must have navigated over a  fourth part of the earth. By this reasoning, we who inhabit Lisbon, at  a distance of 39 deg. from the equinoctial line in north latitude, are to  those who live under 50 deg. beyond the same line, in meridional length,  angularly 5 deg. on a transverse line. I will explain this more clearly: a  perpendicular line, while we stand upright, if suspended from a point of  the heavens exactly vertical, hangs over our heads; but it hangs over them  sideways. Thus, while we are on a right line, they are on a transverse  line. An orthogonal triangle is thus formed, of which we have the right  line, but the base and hypotenuse to them seems the vertical line, as  in this figure it will appear. This will suffice as regards cosmography.                                  Vertex[127] of our heads.                                           _.-'|                                       _.-'    |                      Hypotenuse.  _.-'        | Us.                               _.-'            |      Vertex[127] of       _.-'                |      their heads.     _.-'____________________|                                   Them.    These are the most notable things that I have seen in this my last  navigation, or, as I call it, the third voyage. For the other two voyages  were made by order of the Most Serene King of Spain to the west, in which  I noted many wonderful works of God, our Creator; and if I should have  time, I intend to collect all these singular and wonderful things into a  geographical or cosmographical book, that my record may live with future  generations; and the immense work of the omnipotent God will be known, in  parts still unknown, but known to us. I also pray that the most merciful  God will prolong my life that, with His good grace, I may be able to make  the best disposition of this my wish. I keep the other two journeys in  my sanctuary, and the Most Serene King restoring to me the third journey,  I intend to return to peace and my country. There, in consultation with  learned persons, and comforted and aided by friends, I shall be able to  complete my work.    I ask your pardon for not having sooner been able to send you this my  last navigation, as I had promised in my former letters. I believe that  you will understand the cause, which was that I could not get the books  from this Most Serene King. I think of undertaking a fourth voyage in  the same direction, and promise is already made of two ships with their  armaments, in which I may seek new regions of the East on a course called  Africus. In which journey I hope much to do God honour, to be of service  to this kingdom, to secure repute for my old age, and I expect no other  result with the permission of this Most Serene King. May God permit what  is for the best, and you shall be informed of what happens.    This letter was translated from the Italian into the Latin language  by Jocundus, interpreter, as everyone understands Latin who desires  to learn about these voyages, and to search into the things of heaven,  and to know all that is proper to be known; for, from the time the world  began, so much has not been discovered touching the greatness of the  earth and what is contained in it.           *       *       *       *       *          FOURTH VOYAGE OF AMERIGO VESPUCCI.      It remains for me to relate the things I saw in the fourth voyage; but  as I am already tired, and as the voyage did not end as was intended,  owing to an accident which happened in the Atlantic, as your Magnificence  will shortly understand, I propose to be brief. We departed from this  port of Lisbon with six ships,[128] having the intention of discovering  an island in the East called Melaccha, of which it was reported that it  was very rich, and that it was the mart of all the ships that navigate  the Gangetic and Indian Seas, as Cadiz is the mart for all vessels  passing from east to west or from west to east by way of Galicut. This  Melaccha is more to the west than Galicut, and much more to the south,  for we know that it is in 33 deg. from the Antarctic Pole.[129] We departed  on the 10th of May 1503, and shaped a course direct for the Cape Verde  Islands, where we careened and took in fresh provisions, remaining for  thirteen days. Thence we continued on our voyage, shaping a south-easterly  course, and as our commander was a presumptuous and very obstinate man,  he wanted to go to Serra-liona, in the southern land of AEthiopia, without  any necessity, unless it was to show that he was commander of the six  ships, and he acted against the wishes of all the other captains. Thus  navigating, when we came in sight of the said land the weather was so  bad, with a contrary wind, that we were in sight for four days without  being able to reach the place, owing to the storm. The consequence was  that we were obliged to resume our proper course, and give up the said  Serra, shaping a south-west course. When we had sailed for 300 leagues,  being 3 deg. to the south of the equinoctial line, a land was sighted[130]  at a distance of twenty-two leagues, at which we were astonished. We found  that it was an island in the midst of the sea, very high and wonderful in  its formation, for it was not more than two leagues long and one broad,  and uninhabited. It was an evil island for all the fleet, because your  Magnificence must know that, through the bad advice and management of  our commander, his ship was lost. For, with three in company, he struck  on a rock in the night of St. Lawrence, which is on the 10th of August,  and went to the bottom, nothing being saved but the crew. She was a ship  of 300 tons, and the chief importance of the fleet centred in her. As  the other ships were worn and needed repairs, the commander ordered  me to go to the island in my ship, and find a good anchorage where the  fleet could anchor. As my boat, with nine of my sailors, was employed  in helping the other ships, he did not wish that I should take it, but  that I should go without it, telling me that I should go by myself. I  left the fleet in accordance with my orders, without a boat and with less  than half my sailors, and went to the island, which was at a distance of  four leagues. I found an excellent port where the fleet could anchor in  perfect security. Here I waited for my captain and the fleet for eight  days, but they never came. We were very discontented, and the men were  full of apprehensions which I could not remove. Being in this state of  anxiety, at last, on the eighth day, we saw a ship coming from seaward,  and, fearing that she might not see us, we came out to her, expecting  that she was bringing my boat and people. When we came up to her, after  salutes, they told us that the _Capitana_ was gone to the bottom, the  crew being saved, and that my boat and people remained with the fleet,  which had gone to that sea ahead, which was a great trouble to us. What  will your Magnificence think of my finding myself 1,000 leagues from  Lisbon with few men? Nevertheless, we put a bold face on the matter,  and still went ahead. We returned to the island, and filled up with  wood and water by using our consort's boat. We found the island to be  uninhabited, supplied with abundance of fresh water, quantities of trees,  and full of marine and land birds without number. They were so tame that  they allowed us to take them with our hands. We caught so many that we  loaded a boat with these animals. We saw nothing but very large rats,  lizards with two tails, and some serpents.    Having got in our provisions we departed, shaping a course between south  and south-west, for we had an order from the King that any ship parted  from the rest of the fleet, or from the Commander-in-Chief, should make  for the land that was visited in the previous voyage. We discovered a port"]]]
