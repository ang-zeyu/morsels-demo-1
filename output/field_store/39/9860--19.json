TEMPLES REQUIRED FOR VICARIOUS SERVICE    While the ordinances of baptism, imposition of hands for the bestowal  of the Holy Ghost, and others, such as ordination to the Priesthood,  may be performed upon the living in any suitable and proper place, the  corresponding ordinances for and in behalf of the dead are acceptable  unto the Lord, and therefore valid, only when administered in places  specially provided, set apart, and dedicated for these and kindred  purposes; that is to say, such ordinances belong exclusively to the  House of the Lord. For a very brief period only, and that the earliest  in modern Church history, before the people had opportunity to erect  temples, did the Lord graciously accept a temporary sanctuary, even  as He accepted the Tabernacle of old as a temporary temple during the  period of Israel's wanderings.    In a revelation given to Joseph Smith, the prophet, at Nauvoo,  Illinois, January 19th, 1841, the Lord called upon His people to build  a house to His name \"for the Most High to dwell therein,\" and added by  way of explanation and instruction:        \"For there is not a place found on earth that he may come and      restore again that which was lost unto you, or which he hath taken      away, even the fulness of the Priesthood;        {87} \"For a baptismal font there is not upon the earth, that they,      my saints, may be baptized for those who are dead;        \"For this ordinance belongeth to my house, and cannot be acceptable      to me, only in the days of your poverty, wherein ye are not able to      build a house unto me.        \"But I command you, all ye my saints, to build a house unto me; and      I grant unto you a sufficient time to build a house unto me, and      during this time your baptisms shall be acceptable unto me.        \"But behold, at the end of this appointment, your baptisms for      your dead shall not be acceptable unto me; and if you do not these      things at the end of the appointment, ye shall be rejected as a      church, with your dead, saith the Lord your God.        \"For verily I say unto you, that after you have had sufficient time      to build a house to me, wherein the ordinance of baptizing for the      dead belongeth, and for which the same was instituted from before      the foundation of the world, your baptisms for your dead cannot be      acceptable unto me,        \"For therein are the keys of the holy Priesthood, ordained that you      may receive honor and glory.        \"And after this time, your baptisms for the dead, by those who are      scattered abroad, are not acceptable unto me, saith the Lord;        \"For it is ordained that in Zion, and in her Stakes, and in      Jerusalem, those places which I have appointed for refuge, shall be      the places for your baptisms for your dead.        \"And again, verily I say unto you, How shall your washings be      acceptable unto me, except ye perform them in a house which you      have built to my name?        \"For, for this cause I commanded Moses that he should build a      tabernacle, that they should bear it with them in the wilderness,      and to build a house in the land of promise, that those ordinances      might be revealed which had been hid from before the world was;        \"Therefore, verily I say unto you, that your anointings, and      your washings, and your baptisms for the dead, and your solemn      assemblies, and your memorials for your sacrifices, {88} by the      sons of Levi, and for your oracles in your most holy places,      wherein you receive conversations, and your statutes and judgments,      for the beginning of the revelations and foundation of Zion, and      for the glory, honor, and endowment of all her municipals, are      ordained by the ordinance of my holy house which my people are      always commanded to build unto my holy name.        \"And verily I say unto you, Let this house be built unto my name,      that I may reveal mine ordinances therein, unto my people;        \"For I deign to reveal unto my church, things which have been kept      hid from before the foundation of the world, things that pertain to      the dispensation of the fulness of times.\"[48]    * * * *    This then is sufficient answer to the question as to why the Latter-day  Saints build and maintain temples. They have been instructed and  required so to do by the Lord of Hosts. They have learned that many  essential ordinances of the Church are acceptable only when performed  in temples specially erected and reserved for the purpose. They know  that within these precincts of sanctity the Lord has revealed many  great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God; and that  He has promised to reveal yet more to man in houses sacred to His name.  They have learned that a great part of the mission and ministry of the  restored Church is the administration of vicarious ordinances in behalf  of the unnumbered dead who never heard the tidings of the Gospel, and  that for such sacred and saving service    _Temples are a necessity_.

The ceremonial work comprises:    1. Baptism, specifically Baptism for the Dead.    2. Ordination and associated Endowments in the Priesthood.    3. Marriage Ceremonies.    4. Other Sealing Ordinances.    As will be understood from what has been already written, each of  these ceremonies or ordinances may be performed either for the living,  present in person, or for the dead who are represented each by an  individual living proxy. The living are but few compared with the dead;  and it follows of necessity that the ordinance-work for the departed  exceeds by a great preponderance that done for the living. The temples  of today are maintained largely for the benefit and salvation of the  uncounted dead.    BAPTISM FOR THE DEAD    As demonstrated in the preceding pages, the law of baptism is of  universal application; in short, baptism is required of all who have  lived to the age of accountability. Only those who die in infancy  are exempt. Children, having no sin to expiate, and being unable to  comprehend {90} the nature of the baptismal obligation, are not to be  baptized while living, nor is the ordinance to be performed for them  should they die before reaching a responsible age and state. As to the  child's part in the heritage of mortality incident to the transgression  of Adam, the atonement of Christ is of full effect, and the redemption  of the child is assured.[1] Regarding the general applicability of the  law prescribing baptism as essential to salvation, the scriptures make  no distinction between the living and the dead. The atoning sacrifice  of Christ was offered, not only for the few who lived upon the earth  while He was in the flesh, nor for those alone who were born in  mortality after His death, but for all inhabitants of earth then past,  present, and future. He was ordained of the Father to be a judge of  both quick and dead;[2] He is Lord alike of living and dead,[3] as men  speak of dead and living, though all live unto Him.[4]    Among the pernicious dogmas taught by a perverted and mis-called  Christianity, is the heinous doctrine that never-ending punishment or  interminable bliss, unchanging in kind or degree, shall be the destiny  of every soul,--the award being made according to the condition of that  soul at the time of bodily death; a life of sin being thus nullified  by a death-bed repentance, and a life of honor, if unmarked by the  ceremonies of established sects, being followed by the tortures of hell  without a possibility of relief. Such a dogma is to be ranked with the  dread {9"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4524"],[0,"Familiar Letters on Chemistry, and Its Relation to Commerce, Physiology, and (#16)"],[1,"of plants, and for removing every obnoxious  influence. No experience, drawn from the exercise of the art, can be  opposed to true scientific principles, because the latter should  include all the results of practical operations, and are in some  instances solely derived therefrom. Theory must correspond with  experience, because it is nothing more than the reduction of a  series of phenomena to their last causes.    A field in which we cultivate the same plant for several successive  years becomes barren for that plant in a period varying with the  nature of the soil: in one field it will be in three, in another in  seven, in a third in twenty, in a fourth in a hundred years. One  field bears wheat, and no peas; another beans or turnips, but no  tobacco; a third gives a plentiful crop of turnips, but will not  bear clover. What is the reason that a field loses its fertility for  one plant, the same which at first flourished there? What is the  reason one kind of plant succeeds in a field where another fails?    These questions belong to Science.    What means are necessary to preserve to a field its fertility for  one and the same plant?--what to render one field fertile for two,  for three, for all plants?    These last questions are put by Art, but they cannot be answered by  Art.    If a farmer, without the guidance of just scientific principles, is  trying experiments to render a field fertile for a plant which it  otherwise will not bear, his prospect of success is very small.  Thousands of farmers try such experiments in various directions, the  result of which is a mass of practical experience forming a method  of cultivation which accomplishes the desired end for certain  places; but the same method frequently does not succeed, it indeed  ceases to be applicable to a second or third place in the immediate  neighbourhood. How large a capital, and how much power, are wasted  in these experiments! Very different, and far more secure, is the  path indicated by SCIENCE; it exposes us to no danger of failing,  but, on the contrary, it furnishes us with every guarantee of  success. If the cause of failure--of barrenness in the soil for one  or two plants--has been discovered, means to remedy it may readily  be found.    The most exact observations prove that the method of cultivation  must vary with the geognostical condition of the subsoil. In basalt,  graywacke, porphyry, sandstone, limestone, &c., are certain elements  indispensable to the growth of plants, and the presence of which  renders them fertile. This fully explains the difference in the  necessary methods of culture for different places; since it is  obvious that the essential elements of the soil must vary with the  varieties of composition of the rocks, from the disintegration of  which they originated.    Wheat, clover, turnips, for example, each require certain elements  from the soil; they will not flourish where the appropriate elements  are absent. Science teaches us what elements are essential to every  species of plants by an analysis of their ashes. If therefore a soil  is found wanting in any of those elements, we discover at once the  cause of its barrenness, and its removal may now be readily  accomplished.    The empiric attributes all his success to the mechanical operations  of agriculture; he experiences and recognises their value, without  inquiring what are the causes of their utility, their mode of  action: and yet this scientific knowledge is of the highest  importance for regulating the application of power and the  expenditure of capital,--for insuring its economical expenditure and  the prevention of waste. Can it be imagined that the mere passing of  the ploughshare or the harrow through the soil--the mere contact of  the iron--can impart fertility miraculously? Nobody, perhaps,  seriously entertains such an opinion. Nevertheless, the modus  operandi of these mechanical operations is by no means generally  understood. The fact is quite certain, that careful ploughing exerts  the most favourable influence: the surface is thus mechanically  divided, changed, increased, and renovated; but the ploughing is  only auxiliary to the end sought.    In the effects of time, in what in Agriculture are technically  called fallows--the repose of the fields--we recognise by science  certain chemical actions, which are continually exercised by the  elements of the atmosphere upon the whole surface of our globe. By  the action of its oxygen and its carbonic acid, aided by water,  rain, changes of temperature, &c., certain elementary constituents  of rocks, or of their ruins, which form the soil capable of  cultivation, are rendered soluble in water, and consequently become  separable from all their insoluble parts.    These chemical actions, poetically denominates the \"tooth of time,\"  destroy all the works of man, and gradually reduce the hardest rocks  to the condition of dust. By their influence the necessary elements  of the soil become fitted for assimilation by plants; and it is  precisely the end which is obtained by the mechanical operations of  farming. They accelerate the decomposition of the soil, in order to  provide a new generation of plants with the necessary elements in a  condition favourable to their assimilation. It is obvious that the  rapidity of the decomposition of a solid body must increase with the  extension of its surface; the more points of contact we offer in a  given time to the external chemical agent, the more rapid will be  its action.    The chemist, in order to prepare a mineral for analysis, to  decompose it, or to increase the solubility of its elements,  proceeds in the same way as the farmer deals with his fields--he  spares no labour in order to reduce it to the finest powder; he  separates the impalpable from the coarser parts by washing, and  repeats his mechanical bruising and trituration, being assured his  whole process will fail if he is inattentive to this essential and  preliminary part of it.    The influence which the increase of surface exercises upon the  disintegration of rocks, and upon the chemical action of air and  moisture, is strikingly illustrated upon a large scale in the  operations pursued in the gold-mines of Yaquil, in Chili. These are  described in a very interesting manner by Darwin. The rock  containing the gold ore is pounded by mills into the finest powder;  this is subjected to washing, which separates the lighter particles  from the metallic; the gold sinks to the bottom, while a stream of  water carries away the lighter earthy parts into ponds, where it  subsides to the bottom as mud. When this deposit has gradually  filled up the pond, this mud is taken out and piled in heaps, and  left exposed to the action of the atmosphere and moisture. The  washing completely removes all the soluble part of the disintegrated  rock; the insoluble part, moreover, cannot undergo any further  change while it is covered with water, and so excluded from the  influence of the atmosphere at the bottom of the pond. But being  exposed at once to the air and moisture, a powerful chemical action  takes place in the whole mass, which becomes indicated by an  efflorescence of salts covering the whole surface of the heaps in  considerable quantity. After being exposed for two or three years,  the mud is again subjected to the same process of washing, and a  considerable quantity of gold is obtained, this having been  separated by the chemical process of decomposition in the mass. The  exposure and washing of the same mud is repeated six or seven times,  and at every washing it furnishes a new quantity of gold, although  its amount diminishes every time.    Precisely similar is the chemical action which takes place in the  soil of our fields; and we accelerate and increase it by the  mechanical operations of our agriculture. By these we sever and  extend the surface, and endeavour to make every atom of the soil  accessible to the action of the carbonic acid and oxygen of the  atmosphere. We thus produce a stock of soluble mineral substances,  which serves as nourishment to a new generation of plants, materials  which are indispensable to their growth and prosperity.          LETTER XIII      My dear Sir,    Having in my last letter spoken of the general principles upon which  the science and art of agriculture must be based, let me now direct  your attention to some of those particulars between chemistry and  agriculture, and demonstrate the impossibility of perfecting the  important art of rearing food for man and animals, without a  profound knowledge of our science.    All plants cultivated as food require for their healthy sustenance  the alkalies and alkaline earths, each in a certain proportion; and  in addition to these, the cerealia do not succeed in a soil  destitute of silica in a soluble condition. The combinations of this  substance found as natural productions, namely, the silicates,  differ greatly in the degree of facility with which they undergo  decomposition, in consequence of the unequal resistance opposed by  their integral parts to the dissolving power of the atmospheric  agencies. Thus the granite of Corsica degenerates into a powder in a  time which scarcely suffices to deprive the polished granite of  Heidelberg of its lustre.    Some soils abound in silicates so readily decomposable, that in  every one or two years, as much silicate of potash becomes soluble  and fitted for assimilation as is required by the leaves and straw  of a crop of wheat. In Hungary, extensive districts are not uncommon  where wheat and tobacco have been grown alternately upon the same  soil for centuries, the land never receiving back any of those  mineral elements which were withdrawn in the grain and straw. On the  other hand, there are fields in which the necessary amount of  soluble silicate of potash for a single crop of wheat is not  separated from the insoluble masses in the soil in"]]]
