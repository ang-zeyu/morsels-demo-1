Whether  such retribution entirely satisfies the claims of justice, or a  further visitation of judgment is to take place beyond this world,  matters not. Such acts are exceptional in the Divine administration.      [132] Job xlii, 10-17.      [133] Numbers xii, 1-2; 10-15; xv, 32-36; xvi; xxi, 4-6; I Sam.    vi, 19; II Sam. vi, 6-7; Acts v, 1-11.    =10.= It is the prerogative of Jesus Christ[134] to judge the  children of men, and He will do it as His own purposes, which are  likewise the purposes of His Father, may be best served. John records  the words of Christ: \"For the Father judgeth no man, but hath  committed all judgment unto the Son; that all men should honor the Son  even as they honor the Father.\"[135] And Peter, while expounding the  gospel to the devout Gentile, Cornelius, declared concerning Jesus  Christ, that \"it is He which was ordained of God to be the Judge of  quick and dead.\"[136] Of the dread fate of the wicked reserved for the  judgment day, many prophets have borne record[137] and the presiding  Judge of that awful tribunal has given in His own words  descriptions[138] so vivid and forceful, as to leave no shadow of  doubt that every living soul will be called to acknowledge the record,  and to accept the results of his acts. The Lord's words and those of  His prophets are unequivocal, that He is no respecter of persons,[139]  and that any species of favor foreign to justice is unknown to Him.  This judgment none but the unrepentant wicked need fear; to the  righteous it is a time of triumph.[140]      [134] John v, 22-27; Acts x, 42; xvii, 31; Rom. ii, 16; II Cor. v,    10; II Tim. iv, 1, 8; Doc. and Cov. cxxxiii, 2.      [135] John v, 22.      [136] Acts x, 42.      [137] Dan. vii, 9; II Thess. i, 7, 8; III Nephi xxvi, 3-5; Doc.    and Cov. lxxvi, 31-49; 103-106.      [138] Matt. xxv, 31-46; Doc. and Cov. i, 9-12.      [139] Acts x, 34, 35; Rom. ii, 11; Eph. vi, 9; Colos. iii, 25.      [140] II Tim. iv, 8.    =11. Sin.=--What is the nature of sin? To this question the Apostle  John replies, \"Sin is the transgression of the law.\"[141] In the  original language of the Bible records, many words occur for which our  single term sin is used, all however conveying the common idea of  opposition to the Divine will.[142] As God is the embodiment of purity  and perfection, such opposition is a rebellion against the principles  of advancement, and an acceptance of the practices that lead to  degradation. Sin is any condition, whether consisting in omission of  things required, or in commission of acts forbidden, which tends to  prevent or hinder the development of the human soul. As a righteous  course leads to eternal life, so sin tends toward the darkness of the  second death. Sin was introduced to the world by the arch-fiend  Satan;[143] yet it is by Divine permission that mankind is brought in  contact with sin, the contrast between evil and good thus being  learned.      [141] I John iii, 4.      [142] See Note 2.      [143] Pearl of Great Price: Moses iv, 4; Genesis iii.    =12.= According to the technical definition of sin, it consists in the  violation of law, and in this strict sense sin may be committed  inadvertently or in ignorance. It is plain, however, from the  scriptural doctrine of human responsibility, and the unerring justice  of God, that in his transgressions as in his righteous deeds, man will  be judged according to his ability to comprehend law. To him who has  never been made acquainted with a higher law, the requirements of that  law do not apply in their fulness. For sins committed without  knowledge,--that is, for laws violated in ignorance, a propitiation  has been provided in the atonement wrought through the sacrifice of  the Savior; and sinners of this class do not stand condemned.    =13.= Nephi, prophesying to the ancient inhabitants of the western  continent, taught them this doctrine:--\"Where there is no law given,  there is no punishment; and where there is no punishment, there is no  condemnation; and where there is no condemnation, the mercies of the  Holy One of Israel have claim upon them, because of the atonement; for  they are delivered by the power of him; For the atonement satisfieth  the demands of his justice upon all those who have not the law given  to them, that they are delivered from that awful monster, death and  hell and the devil, and the lake of fire and brimstone which is  endless torment; and they are restored to that God who gave them  breath, which is the Holy One of Israel.\"[144] And then, in contrast  with the lot of those who are thus pardonable, the prophet adds:--\"But  wo unto him that has the law given; yea, that has all the commandments  of God, like unto us, and that transgresseth them, and that wasteth  the days of his probation, for awful is his state!\"[145] This is in  strict agreement with the teachings of Paul to the Romans, \"For as  many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law; and as  many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law.\"[146] And  the word of modern scripture is to the same effect, for we are told  through recent revelation to the Church, that among those who are to  receive the blessings of redemption are \"they who died without  law.\"[147] These will include the heathen nations, whose redemption is  promised, with the added declaration that \"they that knew no law shall  have part in the first resurrection.\"[148]      [144] II Nephi ix, 25-26.      [145] The same, paragraph 27.      [146] Rom. ii, 12.      [147] Doc. and Cov. lxxvi, 72.      [148] Doc. and Cov. xiv, 54. See p. 404, Note 4.    ==14. Punishment for Sin.--As rewards for righteous deeds are  proportionate to deserving acts, so the punishment prescribed for sin  is made adequate to the offence.[149] Punishment is inflicted upon the  sinner, for disciplinary and reformatory purposes, and in support of  justice. There is nothing of vindictiveness or of desire to cause  suffering in the Divine nature; on the contrary, our Father is  cognizant of every pang, and permits such to afflict for beneficent  purposes only. God's mercy is declared in the retributive pains which  He allows, as in the blessings of peace which issue from His hand. It  is scarcely profitable to speculate as to the exact nature of the  spiritual suffering imposed as punishment for sin. Comparison with  physical pain,[150] such as the tortures of fire, in a sulphurous  lake, serve to show that the human mind is incapable of comprehending  the depth of these dread penalties. The sufferings entailed by the  awful fate of condemnation are more to be feared than are any possible  inflictions of purely physical torture; the mind, the spirit, the  whole soul is doomed to suffer, and the extent of the torment no man  knoweth.      [149] Doc. and Cov. lxxvi, 82-85; lxxxii, 21; civ, 9; lxiii, 17;    II Nephi i, 13; ix, 27; xxviii, 23.      [150] Doc. and Cov. lxxvi, 36, 44; Jacob vi, 10; Alma xii, 16-17;    III Nephi xxvii, 11-12.    =15.= Consider the word of the Lord regarding those whose sin is the  unpardonable one, whose transgression has carried them beyond the  present horizon of possible redemption; those who have sunk so low in  their wickedness as to have lost the power and even the desire to  attempt reformation.[151] \"Sons of Perdition\" is the terrible  designation by which they are known. These are they who, having  learned the power of God, afterward renounce it; those who sin  wilfully, in the light of knowledge; those who open their hearts to  the Holy Spirit, and then put the Lord to a mockery and a shame by  denying Him; and those who commit murder, wherein they shed innocent  blood;[152] these are they of whom the Savior has declared that it  would be better for them had they never been born.[153] These are to  share the punishment of the devil and his angels--punishment so  terrible that the knowledge is withheld from all except those who are  consigned to this dread doom, though a momentary glance at the awful  picture is permitted to some.[154] These sinners are the only ones  over whom the second death hath power, \"Yea, verily, the only ones  who shall not be redeemed in the due time of the Lord.\"[155]      [151] See Doc. and Cov. lxxvi, 26, 32, 43.      [152] Doc. and Cov. cxxxii, 27.      [153] John xvii, 12; II Thess. ii, 3; Doc. and Cov. lxxvi, 32.      [154] Doc. and Cov. lxxvi, 45-48.      [155] Doc. and Cov. lxxvi, 38-39.    =16. The Duration of Punishment.=--As to the duration of such  punishment, we may take assurance that it will be graded according to  the sin; and that the popular interpretation of scriptural passages to  the effect that every sentence for misdeeds is interminable, is  entirely false.[156] Great as is the effect of this life upon the  hereafter, and terrible as is the responsibility of opportunities lost  for repentance, God holds the power to pardon beyond the grave. And  yet the scriptures speak of eternal and endless punishment. Any  punishment ordained of God is eternal, for He is eternal.[157] His is  a system of endless punishment, for it will always exist as a place or  condition prepared for disobedient spirits; yet the infliction of the  penalty will have an end in every case of willing repentance and  attempted reparation. And repentance is not impossible in the spirit  world.[158] Yet, as seen, there are some sins so terrible that their  consequent punishments are not made known to man;[159] these extreme  penalties are reserved for the \"Sons of Perdition.\"      [156] Doc. and Cov. xix, 6-12; lxxvi, 36, 44.      [157] Doc. and Cov. xix, 10-12.      [158] I Peter iii, 18-20; iv, 6; Doc. and Cov. lxxvi, 73. See p.    119.      [159] Doc. and Cov. lxxvi, 44.    =17.= The false doctrine that the punishment to be visited upon the  erring souls is endless, that every sentence for sin is of  interminable duration, must be regarded as one of the most pernicious  results"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42243"],[0,"The Hour of the Dragon (#16)"],[1," troops are of the same breed, and a large garrison of them occupy  the citadel. Aye, the hour of the Dragon has come at last.    'Nemedians swagger like lords through the streets. Women are outraged  and merchants plundered daily, and Valerius either can, or will, make no  attempt to curb them. Nay, he is but their puppet, their figurehead. Men  of sense knew he would be, and the people are beginning to find it out.    'Amalric has ridden forth with a strong army to reduce the outlying  provinces where some of the barons have defied him. But there is no  unity among them. Their jealousy of each other is stronger than their  fear of Amalric. He will crush them one by one. Many castles and cities,  realizing that, have sent in their submission. Those who resist fare  miserably. The Nemedians are glutting their long hatred. And their ranks  are swelled by Aquilonians whom fear, gold, or necessity of occupation  are forcing into their armies. It is a natural consequence.'    Conan nodded somberly, staring at the red reflections of the firelight  on the richly carved oaken panels.    'Aquilonia has a king instead of the anarchy they feared,' said Servius  at last. 'Valerius does not protect his subjects against his allies.  Hundreds who could not pay the ransom imposed upon them have been sold  to the Kothic slave-traders.'    Conan's head jerked up and a lethal flame lit his blue eyes. He swore  gustily, his mighty hands knotting into iron hammers.    'Aye, white men sell white men and white women, as it was in the feudal  days. In the palaces of Shem and of Turan they will live out the lives  of slaves. Valerius is king, but the unity for which the people looked,  even though of the sword, is not complete.    'Gunderland in the north and Poitain in the south are yet unconquered,  and there are unsubdued provinces in the west, where the border barons  have the backing of the Bossonian bowmen. Yet these outlying provinces  are no real menace to Valerius. They must remain on the defensive, and  will be lucky if they are able to keep their independence. Here Valerius  and his foreign knights are supreme.'    'Let him make the best of it then,' said Conan grimly. 'His time is  short. The people will rise when they learn that I'm alive. We'll take  Tarantia back before Amalric can return with his army. Then we'll sweep  these dogs from the kingdom.'    Servius was silent. The crackle of the fire was loud in the stillness.    'Well,' exclaimed Conan impatiently, 'why do you sit with your head  bent, staring at the hearth? Do you doubt what I have said?'    Servius avoided the king's eye.    'What mortal man can do, you will do, your Majesty,' he answered. 'I  have ridden behind you in battle, and I know that no mortal being can  stand before your sword.'    'What, then?'    Servius drew his fur-trimmed jupon closer about him, and shivered in  spite of the flame.    'Men say your fall was occasioned by sorcery,' he said presently.    'What then?'    'What mortal can fight against sorcery? Who is this veiled man who  communes at midnight with Valerius and his allies, as men say, who  appears and disappears so mysteriously? Men say in whispers that he is a  great magician who died thousands of years ago, but has returned from  death's gray lands to overthrow the king of Aquilonia and restore the  dynasty of which Valerius is heir.'    'What matter?' exclaimed Conan angrily. 'I escaped from the  devil-haunted pits of Belverus, and from diabolism in the mountains. If  the people rise----'    Servius shook his head.    'Your staunchest supporters in the eastern and central provinces are  dead, fled or imprisoned. Gunderland is far to the north, Poitain far  to the south. The Bossonians have retired to their marches far to the  west. It would take weeks to gather and concentrate these forces, and  before that could be done, each levy would be attacked separately by  Amalric and destroyed.'    'But an uprising in the central provinces would tip the scales for us!'  exclaimed Conan. 'We could seize Tarantia and hold it against Amalric  until the Gundermen and Poitanians could get here.'    Servius hesitated, and his voice sank to a whisper.    'Men say you died accursed. Men say this veiled stranger cast a spell  upon you to slay you and break your army. The great bell has tolled your  dirge. Men believe you to be dead. And the central provinces would not  rise, even if they knew you lived. They would not dare. Sorcery defeated  you at Valkia. Sorcery brought the news to Tarantia, for that very night  men were shouting of it in the streets.    'A Nemedian priest loosed black magic again in the streets of Tarantia  to slay men who still were loyal to your memory. I myself saw it. Armed  men dropped like flies and died in the streets in a manner no man could  understand. And the lean priest laughed and said: 'I am only Altaro,  only an acolyte of Orastes, who is but an acolyte of him who wears the  veil; not mine is the power; the power but works through me.'    'Well,' said Conan harshly, 'is it not better to die honorably than to  live in infamy? Is death worse than oppression, slavery and ultimate  destruction?'    'When the fear of sorcery is in, reason is out,' replied Servius. 'The  fear of the central provinces is too great to allow them to rise for  you. The outlying provinces would fight for you--but the same sorcery  that smote your army at Valkia would smite you again. The Nemedians hold  the broadest, richest and most thickly populated sections of Aquilonia,  and they cannot be defeated by the forces which might still be at your  command. You would be sacrificing your loyal subjects uselessly. In  sorrow I say it, but it is true: King Conan, you are a king without a  kingdom.'    Conan stared into the fire without replying. A smoldering log crashed  down among the flames without a bursting shower of sparks. It might have  been the crashing ruin of his kingdom.    Again Conan felt the presence of a grim reality behind the veil of  material illusion. He sensed again the inexorable drive of a ruthless  fate. A feeling of furious panic tugged at his soul, a sense of being  trapped, and a red rage that burned to destroy and kill.    'Where are the officials of my court?' he demanded at last.    'Pallantides was sorely wounded at Valkia, was ransomed by his family,  and now lies in his castle in Attalus. He will be fortunate if he ever  rides again. Publius, the chancellor, has fled the kingdom in disguise,  no man knows whither. The council has been disbanded. Some were  imprisoned, some banished. Many of your loyal subjects have been put to  death. Tonight, for instance, the Countess Albiona dies under the  headsman's ax.'    Conan started and stared at Servius with such anger smoldering in his  blue eyes that the patrician shrank back.    'Why?'    'Because she would not become the mistress of Valerius. Her lands are  forfeit, her henchmen sold into slavery, and at midnight, in the Iron  Tower, her head must fall. Be advised, my king--to me you will ever be  my king--and flee before you are discovered. In these days none is safe.  Spies and informers creep among us, betraying the slightest deed or word  of discontent as treason and rebellion. If you make yourself known to  your subjects it will only end in your capture and death.    'My horses and all the men that I can trust are at your disposal. Before  dawn we can be far from Tarantia, and well on our way toward the border.  If I cannot aid you to recover your kingdom, I can at least follow you  into exile.'    Conan shook his head. Servius glanced uneasily at him as he sat staring  into the fire, his chin propped on his mighty fist. The firelight  gleamed redly on his steel mail, on his baleful eyes. They burned in the  firelight like the eyes of a wolf. Servius was again aware, as in the  past, and now more strongly than ever, of something alien about the  king. That great frame under the mail mesh was too hard and supple for a  civilized man; the elemental fire of the primitive burned in those  smoldering eyes. Now the barbaric suggestion about the king was more  pronounced, as if in his extremity the outward aspects of civilization  were stripped away, to reveal the primordial core. Conan was reverting  to his pristine type. He did not act as a civilized man would act under  the same conditions, nor did his thoughts run in the same channels. He  was unpredictable. It was only a stride from the king of Aquilonia to  the skin-clad slayer of the Cimmerian hills.    'I'll ride to Poitain, if it may be,' Conan said at last. 'But I'll ride  alone. And I have one last duty to perform as king of Aquilonia.'    'What do you mean, your Majesty?' asked Servius, shaken by a  premonition.    'I'm going into Tarantia after Albiona tonight,' answered the king.  'I've failed all my other loyal subjects, it seems--if they take her  head, they can have mine too.'    'This is madness!' cried Servius, staggering up and clutching his  throat, as if he already felt the noose closing about it.    'There are secrets to the Tower which few know,' said Conan. 'Anyway,  I'd be a dog to leave Albiona to die because of her loyalty to me. I may  be a king without a kingdom, but I'm not a man without honor.'    'It will ruin us all!' whispered Servius.    'It will ruin no one but me if I fail. You've risked enough. I ride  alone tonight. This is all I want you to do: procure me a patch for my  eye, a staff for my hand, and garments such as travelers wear.'          9    'It is the King or His Ghost!'      Many men passed through the great arched gates of Tarantia between  sunset and midnight--belated travelers, merchants from afar with heavily  laden mules, free workmen from the surrounding farms and vineyards. Now  that Valerius was supreme in the central provinces, there was no rigid  scrutiny of the folk who flowed in a steady stream through the wide  gates. Discipline had been relaxed."]]]
