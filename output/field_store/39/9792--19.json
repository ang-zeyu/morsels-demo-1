But in Cayenne and its neighbourhood, which were cleared of wood about  one hundred and fifty years ago, the increase of temperature is now so  great, that during the night the people are annoyed by the warmth, and  the rains are neither so frequent nor so heavy as in the rest of the  country. Paris and Quebec are nearly under the same latitude; yet the  air of the latter is much colder than that of the former, evidently  from its being surrounded by forests so dense and umbrageous, that sun  and wind are alike denied access to the earth. The difference between a  cleared and an uncleared country, in regard to wool, is well  illustrated, by contrasting North America, its heavy woods and stagnant  atmosphere, with the thinly timbered surface and constantly renovated  air of New South Wales. It is only within the last few years that  Canada has been enabled to compete with Britain in the article of wool,  and that the sheep, which were of the coarsest kind, have been so  improved as to do away with the prejudices against their mutton.  Australia, on the other hand, has, from its earliest colonization,  figured as a sheep-rearing country of the first importance; and nothing  has conduced so much to this as its freedom from closely planted trees,  by the absence of which the settler is enabled at once to stock his  farm with the best of sheep. Nature, in fact, could never have intended  sheep to pasture in a wooded country, as is clearly evinced by their  coat, to which every thing in the shape of bush or tree is in the  highest degree inimical.    (75.) _Geographical limits of the Sheep._--Every plant and animal has  certain geographical limits, out of which it cannot exist. With the  exception of man and the dog, no animal has a wider range than the  sheep, extending as it does from Iceland almost to the equator, and  from a few degrees south of that to the polar extremity of South  America. But though existing under so great a variety of exposures, it  must not be inferred that it can come to perfection in them all. On the  contrary, it rather delights in the temperate zones, and can evidently  only be raised to its highest point of excellence in the countries of  the vine. The western parts of continents produce better sheep than the  eastern, and the southern hemisphere better than the northern; as in  the former situations the temperature is more nearly equable than in  the latter. The same may be said of maritime districts, as compared  with such as are inland. Temperature is affected in the same way by  elevation as by northern or southern position--the mean heat  diminishing in the same ratio when ascending a mountain, as in receding  from the equator. On this account, Humboldt compared the earth to two  mountains with their bases at the equator, and their summits at the  poles. The mean temperature, when resulting from the height of the  place above the level of the sea, is at the same time influenced by the  nature of the aspect, as we notice in the Alps, where the Glacier  exists on the northern side, at the same elevation at which the  vineyard yields a perfect fruit upon the southern.    (76.) _Particular forms induced by certain limits._--The character  which a predominance of heat, or cold, impresses on the animal as a  whole, extends also to individual parts of the body. The sheep of South  Africa are, as all the world know, remarkable for the magnitude of the  tail, which forms an immense fatty appendage. The sheep of Persia,  Tartary, and China, are distinguished from all others by the tail  forming a _double globe_ of fat. The North of Europe, and North of  Asia, are overrun by a breed in which the tail is almost wanting, while  that of Southern Russia, India, and Guinea, stands pre-eminent from the  elongation of the tail, and, in respect to that of the two last named  places, also of the legs.    (77.) _Influence of vegetation on form and disposition._--Vegetation  influences, to a great extent, the form and disposition of the animal.  Such changes may be brought about either by the plenty, or scarceness,  of the herbage; or by the nature of the country on which that herbage  is produced. Animals found on hilly countries are always widely  different from those of the plains. Their bodies are light, their legs  long, and their habits of that unquiet kind which renders them hostile  to any thing like restraint. It is for these reasons, that when once a  flock attaches itself to a range of hills, and becomes suited to the  means of subsistence, it may preserve itself for ages apart from  neighbouring varieties, and present, after a long series of years,  those qualities in their native purity for which it was noted by the  earliest observers. The sheep of a level country are distinguished, on  the contrary, by heavy bodies, short legs, and easy tempers. They are,  in fact, constructed on Dutch proportions, and are imbued, as a natural  consequence, with those imperturbable and steady-going habits so  characteristic of the bulbous bottomed Hollander. Subdued as they are  by the nature of their locality, they readily submit to man, who tutors  them at will, and works on them those profitable changes from which  have originated our improved varieties. As connected with the unquiet  dispositions of hill sheep, I may mention the prevalence of a notion,  that domesticated sheep cannot by any possibility become wild. From all  that I have seen, and read, I am led to believe, though the sheep,  according to Greek, Roman, and Oriental philosophers, was the first  animal domesticated, that when at liberty it will soon return to its  primitive and instinctive habits. Bonnycastle, in his work on Spanish  America, remarks, that sheep are found in a state of nature, in the  northern parts of New Spain, \"having multiplied to an extraordinary  degree in the wide-spread plains, and savannahs.\" In ascending our  Scottish mountains, every one must observe the state bordering upon  wildness, in which the sheep appear, roving in detached but well-led  parties; bounding away to the most inaccessible places on the approach  of danger, and peering from the eminences in all the pride of scornful  independence. Professor Blumenbach at one time doubted the possibility  of domestic sheep ever becoming wild; but his opinion was changed on  perusing the work of Vincentius, where there occurs a remarkable  passage, in which Nearchus, when speaking of the desert island of  Cataia, on the coast of Caramania, says, that the inhabitants of the  neighbouring islands yearly carried thither sheep, as offerings to  Venus and Mercury, and that, in course of time, they became wild in the  deserts.[13] Constant attendance is, therefore, called for on the part  of man, to ensure that untroubled reliance on his care so conducive to  the welfare of the flock, for even on a temporary cessation of his  protection, those instincts, which can be subdued but not eradicated,  are brought into operation, and their presence will go far to retard  the advancement of those qualities, on the perfection of which a profit  can alone be hoped for.            [13] Edin. Philosophical Journal.    (78.) _Breeds required for Britain._--Of the numerous breeds at  present in our island, a few only are indispensably necessary for the  continuance of its prosperity. These stand, according to Marshall,  thus:--A very long-woolled sheep, as the Lincolnshire, or Teeswater,  for the richest grass lands, and finest worsted manufactures--the New  Leicester, for less fertile grass land, and for rich enclosed arable  land, on which the fold is not used; intended to supply coarser  worsted, stockings, coarse cloths, blankets, and carpets--a  middle-woolled breed, as the Wiltshire, the Norfolk, or the Southdown,  for arable lands on which folding is practised, and for cloths of  middle qualities--a fine-woolled, as the Ryeland, for the finest  cloths; and a hardy race for heathy mountains.    Some argue, and rightly, that only three breeds are necessary for  Scotland, inasmuch as only three are required by the nature of the  country. Scotland may be regarded, in an agricultural point of view,  as divided into highland, upland, and plain. The highland consists of  primitive rocks, covered by peaty soil and heath, on which these  indefatigable gleaners, the black-faced sheep, alone can gain a  subsistence. The upland is formed by the transition series of rocks,  covered with grass; and to it the Cheviots appear indigenous. The  plain is formed by alluvial deposits, covered with rich pasture, and  capable of supporting races of large sheep, as the Leicesters.    Sheep are the only kind of live-stock which ought to be kept in  mountainous districts, especially when green crop cannot be  cultivated. Sheep-farming must necessarily prevail in the Highlands,  where there are few tracts suited for the pasturage of black cattle:  The value of its adaptation to the natural circumstances of that  district is proved by the rapid progress which it made, and the  profits which resulted to the individuals with whom it originated.  Places which formerly were not of the slightest utility, now yielded  heavy rents. The spots among the mountains, susceptible of  cultivation, were found to be advantageously kept in grass, to serve  as pasture for the flock during the rigour of winter, and it was well  ascertained that more than double rent might be paid by stocking with  sheep in preference to cattle.    The Dishley sheep are excellent specimens of what may be done with the  form of an animal, when the endeavours of the breeder are seconded by  a pasture suitable for the intended breed. They are admirably adapted,  as every breed ought to be, to the soil and situation where they were  called into existence; and their crosses are now spread over most part  of the country; principally the corn districts, as they are "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3819"],[0,"The Euahlayi Tribe: A Study of Aboriginal Life in Australia (#16)"],[1,"neighbouring tribes from hundreds of miles round to attend the  Boorah. The messengers each carry a spear with a waywah (or belt of  manhood) on the top, seeing which no tribe, even at enmity with the  messenger, will molest him. When a messenger arrived at a strange camp,  he was not asked his business but left to choose his own time for  telling. He would squat down a little way from the strangers' camp,  food would probably be brought to him which he would cat.    He would find out who was the chief wirreenun of the tribe, then take  him apart, give to him his Boorah message-stick as guarantee of his  good faith, and tell him where and when the Boorah was to be held.  After having given all necessary information, the Gooyeanawannah would  return to his tribe; the wirreenun to whom he had given the  Doolooboorah, or message-stick, would send it on by the messenger of  his tribe, and so with others, until all were summoned, each tribe  letting it be known that a Boorah summons had been received by sounding  the Gayandi, which would carry its own tale to those in the camp.    Should young boys be chosen as messengers, they were held in high  honour; Woormerh they were called.    While the messengers were away, the old men of the tribe in whose  Noorumbah, or hereditary hunting lands, the Boorah was to be held,  prepared the sacred grounds.    They cleared a big circle, round which they put a bank of earth, and  from the circle was cleared a path leading to a thick scrub; along this  path were low earthen embankments, and the trees on both sides had the  bark stripped off, and carved on them the various totems and multiplex  totems of the tribes. Such carvings were also put on the trees round  the Bunbul, or little Boorah ring, where the branches were also in some  instances lopped, and the trunks carved and painted to represent  figures of men, amongst whom were supposed to be the sons of Byamee's  wives. Two of these sons had been made young men at the first Boorah  Byamee instituted in this district, the ground of which is pointed out  to this day.    In the middle of the Bunbul a large heap of wood was placed ready for  the Yungawee, or sacred fire.    When the preliminary preparations were over, the camps were moved to  just outside the Boorah, or big Boorah ring. By that time the other  tribes began to arrive. First came from each tribe the boys to be  initiated and the Munthdeeguns, or men in charge of them. The men were  painted, and had leafy twigs tied round their wrists and ankles, as had  the boys also, and all carried in their hands small branches of green.  Those especially in charge of boys held, too, a painted spear with a  waywah on top of it.    As they approached the place of gathering the head man, with the  painted spear, began calling out all the names of the places along the  creeks from whence he came; at the name of each big watercourse they  all cried together    'Wah! Wah! wah!'    They were met at some distance from the camp by the men who had  summoned them, and who had made a round brush yard where they were to  meet them. Here the older women were singing Boorah songs. Some held  their breasts as a sign they had sons among the initiates; others put  their hands on their shoulders, which showed they had brothers going to  be made young men. All the women had leafy twigs tied round their  wrists and ankles as the men had. The newcomers and the men who met  them walked round the yard at a measured beat, lifting one leg and  throwing up one arm each time the cry of 'Wah! wah! wah!' was given,  for here too the enumeration of geographical names went on.    When the Boorah song was over, the men marched out of the yard; closely  behind them the two oldest men with the tufted spears; the Boorah boys  closely after them. The women followed, carrying bunches of leafy twigs  with which they pelted the boys until they reached the camp.    Matah and I had been watching the whole performance, and followed in  the wake of the women.    The whole scene impressed us as picturesque--the painted figures of the  men and boys, with the peculiarly native stealthy tread, threading  their way through the grey Coolabah trees; the decorated women throwing  their leafy missiles with accurate aim into the ranks of the boys, who  did not dare to look at their assailants. A Boorah boy must give no  evidence of curiosity; the NIL ADMIRARI attitude then begun clings to a  black man through life. The women of the tribe express voluble  surprise, but a black man never except by the dilation of his eyes.    Every night after this a corroboree was held. The fully initiated of  each tribe, as they arrived, help in the preparation of the inner  sacred ground, while the younger men collected game and other food.    The old men cut out of the ground along the narrow path leading to the  Bunbul, and round it, huge earthen animals, their various totems, such  as crocodiles, kangaroos, emus and others, all of a colossal size.  These they plastered over with mud and painted in different colours and  designs. On the right of the Bunbul they made an earthen figure of  Byamee--this figure was reclining holding in each hand a Boondee. On  the other side was the huge figure of a woman--this represented  Birrahgnooloo, the favourite wife of Byamee; she held two spears. There  was a third figure not so large as the other two but like them, apart  from the figures near the path and the Bunbul; this was Baillahburrah,  according to some, Dillalee according to others, the supernatural son  of Byamee--or as some say, brother--not born of woman, having lived  before the human race existed, before Byamee travelled as Creator and  culture hero through Australia.    Of the Gayandi, the Boorah spirit, sometimes called  Wallahgooroonboooan, there was no figure, because he was always present  at Boorahs, though invisible. His voice only gave evidence of his  presence.    The wirreenuns said it was he who had placed in the forks of trees  round the big ring heaps of dry wood, which they said, when the  ceremonies began, he would light, making a dazzling illumination of the  scene.    In the middle of the Boorah ring was placed a mudgee, a painted stick  or spear, with a bunch of hawk's feathers on the top. Every night was  heard at intervals the Gayandi, and immediately the younger women and  children stopped their ears, while the old women shrieked their  BRUMBOORAH.    As each fresh batch of blacks arrived the volume of sound was  increased, for the old men with their Gayandi would go into the scrub  and whirl them. These bull roarers sound curiously uncanny--I did not  wonder the uninitiated accepted the spirit theory as to their origin.    The bush of Australia is a good background for superstition; there is  such a non-natural air about its Nature, as if it has been sketched in  roughly by a Beardsley-like artist.    The function of the Gayandi is to inspire awe, and it fulfils it.  Byamee himself made the first. It was some time before he got quite the  effect he wanted. At first he desired to give the Boorah spirit a form  as well as a voice, to inspire awe; he also wished it to knock out the  front tooth of an initiate.    He made a stone figure in the image of man, having a voice. This  spirit, known variously as Gayandi, or Darramulun, went to the Boorah,  but when he was to knock out the front tooth, he began to eat the boys'  faces. He was too strong; he would not do to preside over, Boorahs.  Byamee transformed him into a large piggiebillah-like animal, though  instead of being covered with spines, thick hair grew over him; he has  since been known as Nahgul. He went away into the bush, where he has  been a dreaded devil ever since; for if he touches a man's shadow even,  that man will itch all over and nothing can cure him of it. He haunts  Boorah grounds.    Next Byamee made a stone bull roarer sort of thing, but this was too  heavy to make the noise he wanted. One day he was chopping a big  Coolabah tree close to Weetalibah water-hole, which tree, much to the  horror of our blacks, was burnt down a few years ago by travellers.    As Byamee chopped, out flew a big chip. He heard the whizzing sound it  made, gave another chop, out flew another; again the whizzing sound.    'That is what I want,' he said I'll make a Gayandi of wood.'    He cut a piece of mubboo, or beefwood, and shaped it; he tied a piece  of string to a hole in one end; he hung it up in the big Coolabah tree.  Then he went and cut one out of Noongah or Kurrajong, tied a string on  to that and put it beside the other on the tree, and left them swinging  there.    One day he came back and was camping near; his wives, came along to the  big tree. There the Gayandi swung, making a whirring noise.    'What's that?' said the women. 'We'll have a look what it is.' Seeing  Byamee they said, 'We heard voices in that big tree over there.'    'Whereabouts?' he said.    'In that Coolabah tree. Such strange voices, such as we never heard.'    'You two go' he said, 'to our camp and make a fire. I'll go and see  what it is.'    When the women were out of sight he went to the tree and took the  pieces of wood down. He was satisfied now they would answer his  purpose. He carefully hid them until he made a Boorah. And since then  such pieces of wood have been the medium for the Gayandi's voice, and  are kept carefully hidden away from all but the eyes of wirreenuns.    At length all the expected tribes had arrived, preparations were  finished, and a signal was given for a move to be made that the real  ceremonies might begin.    The fully initiated men went away after their midday meal, and about  sundown came in single file along the banked-in path each carrying a  firestick in one hand, a green switch in the other. When they reached  the mudgee in the middle of the big ring and corroboreed for a little  round it, the old women answered with a Boorah song, and all"]]]
