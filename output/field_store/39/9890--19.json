Beyond this there are sundry kinds of excessive criminal  saturations which are exceptional, and therefore transitory.  Ireland and Russia present us with conspicuous examples in their  political and social crimes; and similarly America, during  election contests.  So in France before and after December 2 1851,  the harbouring of criminals, which in no other quadrennial period  from 1826 to 1887 exceeds a record of fifty, rises in 1850-53 as  high as 239.  So during the famine of 1847, theft of grain rises  in France to forty-two in a single year, whilst for half a century  it barely reaches a total of seventy-five.  It is notorious,  again, that in years of dear provisions, or severe winters, a  large number of thefts and petty offences are committed for the  sole object of securing maintenance within the prison walls.  And  in this connection I have observed in France that other offences  against property decrease during a famine, by an analogous  psychological motive, thus presenting a sort of statistical  paradox.  Thus, for example, I have found that as oidium and  phylloxera are more effective than severe punishments in  diminishing the number of assaults and cases of unlawful wounding,  so famine succeeds better than the strongest bars, or dogs kept  loose in the prison yards, in preventing the escape of prisoners,  who at such times are detained by the advantage of being supported  at the public expense.    For a parallel reason in 1847, a famine year, whilst <p 80>all  crimes and offences against property increased in an extraordinary  fashion, only the crimes of theft and breach of confidence by  household servants showed a characteristic decrease, because such  persons were deterred by the fear of being dismissed by their  employers during the time of distress.  The figures are as  follows:--    FRANCE (Assizes).           1844.   1845.   1846.   1847.  Crimes against property ... 3,767   3,396   3,581   4,235  Breach of confidence by   household servants ... ... 136     128     168     104  Thefts by the same  ... ... 1,001   874     924     896      M. Chaussinand adds, by way of confirmation of my statement that  during economic crises, such as famine and high prices of grain,  the number of cases of escape from justice also decreases, _*for_  ``thieves and tramps prefer arrest, in order to escape from the  misery which afflicts them outside the prison walls.''      Two fundamental conclusions of criminal sociology may be drawn  from this law of criminal saturation.    The first is that it is incorrect to assert a mechanical  regularity of crime, which from Quetelet's time has been much  exaggerated.  There has been a too literal insistance on his  famous declaration that ``the budget of crime is an annual  taxation paid with more preciseness than any other''; and that it  is possible to calculate beforehand how many homicides, poisoners,  and forgers we shall have, because ``crimes are generated every  year in the same number, with the same punishments, in the same  proportions.''  And one constantly meets with this echo of the  statisticians, that ``from year to year crimes against the person  vary at the <p 81>most by one in twenty-five, and those against  property by one in fifty''; or, again, that there is ``a law of  limitation in crime, which does not vary by more than one in  ten.''    This opinion, originated by Quetelet and other statisticians after  an inquiry confined to the more serious crimes, and to a very  short succession of years, has already been refuted, in part by  Maury and Rhenisch, and more plainly by Aberdare, Mayr,  Messedaglia and Minzloff.    In fact, if the level of criminality is of necessity determined by  the physical and social environment, how could it remain constant  in spite of the continual variations, sometimes very considerable,  of this same environment?  That which does remain fixed is the  proportion between a given environment and the number of crimes:  and this is precisely the law of criminal saturation.  But the  statistics of criminality will never be constant to one rule from  year to year.  There will be a dynamical but not a statical  regularity.    Thus the element of fixity in criminal sociology consists in  asserting, not the fatality or predestination of human actions,  including crimes, but only their necessary dependence upon their  natural causes, and therewith the possibility of modifying effects  by modifying the activity of these causes.  And, indeed, even  Quetelet himself recognised this when he said, ``If we change the  social order we shall see an immediate change in the facts which  have been so constantly reproduced.  Statisticians will then have  to consider whether the changes have been useful or injurious.  These studies therefore show how <p 82>important is the mission of  the legislator, and how responsible he is in his own sphere for  all the phenomena of the social order.''    The second consequence of the law of criminal saturation, one of  great theoretical importance, is that the penalties hitherto  regarded, save for a few platonic declarations, as the best  remedies for crime, are less effectual than they are supposed to  be.  For crimes and offences increase and diminish by a  combination of other causes, which are far from being identical  with the punishments lightly written out by legislators and  awarded by judges.    History affords us various impressive examples.    The Roman Empire, when society had fallen into extreme corruption,  recalling many symptoms of our own epoch, vainly promulgated laws  which visited celibacy, adultery, and incest--``venus  prodigiosa''--with ``the vengeance of the sword and punishments of  the utmost severity.''  Dio Cassius (``Hist. Rom.,'' lxxvi. 16)  says that in the city of Rome alone, after the law of Septimus  Severus, there were three thousand charges of adultery.  But the  stringent laws against these crimes continued to the days of  Justinian, which shows that the crimes had not been checked; and,  as Gibbon says (``Decline and Fall,'' ch. 44), the Scatinian law  against ``venus nefanda'' had fallen into abeyance through lapse  of time and the multitude of offenders.  Yet we see in our own  days, as in France, that there are some who would oppose celibacy  with no other remedy than a law passed for the purpose.    Since medi<ae>val times the increasing gentleness of <p 83>manners  has caused a diminution of crimes of blood, once so numerous that  there was need of sundry ``truces'' and ``peaces,''  notwithstanding the harsh penalties of previous centuries.  And Du  Boys called Cettes simple because, after giving a table of  shocking punishments in the Germany of his day (the fifteenth  century), he marvelled that all these pains and torments had not  prevented the increase of crimes.    Imperial Rome deluded herself with the idea that she could stamp  out Christianity with punishments and tortures, which, however,  only seemed to fan the flame.  In the same way Catholic Europe  hoped to extinguish Protestantism by means of vindictive  persecution, and only produced the opposite effect, as always  happens.  If the Reformed faith does not strike root in Italy,  France, and Spain, that must be explained by psychological reasons  proper to those nations, independently of the stake and of  massacres, for it did not strike root even when religious belief  was liberated from its fetters.  This does not prevent all  governments in every land from continuing to believe that, in  order to arrest the spread of certain political or social  doctrines, there is nothing better than to pass exceptional penal  laws, forgetting that, with ideas and prejudices just as with  steam, compression increases the expansive force.    Popular education has swept away the so-called crimes of magic and  witchcraft, though they had withstood the most savage punishments  of antiquity and medi<ae>val times.    Blasphemy, in spite of the slitting of the nose, <p 84>tongue, and  lips, enacted by the penal laws, and continued in France from  Louis XI. to Louis XV., was very common in the middle ages, being  (like witchcraft, trances, and self-immurement) a pathological or  abnormal manifestation of religious emotion, which in those times  had an extraordinary development.  And the habit of blasphemy  diminished under the psychological and social evolution of our own  days, precisely when it ceased to be punished.  Or, rather, it  continued to this day, as in Tuscany, where the Tuscan penal code  (Art. 136), which survived until December 31, 1889, still punished  it with five years' imprisonment.  The illusion as to the efficacy  of punishment is so deeply rooted that a proposal was made in the  Senate, in 1875, to include this penalty in the new Italian penal  code.  And at Murcia, in Spain, trials for blasphemy have lately  been re-established.    Mittermaier observed that, if in England and Scotland there were  far fewer cases of false witness, perjury, and resistance to  authority than in Ireland and on the Continent, this must be due  in great measure to national character, which is one of the  hereditary elements of normal as well as of abnormal and criminal  life.    Thus even apart from statistics we can satisfy ourselves that  crimes and punishments belong to two different spheres; but when  statistics support the teaching of history, no doubt can remain as  to the very slight (I had almost said the absence of any)  deterrent effect of punishments upon crime.    We may indeed derive a telling proof from statis<p 85>tical  records, by referring to the progress of repression in France,  over a period of sixty years, as I have already done in my  ``Studies'' previously quoted.    When we speak of the repression of crime, we must first of all  distinguish between that which is due to the general character of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47703"],[0,"Wilford Woodruff, Fourth President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day (#16)"],[1,"g, my horse became entangled in a tree-top, and almost drowned;  but I succeeded in getting him loose. We swam to the shore separately.  He reached the shore first, and waited till I came out. I got into the  saddle, went on my way in good spirits, and had a good meeting.    \"On the 20th of October I baptized three Campbellites, one of whom was  a deacon. I then rode twelve miles to Mr. Green wood's, who was eighty  years old, and had been a soldier under General Washington. His wife,  who was ninety-three years old, I found quite smart, and busy carding  wool. I preached at their house and baptized both of them.    \"On the following day I preached at the house of Benjamin L. Clapp, and  baptized seven Campbellites and one Baptist. On the 16th of November, I  preached at Brother Camp's, and baptized three. On the day following,  it being Sunday, I preached again at Brother Clapp's, and baptized five.    \"At the close of the meeting I mounted my horse to ride to Clark's  River, in company with Seth Utley, four other brethren, and two  sisters. The distance was twenty miles. We came to a stream which  was so swollen by rains that we could not cross without swimming our  horses. To swim would not be safe for the women, so we went up the  stream to find a ford. In the attempt we were overtaken by a severe  storm of wind and rain, lost our way in the darkness, and wandered  through creeks and mud. But the Lord does not forsake His Saints in  any of their troubles. While we were in the woods suffering under the  blast of the storm, groping like the blind for the wall, a bright light  suddenly shone around us, and revealed to us our dangerous situation  on the edge of a gulf. The light continued with us until we found the  road; we then went on our way rejoicing, though the darkness returned  and the rain continued. We reached Brother Henry Thomas' in safety  about nine o'clock at night, having been five hours in the storm,  and forded streams many times. None of us felt to complain, but were  thankful to {58} God for His preserving care. On the following day I  preached at Damon Creek, and organized a branch called Damon Creek  Branch, and ordained Daniel Thomas a teacher.    \"On the 19th of December I again preached at the house of Brother  Clapp, and baptized five persons; one was a Campbellite preacher. On  the following day I preached at the house of Brother Henry Thomas, when  a mob of about fifty persons collected, headed by a Baptist preacher,  who, after asking one question, advised the mob not to lay hands on any  man on account of his principles. The advice was good and well taken.  At the close of the meeting I baptized three persons, one seventy-eight  years old.    \"This brings the year 1835 to a close--the first year of my  mission--during which time I had traveled three thousand two hundred  and forty-eight miles, held one hundred and seventy meetings, baptized  forty-three persons--three of whom were Campbellite preachers--assisted  Elder Parrish to baptize twenty more, confirmed thirty-five, organized  three branches, ordained two teachers and one deacon, procured  thirty subscribers for the Messenger and Advocate, one hundred and  seventy-three signers to the petition to the governor of Missouri for  redress of wrongs done the Saints in Jackson County, had three mobs  rise against me--but was not harmed--wrote eighteen letters, received  ten, and, finally, closed the labors of the year 1835 by eating johnny  cake, butter and honey, at Brother A. O. Smoot's.    \"I spent the fore part of January, 1836, (the weather being very cold),  at the house of A. O. Smoot, in Kentucky, studying Kirkham's English  Grammar. I continued to travel and preach in Kentucky and Tennessee and  baptized all that would believe my testimony. On the 26th of February  we held a conference at the house of Brother Lewis Clapp (father of B.  L. Clapp). There were represented one hundred and three members in that  mission. I ordained A. O. Smoot and Benjamin Boyston elders, and Daniel  Thomas and Benjamin L. Clapp priests. I also ordained one teacher and  two deacons.    \"After conference I took Brothers Smoot and Clapp with me to preach.  The former traveled with me constantly till the 21st of April, when  we had the privilege of meeting with Elder David W. Patten, who had  come direct from Kirtland, and who {59} had been ordained one of  the Twelve Apostles. It was a happy meeting. He gave us an account  of the endowments at Kirtland, the glorious blessings received, the  ministration of angels, the organization of the Twelve Apostles and  seventies, and informed me that I was appointed a member of the second  quorum of seventy. All this was glorious news to me, and caused my  heart to rejoice. On the 27th of May we were joined by Elder Warren  Parrish, direct from Kirtland. We had a happy time together.    \"On the 28th, we held a conference at Brother Seth Utley's, where were  represented all the branches of the Church in the South. On the 31st  of May I was ordained a member of the second quorum of seventy, under  the hands of David W. Patten and Warren Parrish. At the close of the  conference we separated for a short time. Elders Patten and Parrish  labored in Tennessee, Brother Smoot and myself in Kentucky. On the 9th  of June we all met at Damon Creek Branch, where Brother Patten baptized  two. One was Father Henry Thomas, who had been a revolutionary war  soldier under General Washington, and was father of Daniel and Henry  Thomas.    \"A warrant was issued, on the oath of a priest, against D. W. Patten,  W. Parrish and myself. We were accused in the warrant of the great  'crime' of testifying that Christ would come in this generation, and  that we promised the Holy Ghost to those whom we baptized. Brothers  Patten and Parrish were taken on the 19th of June. I, being in another  county, escaped arrest. The brethren were put under two thousand  dollars bonds to appear at court. Albert Petty and Seth Utley were  their bondsmen. They were tried on the 22nd of June. They pleaded  their own cause. Although men came forward and testified that they did  receive the Holy Ghost after they were baptized, the brethren were  condemned; but finally were released by paying the expenses of the mob  court.    \"One peculiar circumstance was connected with this trial by a mob  court, which was armed to the teeth. When the trial was through, the  people were not willing to permit more than one to speak. Warren  Parrish had said a few words, and they were not willing to let David  Patten say anything; but he, feeling the injustice of the court,  and being filled with the power of {60} God, arose to his feet and  delivered a speech of about twenty minutes, holding them spell-bound  while he told them of their wickedness and of the abominations they  were guilty of, also of the curse of God that awaited them, if they  did not repent, and for taking up two harmless, inoffensive men for  preaching the gospel of Christ. When he had got through his speech  the judge said, 'You must be armed with secret weapons, or you would  not talk in this fearless manner to an armed court.' Brother Patten  replied, 'I have weapons that you know not of, and they are given me of  God, for He gives me all the power I have.' The judge seemed willing to  get rid of them upon almost any terms, and offered to dismiss them if  their friends would pay the costs, which the brethren present freely  offered to do.    \"When the two were released, they mounted their horses and rode a mile  to Seth Utley's; but as soon as they had left, the court became ashamed  that they had been let go so easily, and the whole mob mounted their  horses to follow them to Utley's. One of the Saints, seeing the state  of affairs, went on before the mob to notify the brethren, so that they  had time to ride into the woods near by. They traveled along about  three miles to Brother Albert Petty's, and went to bed. The night was  dark, and they fell asleep, but Brother Patten was warned in a dream  to get up and flee, as the mob soon would be there. They both arose,  saddled their animals, and rode into the adjoining county. The house  they had just left was soon surrounded by the mob, but the brethren  escaped through the mercy of God.    \"I was invited to hold a meeting at a Baptist meetinghouse; this was  on the 27th of June. On my arrival I met a large congregation, but, on  commencing services, Parson Browning ordered the meeting to be closed.  I told the people I had come ten miles to preach the gospel to them,  and was willing to stand in a cart, on a pile of wood, on a fence, or  any other place they would appoint, to have that privilege. One man  said he owned the fence and land in front of the meetinghouse, and we  might use both, for he did not believe Mormonism would hurt either. So  the congregation crossed the road, took down the fence and made seats  of it, and I preached to them one hour and a half. At the close, Mr.  Randolph Alexander bore testimony to the truth of what had been said.  He invited me home with him, bought {61} a Book of Mormon and was  baptized, and I organized a branch in that place.    \"On the 18th of July, Brother A. O. Smoot and I arrived at a ferry on  the Tennessee River, and, as the ferryman was not at home, the woman  kindly gave us permission to use the ferryboat. We led our horses on  board, and took the oars to row across the river. Brother Smoot never  had used an oar, and I had not done so for some years, so we made  awkward work of it. Soon he broke one oar, and I let another fall  overboard, which left us only one broken oar to get to shore with. We  narrowly escaped running into a steamboat. We struck shore half a mile  below the landing place, tied up the boat, jumped on the bank with our  horses, and went on our way with blistered hands, thankful to get off  so well.    \"On Sunday, the 31st of July, A. O. Smoot and I preached at Mr. David"]]]
