Immediately afterwards, however, or on Saturday morning early, the  provost and special police force got on the scent, and military in  squads were dispatched close upon their heels.    Three grand pursuits wore organized: one reaching up the north bank of  the Potomac toward Chain bridge, to prevent escape by that direction  into Virginia, where Mosby, it was suspected, waited to hail the  murderers;    A second starting from Richmond, Va., northward, forming a broad  advancing picket or skirmish line between the Blue Ridge and the broad  sea-running streams;    A third to scour the peninsula towards Point Lookout.    The latter region became the only one well examined; the northern  expedition failed until advised from below to capture Atzerott, and  failed, to capture Payne. Yet there were cogent probabilities that the  assassin had taken this route; far Mosby would have given them the right  hand of fellowship.    When that guerrilla heard of Booth's feat, said Captain Jett, he  exclaimed:    \"Now, by----! I could take that man in my arms.\"    Washington, as a precautionary measure, was doubly picketed at once; the  authorities in all northern towns advised of the personnel of the  murderer, and requests made of the detective chiefs in Baltimore,  Philadelphia, and New-York, to forward to Washington without delay their  best decoys.    A court of inquiry was organized on the moment, and early in the week  succeeding rewards were offered. An individual, and not the government,  offered the first rewards.    There were two men without whom the hunt would have gone astray many  times.    John S. Young, chief of the New-York detective force, a powerful and  resolute man, whose great weight and strength are matched by boundless  energy, and both subordinate to a head as clear as the keen and  searching warrant of his eye. This man has been in familiar converse  with every rebel agent in the Canadas, and is feared by them as they  fear the fates of Beall and Kennedy. Without being a sensationist, he  has probably rendered the cleverest services of the war to the general  government. They sent for him immediately after the tragedy, and he  stopped on the way for his old police companion, Marshal Murray. The  latter's face and figure are familiar to all who know New-York; he  resembles an admiral on his quarter-deck; he is a detective of fair and  excellent repute, and has a somewhat novel pride in what he calls \"the  most beautiful gallows in the United States.\"    These officials were ordered to visit Colonel Ingraham's office and  examine the little evidence on hand. They and their tried officers  formed a junction on Sunday afternoon with the large detective force of  Provost-Marshal Major O'Bierne. The latter commands the District of  Columbia civil and military police. He is a New-Yorker and has been shot  through the body in the field.    The detective force of Young and Murray consisted of Officers Radford,  Kelso, Elder, and Hoey, of New-York; Deputy-Marshal Newcome, formerly of  THE WORLD'S city staff; Officers Joseph Pierson and West, of Baltimore.    Major O'Bierne's immediate aids were Detectives John Lee, Lloyd,  Gavigan, Coddingham, and Williams.    A detachment of the Philadelphia detective police, force--Officers  Taggert, George Smith, and Carlin, reporting to Colonel Baker--went in  the direction of the North Pole; everybody is on the _que vive_ for  them.    To the provost-marshal of Baltimore, MacPhail, who knew the tone and  bearing of the country throughout, was joined the zealous co-operation  of Officer Lloyd, of Major O'Bierne's staff, who had a personal feeling  against the secessionists of lower Maryland; they had once driven him  away for his loyalty, and had reserved their hospitality for assassins.    Lieutenant Commander Gushing, I am informed, also rendered important  services to the government in connection with the police operations.  Volunteer detectives, such as Ex-Marshal Lewis and Angelis, were  plentiful; it is probable that in the pitch of the excitement five  hundred detective officers were in and around Washington city. At the  same time the secret police of Richmond abandoned their ordinary  business, and devoted themselves solely to this overshadowing offense.    No citizen, in these terrible days, knows what eyes were upon him as he  talked and walked, nor how his stature and guise were keenly scanned by  folks who passed him absent-faced, yet with his mental portrait  carefully turned over, the while some invisible hand clutched a  revolver, and held a life or death challenge upon his lips.    The military forces were commanded by Colonel Welles, of the Twenty  sixth Michigan regiment, whose activity and zeal were amply sustained by  Colonel Clendenning, of the Eighth Illinois cavalry, probably the finest  body of horse in the service.    The first party to take the South Maryland road was dispatched by Major  O'Bierne, and commanded by Lieutenant Lovett, of the Veteran Reserves.  It consisted of twenty-five cavalry men, with detectives Cottingham,  Lloyd, and Gavigan; these latter, with the lieutenant, kept well in  advance. They made inquiries of a soothing and cautious character, but  saw nothing suspicious until they arrived at Piscataway, where an  unknown man, some distance ahead, observed them, and took to the woods.  This was on Sunday night, forty hours after the murder.    Guided by Officer Lloyd, the little band dashed on, arriving at  Bryantown on Tuesday. Here they arrested John Lloyd, of the hotel at  Surrattsville, of whom they had previously inquired for the murderers,  and he had said positively that he neither knew them nor had seen  anybody whatever on the night of the crime. He was returning in a wagon,  with his wife, whom he had ordered, the day before, to go on a visit to  Allen's Fresh, The Monday afterward he started to bring her back. This  woman, frightened at the arrest, acknowledged at once that in her  husband's conduct there was some inexplicable mystery. He was taciturn  and defiant as before, until confronted by some of his old Union  neighbors.    The few Unionists of Prince George's and Charles counties, long  persecuted and intimidated, now came forward and gave important  testimony.    Among these was one Roby, a very fat and very zealous old gentleman,  whose professions were as ample as his perspiration. He told the  officers of the secret meetings for conspiracy's, sake at Lloyd's Hotel,  and although a very John Gilpin on horseback, rode here and there to his  great loss of wind and repose, fastening fire-coals upon the guilty or  suspected.    Lloyd was turned over to Mr. Cottingham, who had established a jail at  Robytown; that night his house was searched, and Booth's carbine found  hidden in the wall. Three days afterward, Lloyd himself confessed--and  his neck is quite nervous at this writing.    This little party, under the untiring Lovett, examined all the  farm-houses below Washington resorting to many shrewd expedients, and  taking note of the great swamps to the east of Port Tobacco; they  reached Newport at last and fastened tacit guilt upon many residents.    Beyond Bryantown they overhauled the residence of Doctor Mudd and found  Booth's boot. This was before Lloyd confessed, and was the first  positive trace the officers had that they were really close upon the  assassins.    I do not recall anything more wild and startling than this vague and  dangerous exploration of a dimly known, hostile, and ignorant country.  To these few detectives we owe much of the subsequent successful  prosecution of the pursuit. They were the Hebrew spies.    By this time the country was filling up with soldiers, but previously a  second memorable detective party went out under the personal command of  Major O'Bierne. It consisted, besides that officer, of Lee, D'Angellia,  Callahan, Hoey, Bostwick, Hanover, Bevins, and McHenry, and embarked at  Washington on a steam-tug for Chappell's Point. Here a military station  had long been established for the prevention of blockade and  mail-running across the Potomao. It was commanded by Lieutenant Laverty,  and garrisoned by sixty-five men. On Tuesday night, Major O'Bierne's  party reached this place, and soon afterwards, a telegraph station was  established here by an invaluable man to the expedition, Captain  Beckwith, General Grant's chief cypher operator, who tapped the Point  Lookout wire, and placed the War Department within a moment's reach of  the theater of events.    Major O'Bierne's party started at once over the worst road in the world  for Port Tobacco.    If any place in the world is utterly given over to depravity, it is Port  Tobacco. From this town, by a sinuous creek, there is flat boat  navigation to the Potomac, and across that river to Mattox's creek.  Before the war Port Tobacco was the seat of a tobacco aristocracy and a  haunt of negro traders. It passed very naturally into a rebel post for  blockade-runners and a rebel post-office general. Gambling, corner  fighting, and shooting matches were its lyceum education. Violence and  ignorance had every suffrage in the town. Its people were smugglers, to  all intents, and there was neither Bible nor geography to the whole  region adjacent. Assassination was never very unpopular at Port Tobacco,  and when its victim was a northern president it became quite heroic. A  month before the murder a provost-marshal near by was slain in his  bed-chamber. For such a town and district the detective police were the  only effective missionaries. The hotel here is called the Brawner House;  it has a bar in the nethermost cellar, and its patrons, carousing in  that imperfect light, look like the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6630"],[0,"Curiosities of the Sky (#16)"],[1,"magnetic fields, and consist of columns of ionized vapors  rotating in opposite directions in the two hemispheres. A fact which  may have the greatest significance is that titanium and vanadium have  been found both in sun-spots and in the remarkable variable Mira Ceti,  a star which every eleven months, or thereabout, flames up with great  brilliancy and then sinks back to invisibility with the naked eye. It  has been suggested that sun-spots are indications of the beginning of  a process in the sun which will be intensified until it falls into the  state of such a star as Mira. Stars very far advanced in evolution,  without showing variability, also exhibit similar spectra; so that  there is much reason for regarding sunspots as emblems of advancing  age.    The association of the corona with sun-spots is less evident than that  of the eruptive prominences; still such an association exists, for the  form and extent of the corona vary with the sun-spot period of which  we shall presently speak. The constitution of the corona remains to be  discovered. It is evidently in part gaseous, but it also probably  contains matter in the form of dust and small meteors. It includes one  substance altogether mysterious -- ``coronium.'' There are reasons for  thinking that this may be the lightest of all the elements, and  Professor Young, its discoverer, said that it was ``absolutely unique  in nature; utterly distinct from any other known form of matter,  terrestial, solar, or cosmical.'' The enormous extent of the corona is  one of its riddles. Since the development of the curious subject of  the ``pressure of light'' it has been proposed to account for the  sustentation of the corona by supposing that it is borne upon the  billows of light continually poured out from the sun. Experiment has  proved, what mathematical considerations had previously pointed out as  probable, that the waves of light exert a pressure or driving force,  which becomes evident in its effects if the body acted upon is  sufficiently small. In that case the light pressure will prevail over  the attraction of gravitation, and propel the attenuated matter away  from the sun in the teeth of its attraction. The earth itself would be  driven away if, instead of consisting of a solid globe of immense  aggregate mass, it were a cloud of microscopic particles. The reason  is that the pressure varies in proportion to the surface of the body  acted upon, while the gravitational attraction is proportional to the  volume, or the total amount of matter in the body. But the surface of  any body depends upon the square of its diameter, while the volume  depends upon the cube of the diameter. If, for instance, the diameter  is represented by 4, the surface will be proportional to 4 x 4, or 16,  and the volume to 4 x 4 x 4, or 64; but if the diameter is taken as 2,  the surface will be 2 x 2, or 4, and the volume 2 x 2 x 2, or 8. Now,  the ratio of 4 to 8 is twice as great as that of 16 to 64. If the  diameter is still further decreased, the ratio of the surface to the  volume will proportionally grow larger; in other words, the pressure  will gain upon the attraction, and whatever their original ratio may  have been, a time will come, if the diminution of size continues, when  the pressure will become more effective than the attraction, and the  body will be driven away. Supposing the particles of the corona to be  below the critical size for the attraction of a mass like that of the  sun to control them, they would be driven off into the surrounding  space and appear around the sun like the clouds of dust around a mill.  We shall return to this subject in connection with the Zodiacal Light,  the Aurora, and Comets.    On the other hand, there are parts of the corona which suggest by  their forms the play of electric or magnetic forces. This is  beautifully shown in some of the photographs that have been made of  the corona during recent eclipses. Take, for instance, that of the  eclipse of 1900. The sheaves of light emanating from the poles look  precisely like the ``lines of force'' surrounding the poles of a  magnet. It will be noticed in this photograph that the corona appears  to consist of two portions: one comprising the polar rays just spoken  of, and the other consisting of the broader, longer, and less-defined  masses of light extending out from the equatorial and middle-latitude  zones. Yet even in this more diffuse part of the phenomenon one can  detect the presence of submerged curves bearing more or less  resemblance to those about the poles. Just what part electricity or  electro-magnetism plays in the mechanism of the solar radiation it is  impossible to say, but on the assumption that it is a very important  part is based the hypothesis that there exists a direct solar  influence not only upon the magnetism, but upon the weather of the  earth. This hypothesis has been under discussion for half a century,  and still we do not know just how much truth it represents. It is  certain that the outbreak of great disturbances on the sun,  accompanied by the formation of sun-spots and the upshooting of  eruptive prominences (phenomena which we should naturally expect to be  attended by action), have been instantly followed by corresponding  ``magnetic storms'' on the earth and brilliant displays of the auroral  lights. There have been occasions when the influence has manifested  itself in the most startling ways, a great solar outburst being  followed by a mysterious gripping of the cable and telegraph systems  of the world, as if an invisible and irresistible hand had seized  them. Messages are abruptly cut off, sparks leap from the telegraph  instruments, and the entire earth seems to have been thrown into a  magnetic flurry. These occurrences affect the mind with a deep  impression of the dependence of our planet on the sun, such as we do  not derive from the more familiar action of the sunlight on the growth  of plants and other phenomena of life depending on solar influences.    Perhaps the theory of solar magnetic influence upon the weather is  best known in connection with the ``sun-spot cycle.'' This, at any  rate, is, as already remarked, closely associated with the corona. Its  existence was discovered in 1843 by the German astronomer Schwabe. It  is a period of variable length, averaging about eleven years, during  which the number of spots visible on the sun first increases to a  maximum, then diminishes to a minimum, and finally increases again to  a maximum. For unknown reasons the period is sometimes two or three  years longer than the average and sometimes as much shorter.  Nevertheless, the phenomena always recur in the same order. Starting,  for instance, with a time when the observer can find few or no spots,  they gradually increase in number and size until a maximum, in both  senses, is reached, during which the spots are often of enormous size  and exceedingly active. After two or three years they begin to  diminish in number, magnitude, and activity until they almost or quite  disappear. A strange fact is that when a new period opens, the spots  appear first in high northern and southern latitudes, far from the  solar equator, and as the period advances they not only increase in  number and size, but break out nearer and nearer to the equator, the  last spots of a vanishing period sometimes lingering in the equatorial  region after the advance-guard of its successor has made its  appearance in the high latitudes. Spots are never seen on the equator  nor near the poles. It was not very long after the discovery of the  sun-spot cycle that the curious observation was made that a striking  coincidence existed between the period of the sun-spots and another  period affecting the general magnetic condition of the earth. When a  curved line representing the varying number of sun-spots was compared  with another curve showing the variations in the magnetic state of the  earth the two were seen to be in almost exact accord, a rise in one  curve corresponding to a rise in the other, and a fall to a fall.  Continued observation has proved that this is a real coincidence and  not an accidental one, so that the connection, although as yet  unexplained, is accepted as established. But does the influence extend  further, and directly affect the weather and the seasons as well as  the magnetic elements of the earth? A final answer to this question  cannot yet be given, for the evidence is contradictory, and the  interpretations put upon it depend largely on the predilections of the  judges.    But, in a broad sense, the sun-spots and the phenomena connected with  them must have a relation to terrestial meteorology, for they prove  the sun to be a variable star. Reference was made, a few lines above,  to the resemblance of the spectra of sun-spots to those of certain  stars which seem to be failing through age. This in itself is  extremely suggestive; but if this resemblance had never been  discovered, we should have been justified in regarding the sun as  variable in its output of energy; and not only variable, but probably  increasingly so. The very inequalities in the sun-spot cycle are  suspicious. When the sun is most spotted its total light may be  reduced by one-thousandth part, although it is by no means certain  that its outgiving of thermal radiations is then reduced. A loss of  one-thousandth of its luminosity would correspond to a decrease of  .0025 of a stellar magnitude, considering the sun as a star viewed  from distant space. So slight a change would not be perceptible; but  it is not alone sun-spots which obscure the solar surface, its entire  globe is enveloped with an obscuring veil. When studied with a  powerful telescope the sun's surface is seen to be thickly mottled  with relatively obscure specks, so numerous that it has been estimated  that they cut off from one-tenth to one-twentieth of the light that we  should"]]]
