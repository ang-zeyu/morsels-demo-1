O Lord,      remember thy servant, Joseph Smith, Jr., and all his afflictions      and persecutions, how he has covenanted with Jehovah, and vowed      to thee, O mighty God of Jacob, and the commandments which thou      hast given unto him, and that he hath sincerely striven to do thy      will. Have mercy, O Lord, upon his wife and children, that they      may be exalted in thy presence, and preserved by thy fostering      hand; have mercy upon all their immediate connections, that their      prejudices may be broken up, and swept away as with a flood, that      they may be converted and redeemed with Israel, and know that thou      art God. Remember, O Lord, the presidents, even all the presidents      of thy church, that thy right hand may exalt them, with all their      families, and their immediate connections, that their names may be      perpetuated, and had in everlasting remembrance, from generation      to generation. Remember all thy church, O Lord, with all their      families, and all their immediate connections, with all their sick      and afflicted ones, with all the poor and meek of the earth, that      the kingdom which thou hast set up without hands, may become a      great mountain, and fill the whole earth; that thy church may come      forth out of the wilderness of darkness, and shine forth fair as      the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners,      and be adorned as a bride for that day when thou shalt unveil the      heavens, and cause the mountains to flow down at thy presence, and      the valleys to be exalted, the rough places made smooth; that thy      glory may fill the earth, that when the trump shall sound for the      dead, we shall be caught up in the cloud to meet thee, that we may      ever be with the Lord, that our garments may be pure, that we may      be clothed upon with robes of righteousness, with palms in our      hands, and crowns of glory upon our heads, and reap eternal joy for      all our sufferings.        \"O Lord God Almighty, hear us in these petitions, and answer us      from heaven, thy holy habitation, where thou sittest enthroned,      with glory, honor, power, majesty, might, dominion, truth, justice,      judgment, mercy, and an infinity of fullness, from everlasting to      everlasting. O hear, O hear, O hear us, O Lord, and answer these      petitions, and accept the dedication of this house unto thee, the      work of our hands, which we have built unto thy name! And also this      church, to put upon it thy name; and help us by the power of thy      spirit, that we may mingle our voices with those bright shining      seraphs around thy throne, with acclamations of praise, singing      hosanna to God and the Lamb; and let these thine anointed ones be      clothed with salvation, and thy saints shout aloud for joy. Amen,      and amen.\"    The choir then sang, \"The spirit of God like a fire is burning,\" etc.,  after which the Lord's supper was administered to the whole assembly.  Then President Joseph Smith bore testimony of his mission and of the  ministration of angels, and, after testimonials and exhortations by  other elders, he blest the congregation in the name of the Lord.    Thus ended the ceremonies of the dedication or the first temple built  by special command of the Most High, in this dispensation.    One striking feature of the ceremonies, was the grand shout of  hosanna, which was given by the whole assembly, in standing  position, with uplifted hands. The form of the shout is as follows:  \"Hosanna--hosanna--hosanna--to God and the Lamb--amen--amen, and  amen.\" The foregoing was deliberately and emphatically pronounced, and  three times repeated, and with such power as seemed almost sufficient  to raise the roof from the building.    A singular incident in connection with this shout may be discredited by  some, but it is verily true. A notice had been circulated that children  in arms would not be admitted at the dedication of the temple. A sister  who had come a long distance with her babe, six weeks old, having, on  her arrival, heard of the above requisition, went to the patriarch  Joseph Smith, Sr., in great distress, saying that she knew no one with  whom she could leave her infant; and to be deprived of the privilege of  attending the dedication seemed more than she could endure. The ever  generous and kind-hearted father volunteered to take the responsibility  on himself, and told her to take her child, at the same time giving  the mother a promise that her babe should make no disturbance; and the  promise was verified. But when the congregation shouted hosanna, that  babe joined in the shout. As marvelous as that incident may appear to  many, it is not more so than other occurrences on that occasion.    The ceremonies of that dedication may be rehearsed, but no mortal  language can describe the heavenly manifestations of that memorable  day. Angels appeared to some, while a sense of divine presence  was realized by all present, and each heart was filled with \"joy  inexpressible and full of glory.\"        CHAPTER XIII.    THE ANCIENT ORDER OF BLESSINGS--THE PROPHET'S FATHER--THE  PATRIARCH'S MOTHER--HIS FATHER--KIRTLAND HIGH SCHOOL--APOSTASY AND  PERSECUTION--EXODUS OF THE CHURCH.    Concerning affairs at Kirtland subsequent to the dedication of the  temple, and people and incidents of those times, Eliza R. Snow  continues: With the restoration of the fullness of the gospel came  also the ancient order of patriarchal blessings. Each father, holding  the priesthood, stands as a patriarch, at the head of his family,  with invested right and power to bless his household, and to predict  concerning the future, on the heads of his children, as did Jacob of  old.    Inasmuch as many fathers have died without having conferred those  blessings, God, in the order of his kingdom, has made provisions to  supply the deficiency, by choosing men to officiate as patriarchs,  whose province it is to bless the fatherless. Joseph Smith, Sr., was  ordained to this office, and held the position of first patriarch in  the church. He was also, by appointment, president of the Kirtland  stake of Zion, consequently the first presiding officer in all general  meetings for worship.    A few words descriptive of this noble man may not be deemed amiss  in this connection. Of a fine physique, he was more than ordinarily  prepossessing in personal appearance. His kind, affable, dignified and  unassuming manner naturally inspired strangers with feelings of love  and reverence. To me he was the veritable personification of my idea of  the ancient Father Abraham.    In his decisions he was strictly just; what can be said of very  few, may be truly said of him, in judging between man and man: his  judgment could not be biased by either personal advantage, sympathy,  or affection. Such a man was worthy of being the father of the first  prophet of the last dispensation; while his amiable and affectionate  consort, Mother Lucy Smith, was as worthy of being the mother. Of her  faith, faithfulness and untiring efforts in labors of love and duty,  until she was broken down by the weight of years and sorrow, too much  cannot be said.    I was present, on the 17th of May, when a messenger arrived and  informed the prophet Joseph that his grandmother, Mary Duty Smith, had  arrived at Fairport, on her way to Kirtland, and wished him to come for  her. The messenger stated that she said she had asked the Lord that she  might live to see her children and grandchildren once more. The prophet  responded with earnestness, \"I wish she had set the time longer.\" I  pondered in silence over this remark, thinking there might be more  meaning in the expression than the words indicated, which was proven by  the result, for she only lived a few days after her arrival. She was in  the ninety-fourth year of her age--in appearance not over seventy-five.  She had not been baptized, on account of the opposition of her oldest  son, Jesse, who was a bitter enemy to the work. She said to Mother Lucy  Smith, \"I am going to have your Joseph baptize me, and my Joseph (the  patriarch) bless me.\"    Her husband, Israel Smith, died in St. Lawrence county, New York, after  having received the Book of Mormon, and read it nearly through. He had,  long before, predicted that a prophet would be raised up in his family,  and was satisfied that his grandson was that prophet. The venerable  widow was also well assured of the fact.    The next day after her arrival at the house of the prophet, where she  was welcomed with every manifestation of kindness and affection, her  children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren--all who were residents  of Kirtland, and two of her sons, who arrived with her--came together  to enjoy with her a social family meeting; and a happy one it was--a  season of pure reciprocal conviviality, in which her buoyancy of spirit  greatly augmented the general joy. Let the reader imagine for a moment  this aged matron, surrounded by her four sons, Joseph, Asael, Silas  and John, all of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/544"],[0,"Anne's House of Dreams (#16)"],[1,"before they had found him lying  on their doorstep one morning in an awful condition--his head battered  to a jelly almost.  They supposed he'd got hurt in some drunken row,  and likely that's the truth of it.  They took him in, never thinking he  could live.  But he did--and he was just like a child when he got well.  He hadn't memory or intellect or reason.  They tried to find out who he  was but they never could.  He couldn't even tell them his name--he  could only say a few simple words.  He had a letter on him beginning  'Dear Dick' and signed 'Leslie,' but there was no address on it and the  envelope was gone.  They let him stay on--he learned to do a few odd  jobs about the place--and there Captain Jim found him.  He brought him  home--I've always said it was a bad day's work, though I s'pose there  was nothing else he could do.  He thought maybe when Dick got home and  saw his old surroundings and familiar faces his memory would wake up.  But it hadn't any effect.  There he's been at the house up the brook  ever since.  He's just like a child, no more nor less.  Takes fractious  spells occasionally, but mostly he's just vacant and good humored and  harmless.  He's apt to run away if he isn't watched.  That's the burden  Leslie has had to carry for eleven years--and all alone.  Old Abner  Moore died soon after Dick was brought home and it was found he was  almost bankrupt.  When things were settled up there was nothing for  Leslie and Dick but the old West farm.  Leslie rented it to John Ward,  and the rent is all she has to live on.  Sometimes in summer she takes  a boarder to help out.  But most visitors prefer the other side of the  harbor where the hotels and summer cottages are.  Leslie's house is too  far from the bathing shore.  She's taken care of Dick and she's never  been away from him for eleven years--she's tied to that imbecile for  life.  And after all the dreams and hopes she once had!  You can  imagine what it has been like for her, Anne, dearie--with her beauty  and spirit and pride and cleverness.  It's just been a living death.\"    \"Poor, poor girl!\" said Anne again.  Her own happiness seemed to  reproach her.  What right had she to be so happy when another human  soul must be so miserable?    \"Will you tell me just what Leslie said and how she acted the night you  met her on the shore?\" asked Miss Cornelia.    She listened intently and nodded her satisfaction.    \"YOU thought she was stiff and cold, Anne, dearie, but I can tell you  she thawed out wonderful for her.  She must have taken to you real  strong.  I'm so glad.  You may be able to help her a good deal.  I was  thankful when I heard that a young couple was coming to this house, for  I hoped it would mean some friends for Leslie; especially if you  belonged to the race that knows Joseph.  You WILL be her friend, won't  you, Anne, dearie?\"    \"Indeed I will, if she'll let me,\" said Anne, with all her own sweet,  impulsive earnestness.    \"No, you must be her friend, whether she'll let you or not,\" said Miss  Cornelia resolutely.  \"Don't you mind if she's stiff by times--don't  notice it.  Remember what her life has been--and is--and must always  be, I suppose, for creatures like Dick Moore live forever, I  understand.  You should see how fat he's got since he came home.  He  used to be lean enough.  Just MAKE her be friends--you can do  it--you're one of those who have the knack.  Only you mustn't be  sensitive.  And don't mind if she doesn't seem to want you to go over  there much.  She knows that some women don't like to be where Dick  is--they complain he gives them the creeps.  Just get her to come over  here as often as she can.  She can't get away so very much--she can't  leave Dick long, for the Lord knows what he'd do--burn the house down  most likely.  At nights, after he's in bed and asleep, is about the  only time she's free.  He always goes to bed early and sleeps like the  dead till next morning.  That is how you came to meet her at the shore  likely.  She wanders there considerable.\"    \"I will do everything I can for her,\" said Anne.  Her interest in  Leslie Moore, which had been vivid ever since she had seen her driving  her geese down the hill, was intensified a thousand fold by Miss  Cornelia's narration.  The girl's beauty and sorrow and loneliness drew  her with an irresistible fascination.  She had never known anyone like  her; her friends had hitherto been wholesome, normal, merry girls like  herself, with only the average trials of human care and bereavement to  shadow their girlish dreams.  Leslie Moore stood apart, a tragic,  appealing figure of thwarted womanhood.  Anne resolved that she would  win entrance into the kingdom of that lonely soul and find there the  comradeship it could so richly give, were it not for the cruel fetters  that held it in a prison not of its own making.    \"And mind you this, Anne, dearie,\" said Miss Cornelia, who had not yet  wholly relieved her mind, \"You mustn't think Leslie is an infidel  because she hardly ever goes to church--or even that she's a Methodist.  She can't take Dick to church, of course--not that he ever troubled  church much in his best days.  But you just remember that she's a real  strong Presbyterian at heart, Anne, dearie.\"        CHAPTER 12    LESLIE COMES OVER    Leslie came over to the house of dreams one frosty October night, when  moonlit mists were hanging over the harbor and curling like silver  ribbons along the seaward glens.  She looked as if she repented coming  when Gilbert answered her knock; but Anne flew past him, pounced on  her, and drew her in.    \"I'm so glad you picked tonight for a call,\" she said gaily.  \"I made  up a lot of extra good fudge this afternoon and we want someone to help  us eat it--before the fire--while we tell stories.  Perhaps Captain Jim  will drop in, too.  This is his night.\"    \"No.  Captain Jim is over home,\" said Leslie.  \"He--he made me come  here,\" she added, half defiantly.    \"I'll say a thank-you to him for that when I see him,\" said Anne,  pulling easy chairs before the fire.    \"Oh, I don't mean that I didn't want to come,\" protested Leslie,  flushing a little.  \"I--I've been thinking of coming--but it isn't  always easy for me to get away.\"    \"Of course it must be hard for you to leave Mr. Moore,\" said Anne, in a  matter-of-fact tone.  She had decided that it would be best to mention  Dick Moore occasionally as an accepted fact, and not give undue  morbidness to the subject by avoiding it.  She was right, for Leslie's  air of constraint suddenly vanished.  Evidently she had been wondering  how much Anne knew of the conditions of her life and was relieved that  no explanations were needed.  She allowed her cap and jacket to be  taken, and sat down with a girlish snuggle in the big armchair by  Magog.  She was dressed prettily and carefully, with the customary  touch of color in the scarlet geranium at her white throat.  Her  beautiful hair gleamed like molten gold in the warm firelight.  Her  sea-blue eyes were full of soft laughter and allurement. For the  moment, under the influence of the little house of dreams, she was a  girl again--a girl forgetful of the past and its bitterness.  The  atmosphere of the many loves that had sanctified the little house was  all about her; the companionship of two healthy, happy, young folks of  her own generation encircled her; she felt and yielded to the magic of  her surroundings--Miss Cornelia and Captain Jim would scarcely have  recognized her; Anne found it hard to believe that this was the cold,  unresponsive woman she had met on the shore--this animated girl who  talked and listened with the eagerness of a starved soul.  And how  hungrily Leslie's eyes looked at the bookcases between the windows!    \"Our library isn't very extensive,\" said Anne, \"but every book in it is  a FRIEND.  We've picked our books up through the years, here and there,  never buying one until we had first read it and knew that it belonged  to the race of Joseph.\"    Leslie laughed--beautiful laughter that seemed akin to all the mirth  that had echoed through the little house in the vanished years.    \"I have a few books of father's--not many,\" she said.  \"I've read them  until I know them almost by heart.  I don't get many books.  There's a  circulating library at the Glen store--but I don't think the committee  who pick the books for Mr. Parker know what books are of Joseph's  race--or perhaps they don't care.  It was so seldom I got one I really  liked that I gave up getting any.\"    \"I hope you'll look on our bookshelves as your own,\" said Anne.    \"You are entirely and wholeheartedly welcome to the loan of any book on  them.\"    \"You are setting a feast of fat things before me,\" said Leslie,  joyously.  Then, as the clock struck ten, she rose, half unwillingly.    \"I must go.  I didn't realise it was so late.  Captain Jim is always  saying it doesn't take long to stay an hour.  But I've stayed two--and  oh, but I've enjoyed them,\" she added frankly.    \"Come often,\" said Anne and Gilbert.  They had risen and stood together  in the firelight's glow.  Leslie looked at them--youthful, hopeful,  happy, typifying all she had missed and must forever miss.  The light  went out of her face and eyes; the girl vanished; it was the sorrowful,  cheated woman who answered the invitation almost coldly and got herself  away with a pitiful haste.    Anne watched her until she was lost in the shadows of the chill and  misty night.  Then she turned slowly back to the glow of her own  radiant hearthstone.    \"Isn't she lovely, Gilbert?  Her hair fascinates me.  Miss Cornelia  says it reaches to her feet.  Ruby Gillis had beautiful hair--but  Leslie's is ALIVE--every thread of it is living gold.\"    \"She is very beautiful,\" agreed Gilbert, so heartily that Anne almost  wished he were a LITTLE less enthusiastic.    \"Gilbert, would you like my hair better if it were like Leslie's?\" she  asked"]]]
