The march onward for the next two days was tiresome; but the Indians  Tolpec had secured were as faithful and efficient as he had described  them, and good progress was made.    There were a few accidents.  One native fell into a swiftly running  stream as they were fording it and lost a box containing some  much-needed things.  But as the man's life was saved Professor Bumper  said it made up for the other loss.  Another accident did not end so  auspiciously.  One of the bearers was bitten by a poisonous snake, and  though prompt measures were taken, the poison spread so rapidly that  the man died.    In due season the Indian village was reached, where, after a day spent  in holding funeral services over the dead bearer, preparations were  made for proceeding farther.    This time some of the bearers were left behind, and ox-carts were  substituted for them, as it was possible to carry more goods this way.    \"And now we're really off for Copan!\" exclaimed Professor Bumper one  morning, when the cavalcade, led by Tolpec in the capacity of head  guide, started off.  \"I hope we have no more delays.\"    \"I hope not, either,\" agreed Tom.  \"That Beecher may be there ahead of  us.\"    Weary marches fell to their portion.  There were mountains to climb,  streams to ford or swim, sending the carts over on rudely made rafts.  There were storms to endure, and the eternal heat to fight.    But finally the party emerged from the lowlands of the coast and went  up in among the hills, where though the going was harder, the climate  was better.  It was not so hot and moist.    Not wishing to attract attention in Copan itself, Professor Bumper and  his party made a detour, and finally, after much consultation with Tom  over the ancient maps, the scientist announced that he thought they  were in the vicinity of the buried city.    \"We will begin test excavations in the morning,\" he said.    The party was in camp, and preparations were made for spending the  night in the forest, when from among the trees there floated to the  ears of our friends a queer Indian chant.    \"Some one is coming,\" said Tom to Ned.    Almost as he spoke there filed into the clearing where the camp had  been set up, a cavalcade of white men, followed by Indians.  And at the  sight of one of the white men Tom Swift uttered a cry.    \"Professor Beecher!\" gasped the young inventor.          CHAPTER XVII    THE LOST MAP      The on-marching company of white men, with their Indian attendants,  came to a halt on the edge of the clearing as they caught sight of the  tents already set up there.  The barbaric chant of the native bearers  ceased abruptly, and there was a look of surprise shown on the face of  Professor Fenimore Beecher.  For Professor Beecher it was, in the lead  of the rival expedition.    \"Bless my shoe laces!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon.    \"Is it really Beecher?\" asked Ned, though he knew as well as Tom that  it was the young archaeologist.    \"It certainly is!\" declared Tom.  \"And he has nerve to follow us so  closely!\"    \"Maybe he thinks we have nerve to get here ahead of him,\" suggested  Ned, smiling grimly.    \"Probably,\" agreed Tom, with a short laugh.  \"Well, it evidently  surprises him to find us here at all, after the mean trick he played on  us to get Jacinto to lead us into the jungle and desert us.\"    \"That's right,\" assented Ned.  \"Well, what's the next move?\"    There seemed to be some doubt about this on the part of both  expeditions.  At the sight of Professor Beecher, Professor Bumper, who  had come out of his tent, hurriedly turned to Tom and asked him what he  thought it best to do.    \"Do!\" exclaimed the eccentric Mr. Damon, not giving Tom time to reply.  \"Why, stand your ground, of course! Bless my house and lot! but we're  here first! For the matter of that, I suppose the jungle is free and we  can no more object to his coming here than he can to our coming.  First come, first served, I suppose is the law of the forest.\"    Meanwhile the surprise occasioned by the unexpected meeting of their  rivals seemed to have spread something like consternation among the  white members of the Beecher party.  As for the natives they evidently  did not care one way or the other.    There was a hasty consultation among the professors accompanying Mr.  Beecher, and then the latter himself advanced toward the tents of Tom  and his friends and asked:    \"How long have you been here?\"    \"I don't see that we are called upon to answer that question,\" replied  Professor Bumper stiffly.    \"Perhaps not, and yet----\"    \"There is no perhaps about it!\" said Professor Bumper quickly.  \"I know  what your object is, as I presume you do mine.  And, after what I may  term your disgraceful and unsportsmanlike conduct toward me and my  friends, I prefer not to have anything further to do with you.  We must  meet as strangers hereafter.\"    \"Very well,\" and Professor Beecher's voice was as cold and  uncompromising as was his rival's.  \"Let it be as your wish.  But I  must say I don't know what you mean by unsportsmanlike conduct.\"    \"An explanation would be wasted on you,\" said Professor Bumper stiffly.  \"But in order that you may know I fully understand what you did I will  say that your efforts to thwart us through your tool Jacinto came to  nothing.  We are here ahead of you.\"    \"Jacinto!\" cried Professor Beecher in real or simulated surprise.  \"Why, he was not my 'tool,' as you term it.\"    \"Your denial is useless in the light of his confession,\" asserted  Professor Bumper.    \"Confession?\"    \"Now look here!\" exclaimed the older professor, \"I do not propose to  lower myself by quarreling with you.  I know certainly what you and  your party tried to do to prevent us from getting here.  But we got out  of the trap you set for us, and we are on the ground first.  I  recognize your right to make explorations as well as ourselves, and I  presume you have not fallen so low that you will not recognize the  unwritten law in a case of this kind--the law which says the right of  discovery belongs to the one who first makes it.\"    \"I shall certainly abide by such conduct as is usual under the  circumstances,\" said Professor Beecher more stiffly than before.  \"At  the same time I must deny having set a trap.  And as for Jacinto----\"    \"It will be useless to discuss it further!\" broke in Professor Bumper.    \"Then no more need be said,\" retorted the younger man.  \"I shall give  orders to my friends, as well as to the natives, to keep away from your  camp, and I shall expect you to do the same regarding mine.\"    \"I should have suggested the same thing myself,\" came from Tom's  friend, and the two rival scientists fairly glared at one another, the  others of both parties looking on with interest.    Professor Bumper turned and walked defiantly back to his tent.  Professor Beecher did the same thing.  Then, after a short consultation  among the white members of the latter's organization, their tents were  set up in another clearing, removed and separated by a screen of trees  and bushes from those of Tom Swift's friends.  The natives of the  Beecher party also withdrew a little way from those of Professor  Bumper's organization, and then preparations for spending the night in  the jungle went on in the rival headquarters.    \"Well, he certainly had nerve, to deny, practically, that he had set  Jacinto up to do what he did,\" commented Tom.    \"I should say so!\" agreed Ned.    \"How do you imagine he got here nearly as soon as we did, when he did  not start until later?\" asked Mr. Damon.    \"He did not have the unfortunate experience of being deserted in the  jungle,\" replied Tom.  \"He probably had Jacinto, or some of that  unprincipled scoundrel's friends, show him a short route to Copan and  he came on from there.\"    \"Well, I did hope we might have the ground to ourselves, at least for  the preliminary explorations and excavations.  But it is not to be.  My  rival is here,\" sighed Professor Bumper.    \"Don't let that discourage you!\" exclaimed Tom.  \"We can fight all the  better now the foe is in the open, and we know where he is.\"    \"Yes, Tom Swift, that is true,\" agreed the scientist.  \"I am not going  to give up, but I shall have to change my plans a little.  Perhaps you  will come into the tent with me,\" and he nodded to Tom and Ned.  \"I  want to talk over certain matters with you and Mr. Damon.\"    \"Pleased to,\" assented the young inventor, and his financial secretary  nodded.    A little later, supper having been eaten, the camp made shipshape and  the natives settled down, Tom, Ned, Mr. Damon and Professor Bumper  assembled in the tent of the scientist, where a dry battery lamp gave  sufficient illumination to show a number of maps and papers scattered  over an improvised table.    \"Now, gentlemen,\" said the professor, \"I have called you here to go  over my plans more in detail than I have hitherto done, now we are on  the ground.  You know in a general way what I hope to accomplish, but  the time has come when I must be specific.    \"Aside from being on the spot, below which, or below the vicinity  where, I believe, lies the lost city of Kurzon and, I hope, the idol of  gold, a situation has arisen--an unexpected situation, I may say--which  calls for different action from that I had counted on.    \"I refer to the presence of my rival, Professor Beecher.  I will not  dwell now on what he has done.  It is better to consider what he may  do.\"    \"That's right,\" agreed Ned.  \"He may get up in the night, dig up this  city and skip with that golden image before we know it.\"    \"Hardly,\" grinned Tom.    \"No,\" said Professor Bumper.  \"Excavating buried cities in the jungle  of Honduras is not as simple as that.  There is much work to be done.  But accidents may happen, and in case one should occur to me, and I be  unable to prosecute the search, I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5000"],[0,"The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci — Complete (#16)"],[1,"in shadow will see that the deepest  shadows on that body will meet the eye at equal angles, that is at  the same angle as that of sight.    [Footnote: In both these diagrams _A_ stands for _lume_ (light) _B_  for _ombra_ (shadow).]    145.    OF THE DIFFERENT LIGHT AND SHADE IN VARIOUS ASPECTS AND OF OBJECTS  PLACED IN THEM.    If the sun is in the East and you look towards the West you will see  every thing in full light and totally without shadow because you see  them from the same side as the sun: and if you look towards the  South or North you will see all objects in light and shade, because  you see both the side towards the sun and the side away from it; and  if you look towards the coming of the sun all objects will show you  their shaded side, because on that side the sun cannot fall upon  them.    The law of the incidence of light.    146.    The edges of a window which are illuminated by 2 lights of equal  degrees of brightness will not reflect light of equal brightness  into the chamber within.    If _b_ is a candle and _a c_ our hemisphere both will illuminate the  edges of the window _m_ _n_, but light _b_ will only illuminate _f  g_ and the hemisphere _a_ will light all of _d e_.    147.    OF PAINTING.    That part of a body which receives the luminous rays at equal angles  will be in a higher light than any other part of it.    And the part which the luminous rays strike between less equal  angles will be less strongly illuminated.    SECOND BOOK ON LIGHT AND SHADE.    Gradations of strength in the shadows (148. 149).    148.    THAT PORTION OF A BODY IN LIGHT AND SHADE WILL BE LEAST LUMINOUS  WHICH IS SEEN UNDER THE LEAST AMOUNT OF LIGHT.    That part of the object which is marked _m_ is in the highest light  because it faces the window _a d_ by the line _a f_; _n_ is in the  second grade because the light _b d_ strikes it by the line _b e_;  _o_ is in the third grade, as the light falls on it from _c d_ by  the line _c h_; _p_ is the lowest light but one as _c d_ falls on it  by the line _d v_; _q_ is the deepest shadow for no light falls on  it from any part of the window.    In proportion as _c d_ goes into _a d_ so will _n r s_ be darker  than _m_, and all the rest is space without shadow.    [Footnote: The diagram belonging to this chapter is No. 1 on Plate  III. The letters _a b e d_ and _r_ are not reproduced in facsimile  of the original, but have been replaced by ordinary type in the  margin. 5-12. The original text of these lines is reproduced within  the diagram.--Compare No 275.]    149.    The light which falls on a shaded body at the acutest angle receives  the highest light, and the darkest portion is that which receives it  at an obtuse angle and both the light and the shadow form pyramids.  The angle _c_ receives the highest grade of light because it is  directly in front of the window _a b_ and the whole horizon of the  sky _m x_. The angle _a_ differs but little from _c_ because the  angles which divide it are not so unequal as those below, and only  that portion of the horizon is intercepted which lies between _y_  and _x_. Although it gains as much on the other side its line is  nevertheless not very strong because one angle is smaller than its  fellow. The angles _e i_ will have less light because they do not  see much of the light _m s_ and the light _v x_ and their angles are  very unequal. Yhe angle _k_ and the angle _f_ are each placed  between very unequal angles and therefore have but little light,  because at _k_ it has only the light _p t_, and at _f_ only _t q_;  _o g_ is the lowest grade of light because this part has no light at  all from the sky; and thence come the lines which will reconstruct a  pyramid that is the counterpart of the pyramid _c_; and this pyramid  _l_ is in the first grade of shadow; for this too is placed between  equal angles directly opposite to each other on either side of a  straight line which passes through the centre of the body and goes  to the centre of the light. The several luminous images cast within  the frame of the window at the points _a_ and _b_ make a light which  surrounds the derived shadow cast by the solid body at the points 4  and 6. The shaded images increase from _o g_ and end at 7 and 8.    [Footnote: The diagram belonging to this chapter is No. 2 on Plate  III. In the original it is placed between lines 3 and 4, and in the  reproduction these are shown in part. The semi circle above is  marked _orizonte_ (horizon). The number 6 at the left hand side,  outside the facsimile, is in the place of a figure which has become  indistinct in the original.]    On the intensity of shadows as dependent on the distance from the  light (150-152).    150.    The smaller the light that falls upon an object the more shadow it  will display. And the light will illuminate a smaller portion of the  object in proportion as it is nearer to it; and conversely, a larger  extent of it in proportion as it is farther off.    A light which is smaller than the object on which it falls will  light up a smaller extent of it in proportion as it is nearer to it,  and the converse, as it is farther from it. But when the light is  larger than the object illuminated it will light a larger extent of  the object in proportion as it is nearer and the converse when they  are farther apart.    151.    That portion of an illuminated object which is nearest to the source  of light will be the most strongly illuminated.    152.    That portion of the primary shadow will be least dark which is  farthest from the edges.    The derived shadow will be darker than the primary shadow where it  is contiguous with it.    On the proportion of light and shade (153-157).    153.    That portion of an opaque body will be more in shade or more in  light, which is nearer to the dark body, by which it is shaded, or  to the light that illuminates it.    Objects seen in light and shade show in greater relief than those  which are wholly in light or in shadow.    154.    OF PERSPECTIVE.    The shaded and illuminated sides of opaque objects will display the  same proportion of light and darkness as their objects [Footnote 6:  The meaning of _obbietti_ (objects) is explained in no 153, lines  1-4.--Between the title-line and the next there is, in the  original, a small diagram representing a circle described round a  square.].    155.    OF PAINTING.    The outlines and form of any part of a body in light and shade are  indistinct in the shadows and in the high lights; but in the  portions between the light and the shadows they are highly  conspicuous.    156.    OF PAINTING.    Among objects in various degrees of shade, when the light proceeds  from a single source, there will be the same proportion in their  shadows as in the natural diminution of the light and the same must  be understood of the degrees of light.    157.    A single and distinct luminous body causes stronger relief in the  object than a diffused light; as may be seen by comparing one side  of a landscape illuminated by the sun, and one overshadowed by  clouds, and so illuminated only by the diffused light of the  atmosphere.    THIRD BOOK ON LIGHT AND SHADE.    Definition of derived shadow (158. 159).    158.    Derived shadow cannot exist without primary shadow. This is proved  by the first of this which says: Darkness is the total absence of  light, and shadow is an alleviation of darkness and of light, and it  is more or less dark or light in proportion as the darkness is  modified by the light.    159.    Shadow is diminution of light.    Darkness is absence of light.    Shadow is divided into two kinds, of which the first is called  primary shadow, the second is derived shadow. The primary shadow is  always the basis of the derived shadow.    The edges of the derived shadow are straight lines.    [Footnote: The theory of the _ombra_ dirivativa_--a technical  expression for which there is no precise English equivalent is  elaborately treated by Leonardo. But both text and diagrams (as Pl.  IV, 1-3 and Pl. V) must at once convince the student that the  distinction he makes between _ombra primitiva_ and _ombra  dirivativa_ is not merely justifiable but scientific. _Ombra  dirivativa_ is by no means a mere abstract idea. This is easily  proved by repeating the experiment made by Leonardo, and by filling  with smoke the room in which the existence of the _ombra dirivativa_  is investigated, when the shadow becomes visible. Nor is it  difficult to perceive how much of Leonardo's teaching depended on  this theory. The recognised, but extremely complicated science of  cast shadows--_percussione dell' ombre dirivative_ as Leonardo  calls them--is thus rendered more intelligible if not actually  simpler, and we must assume this theory as our chief guide through  the investigations which follow.]    The darkness of the derived shadow diminishes in proportion as it is  remote from the primary shadow.    Different sorts of derived shadows (160-162).    160.    SHADOW AND LIGHT.    The forms of shadows are three: inasmuch as if the solid body which  casts the shadow is equal (in size) to the light, the shadow  resembles a column without any termination (in length). If the body  is larger than the light the shadow resembles a truncated and  inverted pyramid, and its length has also no defined termination.  But if the body is smaller than the light, the shadow will resemble  a pyramid and come to an end, as is seen in eclipses of the moon.    161.    OF SIMPLE DERIVED SHADOWS.    The simple derived shadow is of two kinds: one kind which has its  length defined, and two kinds which are undefined; and the defined  shadow is pyramidal. Of the two undefined, one is a column and the  other spreads out; and all three have rectilinear outlines. But the  converging, that is the pyramidal, shadow proceeds from a body that  is smaller than the light, and the columnar from a body equal in  size to the light, and the"]]]
