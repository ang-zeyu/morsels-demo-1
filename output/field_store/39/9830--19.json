But  their bodies don't seem very big.\"    \"Where are they?\" enquired the girl.    \"They are in little pockets all around the edge of this cavern.  Oh,  Dorothy--you can't imagine what horrid things they are!  They're uglier  than the Gargoyles.\"    \"Tut-tut! be careful how you criticise your neighbors,\" spoke a rasping  voice near by.  \"As a matter of fact you are rather ugly-looking  creatures yourselves, and I'm sure mother has often told us we were the  loveliest and prettiest things in all the world.\"    Hearing these words our friends turned in the direction of the sound,  and the Wizard held his lanterns so that their light would flood one of  the little pockets in the rock.    \"Why, it's a dragon!\" he exclaimed.    \"No,\" answered the owner of the big yellow eyes which were blinking at  them so steadily; \"you are wrong about that.  We hope to grow to be  dragons some day, but just now we're only dragonettes.\"    \"What's that?\" asked Dorothy, gazing fearfully at the great scaley  head, the yawning mouth and the big eyes.    \"Young dragons, of course; but we are not allowed to call ourselves  real dragons until we get our full growth,\" was the reply.  \"The big  dragons are very proud, and don't think children amount to much; but  mother says that some day we will all be very powerful and important.\"    \"Where is your mother?\" asked the Wizard, anxiously looking around.    \"She has gone up to the top of the earth to hunt for our dinner.  If  she has good luck she will bring us an elephant, or a brace of  rhinoceri, or perhaps a few dozen people to stay our hunger.\"    \"Oh; are you hungry?\" enquired Dorothy, drawing back.    \"Very,\" said the dragonette, snapping its jaws.    \"And--and--do you eat people?\"    \"To be sure, when we can get them.  But they've been very scarce for a  few years and we usually have to be content with elephants or  buffaloes,\" answered the creature, in a regretful tone.    \"How old are you?\" enquired Zeb, who stared at the yellow eyes as if  fascinated.    \"Quite young, I grieve to say; and all of my brothers and sisters that  you see here are practically my own age.  If I remember rightly, we  were sixty-six years old the day before yesterday.\"    \"But that isn't young!\" cried Dorothy, in amazement.    \"No?\" drawled the dragonette; \"it seems to me very babyish.\"    \"How old is your mother?\" asked the girl.    \"Mother's about two thousand years old; but she carelessly lost track  of her age a few centuries ago and skipped several hundreds.  She's a  little fussy, you know, and afraid of growing old, being a widow and  still in her prime.\"    \"I should think she would be,\" agreed Dorothy.  Then, after a moment's  thought, she asked:  \"Are we friends or enemies?  I mean, will you be  good to us, or do you intend to eat us?\"    \"As for that, we dragonettes would love to eat you, my child; but  unfortunately mother has tied all our tails around the rocks at the  back of our individual caves, so that we can not crawl out to get you.  If you choose to come nearer we will make a mouthful of you in a wink;  but unless you do you will remain quite safe.\"    There was a regretful accent in the creature's voice, and at the words  all the other dragonettes sighed dismally.    Dorothy felt relieved.  Presently she asked:    \"Why did your mother tie your tails?\"    \"Oh, she is sometimes gone for several weeks on her hunting trips, and  if we were not tied we would crawl all over the mountain and fight with  each other and get into a lot of mischief.  Mother usually knows what  she is about, but she made a mistake this time; for you are sure to  escape us unless you come too near, and you probably won't do that.\"    \"No, indeed!\" said the little girl.  \"We don't wish to be eaten by such  awful beasts.\"    \"Permit me to say,\" returned the dragonette, \"that you are rather  impolite to call us names, knowing that we cannot resent your insults.  We consider ourselves very beautiful in appearance, for mother has told  us so, and she knows.  And we are of an excellent family and have a  pedigree that I challenge any humans to equal, as it extends back about  twenty thousand years, to the time of the famous Green Dragon of  Atlantis, who lived in a time when humans had not yet been created.  Can you match that pedigree, little girl?\"    \"Well,\" said Dorothy, \"I was born on a farm in Kansas, and I guess  that's being just as 'spectable and haughty as living in a cave with  your tail tied to a rock.  If it isn't I'll have to stand it, that's  all.\"    \"Tastes differ,\" murmured the dragonette, slowly drooping its scaley  eyelids over its yellow eyes, until they looked like half-moons.    Being reassured by the fact that the creatures could not crawl out of  their rock-pockets, the children and the Wizard now took time to  examine them more closely.  The heads of the dragonettes were as big as  barrels and covered with hard, greenish scales that glittered brightly  under the light of the lanterns.  Their front legs, which grew just  back of their heads, were also strong and big; but their bodies were  smaller around than their heads, and dwindled away in a long line until  their tails were slim as a shoe-string.  Dorothy thought, if it had  taken them sixty-six years to grow to this size, that it would be fully  a hundred years more before they could hope to call themselves dragons,  and that seemed like a good while to wait to grow up.    \"It occurs to me,\" said the Wizard, \"that we ought to get out of this  place before the mother dragon comes back.\"    \"Don't hurry,\" called one of the dragonettes; \"mother will be glad to  meet you, I'm sure.\"    \"You may be right,\" replied the Wizard, \"but we're a little particular  about associating with strangers.  Will you kindly tell us which way  your mother went to get on top the earth?\"    \"That is not a fair question to ask us,\" declared another dragonette.  \"For, if we told you truly, you might escape us altogether; and if we  told you an untruth we would be naughty and deserve to be punished.\"    \"Then,\" decided Dorothy, \"we must find our way out the best we can.\"    They circled all around the cavern, keeping a good distance away from  the blinking yellow eyes of the dragonettes, and presently discovered  that there were two paths leading from the wall opposite to the place  where they had entered.  They selected one of these at a venture and  hurried along it as fast as they could go, for they had no idea when  the mother dragon would be back and were very anxious not to make her  acquaintance.          14.  Ozma Uses the Magic Belt      For a considerable distance the way led straight upward in a gentle  incline, and the wanderers made such good progress that they grew  hopeful and eager, thinking they might see sunshine at any minute.  But  at length they came unexpectedly upon a huge rock that shut off the  passage and blocked them from proceeding a single step farther.    This rock was separate from the rest of the mountain and was in motion,  turning slowly around and around as if upon a pivot.  When first they  came to it there was a solid wall before them; but presently it  revolved until there was exposed a wide, smooth path across it to the  other side.  This appeared so unexpectedly that they were unprepared to  take advantage of it at first, and allowed the rocky wall to swing  around again before they had decided to pass over.  But they knew now  that there was a means of escape and so waited patiently until the path  appeared for the second time.    The children and the Wizard rushed across the moving rock and sprang  into the passage beyond, landing safely though a little out of breath.  Jim the cab-horse came last, and the rocky wall almost caught him; for  just as he leaped to the floor of the further passage the wall swung  across it and a loose stone that the buggy wheels knocked against fell  into the narrow crack where the rock turned, and became wedged there.    They heard a crunching, grinding sound, a loud snap, and the turn-table  came to a stop with its broadest surface shutting off the path from  which they had come.    \"Never mind,\" said Zeb, \"we don't want to get back, anyhow.\"    \"I'm not so sure of that,\" returned Dorothy.  \"The mother dragon may  come down and catch us here.\"    \"It is possible,\" agreed the Wizard, \"if this proves to be the path she  usually takes.  But I have been examining this tunnel, and I do not see  any signs of so large a beast having passed through it.\"    \"Then we're all right,\" said the girl, \"for if the dragon went the  other way she can't poss'bly get to us now.\"    \"Of course not, my dear.  But there is another thing to consider.  The  mother dragon probably knows the road to the earth's surface, and if  she went the other way then we have come the wrong way,\" said the  Wizard, thoughtfully.    \"Dear me!\" cried Dorothy.  \"That would be unlucky, wouldn't it?\"    \"Very.  Unless this passage also leads to the top of the earth,\" said  Zeb.  \"For my part, if we manage to get out of here I'll be glad it  isn't the way the dragon goes.\"    \"So will I,\" returned Dorothy.  \"It's enough to have your pedigree  flung in your face by those saucy dragonettes.  No one knows what the  mother might do.\"    They now moved on again, creeping slowly up another steep incline.  The  lanterns were beginning to grow dim, and the Wizard poured the  remaining oil from one into the other, so that the one light would last  longer.  But their journey was almost over, for in a short time they  reached a small cave from which there was no further outlet.    They did not realize their ill fortune at first, for their hearts were  gladdened by the sight of a ray of sunshine coming through a small  crack in the roof of the cave, far overhead.  That meant that their  world--the real world--was not very far away, and that the succession  of perilous adventures they had encountered had at last brought them  near the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4204"],[0,"The Elements of Geology (#16)"],[1," vast extent and immense  thickness, and such deposits of past geological ages have not  infrequently been preserved, with all their records of the times  in which they were built, by being carried below the level of the  sea, to be brought to light by a later uplift. On the other hand,  river deposits which remain above baselevels of erosion are swept  away comparatively soon.    THE GREAT VALLEY OF CALIFORNIA is a monotonously level plain of  great fertility, four hundred miles in length and fifty miles in  average width, built of waste swept down by streams from the  mountain ranges which inclose it,--the Sierra Nevada on the east  and the Coast Range on the west. On the waste slopes at the foot  of the bordering hills coarse gravels and even bowlders are left,  while over the interior the slow-flowing streams at times of  flood spread wide sheets of silt. Organic deposits are now forming  by the decay of vegetation in swampy tule (reed) lands and in  shallow lakes which occupy depressions left by the aggrading  streams.    Deep borings show that this great trough is filled to a depth of  at least two thousand feet below sea level with recent  unconsolidated sands and silts containing logs of wood and fresh-  water shells. These are land deposits, and the absence of any  marine deposits among them proves that the region has not been  invaded by the sea since the accumulation began. It has therefore  been slowly subsiding and its streams, although continually  carried below grade, have yet been able to aggrade the surface as  rapidly as the region sank, and have maintained it, as at present,  slightly above sea level.    THE INDO-GANGETIC PLAIN, spread by the Brahmaputra, the Ganges,  and the Indus river systems, stretches for sixteen hundred miles  along the southern base of the Himalaya Mountains and occupies an  area of three hundred thousand square miles (Fig.342). It consists  of the flood plains of the master streams and the confluent fans  of the tributaries which issue from the mountains on the north.  Large areas are subject to overflow each season of flood, and  still larger tracts mark abandoned flood plains below which the  rivers have now cut their beds. The plain is built of far-  stretching beds of clay, penetrated by streaks of sand, and also  of gravel near the mountains. Beds of impure peat occur in it, and  it contains fresh-water shells and the bones of land animals of  species now living in northern India. At Lucknow an artesian well  was sunk to one thousand feet below sea level without reaching the  bottom of these river-laid sands and silts, proving a slow  subsidence with which the aggrading rivers have kept pace.    WARPED VALLEYS. It is not necessary that an area should sink below  sea level in order to be filled with stream-swept waste. High  valleys among growing mountain ranges may suffer warping, or may  be blockaded by rising mountain folds athwart them. Where the  deformation is rapid enough, the river may be ponded and the  valley filled with lake-laid sediments. Even when the river is  able to maintain its right of way it may yet have its declivity so  lessened that it is compelled to aggrade its course continually,  filling the valley with river deposits which may grow to an  enormous thickness.    Behind the outer ranges of the Himalaya Mountains lie several  waste-filled valleys, the largest of which are Kashmir and Nepal,  the former being an alluvial plain about as large as the state of  Delaware. The rivers which drain these plains have already cut  down their outlet gorges sufficiently to begin the task of the  removal of the broad accumulations which they have brought in from  the surrounding mountains. Their present flood plains lie as much  as some hundreds of feet below wide alluvial terraces which mark  their former levels. Indeed, the horizontal beds of the Hundes  Valley have been trenched to the depth of nearly three thousand  feet by the Sutlej River. These deposits are recent or subrecent,  for there have been found at various levels the remains of land  plants and land and fresh-water shells, and in some the bones of  such animals as the hyena and the goat, of species or of genera  now living. Such soft deposits cannot be expected to endure  through any considerable length of future time the rapid erosion  to which their great height above the level of the sea will  subject them.    CHARACTERISTICS OF RIVER DEPOSITS. The examples just cited teach  clearly the characteristic features of extensive river deposits.  These deposits consist of broad, flat-lying sheets of clay and  fine sand left by the overflow at time of flood, and traversed  here and there by long, narrow strips of coarse, cross-bedded  sands and gravels thrown down by the swifter currents of the  shifting channels. Occasional beds of muck mark the sites of  shallow lakelets or fresh-water swamps. The various strata also  contain some remains of the countless myriads of animals and  plants which live upon the surface of the plain as it is in  process of building. River shells such as the mussel, land shells  such as those of snails, the bones of fishes and of such land  animals as suffer drowning at times of flood or are mired in  swampy places, logs of wood, and the stems and leaves of plants  are examples of the variety of the remains of land and fresh-water  organisms which are entombed in river deposits and sealed away as  a record of the life of the time, and as proof that the deposits  were laid by streams and not beneath the sea.    BASIN DEPOSITS    DEPOSITS IN DRY BASINS. On desert areas without outlet to the sea,  as on the Great Basin of the United States and the deserts of  central Asia, stream-swept waste accumulates indefinitely. The  rivers of the surrounding mountains, fed by the rains and melting  snows of these comparatively moist elevations, dry and soak away  as they come down upon the arid plains. They are compelled to lay  aside their entire load of waste eroded from the mountain valleys,  in fans which grow to enormous size, reaching in some instances  thousands of feet in thickness.    The monotonous levels of Turkestan include vast alluvial tracts  now in process of building by the floods of the frequently  shifting channels of the Oxus and other rivers of the region. For  about seven hundred miles from its mouth in Aral Lake the Oxus  receives no tributaries, since even the larger branches of its  system are lost in a network of distributaries and choked with  desert sands before they reach their master stream. These  aggrading rivers, which have channels but no valleys, spread their  muddy floods--which in the case of the Oxus sometimes equal the  average volume of the Mississippi--far and wide over the plain,  washing the bases of the desert dunes.    PLAYAS. In arid interior basins the central depressions may be  occupied by playas,--plains of fine mud washed forward from the  margins. In the wet season the playa is covered with a thin sheet  of muddy water, a playa lake, supplied usually by some stream at  flood. In the dry season the lake evaporates, the river which fed  it retreats, and there is left to view a hard, smooth, level floor  of sun-baked and sun-cracked yellow clay utterly devoid of  vegetation.    In the Black Rock desert of Nevada a playa lake spreads over an  area fifty miles long and twenty miles wide. In summer it  disappears; the Quinn River, which feeds it, shrinks back one  hundred miles toward its source, leaving an absolutely barren  floor of clay, level as the sea.    LAKE DEPOSITS. Regarding lakes as parts of river systems, we may  now notice the characteristic features of the deposits in lake  basins. Soundings in lakes of considerable size and depth show  that their bottoms are being covered with tine clays. Sand and  gravel are found along; their margins, being brought in by streams  and worn by waves from the shore, but there are no tidal or other  strong currents to sweep coarse waste out from shore to any  considerable distance. Where fine clays are now found on the land  in even, horizontal layers containing the remains of fresh-water  animals and plants, uncut by channels tilled with cross-bedded  gravels and sands and bordered by beach deposits of coarse waste,  we may safely infer the existence of ancient lakes.    MARL. Marl is a soft, whitish deposit of carbonate of lime,  mingled often with more or less of clay, accumulated in small  lakes whose feeding springs are charged with carbonate of lime and  into which little waste is washed from the land. Such lakelets are  not infrequent on the surface of the younger drift sheets of  Michigan and northern Indiana, where their beds of marl--sometimes  as much as forty feet thick--are utilized in the manufacture of  Portland cement. The deposit results from the decay of certain  aquatic plants which secrete lime carbonate from the water, from  the decomposition of the calcareous shells of tiny mollusks which  live in countless numbers on the lake floor, and in some cases  apparently from chemical precipitation.    PEAT. We have seen how lakelets are extinguished by the decaying  remains of the vegetation which they support. A section of such a  fossil lake shows that below the growing mosses and other plants  of the surface of the bog lies a spongy mass composed of dead  vegetable tissue, which passes downward gradually into PEAT,--a  dense, dark brown carbonaceous deposit in which, to the unaided  eye, little or no trace of vegetable structure remains. When  dried, peat forms a fuel of some value and is used either cut into  slabs and dried or pressed into bricks by machinery.    When vegetation decays in open air the carbon of its tissues,  taken from the atmosphere by the leaves, is oxidized and returned  to it in its original form of carbon dioxide. But decomposing in  the presence of water, as in a bog, where the oxygen of the air is  excluded, the carbonaceous matter of"]]]
