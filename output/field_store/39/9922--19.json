And  anything that makes you feel small is mighty good for you.    \"What do you mean by a great book?\" said the Professor--I mean,  I imagined him saying it. It seemed to me as if I could see him  sitting there, with his corncob pipe in his hand and that quizzical  little face of his looking sharply at me. Somehow, talking with  the Professor had made me think. He was as good as one of those  Scranton correspondence courses, I do believe, and no money to pay  for postage.    Well, I said to the Professor--to myself I mean--let's see: what  _is_ a good book? I don't mean books like Henry James's (he's  Andrew's great idol. It always seemed to me that he had a kind  of rush of words to the head and never stopped to sort them out  properly). A good book ought to have something simple about it. And,  like Eve, it ought to come from somewhere near the third rib: there  ought to be a heart beating in it. A story that's all forehead  doesn't amount to much. Anyway, it'll never get over at a Dorcas  meeting. That was the trouble with Henry James. Andrew talked so  much about him that I took one of his books to read aloud at our  sewing circle over at Redfield. Well, after one try we had to fall  back on \"Pollyanna.\"    I haven't been doing chores and running a farmhouse for fifteen  years without getting some ideas about life--and even about books.  I wouldn't set my lit'ry views up against yours, Professor (I was  still talking to Mifflin in my mind), no, nor even against  Andrew's--but as I say, I've got some ideas of my own. I've learned  that honest work counts in writing books just as much as it does in  washing dishes. I guess Andrew's books must be some good after all  because he surely does mull over them without end. I can forgive  his being a shiftless farmer so long as he really does his literary  chores up to the hilt. A man can be slack in everything else, if  he does one thing as well as he possibly can. And I guess it won't  matter my being an ignoramus in literature so long as I'm rated A-1  in the kitchen. That's what I used to think as I polished and  scoured and scrubbed and dusted and swept and then set about getting  dinner. If I ever sat down to read for ten minutes the cat would  get into the custard. No woman in the country sits down for fifteen  consecutive minutes between sunrise and sunset, anyway, unless  she has half a dozen servants. And nobody knows anything about  literature unless he spends most of his life sitting down. So  there you are.    The cultivation of philosophic reflection was a new experience for  me. Peg ambled along contentedly and the dog trailed under Parnassus  where I had tied him. I read \"Vanity Fair\" and thought about all  sorts of things. Once I got out to pick some scarlet maple leaves  that attracted me. The motors passing annoyed me with their dust  and noise, but by and by one of them stopped, looked at my outfit  curiously, and then asked to see some books. I put up the flaps for  them and we pulled off to one side of the road and had a good talk.  They bought two or three books, too.    By the time I neared Bath the hands of my watch pointed to supper.  I was still a bit shy of Mifflin's scheme of stopping overnight at  farmhouses, so I thought I'd go right into the town and look for a  hotel. The next day was Sunday, so it seemed reasonable to give the  horse a good rest and stay in Bath two nights. The Hominy House  looked clean and old-fashioned, and the name amused me, so in I  went. It was a kind of high-class boarding-house, with mostly old  women around. It looked to me almost literary and Elbert Hubbardish  compared to the Grand Central in Shelby. The folks there stared at  me somewhat suspiciously and I half thought they were going to say  they didn't take pedlars; but when I flashed a new five-dollar bill  at the desk I got good service. A five-dollar bill is a patent of  nobility in New England.    My! how I enjoyed that creamed chicken on toast, and buckwheat cakes  with syrup! After you get used to cooking all your own grub, a meal  off some one else's stove is the finest kind of treat. After supper  I was all prepared to sit out on the porch with my sweater on and  give a rocking chair a hot box, but then I remembered that it was up  to me to carry on the traditions of Parnassus. I was there to spread  the gospel of good books. I got to thinking how the Professor never  shirked carrying on his campaign, and I determined that I would be  worthy of the cause.    When I think back about the experience, it seems pretty crazy, but  at the time I was filled with a kind of evangelistic zeal. I thought  if I was going to try to sell books I might as well have some fun  out of it. Most of the old ladies were squatting about in the  parlour, knitting or reading or playing cards. In the smoking-room I  could see two dried-up men. Mrs. Hominy, the manager of the place,  was sitting at her desk behind a brass railing, going over accounts  with a quill pen. I thought that the house probably hadn't had a  shock since Walt Whitman wrote \"Leaves of Grass.\" In a kind of  do-or-die spirit I determined to give them a rouse.    In the dining-room I had noticed a huge dinner bell that stood  behind the door. I stepped in there, and got it. Standing in the  big hall I began ringing it as hard as I could shake my arm.    You might have thought it was a fire alarm. Mrs. Hominy dropped her  pen in horror. The colonial dames in the parlour came to life and  ran into the hall like cockroaches. In a minute I had gathered quite  a respectable audience. It was up to me to do the spellbinding.    \"Friends,\" I said (unconsciously imitating the Professor's tricks  of the trade, I guess), \"this bell which generally summons you to  the groaning board now calls you to a literary repast. With the  permission of the management, and with apologies for disturbing your  tranquillity, I will deliver a few remarks on the value of good  books. I see that several of you are fond of reading, so perhaps the  topic will be congenial?\"    They gazed at me about as warmly as a round of walnut sundaes.    \"Ladies and Gentlemen,\" I continued, \"of course you remember the  story of Abe Lincoln when he said, 'if you call a leg a tail, how  many tails has a dog?' 'Five,' you answer. Wrong; because, as Mr.  Lincoln said, calling a leg a tail....\"    I still think it was a good beginning. But that was as far as I got.  Mrs. Hominy came out of her trance, hastened from the cage, and  grabbed my arm. She was quite red with anger.    \"Really!\" she said. \"Well, really!... I must ask you to continue  this in some other place. We do not allow commercial travellers in  this house.\"    And within fifteen minutes they had hitched up Peg and asked me to  move on. Indeed I was so taken aback by my own zeal that I could  hardly protest. In a kind of daze I found myself at the Moose Hotel,  where they assured me that they catered to mercantile people. I went  straight to my room and fell asleep as soon as I reached the straw  mattress.    That was my first and only public speech.        CHAPTER TWELVE      The next day was Sunday, October sixth. I well remember the date.    I woke up as chipper as any Robert W. Chambers heroine. All my  doubts and depressions of the evening before had fled, and I was  single-heartedly delighted with the world and everything in it. The  hotel was a poor place, but it would have taken more than that to  mar my composure. I had a bitterly cold bath in a real country tin  tub, and then eggs and pancakes for breakfast. At the table was  a drummer who sold lightning rods, and several other travelling  salesmen. I'm afraid my conversation was consciously modelled along  the line of what the Professor would have said if he had been there,  but at any rate I got along swimmingly. The travelling men, after a  moment or two of embarrassed diffidence, treated me quite as one of  themselves and asked me about my \"line\" with interest. I described  what I was doing and they all said they envied me my freedom to come  and go independently of trains. We talked cheerfully for a long  time, and almost without intending to, I started preaching about  books. In the end they insisted on my showing them Parnassus. We  all went out to the stable, where the van was quartered, and they  browsed over the shelves. Before I knew it I had sold five dollars'  worth, although I had decided not to do any business at all on  Sunday. But I couldn't refuse to sell them the stuff as they all  seemed so keen on getting something really good to read. One man  kept on talking about Harold Bell Wright, but I had to admit that  I hadn't heard of him. Evidently the Professor hadn't stocked any  of his works. I was tickled to see that after all little Redbeard  didn't know _everything_ about literature.    After that I debated whether to go to church or to write letters.  Finally I decided in favour of the letters. First I tackled Andrew.  I wrote:      The Moose Hotel, Bath,  Sunday morning.    DEAR ANDREW:    It seems absurd to think that it's only three days since I left  Sabine Farm. Honestly, more has happened to me in these three days  than in three years at home.    I'm sorry that you and Mr. Mifflin disagreed but I quite understood  your feelings. But I'm very angry that you should have tried to  stop that check I gave him. It was none of your business, Andrew.  I telephoned Mr. Shirley and made him send word to the bank in  Woodbridge to give Mifflin the money. Mr. Mifflin did not swindle me  into buying Parnassus. I did it of my own free will. If you want to  know the truth, it was your fault! I bought it because I was scared  _you_ would if I didn't. And I didn't want to be left all alone on  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5321"],[0,"Concerning the Spiritual in Art (#16)"],[1,"be  spurned absolutely, even though at the same time they gratify  what nowadays we are pleased to call the \"lower bodily tastes.\"]  Therefore a picture is not necessarily \"well painted\" if it  possesses the \"values\" of which the French so constantly speak.  It is only well painted if its spiritual value is complete and  satisfying. \"Good drawing\" is drawing that cannot be altered  without destruction of this inner value, quite irrespective of  its correctness as anatomy, botany, or any other science. There  is no question of a violation of natural form, but only of the  need of the artist for such form. Similarly colours are used not  because they are true to nature, but because they are necessary  to the particular picture. In fact, the artist is not only  justified in using, but it is his duty to use only those forms  which fulfil his own need. Absolute freedom, whether from anatomy  or anything of the kind, must be given the artist in his choice  of material. Such spiritual freedom is as necessary in art as it  is in life. [Footnote: This freedom is man's weapon against the  Philistines. It is based on the inner need.]    Note, however, that blind following of scientific precept is less  blameworthy than its blind and purposeless rejection. The former  produces at least an imitation of material objects which may be  of some use.    [Footnote: Plainly, an imitation of nature, if made by the hand  of an artist, is not a pure reproduction. The voice of the soul  will in some degree at least make itself heard. As contrasts one  may quote a landscape of Canaletto and those sadly famous heads  by Denner.--(Alte Pinakothek, Munich.)]    The latter is an artistic betrayal and brings confusion in its  train. The former leaves the spiritual atmosphere empty; the  latter poisons it.    Painting is an art, and art is not vague production, transitory  and isolated, but a power which must be directed to the  improvement and refinement of the human soul--to, in fact, the  raising of the spiritual triangle.    If art refrains from doing this work, a chasm remains unbridged,  for no other power can take the place of art in this activity.  And at times when the human soul is gaining greater strength, art  will also grow in power, for the two are inextricably connected  and complementary one to the other. Conversely, at those times  when the soul tends to be choked by material disbelief, art  becomes purposeless and talk is heard that art exists for art's  sake alone.    [Footnote: This cry \"art for art's sake,\" is really the best  ideal such an age can attain to. It is an unconscious protest  against materialism, against the demand that everything should  have a use and practical value. It is further proof of the  indestructibility of art and of the human soul, which can never  be killed but only temporarily smothered.]    Then is the bond between art and the soul, as it were, drugged  into unconsciousness. The artist and the spectator drift apart,  till finally the latter turns his back on the former or regards  him as a juggler whose skill and dexterity are worthy of  applause. It is very important for the artist to gauge his  position aright, to realize that he has a duty to his art and to  himself, that he is not king of the castle but rather a servant  of a nobler purpose. He must search deeply into his own soul,  develop and tend it, so that his art has something to clothe, and  does not remain a glove without a hand.    THE ARTIST MUST HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY, FOR MASTERY OVER FORM IS  NOT HIS GOAL BUT RATHER THE ADAPTING OF FORM TO ITS INNER  MEANING.    [Footnote: Naturally this does not mean that the artist is to  instill forcibly into his work some deliberate meaning. As has  been said the generation of a work of art is a mystery. So long  as artistry exists there is no need of theory or logic to direct  the painter's action. The inner voice of the soul tells him what  form he needs, whether inside or outside nature. Every artist  knows, who works with feeling, how suddenly the right form  flashes upon him. Bocklin said that a true work of art must be  like an inspiration; that actual painting, composition, etc., are  not the steps by which the artist reaches self-expression.]    The artist is not born to a life of pleasure. He must not live  idle; he has a hard work to perform, and one which often proves a  cross to be borne. He must realize that his every deed, feeling,  and thought are raw but sure material from which his work is to  arise, that he is free in art but not in life.    The artist has a triple responsibility to the non-artists: (1) He  must repay the talent which he has; (2) his deeds, feelings, and  thoughts, as those of every man, create a spiritual atmosphere  which is either pure or poisonous. (3) These deeds and thoughts  are materials for his creations, which themselves exercise  influence on the spiritual atmosphere. The artist is not only a  king, as Peladan says, because he has great power, but also  because he has great duties.    If the artist be priest of beauty, nevertheless this beauty is to  be sought only according to the principle of the inner need, and  can be measured only according to the size and intensity of that  need.    THAT IS BEAUTIFUL WHICH IS PRODUCED BY THE INNER NEED, WHICH  SPRINGS FROM THE SOUL.    Maeterlinck, one of the first warriors, one of the first modern  artists of the soul, says: \"There is nothing on earth so curious  for beauty or so absorbent of it, as a soul. For that reason few  mortal souls withstand the leadership of a soul which gives to  them beauty.\" [Footnote: De la beaute interieure.]    And this property of the soul is the oil, which facilitates the  slow, scarcely visible but irresistible movement of the triangle,  onwards and upwards.        IX. CONCLUSION        The first five illustrations in this book show the course of  constructive effort in painting. This effort falls into two  divisions:    (1) Simple composition, which is regulated according to an  obvious and simple form. This kind of composition I call the  MELODIC.    (2) Complex composition, consisting of various forms, subjected  more or less completely to a principal form. Probably the  principal form may be hard to grasp outwardly, and for that  reason possessed of a strong inner value. This kind of  composition I call the SYMPHONIC.    Between the two lie various transitional forms, in which the  melodic principle predominates. The history of the development is  closely parallel to that of music.    If, in considering an example of melodic composition, one forgets  the material aspect and probes down into the artistic reason of  the whole, one finds primitive geometrical forms or an  arrangement of simple lines which help toward a common motion.  This common motion is echoed by various sections and may be  varied by a single line or form. Such isolated variations serve  different purposes. For instance, they may act as a sudden check,  or to use a musical term, a \"fermata.\" [Footnote: E.g., the  Ravenna mosaic which, in the main, forms a triangle. The upright  figures lean proportionately to the triangle. The outstretched  arm and door-curtain are the \"fermate.\"] Each form which goes to  make up the composition has a simple inner value, which has in  its turn a melody. For this reason I call the composition  melodic. By the agency of Cezanne and later of Hodler [Footnote:  English readers may roughly parallel Hodler with Augustus John  for purposes of the argument.--M.T.H.S.] this kind of composition  won new life, and earned the name of \"rhythmic.\" The limitations  of the term \"rhythmic\" are obvious. In music and nature each  manifestation has a rhythm of its own, so also in painting. In  nature this rhythm is often not clear to us, because its purpose  is not clear to us. We then speak of it as unrhythmic. So the  terms rhythmic and unrhythmic are purely conventional, as also  are harmony and discord, which have no actual existence.  [Footnote: As an example of plain melodic construction with a  plain rhythm, Cezanne's \"Bathing Women\" is given in this book.]    Complex rhythmic composition, with a strong flavour of the  symphonic, is seen in numerous pictures and woodcuts of the past.  One might mention the work of old German masters, of the  Persians, of the Japanese, the Russian icons, broadsides, etc.  [Footnote: This applies to many of Hodler's pictures.]    In nearly all these works the symphonic composition is not very  closely allied to the melodic. This means that fundamentally  there is a composition founded on rest and balance. The mind  thinks at once of choral compositions, of Mozart and Beethoven.  All these works have the solemn and regular architecture of a  Gothic cathedral; they belong to the transition period.    As examples of the new symphonic composition, in which the  melodic element plays a subordinate part, and that only rarely, I  have added reproductions of four of my own pictures.    They represent three different sources of inspiration:    (1) A direct impression of outward nature, expressed in purely  artistic form. This I call an \"Impression.\"    (2) A largely unconscious, spontaneous expression of inner  character, the non-material nature. This I call an  \"Improvisation.\"    (3) An expression of a slowly formed inner feeling, which  comes to utterance only after long maturing. This I call a  \"Composition.\" In this, reason, consciousness, purpose, play  an overwhelming part. But of the calculation nothing appears,  only the feeling. Which kind of construction, whether  conscious or unconscious, really underlies my work, the  patient reader will readily understand.    Finally, I would remark that, in my opinion, we are fast  approaching the time of reasoned and conscious composition, when  the painter will be proud to declare his work constructive. This  will be in contrast to the claim of the Impressionists that they  could explain nothing,"]]]
