Another mouse quickly followed;  then another and another, in rapid succession. And suddenly such a        178  scream of terror went up from the Army that it might easily have filled the  stoutest heart with consternation. The flight that ensued turned to a  stampede, and the stampede to a panic.    For while the startled mice rushed wildly about the room the Scarecrow had  only time to note a whirl of skirts and a twinkling of feet as the girls  disappeared from the palace--pushing and crowding one another in their mad  efforts to escape.    The Queen, at the first alarm, stood up on the cushions of the throne and  began to dance frantically upon her tiptoes. Then a mouse ran up the  cushions, and with a terrified leap poor Jinjur shot clear over the head of  the Scarecrow and escaped through an archway--never pausing in her wild  career until she had reached the city gates.    So, in less time than I can explain, the throne room was deserted by all  save the Scarecrow and his friends, and the Woggle-Bug heaved a deep sigh of  relief as he exclaimed:    \"Thank goodness, we are saved!\"    \"For a time, yes;\" answered the Tin Woodman. \"But the enemy will soon  return, I fear.\"    \"Let us bar all the entrances to the palace!\" said the Scarecrow. \"Then we  shall have time to think what is best to be done.\"        179    So all except Jack Pumpkinhead, who was still tied fast to the Saw-Horse,  ran to the various entrances of the royal palace and closed the heavy doors,  bolting and locking them securely. Then, knowing that the Army of Revolt  could not batter down the barriers in several days, the adventurers gathered  once more in the throne room for a council of war.

And if she is right, then I am wrong, and we have no business to be  occupying her palace.\"    \"But you were the King until she came,\" said the Woggle-Bug, strutting up  and down with his hands in his pockets; \"so it appears to me that she is the  interloper instead of you.\"    \"Especially as we have just conquered her and put her to flight,\" added the  Pumpkinhead, as he raised his hands to turn his face toward the Scarecrow.    \"Have we really conquered her?\" asked the Scarecrow, quietly. \"Look out of  the window, and tell me what you see.\"        182    Tip ran to the window and looked out.    \"The palace is surrounded by a double row of girl soldiers,\" he announced.    \"I thought so,\" returned the Scarecrow. \"We are as truly their prisoners as  we were before the mice frightened them from the palace.\"    \"My friend is right,\" said Nick Chopper, who had been polishing his breast  with a bit of chamois-leather. \"Jinjur is still the Queen, and we are her  prisoners.\"    \"But I hope she cannot get at us,\" exclaimed the Pumpkinhead, with a shiver  of fear. \"She threatened to make tarts of me, you know.\"    \"Don't worry,\" said the Tin Woodman. \"It cannot matter greatly. If you stay  shut up here you will spoil in time, anyway. A good tart is far more  admirable than a decayed intellect.\"    \"Very true,\" agreed the Scarecrow.    \"Oh, dear!\" moaned Jack; \"what an unhappy lot is mine! Why, dear father, did  you not make me out of tin--or even out of straw--so that I would keep  indefinitely.\"    \"Shucks!\" returned Tip, indignantly. \"You ought to be glad that I made you  at all.\" Then he added, reflectively, \"everything has to come to an end,  some time.\"        183    \"But I beg to remind you,\" broke in the Woggle-Bug, who had a distressed  look in his bulging, round eyes, \"that this terrible Queen Jinjur suggested  making a goulash of me--Me! the only Highly Magnified and Thoroughly  Educated Woggle-Bug in the wide, wide world!\"    \"I think it was a brilliant idea,\" remarked the Scarecrow, approvingly.    \"Don't you imagine he would make a better soup?\" asked the Tin Woodman,  turning toward his friend.    \"Well, perhaps,\" acknowledged the Scarecrow.    The Woggle-Bug groaned.    \"I can see, in my mind's eye,\" said he, mournfully, \"the goats eating small  pieces of my dear comrade, the Tin Woodman, while my soup is being cooked on  a bonfire built of the Saw-Horse and Jack Pumpkinhead's body, and Queen  Jinjur watches me boil while she feeds the flames with my friend the  Scarecrow!\"    This morbid picture cast a gloom over the entire party, making them restless  and anxious.    \"It can't happen for some time,\" said the Tin Woodman, trying to speak  cheerfully; \"for we shall be able to keep Jinjur out of the palace until she  manages to break down the doors.\"        184    \"And in the meantime I am liable to starve to death, and so is the Woggle-  Bug,\" announced Tip.    \"As for me,\" said the Woggle-Bug, \"I think that I could live for some time  on Jack Pumpkinhead. Not that I prefer pumpkins for food; but I believe they  are somewhat nutritious, and Jack's head is large and plump.\"    \"How heartless!\" exclaimed the Tin Woodman, greatly shocked. \"Are we  cannibals, let me ask? Or are we faithful friends?\"    \"I see very clearly that we cannot stay shut up in this palace,\" said the  Scarecrow, with decision. \"So let us end this mournful talk and try to  discover a means to escape.\"    At this suggestion they all gathered eagerly around the throne, wherein was  seated the Scarecrow, and as Tip sat down upon a stool there fell from his  pocket a pepper-box, which rolled upon the floor.    \"What is this?\" asked Nick Chopper, picking up the box.    \"Be careful!\" cried the boy. \"That's my Powder of Life. Don't spill it, for  it is nearly gone.\"    \"And what is the Powder of Life?\" enquired the Scarecrow, as Tip replaced  the box carefully in his pocket.    \"It's some magical stuff old Mombi got from a        185  crooked sorcerer,\" explained the boy. \"She brought Jack to life with it, and  afterward I used it to bring the Saw-Horse to life. I guess it will make  anything live that is sprinkled with it; but there's only about one dose  left.\"    \"Then it is very precious,\" said the Tin Woodman.    \"Indeed it is,\" agreed the Scarecrow. \"It may prove our best means of escape  from our difficulties. I believe I will think for a few minutes; so I will  thank you, friend Tip, to get out your knife and rip this heavy crown from  my forehead.\"    Tip soon cut the stitches that had fastened the crown to the Scarecrow's  head, and the former monarch of the Emerald City removed it with a sigh of  relief and hung it on a peg beside the throne.    \"That is my last memento of royalty\" said he; \"and I'm glad to get rid of  it. The former King of this City,                   Line-Art Drawing        186  who was named Pastoria, lost the crown to the Wonderful Wizard, who passed  it on to me. Now the girl Jinjur claims it, and I sincerely hope it will not  give her a headache.\"    \"A kindly thought, which I greatly admire,\" said the Tin Woodman, nodding  approvingly.    \"And now I will indulge in a quiet think,\" continued the Scarecrow, lying  back in the throne.    The others remained as silent and still as possible, so as not to disturb  him; for all had great confidence in the extraordinary brains of the  Scarecrow.    And, after what seemed a very long time indeed to the anxious watchers, the  thinker sat up, looked upon his friends with his most whimsical expression,  and said:    \"My brains work beautifully today. I'm quite proud of them. Now, listen! If  we attempt to escape through the doors of the palace we shall surely be  captured. And, as we can't escape through the ground, there is only one  other thing to be done. We must escape through the air!\"    He paused to note the effect of these words; but all his hearers seemed  puzzled and unconvinced.    \"The Wonderful Wizard escaped in a balloon,\" he continued. \"We don't know  how to make a balloon, of course; but any sort of thing that can        187  fly through the air can carry us easily. So I suggest that my friend the Tin  Woodman, who is a skillful mechanic, shall build some sort of a machine,  with good strong wings, to carry us; and our friend Tip can then bring the  Thing to life with his magical powder.\"    \"Bravo!\" cried Nick Chopper.    \"What splendid brains!\" murmured Jack.    \"Really quite clever!\" said the Educated Woggle-Bug.    \"I believe it can be done,\" declared Tip; \"that is, if the Tin Woodman is  equal to making the Thing.\"    \"I'll do my best,\" said Nick, cheerily; \"and, as a matter of fact, I do not  often fail in what I attempt. But the Thing will have to be built on the  roof of the palace, so it can rise comfortably into the air.\"                   Line-Art Drawing        188    \"To be sure,\" said the Scarecrow.    \"Then let us search through the palace,\" continued the Tin Woodman, \"and  carry all the material we can find to the roof, where I will begin my work.\"    \"First, however,\" said the Pumpkinhead, \"I beg you will release me from this  horse, and make me another leg to walk with. For in my present condition I  am of no use to myself or to anyone else.\"    So the Tin Woodman knocked a mahogany center-table to pieces with his axe  and fitted one of the legs, which was beautifully carved, on to the body of  Jack Pumpkinhead, who was very proud of the acquisition.    \"It seems strange,\" said he, as he watched the Tin Woodman work, \"that my  left leg should be the most elegant and substantial part of me.\"    \"That proves you are unusual,\" returned the Scarecrow. \"and I am convinced  that the only people worthy of consideration in this world are the unusual  ones. For the common folks are like the leaves of a tree, and live and die  unnoticed.\"    \"Spoken like a philosopher!\" cried the Woggle-Bug, as he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5402"],[0,"1811 Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue (#16)"],[1," by which an old practitioner is    enabled to cog one of them with his fore-finger.

But the true original meaning of the word, owes its birth    to one Joe Dun, a famous bailiff of the town of Lincoln, so    extremely active, and so dexterous in his business, that it    became a proverb, when a man refused to pay, Why do not    you DUN him? that is, Why do not you set Dun to attest    him? Hence it became a cant word, and is now as old as    since the days of Henry VII. Dun was also the general    name for the hangman, before that of Jack Ketch.          And presently a halter got,        Made of the best strong hempen teer,        And ere a cat could lick her ear,        Had tied it up with as much art,        As DUN himself could do for's heart.
