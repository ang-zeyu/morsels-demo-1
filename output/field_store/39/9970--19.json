Moss  several feet in thickness, the growth of centuries, had gathered upon it,  and, when he stood upon the pinnacle, it yielded and trembled like gelatine  under his feet. He found himself in a critical situation. From this giddy  and unstable height he had neither the skill or courage to return. After  much anxiety, he was at length rescued by some of his more nimble sailors,  who managed to put a hawser over the summit, by means of which he safely  descended. They named it _Cap de Poutrincourt_.    They proceeded as far as the head of the Basin of Mines, but their search  for mineral wealth was fruitless, beyond a few meagre specimens of copper.  Their labors were chiefly rewarded by the discovery of a moss-covered cross  in the last stages of decay, the relic of fishermen, or other Christian  mariners, who had, years before, been upon the coast.    The exploring parties having returned to Port Royal, to their settlement in  what is now known as Annapolis Basin, the bulk of the colonists departed in  three barques for Canseau, on the 30th of July, while De Poutrincourt and  Champlain, with a complement of sailors, remained some days longer, that  they might take with them specimens of wheat still in the field and not yet  entirely ripe.    On the 11th of August they likewise bade adieu to Port Royal amid the tears  of the assembled savages, with whom they had lived in friendship, and who  were disappointed and grieved at their departure. In passing round the  peninsula of Nova Scotia in their little shallop, it was necessary to keep  close in upon the shore, which enabled Champlain, who had not before been  upon the coast east of La Heve, to make a careful survey from that point to  Canseau, the results of which are fully stated in his notes, and delineated  on his map of 1613.    On the 3d of September, the \"Jonas,\" bearing away the little French colony,  sailed out of the harbor of Canseau, and, directing its course towards the  shores of France, arrived at Saint Malo on the 1st of October, 1607.    Champlain's explorations on what may be strictly called the Atlantic coast  of North America were now completed. He had landed at La Heve in Nova  Scotia on the 8th of May, 1604, and had consequently been in the country  three years and nearly four months. During this period he had carefully  examined the whole shore from Canseau, the eastern limit of Nova Scotia, to  the Vineyard Sound on the southern boundaries of Massachusetts. This was  the most ample, accurate, and careful survey of this region which was made  during the whole period from the discovery of the continent in 1497 down to  the establishment of the English colony at Plymouth in 1620. A numerous  train of navigators had passed along the coast of New England: Sebastian  Cabot, Estevan Gomez, Jean Alfonse, Andre Thevet, John Hawkins, Bartholomew  Gosnold, Martin Pring, George Weymouth, Henry Hudson, John Smith, and the  rest, but the knowledge of the coast which we obtain from them is  exceedingly meagre and unsatisfactory, especially as compared with that  contained in the full, specific, and detailed descriptions, maps, and  drawings left us by this distinguished pioneer in the study and  illustration of the geography of the New England coast. [57]    The winter of 1607-8 Champlain passed in France, where he was pleasantly  occupied in social recreations which were especially agreeable to him after  an absence of more than three years, and in recounting to eager listeners  his experiences in the New World. He took an early opportunity to lay  before Monsieur de Monts the results of the explorations which he had made  in La Cadie since the departure of the latter from Annapolis Basin in the  autumn of 1605, illustrating his narrative by maps and drawings which he  had prepared of the bays and harbors on the coast of Nova Scotia, New  Brunswick, and New England.    While most men would have been disheartened by the opposition which he  encountered, the mind of De Monts was, nevertheless, rekindled by the  recitals of Champlain with fresh zeal in the enterprise which he had  undertaken. The vision of building up a vast territorial establishment,  contemplated by his charter of 1604, with his own personal aggrandizement  and that of his family, had undoubtedly vanished. But he clung,  nevertheless, with extraordinary tenacity to his original purpose of  planting a colony in the New World. This he resolved to do in the face of  many obstacles, and notwithstanding the withdrawment of the royal  protection and bounty. The generous heart of Henry IV. was by no means  insensible to the merits of his faithful subject, and, on his solicitation,  he granted to him letters-patent for the exclusive right of trade in  America, but for the space only of a single year. With this small boon from  the royal hand, De Monts hastened to fit out two vessels for the  expedition. One was to be commanded by Pont Grave, who was to devote his  undivided attention to trade with the Indians for furs and peltry; the  other was to convey men and material for a colonial plantation.    Champlain, whose energy, zeal, and prudence had impressed themselves upon  the mind of De Monts, was appointed lieutenant of the expedition, and  intrusted with the civil administration, having a sufficient number of men  for all needed defence against savage intruders, Basque fisher men, or  interloping fur-traders.    On the 13th of April, 1608, Champlain left the port of Honfleur, and  arrived at the harbor of Tadoussac on the 3d of June. Here he found Pont  Grave, who had preceded him by a few days in the voyage, in trouble with a  Basque fur-trader. The latter had persisted in carrying on his traffic,  notwithstanding the royal commission to the contrary, and had succeeded in  disabling Pont Grave, who had but little power of resistance, killing one  of his men, seriously wounding Pont Grave himself, as well as several  others, and had forcibly taken possession of his whole armament.    When Champlain had made full inquiries into all the circumstances, he saw  clearly that the difficulty must be compromised; that the exercise of force  in overcoming the intruding Basque would effectually break up his plans for  the year, and bring utter and final ruin upon his undertaking. He wisely  decided to pocket the insult, and let justice slumber for the present. He  consequently required the Basque, who began to see more clearly the  illegality of his course, to enter into a written agreement with Pont Grave  that neither should interfere with the other while they remained in the  country, and that they should leave their differences to be settled in the  courts on their return to France.    Having thus poured oil upon the troubled waters, Champlain proceeded to  carry out his plans for the location and establishment of his colony. The  difficult navigation of the St. Lawrence above Tadoussac was well known to  him. The dangers of its numberless rocks, sand-bars, and fluctuating  channels had been made familiar to him by the voyage of 1603. He  determined, therefore, to leave his vessel in the harbor of Tadoussac, and  construct a small barque of twelve or fourteen tons, in which to ascend the  river and fix upon a place of settlement.    While the work was in progress, Champlain reconnoitred the neighborhood,  collecting much geographical information from the Indians relating to Lake  St. John and a traditionary salt sea far to the north, exploring the  Saguenay for some distance, of which he has given us a description so  accurate and so carefully drawn that it needs little revision after the  lapse of two hundred and seventy years.    On the last of June, the barque was completed, and Champlain, with a  complement of men and material, took his departure. As he glided along in  his little craft, he was exhilarated by the fragrance of the atmosphere,  the bright coloring of the foliage, the bold, picturesque scenery that  constantly revealed itself on both sides of the river. The lofty mountains,  the expanding valleys, the luxuriant forests, the bold headlands, the  enchanting little bays and inlets, and the numerous tributaries bursting  into the broad waters of the St. Lawrence, were all carefully examined and  noted in his journal. The expedition seemed more like a holiday excursion  than the grave prelude to the founding of a city to be renowned in the  history of the continent.    On the fourth day, they approached the site of the present city of Quebec.  The expanse of the river had hitherto been from eight to thirteen miles.  Here a lofty headland, approaching from the interior, advances upon the  river and forces it into a narrow channel of three-fourths of a mile in  width. The river St. Charles, a small stream flowing from the northwest,  uniting here with the St. Lawrence, forms a basin below the promontory,  spreading out two miles in one direction and four in another. The rocky  headland, jutting out upon the river, rises up nearly perpendicularly, and  to a height of three hundred and forty-five feet, commanding from its  summit a view of water, forest and mountain of surpassing grandeur and  beauty. A narrow belt of fertile land formed by the crumbling _debris_ of  ages, stretches along between the water's edge and the base of the  precipice, and was then covered with a luxurious growth of nut-trees. The  magnificent basin below, the protecting wall of the headland in the rear,  the deep water of the river in front, rendered this spot peculiarly  attractive. Here on this narrow plateau, Champlain resolved to place his  settlement, and forthwith began the work of felling trees, excavating  cellars, and constructing houses.    On the 3d day of July, 1608, Champlain laid the foundation of Quebec. The  name which he gave to it had been applied to it by the savages long before.  It is derived from the Algonquin"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6659"],[0,"History of King Charles the Second of England (#16)"],[1," no further. His troops and his officers were wearied,  faint, and discouraged. His hopes had not been realized, and while it  was obviously dangerous to stop, it seemed still more dangerous to go  on. However, as the authorities of Worcester were disposed to take  sides with the king, Charles determined to stop there for a little  time, at all events, to refresh his army, and consider what to do.    He was received in the city with all due honors. He was proclaimed  king on the following day, with great parade and loud acclamations.  He established a camp in the neighborhood of the city. He issued great  proclamations, calling upon all the people of the surrounding country  to come and espouse his cause. He established his court, organized his  privy council, and, in a word, perfected, on a somewhat humble scale  it is true, all the arrangements proper to the condition of a monarch  in his capital. He began, perhaps, in fact, to imagine himself really  a king. If he did so, however, the illusion was soon dispelled. In one  short week Cromwell's army came on, filling all the avenues of approach  to the city, and exhibiting a force far too great, apparently, either  for Charles to meet in battle, or to defend himself from in a siege.    Charles's forces fought several preliminary battles and skirmishes in  resisting the attempts of Cromwell's columns to get possession of the  bridges and fords by which they were to cross the river. These contests  resulted always in the same way. The detachments which Charles had  sent forward to defend these points were one after another driven in,  while Charles, with his council of war around him, watched from the  top of the tower of a church within the city this gradual and  irresistible advance of his determined enemy, with an anxiety which  gradually deepened into dismay.    The king, finding his situation now desperate, determined to make one  final attempt to retrieve his fallen fortunes. He formed his troops  in array, and marched out to give the advancing army battle. He put  himself at the head of a troop of Highlanders, and fought in person  with the courage and recklessness of despair. The officers knew full  well that it was a question of victory or death; for if they did not  conquer, they must die, either by wounds on the field of battle, or  else, if taken prisoners, by being hung as traitors, or beheaded in  the Tower. All possibility of escape, entrapped and surrounded as they  were in the very heart of the country, hundreds of miles from the  frontiers, seemed utterly hopeless. They fought, therefore, with  reckless and desperate fury, but all was in vain. They were repulsed  and driven in on all sides, and the soldiers fled at length, carrying  the officers with them, in tumult and disorder, back through the gates  into the city.    An army flying in confusion to seek refuge in a city can not shut the  gates behind them against their pursuers. In fact, in such a scene of  terror and dismay, there is no order, no obedience, no composure. At  the gate where Charles endeavored to get back into the city, he found  the way choked up by a heavy ammunition cart which had been entangled  there, one of the oxen that had been drawing it being killed. The  throngs of men &and horsemen were stopped by this disaster. The king  dismounted, abandoned his horse, and made his way through and over the  obstruction as he could. When he got into the city, he found all in  confusion there. His men were throwing away their arms, and pressing  onward in their flight. He lightened his own burdens by laying aside  the heaviest of his armor, procured another horse, and rode up and  down among his men, urging and entreating them to form again and face  the enemy. He plead the justice of his cause, their duty to be faithful  to their rightful sovereign, and every other argument which was capable  of being expressed in the shouts and vociferations which, in such a  scene, constitute the only kind of communication possible with panic  stricken men; and when he found that all was in vain he said, in  despair, that he would rather they would shoot him on the spot than  let him live to witness such an abandonment of his cause by the only  friends and followers that had been left to him.    The powerful influence which these expostulations would otherwise have  had, was lost and overborne in the torrent of confusion and terror  which was spreading through all the streets of the city. The army of  Cromwell forced their passage in, and fought their way from street to  street, wherever they found any remaining resistance. Some of the  king's troops were hemmed up in corners, and cut to pieces. Others,  somewhat more fortunate, sought protection in towers and bastions,  where they could make some sort of conditions with their victorious  enemy before surrendering. Charles himself, finding that all was lost,  made his escape at last from the city, at six o'clock in the evening,  at the head of a troop of horse. He could not, however, endure the  thought of giving up the contest, after all. Again and again, as he  slowly retreated, he stopped to face about, and to urge his men to  consent to turn back again and encounter the enemy. Their last halt  was upon a bridge half a mile from the city. Here the king held a  consultation with the few remaining counselors and officers that were  with him, surveying, with them, the routed and flying bodies of men,  who were now throwing away their arms and dispersing in all directions,  in a state of hopeless disorganization and despair. The king saw plainly  that his cause was irretrievably ruined, and they all agreed that  nothing now remained for them but to make their escape back to Scotland,  if by any possibility that could now be done.    But how should they accomplish this end? To follow the multitude of  defeated soldiers would be to share the certain capture and death which  awaited them, and they were themselves all strangers to the country.  To go on inquiring all the way would only expose them to equally certain  discovery and capture. The first thing, however, obviously was to get  away from the crowd. Charles and his attendants, therefore, turned  aside from the high road--there were with the king fifty or sixty  officers and noblemen, all mounted men--and moved along in such secluded  by-paths as they could find. The king wished to diminish even this  number of followers, but he could not get any of them to leave him.  He complained afterward, in the account which he gave of these  adventures, that, though they would not fight for him when battle was  to be given, he could not get rid of them when the time came for flight.    There was a servant of one of the gentlemen in the company who pretended  to know the way, and he accordingly undertook to guide the party; but  as soon as it became dark he got confused and lost, and did not know  what to do. They contrived, however, to get another guide They went  ten miles, attracting no particular attention, for at such a time of  civil war a country is full of parties of men, armed and unarmed, going  to and fro, who are allowed generally to move without molestation, as  the inhabitants are only anxious to have as little as possible to say  to them, that they may the sooner be gone. The royal party assumed the  air and manner of one of these bands as long as daylight lasted, and  when that was gone they went more securely and at their ease. After  proceeding ten miles, they stopped at an obscure inn, where they took  some drink and a little bread, and then resumed their journey,  consulting with one another as they went as to what it was best to do.    About ten or twelve miles further on there was a somewhat wild and  sequestered region, in which there were two very secluded dwellings,  about half a mile from each other. One of these residences was named  Boscobel. The name had been given to it by a guest of the proprietor,  at an entertainment which the latter had given, from the Italian words  _bosco bello_, which mean beautiful grove. It was in or near a wood,  and away from all high roads, having been built, probably, like many  other of the dwellings reared in those days, as a place of retreat.  In the preceding reigns of Charles and Elizabeth, the Catholics, who  were called _popish recusants_, on account of their _refusing_ to take  an oath acknowledging the supremacy of the British sovereign over the  English Church, had to resort to all possible modes of escape from  Protestant persecution. They built these retreats in retired and  secluded places, and constructed all sorts of concealed and secure  hiding places within them, in the partitions and walls, where men whose  lives were in danger might be concealed for many days. Boscobel was  such a mansion. In fact, one of the king's generals, the Earl of Derby,  had been concealed in it but a short time before. The king inquired  particularly about it, and was induced himself to seek refuge there.    This house belonged to a family of Giffards, one of whom was in the  suite of King Charles at this time. There was another mansion about  half a mile distant. This other place had been originally, in the  Catholic days, a convent, and the nuns who inhabited it dressed in  white. They were called, accordingly, the _white ladies_, and the place  itself received the same name, which it retained after the sisters  were gone. Mr. Giffard recommended going to the White Ladies' first.  He wanted, in fact, to contrive some way to relieve the king of the  encumbrance of so large a troop before going to Boscobel.    They went, accordingly, to the White Ladies'. Neither of the houses  was occupied at this time by the proprietors, but were in charge of  housekeepers and servants. Among the tenants upon the estate there  were several brothers of the name of Penderel. They were woodmen and  farm servants, living at different places in the neighborhood, and"]]]
