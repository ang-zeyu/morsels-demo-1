These include  limitations on filtering companies' ability to: (1) harvest Web  pages for review; (2) review and categorize the Web pages that  they have harvested; and (3) engage in regular re-review of the  Web pages that they have previously reviewed.  The primary  limitations on filtering companies' ability to harvest Web pages  for review is that a substantial majority of pages on the Web are  not indexable using the spidering technology that Web search  engines use, and that together, search engines have indexed only  around half of the Web pages that are theoretically indexable.  The fast rate of growth in the number of Web pages also limits  filtering companies' ability to harvest pages for review.  These  shortcomings necessarily result in significant underblocking.  Several limitations on filtering companies' ability to  review and categorize the Web pages that they have harvested also  contribute to over- and underblocking.  First, automated review  processes, even those based on \"artificial intelligence,\" are  unable with any consistency to distinguish accurately material  that falls within a category definition from material that does  not.  Moreover, human review of URLs is hampered by filtering  companies' limited staff sizes, and by human error or  misjudgment.  In order to deal with the vast size of the Web and  its rapid rates of growth and change, filtering companies engage  in several practices that are necessary to reduce underblocking,  but inevitably  result in overblocking.  These include: (1)  blocking whole Web sites even when only a small minority of their  pages contain material that would fit under one of the filtering  company's categories (e.g., blocking the Salon.com site because  it contains a sex column); (2) blocking by IP address (because a  single IP address may contain many different Web sites and many  thousands of pages of heterogenous content); and (3) blocking  loophole sites such as translator sites and cache sites, which  archive Web pages that have been removed from the Web by their  original publisher.      Finally, filtering companies' failure to engage in regular  re-review of Web pages that they have already categorized (or  that they have determined do not fall into any category) results  in a substantial amount of over- and underblocking.  For example,  Web publishers change the contents of Web pages frequently.  The  problem also arises when a Web site goes out of existence and its  domain name or IP address is reassigned to a new Web site  publisher.  In that case, a filtering company's previous  categorization of the IP address or domain name would likely be  incorrect, potentially resulting in the over- or underblocking of  many thousands of pages.  The inaccuracies that result from these limitations of  filtering technology are quite substantial.  At least tens of  thousands of pages of the indexable Web are overblocked by each  of the filtering programs evaluated by experts in this case, even  when considered against the filtering companies' own category  definitions.  Many erroneously blocked pages contain content that  is completely innocuous for both adults and minors, and that no  rational person could conclude matches the filtering companies'  category definitions, such as \"pornography\" or \"sex.\"      The number of overblocked sites is of course much higher  with respect to the definitions of obscenity and child  pornography that CIPA employs for adults, since the filtering  products' category definitions, such as \"sex\" and \"nudity,\"  encompass vast amounts of Web pages that are neither child  pornography nor obscene.  Thus, the number of pages of  constitutionally protected speech blocked by filtering products  far exceeds the many thousands of pages that are overblocked by  reference to the filtering products' category definitions.      No presently conceivable technology can make the judgments  necessary to determine whether a visual depiction fits the legal  definitions of obscenity, child pornography, or harmful to  minors.  Given the state of the art in filtering and image  recognition technology, and the rapidly changing and expanding  nature of the Web, we find that filtering products' shortcomings  will not be solved through a technical solution in the  foreseeable future.   In sum, filtering products are currently  unable to block only visual depictions that are obscene, child  pornography, or harmful to minors (or, only content matching a  filtering product's category definitions) while simultaneously  allowing access to all protected speech (or, all content not  matching the blocking product's category definitions).  Any  software filter that is reasonably effective in blocking access  to Web pages that fall within its category definitions will  necessarily erroneously block a substantial number of Web pages  that do not fall within its category definitions.  2.        Analytic Framework for the Opinion: The Centrality of Dole  and the Role of the Facial Challenge    Both the plaintiffs and the government agree that, because  this case involves a challenge to the constitutionality of the  conditions that Congress has set on state actors' receipt of  federal funds, the Supreme Court's decision in South Dakota v.  Dole, 483 U.S. 203 (1987), supplies the proper threshold analytic  framework.  The constitutional source of Congress's spending  power is Article I, Sec. 8, cl. 1, which provides that \"Congress  shall have Power . . . to pay the Debts and provide for the  common Defence and general Welfare of the United States.\"  In  Dole, the Court upheld the constitutionality of a federal statute  requiring the withholding of federal highway funds from any state  with a drinking age below 21.  Id. at 211-12.  In sustaining the  provision's constitutionality, Dole articulated four general  constitutional limitations on Congress's exercise of the spending  power.      First, \"the exercise of the spending power must be in  pursuit of 'the general welfare.'\"  Id. at 207.  Second, any  conditions that Congress sets on states' receipt of federal funds  must be sufficiently clear to enable recipients \"to exercise  their choice knowingly, cognizant of the consequences of their  participation.\"  Id. (internal quotation marks and citation  omitted).  Third, the conditions on the receipt of federal funds  must bear some relation to the purpose of the funding program.  Id.  And finally, \"other constitutional provisions may provide an  independent bar to the conditional grant of federal funds.\"  Id.  at 208.  In particular, the spending power \"may not be used to  induce the States to engage in activities that would themselves  be unconstitutional.  Thus, for example, a grant of federal funds  conditioned on invidiously discriminatory state action or the  infliction of cruel and unusual punishment would be an  illegitimate exercise of the Congress' broad spending power.\"  Id. at 210.      Plaintiffs do not contend that CIPA runs afoul of the first  three limitations.  However, they do allege that CIPA is  unconstitutional under the fourth prong of Dole because it will  induce public libraries to violate the First Amendment.  Plaintiffs therefore submit that the First Amendment \"provide[s]  an independent bar to the conditional grant of federal funds\"  created by CIPA.  Id. at 208.  More specifically, they argue that  by conditioning public libraries' receipt of federal funds on the  use of software filters, CIPA will induce public libraries to  violate the First Amendment rights of Internet content-providers  to disseminate constitutionally protected speech to library  patrons via the Internet, and the correlative First Amendment  rights of public library patrons to receive constitutionally  protected speech on the Internet.  The government concedes that under the Dole framework, CIPA  is facially invalid if its conditions will induce public  libraries to violate the First Amendment.  The government and the  plaintiffs disagree, however, on the meaning of Dole's  \"inducement\" requirement in the context of a First Amendment  facial challenge to the conditions that Congress places on state  actors' receipt of federal funds.  The government contends that  because plaintiffs are bringing a facial challenge, they must  show that under no circumstances is it possible for a public  library to comply with CIPA's conditions without violating the  First Amendment.  The plaintiffs respond that even if it is  possible for some public libraries to comply with CIPA without  violating the First Amendment, CIPA is facially invalid if it  \"will result in the impermissible suppression of a substantial  amount of protected speech.\"      Because it was clear in Dole that the states could comply  with the challenged conditions that Congress attached to the  receipt of federal funds without violating the Constitution, the  Dole Court did not have occasion to explain fully what it means  for Congress to use the spending power to \"induce [recipients] to  engage in activities that would themselves be unconstitutional.\"   Dole, 483 U.S. at 210; see id. at 211 (\"Were South Dakota to  succumb to the blandishments offered by Congress and raise its  drinking age to 21, the State's action in so doing would not  violate the constitutional rights of anyone.\").  Although the  proposition that Congress may not pay state actors to violate  citizens' First Amendment  rights is unexceptionable when stated  in the abstract, it is unclear what exactly a litigant must  establish to facially invalidate an exercise of Congress's  spending power on this ground.  In general, it is well-established that a court may sustain  a facial challenge to a statute only if the plaintiff  demonstrates that the statute admits of no constitutional  application.  See United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 745  (1987) (\"A facial challenge to a legislative Act "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5183"],[0,"The Unexpurgated Case Against Woman Suffrage (#16)"],[1,"ll, is the great instrument in the levelling up of the  financial situation of woman--can endure apart from some willing  subordination on the part of the wife.    It will have been observed that there is in these programmes, in  addition to the element of mental disorder and to the element of the  fatuous, which have been animadverted upon, also a very ugly element  of dishonesty. In reality the very kernel of the militant suffrage  movement is the element of immorality.    There is here not only immorality in the ends which are in view, but  also in the methods adopted for the attainment of those ends.    We may restrict ourselves to indicating wherein lies the immorality of  the methods.    There is no one who does not discern that woman in her relations to  physical force stands in quite a different position to man.    Out of that different relation there must of necessity shape itself a  special code of ethics for woman. And to violate that code must be for  woman immorality.    So far as I have seen, no one in this controversy has laid his finger  upon the essential point in the relations of woman to physical  violence.    It has been stated--and in the main quite truly stated--that woman in  the mass cannot, like man, back up her vote by bringing physical force  into play.    But the woman suffragist here counters by insisting that she as an  individual may have more physical force than an individual man.    And it is quite certain--and it did not need suffragist raids and  window-breaking riots to demonstrate it--that woman in the mass can  bring a certain amount of physical force to bear.    The true inwardness of the relation in which woman stands to physical  force lies not in the question of her having it at command, but in the  fact that she cannot put it forth without placing herself within the  jurisdiction of an ethical law.    The law against which she offends when she resorts to physical  violence is not an ordinance of man; it is not written in the statutes  of any State; it has not been enunciated by any human law-giver. It  belongs to those unwritten, and unassailable, and irreversible  commandments of religion, [_Greek_ 1], which we suddenly and  mysteriously become aware of when we see them violated.    [1 From _Antigone_ by Sophocles; \"_the unwritten and unassailable  statutes given to us by the gods._\" Sir Almroth had it in the original  Greek with Greek fonts.]    The law which the militant suffragist has violated is among the  ordinances of that code which forbade us even to think of employing  our native Indian troops against the Boers; which brands it as an  ignominy when a man leaves his fellow in the lurch and saves his own  life; and which makes it an outrage for a man to do violence to a  woman.    To violate any ordinance of that code is more dishonourable than to  transgress every statutory law.    We see acknowledgment of it in the fact that even the uneducated man  in the street resents it as an outrage to civilisation when he sees a  man strike a blow at a woman.    But to the man who is committing the outrage it is a thing simply  unaccountable that any one should fly out at him.    In just such a case is the militant suffragist. She cannot understand  why any one should think civilisation is outraged when she scuffles in  the street mud with a policeman.    If she asks for an explanation, it perhaps behoves a man to supply it.    Up to the present in the whole civilised world there has ruled a truce  of God as between man and woman. That truce is based upon the solemn  covenant that within the frontiers of civilisation (outside them of  course the rule lapses) the weapon of physical force may not be  applied by man against woman; nor by woman against man.    Under this covenant, the reign of force which prevails in the world  without comes to an end when a man enters his household.    Under this covenant that half of the human race which most needs  protection is raised up above the waves of violence.    Within the terms of this compact everything that woman has received  from man, and everything man receives from woman, is given as a free  gift.    Again, under this covenant a full half of the programme of  Christianity has been realised; and a foundation has been laid upon  which it may be possible to build higher; and perhaps finally in the  ideal future to achieve the abolition of physical violence and war.    And it is this solemn covenant, the covenant so faithfully kept by  man, which has been violated by the militant suffragist in the  interest of her morbid, stupid, ugly, and dishonest programmes.    Is it wonder if men feel that they have had enough of the militant  suffragist, and that the State would be well rid of her if she were  crushed under the soldiers' shields like the traitor woman at the  Tarpeian rock [in ancient Rome where traitors were killed]?    We may turn now to that section of woman suffragists--one is almost  inclined to doubt whether it any longer exists--which is opposed to  all violent measures, though it numbers in its ranks women who are  stung to the quick by the thought that man, who will concede the vote  to the lowest and most degraded of his own sex, withholds it from  \"even the noblest woman in England.\"    When that excited and somewhat pathetic appeal is addressed to us,  we have only to consider what a vote really gives.    The parliamentary vote is an instrument--and a quite astonishly  disappointing instrument it is--for obtaining legislation; that is,  for directing that the agents of the State shall in certain defined  circumstances bring into application the weapon of physical  compulsion.    Further, the vote is an instrument by which we give to this or that  group of statesmen anthority to supervise and keep in motion the whole  machinery of compulsion.    To take examples.  A vote cast in favour of a Bill for the prohibition  of alcohol--if we could find opportunity for giving a vote on such a  question--would be a formal expression of our desire to apply, through  the agency of the paid servants of the State, that same physical  compulsion which Mrs. Carrie Nation put into application in her  \"bar-smashing\" crusades.    And a vote which puts a Government into office in a country where  murder is punishable by death is a vote which, by agency of the  hangman, puts the noose round the neck of every convicted murderer.    So that the difference between voting and direct resort to force is  simply the difference between exerting physical violence in person,  and exerting it through the intermediary of an agent of the State.    The thing, therefore, that is withheld from \"the noblest woman in  England,\" while it is conceded to the man who is lacking in nobility  of character, is in the end only an instrument by which she might  bring into application physical force.    When one realises that that same noblest woman of England would shrink  from any personal exercise of violence, one would have thought that it  would have come home to her that it is not precisely her job to  commission a man forcibly to shut up a public-house, or to hang a  murderer.    One cannot help asking oneself whether, if she understood what a vote  really means, the noblest woman in England would still go on  complaining of the bitter insult which is done to her in withholding  the vote.    But the opportunist--the practical politician, as he calls  himself--will perhaps here intervene, holding some such language as  this:--\"Granting all you say, granting, for the sake of argument,  that the principle of giving votes to woman is unsound, and that evil  must ultimately come of it, how can you get over the fact that no very  conspicuous harm has resulted from woman suffrage in the countries  which have adopted it? And can any firm reasons be rendered for the  belief that the giving of votes to women in England would be any whit  more harmful than in the Colonies?\"    A very few words will supply the answer.    The evils of woman suffrage lie, _first,_ in the fact that to give the  vote to women is to give it to voters who as a class are quite  incompetent to adjudicate upon political issues; _secondly,_ in the  fact that women are a class of voters who cannot effectively back up  their votes by force; and, _thirdly,_ in the fact that it may  seriously embroil man and woman.    The first two aspects of the question have already in this controversy  been adequately dealt with. There remains the last issue.    From the point of view of this issue the conditions which we have to  deal with in this country are the absolute antithesis of those ruling  in any of the countries and States which have adopted woman suffrage.    When woman suffrage was adopted in these countries it was adopted in  some for one reason, in others for another. In some it was adopted  because it appealed to the _doctrinaire [theoretical]_ politician as  the proper logical outcome of a democratic and Socialistic policy. In  others it was adopted because opportunist politicians saw in it an  instrument by which they might gain electioneering advantages. So much  was this the case that it sometimes happened that the woman's vote was  sprung upon a community which was quite unprepared and indifferent to  it.    The cause of woman suffrage was thus in the countries of which we  speak neither in its inception nor in its realisation a question of  revolt of woman against the oppression of man. It had, and has, no  relation to the programmes of the militant suffragists as set out at  the outset of this letter.    By virtue of this, all the evils which spring from the embroiling of  man and woman have in the countries in question been conspicuously  absent.    Instead of seeing himself confronted by a section of embittered and  hostile women voters which might at any time outvote him and help to  turn an election, man there sees his women folk voting practically  everywhere in accordance"]]]
