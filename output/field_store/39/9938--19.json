She felt that George Melville was one to  whom she could safely trust her only boy. Moreover, her own time would  be partly occupied, owing to the arrangement she had just made to assist  in the post office, so that Herbert carried his point.    The tenth of October arrived, the date which George Melville had fixed  upon for his departure. Mrs. Carr had put Herbert's wardrobe in order,  and he had bought himself a capacious carpetbag and an umbrella, and  looked forward with eagerness to the day on which their journey was to  commence. He had long thought and dreamed of the West, its plains and  cities, but had never supposed that it would be his privilege to make  acquaintance with them, at any rate, until he should have become twice  his present age. But the unexpected had happened, and on Monday he and  George Melville were to start for Chicago.          CHAPTER XX. AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE IN CHICAGO.        In due time our travelers reached Chicago, and put up at the Palmer  House. Herbert was much impressed by the elegance of the hotel, its  sumptuous furniture, and luxurious table. It must be considered that he  was an inexperienced traveler, though had he been otherwise he might be  excused for his admiration.    \"I have some business in Chicago, and shall remain two or three days,\"  said George Melville.    Herbert was quite reconciled to the delay, and, as his services were not  required, employed his time in making himself familiar with the famous  Western city. He kept his eyes open, and found something new and  interesting at every step. One day, as he was passing through the lower  portion of the city, his attention was called to a young man wheeling a  barrow of cabbages and other vegetables, a little in advance of him.  Of course, there was nothing singular about this, but there seemed  something familiar in the figure of the young man. Herbert quickened his  step, and soon came up with him.    One glance was enough. Though disguised by a pair of overalls, and  without a coat, Herbert recognized the once spruce dry-goods clerk, Eben  Graham.    Eben recognized Herbert at the same time. He started, and flushed with  shame, not because of the theft of which he had been guilty, but because  he was detected in an honest, but plebeian labor.    \"Herbert Carr!\" he exclaimed, stopping short.    \"Yes, Eben; it is I!\"    \"You find me changed,\" said Eben, dolefully.    \"No, I should recognize you anywhere.\"    \"I don't mean that. I have sunk very low,\" and he glanced pathetically  at the wheelbarrow.    \"If you refer to your employment, I don't agree with you. It is an  honest business.\"    \"True, but I never dreamed when I stood behind the counter in Boston,  and waited on fashionable ladies, that I should ever come to this.\"    \"He seems more ashamed of wheeling vegetables than of stealing,\" thought  Herbert, and he was correct.    \"How do you happen to be in this business, Eben?\" he asked, with some  curiosity.    \"I must do it or starve. I was cheated out of my money soon after I came  here, and didn't know where to turn.\"    Eben did not explain that he lost his money in a gambling house.  He might have been cheated out of it, but it was his own fault, for  venturing into competition with older and more experienced knaves than  himself.    \"I went for thirty-six hours without food,\" continued Eben, \"when I fell  in with a man who kept a vegetable store, and he offered to employ me. I  have been with him ever since.\"    \"You were fortunate to find employment,\" said Herbert.    \"Fortunate!\" repeated Eben, in a tragic tone. \"How much wages do you  think I get?\"    \"I can't guess.\"    \"Five dollars a week, and have to find myself,\" answered Eben,  mournfully. \"What would my fashionable friends in Boston say if they  could see me?\"    \"I wouldn't mind what they said as long as you are getting an honest  living.\"    \"How do you happen to be out here?\" asked Eben.    His story was told in a few words.    \"You are always in luck!\" said Eben, enviously. \"I wish I had your  chance. Is Mr. Melville very rich?\"    \"He is rich; but I don't know how rich.\"    \"Do you think he'd lend me money enough to get home?\"    \"I don't know.\"    \"Will you ask him?\"    \"I will tell him that you made the request, Eben,\" answered Herbert,  cautiously. \"Have you applied to your father?\"    \"To the old man? Yes. He hasn't any more heart than a grindstone,\" said  Eben, bitterly. \"What do you think he wrote me?\"    \"He refused, I suppose.\"    \"Here is his letter,\" said Eben, drawing from his pocket a greasy half  sheet of note paper. \"See what he has to say to his only son.\"    This was the letter:    \"EBEN GRAHAM: I have received your letter, and am not surprised to hear  that you are in trouble. 'As a man sows, so also shall he reap.' A young  man who will rob his father of his hard earnings is capable of anything.  You have done what you could to ruin me, and deserve what you have got.  You want me to send you money to come home, and continue your wicked  work--I shall not do it. I wash my hands of you; I have already given  notice, through the country paper that I have given you your time, and  shall pay no more debts of your contracting.    \"I am glad to hear that you are engaged in an honest employment. It is  better than I expected. I would not have been surprised if I had heard  that you were in jail. My advice to you is to stay where you are and  make yourself useful to your employer. He may in time raise your wages.  Five years hence, if you have turned over a new leaf and led an honest  life, I may give you a place in my store. At present, I would rather  leave you where you are.    \"EBENEZER GRAHAM.\"    \"What do you say to that? Isn't that rather rough on an only son, eh?\"  said Eben.    It occurred to Herbert that Eben hardly deserved very liberal treatment  from his father, notwithstanding he was an only son.    \"Oh, the old man is awfully mean and close-fisted,\" said Eben. \"He cares  more for money than for anything else. By the way, how does Melville  treat you?\"    \"Mr. Melville,\" said Herbert, emphasizing the Mr., \"is always kind and  considerate.\"    \"Pays you well, eh?\"    \"He pays me more than I could get anywhere else.\"    \"Pays all your hotel and traveling expenses, eh?\"    \"Of course.\"    \"And a good salary besides?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Herbert,\" said Eben, suddenly, \"I want you to do me a favor.\"    \"What is it?\"    \"You've always known me, you know. When you was a little chap, and came  into the store, I used to give you sticks of candy.\"    \"I don't remember it,\" answered Herbert, truthfully.    \"I did, all the same. You were so young that you don't remember it.\"    \"Well, Eben, what of it?\"    \"I want you to lend me ten dollars, Herbert, in memory of old times.\"    Herbert was generously inclined, on ordinary occasions, but did not feel  so on this occasion. He felt that Eben was not a deserving object, even  had he felt able to make so large a loan. Besides, he could not forget  that the young man who now asked a favor had brought a false charge of  stealing against him.    \"You will have to excuse me, Eben,\" he answered. \"To begin with, I  cannot afford to lend so large a sum.\"    \"I would pay you back as soon as I could.\"    \"Perhaps you would,\" said Herbert, \"though I have not much confidence  in it. But you seem to forget that you charged me with stealing only a  short time since. I wonder how you have the face to ask me to lend you  ten dollars, or any sum.\"    \"It was a mistake,\" muttered Eben, showing some signs of confusion.    \"At any rate, I won't say anything more about it while you are in  trouble. But you must excuse my declining to lend you.\"    \"Lend me five dollars, then,\" pleaded Eben.    \"What do you want to do with it?\"    \"To buy lottery tickets. I am almost sure I should win a prize, and then  I can pay you five dollars for one.\"    \"I wouldn't lend any money for that purpose to my dearest friend,\" said  Herbert \"Buying lottery tickets is about the most foolish investment you  could make.\"    \"Then I won't buy any,\" said Eben. \"Lend me the money and I will use it  to buy clothes.\"    \"You will have to excuse me,\" said Herbert, coldly.    \"I didn't think you'd be so mean,\" whined Eben, \"to a friend in  distress.\"    \"I don't look upon you as a friend, and for very good reasons,\" retorted  Herbert, as he walked away.    Eben looked after him with a scowl of hatred.    \"I'd like to humble that boy's pride,\" he muttered, as he slowly resumed  his march.          CHAPTER XXI. COL. WARNER.        When Herbert returned to the hotel he found George Melville in the  reading room in conversation with a tall and dignified-looking stranger.    \"Is that your brother, Mr. Melville?\" asked the latter, as Herbert came  forward and spoke to Melville.    \"No, Colonel, he is my young friend and confidential clerk, Herbert  Carr.\"    \"Glad to make your acquaintance, Mr. Carr,\" said the colonel, affably,  extending his hand as he spoke.    \"This is Col. Warner, Herbert,\" explained George Melville.    Herbert, who was naturally polite, shook hands with the colonel, and  said he was glad to make his acquaintance.    \"I have been talking with Mr. Melville,\" said the colonel. \"I am sorry  to hear that he is traveling in search of health.\"    \"Yes, sir; I hope he will find his journey beneficial.\"    \"Oh, not a doubt of it! Not a doubt of it! I've been there myself. Do  you know, when I was twenty-five, which I take to be about the age of  your employer, I thought I should die of consumption?\"    \"I shouldn't have supposed it, sir,\" said Herbert, and Melville, too,  felt surprised, as he noticed the stalwart proportions of the former  consumptive.    \"Ha! ha! I dare say not,\" said the colonel, laughing. \"I don't look much  like it now, eh?\"    \"No, you certainly don't, colonel,\" said Melville. \"I am curious to know  how you overcame the threatened danger.\"    \"I did what "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5760"],[0,"Two Trips to Gorilla Land and the Cataracts of the Congo, Volume 1 (#16)"],[1,"linguist  also asserts that it is almost entirely free from guttural and  nasal sounds; the latter appeared to me as numerous and  complicated as in the Sanskrit. Mr. Wilson could hardly have had  a nice ear, or he would not have written Nchígo \"Ntyege,\" or  Njína \"Engena,\" which gives a thoroughly un-African distinctness  to the initial consonant.    The adjectival form is archaically expressed by a second and  abstract substantive. This peculiarity is common in the South  African family, as in Ashanti; but, as Bowdich observes, we also  find it in Greek, e.g. <Greek>                 , \"heresies of  destruction\" for destructive. Another notable characteristic is  the Mpongwe's fondness for the passive voice, never using, if  possible, the active; for instance, instead of saying, \"He was  born thus,\" he prefers, \"The birth that was thus borned by him.\"  The dialect changes the final as well as the initial syllable, a  process unknown to the purest types of the South African family.  As we advance north we find this phenomenon ever increasing; for  instance in Fernando Po; but the Mpongwe limits the change to  verbs.    Another distinguishing point of these three Gaboon tongues, as  the Rev. Mr. Mackey observes, is \"the surprizing flexibility of  the verb, the almost endless variety of parts regularly derived  from a single root. There are, perhaps, no other languages in the  world that approach them in the variety and extent of the  inflections of the verb, possessing at the same time such rigid  regularity of conjugation and precision of the meaning attached  to each part.\" It is calculated that the whole number of tenses  or shades of meaning which a Mpongwe radical verb may be made to  express, with the aid of its auxiliary particles, augmentatives,  and negatives--prefixes, infixes, and suffixes--is between twelve  and fifteen hundred, worse than an Arabic triliteral.    Liquid and eminently harmonious, concise and capable of  contraction, the Mpongwe tongue does not deserve to die out. \"The  genius of the language is such that new terms may be introduced  in relation to ethics, metaphysics, and science; even to the  great truths of the Christian religion.\"    The main defect is that of the South African languages generally-  -a deficiency of syntax, of gender and case; a want of vigour in  sound; a too great precision of expression, rendering it clumsy  and unwieldy; and an absence of exceptions, which give beauty and  variety to speech. The people have never invented any form of  alphabet, yet the abundance of tale, legend, and proverb which  their dialect contains might repay the trouble of acquiring it.                                       Chapter V.                        To Sánga-Tánga and Back.        My objects in visiting Mbátá, the reader will have understood,  were to shoot a specimen or specimens of the gorilla, and, if  possible, to buy or catch a youngster. Even before landing, the  pilot had assured me that a \"baby\" was on sale at the Comptoir,  but on inquiry it proved to have died. I was by no means sanguine  of success--when the fight is against Time, the Old Man usually  wins the day. The short limits of my trip would not allow me to  wander beyond the coast and the nearer riverine regions, where  frequent villages and the constant firing of muskets have taught  all wild animals that flight is their only defence; thus, besides  being rare, they must be shy and timid, wary and knowing, \"like  an old hedgehog hunted for his grease.\" The first glance at the  bush suggested, \"Surely it is impossible to find big game in such  a land of farms and plantations.\"    Those who have shot under such circumstances will readily  understand that everything depends upon \"luck;\" one man may beat  the forest assiduously and vainly for five or six weeks; another  will be successful on the first day. Thus whilst I, without any  fault of my own, utterly failed in shooting a gorilla, although I  saw him and heard him, and came upon his trail, and found his  mortal spoils, another traveller had hardly landed in the Gaboon  before he was so fortunate as to bring down a fine anthropoid.    However, as man cannot command success, I was obliged to content  myself with doing all in my power to deserve it. I offered five  dollars, equalling the same number of sovereigns in England, to  every huntsman for every fair shot, and ten dollars for each live  ape. I implicitly obeyed all words of command, and my factotum  Selim Agha was indefatigable in his zeal. Indeed \"luck\" was dead  against us during the whole of my stay in Gorilla-land. We ran a  fair risk of drowning in the first day's voyage; on the next  march we were knocked down by lightning, and on the last trip I  had a narrow escape from the fall of a giant branch that grazed  my hammock.    My first \"bush\" evening was spent in palm-wine, rum, and wassail;  one must begin by humouring Africans, under pain of being  considered a churl; but the inevitable result is, that next day  they will by some pretext or other shirk work to enjoy the  headache. That old villain, \"Young Prince,\" becoming very fou,  hospitably offered me his daughter-in-law Azizeh, Forteune's  second wife; and he was vigorously supported by the Nimrod  himself, who had drawn a horizontal line of white chalk above the  eyebrows, a defence against the Ibambo, those bad ghosts that  cause fevers and sickness. Forteune then hinted that perhaps I  might prefer his daughter--\"he be piccanniny; he be all same  woman.\" Marchandise offerte a le pied coupé, both offers were  declined with, Merci, non! Sporting parties are often made up by  the Messieurs du Plateau, I had been told at the Comptoir; but  such are the fascinations of les petites, that few ever progress  beyond the first village. There was, consequently, wonder in the  land as to what manner of utangáni this one might be.    It is only fair to own that the ladies endured with great  philosophy the spretæ injuria formæ, and made no difference in  their behaviour on account of their charms being unappreciated.  Azízeh was a stout and sturdy personage of twenty-five, with  thick wrists and ankles, a very dark skin, and a face rendered  pleasing by good humour. And Azízeh was childless, a sad reproach  in these lands, where progeny forms a man's wealth and a woman's  honour.    The next day was perforce a halt, as had been expected; moreover,  rains and tornadoes were a reasonable pretext for nursing the  headache. The 21st was also wet and stormy, so Nimrod hid himself  and was not to be found. Then the balivernes began. One Asini, a  Mpongwe from the Plateau, offered to show me a huge gorilla near  his village; in the afternoon he was confronted with \"Young  Prince,\" and he would have blushed scarlet if he could. But he  assured me plaintively that he must lie to live, and, after all,  la prudence des souris n'est pas celle des chats. Before dark,  Forteune appeared, and swore that he had spent the day in the  forest, he had shot at a gorilla, but the gun missed fire--of  course he had slept in a snug hut.    This last determined me to leave Mbátá; the three Kru-men had  returned; one of them was stationed in charge of the boat, and  next morning we set out at 6 A.M. for Nche Mpolo, the  headquarters of \"Young Prince.\" The well-wooded land was devoid  of fetor, even at that early hour; we passed Ndagola, a fresh  clearing and newly built huts, and then we skirted a deep and  forested depression, upon whose further side lay our bourne. It  promised sand-flies, the prime pest of this region; a tall  amphitheatre of trees on a dune to the west excluded the sea-  breeze, and northwards a swampy hollow was a fine breeding place  for M. Maringouin.    Nche Mpolo lies some three miles nearly due south of Mbátá; the  single street contains fourteen cottages and two palaver houses.  We were received with distinction by \"Young Prince's\" daughter, a  huge young woman, whose still huger mamma was from Cape Lopez.  She placed mats upon the bamboo couch under the verandah, brought  water to wash our feet, and put the kettle on that we might have  tea. The sun was fiery and the day sultry; my companions  complained of fatigue after a two hours' walk, and then busied  themselves ostentatiously in cleaning their muskets, in  collecting provisions, and in appointing certain bushmen to meet  us on the morrow. Before dark Hotaloya returned to his village,  declaring that he could find no bed at his papa's. Probably the  uxorious youth had been ordered home by his pet wife, who had  once lived with a European trader, who spoke a few words of  English, and who cooked with peculiar skill,--the solid merits of  a \"superior person.\"    At dawn on the 23rd we set out for the southern bush, Selim,  Forteune, and a carrier Kru-man--to carry nothing. We passed  through a fresh clearing, we traversed another village (three  within five miles!), we crossed a bad bridge and a clear stream  flowing to the south-east, and presently we found ourselves deep  in the dew-dripping forest. The leaves no longer crackled crisp  under foot, and the late rains had made the swamps somewhat  odorous. After an hour of cautious walking, listening as we went,  we saw evident signs of Mister Gorilla. Boughs three inches in  diameter strewed the ground; the husks of Ntondo or Ibere (wild  cardamom) had been scattered about, and a huge hare's form of  leaves lay some five yards from the tree where Forteune declared  that Mistress and Master Gorilla had passed the night,  Paterfamilias keeping watch below. A little beyond we were shown  a spot where two males had been fighting a duel, or where a  couple had been indulging in dalliance sweet; the prints were 8  inches long and 6 across the huge round toes; whilst the hinder  hand appeared almost bifurcate, the thumb forming nearly a half.  This is explained in the \"Gorilla Book\" (chap, xx.): \"Only the  ball of the foot, and that thumb which "]]]
