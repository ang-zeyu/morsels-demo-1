That  for centuries European thinkers only thought in order to prove  something--nowadays, on the contrary, we are suspicious of every thinker  who \"wishes to prove something\"--that it was always settled beforehand  what WAS TO BE the result of their strictest thinking, as it was perhaps  in the Asiatic astrology of former times, or as it is still at the  present day in the innocent, Christian-moral explanation of immediate  personal events \"for the glory of God,\" or \"for the good of the  soul\":--this tyranny, this arbitrariness, this severe and magnificent  stupidity, has EDUCATED the spirit; slavery, both in the coarser and  the finer sense, is apparently an indispensable means even of spiritual  education and discipline. One may look at every system of morals in this  light: it is \"nature\" therein which teaches to hate the laisser-aller,  the too great freedom, and implants the need for limited horizons, for  immediate duties--it teaches the NARROWING OF PERSPECTIVES, and thus, in  a certain sense, that stupidity is a condition of life and development.  \"Thou must obey some one, and for a long time; OTHERWISE thou wilt come  to grief, and lose all respect for thyself\"--this seems to me to be the  moral imperative of nature, which is certainly neither \"categorical,\"  as old Kant wished (consequently the \"otherwise\"), nor does it address  itself to the individual (what does nature care for the individual!),  but to nations, races, ages, and ranks; above all, however, to the  animal \"man\" generally, to MANKIND.    189. Industrious races find it a great hardship to be idle: it was a  master stroke of ENGLISH instinct to hallow and begloom Sunday to such  an extent that the Englishman unconsciously hankers for his week--and  work-day again:--as a kind of cleverly devised, cleverly intercalated  FAST, such as is also frequently found in the ancient world (although,  as is appropriate in southern nations, not precisely with respect  to work). Many kinds of fasts are necessary; and wherever powerful  influences and habits prevail, legislators have to see that intercalary  days are appointed, on which such impulses are fettered, and learn to  hunger anew. Viewed from a higher standpoint, whole generations and  epochs, when they show themselves infected with any moral fanaticism,  seem like those intercalated periods of restraint and fasting, during  which an impulse learns to humble and submit itself--at the same time  also to PURIFY and SHARPEN itself; certain philosophical sects likewise  admit of a similar interpretation (for instance, the Stoa, in the midst  of Hellenic culture, with the atmosphere rank and overcharged with  Aphrodisiacal odours).--Here also is a hint for the explanation of the  paradox, why it was precisely in the most Christian period of European  history, and in general only under the pressure of Christian sentiments,  that the sexual impulse sublimated into love (amour-passion).    190. There is something in the morality of Plato which does not really  belong to Plato, but which only appears in his philosophy, one might  say, in spite of him: namely, Socratism, for which he himself was  too noble. \"No one desires to injure himself, hence all evil is done  unwittingly. The evil man inflicts injury on himself; he would not do  so, however, if he knew that evil is evil. The evil man, therefore, is  only evil through error; if one free him from error one will necessarily  make him--good.\"--This mode of reasoning savours of the POPULACE, who  perceive only the unpleasant consequences of evil-doing, and practically  judge that \"it is STUPID to do wrong\"; while they accept \"good\" as  identical with \"useful and pleasant,\" without further thought. As  regards every system of utilitarianism, one may at once assume that it  has the same origin, and follow the scent: one will seldom err.--Plato  did all he could to interpret something refined and noble into the  tenets of his teacher, and above all to interpret himself into them--he,  the most daring of all interpreters, who lifted the entire Socrates out  of the street, as a popular theme and song, to exhibit him in endless  and impossible modifications--namely, in all his own disguises and  multiplicities. In jest, and in Homeric language as well, what is the  Platonic Socrates, if not--[Greek words inserted here.]    191. The old theological problem of \"Faith\" and \"Knowledge,\" or more  plainly, of instinct and reason--the question whether, in respect to the  valuation of things, instinct deserves more authority than rationality,  which wants to appreciate and act according to motives, according to  a \"Why,\" that is to say, in conformity to purpose and utility--it  is always the old moral problem that first appeared in the person of  Socrates, and had divided men's minds long before Christianity. Socrates  himself, following, of course, the taste of his talent--that of a  surpassing dialectician--took first the side of reason; and, in fact,  what did he do all his life but laugh at the awkward incapacity of the  noble Athenians, who were men of instinct, like all noble men, and could  never give satisfactory answers concerning the motives of their actions?  In the end, however, though silently and secretly, he laughed also  at himself: with his finer conscience and introspection, he found  in himself the same difficulty and incapacity. \"But why\"--he said  to himself--\"should one on that account separate oneself from the  instincts! One must set them right, and the reason ALSO--one must follow  the instincts, but at the same time persuade the reason to support them  with good arguments.\" This was the real FALSENESS of that great and  mysterious ironist; he brought his conscience up to the point that he  was satisfied with a kind of self-outwitting: in fact, he perceived  the irrationality in the moral judgment.--Plato, more innocent in such  matters, and without the craftiness of the plebeian, wished to prove to  himself, at the expenditure of all his strength--the greatest strength  a philosopher had ever expended--that reason and instinct lead  spontaneously to one goal, to the good, to \"God\"; and since Plato, all  theologians and philosophers have followed the same path--which means  that in matters of morality, instinct (or as Christians call it,  \"Faith,\" or as I call it, \"the herd\") has hitherto triumphed. Unless  one should make an exception in the case of Descartes, the father of  rationalism (and consequently the grandfather of the Revolution), who  recognized only the authority of reason: but reason is only a tool, and  Descartes was superficial.    192. Whoever has followed the history of a single science, finds in  its development a clue to the understanding of the oldest and commonest  processes of all \"knowledge and cognizance\": there, as here, the  premature hypotheses, the fictions, the good stupid will to \"belief,\"  and the lack of distrust and patience are first developed--our senses  learn late, and never learn completely, to be subtle, reliable, and  cautious organs of knowledge. Our eyes find it easier on a given  occasion to produce a picture already often produced, than to seize upon  the divergence and novelty of an impression: the latter requires more  force, more \"morality.\" It is difficult and painful for the ear to  listen to anything new; we hear strange music badly. When we hear  another language spoken, we involuntarily attempt to form the sounds  into words with which we are more familiar and conversant--it was thus,  for example, that the Germans modified the spoken word ARCUBALISTA into  ARMBRUST (cross-bow). Our senses are also hostile and averse to the  new; and generally, even in the \"simplest\" processes of sensation, the  emotions DOMINATE--such as fear, love, hatred, and the passive emotion  of indolence.--As little as a reader nowadays reads all the single words  (not to speak of syllables) of a page--he rather takes about five out  of every twenty words at random, and \"guesses\" the probably appropriate  sense to them--just as little do we see a tree correctly and completely  in respect to its leaves, branches, colour, and shape; we find it so  much easier to fancy the chance of a tree. Even in the midst of the  most remarkable experiences, we still do just the same; we fabricate the  greater part of the experience, and can hardly be made to contemplate  any event, EXCEPT as \"inventors\" thereof. All this goes to prove  that from our fundamental nature and from remote ages we have  been--ACCUSTOMED TO LYING. Or, to express it more politely and  hypocritically, in short, more pleasantly--one is much more of an artist  than one is aware of.--In an animated conversation, I often see the face  of the person with whom I am speaking so clearly and sharply defined  before me, according to the thought he expresses, or which I believe to  be evoked in his mind, that the degree of distinctness far exceeds the  STRENGTH of my visual faculty--the delicacy of the play of the muscles  and of the expression of the eyes MUST therefore be imagined by me.  Probably the person put on quite a different expression, or none at all.    193. Quidquid luce fuit, tenebris agit: but also contrariwise. What we  experience in dreams, provided we experience it often, pertains at  last just as much to the general belongings of our soul as anything  \"actually\" experienced; by virtue thereof we are richer or poorer, we  have a requirement more or less, and finally, in broad daylight, and  even in the brightest moments of our waking life, we are ruled to some  extent by the nature of our dreams. Supposing that someone has often  flown in his dreams,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4367"],[0,"Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant, Complete (#16)"],[1,"their food, ordered tents struck and made the  march that night which had been intended for the next day.  Some  commanders can move troops so as to get the maximum distance out of them  without fatigue, while others can wear them out in a few days without  accomplishing so much. General Worth belonged to this latter class.  He  enjoyed, however, a fine reputation for his fighting qualities, and thus  attached his officers and men to him.    The army lay in camp upon the sand-beach in the neighborhood of the  mouth of the Rio Grande for several weeks, awaiting the arrival of  transports to carry it to its new field of operations.  The transports  were all sailing vessels.  The passage was a tedious one, and many of  the troops were on shipboard over thirty days from the embarkation at  the mouth of the Rio Grande to the time of debarkation south of Vera  Cruz. The trip was a comfortless one for officers and men.  The  transports used were built for carrying freight and possessed but  limited accommodations for passengers, and the climate added to the  discomfort of all.    The transports with troops were assembled in the harbor of Anton  Lizardo, some sixteen miles south of Vera Cruz, as they arrived, and  there awaited the remainder of the fleet, bringing artillery, ammunition  and supplies of all kinds from the North.  With the fleet there was a  little steam propeller dispatch-boat--the first vessel of the kind I had  ever seen, and probably the first of its kind ever seen by any one then  with the army.  At that day ocean steamers were rare, and what there  were were sidewheelers.  This little vessel, going through the fleet so  fast, so noiselessly and with its propeller under water out of view,  attracted a great deal of attention.  I recollect that Lieutenant Sidney  Smith, of the 4th infantry, by whom I happened to be standing on the  deck of a vessel when this propeller was passing, exclaimed, \"Why, the  thing looks as if it was propelled by the force of circumstances.\"    Finally on the 7th of March, 1847, the little army of ten or twelve  thousand men, given Scott to invade a country with a population of seven  or eight millions, a mountainous country affording the greatest possible  natural advantages for defence, was all assembled and ready to commence  the perilous task of landing from vessels lying in the open sea.    The debarkation took place inside of the little island of Sacrificios,  some three miles south of Vera Cruz.  The vessels could not get anywhere  near shore, so that everything had to be landed in lighters or  surf-boats; General Scott had provided these before leaving the North.  The breakers were sometimes high, so that the landing was tedious.  The  men were got ashore rapidly, because they could wade when they came to  shallow water; but the camp and garrison equipage, provisions,  ammunition and all stores had to be protected from the salt water, and  therefore their landing took several days.  The Mexicans were very kind  to us, however, and threw no obstacles in the way of our landing except  an occasional shot from their nearest fort.  During the debarkation one  shot took off the head of Major Albertis.  No other, I believe, reached  anywhere near the same distance.  On the 9th of March the troops were  landed and the investment of Vera Cruz, from the Gulf of Mexico south of  the city to the Gulf again on the north, was soon and easily effected.  The landing of stores was continued until everything was got ashore.    Vera Cruz, at the time of which I write and up to 1880, was a walled  city.  The wall extended from the water's edge south of the town to the  water again on the north.  There were fortifications at intervals along  the line and at the angles. In front of the city, and on an island half  a mile out in the Gulf, stands San Juan de Ulloa, an enclosed  fortification of large dimensions and great strength for that period.  Against artillery of the present day the land forts and walls would  prove elements of weakness rather than strength.  After the invading  army had established their camps out of range of the fire from the city,  batteries were established, under cover of night, far to the front of  the line where the troops lay.  These batteries were intrenched and the  approaches sufficiently protected.  If a sortie had been made at any  time by the Mexicans, the men serving the batteries could have been  quickly reinforced without great exposure to the fire from the enemy's  main line.  No serious attempt was made to capture the batteries or to  drive our troops away.    The siege continued with brisk firing on our side till the 27th of  March, by which time a considerable breach had been made in the wall  surrounding the city.  Upon this General Morales, who was Governor of  both the city and of San Juan de Ulloa, commenced a correspondence with  General Scott looking to the surrender of the town, forts and garrison.  On the 29th Vera Cruz and San Juan de Ulloa were occupied by Scott's  army.  About five thousand prisoners and four hundred pieces of  artillery, besides large amounts of small arms and ammunition, fell into  the hands of the victorious force.  The casualties on our side during  the siege amounted to sixty-four officers and men, killed and wounded.        CHAPTER X.    MARCH TO JALAPA--BATTLE OF CERRO GORDO--PEROTE--PUEBLA--SCOTT AND  TAYLOR.    General Scott had less than twelve thousand men at Vera Cruz. He had  been promised by the administration a very much larger force, or claimed  that he had, and he was a man of veracity. Twelve thousand was a very  small army with which to penetrate two hundred and sixty miles into an  enemy's country, and to besiege the capital; a city, at that time, of  largely over one hundred thousand inhabitants.  Then, too, any line of  march that could be selected led through mountain passes easily  defended. In fact, there were at that time but two roads from Vera Cruz  to the City of Mexico that could be taken by an army; one by Jalapa and  Perote, the other by Cordova and Orizaba, the two coming together on the  great plain which extends to the City of Mexico after the range of  mountains is passed.    It was very important to get the army away from Vera Cruz as soon as  possible, in order to avoid the yellow fever, or vomito, which usually  visits that city early in the year, and is very fatal to persons not  acclimated; but transportation, which was expected from the North, was  arriving very slowly.  It was absolutely necessary to have enough to  supply the army to Jalapa, sixty-five miles in the interior and above  the fevers of the coast.  At that point the country is fertile, and an  army of the size of General Scott's could subsist there for an  indefinite period.  Not counting the sick, the weak and the garrisons  for the captured city and fort, the moving column was now less than ten  thousand strong.  This force was composed of three divisions, under  Generals Twiggs, Patterson, and Worth. The importance of escaping the  vomito was so great that as soon as transportation enough could be got  together to move a division the advance was commenced.  On the 8th of  April, Twiggs's division started for Jalapa.  He was followed very soon  by Patterson, with his division.  General Worth was to bring up the rear  with his command as soon as transportation enough was assembled to carry  six days' rations for his troops with the necessary ammunition and camp  and garrison equipage.  It was the 13th of April before this division  left Vera Cruz.    The leading division ran against the enemy at Cerro Gordo, some fifty  miles west, on the road to Jalapa, and went into camp at Plan del Rio,  about three miles from the fortifications. General Patterson reached  Plan del Rio with his division soon after Twiggs arrived.  The two were  then secure against an attack from Santa Anna, who commanded the Mexican  forces.  At all events they confronted the enemy without reinforcements  and without molestation, until the 18th of April.  General Scott had  remained at Vera Cruz to hasten preparations for the field; but on the  12th, learning the situation at the front, he hastened on to take  personal supervision.  He at once commenced his preparations for the  capture of the position held by Santa Anna and of the troops holding it.    Cerro Gordo is one of the higher spurs of the mountains some twelve to  fifteen miles east of Jalapa, and Santa Anna had selected this point as  the easiest to defend against an invading army.  The road, said to have  been built by Cortez, zigzags around the mountain-side and was defended  at every turn by artillery.  On either side were deep chasms or mountain  walls. A direct attack along the road was an impossibility.  A flank  movement seemed equally impossible.  After the arrival of the  commanding-general upon the scene, reconnoissances were sent out to  find, or to make, a road by which the rear of the enemy's works might be  reached without a front attack.  These reconnoissances were made under  the supervision of Captain Robert E. Lee, assisted by Lieutenants P. G.  T. Beauregard, Isaac I. Stevens, Z. B. Tower, G. W. Smith, George B.  McClellan, and J. G. Foster, of the corps of engineers, all officers who  attained rank and fame, on one side or the other, in the great conflict  for the preservation of the unity of the nation.  The reconnoissance was  completed, and the labor of cutting out and making roads by the flank of  the enemy was effected by the 17th of the month.  This was accomplished  without the knowledge of Santa Anna or his army, and over ground where  he supposed it impossible.  On the same day General Scott issued his  order for the attack on the 18th.    The attack was made as ordered, and perhaps there was not a battle of  the Mexican war, or of any other, where orders issued before an  engagement were nearer being a correct report of what afterwards took  "]]]
