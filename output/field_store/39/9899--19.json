HAGEN [_Still as before:_    Though courage she bestowed,  I have no cause to thank her  For falling under thy spell;  Soon old, wan and pale,      Hating the happy,      Where is my joy?    ALBERICH [_As before._        Hagen, my son,      Hate thou the happy;      This joyless and      Sorrow-laden one,  Him alone thou shalt love.      Be thou strong      And bold and wise!      Those whom with weapons      Of darkness we fight  Already our hate has dismayed.  And he who captured my ring,  Wotan, the ravening robber,      By one of his sons      In fight has been vanquished;      He has lost  Through the Wälsung power and might.  With the whole immortal race  He awaits in anguish his downfall.  Him I fear no more:  He and all his must perish!  Hagen, son, art asleep?    HAGEN            [_Remains motionless as before._        The might of the Gods      Who then shall wield?    ALBERICH        I--and thou!      The world we shall own,      If in thy truth      I rightly trust,  Sharest thou my hate and wrath.      Wotan's spear      Was splintered by Siegfried,      The hero who won      As booty the ring  When Fafner, the dragon, he slew.      Power supreme      He has attained to;    [Illustration: The wooing of Grimhilde, the mother of Hagen. See p. 135]            [_Still mysteriously._    Walhall and Nibelheim bow to his will.      On this hero undaunted      My curse falls in vain,      For he knows not      The ring's true worth,      Nor makes use      Of its wonderful spell;  Laughing he burns life away,  Caring only for love.      Nothing can serve us      But his undoing!    Sleepest, Hagen, my son?    HAGEN [_As before._        Already he speeds      Through me to his doom.    ALBERICH        The golden ring--  'Tis that that we must capture!      The Wälsung  By a wise woman is loved.      If, urged by her,      To the Rhine's fair daughters      --Who bewitched me once      Below in the waves--  The stolen ring he restored,  Forever lost were the gold,  And no guile could win it again.      Wherefore with ardour      Aim for the ring.      I gat thee      A stranger to fear,      That against heroes      Thou mightst uphold me.      I had not the strength,      Indeed, to despatch,  Like the Wälsung, Fafner in fight;      But I reared Hagen      To deadly hatred,  And he shall avenge me--      Shall win the ring,  Putting Wälsung and Wotan to scorn!  Swear to me, Hagen, my son!            [_From this point Alberich is covered by an          ever-deepening shadow. At the same time day begins          to dawn._    HAGEN [_Still as before._        The ring shall be mine yet;      Quietly wait!    ALBERICH    Swear to me, Hagen, my son!    HAGEN        To myself swear I;      Make thy mind easy!    ALBERICH            [_Still gradually disappearing, and his voice, as          he does so, becoming more and more inaudible._    Be true, Hagen, my son!  Trusty hero, be true!      Be true!--True!            [_Alberich has quite disappeared. Hagen, who has          never changed position, looks with fixed eyes and          without moving towards the Rhine, over which the          light of dawn is spreading._      [Illustration: \"Swear to me, Hagen, my son!\"--See p. 138]          _The gradually brightening red of dawn is reflected      in the Rhine. Siegfried steps out suddenly from      behind a bush close to the shore. He appears in his      own shape, but has the Tarnhelm on his head still;      he takes this off and, as he comes forward, hangs      it on his girdle._    SIEGFRIED        Hoioh! Hagen!      Weary man!      Where is thy welcome?    HAGEN [_Rising in a leisurely fashion._        Hei! Siegfried?      Swift-footed hero,      Whence stormest thou now?    SIEGFRIED        From Brünnhilde's rock.  'Twas there that I drew the breath  I called to thee with;  A quick passage I made!  Slower behind me a pair  On board a vessel come.    HAGEN        Hast thou won Brünnhild'?    SIEGFRIED        Wakes Gutrune?    HAGEN [_Calling towards the hall._        Hoiho! Gutrune!      Haste and come!      Siegfried is here.      Why dost delay?    SIEGFRIED _Turning to the hall._        How Brünnhild' yielded      Ye shall both be told.            [_Gutrune comes from the hall to meet him._    SIEGFRIED        Give me fair greeting,      Gibich's child!  I come to thee with joyful news.    GUTRUNE        Freia greet thee      To the honour of all women!    SIEGFRIED        To thy lover glad      Be gracious;  For wife I have won thee to-day.    GUTRUNE    Comes then Brünnhild' with my brother?    SIEGFRIED    None ever wooed with more ease.    GUTRUNE    Was he not scorched by the fire?    SIEGFRIED    It had not burnt him, I trow;  But I broke through it instead,  That I for wife might win thee.    GUTRUNE    And no harm didst thou take?    SIEGFRIED    I laughed 'mid the surge of the flames.    GUTRUNE    Did Brünnhild' think thee Gunther?    SIEGFRIED    Like were we to a hair;  The Tarnhelm saw to that,  As Hagen truly foretold.    HAGEN    I gave thee counsel good.    GUTRUNE    And so the bold maid was tamed?    SIEGFRIED    Her pride--Gunther broke.    GUTRUNE    Did she give herself to thee?    SIEGFRIED    Through the night the vanquished        Brünnhild'  To her rightful husband belonged.    GUTRUNE    For her husband thou didst pass?    SIEGFRIED    By Gutrune sojourned Siegfried.    GUTRUNE    But 'twas Brünnhild' lay beside thee.    SIEGFRIED [_Pointing to his sword._    Far as north from east and west,  So far was Brünnhild' removed.    GUTRUNE    But how got Gunther his wife from thee?    SIEGFRIED    Through the flames of the fire as they faded,  When day dawned, through the mist  She followed me down the hill;      When near the shore,      None observing,  I gave Gunther my place,  And by the Tarnhelm's magic  Wished myself straight to thee.  A strong wind drives the lovers  Merrily down the Rhine;  Prepare to greet them with joy.    GUTRUNE    Siegfried! Such is thy might,  I am afraid of thee!    HAGEN [_Calling from the shore._    I can see a sail in the distance.    SIEGFRIED    Now be the envoy thanked!    GUTRUNE    Let us give her gracious greeting,  That glad and gay she here may tarry!      Thou, Hagen, prithee      Summon the men  To the hall here for the wedding,  While blithe maids  To the feast I bid;  Our joy they will merrily share.            [_As she goes towards the hall she turns round          again._    Wilt thou rest, wicked man?    SIEGFRIED    Helping thee is rest enough.            [_He gives her his hand and accompanies her into          the hall._    HAGEN            [_Has mounted a rock at the back, and starts          blowing his cow-horn._    Hoiho! Hoiho! Hoho!      Ye Gibich vassals,      Up and prepare!      Woeful tidings!      Weapons! Weapons!      Arm through the land!      Goodly weapons,      Mighty weapons      Sharp for strife!      Dire the strait!  Woe! Danger! Danger!  Hoiho! Hoiho! Hoho!            [_Hagen remains where he is on the rock. Armed men          arrive in haste by different paths; first singly,          and then in larger and larger groups._    THE VASSALS        Why sounds the horn?      Who calls us to arms?      We come with our arms?      We come with our weapons.      Hagen! Hagen!      Hoiho! Hoiho!      Who hath suffered scathe?      Say, what foe is nigh?      Who forces war?      Is Gunther sore pressed?      We come with our weapons,      With weapons keen!      Hoiho! Ho! Hagen!    HAGEN [_Still from the rock._        Come fully armed      Without delay!  Welcome Gunther, your lord:  A wife Gunther has wooed.    THE VASSALS        Is he in straits,      Pressed by the foe?    HAGEN        A woman hard won      With him he brings.    THE VASSALS        Her kinsmen and vassals      Follow for vengeance?    HAGEN        No one follows      But his bride.    THE VASSALS        Then the peril is past,      And the foe put to flight?    HAGEN        The dragon-slayer      Helped him at need;      Siegfried, the hero,      Kept him from harm.    THE VASSALS    How then can his vassals avail him?  And why hast callèd us here?    HAGEN        Sturdy oxen      Ye shall slaughter;      On Wotan's altar      Their blood be shed!    THE VASSALS    And after that, Hagen? Say, what next?    HAGEN        After that for Froh      A boar ye shall fell,      And a full-grown and strong      He-goat for Donner;      But for Fricka      Sheep ye shall slaughter,  That she may smile on the marriage!    THE VASSALS      [_With increasing cheerfulness._        What shall we do      When the beasts we have slain?    HAGEN        The drink-horn take      That women sweet      With wine and mead      Blithely have filled.    THE VASSALS        The drink-horn in hand,      What task awaits us still?    HAGEN        Gaily carouse      Until tamed by wine:  Drink, that the Gods, duly honoured,  Grace may accord to this marriage.    THE VASSALS            [_Burst into ringing laughter._        Good luck and joy      Laugh on the Rhine,      If Hagen, the grim one,      So merrily jests!      To wedding-feasts      Hagen invites;      His prick the hedge-thorn,      Hagen, has lost!    HAGEN            [_Who has remained very grave, has come down to the          men, and now stands among them._        Now cease from laughing,      Doughty vassals!  Receive Gunther's bride;  Yonder come Brünnhild' and he.            [_He points towards the Rhine. Some of the men          hurry to the height; others range themselves on the          shore to watch the arrival. Hagen goes up to some          of the men._        Be to your lady      Loyal and true;      Suffers she wrong,      Swiftly avenge her!            [_He turns slowly aside and moves towards the back.          The boat arrives with Gunther and Brünnhilde. Those          who have been looking out from the height come down          to the shore. Some vassals spring into the water      "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49525"],[0,"First Lensman (#16)"],[1,"ritical. Are you pretty sure, Jill, that Herkimer is a  key man?\"    \"Pretty sure, Pops.\" _How_ much better she felt, now that the Lensmen  were on guard! \"In this one case, at least.\"    \"Good! Then let him talk you into giving him every dance, right  straight through until something breaks. Watch him. He must know the  signal and who is going to operate, and if you can give us a fraction  of a second of warning it will help no end. Can do?\"    \"I'll say I can--and I would love to, the big, slimy, stinking  skinker!\" As transliterated into words, the girl's thought may seem a  trifle confused, but Kinnison knew exactly what she meant.    \"One more thing, Jill; a detail. The boys are coming back in and are  working their partners over this way. See if Herkimer notices that they  have changed their holsters.\"    \"No, he didn't notice,\" Jill reported, after a moment. \"But I don't  notice any difference, either, and I'm looking for it.\"    \"Nevertheless, it's there, and the difference between a Mark Seventeen  and a Mark Five is something more than that between Tweedledum and  Tweedledee,\" Kinnison returned, dryly. \"However, it may not be as  obvious to non-military personnel as it is to us. That's far enough,  boys, don't get too close. Now, Virge, keep solidly en rapport with  Jill on one side and with us on the other, so that she won't have to  give herself and the show away by yelling and pointing, and ...\"    \"But this is preposterous!\" Samms stormed.    \"Preposterous, hell,\" Roderick Kinnison's thought was still coldly  level; only the fact that he was beginning to use non-ballroom language  revealed any sign of the strain he was under. \"Stop being so goddam  heroic and start using your brain. You turned down fifty billion  credits. Why do you suppose they offered that much, when they can get  anybody killed for a hundred? And what would they do about it?\"    \"But they couldn't get away with it, Rod, at an Ambassadors' Ball. They  _couldn't_, possibly.\"    \"Formerly, no. That was my first thought, too. But it was you who  pointed out to me, not so long ago, that the techniques of crime have  changed of late. In the new light, the swankier the brawl the greater  the confusion and the better the chance of getting away clean. Comb  _that_ out of your whiskers, you red-headed mule!\"    \"Well ... there might be something in it, after all ...\" Samms' thought  showed apprehension at last.    \"You know damn well there is. But you boys--Jack and Mase  especially--loosen up. You can't do good shooting while you're strung  up like a couple of cocoons. Do something--talk to your partners or  think at Jill ...\"    \"That won't be hard, sir.\" Mason Northrop grinned feebly. \"And that  reminds me of something, Jill. Mentor certainly bracketed the target  when he--or she, or it, maybe--said that you would never need a Lens.\"    \"Huh?\" Jill demanded, inelegantly. \"I don't see the connection, if any.\"    \"No? Everybody else does, I'll bet. How about it?\" The other Lensmen,  even Samms, agreed enthusiastically. \"Well, do you think that any of  those characters, particularly Herkimer Herkimer Third, would let a  harness bull in harness--even such a beautiful one as you--get close  enough to him to do such a Davey the Dip act on his mind?\"    \"Oh ... I never thought of that, but it's right, and I'm glad ... but  Pops, you said something about 'support in force.' Have you any idea  how long it will be? I _hope_ I can hold out, with you all supporting  me, but ...\"    \"You can, Jill. Two or three minutes more, at most.\"    \"Support? In force? What do you mean?\" Samms snapped.    \"Just that. The whole damned army,\" Kinnison replied. \"I sent Two-Star  Commodore Alexander Clayton a thought that lifted him right out of his  chair. Everything he's got, at full emergency blast. Armor--mark eighty  fours--six by six extra heavies--a ninety sixty for an ambulance--full  escort, upstairs and down--way-friskers--'copters--cruisers and big  stuff--in short, the works. I would have run with you before this, if I  dared; but the minute the relief party shows up, we do a flit.\"    \"If you _dared_?\" Jill asked, shaken by the thought.    \"Exactly, my dear. I don't dare. If they start anything we'll do our  damnedest, but I'm praying they won't.\"    But Kinnison's prayers--if he made any--were ignored. Jill heard a  sharp, but very usual and insignificant sound; someone had dropped a  pencil. She felt an inconspicuous muscle twitch slightly. She saw the  almost imperceptible tensing of a neck-muscle which would have turned  Herkimer's head in a certain direction if it had been allowed to act.  Her eyes flashed along that line, searched busily for milli-seconds. A  man was reaching unobtrusively, as though for a handkerchief. But men  at Ambassadors' Balls do not carry blue handkerchiefs; nor does any  fabric, however dyed, resemble at all closely the blued steel of an  automatic pistol.    Jill would have screamed, then, and pointed; but she had time to do  neither. Through her rapport with her father the Lensmen saw everything  that she saw, in the instant of her seeing it. Hence five shots blasted  out, practically as one, before the girl could scream, or point, or  even move. She did scream, then; but since dozens of other women were  screaming, too, it made no difference--then.    Conway Costigan, trigger-nerved spacehound that he was and with years  of gun-fighting and of hand-to-hand brawling in his log, shot first;  even before the gunman did. It was Costigan's blinding speed that saved  Virgil Samms' life that day; for the would-be assassin was dying, with  a heavy slug crashing through his brain, before he finished pulling the  trigger. The dying hand twitched upward. The bullet intended for Samms'  heart went high; through the fleshy part of the shoulder.    Roderick Kinnison, because of his age, and his son and Northrop,  because of their inexperience, were a few milli-seconds slow. They,  however, were aiming for the body, not for the head; and any of those  three resulting wounds would have been satisfactorily fatal. The man  went down, and stayed down.    Samms staggered, but did not go down until the elder Kinnison, as  gently as was consistent with the maximum of speed, threw him down.    \"Stand back! Get back! Give him air!\" Men began to shout, the while  pressing closer themselves.    \"You men, stand back. Some of you go get a stretcher. You women, come  here.\" Kinnison's heavy, parade-ground voice smashed down all lesser  noises. \"Is there a doctor here?\"    There was; and, after being \"frisked\" for weapons, he went busily to  work.    \"Joy--Betty--Jill--Clio,\" Kinnison called his own wife and their  daughter, Virgilia Samms, and Mrs. Costigan. \"You four first. Now  you--and you--and you--and you....\" he went on, pointing out large,  heavy women wearing extremely extreme gowns, \"Stand here, right over  him. Cover him up, so that nobody else can get a shot at him. You other  women, stand behind and between these--closer yet--fill those spaces  up solid--there! Jack, stand there. Mase, there. Costigan, the other  end; I'll take this one. Now, everybody, listen. I know damn well that  none of you women are wearing guns above the waist, and you've all got  long skirts--thank God for ballgowns! Now, fellows, if any one of these  women makes a move to lift her skirt, blow her brains out, right then,  without waiting to ask questions.\"    \"Sir, I protest! This is outrageous!\" one of the dowagers exclaimed.    \"Madam, I agree with you fully. It is.\" Kinnison smiled as genuinely  as he could under the circumstances. \"It is, however, _necessary_. I  will apologize to all you ladies, and to you, doctor--in writing if you  like--after we have Virgil Samms aboard the _Chicago_; but until then I  would not trust my own grandmother.\"    The doctor looked up. \"The _Chicago_? This wound does not appear to be  a very serious one, but this man is going to a hospital at once. Ah,  the stretcher. So ... please ... easy ... there, that is excellent.  Call an ambulance, please, immediately.\"    \"I did. Long ago. But no hospital, doctor. All those windows--open  to the public--or the whole place bombed--by no means. I'm taking no  chances whatever.\"    \"Except with your own life!\" Jill put in sharply, looking up from her  place at her father's side. Assured that the First Lensman was in no  danger of dying, she had begun to take interest in other things. \"You  are important, too, you know, and you're standing right out there in  the open. Get another stretcher, lie down on it, and we'll guard you,  too ... and don't be too stiff-necked to take your own advice!\" she  flared, as he hesitated.    \"I'm not, if it were necessary, but it isn't. If they had killed him,  yes. I'd probably be next in line. But since he got only a scratch,  there'd be no point at all in killing even a _good_ Number Two.\"    \"A _scratch_!\" Jill fairly seethed. \"Do you call that horrible wound a  _scratch_?\"    \"Huh? Why, certainly--that's all it is--thanks to you,\" he returned,  in honest and complete surprise. \"No bones shattered--no main arteries  cut--missed the lung--he'll be as good as new in a couple of weeks.\"    \"And now,\" he went on aloud, \"if you ladies will please pick up this  stretcher we will move en masse, and _slowly_, toward the door.\"    The women, no longer indignant but apparently enjoying the sensation of  being the center of interest, complied with the request.    \"Now, boys,\" Kinnison Lensed a thought. \"Did any of you--Costigan?--see  any signs of a concerted rush, such as there would have been to get the  killer away if we hadn't interfered?\"    \"No, sir,\" came Costigan's brisk reply. \"None within sight of me.\"    \"Jack and Mase--I don't suppose you looked?\"    They hadn't--had not thought of it in time.    \"You'll learn. It takes a few things like this to make it automatic.  But I couldn't see any, either, so I'm fairly certain there wasn't any.  Smart"]]]
