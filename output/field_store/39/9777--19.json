In adults (Fig. 17 and Pl. 8) the transverse  hinge is marked by ligamentous tissue between the pectoral and  abdominal laminae; the forelobe of the plastron is distinctly narrower  than the hind lobe. Two small scales lie near the corner of the hinge  on each side. The larger and more anterior of these scales is the  axillary; it is present in box turtles of all ages. The smaller scale  (Fig. 17), to my knowledge, has never been named or mentioned in the  literature; it is herein termed the apical scale. It is a constant  feature in adults but is always lacking in hatchlings and small  juveniles. Other scales, much smaller than the axillary and apical,  occur on the ligamentous tissue of the hinge of some adults.       [Illustration: FIG. 18.

Carapace of hatchling (A-- 1A1/2),         cleared and stained to show bony structure; lateral view;         anterior end at left. (Abbreviations as in Fig. 15.)]       [Illustration: FIG. 20. Lateral view of hatchling (A-- 1); note         the lateral process of the pectoral lamina (pl) extending         posterior to the axillary scale (ax) in a position         corresponding to the apical scale of adults. There is no         external indication of the transverse hinge in young         individuals. The yolk sac of this individual has been retracted         but the umbilicus (umb) has not yet closed.]    In juveniles (Fig. 20) the pectoroabdominal seam contains no  ligamentous tissue and is like the other interlaminal seams of the  plastron. A lateral apex of the pectoral lamina projects upward behind  the axillary scale on each side, in the position occupied by the  apical scale of adults. Examination of a large series of specimens  revealed that the apical scale of adults becomes separated from the  lateral apex of the pectoral lamina at approximately the time when the  hinge becomes functional as such.    Ontogenetic changes in the shell can be summarized as follows: 1)  Buttresses become less distinct in the first two years of life  (plastral lengths of 40 to 55 mm.); 2) Interdigitating processes of  the forelobes and hind lobes become relatively shorter and wider, the  entoplastron no longer projects posterior to the hinge, the lateral  apex of the pectoral lamina becomes creased, and some movement of the  plastron can take place between the second and third years (plastral  lengths of 55 to 65 mm.); 3) Plastral lobes become freely movable upon  one another and upon the carapace by the end of the fourth year  (plastral length approximately 70 mm.) in most individuals.    The plastron of a juvenal box turtle is not completely immovable. The  bones of the shell are flexible for a time after hatching and allow  some movement of the plastron; but the relatively greater bulk of the  body in young box turtles would prevent complete closure of the shell  even if a functional hinge were present. Hatchlings can withdraw the  head and forelegs only to a line running between the anterior edges of  the shell. To do so the rear half of the shell is opened and the hind  legs are extended. When the head and forelegs are retracted to the  maximum, the elbow-joints are pressed against the tympanic region or  behind the head; the fore-limbs cannot be drawn part way across the  snout, as in adults. Hatchlings can elevate the plastron to an angle  of approximately nine degrees; the plastron of an adult, with shell  closed, is elevated about 50 degrees. Hatchlings flex the plastron  chiefly in the region of the humeropectoral seam, rather than at the  anlage of the transverse hinge.    Adult box turtles, when walking, characteristically carry the forelobe  of the plastron slightly flexed. This flexion of the plastron,  combined with its naturally up-turned anterior edge, cause it to  function in the manner of a sled runner when the turtle is moving  forward. A movable plastron, therefore, in addition to its primarily  protective function, seems to aid the turtle in traveling through tall  grass or over uneven ground. The gular scutes, on the anterior edge of  the forelobe, become worn long before other plastral laminae do.    An adult female from Richland County, Illinois, had an abnormal but  functional hinge on the humeropectoral seam in addition to a normal  hinge on the pectoroabdominal seam. The abnormal hinge resulted from a  transverse break in which ligamentous tissue later developed. The  muscles closing the plastron moved the more anterior of the two  hinges; the normal hinge was not functional.      Color and Markings    The markings of the shell change first when postnatal growth begins  and again when sexual maturity is attained. They are modified  gradually thereafter as the shell becomes worn.    In hatchlings the ground color ordinarily is dark brown but in some  individuals is paler brown or tan. Markings on the dark background are  pale yellow. Markings on the central and lateral scutes vary from a  regularly arranged series of well defined spots and a middorsal stripe  to a general scattering of small flecks. In some specimens the pale  markings of the carapace are faint or wanting. Lateral parts of  marginal scutes are always pale yellow and form a border around the  carapace.    Close examination of the carapace of any hatchling shows the following  basic arrangement of markings: each lateral scute has a centrally  placed pale spot and four to seven smaller pale marks arranged around  the edge of the scute; each central scute has a central, longitudinal  mark and several (usually two, four, or six) smaller pale marks  arranged around the edge of the scute, chiefly the lateral edges (Pl.  23). Variations in pattern result when some or all of the markings  divide into two or more parts.    By the end of the first full season of growth, the markings have a  radial pattern. At this stage, the markings of the areola, with the  exception of the central spot, are obscure. The radial marks, sharply  defined and straight-sided, appear only on the newly formed parts of  the epidermal laminae. Each radial mark originates opposite one of the  peripheral marks of the areola. Other radial marks are developed later  by bifurcation of the original radiations.    The ground color of the plastron of hatchlings is cream-yellow, or  less often, bright yellow. The solid, dark brown markings on the  medial part of each lamina form a central dark area that contrasts  sharply with the pale background (Pl. 24). The soft tissue of the  navel is pale yellow or cream; when the navel closes, the dark  central mark of the plastron is unbroken except for thin, pale lines  along the interlaminal seams.    When growth begins, the areas of newly formed epidermal tissue on the  anterior and medial borders of each areolar scute are pale. Wide, dark  radial marks, usually three per scute, appear on the newly formed  tissue. Subsequently, finer dark radiations appear between the three  original radiations. The wide radiations later bifurcate. By the time  adult or subadult size is reached, the plastron appears to have a  pattern of pale radiations on a _dark_ background. In general, the  markings of the plastron are less sharply defined than the markings of  the carapace (Pl. 24).    There is a tendency for the dark markings of the plastron to encroach  on the lighter markings, if no wear on the shell occurs. However, as  the plastron becomes worn, the pale areas become more extensive and  the dark markings become broken and rounded. Severely worn plastra of  some old individuals lack dark markings. Wear on the carapace produces  the same general effect; but markings of the carapace, although they  may become blotched, are never obliterated in _Terrapene o. ornata_.    The top of the head in most hatchlings is dark brown, approximately  the same shade as the ground color of the carapace; the part anterior  to the eyes is usually unmarked but a few individuals have a  semicircle of small pale spots over each eye or similar spots on much  of the head. The posterior part of the head is ordinarily flecked with  yellow. The skin on the top of the head, particularly between the  eyes, is roughened. The granular skin of the neck is grayish brown to  cream-yellow. There are one or two large pale spots behind the eye and  another pale spot at the corner of the mouth. Smaller, irregularly  arranged pale markings on the necks of some specimens form, with the  post-orbital and post-rictal spots, one or two short, ragged stripes.  The gular region is pale.    In juveniles, the yellow markings of the head and neck are larger and  contrast more sharply with the dark ground color than in hatchlings.  Markings above the eyes, if present, fuse to form two pale,  semicircular stripes. In some older juveniles yellow marks on top of  the head blend with the dark background to produce an amber color. The  top of the neck darkens or develops blotches of darker color that  produce a mottled effect. Spots and stripes on the side of the neck  remain well defined. The skin on top of the head becomes smooth and  shiny.    Adult females tend to retain the color and pattern of juveniles on the  head and neck although slight"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37595"],[0,"Ecological Studies of the Timber Wolf in Northeastern Minnesota (#16)"],[1," The discovery that 13 percent of the fawns and 84 percent of the  yearlings killed during January, February, and March had not yet shed  their deciduous incisors and premolars, respectively, also fits well  with the rest of our information. Evidently some unusual factor had  caused the delay in tooth development and replacement. One possibility  is that the animals were born in August or September, much later than  normal. Although most deer in Minnesota are born in May and June, there  are records of births in July and August. In addition, a fetus 181 to  200 days old was found in a doe killed on September 26 (Erickson _et  al._ 1961).    An alternate explanation for the delay in tooth replacement  is that the animals were suffering from malnutrition or nutrient  deficiency. Severinghaus[35] has evidence that yearling bucks that have  not replaced their deciduous premolars during November, and thus are  aged at 17 months (Severinghaus 1949), generally have shorter, narrower  antlers and fewer points than 18-and 19-month-old individuals. Degree  of antler development in turn is considered related to nutritional  state (Latham 1950). Thus it is reasonable to conclude that animals  behind in tooth development and replacement, whether this is caused by  age or diet, are physiologically inferior.    Most of the abnormal conditions discussed above pertain to the skeletal  parts of wolf-kills. If the soft parts of a large number of kills could  be examined thoroughly, one might discover a much higher incidence of  diseases and other pathological conditions.    In conclusion, our data on both age and condition of wolf-killed deer  show that at least during winter, wolves in our study area usually do  not kill just any deer they discover, although they do try to.  Evidently, most deer can usually escape wolf predation. The most  frequent exceptions are those 5-1/2 years old and older, those born  late, those suffering from poor nutrition, those with abnormalities or  pathological conditions, and possibly fawns.    The above conclusions parallel those of Murie (1944), Crisler (1956),  Mech (1966a), and Pimlott _et al._ (1969) for wolves preying on Dall  sheep, caribou, moose, and deer respectively, and further substantiate  the claim by Mech (1970) that they can be extended to wolves preying on  most, if not all, species of large mammals under most conditions. It is  also apparent from the data presented above that deer over 5 years of  age and those with abnormalities of the jaw or lower limbs represent  such a small percentage of the total population that they are seldom  taken by human hunters. In this respect, competition between timber  wolves and human hunters appears to be minimal in the study area.    FOOTNOTES:    [35] _C. W. Severinghaus. Unpublished data_.

Deer killed by wolves were significantly  older. Statistical comparisons also showed the following: (1) hunters  generally killed an even sex ratio of fawns, and a disproportionate  number of adult bucks, (2) wolves took a higher percentage of female  fawns than female adults, a disproportionate number of bucks in the  wilderness area, and a higher percentage of does in the hunted area.  The latter fact evidently reflects the higher hunter success on males  in the hunted area. Significantly higher incidences of abnormalities  and pathological conditions of both mandibles and lower limbs were  found in wolf-killed deer than in hunter-killed deer, and these  conditions are described. It is concluded that wolf predation on  white-tailed deer in the study area during winter generally is  selective in that it tends to remove members of the prey population  that are old, debilitated, or abnormal. Apparently these classes of  deer represent such a small percentage of the population that they are  seldom taken by human hunters.      ACKNOWLEDGMENTS    This study was supported by Macalester College, the New York Zoological  Society, the Minnesota Department of Conservation, the USDA Forest  Service, and the U.S. Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife. Pilots  Robert Hodge, Pat Magie, John Winship, Jack Burgess, Don Murray, and  Walt Neumann aided substantially in obtaining jaws from wolf-killed  deer. Students from the Macalester College Biology Department and  personnel of the USDA Forest Service and the Minnesota Department of  Conservation helped secure mandibles from both wolf-killed and  hunter-killed deer. The interest of Mr. John E. Peninger and of many  deer hunters in contributing the jaws is also greatly acknowledged.    Mr. David W. Kuehn sectioned the incisors of the deer jaws and  determined their ages. Dr. Donald M. Barnes of the University of  Minnesota Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory examined the abnormal lower  limbs, described their pathology, and provided photos of specimens used  herein.    Mr. Wallace C. Dayton and Miss Elizabeth Dayton and the  Quetico-Superior Foundation, all of Minneapolis, financed Mech during  the preparation of this paper.

THE EFFECT OF SNOW CONDITIONS ON THE VULNERABILITY OF WHITE-TAILED  DEER TO WOLF PREDATION    L. David Mech, L. D. Frenzel, Jr., and P. D. Karns      Wolves (_Canis lupus_) and deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_) having  evolved together, no doubt have become adapted to contending with each  other's physical abilities. Thus it is not surprising to learn that  deer which succumb to wolf predation are generally weaker, older, or  abnormal compared with the total deer population (Pimlott _et al._  1969, also see Mech and Frenzel, p. 35).    However, the structural and behavioral adaptations of both species must  have evolved under environmental conditions that are average or usual;  otherwise, an adjustment of wolf to deer populations, and vice versa,  could not have been maintained over long periods. This implies that  extreme or unusual conditions might sometimes occur, to which either  the wolf or the deer is poorly adapted.    One of the most important environmental factors that can influence the  interactions of wolves and deer is snow. The total fall, depth on the  ground, and the density are all aspects of snow that may vary  considerably and affect the ability"]]]
