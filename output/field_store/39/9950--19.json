Knowing that all those brackets  must be changed immediately, Dohong was left to destroy them;  which he did, promptly and joyfully. We then made heavy  brackets of flat wrought iron bars, 1/2 by 21/2 inches, unbreakable  even with a lever. These were screwed on with screws  so large and heavy that our carpenters knew they were quite  secure.    [Illustration caption: THE LEVER THAT OUR ORANG-UTAN INVENTED, AND  THE WAY HE APPLIED IT By W. A. Camadeo, in the \"Scientific  American,\" 1907]    In due time, Dohong tested his lever upon the bars with their new  brackets, and at first they held securely. Then he engaged Polly,  his chimpanzee companion, to assist him to the limit of her  strength. While Dohong pulled on the lever, Polly braced her  absurd little back against the wall, and pushed upon it, with all  her strength. At first nothing gave way. The combined strength  exerted by the three brackets was not to be overcome by prying at  the horizontal bar itself. It was then that Dohong's inventive  genius rose to its climax. He decided to attack the brackets  singly, and conquer them one by one. On examining the situation  very critically, he found that each bracket consisted of a right-  angled triangle of wrought iron, with its perpendicular side  against the wall, its base uppermost, and its hypotenuse out in  the air. Through the open centre of the triangle he introduced the  end of his trapeze bar, chain and all, as far as it would go, then  gave a mighty heave. The end of his lever was against the wall,  and the power was applied in such a manner that few machine screws  could stand so great a strain. One by one, the screws were torn  out of the wood, and finally each bracket worked upon was torn  off.    But there was one exception. The screws of one bracket were so  firmly set in a particularly hard strip of the upright tongued-  and-grooved yellow pine flooring that formed the wall, the board  itself was finally torn out, full length! The board was four  inches wide, seven-eighths of an inch thick, and seven feet long.  Originally it was so firmly nailed that no one believed that it  could be torn from its place. [Footnote: In the Winter of 1921  about a dozen newspapers in the United States published a  sensational syndicated article, occupying an entire page, in which  all of Dohong's lever discovery and cage-wrecking performances  were reported as of recent occurrence, and credited to a stupid  and uninteresting young orang called Gabong, now in the Zoological  Park, that has not even the merit of sufficient intelligence to  maintain a proper state of bodily uprightness, let alone the  invention of mechanical principles.]    Without delay, Dohong started in with his lever to pry off the  remaining boards of the wall, but this movement was promptly  checked. Our next task consisted in making long bolts by which the  brackets of the horizontal bars were bolted entirely through the  partition walls and held so powerfully on the other side that even  the lever could not wreck them.    As soon as the brackets were made secure, Dohong turned his  attention to the two large sleeping boxes which were built very  solidly on the balcony of his cage. Both of those structures he  tore completely to pieces,--always working with the utmost good  nature and cheerfulness. Realizing that they could not exist in  the cage with him, we gave him a permit to tear them out--and save  the time of the carpenters.    Dohong's use of his lever was seen by hundreds of visitors, and  one frequent visitor to the Park, Mr. L. A. Camacho, an engineer,  was so much impressed that he published in the _Scientific  American_ an illustrated account of what he saw.    For a long period, Dohong had been more or less annoyed by the  fact that he could not get his head out between the front bars of  his cage, and look around the partition into the home of his next-  door neighbor. Very soon after he discovered the use of the lever,  he swung his trapeze bar out to the upper corner of his cage,  thrust the end of it out between the first bar and the steel  column of the partition, and very deftly bent two of the iron bars  outward far enough so that he could easily thrust his head outside  and have his coveted look.    One of our later and largest orangs made a specialty of twisting  the straw of his bedding into a rope six or seven feet long, then  throwing it over his trapeze bar and swinging by it, forward and  back.    Time and space will not permit the enumeration of the various  things done by that ape of mechanical mind with his swinging rope  and his trapeze, with ropes of straw _twisted by himself,_  with keys, locks, hammer, nails and boxes. Any man who can witness  such manifestations as those described above, and deny the  existence in the animal of an ability to reason from cause to  effect, must be prepared to deny the evidence of his own senses.    The individual variations between orangs, as also between  chimpanzees, are great and striking. It may with truth be said  that no two individuals of either species are really quite alike  in physiognomy, temperament and mental capacity. As subjects for  the experimental psychologist, it is difficult to see how any  other could be found that would be even a good second in living  interest to the great apes. The facts thus far recorded, so I  believe, present only a suggestion of the rich results that await  the patient scientific investigator. In the year 1915 Dr. Robert  M. Yerkes, of Harvard University, conducted at Montecito,  southern California, in a comfortable primate laboratory, six  months of continuous and diligent experiments on the behavior of  orang-utans and monkeys. His report, published under the title of  \"The Mental Life of Monkeys and Apes: A Study of Ideational  Behavior,\" is a document of much interest and value. Dr. Yerkes'  use of the orang-utan as a subject was a decided step forward in  the study of \"animal behavior\" in America.          IX    THE MAN-LIKENESS OF THE CHIMPANZEE      During the past twenty years, millions of thinking people have  been startled, and not a few shocked, by the amazing and uncanny  human-likeness of the performances of trained chimpanzees on the  theatrical stage. Really, when a well trained \"chimp\" is dressed  from head to foot like a man, and is seen going with quickness,  precision and spirit through a performance half an hour in length,  we go away from it with an uncomfortable feeling that speech is  all that he lacks of being a citizen.    In 1904 the American public saw Esau. Next came Consul,--in about  three or four separate editions! In 1909 we had Peter. Then came I  know not how many more, including the giant Casey and Mr. Garner's  Susie; and finally in 1918 our own Suzette. The theatre-going  public has been well supplied with trained chimpanzees, and the  mental capacity of that species is now more widely known and  appreciated than that of any other wild animal except the Indian  elephant.    There are several reasons why chimpanzees predominate on the  stage, and why so few performing orang-utans have been seen. They  are as follows:    1. The orang is sanguine, and slower in execution than the nervous  chimpanzee.    2. The feet of the orang are not good for shoes, and biped work.    3. The orang is rather awkward with its hands, and finally,    4. There are fully twice as many chimps in the market.    But the chimpanzee has certain drawbacks of his own. His nervous  temper and his forced-draught activities soon wear him out. If he  survives to see his sixth or seventh year, it is then that he  becomes so strong and so full of ego that he becomes dangerous and  requires to be retired.    Bright minds are more common among the chimpanzee species than  among the orangs. Three chimps out of every five are good for  training, but not more than two orangs out of five can be  satisfactorily developed.    Some sensitive minds shrink from the idea that man has \"descended\"  from the apes. I never for a moment shared that feeling. I would  rather descend from a clean, capable and bright-minded genus of  apes than from any unclean, ignorant and repulsive race of the  genus _Homo._ In comparing the chimpanzees of Fernan Vaz  with the Canoe Indians of the Strait of Magellan and other human  tribes we could name, I think the former have decidedly the best  of it. There are millions of members of the human race who are  more loathsome and repulsive than wild apes.    The face of the chimpanzee is highly mobile, and the mouth, lips,  eyes and voice express the various emotions of the individual  with a degree of clearness and precision second only to the facial  expression of man himself. In fact, the face of an intelligent  chimpanzee or orang-utan is a fairly constant index of the state  of mind of the individual. In their turn, those enormously  expansive lips and keen brown eyes express contentment, doubt,  fear and terror; affection, disapproval, jealousy, anger, rage;  hunger and satiety; lonesomeness and illness.    The lips of the chimpanzee afford that animal several perfectly  distinct expressions of the individual's mind and feelings. While  it is not possible to offer a description of each which will  certainly be recognizable to the reader, the two extremes will at  least be appreciated. When coaxing for food, or attention, the  lips are thrust far out beyond the teeth, and formed into a funnel  with the small end outermost. When the chimpanzee flies into a  rage at some real or fancied offense, the snarling lips are drawn  back, and far up and down, until the teeth and gums are fully  exposed in a ghastly threat of attack. At the same time, the voice  gives forth shrill shrieks of rage, correctly represented by the  syllable \"Ee-ee-ee!\", prolonged, and repeated with great force,  three or four times. On such occasions "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60708"],[0,"History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Volume 4 (#16)"],[1,"orry, for said he, \"The work of      destruction must now begin.\" No sooner said than it was done. The      printing office, a two story brick building, was assailed by the      mob and torn down, and, with its valuable appurtenances, destroyed.      They next proceeded to the store with a like purpose. Its owner      in part, Mr. Gilbert, agreed to close it, and they delayed their      purpose.        They then proceeded to the dwelling of Mr. Partridge, the beloved      Bishop of the Church there, dragged him and his family to the      public square, where, surrounded by hundreds, they partly stripped      him of his clothing, and tarred and feathered him from head to      foot. A man by the name of Allen was at the same time treated in a      similar manner. The mob then dispersed with an agreement to meet      again on the next Tuesday, the above outrages having been committed      on Saturday.        Tuesday came, and with it came the mob, bearing a red flag, in      token of _blood_. They proceeded to the houses of Isaac Morley,      and others of the leading men, and seized them, telling them to      bid their families farewell, that they would never see them again.      They were then driven at the point of the bayonet to the jail, and      there, amid the jeers and {26} insults of the crowd, they were      thrust into prison, to be kept as hostages; in case any of the mob      should be killed, they were to die to pay for it. Here some two or      three of the \"Mormons\" offered to surrender up their lives, if that      would satisfy the fury of the mob, and purchase peace and security      for their unoffending brethren, their helpless wives and children.      The reply of the mob was, that the \"Mormons\" must leave the county      _en masse_, or that every man should be put to death.        The \"Mormons,\" terrified and defenseless, then entered into an      agreement to leave the county--one half by the first of January,      the other half by the first of April next ensuing. This treaty      being made and ratified, the mob dispersed. Again, for a time, the      persecuted \"Mormons\" enjoyed a respite from their persecutions; but      not long was the repose permitted them.        Some time in the month of October, a meeting was held at      Independence, at which it was determined to remove the \"Mormons\" or      die. Inflammatory speeches were made, and one of the speakers swore      he would remove the \"Mormons\" from the county if he had to wade up      to his neck in blood.        Be it remarked that up to this time, the \"Mormons\" had faithfully      observed the treaty, and were guilty of no offense against the      laws of the land, or of society, but were peaceably following the      routine of their daily duties.        Shortly after the meeting above referred to, another persecution      commenced; some of the \"Mormons\" were shot at, others were whipped,      their houses were assailed with brickbats, broken open, and thrown      down; their women and children were insulted; and thus for many      weeks, without offense, without resistance, by night and by day,      were they harassed, insulted, and oppressed.        There is a point beyond which endurance ceases to be a virtue. The      worm when trampled upon will turn upon its oppressor. A company      of about thirty \"Mormons\" fell in with twice that number of the      mob engaged in the destruction of \"Mormon\" property, when a battle      ensued, in which one \"Mormon\" was killed, and two or three of      the mob; acting in concert with the officer who commanded the      mob, was Lilburn W. Boggs, Lieutenant-Governor of the state of      Missouri. When the noise of the battle was spread abroad, the      public mind became much inflamed. The militia collected in arms      from all quarters, and in great numbers, inflamed to fury. They      demanded that the \"Mormons\" should surrender up all their arms, and      immediately quit the county. Compelled by overpowering numbers, the      \"Mormons\" submitted. They surrendered up fifty-one guns, which have      never been returned, or paid for.        The next day, parties of the mob went from house to house, {27}      threatening women and children with death, if they did not      immediately leave their homes. Imagination cannot paint the      terror which now pervaded the \"Mormon\" community. The weather was      intensely cold, and women and children abandoned their homes and      fled in every direction without sufficient clothing to protect them      from the piercing cold. Women gave birth to children in the woods      and on the prairies. One hundred and twenty women and children, for      the space of ten days, with only three or four men in the company,      concealed themselves in the woods in hourly expectation and fear of      massacre, until they finally escaped into Clay county. The society      of \"Mormons\" after the above disturbances, removed to the county of      Clay, where they were kindly received by the inhabitants, and their      wants administered to by their charity.        In the meantime the houses of the \"Mormons\" in the county of      Jackson, amounting to about two hundred, were burned down or      otherwise destroyed by the mob, as well as much of their crops,      furniture, and stock.        The damage done to the property of the \"Mormons\" by the mob in the      county of Jackson as above related, as near as they can ascertain,      would amount to the sum of one hundred and seventy-five thousand      dollars. The number of \"Mormons\" thus driven from the county of      Jackson amounted to about twelve hundred souls. For the property      thus destroyed they have never been paid.        After the expulsion of the \"Mormons\" from the county of Jackson      as above related, they removed to and settled in the county of      Clay. They there purchased out some of the former inhabitants,      and entered at the land office wild lands offered for sale by the      General Government. The most of them became freeholders, owning      each an eighty or more of land.        The \"Mormons\" lived peaceably in the county of Clay for about      three years, and all that time increased rapidly in numbers, by      emigration, and also in wealth by their industry. After they      had resided in that county about three years, the citizens not      connected with them began to look upon them with jealousy and      alarm. Reports were again put in circulation against them: public      meetings were held in the counties of Clay and Jackson, at which      violent resolutions were passed against the \"Mormons,\" and rumors      of mobs began again to spread alarm among the \"Mormons.\" At this      juncture the \"Mormons\" desirous of avoiding all conflict with their      fellow-citizens, and anxious to preserve the peace and harmony      of the society around them, as well as their own, deputized a      committee of their leading men to make terms of peace with their      fellow-citizens of Clay county. An interview took place between      them and a committee of citizens, at which it was agreed that      {28} the \"Mormons\" should leave the county of Clay, and that the      citizens of Clay county should buy their lands.        These terms were complied with. The \"Mormons\" removed to and      settled in the county of Caldwell, and the citizens never paid them      value for their lands. Many received nothing at all for their land.      The \"Mormons,\" by this removal, sacrificed much both of money and      feeling, but the sacrifice was made upon the altar of duty, for the      peace of the community.        Your Memorialists would beg here to give what they believe a just      explanation of the causes of the prejudice and persecution against      the \"Mormons\" related above, and which will follow. That there      might have been some unworthy members among them, cannot be denied;      but many aver that as a community they were as moral, as upright,      and as observant of the laws of the land as any body of people in      the world. Why then this prejudice and persecution? An answer they      trust will be found in the fact that they were a body of people      distinct from their fellow-citizens, in religious opinions, in      their habits, and in their associations. They were numerous enough      to make the power of their numerical and moral force a matter of      anxiety and dread to the political and religious parties by which      they were surrounded; which arose not from what the \"Mormons\" had      done, but from the fear of what they might do.        In addition, the \"Mormons\" have purchased of the settlers, or of      the Government, or obtained by pre-emption, the best lands in all      those regions of the state; and at the times of speculation, the      cupidity of many was aroused to possess those lands by driving off      the \"Mormons,\" and taking forcible possession, or constraining them      to sell, through fear and coercion, at a price merely nominal.        After the \"Mormons\" removed from Clay county, they settled in the      county of Caldwell as aforesaid.        Your Memorialists do not deem it necessary for their purpose, to      detail the history of the progress, the cares, and anxieties of the      \"Mormons,\" from the time they settled in Caldwell in the year 1836      until the fall of the year 1838. They would, however, state, that      during all that time they deported themselves as good citizens,      obeying the laws of the land, and the moral and religious duties      enjoined by their faith. That there might have been some faithless      among the faithful is possible. They would not deny that there      might have been some who were a scandal to their brethren; and what      society, they would ask, has not some unworthy members? Where is      the sect, where the community, in which there cannot be found some      who trample under foot the laws of God"]]]
