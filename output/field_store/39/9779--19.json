But more was the loss of  our men to the number almost of a hundred souls.\" So wrote Master  Edward Hay who commanded the Golden Hind, and who afterwards wrote  the story of the expedition.    After this \"heavy chance\" the two ships that remained beat up and  down tacking with the wind, Sir Humphrey hoping always that the  weather would clear up and allow him once more to get near land.  But day by day passed.  The wind and waves continued as stormy as  ever, and no glimpse of land did the weary sailors catch.    It was bitterly cold, food was growing scarce, and day by day the  men lost courage.  At length they prayed Sir Humphrey to leave his  search and return homeward.  Sir Humphrey had no wish to go, but  seeing his men shivering and hungry he felt sorry for them, and  resolved to do as they wished.    \"Be content,\" he said. \"We have seen enough.  If God send us safe  home we will set forth again next spring.\"    So the course was changed, and the ships turned eastward. \"The  wind was large for England,\" says Hay, \"but very high, and the sea,  rough.\" It was so rough that the Squirrel in which Sir Humphrey  sailed was almost swallowed up.  For the Squirrel was only a tiny  frigate of ten tons.  And seeing it battered to and fro, and in  danger of sinking every moment, the captain of the Golden Hind and  many others prayed Sir Humphrey to leave it and come aboard their  boat.  But Sir Humphrey would not.    \"I will not forsake my little company going homeward,' he said.  \"For I have passed through many storms and perils with them.\"    No persuasions could move him, so the captain of the Golden Hind  was fain to let him have his way.  One afternoon in September those  in the Golden Hind watched the little Squirrel anxiously as it  tossed up and down among the waves.  But Sir Humphrey seemed not a  whit disturbed.  He sat in the stern calmly reading.  And seeing the  anxious faces of his friends he cheerfully waved his hand to them.    \"We are as near to heaven by sea as by land,\" he called, through  the roar of waves.    Then the sun went down.  Darkness fell over the wild sea, and  the ships could only know each other's whereabouts by the tossing  lights.    Suddenly to the men on the Golden Hind it seemed as if the lights  of the little frigate went out.  Immediately the watch cried out  that the frigate was lost.    \"It was too true.  For in that moment the frigate was devoured and  swallowed up by the sea.\"    Yet the men on the Golden Hind would not give up hope.  All that night  they kept watch, straining their eyes through the stormy darkness  in the hope of catching sight of the frigate or of some of its  crew.  But morning came and there was no sign of it on all the wide  waste of waters.  Still they hoped, and all the way to England they  hailed every small sail which came in sight, trusting still that  it might be the Squirrel.  But it never appeared.  Of the five ships  which set forth only the Golden Hind returned to tell the tale.  And thus ended the first attempt to found an English colony in the  New World.    __________            Chapter 12 - About Sir Walter Raleigh's Adventures in the Golden  West          The first attempt to found an English colony in America had been  an utter failure.  But the idea of founding a New England across  the seas had now taken hold of Sir Humphrey's young step-brother,  Walter Raleigh.  And a few months after the return of the Golden  Hind he received from the Queen a charter very much the same as his  brother's.  But although he got the Charter Raleigh himself could  not sail to America, for Queen Elizabeth would not let him go.  So  again he had to content himself with sending other people.    It was on April 27th, 1584, that his expedition set out in two  small ships.  Raleigh knew some of the great Frenchmen of the day,  and had heard of their attempt to found a colony in Florida.  And  in spite of the terrible fate of the Frenchmen he thought Florida  would be an excellent place to found an English colony.    So Raleigh's ships made their way to Florida, and landed on Roanoke  Island off the coast of what is now North Carolina.  In those days  of course there was no Carolina, and the Spaniards called the whole  coast Florida right up to the shores of Newfoundland.    The Englishmen were delighted with Roanoke.  It seemed to them a  fertile, pleasant land, \"the most plentiful, sweete, fruitfull and  wholesome of all the worlde.\" So they at once took possession of  it \"in the right of the Queen's most excellent Majesty as rightful  Queen and Princess of the same.\"    The natives, too, seemed friendly \"and in their behaviour as  mannerly and civil as any man of Europe.\" But the Pale-faces and  the Redskins found it difficult to understand each other.    \"What do you call this country?\" asked an Englishman.    \"Win gan da coa,\" answered the Indian.    So the Englishmen went home to tell of the wonderful country of  Wingandacoe.  But what the Indian had really said was \"What fine  clothes you have!\"    However, the mistake did not matter much.  For the Englishmen now  changed the name of the land from whatever it had been to Virginia  in honour of their Queen.    This first expedition to Roanoke was only for exploring, and after  a little the adventurers sailed home again to tell of all that they  had seen.  But Raleigh was so pleased with the report of Roanoke  Island which they brought home, to him that he at once began to  make plans for founding a colony there.  And the following April  his ships, were ready and the expedition set out under his cousin,  Sir Richard Grenville.    But now almost as soon as they landed troubles began with the  Indians.  One of them stole a silver cup, and as it was not returned  the Englishmen in anger set fire to the corn-fields and destroyed  them.  This was a bad beginning.  But the Englishmen had no knowledge  yet of how cruel and revengeful the Redman could be.  So it was with  no misgivings that Sir Richard left a colony of over a hundred men  in the country.  And promising to return with fresh supplies in the  following spring he sailed homeward.    The Governor of this colony was named Ralph Lane.  He was wise  and able, but he was soon beset with difficulties.  He found that  the place chosen for a colony was not a good one, For the harbour  was bad, the coast dangerous, and many of the Indians were now  unfriendly.  So he set about exploring the country, and decided as  soon as fresh supplies came from England to move to a better spot.    Spring came and passed, and no ships from England appeared.  The men  began to starve.  And seeing this the Indians who had feared them  before, now began to be scornful and taunt them.    \"Your God is not a true god,\" they said, \"or he would not leave  you to starve.\"    They refused to sell the colonists food no matter what price was  offered.  Their hatred of the English was so great indeed that they  resolved to sow no corn in order that there should be no harvest;  being ready to suffer hunger themselves if they might destroy the  colony utterly.    As the days passed the Englishmen daily felt the pinch of hunger  more and more.  Then Lane divided his company into three, and sent  each in a different direction so that they might gather roots and  herbs and catch fish for themselves, and also keep a lookout for  ships.    But things went from bad to worse; the savages grew daily bolder  and more insolent, and the colonists lived constantly in dread of  an attack from them.    At length, although he had tried hard to avoid it, Lane was forced  to fight them.  They were easily overcome, and fled to the woods.  But  Lane knew well that his advantage was only for the moment.  Should  help not come the colony would be wiped out.  Then one day, about a  week after the fight with the Indians, news was brought to Lane that  a great fleet of twenty-three ships had appeared in the distance.    Were they friends, or were they foes? That was the great question.  The English knew the terrible story of Fort Caroline.  Were these  Spanish ships? Fearing that they might be Ralph Lane looked to  his defenses, and made ready to withstand the enemy, if enemy they  proved to be, as bravely as might be.    But soon it was seen that their fears were needless, the ships  were English, and two days later Sir Francis Drake anchored in the  wretched little harbour.    Drake had not come on purpose to relieve the colony.  He had been  out on one of his marauding expeditions against the Spaniards.  He  had taken and sacked St.  Domingo, Cartagena, and Fort St.  Augustine.  And now, sailing home in triumph, chance had brought him to Raleigh's  colony at Roanoke.  And when he saw the miserable condition of the  colonists, and heard the tale of their hardships, he offered to take  them all home to England.  Or, he said, if they chose to remain he  would leave them a ship and food and everything that was necessary  to keep them from want until help should come.    Both Lane and his chief officers who were men of spirit wanted to  stay.  So they accepted Drake's offer of the loan of a ship, agreeing  that after they had found a good place for a colony and a better  harbour, they would go home to England and return again the next  year.    Thus the matter was settled.  Drake began to put provisions on board  one of his ships for the use of the colony.  The colonists on their  side began writing letters to send home with Drake's ships.  All  was business and excitement.  But in the midst of it a great storm  arose.  It lasted for four days and was so violent that most of  Drake's ships were forced to put out to sea lest they should be  dashed to pieces upon the shore.

Innumerable foreigners of  distinction had thronged France since the peace. He had observed  with what eagerness the populace had followed these foreigners,  gazing with delight upon their gay decorations The court-yard of  the Tuileries was ever crowded when these illustrious strangers  arrived and departed. Napoleon, in his council, where he was always  eloquent and powerful, thus urged his views:    \"Look at these vanities, which genius pretends so much to disdain.  The populace is not of that opinion. It loves these many-colored  ribbons, as it loves religious pomp. The democrat philosopher calls  it vanity. Vanity let it be. But that vanity is a weakness common  to the whole human race, and great virtues may be made to spring  from it. With these so much despised baubles heroes are made. There  must be worship for the religious sentiment. There must be visible  distinctions for the noble sentiment of glory. Nations should not  strive to be singular any more than individuals. The affectation  of acting differently from the rest of the world, is an affectation  which is reproved by all persons of sense and modesty. Ribbons are  in use in all countries. Let them be in use in France. It will be  one more friendly relation established with Europe. Our neighbors  give them only to the man of noble birth. I will give them to the  man of merit--to the one who shall have served best in the army or  in the state, or who shall have produced the finest works.\"    It was objected that the institution of the Legion of Honor was  a return to the aristocracy which the revolution had abolished.  \"What is there aristocratic,\" Napoleon exclaimed, \"in a distinction  purely personal, and merely for life, bestowed on the man who has  displayed merit, whether evil or military--bestowed on him alone,  bestowed for his life only, and not passing to his children. Such  a distinction is the reverse of aristocratic. It is the essence of  aristocracy that its titles are transmitted from the man who has  earned them, to the son who possesses no merit. The ancient regime,  so battered by the ram revolution, is more entire than is believed.  All the emigrants hold each other by the hand. The Vendeeans are  secretly enrolled. The priests, at heart, are not very friendly  to us. With the words 'legitimate king,' thousands might be roused  to arms. It is needful that the men who have taken part in the  revolution should have a bond of union, and cease to depend on the  first accident which might strike one single head. For ten years we  have only been making ruins. We must now found an edifice. Depend  upon it, the struggle is not over with Europe. Be assured that  struggle will begin again\"    It was then urged by some, that the Legion of Honor should be  confined entirely to military merit. \"By no means,\" said Napoleon,  \"Rewards are not to be conferred upon soldiers alone. All sorts of  merit are brothers. The courage of the President of the Convention,  resisting the populace, should compared with the courage of Kleber,  mounting to the assault of Acre. It is right that civil virtues  should have their reward, as well as military virtues. Those who  oppose this course, reason like barbarians. It is the religion  of brute force they commend to us. Intelligence has its rights  before those of force. Force, without intelligence, is nothing. In  barbarous ages, the man of stoutest sinews was the chieftain. Now  the general is the most intelligent of the brave. At Cairo, the  Egyptians could not comprehend how it was that Kleber, with his  majestic form, was not commander-in-chief. When Mourad Bey had  carefully observed our tactics, he could comprehend how it was that  I, and no other, ought to be the general of an army so conducted.  You reason like the Egyptians, when you attempt to confine rewards  to military valor. The soldiers reason better than you. Go to their  bivouacs; listen to them. Do you imagine that it is the tallest  of their officers, and the most imposing by his stature, for whom  they feel the highest regard! Do you imagine even that the bravest  stands first in their esteem. No doubt they would despise the man  whose courage they suspected; but they rank above the merely brave  man him who they consider the most intelligent. As for myself, do  you suppose that it is solely because I am reputed a great general  that I rule France! No! It is because the qualities of a statesman  and a magistrate are attributed to me. France will never tolerate  the government of the sword. Those who think so are strangely  mistaken. It would require an abject servitude of fifty years  before that could be the case. France is too noble, too intelligent  a country to submit to material power. Let us honor intelligence,  virtue, the civil qualities; in short let us bestow upon them, in  all profession, the like reward.\"    The true spirit of republicanism is certainly equality of rights, not  of attainments and honors; the abolition of hereditary distinctions  and privileges, not of those which are founded upon merit. The  badge of the Legion of Honor was to be conferred upon all who, by  genius, self-denial, and toil, had won renown. The prizes were open  to the humblest peasant in the land. Still the popular hostility  to any institution which bore a resemblance to the aristocracy of  the ancient nobility was so strong, that though a majority voted  in favor of the measure, there was a strong opposition. Napoleon  was surprised. He said to Bourrienne: \"You are right. Prejudices  are still against me. I ought to have waited. There was no occasion  for haste in bringing it forward. But the thing is done; and you  will soon find that the taste for these distinctions is not yet  gone by. It is a taste which belongs to the nature of man. You will  see that extraordinary results will arise from it.\"    The order was consist of six thousand members. It was constituted  in four ranks: grand officers, commanders, officers, and private  legionaries. The badge was simply a red ribbon, in the button-hole.  To the first rank, there was allotted an annual salary of $1000;  to the second $400; to the third, $200; to the fourth, $50. The  private soldier, the retired scholar, and the skillful artist were  thus decorated with the same badge of distinction which figured upon  the breast of generals, nobles and monarchs. That this institution  was peculiarly adapted to the state of France, is evident from  the fact, that it has survived all the revolutions of subsequent  years. \"Though of such recent origin,\" says Theirs, \"it is already  consecrated as if it had passed through centuries; to such a degree  has it become the recompense of heroism, of knowledge, of merit of  every kind--so much have its honors been coveted by the grandees  and the princes of Europe the most proud of their origin.\"    The popularity of Napoleon was now unbounded. A very general and  earnest disposition was expressed to confer upon the First Consul  a magnificent testimonial of the national gratitude--a testimonial  worthy of the illustrious man who was to receive it, and of the  powerful nation by which it was to be bestowed. The President of  the Tribunal thus addressed that body: \"Among all nations public  honors have been decreed to men who, by splendid actions, have  honored their country, and saved it from great dangers. What man  ever had stronger claims to the national gratitude than General  Bonaparte? His valor and genius have saved the French people from  the excesses of anarchy, and from the miseries of war; and France  is too great, too magnanimous to leave such benefits without reward.\"    A deputation was immediately chosen to confer with Napoleon upon the  subject of the tribute of gratitude and affection which he should  receive. Surrounded by his colleagues and the principal officers  of the state, he received them the next day in the Tuileries. With  seriousness and modesty he listened to the high eulogium upon his  achievements which was pronounced, and then replaced. \"I receive  with sincere gratitude the wish to expressed by the Tribunate.  I desire no other glory than having completely performed the task  impose upon me. I aspire to no other reward than the affection of  my fellow-citizens. I shall be happy if they are thoroughly convinced,  that the evils which they may experience, will always be to me the  severest of misfortunes; that life is dear to me solely for the  services which I am to render to my country; that death itself will  have no bitterness for me, if my last looks can see the happiness  of the republic as firmly secured as is its glory.\" ..........    But how was Napoleon to be rewarded! That was the great difficult  question. Was wealth to be conferred upon him! For wealth he cared  nothing Millions had been at his disposal, and he had emptied them  all into the treasury of France. Ease, luxury, self-indulgence had  no charms for him. Were monuments to be reared to his honor, titles  to be lavished upon his name? Napoleon regarded these but means  for the accomplishment of ends. In themselves they were nothing.  The one only thing which he desired was power , power to work out  vast results for others, and thus to secure for himself renown,  which should be pure and imperishable. But how could the power of  Napoleon be increased! He was already almost absolute. Whatever he  willed, he accomplished. Senators, legislators, and tribunes all  co-operated in giving energy to his plans. It will be remembered,  that Napoleon was elected First Consul for a period of ten years.  It seemed that there was absolutely nothing which could be done,  gratifying to the First Consul, but to prolong the term of his  Consulship, by either adding to it another period of ten years,  or by continuing it during his life. \"What does he wish?\" was the  universal inquiry. Every possible means were tried, but in vain,  to"]]]
