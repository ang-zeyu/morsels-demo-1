She is bright and  clever and she is not ill looking. Thomas, I say let the young man have  his will.\"    Thomas Gordon stood up, as if he considered the responsibility off his  shoulders and the interview at an end.    \"Very well, Janet, woman, since you think it is wise. And may God deal  with him as he deals with her. Good evening, Master. I'll see you again,  and you are free to come and go as suits you. But I must go to my work  now. I left my horses standing in the field.\"    \"I will go up and send Kilmeny down,\" said Janet quietly.    She lighted the lamp on the table and left the room. A few minutes later  Kilmeny came down. Eric rose and went to meet her eagerly, but she only  put out her right hand with a pretty dignity and, while she looked into  his face, she did not look into his eyes.    \"You see I was right after all, Kilmeny,\" he said, smiling. \"Your uncle  and aunt haven't driven me away. On the contrary they have been very  kind to me, and they say I may see you whenever and wherever I like.\"    She smiled, and went over to the table to write on her slate.    \"But they were very angry last night, and said dreadful things to me.  I felt very frightened and unhappy. They seemed to think I had done  something terribly wrong. Uncle Thomas said he would never trust me out  of his sight again. I could hardly believe it when Aunt Janet came up  and told me you were here and that I might come down. She looked at me  very strangely as she spoke, but I could see that all the anger had gone  out of her face. She seemed pleased and yet sad. But I am glad they have  forgiven us.\"    She did not tell him how glad she was, and how unhappy she had been over  the thought that she was never to see him again. Yesterday she would  have told him all frankly and fully; but for her yesterday was a  lifetime away--a lifetime in which she had come into her heritage of  womanly dignity and reserve. The kiss which Eric had left on her lips,  the words her uncle and aunt had said to her, the tears she had shed for  the first time on a sleepless pillow--all had conspired to reveal her to  herself. She did not yet dream that she loved Eric Marshall, or that he  loved her. But she was no longer the child to be made a dear comrade  of. She was, though quite unconsciously, the woman to be wooed and won,  exacting, with sweet, innate pride, her dues of allegiance.        CHAPTER XIII. A SWEETER WOMAN NE'ER DREW BREATH    Thenceforward Eric Marshall was a constant visitor at the Gordon  homestead. He soon became a favourite with Thomas and Janet, especially  the latter. He liked them both, discovering under all their outward  peculiarities sterling worth and fitness of character. Thomas Gordon was  surprisingly well read and could floor Eric any time in argument, once  he became sufficiently warmed up to attain fluency of words. Eric hardly  recognized him the first time he saw him thus animated. His bent form  straightened, his sunken eyes flashed, his face flushed, his voice  rang like a trumpet, and he poured out a flood of eloquence which swept  Eric's smart, up-to-date arguments away like straws in the rush of a  mountain torrent. Eric enjoyed his own defeat enormously, but Thomas  Gordon was ashamed of being thus drawn out of himself, and for a week  afterwards confined his remarks to \"Yes\" and \"No,\" or, at the outside,  to a brief statement that a change in the weather was brewing.    Janet never talked on matters of church and state; such she plainly  considered to be far beyond a woman's province. But she listened with  lurking interest in her eyes while Thomas and Eric pelted on each other  with facts and statistics and opinions, and on the rare occasions when  Eric scored a point she permitted herself a sly little smile at her  brother's expense.    Of Neil, Eric saw but little. The Italian boy avoided him, or if they  chanced to meet passed him by with sullen, downcast eyes. Eric did not  trouble himself greatly about Neil; but Thomas Gordon, understanding the  motive which had led Neil to betray his discovery of the orchard trysts,  bluntly told Kilmeny that she must not make such an equal of Neil as she  had done.    \"You have been too kind to the lad, lassie, and he's got presumptuous.  He must be taught his place. I mistrust we have all made more of him  than we should.\"    But most of the idyllic hours of Eric's wooing were spent in the old  orchard; the garden end of it was now a wilderness of roses--roses red  as the heart of a sunset, roses pink as the early flush of dawn, roses  white as the snows on mountain peaks, roses full blown, and roses in  buds that were sweeter than anything on earth except Kilmeny's face.  Their petals fell in silken heaps along the old paths or clung to the  lush grasses among which Eric lay and dreamed, while Kilmeny played to  him on her violin.    Eric promised himself that when she was his wife her wonderful gift  for music should be cultivated to the utmost. Her powers of expression  seemed to deepen and develop every day, growing as her soul grew, taking  on new colour and richness from her ripening heart.    To Eric, the days were all pages in an inspired idyl. He had never  dreamed that love could be so mighty or the world so beautiful. He  wondered if the universe were big enough to hold his joy or eternity  long enough to live it out. His whole existence was, for the time  being, bounded by that orchard where he wooed his sweetheart. All other  ambitions and plans and hopes were set aside in the pursuit of this one  aim, the attainment of which would enhance all others a thousand-fold,  the loss of which would rob all others of their reason for existence.  His own world seemed very far away and the things of that world  forgotten.    His father, on hearing that he had taken the Lindsay school for a year,  had written him a testy, amazed letter, asking him if he were demented.    \"Or is there a girl in the case?\" he wrote. \"There must be, to tie you  down to a place like Lindsay for a year. Take care, master Eric; you've  been too sensible all your life. A man is bound to make a fool of  himself at least once, and when you didn't get through with that in your  teens it may be attacking you now.\"    David also wrote, expostulating more gravely; but he did not express the  suspicions Eric knew he must entertain.    \"Good old David! He is quaking with fear that I am up to something he  can't approve of, but he won't say a word by way of attempting to force  my confidence.\"    It could not long remain a secret in Lindsay that \"the Master\" was going  to the Gordon place on courting thoughts intent. Mrs. Williamson kept  her own and Eric's counsel; the Gordons said nothing; but the secret  leaked out and great was the surprise and gossip and wonder. One or  two incautious people ventured to express their opinion of the Master's  wisdom to the Master himself; but they never repeated the experiment.  Curiosity was rife. A hundred stories were circulated about Kilmeny, all  greatly exaggerated in the circulation. Wise heads were shaken and the  majority opined that it was a great pity. The Master was a likely young  fellow; he could have his pick of almost anybody, you might think; it  was too bad that he should go and take up with that queer, dumb niece of  the Gordons who had been brought up in such a heathenish way. But then  you never could guess what way a man's fancy would jump when he set out  to pick him a wife. They guessed Neil Gordon didn't like it much. He  seemed to have got dreadful moody and sulky of late and wouldn't sing in  the choir any more. Thus the buzz of comment and gossip ran.    To those two in the old orchard it mattered not a whit. Kilmeny knew  nothing of gossip. To her, Lindsay was as much of an unknown world as  the city of Eric's home. Her thoughts strayed far and wide in the realm  of her fancy, but they never wandered out to the little realities that  hedged her strange life around. In that life she had blossomed out, a  fair, unique thing. There were times when Eric almost regretted that one  day he must take her out of her white solitude to a world that, in the  last analysis, was only Lindsay on a larger scale, with just the same  pettiness of thought and feeling and opinion at the bottom of it. He  wished he might keep her to himself for ever, in that old, spruce-hidden  orchard where the roses fell.    One day he indulged himself in the fulfillment of the whim he had formed  when Kilmeny had told him she thought herself ugly. He went to Janet and  asked her permission to bring a mirror to the house that he might  have the privilege of being the first to reveal Kilmeny to herself  exteriorly. Janet was somewhat dubious at first.    \"There hasn't been such a thing in the house for sixteen years, Master.  There never was but three--one in the spare room, and a little one in  the kitchen, and Margaret's own. She broke them all the day it first  struck her that Kilmeny was going to be bonny. I might have got one  after she died maybe. But I didn't think of it; and there's no need of  lasses to be always prinking at their looking glasses.\"    But Eric pleaded and argued skilfully, and finally Janet said,    \"Well, well, have your own way. You'd have it anyway I think, lad. You  are one of those men who always get their own way. But that is different  from the men who TAKE their own way--and that's a mercy,\" she added  under her breath.    Eric went to town the next Saturday and picked out a mirror that pleased  him. He had it shipped to Radnor and Thomas Gordon brought it home, not  knowing what it was, for Janet had thought it just as well he should not  know.    \"It's a present the Master is making Kilmeny,\" she told him.    She sent Kilmeny off to the orchard after tea, and Eric slipped around  to the house by way of the main road and lane. He and Janet together  unpacked the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53416"],[0,"Only a Girl's Love (#16)"],[1,". Adelstone, a young gentleman from London.  He was quite the lion of the evening. I think he was a nephew of Mr.  Fielding's.\"    The old man nodded.    \"Yes; and did you like him?\"    Stella thought a moment, holding the cream-jug critically over the  coffee-cup.    \"Not much, uncle. It was very wrong, and very bad taste, I am afraid,  for they all seemed to admire him immensely, and so did he himself.\"    Mr. Etheridge looked at her rather alarmed.    \"I must say, Stella, you get too critical. I don't think we are quite  used to it.\"    She laughed.    \"I don't fancy Mr. Adelstone was at all conscious of adverse criticism;  he seemed quite satisfied with everybody, himself in particular. He  certainly was beautifully dressed, and he had the dearest little hands  and feet in the world; and his hair was parted to a hair, and as  smooth as a black-and-tan terrier's; so that he had some grounds for  satisfaction.\"    \"What did he do to offend you, Stella?\" asked the old man, rather  shrewdly.    She laughed again, and a little touch of color came into her face, but  she answered quite frankly:    \"He paid me compliments, uncle.\"    \"That doesn't offend your sex generally, Stella.\"    \"It offends me,\" said Stella, quickly. \"I--I detest them! especially  when the man who pays them does it with a self-satisfied smile which  shows that he is thinking more of his own eloquence and gallantry than  of the person he is flattering.\"    The old man looked at her.    \"Will you oblige me by telling me your age again?\" he said.    She laughed.    \"Am I too wise, uncle? Well, never mind--I'll promise to be good and  stupid, if you like. But you are not eating any breakfast; and you must  not keep looking at that odious easel all the time, as if you were  longing to get back to it. Did you ever see a jealous woman?\"    \"No, never.\"    \"Well, if you don't want to, you must not confine all your attention to  your work.\"    \"I don't think there is much fear of that when you are near,\" he said,  meekly.    She laughed, and jumped up to kiss him with delight.    \"Now that was a splendid compliment, sir! You are improving  rapidly--Mr. Adelstone himself couldn't have done it more neatly.\"    Scarcely had the words left her lips than the door opened.    \"Mr. Adelstone,\" said Mrs. Penfold.    A young man, tall and dark, and faultlessly dressed, stood in the  doorway, his hat in one hand, a bouquet of flowers in the other. He was  undeniably good-looking, and as he stood with a smile upon his face,  looked at his best. A severe critic might have found fault with his  eyes, and said that they were a little too small and a little too near  together, might also have added that they were rather shifty, and that  there was something approaching the sinister in the curves of the thin  lips; but he was undeniably good-looking, and notwithstanding his well  cut clothes and spotless boots with their gray gaiters, his white hands  with the choice selection of rings, there was an indication of power  about him; no one could have suspected him of being a fool, or lacking  the power of observation; for instance, as he stood now, smiling and  waiting for a welcome, his dark eyes took in every detail of the room  without appearing to leave Stella's face.    Mr. Etheridge looked up with the usual confused air with which he  always received his rare visitors, but Stella held out her hand with a  smile calm and self-possessed. There is a great deal of the woman even  about a girl of nineteen.    \"Good-morning, Mr. Adelstone,\" she said. \"You have come just in time  for a cup of coffee.\"    \"I ought to apologize for intruding at such an unseasonable hour,\" he  said, as he bent over her hand, \"but your good housekeeper would not  hear of my going without paying my respects. I am afraid I'm intruding.\"    \"Not at all, not at all,\" murmured the artist. \"Here's a chair,\" and  he rose and cleared a chair of its litter by the simple process of  sweeping it on to the floor.    Mr. Adelstone sat down.    \"I hope you are not tired after your mild dissipation last night?\" he  asked of Stella.    She laughed.    \"Not at all. I was telling uncle how nice it was. It was my first party  in England, you know.\"    \"Oh, you musn't call it a party,\" he said. \"But I am very glad you  enjoyed it.\"    \"What beautiful flowers,\" said Stella, glancing at the bouquet.    He handed them to her.    \"Will you be so kind as to accept them?\" he said. \"I heard you admire  them in the conservatory last night and I brought them for you from the  rectory green-house.\"    \"For me?\" exclaimed Stella, open-eyed. \"Oh, I didn't know! I am so  sorry you should have troubled. It was very kind. You must have robbed  the poor plants terribly.\"    \"They would be quite consoled if they could know for whom their  blossoms were intended,\" he said, with a low bow.    Stella looked at him with a smile, and glanced half archly at her uncle.    \"That was very nice,\" she said. \"Poor flowers! it is a pity they can't  know! Can't you tell them? There is a language of flowers, you know!\"    Mr. Adelstone smiled. He was not accustomed to have his compliments met  with such ready wit, and was nonplussed for a moment, while his eyes  dropped from her face with a little shifty look.    Mr. Etheridge broke the rather embarrassing pause.    \"Put them in the vase for her, Mr. Adelstone, will you, please, and  come and have some breakfast. You can't have had any.\"    He waited until Stella echoed the invitation, then drew up to the table.    Stella rang for cup and saucer and plates, and poured him out some  coffee; and he plunged into small talk with the greatest ease, his keen  eyes watching every graceful turn of Stella's arm, and glancing now and  again at the beautiful face.    It was very good small talk, and amusing. Mr. Adelstone was one of  those men who had seen everything. He talked of the London season that  was just coming on, to Stella, who sat and listened, half amused, half  puzzled, for London was an unknown land to her, and the string of  names, noble and fashionable, which fell from his ready tongue, was  entirely strange to her.    Then he talked of the coming Academy to Mr. Etheridge, and seemed to  know all about the pictures that were going to be exhibited, and which  ones would make a stir, and which would fail. Then he addressed himself  to Stella again.    \"You must pay London a visit, Miss Etheridge; there is no place like it  the whole world through--not even Paris or Rome.\"    Stella smiled.    \"It is not very likely that I shall see London for a long time. My  uncle does not often go, although it is so near, do you?\"    \"No, no,\" he assented, \"not often.\"    \"Perhaps you are to be congratulated,\" said Mr. Adelstone. \"With all  its charms, I am glad to get away from it.\"    \"You live there?\" said Stella.    \"Yes,\" he said, quietly, welcoming the faint look of interest in her  eyes. \"Yes; I live in chambers, as it is called, in one of the old law  inns. I am a lawyer!\"    Stella nodded.    \"I know. You wear a long black gown and a wig.\"    He smiled.    \"And address a jury; and do you say 'm'lud' instead of 'my lord,' as  people in novels always make barristers say?\"    \"I don't know; perhaps I do,\" he answered, with a smile; \"but I don't  address a jury, or have an opportunity of calling a judge 'my lud,' or  'my lord,' often. Most of my work is done at my chambers. I am very  glad to get down into the country for a holiday.\"    \"Are you going to stay long?\" asked Mr. Etheridge, with polite interest.    Mr. Adelstone paused a moment, and glanced at Stella before answering.    \"I don't know,\" he said. \"I meant going back to-day, but--I think I  have changed my mind.\"    Stella was only half listening, but the words caused her to start. They  were the same as those which Lord Leycester had uttered three nights  ago.    Mr. Adelstone's keen eyes saw the start, and he made a mental note of  it.    \"Ah! it is beautiful weather,\" said Mr. Etheridge. \"It would be a pity  to leave Wyndward for London now.\"    \"Yes: I shall be more than ever sorry to go now,\" said Mr. Adelstone,  and his glance rested for a moment on Stella's face, but it was quite  lost, for Stella's eyes were fixed on the scene beyond the window  dreamily.    With almost a start she turned to him.    \"Let me give you some more coffee!\"    \"No, thanks,\" he said; then, as Stella rose and rang the bell, he  walked to the easel. \"That will be a beautiful picture, Mr. Etheridge,\"  he said, viewing it with a critical air.    \"I don't know,\" said the artist, simply.    \"You will exhibit it?\"    \"I never exhibit anything,\" was the quiet reply.    \"No! I am surprised!\" exclaimed the young man, but there was something  in the quiet manner of the old man that stopped any further questions.    \"No,\" said Mr. Etheridge; \"why should I? I have\"--and he smiled--\"no  ambition. Besides I am an old man, I have had my chance; let the young  ones take theirs, I leave them room. You are fond of art?\"    \"Very,\" said Mr. Adelstone. \"May I look round?\"    The old man waved his hand, and took up his brush.    Jasper Adelstone wandered round the room, taking up the canvases and  examining them; Stella stood at the window humming softly.    Suddenly she heard him utter an involuntary exclamation, and turning  round saw that he had the portrait of Lord Leycester in his hand.    His face was turned toward her, and as she turned quickly, he was in  time to catch a sinister frown of dislike, which rested for a moment on  his face, but vanished as he raised his eyes and met hers.    \"Lord Leycester,\" he said, with a smile and an uprising of the  eyebrows. \"A remarkable instance of an artist's power.\"    \"What do you mean?\" asked Stella, quietly, but with lowered eyes.    \"I mean that it is a fair example of ideality. Mr. Etheridge has  painted a likeness of Lord Leycester, and added an ideal poetry of his  own.\"    \"You mean that it is not like him?\" she"]]]
