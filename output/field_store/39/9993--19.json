With them had been buried many of the  implements of their trade. One or two had apparently not been opened.  Here were knitting utensils, toilet articles, implements for weaving,  spools of thread, needles of bone and bronze. With the body of a girl  had been placed a kind of work-box, containing the articles that she  had used, and the mummy of a parrot, some beads, and fragments of an  ornament of silver. Dias told them that all these tombs were made long  before the coming of the Incas. He said that round the heads of the men  and boys were wound the slings they had used in life, while a piece of  cotton flock was wrapped round the heads of the women. Many of the  graves communicated with each other by very narrow passages; the  purpose of these was not clear, but probably they were made to enable  the spirits of the dead to meet and hold communion with each other.    \"I don't want to see any more of them,\" Bertie said after they had  spent three hours in their investigations; \"this sort of thing is  enough to give one a fit of the blues.\"    Beyond Chosica civilization almost ceased. The road became little more  than a mule track, and was in many places almost impassable by vehicles  of any kind. Nothing could be wilder than the scenery they passed. At  times rivers ran through perpendicular gorges, and the track wound up  and down steep ravines. Sometimes they would all dismount, though Dias  assured them it was not necessary; still, it made a change from the  monotonous pace of little over two miles an hour at which the mules  breasted the steep incline.    Jose rode on the first of the baggage mules, which was very lightly  loaded; he generally sang the whole time. When on foot, Donna Maria  stepped gaily along and Bertie had hard work to keep pace with her. He  was making rapid progress with the language, though occasionally a peal  of laughter from his companion told of some egregious error.    There were villages every few miles, but now when they halted they did  so as a rule a mile before they got to one of these. Dinner was cooked  over a fire of dead sticks, and after the meal Harry's tent was erected  and the bed spread in it. The Indians went on to the village for the  night, while Harry and his brother sat and smoked for a time by the  fire and then turned in. At daybreak Dias rode back leading their  riding mules and a baggage animal; the tent, beds, and the cooking  utensils were packed up, and they rode in to the village and passed on  at a trot until they overtook Maria and Jose, who had started with the  other four mules when Dias rode away. At last they reached the head of  the pass, and two days' journey took them to Oroya, standing on an  elevated plateau some ten thousand feet above the sea, and five  thousand below the highest point of the road.    The scenery had now completely changed. Villages were scattered thickly  over the plain, cultivation was general. The hillsides were lined by  artificial terraces, on which were perched chalets and small  hamlets--they had seen similar terraces on the way up. These were as  the Spaniards found them, and must at one time have been inhabited by a  thriving population. Even now gardens and orchards flourished upon them  up to the highest points on the hills. Oroya was a large place, and,  avoiding the busy part of the town, they hired rooms, as it was  necessary to give the mules two days' rest. On the first evening after  their arrival they gathered round a fire, for the nights were cold, and  even in the daytime they did not find their numerous wraps too hot for  them.    \"Now, Dias,\" Harry said, \"we must talk over our plans. You said that we  would not decide upon anything till we got here.\"    \"In the first place, senor, I think it would be well to go to the north  to see the Cerro de Pasco silver mine, they say it is the richest in  the world. It is well that you should see the formation of the rocks  and the nature of the ore; we may in our journeyings come across  similar rock.\"    \"It is gold rather than silver that one wants to find, Dias. I do not  say that a silver mine would not be worth a very large sum of money,  but it would be necessary to open it and go to a large expense to prove  it. Then one would have to go to England and get up a company to work  it, which would be a long and difficult matter. Still, I am quite ready  to go and see the place.\"    Dias nodded.    \"What you say is true, senor. I could take you to a dozen places where  there is silver. They may be good or may not, but even if they were as  rich as Potosi the silver would have to be carried to Lima, so great a  distance on mules' backs that it would swallow up the profits. And it  would be almost impossible to convey the necessary machinery there,  indeed to do so would involve the making of roads for a great distance.\"    \"At the same time, Dias, should you know of any silver lodes that might  turn out well, I would certainly take some samples, and send two or  three mule-loads of the stuff home. They might be of no good for the  purpose for which I have come out here, but in time I might do  something with them; the law here is that anyone who finds a mine can  obtain a concession for it.\"    \"That is so, senor, but he must proceed to work it.\"    \"I suppose it would be sufficient to put two or three men on for that  purpose.\"    \"But if you were away for a year difficulties might arise. It would be  better for you only to determine the course of the lode, its thickness  and value, to trace it as far as possible, and then hide all signs of  the work, and not to make your claim until you return here.\"    \"Very well, I will take your advice, Dias. And now about the real  object of our journey.\"    \"I have been thinking it over deeply,\" Dias said. \"First as to mines;  at present almost all the gold that is obtained is acquired by washing  the sands of rivers. Here and there gold has been found in rocks, but  not in sufficient quantities to make mining pay. The rivers whose sands  are richest in gold are in the mountains that lie behind Lake Titicaca,  which lies to the south of Cuzco and on the border of Bolivia. No one  doubts that in the time of the Incas there existed gold mines, and very  rich ones; for if it had not been so it is impossible to account for  the enormous amount of gold obtained by the Spanish conquerors, and no  one doubts that they got but a small portion of the gold in existence  when they arrived. It is of no use whatever for us to search the old  ruins of the Incas in Cuzco, or their other great towns; all that can  be found there has already been carried away.    \"Now you see, senor, Huanuco, Jauja, Cuzco, and Puno all lie near the  eastern range of the Andes, and when the alarm caused by the arrogant  conduct of the Spaniards began, it was natural that the treasures  should be sent away into the heart of those mountains. The towns on the  western sides of this plateau, Challhuanca, Tanibobamba, Huancavelica,  would as naturally send theirs for safety into the gorges of the  western Andes, but all traditions point to the fact that this was not  done by the Incas. As soon as the Spaniards arrived and struck the  first blow, the great chiefs would naturally call together a band of  their followers on whose fidelity they could rely, load the treasures  on llamas, of which they possessed great numbers, and hurry them off to  the mountains.    \"It is among the mountains, therefore, that our search must be made.  All our traditions point to the fact that it was along the eastern  range of the Cordilleras, and the country beyond, that by far the  greater portion of the treasures were taken for concealment. At any  rate, as we have but eighteen months for the search it is on that side  that we must try, and ten times that length of time would be  insufficient for us to do it thoroughly. As to the gold mines, it is  certain that they lie in that portion of the range between Cuzco and  Lake Titicaca. It was near Puno, a short distance from the lake, that  the Spaniards, owing to the folly of an Indian, found great treasures  in a cave. They would probably have found much more had not a stream  suddenly burst out which flooded the whole valley and converted it into  a lake. Which do you think we had better look for first, gold mines or  hidden treasures?\"    \"Of course that must depend on you, Dias, and how much you know about  these matters. I need not say that a hidden treasure would be of vastly  more use to me than the richest gold mine in the world. To obtain the  gold from a mine an abundance of labour is required, besides machinery  for crushing quartz and separating the gold from it. In the bed of a  river, if it is rich and abounding in nuggets, three or four men, with  rough machinery, could wash out a large quantity of gold in a short  time, and a place of that sort would be far better than a rich mine,  which could not be worked without a large amount of capital.\"    \"I have heard tales of such places on the other side of the mountains  to the south. From time to time gold-seekers have returned with as much  as they could carry, but not one in a hundred of those that go ever  come back; some doubtless die from hunger and hardship, but more are  killed by the Indians. Most of the tribes there are extremely savage,  and are constantly at war with each other, and they slay every white  man who ventures into their country.\"    \"Then is it not probable, Dias, that the gold could have come from  their country?\"    \"Not from the plains, but from the streams running down into them; and  although the Incas never attempted to subdue the tribes beyond the  mountains, they may have had bodies of troops to protect the workers  from incursions by these savages.\"    \"Are there many wild beasts there?\"    \"In some parts of the mountains pumas and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/708"],[0,"The Princess and the Goblin (#16)"],[1," at length was sure they were  many more than he had passed as he came.  He had to use great caution  to pass unseen--they lay so close together. Could his string have led  him wrong?  He still followed winding it, and still it led him into  more thickly populated quarters, until he became quite uneasy, and  indeed apprehensive; for although he was not afraid of the cobs, he was  afraid of not finding his way out. But what could he do?  It was of no  use to sit down and wait for the morning--the morning made no  difference here.  It was dark, and always dark; and if his string  failed him he was helpless.  He might even arrive within a yard of the  mine and never know it. Seeing he could do nothing better he would at  least find where the end of his string was, and, if possible, how it  had come to play him such a trick.  He knew by the size of the ball  that he was getting pretty near the last of it, when he began to feel a  tugging and pulling at it.  What could it mean?  Turning a sharp  corner, he thought he heard strange sounds.  These grew, as he went on,  to a scuffling and growling and squeaking; and the noise increased,  until, turning a second sharp corner, he found himself in the midst of  it, and the same moment tumbled over a wallowing mass, which he knew  must be a knot of the cobs' creatures.  Before he could recover his  feet, he had caught some great scratches on his face and several severe  bites on his legs and arms.  But as he scrambled to get up, his hand  fell upon his pickaxe, and before the horrid beasts could do him any  serious harm, he was laying about with it right and left in the dark.  The hideous cries which followed gave him the satisfaction of knowing  that he had punished some of them pretty smartly for their rudeness,  and by their scampering and their retreating howls, he perceived that  he had routed them.  He stood for a little, weighing his battle-axe in  his hand as if it had been the most precious lump of metal--but indeed  no lump of gold itself could have been so precious at the time as that  common tool--then untied the end of the string from it, put the ball in  his pocket, and still stood thinking.  It was clear that the cobs'  creatures had found his axe, had between them carried it off, and had  so led him he knew not where.  But for all his thinking he could not  tell what he ought to do, until suddenly he became aware of a glimmer  of light in the distance.  Without a moment's hesitation he set out for  it, as fast as the unknown and rugged way would permit.  Yet again  turning a corner, led by the dim light, he spied something quite new in  his experience of the underground regions--a small irregular shape of  something shining.  Going up to it, he found it was a piece of mica, or  Muscovy glass, called sheep-silver in Scotland, and the light flickered  as if from a fire behind it.  After trying in vain for some time to  discover an entrance to the place where it was burning, he came at  length to a small chamber in which an opening, high in the wall,  revealed a glow beyond.  To this opening he managed to scramble up, and  then he saw a strange sight.    Below sat a little group of goblins around a fire, the smoke of which  vanished in the darkness far aloft.  The sides of the cave were full of  shining minerals like those of the palace hall; and the company was  evidently of a superior order, for every one wore stones about head, or  arms, or waist, shining dull gorgeous colours in the light of the fire.  Nor had Curdie looked long before he recognized the king himself, and  found that he had made his way into the inner apartment of the royal  family.  He had never had such a good chance of hearing something.  He  crept through the hole as softly as he could, scrambled a good way down  the wall towards them without attracting attention, and then sat down  and listened. The king, evidently the queen, and probably the crown  prince and the Prime Minister were talking together.  He was sure of  the queen by her shoes, for as she warmed her feet at the fire, he saw  them quite plainly.    'That will be fun!' said the one he took for the crown prince. It was  the first whole sentence he heard.    'I don't see why you should think it such a grand affair!' said his  stepmother, tossing her head backward.    'You must remember, my spouse,' interposed His Majesty, as if making  excuse for his son, 'he has got the same blood in him.  His mother--'    'Don't talk to me of his mother!  You positively encourage his  unnatural fancies.  Whatever belongs to that mother ought to be cut out  of him.'    'You forget yourself, my dear!' said the king.    'I don't,' said the queen, 'nor you either.  If you expect me to  approve of such coarse tastes, you will find yourself mistaken.  I  don't wear shoes for nothing.'    'You must acknowledge, however,' the king said, with a little groan,  'that this at least is no whim of Harelip's, but a matter of State  policy.  You are well aware that his gratification comes purely from  the pleasure of sacrificing himself to the public good.    Does it not, Harelip?'    'Yes, father; of course it does.  Only it will be nice to make her cry.  I'll have the skin taken off between her toes, and tie them up till  they grow together.  Then her feet will be like other people's, and  there will be no occasion for her to wear shoes.'    'Do you mean to insinuate I've got toes, you unnatural wretch?' cried  the queen; and she moved angrily towards Harelip.  The councillor,  however, who was betwixt them, leaned forward so as to prevent her  touching him, but only as if to address the prince.    'Your Royal Highness,' he said, 'possibly requires to be reminded that  you have got three toes yourself--one on one foot, two on the other.'    'Ha! ha! ha!' shouted the queen triumphantly.    The councillor, encouraged by this mark of favour, went on.    'It seems to me, Your Royal Highness, it would greatly endear you to  your future people, proving to them that you are not the less one of  themselves that you had the misfortune to be born of a sun-mother, if  you were to command upon yourself the comparatively slight operation  which, in a more extended form, you so wisely meditate with regard to  your future princess.'    'Ha! ha! ha!' laughed the queen louder than before, and the king and  the minister joined in the laugh.  Harelip growled, and for a few  moments the others continued to express their enjoyment of his  discomfiture.    The queen was the only one Curdie could see with any distinctness. She  sat sideways to him, and the light of the fire shone full upon her  face.  He could not consider her handsome.  Her nose was certainly  broader at the end than its extreme length, and her eyes, instead of  being horizontal, were set up like two perpendicular eggs, one on the  broad, the other on the small end.  Her mouth was no bigger than a  small buttonhole until she laughed, when it stretched from ear to  ear--only, to be sure, her ears were very nearly in the middle of her  cheeks.    Anxious to hear everything they might say, Curdie ventured to slide  down a smooth part of the rock just under him, to a projection below,  upon which he thought to rest.  But whether he was not careful enough,  or the projection gave way, down he came with a rush on the floor of  the cavern, bringing with him a great rumbling shower of stones.    The goblins jumped from their seats in more anger than consternation,  for they had never yet seen anything to be afraid of in the palace.  But when they saw Curdie with his pick in his hand their rage was  mingled with fear, for they took him for the first of an invasion of  miners.  The king notwithstanding drew himself up to his full height of  four feet, spread himself to his full breadth of three and a half, for  he was the handsomest and squarest of all the goblins, and strutting up  to Curdie, planted himself with outspread feet before him, and said  with dignity:    'Pray what right have you in my palace?'    'The right of necessity, Your Majesty,' answered Curdie.  'I lost my  way and did not know where I was wandering to.'    'How did you get in?'    'By a hole in the mountain.'    'But you are a miner!  Look at your pickaxe!'    Curdie did look at it, answering:    'I came upon it lying on the ground a little way from here.  I tumbled  over some wild beasts who were playing with it.  Look, Your Majesty.'  And Curdie showed him how he was scratched and bitten.    The king was pleased to find him behave more politely than he had  expected from what his people had told him concerning the miners, for  he attributed it to the power of his own presence; but he did not  therefore feel friendly to the intruder.    'You will oblige me by walking out of my dominions at once,' he said,  well knowing what a mockery lay in the words.    'With pleasure, if Your Majesty will give me a guide,' said Curdie.    'I will give you a thousand,' said the king with a scoffing air of  magnificent liberality.    'One will be quite sufficient,' said Curdie.    But the king uttered a strange shout, half halloo, half roar, and in  rushed goblins till the cave was swarming.  He said something to the  first of them which Curdie could not hear, and it was passed from one  to another till in a moment the farthest in the crowd had evidently  heard and understood it.  They began to gather about him in a way he  did not relish, and he retreated towards the wall. They pressed upon  him.    'Stand back,' said Curdie, grasping his pickaxe tighter by his knee.    They only grinned and pressed closer.  Curdie bethought himself and  began to rhyme.        'Ten, twenty, thirty--    You're all so very dirty!    Twenty, thirty, forty--    You're all so thick and snorty!    'Thirty, forty, fifty--    You're all so puff-and-snifty!    Forty, fifty, sixty--    Beast and man so mixty!      'Fifty, sixty, seventy--    Mixty, maxty, leaventy!    Sixty, seventy,"]]]
