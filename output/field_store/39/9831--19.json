He was in the Black Watch, when first it was mustered; and, like other  gentlemen privates, had a gillie at his back to carry his firelock for  him on the march. Well, the King, it appears, was wishful to see Hieland  swordsmanship; and my father and three more were chosen out and sent to  London town, to let him see it at the best. So they were had into the  palace and showed the whole art of the sword for two hours at a stretch,  before King George and Queen Carline, and the Butcher Cumberland, and  many more of whom I havenae mind. And when they were through, the King  (for all he was a rank usurper) spoke them fair and gave each man three  guineas in his hand. Now, as they were going out of the palace, they  had a porter's lodge to go by; and it came in on my father, as he was  perhaps the first private Hieland gentleman that had ever gone by that  door, it was right he should give the poor porter a proper notion of  their quality. So he gives the King's three guineas into the man's hand,  as if it was his common custom; the three others that came behind him  did the same; and there they were on the street, never a penny the  better for their pains. Some say it was one, that was the first to fee  the King's porter; and some say it was another; but the truth of it is,  that it was Duncan Stewart, as I am willing to prove with either sword  or pistol. And that was the father that I had, God rest him!\"    \"I think he was not the man to leave you rich,\" said I.    \"And that's true,\" said Alan. \"He left me my breeks to cover me, and  little besides. And that was how I came to enlist, which was a black  spot upon my character at the best of times, and would still be a sore  job for me if I fell among the red-coats.\"    \"What,\" cried I, \"were you in the English army?\"    \"That was I,\" said Alan. \"But I deserted to the right side at Preston  Pans--and that's some comfort.\"    I could scarcely share this view: holding desertion under arms for an  unpardonable fault in honour. But for all I was so young, I was wiser  than say my thought. \"Dear, dear,\" says I, \"the punishment is death.\"    \"Ay\" said he, \"if they got hands on me, it would be a short shrift and  a lang tow for Alan! But I have the King of France's commission in my  pocket, which would aye be some protection.\"    \"I misdoubt it much,\" said I.    \"I have doubts mysel',\" said Alan drily.    \"And, good heaven, man,\" cried I, \"you that are a condemned rebel, and a  deserter, and a man of the French King's--what tempts ye back into this  country? It's a braving of Providence.\"    \"Tut!\" says Alan, \"I have been back every year since forty-six!\"    \"And what brings ye, man?\" cried I.    \"Well, ye see, I weary for my friends and country,\" said he. \"France is  a braw place, nae doubt; but I weary for the heather and the deer. And  then I have bit things that I attend to. Whiles I pick up a few lads  to serve the King of France: recruits, ye see; and that's aye a  little money. But the heart of the matter is the business of my chief,  Ardshiel.\"    \"I thought they called your chief Appin,\" said I.    \"Ay, but Ardshiel is the captain of the clan,\" said he, which scarcely  cleared my mind. \"Ye see, David, he that was all his life so great a  man, and come of the blood and bearing the name of kings, is now brought  down to live in a French town like a poor and private person. He that  had four hundred swords at his whistle, I have seen, with these eyes  of mine, buying butter in the market-place, and taking it home in a  kale-leaf. This is not only a pain but a disgrace to us of his family  and clan. There are the bairns forby, the children and the hope of  Appin, that must be learned their letters and how to hold a sword, in  that far country. Now, the tenants of Appin have to pay a rent to King  George; but their hearts are staunch, they are true to their chief; and  what with love and a bit of pressure, and maybe a threat or two, the  poor folk scrape up a second rent for Ardshiel. Well, David, I'm the  hand that carries it.\" And he struck the belt about his body, so that  the guineas rang.    \"Do they pay both?\" cried I.    \"Ay, David, both,\" says he.    \"What! two rents?\" I repeated.    \"Ay, David,\" said he. \"I told a different tale to yon captain man; but  this is the truth of it. And it's wonderful to me how little pressure  is needed. But that's the handiwork of my good kinsman and my father's  friend, James of the Glens: James Stewart, that is: Ardshiel's  half-brother. He it is that gets the money in, and does the management.\"    This was the first time I heard the name of that James Stewart, who was  afterwards so famous at the time of his hanging. But I took little heed  at the moment, for all my mind was occupied with the generosity of these  poor Highlanders.    \"I call it noble,\" I cried. \"I'm a Whig, or little better; but I call it  noble.\"    \"Ay\" said he, \"ye're a Whig, but ye're a gentleman; and that's what does  it. Now, if ye were one of the cursed race of Campbell, ye would gnash  your teeth to hear tell of it. If ye were the Red Fox...\" And at that  name, his teeth shut together, and he ceased speaking. I have seen many  a grim face, but never a grimmer than Alan's when he had named the Red  Fox.    \"And who is the Red Fox?\" I asked, daunted, but still curious.    \"Who is he?\" cried Alan. \"Well, and I'll tell you that. When the men of  the clans were broken at Culloden, and the good cause went down, and the  horses rode over the fetlocks in the best blood of the north, Ardshiel  had to flee like a poor deer upon the mountains--he and his lady and his  bairns. A sair job we had of it before we got him shipped; and while he  still lay in the heather, the English rogues, that couldnae come at his  life, were striking at his rights. They stripped him of his powers; they  stripped him of his lands; they plucked the weapons from the hands of  his clansmen, that had borne arms for thirty centuries; ay, and the very  clothes off their backs--so that it's now a sin to wear a tartan plaid,  and a man may be cast into a gaol if he has but a kilt about his legs.  One thing they couldnae kill. That was the love the clansmen bore their  chief. These guineas are the proof of it. And now, in there steps a man,  a Campbell, red-headed Colin of Glenure----\"    \"Is that him you call the Red Fox?\" said I.    \"Will ye bring me his brush?\" cries Alan, fiercely. \"Ay, that's the man.  In he steps, and gets papers from King George, to be so-called King's  factor on the lands of Appin. And at first he sings small, and is  hail-fellow-well-met with Sheamus--that's James of the Glens, my  chieftain's agent. But by-and-by, that came to his ears that I have just  told you; how the poor commons of Appin, the farmers and the crofters  and the boumen, were wringing their very plaids to get a second rent,  and send it over-seas for Ardshiel and his poor bairns. What was it ye  called it, when I told ye?\"    \"I called it noble, Alan,\" said I.    \"And you little better than a common Whig!\" cries Alan. \"But when it  came to Colin Roy, the black Campbell blood in him ran wild. He sat  gnashing his teeth at the wine table. What! should a Stewart get a bite  of bread, and him not be able to prevent it? Ah! Red Fox, if ever I  hold you at a gun's end, the Lord have pity upon ye!\" (Alan stopped to  swallow down his anger.) \"Well, David, what does he do? He declares all  the farms to let. And, thinks he, in his black heart, 'I'll soon get  other tenants that'll overbid these Stewarts, and Maccolls, and Macrobs'  (for these are all names in my clan, David); 'and then,' thinks he,  'Ardshiel will have to hold his bonnet on a French roadside.'\"    \"Well,\" said I, \"what followed?\"    Alan laid down his pipe, which he had long since suffered to go out, and  set his two hands upon his knees.    \"Ay,\" said he, \"ye'll never guess that! For these same Stewarts, and  Maccolls, and Macrobs (that had two rents to pay, one to King George  by stark force, and one to Ardshiel by natural kindness) offered him a  better price than any Campbell in all broad Scotland; and far he  sent seeking them--as far as to the sides of Clyde and the cross of  Edinburgh--seeking, and fleeching, and begging them to come, where there  was a Stewart to be starved and a red-headed hound of a Campbell to be  pleasured!\"    \"Well, Alan,\" said I, \"that is a strange story, and a fine one, too. And  Whig as I may be, I am glad the man was beaten.\"    \"Him beaten?\" echoed Alan. \"It's little ye ken of Campbells, and less  of the Red Fox. Him beaten? No: nor will be, till his blood's on the  hillside! But if the day comes, David man, that I can find time and  leisure for a bit of hunting, there grows not enough heather in all  Scotland to hide him from my vengeance!\"    \"Man Alan,\" said I, \"ye are neither very wise nor very Christian to  blow off so many words of anger. They will do the man ye call the Fox no  harm, and yourself no good. Tell me your tale plainly out. What did he  next?\"    \"And that's a good observe, David,\" said Alan. \"Troth and indeed,  they will do him no harm; the more's the pity! And barring that about  Christianity (of which my opinion is quite otherwise, or I would be nae  Christian), I am much of your mind.\"    \"Opinion here or opinion there,\" said I, \"it's a kent thing that  Christianity forbids revenge.\"    \"Ay\" said he, \"it's well seen it was a Campbell taught ye! It would be  a convenient world for them and their sort, if there was no such a thing  as a lad and a gun behind a heather bush! But that's nothing to the  point. This is what he did.\"    \"Ay\" said I, \"come to that.\"    \"Well, David,\" said he, \"since he couldnae be rid of the loyal commons  by fair means, he swore he would be rid of them by foul. Ardshiel was to  starve: that was the thing he aimed at. And since them that fed him in  his exile wouldnae be bought out--right or wrong, he would "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4210"],[0,"Our War with Spain for Cuba's Freedom (#16)"],[1,"be  likely to interfere with us. England could not bear to be suddenly  shut out of our market, and see her manufactures paralyzed, even  by a temporary suspension of her intercourse with us. And France,  with the heavy task now on her hands, and when she so eagerly  aspires to take her seat as the acknowledged chief of the European  family, would have no inducement to assume the burden of another  war.\"    The result of this conference is so interesting in its application  to present conditions that its reproduction is required to make  intelligible the whole story of Cuba, and we give it here:    THE OSTEND MANIFESTO.    Sir: The undersigned, in compliance with the wish expressed by the  president in the several confidential despatches you have  addressed to us respectively, to that effect, we have met in  conference, first at Ostend, in Belgium, on the 9th, 10th, and  11th instant, and then at Aix-la-Chapelle, in Prussia, on the days  next following, up to the date hereof.    There has been a full and unreserved interchange of views and  sentiments between us, which we are most happy to inform you has  resulted in a cordial coincidence of opinion on the grave and  important subjects submitted to our consideration.    We have arrived at the conclusion, and are thoroughly convinced  that an immediate and earnest effort ought to be made by the  government of the United States to purchase Cuba from Spain at any  price for which it can he obtained, not exceeding the sum of $...    The proposal should, in our opinion, be made in such a manner as  to be presented through the necessary diplomatic forms to the  Supreme Constituent Cortes about to assemble. On this momentous  question, in which the people, both of Spain and the United  States, are so deeply interested, all our proceedings ought to be  open, frank and public. They should be of such a character as to  challenge the approbation of the world.    We firmly believe that, in the progress of human events, the time  has arrived when the vital interests of Spain are as seriously  involved in the sale, us those of the United States in the  purchase, of the island, and that the transaction will prove  equally honorable to both nations.    Under these circumstances we cannot anticipate a failure, unless  possibly through the malign influence of foreign powers who  possess no right whatever to interfere in the matter.    We proceed to state some of the reasons which have brought us to,  this conclusion, and for the sake of clearness, we shall specify  them under two distinct heads:    1. The United States ought, if practicable, to purchase Cuba with  as little delay as possible.    2. The probability is great that the government and Cortes of  Spain will prove willing to sell it, because this would  essentially promote the highest and best interests of the Spanish  people.    Then, 1. It must be clear to every reflecting mind that, from the  peculiarity of its geographical position, and the considerations  attendant on it. Cuba is as necessary to the North American  republic as any of its present members, and that it belongs  naturally to that great family of states of which the Union is the  providential nursery.    From its locality it commands the mouth of the Mississippi and the  immense and annually increasing trade which must seek this avenue  to the ocean.    On the numerous navigable streams, measuring an aggregate course  of some thirty thousand miles, which disembogue themselves through  this magnificent river into the Gulf of Mexico, the increase of  the population within the last ten years amounts to more than that  of the entire Union at the time Louisiana was annexed to it.    The natural and main outlet to the products of this entire  population, the highway of their direct intercourse with the  Atlantic and the Pacific States, can never be secure, but must  ever be endangered whilst Cuba is a dependency of a distant power  in whose possession it has proved to be a source of constant  annoyance and embarrassment to their interests.    Indeed the Union can never enjoy repose, nor possess reliable  security, as long as Cuba is not embraced within its boundaries.    Its immediate acquisition by our government is of paramount  importance, and we cannot doubt but that it is a consummation  devoutly wished for by its inhabitants.    The intercourse which its proximity to our coast begets and  encourages between them and the citizens of the United States,  has, in the progress of time, so united their interests and  blended their fortunes that they now look upon each other as if  they were one people, and had but one destiny.    Considerations exist which render delay in the acquisition of this  island exceedingly dangerous to the United States.    The system of immigration and labor lately organized within its  limits, and the tyranny and oppression which characterize its  immediate rulers threaten an insurrection at every moment, which  may result in direful consequences to the American people.    Cuba has thus become to us an unceasing danger, and a permanent  cause of anxiety and alarm.    But we need not enlarge on these topics. It can scarcely be  apprehended that foreign powers, in violation of international  law, would interpose their influence with Spain to prevent our  acquisition of the island. Its inhabitants are now suffering under  the worst of all possible governments, that of absolute despotism,  delegated by a distant power to irresponsible agents, who are  changed at short intervals, and who are tempted to improve their  brief opportunity thus afforded to accumulate fortunes by the  basest means.    As long as this system shall endure, humanity may in vain demand  the suppression of the African slave trade in the island. This is  rendered impossible whilst that infamous traffic remains an  irresistible temptation and a source of immense profit to needy  and avaricious officials, who, to attain their ends, scruple not  to trample the most sacred principles under foot.    The Spanish government at home may be well disposed, but  experience has proved that it cannot control these remote  depositaries of its power.    Besides, the commercial nations of the world cannot fail to  perceive and appreciate the great advantages which would result to  their people from a dissolution of the forced and unnatural  connection between Spain and Cuba, and the annexation of the  latter to the United States. The trade of England and France with  Cuba would, in that event, assume at once an important and  profitable character, and rapidly extend with the increasing  population and prosperity of the island.    2. But if the United States and every commercial nation would be  benefited by this transfer, the interests of Spain would also be  greatly and essentially promoted.    She cannot but see that such a sum of money as we are willing to  pay for the island would affect it in the development of her vast  natural resources.    Two-thirds of this sum, if employed in the construction of a  system of railroads, would ultimately prove a source of greater  wealth to the Spanish people than that opened to their vision by  Cortez. Their prosperity would date from the ratification of the  treaty of cession.    France has already constructed continuous lines of railways from  Havre, Marseilles, Valenciennes, and Strasburg, via Paris, to the  Spanish frontier, and anxiously awaits the day when Spain shall  find herself in a condition to extend these roads through her  northern provinces to Madrid, Seville, Cadiz, Malaga, and the  frontiers of Portugal.    This object once accomplished, Spain would become a center of  attraction for the traveling world, and secure a permanent and  profitable market for her various productions. Her fields, under  the stimulus given to industry by remunerating prices, would teem  with cereal grain, and her vineyards would bring forth a vastly  increased quantity of choice wines. Spain would speedily become  what a bountiful Providence intended she should be, one of the  first nations of continental Europe--rich, powerful and contented.    Whilst two-thirds of the price of the island would be ample for  the completion of her most important public improvements, she  might with the remaining forty millions satisfy the demands now  pressing so heavily upon her credit, and create a sinking fund  which would gradually relieve her from the overwhelming debt now  paralyzing her energies.    Such is her present wretched financial condition, that her best  bonds are sold upon her own bourse at about one-third of their par  value; whilst another class, on which she pays no interest, have  but a nominal value, and are quoted at about one-sixth of the  amount for which they were issued. Besides, these latter are held  principally by British creditors, who may, from day to day, obtain  the effective interposition of their own government for the  purpose of coercing payment. Intimations to that effect have  already been thrown out from high quarters, and unless some new  sources of revenue shall enable Spain to provide for such  exigencies, it is not improbable that they may be realized.    Should Spain reject the present golden opportunity for developing  her resources and removing her financial embarrassments, it may  never again return.    Cuba, in her palmiest days, never yielded her exchequer, after  deducting the expense of its government, a clear annual income of  more than a million and a half of dollars. These expenses have  increased to such a degree as to leave a deficit, chargeable on  the treasury of Spain, to the amount of six hundred thousand  dollars.    In a pecuniary point of view, therefore, the island is an  encumbrance instead of a source of profit to the mother country.    Under no probable circumstance can Cuba ever yield to Spain one  per cent, on the large amount which the United States are willing  to pay for its"]]]
