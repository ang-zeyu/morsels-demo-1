He, whom I have made  The greatest of the great, and ever set  The nearest to my heart, and in this court  Allowed to play the master and the king.    BURLEIGH.  Yet in that very moment he betrayed you,  Betrayed you to this wily Queen of Scots.    ELIZABETH.  Oh, she shall pay me for it with her life!  Is the death-warrant ready?    BURLEIGH.                 'Tis prepared  As you commanded.    ELIZABETH.            She shall surely die--  He shall behold her fall, and fall himself!  I've driven him from my heart. No longer love,  Revenge alone is there: and high as once  He stood, so low and shameful be his fall!  A monument of my severity,  As once the proud example of my weakness.  Conduct him to the Tower; let a commission  Of peers be named to try him. He shall feel  In its full weight the rigor of the law.    BURLEIGH.  But he will seek thy presence; he will clear----    ELIZABETH.  How can he clear himself? Does not the letter  Convict him. Oh, his crimes are manifest!    BURLEIGH.  But thou art mild and gracious! His appearance,  His powerful presence----    ELIZABETH.               I will never see him;  No never, never more. Are orders given  Not to admit him should he come?    BURLEIGH.                   'Tis done.    PAGE (entering).  The Earl of Leicester!    ELIZABETH.              The presumptuous man!  I will not see him. Tell him that I will not.    PAGE.  I am afraid to bring my lord this message,  Nor would he credit it.    ELIZABETH.               And I have raised him  So high that my own servants tremble more  At him than me!    BURLEIGH (to the PAGE).           The queen forbids his presence.       [The PAGE retires slowly.    ELIZABETH (after a pause).  Yet, if it still were possible? If he  Could clear himself? Might it not be a snare  Laid by the cunning one, to sever me  From my best friends--the ever-treacherous harlot!  She might have writ the letter, but to raise  Poisonous suspicion in my heart, to ruin  The man she hates.    BURLEIGH.            Yet, gracious queen, consider.        SCENE VI.       LEICESTER (bursts open the door with violence,     and enters with an imperious air).    LEICESTER.  Fain would I see the shameless man who dares  Forbid me the apartments of my queen!    ELIZABETH (avoiding his sight).    Audacious slave!    LEICESTER.           To turn me from the door!    If for a Burleigh she be visible,  She must be so to me!    BURLEIGH.              My lord, you are  Too bold, without permission to intrude.    LEICESTER.  My lord, you are too arrogant, to take  The lead in these apartments. What! Permission!  I know of none who stands so high at court  As to permit my doings, or refuse them.       [Humbly approaching ELIZABETH.    'Tis from my sovereign's lips alone that I----    ELIZABETH (without looking at him).  Out of my sight, deceitful, worthless traitor!    LEICESTER.  'Tis not my gracious queen I hear, but Burleigh,  My enemy, in these ungentle words.  To my imperial mistress I appeal;  Thou hast lent him thine ear; I ask the like.    ELIZABETH.  Speak, shameless wretch! Increase your crime--deny it.    LEICESTER.  Dismiss this troublesome intruder first.  Withdraw, my lord; it is not of your office  To play the third man here: between the queen  And me there is no need of witnesses.  Retire----    ELIZABETH (to BURLEIGH).       Remain, my lord; 'tis my command.      LEICESTER.  What has a third to do 'twixt thee and me?  I have to clear myself before my queen,  My worshipped queen; I will maintain the rights  Which thou hast given me; these rights are sacred,  And I insist upon it, that my lord  Retire.    ELIZABETH.       This haughty tone befits you well.    LEICESTER.  It well befits me; am not I the man,  The happy man, to whom thy gracious favor  Has given the highest station? this exalts me  Above this Burleigh, and above them all.  Thy heart imparted me this rank, and what  Thy favor gave, by heavens I will maintain  At my life's hazard. Let him go, it needs  Two moments only to exculpate me.    ELIZABETH.  Think not, with cunning words, to hide the truth.    LEICESTER.  That fear from him, so voluble of speech:  But what I say is to the heart addressed;  And I will justify what I have dared  To do, confiding in thy generous favor,  Before thy heart alone. I recognize  No other jurisdiction.    ELIZABETH.              Base deceiver  'Tis this, e'en this, which above all condemns you.  My lord, produce the letter.       [To BURLEIGH.    BURLEIGH.                  Here it is.    LEICESTER (running over the letter without losing his presence of mind).  'Tis Mary Stuart's hand----    ELIZABETH.                Read and be dumb!    LEICESTER (having read it quietly).  Appearance is against me, yet I hope  I shall not by appearances be judged.    ELIZABETH.  Can you deny your secret correspondence  With Mary?--that she sent and you received  Her picture, that you gave her hopes of rescue?    LEICESTER.  It were an easy matter, if I felt  That I were guilty of a crime, to challenge  The testimony of my enemy:  Yet bold is my good conscience. I confess  That she hath said the truth.    ELIZABETH.                  Well then, thou wretch!    BURLEIGH.  His own words sentence him----    ELIZABETH.                 Out of my sight!  Away! Conduct the traitor to the Tower!    LEICESTER.  I am no traitor; it was wrong, I own,  To make a secret of this step to thee;  Yet pure was my intention, it was done  To search into her plots and to confound them.    ELIZABETH.  Vain subterfuge!    BURLEIGH.           And do you think, my lord----    LEICESTER.  I've played a dangerous game, I know it well,  And none but Leicester dare be bold enough  To risk it at this court. The world must know  How I detest this Stuart, and the rank  Which here I hold; my monarch's confidence,  With which she honors me, must sure suffice  To overturn all doubt of my intentions.  Well may the man thy favor above all  Distinguishes pursue a daring course  To do his duty!    BURLEIGH.           If the course was good,  Wherefore conceal it?    LEICESTER.              You are used, my lord,  To prate before you act; the very chime  Of your own deeds. This is your manner, lord;  But mine is first to act, and then to speak.    BURLEIGH.  Yes, now you speak because you must.    LEICESTER (measuring him proudly and disdainfully with his eyes).                     And you  Boast of a wonderful, a mighty action,  That you have saved the queen, have snatched away  The mask from treachery; all is known to you;  You think, forsooth, that nothing can escape  Your penetrating eyes. Poor, idle boaster!  In spite of all your cunning, Mary Stuart  Was free to-day, had I not hindered it.    BURLEIGH.                       How? You?    LEICESTER.  Yes, I, my lord; the queen confided  In Mortimer; she opened to the youth  Her inmost soul! Yes, she went further still;  She gave him, too, a secret, bloody charge,  Which Paulet had before refused with horror.  Say, is it so, or not?       [The QUEEN and BURLEIGH look at one another with astonishment.    BURLEIGH.              Whence know ye this?    LEICESTER.  Nay, is it not a fact? Now answer me.  And where, my lord, where were your thousand eyes,  Not to discover Mortimer was false?  That he, the Guise's tool, and Mary's creature,  A raging papist, daring fanatic,  Was come to free the Stuart, and to murder  The Queen of England!    ELIZABETH (with the utmost astonishment).              How! This Mortimer!    LEICESTER.  'Twas he through whom our correspondence passed.  This plot it was which introduced me to him.  This very day she was to have been torn  From her confinement; he, this very moment,  Disclosed his plan to me: I took him prisoner,  And gave him to the guard, when in despair  To see his work o'erturned, himself unmasked,  He slew himself!    ELIZABETH.           Oh, I indeed have been  Deceived beyond example, Mortimer!    BURLEIGH.  This happened then but now? Since last we parted?    LEICESTER.  For my own sake, I must lament the deed;  That he was thus cut off. His testimony,  Were he alive, had fully cleared my fame,  And freed me from suspicion; 'twas for this  That I surrendered him to open justice.  I thought to choose the most impartial course  To verify and fix my innocence  Before the world.    BURLEIGH.            He killed himself, you say  Is't so? Or did you kill him?    LEICESTER.                  Vile suspicion!  Hear but the guard who seized him.     [He goes to the door, and calls.                    Ho! who waits?     [Enter the officer of the guard.  Sir, tell the queen how Mortimer expired.    OFFICER.  I was on duty in the palace porch,  When suddenly my lord threw wide the door,  And ordered me to take the knight in charge,  Denouncing him a traitor: upon this  He grew enraged, and with most bitter curses  Against our sovereign and our holy faith,  He drew a dagger, and before the guards  Could hinder his intention, plunged the steel  Into his heart, and fell a lifeless corpse.    LEICESTER.  'Tis well; you may withdraw. Her majesty  Has heard enough.       [The officer withdraws.    ELIZABETH.              Oh, what a deep abyss  Of monstrous deeds?    LEICESTER.             Who was it, then, my queen,  Who saved you? Was it Burleigh? Did he know  The dangers which surrounded you? Did he  Avert them from your head? Your faithful Leicester  Was your good angel.    BURLEIGH.             This same Mortimer  Died most conveniently for you, my lord.    ELIZABETH.  What I should say I know not. I believe you,  And I believe you not. I think you guilty,  And yet I think you not. A curse on her  Who caused me all this anguish.    LEICESTER.                   She must die;  I now myself consent unto her death.

He can attribute to the active force the  extensiveness belonging to the passive force, he can encroach by the  formal impulsion on the material impulsion, and substitute the  determining for the receptive power. In the former case, he will never  be an Ego, a personality; in the second case, he will never be a Non-Ego,  and hence in both cases he will be neither the one nor the other,  consequently he will be nothing.    In fact, if the sensuous impulsion becomes determining, if the senses  become lawgivers, and if the world stifles personality, he loses as  object what he gains in force. It may be said of man that when he is  only the contents of time, he is not and consequently he has no other  contents. His condition is destroyed at the same time as his  personality, because these are two correlative ideas, because change  presupposes permanence, and a limited reality implies an infinite  reality. If the formal impulsion becomes receptive, that is, if thought  anticipates sensation, and the person substitutes itself in the place of  the world, it loses as a subject and autonomous force what it gains as  object, because immutability implies change, and that to manifest itself  also absolute reality requires limits. As soon as man is only form, he  has no form, and the personality vanishes with the condition. In a word,  it is only inasmuch as he is spontaneous, autonomous, that there is  reality out of him, that he is also receptive; and it is only inasmuch as  he is receptive that there is reality in him, that he is a thinking  force.    Consequently these two impulsions require limits, and looked upon as  forces, they need tempering; the former that it may not encroach on the  field of legislation, the latter that it may not invade the ground of  feeling. But this tempering and moderating the sensuous impulsion ought  not to be the effect of physical impotence or of a blunting of  sensations, which is always a matter for contempt. It must be a free  act, an activity of the person, which by its moral intensity moderates  the sensuous intensity, and by the sway of impressions takes from them in  depth what it gives them in surface or breadth. The character must place  limits to temperament, for the senses have only the right to lose  elements if it be to the advantage of the mind. In its turn, the  tempering of the formal impulsion must not result from moral impotence,  from a relaxation of thought and will, which would degrade humanity. It  is necessary that the glorious source of this second tempering should be  the fulness of sensations; it is necessary that sensuousness itself  should defend its field with a victorious arm and resist the violence  that the invading activity of the mind would do to it. In a word, it is  necessary that the material impulsion should be contained in the limits  of propriety by personality, and the formal impulsion by receptivity or  nature.          LETTER XIV.      We have been brought to the idea of such a correlation between the two  impulsions that the action of the one establishes and limits at the same  time the action of the other, and that each of them, taken in isolation,  does arrive at its highest manifestation just because the other is  active.    No doubt this correlation of the two impulsions is simply a problem  advanced by reason, and which man will only be able to solve in the  perfection of his being. It is in the strictest signification of the  term: the idea of his humanity; accordingly, it is an infinite to which  he can approach nearer and nearer in the course of time, but without ever  reaching it. \"He ought not to aim at form to the injury of reality, nor  to reality to the detriment of the form. He must rather seek the  absolute being by means of a determinate being, and the determinate being  by means of an infinite being. He must set the world before him because  he is a person, and he must be a person because he has the world before  him. He must feel because he has a consciousness of himself, and he must  have a consciousness of himself because he feels.\" It is only in  conformity with this idea that he is a man in the full sense of the word;  but he cannot be convinced of this so long as he gives himself up  exclusively to one of these two impulsions, or only satisfies them one  after the other. For as long as he only feels, his absolute personality  and existence remain a mystery to him, and as long as he only thinks, his  condition or existence in time escapes him. But if there were cases in  which he could have at once this twofold experience in which he would  have the consciousness of his freedom and the feeling of his existence  together, in which he would simultaneously feel as matter and know  himself as spirit, in such cases, and in such only, would he have a  complete intuition of his humanity, and the object that would procure him  this intuition would be a symbol of his accomplished destiny and  consequently serve to express the infinite to him--since this destination  can only be fulfilled in the fulness of time.    Presuming that cases of this kind could present themselves in experience,  they would awake in him a new impulsion, which, precisely because the  other two impulsions would co-operate in it, would be opposed to each of  them taken in isolation, and might, with good grounds, be taken for a new  impulsion. The sensuous impulsion requires that there should be change,  that time should have contents; the formal impulsion requires that time  should be suppressed, that there should be no change. Consequently, the  impulsion in which both of the others act in concert--allow me to call it  the instinct of play, till I explain the term--the instinct of play would  have as its object to suppress time in time, to conciliate the state of  transition or becoming with the absolute being, change with identity.    The sensuous instinct wishes to be determined, it wishes to receive an  object; the formal instinct wishes to determine itself, it wishes to  produce an object. Therefore the instinct of play will endeavor to  receive as it would itself have produced, and to produce as it aspires to  receive.    The sensuous impulsion excludes from its subject all autonomy and  freedom; the formal impulsion excludes all dependence and passivity. But  the exclusion of freedom is physical necessity; the exclusion of  passivity is moral necessity. Thus the two impulsions subdue the mind:  the former to the laws of nature, the latter to the laws of reason. It  results from this that the instinct of play, which unites the double  action of the two other instincts, will content the mind at once morally  and physically. Hence, as it suppresses all that is contingent, it will  also suppress all coercion, and will set man free physically and morally.  When we welcome with effusion some one who deserves our contempt, we feel  painfully that nature is constrained. When we have a hostile feeling  against a person who commands our esteem, we feel painfully the  constraint of reason. But if this person inspires us with interest, and  also wins our esteem, the constraint of feeling vanishes together with  the constraint of reason, and we begin to love him, that is to say, to  play, to take recreation, at once with our inclination and our esteem.    Moreover, as the sensuous impulsion controls us physically, and the  formal impulsion morally, the former makes our formal constitution  contingent, and the latter makes our material constitution contingent,  that is to say, there is contingence in the agreement of our happiness  with our perfection, and reciprocally. The instinct of play, in which  both act in concert, will render both our formal and our material  constitution contingent; accordingly, our perfection and our happiness in  like manner. And on the other hand, exactly because it makes both of  them contingent, and because the contingent disappears with necessity, it  will suppress this contingence in both, and will thus give form to matter  and reality to form. In proportion that it will lessen the dynamic  influence of feeling and passion, it will place them in harmony with  rational ideas, and by taking from the laws of reason their moral  constraint, it will reconcile them with the interest of the senses.          LETTER XV.      I approach continually nearer to the end to which I lead you, by a path  offering few attractions. Be pleased to follow me a few steps further,  and a large horizon will open up to you, and a delightful prospect will  reward you for the labor of the way.    The object of the sensuous instinct, expressed in a universal conception,  is named Life in the widest acceptation; a conception that expresses all  material existence and all that is immediately present in the senses.  The object of the formal instinct, expressed in a universal conception,  is called shape or form, as well in an exact as in an inexact  acceptation; a conception that embraces all formal qualities of things  and all relations of the same to the thinking powers. The object of the  play instinct, represented in a general statement, may therefore bear the  name of living form; a term that serves to describe all aesthetic  qualities of phenomena, and what people style, in the widest sense,  beauty.    Beauty is neither extended to the whole field of all living things nor  merely enclosed in this field. A marble block, though it is and remains  lifeless, can nevertheless become a living form by the architect and  sculptor; a man, though he lives and has a form, is far from being a  living form on that account. For this to be the case, it is necessary  that his form should be life, and that his life should be a form. As  long as we only think of his form, it is lifeless, a mere abstraction; as  long as we only feel his life, it is without form, a mere impression. It  is only when"]]]
