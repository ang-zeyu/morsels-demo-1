And without a doubt  he is under the protection of Satan. For a while ago he seemed tired,  resting by the wayside, and the village constables came to seize  him. But he suddenly kicked out with his hind legs and brayed in such  fearful fashion that they durst not to go near him. And that was no  bray of an ass, but the bray of the devil himself. So the constables  left him to browse among the thistles, and passed no sentence upon  him, nor did they burn him alive for a sorcerer as they should have  done. Verily these men have no courage.\"    Notwithstanding this brave talk, the donkey had only to prick up his  ears or flick his sides with his tail, to send the women running away  from him with cries of terror. Then back they would come, chattering  and jabbering, but ever ready to be off again if the donkey showed  the least sign of movement. Ulenspiegel could not help laughing at  the sight,    \"Ah!\" said he, \"talk and curiosity! They flow like an everlasting river  from the mouths of women--and especially old women, for with the young  the flow is less continuous by reason of their amorous occupations.\"    Then, considering the donkey:    \"This sorcerer-beast,\" said he to himself, \"is a sprightly ass without  a doubt, and a good goer. What if I were to take him for my own,  to ride, or maybe sell him?\"    Without another word Ulenspiegel went and got a feed of oats, and  returning, offered them to the donkey. But while he was eating of those  viands Ulenspiegel jumped nimbly upon his back, and taking the reins,  turned him first to the north, then to the east, and lastly to the  west. Then, when he had gone from them a little way, he raised his  hand as if in blessing on those aged dames. But they, almost fainting  with fear, fell upon their knees before him. And that evening when  they met together again, the tale was told of how an angel with a  felt hat trimmed with a pheasant's feather had come and blessed them,  and had taken off the magician's donkey by special favour of God.    And Ulenspiegel, astride of his ass, went his way through the green  fields, where the horse pranced about at liberty, where the cows and  heifers grazed at their ease or lay resting in the sunshine. And he  called the ass Jef.    At last Jef came to a stop, and began, as happy as could be, to  make his dinner off the thistles which grew in that place in great  abundance. But anon he shivered all over, and flicked his sides with  his tail in the hope of ridding himself of the greedy horse-flies who,  like himself, were trying to get their dinner, not off the thistles,  but off his own flesh.    Ulenspiegel, who himself began to feel the pangs of hunger, grew  very melancholy.    \"Happy indeed would you be, friend donkey, with your good dinner of  fine thistles if there was no one to disturb you in your pleasures,  and to remind you that you also are mortal, born, that is to say,  to the endurance of all kinds of villainies.\"    Thus did Ulenspiegel address his steed, and thus continued:    \"For even as you have this gadfly of yours to worry you, so also  hath His Holiness the Pope a gadfly of his own, even master Martin  Luther; and His Sacred Majesty the Emperor, hath he not my Lord of  France for his tormentor--Francis, first of that name, the King with  the very long nose and a sword that is longer still? And forsooth,  donkey mine, it is certainly permitted that I also, poor little man  wandering all alone, may have my gadfly too.    \"Alas! Woe is me! All my pockets have holes in them, and by the said  apertures do all my fine ducats and florins and daelders ramble away,  flying like a crowd of mice before the mouth of the cat that would  devour them. I wonder why it is that money will have nothing to do  with me--me that am so fond of money? Verily Fortune is no woman,  whatever they may say, for she loves none but greedy misers that shut  her up in their coffers, tie her up in sacks, close her down under  twenty keys and never let her show herself at the window by so much  as the little tip of her gilded nose! This, then, is the gadfly that  preys upon me and makes me itch, and tickles me without ever so much  as raising a laugh. But there, you are not listening to me at all,  friend donkey! And you think of nothing but your food. You gobbling  gobbler, your long ears are deaf to the cry of an empty stomach! But  you shall listen to me. I insist!\"    And he belaboured the ass as hard as he could, till the brute began  to bray.    \"Come, come, now that you have given us a song!\" cried Ulenspiegel. But  the donkey would not advance by more than a single step, and seemed  determined to go on eating thistles until he had consumed all that  grew by the roadside. And of these there was an abundance.    When Ulenspiegel saw what was happening he dismounted and cut off a  bunch of thistles; then, mounting the ass again, he placed the bunch  of thistles just in front of the animal's nose. And in this way,  leading the donkey by the nose, he arrived before long in the land  of the Landgrave of Hesse.    \"Friend donkey,\" he said as they went along, \"you, verily, go running  after a bunch of thistles, the meagre fare with which I have provided  you; but you leave behind the lovely road that is filled with all  kinds of most delicate herbs. And thus do all men, scenting out,  some of them, the bouquet called Fame which Fortune puts under their  nose, others the bouquet of Gain, and yet others the bouquet that is  called Love. But at the end of the journey they discover, like you,  that they have been pursuing things that are of little account,  and that they have left behind all that is worth anything--health,  and work, repose, happiness, and home.\"    In such discourse with his donkey Ulenspiegel came at last to the  palace of the Landgrave.    There two Captains of Artillery were playing dice upon the steps of  the palace, and one of them, a red-haired man of gigantic stature,  soon noticed Ulenspiegel as he approached modestly upon his ass,  gazing down upon them and their game.    \"What do you want,\" said the Captain, \"you, fellow, with your starved  pilgrim's face?\"    \"I am extremely hungry,\" answered Ulenspiegel, \"and if I am a pilgrim,  it is against my will.\"    \"And you are hungry,\" replied the Captain, \"go, eat the next gallows  cord you come to, for such cords are prepared for vagabonds like you.\"    \"Sir Captain,\" answered Ulenspiegel, \"only give me the fine golden  cord you wear on your hat, and I will go straightway and hang myself  by the teeth from that fat ham which I see hanging over there at  the cook-shop.\"    The Captain asked him where he came from. Ulenspiegel told him,  \"From Flanders.\"    \"What do you want?\"    \"To show His Highness the Landgrave one of my pictures. For I am  a painter.\"    \"If it is a painter that you are,\" said the Captain, \"and from  Flanders, come in, and I will lead you to my master.\"    When he had been brought before the Landgrave, Ulenspiegel saluted  thrice and again.    \"May your Highness deign,\" said he, \"to excuse my presumption in  daring to come and lay before these noble feet a picture I have made  for your Highness, wherein I have had the honour to portray Our Lady  the Virgin in her royal attire.\"    And then after a moment's pause:    \"It may be that my picture may please your Highness,\" he continued,  \"and in that case I am sufficiently presumptuous to hope that I  might aspire even unto this fine chair of velvet, where sat in his  lifetime the painter that is lately deceased and ever to be regretted  by your Magnanimity.\"    Now the picture which Ulenspiegel showed him was very beautiful,  and when the Landgrave had inspected it, he told Ulenspiegel to sit  down upon the chair, for that he would certainly make him his Court  Painter. And the Landgrave kissed him on both cheeks, most joyously,  and Ulenspiegel sat down on the chair.    \"Of a truth you are a very talkative fellow,\" said the Landgrave,  looking him up and down.    \"May it please your Lordship,\" answered Ulenspiegel, \"Jef--my  donkey--has dined most excellently well on thistles, but as for me  I have seen nothing but misery these three days past, and have had  nothing to nourish me but the mists of expectation.\"    \"You shall soon have some better fare than that,\" answered the  Landgrave. \"But where is this donkey of yours?\"    \"I left him on the Grande Place,\" Ulenspiegel said, \"opposite the  palace; and I should be most obliged if he could be given lodging  for the night--some straw and a little fodder.\"    The Landgrave immediately gave instructions to one of his pages that  Ulenspiegel's donkey should be treated even as his own.    The hour for supper soon arrived, and the meal was like a wedding  festival. Hot meats smoked in the dishes, wine flowed like water,  while Ulenspiegel and the Landgrave grew both as red as burning  coals. Ulenspiegel also became very merry, but His Highness was  somewhat pensive even in his cups.    \"Our painter,\" said he suddenly, \"will have to paint our portrait. For  it is a great satisfaction to a mortal prince to bequeath to his  descendants the memory of his countenance.\"    \"Sir Landgrave,\" answered Ulenspiegel, \"your will is my  pleasure. Nevertheless, I cannot help feeling sorry at the thought  that if your Lordship is painted by himself he will feel lonely,  perhaps, all there in solitary state through the ages to come. Surely  he should be accompanied by his noble wife, Madame the Landgravine,  by her lords and ladies, and by his captains and most warlike officers  of State. In the midst of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3760"],[0,"Sybil, Or, The Two Nations (#16)"],[1,"Lord Marney. \"It's very hard, don't you think so?\"    \"But these ricks were Bingley's?\"    \"But he was not insured, and he will want some reduction in his rent,  and if I do not see fit to allow it him, which I probably shall not, for  he ought to have calculated on these things, I have ricks of my own, and  they may be burnt any night.\"    \"But you, of course, are insured?\"    \"No, I am not; I calculate 'tis better to run the risk.\"    \"I wonder why ricks are burnt now, and were not in old days,\" said  Egremont.    \"Because there is a surplus population in the kingdom,\" said Lord  Marney, \"and no rural police in the county.\"    \"You were speaking of the election, George,\" said Egremont, not without  reluctance, yet anxious, as the ice had been broken, to bring the matter  to a result. Lord Marney, before the election, had written, in reply  to his mother consulting him on the step a letter with which she was  delighted, but which Egremont at the time could have wished to have been  more explicit. However in the excitement attendant on a first contest,  and influenced by the person whose judgment always swayed, and, in  the present case, was peculiarly entitled to sway him, he stifled his  scruples, and persuaded himself that he was a candidate not only with  the sanction, but at the instance, of his brother. \"You were speaking of  the election, George,\" said Egremont.    \"About the election, Charles. Well, the long and short of it is this:  that I wish to see you comfortable. To be harassed about money is one of  the most disagreeable incidents of life. It ruffles the temper, lowers  the spirits, disturbs the rest, and finally breaks up one's health.  Always, if you possibly can, keep square. And if by any chance you do  find yourself in a scrape, come to me. There is nothing under those  circumstances like the advice of a cool-headed friend.\"    \"As valuable as the assistance of a cold-hearted one,\" thought Egremont,  who did not fancy too much the tone of this conversation.    \"But there is one thing of which you must particularly beware,\"  continued Lord Marney, \"there is one thing worse even than getting into  difficulties--patching them up. The patching-up system is fatal; it is  sure to break down; you never get clear. Now, what I want to do for you,  Charles, is to put you right altogether. I want to see you square and  more than square, in a position which will for ever guarantee you from  any annoyance of this kind.\"    \"He is a good fellow after all,\" thought Egremont.    \"That thousand pounds of my mother was very a propos,\" said Lord Marney;  \"I suppose it was a sop that will keep them all right till we have made  our arrangements.\"    \"Oh! there is no pressure of that kind,\" said Egremont; \"if I see my  way, and write to them, of course they will be quite satisfied.\"    \"Excellent,\" said Lord Marney; \"and nothing could be more convenient to  me, for, between ourselves, my balances are very low at this moment.  The awful expenditure of keeping up this place! And then such terrible  incumbrances as I came to!\"    \"Incumbrances, George! Why, I thought you had not any. There was not a  single mortgage.\"    \"No mortgages; they are nothing; you find them, you get used to them,  and you calculate accordingly. You quite forget the portions for younger  children.\"    \"Yes; but you had plenty of ready money for them.\"    \"I had to pay them though,\" said Lord Marney. \"Had I not, I might have  bought Grimblethorpe with the money; such an opportunity will never  occur again.\"    \"But you talked of incumbrances,\" said Egremont.    \"Ah! my dear fellow,\" said Lord Marney, \"you don't know what it is to  have to keep up an estate like this; and very lucky for you. It is  not the easy life you dream of. There's buildings--I am ruined in  buildings--our poor dear father thought he left me Marney without an  incumbrance; why, there was not a barn on the whole estate that was  weather-proof; not a farm-house that was not half in ruins. What I have  spent in buildings! And draining! Though I make my own tiles, draining,  my dear fellow, is a something of which you have not the least idea!\"    \"Well,\" said Egremont, anxious to bring his brother back to the point,  \"you think, then, I had better write to them and say--\"    \"Ah! now for your business,\" said Lord Marney. \"Now, I will tell you  what I can do for you. I was speaking to Arabella about it last night;  she quite approves my idea. You remember the De Mowbrays? Well, we are  going to stay at Mowbray Castle, and you are to go with us. It is the  first time they have received company since their great loss. Ah! you  were abroad at the time, and so you are behind hand. Lord Mowbray's  only son, Fitz-Warene, you remember him, a deuced clever fellow, he died  about a year ago, in Greece, of a fever. Never was such a blow! His  two sisters, Lady Joan and Lady Maud, are looked upon as the greatest  heiresses in the kingdom; but I know Mowbray well; he will make an  eldest son of his eldest daughter. She will have it all; she is one of  Arabella's dearest friends; and you are to marry her.\"    Egremont stared at his brother, who patted him on the back with an  expression of unusual kindness, and adding, \"You have no idea what  a load this has taken off my mind, my dear Charles; so great has my  anxiety always been about you, particularly of late. To see you lord of  Mowbray Castle will realize my fondest hopes. That is a position fit for  a man, and I know none more worthy of it than yourself, though I am your  brother who say so. Now let us come and speak to Arabella about it.\"    So saying, Lord Marney, followed somewhat reluctantly by his brother,  advanced to the other end of the drawing-room, where his wife was  employed with her embroidery-frame, and seated next to her young friend,  Miss Poinsett, who was playing chess with Captain Grouse, a member of  the chess club, and one of the most capital performers extant.    \"Well, Arabella,\" said Lord Marney, \"it is all settled; Charles agrees  with me about going to Mowbray Castle, and I think the sooner we go the  better. What do you think of the day after to-morrow? That will suit me  exactly, and therefore I think we had better fix on it. We will consider  it settled.\"    Lady Marney looked embarrassed, and a little distressed. Nothing  could be more unexpected by her than this proposition; nothing more  inconvenient than the arrangement. It was very true that Lady Joan  Fitz-Warene had invited them to Mowbray, and she had some vague  intention, some day or other, of deliberating whether they should avail  themselves of this kindness; but to decide upon going, and upon going  instantly, without the least consultation, the least inquiry as to the  suitableness of the arrangement, the visit of Miss Poinsett abruptly  and ungraciously terminated, for example--all this was vexatious,  distressing: a mode of management which out of the simplest incidents  of domestic life contrived to extract some degree of perplexity and  annoyance.    \"Do not you think, George,\" said Lady Marney, \"that we had better talk  it over a little?\"    \"Not at all,\" said Lord Marney: \"Charles will go, and it quite suits me,  and therefore what necessity for any consultation?\"    \"Oh! if you and Charles like to go, certainly.\" said Lady Marney in a  hesitating tone; \"only I shall be very sorry to lose your society.\"    \"How do you mean lose our society Arabella? Of course you must go with  us. I particularly want you to go. You are Lady Joan's most intimate  friend; I believe there is no one she likes so much.\"    \"I cannot go the day after to-morrow,\" said Lady Marney, speaking in a  whisper, and looking volumes of deprecation.    \"I cannot help it,\" said Lord Marney; \"you should have told me this  before. I wrote to Mowbray to-day, that we should be with him the day  after to-morrow, and stay a week.\"    \"But you never mentioned it to me,\" said Lady Marney, slightly blushing  and speaking in a tone of gentle reproach.    \"I should like to know when I am to find time to mention the contents  of every letter I write,\" said Lord Marney; \"particularly with all the  vexatious business I have had on my hands to-day. But so it is; the more  one tries to save you trouble, the more discontented you get.\"    \"No, not discontented, George.\"    \"I do not know what you call discontented; but when a man has made every  possible arrangement to please you and every body, and all his plans are  to be set aside merely because the day he has fixed on does not exactly  suit your fancy, if that be not discontent, I should like very much to  know what is, Arabella.\"    Lady Marney did not reply. Always sacrificed, always yielding, the  moment she attempted to express an opinion, she ever seemed to assume  the position not of the injured but the injurer.    Arabella was a woman of abilities, which she had cultivated. She had  excellent sense, and possessed many admirable qualities; she was far  from being devoid of sensibility; but her sweet temper shrank from  controversy, and Nature had not endowed her with a spirit which could  direct and control. She yielded without a struggle to the arbitrary will  and unreasonable caprice of a husband, who was scarcely her equal in  intellect, and far her inferior in all the genial qualities of our  nature, but who governed her by his iron selfishness.    Lady Marney absolutely had no will of her own. A hard, exact, literal,  bustling, acute being environed her existence; directed, planned,  settled everything. Her life was a series of petty sacrifices and  baulked enjoyments. If her carriage were at the door, she was never  certain that she would not have to send it away; if she had asked some  friends to her house, the chances were she would have to put them off;  if she were reading a novel, Lord Marney asked her to copy a letter; if  she were going to the opera, she found that Lord Marney had got seats  for her and"]]]
