On being exposed to the air they soon      moulder away, which denotes the great length of time since their      interment. The disorderly manner in which these bones were found      to lie, being crosswise, commixed and mingled with every trait of      confusion, show them to have been deposited by a conquering enemy,      and not by friends, who would have laid them, as the custom of      all nations always has been, in a more deferential mode. There      was no appearance of a bullet having been the instrument of their      destruction, the evidence of which would have been broken limbs.      Smaller works of the same kind abound in the country about lake      Ontraio. [19] But the one of which we have just spoken is the most      remarkable. * * * * * * North of the mountain, or great slope      towards the lake, [Ontraio], there are no remains of ancient works      or tumuli, which strongly argues, that the mountain or ridgeway      once was the southern boundary or shore of lake Ontario; the waters      having receded from three to seven miles from its ancient shore,      nearly the whole length of the lake, occasioned by some strange      convulsion in nature, [20] redeeming much of the lands of the west      from the water that had covered it from the time of the deluge.\"      [21]    These described fortifications and burial mounds make it clear that  Central and Western New York at some time have been the scenes of  destructive battles; and the fact constitutes strong presumptive  evidence of the statements of the Book of Mormon that great battles  were fought there. The only thing which leads modern writers to ascribe  a comparatively recent date to the wars whereof central and western  New York was the battlefields is the discovery of glass, iron and  brass within these fortifications. It is assumed that these metals and  glass were unknown to the ancient Americans, hence Mr. Priest sets  forth the theory that the battles were fought between wild tribes of  Indians and Scandinavians. Instead of taking this view of the case,  however, I shall rely in part upon the finding of these implements made  of iron and brass as sustaining the statement of the Book of Mormon  that the Nephites were acquainted with and used these metals; but of  this I shall have more to say later, when considering the objections  urged against the Book of Mormon. Meantime I merely call attention to  the fact which here concerns me, namely, that central and western New  York constitute the great battle fields described in the Book of Mormon  as being the place where two nations met practical annihilation, the  Jaredites and Nephites; and of which the military fortifications and  monuments described by Mr. Priest are the silent witnesses.    II.    _Miscellaneous Book of Mormon Historical Incidents and Nephite_  Customs Found in the Native American Traditions.    Besides what has already been set forth on the confirmation of Nephite  historical incidents in native American traditions and mythologies,  there remains several other Lamanite and Nephite historical incidents  and customs, mentioned in the Book of Mormon, that are preserved in  the traditions of the native Americans, and which ought to receive  consideration here.    _Blood Drinking._    One of the customs of the Lamanites, in the matter of eating raw flesh  and drinking the blood of animals, is mentioned in the book of Enos,  where a description is given of the barbarity of the Lamanites as  follows:        And I bear record that the people of Nephi did seek diligently to      restore the Lamanites unto the true faith in God. But our labors      were vain; their hatred was fixed, and they were led by their evil      nature that they became wild, and ferocious, and a bloodthirsty      people; full of idolatry and filthiness: feeding upon beasts of      prey; dwelling in tents, and wandering about in the wilderness with      a short skin girdle about their loins and their heads shaven, and      their skill was in the bow, and in the cimeter, and the axe. And      many of them did eat nothing save it were raw meat. [22]    Jarom mentions substantially the same thing:        And they were scattered upon much of the face of the land; and the      Lamanites also. And they were exceeding more numerous than were      they of the Nephites; and they loved murder and would drink the      blood of beasts. [23]    Such the statement of the Book of Mormon. And now the native American  tradition bearing on this from Bancroft. Speaking of the Toltecs as an  enlightened race of native Americans, who are credited with the first  introduction of agriculture in America, our author says:        But even during this Toltec period hunting tribes, both of      Nahua and other blood, were pursuing their game in the forests      and mountains, especially in the northern region. Despised by      their more civilized, corn-eating brethren, they were known as      barbarians, dogs, Chichimecs, \"suckers of blood,\" from the custom      attributed to them of drinking blood and eating raw flesh. [24]    III.    __Human Sacrifices. Cannibalism.__    Another statement in the Book of Mormon with reference to a Lamanite  custom concerning their treatment of prisoners taken in war is as  follows. Speaking of an invasion of the Lamanites into Nephite  territory the Book of Mormon says:        And they did also march forward against the city of Teancum,      and did drive the inhabitants forth out of her, and did take      many prisoners both women and children, and did offer them up      as sacrifices unto their idol gods. And it came to pass that      in the three hundred and sixty and seventh years, [A. D.], the      Nephites being angry because the Lamanites had scattered their      women and their children, that they did go against the Lamanites      with exceeding great anger, insomuch that they did beat again the      Lamanites, and drive them out of their lands. [25]    Later, referring to a second invasion of the Nephite lands, Mormon also  says:        And when they had come the second time, the Nephites were driven      and slaughtered with an exceeding great slaughter; their women and      their children were again sacrificed unto idols. [26]    Some years later, Mormon, in an epistle to his son Moroni, speaking of  the awful depravity which characterized both Nephites and Lamanites,  says of them: \"They thirst after blood and revenge continually.\" [27]  Of the treatment of certain prisoners taken from one of the cities he  also says:        And the husbands and fathers of those women and children they have      slain; and they feed the women upon the flesh of their husbands,      and the children upon the flesh of their fathers; and no water,      save a little, do they give unto them. [28]    He describes how the Nephites defiled the daughters of Lamanite  prisoners, and then continues:        And after they had done this thing, they did murder them in a most      cruel manner, torturing their bodies, even unto death; and after      they have done this, they devour their flesh like unto wild beasts,      because of the hardness of their hearts; and they do it for a token      of bravery. [29]    This, doubtless, was the beginning--in the later part of the fourth  century A. D., \"not early in the fourteenth century,\" as held by  Prescott [30]--of those horrible human sacrifices and acts of  cannibalism found among the Aztecs at the time of the Spanish invasion  of Mexico, and which so shocked even the cruel Spaniards. Bancroft, in  telling of the treatment of prisoners taken in war among the Aztecs,  describes an unequal battle for life that was sometimes accorded the  male prisoners, and then adds:        Those who were too faint-hearted to attempt this hopless combat,      had their hearts torn out at once, whilst the others were      sacrificed only after having been subdued by the braves. The      bleeding and quivering heart was held up to the sun and then thrown      into a bowl, prepared for its reception. An assistant priest sucked      the blood from the gash in the chest through a hollow cane, the      end of which he elevated towards the sun, and then discharged      its contents into a plume-bordered cup held by the captor of the      prisoner just slain. This cup was carried round to all the idols in      the temples and chapels, before whom another blood-filled tube was      held up as if to give them a taste of the contents; this ceremony      performed, the cup was left at the Palace. The corpse was taken      to the chapel where the captive had watched and there flayed, the      flesh being consumed at a banquet as before. The skin was given to      certain priests, or college youths, who went from house to house      dressed in the ghastly garb, with the arms swinging, singing,      dancing, and asking for contributions; those who refused to give      anything received a stroke in the face from the dangling arm. [31]    Prescott, referring to the chief object of war among the Aztecs, and  the treatment of prisoners taken, says:        The tutelary deity of the Aztecs was the god of war. A great object      of their military expeditions was, to gather hecatombs of captives      for his altars. * * * * * * At the head of all, [i. e., all the      Aztec deities] stood the terrible Huitzilopotchli. * * * * * * *      This was the patron deity of the nation. His fantastic image was      loaded with costly ornaments. His temples were the most stately      and august of the public edifices; and his altars reeked with the      blood of human hecatombs in every city of the empire. * * * * * The      most loathsome part of the story--the manner "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/59970"],[0,"The Life of Joseph Smith, the Prophet (#16)"],[1,"sympathy with them. The baffled mob,  more enraged than ever, pursued the wagon a considerable distance,  but were unable to overtake it; and the constable soon reached South  Bainbridge, in Chenango County, with his prisoner. The hour was late  and they went to an inn, where they were lodged in an upper room.  Joseph occupied a bed and slept peacefully, after communing silently  with his Maker. The officer threw his body across the entrance to the  room, and slumbered lightly. He held a loaded musket in his hands ready  to defend his prisoner from unlawful assault.    The next day was a time of intense excitement. A court was convened  to consider the strange charges brought against the young man, Joseph  Smith; and hateful lies, of every form which the father of falsehood  could devise, were circulated to create popular dislike. But Joseph  Knight appeared at the court with two of his neighbors, James Davidson  and John Reid, outspoken men, learned in the law and standing high  in public esteem, who were to appear on behalf of the Prophet. The  bitter feeling of endangered priestcraft was visible throughout the  trial; but all the accusations which were made were but lies, and none  were sustained. The court declared an acquittal. The evidence in the  trial was a high tribute to the character of Joseph Smith. Evidently  preparations had been made to deal his influence a fatal blow; and  people were brought from great distances who knew him intimately as a  boy and as a young man. It was hoped by the inciters of the outrage  that these former neighbors of Joseph would heed the public clamor  against him and testify that his nature was evil. But on the contrary,  all these witnesses declared that in all their intercourse with the  Prophet, his life had been above reproach.    Unheeding this emphatic demonstration in Joseph's behalf, his enemies  determined that they would not withhold their hands. They declared  that he had committed other offenses in Broome County, and they must  have a warrant for him in the interest of the public weal. This paper  was secured on the oath of a sectarian bigot; and no sooner was Joseph  acquitted by the court in Chenango County, than he was seized under the  new warrant and dragged back to Colesville. The officer in charge this  time was a sympathizer with the mob. He refused food to his prisoner  and refused to allow him to call at the houses of his friends, or to  see his wife. This constable carried him to a tavern, and then invited  a number of persons to unite in abuse and ridicule of the Prophet. The  rabble jeered and spat upon their victim. They pointed their fingers  at him, crying, \"Prophesy! Prophesy!\" Joseph offered security for his  appearance on the following day, and asked to be released; but the  officer would not consent. The only favor which he would grant to  Joseph was to bring to him a cup of water and a crust of bread.    When the morning came, Joseph was arraigned before the magistrate's  court of Colesville. Arrayed against him were some of the people who  had been discomfited at the trial in Chenango County. This time they  were determined to secure a conviction. By the side of the Prophet  were his friends and advocates who had aided him in the former trial.  Despite the vindictive effort of the mob, the court discharged the  Prophet, declaring that nothing was shown to his dishonor. Even the  cruel constable who had abused his little authority to make Joseph's  lot more miserable, became convinced of the entire innocence of his  charge; and he besought the forgiveness of his former prisoner. He gave  information to Joseph that a plot was in progress to secure his person.    The inciters of these outrages were two prominent Presbyterians of that  region--Cyrus McMaster and one Dr. Boyington. The creature whom they  secured to make oath against Joseph was also a Presbyterian; his name  was Benton.    The honest and courageous man John Reid, who successfully defended the  Prophet before the courts, himself had testified to the remarkable  manner in which he was engaged in the case. A messenger came to his  house and requested him to appear before the magistrate on behalf of  Joseph Smith. Mr. Reid was busy at the time; he had never seen the  young man Joseph Smith; and he determined not to enter the case. But  before he could decline aloud, a low, strange voice uttered these  words: \"YOU MUST GO TO DELIVER THE LORD'S ANOINTED!\" He was thrilled  with awe at the mysterious sound. He knew that the messenger had not  spoken; and upon inquiry Mr. Reid learned that the voice had been to  himself alone. The impression caused by this experience was such that  Mr. Reid hastened to the place of trial. While he was engaged in the  case his mysterious emotion increased; and when he arose to defend the  Prophet in argument, he was inspired to an eloquence beyond himself,  and which was irresistible. [1]    When Joseph was freed from custody after the second trial, the  constable extended his aid; and thus the Prophet was enabled to escape  while his enemies were organizing unlawfully to get him into their  clutches. Joseph had been two days without food; and when released, his  friends told him that he must flee at once, for the mob had organized  and was determined. Night had already come; and he traveled until  daylight the next morning, when he reached a place of safety at the  house of an acquaintance many miles distant from Colesville. Here he  found Emma, and they journeyed to Harmony without further molestation.  But a few days later, when he returned to Colesville to confirm the  persons who had been baptized, the mob assailed him with greater  violence than ever before; and it was with difficulty that his friends  aided him to preserve his life from the attacks of the sectarian  priests through their bigoted followers.    Upon returning once more to Harmony after this last visit to  Colesville, the Prophet engaged in the labor of making a record in  proper order of the revelations which had come to him from the Lord. In  this work he was aided for a time by Oliver Cowdery; but later Oliver  went to Fayette, and Emma, under commandment of the Lord, once more  served her husband as a scribe.    While Joseph was thus laboring in Pennsylvania, Parley P. Pratt visited  Fayette to learn something of the young Prophet. Not finding Joseph,  the seeker after truth made his investigations alone. He became  convinced that he had found the gospel; and he asked and received  baptism at the hands of Oliver Cowdery in Seneca Lake.    This was a momentous event.    Footnotes    1. It is worthy of notice here that Hon. Amos Reid, who, in early days,  was secretary and, part of the time, acting Governor of Utah Territory,  was the son of this honest man, John Reid, and always referred with  pleasure and pride to the part his father took in behalf of the Prophet  on these occasions.        CHAPTER XIV.    DISSENSIONS WITHIN THE FOLD--OLIVER COWDERY AND HIRAM PAGE LEAD THE  WHITMERS ASTRAY--MOBS AT COLESVILLE AND PERSECUTION AT HARMONY--ISAAC  HALE AND HIS FAMILY OPPOSE JOSEPH--THE PROPHET REMOVES TO FAYETTE--  PROPHETIC OUTLINE OF THE GATHERING.    The peaceful and blessed hours which the Prophet had hoped to enjoy in  the performance of his holy work at his home in Harmony, were quickly  intruded upon. Satan had been able already to excite Joseph's enemies  to a frenzy, and to make the conversion of even honest inquirers  difficult, and in many cases impossible. Not satisfied with this,  the evil one stirred up the hearts of some of Joseph's friends and  associates to feelings of jealous vanity and fear.    Oliver Cowdery, at Fayette, was the first victim within the fold of the  assaults of the adversary. While the Prophet, aided by his wife, was  transcribing the revelations, he received a startling letter, couched  in stern and disrespectful terms, addressed to him by Oliver from  Fayette. The letter demanded that Joseph should erase certain words  from one of the commandments given by God to the Church, alleging that  they had been incorrectly written. The Prophet was shocked and grieved,  because he saw therein the snare which Satan had set for the feet of  some of the flock of Christ. He knew, too, how prone Oliver was to be  lifted up in the pride of his heart; and he saw in this a concession to  evil by Oliver which must soon be checked and withdrawn, or Oliver, and  those who had sympathy for him, would soon be cast out. Joseph wrote a  letter, full of loving admonition, and yet rebuking firmly the error  to which Oliver was yielding. Joseph informed him that the revelation  had been correctly written--it was the command of God, and no man had  authority to take from it a single word.    Joseph soon followed his letter and visited his associates at Fayette.  He found there a most deplorable state of affairs. Oliver Cowdery  had yielded to the power of darkness. In the vanity of his heart he  had set himself up against the Prophet of the Lord, and by skillful  persuasion and flattery, had succeeded in winning the Whitmers to a  belief in his views. Joseph felt that they were hardened toward him,  and that the spirit which possessed them must at once be subdued and  cast out, else they would be lost to the cause of Christ. He prayed  for help, and labored earnestly and lovingly to show to Oliver and  the others the error of their way. None of them at first would listen  to his words. The influence which possessed them was perfectly aware  that if they gave attention to Joseph's words they would soon discover  their mistake; and it encouraged in them an obstinate and hateful  feeling. After some time Christian Whitmer became convinced of their  error. He saw the abyss into which the archenemy had endeavored to  drag him; and he joined with Joseph in supplication to the Lord that  his father and brothers and Oliver Cowdery might be turned aside from  their evil"]]]
