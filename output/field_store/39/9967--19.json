[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6593"],[0,"History of Tom Jones, a Foundling (#16)"],[1," certainly now hated Mrs Wilkins; and  though she did not, or possibly could not, absolutely remove her from  her place, she found, however, the means of making her life very  uneasy. This Mrs Wilkins, at length, so resented, that she very openly  showed all manner of respect and fondness to little Tommy, in  opposition to Mrs Blifil.    The captain, therefore, finding the story in danger of perishing, at  last took an opportunity to reveal it himself.    He was one day engaged with Mr Allworthy in a discourse on charity: in  which the captain, with great learning, proved to Mr Allworthy, that  the word charity in Scripture nowhere means beneficence or generosity.    \"The Christian religion,\" he said, \"was instituted for much nobler  purposes, than to enforce a lesson which many heathen philosophers had  taught us long before, and which, though it might perhaps be called a  moral virtue, savoured but little of that sublime, Christian-like  disposition, that vast elevation of thought, in purity approaching to  angelic perfection, to be attained, expressed, and felt only by grace.  Those,\" he said, \"came nearer to the Scripture meaning, who understood  by it candour, or the forming of a benevolent opinion of our brethren,  and passing a favourable judgment on their actions; a virtue much  higher, and more extensive in its nature, than a pitiful distribution  of alms, which, though we would never so much prejudice, or even ruin  our families, could never reach many; whereas charity, in the other  and truer sense, might be extended to all mankind.\"    He said, \"Considering who the disciples were, it would be absurd to  conceive the doctrine of generosity, or giving alms, to have been  preached to them. And, as we could not well imagine this doctrine  should be preached by its Divine Author to men who could not practise  it, much less should we think it understood so by those who can  practise it, and do not.    \"But though,\" continued he, \"there is, I am afraid, little merit in  these benefactions, there would, I must confess, be much pleasure in  them to a good mind, if it was not abated by one consideration. I  mean, that we are liable to be imposed upon, and to confer our  choicest favours often on the undeserving, as you must own was your  case in your bounty to that worthless fellow Partridge: for two or  three such examples must greatly lessen the inward satisfaction which  a good man would otherwise find in generosity; nay, may even make him  timorous in bestowing, lest he should be guilty of supporting vice,  and encouraging the wicked; a crime of a very black dye, and for which  it will by no means be a sufficient excuse, that we have not actually  intended such an encouragement; unless we have used the utmost caution  in chusing the objects of our beneficence. A consideration which, I  make no doubt, hath greatly checked the liberality of many a worthy  and pious man.\"    Mr Allworthy answered, \"He could not dispute with the captain in the  Greek language, and therefore could say nothing as to the true sense  of the word which is translated charity; but that he had always  thought it was interpreted to consist in action, and that giving alms  constituted at least one branch of that virtue.    \"As to the meritorious part,\" he said, \"he readily agreed with the  captain; for where could be the merit of barely discharging a duty?  which,\" he said, \"let the word charity have what construction it  would, it sufficiently appeared to be from the whole tenor of the New  Testament. And as he thought it an indispensable duty, enjoined both  by the Christian law, and by the law of nature itself; so was it  withal so pleasant, that if any duty could be said to be its own  reward, or to pay us while we are discharging it, it was this.    \"To confess the truth,\" said he, \"there is one degree of generosity  (of charity I would have called it), which seems to have some show of  merit, and that is, where, from a principle of benevolence and  Christian love, we bestow on another what we really want ourselves;  where, in order to lessen the distresses of another, we condescend to  share some part of them, by giving what even our own necessities  cannot well spare. This is, I think, meritorious; but to relieve our  brethren only with our superfluities; to be charitable (I must use the  word) rather at the expense of our coffers than ourselves; to save  several families from misery rather than hang up an extraordinary  picture in our houses or gratify any other idle ridiculous  vanity--this seems to be only being human creatures. Nay, I will  venture to go farther, it is being in some degree epicures: for what  could the greatest epicure wish rather than to eat with many mouths  instead of one? which I think may be predicated of any one who knows  that the bread of many is owing to his own largesses.    \"As to the apprehension of bestowing bounty on such as may hereafter  prove unworthy objects, because many have proved such; surely it can  never deter a good man from generosity. I do not think a few or many  examples of ingratitude can justify a man's hardening his heart  against the distresses of his fellow-creatures; nor do I believe it  can ever have such effect on a truly benevolent mind. Nothing less  than a persuasion of universal depravity can lock up the charity of a  good man; and this persuasion must lead him, I think, either into  atheism, or enthusiasm; but surely it is unfair to argue such  universal depravity from a few vicious individuals; nor was this, I  believe, ever done by a man, who, upon searching his own mind, found  one certain exception to the general rule.\" He then concluded by  asking, \"who that Partridge was, whom he had called a worthless  fellow?\"    \"I mean,\" said the captain, \"Partridge the barber, the schoolmaster,  what do you call him? Partridge, the father of the little child which  you found in your bed.\"    Mr Allworthy exprest great surprize at this account, and the captain  as great at his ignorance of it; for he said he had known it above a  month: and at length recollected with much difficulty that he was told  it by Mrs Wilkins.    Upon this, Wilkins was immediately summoned; who having confirmed what  the captain had said, was by Mr Allworthy, by and with the captain's  advice, dispatched to Little Baddington, to inform herself of the  truth of the fact: for the captain exprest great dislike at all hasty  proceedings in criminal matters, and said he would by no means have Mr  Allworthy take any resolution either to the prejudice of the child or  its father, before he was satisfied that the latter was guilty; for  though he had privately satisfied himself of this from one of  Partridge's neighbours, yet he was too generous to give any such  evidence to Mr Allworthy.        Chapter vi.    The trial of Partridge, the schoolmaster, for incontinency; the  evidence of his wife; a short reflection on the wisdom of our law;  with other grave matters, which those will like best who understand  them most.      It may be wondered that a story so well known, and which had furnished  so much matter of conversation, should never have been mentioned to Mr  Allworthy himself, who was perhaps the only person in that country who  had never heard of it.    To account in some measure for this to the reader, I think proper to  inform him, that there was no one in the kingdom less interested in  opposing that doctrine concerning the meaning of the word charity,  which hath been seen in the preceding chapter, than our good man.  Indeed, he was equally intitled to this virtue in either sense; for as  no man was ever more sensible of the wants, or more ready to relieve  the distresses of others, so none could be more tender of their  characters, or slower to believe anything to their disadvantage.    Scandal, therefore, never found any access to his table; for as it  hath been long since observed that you may know a man by his  companions, so I will venture to say, that, by attending to the  conversation at a great man's table, you may satisfy yourself of his  religion, his politics, his taste, and indeed of his entire  disposition: for though a few odd fellows will utter their own  sentiments in all places, yet much the greater part of mankind have  enough of the courtier to accommodate their conversation to the taste  and inclination of their superiors.    But to return to Mrs Wilkins, who, having executed her commission with  great dispatch, though at fifteen miles distance, brought back such a  confirmation of the schoolmaster's guilt, that Mr Allworthy determined  to send for the criminal, and examine him _viva voce_. Mr Partridge,  therefore, was summoned to attend, in order to his defence (if he  could make any) against this accusation.    At the time appointed, before Mr Allworthy himself, at Paradise-hall,  came as well the said Partridge, with Anne, his wife, as Mrs Wilkins  his accuser.    And now Mr Allworthy being seated in the chair of justice, Mr  Partridge was brought before him. Having heard his accusation from the  mouth of Mrs Wilkins, he pleaded not guilty, making many vehement  protestations of his innocence.    Mrs Partridge was then examined, who, after a modest apology for being  obliged to speak the truth against her husband, related all the  circumstances with which the reader hath already been acquainted; and  at last concluded with her husband's confession of his guilt.    Whether she had forgiven him or no, I will not venture to determine;  but it is certain she was an unwilling witness in this cause; and it  is probable from certain other reasons, would never have been brought  to depose as she did, had not Mrs Wilkins, with great art, fished all  out of her at her own house, and had she not indeed made promises, in  Mr Allworthy's name, that the punishment of her husband should not be  such as might anywise affect his family.    Partridge still persisted in asserting his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6603"],[0,"Our Legal Heritage : 600-1776 King Aethelbert - King George III (#16)"],[1,"fast right  law, and to utterly forbid rapine and unrighteous judgments. This  was in keeping with the traditional oath of a new king.    Declaring the English who fought against him to be traitors, the  Conquerer declared their land confiscated. But he allowed those  who were willing to acknowledge him to redeem their land by a  payment of money. As William conquered the land of the realm, he  parceled it out among the barons who fought with him so that each  baron was given the holdings of an Anglo-Saxon predecessor,  scattered though they were. The barons again made oaths of  personal loyalty to him [fealty]. They agreed to hold the land as  his vassals with future military services to him and receipt of  his protection. They gave him homage by placing their hands within  his and saying \"I become your man for the tenement I hold of you,  and I will bear you faith in life and member [limb] and earthly  honor against all men\". They held their land \"of their lord\", the  King, by knight's service. The king had \"enfeoffed\" them [given  them a fief: a source of income] with land. The theory that by  right all land was the King's and that land was held by others  only at his gift and in return for specified service was new to  English thought. The original duration of a knight's fee until  about 1100 was for his life; thereafter it was heritable. The word  \"knight\" came to replace the word \"thegn\" as a person who received  his position and land by fighting for the King. The exact  obligation of knight's service was to furnish a fully-armed  horseman to serve at his own expense for forty days in the year.  This service was not limited to defense of the country, but  included fighting abroad. The baron led his own knights under his  banner. The foot soldiers were from the fyrd or were mercenaries.  Every free man was sworn to join in the defense of the king, his  lands and his honor, within England and without.    The Saxon governing class was destroyed. The independent power of  earls, who had been drawn from three great family houses, was  curtailed. Most died or fled the country. Some men were allowed to  redeem their land by money payment if they showed loyalty to the  Conquerer. Well-born women crowded into nunneries to escape Norman  violence. The people were deprived of their most popular leaders,  who were excluded from all positions of trust and profit,  especially all the clergy. The earldoms became fiefs instead of  magistracies.    The Conquerer was a stern and fierce man and ruled as an autocrat  by terror. Whenever the people revolted or resisted his mandates,  he seized their lands or destroyed the crops and laid waste the  countryside and so that they starved to death. His rule was  strong, resolute, wise, and wary because he had learned to command  himself as well as other men. He was not arbitrary or oppressive.  The Conquerer had a strict system of policing the nation. Instead  of the Anglo-Saxon self-government throughout the districts and  hundreds of resident authorities in local courts, he aimed at  substituting for it the absolute rule of the barons under military  rule so favorable to the centralizing power of the Crown. He used  secret police and spies and the terrorism this system involved.  This especially curbed the minor barons and preserved the public  peace.    The English people, who outnumbered the Normans by 300 to 1, were  disarmed. Curfew bells were rung at 7:00 PM when everyone had to  remain in their own dwellings on pain of death and all fires and  candles were to be put out. This prevented any nightly gatherings,  assassinations, or seditions. Order was brought to the kingdom so  that no man dare kill another, no matter how great the injury he  had received. The Conquerer extended the King's peace on the  highways, i.e. roads on high ground, to include the whole nation.  Any individual of any rank could travel from end to end of the  land unharmed. Before, prudent travelers would travel only in  groups of twenty.    The barons subjugated the English who were on their newly acquired  land. There began a hierarchy of seisin [rightful occupation] of  land so that there could be no land without its lord. Also, every  lord had a superior lord with the king as the overlord or supreme  landlord. One piece of land may be held by several tenures. For  instance, A, holding by barons's service of the King, may enfeoff  B, a church, to hold of him on the terms of praying for the souls  of his ancestors, and B may enfeoff a freeman C to hold of the  church by giving it a certain percentage of his crops every year.  There were about 200 barons who held land directly of the King.  Other fighting men were the knights, who were tenants or  subtenants of a baron. Knighthood began as a reward for valor on  the field of battle by the king or a noble. The value of a  knight's fee was 400s. [20 pounds] per year. Altogether there were  about 5000 fighting men holding land.    The essence of Norman feudalism was that the land remained under  the lord, whatever the vassal might do. The lord had the duty to  defend the vassals on his land. The vassal owed military service  to the lord and also the service of attending the courts of the  hundred and the county [formerly \"shire\"], which were courts of  the King, administering old customary law. They were the King's  courts on the principle that a crime anywhere was a breach of the  King's peace. The King's peace that had covered his residence and  household had extended to places where he might travel, such as  highways, rivers, bridges, churches, monasteries, markets, and  towns, and then encompassed every place, replacing the general  public peace. Infraction of the King's peace incurred fines to  the King.    This feudal bond based on occupancy of land rather than on  personal ties was uniform throughout the realm. No longer could a  man choose his lord and transfer his land with him to a new lord.  He held his land at the will of his lord, to be terminated anytime  the lord decided to do so. A tenant could not alienate his land  without permission of his lord. In later eras, tenancies would be  held for the life of the tenant, and even later, for his life and  those of his heirs.    This uniformity of land organization plus the new requirement that  every freeman take an oath of loyalty directly to the king to  assist him in preserving his lands and honor and defending him  against his enemies, which oath would supersede any oath to any  other man, gave the nation a new unity. The king could call men  directly to the fyrd, summon them to his court, and tax them  without intervention of their lords. And the people learned to  look to the king for protection from abuse by their lords.    English villani, bordarii, cottarii, and servi on the land of the  barons were subjugated into a condition of \"villeinage\" servitude  and became \"tied to the land\" so that they could not leave the  land without their lord's permission, except to go on a  pilgrimage. The villeins formed a new bottom class as the  population's percentage of slaves declined dramatically. They held  their land of their lord, the baron. To guard against uprisings of  the conquered people, the barons used villein labor to build about  a hundred great stone castles, with moats and walls with towers  around them, at easily defensible positions such as hilltops all  over the nation.    A castle could be built only with permission of the King. A  typical castle had a stone building of about four floors [a keep]  on a small, steep hill. Later it also had an open area surrounded  by a stone curtain-wall with towers at the corners. Around the  outside of the wall were ditches and banks and perhaps a moat. One  traveled over these via a drawbridge let down at the gatehouse of  the enclosing wall. On either side of the gatehouse were chambers  for the guards. Arrows could be shot through slits in the  enclosing walls. Inside the enclosed area might be stables, a  granary, barracks for the soldiers, and workshops. The only winter  feed was hay, for which the horses, breeding animals, milk-cow,  and work-oxen had a priority over other animals. The bulk of the  cattle were usually slaughtered and salted.    The castle building typically was entered by an outer wood  staircase to the guard room on the second floor. The first  [ground] floor had a well and was used as a storehouse and/or  dungeons for prisoners. The second floor had a two-storied great  hall, with small rooms and aisles around it within the thick  walls. There was also a chapel area on the second floor. There  were small areas of the third floor which could be used for  sleeping. The floors were wood and were reached by a spiral stone  staircase in one corner of the building. Sometimes there was a  reservoir of water on an upper level with pipes carrying the water  to floors below. Each floor had a fireplace with a slanted flue  going through the wall to the outside. There were latrines in the  corner walls with a pit or shaft down the exterior of the wall,  sometimes to the moat. Furs and wool clothes were hung on the  walls there in the summer to deter the moths. The first floor had  only arrow slits in the walls, but the higher floors had small  windows.    Some curtain-wall castles did not have a central building. In  these, the hall was built along the inside of the walls, as were  other continuous buildings. The kitchens and chapels were in the  towers. Lodgings were in buildings along the curtain-walls, or on  several floors of the towers.    The great hall was the main room of the castle. The hall was used  for meals and meetings at which the lord received homages,  recovered fees, and held the view of frankpledge [free pledge in  Latin], in which freemen agreed to be sureties for each other. At  the main table, the lord and his lady sat on benches with backs or  chairs. The table was covered first with a wool cloth that"]]]
