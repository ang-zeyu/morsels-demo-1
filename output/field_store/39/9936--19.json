For they will  have it that air passes through this vessel from the lungs into  the left ventricle; that fuliginous vapours escape by it from the  heart into the lungs; and that a portion of the spirituous blood  is distributed to the lungs for their refreshment.    If they will have it that fumes and air--fumes flowing from, air  proceeding towards the heart--are transmitted by the same  conduit, I reply, that nature is not wont to construct but one  vessel, to contrive but one way for such contrary motions and  purposes, nor is anything of the kind seen elsewhere.    If fumes or fuliginous vapours and air permeate this vessel, as  they do the pulmonary bronchia, wherefore do we find neither air  nor fuliginous vapours when we divide the pulmonary vein? Why do  we always find this vessel full of sluggish blood, never of air,  whilst in the lungs we find abundance of air remaining?    If any one will perform Galen's experiment of dividing the  trachea of a living dog, forcibly distending the lungs with a  pair of bellows, and then tying the trachea securely, he will  find, when he has laid open the thorax, abundance of air in the  lungs, even to their extreme investing tunic, but none in either  the pulmonary veins or the left ventricle of the heart. But did  the heart either attract air from the lungs, or did the lungs  transmit any air to the heart, in the living dog, much more ought  this to be the case in the experiment just referred to. Who,  indeed, doubts that, did he inflate the lungs of a subject in the  dissecting--room, he would instantly see the air making its way  by this route, were there actually any such passage for it? But  this office of the pulmonary veins, namely, the ransference of  air from the lungs of the heart, is held of such importance, that  Hieronymus Fabricius of Aquapendente, contends that the lungs  were made for the sake of this vessel, and that it constitutes  the principal element in their structure. But I should like to be  informed why, if the pulmonary vein were destined for the  conveyance of air, it has the structure of a blood--vessel here.  Nature had rather need of annular tubes, such as those of the  bronchi in order that they might always remain open, and not be  liable to collapse; and that they might continue entirely free  from blood, lest the liquid should interfere with the passage of  the air, as it so obviously does when the lungs labour from being  either greatly oppressed or loaded in a less degree with phlegm,  as they are when the breathing is performed with a sibilous or  rattling noise.    Still less is that opinion to be tolerated which, as a two-fold  material, one aerial, one sanguineous, is required for the  composition of vital spirits, supposes the blood to ooze through  the septum of the heart from the right to the left ventricle by  certain hidden porosities, and the air to be attracted from the  lungs through the great vessel, the pulmonary vein; and which,  consequently, will have it, that there are numerous porosities in  the septum of the heart adapted for the transmission of the  blood. But by Hercules! no such pores can be demonstrated, nor in  fact do any such exist. For the septum of the heart is of a  denser and more compact structure than any portion of the body,  except the bones and sinews. But even supposing that there were  foramina or pores in this situation, how could one of the  ventricles extract anything from the other--the left, e.g.,  obtain blood from the right, when we see that both ventricles  contract and dilate simultaneously? Why should we not rather  believe that the right took spirits from the left, than that the  left obtained blood from the right ventricle through these  foramina? But it is certainly mysterious and incongruous that  blood should be supposed to be most commodiously drawn through a  set of obscure or invisible ducts, and air through perfectly open  passages, at one and the same moment. And why, I ask, is recourse  had to secret and invisible porosities, to uncertain and obscure  channels, to explain the passage of the blood into the left  ventricle, when there is so open a way through the pulmonary  veins? I own it has always appeared extraordinary to me that they  should have chosen to make, or rather to imagine, a way through  the thick, hard, dense, and most compact septum of the heart,  rather than take that by the open pulmonary vein, or even through  the lax, soft and spongy substance of the lungs at large.  Besides, if the blood could permeate the substance of the septum,  or could be imbibed from the ventricles, what use were there for  the coronary artery and vain, branches of which proceed to the  septum itself, to supply it with nourishment? And what is  especially worthy of notice is this: if in the foetus, where  everything is more lax and soft, nature saw herself reduced to  the necessity of bringing the blood from the right to the left  side of the heart by the foramen ovale, from the vena cava  through the pulmonary vein, how should it be likely that in the  adult she should pass it so commodiously, and without an effort  through the septum of the ventricles which has now become denser  by age?    Andreas Laurentius, [Footnote: Lib. ix, cap. xi, quest. 12.]  resting on the authority of Galen [Footnote: De Locis Affectia.  lib. vi, cap. 7.] and the experience of Hollerius, asserts and  proves that the serum and pus in empyema, absorbed from the  cavities of the chest into the pulmonary vein may be expelled and  got rid of with the urine and feces through the left ventricle of  the heart and arteries. He quotes the case of a certain person  affected with melancholia, and who suffered from repeated  fainting fits, who was relieved from the paroxysms on passing a  quantity of turbid, fetid and acrid urine. But he died at last,  worn out by disease; and when the body came to be opened after  death, no fluid like that he had micturated was discovered either  in the bladder or the kidneys; but in the left ventricle of the  heart and cavity of the thorax plenty of it was met with. And  then Laurentius boasts that he had predicted the cause of the  symptoms. For my own part, however, I cannot but wonder, since he  had divined and predicted that heterogeneous matter could be  discharged by the course he indicates, why he could not or would  not perceive, and inform us that, in the natural state of things,  the blood might be commodiously transferred from the lungs to the  left ventricle of the heart by the very same route.    Since, therefore, from the foregoing considerations and many  others to the same effect, it is plain that what has heretofore  been said concerning the motion and function of the heart and  arteries must appear obscure, inconsistent, or even impossible to  him who carefully considers the entire subject, it would be  proper to look more narrowly into the matter to contemplate the  motion of the heart and arteries, not only in man, but in all  animals that have hearts; and also, by frequent appeals to  vivisection, and much ocular inspection, to investigate and  discern the truth.          ON THE MOTION OF THE HEART AND BLOOD IN ANIMALS      CHAPTER I    THE AUTHOR'S MOTIVES FOR WRITING      When I first gave my mind to vivisections, as a means of  discovering the motions and uses of the heart, and sought to  discover these from actual inspection, and not from the writings  of others, I found the task so truly arduous, so full of  difficulties, that I was almost tempted to think, with  Fracastorius, that the motion of the heart was only to be  comprehended by God. For I could neither rightly perceive at  first when the systole and when the diastole took place, nor when  and where dilatation and contraction occurred, by reason of the  rapidity of the motion, which in many animals is accomplished in  the twinkling of an eye, coming and going like a flash of  lightning; so that the systole presented itself to me now from  this point, now from that; the diastole the same; and then  everything was reversed, the motions occurring, as it seemed,  variously and confusedly together. My mind was therefore greatly  unsettled nor did I know what I should myself conclude, nor what  believe from others. I was not surprised that Andreas Laurentius  should have written that the motion of the heart was as  perplexing as the flux and reflux of Euripus had appeared to  Aristotle.    At length, by using greater and daily diligence and  investigation, making frequent inspection of many and various  animals, and collating numerous observations, I thought that I  had attained to the truth, that I should extricate myself and  escape from this labyrinth, and that I had discovered what I so  much desired, both the motion and the use of the heart and  arteries. From that time I have not hesitated to expose my views  upon these subjects, not only in private to my friends, but also  in public, in my anatomical lectures, after the manner of the  Academy of old.    These views as usual, pleased some more, others less; some chid  and calumniated me, and laid it to me as a crime that I had dared  to depart from the precepts and opinions of all anatomists;  others desired further explanations of the novelties, which they  said were both worthy of consideration, and might perchance be  found of signal use. At length, yielding to the requests of my  friends, that all might be made participators in my labors, and  partly moved by the envy of others, who, receiving my views with  uncandid minds and understanding them indifferently, have essayed  to traduce me publicly, I have moved to commit these things to  the press, in order that all may be enabled to form an opinion  both of me and my labours. This step I take all the more  willingly, seeing that Hieronymus Fabricius of Aquapendente,  although he has accurately and learnedly delineated almost every "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5697"],[0,"Tales of Chinatown (#16)"],[1,"lvanized. His face became transfigured.    \"This way, Dan!\" he cried. \"This way, boy!\"    Came a clatter of hurrying feet, and into the low, perfumed room  burst Dan Kerry, junior, tightly clasping the hand of a pale-faced,  dishevelled woman in evening dress. It was Lady Rourke; and although  she seemed to be in a nearly fainting condition, Dan dragged her, half  running, into the room.    Kerry gave one glance at the pair, then, instantly, he turned to face  Zani Chada. The latter, like a man of stone, sat in his carved chair,  eyes nearly closed. The Chief Inspector whipped out a whistle and raised  it to his lips. He blew three blasts upon it.    From one--two--three--four points around the house the signal was  answered.    Zani Chada fully opened his long, basilisk eyes.    \"You win, Chief Inspector,\" he said. \"But much may be done by clever  counsel. If all fails------\"    \"Well?\" rapped Kerry fiercely, at the same time throwing his arm around  the boy.    \"I may continue to take an interest in your affairs.\"    A tremendous uproar arose, within and without the house. The police  were raiding the place. Lady Rourke sank down, slowly, almost at the  Eurasian's feet.    But Chief Inspector Kerry experienced an unfamiliar chill as his  uncompromising stare met the cold hatred which blazed out of the black  eyes, narrowed, now, and serpentine, of Zani Chada.              THE PIGTAIL OF HI WING HO              I    HOW I OBTAINED IT        Leaving the dock gates behind me I tramped through the steady drizzle,  going parallel with the river and making for the Chinese quarter. The  hour was about half-past eleven on one of those September nights when,  in such a locality as this, a stifling quality seems to enter the  atmosphere, rendering it all but unbreathable. A mist floated over  the river, and it was difficult to say if the rain was still falling,  indeed, or if the ample moisture upon my garments was traceable only to  the fog. Sounds were muffled, lights dimmed, and the frequent hooting of  sirens from the river added another touch of weirdness to the scene.    Even when the peculiar duties of my friend, Paul Harley, called him  away from England, the lure of this miniature Orient which I had first  explored under his guidance, often called me from my chambers. In the  house with the two doors in Wade Street, Limehouse, I would discard the  armour of respectability, and, dressed in a manner unlikely to provoke  comment in dockland, would haunt those dreary ways sometimes from  midnight until close upon dawn. Yet, well as I knew the district and  the strange and often dangerous creatures lurking in its many burrows, I  experienced a chill partly physical and partly of apprehension to-night;  indeed, strange though it may sound, I hastened my footsteps in order  the sooner to reach the low den for which I was bound--Malay Jack's--a  spot marked plainly on the crimes-map and which few respectable  travellers would have regarded as a haven of refuge.    But the chill of the adjacent river, and some quality of utter  desolation which seemed to emanate from the deserted wharves and  ramshackle buildings about me, were driving me thither now; for I knew  that human companionship, of a sort, and a glass of good liquor--from  a store which the Customs would have been happy to locate--awaited me  there. I might chance, too, upon Durham or Wessex, of New Scotland Yard,  both good friends of mine, or even upon the Terror of Chinatown, Chief  Inspector Kerry, a man for whom I had an esteem which none of his  ungracious manners could diminish.    I was just about to turn to the right into a narrow and nameless alley,  lying at right angles to the Thames, when I pulled up sharply, clenching  my fists and listening.    A confused and continuous sound, not unlike that which might be  occasioned by several large and savage hounds at close grips, was  proceeding out of the darkness ahead of me; a worrying, growling, and  scuffling which presently I identified as human, although in fact it  was animal enough. A moment I hesitated, then, distinguishing among  the sounds of conflict an unmistakable, though subdued, cry for help,  I leaped forward and found myself in the midst of the melee. This was  taking place in the lee of a high, dilapidated brick wall. A lamp in a  sort of iron bracket spluttered dimly above on the right, but the  scene of the conflict lay in densest shadow, so that the figures were  indistinguishable.    \"Help! By Gawd! they're strangling me------\"    From almost at my feet the cry arose and was drowned in Chinese  chattering. But guided by it I now managed to make out that the struggle  in progress waged between a burly English sailorman and two lithe  Chinese. The yellow men seemed to have gained the advantage and my  course was clear.    A straight right on the jaw of the Chinaman who was engaged in  endeavouring to throttle the victim laid him prone in the dirty roadway.  His companion, who was holding the wrist of the recumbent man, sprang  upright as though propelled by a spring. I struck out at him savagely.  He uttered a shrill scream not unlike that of a stricken hare, and fled  so rapidly that he seemed to melt in the mist.    \"Gawd bless you, mate!\" came chokingly from the ground--and the rescued  man, extricating himself from beneath the body of his stunned assailant,  rose unsteadily to his feet and lurched toward me.    As I had surmised, he was a sailor, wearing a rough, blue-serge jacket  and having his greasy trousers thrust into heavy seaboots--by which I  judged that he was but newly come ashore. He stooped and picked up his  cap. It was covered in mud, as were the rest of his garments, but he  brushed it with his sleeve as though it had been but slightly soiled and  clapped it on his head.    He grasped my hand in a grip of iron, peering into my face, and his  breath was eloquent.    \"I'd had one or two, mate,\" he confided huskily (the confession was  unnecessary). \"It was them two in the Blue Anchor as did it; if I 'adn't  'ad them last two, I could 'ave broke up them Chinks with one 'and tied  behind me.\"    \"That's all right,\" I said hastily, \"but what are we going to do about  this Chink here?\" I added, endeavouring at the same time to extricate my  hand from the vise-like grip in which he persistently held it. \"He hit  the tiles pretty heavy when he went down.\"    As if to settle my doubts, the recumbent figure suddenly arose and  without a word fled into the darkness and was gone like a phantom. My  new friend made no attempt to follow, but:    \"You can't kill a bloody Chink,\" he confided, still clutching my hand;  \"it ain't 'umanly possible. It's easier to kill a cat. Come along o' me  and 'ave one; then I'll tell you somethink. I'll put you on somethink, I  will.\"    With surprising steadiness of gait, considering the liquid cargo he had  aboard, the man, releasing my hand and now seizing me firmly by the  arm, confidently led me by divers narrow ways, which I knew, to a little  beerhouse frequented by persons of his class.    My own attire was such as to excite no suspicion in these surroundings,  and although I considered that my acquaintance had imbibed more than  enough for one night, I let him have his own way in order that I might  learn the story which he seemed disposed to confide in me. Settled in  the corner of the beerhouse--which chanced to be nearly empty--with  portentous pewters before us, the conversation was opened by my new  friend:    \"I've been paid off from the Jupiter--Samuelson's Planet Line,\" he  explained. \"What I am is a fireman.\"    \"She was from Singapore to London?\" I asked.    \"She was,\" he replied, \"and it was at Suez it 'appened--at Suez.\"    I did not interrupt him.    \"I was ashore at Suez--we all was, owin' to a 'itch with the canal  company--a matter of money, I may say. They make yer pay before they'll  take yer through. Do you know that?\"    I nodded.    \"Suez is a place,\" he continued, \"where they don't sell whisky, only  poison. Was you ever at Suez?\"    Again I nodded, being most anxious to avoid diverting the current of my  friend's thoughts.    \"Well, then,\" he continued, \"you know Greek Jimmy's--and that's where  I'd been.\"    I did not know Greek Jimmy's, but I thought it unnecessary to mention  the fact.    \"It was just about this time on a steamin' 'ot night as I come out of  Jimmy's and started for the ship. I was walkin' along the Waghorn Quay,  same as I might be walkin' along to-night, all by myself--bit of a  list to port but nothing much--full o' joy an' happiness, 'appy an'  free--'appy an' free. Just like you might have noticed to-night, I  noticed a knot of Chinks scrappin' on the ground all amongst the dust  right in front of me. I rammed in, windmillin' all round and knocking  'em down like skittles. Seemed to me there was about ten of 'em, but  allowin' for Jimmy's whisky, maybe there wasn't more than three. Anyway,  they all shifted and left me standin' there in the empty street with  this 'ere in my 'and.\"    At that, without more ado, he thrust his hand deep into some concealed  pocket and jerked out a Chinese pigtail, which had been severed,  apparently some three inches from the scalp, by a clean cut. My  acquaintance, with somewhat bleared eyes glistening in appreciation of  his own dramatic skill--for I could not conceal my surprise--dangled it  before me triumphantly.    \"Which of 'em it belong to,\" he continued, thrusting it into another  pocket and drumming loudly on the counter for more beer, \"I can't say,  'cos I don't know. But that ain't all.\"    The tankards being refilled and my friend having sampled the contents of  his own:    \"That ain't all,\" he continued. \"I thought I'd keep it as a sort of  relic, like. What 'appened? I'll tell you. Amongst the crew there's  three Chinks--see? We ain't through the canal before one of 'em, a new  one to me--Li Ping is his name--offers me five bob for the"]]]
