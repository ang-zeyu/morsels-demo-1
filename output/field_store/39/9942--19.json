Rapidly he glanced through them. \"I have them,  Ffoulkes,\" he reiterated more emphatically as he put the bundle into his  pocket; \"now everything back in its place and--\"    Suddenly he paused, his slender hand up to his lips, his head turned  toward the door, an expression of tense expectancy in every line of his  face.    \"Quick, Ffoulkes,\" he whispered, \"everything back into the chest, and  the lid down.\"    \"What ears you have,\" murmured Ffoulkes as he obeyed rapidly and without  question. \"I heard nothing.\"    Blakeney went to the door and bent his head to listen.    \"Three men coming up the stairs,\" he said; \"they are on the landing  now.\"    \"Have we time to rush them?\"    \"No chance! They are at the door. Two more men have joined them, and I  can distinguish Rondeau's voice, too.\"    \"The quintette,\" murmured Sir Andrew. \"We are caught like two rats in a  trap.\"    Even as he spoke the opening of the outside door could be distinctly  heard, then the confused murmur of many voices. Already Blakeney and  Ffoulkes had with perfect presence of mind put the finishing touches to  the tidying of the room--put the chairs straight, shut down the lid of  the oak chest, closed all the drawers of the desk.    \"Nothing but good luck can save us now,\" whispered Blakeney as he  lowered the wick of the lamp. \"Quick now,\" he added, \"behind that  tapestry in the alcove and trust to our stars.\"    Securely hidden for the moment behind the curtains in the dark recess of  the alcove the two men waited. The door leading into the sitting-room  was ajar, and they could hear Heriot and his friends making merry  irruption into the place. From out the confusion of general conversation  they soon gathered that the debates in the Chamber had been so dull and  uninteresting that, at a given signal, the little party had decided to  adjourn to Heriot's rooms for their habitual game of cards. They could  also hear Heriot calling to Rondeau to bring bottles and glasses, and  vaguely they marvelled what Rondeau's attitude might be like at this  moment. Was he brazening out the situation, or was he sick with terror?    Suddenly Heriot's voice came out more distinctly.    \"Make yourselves at home, friends,\" he was saying; \"here are cards,  dominoes, and wine. I must leave you to yourselves for ten minutes  whilst I write an important letter.\"    \"All right, but don't be long,\" came in merry response.    \"Not longer than I can help,\" rejoined Heriot. \"I want my revenge  against Bompard, remember. He did fleece me last night.\"    \"Hurry on, then,\" said one of the men. \"I'll play Desgas that return  game of dominoes until then.\"    \"Ten minutes and I'll be back,\" concluded Heriot.    He pushed open the bedroom door. The light within was very dim. The two  men hidden behind the tapestry could hear him moving about the room  muttering curses to himself. Presently the light of the lamp was shifted  from one end of the room to the other. Through the opening between the  two curtains Blakeney could just see Heriot's back as he placed the lamp  at a convenient angle upon his desk, divested himself of his overcoat  and muffler, then sat down and drew pen and paper closer to him. He was  leaning forward, his elbow resting upon the table, his fingers fidgeting  with his long, lank hair. He had closed the door when he entered, and  from the other room now the voices of his friends sounded confused and  muffled. Now and then an exclamation: \"Double!\" \"Je ... tiens!\"  \"Cinq-deux!\" an oath, a laugh, the click of glasses and bottles came out  more clearly; but the rest of the time these sounds were more like a  droning accompaniment to the scraping of Heriot's pen upon the paper  when he finally began to write his letter.    Two minutes went by and then two more. The scratching of Heriot's pen  became more rapid as he appeared to be more completely immersed in his  work. Behind the curtain the two men had been waiting: Blakeney ready to  act, Ffoulkes equally ready to interpret the slightest signal from his  chief.    The next minute Blakeney had stolen out of the alcove, and his two  hands--so slender and elegant looking, and yet with a grip of steel--had  fastened themselves upon Heriot's mouth, smothering within the space of  a second the cry that had been half-uttered. Ffoulkes was ready to  complete the work of rendering the man helpless: one handkerchief made  an efficient gag, another tied the ankles securely. Heriot's own  coat-sleeves supplied the handcuffs, and the blankets off the bed tied  around his legs rendered him powerless to move. Then the two men lifted  this inert mass on to the bed and Ffoulkes whispered anxiously: \"Now,  what next?\"    Heriot's overcoat, hat, and muffler lay upon a chair. Sir Percy, placing  a warning finger upon his lips, quickly divested himself of his own  coat, slipped that of Heriot on, twisted the muffler round his neck,  hunched up his shoulders, and murmuring: \"Now for a bit of luck!\" once  more lowered the light of the lamp and then went to the door.    \"Rondeau!\" he called. \"Hey, Rondeau!\" And Sir Percy himself was  surprised at the marvellous way in which he had caught the very  inflection of Heriot's voice.    \"Hey, Rondeau!\" came from one of the players at the table, \"the  citizen-deputy is calling you!\"    They were all sitting round the table: two men intent upon their game of  dominoes, the other two watching with equal intentness. Rondeau came  shuffling out of the antichambre. His face, by the dim light of the oil  lamp, looked jaundiced with fear.    \"Rondeau, you fool, where are you?\" called Blakeney once again.    The next moment Rondeau had entered the room. No need for a signal or an  order this time. Ffoulkes knew by instinct what his chief's bold scheme  would mean to them both if it succeeded. He retired into the darkest  corner of the room as Rondeau shuffled across to the writing-desk. It  was all done in a moment. In less time than it had taken to bind and gag  Heriot, his henchman was laid out on the floor, his coat had been taken  off him, and he was tied into a mummy-like bundle with Sir Andrew  Ffoulkes' elegant coat fastened securely round his arms and chest. It  had all been done in silence. The men in the next room were noisy and  intent on their game; the slight scuffle, the quickly smothered cries  had remained unheeded.    \"Now, what next?\" queried Sir Andrew Ffoulkes once more.    \"The impudence of the d--- l, my good Ffoulkes,\" replied Blakeney in a  whisper, \"and may our stars not play us false. Now let me make you look  as like Rondeau as possible--there! Slip on his coat--now your hair over  your forehead--your coat-collar up--your knees bent--that's better!\" he  added as he surveyed the transformation which a few deft strokes had  made in Sir Andrew Ffoulkes' appearance. \"Now all you have to do is to  shuffle across the room--here's your prototype's handkerchief--of  dubious cleanliness, it is true, but it will serve--blow your nose as  you cross the room, it will hide your face. They'll not heed you--keep  in the shadows and God guard you--I'll follow in a moment or two ... but  don't wait for me.\"    He opened the door, and before Sir Andrew could protest his chief had  pushed him out into the room where the four men were still intent on  their game. Through the open door Sir Percy now watched his friend who,  keeping well within the shadows, shuffled quietly across the room. The  next moment Sir Andrew was through and in the antichambre. Blakeney's  acutely sensitive ears caught the sound of the opening of the outer  door. He waited for a while, then he drew out of his pocket the bundle  of letters which he had risked so much to obtain. There they were neatly  docketed and marked: \"The affairs of Arnould Fabrice.\"    Well! if he got away to-night Agnes de Lucines would be happy and free  from the importunities of that brute Heriot; after that he must persuade  her and Fabrice to go to England and to freedom.    For the moment his own safety was terribly in jeopardy; one false  move--one look from those players round the table.... Bah! even then--!    With an inward laugh he pushed open the door once more and stepped into  the room. For the moment no one noticed him; the game was at its most  palpitating stage; four shaggy heads met beneath the lamp and four pairs  of eyes were gazing with rapt attention upon the intricate maze of the  dominoes.    Blakeney walked quietly across the room; he was just midway and on a  level with the centre table when a voice was suddenly raised from that  tense group beneath the lamp: \"Is it thou, friend Heriot?\"    Then one of the men looked up and stared, and another did likewise and  exclaimed: \"It is not Heriot!\"    In a moment all was confusion, but confusion was the very essence of  those hair-breadth escapes and desperate adventures which were as the  breath of his nostrils to the Scarlet Pimpernel. Before those four men  had had time to jump to their feet, or to realise that something was  wrong with their friend Heriot, he had run across the room, his hand was  on the knob of the door--the door that led to the antichambre and to  freedom.    Bompard, Desgas, Jeanniot, Legros were at his heels, but he tore open  the door, bounded across the threshold, and slammed it to with such a  vigorous bang that those on the other side were brought to a momentary  halt. That moment meant life and liberty to Blakeney; already he had  crossed the antichambre. Quite coolly and quietly now he took out the  key from the inner side of the main door and slipped it to the outside.  The next second--even as the four men rushed helter-skelter into the  antichambre he was out on the landing and had turned the key in the  door.    His prisoners were safely locked in--in Heriot's apartments--and Sir  Percy Blakeney, calmly and without haste, was descending the stairs of  the house in the Rue Cocatrice."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5817"],[0,"The Clockmaker — or, the Sayings and Doings of Samuel Slick, of Slickville (#16)"],[1,"down; colt will share the same fate.  He'll get beat afore long, and then he's done for. The  multitude are always fickle minded. Our great Washington  found that out, and the British officer that beat  Bounaparte, the bread they gave him turned sour afore he  got half through the loaf. His soap had hardly stiffened  afore it ran right back to lye and grease agin. I was  sarved the same way, I liked to have missed my pension,  the Committee said I warn't at Bunker's hill at all, the  villans. That was a Glo---, (thinks I, old boy, if you  once get into that are field, you'll race longer than  colt, a plaguy sight; you'll run clear away to the fence  to the far eend afore you stop, so I jist cut in and took  a hand myself,) yes, says I, you did 'em father, properly,  that old waggon was a bright scheme, it led 'em on till  you got 'em on the right spot, did'nt it? Says father,  THERE'S A MORAL SAM, IN EVERY THING IN NATUR. Never have  nothin to do with elections, you see the valy of popularity  in the case of that are horse--sarve the public 999 times,  and the 1,000th, if they don't agree with you, they desart  and abuse you--see how they sarved old John Adams, see  how they let Jefferson starve in his old age, see how  good old Munroe like to have got right into Jail, after  his term of President was up. They may talk of independence,  says father, but Sam, I'll tell you what independence  is, and he gave his hands a slap agin his trowses pocket,  and made the gold eagles he won at the race all jingle  agin; THAT, says he, giving them another wipe with his  fist, (and winkin as much as to say do you hear that my  boy) THAT I CALL INDEPENDENCE. He was in great spirits,  the old man, he was so proud of winnin the race, and  puttin the leake into the New Yorkers--he looked all  dander. Let them great hungry, ill favored, long legged  bitterns, says he, (only he called them by another name  that don't sound quite pretty) from the outlandish states  to Congress, TALK ABOUT independence; but Sam, said he,  (hitting the Shiners agin till be made them dance right  up an eend in his pocket) I LIKE TO FEEL IT.    No Sam, said be, line the pocket well first, make that  independent, and then the spirit will be like a horse  turned out to grass in the spring, for the first time,  he's all head and tail, a snortin and kickin and racin  and carryin on like mad--it soon gets independent too.  While it's in the stall it may hold up, and paw, and  whiner, and feel as spry as any thing, but the leather  strap keeps it to the manger, and the lead weight to the  eend of it makes it hold down its head at last. No, says  he, here's independence, and he gave the Eagles such a  drive with his fist, he bust his pocket and sent a whole  raft of them a spinnin down his leg to the ground--says  I, father, (and I swear I could hardly keep from larfin,  he looked so peskily vexed) Father, says I, I guess  there's a moral in that are too--EXTREMES NARY WAY ARE  NONE O' THE BEST. Well, well, says he, (kinder snappishly)  I suppose you're half right, Sam, but weve said enough  about it, let's drop the subject, and see if I have picked  em all up, for my eyes are none of the best now, I'm near  hand to seventy.          No. XVI    Mr. Slick's Opinion of the British.    What success had you, said I, in the sale of your Clocks  among the Scotch in the eastern part of the Province? do  you find them as gullible as the Blue Noses? Well, said  he, you have heerd tell that a Yankee never answers one  question, without axing another, havent you? Did you ever  see an English Stage Driver make a bow? because if you  hante observed it, I have, and a queer one it is, I swan.  He brings his right arm up, jist across his face, and  passes on, with a knowin nod of his head, as much as to  say, how do you do? but keep clear o' my wheels, or I'll  fetch your horses a lick in the mouth as sure as youre  born; jist as a bear puts up his paw to fend off the blow  of a stick from his nose. Well, that's the way I pass  them are bare breeched Scotchmen. Lord, if they were  located down in these here Cumberland mashes, how the  musquitoes would tickle them up, would'nt they? They'd  set 'em scratching thereabouts, as an Irishman does his  head, when he's in sarch of a lie. Them are fellers cut  their eye teeth afore they ever sot foot in this country,  I expect. When they get a bawbee, they know what to do  with it, that's a fact; they open their pouch and drop  it in, and its got a spring like a fox trap--it holds  fast to all it gets, like grim death to a dead nigger.  They are proper skin flints, you may depend. Oatmeal is  no great shakes at best; it tante even as good for a  horse as real yeller Varginey corn, but I guess I warnt  long in finding out that the grits hardly pay for the  riddlin. No, a Yankee has as little chance among them as  a Jew has in New England; the sooner he clears out, the  better. You can no more put a leake into them, than you  can send a chisel into Teake wood--it turns the edge of  the tool the first drive. If the Blue Noses knew the  value of money as well as they do, they'd have more cash,  and fewer Clocks and tin reflectors, I reckon. Now, its  different with the Irish; they never carry a puss, for  they never have a cent to put in it. They are always in  love or in liquor, or else in a row; they are the merriest  shavers I ever seed. Judge Beeler, I dare say you have  heerd tell of him--he's a funny feller--he put a notice  over his factory gate at Lowell, 'no cigars or Irishmen  admitted within these walls;' for, said he, the one will  set a flame agoin among my cottons, and t'other among my  galls. I wont have no such inflammable and dangerous  things about me on no account. When the British wanted  our folks to join in the treaty to chock the wheels of  the slave trade, I recollect hearin old John Adams say,  we had ought to humor them; for, says he, they supply us  with labor on easier terms, by shippin out the Irish.  Says he, they work better, and they work cheaper, and  they don't live so long. The blacks, when they are past  work hang on for ever, and a proper bill of expence they  be; but hot weather and new rum rub out the poor rates  for tother ones. The English are the boys for tradin  with; they shell out their cash like a sheef of wheat in  frosty weather--it flies all over the thrashin floor;  but then they are a cross grained, ungainly, kicken breed  of cattle, as I een a most ever see'd. Whoever gave them  the name of John Bull, knew what he was about, I tell  you; for they are bull-necked, bull-headed folks, I vow;  sulky, ugly tempered, vicious critters, a pawin and a  roarin the whole time, and plaguy onsafe unless well  watched. They are as headstrong as mules, and as conceited  as peacocks.    The astonishment with which I heard this tirade against  my countrymen, absorbed every feeling of resentment. I  listened with amazement at the perfect composure with  which he uttered it. He treated it as one of those self  evident truths, that need neither proof nor apology, but  as a thing well known and admitted by all mankind. There's  no richer sight that I know of, said he, than to see one  on 'em when he first lands in one of our great cities.  He swells out as big as a balloon, his skin is ready to  bust with wind--a regular walking bag of gas; and he  prances over the pavement like a bear over hot iron--a  great awkward hulk of a feller, (for they aint to be  compared to the French in manners) a smirkin at you, as  much as to say, 'look here, Jonathan, here's an Englishman;  here's a boy that's got blood as pure as a Norman pirate,  and lots of the blunt of both kinds, a pocket full of  one, and a mouthfull of tother; beant he lovely?' and  then he looks as fierce as a tiger, as much as to say,  'say boo TO A GOOSE, if you dare.' No, I believe we may  stump the Univarse; we improve on every thing, and we  have improved on our own species. You'll sarch one while,  I tell you, afore you'll find a man that, take him by  and large, is equal to one of our free and enlightened  citizens. He's the chap that has both speed, wind and  bottom; he's clear grit--ginger to the back bone, you  may depend. Its generally allowed there aint the beat  of them to be found any where. Spry as a fox, supple as  an eel, and cute as a weasel. Though I say it that  should'nt say it, they fairly take the shine off  creation--they are actilly equal to cash.    He looked like a man who felt that he had expressed  himself so aptly and so well, that any thing additional  would only weaken its effect; he therefore changed the  conversation immediately, by pointing to a tree at some  little distance from the house, and remarking that it  was the rock maple or sugar tree. Its a pretty tree, said  he, and a profitable one too to raise. It will bear  tapping for many years, tho' it gets exhausted at last.  This Province is like that are tree, it is tapped till  it begins to die at the top, and if they dont drive in  a spile and stop the everlastin flow of the sap, it will  perish altogether. All the money that's made here, all  the interest that's paid in it, and a pretty considerable  portion of rent too, all goes abroad for investment, and  the rest is sent to us to buy bread. Its drained like  a bog, it has opened and covered trenches all through  it, and then there's others to the foot of the upland to  cut off the springs. Now you may make even a bog too dry;  you may take the moisture out to that degree, that the  very sile becomes dust and blows away. The English funds,  and our banks, rail roads, and canals, are all absorbing  your capital like a spunge, and will lick it up as fast  as you can make it. That very Bridge we heerd of at  Windsor, is owned in New Brunswick, and will pay tole to  that province. The capitalists of Nova Scotia treat it  like a hired house, they wont keep it in repair; they  neither paint it to preserve"]]]
