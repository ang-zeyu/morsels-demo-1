The body  politic requires a physician. No one better understands the subject or  is more competent to prescribe than Lord Milner. Why do we not take his  advice? Nothing is more significant than the fact that in the Cape  Colony two years ago heated parliamentary debates and a violent  political agitation, following immediately upon the suppression of the  first rebellion, were in their turn succeeded by a second rebellion more  ruinous than the former one.    In asking for suspension there is no idea of defection from the  principle of responsible government. The Imperial system requires local  independence, and in due course this will be extended to all parts of  South Africa. A necessary interregnum is required for purposes of true  liberty and sound rule, in order that breakdown may be prevented and  true constitutionalism take the place of the tyranny of any section of  the population. The Imperial Government is no step-mother, and the  federation of Southern Africa will doubtless be on similar lines to  those of the Canadian Dominion. Certainly no system will be forced upon  the people contrary to their wishes, but the resurrection of Bond power  in the Cape Colony would absolutely prevent any well-considered and  statesmanlike plan, in which all men would receive fair play utterly  regardless of race extraction. In fact the British and the Africander  Bond theories are diametrically opposed. The first makes every civilised  man equal from the Zambesi to Cape Town, the other specially and always  means \"Africa for the Africanders.\"    Heated discussions in Parliament, and the intense excitement connected  with contested elections, cannot but accentuate race hatred in the Cape  Colony. Surely South Africa should have a rest. As in the Transvaal and  in the Orange Colony, so at the Cape, the great healer, time, ought to  be allowed to do its work.    But perhaps the strongest, because the most practical, argument in  favour of \"suspension\" is based upon the fact that a re-distribution Act  is absolutely necessary if fair play is to be bestowed on all  nationalities, and the reign of the Bond be not allowed to again become  supreme. The suspensionists are really fighting for liberty against the  rule of a section. Their motto is that of the Union Jack--\"Equal rights  for all\"--whereas, as we know, the Africanders will in the future, as in  the past, demand \"Africa for the Africanders.\" No delusion is greater  than to imagine that they will change their purpose. Their plan is to  adhere to their principles, consolidate their party, and wait for an  opportunity. After spending more than two hundred millions of money, and  much more than this--40,000 noble lives--for the sake of upholding  British supremacy in Southern Africa, nothing should be done even to  risk a recurrence of the trouble. This certainly was the opinion of Lord  Milner, and of the great majority of the British people in the Cape  Colony. The advice now referred to was not taken, and history must  record the result.    The real aims and objects of the Bond are as decipherable to-day as they  were three years or ten years ago. The people who belong to it are  thoroughly tenacious of these opinions, and to do them justice, make no  pretence of having changed them. At the Paarl the popular General Botha  has just declared that they are not vanquished, retain their traditions,  and will yet conquer. They look with unutterable scorn on the men who  joined the National Scouts, and entertain feelings of coldness and  dislike for those who did not join the enemy either actively or  passively. In the great Dutch Church of Cape Town, the Republican  Generals received an unanimous ovation, and were carried shoulder high,  in triumph, from the edifice. The truth is that the Bond exists, remains  extremely powerful, and is only waiting and watching for an opportunity.    British rule is now comparatively easy both in the Transvaal and Orange  Colonies. Effective progress is being made under the rule of wise and  firm Governments; but it is in the Cape Colony, where a treacherous and  powerful enemy is allowed to plot with impunity, that the real danger to  British Imperial interests lies.    How history repeats itself! When the fatuous policy of abandoning 35,000  square miles of excellent territory styled the Orange River Sovereignty  was pursued in 1853, there was only one man in the House of Commons who  opposed it,[9] and subsequent circumstances amply justified his  judgment. In 1902, Mr. Chamberlain would have found it absolutely  impossible to obtain a majority in the House of Commons favourable to  suspension of the Cape Colony Constitution. What is now to be done? Our  answer is, \"Accept with loyalty the decision of the Government, and show  by wise moderation that we are most desirous to be friends with our  fellow-subjects of Dutch extraction. No recriminations nor abuse should  proceed from our side. Nothing will please us better than to find the  Bond abandoned and all men cordially uniting as one free people under  the British flag. If this be not done--and masses of the people have  already declared that it will not--we will have to fight the Bond again  at elections, on public platforms, and in the press, as well as in  Parliament. It would have been well for both nationalities if this could  have been avoided, but this is now impossible.\"        LET GOD DEFEND THE RIGHT.

KNIGHT    _Author of \"Where Three Empires Meet\"; \"The Cruise of the 'Falcon,'\"  &c._      In all the long romantic story of the making of the British Empire, no  episode more strongly appeals to the imagination than the foundation of  Rhodesia. Well is it named Rhodesia; for the history of Great Britain's  acquisitions on either side of the Zambesi, the 750,000 square miles of  magnificent territories which lie under the sway of the British South  Africa Company, is the history of the Englishman, Cecil John Rhodes: had  it not been for whose foresight, statesmanship, untiring vigilance,  determined but patient endeavour for years towards the accomplishment of  his mighty schemes, the South African Plateau, with its gold-bearing  reefs, its vast tracts of rich arable and pastoral lands, would have  fallen into the hands of one or other of the foreign Powers which keenly  contested with him its possession.    It is a trite saying that when the time is ripe for great doings on the  part of a nation the necessary man invariably appears. It is a saying  hardly warranted by fact, for many a golden opportunity have nations,  Great Britain as often as others, lost because the right man was not  forthcoming. Happily it has not been so in South Africa. It is almost  certain that, had it not been for the accident of Mr. Rhodes seeking the  South African shores for his health when a lad, the Germans and the  Boers would have cut off the Cape Colony from all possibility of  expansion to the north. Those Powers had even found their right men. The  Transvaal had her stubborn Kruger; Germany had her shrewd and energetic  agents and explorers preparing the way to annexation in different  portions of the Dark Continent; while even Portugal had her D'Andrade, a  man who displayed much of the spirit and enterprise of the Portuguese  discoverers and conquerors of olden days. Cecil Rhodes took his place in  South African affairs but just in time. The Transvaal War had been  followed by a period of extraordinary apathy both in England and in the  Cape Colony. No one seemed to care in the least what became of the  territory lying beyond our then limits. At home men were sick of the  very name of South Africa. Many would have gladly abandoned all our  possessions about the Cape of Storms, and abdicated an Empire which  seemed to bring us nothing but futile wars, disaster, and disgrace. It  was at this critical period that Mr. Rhodes came to the front to save  our supremacy in South Africa--too late, indeed, to save for us much  that should have been ours; too late, for example, to secure our  sovereignty over Namaqualand and Damaraland, territories which had been  long recognised as being within Britain's sphere of influence, which  formerly had been annexed to the Cape, but which latterly had been  totally neglected both by the Imperial and Cape Governments, so that the  watchful Germans were left at liberty, first to establish their trading  missions, and finally to assert their sovereignty over those extensive  regions.    [Illustration: FIVE-MILE SPRUIT ON MELSETTER ROAD, RHODESIA]    The richness and beauty of the highlands, extending over an immense area  both north and south of the Zambesi, had for many years been known to  both English and Boer travellers. Mr. Rhodes, in his early days at  Kimberley, met many an adventurous wanderer who had come from that  wonderful region, and their glowing tales perhaps first inspired in him  that ambitious dream of the creation of a great new British colony that  should include all the finest country in South and Central Africa. As  far back as 1882, having commenced to take an active part in Cape  politics, Mr. "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4747"],[0,"The River's End (#16)"],[1,"of being intended as a strong box rather  than a traveling receptacle. It was ribbed by four heavy bands of  copper, and the corners and edges were reinforced with the same metal.  The lock itself seemed to be impregnable to one without a key.  Conniston's name was heavily engraved on a copper tablet just above the  lock.    Keith regarded the chest with swiftly growing speculation. It was not a  thing one would ordinarily possess. It was an object which, on the face  of it, was intended to be inviolate except to its master key, a holder  of treasure, a guardian of mystery and of precious secrets. In the  little cabin up on the Barren Conniston had said rather indifferently,  \"You may find something among my things down there that will help you  out.\" The words flashed back to Keith. Had the Englishman, in that  casual and uncommunicative way of his, referred to the contents of this  chest? Was it not possible that it held for him a solution to the  mystery that was facing him in the presence of Mary Josephine? A sense  of conviction began to possess him. He examined the lock more closely  and found that with proper tools it could be broken.    He finished dressing and completed his toilet by brushing his beard. On  account of Mary Josephine he found himself regarding this hirsute  tragedy with a growing feeling of disgust, in spite of the fact that it  gave him an appearance rather distinguished and military. He wanted it  off. Its chief crime was that it made him look older. Besides, it was  inclined to be reddish. And it must tickle and prick like the deuce  when--    He brought himself suddenly to salute with an appreciative grin.  \"You're there, and you've got to stick,\" he chuckled. After all, he was  a likable-looking chap, even with that handicap. He was glad.    He opened his door so quietly that Mary Josephine did not see him at  first. Her back was toward him as she bent over the dining-table. Her  slim little figure was dressed in some soft stuff all crinkly from  packing. Her hair, brown and soft, was piled up in shining coils on the  top of her head. For the life of him Keith couldn't keep his eyes from  traveling from the top of that glowing head to the little high-heeled  feet on the floor. They were adorable, slim little, aristocratic feet  with dainty ankles! He stood looking at her until she turned and caught  him.    There was a change since last night. She was older. He could see it  now, the utter impropriety of his cuddling her up like a baby in the  big chair--the impossibility, almost.    Mary Josephine settled his doubt. With a happy little cry she ran to  him, and Keith found her arms about him again and her lovely mouth held  up to be kissed. He hesitated for perhaps the tenth part of a second,  if hesitation could be counted in that space. Then his arms closed  about her, and he kissed her. He felt the snuggle of her face against  his breast again, the crush and sweetness of her hair against his lips  and cheek. He kissed her again uninvited. Before he could stop the  habit, he had kissed her a third time.    Then her hands were at his face, and he saw again that look in her  eyes, a deep and anxious questioning behind the shimmer of love in  them, something mute and understanding and wonderfully sympathetic, a  mothering soul looking at him and praying as it looked. If his life had  paid the forfeit the next instant, he could not have helped kissing her  a fourth time.    If Mary Josephine had gone to bed with a doubt of his brotherly  interest last night, the doubt was removed now. Her cheeks flushed. Her  eyes shone. She was palpitantly, excitedly happy. \"It's YOU, Derry,\"  she cried. \"Oh, it's you as you used to be!\"    She seized his hand and drew him toward the table. Wallie thrust in his  head from the kitchenette, grinning, and Mary Josephine flashed him  back a meaning smile. Keith saw in an instant that Wallie had turned  from his heathen gods to the worship of something infinitely more  beautiful. He no longer looked to Keith for instructions.    Mary Josephine sat down opposite Keith at the table. She was telling  him, with that warm laughter and happiness in her eyes, how the sun had  wakened her, and how she had helped Wallie get breakfast. For the first  time Keith was looking at her from a point of vantage; there was just  so much distance between them, no more and no less, and the light was  right. She was, to him, exquisite. The little puckery lines came into  her smooth forehead when he apologized for his tardiness by explaining  that he had not gone to bed until one o'clock. Her concern was  delightful. She scolded him while Wallie brought in the breakfast, and  inwardly he swelled with the irrepressible exultation of a great  possessor. He had never had anyone to scold him like that before. It  was a scolding which expressed Mary Josephine's immediate  proprietorship of him, and he wondered if the pleasure of it made him  look as silly as Wallie. His plans were all gone. He had intended to  play the idiotic part of one who had partly lost his memory, but  throughout the breakfast he exhibited no sign that he was anything but  healthfully normal. Mary Josephine's delight at the improvement of his  condition since last night shone in her face and eyes, and he could see  that she was strictly, but with apparent unconsciousness, guarding  herself against saying anything that might bring up the dread shadow  between them. She had already begun to fight her own fight for him, and  the thing was so beautiful that he wanted to go round to her, and get  down on his knees, and put his head in her lap, and tell her the truth.    It was in the moment of that thought that the look came into his face  which brought the questioning little lines into her forehead again. In  that instant she caught a glimpse of the hunted man, of the soul that  had traded itself, of desire beaten into helplessness by a thing she  would never understand. It was gone swiftly, but she had caught it. And  for her the scar just under his hair stood for its meaning. The  responsive throb in her breast was electric. He felt it, saw it, sensed  it to the depth of his soul, and his faith in himself stood challenged.  She believed. And he--was a liar. Yet what a wonderful thing to lie for!    \"--He called me up over the telephone, and when I told him to be quiet,  that you were still asleep, I think he must have sworn--it sounded like  it, but I couldn't hear distinctly--and then he fairly roared at me to  wake you up and tell you that you didn't half deserve such a lovely  little sister as I am. Wasn't that nice, Derry?\"    \"You--you're talking about McDowell?\"    \"To be sure I am talking about Mr. McDowell! And when I told him your  injury troubled you more than usual, and that I was glad you were  resting, I think I heard him swallow hard. He thinks a lot of you,  Derry. And then he asked me WHICH injury it was that hurt you, and I  told him the one in the head. What did he mean? Were you hurt somewhere  else, Derry?\"    Keith swallowed hard, too. \"Not to speak of,\" he said. \"You see, Mary  Josephine, I've got a tremendous surprise for you, if you'll promise it  won't spoil your appetite. Last night was the first night I've spent in  a real bed for three years.\"    And then, without waiting for her questions, he began to tell her the  epic story of John Keith. With her sitting opposite him, her beautiful,  wide-open, gray eyes looking at him with amazement as she sensed the  marvelous coincidence of their meeting, he told it as he had not told  it to McDowell or even to Miriam Kirkstone. A third time the facts were  the same. But it was John Keith now who was telling John Keith's story  through the lips of an unreal and negative Conniston. He forgot his own  breakfast, and a look of gloom settled on Wallie's face when he peered  in through the door and saw that their coffee and toast were growing  cold. Mary Josephine leaned a little over the table. Not once did she  interrupt Keith. Never had he dreamed of a glory that might reflect his  emotions as did her eyes. As he swept from pathos to storm, from the  madness of long, black nights to starvation and cold, as he told of  flight, of pursuit, of the merciless struggle that ended at last in the  capture of John Keith, as he gave to these things words and life  pulsing with the beat of his own heart, he saw them revisioned in those  wonderful gray eyes, cold at times with fear, warm and glowing at other  times with sympathy, and again shining softly with a glory of pride and  love that was meant for him alone. With him she was present in the  little cabin up in the big Barren. Until he told of those days and  nights of hopeless desolation, of racking cough and the nearness of  death, and of the comradeship of brothers that had come as a final  benediction to the hunter and the hunted, until in her soul she was  understanding and living those terrible hours as they two had lived  them, he did not know how deep and dark and immeasurably tender that  gray mystery of beauty in her eyes could be. From that hour he  worshiped them as he worshiped no other part of her.    \"And from all that you came back the same day I came,\" she said in a  low, awed voice. \"You came back from THAT!\"    He remembered the part he must play.    \"Yes, three years of it. If I could only remember as well, only half as  well, things that happened before this--\" He raised a hand to his  forehead, to the scar.    \"You will,\" she whispered swiftly. \"Derry, darling, you will!\"    Wallie sidled in and, with an adoring grin at Mary Josephine, suggested  that he had more coffee and toast ready to serve, piping hot. Keith was  relieved. The day had begun auspiciously, and over the bacon and eggs,  done to a ravishing brown by the little Jap, he told Mary Josephine of  some of his bills of fare in the north and how yesterday he had filled  up on bacon smell at Andy Duggan's."]]]
