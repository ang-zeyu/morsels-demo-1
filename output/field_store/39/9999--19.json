The workingmen in the cities are hard workers and probably work  longer and get less out of life than any workingmen in the world.  The laws so much admired and made ostensibly for their protection,  such as insurance against unemployment, sickness, injury, old  age, etc., are in reality skilful measures which bind them to  the soil as effectively as the serfs of the Middle Ages were  bound to their masters' estates.    I have had letters from workingmen who have worked in America  begging me for a steerage fare to America, saying that their  insurance payments were so large that they could not save money  out of their wages. Of course, after having made these payments  for some years, the workingman naturally hesitates to emigrate  and so lose all the premiums he has paid to the State. In peace  times a skilled mechanic in Germany received less than two dollars  a day, for which he was compelled to work at least ten hours.  Agricultural labourers in the Central Empires are poorly paid.  The women do much of the work done here by men. For instance,  once when staying at a nobleman's estate in Hungary, I noticed  that the gardeners were all women, and, on inquiring how much they  received, I was told they were paid about twenty cents a day. The  women in the farming districts of Germany are worked harder than  the cattle. In summer time they are out in the fields at five or  six in the morning and do not return until eight or later at night.  For this work they are sometimes paid as high as forty-eight  cents a day in harvest time. Nevertheless, these small wages  tempt many Russians to Germany during the harvest season. At the  outbreak of the war there were perhaps fifty thousand Russians  employed in Germany; men, women and girls. These the Germans  retained in a sort of slavery to work the fields. I spoke to  one Polish girl who was working on an estate over which I had  shooting rights, near Berlin. She told me that at the commencement  of the war she and her family were working in Germany and that  since the war they all desired to return to Poland but that the  Germans would not permit it.    This hard working of women in agricultural pursuits tends to  stupefy and brutalise the rural population and keeps them in a  condition of subjection to the Prussian Church and the Prussian  system, and in readiness for war. Both Prussian Junkers and the  German manufacturers look with favour upon the employment of  so many women in farm work because the greater the number of  the labourers, the smaller their wages throughout the country.    When I first came to Germany I, of course, was filled with the  ideas that prevailed in America that the German workingman had  an easy time. My mind was filled with pictures of the German  workingmen sitting with their families at tables, drinking beer  and listening to classical music. After I had spent some time in  Germany, I found that the reason that the German workingmen sat  about the tables was because they were too tired to do anything  else.    I sincerely hope that after the war the workingmen of this country  will induce delegates of their German brothers to make a tour  of America. For when the German workingmen see how much better  off the Americans are, they will return to Germany and demand  shorter hours and higher wages; and the American will not be  brought into competition with labour slaves such as the German  workingmen of the period before the war.    As one goes through the streets of Berlin there are no evidences  of poverty to be seen; but over fifty-five per cent of the families  in Berlin are families living in one room.    The Germans are taken care of and educated very much in the same  way that the authorities here look after the inmates of a poor-house  or penitentiary. Such a thing as a German railway conductor rising  to be president of the road is an impossibility in Germany; and  the list of self-made men is small indeed,--by that I mean men  who have risen from the ranks of the working-men.    The Socialists, representing the element opposed to the  Conservatives, elect a few members to the Prussian Lower House  and about one-third of the members to the Reichstag, but otherwise  have no part whatever in the government. No Socialist would have  any chance whatever if he set out to enter the government service  with the ambition of becoming a district attorney or judge. Jews  have not much chance in the government service. A few exceptions  have been made. At one time Dernburg, who carried on the propaganda  in America during the first year of the war, and who is a Jew, was  appointed Colonial Minister of the Empire.    In my opinion, the liberalisation of Prussia has been halted  by the fact that there has been no party of protest except that  of the Socialists, and the Socialists, because they have, in  effect, demanded abolition of the monarchy and the establishment  of a republic as part of their programme, have been unable to  do anything in the obtaining of the reforms.    Up to the beginning of the war there was great dissatisfaction.  The people were irritated by certain direct taxes such as the  tax upon matches, and because every Protestant in Prussia was  compelled to pay a tax for the support of the church, unless  he made a declaration that he was an atheist.    The only class in Germany which knows something of the outside  world is the _Kaufmann_ class. Prussian nobles of the ruling  class are not travellers. They are always busy with the army and  navy, government employments or their estates; and, as a rule,  too poor to travel. The poor, of course, do not travel, and the  _Kaufmann_, although he learns much in his travels in other  countries to make him dissatisfied with the small opportunity  which he has in a political way in Germany, is satisfied to let  things stand because of the enormous profits which he makes  through the low wages and long hours of the German workingman.    Lawyers and judges amount to little in Germany and we do not  find there a class of political lawyers who, in republics, always  seem to get the management of affairs in their own hands.          CHAPTER VIII    THE DAYS BEFORE THE WAR    After my return from Kiel to Berlin a period of calm ensued.  No one seemed to think that the murders at Sarajevo would have  any effect upon the world.    The Emperor had gone North on his yacht, but, as I believe, not  until a certain line of action had been agreed upon.    Most of the diplomats started on their vacations. Sir Edward  Goschen, British Ambassador, as well as the Russian Ambassador,  left Berlin. This shows, of course, how little war was expected  in diplomatic circles.    I went on two visits to German country-houses in Silesia, where  the richest estates are situated. One of these visits was to the  country-house of a Count, one of the wealthiest men in Germany,  possessed of a fortune of about twenty to thirty million dollars.  He has a great estate in Silesia, farmed, as I explained, not by  tenant farmers, but by his own superintendents. In the centre is  a beautiful country house or castle. We were thirty-two guests in  the house-party. This Count and his charming wife had travelled  much and evidently desired to model their country life on that  of England. Our amusements were tennis, swimming and clay-pigeon  shooting, with dancing and music at night. Life such as this,  and especially, the lavish entertainment of so many guests, is  something very exceptional in Prussian country life and quite  a seven months' wonder for the country side.    Some days after my return to Berlin the ultimatum of Austria  was sent to Serbia. Even then there was very little excitement,  and, when the Serbian answer was published, it was believed that  this would end the incident, and that matters would be adjusted  by dilatory diplomats in the usual way.    On the twenty-sixth of July, matters began to boil. The Emperor  returned on this day and, from the morning of the twenty-seventh,  took charge. On the twenty-seventh, also, Sir Edward Goschen  returned to Berlin. I kept in touch, so far as possible, with  the other diplomats, as the German officials were exceedingly  uncommunicative, although I called on von Jagow every day and tried  to get something out of him. On the night of the twenty-ninth,  the Chancellor and Sir Edward had their memorable conversation in  which the Chancellor, while making no promises about the French  colonies, agreed, if Great Britain remained neutral, to make  \"no territorial aggressions at the expense of France.\"    The Chancellor further stated to Sir Edward, that ever since he  had been Chancellor the object of his policy had been to bring  about an understanding with England and that he had in mind a  general neutrality agreement between Germany and England.    On the thirtieth, Sir Edward Grey refused the bargain proposed,  namely that Great Britain should engage to stand by while the  French colonies were taken and France beaten, so long as French  territory was not taken. Sir Edward Grey said that the so-called  bargain at the expense of France would constitute a disgrace  from which the good name of Great Britain would never recover.  He also refused to bargain with reference to the neutrality of  Belgium.    Peace talk continued, however, on both the thirtieth and  thirty-first, and many diplomats were still optimistic. On the  thirty-first I was lunching at the Hotel Bristol with Mrs. Gerard  and Thomas H. Birch, our minister to Portugal, and his wife.  I left the table and went over and talked to Mouktar Pascha,  the Turkish Ambassador, who assured me that there was no danger  whatever of war. But in spite of his assurances and judging by  the situation and what I learned from other diplomats, I had  cabled to the State"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7254"],[0,"Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equinoctial Regions of America, During the (#16)"],[1," 6 pages 157 and 206.) Later discoveries,  however, leave no doubt that there existed a centre of civilization in  those countries.) A branch of the Rio Magdalena flowed to the Laguna  de Maracaybo; and the lake of Xarayes, near which a southern Dorado  was placed, communicated with the Amazon, the Miari* (Meary) (* As  this river flows into the gulf of Maranhao (so named because some  French colonists, Rifault, De Vaux, and Ravadiere, believed they were  opposite the mouth of the Maranon or Amazon), the ancient maps call  the Meary Maranon, or Maranham. See the maps of Hondius, and Paulo de  Forlani. Perhaps the idea that Pincon, to whom the discovery of the  real Maranon is due, had landed in these parts, since become  celebrated by the shipwreck of Ayres da Cunha, has also contributed to  this confusion. The Meary appears to me identical with the Rio de  Vicente Pincon of Diego Ribeyro, which is more than one hundred and  forty leagues from that of the modern geographers. At present the name  of Maranon has remained at the same time to the river of the Amazons,  and to a province much farther eastward, the capital of which is  Maranhao, or St. Louis de Maranon.) and the Rio de San Francisco.  These hydrographic reveries have for the most part disappeared; but  the lakes Cassipa and Dorado have been long simultaneously preserved  on our maps.    In following the history of geography we see the Cassipa, figured as a  rectangular parallelogram, enlarge by degrees at the expense of El  Dorado. While the latter is sometimes suppressed, no one ventures to  touch the former,* which is the Rio Paragua (a tributary stream of the  Caroni) enlarged by temporary inundations. (* Sanson, Course of the  Amazon, 1680; De L'Isle, Amerique Merid. 1700. D'Anville, first  edition of his America, 1748.) When D'Anville learned from the  expedition of Solano that the sources of the Orinoco, far from lying  to the west, on the back of the Andes of Pasto, came from the east,  from the mountains of Parima, he restored in the second edition of his  fine map of America (1760) the Laguna Parime, and very arbitrarily  made it to communicate with three rivers, the Orinoco, the Rio Branco,  and the Essequibo, by the Mazuruni and the Cujuni; assigning to it the  latitude from 3 to 4 degrees north, which had till then been given to  lake Cassipa.    I have now stated, as I announced above, the variable forms which  geographical errors have assumed at different periods. I have  explained what in the configuration of the soil, the course of the  rivers, the names of the tributary streams, and the multiplicity of  the portages, may have given rise to the hypothesis of an inland sea  in the centre of Guiana. However dry discussions of this nature may  appear, they ought not to be regarded as sterile and fruitless. They  show travellers what remains to be discovered; and make known the  degree of certainty which long-repeated assertions may claim. It is  with maps, as with those tables of astronomical positions which are  contained in our ephemerides, designed for the use of navigators: the  most heterogeneous materials have been employed in their construction  during a long space of time; and, without the aid of the history of  geography, we could scarcely hope to discover at some future day on  what authority every partial statement rests.    Before I resume the thread of my narrative, it remains for me to add a  few general reflections on the auriferous lands situate between the  Amazon and the Orinoco. We have just shown that the fable of El  Dorado, like the most celebrated fables of the nations of the ancient  world, has been applied progressively to different spots. We have seen  it advance from the south-west to the north-east, from the oriental  declivity of the Andes towards the plains of Rio Branco and the  Essequibo, an identical direction with that in which the Caribs for  ages conducted their warlike and mercantile expeditions. It may be  conceived that the gold of the Cordilleras might be conveyed from hand  to hand, through an infinite number of tribes, as far as the shore of  Guiana; since, long before the fur-trade had attracted English,  Russian, and American vessels to the north-west coast of America, iron  tools had been carried from New Mexico and Canada beyond the Rocky  Mountains. From an error in longitude, the traces of which we find in  all the maps of the 16th century, the auriferous mountains of Peru and  New Granada were supposed to be much nearer the mouths of the Orinoco  and the Amazon than they are in fact. Geographers have the habit of  augmenting and extending beyond measure countries that are recently  discovered. In the map of Peru, published at Verona by Paulo di  Forlani, the town of Quito is placed at the distance of 400 leagues  from the coast of the South Sea, on the meridian of Cumana; and the  Cordillera of the Andes there fills almost the whole surface of  Spanish, French, and Dutch Guiana. This erroneous opinion of the  breadth of the Andes has no doubt contributed to give so much  importance to the granitic plains that extend on their eastern side.  Unceasingly confounding the tributary streams of the Amazon with those  of the Orinoco, or (as the lieutenants of Raleigh called it, to  flatter their chief) the Rio Raleana, to the latter were attributed  all the traditions which had been collected respecting the Dorado of  Quixos, the Omaguas, and the Manoas.* (* The flight of Manco-Inca,  brother of Atahualpa, to the east of the Cordilleras, no doubt gave  rise to the tradition of the new empire of the Incas in Dorado. It was  forgotten that Caxamarca and Cuzco, two towns where the princes of  that unfortunate family were at the time of their emigration, are  situate to the south of the Amazon, in the latitudes seven degrees  eight minutes, and thirteen degrees twenty-one minutes south, and  consequently four hundred leagues south-west of the pretended town of  Manoa on the lake Parima (three degrees and a half north latitude). It  is probable that, from the extreme difficulty of penetration into the  plains east of the Andes, covered with forests, the fugitive princes  never went beyond the banks of the Beni. The following is what I  learnt with certainty respecting the emigration of the family of the  Inca, some sad vestiges of which I saw on passing by Caxamarca.  Manco-Inca, acknowledged as the legitimate successor of Atahualpa,  made war without success against the Spaniards. He retired at length  into the mountains and thick forests of Vilcabamba, which are  accessible either by Huamanga and Antahuaylla, or by the valley of  Yucay, north of Cuzco. Of the two Sons of Manco-Inca, the eldest,  Sayri-Tupac, surrendered himself to the Spaniards, upon the invitation  of the viceroy of Peru, Hurtado de Mendoza. He was received with great  pomp at Lima, was baptized there, and died peaceably in the fine  valley of Yucay. The youngest son of Manco-Inca, Tupac-Amaru, was  carried off by stratagem from the forests of Vilcabamba, and beheaded  on pretext of a conspiracy formed against the Spanish usurpers. At the  same period, thirty-five distant relations of the Inca Atahualpa were  seized, and conveyed to Lima, in order to remain under the inspection  of the Audiencia. (Garcilasso volume 2 pages 194, 480 and 501.) It is  interesting to inquire whether any other princes of the family of  Manco-Capac have remained in the forests of Vilcabamba, and if there  still exist any descendants of the Incas of Peru between the Apurimac  and the Beni. This supposition gave rise in 1741 to the famous  rebellion of the Chuncoes, and to that of the Amages and Campoes led  on by their chief, Juan Santos, called the false Atahualpa. The late  political events of Spain have liberated from prison the remains of  the family of Jose Gabriel Condorcanqui, an artful and intrepid man,  who, under the name of the Inca Tupac-Amaru, attempted in 1781 that  restoration of the ancient dynasty which Raleigh had projected in the  time of Queen Elizabeth.) The geographer Hondius supposed that the  Andes of Loxa, celebrated for their forests of cinchona, were only  twenty leagues distant from the lake Parima, or the banks of the Rio  Branco. This proximity procured credit to the tidings of the flight of  the Inca into the forests of Guiana, and the removal of the treasures  of Cuzco to the easternmost parts of that country. No doubt in going  up towards the east, either by the Meta or by the Amazon, the  civilization of the natives, between the Puruz, the Jupura, and the  Iquiari, was observed to increase. They possessed amulets, little  idols of molten gold, and chairs, elegantly carved; but these traces  of dawning civilization are far distant from those cities and houses  of stone described by Raleigh and those who followed him. We have made  drawings of some ruins of great edifices east of the Cordilleras, when  going down from Loxa towards the Amazon, in the province of Jaen de  Bracamoros; and thus far the Incas had carried their arms, their  religion, and their arts. The inhabitants of the Orinoco were also,  before the conquest, when abandoned to themselves, somewhat more  civilized than the independent hordes of our days. They had populous  villages along the river, and a regular trade with more southern  nations; but nothing indicates that they ever constructed an edifice  of stone. We saw no vestige of any during the course of our journey.    Though the celebrity of the riches of Spanish Guiana is chiefly  assignable to the geographical situation of the country and the errors  of the old maps, we are not justified in denying the existence of any  auriferous land in the tract of country of eighty-two thousand square  leagues, which stretches between the Orinoco and the Amazon, on the  east of the Andes of Quito and New Granada. What I saw of this country  between the second and eighth degrees of latitude, and the sixty-sixth  "]]]
