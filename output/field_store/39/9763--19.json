Emily must establish what she has said, if she can.--I am in no  haste about it; it maybe to-morrow, or the next day, or the day  after--whenever it suits you and her in short; but it must be done.  Conscious that I am innocent of such great offences, I can wait patiently;  and I do not think, my dear friend, that although I see you have been a  little startled by these strange tales, you will give any credence to them  in your heart till they are proved. Dear Emily is evidently very much in  love with Mr. Marlow, and is anxious to remove all opposition to her  marriage with him. But I think she must take some other means; for these  will certainly break down beneath her.\"    She spoke so calmly, and in so quiet and gentle a tone--her whole look and  manner as so tranquilly confident--that lady Hastings could hardly believe  that she was in any degree guilty.    \"Well, I cannot tell,\" she said, \"how this may turn out, but I do not think  her marriage with Mr. Marlow can have any thing to do with it. I have fully  and entirely resolved to cease all opposition to her union; on which I see  my daughter's happiness is staked, and I shall certainly immediately  signify my consent both to Emily and to my husband.\"    \"Wait a little--wait a little\" said Mrs. Hazleton with a significant nod of  the head. \"I have no mysteries, my dear friend. I have nothing to conceal  or to hold back. You are going, however, to act upon information which is  very doubtful. I believe that you have been deceived, whoever has told you  that Mr. Marlow is the heir to the Earl of Launceston, and it is but an act  of friendship on my part to procure you more certain intelligence. You  shall have it I promise you, before four and twenty hours are over, and all  I ask is that you will not commit yourself by giving your consent till that  intelligence has been obtained. You cannot say that you consent if Mr.  Marlow proves to be the heir of that nobleman, but will not consent if such  be not the case.--That would never do, and therefore your consent would be  irrevocable. But on the other hand there can be no great harm in waiting  four and twenty hours at the utmost. I have plenty of books of heraldry and  genealogy, which will soon let me into the facts, and you shall know them  plainly and straightforwardly at once. You can then decide and state your  decision firmly and calmly, with just reason and upon good grounds.\"    Lady Hastings was silent. She saw that Mrs. Hazleton had detected the  motives of her sudden change of views, and she did not much like being  detected. She had fully made up her mind, too, that Marlow was to become  Earl and her daughter Countess of Launceston, and the very thought of such  not being the result was a sort of half disappointment to her. Now Lady  Hastings did not like being disappointed at all, and moreover she had made  up her mind to have a scene of reconciliation, and tenderness, and  gratitude with her husband and her daughter, from which--being of a truly  affectionate disposition--she thought she should derive great pleasure.  Thus she hesitated for a moment as to what she should answer, and Mrs.  Hazleton, determined not to let the effect of what she had said subside  before she had bound her more firmly, added, after waiting a short time for  a reply, \"you will promise me, will you not, that you will not distinctly  recall your injunction, and give your consent to the marriage till you have  seen me again; provided I do not keep you in suspense more than four and  twenty hours? It is but reasonable too, and just, and you would, I am sure,  repent bitterly if you were to find afterwards that your consent to this  very unequal marriage had been obtained by deceit, and that you had been  made a mere fool of--Really at the very first sight, even if I had not good  reason to believe that this story of the heirship is either a mistake or a  misrepresentation, it seems so like a stage trick--the cunning plot of some  knavish servant or convenient friend in a drama--that I should be very  doubtful. Will you not promise me then?\"    \"Well, there can be no great harm in waiting that length of time,\" said  Lady Hastings. \"I do not mind promising that; but of course you will let me  know within four and twenty hours.\"    \"I will,\" replied Mrs. Hazleton firmly; \"earlier if it be possible; but the  fact is, I have some business to settle to-morrow of great importance. My  lawyer, Mr. Shanks--whom I believe to be a great rogue--persuaded me to  lend some money upon security which he pronounced himself to be good. I  knew not what it was for; as we women of course can be no judges of such  things; but I have just discovered that it was to pay off some debts of  this young man who calls himself Sir John Hastings. Now I don't know  whether the papers have been signed, or any thing about it; and I hear that  the young man himself is absent, no one knows where. It makes me very  uneasy; and I have sent for Shanks to come to me to-morrow morning. It may  therefore be the middle of the day before I can get here; but I will not  delay a moment, you may be perfectly sure.\"    She had risen as she spoke, and after pressing the hand of Lady Hastings  tenderly in her own, she glided calmly out of the room with her usual  graceful movement, and entering her carriage with a face as serene as a  summer sky, ordered the coachman to drive home in a voice that wavered not  in its lightest tone.      CHAPTER XLIII.    Mrs. Hazelton entered the carriage, I have said, at the end of the last  chapter, without the slightest appearance of agitation or excitement.  Although now and then a flush, and now and then a paleness, had spread over  her face during the conversation with Lady Hastings, though her eye had  emitted an occasional flash, and at other times had seemed fixed and  meaningless, such indications of internal warfare were all banished when  she left the room, the fair smooth cheek had its natural color, the eye was  as tranquil as that of indifferent old age.    The coachman cracked his long whip, before four magnificent large horses  heaved the ponderous vehicle from its resting place, and Mrs. Hazleton sank  back in the carriage and gave herself up to thought--but not to thought  only. Then all the smothered agitation; then all the strong contending  passions broke forth in fierce and fiery warfare. It is impossible to  disentangle them and lay them out, as on a map, before the reader's mind.  It is impossible to say which at first predominated, rage, or fear, or  disappointment, or the thirst of vengeance. One passion it is true--the one  which might be called the master passion of her nature--soon soared  towering above the rest, like one of those mighty spirits which rise to the  dizzy and dangerous pinnacle of power in the midst of the turbulence and  tempest which accompany great social earthquakes. But at first all was  confusion.    \"Never,\" she repeated to herself--\"never!--it shall never be. If I slay her  with my own hand it shall never be--foiled--frustrated in every thing; and  by this mere empty, moody child, who has been my stumbling block, my enemy,  my obstruction, in all my paths. No, no, it shall never be!\"    A new strain of thought seemed to strike her; her head leaned forward; her  eyes closed, and her lips quivered.    There are many kinds of conscience, and every one has some sort, such as it  is. What I mean is, that there is almost in every heart a voice of warning  and reproof which counsels us to regret certain actions, and which speaks  in different tones to different men. To the worldly--those who are  habitually of the earth earthly--it holds out the menace of earthly shame  and misfortune and sorrow. It recapitulates the mistakes we have committed,  points to the evil consequences of evil deeds, shows how the insincerities  and falsehoods of our former course have proved fruitless, and how the  cunning devices, and skilful contrivances, and artful stratagems, have  ended in mortification and reproach and contempt; while still the gloomy  prospects of detection and exposure and public contumely and personal  punishment, are held up before our eyes as the grim portrait of the future.    I need not pause here to show how conscience affects those who, however  guilty, have a higher sense--those who have a cloudy belief in a future  state--who acknowledge in their own hearts a God of justice--who look to  judgment, and feel that there must be an immortality of weal or woe. Mrs.  Hazleton was of the former class. The grave was a barrier to her sight,  beyond which there was no seeing. She had been brought up for this world,  lived in this world, thought, devised, schemed, plotted for this world. She  never thought of another world at all. She went to church regularly every  Sunday, read the prayers with every appearance of devotion, even listened  to the sermon if the preacher preached well, and went home more practically  atheist than many who have professed themselves so.    What were her thoughts, then, now? They were all earthly still. Even  conscience spoke to her in earthly language, as if there were no other  means of reaching her heart but that. Its very menaces were all earthly.  She reviewed her conduct for the last two or three years, and bitterly  reproached herself for several faults she discovered therein--faults of  contrivance, of design, of execution. She had made mistakes; and for a time  she gave herself up to bitter repentance for that great crime.    \"Caught in my own trap,\" she said; \"frustrated by a girl--a child!--ay! and  with exposure, perhaps punishment, before me. How she triumphs, doubtless,  in that little malignant heart. How she will triumph when she brings  forward her proofs, and overwhelms me with them--if she has them. Oh, yes,  she has them! She is mighty careful never to say any thing of which she is  not certain. I have remarked that in her from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3657"],[0,"Wild Beasts and Their Ways, Reminiscences of Europe, Asia, Africa and America — (#16)"],[1,"imagined  that wholesale destruction is the result whenever some favourable  opportunity delivers a large herd of elephants into the native hands.    There are various methods employed for trapping, or otherwise  destroying. Pitfalls are the most common, as they are simple, and  generally fatal. Elephants are thirsty creatures, and when in large  herds they make considerable roads in their passage towards a river.  They are nearly always to be found upon the same track when nightly  approaching the usual spot for drinking or for a bath. It is therefore a  simple affair to intercept their route by a series of deep pitfalls dug  exactly in the line of their advance. These holes vary in shape; the  circular are, I believe, the most effective, as the elephant falls head  downwards, but I have seen them made of different shapes and proportions  according to the individual opinions of the trappers.    It is exceedingly dangerous, when approaching a river, to march in  advance of a party without first sending forward a few natives to  examine the route in front. The pits are usually about 12 or 14 feet in  depth. These are covered over with light wood, and crossed with slight  branches or reeds, upon which is laid some long dry grass; this is  covered lightly with soil, upon which some elephant's dung is scattered,  as though the animal had dropped it during the action of walking. A  little broken grass is carelessly distributed upon the surface, and the  illusion is complete. The night arrives, and the unsuspecting elephants,  having travelled many miles of thirsty wilderness, hurry down the  incline towards the welcome river. Crash goes a leading elephant into a  well-concealed pitfall! To the right and left the frightened members of  the herd rush at the unlooked-for accident, but there are many other  pitfalls cunningly arranged to meet this sudden panic, and several more  casualties may arise, which add to the captures on the following  morning, when the trappers arrive to examine the position of their pits.  The elephants are then attacked with spears while in their helpless  position, until they at length succumb through loss of blood.    There is another terrible method of destroying elephants in Central  Africa. During the dry season, when the withered herbage from 10 to 14  feet in height is most inflammable, a large herd of elephants may be  found in the middle of such high grass that they can only be perceived  should a person be looking down from some elevated point. If they should  be espied by some native hunter, he would immediately give due notice to  the neighbourhood, and in a short time the whole population would  assemble for the hunt. This would be arranged by forming a circle of  perhaps 2 miles in diameter, and simultaneously firing the grass so as  to create a ring of flames around the centre. An elephant is naturally  afraid of fire, and it has an instinctive horror of the crackling of  flames when the grass has been ignited. As the circle of fire contracts  in approaching the encircled herd, they at first attempt retreat until  they become assured of their hopeless position; they at length become  desperate, being maddened by fear, and panic-stricken by the wild shouts  of the thousands who have surrounded them. At length, half-suffocated by  the dense smoke, and terrified by the close approach of the roaring  flames, the unfortunate animals charge recklessly through the fire,  burnt and blinded, to be ruthlessly speared by the bloodthirsty crowd  awaiting this last stampede. Sometimes a hundred or more elephants are  simultaneously destroyed in this wholesale slaughter. The flesh is then  cut into long strips and dried, every portion of the animal being smoked  upon frames of green wood, and the harvest of meat is divided among the  villages which have contributed to the hunt. The tusks are also shared,  a certain portion belonging by right to the various headmen and the  chief.    When man determines to commence war with the animal kingdom the result  must be disastrous to the beasts, if the human destroyers are in  sufficient numbers to ensure success. Although fire-arms may not be  employed, the human intelligence must always overpower the brute  creation, but man must exist in numerical superiority if the wild beasts  are to be fairly vanquished by a forced retreat from the locality. From  my own observation I have concluded that wild animals of all kinds will  withstand the dangers of traps, pitfalls, fire, and the usual methods  for their destruction employed by savages, but they will be rapidly  cleared out of an extensive district by the use of fire-arms. There is a  peculiar effect in the report of guns which appears to excite the  apprehension of danger in the minds of all animals. This is an  extraordinary instance of the general intelligence of wild creatures, as  they must be accustomed to the reports of thunder since the day of their  birth. Nevertheless they draw a special distinction between the loud  peal of thunder and the comparatively innocent explosion of a fire-arm.    Many years ago in Ceylon I devoted particular attention to this subject,  especially as it affects the character of elephants. How those creatures  manage to communicate with each other it is impossible to determine, but  the fact remains that a very few days' shooting will clear out an  extensive district, although the area may comprise a variation of open  prairie with a large amount of forest. I have frequently observed, in  the portion of Ceylon known as the Park country, the tracks of elephants  in great numbers which have evidently been considerable herds that have  joined together in a general retreat from ground which they considered  insecure. In that district I have arrived at the proper season, when the  grass after burning has grown to the height of about 2 feet, and it has  literally been alive with elephants. In a week my late brother General  Valentine Baker and myself shot thirty-two, and I sent a messenger to  invite a friend to join us, in the expectation of extraordinary sport.  Upon his arrival after five or six days, there was not an elephant in  the country, excepting two or three old single bulls which always  infested certain spots.    The reports of so many heavy rifles, which of necessity were fired every  evening at dusk in the days of muzzle-loaders, for the sake of cleaning,  must have widely alarmed the country, but independently of this special  cause there can be no doubt that after a few days' heavy shooting, the  elephants will combine in some mysterious manner and disappear from an  extensive district. In many ways these creatures are perplexing to the  student of natural history. It would occur to most people that in  countries where elephants abound we should frequently meet with those  that are sick, or so aged that they cannot accompany the herd. Although  for very many years I have hunted both in Asia and Africa I have never  seen a sick elephant in a wild state, neither have I ever come across an  example of imbecility through age. It is rarely we discover a dead  elephant that has not met with a violent death, and only once in my life  have I by accident found the remains of a tusker with the large tusks  intact. This animal had been killed in a fight, as there were  unmistakable signs of a fearful struggle, the ground being trodden  deeply in all directions.    It is supposed by the natives that when an elephant is mortally sick it  conceals itself in the thickest and most secluded portion of the jungle,  to die in solitude. Most animals have the same instinct, which induces  them to seek the shelter of some spot remote from all disturbance; and  should we find their remains, it will be near water, where the thirst of  disease has been assuaged at the last moment. The ox tribe are subject  to violent epidemics, and I have not only found the bodies of buffaloes  in great numbers upon occasions during some malignant murrain, but they  have been scattered throughout the country in all directions, causing a  frightful stench, and probably extending the infection. A few years ago  there was an epidemic among the bisons in the Reipore district of India;  this spread into neighbouring districts over a large extent of country,  and caused fearful ravages, but none of the deer tribe were attacked,  the disease being confined specially to the genus Bos. There are  interesting proofs of the specific poison of certain maladies which are  limited in their action to a particular class of animal. We find the  same in vegetable diseases, where a peculiar insect will attack a  distinct family of plants, or where a special variety of fungoid growth  exerts a similar baneful influence.    Wounded elephants have a marvellous power of recovery when in their wild  state, although they have no gift of surgical knowledge, their simple  system being confined to plastering their wounds with mud, or blowing  dust upon the surface. Dust and mud comprise the entire pharmacopoeia of  the elephant, and this is applied upon the most trivial as well as upon  the most serious occasion. If an elephant has a very slight sore back,  it will quickly point out the tender part by blowing dust with its  trunk upon the spot which it cannot reach. Should the mahout have  seriously punished the crown with the cruel driving-hook, the elephant  applies dust at the earliest opportunity. I have seen them, when in a  tank, plaster up a bullet-wound with mud taken from the bottom. This  application is beneficial in protecting the wound from the attack of  flies. The effect of these disgusting insects is quite shocking when an  unfortunate animal becomes fly-blown, and is literally consumed by  maggots. An elephant possesses a wonderful superiority over all other  animals in the trunk, which can either reach the desired spot directly,  or can blow dust upon it when required.
