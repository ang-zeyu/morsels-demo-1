This was on the  morning of January 25th, and until the 31st about noon we saw no further  signs of water. Every likely place was dry. Where Luck and I had found  water before, not a drop of moisture could be seen; the holes contained  nothing but the feathers and skeletons of disappointed birds. Unable to  stop at Mount Ida without packing water twenty-five miles, which the  prospects of the country did not warrant, we turned northwards across much  broken granite country, which we vainly searched for Namma-holes or soaks.  Far ahead of us we could see sharp pinnacles, standing up high and  solitary above the scrub. These turned out to be huge blows of white  quartz, and were no doubt connected underground, for we traced them a  distance of nearly thirty miles. Interesting as these were, our thoughts  were turned to water-hunting, for the weather--the season being  midsummer--was scorching; the poor camels, sore-footed from the stony  granite, parched with thirst, and forced to carry their loads, eight to  twelve hours a day, showed signs of distress. Weary and footsore  ourselves, tramping at full speed all day over the burning rocks, one with  the camels, the others on either hand, scouting, our casks all but empty,  our position was not enviable.    The night of the 30th our water was finished. The nearest known to us was  thirty-five miles off, and a a salt lake was between--a sufficient bar to  our hopes in that direction. Matters were by no means desperate, however,  for thirty miles north we were bound to cut the Cue-Mount Margaret road,  and having done so it would be merely a question of time, with a certainty  of arriving at a watering place eventually, if we and our camels could  hold out. A dry stage, however long, with the certainty of relief at the  end of it, gives little cause for anxiety when compared with one on which  neither the position nor even the existence of water can be known.    Next morning we followed up a small creek, and on crossing saw the tracks  of several kangaroos and emus making towards two peaks of quartz. Here was  our chance. It was my place of course to go, but I yielded to the  persuasion of Paddy and Jim, who insisted that I had denied myself water  to eke out our scanty supply (though I doubt if I had done so more than  they), and must rest. So, putting the camels down in the welcome shade of  a kurrajong, I lay down beside them and was presently relieved by the  sound of a revolver-shot, our signal that water was found.    What a beautiful sight it was! Nestling in the hollow between two great  white blows of quartz, this little pool of crystal-clear water, filled  evidently by a little gully falling over a steep ledge of quartz beyond,  presented no doubt a pretty picture after the rains. A soakage it must be,  for no open rock-hole could hold water in such terrible heat; and its  clearness would suggest the possibility of an underlying spring. A popular  drinking-place this, frequented by birds of all kinds, crows, hawks,  pigeons, galahs, wee-jugglers, and the ubiquitous diamond-sparrows. During  the night we could hear wallabies hopping along, but were too worn out to  sit up to shoot them. Though our sufferings had not been great, we had had  a \"bit of a doing.\"    One day's rest, occupied in various mendings of clothes, boots, and  saddles, and we were off again to the north, cutting the track as  expected, and presently found ourselves at the newly established mining  camp of Lawlers, prettily situated on the banks of a gum-creek, with a  copious supply of water in wells sunk in its bed. A great advantage that  the northern fields have over those further south is the occurrence of  numerous creeks, sometimes traceable for over thirty miles, in all of  which an abundance of fresh water can be obtained by sinking at depths  varying from fifteen to fifty feet.    Towards the end of their course the well-defined channels, with banks  sometimes ten feet high, disappear, giving place to a grassy avenue  through the scrub, lightly timbered with cork-bark, and other small trees.  It is on such flats as these that the wells are sunk. All creeks find  their way into the lakes, though seldom by a discernible channel, breaking  and making, as the expression is, until a narrow arm of the lake stretches  to meet them. At the most these creeks run \"a banker\" three times during  the year, the water flowing for perhaps three days; after which pools of  various sizes remain, to be in their turn dried up by evaporation and  soakage. In the dry weather the creeks afford a weird spectacle. Stately  white gums (the only timber of any size in these districts), with their  silvery bark hanging in dishevelled shreds around the branchless stems,  bend ghost-like over an undulating bed of gravel; gravel made up of  ironstone pebbles, quartz fragments, and other water-worn debris washed  down from the hills at the head of the creeks.    What a marvellous transformation the winter rains cause! It is then that  the expert, or journalist, takes his walks abroad; it is then that we read  such glowing accounts of rich grass lands, watered by countless creeks,  only awaiting the coming of an agriculturist to be turned into smiling  farms and fertile fields.    Numerous parties were camped at Lawlers, with some two hundred horses  turned out in the bush, waiting until rain should fall. Though with no  better feed than grass, dry and withered, the freedom from work had made  them skittish. What a pretty sight it is to see a mob of horses trooping  in for water at night; the young colts kicking up their heels with  delight; the solemn old packhorse looking with scorn on the gambols of his  juvenile brethren, with a shake of his hardy old head, as much as to say,  \"Ah! wait till you've done the dry stages that I have; wait till you make  your evening feed off mulga scrub and bark--that'll take the buck out of  you! Why can't you have your drink soberly, instead of dancing about all  over the place?\"    Then bringing up the rear, far behind, just emerging from the scrub, are  seen those who, from their wandering habits, must wear the bracelets,  hurrying and shuffling along with a rattle of chains, tripping up in their  eagerness to be even with their mates in the scramble for water: presently  they pause to look about and neigh--a delay resented by those behind by a  friendly bite, answered by a kick; which starts them all off at full  gallop, in the approved rocking-horse style, with a tremendous clatter of  hobbles and bells. Suddenly they halt, snorting, and as suddenly start  aside, wheel round, and dash away, as they catch sight of our long-necked  beasts. They have seen them often enough, and know them well, but they  must keep up an appearance of panic, if only to please their masters, who  never cease to jeer at the ungainly shape of the camel, until they possess  one themselves. These unemotional animals watch the horses' play with lips  turned up in derision, and hardly deign to move their heads from the bush  or branch on which they are feeding. Many of the prospectors, though  openly sneering at the camels as slow and unmanageable beasts, secretly  envied us our ability to travel in hot weather, whilst they had nothing to  do but to kick their heels and be thankful they had feed and water for  their ponies. And they envied us all the more on account of the vague  rumour that rich gold had been found in the neighbourhood of Lake Darlot,  towards which some had pushed out only to be driven back by thirst. Seeing  our evident advantage, should the rumour prove correct, in being able to  get there before the crowd, I decided to steer for the lake, with the hope  of picking up the tracks of the supposed lucky diggers.    A large creek, the Erlistoun, was given on the chart as running into the  lake, and on it was marked by the discoverer Mr. Wells, of the Elder  Exploring Expedition, 1892, a permanent pool. To cut this creek was my  object, and, by following its course, to find the pool, and there make a  base from which to investigate the truth of the rumour.    Leaving Lawlers February 7th we struck an arm of the lake on the 10th  the country traversed being mostly sand plain, timbered with desert-gum.  To reach the creek it was necessary to cross the lake; and what a job we  had, twisting and turning to avoid one arm, only to be checked by another;  carrying packs and saddles across what we supposed to be the main lake,  only to find ourselves on an island. All things have an end, even the  ramifications of a salt lake, and eventually we and our mud-plastered  camels found ourselves on the northern shore; and travelling east,  expected confidently to cut the Erlistoun creek. By its position on the  map we should have already crossed it but to make sure we went on five  miles more, when our passage was barred by another salt lake not marked on  the chart. It was clear that the creek did not reach Lake Darlot. Where  could it be? Was it worth while to look for it further? It was evident how  it came to be so shown on the map. Mr. Wells had cut the creek near its  source and seeing only one lake to the south, naturally supposed that  it was joined by the creek, and so had marked its probable course by a  dotted line. His work, copied on to other maps had been carelessly drawn,  and the creek shown running in a defined channel into Lake Darlot. That  this was the case I found afterwards on studying his original chart.    Now to decide our best course! Again our supply was all but done, but we  knew of no water save Lawlers, sixty miles away, and to attempt to return  to that, recrossing the lake was manifestly absurd. To the south-west we  could see some hills which might or might not be granite. We were inclined  to think that they were, as in the setting sun of a few nights before they  had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4985"],[0,"Ruth Fielding of the Red Mill; Or, Jasper Parloe's Secret (#16)"],[1,"and show  herself to be quicker and more thorough in her preparation for  recitations than the older scholars naturally made some of the latter  more than a little jealous.    Up to this time Ruth had never been to the big yellow house on the  hill--\"Overlook,\" as Mr. Macy Cameron called his estate. Always  something had intervened when Ruth was about to go. But Helen and Tom  insisted upon the very next Saturday following the girls' trip to  Cheslow as the date when Ruth must come to the big house to luncheon.  The Camerons lived all of three miles from the Red Mill; otherwise  Ruth would in all probability have been to her chum's home before.    Tom agreed to run down in the machine for his sister's guest at  half-past eleven on the day in question, and Ruth hurried her tasks as  much as possible so as to be all ready when he appeared in the big  drab automobile. She even rose a little earlier, and the way she flew  about the kitchen and porch at her usual Saturday morning tasks was,  as Aunt Alvirah said, \"a caution.\" But before Tom appeared Ruth saw,  on one of her excursions into the yard, the old, dock-tailed, bony  horse of Jasper Parloe drawing that gentleman in his rickety wagon up  to the mill door.    \"Hi, Jabe!\" called Jasper, in his cracked voice. \"Hi, Jabe! Here's a  grindin' for ye. And for massy's sake don't take out a double toll as  you us'ally do. Remember I'm a poor man--I ain't got lashin's of  money like you to count ev'ry night of my life--he, he, he!\"    The boy had appeared at the mill door first, and he stepped down and  would have taken the bag of grain out of the wagon, had not the miller  himself suddenly appeared and said, in his stern way:    \"Let it be.\"    \"Hi, Jabe!\" cackled Jasper. \"Don't be mean about it. He's younger than  me, or you. Let him shoulder the sack into the mill.\"    \"The sack isn't coming into the mill,\" said Jabez, shortly.    \"What? what?\" cried Parloe. \"You haven't retired from business; have  you, miller? Ye ain't got so wealthy that ye ain't goin' to grind any  more?\"    \"I grind for those whom it pleases me to grind for,\" said the miller,  sternly.    \"Then take in the bag, boy,\" said Jasper, still grinning.    But Mr. Potter waved the boy away, and stood looking at Jasper with  folded arms and a heavy frown upon his face.    \"Come, come, Jabe! you keep a mill. You grind for the public, you  know,\" said Jasper.    \"I grind no more for you,\" rejoined the miller. \"I have told you so.  Get you gone, Jasper Parloe.\"    \"No,\" said the latter, obstinately. \"I am going to have my meal.\"    \"Not here,\" said the miller.    \"Now, that's all nonsense, Jabe,\" exclaimed Jasper Parloe, wagging his  head. \"Ye know ye can't refuse me.\"    \"I do refuse you.\"    \"Then ye'll take the consequences, Jabe--ye'll take the consequences.  Ye know very well if I say the word to Mr. Cameron--\"    \"Get away from here!\" commanded Potter, interrupting. \"I want nothing  to do with you.\"    \"You mean to dare me; do ye, Jabe?\" demanded Jasper, with an evil  smile.    \"I don't mean to have anything to do with a thief,\" growled the  miller, and turning on his heel went back into the mill.    It was just then that Ruth spied the automobile coming down the road  with Tom Cameron at the steering wheel. Ruth bobbed into the house in  a hurry, with a single wave of her hand to Tom, for she was not yet  quite ready. When she came down five minutes later, with a fresh  ribbon in her hair and one of the new frocks that she had never worn  before looking its very trimmest, Jasper Parloe had alighted from his  ramshackle wagon and was talking with Tom, who still sat in the  automobile.    And as Ruth stood in the porch a moment, while Aunt Alvirah proudly  looked her over to see that she was all right, the girl saw by the  expression on Tom's face that whatever Parloe talked about was not  pleasing the lad in the least.    She saw, too, that Tom pulled something from his pocket hastily and  thrust it into Parloe's hand. The old man chuckled slily, said  something else to the boy, and then turned away and climbed into his  wagon again. He drove away as Ruth ran down the path to the waiting  auto.    \"Hullo, Tom!\" she cried. \"I told you I wouldn't keep you waiting  long.\"    \"How-do, Ruth,\" he returned; but it must be confessed that he was not  as bright and smiling as usual, and he looked away from Ruth and after  Parloe the next moment.    As the girl reached the machine Uncle Jabez came to the mill door  again. He observed Ruth about to get in and he came down the steps and  strode toward the Cameron automobile. Jasper Parloe had clucked to his  old nag and was now rattling away from the place.    \"Where are you going, Ruth?\" the miller demanded, sternly eyeing Tom  Cameron, and without returning the lad's polite greeting.    \"She is going up to our house to lunch with my sister, Mr. Potter,\"  Tom hastened to say before Ruth could reply.    \"She will do nothing of the kind,\" said Uncle Jabez, shortly. \"Ruth,  go back to the house and help your Aunt Alvirah. You are going about  too much and leaving your aunt to do everything.\"    This was not so, and Ruth knew very well that her uncle knew it was  not so. She flushed and hesitated, and he said:    \"Do you hear me? I expect to be obeyed if you remain here at the Red  Mill. Just because I lay few commands upon you, is no reason why you  should consider it the part of wisdom to be disobedient when I do give  an order.\"    \"Oh, Uncle! do let me go,\" begged Ruth, fairly crying. \"Helen has been  so kind to me--and Aunt Alvirah did not suppose you would object.  They come here--\"    \"But I do not propose that they shall come here any more,\" declared  Uncle Jabez, in the same stern tone. \"You can drive on, young man. The  less I see of any of you Camerons the better I shall like it.\"    \"But, Mr. Potter--\" began Tom.    The old man raised his hand and stopped him.    \"I won't hear any talk about it. I know just how much these Camerons  have done for you,\" he said to Ruth. \"They've done enough--altogether  too much. We will stop this intimacy right here and now. At least, you  will not go to their house, Ruth. Do as I tell you--go in to your  Aunt Alviry.\"    Then, as the weeping girl turned away, she heard him say, even more  harshly than he had spoken to her: \"I don't want anything to do with  people who are hand and glove with that Jasper Parloe. He's a thief--  a bigger thief, perhaps, than people generally know. At least, he's  cost me enough. Now, you drive on and don't let me see you or your  sister about here again.\"    He turned on his heel and went back to the mill without giving Tom  time to say a word. The boy, angry enough, it was evident from his  expression of countenance, hesitated several minutes after the miller  was gone. Once he arose, as though he would get out of the car and  follow Jabez into the mill. But finally he started the engine, turned  the car, and drove slowly away.    This was a dreadful day indeed for the girl of the Red Mill. Never in  her life had she been so hurt--never had she felt herself so ill-used  since coming to this place to live. Uncle Jabez had never been really  kind to her; but aside from the matter of the loss of her trunk he had  never before been actually cruel.    He could have selected no way that would have hurt her more keenly. To  refuse to let her go to see the girl she loved--her only close friend  and playmate! And to refuse to allow Helen and Tom to come here to see  her! This intimacy was all (and Ruth admitted it now, in a torrent of  tears, as she lay upon her little bed) that made life at the Red Mill  endurable. Had she not met Helen and found her such a dear girl and so  kind a companion, Ruth told herself now that she never could have  borne the dull existence of this house.    She heard Aunt Alvirah's halting step upon the stair and before the  old woman reached the top of the flight, Ruth plainly heard her  moaning to herself: \"Oh, my back! and oh, my bones!\" Thus groaning and  halting, Aunt Alvirah came to Ruth's door and pushed it open.    \"Oh, deary, deary, me!\" she whispered, limping into the room.  \"Don't-ee cry no more, poor lamb. Old Aunt Alviry knows jest how it  hurts--she wishes she could bear it for ye! Now, now, my pretty  creetur--don't-ee take on so. Things will turn out all right yet.  Don't lose hope.\"    She had reached the bed ere this and had gathered the sobbing girl  into her arms. She sat upon the side of the bed and rocked Ruth to and  fro, with her arms about her. She did not say much more, but her  unspoken sympathy was wonderfully comforting.    Aunt Alvirah did not criticise Uncle Jabez's course. She never did.  But she gave Ruth in her sorrow all the sympathy of which her great  nature was capable. She seemed to understand just how the girl felt,  without a spoken word on her part. She did not seek to explain the  miller's reason for acting as he did. Perhaps she had less idea than  had Ruth why Jabez Potter should have taken such a violent dislike to  the Camerons.    For Ruth half believed that she held the key to that mystery. When she  came to think it over afterward she put what she had heard between the  two old men--Jabez and Parloe--down at the brook, with what had  occurred at the mill just before Tom Cameron had come in sight; and  putting these two incidents together and remembering that Jasper  Parloe had overheard Tom in his delirium accuse the miller of being  the cause of his injury, Ruth was pretty sure that in that combination  of circumstances was the true explanation of Uncle Jabez's cruel  decision.    Ruth was not the girl to lie on her bed and weep for long. She was  sensible enough to know very well that such a display of  disappointment and sorrow would not better the circumstances. While  she remained at the Red Mill she must obey Uncle Jabez, and his  decisions could not be controverted. She had never won a place near  enough to"]]]
