In the twenty years that have elapsed since then he has written more  than a score of books, short stories, essays, criticisms, poetry,  polemics, some of which, such as \"L'Uomo Finito\" (\"The Played-Out Man\"),  \"Venti Quattro Cervelli\" (\"Twenty-four Minds\"), and \"Cento Pagine di  Poesia\" (\"One Hundred Pages of Poetry\"), have been widely read in Italy  and have known several editions. Save for a few short stories, he has  not appeared in English, though there seems to be propaganda in his  behalf directed by himself and by his friends of his publishing-house in  Florence to make him known to foreigners. Like other Italian propaganda  it has not been very successful and this is to be regretted. It is due  in part to the fact his advocates have claimed too much for him.    Signor Papini is like Mr. Arnold Bennett in that they both know the  reading public are personally interested in authors. From the beginning  he and his friends have capitalized his poverty of pulchritude and his  pulchritudinous poverty. Signor Giuseppe Prezzolini, in a book entitled  \"Discorso su Giovanni Papini\" has devoted several pages to his person,  which, he writes, \"is like those pears, coarse to the touch but sweet to  the palate,\" yet I am moved to say that the eye long habituated to  resting lovingly upon somatic beauty does not blink nor is it pained  when it rests upon Giovanni Papini.    In one of his latest books--it is never safe to say which is really his  last, unless you stand outside the door of the bindery of _La Voce_--in  one of his latest books, entitled \"Testimonials,\" the third series of  \"Twenty-four Brains,\" he reverts to this, and says that his person is  \"so repugnant that Mirabeau, world-famed for his ugliness, was compared  with him an Apollo.\"    He does not get the same exquisite pleasure from deriding his qualities  of soul, but, as the face is the mirror of the soul, no one is  astonished to learn that \"this same Papini is the gangster of  literature, the tough of journalism, the Barabbas of art, the dwarf of  philosophy, the straddler of politics, and the Apache of culture and  learning.\" Nevertheless, no prudent, sensitive man should permit himself  to say this or anything approximating it in Papini's hearing, for not  only has he a card index of substantives that convey derogation, but he  has perhaps the fullest arsenal of adjectives in Italy, and has  habituated himself to the use of them, both with and without  provocation.    I have been told by his schoolmates and by those whom he later essayed  to teach that as a youth he was inquisitive about the nature of things  and objects susceptible to physical and chemical explanation. His  writings indicate that his real seduction was conditioned by philosophic  questions. Early in life he displayed a symptom which is common to many  psychopaths--an uncontrollable desire to read philosophical writers  beyond their comprehension. In the twenty years that he has been  publishing books he has constantly returned to this practice, as shown  by his \"Twilight of the Philosophers,\" \"The Other Half,\" and  \"Pragmatism.\"    His first articles in the _Leonardo_, which now make up the volume known  as \"Il Tragico Quotidiano e il Pilota Cieco\" (\"The Tragedy of Every Day  and the Blind Pilot\"), are sketches and fantasies of a personal kind,  some of them fanciful and charming, some with a touch of inspired  extravagance that recall Baudelaire and Poe, and faintly echo Oscar  Wilde's \"Bells and Pomegranates,\" Dostoievsky's \"Poor People,\" and  Leonida Andreieff's \"Little Angel.\" Some of the stories have a weird  touch. Others are founded in obsession that form the ancillae of  psychopathy. Take, for instance, the man with a feeling of unreality who  did not really exist in flesh and blood but was only a figure in the  dream of some one else, and who felt that he would be vivified if only  he could find the sleeper and arouse him. This idea is not of infrequent  occurrence in that strange disorder, dementia precox; take again the man  who found his life dull and who covenanted with a novelist to do his  bidding in exchange for being made an interesting character; and the two  men who changed souls; and the talks with the devil interpreting  scripture. All these awaken an echo in the reader's mind of either  having been heard before or they bring the hope that they never will be  heard again.    Although his early writings had an arresting quality, it was not until  he undertook to edit some Italian classics published under the title of  \"I Nostri Scrittori\" (\"Our Writers\") that they began to take on the  features that have since become characteristic and which have been  described by his admirers as \"rugged, vigorous, virile, rich,  neologistic,\" and everything else the antithesis of pussy-foot. This  feature, if feature it can be called, showed itself first in \"L'Uomo  Finito,\" a book which is admitted to be an autobiography. It introduces  us to an ugly, sensitive, introspective, mentally prehensile child of  shut-in personality who is not only egocentric at seven but who loves  and exalts himself and despises and disparages others.    This unlovable child with an insatiate appetite for information found  his way to a public library and determined to write an encyclopaedia of  all knowledge. His juvenile frenzy came its first cropper when he  reached the letter \"B,\" and he was submerged with the Bible and with  God. The task was too big, he had to admit, but his ambition to  accomplish some great and thorough piece of work was undaunted. He began  a compendium of religions, then of literature, and last of the Romance  languages.    These successive attempts at completeness are typical of Papini's  far-reaching ambitions. \"The Played-Out Man\" is a record of his plunge  into one absorption after another. He discovered evil, and planned not  only individual suicide but suicide of the people _en masse_. Next came  the desire for love. His instincts were of a sort not to be satisfied by  the conventional sweetness of \"I Promessi Sposi,\" but from Poe, Walt  Whitman, Baudelaire, Flaubert, Dostoievsky, and Anatole France he got a  vicarious appeasement of the sentiment he craved. Then he encountered  \"dear Julian.\" \"We never kissed each other and we never cried together,\"  but he could not forgive Julian for allowing his friend to learn of his  matrimony only through the _Corriere della Sera_.    The brief emotional episode past, Papini's life interest swung back to  philosophy. He discovered Monism, and believed it like a religion. Then  Kant became his ideal, then Berkeley, Mill, Plato, Locke, culminating in  the glorified egotism of Max Stirner. After Stirner philosophy has no  more to say. Down with it all! It is necessary to liberate the world  from the yoke of these mumblers, just as Papini has liberated himself.  But how to do it! Ah, yes! Found a journal that will purge the world of  its sins, as the Great Revolution purged France of royalty.    Thus Papini's literary work had its beginning. It takes several  tempestuous chapters of the autobiography to describe the launching of  the _Leonardo_ by himself and a few congenial souls. Nine numbers marked  the limit of its really vigorous life, but it ran, with Papini as its  chief source of material, for five years. Ultimately, with the  dissipation of the author's youthful energy, this child of his bosom had  to be interred. But Papini still goes to its grave.    The tumultuous, introspective life of the author continued. He went  through a period of self-pity and neurasthenia, then one of intense  hero-worship directed toward all radicals, including William James, whom  he had once seen washing his neck. Then came an immense desire for  action, hindered, however, by the fact that the author could not decide  whether to found a school of philosophy, become the prophet of a  religion, or go into politics. His only inherent conviction concerns the  stupidity of the world and his own calling to rise above it. This long,  internal history ends with a period of sweeping depression, out of which  the author at last emerges with the intense conviction that he is not,  after all, played out, that there is still matter in him to give the  world. He feels welling up within him a stream of arrogance and  self-confidence that is not to be dammed. He has not yet delivered his  message; people have not yet understood him.        \"They cannot grasp it, cannot bear to listen.      The thing I have to tell, unthought before,      Demands another language.\"    So he goes back to the market-place of Florence, shouting: \"I have not  finished. I am not played out. You shall see.\" And it is at this stage  that Signor Papini's work now stands. We wait to see.    The \"L'Uomo Finito\" is Signor Papini's G. P. No. 2. It is not fiction in  the ordinary use of the term; any more than \"Undying Fire\" of Mr. Wells  is. In a measure it is fiction like \"The Way with All Flesh\" of Samuel  Butler. But in point of interest and workmanship it is far inferior to  the former and in purposefulness, character delineation, orientation,  resurrection, and reform it is not to be compared with the latter.    Although it is the book by which Signor Papini is best known, it is not  his love-child. \"The Twilight of the Philosophers\" is. He is proud to  call it his intellectual biography, but it would be much truer to call  it an index of his emotional equation. \"This is not a book of good  faith. It is a book of passion, therefore of injustice, an unequal book,  partisan, without scruples, violent, contradictory, unsolid, like all  books of those who love and hate and are not ashamed of their love or  their hatred.\" This is the introductory paragraph of the original  preface.    In reality it is a cross between a philosophic treatise and a popular  polemic, with the technical abstruseness of the one and the passion of  the other,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41990"],[0,"The Cid Campeador: A Historical Romance (#16)"],[1,"lance-page, and finally squire. Tired of the dangerous and agitated life  which those of his profession had to go through, and being the possessor  of a little money, which, by economy, he had saved during several years,  he bought a cottage, with a few acres of land, retired to it with his  wife and children, and had lived there for some time, quite ignorant of  what was passing in the world, for his dwelling-place was in a lonely  valley, the quietude of which was only disturbed once a year by pilgrims  who passed through it on their way to the shrine which was near it.    On the night succeeding the day on which the annual festival was held  there, Ivan was sleeping tranquilly, for he had taken part in the  pilgrimage, when, at the first crow of the cock, someone knocked and  called out loudly at the door. The farmer awoke, went to his window,  and asked, by no means in a good temper--    \"What drunken fellow is thumping at my door? By St. James! this is a  nice hour to disturb from their sleep people who have to get up early to  go to their field-work.\"    \"Anger of God! what a churl you are, Se[~n]or Ivan!\" answered the unknown  person, who did not appear to be in better humour than the farmer. \"Open  the door at once, and cease your chattering, for there is no drunkard  here, or anything like one. Don't you know me?\"    \"May God forsake me if it is not that fool Martin!\"    \"The very same, confound you! Open at once, if you don't want me to  break in the door.\"    The farmer hastened to light a candle, and to let the stranger in. On  seeing him he started back, horror-struck: everything showed that the  newly arrived had been engaged, a very short time before, in a fierce  fight; his hands, his face, and even his clothes were covered with  blood.    \"Glorious St. Isadore!\" exclaimed Ivan, \"what is the matter? You are  wounded?\"    \"In the soul!\" replied the young man. \"The wounds on my body matter  little, for they are only scratches that can easily be healed.\"    \"Let me examine them for you.\"    \"It is useless, Se[~n]or Ivan. Those which it is important for me to heal  are the wounds of my soul; the medicine you have to supply me with is a  lance, a crossbow, a sword, some arm or other, for I come to ask nothing  else of you.\"    \"I shall give you one with pleasure, for there are plenty of arms in my  house, thanks to my old profession, and also to the need I have of them  in this lonely place, where I have often to defend myself against  bandits.\"    Ivan approached the light to one of the walls, on which were hung  various arms, and added--    \"Take whichever you please, for the bravest knight of Leon or Castile  does not possess better tempered ones.\"    The young man took down a lance and also a sword, which he girt on with  as much skill as the most experienced cavalier could have used, and  said:--    \"Thanks, Se[~n]or Ivan. God be with you and do not tell anyone that you  have seen me to-night.\"    \"But, Martin, won't you tell me what you are going to do? What has  happened to you?\"    \"Some day you shall know, Se[~n]or Ivan.\"    \"But where are you going, my son?\"    \"To avenge my father, who lies dead in the wood; and Beatrice, who has  already perhaps been dishonoured by Don Suero--may God curse him, and  may this lance soon pierce him through!\"    \"May it be so!\" replied the farmer, embracing the young man, who,  throwing the lance across his shoulder, went forth from the house and  disappeared in the darkness.    Martin walked a long distance through the dark woods, until he came to  another house, situated in the midst of large and fertile meadows.    This house, or rather stable, belonged to Don Suero, and in it was kept  a magnificent stud of horses, the property of the count, which also had  the use of the meadows, and of which a single groom had the care.    Martin struck a heavy blow on the door of the stable.    \"Who is there?\" called out the groom.    \"Open, if you do not wish me to break in the door, and your head as  well.\"    The groom considered himself too weak to resist a man who spoke in such  a way. He opened the door, trembling, and said--    \"Pardon, sir cavalier.\"    \"I am not a cavalier,\" interrupted Martin; \"but I want to be one. Get  out the best horse you have in the stables.\"    \"I would be delighted to please your honour, but\"--    \"'Fore God! he addresses me with 'buts'!\" exclaimed Martin, placing his  hand on his sword.    \"Pardon me, sir cavalier,\" the groom said, terrified, going into the  stalls and unloosing one of the best horses; \"I only wished to tell you  that my master will almost beat me to death when he finds that I have  let one of his best horses be sto--I mean taken away. Does this one  please your lordship?\"    \"Yes,\" answered Martin; \"put that saddle on it, which I see hanging up  there.\"    \"Sir knight, that saddle is the one which is used in trying the paces of  the horses when my master comes to select one, and if you take it what  will become of me?\"    \"Be quick, I tell you; it will be only a few blows more or less,\" said  Martin in a threatening tone.    The groom saddled the horse without further reply. Martin buckled on a  pair of spurs, which he demanded from him, and, persuaded that the man  had not recognised him, he thought it most prudent to say no more. He  then sprang upon the horse, and giving the excellent steed a sharp  stroke, he disappeared through the adjacent fields.    Not far from the road which led from Burgos to Leon there was a hill,  situated so near it that its course could be seen from it for a long  distance; this hill was the resort of a band of robbers who at that time  were the terror of travellers who journeyed through that district.  Martin rode on to it, and arrived there shortly after daybreak. He  advanced a little into a wood which grew on the hill, and cried out,  making a kind of speaking-trumpet of his hand--    \"Hallo, bandits!\"    The look-out, whom the robbers had stationed not far from the place  where Martin stopped, had perceived him a short time before he spoke,  and as he saw that he came alone he did not think it necessary to give  the signal of alarm to his companions.    \"Where is the cavalier going?\" he cried out in his turn.    \"To ask that I may be admitted into your honourable band.\"    Martin knew that honour is such a fine thing that even bandits like it  to be attributed to them.    \"If such is your intention,\" said the look-out, \"follow the path you see  then, and at the end of it you will find the entire band, whose chief  will, perchance, concede to you the honour which you solicit.\"    The young man then advanced, and in a short time discovered the bandits,  who were about twenty in number, and who were lying under trees, to the  trunks of which their horses were fastened. Martin could scarcely  forbear from shuddering and feeling a sense of repugnance, when he saw  the ferocity which was stamped on their visages, and when he heard the  filthy language they were using. On perceiving him, one of them arose,  who was distinguished from the others by his garb and by the large scars  which were on his hands and face. Martin began to make known to him the  object which led him thither, but the captain of the bandits, for it was  no other, interrupted him, saying--    \"Brother, do you think we are deaf? We have heard you and we now know  for what you come. Tell me, however, what is it that entitles you to be  admitted into the band of the Raposo,[1] for by that name the son of my  mother is known?\"    [1] A fox.    \"Anger of God, Don Raposo, if it were any other but you who asked me  that question, you should soon pay a visit to your friend Se[~n]or Lucifer.  Do you not see, confound you, the blood which I have on my hands and  garments, and the wounds on my face. This blood does not come from  slaughtering cattle, nor those scratches from a jealous sweetheart. Go  to the place I shall mention to you, and you will find the body of the  cavalier whose life I have taken, in order to provide myself with these  arms and this steed, and when you are coming back fetch me the dagger  which I forgot to draw from his breast.\"    \"You don't waste much respect on him who is to be your captain,\" said  the Raposo; \"but I desire to be indulgent towards you as a reward for  the good work you have done. I believe what you say, for you could not  have become possessed in any other way of these arms and that splendid  horse, for your dress and your manner shows me that you are just as much  a cavalier as I am a bishop. However, if you wish to become a member of  our honourable brotherhood, you must take the usual oath.\"    \"I will take a hundred of them if you like,\" answered Martin,  dismounting.    The captain of the bandits walked over to a tree, at the foot of which  were heaped up a great number of sacred vessels and ornaments, which  they had stolen that night from a neighbouring church, and taking up a  crucifix of considerable value he held it up before the youth, and  said--    \"Will you swear fidelity to your brethren? Will you swear to carry off  women, to enter and plunder houses and churches, palaces and huts? Will  you swear to rob and kill priests the same as laymen, poor the same as  rich, women the same as men, children the same as grown-up people?\"    \"Yes, I swear!\" replied Martin, firmly resolved, however, not to keep so  sacrilegious an oath, for he did not consider himself bound to do so,  taking it only with his lips and not from his soul.    \"Salute our new brother!\" said the Raposo, turning towards his  companions. They went up to him and embraced him one after the other.    \"Brother,\" continued the captain, \"when this ceremony was ended, you now  must know that he who is honoured by being received into our band, is  obliged to celebrate his admission by giving a skin of good wine to all  the members of the confraternity. I suppose that the late owner of your  arms and"]]]
