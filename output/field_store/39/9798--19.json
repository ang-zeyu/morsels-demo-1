Emory abandoned the pursuit as not feasible, and bivouacked on the route.  Cavalry rencounters of the day were reported, in which both sides claimed  success. Stuart reported Lieutenant-Colonel Wickham and four men wounded.  Of the other side, Cooke reported thirty-five killed, wounded, and  missing. Gibson reported one officer and four men wounded, and one gun  abandoned. Emory reported two killed and four wounded, and Sanders one  officer wounded. But most of the Federal losses were in the encounters at  the redoubts with the artillery and infantry.    The enemy's cavalry reported the redoubt on the Confederate left  unoccupied, and Hancock's brigade (Smith's division) was ordered forward  to take it, but the woods through which he marched were tangled and  swampy, and delayed him until night brought him to bivouac. Meanwhile, the  Confederates who drove the cavalry from its reconnoissance had occupied  the redoubt.    The corps commanders Sumner, Heintzelman, and Keyes and the cavalry leader  Stoneman were together that night in conference. The highways, over flats  but little above tide-water, were saturated by the spring rains, cut into  deep ruts by the haul of heavy trains, and puddled by the tramp of  infantry and cavalry. The wood and fallow lands were bogs, with occasional  quicksands, adding severest labor to the usual toils of battle. So no  plans were formed, further than to feel the way forward when there was  light to see.    The enemy got some of our men who were worn out by the fatigue of the  siege and the heavy march of the night and day.          CHAPTER VI.    THE BATTLE OF WILLIAMSBURG.        The Attack on Fort Magruder--Hancock occupies two Redoubts--The      Slaughter in Early's Brigade--The Fifth North Carolina Regiment and      Twenty-Fourth Virginia mercilessly exposed--A Hard-Fought      Engagement--A Confederate Victory--McClellan not on the Field the      Greater Part of the Day--Hancock called \"The Superb\" by      McClellan--Johnston pays High Tribute to Longstreet.      Before quitting his trenches at Yorktown, Johnston anticipated a move of  part of McClellan's army by transports to the head of York River, to cut  his line of march towards Richmond, and conceived it important to have a  strong force at that point in time to meet and check the move. To that end  he ordered Magruder to march at two A.M. on the 5th of May with D. R.  Jones's and McLaws's divisions, to be followed by the divisions of G. W.  Smith and D. H. Hill; Longstreet's division to cover the movement of his  trains and defend Stuart's cavalry in case of severe pressure. Late in the  afternoon of the 4th I was ordered to send a brigade to the redoubts to  relieve McLaws's division. The brigades being small, I sent two, R. H.  Anderson's and Pryor's, with Macon's battery, under Lieutenant Clopton,  two guns under Captain Garrett, and two under Captain McCarthy, to report  to General Anderson, the senior brigadier. At the time it was thought that  the army would be on the march by daylight in the morning, and that the  rear-guard would closely follow; but after nightfall a down-pour of rain  came, flooding thoroughfares and by-ways, woodlands and fields, so that  parts of our trains were stalled on the ground, where they stood during  the night. It was dark when Anderson joined McLaws, who had drawn his men  together in readiness to join the advance march. Anticipating an early  march himself, Anderson occupied Fort Magruder and advanced his pickets so  as to cover with their fire the junction of the Yorktown and Hampton  roads. Heavy clouds and darkness settling down upon him, he made no effort  at a critical survey of the surroundings; while the steady rain through  the night gave signs of serious delay in the movements of the army, but he  little thought that by the delay he could be called into battle. In the  morning when time grew heavier he was advised to call in the brigades near  him, in case he should need them, and instructions were sent them to  answer his call.    At daylight he occupied the redoubts on the right of Fort Magruder, and  two of those on the left. Two others farther on the left were not seen  through the rain, and no one had been left to tell him of them or of the  grounds. The field in his front and far off on his right was open. That in  the immediate front had been opened by felling trees. On his left were  woodland and the swampy creek. General Hooker's division of the Third  Corps came to the open on the Hampton road at seven A.M. of the 5th, and  engaged by regiments,--the First Massachusetts on his left, preceded by a  battalion of skirmishers; the Second New Hampshire on the right, in the  same order; Hancock's brigade of W. F. Smith's division of the Fourth  Corps threatening on the Yorktown road; supported by part of Davidson's  brigade and artillery. After the advance of his infantry in the slashes,  General Hooker, with the Eleventh Massachusetts and Thirty-sixth  Pennsylvania Regiments of Grover's brigade, cleared the way for  communication with the troops on the Yorktown road, and ordered Webber's  six-gun battery into action towards the front of the fallen timber. As it  burst from the wood our infantry and every gun in reach opened upon it a  fire so destructive that it was unmanned before it came into practice.  Volunteers to man the battery were called, and with the assistance of men  of Osborn's battery the guns were opened. Bramhall's battery was advanced  and put into action on the right of Webber's, when the two poured an  unceasing fire against our troops about the fort and redoubts. It was not  very destructive, however, and they thought to reserve their ammunition.    The Fifth New Jersey Regiment, of Patterson's brigade, was added to the  guard of the batteries, and the Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth were deployed  on the left in the woodland. Anderson called up Wilcox's brigade, and  ordered it to his right, reinforced it by the men of Pryor's brigade not  needed at the forts, and presently called for the brigades of A. P. Hill  and Pickett, to further support his right.    From the swelling noise of battle I concluded that it would be well to  ride to the front, and ordered the remaining brigade (Colston's) and the  batteries of Dearing and Stribling to follow. Stuart sent his horse  artillery under Pelham into the action on the open field.    Viewing the ground on the left, I thought it not so well protected as  Anderson conceived, and sent to D. H. Hill, who was but little advanced on  his march, for one of his brigades. Early's was sent, to whose brigade  were temporarily attached the Florida regiment and a Mississippi  battalion. Anderson had left the fort, and was busy handling the brigades  engaged in the woods on the right. Colston's was put in with the other  brigades under Anderson, who afterwards called for another regiment. The  Florida regiment and the Mississippi battalion were sent. Early, with his  brigade, was posted on the field in rear of our left.    When it became evident that the fight was for the day, D. H. Hill was  asked to return with the balance of his division. Meanwhile, Hooker was  bracing the fight on his left. Emory reported to him with his cavalry and  light battery, but as his fight was in the wood, Emory was asked to  reconnoitre on his extreme left. The fight growing in the wood, Grover  drew off part of his brigade to reinforce against it. The Seventy-second  and Seventeenth New York Regiments of Taylor's brigade were also sent;  then the Seventy-third and Seventy-fourth New York Regiments of the same  brigade; but the Confederates gained ground gradually. They were, however,  getting short of ammunition. While holding their line, some of the  regiments were permitted to retire a little to fill their cartridge-boxes  from those of the fallen of the enemy and of their comrades. This move was  misconstrued into an order to withdraw, and the line fell back a little.  But the mistake was rectified, and the ground that had been abandoned was  recovered.    Hooker ordered the Eleventh Massachusetts and Twenty-sixth Pennsylvania  Regiments to the support of the batteries, and the Second New Hampshire  Regiment to his left. Anderson, drawing his troops together near the  batteries, made a concentrated move upon them, and cleared them of the  gunners, securing four of Webber's guns and forty horses. Just then he was  reinforced by Colston's brigade, the Florida regiment, and the Mississippi  battalion. General Stuart taking it that the enemy was badly broken and in  retreat, rode up with his cavalry, insisting upon a charge and pursuit. As  he did not recognize authority except of the commander-in-chief, he was  only cautioned that the break was only of the enemy's front, that he would  find reinforcements coming up, and this he began to realize by the clearer  ring of their muskets. He speedily encountered them, but in time to get  away before meeting serious trouble. About three o'clock Kearny's division  arrived, and only a few minutes later D. H. Hill's, of the Confederates.  On the approach of Kearny's leading brigades, one regiment was detached  from Berry's to reinforce Emory's Cavalry detachment on their left. The  other regiments were deployed, the Fifth Michigan on the left of the  road, the Thirty-seventh New York on its left, along the road, one company  of the New York regiment from left to rear. Six companies of the Michigan  regiment were broken off to the rear of its right as reserve, leaving its  forward battalion partly across the road, while that in rear had two  companies on the right and two on the left of the road. Two regiments of  Birney's brigade were deployed, the Thirty-eighth on the right of, and the  Fortieth across, the road, to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38440"],[0,"A Distributional Study of the Amphibians of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, México (#16)"],[1,"               James W.
