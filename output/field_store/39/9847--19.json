I well remember the  first overland mail.  It was brought by Kit Carson in saddle-bags  from Taos in New Mexico.  We heard of his arrival at Los Angeles,  and waited patiently for his arrival at headquarters.  His fame  then was at its height, from the publication of Fremont's books,  and I was very anxious to see a man who had achieved such feats of  daring among the wild animals of the Rocky Mountains, and still  wilder Indians of the Plains.  At last his arrival was reported at  the tavern at Monterey, and I hurried to hunt him up.  I cannot  express my surprise at beholding a small, stoop-shouldered man,  with reddish hair, freckled face, soft blue eyes, and nothing to  indicate extraordinary courage or daring.  He spoke but little, and  answered questions in monosyllables.  I asked for his mail, and he  picked up his light saddle-bags containing the great overland mail,  and we walked together to headquarters, where he delivered his  parcel into Colonel Mason's own hands.  He spent some days in  Monterey, during which time we extracted with difficulty some items  of his personal history.  He was then by commission a lieutenant in  the regiment of Mounted Rifles serving in Mexico under Colonel  Sumner, and, as he could not reach his regiment from California,  Colonel Mason ordered that for a time he should be assigned to duty  with A. J. Smith's company, First Dragoons, at Los Angeles.  He  remained at Los Angeles some months, and was then sent back to the  United Staten with dispatches, traveling two thousand miles almost  alone, in preference to being encumbered by a large party.    Toward the close of June, 1848, the gold-fever being at its height,  by Colonel Mason's orders I made preparations for his trip to the  newly-discovered gold-mines at Sutter's Fort.  I selected four good  soldiers, with Aaron, Colonel Mason's black servant, and a good  outfit of horses and pack-mules, we started by the usually traveled  route for Yerba Buena.  There Captain Fulsom and two citizens  joined our party.  The first difficulty was to cross the bay to  Saucelito.  Folsom, as quartermaster, had a sort of scow with a  large sail, with which to discharge the cargoes of ships, that  could not come within a mile of the shore.  It took nearly the  whole day to get the old scow up to the only wharf there, and then  the water was so shallow that the scow, with its load of horses,  would not float at the first high tide, but by infinite labor on  the next tide she was got off and safely crossed over to Saucelito.  We followed in a more comfortable schooner.  Having safely landed  our horses and mules, we picked up and rode to San Rafael Mission,  stopping with Don Timoteo Murphy.  The next day's journey took us  to Bodega, where lived a man named Stephen Smith, who had the only  steam saw-mill in California.  He had a Peruvian wife, and employed  a number of absolutely naked Indians in making adobes.  We spent a  day very pleasantly with him, and learned that he had come to  California some years before, at the personal advice of Daniel  Webster, who had informed him that sooner or later the United  States would be in possession of California, and that in  consequence it would become a great country.  From Bodega we  traveled to Sonoma, by way of Petaluma, and spent a day with  General Vallejo.  I had been there before, as related, in the  business of the alcalde Nash.  From Sonoma we crossed over by way  of Napa, Suisun, and Vaca's ranch, to the Puta.  In the rainy  season, the plain between the Puta and Sacramento Rivers is  impassable, but in July the waters dry up; and we passed without  trouble, by the trail for Sutter's Embarcadero.  We reached the  Sacramento River, then full of water, with a deep, clear current.  The only means of crossing over was by an Indian dugout canoe.  We  began by carrying across our packs and saddles, and then our  people.  When all things were ready, the horses were driven into  the water, one being guided ahead by a man in the canoe.  Of  course, the horses and mules at first refused to take to the water,  and it was nearly a day's work to get them across, and even then  some of our animals after crossing escaped into the woods and  undergrowth that lined the river, but we secured enough of them to  reach Sutter's Fort, three miles back from the embcarcadero, where  we encamped at the old slough, or pond, near the fort.  On  application, Captain Butter sent some Indians back into the bushes,  who recovered and brought in all our animals.  At that time there  was not the sign of a habitation there or thereabouts, except the  fort, and an old adobe-house, east of the fort, known as the  hospital.  The fort itself was one of adobe-walls, about twenty  feet high, rectangular in form, with two-story block houses at  diagonal corners.  The entrance was by a large gate, open by day  and closed at night, with two iron ship's guns near at hand.  Inside there was a large house, with a good shingle-roof, used as a  storehouse, and all round the  walls were ranged rooms, the fort  wall being the outer wall of the house.  The inner wall also was of  adobe.  These rooms were used by Captain Sutter himself and by his  people.  He had a blacksmith's shop, carpenter's shop, etc., and  other rooms where the women made blankets.  Sutter was monarch of  all he surveyed, and had authority to inflict punishment even unto  death, a power he did not fail to use.  He had horses, cattle, and  sheep, and of these he gave liberally and without price to all in  need.  He caused to be driven into our camp a beef and some sheep,  which were slaughtered for our use.  Already the goldmines were  beginning to be felt.  Many people were then encamped, some going  and some coming, all full of gold-stories, and each surpassing the  other.  We found preparations in progress for celebrating the  Fourth of July, then close at hand, and we agreed to remain over to  assist on the occasion; of course, being the high officials, we  were the honored guests.  People came from a great distance to  attend this celebration of the Fourth of July, and the tables were  laid in the large room inside the storehouse of the fort.  A man of  some note, named Sinclair, presided, and after a substantial meal  and a reasonable supply of aguardiente we began the toasts.  All  that I remember is that Folsom and I spoke for our party; others,  Captain Sutter included, made speeches, and before the celebration  was over Sutter was enthusiastic, and many others showed the  effects of the aguardiente.  The next day (namely, July 5, 1848) we  resumed our journey toward the mines, and, in twenty-five miles of  as hot and dusty a ride as possible, we reached Mormon Island.  I  have heretofore stated that the gold was first found in the  tail-race of the stew-mill at Coloma, forty miles above Sutter's  Fort, or fifteen above Mormon Island, in the bed of the American  Fork of the Sacramento River.  It seems that Sutter had employed an  American named Marshall, a sort of millwright, to do this work for  him, but Marshall afterward claimed that in the matter of the  saw-mill they were copartners.  At all events, Marshall and the  family of Mr. Wimmer were living at Coloma, where the pine-trees  afforded the best material for lumber.  He had under him four white  men, Mormons, who had been discharged from Cooke's battalion, and  some Indians.  These were engaged in hewing logs, building a  mill-dam, and putting up a saw-mill.  Marshall, as the architect,  had made the \"tub-wheel,\" and had set it in motion, and had also  furnished some of the rude parts of machinery necessary for an  ordinary up-and-down saw-mill.    Labor was very scarce, expensive, and had to be economized.  The  mill was built over a dry channel of the river which was calculated  to be the tail-race.  After arranging his head-race, dam and  tub-wheel, he let on the water to test the goodness of his  machinery.  It worked very well until it was found that the  tail-race did not carry off the water fast enough, so he put his  men to work in a rude way to clear out the tail-race.  They  scratched a kind of ditch down the middle of the dry channel,  throwing the coarser stones to one side; then, letting on the water  again, it would run with velocity down the channel, washing away  the dirt, thus saving labor.  This course of action was repeated  several times, acting exactly like the long Tom afterward resorted  to by the miners.  As Marshall himself was working in this ditch,  he observed particles of yellow metal which he gathered up in his  hand, when it seemed to have suddenly flashed across his mind that  it was gold.  After picking up about an ounce, he hurried down to  the fort to report to Captain Sutter his discovery.  Captain Sutter  himself related to me Marshall's account, saying that, as he sat in  his room at the fort one day in February or March, 1848, a knock  was heard at his door, and he called out, \"Come in.\"   In walked  Marshall, who was a half-crazy man at best, but then looked  strangely wild.  \"What is the matter, Marshall!\"  Marshall  inquired if any one was within hearing, and began to peer about the  room, and look under the bed, when Sutter, fearing that some  calamity had befallen the party up at the saw-mill, and that  Marshall was really crazy, began to make his way to the door,  demanding of Marshall to explain what was the matter.  At last he  revealed his discovery, and laid before Captain Sutter the  pellicles of gold he had picked up in the ditch.  At first, Sutter  attached little or no importance to the discovery, and told  Marshall to go back to the mill, and say nothing of what he had  seen to Mr. Wimmer, or any one else.  Yet, as it might add value to  the location, he dispatched to our headquarters at Monterey, as I  have already related, the two men with a written application"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4362"],[0,"Personal Memoirs of P. H. Sheridan, General, United States Army — Complete (#16)"],[1,"place were greatly exaggerated by the  Eastern papers, and lost nothing in transition.  The news came by the  pony express across the Plains to San Francisco, where it was still  further magnified in republishing, and gained somewhat in Southern  bias.  I remember well that when the first reports reached us of, the  battle of Bull Run--that sanguinary engagement--it was stated that  each side had lost forty thousand men in killed and wounded, and none  were reported missing nor as having run away.  Week by week these  losses grew less, until they finally shrunk into the hundreds, but  the vivid descriptions of the gory conflict were not toned down  during the whole summer.    We received our mail at Yamhill only once a week, and then had to  bring it from Portland, Oregon, by express.  On the day of the week  that our courier, or messenger, was expected back from Portland, I  would go out early in the morning to a commanding point above the  post, from which I could see a long distance down the road as it ran  through the valley of the Yamhill, and there I would watch with  anxiety for his coming, longing for good news; for, isolated as I had  been through years spent in the wilderness, my patriotism was  untainted by politics, nor had it been disturbed by any discussion of  the questions out of which the war grew, and I hoped for the success  of the Government above all other considerations.  I believe I was  also uninfluenced by any thoughts of the promotion that might result  to me from the conflict, but, out of a sincere desire to contribute  as much as I could to the preservation of the Union, I earnestly  wished to be at the seat of war, and feared it might end before I  could get East.  In no sense did I anticipate what was to happen to  me afterward, nor that I was to gain any distinction from it.  I was  ready to do my duty to the best of my ability wherever I might be  called, and I was young, healthy, insensible to fatigue, and desired  opportunity, but high rank was so distant in our service that not a  dream of its attainment had flitted through my brain.    During the period running from January to September, 1861, in  consequence of resignations and the addition of some new regiments to  the regular army, I had passed through the grade of first lieutenant  and reached that of captain in the Thirteenth United States Infantry,  of which General W. T. Sherman had recently been made the colonel.  When relieved from further duty at Yamhill by Captain Owen, I left  for the Atlantic coast to join my new regiment.  A two days' ride  brought me down to Portland, whence I sailed to San Franciso, and at  that city took passage by steamer for New York via the Isthmus of  Panama, in company with a number of officers who were coming East  under circumstances like my own.    At this time California was much agitated--on the question of  secession, and the secession element was so strong that considerable  apprehension was felt by the Union people lest the State might be  carried into the Confederacy.  As a consequence great distrust  existed in all quarters, and the loyal passengers on the steamer, not  knowing what might occur during our voyage, prepared to meet  emergencies by thoroughly organizing to frustrate any attempt that  might possibly be made to carry us into some Southern port after we  should leave Aspinwall.  However, our fears proved groundless; at all  events, no such attempt was made, and we reached New York in safety  in November, 1861.  A day or two in New York sufficed to replenish a  most meagre wardrobe, and I then started West to join my new  regiment, stopping a day and a night at the home of my parents in  Ohio, where I had not been since I journeyed from Texas for the  Pacific coast.  The headquarters of my regiment were at Jefferson  Barracks, Missouri, to which point I proceeded with no further delay  except a stay in the city of St. Louis long enough to pay my respects  to General H. W. Halleck.          CHAPTER VIII.    AUDITING ACCOUNTS--CHIEF QUARTERMASTER AND COMMISSARY OF THE ARMY OF  SOUTHWEST MISSOURI--PREPARING FOR THE PEA RIDGE CAMPAIGN--A  DIFFERENCE WITH GENERAL CURTIS--ORDERED TO THE FRONT--APPOINTED A  COLONEL.    Some days after I had reached the headquarters of my regiment near  St. Louis, General Halleck sent for me, and when I reported he  informed me that there existed a great deal of confusion regarding  the accounts of some of the disbursing officers in his department,  whose management of its fiscal affairs under his predecessor, General  John C. Fremont, had been very loose; and as the chaotic condition of  things could be relieved only by auditing these accounts, he  therefore had determined to create a board of officers for the  purpose, and intended to make me president of it.  The various  transactions in question covered a wide field, for the department  embraced the States of Missouri, Iowa, Minnesota, Illinois, Arkansas,  and all of Kentucky west of the Cumberland River.    The duty was not distasteful, and I felt that I was qualified to  undertake it, for the accounts to be audited belonged exclusively to  the Quartermaster and Subsistence departments, and by recent  experience I had become familiar with the class of papers that  pertained to those branches of the army.  Indeed, it was my  familiarity with such transactions, returns, etc., that probably  caused my selection as president of the board.    I entered upon the work forthwith, and continued at it until the 26th  of December, 1861.  At that date I was relieved from the auditing  board and assigned to duty as Chief Commissary of the Army of  Southwest Missouri, commanded by General Samuel R. Curtis.  This army  was then organizing at Rolla, Missouri, for the Pea Ridge campaign,  its strength throughout the campaign being in the aggregate about  fifteen thousand men.    As soon as I received information of my selection for this position,  I went to General Halleck and requested him to assign me as Chief  Quartermaster also.  He was reluctant to do so, saying that I could  not perform both duties, but I soon convinced him that I could do  both better than the one, for I reminded him that as Chief  Quartermaster I should control the transportation, and thus obviate  all possible chances of discord between the two staff departments; a  condition which I deemed essential to success, especially as it was  intended that Curtis's army should mainly subsist on the country.  This argument impressed Halleck, and becoming convinced, he promptly  issued the order making me Chief Quartermaster and Chief Commissary  of Subsistence of the Army of Southwest Missouri, and I started for  Rolla to enter upon the work assigned me.    Having reported to General Curtis, I quickly learned that his system  of supply was very defective, and the transportation without proper  organization, some of the regiments having forty to fifty wagon each,  and others only three or four.  I labored day and night to remedy  these and other defects, and with the help of Captain Michael P.  Small, of the Subsistence Department, who was an invaluable  assistant, soon brought things into shape, putting the transportation  in good working order, giving each regiment its proper quota of  wagons, and turning the surplus into the general supply trains of the  army.  In accomplishing this I was several times on the verge of  personal conflict with irate regimental commanders, but Colonel G. M.  Dodge so greatly sustained me with General Curtis by strong moral  support, and by such efficient details from his regiment--the Fourth  Iowa Volunteer Infantry--that I still bear him and it great affection  and lasting gratitude.    On January 26, 1862, General Curtis's army began its march from Rolla  to Springfield, Missouri, by way of Lebanon.  The roads were deep  with mud, and so badly cut up that the supply trains in moving  labored under the most serious difficulties, and were greatly  embarrassed by swollen streams.  Under these circumstances many  delays occurred, and when we arrived at Lebanon nearly all the  supplies with which we had started had been consumed, and the work of  feeding the troops off the country had to begin at that point.  To  get flour, wheat had to be taken from the stacks, threshed, and sent  to the mills to be ground.  Wheat being scarce in this region, corn  as a substitute had to be converted into meal by the same laborious  process.  In addition, beef cattle had to be secured for the meat  ration.    By hard work we soon accumulated a sufficient quantity of flour and  corn meal to justify the resumption of our march on Springfield; at  or near which point the enemy was believed to be awaiting us, and the  order was given to move forward, the commanding general cautioning  me, in the event of disaster, to let no salt fall into General  Price's hands.  General Curtis made a hobby of this matter of salt,  believing the enemy was sadly in need of that article, and he  impressed me deeply with his conviction that our cause would be  seriously injured by a loss which would inure so greatly and  peculiarly to the enemy's benefit; but we afterward discovered, when  Price abandoned his position, that about all he left behind was salt.    When we were within about eight miles of Springfield, General Curtis  decided to put his troops in line of battle for the advance on the  town, and directed me to stretch out my supply trains in a long line  of battle, so that in falling back, in case the troops were repulsed,  he could rally the men on the wagons.  I did not like the tactics,  but of course obeyed the order.  The line moved on Springfield, and  took the town without resistance, the enemy having fled southward, in  the direction of Pea Ridge, the preceding day.  Of course our success  relieved my anxiety about the wagons; but fancy has often pictured  since, the stampede of six mule teams that, had we met with any"]]]
