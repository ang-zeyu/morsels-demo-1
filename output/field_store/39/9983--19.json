XVI    JEAN LEON GEROME        (Pronounced Zhahn Lay'on Zhay-rome)    _French, Semi-classical School_    1824-1904    _Pupil of Delaroche_    One cannot write much more than the date of birth and death of a man  who lived until three or four years of the time of writing, so we may  only say that Gerome was one of the most brilliant of modern French  painters. He was born at Vesoul and his father was a goldsmith. Thus  he probably had no very great difficulty in getting a start in his  work. The prejudice against having an artist in the family was dying  out, and as a prosperous goldsmith we may believe that his father had  means enough to give his son good opportunities.    Gerome, like Millet, studied under Delaroche, but became no such  characteristic painter as he. While studying with Delaroche he also  was taking the course in l'Ecole des Beaux-Arts.    His first exhibited picture was \"The Cock Fight,\" and he won a third  class medal by it.    Almost always this painter has chosen his subjects from ancient or  classic life, and his pictures are not always decent, but he painted  with much care, the details of his work are very finely done and their  vivid colour is fascinating.      PLATE--THE SWORD DANCE    This painting may be seen in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New  York City. The scene is full of action and interest, but perhaps the  details of dress, mosaic decoration upon the walls, patterns of the  rugs, the coloured and jewelled lamps and windows are the most  splendidly painted of all.    The central figure is a dancing girl, only partly draped, balancing a  sword on her head, while a brilliant green veil flies from head and  face. Other Oriental women squat upon the floor watching her with a  half indolent expression, while their Oriental masters and their  friends sit in pomp at one side, absorbed in the dance and in the  girl. The expressions upon all the faces are excellent and, the  jewelled light that falls upon the group, the rich clothing, the grace  of the dancer--all make a fascinating picture of a genre type. Other  Geromes are \"Daphnis and Chloe,\" \"Leda,\" and \"The Duel after the  Masked Ball.\"          XVII    GHIRLANDAJO        (Pronounced Geer-lan-da'yo)    _Florentine School_    1449-1494    _Pupil of Fra Bartolommeo_    It is a good deal of a name--Domenico di Tommaso di Currado  Bigordi--and it would appear that the child who bore it was under  obligation to become a good deal of a something before he died.    Italian and Spanish painters generally had large names to live up to,  and the one known as Ghirlandajo did nobly.    His father was a goldsmith and a popular part of his work was the  making of golden garlands for the hair of rich Italian ladies. His  work was so beautiful that it gained for him the name of Ghirlandajo,  meaning the garland-twiner, a name that lived after him, in the great  art of his son. Domenico began as a worker in mosaic, a maker of  pictures or designs with many coloured pieces of glass or stone.    Ghirlandajo's art was no improvement on that of his teacher, but he in  turn became the teacher of Michael Angelo.    The Florentine school of painting, to which Ghirlandajo belonged, was  not so famous for colour as the Venetian school, but it had many other  elements to commend it. One cannot expect Ghirlandajo to rank with  Titian, Rubens, or other \"colourists\" of his own and later periods,  but he did the very best work of his day and school. He attained to  fame through his choice of types of faces for his models, and by his  excellent grouping of figures.    Until his day, the faces introduced into paintings were likely to be  unattractive, but he chose pleasing ones, and he painted the folds of  garments beautifully. He was not entirely original in his ideas, but  he carried out those which others had thus far failed to make  interesting.    Often, in his wish to paint exactly what he saw, he softened nothing  and therefore his figures were repulsive, but Fra Bartolommeo's pupil  gave promise of what Michael Angelo was to fulfill.    Ghirlandajo and Michael Angelo were a good deal alike in their  emotional natures. Both sought great spaces in which to paint, and  both chose to paint great frescoes. Indeed Ghirlandajo had the  extraordinary ambition to put frescoes on all the fortification walls  about Florence. It certainly would have made the city a great picture  gallery to have had its walls forever hung with the pictures of one  master. Had he painted them, inside and out, when such an enemy as  Napoleon came along, with his love of art, and his fashion of taking  all that he saw to Paris, he would likely enough have camped outside  the walls while he decided what part of the gallery he would transfer  to the Louvre.    One of the reasons that Ghirlandajo is famous is that he often chose  well known personages for his models, and as he painted just what he  saw, did not idealise his subject, he gave to the world amazing  portraits, as well as fine paintings. The same thing was done by  painters of a far different school, at another period. The Dutch and  Flemish painters were in the habit of using their neighbours as  models.    Ghirlandajo is classed among religious painters, but let us compare  some of his \"religious\" paintings with those of Raphael or Murillo,  and see the result.    He painted seven frescos on the walls of the Santa Maria Novella in  Florence, all scenes of Biblical history, as Ghirlandajo imagined  them. They show him to have been a fine artist, but to have had not  much idea of history, and to have had little sense of fitness.    Ghirlandajo's seven subjects are taken from legends of the Virgin, and  the greatest represents Mary's visit to Elizabeth; it is called \"The  Visitation,\" and it is a fresco about eighteen feet long painted on  the choir wall.    Let us imagine the possible scene. The Virgin Mary came from Cana, a  little town in Galilee placed in the hills about nine miles from  Nazareth, the home of the lowliest and the poorest, of a kindly  pastoral people living in the open air, needing and wanting very  little, simple in their habits. Elizabeth, Mary's old cousin, lived in  Judea, and St. Luke writes thus: \"Mary arose in those days and went  into the hill country with haste, into a city of Judea; and entered  into the house of Zacharias\" (Elizabeth's husband) \"and saluted  Elizabeth.\"    This record had been made at least eleven hundred years before  Ghirlandajo painted in the Santa Maria Novella, and from it one cannot  imagine that Mary made any preparation for her journey, nor does it  suggest that Elizabeth had any chance to arrange a reception for  her. Even had she done so, it must have been of the simplest  description, at that time among those people. One can imagine a lowly  home; an aged woman coming out to meet her young relative either at  her door or in the high road.    There may have been surroundings of fruit and flowers, a stretch of  highroad or a hospitable doorway; but the wildest imagination could  not picture what Ghirlandajo did.    He paints Elizabeth flanked with handmaidens, as if she were some  royal personage, instead of a priest's wife in fairly comfortable  circumstances where comfort was easily obtained. Mary appears to be  escorted by ladies-in-waiting, hardly a likely circumstance since she  was affianced to no richer or more important person than a carpenter  of Galilee. Possibly the three ladies that stand behind Mary in, the  picture are merely lookers-on, but in that case the visit of Mary  would seem to have been of public importance, especially as there are  youths near by who are also much interested in one woman's hasty visit  to another. The rich brocades worn by Elizabeth's waiting ladies are  splendid indeed and the landscape is fine--a rich Italian landscape  with architecture of the most up-to-date sort--showing, in short, that  the artist lacked historical imagination. He found some models, made a  purely decorative painting with an Italian setting and called it \"The  Visitation.\" The doorway on the right is distinctly renaissance.    Such a painting as this is not \"religious,\" nor is it historic, nor  does it suggest a subject; it is merely a fine picture better coloured  than most of those of the Florentine school. There is another painting  of this same subject by Ghirlandajo in the Louvre, but it is no nearer  truth than the one in the Santa Maria.    Ghirlandajo painted other than religious subjects, and one of them, at  least, is quite repulsive. It is the picture of an old man, with a  beautiful little child embracing him. The old man may have tenderness  and love in his face, but his heavy features, his warty nose, do not  make one think of pleasant things and one does not care to imagine the  dear little child kissing the grotesque old fellow.    It was before Ghirlandajo's time that another painter had discovered  the use of oil in mixing paints. Previously colours had been mixed in  water with some gelatinous substance, such as the white and yolk of an  egg, to give the paint a proper texture or consistency. This  preparation was called \"distemper,\" and frescoes were made by using  this upon plaster while it was still wet. Plaster and colours dried  together, and the painting became a part of the wall, not to be  removed except by taking the plaster with it.    The different gluey substances used had often the effect of making the  colours lose their tone and they presented a glazed surface when used  upon wood, a favourite material with artists.    There are numberless anecdotes written of this artist and his brother,  and one of these shows he had a temper. The brothers were engaged in a  monastery at Passignano painting a picture of the \"Last Supper.\" While  at work upon it, they lived in the house. The coarse fare did not suit  Ghirlandajo, and one night he could endure it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6933"],[0,"France and England in North America, Part II: The Jesuits in North America in (#16)"],[1,"it.    Believing that the whole material world was instinct with powers to  influence and control his fate, that good and evil spirits, and  existences nameless and indefinable, filled all Nature, that a pervading  sorcery was above, below, and around him, and that issues of life and  death might be controlled by instruments the most unnoticeable and  seemingly the most feeble, the Indian lived in perpetual fear. The  turning of a leaf, the crawling of an insect, the cry of a bird, the  creaking of a bough, might be to him the mystic signal of weal or woe.    An Indian community swarmed with sorcerers, medicine-men, and diviners,  whose functions were often united in the same person. The sorcerer, by  charms, magic songs, magic feasts, and the beating of his drum, had  power over the spirits and those occult influences inherent in animals  and inanimate things. He could call to him the souls of his enemies.  They appeared before him in the form of stones. He chopped and bruised  them with his hatchet; blood and flesh issued forth; and the intended  victim, however distant, languished and died. Like the sorcerer of the  Middle Ages, he made images of those he wished to destroy, and,  muttering incantations, punctured them with an awl, whereupon the  persons represented sickened and pined away.    The Indian doctor relied far more on magic than on natural remedies.  Dreams, beating of the drum, songs, magic feasts and dances, and howling  to frighten the female demon from his patient, were his ordinary methods  of cure.    The prophet, or diviner, had various means of reading the secrets of  futurity, such as the flight of birds, and the movements of water and  fire. There was a peculiar practice of divination very general in the  Algonquin family of tribes, among some of whom it still subsists. A  small, conical lodge was made by planting poles in a circle, lashing the  tops together at the height of about seven feet from the ground, and  closely covering them with hides. The prophet crawled in, and closed the  aperture after him. He then beat his drum and sang his magic songs to  summon the spirits, whose weak, shrill voices were soon heard, mingled  with his lugubrious chanting, while at intervals the juggler paused to  interpret their communications to the attentive crowd seated on the  ground without. During the whole scene, the lodge swayed to and fro with  a violence which has astonished many a civilized beholder, and which  some of the Jesuits explain by the ready solution of a genuine diabolic  intervention. [87]    [87] This practice was first observed by Champlain. (See \"Pioneers of  France in the New World.\" ) From his time to the present, numerous  writers have remarked upon it. Le Jeune, in the Relation of 1637, treats  it at some length. The lodge was sometimes of a cylindrical, instead of  a conical form.    The sorcerers, medicine-men, and diviners did not usually exercise the  function of priests. Each man sacrificed for himself to the powers he  wished to propitiate, whether his guardian spirit, the spirits of  animals, or the other beings of his belief. The most common offering was  tobacco, thrown into the fire or water; scraps of meat were sometimes  burned to the manitous; and, on a few rare occasions of public  solemnity, a white dog, the mystic animal of many tribes, was tied to  the end of an upright pole, as a sacrifice to some superior spirit, or  to the sun, with which the superior spirits were constantly confounded  by the primitive Indian. In recent times, when Judaism and Christianity  have modified his religious ideas, it has been, and still is, the  practice to sacrifice dogs to the Great Spirit. On these public  occasions, the sacrificial function is discharged by chiefs, or by  warriors appointed for the purpose. [88]    [88] Many of the Indian feasts were feasts of sacrifice,--sometimes to  the guardian spirit of the host, sometimes to an animal of which he has  dreamed, sometimes to a local or other spirit. The food was first  offered in a loud voice to the being to be propitiated, after which the  guests proceeded to devour it for him. This unique method of sacrifice  was practised at war-feasts and similar solemnities. For an excellent  account of Indian religious feasts, see Perrot, Chap. V.    One of the most remarkable of Indian sacrifices was that practised by  the Hurons in the case of a person drowned or frozen to death. The flesh  of the deceased was cut off, and thrown into a fire made for the  purpose, as an offering of propitiation to the spirits of the air or  water. What remained of the body was then buried near the  fire.--BrÃ©beuf, Relation des Hurons, 1636, 108.    The tribes of Virginia, as described by Beverly and others, not only had  priests who offered sacrifice, but idols and houses of worship.    Among the Hurons and Iroquois, and indeed all the stationary tribes,  there was an incredible number of mystic ceremonies, extravagant,  puerile, and often disgusting, designed for the cure of the sick or for  the general weal of the community. Most of their observances seem  originally to have been dictated by dreams, and transmitted as a sacred  heritage from generation to generation. They consisted in an endless  variety of dances, masqueradings, and nondescript orgies; and a  scrupulous adherence to all the traditional forms was held to be of the  last moment, as the slightest failure in this respect might entail  serious calamities. If children were seen in their play imitating any of  these mysteries, they were grimly rebuked and punished. In many tribes  secret magical societies existed, and still exist, into which members  are initiated with peculiar ceremonies. These associations are greatly  respected and feared. They have charms for love, war, and private  revenge, and exert a great, and often a very mischievous influence. The  societies of the Metai and the Wabeno, among the Northern Algonquins,  are conspicuous examples; while other societies of similar character  have, for a century, been known to exist among the Dahcotah. [89]    [89] The Friendly Society of the Spirit, of which the initiatory  ceremonies were seen and described by Carver (Travels, 271), preserves  to this day its existence and its rites.    A notice of the superstitious ideas of the Indians would be imperfect  without a reference to the traditionary tales through which these ideas  are handed down from father to son. Some of these tales can be traced  back to the period of the earliest intercourse with Europeans. One at  least of those recorded by the first missionaries, on the Lower St.  Lawrence, is still current among the tribes of the Upper Lakes. Many of  them are curious combinations of beliefs seriously entertained with  strokes intended for humor and drollery, which never fail to awaken  peals of laughter in the lodge-circle. Giants, dwarfs, cannibals,  spirits, beasts, birds, and anomalous monsters, transformations, tricks,  and sorcery, form the staple of the story. Some of the Iroquois tales  embody conceptions which, however preposterous, are of a bold and  striking character; but those of the Algonquins are, to an incredible  degree, flimsy, silly, and meaningless; nor are those of the Dahcotah  tribes much better. In respect to this wigwam lore, there is a curious  superstition of very wide prevalence. The tales must not be told in  summer; since at that season, when all Nature is full of life, the  spirits are awake, and, hearing what is said of them, may take offence;  whereas in winter they are fast sealed up in snow and ice, and no longer  capable of listening. [90]    [90] The prevalence of this fancy among the Algonquins in the remote  parts of Canada is well established. The writer found it also among the  extreme western bands of the Dahcotah. He tried, in the month of July,  to persuade an old chief, a noted story-teller, to tell him some of the  tales; but, though abundantly loquacious in respect to his own  adventures, and even his dreams, the Indian obstinately refused, saying  that winter was the time for the tales, and that it was bad to tell them  in summer.    Mr. Schoolcraft has published a collection of Algonquin tales, under the  title of Algic Researches. Most of them were translated by his wife, an  educated Ojibwa half-breed. This book is perhaps the best of Mr.  Schoolcraft's works, though its value is much impaired by the want of a  literal rendering, and the introduction of decorations which savor more  of a popular monthly magazine than of an Indian wigwam. Mrs. Eastman's  interesting Legends of the Sioux (Dahcotah) is not free from the same  defect. Other tales are scattered throughout the works of Mr.  Schoolcraft and various modern writers. Some are to be found in the  works of Lafitau and the other Jesuits. But few of the Iroquois legends  have been printed, though a considerable number have been written down.  The singular History of the Five Nations, by the old Tuscarora Indian,  Cusick, gives the substance of some of them. Others will be found in  Clark's History of Onondaga.    It is obvious that the Indian mind has never seriously occupied itself  with any of the higher themes of thought. The beings of its belief are  not impersonations of the forces of Nature, the courses of human  destiny, or the movements of human intellect, will, and passion. In the  midst of Nature, the Indian knew nothing of her laws. His perpetual  reference of her phenomena to occult agencies forestalled inquiry and  precluded inductive reasoning. If the wind blew with violence, it was  because the water-lizard, which makes the wind, had crawled out of his  pool; if the lightning was sharp and frequent, it was because the young  of the thunder-bird were restless in their nest; if a blight fell upon  the corn, it was because the Corn Spirit was angry; and if the beavers  were shy and difficult to catch, it was because they had taken offence  at"]]]
