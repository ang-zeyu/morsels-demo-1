B._ xi. p. 290.        _Description._--Above cinereous, wings and tail rather darker; short      superciliaries white; beneath pale cinereous; throat white, with a      blackish rictal stripe on each side; fore neck slightly tinged with      fulvous; middle of belly whitish; lower belly and crissum strongly      suffused with fulvous; under wing-coverts pale fulvous; bill black;      feet brown: total length 8.5 inches, wing 4.3, tail 4.1. _Female_      similar.    _Hab._ Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina.    Mr. Durnford found this Saltator \"pretty common\" near Baradero, on low  scrubby ground near water, and afterwards obtained it near Salta. White  records it as \"very abundant\" near Oran.      46. SALTATOR AURANTIIROSTRIS, Vieill.    (YELLOW-BILLED SALTATOR.)      +Saltator aurantiirostris+, _d'Orb. Voy., Ois._ p. 288 (Corrientes);        _Burm. La-Plata Reise_, ii. p. 481 (Mendoza, Cordova, Tucuman,        Parana); _Scl. et Salv. Nomencl._ p. 26; _White, P. Z. S._ 1882,        p. 508 (Catamarca); _Barrows, Bull. Nutt. Orn. Cl._ viii. p. 91        (Concepcion); _Scl. Cat. B._ xi. p. 292.        _Description._--Above cinereous, with a slight olivaceous suffusion;      head rather darker; sides of head and throat black; superciliary      stripe, commencing above the eye, white; beneath pale cinereous      mixed with fulvous, a well-marked guttural collar joining the sides      of the throat black; ends of the outer rectrices more or less varied      with white; bill clear orange; feet greyish brown: whole length      7.5 inches, wing 3.6, tail 3.5. _Female_ similar, less brightly      coloured, and with the guttural collar almost or altogether absent.    _Hab._ Paraguay, Uruguay, and Northern Argentina.    In Corrientes d'Orbigny found this Saltator breeding in the month of  November. It frequents the shrubs and bushes in the neighbourhood of the  houses, and makes an open nest of roots, not of very neat construction.  The eggs are two or three, greenish blue, slightly spotted at the larger  end with blackish and reddish zigzag markings. The egg is figured in  d'Orbigny's 'Voyage' (pl. xxviii. fig. 3).    White tells us that this species is not uncommon in Catamarca, and  Barrows met with it at Concepcion in Entrerios.          Fam. X. FRINGILLIDAE, or FINCHES.      The extensive family of Finches, which has numerous representatives in  every part of the world, is well represented in the Argentine Republic.  Within the limits assigned to the present work forty-six species of his  group are already known to occur, and it is probable that this number  will be somewhat increased when the Argentine avifauna is thoroughly  worked out.    Most of the genera to which the Argentine Finches belong are forms  peculiar to the Neotropical Region, or at all events to the New World.  The genus _Chrysomitris_, which contains our Siskin and other Old-World  species, is the only one which has a wider distribution.    One of the most characteristic forms of Argentine Fringillidae is  _Poospiza_, of which seven species are met with within the limits of  the Republic, while _Lophospingus_, _Donacospiza_, _Gubernatrix_, and  _Saltatricula_ are Fringilline types peculiar to Argentina.      47. PHEUCTICUS AUREIVENTRIS (d'Orb. et Lafr.).    (BLACK-AND-YELLOW THICK-BILL.)      +Pheucticus aureiventris+, _Scl. et Salv. Nomencl._ p. 27; _White, P.        Z. S._ 1882, p. 598 (Salta); _Sharpe, Cat. B._ xii. p. 55.        _Description._--Above, also head, throat, and chest, black; lesser      wing-coverts yellow; two spots on the greater coverts and the base      of the primaries white; tail black, the three outer feathers on each      side tipped with white; belly and under wing-coverts bright yellow;      sides sparsely spotted with black; bill and feet black: total length      8.7 inches, wing 4.5, tail 3.5. _Female_ similar.    _Hab._ Bolivia and Northern Argentina.    Examples of this fine species, originally discovered by d'Orbigny in  Bolivia, were obtained by White in the forests of Salta.      48. GUIRACA CYANEA (Linn.).    (INDIGO FINCH.)      +Guiraca cyanea+, _Scl. et Salv. Nomencl._ p. 27; _White, P. Z. S._        1882, p. 598 (Catamarca). +Guiraca cyanea argentina+, _Sharpe,        Cat. B._ xii. p. 73.        _Description._--Indigo-blue; lesser wing-coverts azure-blue; wing-      and tail-feathers black; forehead azure-blue, and head washed with      the same colour; bill and feet black: total length 6.8 inches, wing      3.6, tail 2.9. _Female_ brown; beneath brighter and rufescent.    _Hab._ Brazil, Paraguay, and Northern Argentina.    White found this bird \"not uncommon around Andalgala in Catamarca, in  hedges and thickets.\" Mr. Sharpe separates the Argentine bird as a  subspecies, from its larger size.      49. GUIRACA GLAUCOCAERULEA (d'Orb. et Lafr.).    (GLAUCOUS FINCH.)      +Guiraca glaucocaerulea+, _Scl. et Salv. P. Z. S._ 1868, p. 139        (Buenos Ayres), _iid. Nomencl._ p. 27; _Durnford, Ibis_, 1877,        p. 170 (Buenos Ayres); _Salvin, Ibis_, 1880, p. 353 (Salta);        _Barrows, Bull. Nutt. Orn. Cl._ viii. p. 92 (Concepcion);        _Sharpe, Cat. B._ xii. p. 75. +Coccoborus glaucocaeruleus+,        _Burm. La-Plata Reise_, ii. p. 488 (Parana).        _Description._--Uniform glaucous blue; wings and tail blackish, the      feathers edged with light blue: total length 5.7 inches, wing 2.9,      tail 2.3.    _Hab._ Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina.    This is a rare Finch, and its massive beak and rich blue plumage give to  it a highly interesting appearance; but about its habits I have little  to tell, for it is essentially a bird of the wild forest, seldom coming  near the abodes of man, and being, moreover, shy in disposition, it is  difficult to observe it even in its haunts. It is migratory, and is  usually seen singly or in pairs, or in small companies of four or five  individuals. The male sings, but his performance is merely a confused  medley of chattering notes, uttered in so low a tone that they can  scarcely be heard at a distance of twelve yards.      50. ORYZOBORUS MAXIMILIANI, Cab.    (PRINCE MAX.'S FINCH.)      +Oryzoborus maximiliani+, _Burm. La-Plata Reise_, ii. p. 488        (Tucuman); _Sharpe, Cat. B._ xii. p. 78.        _Description._--Black; large alar speculum, axillaries, and under      wing-coverts white; bill pale yellow; feet brown: total length 5.8      inches, wing 2.9, tail 2.5. _Female_ brown; beneath brownish      ochraceous.    _Hab._ S. Brazil, Paraguay, and Northern Argentina.    This Finch is stated by Burmeister to occur near Tucuman.      51. SPERMOPHILA PALUSTRIS, Barrows.    (MARSH FINCH.)      +Spermophila palustris+, _Barrows, Bull. Nutt. Orn. Cl._ viii. p. 82        (Concepcion); _Sharpe, Cat. B._ xii. p. 112.        _Description._--Above, from bill to rump, clear bluish ash; below,      from bill to middle of breast, including lower eyelid, ear-coverts,      and sides of neck, pure white; rest of underparts, rump, and upper      tail-coverts bright chestnut-red; wings and tail blackish brown,      edged with whitish; inner secondaries black, their tips and outer      edges broadly white; a white patch across the base of all the      primaries except the first two; bill and feet black, iris dark:      total length 4.50 inches, wing 2.18, tail 1.70. _Female_ above      uniform greenish olive, obscurely streaked with dusky; below light      yellowish buff; wings and tail nearly as in male, but duller.    This small and beautiful Finch was discovered by Mr. Barrows in February  1880, on the Lower Uruguay. It inhabits the marshes, where the males  are frequently seen pursuing each other in the pairing-season,  occasionally pausing on the top of some tall grass to pour out their  delightful song. In character this resembles that of the Black-headed  Goldfinch; but has, Mr. Barrows says, a variety and sweetness far beyond  the powers of that bird.    It is just possible that Mr. Barrows's Finch may be Azara's unidentified  _Chipiu pardo y canela_ (Apuntamientos, vol. i. no. 143), which has the  same habits, living in the dense reed-beds of the Paraguayan marshes,  and is also a delightful singer,--superior to the Goldfinch or Canary,  Azara says.      52. SPERMOPHILA MELANOCEPHALA (Vieill.).    (BLACK-HEADED FINCH.)      +Spermophila melanocephala+, _Sharpe, Cat. B._ xii. p. 118.        _Description._--Above black; rump and lesser wing-coverts bright      rufous; large loral spot on each side white; wings and tail black;      alar speculum white; beneath, throat white, band across the breast      black; belly pale rufous; flanks and crissum dark rufous; under      wing-coverts white; bill and feet black: whole length 5.0 inches,      wing 2.4, tail 2.2.    _Hab._ Paraguay and Argentina.    A specimen of this species, now in the British Museum, was obtained by  Durnford at Punta Lara in October 1875.      53. SPERMOPHILA CAERULESCENS (Vieill.).

The maxillary bone has eroded away from  around the roots of M3, indicating the presence of an abscess in this  area.    K. U. 69362, _P. maniculatus_, adult: All teeth in the lower right  tooth-row are greatly worn, especially on the lingual side. The labial  half of the right M1 is all that remains; decay is apparent both in the  crown and roots on the lingual side of this tooth.    K. U. 69397, _P. maniculatus_, old: The maxillae have eroded away from  around the anterior roots of each first upper molar, leaving these roots  unsupported.    C. L. D. 231, _P. maniculatus_, old: The teeth in this female are  greatly worn; re-entrant angles are not visible in any teeth. A circular  hole, 0.1 millimeter in diameter, exists in the dentine immediately over  (when viewed from the underside of the skull) the posterior root of the  right M1. The crowns of the teeth are greatly reduced in height, and the  dentine is thin.      Anomalies in the Skull    Wormian bones and other abnormalities in the roofing bones are noted, as  follows:    K. U. 76090, _P. maniculatus_, young: The interparietal is divided; the  divided suture is in line with the suture between the parietals. The  interparietal is 7.8 millimeters long.    K. U. 76091, _P. maniculatus_, young: A wormian bone, 0.5 millimeter by  0.2 millimeter, lies between the anterior border of the interparietal  and the posterior border of the left parietal, at a point midway between  the center line of the skull and the posterolateral border of the  parietal bone.    C. L. D. 248, _P. maniculatus_, adult: An oval wormian bone, 1.1  millimeters long and 0.6 millimeter wide, lies between the parietals at  their posterior margin; the long axis of the bone is parallel to the  long axis of the skull.    C. L. D. 246, _P. maniculatus_, juvenal: The interparietal is divided  equally by a suture. An oval wormian bone, 0.3 millimeter long and 0.1  millimeter wide, lies between the frontals, midway between the anterior  and posterior borders of these bones.    C. L. D. 656, _P. maniculatus_, young: A small, rounded wormian bone  lies between the right parietal and interparietal, lateral to the  posterior junction of the suture between the parietals. This bone  extends anteriorly into the parietal bone from the suture of the  interparietal and parietal. This bone is 0.7 millimeter wide, and  extends 0.6 millimeter into the parietal.    C. L. D. 662, _P. maniculatus_, subadult: An elongated, diamond shaped  wormian bone closes the suture between the parietal bones. This bone is  2.3 millimeters long and 0.8 millimeter wide.    K. U. 34735, _P. truei_, old: The anterior one-quarter of the left  parietal bone is slightly depressed; and the posterior one-third of the  left frontal and anterior one-quarter of the left parietal are thin and  sculptured. This malformation of the roofing bones posterior to the  orbit probably is not the result of a break, for the orbital part of the  frontal bone is normal. The frontal-parietal sutures are in the normal  positions on both sides of the skull.    The above-mentioned anomalies do not appear to be correlated with age or  locality at which the specimens were taken. Apparently such anomalies  are present throughout the population, but in a small percentage of  specimens.          FOOD HABITS      Mice of the genus _Peromyscus_ are known to eat a wide variety of plants  and arthropods, and to be highly opportunistic in selection of food  (Cogshall, 1928; Hamilton, 1941; Williams, 1955, 1959a; Jameson, 1952;  Johnson, 1962). In order to determine possible food preferences, captive  mice of both species were fed plants indigenous to Mesa Verde. Entire  plants were used whenever possible; available seeds also were offered  (Tables 5, 6). All feeding experiments were replicated with at least six  different individuals in order to minimize the trends resulting from  individual preferences or dislikes. The mice of each species tended to  be consistent in their feeding.    The plant species listed in Tables 5 and 6 were those that were eaten or  rejected by a majority of the individuals tested.    Plant material eaten by _P. maniculatus_ and refused by _P. truei_  included only the leaves and stem of _Viguiera multiflora_. Plant  material eaten by _P. truei_ and refused by _P. maniculatus_ included  the leaves of _Calochortus gunnisonii_ and the leaves and stem of  _Erigeron speciosus_.

Plant materials refused by both species of mice included the leaves and  stem of _Chaenactis douglasii_, the leaves, stem and seeds of  _Lithospermum ruderale_, and the leaves, stem and flowers of _Solidago  petradoria_.    Cricetine rodents chew plant and animal foods thoroughly; contents of  their stomachs appear as finely-particulate fragments. These fragments  invariably contain pieces of epidermis from ingested plants. Due to the  presence of cutin in the cell walls, epidermis is last to be digested.    Microscopic analysis of plant epidermis is useful in helping to  determine food habits of various animals (Dusi, 1949; Williams, 1955,  1959a; Brusven and Mulkern, 1960; Johnson, 1962). The microscopic  analysis of stomach contents provides a practical method of determining  which plants are eaten by rodents. Contents of stomachs and intestines  were removed from mice caught in snap traps, and from preserved  specimens. The contents were placed on a piece of bolting silk, washed  thoroughly with running water, stained with iron-hematoxylin and mounted  on slides, or stored in 70 per cent ethanol (Williams, 1959a; Douglas,  1965).

Slides of the epidermis of these plants were  prepared and analyzed for diagnostic characters (Douglas, 1965:197-199).  Features such as the stomatal arrangement in relation to subsidiary  cells; the types of trichomes, scales and glands; the cellular  inclusions such as starch grains, mucilage and resins are of taxonomic  value (Metcalfe and Chalk, 1950). The configuration of the anticlinal  cell walls is useful in separating species that are similar in other  respects (Douglas, 1965:199).    The following species of plants, and other food items, were identified  in the stomach or intestinal contents of _Peromyscus maniculatus_:      _Agropyron smithii_    _Artemisia_ sp."]]]
