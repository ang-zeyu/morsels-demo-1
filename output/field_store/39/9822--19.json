[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41017"],[0,"South Africa and the Transvaal War, Vol. 5 (of 8) (#16)"],[1," his bomb-proof office receiving a procession of persons who filed in to  make their impossible demands, and deliberating on the curious fact that  the stomach rules the world. The honour of the British Empire at that  moment hung by a mere thread--it was a question of how slender a thread  of nourishment could keep body and soul tacked together to represent the  figure of an Englishman! Nevertheless Mafeking, like Kimberley, was  bound to have its marriage bells. A Dutch bride, ignorant of English,  was led to the altar by a private of the Bechuanaland Rifles, ignorant  of Dutch. Philosophers predicted considerable felicity, as between them  the couple had sufficient language for love-making and scarce sufficient  for controversy.    At this time Captain Ryan made a statement regarding the supplies of the  town, which serves to show the pitch to which caution was carried:--         \"The total number of white men is approximately 1150, of white       women 400, and of white children 300. The coloured population       consists of some 2000 men, 2000 women, and 3000 children.         \"Both the white and coloured men originally received eight       ounces of bread. The allowance has now been reduced to six, but       a quart of soup is given to make up the deficiency. Half a       gallon of sowan porridge a day will sustain life. The       recipients are of three classes; those who receive it in lieu       of two ounces of bread; those who wish to purchase food over       and above the quantity to which they are entitled; those who       are absolutely destitute, both black and white, and who receive       the porridge free. It has been suggested that the natives       should not be charged for sowan porridge, but it is thought       unwise to pauperise either blacks or whites. If any profit has       been made from the sale by the end of the siege it will be       employed in buying grain for the many native women and children       in Mafeking who have been involved in a quarrel which is not       theirs.         \"The horse soup is made from the carcasses of animals which had       ceased to be serviceable and those killed by the enemy's fire,       as well as horses and donkeys purchased from individuals who       can no longer afford to keep them. This soup is unpopular among       the natives, but this is due rather to prejudice than to its       quality.         \"The distribution of supplies is entirely under Imperial       control. The Army Service Corps possesses a slaughter-house, a       bakery, and a grocery, at which the authorities receive and       distribute all vegetables, and it receives and distributes milk       to the hospital, to women and children, and to men who have       been medically certified to need it.         \"At present the hospital is supplied with white bread, and it       is hoped that the supply will be continued. Hospital comforts       are issued to such as are in need of them, both in and out       patients, on receipt of an order from a medical officer. For       the nurses and doctors, who work day and night, the authorities       endeavoured to provide slightly better rations than those       available for the general community. Our sources of supply have       been chiefly through Mr. Weil, who had a large stock on hand       for the provisioning of the garrison, until the contract       terminated at the beginning of February. Since then supplies       have been collected from various merchants, storekeepers, and       private persons and stored in the Army Service Corps depot, and       from the original Army Service Corps stocks, of which forage       and oats formed a great proportion. Fresh beef is obtained by       purchase from a private individual named White, and in a lesser       degree from the natives.         \"Breadstuffs are obtained, like groceries, by commandeering the       stocks of various merchants and private persons.\"    Lord Roberts now commuted the sentence of the court-martial which tried  Lieutenant Murchison for the murder of Mr. Parslow to one of penal  servitude for life. Many of those who had been associated with this  officer did not consider him responsible for his actions, and were  relieved at the lightening of the punishment of a comrade-in-arms.    On the 27th Colonel Baden-Powell sent the following message to Lord  Roberts:--    \"After two hundred days' siege I desire to bring to your lordship's  notice the exceptionally good spirit of loyalty that pervades all  classes of this garrison. The patience of everybody in Mafeking in  making the best of things under the long strain of anxiety, hardship,  and privation is beyond all praise, and is a revelation to me. The men,  half of whom are unaccustomed to the use of arms, have adapted  themselves to their duties with the greatest zeal, readiness, and pluck,  and the devotion of the women is remarkable. With such a spirit our  organisation runs like clockwork, and I have every hope it will pull us  successfully through.\"    [Illustration: POSTAGE STAMPS ISSUED AT MAFEKING DURING THE SIEGE.]    At this time, the Boers being more peaceful, the citizens prepared to  celebrate the two hundredth day of the siege by horse dinners. Various  other mysterious meats, whose origin none dared investigate, appeared on  the bill of fare. One lady developed a genius for treating the meat  rations, and went so far as to give a dinner-party. Her process was  elaborate. The meat ration was cut up and the objectionable pieces  removed. It was then soaked in salt and water for three hours, and made  into soup thickened with starch. The next course was the beef out of the  soup, served with potato tops, which were found most delectable. Then  came a sowans pudding. Sowans proved a failure when served as porridge  or curry, but when the preparation was mixed with starch, bicarbonate of  soda, and baking powder, people were swift to partake.    In addition to the usual delicacies, minced mule and the aforesaid sowan  porridge, invented by an ingenious Scottish crofter of the name of Sims,  there was now manufactured a curious brawn of horsehide, which was  generally sneered at but devoured with alacrity. Curio hunters longed to  preserve a slab of it for presentation to the British Museum, but the  feat of self-abnegation was too hard to be endured. Besides, as some  philosopher said while putting it into a place of safety, it would be  the highest horse that was ever exhibited by the time it got there, and  the building wouldn't hold it. The community was almost entirely a  teetotal one. \"Wee drappies\" grew so wee as to be almost invisible, and  when a case of whisky was raffled for it fetched L107, 10s.!    On the 29th a military tournament was held, whereat a great display of  cheerfulness was affected, to cover the fact that fever, malarial and  typhoid, was gaining ground in the hospitals.      AFFAIRS IN RHODESIA    The Rhodesian troops were now at Moshwana, British Bechuanaland, in camp  some thirty miles from Mafeking. The small force with a single  serviceable gun could really accomplish little, and it was marvellous,  considering its extreme weakness, how it managed to maintain the  aggressive at all.    Early in April Colonel Plumer started a pigeon post, and the first  pigeon despatched arrived at Mafeking within four hours. The second was  not so fortunate, but later on the successful bird was sent off again,  on an educational trip, with younger birds in its wake.    On the 22nd Trooper Brindal of the Rhodesian Regiment died of the wounds  sustained in the action on the 31st of March. Archdeacon Upcher and  Father Hartman returned from the sad mission of discovering and burying  the remains of Lieutenant Milligan, who fell at Ramathlabama. The enemy  now were being reinforced from time to time by parties from east and  south, and as far as could be ascertained by Colonel Plumer, who sent  out native runners to apprise him of the doings of the southern relief  column, the Boers around Mafeking numbered about 3000.    On the 24th General Carrington's force, consisting of 1100 men, with  mounts and transports, arrived at Beira, and proceeded from thence to  Marandellas, twenty-five miles from Salisbury, the capital of Rhodesia.  The route, the first 200 miles of which is through Portuguese territory,  is covered by railway. The distance from Beira to Salisbury is some 375  miles. The Beira railway was carried in 1898 as far as New Umtali, where  it was connected with the system of the Mashonaland Railway Company. At  Salisbury the railway ceases, and between this point and Bulawayo, the  terminus of the Cape Railway, a space of 280 miles needed to be covered  by an extension. From Bulawayo all promised to be plain sailing, as,  owing to the untiring energies of Colonel Plumer and his small  force--whose valuable services have never been sufficiently  esteemed--the road and rail to Mafeking had been protected and  preserved.    On the 28th, Lieutenant Moorson left Mafeking and reached Colonel  Plumer's camp at noon of the 29th, conveying to him the latest  intelligence, and helping him to formulate plans for the big project of  relief which will be described anon.          CHAPTER III    THE SIEGE OF WEPENER      Early in April a portion of the Colonial Division, composed of Cape  Mounted Rifles, the Royal Scots Mounted Infantry, Driscoll's Scouts,  Kaffrarian Mounted Rifles under Captain Price, Brabant's Horse, two  15-pounders, two naval 12-pounders, two 7-pounders, one Hotchkiss, and  three Maxims, the whole force under Colonel Dalgety, crossed the Caledon  Bridge at Jammersberg Drift, took possession of it as the most important  strategetical point, and occupied the town of Wepener without  opposition. The Colonel had no sooner done so than he was surrounded by  Dutchmen, and made aware that he must prepare to stand a siege.

A garland laid him by, made by himself,    Of many several flowers, bred in the bay,    Stuck in that mystic order, that the rareness    Delighted me: but ever when he turn'd    His tender eyes upon 'em, he would weep,    As if he meant to make 'em grow again.    Seeing such pretty helpless innocence    Dwell in his face, I ask'd him all his story.    He told me that his parents gentle died,    Leaving him to the mercy of the fields.    Which gave him roots; and of the crystal springs    Which did not stop their courses; and the sun    Which still, he thank'd him, yielded him his light.
