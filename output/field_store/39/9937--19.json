Armenia is a large   food importer and its mineral deposits (gold, bauxite) are small. The   economic decline in recent years (1991-94) has been particularly   severe due to the ongoing conflict over the ethnic Armenian-dominated   region of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan and Turkey have   blockaded pipeline and railroad traffic to Armenia for its support of   the Karabakh Armenians. This has left Armenia with chronic energy   shortages because of a lack of capacity and frequent disruptions of   natural gas deliveries through unstable Georgia, as well as   difficulties in obtaining other types of fuel. In addition, bread is   strictly rationed and there are shortages of other goods. In 1994, the   economy seemed to bottom out. The government has managed to increase   its financial and budgetary discipline, bringing inflation down from   around 40% per month in first half 1994 to single digits in second   half 1994 and the first quarter of 1995. A full economic recovery   cannot be expected until the conflict is settled and the blockade   lifted.

He did lock the  cupboard door; but without properly  shutting it. He went to bed early,  and told Pigling upon no account  to disturb him next day before  twelve o'clock.    Pigling Bland sat by the fire,  eating his supper.      All at once at his elbow, a little  voice spoke--\"My name is Pig-wig.  Make me more porridge, please!\"  Pigling Bland jumped, and looked  round.    A perfectly lovely little black  Berkshire pig stood smiling beside  him. She had twinkly little screwed  up eyes, a double chin, and a short  turned up nose.    She pointed at Pigling's plate; he  hastily gave it to her, and fled to  the meal chest--\"How did you  come here?\" asked Pigling Bland.    \"Stolen,\" replied Pig-wig, with  her mouth full. Pigling helped himself  to meal without scruple. \"What  for?\" \"Bacon, hams,\" replied Pig-  wig cheerfully. \"Why on earth don't  you run away?\" exclaimed the  horrified Pigling.    \"I shall after supper,\" said Pig-  wig decidedly.    Pigling Bland made more porridge  and watched her shyly.    She finished a second plate, got  up, and looked about her, as  though she were going to start.    \"You can't go in the dark,\" said  Pigling Bland.    Pig-wig looked anxious.    \"Do you know your way by day-  light?\"    \"I know we can see this little  white house from the hills across  the river. Which way are _you_ going,  Mr. Pig?\"    \"To market--I have two pig  papers. I might take you to the bridge;  if you have no objection,\" said  Pigling much confused and sitting  on the edge of his coppy stool. Pig-  wig's gratitude was such and she  asked so many questions that it  became embarrassing to Pigling  Bland.    He was obliged to shut his eyes  and pretend to sleep. She became  quiet, and there was a smell of  peppermint.    \"I thought you had eaten them?\"  said Pigling, waking suddenly.    \"Only the corners,\" replied Pig-  wig, studying the sentiments with  much interest by the firelight.    \"I wish you wouldn't; he might  smell them through the ceiling,\"  said the alarmed Pigling.    Pig-wig put back the sticky  peppermints into her pocket; \"Sing  something,\" she demanded.    \"I am sorry. . . I have tooth-  ache,\" said Pigling much dismayed.    \"Then I will sing,\" replied Pig-  wig, \"You will not mind if I say  iddy tidditty? I have forgotten some  of the words.\"    Pigling Bland made no objection;  he sat with his eyes half shut, and  watched her.    She wagged her head and rocked  about, clapping time and singing in  a sweet little grunty voice--     \"A funny old mother pig lived in a stye,       and three little piggies had she;   \"(Ti idditty idditty) umph, umph,       umph! and the little pigs said wee,       wee!\"      She sang successfully through  three or four verses, only at every  verse her head nodded a little  lower, and her little twinkly eyes  closed up--     \"Those three little piggies grew peaky       and lean, and lean they might very       well be;   \"For somehow they couldn't say umph,       umph, umph! and they wouldn't       say wee, wee, wee!   \"For somehow they couldn't say--      Pig-wig's head bobbed lower and  lower, until she rolled over, a little  round ball, fast asleep on the  hearth-rug.    Pigling Bland, on tiptoe, covered  her up with an antimacassar.    He was afraid to go to sleep himself;  for the rest of the night he sat  listening to the chirping of the  crickets and to the snores of Mr.  Piperson overhead.    Early in the morning, between  dark and daylight, Pigling tied up  his little bundle and woke up Pig-  wig. She was excited and half-  frightened. \"But it's dark! How can  we find our way?\"    \"The cock has crowed; we must  start before the hens come out; they  might shout to Mr. Piperson.\"    Pig-wig sat down again, and  commenced to cry.      \"Come away Pig-wig; we can see  when we get used to it. Come! I can  hear them clucking!\"    Pigling had never said shuh! to a  hen in his life, being peaceable;  also he remembered the hamper.    He opened the house door quietly  and shut it after them. There was  no garden; the neighborhood of  Mr. Piperson's was all scratched up  by fowls. They slipped away hand  in hand across an untidy field to  the road.   \"Tom, Tom the piper's son, stole a pig       and away he ran!   \"But all the tune that he could play, was       `Over the hills and far away!'\"      \"Come Pig-wig, we must get to  the bridge before folks are stirring.\"    \"Why do you want to go to  market, Pigling?\" inquired Pig-wig.    The sun rose while they were  crossing the moor, a dazzle of light  over the tops of the hills. The sunshine  crept down the slopes into  the peaceful green valleys, where  little white cottages nestled in  gardens and orchards.    \"That's Westmorland,\" said Pig-  wig. She dropped Pigling's hand  and commenced to dance, singing--  presently. \"I don't want; I want to  grow potatoes.\" \"Have a peppermint?\"  said Pig-wig. Pigling Bland  refused quite crossly. \"Does your  poor toothy hurt?\" inquired Pig-  wig. Pigling Bland grunted.    Pig-wig ate the peppermint herself,  and followed the opposite side  of the road. \"Pig-wig! keep under  the wall, there's a man ploughing.\"  Pig-wig crossed over, they hurried  down hill towards the county  boundary.    Suddenly Pigling stopped; he  heard wheels.    Slowly jogging up the road below  them came a tradesman's cart. The  reins flapped on the horse's back,  the grocer was reading a newspaper.    \"Take that peppermint out of  your mouth, Pig-wig, we may have  to run. Don't say one word. Leave it  to me. And in sight of the bridge!\"  said poor Pigling, nearly crying.  He began to walk frightfully lame,  holding Pig-wig's arm.    The grocer, intent upon his  newspaper, might have passed  them, if his horse had not shied  and snorted. He pulled the cart  crossways, and held down his  whip. \"Hallo? Where are you going  to?\"--Pigling Bland stared at him  vacantly.    \"Are you deaf? Are you going to  market?\" Pigling nodded slowly.    \"I thought as much. It was  yesterday. Show me your license?\"    Pigling stared at the off hind  shoe of the grocer's horse which  had picked up a stone.    The grocer flicked his whip--  \"Papers? Pig license?\" Pigling fumbled  in all his pockets, and handed  up the papers. The grocer read  them, but still seemed dissatisfied.  \"This here pig is a young lady; is  her name Alexander?\" Pig-wig  opened her mouth and shut it  again; Pigling coughed asthmatically.    The grocer ran his finger down  the advertisement column of his  newspaper--\"Lost, stolen or  strayed, 10S. reward;\" he looked  suspiciously at Pig-wig. Then he  stood up in the trap, and whistled  for the ploughman.    \"You wait here while I drive on  and speak to him,\" said the grocer,  gathering up the reins. He knew  that pigs are slippery; but surely,  such a VERY lame pig could never  run!    \"Not yet, Pig-wig, he will look  back.\" The grocer did so; he saw the  two pigs stock-still in the middle  of the road. Then he looked over at  his horse's heels; it was lame also;  the stone took some time to knock  out, after he got to the ploughman.    \"Now, Pig-wig, NOW!\" said  Pigling Bland.    Never did any pigs run as these  pigs ran! They raced and squealed  and pelted down the long white hill  towards the bridge. Little fat Pig-  wig's petticoats fluttered, and her  feet went pitter, patter, pitter, as  she bounded and jumped.    They ran, and they ran, and they  ran down the hill, and across a  short cut on level green turf at the  bottom, between pebble beds and  rushes.    They came to the river, they  came to the bridge--they crossed it  hand in hand--then over the hills  and far away she danced with Pigling  Bland!        GINGER AND PICKLES    [Dedicated  With very kind regards to old Mr. John Taylor,  Who \"thinks he might pass as a dormouse,\"  (Three years in bed and never a grumble!).]          Once upon a time there was  a village shop. The name over  the window was \"Ginger and  Pickles.\"    It was a little small shop  just the right size for Dolls--  Lucinda and Jane Doll-cook  always bought their groceries  at Ginger and Pickles.    The counter inside was a  convenient height for rabbits.  Ginger and Pickles sold red  spotty pocket handkerchiefs at  a penny three farthings.    They also sold sugar, and  snuff and galoshes.    In fact, although it was  such a small shop it sold  nearly everything--except a  few things that you want in  a hurry--like bootlaces, hair-  pins and mutton chops.    Ginger and Pickles were the  people who kept the shop.  Ginger was a yellow tomcat,  and Pickles was a terrier.    The rabbits were always a  little bit afraid of Pickles.      The shop was also patronized  by mice--only the mice  were rather afraid of Ginger.    Ginger usually requested  Pickles to serve them, because  he said it made his mouth  water.    \"I cannot bear,\" said he, \"to  see them going out at the door  carrying their little parcels.\"    \"I have the same feeling  about rats,\" replied Pickles,  \"but it would never do to eat  our customers; they would  leave us and go to Tabitha  Twitchit's.\"    \"On the contrary, they  would go nowhere,\" replied  Ginger gloomily.    (Tabitha Twitchit kept the  only other shop in the village.  She did not give credit.)    But there is no money in  what is called the \"till.\"    Ginger and Pickles gave  unlimited credit.    Now the meaning of  \"credit\" is this--when a customer  buys a bar of soap, instead  of the customer pulling  out a purse and paying for it  --she says she will pay another  time.    And Pickles makes a low  bow and says, \"With pleasure,  madam,\" and it is written  down in a book.    The customers come again  and again, and buy quantities,  in spite of being afraid of  Ginger and Pickles.      The customers came in  crowds every day and bought  quantities, especially the  toffee customers. But there was  always no money; they"]]]
