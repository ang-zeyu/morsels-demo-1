[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46521"],[0,"Forty Years Among the Indians (#16)"],[1," as our meat was about  out and we expected to soon butcher the fattest of them.    Early next morning Brother Hampton and I saddled up and started out  before breakfast to hunt the cattle, not expecting to be gone more  than an hour. We soon struck their trail going east, most of the time  showing they were on the move, not often feeding. At sundown we were  about thirty miles from camp, still trailing and tolerably hungry; but  that trail _could not be left_. We followed on, the tracks running almost  parallel with the road but gradually nearing it. It now became too dark  to see the trail.    We were continually expecting to hear the bell, but no bell sounded. We  continued in the same direction until we reached the main road. After  following it a short distance Brother Hampton dismounted and felt for  tracks. He soon decided that the cattle were now on the road as he  could feel the tracks where the ground had been lately disturbed, the  road being dry and soft in places. Thus we continued to travel for some  four or five miles feeling for tracks. At length we came to a gulch  crossing the road, several feet deep and full of snow. We could see  where the cattle had crossed as the moon was now up and we could trail  quite well; but on attempting to cross the drift, we sank down. At this  season of the year these snow-drifts freeze in the night time, thawing  out in the afternoon and gradually melting away so that from noon until  after midnight it is impossible for a horse to cross them; men often  crossing on hands and knees, or if the snow is quite soft lying down  and rolling across. This we could have done but our horses did not feel  as anxious as we did to go on; so when we proposed to them to roll  across the drift, they pretended not to understand us.    We followed up the drift for quite a distance, but it remained the  same white streak of snow as far as we could see by moonlight, so we  concluded to turn in until morning when the snow would be hardened. It  was now getting quite chilly, we had eaten nothing all day, all the  bedding we had was a couple of small saddle blankets, and there was  nothing to make a fire with but a little green sagebrush. But if there  had been fuel we would have been afraid to light a fire as the Crow  Indians were in the country and might steal our horses.    We went to \"ground\" but did not sleep much. It soon became so cold that  we almost froze to death. When we thought the snow was hard enough we  got up, but were so chilled we could not saddle our horses. We were  almost lifeless, and commenced stirring about to bring life back. We  commenced bumping against each other, sometimes knocking one another  down. We got to laughing at the ridiculousness of our actions, more  life returned, our teeth began chattering and our bodies shaking, but  we kept up this jostling each other until we started circulation and  were able to saddle up and go on. It was daylight before we got thawed  out. We walked until we got well warmed up the trail following right on  the road.    About ten o'clock a. m. we found the cattle. They had finally turned  off the road to feed. We were now about forty-five miles from home.  The first thing I proposed after finding the cattle was to cut their  tails off, tie a string around the stubs to keep them from bleeding,  roast the tails and eat them, for I felt wolfish. Ben objected, saying  it might weaken the cattle and that he believed we could stand it back  home; that the cattle were good travelers and may be we could reach the  fort by midnight. Our horses (or rather, horse and mule. As I will soon  have to deal a little with a mule it will not do to call him a horse  now) were all right, having been on good feed the night before. The  cattle, on being turned back, took the road in good shape, starting on  a trot.    We were anxious to get back and cross the snowdrift before it softened  up. This we succeeded in doing, and continued traveling until after  noon before \"bating.\" We had more sympathy for ourselves than for our  animals, for we were getting a little hungry and dreaded the thought  of having to \"go to ground\" again. So we kept up our speed. Finally  Ben's mule began to weaken. We had considerable trouble to get it  along, but by one leading and the other walking and whipping we got to  Independence Rock, where there were three or four men camped in some  old houses. This was about six miles from our fort. Here we had a trial  I think few men would have stood. As we rode up they had a good fire  burning, a nice supper cooked and were just ready to commence eating.    They had stayed the night before at our camp where they had arrived  destitute and out of provisions. Brother Alexander had told them about  us. Our company was very anxious about us. They had given these poor  fellows what provisions they could spare, enough to last them to Platte  bridge provided they made the trip in reasonable time. One of the party  had frozen his feet and was suffering terribly. We soon learned their  condition, but they insisted on us eating supper. We thought of the  poor lame fellow getting out of food; we were within six miles of home  so we pretended that we were not very hungry, and advised them to be  careful of what they had and we would go on home. The smell of the food  to us was like piercing our stomachs with a dagger. It was really hard  to refuse taking a few bites, but we did.    When we had got about half way home I went ahead with the cattle, Ben  driving the tired mule. I wished to get in and have supper ready by the  time my comrade arrived, which I did not suppose would be over one half  hour. On arriving at the fort, most of the company were up waiting in  suspense our arrival.    Brother Alexander had a camp kettle full of meat and soup with  dumplings ready. It was rations for seven men. He had kept it warm  all day, and commenced to dish some up for me, but I told him that I  would not eat a bite until Ben came. It was more than an hour before he  arrived, the give-out mule having broken loose and ran away from him  and he had been following it. Finally he arrived, bringing the mule and  feeling very much like beefing it when he got home.    All now was ready for our supper. We sat down on some wolf skins  before the fire, the camp-kettle in reach, and commenced to eat, but  not hurriedly. Before daylight we had emptied the kettle. We relished  this feast fully and did not suffer any inconvenience. Both of us were  well and feeling first rate next day after having a good sleep. As the  cattle were so much bother we concluded to kill them.        CHAPTER XVIII.

About this time another Y. X. company, under Porter Rockwell and John  Murdock, arrived going east. They gave us a little flour and other  provisions; they also brought us letters telling us when the relief  train would arrive. With the three head of cattle and what this company  furnished us, we felt safe for supplies until time for the relief  trains.    Here I will give an account of a little personal matter that may seem  like boasting, but I do not intend it so. This company stayed with us  two nights. They were picked men, thirty in number, able-bodied, tough  boys. On hearing of our sufferings many remarks were made showing deep  sympathy for us.    At this time we were well recruited, having had plenty of meat for  some time but scarcely any flour for some five months. Bread we had  hardly tasted. In fact, the first biscuit I got almost choked me, I had  entirely lost my appetite for it.    The morning the Y. X. company were getting ready to start on, a young  man, Mr. Eldredge, who was going down as a passenger, expressed much  indignation, saying that there could be no excuse for leaving men to  suffer as we had. I did not like to hear this said, for I knew there  were justifiable reasons for leaving us to take care of the goods. I  also knew Brothers Grant and Burton would have sent us help if they  could. It was expected that the cattle left would have been better beef  than they turned out to be.    I had neither time nor disposition to explain all these things, so to  stop the talk that I had got a little tired of hearing, I said to Mr.  Eldredge, \"We do not need your sympathy; we are all right now; none of  us have died, and I am a better man than any of your company, picked  men as you are.\"    \"How do you propose to prove this, Mr. Jones? Will you pull sticks with  our best man? I will not allow you rawhide-fed fellows to banter the  corn-fed boys that way.\"    I was a little fearful that I was \"sold,\" for I knew there were some  stout men in their company; but as the banter was made, to back out  would be worse than to get beat, so I said, \"Bring him on; I will hoist  him.\"    Mr. Eldredge came back with John Murdock, who was smiling. Now I really  wished I had not made the banter, for John was an old friend who was  hard to pull up.    A ring was formed, both companies helping to form a circle. \"Rawhide  against corn\" was the cry. We sat down and got an even start. It was a  hard pull, but \"Rawhide\" won, and we got no more pity from that company.    Making a close estimate of the food we now had, we found it would last  us till the promised provisions could arrive, which would be about the  1st of May.    There were twenty of us now. We quit rationing and ate all we wanted.  As may be imagined, some big eating was done. Now the food soon began  to diminish very fast. At this time we could go to the Platte bridge  and get provisions, but on calling the company together all hands  agreed to make the meat last by again rationing. We could do this"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4657"],[0,"Personal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah & Meccah — Volume 1 (#16)"],[1,"mountain[FN#39] at once\" (i.e., go to the desert), \"and  say thy prayers day and night!\"    And finally, he is prodigal of preaching upon the subject of household  expenses.    \"Thy servant did write down two pounds of flesh yesterday! What words  are these, O he?[FN#40] Dost thou never say, Guard us, Allah, from the  sin of extravagance?'\"    He delights also in abruptly interrupting a serious subject when it  begins to weigh upon his spirits. For instance,    Now the waters of ablution being of seven different kinds, it results  that-hast thou a wife?-No?-Then verily thou must buy thee a female  slave, O youth! This conduct is not right, and men will say of  thee-Repentance: I take refuge with Allah[FN#41]-of a truth his mouth  watereth for the spouses of other Moslems.'\"    [p.73]But sometimes he nods over a difficult passage under my very  eyes, or he reads it over a dozen times in the wantonness of idleness,  or he takes what school-boys call a long \"shot\" most shamelessly at the  signification. When this happens I lose my temper, and raise my voice,  and shout, \"Verily there is no power nor might save in Allah, the High,  the Great!\" Then he looks at me, and with passing meekness whispers-    \"Fear Allah, O man!\"    [FN#1] The second is an imitative word, called in Arabic grammar  Tabi'a, as \"Zayd Bayd,\" \"Zayd and others;\" so used, it denotes contempt  for drachms and similar parts of drug-craft.  [FN#2] This familiar abbreviation of Wali al-Din was the name assumed  by the enterprising traveller, Dr. Wallin.  [FN#3] By the Indians called Bhang, the Persians Bang, the Hottentots  Dakha, and the natives of Barbary Fasukh. Even the Siberians, we are  told, intoxicate themselves by the vapour of this seed thrown upon  red-hot stones. Egypt surpasses all other nations in the variety of  compounds into which this fascinating drug enters, and will one day  probably supply the Western world with \"Indian hemp,\" when its solid  merits are duly appreciated. At present in Europe it is chiefly  confined, as cognac and opium used to be, to the apothecary's shelves.  Some adventurous individuals at Paris, after the perusal of Monte  Christo, attempted an \"orgie\" in one of the cafes, but with poor  success.  [FN#4] The Indian name of an Afghan, supposed to be a corruption of the  Arabic Fat'han (a conqueror), or a derivation from the Hindustani  paithna, to penetrate (into the hostile ranks). It is an honourable  term in Arabia, where \"Khurasani\" (a native of Khorasan), leads men to  suspect a Persian, and the other generic appellation of the Afghan  tribes \"Sulaymani,\" a descendant from Solomon, reminds the people of  their proverb, \"Sulaymani harami!\"-\"the Afghans are ruffians!\"  [FN#5] For the simple reason that no Eastern power confers such an  obligation except for value received. In old times, when official  honour was not so rigorous as it is now, the creditors of Eastern  powers and principalities would present high sums to British Residents  and others for the privilege of being enrolled in the list of their  subjects or servants. This they made profitable; for their claims,  however exorbitant, when backed by a name of fear, were certain to be  admitted, unless the Resident's conscience would allow of his being  persuaded by weightier arguments of a similar nature to abandon his  protege. It is almost needless to remark that nothing of the kind can  occur in the present day, and at the same time that throughout the  Eastern world it is firmly believed that such things are of daily  occurrence. Ill fame descends to distant generations; whilst good  deeds, if they blossom, as we are told, in the dust, are at least as  short-lived as they are sweet.  [FN#6] A doctor, a learned man; not to be confounded with Hakim, a  ruler.  [FN#7] It may be as well to remark that our slave laws require reform  throughout the East, their severity, like Draco's Code, defeating their  purpose. In Egypt, for instance, they require modification. Constitute  the offence a misdemeanour, not a felony, inflict a fine (say L100),  half of which should be given to the informer, and make the  imprisonment either a short one, or, what would be better still, let it  be done away with, except in cases of non-payment; and finally, let the  Consul or some other magistrate residing at the place have power to  inflict the penalty of the law, instead of being obliged, as at  present, to transmit offenders to Malta for trial. As the law now  stands, our officials are unwilling to carry its rigours into effect;  they therefore easily lend an ear to the standard excuse-ignorance-in  order to have an opportunity of decently dismissing a man, with a  warning not to do it again.  [FN#8] Yet at the time there was at Alexandria an acting  Consul-General, to whom the case could with strict propriety have been  referred.  [FN#9] Johann Gottlieb Fichte expressly declares that the scope of his  system has never been explained by words, and that it even admits not  of being so explained. To make his opinions intelligible, he would  express them by a system of figures, each of which must have a known  and positive value.  [FN#10] M. C. de Perceval (Arabic Grammar), and Lane (Mod. Egyptians,  Chapter 8 et passim), give specimens.  [FN#11] A monogram generally placed at the head of writings. It is the  initial letter of \"Allah,\" and the first of the alphabet, used from  time immemorial to denote the origin of creation. \"I am Alpha and  Omega, the first and the last.\"  [FN#12] \"Ala-rik,\" that is to say, fasting-the first thing in the  morning.  [FN#13] The Almighty.  [FN#14] W'as-salam, i.e. adieu.  [FN#15] From M. Huc we learn that Jin-seng is the most considerable  article of Manchurian commerce, and that throughout China there is no  chemist's shop unprovided with more or less of it. He adds: \"The  Chinese report marvels of the Jin-seng, and no doubt it is for Chinese  organisation a tonic of very great effect for old and weak persons; but  its nature is too heating, the Chinese physicians admit, for the  European temperament, already in their opinion too hot. The price is  enormous, and doubtless its dearness contributes with a people like the  Chinese to raise its celebrity so high. The rich and the Mandarins  probably use it only because it is above the reach of other people, and  out of pure ostentation.\" It is the principal tonic used throughout  Central Asia, and was well known in Europe when Sarsaparilla arose to  dispute with it the palm of popularity. In India, Persia, and  Afghanistan, it is called chob-chini,-the \"Chinese wood.\" The  preparations are in two forms, 1. Sufuf, or powder; 2. Kahwah, or  decoction. The former is compound of Radix China Qrient, with gum  mastich and sugar-candy, equal parts; about a dram of this compound is  taken once a day, early in the morning. For the decoction one ounce of  fine parings is boiled for a quarter of an hour in a quart of water.  When the liquid assumes a red colour it is taken off the fire and left  to cool. Furthermore, there are two methods of adhibiting the  choh-chini: 1. Band; 2. Khola. The first is when the patient confines  himself to a garden, listening to music, enjoying the breeze, the song  of birds, and the bubbling of a flowing stream. He avoids everything  likely to trouble and annoy him; he will not even open a letter, and  the doctor forbids anyone to contradict him. Some grandees in central  Asia will go through a course of forty days in every second year; it  reminds one of Epicurus' style of treatment,-the downy bed, the  garlands of flowers, the good wine, and the beautiful singing girl, and  is doubtless at least as efficacious in curing as the sweet relaxation  of Gräfenberg or Malvern. So says Socrates, according to the Anatomist  of Melancholy,  \"Oculum non curabis sine toto capite,  Nec caput sine toto corpore,  Nec totum corpus sine animo.\"  The \"Khola\" signifies that you take the tonic without other precautions  than the avoiding acids, salt, and pepper, and choosing summer time, as  cold is supposed to induce rheumatism.  [FN#16] Certain Lamas who, we learn from M. Huc, perform famous Sie-fa,  or supernaturalisms, such as cutting open the abdomen, licking red-hot  irons, making incisions in various parts of the body, which an instant  afterwards leave no trace behind, &c., &c. The devil may \"have a great  deal to do with the matter\" in Tartary, for all I know; but I can  assure M. Huc, that the Rufa'i Darwayshes in India and the Sa'adiyah at  Cairo perform exactly the same feats. Their jugglery, seen through the  smoke of incense, and amidst the enthusiasm of a crowd, is tolerably  dexterous, and no more.  [FN#17] A holy man. The word has a singular signification in a plural  form, \"honoris causa.\"  [FN#18] A title literally meaning the \"Master of Breath,\" one who can  cure ailments, physical as well as spiritual, by breathing upon them-a  practice well known to mesmerists. The reader will allow me to observe,  (in self-defence, otherwise he might look suspiciously upon so  credulous a narrator), that when speaking of animal magnetism, as a  thing established, I allude to the lower phenomena, rejecting the  discussion of all disputed points, as the existence of a magnetic Aura,  and of all its unintelligibilities-Prevision, Levitation, Introvision,  and other divisions of Clairvoyance.  [FN#19] In the generality, not in all. Nothing, for instance, can be  more disgraceful to human nature than the state of praedial slavery, or  serfs attached to the glebe, when Malabar was under the dominion of the  \"mild Hindu.\" And as a rule in the East it is only the domestic slaves  who taste the sweets of slavery. Yet there is truth in Sonnini's  terrible remark: \"The severe treatment under which the slaves languish  in the West Indies is the shameful prerogative of civilisation, and is  unknown to those nations among whom barbarism is reported to hold  sway.\" (Travels in Upper and"]]]
