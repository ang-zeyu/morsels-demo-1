Still farther to leeward  was a great headland, and I bore off for that. This was retracing my  course toward Sandy Point, for the gale was from the southwest.    I had the sloop soon under good control, however, and in a short time  rounded to under the lee of a mountain, where the sea was as smooth as  a mill-pond, and the sails flapped and hung limp while she carried her  way close in. Here I thought I would anchor and rest till morning, the  depth being eight fathoms very close to the shore. But it was  interesting to see, as I let go the anchor, that it did not reach the  bottom before another williwaw struck down from this mountain and  carried the sloop off faster than I could pay out cable. Therefore,  instead of resting, I had to \"man the windlass\" and heave up the  anchor with fifty fathoms of cable hanging up and down in deep water.  This was in that part of the strait called Famine Reach. Dismal Famine  Reach! On the sloop's crab-windlass I worked the rest of the night,  thinking how much easier it was for me when I could say, \"Do that  thing or the other,\" than now doing all myself. But I hove away and  sang the old chants that I sang when I was a sailor. Within the last  few days I had passed through much and was now thankful that my state  was no worse.    It was daybreak when the anchor was at the hawse. By this time the  wind had gone down, and cat's-paws took the place of williwaws, while  the sloop drifted slowly toward Sandy Point. She came within sight of  ships at anchor in the roads, and I was more than half minded to put  in for new sails, but the wind coming out from the northeast, which  was fair for the other direction, I turned the prow of the _Spray_  westward once more for the Pacific, to traverse a second time the  second half of my first course through the strait.          CHAPTER IX      Repairing the _Spray's_ sails--Savages and an obstreperous anchor-A  spider-fight--An encounter with Black Pedro--A visit to the steamship  _Colombia_,--On the defensive against a fleet of canoes--A record of  voyages through the strait--A chance cargo of tallow.    I was determined to rely on my own small resources to repair the  damages of the great gale which drove me southward toward the Horn,  after I had passed from the Strait of Magellan out into the Pacific.  So when I had got back into the strait, by way of Cockburn Channel, I  did not proceed eastward for help at the Sandy Point settlement, but  turning again into the northwestward reach of the strait, set to work  with my palm and needle at every opportunity, when at anchor and when  sailing. It was slow work; but little by little the squaresail on the  boom expanded to the dimensions of a serviceable mainsail with a peak  to it and a leech besides. If it was not the best-setting sail afloat,  it was at least very strongly made and would stand a hard blow. A  ship, meeting the _Spray_ long afterward, reported her as wearing a  mainsail of some improved design and patent reefer, but that was not  the case.    The _Spray_ for a few days after the storm enjoyed fine weather, and  made fair time through the strait for the distance of twenty miles,  which, in these days of many adversities, I called a long run. The  weather, I say, was fine for a few days; but it brought little rest.  Care for the safety of my vessel, and even for my own life, was in no  wise lessened by the absence of heavy weather. Indeed, the peril was  even greater, inasmuch as the savages on comparatively fine days  ventured forth on their marauding excursions, and in boisterous  weather disappeared from sight, their wretched canoes being frail and  undeserving the name of craft at all. This being so, I now enjoyed  gales of wind as never before, and the _Spray_ was never long without  them during her struggles about Cape Horn. I became in a measure  inured to the life, and began to think that one more trip through the  strait, if perchance the sloop should be blown off again, would make me  the aggressor, and put the Fuegians entirely on the defensive. This  feeling was forcibly borne in on me at Snug Bay, where I anchored at  gray morning after passing Cape Froward, to find, when broad day  appeared, that two canoes which I had eluded by sailing all night were  now entering the same bay stealthily under the shadow of the high  headland. They were well manned, and the savages were well armed with  spears and bows. At a shot from my rifle across the bows, both turned  aside into a small creek out of range. In danger now of being flanked  by the savages in the bush close aboard, I was obliged to hoist the  sails, which I had barely lowered, and make across to the opposite  side of the strait, a distance of six miles. But now I was put to my  wit's end as to how I should weigh anchor, for through an accident to  the windlass right here I could not budge it. However, I set all sail  and filled away, first hauling short by hand. The sloop carried her  anchor away, as though it was meant to be always towed in this way  underfoot, and with it she towed a ton or more of kelp from a reef in  the bay, the wind blowing a wholesale breeze.    Meanwhile I worked till blood started from my fingers, and with one  eye over my shoulder for savages, I watched at the same time, and sent  a bullet whistling whenever I saw a limb or a twig move; for I kept a  gun always at hand, and an Indian appearing then within range would  have been taken as a declaration of war. As it was, however, my own  blood was all that was spilt--and from the trifling accident of  sometimes breaking the flesh against a cleat or a pin which came in  the way when I was in haste. Sea-cuts in my hands from pulling on  hard, wet ropes were sometimes painful and often bled freely; but  these healed when I finally got away from the strait into fine  weather.    After clearing Snug Bay I hauled the sloop to the wind, repaired the  windlass, and hove the anchor to the hawse, catted it, and then  stretched across to a port of refuge under a high mountain about six  miles away, and came to in nine fathoms close under the face of a  perpendicular cliff. Here my own voice answered back, and I named the  place \"Echo Mountain.\" Seeing dead trees farther along where the shore  was broken, I made a landing for fuel, taking, besides my ax, a rifle,  which on these days I never left far from hand; but I saw no living  thing here, except a small spider, which had nested in a dry log that  I boated to the sloop. The conduct of this insect interested me now  more than anything else around the wild place. In my cabin it met,  oddly enough, a spider of its own size and species that had come all  the way from Boston--a very civil little chap, too, but mighty spry.  Well, the Fuegian threw up its antennae for a fight; but my little  Bostonian downed it at once, then broke its legs, and pulled them off,  one by one, so dexterously that in less than three minutes from the  time the battle began the Fuegian spider didn't know itself from a  fly.    I made haste the following morning to be under way after a night of  wakefulness on the weird shore. Before weighing anchor, however, I  prepared a cup of warm coffee over a smart wood fire in my great  Montevideo stove. In the same fire was cremated the Fuegian spider,  slain the day before by the little warrior from Boston, which a Scots  lady at Cape Town long after named \"Bruce\" upon hearing of its prowess  at Echo Mountain. The _Spray_ now reached away for Coffee Island,  which I sighted on my birthday, February 20,1896.    [Illustration: \"Yammerschooner\"]    There she encountered another gale, that brought her in the lee of  great Charles Island for shelter. On a bluff point on Charles were  signal-fires, and a tribe of savages, mustered here since my first  trip through the strait, manned their canoes to put off for the sloop.  It was not prudent to come to, the anchorage being within bow-shot of  the shore, which was thickly wooded; but I made signs that one canoe  might come alongside, while the sloop ranged about under sail in the  lee of the land. The others I motioned to keep off, and incidentally  laid a smart Martini-Henry rifle in sight, close at hand, on the top  of the cabin. In the canoe that came alongside, crying their  never-ending begging word \"yammerschooner,\" were two squaws and one  Indian, the hardest specimens of humanity I had ever seen in any of my  travels. \"Yammerschooner\" was their plaint when they pushed off from  the shore, and \"yammerschooner\" it was when they got alongside. The  squaws beckoned for food, while the Indian, a black-visaged savage,  stood sulkily as if he took no interest at all in the matter, but on  my turning my back for some biscuits and jerked beef for the squaws,  the \"buck\" sprang on deck and confronted me, saying in Spanish jargon  that we had met before. I thought I recognized the tone of his  \"yammerschooner,\" and his full beard identified him as the Black Pedro  whom, it was true, I had met before. \"Where are the rest of the crew?\"  he asked, as he looked uneasily around, expecting hands, maybe, to  come out of the fore-scuttle and deal him his just deserts for many  murders. \"About three weeks ago,\" said he, \"when you passed up here, I  saw three men on board. Where are the other two?\" I answered him  briefly that the same crew was still on board. \"But,\" said he, \"I see  you are doing all the work,\" and with a leer he added, as he glanced  at the mainsail, \"hombre valiente.\" I explained that I did all the  work in the day, while the rest of the crew slept, so that they would  be fresh to watch for Indians at night. I was interested in the subtle  cunning of this savage, knowing him, as I did, better perhaps than he  was aware. Even had I not been advised before I sailed from Sandy  Point, I should have measured him for an arch-villain now. Moreover,  one of the squaws, with that spark of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6322"],[0,"Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equinoctial Regions of America, During the (#16)"],[1,"and the hygrometer being  precisely the same in the air nearest the earth, the peak is  sometimes visible, and at other times invisible, to navigators at  equal distances. It is even probable, that the chance of perceiving  this volcano would not be greater, if the ashy cone, at the summit  of which is the mouth of the crater, were equal, as in Vesuvius, to  a quarter of the total height. These ashes, being pumice-stone  crumbled into dust, do not reflect as much light as the snow of the  Andes; and they cause the mountain, seen from afar, to detach  itself not in a bright, but in a dark hue. The ashes also  contribute, if we may use the expression, to equalize the portions  of aerial light, the variable difference of which renders the  object more or less distinctly visible. Calcareous mountains,  devoid of vegetable earth, summits covered with granitic sand, the  high savannahs of the Cordilleras,* (* Los Pajonales, from paja,  straw. This is the name given to the region of the gramina, which  encircles the zone of the perpetual snows.) which are of a golden  yellow, are undoubtedly distinguished at small distances better  than objects which are seen in a negative manner; but the theory  indicates a certain limit, beyond which these last detach  themselves more distinctly from the azure vault of the sky.    The colossal summits of Quito and Peru, towering above the limit of  the perpetual snows, concentre all the peculiarities which must  render them visible at very small angles. The circular summit of  the peak of Teneriffe is only a hundred toises in diameter.  According to the measures I made at Riobamba, in 1803, the dome of  the Chimborazo, 153 toises below its summit, consequently in a  point which is 1300 toises higher than the peak, is still 673  toises (1312 metres) in breadth. The zone of perpetual snows also  forms a fourth of the height of the mountain; and the base of this  zone, seen on the coast of the Pacific, fills an extent of 3437  toises (6700 metres). But though Chimborazo is two-thirds higher  than the peak, we do not see it, on account of the curve of the  globe, at more than 38 miles and a third farther distant. The  radiant brilliancy of its snows, when, at the port of Guayaquil, at  the close of the rainy season, Chimborazo is discerned on the  horizon, may lead us to suppose, that it must be seen at a very  great distance in the South Sea. Pilots highly worthy of credit  have assured me, that they have seen it from the rock of Muerto, to  the south west of the isle of Puna, at a distance of 47 leagues.  Whenever it has been seen at a greater distance, the observers,  uncertain of their longitude, have not been in a situation to  furnish precise data.    Aerial light, projected on mountains, increases the visibility of  those which are seen positively; its power diminishes, on the  contrary, the visibility of objects which, like the peak of  Teneriffe and that of the Azores, detach themselves in a brown  tint. Bouguer, relying on theoretical considerations, was of  opinion that, according to the constitution of our atmosphere,  mountains seen negatively cannot be perceived at distances  exceeding 35 leagues. It is important here to observe, that these  calculations are contrary to experience. The peak of Teneriffe has  been often seen at the distance of 36, 38, and even at 40 leagues.  Moreover, in the vicinity of the Sandwich Islands, the summit of  Mowna-Roa, at a season when it was without snows, has been seen on  the skirt of the horizon, at the distance of 53 leagues. This is  the most striking example we have hitherto known of the visibility  of a mountain; and it is the more remarkable, that an object seen  negatively furnishes this example.    The volcanoes of Teneriffe, and of the Azores, the Sierra Nevada of  Santa Martha, the peak of Orizaba, the Silla of Caracas, Mowna-Roa,  and Mount St. Elias, insulated in the vast extent of the seas, or  placed on the coasts of continents, serve as sea-marks to direct  the pilot, when he has no means of determining the position of the  vessel by the observation of the stars; everything which has a  relation to the visibility of these natural seamarks, is  interesting to the safety of navigation.      CHAPTER 1.2.    STAY AT TENERIFE.  JOURNEY FROM SANTA CRUZ TO OROTAVA.  EXCURSION TO THE SUMMIT OF THE PEAK OF TEYDE.    From the time of our departure from Graciosa, the horizon continued  so hazy, that, notwithstanding the considerable height of the  mountains of Canary,* (* Isla de la Gran Canaria.) we did not  discover that island till the evening of the 18th of June. It is  the granary of the archipelago of the Fortunate Islands; and, what  is very remarkable in a region situated beyond the limits of the  tropics, we were assured, that in some districts, there are two  wheat harvests in the year; one in February, and the other in June.  Canary has never been visited by a learned mineralogist; yet this  island is so much the more worthy of observation, as the  physiognomy of its mountains, disposed in parallel chains, appeared  to me to differ entirely from that of the summits of Lancerota and  Teneriffe. Nothing is more interesting to the geologist, than to  observe the relations, on the same point of the globe, between  volcanic countries, and those which are primitive or secondary.  When the Canary Islands shall have been examined, in all the parts  which compose the system of these mountains, we shall find that we  have been too precipitate in considering the whole group as raised  by the action of submarine fires.    On the morning of the 19th, we discovered the point of Naga, but  the peak of Teneriffe was still invisible: the land, obscured by a  thick mist, presented forms that were vague and confused. As we  approached the road of Santa Cruz we observed that the mist, driven  by the winds, drew nearer to us. The sea was strongly agitated, as  it most commonly is in those latitudes. We anchored after several  soundings, for the mist was so thick, that we could scarcely  distinguish objects at a few cables' distance; but at the moment we  began to salute the place, the fog was instantly dispelled. The  peak of Teyde appeared in a break above the clouds, and the first  rays of the sun, which had not yet risen on us, illumined the  summit of the volcano.    We hastened to the prow of the vessel to behold the magnificent  spectacle, and at the same instant we saw four English vessels  lying to, and very near our stern. We had passed without being  perceived, and the same mist which had concealed the peak from our  view, had saved us from the risk of being carried back to Europe.  The Pizarro stood in as close as possible to the fort, to be under  its protection. It was on this shore, that, in the landing  attempted by the English two years before our arrival, in July  1797, admiral Nelson had his arm carried off by a cannon-ball.    The situation of the town of Santa Cruz is very similar to that of  La Guayra, the most frequented port of the province of Caraccas.  The heat is excessive in both places, and from the same causes; but  the aspect of Santa Cruz is more gloomy. On a narrow and sandy  beach, houses of dazzling whiteness, with flat roofs, and windows  without glass, are built close against a wall of black  perpendicular rock, devoid of vegetation. A fine mole, built of  freestone, and the public walk planted with poplars, are the only  objects which break the sameness of the landscape. The view of the  peak, as it presents itself above Santa Cruz, is much less  picturesque than that we enjoy from the port of Orotava. There, a  highly cultured and smiling plain presents a pleasing contrast to  the wild aspect of the volcano. From the groups of palm trees and  bananas which line the coast, to the region of the arbutus, the  laurel, and the pine, the volcanic rock is crowned with luxuriant  vegetation. We easily conceive how the inhabitants, even of the  beautiful climates of Greece and Italy, might fancy they recognised  one of the Fortunate Isles in the western part of Teneriffe. The  eastern side, that of Santa Cruz, on the contrary, is every where  stamped with sterility. The summit of the peak is not more arid  than the promontory of basaltic lava, which stretches towards the  point of Naga, and on which succulent plants, springing up in the  clefts of the rocks, scarcely indicate a preparation of soil. At  the port of Orotava, the top of the Piton subtends an angle in  height of more than eleven degrees and a half; while at the mole of  Santa Cruz* (* The oblique distances from the top of the volcano to  Orotava and to Santa Cruz are nearly 8600 toises and 22,500 toises.)  the angle scarcely exceeds 4 degrees 36 minutes.    Notwithstanding this difference, and though in the latter place the  volcano rises above the horizon scarcely as much as Vesuvius seen  from the mole of Naples, the aspect of the peak is still very  majestic, when those who anchor in the road discern it for the  first time. The Piton alone was visible to us; its cone projected  itself on a sky of the purest blue, whilst dark thick clouds  enveloped the rest of the mountain to the height of 1800 toises.  The pumice-stone, illumined by the first rays of the sun, reflected  a reddish light, like that which tinges the summits of the higher  Alps. This light by degrees becomes dazzlingly white; and, deceived  like most travellers, we thought that the peak was still covered  with snow, and that we should with difficulty reach the edge of the  crater.    We have remarked, in the Cordillera of the Andes, that the conical  mountains, such as Cotopaxi and Tungurahua, are oftener seen free  from clouds, than those of which the tops are broken into bristly  points, like Antisana and Pichincha; but the peak of Teneriffe,  notwithstanding its pyramidical form, is a great part of the year  enveloped in vapours, and is sometimes, during several weeks,"]]]
