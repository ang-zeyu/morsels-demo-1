But when the Prophet of the  dispensation of the fulness of times announced his revelation; when  God again stood revealed once more before a witness; when the divine  plan of life and salvation was again communicated to men through an  inspired prophet; when the Church of Christ in all its completeness  and power was restored to the earth, then it behoved Lucifer to look  to his dominions, to strengthen his forces, and to prepare for the  final conflict for possession of this world; for now God had taken  it in hand to complete His work of redeeming the earth, of saving  men, and overthrowing Lucifer and his power so far as this earth is  concerned; and hence when Joseph Smith announced his new revelation,  the incoming of the dispensation of the fulness of times, Lucifer with  all the cunning and power at his command, and setting in motion every  force--the fears and jealousies of men, misrepresentation and calumny,  hatred of righteousness and truth, in a word, every force that he could  summons, every pretext that he could suggest to men of evil disposed  minds was employed to destroy the inauguration of that work which was  to subdue his power, conquer his dominions, and render men free from  his influence. Lucifer's bitterness, then, his hatred, his cunning, his  {LXII} devisements were the cause of the Missouri persecutions. All  else was secondary, pretext, his instrumentalities, nothing more.    _Retribution_.    But what of Missouri? Missouri, who had violated her constitution  which guaranteed religious freedom to all who came within her borders!  Missouri, whose officers from the Governor down entered into a  wicked conspiracy, contrary to all law and righteousness, and drove  the Saints from the state! Missouri, who had violated not only her  own constitution by becoming a party to a religious persecution,  but had also violated the spirit of our times, and outraged the  civilization of the nineteenth century--what of Missouri? Did she  pay any penalty for her wrong-doing? Are states such entities as may  be held to an accounting for breaches of public faith and public  morals--constitutional immoralities? Is there within the state a public  conscience to which an appeal can be made; and in the event of the  public conscience being outraged is there retribution?    I answer these questions in the affirmative; and hold that Missouri  paid dearly for the violations of her guarantees of religious freedom,  and her lawlessness and her cruelties practiced towards the Latter-day  Saints.    I have already referred to the relationship which the state of Missouri  sustained to the great question of slavery. By the political compromise  which bore her name, Missouri became a \"cape of slavery thrust into  free territory.\" Except for the state of Missouri alone, her southern  boundary line was to mark the furthermost point northward beyond which  slavery must not be extended into the territory of the United States.  In 1854, however, the Missouri compromise was practically overthrown by  the introduction into Congress of the \"Kansas-Nebraska Act,\" by Stephen  A. Douglas, United States senator from Illinois. This act provided for  the organization of two new territories from the Louisiana purchase,  west of Missouri and Iowa. The act proposed that the new territories  should be open to slavery, if their inhabitants desired it. This left  the question of slavery in the status it occupied previous to the  Missouri Compromise, and left the people in the prospective states to  determine for themselves whether slavery should or should not prevail  in their state. This opened again the slavery question, and there was  begun that agitation which finally resulted in the great American Civil  War.    As soon as it became apparent that the people of new territories were  to determine for themselves the question of slavery, very naturally  each party began a struggle for possession of the new territory  according as its sentiments or interests dictated. The struggle began  by the {LXIII} abolition party of the north organizing \"Emigrant Aid  Societies,\" and sending emigrants of their own faith into Kansas. The  slave holders of Missouri also sent settlers representing their faith  and interests into the new territory in the hope of bringing it into  the Union as a slave state. This brought on a border warfare in which  the settlements of western Missouri and eastern Kansas alternately  suffered from the raids and counter raids of the respective parties  through some six years before the outbreak of the Civil War. As to  which were the more lawless or cruel, the fanatical abolitionists or  the pro-slavery party, the \"jayhawkers,\" as the organized bands of  ruffians of the former party were called, or the \"bushwhackers,\" as  the similarly organized bands of the pro-slavery men were called, is  not a question necessary for me to discuss here. Both held the laws  in contempt, and vied with each other in committing atrocities. The  western counties of Missouri, where the Latter-day Saints had suffered  so cruelly at the hands of people of those counties some eighteen or  twenty years before, were in this border warfare laid desolate, and all  the hardships the Missourians had inflicted upon the Saints were now  visited upon their heads, only more abundantly.    Speaking of the situation in Missouri in 1861, the out-going Governor,  Robert M. Stewart, in his address to the legislature, and referring to  Missouri and her right to be heard on the slavery question, said:    \"Missouri has a right to speak on this subject, because she has  suffered. Bounded on three sides by free territory, her border  counties have been the frequent scenes of kidnapping and violence,  and this state has probably lost as much, in the last two years, in  the abduction of slaves, as all the rest of the Southern States. _At  this moment several of the western counties are desolated, and almost  depopulated, from fear of a bandit horde, who have been committing  depredations--arson, theft, and foul murder--upon the adjacent border_\"  [56]    Brigadier-General Daniel M. Frost, who had been employed in repressing  lawlessness in the western counties of Missouri, in reporting  conditions prevailing there in November, 1860, said:    \"The deserted and charred remains of once happy homes, combined with  the general terror that prevailed amongst the citizens who still clung  to their possessions, gave but too certain proof of the persecution to  which they had all been subjected, and which they would again have to  endure, with renewed violence, so soon as armed protection should be  withdrawn.\" [note] \"In view of this condition of affairs,\" continues  the historian of Missouri I am quoting, \"and in order to carry out  fully Governor Stewart's order to repel invasions and restore peace to  the border, General Frost determined to leave a considerable force in  {LXIV} the threatened district. Accordingly, a battalion of volunteers,  consisting of three companies of rangers and one of artillery, was  enlisted, and Lieutenant-Colonel John S. Bowen, who afterwards rose to  high rank in the Confederate service, was chosen to the command.\" [57]    \"With the organization of this force, and perhaps owing also, in some  degree, to the inclemency of the season, 'jayhawking,' as such, came to  an end, though the thing itself, during the first two or three years of  the Civil War, and, in fact, as long as there was anything left on the  Missouri side of the border worth taking, flourished more vigorously  than ever. The old jayhawking leaders, however, now came with United  States commissions in their pockets and at the head of regularly  enlisted troops, in which guise they carried on a system of robbery and  murder that left a good portion of the frontier south of the Missouri  river as perfect a waste as Germany was at the end of the Thirty Years'  War.\" [58]    While this description confines the scenes of violence and rapine to  the border counties south of the Missouri river,--it included Jackson  county, however, which was one of the heaviest sufferers both in  this border warfare and subsequently during the Civil War--still,  the counties north of that stream also suffered from lawlessness and  violence.    At the outbreak of the Civil War Missouri was peculiarly situated. She  was surrounded on three sides by free states. The great majority of  her own people were for the Union, but her government, with Clairborne  Jackson as the state executive, was in sympathy with the South. As  the extreme Southern States one after another seceded from the Union,  Missouri was confronted with the question: What position she ought to  assume in the impending conflict. The question was referred to a state  convention in which appeared no secessionists. Indeed, the people of  Missouri in this election by a majority of eighty thousand decided  against secession. The convention, in setting forth the attitude of the  state on the subject, said that Missouri's position was, \"Evidently  that of a state whose interests are bound up in the maintenance of  the Union, and whose kind feelings and strong sympathies are with the  people of the Southern States, with whom we are connected by ties of  friendship and blood. We want the peace and harmony of the country  restored, and we want them with us. To go with them as they are now * *  * * is to ruin ourselves without doing them any good.\" [59]    While this doubtless voiced the sentiment of a great majority of {LXV}  Missouri's people, the government of the state and many thousands  of its inhabitants sympathized with the South. The general assembly  of the state authorized the raising and equipment of large military  forces held subject, of course, to the orders of the governor, under  the pretense of being prepared to repel invasion from any quarter  whatsoever, and enable"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47708"],[0,"Biography and Family Record of Lorenzo Snow (#16)"],[1,"our joys are turned to sorrow, our pleasures  into pain. Death has entered this part of Zion's fold, and taken one of  her best and most worthy daughters.    This morning, our beloved sister, Elizabeth Morgan, after a short  illness, bid adieu to her weeping husband, children and friends, and  took her departure to the fair climes of Immortality. She was beloved  by all the Saints, and much respected throughout the extensive circle  of her worldly acquaintance.    By her faith and knowledge, the curtains of Zion have been extended,  and through her benevolence the Saints have been made to rejoice. With  herself and husband, our Elders first found a home when they were  strangers in London, endeavoring to rear the standard of Zion. Their  house has been my home ever since my arrival.    The Church has cause to mourn her loss, especially those who  participated in her friendship when laying the foundation of this  branch, when dark clouds gathered thickly over their prospects, and  all their efforts seemed baffled. But let them not mourn as for one  who dies without hope. She died, not only in hope, but in the perfect  assurance of future glory; and in her dying moments, wished me to  express to Elder Kimball that she blessed the hour in which he baptized  her.    One remarkable circumstance connected with this melancholy event, I  wish to relate. About two o'clock this morning, we had given up all  hopes of her recovery. We saw it was the will of God to take her to  Himself. We had continued to offer our prayers in her behalf, and  done everything consistent with scripture and the mind of God. She  continually expressed a wish that no medicine should be administered  to her by a doctor, and particularly requested that \"_no blame should  be attached to, and no reflections cast upon, her dear husband and  children, because no doctor had been employed; for she wanted no  physician but the Lord_.\"    About two o'clock, she requested me to kneel by her bedside, and, for  the last time, offer my supplications, and she said she would depart in  peace. I complied with her request, and while calling upon the Lord in  presence of her weeping husband, children and friends, the Holy Spirit  rested on me in power, and I was moved upon to ask the God of Israel  that her disconsolate husband might be comforted, even if it were by  the ministering of Sister Morgan's departed spirit, that he might have  thereby consolation and fulness of hope.    At the same hour, Sister Bates, of this city--a worthy member of the  Church, had an _open vision_, in which she saw Sister Morgan standing  in full view before her, clothed in robes beautiful and white, and  around her head were clouds of glory, surpassing in splendor and  brilliancy, the sun at noonday. Sister Bates rejoiced in the vision. It  was not a dream, but an _open vision_, continuing some length of time.  When the vision closed, she immediately related it to her husband.    When the vision was made known to Deacon Morgan, the bereaved husband,  he lifted up his head and _rejoiced in sorrow,_ receiving consolation  even in the valley of grief. He has not a shadow of doubt that the  companion of his bosom now rests in mansions of peace and glory.    Yours in the Everlasting Covenant,    L. Snow.    In the minutes of a general Conference held in Manchester, commencing  on the 5th of May, 1842, published in the _Millennial Star_, we find  the following:    \"Elder Snow then addressed the meeting, and stated the method they  had adopted in London Conference of raising funds for the Temple,  which was by holding tea meetings; at which time any person wishing to  appropriate for this purpose, had the opportunity. Elder Snow concluded  his address by singing beautifully in tongues.\"    Just before leaving England, Elder P. P. Pratt, through the _Star_, in  a general address to the Saints in Europe, writes the following--\"I  therefore recommend and appoint Elder Thomas Ward as my successor  in the office of the General Presidency of the Church in Europe, in  connection with Elders Lorenzo Snow and Hiram Clark. To these persons  I commit the care and government of the Church in this country for the  present, trusting that they will conduct and counsel in all things  according to the mind of the Spirit, and according to the counsel that  shall be given them from Nauvoo from time to time by the Quorum of the  Twelve or the First Presidency.    \"I sincerely hope that the officers and members in the several  conferences will uphold and support these men in their high and holy  calling by the prayer of faith, and by a willing, submissive and  teachable spirit; and in so doing they will prosper.\"    STANZA ON THE PRESENTATION OF THE BOOK OF MORMON TO QUEEN VICTORIA.    BY ELIZA R. SNOW.    Before leaving London, Elder Lorenzo Snow presented to Her Majesty,  Queen Victoria, and His Royal Highness, Prince Albert, through the  politeness of Sir Henry Wheatley, two neatly bound copies of the Book  of Mormon, which had been donated by President Brigham Young, and  left in the care of Elder Snow for that purpose; which circumstance  suggested the following lines:      QUEEN VICTORIA.      Of all the monarchs of the earth,    That wear the robes of royalty,    She has inherited, by birth,    The broadest wreath of majesty.      From her wide territorial wing,    The sun does not withdraw its light;    While earth's diurnal motions bring    To other nations, day and night.      All earthly thrones are tottering things,    Where lights and shadows intervene;    And regal honor often brings    The scaffold or the guillotine.      But still her sceptre is approved;    All nations deck the wreath she wears;    Yet, like the youth whom Jesus loved,    One thing is lacking, even there.      But, lo! a prize possessing more    Of worth than gems with honor rife--    A herald of salvation bore    To her the words of endless life.      That gift, however fools deride,    Is worthy of her royal care;    She'd better lay her crown aside    Than spurn the light reflected there.      O would she now her influence bend--    The influence of royalty,    Messiah's Kingdom to extend,    And Zion's \"nursing mother\" be:      Thus, with the glory of her name    Inscribed on Zion's lofty spire,    She'd win a wreath of endless fame,    To last when other wreaths expire.      Though over millions called to reign--    Herself a powerful nation's boast,    'Twould be her everlasting gain    To serve the King, the Lord of Hosts.      For there are crowns and thrones on high,    And kingdoms there to be conferred--    There honors wait that never die--    There fame's immortal trump is heard.      Truth echoes--'tis Jehovah's word;    Let kings and queens and princes hear:    In distant isles the sound is heard:    Ye heavens, rejoice! O earth, give ear!      The time--the time is near at hand    To give a glorious period birth:    The Son of God will take command,    And rule the nations of the earth.        CHAPTER XII.    Brother Snow's Mission terminates.--Reports four hundred Members in  the London Conference.--Is appointed to take charge of two hundred and  fifty Saints _en route_ to Nauvoo.--Embarks on the \"Swanton.\"--The  Steward's sickness.--Grows worse and worse.--Is given up, and nearly  dead.--Sister Martin insists with the Captain.--Is repulsed, and again  asks that Elder Snow may administer to the Steward.--She obtains  consent.--The man is healed.--Baptisms in New Orleans.--The Company  reaches Nauvoo.--Great Reception.--Waving of Handkerchiefs.--The  Prophet present.--Reminiscences.--My joy in meeting Lorenzo.--How we  associated.--Appeal to my Husband.--Their Interview.--The Result.    In April, 1842, at the Conference in Manchester, President P. P. Pratt  presiding, Lorenzo Snow represented the London Conference, consisting  of four hundred members, fourteen Elders, thirty-two Priests, seven  Teachers, eight Deacons, including ten branches. During his presidency  he visited and preached to congregations in many places, bearing  testimony to the truths of the Gospel of the Son of God, having, at  the time of embarking for his native country, traveled in England four  thousand miles.    At the close of his mission, he was appointed to take charge of a  company of Saints, consisting of about two hundred and fifty souls,  _en route_ for Nauvoo; and in January, 1843, embarked on the ship  \"Swanton.\" The commander, Captain Davenport, and officers of the crew  were kind and courteous, which contributed much to ameliorate the  discomfort incident to life on the ocean.    The steward, a German by birth, was a young man, very affable in  manner, and gentlemanly in deportment--a general favorite and highly  respected by all. During the latter part of the voyage he took sick,  and continued growing worse and worse, until death seemed inevitable.  All means proved unavailing, and the captain, by whom he was much  beloved, gave up all hope of his recovery, and requested the officers  and crew to go in, one by one, and take a farewell look of their dying  friend, which they did silently and solemnly, as he lay unconscious and  almost breathless on his dying couch.    Immediately after this sad ceremony closed, one of our sisters, by the  name of Martin, without my brother's knowledge, went to the captain  and requested him to allow my brother to lay hands on the steward,  according to our faith and practice under such circumstances, saying  that she believed that the steward would be restored. The captain shook  his head, and told her that the steward was now breathing his last, and  it would be useless to trouble Mr. Snow. But Sister Martin was not to  be defeated; she not only importuned, but earnestly declared her faith  in the result of the proposed administration, and he finally yielded  and gave consent.    As soon as the foregoing circumstance was communicated to my brother,  he started toward the cabin"]]]
