What means that  nervous pressing of the hand against the heart, the gulping back of the  lump that rises in the throat, the forced smile, and the pressed-back  tear? If we could but speak to the husbands who haunt these homes, we  would tell them that some such soliloquy as the following is ever  passing like a laboured breath through the distracted minds of their  wives: \"Is this the Canaan, this the land of promise, this the milk and  honey that were pictured to my fancy; when the walks among the lanes,  and fields, and flowers were all too short, and the whispers were so  loving, and the pressure was so fond, and the heart-beat was so  passionate? For what have I surrendered home, youth, beauty, freedom,  love--all that a woman has to give in all her wealth of confidence?  Harsh tones, cold looks, stern words, short answers, sullen reserve.\"  \"What,\" says the cheery neighbour, \"is that all?\" All! What more is  needed to make home dark, to poison hope, to turn life into a funeral,  the marriage-robe into a shroud, and the grave into a refuge? It does  not want drunkenness, blows, bruises, clenched fists, oaths, to work  sacrilege in the temple of the home; only a little ice where the fire  should glow; only a cold look where the love should burn; only a sneer  where there ought to be a smile. Husband! that wife of yours is wretched  because you are a liar; because you perjured yourself when you vowed to  love and cherish. You are too great a coward to beat her brains out with  a poker lest the gallows claim you; but you are so little of a man that  you poison her soul with the slow cruelty of an oath daily foresworn and  brutally ignored. If the ducking-stool was a punishment of old for a  scolding wife, a fiercer baptism should await the husband who has ceased  to cherish his wife.    As regards the vow of fidelity we need only quote these words of the  prophet Malachi: \"The Lord hath been witness between thee and the wife  of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt treacherously: yet she is thy  companion, and the wife of thy covenant. And did not he make one?  Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously  against the wife of his youth.\" But there are absentee husbands and  wives who, though they are not guilty of breaking the seventh  commandment, do by no means keep the promise of keeping only to their  wives and husbands. If a man come home only when other places are shut,  or when his money is all gone, or when nobody else wants him, is he not  telling his wife and family, as plainly by deeds as he could possibly by  words, that he takes more delight in other company than in theirs?  Charles Lamb used to feel that there was something of dishonesty in any  pleasures which he took without his lunatic sister. A good man will  feel something like this in reference to his wife and children.    But though men should love their homes, it is quite possible for them to  be too much at home. This at least is the opinion of most wives. There  is everywhere a disposition to pack off the men in the morning and to  bid them keep out of the way till towards evening, when it is assumed  they will probably have a little news of the busy world to bring home,  and when baby will be sure to have said something exceptionally  brilliant and precocious. The general events of the day will afford  topics of conversation more interesting by far than if the whole  household had been together from morning till night. Men about home all  day are fidgety, grumpy, and interfering--altogether objectionable, in  short.    As a rule it is when things are going wrong that women show to the best  advantage. Every one can remember illustrations. We have one in the  following story of Hawthorne, which was told to Mr. Conway by an  intimate friend of the novelist. One wintry day Hawthorne received at  his office notification that his services would no longer be required.  With heaviness of heart he repaired to his humble home. His young wife  recognizes the change and stands waiting for the silence to be broken.  At length he falters, \"I am removed from office.\" Then she leaves the  room; she returns with fuel and kindles a bright fire with her own  hands; next she brings pen, paper, ink, and sets them beside him. Then  she touches the sad man on the shoulder, and, as he turns to the beaming  face, says, \"Now you can write your book.\" The cloud cleared away. The  lost office looked like a cage from which he had escaped. \"The Scarlet  Letter\" was written, and a marvellous success rewarded the author and  his stout-hearted wife.    The care some wives take of their husbands in sickness is very touching.  John Richard Green, the historian, whose death seemed so untimely, is an  instance of this. His very life was prolonged in the most wonderful way  by the care and skill with which he was tended; and it was with and  through his wife that the work was done which he could not have done  alone. She consulted the authorities for him, examined into obscure  points, and wrote to his dictation. In this way, when he could not work  more than two hours in the day, and when often some slight change in the  weather would throw him back and make work impossible for days or weeks,  the book was prepared which he published under the title of \"The Making  of England.\"    The husband's vow to \"comfort\" was never better performed than by  Cobbett. In his \"Advice to Young Men\" he says: \"I began my young  marriage days in and near Philadelphia. At one of those times to which I  have just alluded, in the middle of the burning hot month of July, I was  greatly afraid of fatal consequences to my wife for want of sleep, she  not having, after the great danger was over, had any sleep for more than  forty-eight hours. All great cities in hot countries are, I believe,  full of dogs, and they, in the very hot weather, keep up during the  night a horrible barking and fighting and howling. Upon the particular  occasion to which I am adverting they made a noise so terrible and so  unremitted that it was next to impossible that even a person in full  health and free from pain should obtain a minute's sleep. I was, about  nine in the evening, sitting by the bed. 'I do think,' said she, 'that  I could go to sleep _now_, if it were not _for the dogs_.' Downstairs I  went, and out I sallied, in my shirt and trousers, and without shoes and  stockings; and, going to a heap of stones lying beside the road, set to  work upon the dogs, going backward and forward, and keeping them at two  or three hundred yards' distance from the house. I walked thus the whole  night, barefooted, lest the noise of my shoes might possibly reach her  ears; and I remember that the bricks of the causeway were, even in the  night, so hot as to be disagreeable to my feet. My exertions produced  the desired effect: a sleep of several hours was the consequence, and,  at eight o'clock in the morning, off went I to a day's business which  was to end at six in the evening.    \"Women are all patriots of the soil; and when her neighbours used to ask  my wife whether _all_ English husbands were like hers, she boldly  answered in the affirmative. I had business to occupy the whole of my  time, Sundays and week-days, except sleeping hours; but I used to make  time to assist her in the taking care of her baby, and in all sorts of  things: get up, light her fire, boil her tea-kettle, carry her up warm  water in cold weather, take the child while she dressed herself and got  the breakfast ready, then breakfast, get her in water and wood for the  day, then dress myself neatly and sally forth to my business. The moment  that was over I used to hasten back to her again; and I no more thought  of spending a moment _away from her_, unless business compelled me, than  I thought of quitting the country and going to sea. The _thunder_ and  _lightning_ are tremendous in America compared with what they are in  England. My wife was at one time very much afraid of thunder and  lightning; and, as is the feeling of all such women, and indeed all men  too, she wanted company, and particularly her husband, in those times of  danger. I knew well of course that my presence would not diminish the  danger; but, be I at what I might, if within reach of home, I used to  quit my business and hasten to her the moment I perceived a thunderstorm  approaching. Scores of miles have I, first and last, _run_ on this  errand in the streets of Philadelphia! The Frenchmen who were my  scholars used to laugh at me exceedingly on this account; and sometimes,  when I was making an appointment with them, they would say, with a smile  and a bow, '_Sauve le tonnerre toujours, Monsieur Cobbett!_'\"    Much is said both wise and otherwise in reference to the obedience which  a wife vows to yield to her husband. One who wrote a sketch of the Rev.  F. D. Maurice tells us that he met him once at a wedding breakfast.  Maurice proposed the health of the bride and bridegroom. The lady turned  round, and in rather bad taste exclaimed, \"Now, Mr. Maurice, I call you  to witness that I entertain no intention of obeying.\" Maurice answered  with his sad, sweet smile, \"Ah, madam, you little know the blessedness  of obedience.\"    Of course no one believes that it is a wife's duty to obey when her  husband wishes her to act contrary to the dictates of conscience. As  little is she expected to conform to a standard of obedience and service  such as was laid down in a conversation overheard between two children  who were playing on the sands together. Small boy to little girl: \"Do  you wish to be my wife?\" Little girl, after reflection; \"Yes.\" Small  boy: \"Then pull off my boots.\" We all rejoice in the fact that woman's  rights are very different now from what they used to be, at least in  Russia, where, Dr. Lansdell tells us, anciently at a wedding the  bridegroom took to church a whip,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35545"],[0,"Sanders of the River (#16)"],[1,"ater-gauge  had been put in by Yoka, the engineer, as he had ordered; the engines  had been cleaned; and Sanders nodded approvingly. He stepped lightly  over two or three sleeping forms curled up on the deck, and gained the  shore. \"Now I think I'll turn in,\" he muttered, and looked at his watch.  It was nine o'clock. He stood for a moment on the crest of the steep  bank, and stared back across the river. The night was black, but he saw  the outlines of the forest on the other side. He saw the jewelled sky,  and the pale reflection of stars in the water. Then he went to his tent,  and leisurely got into his pyjamas. He jerked two tabloids from a tiny  bottle, swallowed them, drank a glass of water, and thrust his head  through the tent opening. \"Ho, Sokani!\" he called, speaking in the  vernacular, \"let the _lo-koli_ sound!\"    He went to bed.    He heard the rustle of men moving, the gurgles of laughter as his subtle  joke was repeated, for the Cambul people have a keen sense of humour,  and then the penetrating rattle of sticks on the native drum--a hollow  tree-trunk. Fiercely it beat--furiously, breathlessly, with now and then  a deeper note as the drummer, using all his art, sent the message of  sleep to the camp.    In one wild crescendo, the _lo-koli_ ceased, and Sanders turned with a  sigh of content and closed his eyes--he sat up suddenly. He must have  dozed; but he was wide awake now.    He listened, then slipped out of bed, pulling on his mosquito boots.  Into the darkness of the night he stepped, and found N'Kema, the  engineer, waiting.    \"You heard, master?\" said the native.    \"I heard,\" said Sanders, with a puzzled face, \"yet we are nowhere near a  village.\"    He listened.    From the night came a hundred whispering noises, but above all these,  unmistakable, the faint clatter of an answering drum. The white man  frowned in his perplexity. \"No village is nearer than the Bongindanga,\"  he muttered, \"not even a fishing village; the woods are deserted----\"    The native held up a warning finger, and bent his head, listening. He  was reading the message that the drum sent. Sanders waited; he knew the  wonderful fact of this native telegraph, how it sent news through the  trackless wilds. He could not understand it, no European could; but he  had respect for its mystery.    \"A white man is here,\" read the native; \"he has the sickness.\"    \"A white man!\"    In the darkness Sanders' eyebrows rose incredulously.    \"He is a foolish one,\" N'Kema read; \"he sits in the Forest of Happy  Thoughts, and will not move.\"    Sanders clicked his lips impatiently. \"No white man would sit in the  Forest of Happy Thoughts,\" he said, half to himself, \"unless he were  mad.\"    But the distant drum monotonously repeated the outrageous news. Here,  indeed, in the heart of the loveliest glade in all Africa, encamped in  the very centre of the Green Path of Death, was a white man, a sick  white man--in the Forest of Happy Thoughts--a sick white man.    So the drum went on and on, till Sanders, rousing his own _lo-koli_ man,  sent an answer crashing along the river, and began to dress hurriedly.    In the forest lay a very sick man. He had chosen the site for the camp  himself. It was in a clearing, near a little creek that wound between  high elephant-grass to the river. Mainward chose it, just before the  sickness came, because it was pretty. This was altogether an inadequate  reason; but Mainward was a sentimentalist, and his life was a long  record of choosing pretty camping places, irrespective of danger. \"He  was,\" said a newspaper, commenting on the crowning disaster which sent  him a fugitive from justice to the wild lands of Africa, \"over-burdened  with imagination.\" Mainward was cursed with ill-timed confidence; this  was one of the reasons he chose to linger in that deadly strip of land  of the Ituri, which is clumsily named by the natives \"The  Lands-where-all-bad-thoughts-become-good-thoughts\" and poetically  adapted by explorers and daring traders as \"The Forest of Happy Dreams.\"  Over-confidence had generally been Mainward's undoing--over-confidence  in the ability of his horses to win races; over-confidence in his own  ability to secure money to hide his defalcations--he was a director in  the Welshire County Bank once--over-confidence in securing the love of a  woman, who, when the crash came, looked at him blankly and said she was  sorry, but she had no idea he felt towards her like that----    Now Mainward lifted his aching head from the pillow and cursed aloud at  the din. He was endowed with the smattering of pigeon-English which a  man may acquire from a three months' sojourn divided between Sierra  Leone and Grand Bassam.    \"Why for they make 'em cursed noise, eh?\" he fretted. \"You plenty  fool-man, Abiboo.\"    \"Si, senor,\" agreed the Kano boy, calmly.    \"Stop it, d'ye hear? stop it!\" raved the man on the tumbled bed; \"this  noise is driving me mad--tell them to stop the drum.\"    The _lo-koli_ stopped of its own accord, for the listeners in the sick  man's camp had heard the faint answer from Sanders.    \"Come here, Abiboo--I want some milk; open a fresh tin; and tell the  cook I want some soup, too.\"    The servant left him muttering and tossing from side to side on the  creaking camp bedstead. Mainward had many strange things to think about.  It was strange how they all clamoured for immediate attention; strange  how they elbowed and fought one another in their noisy claims to his  notice. Of course, there was the bankruptcy and the discovery at the  bank--it was very decent of that inspector fellow to clear out--and  Ethel, and the horses, and--and----    The Valley of Happy Dreams! That would make a good story if Mainward  could write; only, unfortunately, he could not write. He could sign  things, sign his name \"three months after date pay to the order of----\"  He could sign other people's names; he groaned, and winced at the  thought.    But here was a forest where bad thoughts became good, and, God knows,  his mind was ill-furnished. He wanted peace and sleep and happiness--he  greatly desired happiness. Now suppose \"Fairy Lane\" had won the  Wokingham Stakes? It had not, of course (he winced again at the bad  memory), but suppose it had? Suppose he could have found a friend who  would have lent him 16,000, or even if Ethel----    \"Master,\" said Abiboo's voice, \"dem puck-a-puck, him lib for come.\"    \"Eh, what's that?\"    Mainward turned almost savagely on the man.    \"Puck-a-puck--you hear'um?\"    But the sick man could not hear the smack of the _Zaire_'s stern wheel,  as the little boat breasted the downward rush of the river--he was  surprised to see that it was dawn, and grudgingly admitted to himself  that he had slept. He closed his eyes again and had a strange dream. The  principal figure was a small, tanned, clean-shaven man in a white  helmet, who wore a dingy yellow overcoat over his pyjamas.    \"How are you feeling?\" said the stranger.    \"Rotten bad,\" growled Mainward, \"especially about Ethel; don't you think  it was pretty low down of her to lead me on to believe she was awfully  fond of me, and then at the last minute to chuck me?\"    \"Shocking,\" said the strange, white man gravely, \"but put her out of  your mind just now; she isn't worth troubling about. What do you say to  this?\"    He held up a small, greenish pellet between his forefinger and thumb,  and Mainward laughed weakly.    \"Oh, rot!\" he chuckled faintly. \"You're one of those Forest of Happy  Dreams Johnnies; what's that? A love philtre?\" He was hysterically  amused at the witticism.    Sanders nodded.    \"Love or life, it's all one,\" he said, but apparently unamused. \"Swallow  it!\"    Mainward giggled and obeyed.    \"And now,\" said the stranger--this was six hours later--\"the best thing  you can do is to let my boys put you on my steamer and take you down  river.\"    Mainward shook his head. He had awakened irritable and lamentably weak.    \"My dear chap, it's awfully kind of you to have come--by the way, I  suppose you _are_ a doctor?\"    Sanders shook his head.    \"On the contrary, I am the Commissioner of this district,\" he said  flippantly--\"but you were saying----\"    \"I want to stay here--it's devilish pretty.\"    \"Devilish is the very adjective I should have used--my dear man, this is  the plague spot of the Congo; it's the home of every death-dealing fly  and bug in Africa.\"    He waved his hand to the hidden vistas of fresh green glades, of  gorgeous creepers shown in the light of the camp fires.    \"Look at the grass,\" he said; \"it's homeland grass--that's the seductive  part of it; I nearly camped here myself. Come, my friend, let me take  you to my camp.\"    Mainward shook his head obstinately.    \"I'm obliged, but I'll stay here for a day or so. I want to try the  supernatural effects of this pleasant place,\" he said with a weary  smile. \"I've got so many thoughts that need treatment.\"    \"Look here,\" said Sanders roughly, \"you know jolly well how this forest  got its name; it is called Happy Dreams because it's impregnated with  fever, and with every disease from beri-beri to sleeping sickness. You  don't wake from the dreams you dream here. Man, I know this country, and  you're a newcomer; you've trekked here because you wanted to get away  from life and start all over again.\"    \"I beg your pardon.\" Mainward's face flushed; and he spoke a little  stiffly.    \"Oh, I know all about you--didn't I tell you I was the Commissioner? I  was in England when things were going rocky with you, and I've read the  rest in the papers I get from time to time. But all that is nothing to  me. I'm here to help you start fair. If you had wanted to commit  suicide, why come to Africa to do it? Be sensible and shift your camp;  I'll send my steamer back for your men. Will you come?\"    \"No,\" said Mainward sulkily. \"I don't want to, I'm not keen; besides,  I'm not fit to travel.\"    Here was an argument which Sanders"]]]
