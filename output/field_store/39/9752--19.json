O my God, shut up the vision! for my heart sickens while I gaze; and  let the day hasten on when the earth shall be cleansed by fire from  such awful pollutions; but first, let Thy promise be fulfilled, which  Thou didst make by the mouth of Thy servant John, that Thou wouldst  call Thy people out of her, saying: \"Come out of her, my people, that  ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her  plagues;\" and then, O Lord, when Thou hast called Thy people out from  the midst of her, by the fishers and hunters whom Thou hast promised  to send in the last days to gather Israel; yea, when Thine everlasting  covenant has been renewed, and Thy people established thereby; then  let her plagues come in one day, death, mourning, and famine; let her  be burned with fire; that the holy Apostles and Prophets, and all that  fear Thy name, small and great, may rejoice, because Thou hast avenged  the blood of Thy saints upon her. I ask these things in the name of  Jesus Christ. Amen.          CHAPTER IV.    THE BOOK OF MORMON--ORIGIN OF THE AMERICAN INDIANS, ETC.          Ye gloomy scenes, far hence, intrude no more!      Sublimer themes invite the muse to soar      In loftier strains, while scenes both strange and new      Burst on the sight, and open to the view.        Lo! from the opening heavens, in bright array      An angel comes--to earth he bends his way:      Reveals to man, in power, as at the first,      The fulness of the Gospel long since lost.        See earth, obedient, from its bosom yield      The sacred truth it faithfully concealed.      The wise, confounded, startle at the sight,      The proud and haughty tremble with affright.        The hireling priests against the truth engage,      While hell beneath stands trembling, filled with rage;      False are their hopes, and all their struggles vain;      Their craft must fall, and with it all their gain;      The deaf must hear, the meek their joy increase;      The poor be glad, and their oppression cease.    While darkness covered the earth, and gross darkness the people, every  man walking in his own way, and looking for gain from his quarter, the  Lord having for a long time held His peace, and the people having  fondly flattered themselves that the voice of inspiration would never  again sound in the ears of mortals, to disturb or molest them in their  sinful career; while a few were looking for the consolation of Israel,  and crying to God for the ushering in of that long-expected day, when  an angel should fly through the midst of heaven, having the  everlasting Gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth--  suddenly, a voice is heard from the wilderness, a cry salutes the ears  of mortals, a testimony is heard among them, piercing to the inmost  recesses of their hearts, when all at once the heathen begin to rage,  and the people to imagine a vain thing; the clergy lift a warning  voice, crying impostor, false prophets, beware of delusion, etc.;  while the professor of religion, the drunkard, the swearer, the  learned, and the ignorant soon catch the sound and reiterate it again  and again. Thus it re-echoes from one end of our country to the other,  for a long time, and if any one should be so fortunate as to retain  his sober senses, and should candidly inquire, \"What is the matter?\"  the reply is: \"We hardly know anything about it, but suffice it to  say, some fellows have made their appearance, Paul like, who testify  something about the ministering of angels, or some revelation or  inspiration, just as though the religion of ancient days, and the  faith once delivered to the saints, were returning to the earth in  this enlightened age; so that not only this our craft is in danger,  but our modern systems of religion, built upon the wisdom and learning  of men, without direct inspiration, are like to be spoken against, and  their great magnificence despised, though worshiped by all the world.\"  And then all again cry with a loud voice, saying: \"Great is the wisdom  of man; great are the systems of modern divinity; great is the wisdom  of uninspired priests, who come unto us with excellency of speech, and  with man's wisdom, determined to know nothing among us save opinions  and creeds of their own; and their speech, and their preaching, are  with enticing words of man's wisdom, not in demonstration of the  Spirit, and of power, for that is done away, that our faith should not  stand in the power of God, but in the wisdom of man.\"    In the midst of the noise and clamor, and prejudice of an opposing  world, it is difficult to get the people to understand the facts of  the case, in relation to one of the most important subjects ever  presented to the consideration of mankind.    The Book of Mormon has perhaps been less understood, and more  misrepresented, by the world at large, than any other publication  which has ever appeared.    America and England have, as it were, been flooded with publications  against the said book; and many of them written by those who had never  seen the book, or by those who had only read a page or two in it, or  slightly looked it through with a biased mind, and a determination  to find fault. By some of these it has been represented as a romance;  by others, as a new Bible, calculated to displace the Bible, or do  away with it. Some have pronounced it a \"silly mess of stuff,\" not  worth the perusal; and others, the most ingenious literary work ever  put together. Some have found fault with it for being so much like the  Bible, and agreeing with it; and others have condemned it for not  being sufficiently like the Bible, and for disagreeing with it. Some  have denounced it as notoriously corrupt, immoral, and blasphemous in  its principles; and others have condemned it for being so exceedingly  pure and moral in its principles, as to be just calculated to deceive.  One clergyman, in particular, in a tract of sixty pages on this book,  condemns it for being \"a strange mixture of _faith_ and _works_, of  the _mercy_ of God and the obedience of the _creature_.\" Some literary  persons have pronounced it as altogether _ancient_ in its _style_,  _language_, and _subjects_, and as bearing great internal evidence of  its own antiquity; while others have condemned it, as bearing every  mark of being a modern production. Some have said that there were no  definite predictions of the future contained in it, by the fulfilment  or failure of which its prophetic merits might be tested; and others  have quoted largely from its most plain and pointed predictions, which  relate to circumstances about to be fulfilled, and have condemned it  on account of its plainness.    In the midst of all these jarring statements, it now becomes our duty  to show, as far as possible, what the Book of Mormon really is.    When the Lord confounded the languages at Babel, he led forth a colony  from thence to the Western Continent, which is now called America.  This colony, after crossing the ocean in eight vessels, and landing in  that country, became, in process of time, a great nation--they  inhabited America for some fifteen hundred years. They were at length  destroyed for their wickedness, about six hundred years before Christ.  A prophet by the name of Ether wrote their history, and an account of  their destruction.    Ether lived to witness their entire destruction, and deposited his  record where it was afterwards found by a colony of Israelites, who  came from Jerusalem six hundred years before Christ, and re-peopled  America. This last colony were the descendants of the tribe of Joseph;  they grew and multiplied, and finally gave rise to two mighty nations.  One of these nations was called Nephites--one Nephi being their  founder; the other was called Lamanites, after a leader of the name  Laman.    The Lamanites became a dark and benighted people, of whom the American  Indians are still a remnant. The Nephites were an enlightened and  civilized people, they were a people highly favored of the Lord, they  had visions, angels, and the gift of prophecy among them from age to  age; and finally, they were blessed with a personal appearance of  Jesus Christ after his resurrection, from whose mouth they received  the doctrine of the Gospel, and a knowledge of the future down through  all succeeding ages. But after all the blessings and privileges  conferred upon them, they fell into great wickedness in the third and  fourth centuries of the Christian era, and finally were destroyed by  the hands of the Lamanites. This destruction took place about four  hundred years after Christ.    Mormon lived in that age of the world, and was a Nephite, and a  Prophet of the Lord. He, by the commandment of the Lord, made an  abridgment of the sacred records, which contained the history of his  forefathers, and the Prophecies and Gospel which had been revealed  among them; to which he added a sketch of the history of his own time,  and the destruction of his nation. Previous to his death, the abridged  records fell into the hands of his son Moroni, who continued them down  to A. D. 420; at which time he deposited them carefully in the earth,  on a hill which was then called Cumorah, but is situated in Ontario  County, township of Manchester, and State of New York, North America.  This he did in order to preserve them from the Lamanites, who overran  the country, and sought to destroy them and all the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3567"],[0,"Memoirs of Napoleon Bonaparte — Complete (#16)"],[1,"him in gaining the objects of  his ambition. His constantly-increasing influence with her had already  brought him into contact with the most influential persons of that  epoch. He remained in Paris only ten days after his marriage, which took  place on the 9th of March 1796. It was a union in which great harmony  prevailed, notwithstanding occasional slight disagreements. Bonaparte  never, to my knowledge, caused annoyance to his wife. Madame Bonaparte  possessed personal graces and many good qualities.         --[\"Eugène was not more than fourteen years of age when he ventured     to introduce himself to General Bonaparte, for the purpose of     soliciting his father's sword, of which he understood the General     had become possessed. The countenance, air, and frank manner of     Eugène pleased Bonaparte, and he immediately granted him the boon he     sought. As soon as the sword was placed in the boy's hands he     burst into tears, and kissed it. This feeling of affection for his     father's memory, and the natural manner in which it was evinced,     increased the interest of Bonaparte in his young visitor. Madame de     Beauharnais, on learning the kind reception which the General had     given her son, thought it her duty to call and thank him. Bonaparte     was much pleased with Josephine on this first interview, and he     returned her visit. The acquaintance thus commenced speedily led to     their marriage.\"--Constant]--       --[Bonaparte himself, at St. Helena, says that he first met     Josephine at Barras' (see Iung's Bonaparte, tome iii. p. 116).]--       --[\"Neither of his wives had ever anything to complain of from     Napoleon's personal manners\" (Metternich, vol. 1 p. 279).]--       --[Madame de Rémusat, who, to paraphrase Thiers' saying on     Bourrienne himself, is a trustworthy witness, for if she received     benefits from Napoleon they did not weigh on her, says, \"However,     Napoleon had some affection for his first wife; and, in fact, if he     has at any time been touched, no doubt it has been only for her and     by her\" (tome i. p. 113). \"Bonaparte was young when he first knew     Madame de Beauharnais. In the circle where he met her she had a     great superiority by the name she bore and by the extreme elegance     of her manners. . . . In marrying Madame de Beauharnais,     Bonaparte believed he was allying himself to a very grand lady; thus     this was one more conquest\" (p. 114). But in speaking of     Josephine's complaints to Napoleon of his love affairs, Madame de     Rémusat says, \"Her husband sometimes answered by violences, the     excesses of which I do not dare to detail, until the moment when,     his new fancy having suddenly passed, he felt his tenderness for his     wife again renewed. Then he was touched by her sufferings, replaced     his insults by caresses which were hardly more measured than his     violences and, as she was gentle and untenacious, she fell back into     her feeling of security\" (p. 206).]--       --[Miot de Melito, who was a follower of Joseph Bonaparte, says, \"No     woman has united so much kindness to so much natural grace, or has     done more good with more pleasure than she did. She honoured me     with her friendship, and the remembrance of the benevolence she has     shown me, to the last moment of her too short existence, will never     be effaced from my heart\" (tome i. pp.101-2).]--       --[Meneval, the successor of Bourrienne in his place of secretary to     Napoleon, and who remained attached to the Emperor until the end,     says of Josephine (tome i. p. 227), \"Josephine was irresistibly     attractive. Her beauty was not regular, but she had 'La grace, plus     belle encore que la beaute', according to the good La Fontaine. She     had the soft abandonment, the supple and elegant movements, and the     graceful carelessness of the creoles.--(The reader must remember     that the term 'Creole' does not imply any taint of black blood, but     only that the person, of European family, has been born in the West     Indies.)--Her temper was always the same. She was gentle and     kind.\"]--    I am convinced that all who were acquainted with her must have felt  bound to speak well of her; to few, indeed, did she ever give cause for  complaint. In the time of her power she did not lose any of her friends,  because she forgot none of them. Benevolence was natural to her, but she  was not always prudent in its exercise. Hence her protection was often  extended to persons who did not deserve it. Her taste for splendour and  expense was excessive. This proneness to luxury became a habit which  seemed constantly indulged without any motive. What scenes have I not  witnessed when the moment for paying the tradesmen's bills arrived! She  always kept back one-half of their claims, and the discovery of this  exposed her to new reproaches. How many tears did she shed which might  have been easily spared!    When fortune placed a crown on her head she told me that the event,  extraordinary as it was, had been predicted: It is certain that she put  faith in fortune-tellers. I often expressed to her my astonishment that  she should cherish such a belief, and she readily laughed at her own  credulity; but notwithstanding never abandoned it: The event had given  importance to the prophecy; but the foresight of the prophetess, said to  be an old regress, was not the less a matter of doubt.    Not long before the 13th of Vendemiaire, that day which opened for  Bonaparte his immense career, he addressed a letter to me at Sens, in  which, after some of his usually friendly expressions, he said, \"Look  out a small piece of land in your beautiful valley of the Yonne. I will  purchase it as soon as I can scrape together the money. I wish to  retire there; but recollect that I will have nothing to do with national  property.\"    Bonaparte left Paris on the 21st of March 1796, while I was still with  my guardians. He no sooner joined the French army than General Colli,  then in command of the Piedmontese army, transmitted to him the  following letter, which, with its answer, I think sufficiently  interesting to deserve preservation:         GENERAL--I suppose that you are ignorant of the arrest of one of my     officers, named Moulin, the bearer of a flag of truce, who has been     detained for some days past at Murseco, contrary to the laws of war,     and notwithstanding an immediate demand for his liberation being     made by General Count Vital. His being a French emigrant cannot     take from him the rights of a flag of truce, and I again claim him     in that character. The courtesy and generosity which I have always     experienced from the generals of your nation induces me to hope that     I shall not make this application in vain; and it is with regret     that I mention that your chief of brigade, Barthelemy, who ordered     the unjust arrest of my flag of truce, having yesterday by the     chance of war fallen into my hands, that officer will be dealt with     according to the treatment which M. Moulin may receive.       I most sincerely wish that nothing may occur to change the noble and     humane conduct which the two nations have hitherto been accustomed     to observe towards each other. I have the honour, etc.,                              (Signed) COLLI.       CEVA. 17th April 1796.    Bonaparte replied as follows:         GENERAL--An emigrant is a parricide whom no character can render     sacred. The feelings of honour, and the respect due to the French     people, were forgotten when M. Moulin was sent with a flag of truce.     You know the laws of war, and I therefore do not give credit to the     reprisals with which you threaten the chief of brigade, Barthelemy.     If, contrary to the laws of war, you authorise such an act of     barbarism, all the prisoners taken from you shall be immediately     made responsible for it with the most deplorable vengeance, for I     entertain for the officers of your nation that esteem which is due     to brave soldiers.    The Executive Directory, to whom these letters were transmitted,  approved of the arrest of M. Moulin; but ordered that he should be  securely guarded, and not brought to trial, in consequence of the  character with which he had been invested.    About the middle of the year 1796 the Directory proposed to appoint  General Kellerman, who commanded the army of the Alps, second in command  of the army of Italy.    On the 24th of May 1796 Bonaparte wrote to, Carnot respecting, this  plan, which was far from being agreeable to him. He said, \"Whether I  shall be employed here or anywhere else is indifferent to me: to serve  the country, and to merit from posterity a page in our history, is all  my ambition. If you join Kellerman and me in command in Italy you will  undo everything. General Kellerman has more experience than I, and knows  how to make war better than I do; but both together, we shall make it  badly. I will not willingly serve with a man who considers himself the  first general in Europe.\"    Numbers of letters from Bonaparte to his wife have been published. I  cannot deny their authenticity, nor is it my wish to do so. I will,  however, subjoin one which appears to me to differ a little from the  rest. It is less remarkable for exaggerated expressions of love, and a  singularly ambitious and affected style, than most of the correspondence  here alluded to. Bonaparte is announcing the victory of Arcola to  Josephine.                             VERONA, the 29th, noon.       At length, my adored Josephine, I live again. Death is no longer     before me, and glory and honour are still in my breast. The enemy     is beaten at Arcola. To-morrow we will repair the blunder of     Vaubois, who abandoned Rivoli. In eight days Mantua will be ours,     and then thy husband will fold thee in his arms, and give thee a     thousand proofs of his ardent affection. I shall "]]]
