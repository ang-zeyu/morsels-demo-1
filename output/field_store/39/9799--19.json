Unfortunately his health gave  way, owing to his exertions, and he now lives in retirement at  Collingwood, in South Australia, where however he is still animated by the  most intense zeal for science.    [8] The expedition discovered on the 21st April, 1858, in 24 deg. 35' S. and  146 deg. 6' W., an ash tree, two feet in diameter, on whose huge trunk the  letter L had been deeply cut. Close by there were everywhere traces of a  regular encampment, and an impression pretty universally prevailed that  Leichhardt and his companions had camped here, and had cut this mark to  indicate it. One of the oldest missionaries of Western Australia, the  venerable Mr. C. Threlkeld, objected, however, to this view that the  letter L, of which so much was spoken, had in all probability been made by  one of the youthful natives, who when learning to read and write are in  the habit of cutting the letters on the trees. We present here the precise  passage of the text of a letter of Dr. Threlkeld's to us:--\"I send you a  spelling-book, that Billy Blue, one of the black boys, used to have, when  he was learning to read and write. He and others used to go into the bush,  and cut the letters of the alphabet on the barks of the trees, and Brown,  an aboriginal lad, who _went with the unfortunate Leichhardt_, used to do  the same. _I suspect that he cut the celebrated L on the tree about which  there is so much talk at the present time._\"    [9] One of the most appalling of these was that undertaken in April, 1848,  by surveyor E. B. Kennedy, along the strip of land between Cape York and  Rockingham Bay in Northern Australia, whose melancholy fate is described  by one of the survivors, Mr. Carron, a botanist, in a not less simple than  affecting manner. \"When we first started everything went on well, and the  most brilliant anticipations were indulged, although there were numerous  obstacles to be overcome, and the few natives we encountered were  invariably hostile. Gradually, however, provisions began to fail; sickness  and loss of strength succeeded, while the prospect of reaching our goal  grew less and less. The further north we got, as the hot season was now  setting in, the more frequently did we find the forest rivulets dried up,  so that we had for days to bear up against an almost maddening thirst. The  horses which accompanied the expedition gradually sank from exhaustion.\"  Almost every day Carron's journal mentions one or the other horse giving  in of fatigue, when they were compelled for want of further provision to  eat its flesh during the next two days. That of the last was conveyed  along by the travellers in sacks, made from the skin of the animal itself.  Whenever they encountered natives, these proved hostile, and assailed the  little caravan with spears. Some of them indeed were more friendly, and  traded with the travellers, but less out of sincere hospitality than with  the hope of taking them in, and getting them unawares into their power.  Thus, on one occasion a number of tall, well-made, powerful men and women  made their appearance, and offered them some fish, which they themselves  refused to eat owing to its putrified state. Hardly had the travellers  approached it, unsuspicious of evil, when a cloud of spears cleft the air  with a whistling noise, and the scene, hitherto so friendly and peaceable,  became at once a scene of blood and confusion. However, the spear-men  seemed to have no great dexterity; they usually missed their mark, whereas  the flints and double-barrels of the whites did deadly execution. One  however proved more fatal than the rest, and killed Mr. Kennedy, the chief  of the party. They were now only a few days distant from Cape York, the  goal of their labours, whence a Government ship was to convey the leader  and his party back to Sydney. But the survivors were also all but  exhausted with the terrible fatigues of their journey. Only three out of  the fourteen survived, and these were reduced almost to skeletons.  Carron's elbow-bone of the right arm, and also the bone of the right hip,  were through the skin! (Narrative of an Expedition undertaken under the  direction of the late Mr. Assistant Surveyor, E. B. Kennedy, for the  Exploration of the Country lying between Rockingham Bay and Cape York; by  W. Carron, one of the survivors of the Expedition. Sydney, 1849.)    Still more lamentable was the fate of the last and most important of these  expeditions, which in 1861 succeeded in crossing the Australian continent  from the north frontier of South Australia to Carpentaria, and back to  Cooper's Creek, in which, unfortunately, the travellers missed the depot  troop that had been sent to their assistance, and the entire party,  including Messrs. Burke, Wills, and Gray, lost their lives, only one of  their number, King, escaping to tell their sad fate. (Vide Appendix.)    [10] Government has bethought itself of a plan for facilitating  discoveries in the interior, and rendering them more profitable by  importing from Egypt into Australia camels and dromedaries, chiefly of the  breed known as El Hura, as these animals can easily get over 60 to 80  miles per diem, and can moreover dispense with water for weeks together.    [11] During a visit which our naturalists paid to Dr. Bennett they were  shown a young pair of the Morok (_Casuarius Bennetti_), discovered not  long since at New Britain, which he intended to present to the Zoological  Society of London for exhibition at the Regent's Park. What is very  remarkable in this singular bird is the shape of the bill, which is curved  in the male, but almost straight in the female.    [12] This distinguished gentleman, conspicuous alike as a theologian and a  politician, who plays a by no means insignificant part in the legislative  assemblies of the colonies, presented an address to the Parliament of  Frankfort in 1848, in which he set forth the advantage of founding a  German colony in the Pacific. Owing to the ignorance prevalent on the  subject this _brochure_ passed unnoticed, and New Caledonia, the island  which the worthy Doctor had designed for a German colony, was taken  possession of by the French. He has since published a most interesting and  valuable work on Queensland, in which he gives some very curious details  about the native practice of skinning their dead, when the true skin being  of a white colour, the corpse has a most ghastly appearance. He says this  is the reason some of the tribes so highly reverence the _white_ man, whom  they regard as their own ancestors restored to life, but in an improved  nature!!    [13] The depopulation of the natives is advancing so rapidly that one of  our Sydney friends writes, \"An expedition similar to your own, which shall  visit us some years hence, will find little more than a scant remnant of  the aborigines. That of the _Novara_ is probably the last of a scientific  nature, which will have been successful in seeing living specimens of the  once numerous blacks of Australia.\"    [14] _Wullurah_ in the native language signifies \"the place of  deliberation,\" because in former times this place had, on account of its  commanding position, been selected by the aborigines for assembling the  various tribes by means of watch-fires, or blasts of a horn, to decide  upon peace or war.    [15] On the Clarence river there has been for several years past, in full  activity, a stearine candle-factory, which pays well, owing to the demand  at the \"diggings\" for these candles. In 1856 the value of those  manufactured was L600,000.    [16] According to English writers this instrument, the peculiar properties  of which are so well known that we need not enlarge upon them here, has  also been found in the Sarcophagi of Upper Egypt. In some of the frescos  now in the British Museum, which illustrate the manners and habits of the  Ancient Egyptians, a figure is represented in the act of launching the  Boomerang against a covey of ducks, which are flying out of a thicket.    [17] In Prussia, the annual consumption of spirits would fill a basin one  mile long, 33 feet wide, and 10 feet deep. In England, the annual quantity  of _wine_ drunk per head is 0.267 gallon; in France it is 19 gallons! The  British nation pays annually L70-74,000,000 taxes, and L74,000,000 for  spirits!!    [18] The rise and fall of the tide at Port Jackson is very small, not  above four or five feet.    [19] Viz. 1400 men, and 200 women.    [20] This is the nickname given to the violent S. or S.W. wind,  fortunately of short duration, which so frequently springs up towards  evening from the \"Brickfields,\" because it brings with it such volumes of  sand and dust from the eminence known as the Brickfield lying S. and S.W.  from Sydney, enveloping the entire city in murky clouds of dust. The  \"Brickfielder\" is a pretty safe guide as to the weather, as soon as it  blows the whole sky becomes suddenly covered with clouds, and cool rainy  weather follows upon the previous heat.    [21] The imports of wool from Germany had, in 1836, risen to 31,766,194  lbs., but it has since then rapidly receded, owing mainly to the increased  production in the English colonies.    [22] We present an official account of the live stock in the settlement at  Port Jackson, May 1st, 1788, which forms an interesting contrast with the  development of its resources since that period:                         | S | M | C | B | C |                       | t | a | o | u | o |                       | a | r | l | l | w |                       | l | e | t | l | s |                       | l | s | s | s | . |                       | i | . | . | . |   |                       | o |   |   |   |   |                       | n |   |   |   |   |    TO WHOM BELONGING. | s |   |   |   |   |                       | . |   |   |   |  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38480"],[0,"Scientific American, Vol. XXXIX.—No. 24.

He says that while investigating the peculiar behavior of the  hydrocarbons and their singular quality of separating the precious  metals from aqueous solutions, assisted by constant application that  furnished evidence of the force of chemical action which could be  satisfactorily measured, there occurred to him the probability that  analogous effects might be traced in the operations of nature; more  particularly in certain geological formations peculiar to auriferous  soils. These ideas, he asserts, have been singularly verified in  subsequent research by the discovery of gold in many samples of crude  petroleum, also in the sediment or refuse of the distillation of that  substance. The attraction existing between the hydrocarbons and many  elementary bodies ought to create no surprise, especially if reference  is had to the reducing action of the hydrocarbons in contact with  metallic solutions. The procedure in the examples above referred to  consist in pouring crude petroleum on vegetable fiber or wood shavings  and firing it, collecting the ashes and making the usual fire assay.  The cupel disclosed a small pellet. After due examination with the  appropriate test it was found to be pure gold. The distillery refuse  when assayed gave $34.85 value per ton. It may be mentioned in the  last case considerable molybdenum was present, a substance resembling  plumbago. Mr. Turnbridge has no knowledge of the locality whence  these samples of crude petroleum were originally obtained. He infers,  however, that oil wells in the vicinity of auriferous deposits may  yield a larger quantity of gold than from oil wells situated  in carboniferous strata. There has been, he states, a practical  application of this discovery for the recovery of gold, applied in  cases where quicksilver has failed to be of service.           *       *       *       *       *          REDUCTION OF NITRATE OF SILVER BY MEANS OF CHARCOAL.      A very simple method of reducing nitrate of silver, analagous to  that some years ago mentioned by the late Mr. Hadow, is given in the  _Archiv der Pharmacie_, by Mr. C. F. Chandler. If crystallized or  fused nitrate of silver be placed upon glowing charcoal, combustion  forthwith takes place, the silver remaining behind in a metallic  form, while nitrous oxide and carbonic acid are freely given off. The  nitrate of silver is fused by the heat developed by the reaction,  and is imbibed through the pores of the charcoal; as every atom of  consumed carbon is replaced by an atom of metallic silver, the original  form and structure of the charcoal are preserved intact in pure  silver. By proceeding in this manner it is possible to produce silver  structures of any desired size, possessing in every way the original  form of the wood. A crystal of nitrate of silver is in the first place  put upon a piece of charcoal, and a blowpipe flame is then applied in  the vicinity, in order to start the reaction in the first instance,  and as soon as combustion commences crystal after crystal may be  added as these, one after another, become consumed. The silver salt is  liquefied, and penetrates into the charcoal, where it becomes reduced.  Pieces of silver may in this way be prepared, of one or two ounces in  weight, which exhibit all the markings and rings of the original wood  to a most perfect and beautiful degree.           *       *       *       *       *          NEW AGRICULTURAL INVENTIONS.      Mr. Charles E. Macarthy, of Forsyth, Ga., has patented an improved  Horse Power, designed more particularly to be located beneath a gin  house for ginning cotton, but applicable for all purposes for which a  horse power is ordinarily employed.    An improved Corn Planter has been patented by Mr. Thomas A. Sammons,  of Lewisburg, West Va. This corn planter is designed to plant the  corn in straight rows both ways and at varying distances apart. It  is constructed upon the general principle of a reciprocating slide,  passing alternately beneath a hopper, and carrying a number of grains  from beneath the same to a discharge outlet.    An improved machine for Cutting the Bands of Gavels or bundles of  grain, and feeding the same to the cylinder of a thrasher, has been  patented by Mr. James M. O'Neall, of Fort Worth, Texas.    An improved Sulky Breaking Plow has been patented by Mr. Edward T.  Hunter, of Hallsville, Ill. This is an improved sulky attachment for  breaking plows, which is so constructed as to receive any ordinary  plow; it may be adjusted to cause the plow to work deeper or shallower  in the ground, and will allow the plow to be turned to either side.    Mr. Osman C. Du Souchet, of Alexandria, Mo., has invented an improved  Check Row Corn Planter and Drill, which is so constructed that its  operating mechanism may be at all times under the control of the  driver. It will plant the corn in accurate check row, and is easily  controlled.    An improved Thrashing Machine has been patented by Mr. Peter Parrott,  of Red Bud, Ill. This is an improvement in the class of thrashing  machines having an attachment for removing dust from the space in  front of the cylinder, and having pickers for loosening or shaking the  grain from straw delivered from the cylinder.    An improved Corn Planter has been patented by Mr. John H. Zarley, of  Oakland, Ill. The object of this invention is to provide an efficient  and cheaply constructed corn planter, which may be drawn forward by  horses, but is arranged so that the seed valves may be operated by  hand.    Messrs. Clayton M. Van Orman and James M. Hagenbaugh, of Athens,  Mich., have patented an improved Grain Separator, in which the  arrangement of the screens, feedboard, and blast of a fanning mill  effect the thorough removal from the grain of all impurities. Only two  screens are employed.    An improved Churning Apparatus has been patented by Messrs. William  H. Foster and Isaac C. Roberts, of Louisburg, Kan. It is simple,  inexpensive, convenient, and effective in operation. It will bring the  butter very quickly, and at the same time gather it.    An improved Plow has been patented by Mr. Robert B. Mitchell, of  Minneapolis, Kan. The object of this invention is to improve the  construction of sod, stirring, and other plows, so that the cutter  may be moved forward as it is worn or ground off. It prevents roots,  grass, and other trash from gathering upon the share.    Messrs. John B. Martin and William T. Carothers, of Clarence, Mo.,  have patented an improved Hay Loader capable of placing hay upon  stacks or ricks, or upon wagons. It is simple in its construction and  effective in its operation.           *       *       *       *       *          NAPHTHA AND BENZINE.      We have often been asked the difference between benzine and naphtha,  many people wanting to know whether naphtha didn't include benzine, or  whether it wasn't the same thing under a marketable name. A prominent  refiner says that benzine is the first product that arises from the  process of refining crude oil, and bears the same relation to naphtha  that that distillate does to refined oil. In other words, benzine  is crude naphtha. The reason it is not quotable under the name of  benzine, therefore, is because it has to be reduced to naphtha before  it is marketable in any extensive quantity.    The process that benzine is subject to, to produce naphtha, is not a  separate business, but is carried on by the regular oil refiners in  the same stills and retorts that the refined oil is produced. The  benzine is treated with sulphuric acid, and the result is naphtha,  which is in wide demand in Europe, especially in France, for the  purpose of producing aniline dyes, while it is also put to many other  purposes.    This demand is partially instrumental in keeping up its price, but its  rapid evaporation also has a tendency in that direction, as any large  seller of it has to take into consideration the depreciation that  might take place by the time he sells it on that account, and for  the same reason buyers give no more orders than immediate necessity  requires.    All refiners, however, do not produce naphtha, but some of them sell  the benzine, which is largely used for fuel purposes, for which it is  much better than coal, as it is not only absolutely cheaper, but gives  a steadier heat.--_Parker Daily_.           *       *       *       *       *    For joining the porcelain heads to the metal spikes used for  ornamental nails, the _Prakt.

An experience of more than thirty years, and the preparation of not  less than one hundred thousand applications for patents at home  and abroad, enable us to understand the laws and practice on both  continents, and to possess unequaled facilities for procuring patents  everywhere. In addition to our facilities for preparing drawings and  specifications quickly, the applicant can rest assured that his case  will be filed in the Patent Office without delay. Every application,  in which the fees have been paid, is sent complete--including the  model--to the Patent Office the same day the papers are signed at our  office, or received by mail, so there is no delay in filing the case,  a complaint we often hear from other sources. Another advantage to the  inventor in securing his patent through the Scientific American Patent  Agency, it insures a special notice of the invention in the SCIENTIFIC  AMERICAN, which publication often opens negotiations for the sale of  the patent or manufacture of the article.
