She looked 90  years of age, with her white, wrinkled face, and she was fast asleep,  like a little child. Many children are on the roads, packed tight into  farm carts with household furniture and bundles of clothing, and poultry  and pigs and new-born lambs. The noise of the gunfire is behind them,  and they move faster when it grows louder. They are very brave, these  boys and girls and these old people. There is hardly any weeping or any  look on their faces of grudge against this unkind turn of fate. They  seem to accept it with stoical resignation, with most matter-of-fact  courage, and their only answer to pity is a smile and the words, 'C'est  la guerre.' Those are words I first heard in the early weeks of the war  and hoped never to hear again.    \"Many of these people trek in family groups and gatherings of families  from one village. Small boys and girls drag tired cows after them. The  other day one of these cows leaned against every tree she passed and  then sat down, and the girl with her looked around helplessly, not  knowing what to do. This morning I saw the girl wearing a veil and  dressed in an elegant way, taking the cow with her. She was quite alone  on the road. It is queer and touching that most of these fugitives wear  their best clothes, as though on a fete day. It is because they are  clothes they want to save and can only have by wearing them in their  flight.    \"In one small town the fear of the German entry came at night, a bright,  moonlight night into which there came many German bombing squadrons. The  citizens had shut up their shops and stood about talking anxiously. Then  fear and rumor spread among them, and all through the night there was an  exodus of small families and solitary girls and comrades in misfortune,  stealing away like shadows from homes they loved, from little fortunes  or their shops, from all their normal life into the open country, where  the moonlight lay white and cold on the fields. Behind them bombs were  being dropped, and some of their houses were destroyed.    \"C'est la guerre!\"      WORK OF AMERICAN GIRLS    The heroic work of the Smith College girls was described by a  correspondent at the French front under date of March 29:    \"Working unceasingly under a constant shellfire, for days without sleep,  the girls demonstrated admirable initiative and ability and the extreme  coolness of the tried soldier. They are still in the field today,  ministering to old men, women, and children. I have talked to the first  persons to come in from the front, who saw them last Saturday, when  shells were falling at Grecourt, the tiny Somme village where the unit  has been quartered for months, aiding the folks of a dozen surrounding  villages.    \"When it became evident that the Germans were coming the girls worked  frantically with auto trucks, gathering together all the people in  their territory. In one village they went three times to try to persuade  an aged woman to leave, but she refused to move unless the ancestral  bedstead on which she lay could be transported with her. In final  desperation the girls brought a big supply wagon and loaded the bedstead  and the woman into it, leaving the village fifteen minutes before the  first of the Uhlans arrived.    \"The girls organized themselves into small units and each unit was  charged with the evacuation of a single village. Cavalcades of refugees,  generaled by the Smith girls, marched or rode from their abandoned homes  to Roye, where a special train was waiting to carry them westward. Even  cows, chickens, dogs, and cats helped to form the cavalcade which  reached Roye on Saturday morning. Here the refugees vainly tried to  crowd the animals into the train.    \"The girls of the Smith College unit then proceeded to Montdidier.  There, with W. B. Jackson of Washington, a former Red Cross delegate at  Ham, assisted by a group of American Quakers and Red Cross workers, they  organized a canteen and began giving out blankets and other comforts and  making a marvelous bean soup and a special food for babies, the basis of  which was condensed milk. As the refugee trains, some containing as many  as 1,000 men, women, and children, poured into Montdidier the arriving  refugees were fed until the supply of food was exhausted.    \"Then Montdidier became too hot under the increasing shellfire and the  workers were forced to split, some going to Amiens and others to  Beauvais, where they continued their work. Since then practically all  the Smith College girls and some other workers have gone to Amiens,  where they are weathering the enemy bombardment in cellars, but carrying  on their work as usual.\"      FLEEING IN BEST CLOTHES    An Associated Press correspondent added this further bit of eyewitness  testimony under date of March 27:    \"The French refugees of the better class departing from the zones of  actual operations are coming out clad in all their finery, which  represents the styles of four or five years ago. Then there are sturdy  peasants with wooden shoes and clumsily constructed clothes, riding in  vehicles drawn by horses or donkeys or in carts pushed by men, and some  are even in wheelbarrows. Upon these queer transports are stacked  strange assortments of personal belongings.    \"There is deep pathos in all this, but none struck the correspondent  more forcibly than the appearance of a tiny girl who trudged in her  wooden shoes along a hard, dusty road, her eyes fastened anxiously upon  a dirty rag doll perched precariously at the top of household effects  which were being pushed along by an old man. This child was perhaps  representative of all the refugees--she was coming away with her most  cherished possession, her baby doll, and was prepared to guard it at all  costs; her aching feet were as nothing, so long as the doll was safe.    \"These refugees are from the towns within the Somme battlefield and  adjoining it. All these villages have been emptied of their inhabitants.  So far as possible everything which might be of use to the Germans has  been removed. In particular, large numbers of cattle have been taken  away by the owners, who patiently drive the beasts on ahead of them  along the roads.    \"There are few tears or hysterical outbreaks among the refugees, most of  whom are of the peasant class. They know they must go, and they seem to  be trusting implicitly in the British, but the misery in their eyes as  they turn from all they love to a world they do not know is touching.  Aged women clinging to the hands of little grandchildren, men stooped  with years, youths and maidens--all fall into a picture such as only a  catastrophe can produce.\"    Fifty members of the American Friends' unit of the Red Cross were in the  region of the great battle, at Ham, Liancourt, Esmery-Hallon,  Golancourt, and Gruny on the Somme and Aisne. These devoted workers,  with the aid of many Red Cross trucks that were rushed to them, helped  thousands of refugees to safety.    The French Government had several hundred tractor plows at work on the  stricken lands. The American relief units also had a few tractor plows  and other agricultural materials, all of which had to be abandoned to  the enemy. All members of relief units were reported safe.      Castor Oil for Airplanes    How an important agricultural enterprise was initiated to meet one of  the requirements of the Aviation Section of the American Army is  disclosed in the minority report of the Senate Military Affairs  Committee, presented on April 12, 1918. In the course of a description  of the initial difficulties encountered in producing battle planes, the  report says:    \"Remember again that when these combat planes were contracted for the  only known lubricating oil adapted to their delicate parts was an oil  made from the castor bean. There were not enough beans in this country  to make anywhere near the amount of oil required. Neither were there  enough seeds with which to grow the needed quantity of beans. The Signal  Corps had to search the globe for seeds, and finally secured a shipload  from distant India. Then the corps had to contract for the planting of  the seeds in this country, and has succeeded in having about 110,000  acres planted. It is now claimed that a form of petroleum has been  developed that will answer the same purpose. This, however, is still in  the experimental stage, while the oil from the castor bean is known to  be entirely adequate and reliable.\"          Progress of the War    Recording Campaigns on All Fronts and Collateral Events From March 18,  1918, Up to and Including April 17, 1918      UNITED STATES    The German Government announced on March 18 that American property in  Germany would be seized in reprisal for the seizure of German property  in the United States.    Drastic restrictions were placed by the War Trade Board upon the  importation of many nonessential commodities, the regulations to become  effective April 15.    The terms of the Third Liberty Loan were announced by Secretary McAdoo  on March 25. The bill authorizing it was completed by Congress and  signed by President Wilson on April 4, and on April 6 the drive began.    Secretary Daniels, in a speech in Cleveland on April 6, disclosed the  fact that a great fleet of American vessels, including battleships, was  operating in the war zone.    Announcement was made in Tokio on March 28 that an agreement had been  concluded under which Japan promised to turn over to the United States  450,000 tons of shipping.    President Wilson issued a proclamation on April 11, giving Secretary  McAdoo control of the principal coastwise steamship lines.    Charles M. Schwab was appointed Director General of the Emergency Fleet  Corporation April 16."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38767"],[0,"Spanish Highways and Byways (#16)"],[1,"a choice variety of insects.    \"But even yet one cannot call one's self a Protestant in Spain, you  know,\" said an English diplomat to us in another city of Andalusia.  \"It's not socially respectable. Spanish Protestants are the very scum  of the earth--illiterate, dirty, boorish. You couldn't associate with  them for a minute.\"    \"But that Spanish pastor who called on us yesterday was entirely a  gentleman,\" we remonstrated. \"He has studied for seven years in  Switzerland and Scotland, seems more open-minded and intelligent than  most Spaniards we have met, and was so courteous and graceful in his  bearing--not to mention the whiteness of his linen--and so  entertaining in his talk, that the Spanish ladies in the room  chorussed his praises, after he had bowed himself out, and declared  him most delightful company.\"    The diplomat twirled his mustache and smiled, as only diplomats can.  \"And you owned up that he was a Protestant? And their faces darkened  as if a storm-cloud had blown over from the Sierras?\"    \"Precisely so,\" we admitted, \"and after that the best they could say  for him was that they never would have thought it.\"    The diplomat claimed that he had made his point, while we protested  that the incident only went to show how unreasonable was the prejudice  of whose existence throughout Spain there can be no manner of doubt.    Perez Galdos, for instance, the most popular novelist of the day,  stated to an American friend, who repeated it to us, that he frankly  could not afford to introduce the figure of a Protestant into one of  his stories. \"It would not only kill that book,\" he said, \"but it  would hurt the sale of everything I have in the market and embarrass  all my future undertakings. I should simply be risking the loss of my  reading public.\" And yet Senor Galdos is the author of \"Dona  Perfecta,\" that artistic study of the conflict between new ideas and  old in Spain. In this significant novel, a civil engineer, a man of  thirty, whose scientific education in the large cities of Seville and  Madrid has been supplemented by study in Germany and England, comes to  one of those mediaeval towns, or corpses of towns, that rise so  spectre-like from the ash-colored plains of Old Castile. Crumbling  walls and blackened towers jealously guard the life of ages since,  that feudal life of high and low, pride of station, pride of animal  prowess, pride of holiness, pride of idleness, pride of ignorance; the  life of superstition, of family exclusiveness resulting in  intermarriage to the point of insanity; of that fierce local bigotry,  peculiarly Spanish, which dreads and hates all foreign intrusion. The  streets, devoid of business activity, swarm with vigorous mendicants,  who have no better shift, when times grow hard, than to deform the  children who are born to them like kittens in their mud-walled hovels.  The casino, where half the town smokes half its time away, hums with  malicious gossip. The university languidly pursues the studies of  Latin, scholastic divinity, Church history, and all that savors of the  past. Under the gray vault of the cathedral women kneel before the  image of the Christ Child, bringing Him a new pair of embroidered  pantalets and entreating of His rosy simplicity what they would not  dare ask from the \"Ecce Homo\"; or they kiss the satin-slippered feet  of the miracle-working Virgin and vow her, if their prayer is granted,  seven bright new swords of the finest Toledo workmanship to pierce her  patient heart. The man of scientific training, fresh from the modern  world, is brought into sharp collision with this dim old town. High  principles and essential, spiritual Christianity count him for  nothing; he is speedily denounced as no better than \"a murderer, an  atheist, or a Protestant,\" and his strong young life is actually  beaten out by that blind, terrible force of Spanish fanaticism. So far  the novelist can go; such a hero he dares paint; but not a Protestant.    The notions of Protestantism prevalent among the people, not the  peasants only, but the gentry, are little short of ludicrous. A  black-eyed lady of Cadiz was amazed at our assertion that Protestants  prayed. A Madrid senorita asked us, in friendly confidence, if it were  true that Protestants \"denied Christ and spat on the Virgin.\" The  popular identification of Protestantism with all that is impious and  criminal we encountered as early as our second afternoon in Spain. We  were visiting, in the picturesque fishing-hamlet of Pasajes, a gaunt  Basque church, where the old dame who served as caretaker showed us a  waxen image of a sleeping girl, said, not without probability, to have  been brought from Rome. Beneath the figure is a burial stone, whose  inscription would locate it in the Catacombs. When friends of ours  were at Pasajes some three years before, the grandam's story ran that  the image was the likeness of a Christian martyr, slain by her pagan  father at Rome in the time of the Imperial persecutions; but the tale  glibly recited to us was this: \"_Ay de mi!_ The poor young lady! Her  father was a Protestant, and, of course, hated religion, and when his  daughter, so beautiful, was on her way to her first communion, he hid  behind a corner, with an axe, and of a sudden jumped out on her and  struck her dead.\"    It is such prejudice that goes far toward justifying the maintenance  by foreign societies of Protestant churches in Spain. They cannot  stand alone, in face of all this hostility, and yet the country has  need of them. No European nation can nowadays be shut in to any single  channel of religious life, and doubtless, apart from all questions of  creed, there are Spanish temperaments to which the simpler _culto_ is  more natural than the elaborate ritual of Rome; but, waiving  discussion as to the relative gifts and graces of these two great  divisions of Christ's fellowship, the new seems essential, not for  itself alone, but as a stimulus and corrective to the old. Time may  make it clear that a purified Roman Catholicism is better suited to  the Latin races in general than plainer rites and less symbolic  worship, but there are heavy counts against the Roman Catholic Church  as it exists in Spain. The private lives of the clergy, as a class,  have been so open to reproach that even the finger-games and nonsense  songs of the little children, learned with their baby lispings, mock  priestly immorality. The Church, steward of untold wealth, has endowed  many charities, but the fundamental trust of knowledge it has most  sluggishly and inadequately dispensed. Santiago de Compostela, for  example, is a very nest of religious foundations. Thirty-six Christian  fraternities are gathered there, yet we were told on good authority  that not one peasant in a hundred of those within hearing of  Santiago's fivescore and fourteen holy bells can read and write. In  matters of State, the Church has utterly lost the allegiance of the  progressive party and, to a large extent, the political confidence of  the nation. As Spaniards study the history of their country, they  realize more and more that her colossal mistakes and misfortunes have  been due in large measure to Jesuit and Dominical policy--to the  father confessor in the royal chamber, the inquisitor in shadow of  the throne. With reference to the success of the Church in promoting  spiritual life, a beautiful young nun, her eyes glistening like happy  stars, assured us that there was more devotion in Catholic Spain than  in all the rest of Christendom. A scientist of repute, his voice  choking with grief and wrath, declared to us that the fetters of  superstition had become hopelessly riveted, during these ages of  Church control, on the Spanish mind. But call it what you will,  devotion or superstition, and admitting, as the tourist must, that it  is a most conspicuous and impressive feature of Spanish life, there  are nevertheless thousands of Spaniards, especially the younger men,  over whom it has lost sway. These are the _indiferentes_, many of whom  might find, as some have found, in a fresh presentation of  Christianity, the Godward impetus which they no longer gain from the  Church of Rome.    The most cheerful _indiferente_ I encountered in Spain was a whimsical  old philosopher, well on his way to the nineties, yet so brisk and  hardy as almost to vie with Borrow's Portuguese dame whose hair \"was  becoming gray\" after a life of one hundred and ten years. His hair,  indeed, is white, and extreme age has written its deforming marks on  face and figure, yet he runs up the steepest stairs, reads the finest  print, fills his days with a close succession of labors and  amusements, and scoffs at religion as airily as if Death had passed  him on the crowded way and would never turn back to look for him  again.    At our first meeting he offered, with characteristic kindness, to come  and read Spanish with me. As I had invaded Spain for the express  purpose of studying the Spanish drama, I took a volume of Calderon  from my trunk and hopefully awaited his visit. But it was a matter of  several visits before I could open my Calderon. The jaunty old  cavalier arrived, brimming over with chat and anecdote, and when at  last I hinted at the reading, produced with pride from his inner coat  pocket a little, paper-bound _geografia_ that he had written himself  for use in the Spanish schools, and proceeded to regale me with  extracts from its pages. I looked severely at the little artist, whose  eyes were dancing in a demure face, and endeavored to profit by this  unexpected course of instruction. The author chuckled much over his  sagacity in having arranged the subject-matter of his book in  paragraphs and not by question and answer. In the latter case, he  explained, the children would learn the answers without reading the  questions, a process bound to result in geographical confusion. The  little volume, as is the wont of"]]]
